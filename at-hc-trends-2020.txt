Prologue
How did we get here?
T
HE WORLD TODAY looks remarkably 
different from the one in which we launched 
the first Global Human Capital Trends 
report in 2011. The past decade has been marked 
by radical change, by a “newness” that has evolved 
at a pace that can only be described as exponential. 
Technology invaded the workplace at a speed that 
would have been unimaginable a decade prior. 
Workforce demographics shifted substantially, 
with five generations in the workforce, a decline in 
working-age populations in many advanced 
economies, and an increase in the focus on equality 
for all workers as it relates to pay and treatment.1 
And as the workforce evolved, so did worker 
expectations—with calls for organizations to do 
more to help improve individuals’ lives, address 
societal problems, mitigate technology’s 
unintended consequences, and act equitably 
and ethically. 
Throughout these significant changes, our annual 
Global Human Capital Trends report has offered 
readers an opportunity to understand each 
moment in history, viewing the current economic, 
cultural, and technological landscape through the 
perspective of people and business. Before 
launching into the 2020 report, we reflect on the 
forces that have shaped the world of work over the 
past decade. 
The early decade: 
Emerging from the shadow 
of the recession
When we wrote our first report in 2011, the world 
was gaining a sense of economic stability following 
the Great Recession of 2007–2009. Global 
financial markets were showing signs of recovery 
after the downturn of the previous few years, with 
the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index rising to

HAS BEEN ONE OF  TREMENDOUS CHANGE—WITH MORE TO COME.

within 200 points of the precrash high by the 
middle of 2011.2 Governments, looking to mitigate 
future risk, were introducing new regulations such 
as Dodd-Frank and global standards like Basel III. 
Our 2011 report commented on the impact new 
regulations had across all industries, with 
governments playing a greater role in shaping 
business plans than ever before.3 
Amid these regulations, organizations buckled 
down with a renewed focus on cost and 
compliance. We saw an emphasis on getting the 
core right across both technology and operations—
an undertaking that became more challenging as 
organizations grew more complex and more 
diverse. Leaders were tasked with driving 
operational efficiency in their divisions and teams, 
often leading to a siloed approach to enterprise 
issues as each leader focused on their specific area 
of the business with very little crossover 
or collaboration.
The beginning of the decade also brought the 
emergence of revolutionary technologies. Artificial 
intelligence had reached the point where it could 
now beat humans at tasks ranging from recognizing 
traffic signs to answering trivia questions.4 Cloud 
was transforming business models by offering 
organizations a lower cost of entry, faster speed to 
solutions, and greater adaptability. And the 
explosion of data in the workplace exposed new 
business priorities and challenged conventional 
decision-making. 
By 2013, something had changed. In that year’s 
report, Resetting Horizons, we explored how 
leading organizations were pivoting away from the 
Great Recession to new horizons of talent, 
globalization, growth, and innovation.5 And while 
continued business uncertainty seemed inevitable, 
there was an openness to harnessing this 
uncertainty and turning it into a competitive 
advantage. 
We began to see a new, untethered optimism in 
business that had not been present in the five years 
since the recession. The economy experienced an 
accelerated rebound; the S&P 500 rose almost 
30 percent over 2013 with no major periods of 
correction.6 The EU debt crisis seemed to be 
calming following the European Central Bank’s late 
2012 announcement that it would provide 
additional support to eurozone countries involved 
in a sovereign state bailout/precautionary 
program.7 The expansion of globalization furthered 
the expansion of business in Asia: The number of 
Chinese companies on the global Fortune 500 list 
rose from 47 in 2010 to 95 in 2014.8 In short, the 
global business world seemed to be on the verge of 
writing a new chapter in history.
The mid-decade: The 
future of work arrives
As we entered the middle of the decade, the world 
was not the same place that it had been just a few 
years prior. Technology, which continued to 
transform the day-to-day lives of people around the 
world, had also come to work. While the 
foundations of digital—mobile, cloud, social 
media—were established early in the decade, by the 
middle of the decade this shifted to a world in 
which technology was viewed as a driver and 
enabler of every aspect of work. Even in emerging 
markets such as China, where the fast-growing 
online economy had created 282 million internet 
users under age 25 alone,9 the digital organization 
was often becoming a C-suite topic. Humans and 
technology had become coworkers in ways that 
would have been difficult to predict even a few 
years prior. 
Yet, despite the explosion of new technology, 
productivity was the lowest it had been since 
1970.10 Furthermore, negative side effects from the 
explosion of technology started to appear. As we

wrote in our 2014 discussion of 
The overwhelmed employee, “Information 
overload and the always-connected 24/7 work 
environment were overwhelming workers, 
undermining productivity, and contributing to low 
employee engagement.”11 In the race to take 
advantage of the promise of new technology, many 
organizations had failed to consider what other 
changes would be necessary in order to unlock the 
real potential of bringing new technologies into the 
world of work. 
The magnitude of this challenge started to come 
into focus in our 2016 report, The new
organization: Different by design, which explored 
the possibility that companies would need to 
transform themselves to handle an emerging “new 
social contract” between employers and workers.12 
By 2017, as the tensions between humans and 
technology continued to accelerate, it became clear 
that an even more radical transformation would be 
required to enable humans and technology to work 
productively together. In that year’s report, 
Rewriting the rules for the digital age, we 
questioned whether some traditional structures 
and orthodoxies were holding some organizations 
back from the expected technology-driven 
productivity gains.13 We suggested that 
organizations needed to “rewrite the rules” to 
navigate the exponential change that arrived with 
the full onset of the digital age.
Those new rules would require more than merely 
inserting technologies into existing structures and 
processes. Instead, organizations needed to think 
about how to redesign jobs and redesign work in 
ways that represented a fusion of, rather than a 
trade-off between, humans and technology. With 
the recognition that technology, human, and 
business issues are not separate but intertwined 
came the realization that these issues would have 
to be approached in new ways. They would need to 
reconfigure themselves to work in networks of 
teams that included both people and machines, 
drawing on adaptable organizational structures to 
drive greater agility. They would also need to work 
differently as leaders—bringing an integrated 
enterprise mindset at every turn. We found 
ourselves then at the epicenter of the future of 
work, beginning the journey to fundamentally 
reinvent work, workforces, and workplaces. 
The late decade: Enter 
the social enterprise
In the late decade, it became clear that a critical 
aspect of the “new organization” was often still 
missing if organizations hoped to unlock the power 
of humans and technology together. While 
organizations were beginning to redesign work 
around technology, new social forces were also 
playing a pivotal role.
Despite the economic recovery the world had seen 
since 2008, many people remained frustrated that 
financial gains failed to improve individuals’ lives 
and address larger societal problems. Earlier in the 
decade, we saw the power of social movements in 
an increasingly connected world, such as Black 
Lives Matter (2013), Love Wins (2015), Brexit and 
the Remain Campaign (2016), and Me Too (2017). 
As a result, many individuals started to turn to 
businesses even more than governments to help fill 
a widening leadership vacuum in society.14
These factors led to a call for an even more 
radically different type of organization. In 
our 2018 report, we introduced the concept of the 
social enterprise:
A social enterprise is an organization 
whose mission combines revenue growth 
and profitmaking with the need to respect 
and support its environment and 
stakeholder network. This includes 
listening to, investing in, and actively 
managing the trends that are shaping

today’s world. It is an organization that 
shoulders its responsibility to be a good 
citizen (both inside and outside the 
organization), serving as a role model for 
its peers and promoting a high degree of 
collaboration at every level of the 
organization.15
The social enterprise clarified and expanded on the 
“new social contract” that we posited in 2016, 
proposing a more human-centered rewiring of the 
relationships between the individual and 
organization and the organization and society, with 
a goal of providing stability in a world that was 
quickly changing. Becoming a social enterprise, we 
wrote, was about much more than corporate social 
responsibility. It was about shifting the ways 
organizations worked to balance the concerns of 
the organization with those of the broader 
ecosystem. This need prompted a new way of 
orchestrating teams of leaders. The concept of the 
“Symphonic C-suite” was our top-ranked trend for 
importance that year, reflecting organizations’ 
recognition that having an enterprise mindset was 
more than nice to have, but often essential to deal 
with the challenges that the social enterprise now 
faced: the integration of humans and technology, 
the combination of shareholder and stakeholder 
needs, and the ability to balance profit 
and purpose.
The 2018 report was part trends, part blueprint, 
and part call to action, challenging today’s 
business, nonprofit, and government enterprises to 
understand the shift represented by the social 
enterprise and helping to play an active role in 
making this new type of organization a priority. 
And the 2019 report continued the discussion with 
the point that the social enterprise is essentially 
human in both design and operation. In that 
report, we offered five human principles for the 
social enterprise as “benchmarks for reinvention”—
an acknowledgment that there would be no one 
playbook for organizations who embarked on this 
transformation.16
Looking ahead, much in the same way that we 
started the decade in uncertainty, we appear to be 
headed back into a period of uncertainty. Some of 
the drivers, such as demographics, are systemic; 
some, such as the rise of nationalism and 
restrictions on free trade, are political; and some, 
such as the rate at which exponential technologies 
continue to change the business landscape, are 
technological. Whether this uncertainty is a 
hinderance or a push forward depends on how we 
approach some of the inherent conflicts that are 
emerging. The good news is that we will approach 
these challenges with a very different mindset than 
the one we had at the start of the decade—the 
mindset of the social enterprise.

Introduction
The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a 
path forward
I
N JUST A few short years, the concept of the 
social enterprise—an organization whose mission 
combines revenue growth and profit-making with 
the need to respect and support its environment 
and stakeholder network—has grown from an 
intriguing new idea into a concrete business reality. 
BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink made 
headlines in 2018 when, in his annual letter to 
CEOs, he asserted that “society is demanding that 
companies, both public and private, serve a social 
purpose.”1 Barely two years later, the Business 
Roundtable, in a letter initially signed by the CEOs 
of 181 of the world’s largest companies that has 
continued to gain signatures since, redefined the 
purpose of a corporation as serving all 
stakeholders, not just shareholders.2 And at the 
2020 World Economic Forum, purpose and ethics 
were central themes on the agenda.3 In fact, 50 
percent of respondents in this year’s Global Human 
Capital Trends survey, which polled nearly 9,000 
business and HR leaders in 119 countries, 
categorized their organization’s purpose as 
broadening extensively to include all stakeholders, 
including the communities they serve and society 
at large.
Driving the social enterprise’s accelerating 
momentum has been a continuing societal shift 
toward individual empowerment and advocacy in 
workers’ relationships with their employers. In 
2018 and 2019, people went on strike in numbers 
not seen since the 1980s4 to demand changes 
ranging from better working conditions to gender 
pay equity.5 Concerns about access to employment, 
wage inequality, and organizations’ impact on 
communities continue to make headlines.6 These 
mounting societal expectations—combined, in 
many countries, with greater worker power due to 
low unemployment rates—have put human 
concerns front and center for organizations and 
society. 
At the same time as these human concerns were 
playing out, another equally powerful phenomenon 
was underway: an intense focus on technology as a 
primary driver, if not the primary driver, of 
enterprise value. “Every company is a technology 
company” became a common mantra as 
organizations invested billions in “digital 
transformation” efforts intended to turbocharge 
value creation through innovative technological 
applications. 
THE POWER OF THE SOCIAL ENTERPRISE LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO BRING A HUMAN FOCUS
TO EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES, EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY WITH 
TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE LASTING VALUE FOR THEMSELVES, THEIR ORGANIZATIONS, AND 
SOCIETY AT LARGE.
The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

11
However, through it all, most organizations viewed 
their efforts to address human and social concerns 
as wholly separate from their efforts around 
technology—the two conversations ran on separate 
tracks. Even today, pundits who connect the two 
realms often portray human interests not only as 
separate from, but as antithetical to, organizations’ 
interest in capitalizing on technology to its fullest. 
Many individuals have come to subscribe to this 
latter view as well, most obviously in the belief that 
AI and robotics are an imminent threat to human 
employment. 
Now, however, it’s time to challenge the view that 
technology and humanity are distinct domains, or 
even fundamentally at odds. We believe that the 
greater value often comes from a fusion of the two.  
Last year, we put out a call to action on this front 
by asking organizations to “reinvent with a human 
focus.” But as we enter into a new decade, we have 
realized that that we need to go one step further. 
Instead of asking how to humanize a work 
environment inundated by technology, the deeper 
question for organizations is how they can leverage 
the environment that technology creates to 
humanize the world of work. By recognizing the 
possibilities of that environment, organizations can 
chart a path forward to embrace one of the greatest 
paradoxes they face today: Can organizations 
remain distinctly human in a technology-
driven world?
A view that fuses the human and the 
technological—one that calls us to work with a 
world shaped by technology—can enable people 
and organizations to transcend the most 
challenging conflicts that exist in organizations 
today by making three bold shifts:
•	 Fostering belonging amid a desire for 
individuality. Technology creates a world 
where anything and everything can be 
individualized; yet humans desire a sense of 
belonging to a larger whole. Our survey results 
reinforce that belonging is a concern: Seventy-
nine percent of respondents said that “fostering 
a sense of belonging in the workforce” was 
important or very important to their 
organization’s success in the next 12 to 18 
months. What if, instead of creating divisions, 
individuality could become a source of strength 
born of bringing together unique, 
complementary abilities in the pursuit of shared 
goals? To be able to do this, organizations need 
to optimize the power of individuals by 
connecting them with each other through their 
purpose at work.
•	 Creating security in a world of 
reinvention. Technology creates the need for 
people to constantly reinvent themselves; yet 
humans still desire a sense of security. This 
year’s survey results highlight the need for 
reinvention: Fifty-three percent of our 
respondents said that between half and all of 
their workforce will need to change their skills 
and capabilities in the next three years. What if, 
instead of being perceived as a threat, 
reinvention could become the means for finding 
security in the midst of ongoing change? To be 
able to do this, organizations need to leverage 
reinvention as a way to increase their people’s 
potential for long-term success in work.
•	 Taking bold action in an age of 
uncertainty. Technology creates a sense that 
anything that can change, will; yet humans 
desire a sense of certainty to support bold steps 
forward. Here, our survey illustrates the 
uncertainty many organizations feel about their 
ability to navigate rapid change: Ninety percent 
of respondents said that the accelerating need 
for organizations to change at scale and speed 
was important to their success over the next 10 
years, yet only 55 percent felt that their 
organizations were ready to change at the scale 
and speed required. But what if, instead of 
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

12
prompting doubt, uncertainty could give rise to 
new possibilities: the opportunity to shape the 
future through decisive action? To be able to do 
this, organizations need to transform 
uncertainty into an informed perspective 
that helps them confidently navigate the future 
of work.
These three shifts represent a new set of attributes 
that characterize what it means to truly become a 
social enterprise at work (figure 1):
•	 Purpose: An organization that doesn’t just talk 
about purpose, but embeds meaning into every 
aspect of work every day
•	 Potential: An organization that is designed and 
organized to maximize what humans are 
capable of thinking, creating, and doing in a 
world of machines
•	 Perspective: An organization that encourages 
and embraces a future orientation, asking not 
just how to optimize for today, but how to 
create value tomorrow
To embody these attributes takes a high degree of 
change—one that extends beyond broad cultural 
descriptions and lofty purpose/mission statements 
to the tactical processes, programs, and structures 
that bring an organization’s culture, purpose, and 
mission to life. To help you think through these 
changes, we have used the framework of purpose, 
potential, and perspective to organize our 
discussion of this year’s human capital trends. 
These trends look across the components of an 
organization’s infrastructure—from the systems

that guide process execution to the metrics that 
track and measure strategic progress—and offer 
suggestions on ways to embed purpose, potential, 
and perspective into the very core of how they are 
designed and executed.
Purpose: Belonging 
amid individuality 
Organizations that can harness their people’s 
complementary strengths in the service of a 
common goal can benefit from diversity to drive 
higher performance. We explore three ways that 
organizations can transform individuality into 
collective value: by fostering belonging through a 
sense of contribution; by supporting worker well-
being through the thoughtful design of work; and 
by formulating workforce strategies based on a 
nuanced understanding of people’s attitudes and 
values. 
Belonging: From comfort to connection to 
contribution. Organizational efforts to foster 
belonging have primarily focused on making every 
individual feel respected and treated fairly in an 
inclusive work environment. While this remains 
critical, leading organizations are forging a stronger 
link between belonging and organizational 
performance by strengthening workers’ 
connections with their teams and fostering their 
sense of contribution to meaningful shared goals. 
When teams are united by a common purpose, 
differences in opinion on matters unrelated to that 
purpose become less relevant—and differences in 
opinion in how to achieve that purpose become 
grounds for reasonable debate rather than a source 
of divisiveness.
Designing work for well-being: Living and 
performing at your best. Worker well-being is a 
top priority today, largely because of the 
widespread belief that it supports organizational 
performance. But how can organizations take 
something as personal as well-being and translate 
it into something that can have a broader impact 
beyond the individual? We believe the answer is to 
focus on the individual in work, not just the 
individual at work. To create a sense of 
contribution that translates into true organizational 
performance, organizations should expand their 
focus from programs adjacent to work to designing 
well-being into the work itself. By doing so, 
organizations can restructure work in ways that 
help workers not only feel their best but perform at 
their best, strengthening the tie between well-being 
and organizational outcomes and fostering a 
greater sense of belonging overall.
The postgenerational workforce: From 
millennials to perennials. Organizations have 
traditionally leaned heavily on workers’ age and 
generation to inform and differentiate their talent 
strategies. But today’s workforce is more complex 
than ever, making any single demographic lens of 
limited value. Forward-looking organizations are 
shifting their approach to better understand the 
workforce’s attitudes and values. Based on these 
insights, organizations have an opportunity to 
understand individuals’ distinct characteristics to 
bring them together in ways that can promote a 
greater sense of belonging. This, in turn, can help 
workers to maximize their contribution at work, 
derive enhanced meaning in their careers, and, 
ultimately, better align themselves with the 
purpose of the organization—one that not only 
understands what they can contribute, but how 
they uniquely can do so.  
Potential: Security 
through reinvention
An organization that can help its people find 
security through reinvention can gain an advantage 
through its ability to embrace productive change. 
We highlight three areas where organizations have 
opportunities to capitalize on change: the 
integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into 
workgroups and superteams; the transformation of 
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

knowledge management through technology; and 
the cultivation of, and investment in, workforce 
resilience. 
Superteams: Putting AI in the group. Despite 
dire predictions about workers being replaced by 
intelligent machines, leading organizations are 
taking a new tack: actively searching for strategies 
to integrate AI into teams to help produce 
transformative business results. These 
“superteams” hold the promise of allowing 
organizations to reinvent themselves to create new 
value and meaning, while giving workers the 
potential to reinvent their careers in ways that 
increase their value to the organization and the 
broader talent market. 
Knowledge management: Creating context 
for a connected world. The power of people and 
machines working together offers the greatest 
opportunity for creating knowledge in human 
history. Advanced technologies are now able to 
automatically index, combine, tag, and organize 
information across multiple platforms. But to 
capitalize on these tools, organizations should also 
address the human element by creating a culture 
that helps people recognize that sharing their 
knowledge—contributing to personal and 
organizational reinvention—increases their value to 
the organization, ultimately offering them a greater 
sense of security at work. 
Beyond reskilling: Investing in resilience 
for uncertain futures. Renewing workers’ skills 
is a tactical necessity, but reskilling is not a 
sufficient path forward by itself. Organizations 
should consider an approach that treats workforce 
development as a strategy for building worker and 
organizational resilience—equipping workers, and 
thus the organization, with the tools and strategies 
to adapt to a range of uncertain futures in addition 
to reskilling them for near-term needs. Through a 
resilience lens, reinvention shifts from something 
that may threaten worker security to the very thing 
that defines it: Workers who are able to constantly 
renew their skills and learn new ones are those who 
will be most likely to find employment in today’s 
rapidly shifting job market.
Perspective: Boldness 
into uncertainty
Organizations that view uncertainty as offering 
possibilities rather than threats can position 
themselves to take decisive action to shape an 
unknown future. There are three areas where 
organizations should move boldly ahead to create a 
future in which all stakeholders can thrive: 
Compensation, where taking a human-focused 
approach can help organizations meet emerging 
challenges; governing workforce strategies, where 
asking and answering new questions can help guide 
better strategic decisions; and ethics and the future 
of work, where organizations should examine their 
actions’ ethical implications to maintain their 
license to operate in a more transparent world.  
The compensation conundrum: Principles 
for a more human approach. Considering how 
much time and money organizations spend on 
compensation strategies, processes, and programs, 
any change to compensation practices represents a 
significant decision. Yet many organizations are 
stuck in a seemingly endless cycle of compensation 
reviews, reforms, and rollouts. To take bold action 
in the face of uncertainty, organizations need a new 
path forward that is anchored not only in data and 
benchmarks, but also in a set of human principles 
that reflects the fact that compensation is more 
than a set of numbers—it’s a reflection of how 
organizations value individuals and how 
individuals value organizations. 
Governing workforce strategies: New 
questions for better results. As workforce 
strategies have evolved over the past decade, 
workforce metrics and governance have not kept 
pace. Today, organizations need forward-looking 
insights on every trend shaping human capital. 
The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

15
Organizations should begin to ask fundamentally 
new questions that can inform bold decisions 
around critical human capital risks and 
opportunities, even as uncertainty about the future 
of work, the workforce, and the workplace persists.
Ethics and the future of work: From “could 
we” to “how should we.” As the future of work 
rapidly evolves and organizations integrate people, 
technology, alternative workforces, and new ways 
of working, leaders are wrestling with an increasing 
range of ethical challenges. These challenges are 
especially pronounced at the intersection between 
humans and technology. In the face of increasing 
ethical challenges, organizations should make 
intentional and bold choices. Those choices need to 
be framed by a change in perspective: a shift from 
asking only “could we” to also ask “how should we” 
when approaching new ethical questions. 
For the last chapter of this year’s report, we address 
HR directly. As the fusion of humans and 
technology at work accelerates, the future of HR is 
one of expanded focus and extended influence. HR 
should look to broaden its focus from employees to 
the organization and to the entirety of work and the 
workforce. And HR should increase its sphere of 
influence beyond the traditional lines of the 
function to the enterprise and to the business 
ecosystem as a whole.
The attributes of purpose, potential, and 
perspective are admittedly complex. Organizations 
have tended to view the conflicts within each as 
trade-offs: belonging or individuality, security or 
reinvention, boldness or uncertainty. But part of 
embracing the seeming paradox of fusing the 
technological with the human is to look beyond 
trade-offs to find ways to integrate these seemingly 
opposed pairs. In each of the following chapters, 
we show how organizations can work within an 
environment shaped by the fusion of technology 
and people to embed purpose, potential, and 
perspective into the DNA of how they operate. For 
the power of the social enterprise lies in its ability 
to bring a human focus to everything it touches, 
empowering people to work productively with 
technology to create lasting value for themselves, 
their organizations, and society at large.

Belonging
From comfort to connection to contribution
THE READINESS GAP
Seventy-nine percent of organizations 
say fostering a sense of belonging in the 
workforce is important or very important for 
their success over the next 12 to 18 months, 
but only 13 percent say they are very ready 
to address this trend.
Current drivers
Belonging, along with well-being, is at the top of 
this year’s Global Human Capital Trends survey as 
one of the most important human capital issues. 
Seventy-nine percent of survey respondents said 
that fostering a sense of belonging in the workforce 
was important to their organization’s success in the 
next 12–18 months, and 93 percent agreed that a 
sense of belonging drives organizational 
performance—one of the highest rates of consensus 
on importance we have seen in a decade of Global 
Human Capital Trends reports.
Of course, belonging—including the sense of feeling 
respected and treated fairly—has been an 
organizational priority for some time. Promoting 
respect and fairness for all is a large part of many 
organizations’ diversity and inclusion efforts, and 
those efforts, when effective, pay off. A 2019 study 
by BetterUp found that workplace belonging can 
lead to an estimated 56 percent increase in job 
performance, a 50 percent reduction in turnover 
risk, and a 75 percent decrease in employee sick 
days. The study found that a single incidence of 
“micro-exclusion” can lead to an immediate 
25 percent decline in an individual’s performance 
on a team project.1 
Why has belonging at work become a top 
organizational priority now? Some of it is external. 
Many people feel the world is becoming less stable, 
more polarized, and more volatile. In many 
countries, political polarization, tribalism, and 
populism are on the rise.2 The World Economic 
Forum has observed increased “public frustration 
with the status quo, populist insurgencies, [and] 
the division of groups into ‘us-vs-them’” in 
countries as diverse as the United States, France, 
Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Hungary, 
Austria, Sweden, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, 
organizational efforts to foster belonging have historically and primarily focused on 
making every individual feel respected and treated fairly in an inclusive work environment. 
while this remains foundational, leading organizations are forging a stronger link between 
belonging and organizational performance by strengthening workers’ connections with 
their teams and fostering their sense of contribution to meaningful shared goals.

and others.3 A recent study of six of those countries 
uncovered that these divisions are likely “more 
than just shifts in public opinion about specific 
issues,” but instead may reflect a deepening 
distrust in society “with growing tribalism and 
intolerance of those with different beliefs and 
background.”4 These divisions may be leading some 
individuals to turn to the workplace to find the 
sense of meaning and solidarity that is often 
becoming more and more difficult to achieve with 
society at large.  
Even in the workplace, that solidarity can 
sometimes be hard to find. The Society for Human 
Resource Management’s (SHRM’s) Politics at Work 
survey found that 42 percent of US employees 
surveyed had personally experienced political 
disagreements in the workplace, and 34 percent 
said that their workplace is not accepting of 
differing political perspectives. SHRM notes that, 
while companies “can’t, and shouldn’t try to, quash 
these conversations … [they can] create inclusive 
cultures of civility where difference isn’t a 
disruption.”5
And many organizations are struggling with 
fostering belonging in a polarized world. Even 
organizations that are known for their emphasis on 
psychological safety and openness have needed to 
issue new guidelines to reduce disruptive 
workplace discussions. In one example, a company 
circulated a memo asking workers to avoid any 
conversations that might be disruptive to the 
workplace or lead to divisions among employee 
groups. The organization scaled back weekly 
meetings where employees could previously discuss 
anything—including political issues—with senior 
leaders and shifted their focus instead to monthly 
sessions focused on business strategy.
External factors aren’t all that is driving belonging’s 
importance; what’s happening within the 
organization is having an impact as well. Shifts in 
workforce composition are one growing challenge. 
With alternative work arrangements on the rise, 
many workers may not formally “belong” to the 
organization they work for—which can make it 
harder for them to feel a sense of belonging at work 
and can make it harder for people in traditional 
work arrangements to feel a sense of unity with 
them. Workplace technology is also a contributing 
force. While technology enables instantaneous 
communication with virtually anyone, the way 
people use that technology can—paradoxically—
contribute to increased feelings of isolation. Many 
virtual workers cite loneliness as one of remote 
working’s challenges.6 It’s a challenge faced by an 
increasing number of workers: In the United 
States, the number of people who regularly work 
from home has grown by 173 percent since 2005.7 
These forces are playing out against a backdrop 
where many people are working longer hours. As 
work consumes more waking hours than ever 
before, people are looking to work to provide more 
than just a paycheck. Since the Great Depression in 
the 1930s, the average American workweek has 
risen from about 35 hours to a standard 40, and 
many people log more than that:8 Workers in full-
time jobs in the United States worked just over 9.3 
The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

hours on an average weekday in 2017.9 Some 
observers note that, as working hours have 
lengthened, people are increasingly looking to work 
for personal fulfillment and satisfaction10—which 
can include, among other things, a sense 
of belonging.
Our 2020 perspective
Our view is that creating a sense of belonging at 
work is the outcome of three mutually reinforcing 
attributes. Workers should feel comfortable at 
work, including being treated fairly and respected 
by their colleagues. They should feel connected to 
the people they work with and the teams they are 
part of. And they should feel that they contribute to 
meaningful work outcomes—understanding how 
their unique strengths are helping their teams and 
organizations achieve common goals.
Our 2020 Global Human Capital Trends survey 
results offer support for this view. Twenty-five 
percent of survey respondents identified fostering

an environment where workers feel they are treated 
fairly and can bring their authentic selves to work—
comfort—as the biggest driver of belonging. 
Thirty-one percent said that having a sense of 
community and identifying with a defined team—
connection—was the biggest driver. And 
44 percent, a plurality, reported that feeling aligned 
to the organization’s purpose, mission, and values 
and being valued for their individual 
contributions—contribution—was the biggest 
driver of belonging at work (figure 1).
The progression from comfort to connection to 
contribution is an additive one, with each step 
building on the one before. Many organizations 
have already made great progress on comfort—
creating an inclusive environment where workers 
feel respected and treated fairly. Organizations that 
establish this kind of inclusive culture are twice as 
likely to meet or exceed financial targets, three 
times as likely to be high-performing, six times as 
likely to be innovative and agile, and eight times 
more likely to achieve better business outcomes.11

advancing team and organizational outcomes. To 
put it simply, they can see how what they do truly 
matters in the pursuit of common valued goals. Our 
survey results support the link between a feeling of 
contribution and a feeling of belonging: Sixty-three 
percent of our survey respondents, when asked 
how creating a sense of belonging supports 
organizational performance, answered that it does 
so by enhancing alignment between individual and 
organizational objectives. 
One example of an organization that strives for a 
culture in which everyone feels able to contribute 
to meaningful work outcomes is Alibaba. Says 
Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong: “The essence of 
Alibaba’s culture is that we have faith in each one 
of us.” Alibaba recognizes that making it safe for 
workers to express their views and opinions is the 
only way to drive the kind of meaningful 
collaboration that can translate its workforce’s 
incredible diversity into business value.13  
An appreciation of one’s contribution to the work 
can help foster belonging in a more diverse and 
even polarized world. Belonging based on 
contribution does not require people to agree on 
(for instance) their political views or conform to a 
Connection, the next step, occurs on two levels: 
when workers feel they have meaningful 
relationships with coworkers and their teams, and 
when they feel connected with the organization’s 
purpose and goals. The advent and continuing 
popularity of business resource groups—groups 
aimed at connecting and empowering people with 
similar backgrounds and social identities—is one 
example of how organizations have promoted 
stronger connections among workers. One example 
of the power of workers feeling connected with a 
broader purpose can be seen in Unilever’s “Brands 
with a Purpose” initiative, which creates products 
that are both affordable and commercially viable 
for consumers in rural villages. People working on 
Brands with a Purpose teams have the highest 
engagement scores at the company, and the brands 
themselves are growing 69 percent faster than the 
rest of the business.12 
The third step, contribution, takes comfort and 
connection still further. When workers feel a sense 
of contribution, they can not only feel respected 
and treated fairly at work and have strong 
relationships with their colleagues and teams, but 
workers can also see how their individual talents 
and efforts make a meaningful difference in 
BELONGING THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
This year’s “Belonging” chapter explores the evolution from comfort to connection to contribution— 
suggesting that workers can find purpose and value in work when they are able to identify the 
impact they are making on organizational objectives and goals. This year’s point of view builds on 
a decade of research that first showed how diversity and inclusion drive business performance in 
2011; pointed to the importance of diversity of thinking, insights, and ideas in 2013; and emphasized 
the need to combine diversity with an inclusive culture to truly drive value in 2014. Our 2017 chapter 
“Diversity and inclusion: The reality gap” reinforced the importance of connection when we wrote about 
the importance of creating diverse, inclusive teams in which people feel able to speak up and contribute 
to drive organizational performance. The move from connection to contribution, however, depends on 
another factor: meaning. In last year’s “From employee experience to human experience” chapter, we 
wrote about the importance of embedding meaning into work and enabling employees to contribute in 
the most positive, supportive, and personal ways. This year, we build on that conversation to show that 
organizations that wish to be inclusive must move beyond making people feel comfortable at work; they 
should also foster a sense of belonging by giving workers the ability to contribute in meaningful ways to 
advance team and organizational outcomes.

single cultural template. Instead, it celebrates 
individuals’ and teams’ diversity of thought in ways 
that promote their commitment to shared 
outcomes, enabling them to engage in discussions 
that consider a variety of perspectives with the aim 
of coming to an agreement. When teams are united 
by a common purpose, differences in opinion on 
matters unrelated to that purpose can become less 
relevant—and differences in opinion on how to 
achieve that purpose become grounds for 
reasonable dialogue rather than a source 
of divisiveness.
Our Global Human Capital Trends survey suggests 
that three factors most influence an organization’s 
ability to navigate the evolution from comfort to 
connection to contribution: organizational culture, 
leadership behaviors, and personal relationships 
(figure 2).

Organizational culture refers to the system of 
values, beliefs, and behaviors that shapes how work 
gets done within an organization. In a culture of 
belonging, that means an environment that 
supports all three elements of comfort, connection, 
and contribution. Workers should feel their 
perspectives are respected and valued; the culture 
should be one that encourages everyone to be 
authentic, share their diverse perspectives, and 
align to the team’s and organization’s purpose. And 
workers need clear mechanisms, such as incentives 
and peer/supervisor feedback, to show them how 
their work makes a difference in the pursuit of 
broader shared goals.
Such an organizational culture is built on 
leadership behaviors that reinforce organizational 
values of fairness, respect, and psychological 
safety on teams and inspire workers to perform at

their best. Deloitte’s “As One” research program, 
which studied the structure and productivity of 
different types of teams, found three types of team 
leaders were able to build a stronger sense of 
contribution amongst their teams: “sports team 
captains,” “community organizers,” and 
“senators.”14 Characteristically within these 
archetypes, the leaders united the teams through 
common goals rather than by top-down rules, and 
team members had the autonomy to make 
decisions and provide input instead of following a 
command-and-control structure. 
Finally, the quality of the relationships among team 
members is critical. Again, comfort and connection 
are important in facilitating contribution here. 
Teams where workers feel psychologically safe 
bringing their views to the table, and where their 
relationships with other team members are strong 
enough to allow them to do so in an assertive yet 
constructive way, will be well positioned to engage 
in productive friction—the ability to draw out 
conflict and learn from disagreements to generate 
new insights.15 
Learning by example 
Examples of organizations’ efforts around 
comfort, connection, and contribution illustrate 
the value of each of these attributes to an 
organization’s performance. The life sciences 
company Gilead Sciences recently undertook an 
effort to increase comfort among its teams in Asia, 
aiming to instill a sense of psychological safety 
where workers felt safe to speak up, make 
mistakes, and be themselves without fear of 
punishment or judgment. The company worked 
with its leaders in the region to build inclusive 
leadership skills and help them understand how 
to reduce the effects of their own status bias (such 
as by giving team members opportunities to raise 
concerns). The objective of this effort is to build a 
culture in the region where workers can feel 
empowered to respectfully challenge norms, 
allowing them to proactively rather than reactively 
identify issues and opportunities. Gilead is aiming 
for higher performance and greater innovation by 
breaking the culture of conformity and 
encouraging team members to be different and 
express divergent views.16  
Horizon Therapeutics established connection in its 
organization with a series of efforts intended to 
promote and celebrate the importance of inclusive 
thinking and actions. The company explicitly 
promotes “allyship” in the workplace by identifying 
and supporting workers who exemplify inclusive 
behaviors in their daily interactions with diverse 
colleagues and teams. Horizon looks for four 
characteristics in its allies: “Being good at learning 
and listening, feeling comfortable speaking up and 
speaking out, owning and sharing their own story, 
and modeling positive, inclusive behaviors.”17 
These efforts are paying off in terms of workplace 
culture. In addition to being recognized for several 
years as one of the “Best Workplaces in Health Care 
and Biopharma” by Fortune magazine and the 
organization Great Place to Work,18 Horizon is 
credited with creating a familial environment 
where employees feel connected to the work and

their coworkers, as well as believe they have a voice 
in decision-making.19 
Finally, the United States’ National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) continues to 
cultivate belonging based on a sense of 
contribution. Robert Gibbs, associate administrator 
for the Mission Support Directorate, told us, “From 
an astronaut to an accountant, we’re all pulling on 
the same rope, in the same direction, trying to 
achieve the same thing.”20 As it works to land the 
first woman and next man on the moon by 2024, 
NASA maintains a strong sense of mission across 
its entire workforce, even though its workforce’s 
composition includes a broadly distributed range of 
workers, including federal employees as well as a 
high percentage of contract workers, commercial 
partners, and partners from international 
cooperative agreements. NASA remains one of the 
aerospace industry’s most sought-after employers, 
and leaders attribute much of its success—and 
astonishingly low 3 percent attrition rate—to its 
ability to highlight each individual’s role in 
achieving a clear and compelling organizational 
purpose. Regardless of their job or employment 
arrangement, everyone at NASA can see how their 
individual talents contribute to their team and how 
that work, combined, moves NASA forward.21 
Pivoting ahead 
Organizations have and continue to invest 
enormous amounts of leadership focus, energy, and 
resources to ensure people feel respected and are 
treated fairly at work. Now, leaders have the 
opportunity to build on comfort to encourage 
connection and contribution as well, enabling a 
sense of belonging that can improve organizational 
performance. Implementing these types of 
belonging strategies will not be easy. It will require 
organizations to have a diversity lens to help make 
sure they are creating the opportunity for everyone 
to contribute equitably. When workers see and 
appreciate how their individual work helps to 
advance goals they support and find meaningful, 
they will likely be more engaged, more motivated, 
and more likely to perform at a high level to drive 
gains in organizational performance.

THE READINESS GAP
Well-being had the largest gap between 
importance and readiness across this year’s 
trends, with 80 percent of organizations 
saying worker well-being is important or very 
important for their success over the next 
12–18 months, but only 12 percent saying 
they are very ready to address this issue.
Designing work for well-being
Living and performing at your best
E
IGHTY PERCENT OF respondents to this 
year’s Global Human Capital Trends survey 
identified well-being as an important or very 
important priority for their organization’s success, 
making it the year’s top-ranked trend for 
importance. And it’s clear that organizations 
around the world have taken notice. Large 
employers in the United States spent an average of 
US$3.6 million on well-being programs in 2019, at 
a cost of US$762 per employee.1  The global 
corporate well-being market has grown at an 
accelerated 7 percent CAGR, and is likely to 
continue growing, rising from US$53.6 billion in 
2018 and expected to reach US$90.7 billion 
by 2026.2 
The investments made in the well-being space are 
for good reason. Ninety-five percent of HR leaders 
agree that burnout impacts employee retention,3 
and a Limeade and Quantum Workplace study 
found that employees with higher well-being are 
more likely to feel engaged at work, enjoy their 
work, and recommend their organization.4 In our 
own survey this year, 94 percent of respondents 
agreed that well-being drives organizational 
performance to some extent.
However, a closer look at our survey findings 
reveals that the return on investment (ROI) in 
worker well-being may not be as strong as it could 
be. Sixty-one percent of our survey respondents 
worker well-being is a top priority today, largely because of the widespread belief that it 
supports organizational performance. yet many organizations are missing the biggest 
opportunity for well-being to drive performance: integrating well-being into the design 
of work itself. building well-being into work takes an organization’s focus beyond 
interventions to support individual well-being to address well-being for the broader team 
and for the organization at large. by doing so, organizations can restructure work in ways
that help workers not only feel their best but perform at their best, strengthening the tie 
between well-being and organizational outcomes and fostering a greater sense of 
belonging overall.

said that their organizations are not measuring the 
impact of well-being on organizational 
performance at all, and those respondents whose 
organizations did measure well-being’s impact on 
performance were most likely to report that that 
impact lay largely in improving the workforce 
experience (figure 1). Fewer than half believed that 
their well-being strategy was positively affecting 
other business outcomes, such as the organization’s 
customer experience, financial outcomes, 
reputation, and innovation and adaptability.
Why this gap in ROI? Let’s start with the fact that 
addressing well-being effectively isn’t a simple 
undertaking. While modern well-being strategies 
have historic roots in the occupational health 
programs established in the 19th century designed 
to make work safe, they have since evolved to 
encompass a wide set of programs around workers’ 
physical, financial, and even emotional health. The 
good news is that our survey respondents have 
recognized this shift, with the majority of 
respondents indicating that their well-being 
strategies focus, at a minimum, on the physical, 
mental, and financial health of their employees 
(figure 2).
But the impact of modern careers and the rise of 
phenomena such as workplace stress have raised 
the question of whether employers should be doing 
even more. A study of workers in the United States 
and the United Kingdom found that 94 percent 
report feeling stress at work, with one-third saying 
their stress level is high to unsustainably high.5 
Fifty-four percent of workers report that their 
home life is negatively affected by work at least 
once a week, and more than 50 percent report sleep 
loss.6 This workplace stress brings physical health 
consequences as well, leading the World Health 
Organization to classify burnout “resulting from 
chronic workplace stress that has not been 
successfully managed” as a diagnosable health 
condition.7 
Given the level of the investments that are already 
being made, and the fact that 96 percent of our 
respondents agreed that well-being was an 
organizational responsibility, it’s clear that this is 
an area that needs some additional focus and 
attention. The question is: Where should 
organizations go from here?

Our 2020 perspective
Unlike in prior years of Global Human Capital 
Trends, this year, we had two trends that rose to 
the top with almost identical importance scores: 
well-being and belonging. We believe that both of 
these topics rose to the top because they pointed to 
a real challenge that many organizations are 
grappling with in the age of the social enterprise: 
How can they take something so personal and 
translate it into something that can have a broader 
impact beyond the individual?  
WELL-BEING THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
What started the decade as a concern about worker overload has evolved into a complex discussion 
about the role of organizations not only in driving well-being, but in optimizing business performance 
by integrating well-being into the design of work. In 2014, our chapter on “The overwhelmed employee” 
explored ways to improve employee satisfaction, teamwork, and productivity by simplifying work 
in an always-on world. By 2018, we had seen an explosion in the digital well-being market, with 
more than US$2 billion in venture capital invested between 2016 and 2018.8 Our chapter on 
“Well-being: A strategy and a responsibility” examined the expansion of well-being into a diverse 
set of programs designed to protect employees’ health, social well-being, and emotional well-being, 
speaking to the growing recognition of well-being as a driver of organizational performance. That 
same year, “The hyper-connected workplace” began exploring the intimate link between work and 
well-being, including management’s decision to potentially not use certain digital tools based on their 
anticipated impact on culture and pace of communication within the organization. This year, we 
discuss how building well-being into work can not only yield increased benefits in productivity and 
organizational performance, but also drive the creation of meaningful work (a call to action in last year’s 
“From employee experience to human experience” chapter) and strengthen the relationship between the 
individual and the organization.

In our chapter on belonging, we reported that our 
survey found that organizations need to foster 
belonging on three levels: comfort, where workers 
feel respected and treated fairly; connection, where 
workers have strong relationships with colleagues 
and teams; and contribution, where workers can 
see and appreciate the impact they are having on 
the organization’s goals at large. We believe there is 
an opportunity to look at well-being through a 
similar lens. While comfort has been enabled with 
a focus on occupational health and safety, and a 
connection to the workplace has been made by 
bringing a focus on life to work, contribution 
remains unresolved overall. That is because well-
being programs often focus on the individual at 
work, rather than the individual in work. To be able 
to create a sense of contribution that translates into 
true organizational performance, organizations 
need to expand their focus from programs adjacent 
to work to designing well-being into the work itself.
Redesigning work around well-being can yield 
impressive results. Microsoft Japan is an early 
example of an organization that experimented with 
this, reducing its work week from five days to 
four—with results that challenge the common 
perception that well-being and productivity are at 
odds. In addition to shortening the work week, 
Microsoft Japan changed certain aspects of the way 
its people worked: Employees were asked to use a 
digital chat tool rather than email and to limit 
meetings to just 30 minutes and five people.9
The changes that Microsoft Japan put into place 
are only one of the many ways in which 
organizations can design work for well-being. Our 
research shows that a focus on well-being can be 
achieved by making thoughtful adjustments to 
how, when, where, and by whom the work is done. 
It could mean structuring work so that 
performance does not depend on any single 
individual, making it possible for all workers and 
leaders to take meaningful leaves of absence. It can 
mean giving workers more control over when and 
where they work so that they can work at the times 
and places that they feel most productive. And it 
could mean giving workers access to additional 
human or material resources in situations where 
stressors, whether physical or mental, could 
compromise individual or team performance.
Our survey results revealed a number of different 
tactics that organizations use today to bring well-
being more to the forefront (figure 3). But despite 
the options available, relatively few organizations 
have recognized or acted upon them as part of an 
integrated strategy. Seventy-nine percent of this 
year’s respondents report that their organization’s 
strategy does not explicitly seek to integrate well-
being into the design of work—representing a huge 
missed opportunity. 
The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

39
To start the process of integrating well-being into 
the design of work, we believe there are three 
critical steps to consider. First, organizations 
should establish the right level of ownership for 
well-being—ownership by the group that has the 
greatest ability to influence the design of work. 
Second, organizations should spend the time to 
understand their workforce’s well-being needs—
starting with the organizational and HR data that is 
now at their fingertips. And third, organizations 
should put processes in place to engage employees 
in work design deliberations—recognizing that the 
more that individuals are involved in the design 
process, the greater the chance that the changes 
made will have a positive, long-lasting impact.
With regard to ownership for well-being, our 
survey responses revealed a mixed bag (figure 4). 
While HR was the most often-cited owner, 
organizations also reported ownership of well-
being by frontline managers, functional or 
department leaders, and, in some cases, even the 
C-suite. While there will never be a one-size-fits-all 
approach to ownership, our survey results show 
that ownership of well-being by HR is a solid 
strategy: When we looked at organizations that 
were more and less mature with respect to well-
being, we found that the organizations with the 
most mature well-being strategies were those 
where HR was the primary owner.10 Regardless of 
who owns well-being, it’s critical that they have the 
ability to influence the design of work as well. As 
indicated in our closing chapter—“A memo to 
HR”—we believe that the ownership of work is a 
huge opportunity for HR to expand their impact 
and shift from a focus on cultivating the talent of 
today to imagining the work of tomorrow.

With all of the HR, employee, and organizational 
data available today, there is a great opportunity to 
gain insights into workers’ needs related to well-
being and to build those needs into the design of 
work. A global footwear and apparel company did 
just that when it analyzed its global employee 
engagement survey results and recognized a 
growing need for workers to have more and better 
access to rest and recovery. In response, the 
company increased workers’ autonomy over work 
by introducing a new flexible time-off program. 
The program, which gave employees more 
jurisdiction over their work schedules, had a 
positive effect on corporate culture and improved 
collaboration and teaming across the 
organization.11
Other organizations are developing new tools to 
collect workforce well-being data. Researchers at 
the Mayo Clinic developed a Well-Being Index that 
measures multiple dimensions of well-being among 
doctors, nurses, medical students, and other health 
care workers.12 The tool, which assesses dimensions 
of distress and well-being such as likelihood of 
burnout, meaning in work, and work-life 
integration, has been used with more than 120,000 
providers, allowing organizations to improve the 
workplace based on “data, not guesses.”13 
Finally, worker input is critical to understand what 
changes to work practices may have the greatest 
impact on well-being. In Germany, labor unions 
have started to promote “health circles”

—systematic, structured workshops where workers 
discuss ways to minimize or eliminate health risks 
and other stress factors in their day-to-day work. 
These health circles are already being used in 
German governmental administration units, 
manufacturing organizations, and public 
institutions, empowering employees to redesign 
their own work to maximize both well-being and 
performance.14 In one German hospital system, 
workers’ feedback guided key work changes to 
mitigate common sources of stress, including better 
scheduling, new systems for clearer 
communication, empowering employees to make 
decisions, and changes to avoid overloading short-
staffed teams. A study found that these efforts 
improved both work quality and worker health.15 
Learning by example 
One example of an organization that has integrated 
well-being into the design of work is the early 
childhood education company Learning Care 
Group. Learning Care Group recognized a need to 
support teachers’ well-being as they handle 
stressful situations in the classroom—especially 
given that 95 percent of the behaviors that teachers 
consider to be challenging are developmentally 
appropriate.16 To do this, Learning Care Group 
implemented a series of changes—including 
changing the physical design of classrooms to 
enhance teacher-child interactions, updating the 
curriculum with new content, and offering new or 
refreshed resources to teachers—to create a more 
positive work environment. Learning Care Group 
even introduced new technologies into the 
classroom, including an app, myPath, that provides 
on-demand resources and strategies when teachers 
encounter challenging student behaviors such as 
hitting and biting. Not only have these changes 
built resilience among its teachers to handle high-
stress situations, but Learning Care Group has also 
seen lower disenrollment of children and higher 
teacher retention since making these changes.17 
Pivoting ahead
Given the immense pressure on organizations to 
promote worker well-being, it’s no surprise that 
organizations have grasped at a large number of 
levers to do so. But to date, almost all of these 
efforts have focused on the health and well-being of 
individuals, rather than the well-being of the entire 
worker population through the redesign of work. 
Organizations that integrate well-being into work 
may find that it reduces the need for remediation of 
work’s negative effects, freeing up resources to 
invest in other areas and increasing individual and 
team contributions to organizational outcomes. In 
this way, building well-being into the work 
becomes an effort that can yield immediate benefits 
in productivity while paying ongoing dividends by 
driving meaningful work, greater worker resilience, 
and higher organizational performance, setting the 
stage for long-term success.

The postgenerational 
workforce
From millennials to perennials
THE READINESS GAP
Seventy percent of organizations say leading 
multigenerational workforces is important 
or very important for their success over the 
next 12–18 months, but only 10 percent say 
they are very ready to address this trend.
Current drivers
For many years, age and generation has been a 
popular lens through which many organizations 
have viewed their workforce. More than half of this 
year’s survey respondents (52 percent) say they 
consider generational differences to some or a 
great extent when designing and delivering 
workforce programs. But as the workforce grows 
more complex, generational differences may not be 
the right anchor point. Today’s workforce spans 
five generational categories, with Generation Z, the 
United States’ largest demographic cohort at more 
than 90 million strong, about to join in.1 Only 
6 percent of our survey respondents strongly agree 
that their leaders are equipped to lead a 
multigenerational workforce effectively. This raises 
the question of whether traditional workforce 
segmentation approaches, anchored in generation, 
should remain the focus of future workforce 
strategies. 
The concept of “perennials,” first articulated by 
Gina Pell, captures the increasing importance of 
moving beyond broad demographic categories to 
understand people on a more meaningful level. As 
Pell puts it, “Perennials … describe[s] an ever-
blooming group of people of all ages, stripes, and 
organizations have leaned heavily on workers’ age and generation to help inform and 
differentiate their talent strategies. but today’s workforce is more complex than ever, 
making any single demographic lens of limited value. forward-looking organizations are 
shifting their approach in an effort to better understand the workforce’s attitudes and 
values, while harnessing technology to analyze and create new, more relevant insights 
into workers’ needs and expectations. based on these insights, organizations have an 
opportunity to design and implement workforce strategies and programs that are more 
targeted toward workers’ individual attributes. this personalization enables workers 
to maximize their contribution at work, derive enhanced meaning in their careers, and, 
ultimately, better align themselves with the purpose of the organization—one which not 
only understands what they can contribute but also how they uniquely can do so.

types who transcend stereotypes and make 
connections with each other and the world around 
them.” These are “people of all ages who continue 
to push up against their growing edge, always 
relevant, and not defined by their generation.”2
Why is generation becoming less relevant as a way 
to understand the workforce? The starting point is 
that careers have become more dynamic and 
complex, loosening the historic correlation between 
age and career progression. Rapid technological 
and organizational change means that workers 
must now reinvent themselves multiple times 
throughout their working lives; at the same time, 
the broader business culture has shifted to make it 
acceptable, sometimes even desirable, to promote 
younger individuals into leadership positions. The 
upshot is that 65-year-old interns can today be 
found working side by side with 25-year-old 
managers, calling into question the assumption 
that age is a reasonable proxy for understanding 
people’s workplace challenges and needs. 
The diminishing relevance of generation is also 
being supported by the fact that all workers are 
becoming more vocal about their needs—and those 
needs, it turns out, are more similar than many 
may have previously thought. Many preferences 
once associated with millennials—from the desire 
to work for an employer that reflects their values to 
the preference for flexible schedules—hold true 
across all generations. 
In fact, the deeper we dug into generational 
differences in our research, the more they 
disappeared. Despite the fact that 59 percent of our 
2020 survey respondents agreed with the general 
statement that generational differences were 
expanding, when we dug deeper on attributes that 
relate to careers, we found the exact opposite in 
areas such as work-life flexibility, expectations of 
loyalty and job security, and expectations of 
advancement (figure 1).
Leading generational expert Lindsay Pollak put it 
well in her 2019 book The Remix—How to Lead 
and Succeed in the Multigenerational Workplace: 
“The longer I study generations in the workplace, 
the more similarities I find in what people want out 
of work. Those fundamentals—meaning, purpose,

good leaders, professional growth—don’t change. 
What changes is how each generation expresses 
these needs and what expectations we have about 
our employers’ fulfillment of them.”3 
Compounding the diminishing relevance of 
generation is the fact that the generation that has 
been the greatest beneficiary of a generational 
focus—millennials—is often not happy at work. The 
external Deloitte Global Millennial Survey 2019 
found that 49 percent of millennials surveyed say 
they would quit their current job in the next two 
years if given the choice—the highest share in the 
survey’s history. Their reasons for wanting to quit 
ran the gamut of human capital focus areas: pay/
financial rewards (43 percent), lack of 
opportunities to advance (35 percent), lack of 
learning and development opportunities 
(28 percent), not feeing appreciated (23 percent), 
work-life balance (22 percent), boredom 
(21 percent), and culture (15 percent).4
Taken together, the evidence suggests that there 
has never been a greater opportunity to look 
beyond generation to reimagine how to segment 
the workforce for the future.
Our 2020 perspective
Developing talent strategies to suit workers’ needs 
will involve more deeply understanding workers’ 
individual expectations. This entails gaining 
complex insights into the workforce on matters 
such as their interests, values, preferences, and 
opinions. 
It’s instructive to look at the consumer product 
industry’s recent efforts around customer 
segmentation as a guide, given that workers are 
increasingly expecting their work experiences to be 
as personalized as their customer experiences. Over 
the last decade, many consumer product and retail 
companies have shifted from a heavy reliance on 
demographic information to a focus on 
microsegmentation—targeting individual 
customers at individual moments in time. 
However, as the use of microsegmentation spread, 
these companies found that microsegmentation 
alone had limited value without also understanding 
customer values and preferences.5 Leading 
organizations in this space are now experimenting 
with moving beyond microsegmentation to 
understand their customers’ underlying values—
their attitudes, opinions, and interests—to help

predict broader patterns and deliver more targeted 
and higher-value experiences.
Taking a value- or attitude-based approach to 
understanding the workforce will be a shift for 
organizational leaders, many of which, according to 
our 2020 survey, still rely largely on demographic 
indicators to inform their talent strategies. Besides 
generation, 53 percent of this year’s respondents 
said that they consider tenure and level in 
designing workforce strategies; 44 percent said 
they consider personal demographics such as 
gender, and 41 percent said they consider 
organizational demographics such as function and 
geography. Far fewer are collecting and using data 
that reflects individual behaviors and 
characteristics, even though many believe that such 
data would be valuable. For instance, 42 percent of 
respondents believed that work behaviors such as 
whether a person is a maker, a doer, or a manager 
will be most important for segmenting the 
workforce in three years—but just 27 percent said 
their organizations are currently segmenting the 
workforce this way. Similarly, 41 percent of 
respondents said that personal attributes such as 
introversion, extroversion, or propensity to be an 
individual contributor or a team player will be most 
important in three years—but just 22 percent of 
organizations are currently taking this approach 
(figure 2).
When organizations look at a broader set of 
attributes, they have an opportunity to understand 
individuals’ distinct characteristics to bring them 
together in ways that can promote a greater sense 
of belonging. Research from MetLife offers a view 
of how this can happen. MetLife identifies five 
factors that organizations should consider in 
workforce segmentation:

•	 Demographics such as age, gender, income, 
education, and life events
•	 Firmographics such as job tenure, company 
size, industry, role, and blue vs. white collar
•	 Attitudes toward life such as optimism 
toward the future, future vs. present 
orientation, orientation toward change, and 
sources of pleasure/stress
•	 Attitudes toward work such as work-life 
balance, attitudes toward retirement, and 
motivations for staying at the job
•	 Needs from employer such as career 
development support, salary, benefits, work 
culture, and work subject matter
MetLife says that segmenting based also on 
mindsets and attitudes enables a “more 
personalized, customized, and authentic” 
understanding of the workforce that can help 
leaders “focus dollars where they’re most 
impactful, because they know these programs have 
a direct emotional link to employee satisfaction.”6
So where should organizations focus this new 
segmentation? Our 2020 survey data gives us some 
clues. Based on the research, we found that 
generation is, on average, used twice as often to 
inform policies and programs related to careers 
and learning compared to areas such as 
performance management, compensation, benefits, 
and well-being (figure 3). And that tells us a lot 
about where the biggest opportunities exist.

Well-being, performance management, benefits, 
and compensation have historically been focused 
on individual needs. Because of this, generational 
perspectives have been less relevant in the design 
of these programs. On the other hand, talent 
acquisition, career development, leadership 
development, and learning, which use workforce 
groupings and assumptions about demographics in 
their design and application, have relied much 
more heavily on generational perspectives. But as 
prior common stereotypes and assumptions—such 
as that older workers want to retire as early as 
possible, people require a certain number of years 
of experience to be a leader, or workers no longer 
need to develop once they have reached a certain 
tenure—increasingly prove incorrect, the proxy of 
generation becomes less relevant in these areas as 
well, providing an opportunity for new 
segmentation strategies and greater 
personalization. 
When learning, leadership development, career 
development, and talent acquisition become more 
personal and more dynamic, their impact on 
business outcomes can be greatly enhanced. 
Imagine if, for example:
•	 Organizations designed career programs 
around work behaviors, enabling people who 
might be “makers” or “doers” (rather than 
managers) to still have robust career paths 
ahead of them. This can help organizations to 
retain their top talent at a time when the rate of 
disruption has made it more important than 
ever to retain individuals with the institutional 
knowledge to inform go-forward 
business strategies.
•	 Organizations created learning programs 
centered around workers’ learning styles and 
preferences, such as whether they learn best by 
experience, in the classroom, on their own, or in 
teams. This would enable them to develop in 
ways suited to their preferences—helping them 
to reskill and upskill faster to meet changing 
business needs.
•	 Talent acquisition programs recruited people 
based on their capabilities and attitudes toward 
work-life balance and where they are in their 
careers. This would help organizations broaden 
their talent pool by bringing in people at 
different ages and stages for different business 
and skill priorities, which is becoming 
increasingly important in today’s tight 
talent market.
THE POSTGENERATIONAL WORKFORCE THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
Over the past decade, careers have become more dynamic and complex. People are living longer 
and working longer, and the rapid pace of change in the workplace has resulted in the need 
for workers to reinvent themselves multiple times throughout their careers. A key component 
to this has been the role of older generations of workers in the workplace. In 2013’s chapter, 
“The aging workforce: Finding the silver lining in the talent gap,” we recommended that organizations 
find ways to retain mature talent that create value for the organization without creating a “gray ceiling” 
that limits advancement opportunities for younger workers. We suggested that organizations look for 
opportunities to apply principles of workforce flexibility and career customization. Five years later, in 
“The longevity dividend: Work in an era of 100-year lives,” our call to action was the same: Organizations 
had an important opportunity to engage workers across generations through the creation of meaningful, 
productive multistage and multidimensional careers. This year, we suggest that to most effectively create 
those multistage and multidimensional careers, organizations should reconsider workforce strategies 
and programs based solely on age or generation and instead consider workers’ interests, values, 
preferences, and opinions to better tailor opportunities to workers’ individual attributes. 
The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

•	 Leadership programs were organized around 
evolving individual capabilities, needs, and 
expectations, enabling more fluid movement 
across roles. This would help create the type of 
adaptable, team-oriented organization that 
aligns leaders to the way that work gets done, 
helping improve organizational outcomes and 
increase business success.
This perspective mirrors what London Business 
School professors Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott 
wrote in The 100-Year Life, where they talked 
about the move from age to stage.7 Understanding 
workers’ values, attitudes, behaviors, and 
interests—and finding cross-cutting patterns that 
identify similar groups of workers—requires a 
nuanced approach that tailors workforce strategies 
through many different lenses. It demands that 
organizations find ways to measure, track, and 
respond to individual characteristics that are 
invisible to most organizations today. And it means 
equipping leaders to manage a far more complex 
segmentation than most organizations have 
historically maintained. 
Learning by example
New research and profiling tools are disproving 
previous assumptions that certain work 
characteristics are tied to specific generations. For 
instance, enterprise software company Swarm 
Vision has created a psychographic profiler that 
can measure worker innovation talent based on 
eight skill clusters. Swarm Vision’s extensive 
research into the correlation between innovation, 
talent, and positive business results revealed an 
interesting finding—that age is not a driving factor 
of innovation scores. In fact, its research revealed 
very little (less than 5 percent) difference between 
age groups, proving that this demographic lens is 
not an appropriate proxy for understanding 
characteristics related to innovation.8 Applying a 
psychographic lens to talent in an organization’s 
workforce segments and teams and using that 
information to design new teams and upskilling 
programs could help to increase innovation output 
and ROI. 
New technologies and techniques for collecting and 
analyzing workforce data will be critical to 
understanding distinct employee archetypes. A 
global energy company provides an example of how 
advanced analytics can help organizations segment 
the workforce in different and productive ways. 
The company used unsupervised learning 
algorithms to identify unique segments in its 
leadership population, looking for meaningful 
clusters (such as leaders with deep networks, high 
adaptability, or strong analytical capability) that 
cross-cut demographic categories. The company 
then compared these clusters to its high-potential 
leadership pipeline to determine whether certain 
geographies or employee cohorts were 
underrepresented in its leadership programs.9
Pivoting ahead
In large part, the millennial generation’s views and 
expectations were what originally pushed 
organizations to focus on generation as a way of 
understanding the workforce. Ironically, that 
understanding is now leading many organizations 
to the conclusion that segmenting by generation—
or by any single demographic attribute—is an 
oversimplification. Organizations today have the 
opportunity to apply consumer marketing insights 
and data analytics to design workforce 
management practices based on a deep 
understanding of individual behaviors, values, and 
attitudes, as well as demographics and career and 
life stages. This postgenerational approach holds 
the potential for organizations to meet workers’ 
needs and expectations in ways that are more 
meaningful to them and more beneficial to the 
enterprise, paying ongoing dividends in enhanced 
engagement and performance.

Current drivers
After years of hype and speculation, AI has finally 
left the realm of science fiction to become a clear 
and present organizational priority. In our Global 
Human Capital Trends survey, 70 percent of 
respondents said that their organizations were 
exploring or using AI at some level. And in 
Deloitte’s 2020 global technology leadership study, 
more than 1300 CIOs and senior technology 
leaders said that analytics and cognitive will have 
the second-largest measurable impact on the 
organization in the next three years.1 And no 
wonder organizations are paying attention: AI is 
projected to add US$13 trillion to the global 
economy over the next decade.2
As AI enters the workforce, the critical question is 
not whether it will affect jobs, but how—a question 
that is prompting an increasing amount of 
discussion about AI’s role at work. For years, 
predictions have been grim, with headlines playing 
seemingly endless variations on “robots are coming 
for your job.”3  
Superteams
Putting AI in the group
THE READINESS GAP
Fifty-nine percent of organizations say the 
redesign of jobs to integrate AI technology is 
important or very important for their success 
over the next 12 to 18 months, but only 7 
percent say they are very ready to address 
this trend.
the wait is over: artificial intelligence (ai) is here. and despite apocalyptic predictions about 
workers being replaced by intelligent machines, leading organizations are taking a new 
tack: actively searching for strategies to integrate ai into teams to produce transformative 
business results. these “superteams” hold the promise of enabling organizations to reinvent 
themselves to create new value and meaning, while giving workers the potential to reinvent 
their careers in ways that help increase their value to the organization and their own 
employability. for organizations that still view ai mainly as an automation tool to reduce 
costs, connecting their ai initiatives with their efforts to craft more effective teams is a first 
step toward enabling humans and machines to work together in new, more productive ways.
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

56
Yet cutting costs by eliminating jobs is not the only 
path available for AI. Organizations face a 
fundamental choice: whether to use AI solely to 
automate tasks formerly performed by people, or to 
use it to assist workers as well. The good news is 
that our survey respondents are reporting that they 
are leaning toward the latter. Only 12 percent of 
respondents said their organizations are primarily 
using AI to replace workers, while 60 percent said 
their organization was using AI to assist rather 
than to replace workers (figure 1). Furthermore, the 
majority of our respondents believed that the 
number of jobs would either stay the same or 
increase as a result of AI’s use (figure 2).
The bad news is that our data is showing some 
gaps in how organizations are using AI to assist 
and augment their workforce. One is that the way 
organizations report using AI to assist workers is 
limited, focusing more on increasing consistency 
and productivity than on increasing value. More 
than half of the organizations in our survey are 
using AI mainly to help improve consistency and 
quality, and about a quarter more are using it 
primarily to boost productivity. Only 16 percent of 
respondents say that their organizations are using 
AI primarily to assist workers in developing 
insights (figure 3). 
The second gap is that organizations are not 
making enough investments in training: Only 
17 percent of respondents said that their 
organizations are making “significant” investments 
in reskilling to support their AI strategy—which 
raises the question of how these organizations 
expect to prepare their workforce for the changes in

their jobs that our respondents think AI will drive. 
Taken together, these results suggest that many 
organizations may have yet to think through the 
full implications of AI’s impact on the workforce.
Our 2020 perspective
How can organizations unlock AI’s potential to 
transform work and jobs in ways that generate 
value and net new jobs? We propose that to be able 
to do this effectively, organizations must find ways 
to thoroughly integrate AI into workplace teams. 
Integrating AI into teams is critical to creating 
value because teams are the fundamental unit in 
which most work is accomplished in today’s 
organizations. Our 2019 research revealed that 
65 percent of organizations view the shift from 
functional hierarchies to team-centric and 
network-based organizational models as important 
or very important. Those whose organizations were 
already operating in teams were seeing the 
benefits, with 53 percent saying the transition 
resulted in a significant improvement in 
performance.4 
The concept of “superjobs” offers a clue into what 
integrating AI into teams could look like. As we 
wrote last year, superjobs combine work and 
responsibilities from multiple traditional jobs, 
using technology to broaden the scope of the work 
performed. For innovators that view AI as a means 
to transform work, superjobs combine what 
humans and machines do best to improve business 
outcomes.5 At one company that employs both 
humans and robots at its warehouse-distribution

the work of Thomas Malone, the founding 
director of the MIT Center for Collective 
Intelligence, whose book, Superminds: The 
Surprising Power of People and Computers 
Thinking Together, explores how groups of 
humans and machines can work together to 
achieve new levels of intelligence.7 Malone 
summarizes his thinking on the topic with the 
phrase “from humans in the loop to computers in 
the group”: creating teams where computers and 
centers, for instance, the center manager’s role has 
evolved from simply overseeing shifts to 
determining when the people and the robots should 
hand off work to each other, which takes a different 
kind of technical and business expertise.6  
“Superteams”—combinations of people and 
machines leveraging their complementary 
capabilities to solve problems, gain insights, and 
create value—extend this concept beyond the 
individual to the group. This framing builds on 
SUPERTEAMS THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
This year’s “Superteams” trend builds on two evolutions over the last decade: the rise of teams, and the 
growing adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace. These evolutions, which are pivotal forces in 
the future of work, have set a stage on which organizations will thrive or risk being left behind in the face 
of unprecedented disruption.  
As organizations became more digital over the past decade, they faced an imperative to redesign 
themselves to move faster, adapt more quickly, facilitate rapid learning, and embrace their workforces’ 
dynamic career needs. The result was a deconstruction and redesign of organizations into networks and 
ecosystems built for speed, agility, and adaptability, as we explored in our 2016 and 2017 reports. Last 
year, in “Organizational performance: It’s a team sport,” we discussed how the shift to teams is critical 
to business performance as well—with 74 percent of our respondents saying their transition to a team/
network-based organization has resulted in improved performance. 
Artificial intelligence adoption faced a similar trajectory: What was an early concept at the beginning 
of the decade evolved into an imperative for business performance. Our 2015 chapter on 
“Machines as talent” introduced the idea that machines could be collaborators, rather than competitors, 
in the workplace. Just two years later, AI and cognitive technologies had taken hold in the workforce, 
with 41 percent of our survey respondents saying they had fully implemented or made significant 
progress in adopting cognitive and AI and another 34 percent piloting programs. However, our 2017 
report also revealed a critical gap. Despite the widespread adoption of these technologies, only 17 
percent of respondents reported that they were ready to manage a workforce with people, robots, and 
AI working side by side—the lowest readiness level that had ever been reported in our Global Human Capital 
Trends surveys. Our call to action was clear: Organizations should expand their vision of the workforce 
and redesign jobs to accommodate tasks that can be automated and outsourced and the new role of 
human skills. This discussion culminated in last year’s “From jobs to superjobs,” in which we explored the 
emergence of “superjobs” that bring together technical and soft skills into integrated roles that combine 
parts of different traditional jobs, leveraging the productivity that can arise when people work with smart 
machines, data, and algorithms. 
This year, the rise of teams and the adoption of artificial intelligence come together in our “superteams” 
discussion, which shows how putting AI onto teams can enable organizations and individuals to reinvent 
themselves and work together in new, more productive ways.

people each use their complementary strengths 
to achieve a common goal.8 
Superjobs and superteams illustrate how the 
relationship between technology and people is 
evolving from a focus on automating work to 
replace workers, to augmenting workers with 
technology to create superjobs, to collaborating 
with technology to form superteams at the group 
level (figure 4). Our contention is that, as 
organizations progress further along this spectrum, 
the degree to which technology can transform 
organizational outputs increases. At the first stage, 
substitution, the new outputs allow for reduced 
costs and improved efficiency. At the second stage, 
augmentation, a greater degree of transformation 
drives greater value and expanded opportunities, 
as well as reducing costs and improving efficiency. 
And at the third stage, collaboration, a still greater 
degree of transformation enables the work and the 
outputs to take on more meaning for workers and 
customers—as well as driving greater gains in costs, 
efficiency, and value.9 
We also believe that efforts focused on 
augmentation and collaboration can potentially 
free up much more workforce capacity than simply 
substituting intelligent machines for human 
workers, even though freeing up capacity may not 
be these efforts’ end goal. This is because effective 
augmentation and collaboration strategies use AI 
to reimagine the nature of the work rather than to 
continue doing the same old work, only with 
different actors. 
Moving from a substitution mindset toward 
augmentation and collaboration will require 
reinvention at multiple levels, both by workers and 
by organizations. Figure 5 suggests some steps that 
can help drive this reinvention at each of the five 
levels that we consider essential to effective 
teaming.10 Common across all these steps is the 
concept of creating security through reinvention:

individuals and organizations to grow in new 
directions that can make them more successful in 
the future of work.
Learning by example
Forward-thinking organizations across industries 
are showing how they are incorporating AI at each 
of the three levels of substitution, augmentation, 
and collaboration. Several utility companies, for 
instance, are exploring remote sensing, cloud, data 
analytics, and AI to fundamentally transform how 
infrastructure is managed. Remote sensing involves 
drones, helicopters, satellites, and various sensors 
to collect information on asset conditions and 
situational awareness. Compared to a manual 
FIGURE 5
Integrating AI into teams involves action across five domains
Domain
Steps toward integrating AI 
Individuals
•	 Invest in building human capabilities that are paramount when working with AI 
on teams, including critical thinking and observation, cultural sensitivity, social 
intelligence, conflict resolution, and teamwork and collaboration.
•	 Look for experiences that bring these capabilities to the forefront.
Leaders
•	 Learn to identify workers who have the right human capabilities to work effectively 
with AI.
•	 Learn how to develop new workers with these capabilities.
•	 Lead with a high degree of emotional intelligence and empathy. 
Teams
•	 Reframe teams to include both humans and machines instead of relegating either 
to the sidelines. 
•	 Improve the ability to form and disband teams composed of local talent, virtual 
talent, and AI. 
•	 Align processes and performance management to adjust for AI’s inclusion on the 
team.
Organizations
•	 Bring together the organization’s agile or other team initiatives with its AI initiatives 
to undertake transformation efforts to pursue new and better outputs. This entails 
looking beyond cost to value as the goal and deliberately adopting augmentation 
and collaboration as the means.
•	 Invest in experiential leadership development over an extended time frame to give 
leaders appropriate experiences to lead collaborative AI-human teams. 
•	 Develop a culture of doing the right thing to enhance workers’ ability to anticipate 
AI’s ethical impacts on the workplace and the organization’s customers and 
reputation.
Ecosystems
•	 Identify potential partnerships with AI vendors and talent marketplaces and 
platforms to maintain access to both the technologies and the workforces needed 
to execute the organization’s reimagined work.

infrastructure inspection process, remote sensing is 
much faster, more efficient, and data-rich. These 
massive loads of unstructured data require cloud 
and advanced data analytics for storage and 
curation. From there, AI is being deployed to 
initially augment humans in identifying defects.11 
Over time, human involvement will be significantly 
reduced while accuracy and operational efficiency 
will climb. The future of infrastructure 
management will be delivered by robots in the 
field, data analytics in the cloud, and AI embedded 
in the process. This will allow companies to refocus 
people on making better decisions faster.   
Other AI applications demonstrate the value that 
can arise from augmentation, which combines AI 
and humans’ complementary abilities. A recent

language, the organizations were able to improve 
both the job description process and the outcomes 
it drove. After adopting Textio, Procter & Gamble 
saw a 30 percent increase in its number of 
qualified applicants,15 and NVIDIA found that job 
descriptions with a Textio score of 90 or higher 
had 28 percent more women apply and were 
50 percent faster to fill.16  
In an even more striking example, DLR, Airbus, 
and IBM worked together to develop an intelligent 
robot, called the crew interactive mobile 
companion (CIMON), to team with astronauts on 
the International Space Station. Based on various 
IBM Watson™ services, the first version of CIMON 
was designed to support astronauts’ research 
experiments, saving time by finding and providing 
the correct information in the correct context to 
support their procedures. The second version, 
CIMON 2, is additionally equipped with the IBM 
Watson™ Tone Analyzer for linguistic analysis to 
detect emotions in its conversations with 
astronauts. The goal is for CIMON 2 to become a 
true companion to the crew, helping to mitigate 
phenomena such as isolation and groupthink that 
can affect people in space.17  
Pivoting ahead
We believe that organizations are at a crossroads 
with respect to AI strategy. Organizations that 
continue to manage AI and humans on parallel 
tracks will continue to be able to make moderate 
gains in efficiency, while organizations that choose 
to integrate humans and AI into superteams can 
realize much greater value by redesigning work in 
transformative ways. The second path, while likely 
more difficult, is also where the larger opportunity 
lies. Organizations that meet the challenges 
head-on and build workforce security through 
reinvention will be those that are well-positioned to 
capitalize on AI’s potential to drive enterprise value 
and create meaningful jobs.
MIT Sloan Management Review article describes 
how organizations in industries ranging from 
insurance to media to hospitality are using chatbots 
to assist customer service representatives. Often, 
this takes the form of the chatbot fielding common 
questions with well-defined answers that can be 
easily retrieved from existing databases, leaving the 
humans to deal with situations that require more 
empathy or that lack clearly codified responses.12  
But some organizations are taking chatbots beyond 
just using them to deliver rote responses. The 
marketing service company HubSpot, for instance, 
uses a chatbot to qualify leads before it connects 
potential customers with a human salesperson. 
These machine-qualified leads are 40 percent more 
likely to be willing to talk to the salesperson.13  
AI’s power to augment human capabilities is 
becoming even greater as it evolves to 
communicate with people in new ways. For 
instance, the AI-powered writing tool Textio, which 
can be built into enterprise email and writing 
programs, provides real-time data and suggestions 
to help people understand how their words will be 
perceived. Textio can also write with people. A 
human author can drop rough ideas into a Textio-
enabled program, and the software will recommend 
language to express what he or she is trying to 
say—cocreating with the human based on his or her 
ideas.14  
These new ways of interacting with AI pave the 
way to true collaboration with intelligent 
machines. For instance, some organizations are 
using Textio collaboratively within teams to 
reimagine talent acquisition and attraction. These 
organizations had found that, due to the 
collaborative process of writing job descriptions, 
final job descriptions were often written in 
ambiguous language that lost the original intent of 
the role or that reflected organizational biases and 
norms. By equipping talent and business teams 
with a Textio application that suggests new 
language and highlights biased or gendered

Knowledge management
Creating context for a connected world
THE READINESS GAP
Seventy-five percent of surveyed 
organizations say creating and preserving 
knowledge across evolving workforces is 
important or very important for their success 
over the next 12–18 months, but only 9 
percent say they are very ready to address 
this trend; this represents one of the largest 
gaps between importance and readiness 
across this year’s trends.
Current drivers
Technology is undoubtedly a big part of the 
growing need for more effective knowledge 
management. In the digital, hyperconnected era, 
organizations are collecting and generating a 
“tsunami of data,”1 but few are able to capitalize on 
its full potential. According to Statista, more than 
293 billion emails were sent and received each day 
in 2019.2 Yet according to a global survey of 1,300 
business and IT executives, an average of 
55 percent of enterprise data goes unused.3 
Technology has also spawned new ways of working 
that make the knowledge management need more 
urgent. With the explosion of workforce 
conversations on digital collaboration tools, 
knowledge no longer sits in databases waiting to be 
accessed but flows dynamically across the digital 
communications channels that now define working 
relationships. As a case in point, Microsoft Teams 
and Slack, two digital communications tools used 
in many workplaces today, report 13 million and 12 
million daily active users, respectively.4 
New ways of working have also increased worker 
mobility. Workers in both traditional and 
alternative work arrangements are moving across 
jobs, projects, teams, geographies, and 
organizations more than ever before, taking critical 
knowledge with them. In this year’s Global Human 
knowledge has been and will continue to be a key competitive differentiator when it comes 
to driving organizational performance. the power of people and machines working together 
offers the greatest opportunity for creating knowledge in human history. however, 
advanced technologies, new ways of working, and shifts in workforce composition are 
rendering traditional views of knowledge management obsolete. to capitalize on these 
changes, many organizations need to redefine how they promote knowledge creation to
help maximize human potential at work.
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

66
Capital Trends survey, 52 percent of our 
respondents said that workforce movement is 
driving them to proactively develop their 
knowledge management strategies. And 35 percent 
said that the frequent shifting of which people are 
in what roles at what time is a barrier to effective 
knowledge management.
And yet, despite an acknowledgment that the ways 
in which work is happening have shifted, many 
organizations’ approaches to knowledge 
management have not kept pace. Our survey shows 
that almost half of the respondents do not provide 
members of the alternative workforce access to 
knowledge-sharing tools and platforms, and only 
16 percent see integrating knowledge management 
across off- and on-balance-sheet workers as a key 
factor to consider in proactively developing their 
knowledge management strategies. In a world 
where the use of the gig economy continues to 
expand, this could become a significant barrier to 
creating knowledge in the future. 
Our 2020 perspective
Our research this year shows that many 
organizations remain focused on—and struggle 
with—the basics of knowledge management. More 
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
Knowledge management has evolved in leaps and bounds over the last decade with the emergence of 
new technologies that capture and disseminate information at rapid speeds. Our Global Human Capital 
Trends reports have reflected that journey, acknowledging the importance of employee knowledge-
sharing to business success in 2014, discussing the development of internal knowledge-sharing programs 
in 2016, and marking the emergence of new learning and knowledge-sharing systems in 2018 that curate 
both internal content and open-source content for worker use and development. In 2019, our top-ranked 
trend was “Learning in the flow of life,” in which we discussed the shift from knowledge-sharing and 
learning as something that happens separately from work to something that is integrated into workflows 
in small doses, almost invisibly, throughout the workday. This year, we build on that perspective, 
describing ways that organizations should leverage new technologies that can not only contextualize 
information, but push it through an organization’s systems to teams in ways that support problem-
solving and help workers innovate and uncover new insights.
The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

than half of the respondents to this year’s Global 
Human Capital Trends survey (55 percent) still 
define knowledge management as the simple 
documenting and disseminating of knowledge. Far 
fewer link knowledge with action to drive value 
(36 percent), while less than half (43 percent) see 
creating knowledge as a key to developing new 
products, services, or solutions (figure 1).
The overwhelming majority of organizations 
understand they are falling short. Eighty-two 
percent of our respondents said their organizations 
need to do a better job of tying knowledge to action, 
while 79 percent admitted that they must be more 
effective at creating knowledge to jump-start 
innovations and launch new products and services. 
For organizations that are struggling, the good 
news is that technology is offering up solutions that 
can help. Emerging AI capabilities such as natural 
language processing and natural language 
generation can automatically index and combine 
content across disparate platforms. These same 
technologies can also tag and organize information, 
automatically generating contextual metadata 
without human intervention and eliminating a 
major barrier to actually using the knowledge that 
an organization’s people and networks create. And 
in the most advanced applications, AI technologies 
can take that contextualized information and push 
it to an organization’s different teams and systems, 
allowing the intelligence to flow through networks 
of people as they work to uncover insights and 
solve problems in real time.
Microsoft’s Project Cortex, for instance, uses AI to 
analyze large amounts of content, organize it into 
different topics, extract important information, and 
create “knowledge networks” that connect people 
with topics and content.5 A worker who sees an 
unfamiliar project in an email can access a “topic 
card” that describes the project, relevant experts 
and people, related resources, and other useful 
information. Cortex also enables workers to create 
personalized “knowledge centers,” where they can 
keep abreast of trending topics that are relevant to 
their work.6
In this way, technology becomes embedded into 
the organization’s teams in ways that help advance 
their collective intelligence—an example of “putting 
computers in the group” to create what we call 
“superteams.”7 As a key application of superteams, 
knowledge management is evolving far beyond an

internal database that workers occasionally visit to 
look for information. Instead, it connects all of an 
organization’s different teams, systems, and 
networks, elevating and honing everything the 
organization does. It proactively pushes the right 
information to the right person at the right time, 
and it accelerates learning by automatically 
delivering the expertise that people need to be able 
to develop key skills and capabilities. 
As one example, Philips has launched a new 
knowledge management platform as part of its 
effort to transform from a product-based company 
to a solution-based company, aiming to save 
workers’ time and break down silos across its 
nearly 80,000 workers, 17 markets, and more than 
30 businesses. The platform’s tagging mechanisms 
easily connect workers with articles, white papers, 
tips and tricks, public communities, and experts 
based on their specific interests and needs. This 
delivers huge time savings: Account managers and 
sales engineers now spend fewer hours per week 
searching for information.8 
Honda took a similar approach in 2019 when it 
worked to better understand driver behavior in an 
effort to improve the driver experience. By using an 
AI tool called Watson Discovery from IBM Watson, 
Honda was able to create new knowledge from 
analyzing complaint patterns from drivers, 
enabling engineers to respond to quality challenges 
in vehicles more efficiently. This improved not only 
their own work experience, but the experience of 
Honda’s customers as well.9
Many organizations may need to solve technical 
challenges to seize the opportunity to put 
“computers in the group” for knowledge 
management. Thirty-six percent of our survey 
respondents said that the lack of an adequate 
technology infrastructure constrains knowledge 
management at their organization. And nearly 
seven in ten (67 percent) of our survey respondents 
have yet to incorporate AI into their knowledge 
management strategy beyond a limited extent 
(figure 2). 
Yet while the lack of technology infrastructure was 
noted as a common barrier, it was only one of the 
top barriers to effective knowledge management. 
The other barriers identified in our 2020 survey 
focused not on the technological, but instead on the 
human side of the knowledge management 
equation (figure 3). Barriers such as organizational 
silos (55 percent), lack of incentives (37 percent), 
and lack of an organizational mandate (35 percent) 
point to the fact many organizations need to do 
more than provide the infrastructure to share and 
create knowledge; they need to redefine the value 
associated with it as well.
In a world where knowledge equals power, many 
workers feel that holding on to their specialized 
knowledge allows them to safeguard their worth. 
To combat this, organizations can cultivate an 
ethos that helps people recognize that sharing their

knowledge makes them more relevant, not less. 
Sodexo, for instance, worked to build an 
organizational culture that recognizes the value of 
knowledge-sharing. They launched a digital 
campaign to encourage their nearly 500,000 
employees to join active knowledge-sharing 
communities and encouraged participation by 
marketing the importance of the communities, 
measuring usage, and recognizing active users. To 
further embed the knowledge-sharing mindset in 
their organization, Sodexo integrated its knowledge 
communities into other organizational systems to 
make them easily accessible through daily 
workflows. Their efforts are already paying off. 
Neta Meir, Sodexo’s digital and innovation HUB 
director, reported that Sodexo is already seeing 
“more and more adoption of new behaviors, like 
sharing, collaborating, and consuming knowledge.” 
Meir said, “I do believe that we are in the right 
direction to break silos, work more collaboratively, 
and perform better as [our employees] understand 
that knowledge-sharing is power.”10
An effective knowledge management approach can 
give workers a larger platform to build on each 
other’s knowledge and expertise, helping to 
increase a worker’s value to the organization and 
ultimately offering them a greater sense of security 
at work. In a world where innovation and growth 
depend on synthesizing information and finding 
patterns that no single human eye can see, job 
security and organizational status come from one’s 
contributions to personal and organizational 
reinvention—not from keeping information siloed 
for individual use only. Some organizations are 
accelerating the process of breaking organizational 
silos by leveraging organizational network analysis 
to identify topics and experts in an effort to better 
understand how they interact with one another. 
Doing so allows organizations to generate 
conceptual knowledge networks that help them 
visualize the knowledge hubs within their 
organization.11

Learning by example
Our survey’s knowledge management leaders12 
differ from the rest of our respondents in several 
ways, most notably in their definition of knowledge 
management. These leaders view knowledge 
management as more than a way of capturing and 
disseminating information; instead, they view it as 
a way of creating knowledge to develop new 
products, services, or solutions. By redefining the 
value of knowledge management, these 
organizations are able to break down cultural 
barriers that have prevented other organizations 
from taking a similar path.
Philips, for example, did not just use knowledge 
management to reduce the time it took account 
managers and sales engineers to search for 
information. It leveraged a knowledge management 
ecosystem to create new ways of engineering 
solutions for its customers. This shift in focus 
occurred when leaders realized that opportunities 
were lost by not sharing new services and solutions 
across markets. A service might be successful in the 
United States while account managers in Europe 
were not aware about its existence and success. 
Despite the fact that knowledge about Philips 
products was available on the company’s internal 
sites, the company did not have a way of 
embedding that knowledge at the right point in its 
engineering process. Now, at the start of any new 
project, engineers check the knowledge 
management site, which uses AI to immediately 
search for other projects that may be similar and 
connect the individuals running those projects. 
Instead of duplicating efforts, those teams can 
collaborate up front, creating new knowledge and 
ultimately getting their innovations to market 
faster.13 
A leading biopharmaceutical company took a 
similar approach. It used knowledge management 
to extract the lessons learned from the multiple 
early-stage trials that their products went through, 
combining those lessons into new knowledge that 
would enable the company to advance its solutions 
to market in a more effective way. This was quite a 
challenge in an organization where information 
had historically been shared on a need-to-know 
basis only. But by taking a step back to understand 
how and where knowledge could be pushed to 
create value, the company was able to break down 
those cultural norms.14 
Pivoting ahead
Rapid technological advances have poised 
knowledge management to evolve from a static, 
back-office activity focused on documenting and 
warehousing information to a dynamic, 
AI-powered platform that enables organizations to 
create, understand, and act on knowledge more 
effectively than ever before. To be able to take 
advantage of these emerging technologies, 
organizations need to marry two critical elements: 
the physical systems and infrastructures to support 
the technology, and the processes, incentives, and 
culture that encourage people to use it. 
Organizations that succeed on both fronts will be 
well positioned to create and act on knowledge in 
ways that drive tangible results.

The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

73
Current drivers
Organizations are struggling to navigate the fast-
changing skills landscape. In our 2020 Global 
Human Capital Trends survey, 53 percent of 
respondents said that between half and all of 
their workforce will need to change their skills and 
capabilities in the next three years. It will be no 
easy feat for organizations to navigate this 
explosive rate of change effectively. They are up 
against a dramatically changing business 
landscape with constantly shifting skills and 
capability needs, greater expectations of 
organizations to respond to workforce 
development needs, and a lack of insights and 
investment to pave a clear path forward. 
Today, the qualities that workers—and 
organizations—need to survive and thrive are very 
different from those they needed in the past. One 
reason for this is that economies are shifting from 
an age of production to an age of imagination. In 
the past, business success relied mainly on 
deploying precisely calibrated skills to efficiently 
construct products or deliver services at scale. 
Today, success increasingly depends on innovation, 
entrepreneurship, and other forms of creativity 
that rely not just on skills, but also on less 
quantifiable capabilities such as critical thinking, 
emotional intelligence, and collaboration.1 
Beyond reskilling
Investing in resilience for uncertain futures
THE READINESS GAP
Seventy-four percent of organizations say 
reskilling the workforce is important or very 
important for their success over the next 
12–18 months, but only 10 percent say they 
are very ready to address this trend.
reskilling alone may be a strategic dead end. renewing workers’ skills is a tactical necessity, 
but reskilling is not a sufficient path forward by itself. the skill shortage is too great. 
the investments are too small. the pace of change is too rapid, quickly rendering even 
“successful” reskilling efforts obsolete. what is needed is a worker development approach 
that considers both the dynamic nature of jobs and the equally dynamic potential of 
people to reinvent themselves. to do this effectively, organizations should focus on 
building workers’ resilience for both the short and the long term—a focus that can 
allow organizations to increase their own resilience in the face of constant change.
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

74
Amid this pressure to adapt their business models 
to capitalize on the age of imagination, 
organizations are also facing pressure from their 
workforces to help them keep their skills and 
capabilities up to date. Seventy-three percent of 
our survey respondents identified organizations as 
the entity in society primarily responsible for 
workforce development—outranking the 
responsibility of workers themselves, and far 
exceeding the deemed responsibility of educational 
institutions, governments, or professional 
associations and unions (figure 1). In light of this 
expectation, there is growing scrutiny and societal 
pressure on organizations to address workers’ long-
term employability2—with the potential for 
significant backlash when they lay off workers after 
automating their jobs. 
Yet despite the expectation of organizations to do 
more to address skills and capabilities shortages, our 
survey shows that most organizations do not have 
the insights they need to get started. Fifty-nine 
percent said they need additional information to 
understand the readiness of their workforce to meet 
new demands, and 38 percent said that identifying

moderate investments in reskilling or no 
investment at all as it relates to AI, one of the 
biggest areas of reskilling required. And 32 percent 
of our respondents identified lack of investment as 
the greatest barrier to workforce development in 
their organization. 
Given these findings, the fact that most of our 
respondents—75 percent—expected to source new 
skills and capabilities primarily by reskilling their 
current workforce seems unlikely to play out 
exactly as planned.
Our 2020 perspective
How can organizations find a way to navigate this 
radically changing business and skills 
environment? We suggest an approach that treats 
workforce development as a strategy for building 
worker and organizational resilience—equipping 
workers, and thus the organization, with the tools 
and strategies to adapt to a range of uncertain 
workforce development needs and priorities is their 
greatest barrier to workforce development. With 
jobs becoming increasingly dynamic, the skills 
landscape is shifting drastically and rendering 
exercises to define needed skills of limited use and 
longevity. Not surprisingly, only 17 percent of our 
survey respondents believed that their organization 
could to a great extent anticipate the skills their 
organizations will need in three years. 
Even if organizations acquire the information 
needed to better understand workforce 
development priorities, our survey shows that 
many organizations will face another barrier: 
difficulty obtaining the necessary investments. 
While 84 percent of respondents agreed that 
continual reinvention of the workforce through 
lifelong learning is important or very important to 
their development strategies, only 16 percent 
expect their organization to make a significant 
investment increase in this area over the next three 
years. In fact, 68 percent of our survey respondents 
told us that they are currently making only 
TIPPING POINT
In the past year, the skills race has jumped into the spotlight as both a business imperative 
and a social expectation. Organizations including Deloitte,3 Accenture,4 IBM,5 JPMorgan Chase,6  
PricewaterhouseCoopers,7 and SAP8 announced major worker skilling investments in 2019. 
Perhaps the most publicized of these efforts has been Amazon’s pledge of US$700 million to upskill 
100,000 of its US workers by 2025. The program reflects Amazon’s ongoing commitment to building 
resilience in its workforce through a variety of programs that offer opportunities for different workforce 
segments, technical groups, and communities. Some of the programs, including Amazon Technical 
Academy, Associate2Tech, and Machine Learning University, target the development of technical skills 
for in-demand jobs, helping to keep workers current in both the theory and application of emerging 
technologies. In addition, Amazon is also helping workers find adjacent or related roles in their 
communities. The company offers a prepaid tuition program, Career Choice, that supports fulfillment 
center associates looking to move into high-demand occupations. Since 2012, 25,000 workers have 
used this program to launch new careers in aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, machine tool 
technologies, medical lab technologies, nursing, and other fields. Amazon workers who participate in 
the program are rewarded with an immediate pay bump and see longer-term benefits in both earnings 
and career mobility. The Career Choice program is also contributing to the health of the broader 
ecosystem by introducing new career pathways and building talent pipelines for local in-demand roles, 
resulting in greater local business growth, increased household incomes, and a higher average wage in 
local communities.9

Based on this year’s Global Human Capital Trends 
survey, we see five areas where organizations can 
challenge their thinking to build resilience (figure 
2). These shifts capture how organizations can 
think about what their workers should be learning 
(cultivating capabilities and engaging in unseen 
and future problems), how they should be learning 
(in the flow of work and motivated by rewards), 
and where they should be looking to apply what 
they learn (future opportunities both inside and 
outside the organization).
futures in addition to reskilling them for near-term 
needs. Through a resilience lens, reinvention shifts 
from something that could threaten worker 
security to the very thing that defines it: Workers 
who are able to constantly renew their skills and 
learn new ones are those who will be most able to 
find employment in today’s rapidly shifting job 
market. 
Investing in worker reinvention may feel risky to 
organizational leaders who worry that their newly 
reskilled workers will walk out the door, but that 
need not be the case. The effective social enterprise 
recognizes that key to success are the capability 
and viability of the workforces available to it, and 
its attractiveness to new workers and alumni across 
its entire internal and external ecosystem. An 
organization that helps its workers become more 
resilient can be an attractive employer indeed—one 
that is well positioned to compete for both existing 
and new talent.
RESKILLING THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
Our calls early this decade for organizations to focus on talent development have evolved into a full-
blown business imperative for those hoping to survive in an age of constant disruption. In 2013, we 
wrote about how the talent management pendulum was swinging from recruitment to development. 
Our chapter on “The war to develop talent” talked about how global talent shortages, escalating turnover 
costs, and workers’ desire for lifelong development were putting a spotlight on how organizations 
designed talent networks, planned for workforce development, built learning programs, and developed 
leaders. By 2014, workforce capability was becoming an increasingly more critical issue, with 75 percent 
of our survey respondents rating it as urgent or important, but only 15 percent believing they were ready 
to address it. In “The quest for workforce capability,” we called attention to the need for organizations to 
create a global skills supply chain to examine expected capability gaps at all levels and develop workforce 
capabilities using a systematic, continuous process rather than as a “one and done” annual event. We 
reaffirmed that theme in our 2015 and 2016 reports, which focused on learning as a key vehicle for 
organizations to obtain badly needed skills. By 2017, a trend was emerging that would define the late 
decade of reskilling: the declining half-life of skills. In “Careers and learning: Real time, all the time,” we 
wrote that “the concept of career is being shaken to its core” by the simultaneous increase in the length 
of careers and the decline in the half-life of skills. This dichotomy between the length and dynamic nature 
of jobs has continued to sharpen, leading us to ask this year’s critical question: How can organizations 
increase their own resilience and their workers’ resilience in the face of constant change?

Building skills
Cultivating 
capabilities first, 
skills second
Our survey respondents are split 
on this topic, with 48 percent saying 
that their workforce strategy is 
anchored upon hiring people with 
technical skills needed for jobs 
today, versus 52 percent saying 
their strategy is to hire great 
learners who can develop to meet 
multiple positions and future needs.
In an environment of constant 
disruption, a focus on capabilities 
gives organizations greater 
flexibility to meet both today’s 
and tomorrow’s needs. Over time, 
capabilities will help individuals 
continuously develop the skills 
to remain relevant, helping 
organizations continue to develop 
the workforce they need. A focus 
on capabilities is increasingly 
important as technology 
demonstrates the ability to do work 
often associated with technical 
skills.

Leveraging 
workers’ 
“passion of the

engage them in 
solving unseen

problems
Our survey clearly highlights 
workers’ desire to learn and 
grow. Fifty-four percent of our 
respondents believe individuals 
are responsible for their own 
workforce development—putting 
workers in the driver’s seat to own 
their careers. And organizations 
acknowledge that lack of workforce 
interest is not a barrier to 
workforce development. In fact, 
lack of workforce interest was 
the least commonly cited barrier, 
with only 19 percent of our survey 
respondents identifying it as an 
issue.
Organizations should be 
encouraged by research that shows 
that the workforce is often far 
more adaptable than management 
believes and, in many cases, can 
sense disruptive forces sooner 
than senior leaders. By exploring 
new domains and learning from 
others both within and outside the 
organization, workers can identify 
gaps and reinvent themselves to fill 
them—reducing the need for top-
down mandates.

methods
Supporting 
learning in the 
flow of work
In last year’s Global Human Capital 
Trends report, we called out 
learning as the top-rated challenge 
for organizations. This year, it 
continues to be a major concern, 
with 92 percent saying they will 
prioritize learning in the next 3–5 
years but only 61 percent feeling 
ready to meet the challenges 
associated with it. We believe this 
gap can largely be attributed to 
many organizations’ inability to 
meet workers in their place and 
time of need.
Research shows that learning 
through experience yields better 
learning gains and retention than 
traditional classroom instruction. 
Organizations should work to 
provide workers with guidance 
and information in the flow of their 
work and look for opportunities 
to help workers learn through 
experiences.

investments and rewards are not 
usually structured to support long-
term organizational goals. Only 45 
percent of our survey respondents 
said that their organizations reward 
workers for developing skills 
and capabilities. Even fewer, 39 
percent, are rewarding leaders for 
developing skills and capabilities on 
their teams.
Given the importance of continual 
reinvention to an organization’s 
business strategy, organizations 
need to create incentives that 
motivate people to continuously 
learn, adapt, and improve, both at 
the individual level and the team 
level.

Learning by example
While not every organization may use all five of 
these tactics at once, some have already begun the 
journey to building resilience by distinguishing 
themselves as leaders in one or more areas.
Some organizations are shifting their focus from 
building skills to cultivating capabilities first. Latin 
American pharmaceutical company Megalabs, for 
instance, offers workers the opportunity to attend 
leadership academies to develop future-focused 
capabilities such as risk-taking and innovation to 
support leaders’ preparedness, agility, and 
responsiveness for the future of work.10 In another 
example, Banco Santander undertook a robust 
strategic workforce planning exercise to identify 
the skills the bank will need in 2025. Doing so 
required envisioning future roles and tasks, 
identifying the skills needed to execute those roles, 
and quantifying the future demand for each skillset 
by analyzing expected business and talent trends 
(such as the growth of digital business and the 
impact of AI technologies). This exercise revealed 
that Santander’s workforce had the strong technical

Forty-six percent of our 
respondents agree that the

all stakeholders, including the 
communities that organizations 
serve and society at large.
The most effective organizations 
will employ an approach to 
workforce capability building that 
considers not only their business 
needs but the needs of the workers, 
customers, and communities 
in which they operate. This will 
especially be true as workforce 
compositions continue to shift 
and organizations need to rely 
more on the health of their overall 
ecosystem.

skills required to meet future demand but needed 
to focus on building capabilities such as 
communication, knowledge-sharing, and resilience. 
Throughout this process, the involvement and 
collaboration of the C-suite as champions of the 
project was key to its success, ensuring alignment 
with critical business needs. The bank launched an 
upskilling and reskilling plan to cultivate the 
required skills and critical capabilities and has 
activated strategic levers across HR to close these 
gaps (mobility, alternative workforce, and ways of 
working). The expectation is that cultivating these 
capabilities will not only prepare its workforce to 
better serve its customers, but also transform the 
company’s culture and ways of working.11  
American Water is piloting a leadership program to 
develop capabilities essential for being a leader in 
the “age of disruption” such as innovating, 
problem-solving, and leveraging diversity of 
thought and ideas. During the program, 
participants are challenged with identifying 
problems and collaboratively developing solutions 
to address issues they are facing in their daily jobs. 
So far, employees have been very engaged in the 
The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

program and have generated several forward-
thinking ideas and potential work improvements.12 
Other organizations are using experiential learning 
to help their people learn in the flow of work. A 
global petrochemical company is one such 
example. It developed an internal repository to 
help surface and develop workers’ skills that were 
previously invisible to the organization. The 
repository connects employees to projects across 
the enterprise, allowing them to dedicate a portion 
of their time to new activities to build on existing 
skills or to develop skills in particular interest 
areas. Initial indications by employees in the pilot 
group have been very positive, especially by late-
career employees who were looking for variety in 
their daily work.13 
Organizations can reward workers for developing 
capabilities in a variety of ways. Some, for instance, 
are working with companies such as Guild 
Education to offer workers debt-free pathways to 
pursue degrees, certificates, and the option to 
receive school credit for on-the-job training. Guild 
Education connects employers to a network of 
educational institutions to enable workers engaged 
in training to earn credits toward professional 
certifications from nonprofit accredited 
universities. This allows workers who undergo 
training to be more successful in their current jobs 
while simultaneously helping them to gain a 
nationally recognized credential they can take 
anywhere. In one year at Walmart, 6,000 
employees earned a total of US$17.5 million worth 
of college credits while paying only a little more 
than US$500,000.14 Guild cites a US$2.44 return 
on investment for every US dollar spent:15 At 
Chipotle, employees who participate in Guild’s 
education benefits program have a 90 percent 
higher retention rate and are more likely to be 
promoted.16 
Finally, two organizations provide examples of how 
leaders can shift their approach to training from an 
internal focus to an external, ecosystem one. US 
home improvement retailer Lowe’s, for instance, is 
deliberately aiming to support the health of its 
broader ecosystem through its training program. 
With the growing deficit of skilled trade 
professionals in its industry, Lowe’s offers 
apprenticeship opportunities to customer-facing 
floor staff to help them launch careers in carpentry, 
plumbing, electrical, HVAC, or appliance repair. 
This program provides upfront tuition funding for 
trade skill certification, academic coaching and 
support, and placement support for Lowe’s 
nationwide contractor network.17 And in another 
example, Canadian bank RBC is working to grow 
the skills of its enterprise, community, and society. 
After commissioning a study that found that 4 
million of the Canadians projected to enter the 
workforce over the next decade were not equipped 
with the right skills and capabilities for in-demand 
careers, RBC created a career tool called “Upskill” 
that identifies a young person’s career-relevant 
skills, points him or her to personalized career 
options, and offers customized guidance that 
integrates data on job demand, projected growth, 
automation impacts, and earning potential. 
Pivoting ahead
We believe that organizations may be ill served by 
the currently prevalent narrow approach to 
reskilling, which consists largely of attempting to 
precisely tally current skill needs, prescribing 
discrete training programs to suit, and then doing 
it all over again once the organization’s needs 
change. A system that instead invests not just in 
workers’ near-term skill needs but also in workers’ 
long-term resilience, developing their capabilities 
as part of work and embracing a dynamic 
relationship with the organization’s broader 
ecosystem, can help build long-term organizational 
resilience as well. In a world where the only 
constant is change, supporting workers in 
reinventing themselves offers organizations a 
sustainable path forward as they aim to equip their 
workforces to do the work of today—and the future.

The compensation conundrum
Principles for a more human approach
THE READINESS GAP
Sixty-nine percent of organizations say 
the changing nature of compensation 
expectations and strategies is important or 
very important for their success over the 
next 12–18 months, but only 9 percent say 
they are very ready to address this trend. 
Current drivers
Compensation—salary and wages—is the largest 
component of an organization’s total labor costs,1 
accounting for up to 70 percent of an organization’s 
total costs.2 And yet many organizations seem 
curiously uncertain about how to approach this 
significant area of spend. In our 2020 Global 
Human Capital Trends survey, most respondents 
said that their organizations were either in the 
middle of redesigning compensation or had 
changed their compensation strategy within the 
last three years (figure 1). What’s more, 64 percent 
of respondents expected their organizations to 
redesign compensation yet again either this year or 
in the next three years. 
Despite these continual efforts, our recent High-
Impact Rewards study confirmed business 
executives’ general dissatisfaction with 
compensation, as it garnered an incredibly low net 
promoter score: negative 15—the second-lowest 
score for any HR-related practice in any prior study 
by our research group, exceeded only by 
performance management at negative 60.3 
The uncertainty about how best to approach 
compensation and the lack of positive results is not 
surprising, given the rapidly evolving environment 
rapid changes in the nature of work are adding new demands and pressures on 
compensation strategies and programs. as a consequence, many organizations are stuck 
in a seemingly endless cycle of compensation reviews, reforms, and rollouts. to take bold 
action in the face of uncertainty, organizations should look beyond compensation as a 
“spot market”—focused on rewards to drive talent acquisition and retention—to viewing 
it as a lever to manage the biggest shifts happening in today’s work environment, including 
changes in the way work happens, the evolving expectations of the workforce, and the 
expanded role of organizations as they become social enterprises. to do this effectively, 
organizations must focus on a core set of human principles that will enable them to craft 
compensation strategies designed to stand the test of time in the new world of work.
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

that compensation strategies need to address. To 
start is the change in radical shift in work and jobs. 
Not only is the “half-life” of individual skills 
diminishing, but entire roles are also changing as 
work is being redesigned to integrate human 
workers with robotics and AI. The World Economic 
Forum estimates that 42 percent of the skills 
required from the global workforce will change 
between 2018 and 2022, and that by 2022, no less 
than 54 percent of all employees will require 
significant reskilling and upskilling.4 Our own 
analysis of 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Occupation Employment Survey data suggests that 
as many as one-half to two-thirds of jobs across 
industries are ripe for disruption in the future of 
work.  
Another big shift is the desire for greater 
transparency that is raising pressure on 
organizations as it relates to their compensation 
practices. A poll of workers in the United Kingdom 
found that 56 percent would support making their 
income and tax return information publicly 
available.5 And across the Atlantic, drivers for 
major ride-sharing companies launched strikes 
across the United States to lobby for better pay 
transparency.6 Such calls for greater transparency 
reflect a growing sentiment that organizations 
should bear greater responsibility for answering 
questions about whether compensation works—and 
for whom.
Compensation fairness is another significant 
challenge in the era of the social enterprise. As the 
inequality gap widens,7 external stakeholders are 
zeroing in on compensation, taking some 
organizations to task for failing to pay a living 
wage.8 Compensation also remains a focus point to 
help address potential workplace bias and improve 
diversity-related outcomes. New research draws a 
direct connection between perceptions of 
compensation fairness and employer brand, 
employee engagement, and workforce well-being. 
One study of workers in Sweden finds that 
perceived fair treatment led to higher employee 
motivation and healthier lifestyle decisions.9 
Another study in the United States reports that 
women experiencing compensation inequity were 
twice as likely to suffer from depression and four 
times as likely to suffer from generalized anxiety.10

COMPENSATION THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
Issues around compensation, rewards, and performance management—and the relationship 
among the three—appear to be a perennial challenge for HR and organizational leaders. 2014’s 
“Performance management is broken” and 2015’s “Performance management: The secret ingredient” 
suggested that organizations decouple performance management from compensation, focusing 
performance management on coaching and improvement while basing compensation on a worker’s 
skills, their value to customers, and real-world market conditions. In spite of this suggestion, 
organizations’ rewards practices generally remained “stuck in the past,” as we wrote in 2018’s 
“New rewards: Personalized, agile, and holistic.” In 2019, we highlighted the continuing gap between 
current rewards practices and internal and external expectations in “Rewards: Closing the gap,” 
encouraging leaders to view compensation and rewards in the context of cultivating lasting relationships 
with workers. This view of compensation as an essentially human activity continues to inform this year’s 
discussion, as we examine how viewing compensation from the perspective of the social enterprise’s five 
human-focused design principles can help organizations meet emerging challenges in this area.
To navigate these challenges effectively, 
organizations need a new path forward that is 
anchored not only on data and benchmarks, but 
also on a set of principles that reflects the fact that 
compensation is more than a set of numbers—it’s a 
reflection of how organizations value individuals 
and how individuals value organizations. 
Considering how much time and money 
organizations spend on compensation strategies, 
processes, and programs—and the total cost of 
wages and salaries—any change to compensation 
practices represents a significant decision that 
needs to put the human element front and center to 
have the desired impact.
Our 2020 perspective
To move beyond the compensation conundrum—
the continual reconfiguring and tinkering with 
rewards packages of compensation, incentive pay, 
and benefits—in 2020 and beyond, business 
leaders and workers have the opportunity to 
reinvent compensation for a world of changing 
jobs, work, skills, and expectations and values. As a 
starting point for compensation’s reinvention, we 
return to the five principles for human design we 
introduced in last year’s Global Human Capital 
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

Our perspective
Purpose and meaning
Value individual 
contributions
Eighty-seven percent of our respondents 
reported that valuing workers’ individual 
contributions is important or very 
important, yet only 57 percent said that 
their organizations were effective or very 
effective at it. This was the single biggest 
gap identified as it relates to driving 
belonging in an organization.
With belonging rising to the top as one 
of this year’s most important trends, it’s 
critical that a compensation strategy 
be effective at valuing individual 
contributions. Contribution—along with 
comfort and connection—is integral to 
establishing belonging and, ultimately, to 
aligning an individual to an organization’s 
purpose.
Transparency and openness
Enable two-way input
Fifty-eight percent of our respondents 
reported that the workforce has 
little to no input in the organization’s 
compensation strategy, with 24 percent 
reporting that workers have no input at 
all.
In a world that has seen continued 
growth in the power of the individual 
to affect organizations’ reputation and 
brand and a rise in individuals sharing 
information traditionally kept private, 
it is important to establish processes 
that not only enable transparency in 
the distribution of information, but also 
allow for an open feedback loop from the 
impacted individuals.
Ethics and fairness
Reward for expanded 
and changing 
responsibilities
Forty-six percent of our respondents 
reported that changes in jobs were not 
aligned with changes in compensation, 
and only 22 percent said that the 
increased use of automation and AI was 
one of the top three factors affecting their 
compensation strategy.
With automation and AI rapidly changing 
the nature of jobs, fairness can be 
determined based on how those shifts 
in role and responsibility are reflected 
in an individual’s pay. This will demand 
a more agile process for evaluating job 
changes and rewards in tandem and with 
increased frequency.
Trends: Purpose and meaning; transparency and 
openness; ethics and fairness; growth and passion; 
and collaboration and personal relationships. 
We used this year’s survey data to evaluate 
organizations’ approaches to compensation against 
these principles. What we found was a series of 
gaps between how compensation is designed and 
executed today—gaps that we believe hinder an 
organization’s ability to align compensation to the 
new world of work. To help organizations address 
them, we have proposed actions aligned with each 
of the five principles that we believe are mutually 
beneficial, enabling organizations to reward their 
workers in meaningful ways and transform that 
meaning into quantifiable value (figure 2). These 
actions offer organizations an enduring foundation 
in which to ground their compensation strategies 
to break the endless cycle of compensation 
redesigns as changes in jobs and work continue 
to emerge.

distributive fairness
Our respondents identified fairness 
of pay as the second most common 
ethical concern related to the future of 
work, second only to the maintenance of 
privacy and control of workers’ data.
Technology has brought an increased 
focus on ethics at work; as the topic of 
ethics continues to permeate discussions 
of future of work, it is important for 
organizations to have a consistent 
approach for how compensation is 
applied (procedural fairness) as well as a 
process for ensuring that work outcomes 
are rewarded consistently (distributive 
fairness) across all workforce segments.
Support a living wage
Less than 10 percent of our respondents 
believe that fairness of compensation 
related to a living wage is a top priority 
for the workforce. This reveals a critical 
gap between what our respondents 
believe and what the broader stakeholder 
community is calling for.
As the social enterprise takes hold, 
organizations may be measured on more 
than just shareholder value, but also 
on their impact on society as a whole. A 
broader set of stakeholders—including, 
but not limited to, employees—will likely 
have an increased focus on whether all 
workers are provided with compensation 
that maintains socially acceptable living 
standards. 
Growth and passion
Pay for skills 
acquisition and 
development
Forty-three percent of our survey 
respondents view and evaluate 
compensation, benefits, and skill 
development separately; only 45 percent 
of our survey respondents reward 
workers for the development of new 
skills.
In a world of work where at least half the 
workforce will likely require significant 
reskilling and upskilling, organizations 
are missing a huge opportunity if they do 
not find a way to partner with workers 
to incent skill development—one of the 
most significant issues and potential 
barriers in the achievement of future 
business strategies.
Incent entrepreneurial 
behavior
Only 34 percent of our respondents 
reward workers for entrepreneurial 
behavior, despite 84 percent saying 
that supporting the development of 
human capabilities such as problem-
solving, communication, and creativity 
was important or very important to their 
workforce development strategy.
Deriving new value and meaning from 
work can be achieved when workers have 
the freedom and incentive to provide 
entrepreneurial and innovative ideas to 
how work can be done in the future.
Collaboration and personal relationships
Reward at the team 
level
Only 37 percent consider team-based 
work in their compensation strategies. 
Only 39 percent of our respondents 
reward leaders for developing skills for 
their teams.
With a growing percentage of work in 
most organizations today being done in 
teams, the ability to set goals, motivate, 
develop, and reward at the team level is 
paramount to incenting behaviors that 
align with how work actually gets done.

2017, a global audit against this framework 
discovered that 7,252 employees in 37 different 
countries were paid below the living wage specified 
by the framework. The company immediately 
responded, slashing this number to 611 employees 
in 16 countries by the end of 2018.12
Some organizations are taking transparency and 
openness even further through a process that 
focuses on collaboration. UK-based financial 
services company GrantTree enables its employees 
to set their own salaries through an iterative, 
collaborative process. Employees must make a case 
for their proposed salary, gathering information on 
the market rate for similar positions, their 
performance and growth, and what the company 
can afford to pay. Their colleagues then review the 
proposal, ask questions, and provide feedback, and 
the employee then chooses a salary level. While it 
might be expected that people would choose the 
highest possible compensation, at least two 
GrantTree workers have chosen to voluntarily 
reduce their salaries after their responsibilities 
changed.13 
Pivoting ahead
Organizations are engaged in a constant cycle of 
adjusting and readjusting their compensation 
strategies in efforts to align compensation with 
changing talent and business challenges. We 
believe that this is because many are redesigning 
compensation in a reactive manner without basing 
their strategies on enduring principles that speak 
to the challenges organizations face today. 
Designing compensation this way can help 
organizations navigate an uncertain environment 
and make bold and effective forward-looking 
choices.
By considering these principles, an organization 
can evaluate its compensation practices for its fit 
with worker needs, its efficacy in supporting goals 
such as worker development and marketplace 
competitiveness, and its sustainability with respect 
to broader social norms and expectations. The 
desired end result: a compensation strategy that 
improves an organization’s ability to accomplish its 
objectives while meeting stakeholder needs and 
expectations in a more transparent world.
Learning by example
A few examples show how some organizations are 
applying parts of the human-focused design 
principles to compensation. One example can be 
found in IKEA’s efforts to equalize wages, benefits, 
and experience for its part- and full-time workers 
in Japan. Previously, local regulations required 
part- and full-time workers to have different 
compensation and benefits structures—but this 
presented challenges to IKEA’s operations, as the 
company relies on a large share of part-time 
workers. In response, IKEA engaged Japan’s 
government to improve the legal status and rights 
of part-time employees, leading to landmark 
legislation that enabled equal benefits for all 
Japanese workers. As a result of making changes 
consistent with the new law, IKEA significantly 
reduced turnover and received recognition as an 
Employer of Choice.11 
As another example, Unilever explicitly made 
fairness and transparency key components of its 
global compensation strategies. It developed a 
“Framework for Fair Compensation” in 2015 in an 
effort to make pay transparent, fair, consistent, and 
explainable, based on a robust process for auditing, 
benchmarking, and setting performance targets. In

The social enterprise at work: Paradox as a path forward

91
Current drivers
The demand for new workforce insights is 
reaching new heights, and it is nearly universal. 
Ninety-seven percent of respondents to this year’s 
Global Human Capital Trends survey said that 
they need additional information on some aspect 
of their workforce. Despite the fact that our report 
has issued a call to action on people analytics 
since 2011, only 56 percent of respondents to this 
year’s survey said that their organizations had 
made moderate or significant progress in this area 
in the past 10 years. And while 83 percent of 
respondents said that their organization produces 
information on the state of their workforce, only 
11 percent of organizations produce the 
information in real time; 43 percent said they 
produce it either ad hoc or not at all. 
The pressure to generate deeper insights about the 
workforce often starts at the highest levels: More 
than half of our survey participants (53 percent) 
reported that their leaders’ interest in workforce 
information has increased in the past 18 months. 
The desire for better workforce metrics spans a 
diverse set of needs that mostly focus on the future, 
with information on the readiness of the workforce 
to meet new demands the clear leading priority 
(figure 1).
Governing workforce strategies
New questions for better results
THE READINESS GAP
Seventy-one percent of organizations say 
governing changing workforce strategies is 
important or very important for their success 
over the next 12 to 18 months, but only 8 
percent say they are very ready to address 
this trend.
as workforce strategies and operations have evolved over the past decade, many 
workforce metrics and governance have not kept pace. today, new metrics are needed 
to enable forward-looking insights on every trend shaping human capital if leaders 
are to gain the perspective they need to be able to anticipate and meet the challenges 
posed by today’s rapidly changing environment. organizations must begin to ask 
fundamentally new questions to find relevant, actionable workforce metrics that can 
inform bold decisions around critical human capital risks and opportunities, even as 
uncertainty about the future of work, the workforce, and the workplace remains.
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

92
Several factors from both inside and outside the 
organization are driving the surge in demand. 
There is increasing uncertainty about the future 
within many organizations. One key driver of this 
uncertainty is the rapidity with which skills become 
obsolete due to technological and economic 
change. As the “half-life” of skills decreases, the 
need for a more dynamic view of the workforce has 
increased. Another source of uncertainty is the 
pace at which the nature and composition of teams 
are changing. As organizations begin to redesign 
work by integrating technology into teams, they 
will need to understand the implications for team 
members and leaders alike in terms of their skills 
and development needs. 
This internal uncertainty is being matched by 
external pressures as well. As human capital–
centered issues—culture, inclusion, leadership 
behavior, the treatment of workers—become 
more transparent, their potential for affecting an 
organization’s brand and financial value has 
increased. In the past year alone, billions of 
dollars’ worth of valuation have been lost 
because of issues related to leadership and 
culture. Relying on lagging indicators for these 
types of issues has proven ineffective; investors, 
boards, and organizational management are 
looking for predictive metrics to help them gauge 
and guard against risks that may be growing 
underneath the surface.

This desire for deeper insights has reached the 
point where some regulators are starting to 
mandate greater disclosure on the state of an 
organization’s human capital. Organizations have 
generally been slow to publish detailed information 
on their human capital operations beyond 
headcount and compensation. Now, regulators 
such as the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) are responding with proposed 
revisions to current business disclosure 
requirements in an effort to incorporate more 
human capital–related information.1 Companies 
seeking to enhance how they measure and report 
on human capital may look to leading frameworks 
such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) standards. As these pressures 
continue to increase, it is critical that organizations 
update the metrics that are governing human 
capital in today’s disrupted world.
TIPPING POINT
In the past year, two key regulatory actions have put a spotlight on the growing demand for better 
information on organizations’ human capital practices. The SEC has proposed modernizing Regulation 
S-K, which would require public companies to report on a wider set of human capital information such 
as retention and turnover, productivity, incentives for innovation, and training costs.2 And the SASB 
Foundation is currently working on a project to assess the prevalence of financially material human 
capital topics such as labor practices, employee health and safety, and employee engagement, diversity, 
and inclusion across SASB’s sectors and within its 77 industries.3 The SASB aims to create a market-
informed and evidence-based framework that identifies the financially material impacts of relevant 
human capital management issues, which will enable the assessment of these themes on an industry-
by-industry basis.4

WORKFORCE METRICS THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
Developing a predictive view of human capital is the next step in the evolution of people analytics 
that has been gaining momentum over the past decade. Our inaugural report in 2011 exhorted 
organizations to “move beyond instinct, gut, and tribal wisdom in making workforce decisions,” 
pointing out that organizations not using data and analytics to manage their talent risked losing 
their competitive edge. 2012’s “Seeing around corners,” 2013’s “Thinking like an economist,” 
and 2014’s “Talent analytics in practice” continued to track organizations’ sometimes halting 
progress toward developing robust people analytics capabilities—which, as we described in 
2015’s “People data everywhere,” were beginning to be augmented by the availability of external 
as well as internal organizational data. By 2018, organizations’ increasing sophistication in people 
analytics was enabling them to do far more with their data, prompting us to caution readers, in 
“People data: How far is too far?,” not to neglect the ethical and security concerns related to the 
expansion of worker data and analytics. But people data, as we discuss in this year’s chapter, 
can only get organizations so far if they fail to ask the right strategic questions. The challenge for 
organizations today: to find new questions and new workforce metrics that can illuminate a path 
forward for leaders in an uncertain world.
that are critical to an organization’s success in the 
future of work. This suggests that many 
organizations may not be focusing their workforce 
data collection efforts where they could be 
most effective.
What is needed to make progress? Many survey 
respondents believe the biggest barrier is technical: 
52 percent said that the lack of systems to produce 
data prevents them from getting the information 
they need to understand the workforce moving 
forward. However, this perception may not be 
accurate. More than 130 providers offer access to 
externally available HR data,5 and technology has 
enabled organizations to collect more workforce 
data than ever before. Organizations looking to 
better understand their employer brand can draw 
new insights through technologies, including those 
that scrape employee review data, analyze trends in 
hiring and attrition, or assess the language used in 
external communications for potential biases. 
Organizations hoping to understand the 
effectiveness of their workforce initiatives can use 
new organizational network analysis tools to help 
understand workforce connections and sentiment 
analysis tools to help understand worker attitudes. 
And new technologies can support reskilling efforts 
by helping organizations baseline the skills in their 
workforce today (by augmenting internal employee 
data with externally available data) and understand 
their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to 
competitive advantage. 
We believe the core issue is actually foresight and 
creativity, not technology. Many organizations are 
stuck in outdated ways of thinking, recycling the 
same old metrics that have been around for years. 
The challenge is not getting the data but finding the 
right strategic questions to ask. 
To identify metrics that can govern and guide 
21st-century workforce strategies, organizations 
need to determine what questions can help them 
navigate the future effectively, not just more fully 
report on the past. We give a sampling of these 
kinds of questions in figure 3—questions whose 
answers can empower leaders to meet 
uncertainty head-on with insights that can 
inform decisive action.

FIGURE 3
Asking different questions can help leaders anticipate future needs and risks
What organizations 
should be asking
What they can gain from the answers
Workforce footprint: How 
many workers provide direct 
or indirect services to our 
organization?
As more work is being done in nontraditional ways, organizations should 
look beyond employees and contractors to gain a full view of the workforce. 
Some organizations today struggle to provide even a credible number of 
total full-time employees, which will shift from being a nuisance to a critical 
risk as workforce composition becomes more complex.
Workforce social contract: 
How does our organization 
treat its employees, 
contractors, and service 
providers of every type? 
Anyone who is connected to an organization can have an impact on its 
organizational and employment brand. Gathering data to understand issues 
around fairness and equity can help leaders be deliberate about how every 
segment of the workforce is being treated.
Retention drivers: Which 
workers are at risk of leaving, 
and why?
Worker exits have traditionally been analyzed on a person-by-person basis 
through exit surveys or similar mechanisms. Looking at trends across 
workers, and asking them questions before they leave, can help identify 
broader issues that may not only drive attrition but could hurt a company’s 
brand if not proactively managed.
Job evolution: How often are 
jobs changing, which ones, 
and to what degree?
The pace and scale of changes to jobs across the organization is one way to 
understand how fully technology is being integrated into work. If jobs are 
not changing significantly, then it is possible that new technology is not being 
used, or if it is, that jobs are not being reconfigured to take full advantage of 
it. 
Future workforce 
readiness: How ready is our 
workforce to perform the 
work of the future? What are 
our capability, experience, 
and skill gaps, 
and how are we going to 
close them? 
Finding metrics to gauge future workforce readiness can help leaders 
articulate what the work of the future will look like and what mix of skills will 
be needed to do it. This can help organizations develop possible strategies 
around alternative talent models, short- and long-term learning spend, and 
the thoughtful redesign of work to pursue better outcomes. 
Future leader readiness: 
What new trends, challenges, 
and scenarios are leaders 
being prepared for? How 
many of our leaders have 
the attributes required to 
succeed?
Traditional succession planning processes tend to assume that future 
leadership roles and organizational structures will stay static. Looking 
instead at metrics that evaluate future leaders’ agility and adaptability can 
help organizations measure their readiness for multiple possible futures.
Change ability and agility: 
Are workers and leaders able 
to quickly and effectively 
adapt to constant change?
Organizations, leaders, teams, and workers need the ability and the mindset 
to manage constant change. This is a shift from moving from one steady 
state to another steady state, to adopting approaches for dynamic and 
ongoing change.
Internal talent market 
health: How healthy is our 
internal talent market?
Just as with external talent, viewing internal talent as a market can suggest 
leading indicators of organizational adaptability, collaboration, and agility. 
Organizations with healthier internal talent markets will likely be better 
positioned to weather uncertainty than organizations that rely too heavily on 
external talent sources. 
Talent ecosystem health: 
How much capability can we 
access across our broader 
ecosystem?
Ecosystems provide avenues to hard-to-find capabilities. Leaders who 
understand how their organizations are collaborating with vendors and 
other key ecosystem partners can evaluate how effectively the organization 
taps into capabilities across the ecosystem in noncompetitive ways.

What organizations 
should be asking
What they can gain from the answers
Meaningful diversity: 
Are workers from diverse 
communities in a position 
to wield influence in the 
organization? 
Organizations often fail to understand whether they are diverse in word or 
in actual practice. Metrics that show the extent to which diverse workers are 
in a position to exert both formal and informal influence can provide a clear 
answer—as well as illuminate whether diversity is really creating competitive 
advantage through the embrace of diversity of thought. 
Culture risk sensing: What 
signals are we seeing that 
point to outliers in worker 
behaviors and norms? 
Most organizations can identify and address events that stem from bad 
worker behavior, but few monitor their worker base for signals that point to 
deeper root causes. With better information, organizations can move toward 
diagnosing and addressing the root causes of bad behavior, reducing the risk 
of repeat challenges.
Human capital brand: How 
is our culture, workforce, and 
leadership being portrayed 
externally? 
Today, data is readily available from sources outside the organization to 
provide a view into what is happening inside. Leaders who track this external 
data to help diagnose potential issues can help shape a positive human 
capital brand for the organization. 
Source: Deloitte analysis.
Learning by example
Early signs suggest that organizations using 
forward-looking workforce metrics are reaping 
benefits. The leading organizations on workforce 
metrics in our survey,6 which are about twice as 
likely as the rest to report on issues such as talent 
mobility, learning investments and progress, new 
workforce initiatives, and critical roles, are also 
more likely to say they are effective at anticipating 
both internal and external changes that will affect 
their workforce (figure 4).
Note: Figures represent the percentage of respondents who said their organizations were “eﬀective” or “very eﬀective.” 
Mature organizations were deﬁned as those whose respondents said that their organizations collected information on the 
status of reskilling. Only respondents who indicated that their organizations collected information on the state of their 
workforce answered this question.

In some cases, organizations may develop 
specialized metrics to help better understand 
specific aspects of the workforce. For example, 
Ageas, an international insurer, has created 
innovative ways to measure executives’ readiness 
to lead technology transformations. First, the 
company established a technology readiness index 
framework to quickly assess their leaders’ 
technology readiness and abilities. Then, it created 
a 10-minute assessment, the “technology quotient 
scan” (TQS), that produces individualized reports 
for each leader detailing their technology “hot 
spots,” providing personalized learning 
recommendations, and recommending content to 
deepen their expertise. At the enterprise level, 
Ageas uses TQS data to understand their 
workforce’s overall digital readiness in each 
division or region, identifying where they are most 
prepared to adopt new technologies.7 
Organizations can also enhance workforce insights 
by combining data from various sources. At 
Lufthansa, for instance, the workforce 
transformation team developed a workforce 
readiness “radar” that integrates traditional HR 
data, future of talent data, and future readiness 
skills data. The radar, which shows which jobs are 
more or less likely to be affected by digitization, 
offsite or hybrid work, or new contract types, 
allows the team to visualize which departments and 
functions are most likely to experience disruption, 
which enables the company to prioritize future of 
work planning and transformations. In a successful 
pilot implemented in its revenue steering 
department, Lufthansa used the underlying data to 
optimize job descriptions for future needs and 
establish plans for workforce reskilling.8
Finally, the most advanced organizations are 
pairing new technologies with data and analytics 
expertise to look at human capital information in 
new ways. Mastercard, in an industry known for its 
advanced analytics expertise, recognized that it 
could benefit from integrating its people analytics 
teams with its broader organizational capability to 
stay on top of emerging analytics trends. To this 
end, the company has developed new partnerships 
between its strategic workforce planning and 
people insights team and other parts of the 
organization. In one example, the people analytics 
team worked with the company’s AI Garage team 
to analyze more than 17,000 performance review 
development cards. The resulting insights helped 
inform Mastercard’s skills taxonomy and helped 
leaders better understand strengths and 
development areas in different workforce 
segments, guiding more focused talent acquisition 
and upskilling strategies. Mastercard’s ability to 
leverage its broader analytics expertise in its 
approach to human capital management has 
allowed it to better understand the organization’s 
human capital “health” and, by moving from 
descriptive to predictive and prescriptive analytics, 
respond and react to cultural signals more 
effectively. This in turn has helped Mastercard’s 
leaders enhance both the organization’s readiness 
for action and its external employer brand.9 
Pivoting ahead
Over the last decade, the conversation on HR data 
and analytics has expanded to include internal and 
external data, privacy and ethical concerns, and a 
range of workforce issues that are essential for 
boards and C-suites to understand. This year, the 
bar has been raised once again. The road ahead 
includes a focus on technology, but it also includes 
an enhanced focus on foresight, creativity, and how 
organizations manage the use of data to develop 
future-oriented, actionable workforce insights. The 
imperative is clear: To make bold choices today, 
leaders need to understand what the future may 
hold through metrics that can help them anticipate 
risks, inform strategy, and prepare for the future of 
work, the workforce, and the workplace.

Ethics and the future of work
From “could we” to “how should we”
THE READINESS GAP
Seventy-five percent of organizations say 
ethics related to the future of work are 
important or very important for their success 
over the next 12 to 18 months, but only 14 
percent say they are very ready to address 
this trend.  
Current drivers
Ethical concerns are front and center for today’s 
organization as the nature of work, the workforce, 
and the workplace rapidly evolve. Eighty-five 
percent of this year’s survey respondents believe 
that the future of work raises ethical challenges—
but only 27 percent have clear policies and leaders 
in place to manage them. And managing ethics 
related to the future of work is growing in 
importance: More than half of our respondents 
said that it was either the top or one of the top 
issues facing organizations today, and 66 percent 
said it would be in three years.
When we asked our respondents what was driving 
the importance of ethics related to the future of 
work, four factors rose to the top: legal and 
regulatory requirements, rapid adoption of AI in 
the workplace, changes in workforce composition, 
and pressure from external stakeholders (figure 1).
The leading driver that respondents identified was 
legal and regulatory requirements. Given that there 
is often a lag in laws and regulations relating to 
both technology and workforce issues, this 
perception is surprising. Granted, there has been 
as the future of work rapidly evolves, and organizations are integrating people, 
technology, alternative workforces, and new ways of working, leaders are wrestling 
with an increasing range of resulting ethical challenges. these challenges are especially 
pronounced at the intersection between humans and technology, where new questions 
have risen to the top of the ethics agenda about the impact of emerging technologies on 
workers and society. how organizations combine people and machines, govern new human-
machine work combinations, and operationalize the working relationship between humans, 
teams, and machines will be at the center of how ethical concerns can be managed for 
the broadest range of benefits. organizations that tackle these issues head-on—changing 
their perspective to consider not only “could we” but also “how should we”—will be well 
positioned to make the bold choices that help to build trust among all stakeholders.

some activity on this front within the European 
Union: In February 2019, the European Parliament 
adopted a resolution framing European industrial 
policy on AI and robotics, aiming to encourage the 
establishment of laws that would promote “ethical 
by design” technologies.1 There has also been some 
state and city legislation in the United States, 
including California’s 2019 law requiring hiring 
entities to treat gig workers as employees instead of 
contractors.2 However, outside a few moves such as 
these, policy changes have been slow in coming.
The pressure on ethics created by the rapid 
adoption of AI in the workplace, however, is much 
more understandable. AI and other technologies 
make ethics in the future of work, specifically, more 
relevant because the proliferation of technology is 
driving a redefinition of work. Perhaps the issue 
that has attracted the most attention in this regard 
is the question of how technology affects the role of 
humans in work. While our survey found that only 
a small percentage of respondents are using robots 
and AI to replace workers, headlines of the 
forthcoming “robot apocalypse” continue to 
capture global attention and raise concern. 
Organizations that are implementing technologies 
that drive efficiencies can expect to make decisions 
whether and how to redeploy people to add 
strategic value elsewhere, and what, if they decide 
to eliminate jobs, they will do to support the 
workers thus displaced.
As technology becomes more embedded into work, 
its design and use needs to be assessed for fairness 
and equity. Organizations should consider 
questions such as whether their applications of 
technology decrease or increase discriminatory 
bias; what procedures they have to protect the 
privacy of worker data; whether technology-made 
decisions are transparent and explainable; and 
what policies they have in place to hold humans 
responsible for those decisions’ outputs.3 
The third driver of ethics’ importance in the future 
of work cited most often by respondents is 
changing workforce composition, which raises

issues about the evolving social contract between 
the individual and the organization and the 
organization and society. The growth of the 
alternative workforce is one major phenomenon 
contributing to these concerns. The number of self-
employed workers in the United States is projected 
to hit 42 million this year,4 and in Britain, the gig 
economy has more than doubled from 2016 to 2019 
to encompass 4.7 million workers.5 “Invisible labor 
forces” are being exposed in the recent research by 
Mary Gray and Siddarth Suri’s Ghost Work: How 
to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global 
Underclass, which talks about the unsavory 
working conditions of many workers performing 
the high-tech piecework (e.g., labeling data, 
captioning images, flagging X rated content, and so 
A RED FLAG ON THE ALTERNATIVE WORKFORCE
Our 2020 Global Human Capital Trends survey revealed a critical concern: Organizations may be failing to 
recognize the importance of alternative workers, even as this workforce segment rapidly grows. Twenty-
five percent of organizations consider the treatment of alternative workers as a top ethical concern. Just 
21 percent of organizations say their well-being strategy includes alternative workers. And when it comes 
to how the changing nature of work affects compensation strategies, only 13 percent of respondents 
expect growth of unregulated work to have the most impact, and only 21 percent expect the growth of 
the alternative workforce to have the most impact.
In this year’s survey, in looking ahead at the next 10 years, 80 percent of respondents rated “the radical 
shift in work, careers, and jobs due to AI and new employment models,” as important. But only 45 
percent of respondents said they are prepared for this shift—the lowest preparedness score for any of 
the issues we surveyed as emerging challenges in the next 10 years.
In last year’s report, we called for organizations to shift from a transactional view of the use of the 
alternative workforce to a holistic and strategic approach that can access and optimize this critical and 
growing source of talent. This year, we warn organizations not to overlook this growing portion of the 
workforce, which is critical to talent strategies. The ability to effectively tap into the alternative workforce 
can help organizations access scarce capabilities in rapidly changing work and job markets. Just as 
important, an organization’s approach to alternative workers can have a positive (or negative) impact on 
employment brand. 
Considering that one in five of our respondents said that they expect alternative work models will have 
the greatest impact on HR models in the next 12–18 months, this is an area where leaders will likely need 
to focus more attention.
on) that powers automation and AI.6 The fast 
growth of this workforce segment is calling to 
attention related ethical concerns, including 
alternative workers’ access to fair pay, health care, 
and other potential benefits. 
The final major driver of ethics’ importance in the 
future of work is that organizations are facing 
pressure from customers, investors, and other 
external stakeholders to act responsibly on ethical 
issues, even those that do not affect business 
operations—including issues such as access to 
health care, rising inequality, and climate change. 
Organizations are being called upon to address 
these challenges from a future-of-work perspective 
by designing work in innovative ways that can help 
ameliorate related concerns. 
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

104
What is also interesting is that one major 
stakeholder group, the board of directors, is not 
generally weighing in on these issues, as only 
12 percent of our respondents felt that board and 
C-suite pressure was driving a focus on ethics in 
the future of work. This finding is somewhat 
worrisome, as boards and leaders must set the right 
“tone at the top” for organizations to make ethics in 
the future of work a priority.
Our 2020 perspective
These drivers are shaping a number of specific 
ethical challenges related to the future of work, 
which can suggest an actionable agenda for 
addressing these issues. Yet respondents also 
overwhelmingly indicated that their organizations 
were not ready to manage these ethical challenges, 
with only between 8 and 19 percent saying their 
organization was “very ready” for any given issue.
A closer look at our respondents’ views on 
organizational readiness reveals an interesting 
insight: Organizations are the least prepared to 
handle ethical dilemmas in areas where humans 
and technology intersect. By far, the most 
organizations reported they were prepared to 
handle the technology-focused issue: maintenance 
of privacy and control of workers’ data. Next came 
issues that are distinctly human, such as fairness of 
pay, the design of jobs for sustainability, and 
treatment of alternative workers. But in matters 
where humans and technology converge—
automation, use of AI, and use of algorithms—
many organizations appear woefully unprepared 
(figure 2).
We believe this gap has much to do with the 
broader tendency for organizations to treat 
technology and humanity as distinct paths with 
their own programs, processes, and solutions. Now, 
as boundaries blur between humans and machines, 
organizations are not ready to address the two 
paths together. These questions at the intersection 
of humanity and technology—how individuals are 
being monitored, how decisions are being made on 
their behalf, or how their jobs may be affected or 
ETHICS THROUGH THE YEARS IN GLOBAL HUMAN CAPITAL TRENDS
Over the past decade, HR and organizational leaders have increasingly grappled with tough ethical issues 
posed by the future of work. Our 2011 discussion on “Leading in a regulated world: All risk, all the time” 
explored ethics in the context of risk management, discussing ways that organizations could give workers 
a clear process for raising ethical concerns and create a culture that supports ethical behaviors. By 2019, 
leaders were taking a much broader perspective on ethics, with 37 percent of our survey respondents 
worried about their organizations’ ability to create trust with stakeholders, and 60 percent worried 
about their workers’ perception of organizational transparency. This year’s ethics discussion extends the 
conversation even further, challenging leaders to consider a new perspective that allows them to resolve 
seeming trade-offs related to the intersection of humans and technology at work.

eliminated—are very personal. And once the 
challenges become personal, organizations are 
finding themselves unprepared to meet them.  
In the face of increasing ethical challenges, we 
believe that organizations must make intentional 
and bold choices. Those choices should be framed 
by a change in perspective: a shift from asking only 
“could we” to also asking “how should we” when 
approaching new ethical questions. By considering 
the broader implications of and an expanded focus 
on how to integrate teams, people, and technology, 
organizations can evolve an ethical approach to the 
future of work that goes beyond an assessment of 
technological feasibility to consider technology’s 
impact on humans and business results.
In figure 3, we show the power of this shift in 
perspective as it relates to the three areas where 
organizations were “least ready” to address ethical 
concerns in this year’s survey.

Could we ...
 How should we ...
… reduce labor costs by extensively 
implementing automation and 
AI across the organization and 
replacing workers?
… take into account that automation with a focus solely on cost savings 
will almost always lead to headcount reduction? Many organizations fail 
to consider the potential individual and societal implications of these 
reductions, which can be especially significant for populations that have 
historically been relied on to provide low-cost labor. And yet, automation 
can also make work safer and less tedious. Are there ways to implement 
automation that reduce costs while preserving affected workers’ 
livelihood and dignity?
Deeper dive
Automation initiatives can often disproportionately affect underrepresented minorities. For example, while 
women make up only 47 percent of the US workforce, they make up 58 percent of workers at the highest risk of 
losing their jobs to technology. Hispanic women tend to face the highest risk of job automation, with as many as 
one in three working in jobs at high risk of being eliminated due to automation.7
Preparing for the replacement effects and focusing on the transition and redeployment challenges should be 
part of the ethical and business decisions behind automation strategies.

surveillance technologies to

Critical to the question of using surveillance technologies is to expand 
and understand the aim of these efforts. Are they narrowly focused on 
productivity and worker output, or are they being used to humanize 
the worker and the workflow? Are the technologies focused on workers’ 
physical and mental safety in addition to productivity?
Deeper dive
Studies of long-distance truck drivers suggest that drivers who are constantly monitored “feel pressure not to 
take mandated breaks and to continue working even when sleep is necessary.”8 
Some companies are already providing solutions for monitoring manufacturing, warehouse, and call center 
environments in real time in an effort to optimize performance. A critical question for organizations to ask is how 
they can implement and govern the use of such technologies so that they benefit the workforce and customers 
as well as the organization.

Could we ...

learning to parse through 
potential candidates and make 
recommendations on hiring 
decisions, speeding the talent 
acquisition process?
… account for that, while algorithms can help make faster recruitment 
decisions, they can also have negative impacts, including amplifying 
societal biases? 
Humans can also make inconsistent or biased decisions and need the 
help of others, including machines, to guide better decisions. How can 
we combine the strengths of humans and algorithms to develop a fair 
and equitable approach? 
Deeper dive
A 2017 study by the Pew Research Center reported that Americans were more worried than enthusiastic about 
the prospect of computers making hiring decisions by a factor of 3 to 1 (67 percent were worried, 22 percent 
were enthusiastic).9 While the use of AI in recruitment is on the rise and there is a flurry of activity among 
startups offering AI-powered talent acquisition tools,10 some observers have noted that “not understanding 
algorithm scoring is a pitfall … as is the need to educate users that algorithms deliver probabilities [not 
assessments].”11
Governing the development, performance, and use of algorithms, in recruitment or in any other work involving 
a recommendation, diagnosis, or decision, will require rigorous ongoing reviews and controls. The use of 
algorithms does not mean the abdication of responsibility on behalf of those charged with overseeing and 
making decisions. Organizations cannot place excessive reliance on machines, and they cannot use them “off 
label” to do the work on their own. How to operationalize the development, use, and risks of combining humans 
and machines to make decisions is a central question as human-machine collaboration rapidly grows.
Learning by example
Stakeholder pressures are prompting organizations 
to act on the ethics question. Survey respondents 
from leading ethical organizations12 are more likely 
to say the increased importance of ethics is driven 
by direction from their boards and leaders, legal 
and regulatory requirements, and pressure from 
external stakeholders. 
One way some organizations are responding is to 
create senior executive positions with a specific 
focus on driving ethical decision-making across the 
organization.13 Beyond traditional chief ethics and 
compliance officer roles, these organizations are 
formalizing responsibility for ethics around specific 
future-of-work domains such as AI. In 2019, 
Salesforce hired its first Chief Ethical and Humane 
Use officer to ensure that emerging technologies 
were being implemented ethically in the 
organization and to help Salesforce use technology 
in a way that “drives positive social change and 
benefits humanity.”14 
Some organizations are also addressing ethics 
issues by using new technologies in ways that can 
have clear benefits for workers themselves. For 
example, the technology company Drishti designs 
and implements solutions that combine AI and 
computer vision technologies to measure manual 
processes and associated tasks performed by 
human workers on a manufacturing line in near-
real time. The technology gives workers access to 
robust training information, supports safer work 
habits to reduce workplace injuries, and provides 
feedback and rewards for individual contributions 
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

108
on the line—all things that have historically been 
challenging in a fast-moving manufacturing 
environment. While observing people in near-real 
time at work could be seen as a violation of 
personal privacy, Drishti addresses those concerns 
head-on by bringing workers into the conversation 
early, showing them the angle of the cameras and 
emphasizing the focus on the process, not the 
individual. The company reports that when this is 
done, workers almost immediately “see the value of 
the technology and its potential to improve their 
lives and secure their jobs, and they’re on board 
and excited.”15 The aim of the technology—
improving the human experience through process 
analysis, measurement, and insights—sets a clear 
and ethical case for its use, a case that benefits the 
company and, just as importantly, the line 
associate. 
Pivoting ahead
In an age when more people trust their employers 
to do what is right than trust governments, 
nongovernmental organizations, the media, or even 
business in general,16 it is incumbent upon 
organizations to address challenging ethical 
questions in all aspects of the future of work. 
Rather than reacting to ethical dilemmas as they 
arise, those who wish to lead on this front will 
anticipate, plan for, and manage ethics as part of 
their strategy and mission, focusing on how these 
issues may affect stakeholders both inside and 
outside the enterprise. The challenge is to move 
beyond the view that ethical issues must involve 
trade-offs and competition, and to focus on how to 
operationalize and govern the combination of 
humans, machines, and algorithms working as a 
team. This can enable organizations to harness the 
power of humans and technology together to truly 
operate as a social enterprise.

A memo to HR
Expand focus and extend influence
Dear HR,
Out of all the chapters we drafted this year, we were most excited and, frankly, most nervous about this one. 
Over the past decade of our global human capital trends report, we have been prolific in our writing about 
HR. In fact, in looking back, we have written at least 13 distinct chapters on the topic, not including the calls 
to action for HR that we have embedded elsewhere. Our passion for this topic has resulted in us using words 
ranging from “transformation” to “reinvention” and even “revolution” as we started to ponder the impact 
that digital technologies could have on the function. But fundamentally, our consistent focus has been on 
what HR  needed to do to meet the evolving needs of the business—recognizing that hr has always been more 
than a back-office function, but rather a core piece of the organizational fabric, one with the ability to 
influence the most powerful asset of any organization: its people. 
After 10 years of dialogue on this topic, it’s fair to ask: Did it make a difference? Thankfully, the answer is 
yes. Sixty-five percent of our respondents in our 2020 global survey reported that HR has made progress 
over the past decade, but we knew we couldn’t stop there. Because despite the progress made, our 
respondents this year reported a 64-point gap between importance and readiness, with 75 percent saying the 
evolving role of HR was important or very important for their success over the next 12 to 18 months, but only 
11 percent saying they were very ready to address this trend.  	
That finding leads us to a fundamental question: Given the growing importance of the human element at 
work and the continued gap in HR readiness, will HR remain as a distinct function, or has 10 years of 
progress been overshadowed by a persistent view that HR may never get there, signaling the end of HR as we 
know it?
The data from our survey provided a two-dimensional answer. While 93 percent of our respondents believe 
that HR will remain a distinct function over the next five years, a majority (55 percent) also believe that HR 
will substantially or radically change within the next 12 to 18 months, with no noticeable difference in these 
views between HR and non-HR respondents. There is no doubt that change is coming, but we believe it 
needs to be more than transformation or reinvention or even revolution—it needs to be foundational, and 
that is where the real story begins.
As we look back over those 13 past chapters and the recommendations within them, they have been based on 
three fundamental assumptions:
1.	 Work outcomes are stable (organizations know what they need to do and how to do it)
2.	 Jobs are predictable (composed of fixed, task-based work)
3.	 People are fungible (mechanized work enables most humans to do most jobs)
But these are no longer the assumptions in which we can ground HR, because in the future of work, they no 
longer hold. The false notion that work and workers are mechanistic, interchangeable parts on an assembly 
2020 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends

112
line has reinforced the preoccupation with automation—replacing workers with machines—and underplayed 
the opportunity to focus on how work can be reimagined and how workers can be engaged in teams as 
participants and innovators. The mechanistic view, pioneered by Frederick Taylor in his theories of scientific 
management,1 has been superseded over the past 100 years by the acknowledgment that worker motivation 
can enhance productivity, and it has been even further debunked as social, political, and technological 
influences have put the human element at work front and center.
As business strategies evolve in the face of disruption and organizations come face to face with the 
realization that productivity has been flat and in decline for the past two decades,2 organizations are 
being challenged to rethink outdated views and establish 
a new set of truths for the social enterprise at work:
•	 Beyond focusing on how to improve the way work is done today, organizations now need to first consider 
what work they should be doing tomorrow, putting work outcomes in a constant state of flux and work in 
a continuous state of reimagination. 
•	 As a result of work becoming less mechanistic and work outcomes evolving, jobs have become 
increasingly fluid and dynamic, with some thought leaders believing that the end of jobs—fixed, task-
based work—is near. This change is being accelerated as ways of working shift away from rigid reporting 
lines to networks of teams, from prescribed routines and job descriptions to expanded job canvases, and 
from narrow skills to broad capabilities. 
•	 The potential implication for humans is that they need to be viewed not as interchangeable cogs in an 
organization, but rather as individuals with unique and disparate experiences, thoughts, attitudes, 
needs, and, ultimately, value—all of which makes 
the management of the human element at work 
more important and complex than ever before.
As these truths change, so does the foundation upon 
which HR needs to be based. In the new world of 
work, the foundation for HR needs to be one of 
expanded focus and extended influence—two 
concepts that we explain in further detail below.
The good news is that our respondents recognize this 
shift. Out of the 55 percent of our respondents who 
indicated that HR will change substantially or 
radically over the next 12 to 18 months, an 
overwhelming majority—75 percent—thought that 
change would be an expansion of HR’s 
accountability. This expansion needs to be centered 
on two distinct dimensions: scope of influence and 
areas of focus (figure 1). Similar to 
the evolution of traditional business enterprises to

social enterprises, HR also needs to extend its scope of influence beyond the traditional lines of the function 
to the enterprise and ecosystem as a whole, and it needs to broaden its focus from employees to the 
organization and, ultimately, to the work and workforce itself. We call this shift “exponential HR.”
What does this expansion look like in action? Many areas of opportunity and impact exist, but to start the 
discussion, we examine the top areas where our 2020 survey respondents indicated that HR could make the 
greatest impact. The evolution of these outcomes is summarized in figure 2.

Like any shift, this one will require some significant changes. When our survey respondents identified the 
biggest changes HR should make to maximize its impact, four rose to the top of the list: 
•	 Increase new capabilities (47 percent). We see HR organizations doing this by adopting a new 
mindset: Embracing new traits and behaviors that can help allow the enterprise to thrive in the 
digital age.
•	 Change the HR organization design to incorporate more agile and team-based work 
(45 percent). HR organizations can do this by applying a new lens: Adopting an operating model that 
enables HR to flex based on dynamic business needs. 
•	 Increase the efficiency through which HR activities occur through automation 
(38 percent). HR organizations could do this by adopting enablers: Deploying advanced technology to 
promote productivity and value and simplify the experience.
•	 Expand the expectations and stature of HR leaders (24 percent). HR leaders can do this by 
elevating their focus: Driving tangible, measurable value across the enterprise.
Movement in this direction will require HR to address some key challenges. Our survey results this year 
point to two key barriers: the way in which HR is typically structured, and HR’s general lack of alignment 
with the areas where the biggest business impact can be made. 
With respect to structure, the survey results identified some resistance. Despite clear signs that structural 
change may be required, a plurality of survey respondents (42 percent) believe that the structure of HR 
should remain aligned to HR functional areas. But in a world where alignment to work and the workforce is 
needed more than ever, traditional functional alignment is something that we believe should be 
reconsidered. 
With regard to HR’s alignment with business impact, our survey respondents identified some critical gaps. 
While developing leaders, upskilling the workforce, and promoting teaming were the top three areas where 
respondents thought HR could make the greatest impact, two of these three areas—leadership and teaming—
scored the lowest in terms of respondents’ perceived readiness. Based on these findings, we believe that 
organizations should take a more in-depth look at the prioritization of HR’s work and effort.
Despite these barriers, the shift to exponential HR is underway in a number of organizations. Alexion 
Pharmaceuticals, for instance, capped off a three-year organizational transformation by bringing its HR, IT, 
and patient advocacy organizations together into one new human experience function.3 This new function

reflects Alexion’s belief that you cannot talk about the employee experience without understanding how that 
experience impacts patients, representing a shift in the way that this organization thinks about the outcomes 
of their work. Similarly, a leading global health care company decided to move to a more holistic and 
inclusive framework to talent, including internal and external talent. In very close collaboration with IT and 
procurement, this framework will now sit under the people & culture function, enabling stronger knowledge 
of the capabilities and enhanced access to this talent pool for strategic workforce planning purposes. By 
having the people & culture function cocreating, with colleagues from IT and procurement, the processes, 
practices and the choice of technology solutions, they will ensure consistency in the experience for their 
entire workforce, with a strong focus on the moments that matter. This will also allow them to offer the right 
solutions for a specific business need, regardless if the best talent solution is to buy, build, borrow, or 
bridge.4 And Highmark Health’s HR has responded to the greater fluidity and unpredictability of jobs by 
creating a new organization called thinkUP, which partners across the enterprise and ecosystem to reimagine 
the way in which work gets done and the roles that are needed to execute that work on a real-time basis. This 
process includes everything from organization and process design to the use of advanced technologies, 
automation, and econometrics.5
We are also seeing some signs of what happens when this shift does not occur. At several large companies, 
the CHRO position has been eliminated and HR teams have been moved under other C-suite or divisional 
leaders. These examples reinforce that HR is at an important inflection point. While our survey respondents 
generally agree there is a great opportunity ahead, they also acknowledge that there are doubts about HR’s 
ability to capitalize on it. Twenty-six percent of our non-HR respondents reported that they are not confident 
in HR’s ability to make the needed changes, and an additional 37 percent said they were only somewhat 
confident. Even respondents who were HR professionals themselves expressed a level of doubt: Only 
13 percent of those respondents reported being very confident that the shifts were feasible. 
In the coming decade, HR has the opportunity to embrace the future, expand its reach and focus, and 
assume the leading role at the vanguard of work, the workplace, and the workforce on behalf of the 
enterprise. In this expanded role, HR becomes a vital enabler of an organization’s ability to thrive in a world 
where the old rules of work no longer apply, and the new ones are evolving rapidly. Exponential HR, focused 
on humanizing the world of work, is a key source of strength for the future-focused organization seeking to 
make the most of human capital in today’s dynamic environment.
