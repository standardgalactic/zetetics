The History of Computing series publishes high-quality books which address the 
history of computing, with an emphasis on the ‘externalist’ view of this history, 
more accessible to a wider audience. The series examines content and history from 
four main quadrants: the history of relevant technologies, the history of the core 
science, the history of relevant business and economic developments, and the history 
of computing as it pertains to social history and societal developments.
Titles can span a variety of product types, including but not exclusively, themed 
volumes, biographies, ‘profile’ books (with brief biographies of a number of key 
people), expansions of workshop proceedings, general readers, scholarly expositions, 
titles used as ancillary textbooks, revivals and new editions of previous worthy titles.
These books will appeal, varyingly, to academics and students in computer 
science, history, mathematics, business and technology studies. Some titles will also 
directly appeal to professionals and practitioners of different backgrounds.

Preface
It takes a solid foundation on which to build a 
large house.
—Various
1
This rise in success and prominence from “also-ran,” to now being routinely 
ranked in the top-ten of the hundreds of Ph.D. granting computer science schools in 
the United States, has occurred in the short time–span (for academia) of 20 years. 
There were several prior visions, the last of which led to the formal creation of the 
College of Computing in 1990. By 2010 it had entered the top-ten category, a status 
that continues now almost 14 years later.
This growth occurred not in Silicon Valley or Boston or similar technology hot-­
houses, but in Atlanta, Georgia, a large and dynamic city known for being a leader 
in multiple areas, but only starting in 1990 to build a base of modern technology 
firms. Its home, Georgia Tech, long known for Engineering, offered a receptive 
home for its growth, but the growth occurred in an entirely new college within the 
university, separate from existing colleges and not within a shell provided by an 
already successful unit.
This book should appeal to multiple groups, for example: those that have at some 
time in the past, currently, or may in the future have some interest in Georgia Tech 
and/or the College of Computing; anyone interested in how to change constructively 
a major university to address the demands of new fields of endeavor as diverse as 
bio-science and economics; those that are generally interested in organizational 
growth and change success factors; policy makers in education, government, and 
industry; as well as anyone interested in the growth of the computing milieu broadly.

It can be read as an historical account or as a collection of vignettes of leaders 
with vision and the ability to lead or enable those that actualize their visions, or as 
a model, not a plan, for organizational change. Whatever purpose you have in mind 
for reading this book, I have tried to make it accessible and entertaining as a story 
for you, with a minimum of jargon.
It is a story about more than building a specific academic institution. It can serve 
as a parable for marshalling and building on a collection of visions that have evolved 
and are connected to actualizations, while still remaining within the scope of the 
most encompassing of previous visions.

Acknowledgments
The idea of writing this book first occurred to me over a decade ago! The idea of 
acknowledging everyone who helped me with it along the way is daunting, to say 
nothing of the fear of omission, but here goes.
The dedication is all-encompassing and not made lightly. Those individuals cre­
ated the material for this book.
All my direct colleagues and advisers who have made specific contributions, 
especially those who sat for formal interviews and to whom I am deeply indebted; 
you know who you are and I trust you feel my great appreciation.
Richard (Rich) LeBlanc not only played an exceedingly important part in the 
creation of the College and by serving as my Associate Dean during critical years, 
but has been of extraordinary assistance in filling in critical details in this text and 
reviewing far too many drafts right up to the very end.
Rich LeBlanc, Janet Kolodner, James (Jim) Foley, Richard (Rich) DeMillo, and 
Albert (Al) Badre, all long-standing faculty members and colleagues, not only filled 
me in on many things I did not know and that are not formally documented, but 
commented on a complete and early first draft. Their advice has been valuable and 
influential.
William (Bill) Aspray, my co-author on two other books, long-time writing 
advisor, and friend, provided continued advice in general and on early versions of 
this project that have helped me through more than one rough patch.
The partial financial support of the College of Computing, and the deans that 
enabled that, is gratefully acknowledged by this emeritus (who has the freedom do 
whatever I want to do professionally, but doesn’t get a regular paycheck!). LaDonna 
Cherry, Doug Goodwin, and their colleagues at Georgia Tech were especially 
helpful in acquiring photographs.
Springer Nature and in particular my Senior Editor, Wayne Wheeler, the 
Production Coordinator Naomi Portnoy, and Production Manager Prasad 
Gurunadham and the Production Team have been helpful and patient beyond 

x
reasonable expectations. The History of Computing Series Editor, Gerard Alberts, 
made very helpful comments at an early stage.
Finally, and very far from last, Barbara, my wife of many years, has endured 
years of seeing “only your back as you sat at your computer.” Thank you for your 
forbearance, love, and support!
The final result, of course, is only due to me and my feeble efforts at writing an 
organizational history.

Chapter 1
Prologue
This chapter will set the stage for the events described in succeeding chapters that 
tell the story of the start and growth over 75 years of a complex academic organiza­
tion—the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is a story 
of visions and actualizations.
The visions were sometimes of a long-term future, but much more frequently of 
what might be accomplished in a limited amount of time. They were sometimes 
very broad, encompassing every aspect of the College of today, but much more 
frequently were limited to one or more specific activities such as education or 
courses focused on software.
The actualizations, often limited in scope at the time, have led to a highly suc­
cessful result today when looked at in their totality; of course, some actions ulti­
mately had no or even negative consequences within their scope—that is often what 
is observed on a granular level—but it has been my task as the “historian,” as well 
as a participant, to take a broader look and provide context and perspective. The 
actualizations could sometimes be attributed to a single individual, such as an 
instructor who devised a new and ultimately influential course, or to a collection of 
individuals working in a defined research area who take steps to develop and share 
a commonly held vision.
Sometimes, success credit cannot be assigned to specific visions, actualizations, 
or individuals, nor is it critical that be done every time. Yet, to make reliable, future 
progress it is essential to have some guidelines on what has worked in the past. I 
wrote this book, among other reasons, to share the facts of this success story, with a 
few personal observations.
It is important that you have a general understanding of the context in which it 
has taken place, why it may be useful to you, what the elements of the story are, and 
how the story will be told; that is the purpose of this chapter.

1.1  Objectives of Telling This Story
There are two:
First, to document the history of the rise of an organization that has touched and 
successfully changed the lives of thousands of people over several generations 
and continues to do so today.
Second, to identify and explicate some of what has led to the acknowledged success 
of an organization with a stated purpose, even as the details of that purpose have 
changed over time.
Telling this part of the Georgia Tech history may provide interesting reading 
for the general reader, but it will hold special interest for those who have spent 
time studying, teaching, learning, or even working in a role that day to day may 
have little obvious connection to the larger purpose of the College of Computing. 
This may provide new meaning to those that have been a part of the history as well 
as to those that know direct participants in it or may want to be a part of it in 
the future.
I would argue, however, that this story has greater importance than just the his­
tory of a single college in a large university. There are thousands of institutions of 
higher education in the United States, most of which teach some aspect of comput­
ing and several hundred of which actively contribute as well to the advancement of 
the fields based on computers. Georgia Tech is not only one of those, but is now 
ranked among the best national universities and easily in the top 10 of public univer­
sities; the College of Computing is similarly ranked, most recently in the top 5 or 6 
schools in computing. I sincerely believe that this rapid rise (for an academic orga­
nization) gives this particular story much wider applicability, a judgment I hope that 
the reader will share and use in their own situations.
Having people well-educated in the fundamentals of computing, a field that is 
impacting almost everything in our modern world, is unquestionably important. 
Thus, understanding this story will contribute to your understanding of our world of 
today. Beyond this and for those with professional interest in the second objective 
above, the story of the Georgia Tech College of Computing provides meaning to and 
examples of the principles that will be identified below.
In short I have attempted to write an interesting, readable, and informative nar­
rative—that may also have practical use by some readers. If you think it might be 
of some interest to you, however, then please read at least the rest of this short 
chapter.

I assume most readers will have a general understanding of Western and American 
history, as well as the general purpose and nature of universities.
Geography and economic development have been inextricably intertwined 
throughout history, a fact that even a passing acquaintance with the past makes obvi­
ous. The development of North America by Europeans after 1500, when their tech­
nology and aggressiveness enabled them to overcome and largely eradicate or 
control the indigenous population, illustrates well this interaction. As natural ports 
such as Boston and New York developed, Savannah, Georgia was not far behind, 
establishing the state firmly as an important part of the original thirteen colonies. 
Atlanta, although not a seaport, was also founded as a crossroad of commerce and 
communication because of its central location and favorable site for surface trans­
portation (initially railroads and, later, long-distance, paved highways).
From its start in 1837, Atlanta has had a commercial, pro-growth leadership 
characterized by civic boosterism. After the almost complete destruction of the city 
in the Civil War it regained its importance as a transportation base, but the South, 
even in somewhat more progressive Georgia, basically rebuilt an old economy 
based on land and agriculture rather than building a manufacturing economy. This 
was a strategic mistake, that coupled with the regressive repression of Blacks, held 
the South back almost totally in the years just after the Civil War and in some ways 
well through the first half of the twentieth century.
By 1880, local leaders set out “to revitalize the South” and in Georgia with 
explicit calls to create “industrial schools” to train the engineers, mechanics, archi­
tects, and other technicians needed to compete with rapidly advancing industrial 
economies elsewhere. After heated discussion, work by a commission established 
by the Legislature, and more public debate, plans for a new school in Atlanta were 
brought forth; they were similar to the model being followed by the Worcester 
(Massachusetts) Free Institute (now Worcester Polytechnic Institute). It was based 
on a “shop culture” that focused on practical subjects rather than a “school culture” 
that emphasized higher mathematics, theoretical science, and original research; 
Boston Tech (now MIT) was built on the school culture model; that early focus on 
practicality set the tone for Georgia Tech up to the present, even though today it is 
considered one of the Nation’s leading engineering research schools.

1.1 4
3 In the late 1800s, as universities as we know them today blossomed and expanded to include 
technical subjects such as engineering and other practical subjects, two theories of the best way to 
organize the study of such subjects emerged: the academic culture and the shop culture. Today’s 
MIT was based on the academic culture that held that the best way to teach engineering was by 
studying the supporting theories of math, physics, and chemistry. The shop culture emphasized 
hands-on involvement in the practical aspects of engineering. Worcester Polytechnic Institute was 
a prime example following the shop culture view and was the primary model for the initial curricu­
lum at Georgia Tech. There are interesting cultural and social implications of these approaches and 
their implementations.
4 Robert M. Craig, a fellow emeritus at Georgia Tech, graciously provided the following, based on 
his book Campus Walks: A Guide to the Architecture of Georgia Tech. “Tech Tower is more neo-­
Romanesque than neo-Gothic (round arched not pointed arches). The towers on this and other like 
late Victorian buildings by Bruce and Morgan (Tech, Agnes Scott, Clemson, the architects’ various 
courthouses) were intended to landmark the buildings—give them visual prominence as symbols 
of what Henry Grady called the New South. For Georgia Tech this was particularly relevant as 
Tech Tower and the Shop Building, with their massing, solidity, and upward aspirations, symbol­
ized the rising power of industry and technology in the state”

Georgia Tech was created by civic-minded leaders whose interest was in advanc­
ing the development of a competitive, modern industry in Georgia and especially in 
Atlanta but a series of misfortunes and poor choices resulted in the school strug­
gling for much of the next 50 years.
Although a few new engineering subjects, other departments, and the start of an 
applied engineering unit were added, it was not until World War II (WW II) that the 
school truly began to change. The use of mathematics and science had advanced by 
the 1930s to where they could be used as the basis for performing calculations cen­
tral to modern engineering and warfare, although some such uses also date back 
many centuries at least to Roman times. There were a few signs of this at Georgia 
Tech in engineering and basic science courses from its start, but often not to the 
extent found in other schools in the North. As World War II accelerated the need for 
these techniques, this prompted their expanded and advanced development and 
teaching to thousands of young students. Georgia Tech became a natural training 
ground for advanced study to support the war efforts and as a result, the school itself 
was dramatically changed and brought up to speed in many branches of science and 
technology.
While a few professors at Tech were engaged in scholarly activities beyond their 
teaching before 1940, World War II was the proximate cause of the start of modern­
ization on campus. Nuclear energy has long been seen as the most impactful tech­
nological development (pun aside) of the War. While there is no question of nuclear 
energy’s potential, the War’s demands for rapid computation and vastly improved 
telecommunications, led to the emergence of computers as engines not only of com­
putation but more importantly as manipulators of information; that result is cur­
rently having a larger impact on our world than nuclear energy and was perhaps the 
single most impactful technical outcome of the War. However, the impact of com­
puters, as with nuclear energy, is not all positive either—as seen today in the current 
concern over the advancement of artificial intelligence that is raging as this is 
written.
WW II resulted in many other changes at Tech besides dramatic increases in war-­
related research from curriculum to year-round operation. On July 1, 1948 The 
Georgia School of Technology officially became the Georgia Institute of Technology 
to reflect its growing research and advanced education focus. In the 1950s Atlanta 
continued its openness to change by starting to shed its segregationist past and lead­
ing in desegregation efforts among Southern cities. Then Georgia Tech admitted its 
first woman student in 1952.

Thus, by 1970 Georgia Tech was an important part of a growing, forward-­looking 
city and state, albeit in a region that was still lagging the rest of the nation in 
research, innovation, and industrial activity. The spirit of growth and the desire held 
by local civic and business leaders to be a part of larger forces in the world created 
an environment in which a technical university was seen as an important asset. This 
enabled Tech to grow and improve, held back only by its own internal leadership 
and the inherently conservative fiscal policies of the State.

1.3  Style Notes
I have written this book in a mix of first and third person. For the 12  years 
(1990–2002) that I served as the Founding Dean, it is also a partial memoir of what 
I personally did and sometimes why. I am reporting on events and actions, in many 
of which I was personally involved, and almost all of which I was aware of at the 
time. First person seems natural.
In other places I will often use the third person because I know that whatever is 
being described may not have originated with me and had to be the product of joint 
action and/or agreement between me and the faculty, individually and/or as group.
I have tried to introduce and use the names of individuals formally the first time 
(e.g., President John Patrick Crecine), but then refer to them by the name commonly 
used on campus (e.g., Pat Crecine) or sometimes only their first or last name (e.g., 
Pat or Crecine). I will rarely use a title (e.g., President or Dean) and almost never 
Professor or Ph.D., as is common in the academic computing community. The only 
potential name conflict in the book might be between Richard (Rich) LeBlanc and 
Richard (Rich) DeMillo, but context will make it clear to which I am referring.

No history describes its subject down to the last detail; that would be a chronicle. 
Rather, this book is a useful narration that has a purpose that selects and weaves 
together, not always in a strict chronological order, a set of events that tell an

or elaboration, are more accustomed to footnotes. Those just interested in the narrative can easily

interesting story. In doing so, I could not name every individual involved, nor every 
aspect of every subevent.
However, without a number of talented individuals, the College of today would 
not have been brought into existence as quickly (in academic time!) as it was. The 
named individuals will be recognized by some readers, amplifying their enjoyment 
of this book, while providing a bit of background to them that will illustrate the 
nature of the people involved for readers that did not know them personally. 
Mentioning names is always a practice open to the sins of omission and commis­
sion, but, any such sins I have committed were not intentional.

1.4  Terms Needing Explication and Differentiation
I will use several terms in the following chapters that require some short discussion 
here; some readers may choose to scan over this lightly. The terms tend to overlap 
in meaning and in common usage, so strict definitions are difficult, if not impossi­
ble. The discussions below are intended to assist you in reading the subsequent 
narratives without getting becoming confused; they are not intended to be definitive.

This fails to differentiate, however, between organizations that fit this definition 
and those whose primary purpose is the creation of computer and computer-based 
products. For example, Intel, a chip-making company, certainly uses computers in 
its work (fitting the definition above), but it is primarily an IT-producing organiza­
tion, where “information technology (IT)” is its end product. As with many other 
terms, these definitions have to be looked at in the context of usage (e.g., is Google 
an IT company or an advertising company?)

Computing refers to the use of modern digital computers to carry out processes 
on information, including those that underlie modern electronic communication. 
This might be considered synonymous with “instrumental computing” or even “IT” 
as defined above.

foundation for instrumental computing. The College undertook a major push in this 
area starting in the mid-1990s to serve the thousands of instrumental computing 
users on campus. See Chapters 5 and 6.
Computation is commonly understood to be the act of calculating a result based 
on a set of numbers and a set of rules, such as the rules of arithmetic. Computation 
(synonymously, calculation) may be as simple as counting the money in your pocket 
to determine if you have enough money for a purchase or as complex as calculating 
the trajectory of a rocket to encircle the moon. Computation is one of the earliest 
known advanced characteristics of human beings dating back millennia.

The first viewpoint tends toward exclusion of new subjects (e.g., AI), while the 
second definition tends toward inclusion of new subjects and, often, close collabora­
tion (e.g., HCI) between researchers working in different sub-fields of CS.
The second, inclusionary viewpoint, is a core value and cornerstone of the 
College of Computing.
The concept that has guided the development of the College of Computing
Education and research focused on computers and software and their usage,
might have led to naming it the College of Academic Computing or even College of 
Academic and Instrumental Computing, but it didn’t, at least for the simplicity and 
breadth of just College of Computing. In its present incarnation, the College of 
Computing has aspired to combine academic and instrumental computing, in the 
sense of research on basics of computing broadly and educational programs that 
instruct students from other disciplines as well in instrumental computing.

1.4.2  Organizational Terms
Higher education organizations share a fairly common set of names as a part of their 
overall name and constituent parts, with some variations.
Universities, colleges, and schools are the most common names of free-standing 
organizations (e.g., University of Virginia, Haverford College, Rhode Island School 
of Design) that include departments, schools, or colleges within them (e.g., Math 
Department, School of Social Sciences, College of Engineering). As a general rule, 
universities are larger, or at least have a broader range of areas of specialization, and 
give advanced degrees including the Ph.D. and professional degrees such as MBA, 
JD, and MD. There are often colleges and or schools within universities, as well as 
institutes and other sub-divisions or mixes; the reverse (universities within one of 
the others) is almost never found.
Departments or schools are usually within one of the higher-level structures and 
are the “home” of individual faculty members. Departments are usually focused on 
a fairly well-defined discipline (e.g., physics, history, literature, etc.), which are 
sometimes dependent on the encompassing organization’s breadth. A small college 
may have a single “foreign languages” department, whereas a university may have 
a separate department for each language covered (e.g., Spanish, Chinese, Latin, etc.).
­
19
Institute is less common for an entire educational organization but more often 
used to designate an organization focused on a specific subject that is free-standing 
(e.g., United States Institute of Peace) or part of a larger organization (e.g., Kellar 
Institute at George Mason University). “Georgia Institute of Technology,” a some­
what outdated name, is still used for historical and legal continuity since today it is 
a full university; people not familiar with it (!) often refer to it as George Tech 
University.
Computing schools and I-schools characterize overarching, academic organiza­
tions composed of disciplinary sub-units operating under a single dean. The com­
monality that this encourages effects curricula, teaching, hiring, and often

19 The usage of “school” to denote what on most other campuses is called a “department,” appar­
ently dates back many years at Tech to differentiate between academic units at that time that gave 
an accredited degree (e.g., School of Mechanical Engineering) and ones that only provided instruc­
tion (e.g., Department of Modern Languages).

The latter is a good example of an effort that started with close coordination between disparate 
departments and is now growing into a true computing school in the sense defined above.

Fields such as library science and information science (now often combined in 
some way) have a long and important history. There is a growing movement of 
I-schools; some are explicitly named something like “school of information” and 
others, including the College of Computing, have names more on the technology 
side. As a special-interest subject within management science, there has been a 
long-standing group focused on information systems. While computers are of cen­
tral concern to both, I-schools typically are more interested in the meaning and use 
of information while computing schools are more interested in the role of comput­
ers in the representation and machine processing of those representations. The 
information science group, however, was more focused on the use of computers in 
business settings than on the details of the processing of information.
Turning from this brief contextual and definitional prelude, let’s look at the rest 
of the book.
1.5  Order of Presentation
The first part of the narrative and some related context is covered in Chapter 2, 
including how the campus Librarian, Dorothy (Dot) Crosland, had the vision of 
making the school a leader in what she saw developing nationally and then went 
about finding and hiring the man, Vladimir (Vlad) Slamecka, who built the first part 
of the eventual foundation. Chapter 3 relates how the next school chair, Raymond 
(Ray) Miller, was hired from IBM Research where he was widely known as an intel­
lectual leader in computing; he added strength in the keystone field of computer 
science. That hire was made by the President at the time, Joseph (Joe) Pettit, who 
understood the importance of intellectual background and technological achieve­
ment, including computing.
Chapter 4 describes how the new President, Pat Crecine, with a different but also 
very relevant computing background, reorganized the campus generally and 
included a brand new college of computing to achieve Georgia Tech’s place in his 
vision of where the world was headed. A collection of campus leaders—faculty, 
administrators, and some students—carried the President’s vision to the next level 
of detail that served as the charter for the founding of the College of Computing.
22 As an historical aside, in the middle 1990s I organized a meeting called the IT Deans Group and 
invited the dean or head of any unit that primarily focused on computing, computer science, infor­
mation technology, or information in a university and fit the definition above to it. Every one of the 
15 or so in attendance found it worth their time to spend a day discussing issues of common con­
cern. We continued to meet and eventually grew to about 25 people by the time I stepped down as 
dean and (ad hoc head of the group) in 2002. The group then continued to meet under the auspices 
of the Computing Research Association and eventually became known as the I-Schools Group.

Chapters 5 and 6 tell the story of the first dozen years of the College, my time as 
dean, that rounded out the conceptual and operational aspects of the foundation that 
largely persists today and arguably without which the expansive and honored suc­
cess of the next 20 years could not have occurred. Chapter 7 tells the story of how 
Dean Rich DeMillo added some important pieces to the foundation which had been 
left incomplete while faculty leaders continued to build and strengthen their indi­
vidual fields of scholarship. Chapter 8 relates how Dean Zvi Galil aided by faculty 
leaders and external supporters, innovated and implemented a new modality of 
delivery of advanced education that has led to explosive growth in the number of 
degree-seeking students accompanied by wide notice of the efforts in the popular 
press. Chapter 8 ends with the still unfolding part of the story that started under 
Dean Charles Isbell and continues today. He carried the College successfully 
through the sudden turmoil of the Covid-19 pandemic while adding a new School of 
Cybersecurity and Privacy, strengthening some of its important organizational com­
ponents, and expanding its leadership on campus in data science and bioinformat­
ics. Finally, Chapter 9 ties together the narratives and draws out a few key points. 
The primary keys to success are embedded in the story, sometimes explicitly, and 
some are made more specific in the final chapter. The Appendix presents a strategic 
planning example.

and communication networks. At Georgia Tech there was an awakening to this and 
early usage by a few professors.
Starting in the late 1940s with the installation of an analog network calculator on 
campus supported and used by the local power company, the business leadership in 
Atlanta by the mid-1950s understood the need for advanced digital computation and 
provided the funds for a new building and assistance with purchase of a state-of-the-­
art digital computer.
Tech’s involvement in the war effort and the large influx of veterans beginning in 
1945, many of whom were seeking education in modern engineering, and graduate 
engineering programs, greatly expanded the number of people on campus with an 
understanding of the practical usage of computers. As a consequence, it is not surpris­
ing that electronic computing at Tech started barely 2 years after the cessation of hos­
tilities with the installation in 1947 of a Westinghouse A-C Network Calculator 
donated by Georgia Power Corporation. Costing $300,000 (well over $3 million 
today) the analog computer was one of the first such machines in the country at a 
university and was used productively on campus until the early 1970s. It enabled engi­
neers to simulate power station and transmission circuit operation in order to be able 
to study stability, loading, and other characteristics. It was contracted out to industry, 
while also serving as a teaching and research vehicle for faculty and students. A staff 
of almost a hundred employees created the basis for a large growth in the Engineering 
Experiment Station (today’s Georgia Tech Research Institute—GTRI).
As the engineering and science faculty at Tech increased their research activity 
in areas beyond electrical engineering, they began using the more numerically based 
procedures developed during WW II. In turn, to be competitive with research activi­
ties at leading engineering schools they needed to tackle larger problems that often 
exceeded the capacity of hand calculation; moreover, analog computers often could 
not fulfill the need for precise numerical calculation nor be easily changed from one 
problem to another. As a result the need for digital computation soon became evi­
dent to the faculty and staff.
At the same time, Atlanta commercial organizations were starting to explore 
digital computerization for their purposes including in manufacturing, managing 
stock inventories, planning optimal delivery routes, and, of course, performing 
financial functions such as bookkeeping and preparing reports. Again, the geo­
graphical location of Atlanta as a transportation hub, coupled with its history of 
competitiveness to keep up with the rest of the country, were crucial factors in the 
growing need for numerical calculation capabilities by local firms.
Typically in those days, professors and their research assistants on many cam­
puses were often well ahead of their campuses in using digital technology, either 
through their service in the military or by using computers on other campuses or 
government labs. While records about research activity from those days are scant, it

is fair to assume that some Tech faculty and staff were already active users of digital 
computers as noted above. Thus, the school’s growing reputation as the region’s 
center of advanced technical knowledge and instruction made it the natural site for 
a major digital computer installation. A movement in this direction started in July 
1953 with the establishment of a campus computer center and began to take shape 
in 1954 when a Remington Rand ERA-1101 computer was purchased and brought 
to campus to await completion of a building. A young engineer, Alton (Pete) Jensen, 
was perhaps the first hire to help with the installation and use of the equipment; he 
later played a seminal role in the creation of the College of Computing 35 years later.
The Rich Computer Center (RCC) opened in 1955 and is still the central campus 
computing facility. Construction and initial equipment (including the ERA-1101 
and an NCR-102-D) were supported by funds from the Rich Foundation and the 
Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), with matching funds from the State and 
discounts from the manufacturers of the two computers. The building was named 
after the Rich Foundation of a local merchant family by that name. Guests at the 
dedication in December 1955 included Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield and 
computer pioneer Howard Aiken, director of the Harvard Computation Laboratory.
This early, high-level support of campus computing was a strong message to the 
campus and community, although it was some years before that strong beginning was 
more fully realized. Early machines (besides the two initial machines) included an 
IBM 650 and a Burroughs 220 in 1958, followed by a Burroughs B5000 in the early 
1960s. However, having a building dedicated to computing was something quite new 
on campuses, far ahead of many others at that time and a great advantage along several 
dimensions. The growth of research at Tech and the on-campus computational resources 
to support it led to the installation of successively more powerful and advanced 
machines—a story that has continued and changed in form and extent ever since.
The growth of the instrumental use of computing on campus also led to the use 
of more sophisticated software (for the time), such as the programming language 
Algol, and the hiring of knowledgeable people already known and active in the 
world of computing. A prime example was the hiring in 1957 of William F. Atchinson 
to be Director of the Rich Computer Center. Atchinson had been a professor of 
mathematics at The University of Illinois and was also head of the ACM Curriculum 
Committee, an important leadership position in the development of computing edu­
cation. (ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery, founded in 1950, is the 
oldest of the two primary organizations to which computing professionals belong.) 
He later played a key role in the formation of the first academic computing depart­
ment at Tech, the School of Information Science.
As the importance of creating computer-based technology and utilizing it for a 
variety of tasks began to emerge in force in the mid-1980s, Atlanta’s civic leaders 
again strove to develop the environment necessary to participate and lead in this on-
going revolution. This took various forms, including the creation of a major initia­
tive that partially funded a large number of endowed academic chairs at Georgia 
Tech and other research institutions in Georgia.
The story of the instrumental use of computers at Georgia Tech also grew as it 
became an essential tool for most of the engineering and science disciplines in both

theoretical and applied work, as well as eventually, architecture and the social 
sciences. That is a story worth telling because the relatively early instrumental usage 
of computers at Tech was clearly an element in the rise in the national stature of the 
entire campus. However, it is not a story in which I played any specific role nor one 
that I have researched. In the following, I will refer in places to interactions of the 
College of Computing with other areas on campus in their use of instrumental com­
puting, but I will not elaborate on them. Instead, I will turn my focus on the growth 
of the research and educational programs focused on computing as a discipline that 
is amenable to study and instruction—academic computing.

As instrumental computing was starting to spread among the faculty at Tech for 
calculations and even simple simulations, a second activity independently arose in 
an area far afield from most of the ongoing research and education at Tech, the field 
of information science which includes library science today. Head Librarian 
Dorothy Crosland, through her attendance at professional meetings became aware 
in the late 1950s that “information work” (defined as acquiring, moving, and creat­
ing information) was emerging as a new field of great practical application distinct 
from traditional library science. It is today considered a part of the discipline of 
information science.
Although not a technologist, she understood that computers would be an essen­
tial part of information work in the future, and that these were activities worthy of 
academic study and education, especially at Georgia Tech with its emerging strength 
in electronics. Following her intuition and most likely her observation of and inter­
action with early leaders on campus in computing as well, she decided that Tech

Dorothy “Dot” Crosland (1903–1983), an Atlanta native, was the only 
woman in the Tech administration at a time when there were not even women 
undergraduates. Crosland graduated in 1923 with a degree from the Library 
School of the Carnegie Library of Atlanta, later known as the Emory University 
School of Library Science.
She was a remarkable leader with a long and effective record of pushing Tech 
forward. Beginning in the 1930s she started to expand the library holdings 
significantly, then immediately after WW II she raised private money to make 
a remarkable trip during which she bought a huge number of important jour­
nals and books in war-ravaged Europe. The Library Building was much too 
small to house the new holdings, so she raised more money for a modern 
library building to house them that is still the main Library today. She engi­
neered the first admission of women students, helped make other changes on 
campus, and should be credited as the founder of academic computing pro­
grams at Georgia Tech. This resulted in many valuable connections within the 
state political leadership and beyond, and a large amount of respect 
on campus.

should take an early lead in the use of computers for information work, an early 
instance of “staying ahead of the curve”—a common mantra in today’s competi­
tive world.
When she set about to make Tech a leader in the new field of information work, 
her intuition was correct, although the eventual result in the form of the education 
and research programs of today’s College of Computing would have been far 
beyond anything she could have imagined. One of her professional friends, Burt 
Atkinson, was the head of a new National Science Foundation (NSF) program 
which focused on developing the new field of “information science,” created in 
response to the launch of Sputnik. This friendship enabled her to obtain NSF fund­
ing to hold two international meetings at Tech on “Training Science Information 
Specialists” in 1961 and 1962.
It is clear that following her library science training, she organized these meet­
ings to find out what was happening both in this country and internationally regard­
ing the meeting topic before instituting such programs locally. Based on reports 
from the meetings, what she discovered was that while there were scattered courses 
and interest that there were few if any degree programs elsewhere. She and some 
Library colleagues began teaching a few short courses on information science, 
apparently even before the second conference was held.
In line with her vision of making Georgia Tech a leader in what she perceived 
would someday be a leading academic field, after the meetings she urged Atkinson 
to fund educational programs with NSF support. Atkinson was clearly in favor of 
this. As a result he encouraged Crosland to submit a proposal for funding.
As the Librarian and not a member of an academic department, she knew that she 
had neither the knowledge nor the status, to say nothing of the time, to create a 
degree program and its courses on her own. That was only a minor impediment to 
Dorothy Crosland, who never took “no” for an answer, and had a strong reputation 
on campus for the many things she had done. As a result it was easy for her to enlist 
the help of three senior faculty: William Atchison, head of the Rich Computing 
Center and Professor of Mathematics (who was also active in the Association of 
Computing Machinery (ACM) educational efforts); Vernon Crawford, Professor of 
Physics and later Chancellor of the University System; and Waldemar Ziegler, 
Professor of Chemical Engineering, to visit Europe and other schools in the U.S. to 
study more deeply what was being done here and abroad in education for the 
new field.

The administration was taking a risk on a new field (not something that was com­
mon at Georgia Tech at the time) despite some faculty pushback. In those days there 
was considerable doubt among traditional faculty everywhere that the study of com­
puters was worthy of academic interest beyond instruction in how to use them for 
instrumental purposes and Information Science did not appear to even contribute 
much to that. At Tech this was certainly the case where there were apparently no 
existing faculty that knew anything about the new and unknown discipline and no 
one wanted a new activity competing for resources. In her usual manner, however, 
Crosland pushed it through, perhaps because no one really wanted to cross her. The 
School of Information Science was created administratively early in 1963 and in all 
likelihood was the first of its kind in the U.S. Then, in early 1964, NSF awarded 
Tech about $200,000 (~ $1.5 million today) to support the program.
It is worth noting that there were a few other departments in the process of for­
mation at that time that included information science in their titles (if not always in 
their courses). One was the Department of Information and Computer Science at 
UC Irvine, which existed from the time the campus opened in the fall of 1965. It 
existed as a stand-alone department alongside much larger Schools at UCI until it 
was made a full-fledged School in 2010 (it had long given degrees at all three levels 
and reported as an equal to the chief academic officer of the campus). Even when I 
joined it as a young professor in 1971 it had B.S. and Ph.D. programs. One reason 
it successfully existed as a stand-alone department so long was the vision and lead­
ership of several of the early leaders of the campus, including the Founding Chair, 
Julian Feldman and Fred Tonge.
Starting in the fall of 1963, Crosland began searching for a director of the new 
program. While attending a professional meeting in Chicago to scout out possible 
recruits, she and her team heard a scientist named Vladimir Slamecka present a 
paper on the theory of information classification by computer and were impressed 
by his vision for information science. After he finished, the four approached him, 
explained what they were doing, and invited him to visit campus. He only vaguely 
knew where Atlanta was (he had never been south of Washington D.C.), he had 
never heard of Georgia Tech, and had no particular interest in moving since he was 
a leader in a very early startup that was rapidly expanding (Documation). Undeterred, 
Crosland persevered and eventually convinced him to visit Tech in April 1964.
He visited for three days and gave several lectures, meeting a number of people. 
Although he found the new activity and the campus interesting, he was not

22
motivated to move because he was earning a good salary where he was and had a 
young family to support. He was quite impressed by the proposed program’s inno­
vativeness, however, and surprised that a school like Tech was the first in the world 
to propose it (this assertion is taken from descriptions of his reactions; there were 
certainly other schools involved in advancing information science, but I am unaware 
of any that had proposed an M.S. similar to the one at Tech). He thought highly of 
engineering schools since they did something very concrete, a mindset that must 
have resulted from his earlier professional training and activities. On the third day 
as he was preparing to leave, he mentioned to Dorothy Crosland that he had not 
been able to meet the President. In typical fashion, she arranged for Slamecka to 
meet President Harrison immediately and personally took him to the President’s 
office. In introducing them, she indicated that she wanted him to be the Director of 
the new information science program, and then left them alone.
Slamecka reported back to Crosland after his interview with President Harrison 
that he knew they would never pay the salary he asked for and indicated he needed 
in order to move since the President has indicated he could not agree to Slamecka’s 
request. Determined to not let this promising candidate get away, she picked up the 
phone and called the president. Two hours later they were invited back to the presi­
dent’s office where Harrison offered Slamecka the job of Director at the higher 
salary he had previously mentioned to Crosland. This was the deciding factor for 
him and after discussing it with his wife, they moved to Atlanta where he took over 
as Founding Director in the summer of 1964.
Crosland’s collaborators had already started to offer a few courses in the new 
school, and had recruited a few students to pursue the first majors in Information 
Science (IS). Those efforts, now bolstered by the assured funding from NSF, led to 
obtaining Regents’ approval in early December 1964 to offer a degree in Information 
Science.

Once Slamecka was hired and set up on campus, Crosland stepped back and let 
him build the School of Information Science as he saw fit. Although she did not 
interfere and only occasionally had to help him, it is reported that creating the 
School of Information Science was one of her proudest achievements.

Going Beyond Instrumental Computing

2.2
Slamecka led the new School of Information Science from Fall 1964 until Spring 
1978. Under his leadership, the breadth, depth, and innovation in curriculum and 
research, the spirit of interdisciplinary and international interactions, the emphasis 
on combining education with impactful research, and the goal of hiring the best 
faculty available were all initiated. At the time not only the general topic, but many 
of the characteristics listed above were unknown or not widely practiced at Tech. As 
noted in Chapter 1, in the mid-1960s, Tech was still largely a regional undergradu­
ate, engineering teaching school. The growth to a modern research university had 
barely begun and thus the new school can be seen as an early leader in that movement.
Slamecka was a builder and recognized the opportunity to create a unique pro­
gram on the ground-breaking work of Crosland and her collaborators in starting 
academic computing on campus. Although the new program was largely unrecog­
nized on campus (“benign neglect,” as he once remarked), his acceptance of the 
opportunity at Tech was one of those fortunate events that eventually led to the

the profound difference that forward-looking people can make in the development 
of an academic unit.

When he arrived at Georgia Tech, Slamecka had no permanent faculty, no 
courses, and almost no support from the administration or other units—but by being 
largely neglected he was able in the ensuing years to develop the School without 
much interference. At the same time, there were numerous students clamoring to 
enroll so he needed to create a curriculum and hire faculty quickly.
Fortuitously, he had read and resonated strongly with the prescient vision laid out 
by Vannevar Bush in his famous 1945 Atlantic Monthly article that very accurately 
envisioned today’s internet-connected, information-rich world. Slamecka used that 
as a guide to develop a comprehensive curriculum rapidly. While most leaders in 
computing were at least aware of the Vannevar Bush article and some were, in

effect, working to make his technical predictions come true, few, if any, explicitly 
used it as a framework since it is largely an aspirational piece that does not prescribe 
a specific curriculum. In particular, using it as the conceptual basis for the organiza­
tion of a new curriculum and the associated faculty research themes was apparently 
rare, if not unique.
This planted the seeds at Tech for the future breadth of the CoC and its leadership 
in information-centric areas, coupled with technology leadership, to enable the real­
ization of human-centered systems and much more. Pete Jensen, who served as my 
first Associate Dean, was the primary carrier of those seeds into the 1990s. I will 
have more to say below on the importance of his contributions as well as the con­
tinuing dichotomy between information science and computer science.
There were three main themes to Slamecka’s curriculum that can still be seen in 
the College today, albeit in vastly more complexity: the design of information sys­
tems, the design of computer systems, and the theories that underlie these two activ­
ities (which formed the foundation for the first IS Ph.D. program). With a framework 
for the curriculum, he then had a plan to guide hiring permanent faculty to augment 
the few people already on campus (mostly in the Rich Computer Center) who were 
already teaching beginning and/or applications courses on computing.

Vladimir “Vlad” Slamecka (1928–2006) was born in Brno, Moravia, Czech 
Republic. A student during WW II, he was studying chemical engineering in 
1948 when the communists took over. Because of his political leanings, he 
was forced out of the university and escaped to Austria where he lived in a 
displaced persons camp for two years. He made his way to Australia, spent a 
year in a hospital recovering from a skiing accident, and would have been 
deported except for the graces of one of his doctors who was also a war-­
survivor. After completing his studies in Australia he moved to Munich and 
worked as an engineer (coauthoring nine patents for engineering innova­
tions). He studied sociology and eventually was able to come to America. He 
earned a Doctorate in Library Science at Columbia in 1962 and then worked 
for an early startup—Documentation, Inc.—as research director. He had 
interest in and experience ranging from hardware design to formal logic to 
the architecture of information systems in the broadest possible sense. His 
personal story is fascinating and partially documented in his own words in 
the video interview referenced below.
2.3  The Slamecka Era (1964–1978)

26
Both continued as faculty until after the founding of CoC and, in Goda’s case, 
well into its second decade. He had taught at the University of Massachusetts before 
coming to Tech where he then taught for 30 years. He was a mainstay of teaching of 
lower-level courses, but did not participate heavily in research activities. Early in his 
career he was voted by the students as the Teacher of the Year at Tech.
Pranas Zunde (1923–2004) had been a researcher at Documentation, Inc., the 
company in Washington where Slamecka was director of research before coming to 
Tech. He matriculated in Industrial Engineering since there was not yet a Ph.D. pro­
gram in information science, but the Industrial Engineering School permitted Zunde 
to fashion his own interdisciplinary study program.
After finishing his thesis, he became an Associate Professor of Industrial 
Engineering and served as the director of the Systems Engineering interdisciplinary 
program. The IE School soon changed its name to the current Industrial and Systems 
Engineering (ISyE) School largely on the basis of the great student interest shown 
in the systems program innovated by Zunde. He later worked solely in the School of 
Information and Computer Science (ICS), retiring from CoC in 1992.
Growth of the program in IS, driven by student demand, was strong. By the fall 
of 1966 there were 25 MS students enrolled and by 1970 this number grew to 100. 
The faculty had to develop courses almost as they were given; Zunde, for example, 
was credited with developing eighteen courses himself! Demand for courses in 
computer science also built rapidly and by 1968 there were fourteen undergraduate 
and twenty-one graduate courses in computer science listed.
To augment the faculty engaged in research, Slamecka invited a series of promi­
nent researchers in information science from around the world to visit and present 
lectures, short courses, and intensive courses. Among these during the late 60s, were 
a number of cyberneticists (apparently in Slamecka’s view cybernetics was at the 
intersection of information science and systems theory). This not only rapidly 
spread the word that something new and ambitious was happening at Georgia Tech, 
but began to create a spirit of basic research and outreach. Initial collaborations 
were also set up with several foreign universities.

… [the] place was conceived not as an academic department so much as a think tank. … 
The people that founded the School had in mind that there would be an amalgamation of 
disciplines that would treat various aspects of information. … a place where people were 
really interested in finding out what the important questions were. … We had philosophers, 
linguists, logicians, numerical analysts … but not many engineers. … we were just turned 
loose on everything from formal logic to cognitive science. … We had to make sense of it.
An NSF grant of over $1.3 million (close to $10 million today) to create a com­
puter lab was soon awarded, one of the first two grants in the country for that

purpose. Jensen joined the faculty full-time as a lecturer in 1967 and brought with 
him his interest in making computers usable for a wide range of applications as well 
as his expertise in hardware, timesharing, networking, and applications usability. 
He created the first student computer lab on campus utilizing the funds from NSF 
and continued to build and operate the computing infrastructure of the School for a 
number of years. With the new funding, Slamecka was able to obtain space in the 
D.M. Smith building for the School by 1969; in 1974 the School moved to the 
Skiles Building, where some faculty and graduate students already had space. The 
stay there (at that time home of the Rich Computer Center) was brief because by 
1976 the School was housed in the Rich Computer Center, where it stayed until 1989.
The early research activity in the School of Information Science, driven by fac­
ulty and Slamecka’s interests, was in the mainstream of information science work at 
the time. Prominent among these activities was a strong commitment to linguistics. 
Beginning with Jimmy Gough, a member of the original “shared” faculty (he had 
been on the faculty of Modern Languages since 1957), and later supplemented by 
Dave Krause and David Rogers—all noted linguists, a strong computational lin­
guistics program was launched attracting several Ph.D. students. After he left Tech 
in (1972) Krause went to the National Library of Medicine, where he led its linguis­
tics group for many years. Ultimately, however, IS’s broad program atrophied as the 
faculty moved on (or back) to their primary departments and the School increas­
ingly focused on mainstream computer science.

In 1969–1970, an undergraduate curriculum was developed in response to 
increasing student demand and campus approval to offer a BS was sought. 
Unfortunately, the School of Electrical Engineering blocked approval, even though 
they expressed no interest in mounting such a program themselves; after a year they 
relented and permitted the proposed major to proceed. Turf wars are a staple of 
organizational life, especially academic organizations it seems. In this case, it didn’t 
ultimately have much impact on the growing strength of the School of ICS except 
to emphasize that it was something new in the academic pantheon. It was a missed 
opportunity of the Electrical Engineering School and the College of Engineering, 
which they realized 15 years later by adding “Computer” to the name of the School 
of Electrical Engineering.
2.3.2  1970–1978: Increasing Interest in Computer Science
Although it was not to the liking of some of the IS faculty, in 1970 the name of the 
School was changed to Information and Computer Science (ICS) in recognition of 
the increasing demand of students for computer science courses and a national trend 
evident at many other leading universities. While approval of a B.S. degree was still 
pending, an interdisciplinary minor in ICS was started to accommodate stu­
dent demand.
The 1970–1971 academic year saw the granting of the first Ph.D. in Information 
Science at Georgia Tech to Jesse Hubbard Poore (1942–2012)11 in September 1970 
(see also Chapter 3). In early 1971 two more Ph.D.’s in IS were granted—the last 
two since future degrees were in Information and Computer Science until the CoC 
was founded. In the 1971–1972 academic year the first Ph.D.’s. in ICS were granted 
to Robert Charles Roehrkasse and the second to Richard DeMillo, future 
dean of CoC.
By 1973, ICS was the largest graduate program at Georgia Tech, quite an achieve­
ment for a new unit that 10 years earlier didn’t exist! At the same time, it under­
scores the largely undergraduate nature of Tech at that time—a condition that the 
new President, Joseph M. Petitt, was about to change (see Chapter 3). That year ICS 
also started offering a joint graduate degree program in Biomedical Information and 
Computer Science that was developed with Emory University’s School of Medicine. 
This collaboration was unique for its time, and presaged further cooperation between 
the two institutions in this and other areas in the years to come. It attracted a young 
graduate student, Craig Mundie, later Chief Architect of Microsoft and a supporter 
of CoC to this day. Unfortunately, the program suffered under a variety of organiza­
tional problems and was eventually discontinued, causing Mundie to leave.

Albert Badre, trained at the University of Michigan, was a very early leader in 
Human-Computer Interactions (HCI), organizing influential meetings and publica­
tions, starting Tech on the road to its current preeminence in the field. His early 
research, connections, prominence, and teaching played a key part in attracting oth­
ers in the field later, including Janet Kolodner and Jim Foley (both discussed in later 
chapters). Remembering his days as an early faculty member, Badre noted that it 
seemed to be a very congenial group of faculty that often met for lunch or coffee at 
the faculty club.

tools, databases. and theory. This effort, supported over the next 15 years by several 
large grants, laid a foundation for the development of several significant systems-­
related research programs within the School of ICS and the College and was a 
strong influence in hiring a number of future faculty leaders. It also produced sev­
eral strong advanced degree holders who went on to play leading roles in places 
such as Intel, Microsoft, E-Systems, and Boeing.
DeMillo and Enslow worked to get Tech involved in networking at this time and 
were involved in the meeting at which the hourglass shape of the basic Internet 
architecture was decided on. DeMillo was later one of four PIs (along with Dick 
Lipton, a future CoC faculty member) on the proposal to create TheoryNet—the 
forerunner of CSNet, NSFNET, and the public Internet of today. In May 1979, 
DeMillo and Enslow represented Tech at the meeting that led to the creation of 
CSNet; at that meeting they chose the name “gatech” for the primary domain name 
for Georgia Tech. Lack of campus resources, however, prevented Tech from partici­
pating further in spite of their efforts. Georgia Tech eventually joined CSNet in the 
spring of 1982.
Looking back from the vantage point of 50 years later, it is easy to see that 
Slamecka was correct in holding to the vision that computing would go in the direc­
tion of focusing on information and its use, not only on the computer systems that 
processed it. However, in the 1970s, computer science in its more technical interpre­
tation was growing rapidly, led by Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Stanford and a number of 
other schools including the University of Pennsylvania, Purdue, and Utah. At the 
same time, the long process (still not nearly finished) of putting computation in the 
broadest sense on a firmer theoretical basis, was taking hold.
Slamecka believed firmly that information was the scientifically more interesting 
area; he felt computers, while important, were not as interesting as objects of study. 
Intellectually, that point of view is arguably correct. However, as a matter of market 
demand, an important factor for most universities especially public schools, com­
puter science was and still is the dominant subject. Slamecka recognized that when 
he changed the name of the School in 1970. To be able to offer the courses of inter­
est to undergraduates and accommodate the research interests of graduate students, 
the faculty he hired in the 1970s were almost all computing oriented.
The newer faculty he hired moved the School toward computer science and 
began vocally advocating that he hire additional computer scientists. This created a 
rift in the faculty of ICS and eventually prompted him to step down as Director in 
the spring of 1978. Whether he was pushed out or simply came to the conclusion 
that he had done all he could do as Director is unknown. However, few organiza­
tional leaders in the same position for almost 15 years, during a period of great 
change both internally and externally to the organization and in the environment in 
which it is operating, leave without leaving behind a good deal of dissatisfaction 
with what they are doing and/or how they do it. It is thus no surprise that Slamecka’s 
time as Director came to a close suddenly and apparently in the midst of a lot of 
internal strife. I have heard from some that were present at Tech then, as well as 
from external visitors during the time, that that was the case with Slamecka’s 
departure.

32
He returned to the faculty and for the next 10 years focused on information sci­
ence and the establishment of important, practical information policies and systems 
in a number of countries abroad. He was recognized internationally for his contribu­
tions to and knowledge of information science and authored the definitive 
Encyclopedia Britannica article on the subject that is kept current by others to this 
day. I benefited from his breath and vision in several visits with him during my time 
as Dean. He was a gracious gentleman of another time, yet entirely supportive of the 
College and the direction in which we were heading. In 1988, he retired but contin­
ued his professional activities until just a few years before his death in 2006.
2.4  Summary
The early days of computing at Georgia Tech were not unlike those at other leading 
schools—early adoption of computers for instrumental computing; development of 
centralized, campus computing centers; initial uncertainty as to whether or not com­
puters afforded a new subject for study or were simply a tool; slow development of 
academic computing that initially, in a few cases, was focused more on information 
science; and the emergence around 1970 of computer science as the name and focus 
for academic computing. What was unusual for Georgia Tech, however, was that it 
was very early in this progression compared to many other good schools.
The vision of Dorothy Crosland led to the creation of one of the very first aca­
demic computing departments in the country; without her, Tech would most likely 
have been a laggard in the area of academic computing. Her intuition in hiring 
Vladimir Slamecka and good management sense in leaving him alone to develop a 
group without much interference were then key.
Vladimir Slamecka in his 15 years in a leadership position at Tech clearly left an 
innovative and indelible mark: Almost single-handedly he implemented academic 
computing at Georgia Tech, hired and led strong faculty and staff that then created 
three degree programs in remarkably short time. He also had the wisdom to allow 
computer science to flourish even though that was not his primary interest. His lead­
ership and hard work established at a critical juncture the understanding on campus 
that computers not only were good for instrumental computing, but that academi­
cally rigorous computing courses could be taught and that serious-minded research­
ers from around the world were willing to engage as peers with Tech’s small but 
growing cohort of computing faculty. That legacy set the tone for what was to come.

There was the initiation of serious scholarship into the nature of information and 
its manipulation, some gradual growth in the number of computer science-oriented 
faculty, intellectual ferment engendered by a stream of prominent visitors, and the 
rising demand by students for courses in computer science. At the same time, the 
School of ICS lacked real strength in the discipline of computer science that was 
rapidly evolving nationally as a discipline in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a dis­
cipline that was exercising strong leadership at other leading technical universities 
including MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford. Slamecka, to his credit, acquiesced 
to these imperatives and made several key hires that formed the basis of a strong 
computer science group at Georgia Tech.

computers as an instrument (tool) from the academic activity of studying and teaching about com­

3.1  Growth of Research at Georgia Tech
The appointment of Joseph M. Pettit as president of Georgia Tech in 1972 marked 
the beginning of a major transition from a regional, undergraduate-focused school 
to one with a strong research presence on the national scene. The change, which 
pre-dated Pettit’s term, was fairly slow for a variety of reasons that are not central to 
the story here. Pettit, however, was the first President to undertake a broad improve­
ment in the faculty that included more emphasis on research and on research-based 
topics in the curricula across Engineering. His early efforts met a good bit of resis­
tance from the faculty and alumni as well as budgetary difficulties, but by 1980 it 
was beginning to take effect as new faculty were hired, bringing new ideas and 
interests to the campus. Based on objectively observable measures, the improve­
ments were impressive—the number of faculty with doctorates was 77% by 1975, 
compared to 51% 10 years earlier, and research funding in the academic units more 
than tripled between 1971 and 1976.
2
As far as computing was concerned, the fact that the ICS department was largely 
ignored on campus organizationally (but not by the students!) permitted it to grow 
and set its own course more or less unimpeded. The College of Engineering at that 
time was dominant on campus and it had no desire to add the new School to its 
roster; the School of Electrical Engineering (EE) in particular, which would have 
been the natural place to house IS, indicated it had absolutely no interest in comput­
ers (a serious strategic mistake on its part). The General College (as it was called in 
the early 1970s), which housed Mathematics and the traditional sciences agreed to 
take the IS School, but without any promise of resources since IS was a graduate-­
only school and at the time Georgia Tech was an undergraduate-focused institution. 
Emblematic of this “benign neglect,” the entire School (Slamecka and a secretary) 
was housed in one room in the basement of the new Van Leer Building (the 
home of EE).
At the same time, there was some interaction between individual faculty and 
students in ICS and those in other units on campus, but little or no organizational 
cooperation or recognition; I have no information as to whether or not other schools 
on campus even acknowledged the need for expert instruction in computing for their 
students. Emblematic of the near-invisibility of the School of Information and

Computer Science (ICS) and computing in general is the fact that in the index to 
McMath, et al., (an otherwise rather complete and competent history of the first 
century of Georgia Tech) there is no mention of ICS, Slamecka, or computers other 
than the dedication of the Rich Computer Center—although it did list the “machines” 
installed in the new building.

3.2  Transition to Next ICS Director
After Vladimir Slamecka stepped down rather suddenly as ICS Director at the end 
of Winter Quarter 1978, President Petitt appointed a senior faculty from the English 
Department to take over ICS administratively for a few months. Lucio Chiaraviglio 
(1926–2016) was then appointed Interim Director of ICS later that year, a role he 
continued to fill ably for the next 2 years while a national search for a new Director 
was conducted. One of the first things he did was to establish a very open and par­
ticipatory management style by having an open-door policy so that anyone could 
come to talk to him and add items to the agendas at monthly faculty meetings and 
speak—a new experience for ICS.
Chiaraviglio was trained as a mathematician, specializing in mathematical logic. 
He was one of the first faculty members hired (in 1968) by Slamecka to oversee the 
development and operation of the new Ph.D. program. He was a very student-­
oriented and dedicated academic, as well as a gentleman of the old

school—courteous, friendly, always sincere, and a dapper dresser. One of his first 
graduate students was Rich DeMillo, later an ICS faculty member. He was also an 
able administrator, not only as Acting Director for 2 years but then as Associate 
Director under Miller and later overseeing the undergraduate program for the first 
2 years of the College of Computing. Lucio retired in 1992 and remained in touch 
with some of his students and former colleagues until his death in 2016.
As a search for a new director proceeded, Rich DeMillo called Ray Miller, a 
noted mathematician/computer scientist at IBM Research with whom DeMillo had 
published, to encourage him to apply for the open Director position. Miller 
demurred, noting that he was quite happy where he was and had no desire to move. 
After repeated urging by DeMillo, Nancy Lynch, and Dick Lipton (at Princeton, 
another colleague of DeMillo’s and Miller’s) he was eventually convinced to visit 
Georgia Tech to give a talk “just for a visit.” DeMillo asked Miller for his CV and 
when Miller was on campus he was “interviewed” and after another visit or two, he 
was offered the job without ever actually applying.
Miller notes that he was quite happy at IBM but that after 30 years there in the 
same organization, he found that the task of building a new, quality academic 
department presented an interesting new challenge. After negotiations with IBM for 
a leave so that he had a position to return to if he found that the Directorship was not 
well-suited to him, he began negotiations with Georgia Tech. Included in those 
negotiations was the requirement that every faculty member in ICS would have a 
computer terminal in their office that would be connected to the main campus com­
puter. This was unheard of at Tech at that time (and most other campuses as well, 
and even IBM). According to Miller it was “met with all kinds of wonder by oth­
ers!” but Miller insisted and when that requirement as well as funding and space for 
additional faculty were granted, he accepted the position in August 1980. He imme­
diately made Chiaraviglio Associate Director and in Miller’s words he was 
“invaluable.”

When Miller joined Tech, he had several years of practical experience with the 
U.S. Air Force and over 20 years of experience at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Lab, 
at the time considered one of the premier computing research labs in the world. 
When hired he was asked by President Joseph Pettit to create a strong computer 
science program and was offered substantial support by Dean Henry Valk; this was 
the first recorded expectation from the Tech Administration to the Director of ICS 
since the original mandate 16 years earlier given to Slamecka by Crosland.

5 There is an interesting parallel in this story to my own experience coming to Georgia Tech 
10 years later, effectively as Miller’s successor. The conditions that caused President Crecine to 
make me an Acting VP of Information Technology in 1991 in addition to my day job as Dean of 
Computing were different, but the software development situation in the Rich Computer Center in 
1991 was eerily similar. I had known Ray Miller since the late 1960’s but had not been in close 
touch with him when he was Director of ICS. Had I known how he handled a situation very similar 
to what I found, the outcome of the project I inherited in 1991 might have been better!
3.3  The Miller Era (1980–1987)

38
Miller was highly respected in the computing field, had edited the premier 
Journal of the ACM, and had spent most of his career as a researcher. He helped 
create and was the first chairman of the ACM Special Interest Group on Automata 
and Computability Theory (SIGACT). His research reputation brought a measure of 
respectability to ICS which had been considered a “bit quirky” previously. Miller 
recalls in his memoir that when he came “ICS had a large number of undergraduate 
majors, a healthy master’s program, a small PhD program, and offered almost no 
service courses.” He also found that many of the students counted as Ph.D. students 
were no longer enrolled or active. So, the stage was set for him to build up the 
school in the more technical aspects of computing research.
Besides spending time getting the campus payroll system revision back on track, 
during his first year Miller identified the major problems in ICS and worked with 
Chiaraviglio to devise strategies and plans to work on them.
He also spent a good bit of time getting to know other leaders on campus and 
understanding the nature of the different schools in the larger colleges—Engineer­
ing and COSALS (College of Science and Liberal Studies, in which ICS resided). 
The Dean of Engineering, Bill Sangster, broadly and frequently hinted that “ICS 
would be welcome in Engineering,” to which Miller wisely replied each time 
“That’s not my decision to make, Bill” because he knew that most of the ICS faculty 
would be adamantly opposed to such a move. He also discovered that the other units 
in COSALS tended to have few majors and offer many service courses, as opposed 
to ICS which had the converse. The dean of COSALS when Miller joined was 
Henry Valk, who was very supportive of Miller and ICS, but he stepped down soon 
after Miller joined. His replacement was Les Karlovitz, a mathematician, whose 
views of computers may have differed from Valk’s and Miller’s.
The most pressing issue for ICS was to expand the faculty with additional 
computing-­focused faculty. The demand for computing faculty in the 1980s far 
exceeded the supply so that faculty recruiting was very difficult. Janet Kolodner, a 
future leader in the College, as well as in AI, cognitive science, and the learning 
Raymond E. “Ray” Miller (1928–2019) grew up in Wisconsin, majored in 
Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin, and joined IBM in 
1950. He was assigned to a computer project, served in the Air Force during 
the Korean War, and afterwards was given leave by IBM to attend graduate 
school at the University of Illinois. He earned his Ph.D. in 1957 and joined 
IBM Research where he worked until 1980. He was very active professionally, 
including holding several national leadership positions. During the 
1987–88 year while on sabbatical, he was offered a new research leadership 
position in Maryland that he eventually accepted. He remained actively affili­
ated with the University of Maryland until retiring in 2002, but frequented his 
office there until 2018. His 50-year career in computing is one of the longest, 
most impactful, and varied in the field. His memoir is referenced below.

sciences, joined the faculty in late 1980; although she had been recruited earlier that 
year before Miller came, he insured that she had the startup resources needed. The 
next thing that Miller did was to recommend both tenure and promotion to Full for 
Professor Pete Jensen in recognition of his long and valuable service, even though 
he did not have an advanced degree; it was granted by the Regents.
­
­

While managing the flood of undergraduates, Miller also undertook to improve 
the quality and size of the Ph.D. program by increasing research facilities and funds 
to attract graduate students and to enable their research work. An important part of 
his focus on the Ph.D. program was his encouragement and assistance to faculty to 
obtain external funding for their research.
Also in 1981–82, Martin McKendry joined the faculty and the distributed sys­
tems research group. He was an innovative systems researcher who, working with 
Jim Allchin, his first Ph.D. student, conceived an approach to distributed operating 
systems that they named Clouds. Their concept became the basis for further work 
on the Clouds system involving several other faculty members over the next decade 
including Rich LeBlanc and Kishore Ramachandran. Allchin later led the Platform 
Division of Microsoft where he oversaw development of multiple versions of 
Windows’ products. Yousef Khalidi (a student of Ramachandran) was among the 
next generation of Clouds Ph.D. students. He went to Sun Microsystems after grad­
uation and later joined Microsoft to play a major role in the development of Azure. 
Gene Spafford, a student co-advised by McKendry and Partha Dasgupta, as well as 
Phil Enslow, also came out of the distributed systems group in the early 1980s and 
quickly became one of the best-known authorities in cybersecurity.

3.3  The Miller Era (1980–1987)

40
The Clouds project anchored the reputation of ICS and later CoC as a significant 
player in systems research. Those students plus several from the Slamecka era, 
including M.S. Students Craig Mundie (entrepreneur and then Senior VP and Chief 
Architect of Microsoft) and Marshall Williamson (E-Systems Chief Engineer), and, 
and others from the 1980s including Edith Martin-Boeing VP, Tim Saponas (student 
of Enslow)—Intel head of university relations, and David Aucsmith (head of com­
puter security for Intel and later Microsoft), all helped build the reputation of the 
College as a place that produced high-quality students through the research projects 
and guidance of the faculty.
It is not my intention, nor ability, to name and track all of the CoC students that 
have gone on to major leadership positions in the powerhouses of computing in 
industry at an earlier stage. I do so here to illustrate the importance of graduates of 
a program through their work and careers to building the knowledge of academic 
computing broadly outside the university where they studied; thus building the rep­
utation of the university as well as of the individuals. One can identify similar exam­
ples at other universities.
All of those named above have in one or more ways not only shown to the world 
what was happening at Tech by their actions, but by in most cases giving back to the 
College. The same has continued to happen. As the academic reputation of the fac­
ulty has grown over time, their students have begun to assume major positions of 
technical and organizational leadership in academia as well as industry—the next 
stage, at least for the College of Computing, in ascending as a group to a position of 
prominence nationally and beyond.
Another important event in 1981–1982 was that Janet Kolodner (one of the fac­
ulty that helped build the academic reputation of the College), with Larry Barsalou 
of Emory, started an Atlanta-wide cognitive science group that increased awareness 
of the subject at Tech. This, too, was a forerunner of a substantial amount of cogni­
tive science-based research by members of the CoC faculty in later years.
The expanding size of ICS faculty, students, and research soon resulted in an 
expansion of the school from the basement of the Rich Building to the first floor in 
1983, greatly improving the attractiveness to potential faculty recruits of joining 
ICS. Rich DeMillo established the Software Engineering Research Center (SERC) 
in 1984 to support a large DoD contract in software testing and evaluation that he 
directed from 1981 to 1987, when he moved to the faculty at Purdue. The Center 
later spawned the Center for Information Management Research (CIMR) in 1989, 
an NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) directed by 
Mike McCracken, a long-time Research Faculty member. Both SERC and CIMR 
lasted well into the 1990s.
Over the next three academic years ICS continued evolving, but it was clear that 
they needed more and better space for labs, faculty offices, and staff. As Miller aptly 
describes, getting more and/or better space is perhaps the hardest resource to obtain 
at a university. Miller and Chiaraviglio worked hard on plans for a new building and 
the justifications for it to house ICS. Finally, around 1985 they succeeded in their 
“space wars” and the Institute hired an architect for a new building to house ICS, the

Computer Engineering faculty from EE, and (because of the dire need for new space 
on campus) freshman chemistry labs. The building opened in 1989 (just after Miller 
left to assume a professorship at the University of Maryland and a leadership posi­
tion in a nearby NASA laboratory).
3.2
­
Today, the College (and some related, CoC-led, multi-disciplinary labs) occupy 
the entire building as well as major parts of at least three other large buildings on 
campus. The growth of that physical footprint mirrors the growth in faculty, stu­
dents, and staff as we shall see in later chapters. Once planning and actual construc­
tion started, Miller could again focus on hiring faculty.

7 A few years ago when I chaired an advisory board at George Mason University, where he was 
president at the time, he told me that his favorite places as a student was in the CoC labs of 
Kolodner, Ashwin Ram, and GVU. This was in line with the earlier vision of Slamecka of broad 
and interdisciplinary leadership on campus, as well as providing an excellent complement to the 
more technical aspects of ICS.
 
 
3  Adding the Keystone (1978–1987)

43
As Miller left for a year’s sabbatical (officially, a leave of absence with partial 
pay) in the summer of 1987, the building he had enabled was under early stages of 
construction and the young faculty were busy starting their careers. The campus was 
preparing for the arrival of a new president just chosen in April 1987 to replace the 
late Joe Pettit and serious proposals were being developed to expand and update the 
undergraduate curriculum across campus.
Whether or not Pettit’s condition prior to his death suggested to Miller that an 
inevitable change of senior leadership might be a good time to step down is not 
known, but it might have played into what appeared to be his unexpected decision. 
In his memoir, he notes that he felt that he had achieved what he set out to do—cre­
ate a strong computer science group at Georgia Tech—and that it was time after 
6 years for someone else to take over.

3.4  Summary
Miller’s indispensable contribution was to build a strong base of core computer sci­
ence faculty, oversee dramatic strengthening of the Ph.D. program, encourage a 
major increase in research activity, build the on-campus reputation of ICS by his 
campus service and personal integrity, successfully argue for and help design a 
major new building for ICS, and tie the school more firmly into the developing, 
national computer science research community. He did this in just 7 years and with­
out destroying the roots of, at the time, outlier parts of computer science (AI and 
HCI) or information science. AI and HCI, along with other fields, have grown in 
importance over the years. On the other hand, Information Science, as an academic 
discipline at Tech died out with the eventual retirements of Slamecka, Chiaraviglio, 
and Zunde; others of that group moved on to other positions and other fields of 
study. A similar story played out elsewhere as computer science and its direct cous­
ins have come to dominate. Nonetheless, traces of the original objectives still exist, 
8 Changing leadership of a group fairly often is a frequent protocol in large organizations to expose 
rising employees to different aspects of the business, as well as for the vitality of the organization 
being managed. I received similar advice of ‘Don’t stay for more than 5–6 years’ from one of my 
mentors, the late Erich Bloch (1925–2016) as I started at Georgia Tech in 1990. I suspect that 
Miller also had learned that important lesson from his time at IBM, known for its management 
training.

notably in today’s I-schools that combine library science, information science, and 
computer science in various proportions.
Research expenditures grew to between $2–3 M/year and the total number of 
active Ph.D. students grew from ~25 to ~75, most of them supported with assistant­
ships. The faculty he hired and encouraged, the structural changes he made, and the 
increased resources of money and space that he obtained laid the strong technical 
and organizational foundation on which the College of Computing was created.
The next chapter describes some of the turmoil that ensued with the transition to 
the new President and ICS’ expanded role in it.

The 3 years between spring 1987 and spring 1990 saw two seminal activities at 
Georgia Tech involving ICS that resulted in the creation of the College of 
Computing—a change in the senior leadership of Georgia Tech and then a major 
campus reorganization in which a college focused on computing was a new and 
primary element.

Four months after arriving on campus, Crecine appointed a special, Institute-­
wide Task Force to provide critical academic leadership over “the next two to four 
years” as a previously planned (by President Pettit and Acting President Bourne 
after Pettit’s death) faculty expansion brought new faculty to campus. The Task 
Force represented a cross-section of campus and began meeting in early 1988.

President Crecine stepped down as President in mid-1994 due to lack of support. 
His time as President, while often contentious, was eventually judged by almost all 
as one of the most impactful and successful presidential tenures in Georgia Tech’s 
history. He then engaged in several entrepreneurial efforts but had little or no con­
tact with campus and eventually moved. Away, he did participate in a tenth 
Anniversary Celebration of the Founding of the College of Computing. As a long-­
time friend and colleague, I spent a long afternoon and evening with him in his 
home in Pittsburgh, PA just 3 weeks before he passed away from cancer in 2008, 
reminiscing about his time at Tech and the success of the College. As I departed, he 
said very simply but with great feeling that starting the College was one of his two 
or three greatest achievements.

[I]f you know the rate of change of technology and its expanding role in society, then 
Georgia Tech and other technological institutions must adapt to change to merely survive. 
I want Georgia Tech to do more than merely survive. I want Georgia Tech to thrive, and 
continue to contribute to broader goals.
Most who heard this speech and other less formal remarks he made from the start 
of his tenure quickly knew that he intended to change and modernize the intellectual 
and organizational structure of the campus. A few astute observers at the time 
assumed he had in mind, among other changes, creating something along the lines 
of the College of Computing when they heard this line emphasized later in the 
same speech:
There will be no great 21st Century university without a great computing and information 
environment.
As plans for a reorganization became apparent a few months later, their assump­
tions were confirmed. From my frequent interactions with Crecine, Miriam Drake 
(the Librarian at the time), and all of the top leaders of Georgia Tech over the suc­
ceeding few years, I believe that Crecine understood that any library, most espe­
cially a research library, must change in order to provide the information environment 
the future will demand and intended that the Georgia Tech Library should be a 
leader in that. Miriam Drake tried hard to bring that part of Crecine’s vision to frui­
tion, but in spite of her excellent efforts, I don’t believe that most others understood 
and as a result the modernization of the Library never had the level of attention that 
the College of Computing enjoyed.
The Task Force created in late December 1987 met ten times by July 1988 and 
drafted a document entitled “Opportunities for Enhancing Georgia Tech’s Stature as 
a Technological University.” It proposed two groups of three areas each that could 
be targeted to help improve Tech: The first group would need additional resources 
and included biotechnology, computational science, and material science; the sec­
ond group included art, humanities, and manufacturing.
At about the same time, the dean and senior faculty of the College of Management 
developed a reorganization plan that focused on strengthening the humanities and 
social sciences, as well as raising the profile of Management. A second, intense

discussion among Crecine and a very small group of his closest advisors and admin­
istrators took place on a very long plane ride a short time later.
All of this resulted in a reorganization plan from Crecine to be presented to an 
open meeting of the faculty on Friday, July 29, 1988—a time when many faculty 
were away or focused on their research. On short notice Crecine asked the newly 
appointed (but long-time Georgia Tech administrator) Executive Vice President 
Tom Stelson to make the presentation since Crecine would be out of town then and 
over the weekend. Because the presentation was not made by Crecine himself, even 
though it was quite evident that it was his plan, and apparently made in a conde­
scending manner by Stelson, many members of the faculty were very upset.
Further, the issue of new resources was addressed by suggesting the reallocation 
of resources, not the injection of new resources. Worse, Crecine had made various 
remarks both privately and even in print that were considered to be demeaning of 
some aspects of Georgia Tech and its current faculty. Crecine released a memo, 
“Framework for Restructuring” the following week addressed to all faculty trying to 
explain better what he was trying to do.
The memo outlined Crecine’s plan: No changes to the Engineering and 
Architecture Colleges; creation of three new colleges—Sciences; Computing, 
Information, and Cognitive Science; a college of humanities, social sciences, and 
management; and a new “Division” with other units of campus-wide interest such 
as music. In point of fact, most of the elements of the plan were things that had had 
faculty input one way or the other over the past year, or longer. In the Framework 
memo Crecine emphasized that there would be an open and inclusive process. 
Unfortunately, by that point it was too late to avoid the uproar caused by the clumsy 
and ill-timed introduction of the Framework.
There was general faculty protest on campus on the procedural grounds that the 
faculty had not been consulted in advance, but more strenuously because many 
objected to some of the proposed changes on substantive grounds—including the 
elevation to college status of the small and seemingly insignificant ICS School 
(although that objection eventually paled compared to more vociferous objections 
over other elements). The Physics School was the first to loudly and publicly object. 
The College of Management later objected, perhaps most strongly of any, to the part 
of the proposal to combine them with a broader liberal arts college. In the process, 
the College of Management would be reduced to a School of Management along­
side other Schools, something not envisioned in a plan previously advanced by the 
College of Management Dean and senior faculty. There were also other parts of 
campus that didn’t see the need for changing the academic structure at all, or 
objected to the manner in which the planning was being carried out—or both!
Crecine set up ten Study Committees to study various aspects of what “a techni­
cal university for the 21st century” (a phrase that became his mantra) should be. 
One of these committees was charged with investigating whether GT should have a 
“College of Information, Computer, and Cognitive Sciences” and what it should 
contain in general. Pete Jensen (ICS) and Cecil Alford (EE) were chosen to co-chair 
the committee with LeBlanc, Enslow, and other ICS faculty included as members. 
The committee, composed of faculty from many areas of campus, discussed a

52
In addition to these recruiting and on-boarding activities, moving into the new 
building in fall 1989, and the rest of the routine business of the ICS School, the 
headline activity was the campus-wide reorganization led by President Crecine that 
resulted in the creation of the College of Computing on July 1, 1990.
6
A key insight of this report was captured in its description of the new discipline 
it called Computing as being composed of components with distinct roots in 
Mathematics, Science and Engineering. LeBlanc immediately recognized that the 
concept of computing was highly relevant to the ongoing discussions at Tech. He 
and Jensen then presented to the Tech committee this view of a new discipline as 
having many of the ideas that would achieve Crecine’s goal of a new college dedi­
cated to “Computing, Information, and Cognitive Science;” this led many of the 
members to accept the idea that it could be beneficial to have a computing-oriented 
college as a separate unit so as to encourage interdisciplinary activities equally with 
all other disciplines (a key element of the Denning report).
Ultimately, a decision was made in early 1989 to build the new college around 
just the School of ICS, to make interdisciplinary research a key part of its charter, 
and to call it the College of Computing. The name was chosen specifically to align

Alton P. “Pete” Jensen (1925–2005) was born in East Point, Georgia. He spent 
50+ years at Tech - starting as a student and formally finishing as the first 
Associate Dean of CoC. Even after “retirement” he continued to advise and 
mentor many of us, providing great insight and wisdom. Pete taught thousands 
of students and individually advised in meaningful ways scores of us. He tutored 
dozens of local entrepreneurs, legislators (including former Speaker Newt 
Gingrich, who spoke at his Memorial Service), and governors – which probably 
led to his working with President Carter. He engendered a lasting and deep 
respect from all with whom he had had more than casual contact. He was much 
more than the perfect steward of the transition from School to College – the 
impact of his life at Tech can still be plainly seen in the College today. His life is 
an avatar for Georgia Tech and the College of Computing – rooted in tradi­
tional beginnings, open to change, with the ability to see what would be impor­
tant in the future, and the skill to help steer all in that direction.

Denning committee (which was already receiving acceptance in the world of aca­
demic computing).
In the early fall of 1989, a Transition Committee, co-chaired by LeBlanc and Jim 
Craig (Aerospace Engineering), was set up “to make recommendations which could 
be used by the new College (and a dean not yet selected) as a guide during its forma­
tive stages.” The Committee had 15 members, including the Acting Dean of Science, 
Robert Pierotti, the Vice-President of Information Technology, “Bud” Suddath, four 
ICS faculty and nine others, representing eight different disciplines on campus plus 
a student representative.

This laid the groundwork and set the tone for later expansion. It is notable that 
several faculty members from other schools at Tech participated in positive and 
constructive roles on both the original, broader Study Committee and the Transition 
Committee set up to work out details. Their participation on the latter committee 
was a manifestation of the idea that interdisciplinary outreach was to be a key char­
acteristic of the College of Computing and added substantially to the commit­
tee’s report.

As Pat Crecine, the Georgia Tech president who hired me in 1990 said in making 
my offer of employment:
You are not going to own everything to do with computers on this campus, but I want you 
and your faculty to be involved in everything that is developing and using them.

8 As soon as the choice was announced, Ray Miller contacted me to encourage me to accept and 
offer his support. Although we had become acquainted many years earlier, this led to a personal 
friendship with numerous visits in the intervening years up until shortly before his demise.
4.3  Adding the First Level of Detail to the Vision

54
This concept set a challenging goal for us and became our defining mantra.
Over the next 2 months I began meeting frequently with Jensen and LeBlanc, all 
of the existing ICS faculty that were available that summer and many key players 
around campus, including other deans; directors of departments; key administrators 
of finance, development, and contracts; and some students. One was a just-­
graduating ICS undergrad, Charles Lee Isbell, who had been the student representa­
tive on the CoC Dean Search Committee and was on his way to MIT to enter their 
Ph.D. program—in an interesting turn of history, he became the fourth Dean of the 
College of Computing in 2019! The Georgia Tech administration began involving 
me in budgetary and other significant decisions immediately, showing strong sup­
port for me and the future of the College.
While the deliberations and report of the Transition Committee set the stage for 
what happened as I began assuming leadership in mid-1990 and provided the broad 
outlines of what we did over the next few years, in fact I did not receive the report 
until a number of key decisions were already being made. I do not recall ever explic­
itly referring to it. What happened in practice, as is so often the case in similar situ­
ations, is two things.
First, the concepts and general directions discussed and agreed upon by the 
Transition Committee had already been made visible to and internalized to a large 
extent by the ICS faculty and campus leaders more broadly. Second, this meant that 
my own ideas and sense of how to proceed even before I was hired, resonated so 
well with the environment I entered that I was able to proceed without feeling the 
need to sit down and try to meld my own inherent sense of direction with that 
expressed in words in the written document (which was probably one major reason 
I was hired).
In retrospect, several other factors were at play: Much of the general content had 
been communicated to me in a number of ways even during the interview process; 
Pete Jensen and Rich LeBlanc worked closely with me from the start (and through­
out my time as dean) to understand individual faculty as well as the campus in 
general, an extremely valuable acculturation process; I undertook an explicit listen­
ing tour as noted above to ask people’s views of what the College should be doing, 
seek their assistance when needed, and to introduce myself briefly; and finally, most 
ICS faculty were glad to have senior leadership accepted by the campus leaders and 
devoted to their personal advancement as well as that of all of us as a group.
4.4  Summary
Creating a college at Georgia Tech devoted to and leading a broad interpretation of 
computing took a village of people (to channel a popular saying), including their 
ancestors. The creation of CoC is often credited to one person—Pat Crecine. That is 
true in the sense that he articulated the general vision and as President was able to 
allocate resources and make administrative decisions that enabled the creation of 
the College, but the creation story doesn’t end there.
4  Productive Turmoil (1987–1990)

55
In fact, if the “vision” that Crecine articulated formally in his Inauguration 
Speech and subsequent plans and memos had not been expanded, elaborated, and 
turned into a substantive set of operational ideas, a College of Computing might 
never have been approved by a referendum of the entire Faculty of Georgia Tech, let 
alone the Regents. Moreover, if those giving the vision more substance had not been 
able to articulate that substance to me when first contacted and interviewed, I might 
well not have had much interest in accepting the offer to be Dean if it was extended 
to me—especially since I was also considering a different and interesting position 
at the same time in another city. That communication work was done by the 
Transition Committee with many ideas being offered, but most importantly by 
Richard LeBlanc’s personal inputs and the wise guidance of Pete Jensen, including 
his insistence on including the human aspects of computing. In that sense, they 
should be honored as much as Crecine for bringing these interdisciplinary ideas to 
the fore and arguing effectively for them to be the guiding vision for the College.
As we shall see in later chapters, Jensen in his guidance to me and LeBlanc in his 
enduring dedication (including careful readings of drafts of this book) to the con­
cept of computing as a broad, organizing principle and close work with me then 
helped carry forward the implementation. All of this resonated deeply with me 
because of the work I had been doing at NSF for the previous 2 years, helping 
develop a set of ideas very close to what they had been developing at Tech and on 
the Denning Committee. The combination clicked almost immediately.
Looking back, Slamecka’s broad view of information (including linguistics, cog­
nitive studies, and a focus on the end use of computing) prevailed in the early days 
from 1964 to around 1970 when the popularity of computing technology (design 
and creation of complex software, basic systems software, and related activities 
including computer science theory) brought modifications to the curriculum and 
research of ICS. When Miller came in 1980 with a mandate to create a strong com­
puter science group, that viewpoint was dominant—but not to the exclusion of 
broader activities (e.g., AI, cognitive studies, visualization, systems studies, most of 
which had roots in new faculty hired by Slamecka) were strengthened through addi­
tional hiring and curriculum expansions under Miller’s leadership.
As a result, the proposal for a broad College of Computing fell on fertile ground. 
The faculty that Slamecka, Miller, and Jensen had assembled beginning in 1964 and 
the growing national reputation in research that many of them were building formed 
a group that was already broader in its teaching and faculty research capacity than 
many computer science (CS) units around the country at that time. A notable excep­
tion was the School of Computer Science (SCS) at Carnegie Mellon 
University (CMU).
Some, perhaps many, at Georgia Tech and elsewhere felt that the College of 
Computing was simply a copy of SCS. That is understandable since Pat Crecine had 
been heavily immersed in the strong computing flavor SCS was imparting to CMU 
and my Ph.D. was from CMU/SCS. Crecine and I also shared a common thesis 
committee member (Herbert A. Simon) and were both at CMU part of the same 
period in the mid-1960s as graduate students; although we were not acquainted, we

clearly had come from a similar intellectual environment that even in the 1960s 
valued interdisciplinary interactions.
­

On July 1, 1990, the College of Computing officially came into existence and I 
became Dean of Computing. At that point, the visions and efforts of Crosland and 
Crecine, the vision and hard work of Slamecka, the focused leadership of Miller, the 
long-standing, quiet leadership of Jensen, and the efforts of dozens of faculty and 
staff were realized in an academic unit with a broad mission to lead, not own, com­
puting at Georgia Tech.
9 An additional CMU connection was that it had been Gordon Bell, whom I had known and worked 
with at CMU when he was a long-term visitor there in the late 1960s, that later recruited me to NSF 
in 1987. We had remained in touch since the 1960s and his distinctive (to say the least!) style had 
had its impact on me. That connection was known to Crecine and helped serve to validate my suit­
ability to be the founding dean.

Chapter 5
Laying the Foundation for a College 
(1990–1995)
This chapter will describe the conditions existing in 1990 and the approaches that 
the faculty and I took in the first 6 years of the College’s existence along with some 
of the major events and developments of those years. A brief outline of the general 
state of Georgia Tech and the new College of Computing in 1990 will be followed 
by a narration of the most important initial actions we took in the first few months. 
This is followed by descriptions of the approach we took, the principles we tried to 
follow, and the major themes of activity that characterized not only the first 6 years 
of the College but up to 2003 and beyond, with some important distinctions that will 
be elaborated on in succeeding chapters. The content in this chapter is not always 
organized chronologically, but is key to understanding what has made the College a 
success. The remainder of this chapter provides a more straightforward narrative of 
the period up to the summer of 1996.

The previous September I had just stepped down as Director of Computer and 
Communications Research at the National Science Foundation in Washington, 
D.C. A long-time professional colleague, Rich DeMillo, had succeeded me in that 
position and since I was still living in Washington we frequently had dinner. On one 
occasion in early October 1989, DeMillo asked if a former colleague of his from 
Georgia Tech, Rich LeBlanc, could join us. I had heard of LeBlanc, but never met 
him, so was glad for the opportunity.
During dinner, the conversation turned to activities at NSF in which I had been 
engaged. As I was describing those for the benefit of LeBlanc, at one point he inter­
rupted and said that the NSF had a similar direction to what was going on at Tech. 
After I finished, he told us more about the reorganization and new College of 
Computing and that they were starting a search for a new dean. Since I was starting 
to look at several possible positions for the next academic year, rather than returning 
to University of California, Irvine, my ears perked up. Shortly afterward, I received 
an invitation to visit Tech as a consultant to the Transition Committee and give a 
talk; due to the usual issues of scheduling, it was early December before that initial 
visit took place. Additional visits and discussions beginning in January made it clear 
that I was being seriously considered for the position of Founding Dean. The result

is described in this chapter and Chapter 6, and to some extent in the remainder of 
the book.
In multiple ways, my previous professional history had prepared me for this role, 
but not strictly on the traditional academic path. Early in my career, my research at 
the time on software design was of high interest to large organizations which were 
just beginning to realize that developing large and complex software-intensive sys­
tems required more than just programming. My consulting and lecturing, built on 
my research and teaching at the university put me in close touch with many top 
executives, from whom I probably learned as much as they learned from me. As I 
sometimes have described myself, I can operate comfortably on both sides of the 
street that often separates academia and industry and translate between them. The 
textbox provides a few additional high points.
5.2  Context
Before diving into the details, some context will be helpful.
5.2.1  Campus
At the start of the 1990–1991 academic year on July 1, 1990, Georgia Tech was a 
campus coming to grips with a new overall organization and multiple new leaders, 
some entirely new to Tech. Echoes of the turmoil of the previous 2 years persisted, 
in some cases for more than a year or two, but in general there seemed to be a will­
ingness to accept the new order (even if grudgingly in some areas) and get on with 
the forward motion of the campus that was manifesting itself not only in new lead­
ers and mandates, but in some explicit activities.
Peter A. Freeman (1941– ) has a long history in computing starting in 1961. 
He holds a Bachelor’s in physics from Rice, a Master’s in math & psychology 
from the University of Texas, Austin, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from 
Carnegie Mellon University. He was tenured at UC Irvine and Georgia Tech, 
consulted broadly with major firms and universities here and abroad, started a 
successful training company, given hundreds of professional development 
seminars, and authored or co-authored eleven other books and dozens of 
papers. He was Founding Dean of the College of Computing, served as 
Assistant Director, CISE, of the National Science Foundation and earlier as 
Division Director for Computing and Communications. He is a Fellow of the 
ACM, IEEE, and AAAS.
5.2  Context

60
Georgia Tech in 1990 was a large organization (almost 12,000 students, 400+ 
faculty, 500+ staff) that was undergoing major and rapid changes. The reorganiza­
tion in the late 1980s was just starting to settle out with the hiring of new deans, 
operational establishment of new organizations, and development of new working 
relationships. Tech was a part of a system of thirty-four higher education campuses 
supported by the State of Georgia, and was primarily dependent on Federal support 
for the research it conducted. Further, the early 1990s was a time of economic reces­
sion nationally, putting stress on and even cuts to, campus budgets. As a result, the 
College was hardly the complete master of its own fate!
Structurally, in the previous academic year there had been four colleges 
(Engineering, Architecture, Management, and Science and Liberal Studies); the lat­
ter contained a collection of schools (the granted degrees) and departments (which 
for the most part did not offer many, if any, advanced degrees). Beginning in 1990, 
the Colleges were Engineering, Science, Computing, Architecture, and Management 
and Liberal Studies; they subsumed all of the previous, schools, departments, other 
free-standing programs such as Construction Management and Music. Engineering 
and Architecture were largely unchanged with the previous deans still in place. 
Science had an Acting Dean, a senior faculty member in Chemistry, and Management 
and Liberal Studies was led by two Acting Co-Deans, one from History and one 
from Management; I was the proverbial new kid on the block.
However, within 2 years, new deans of all of the other Colleges had been chosen, 
all but one newcomers to Tech, leaving me as the senior dean. National searches, 
which I led or participated in, for those individuals were a major activity that engaged 
a number of faculty and other leaders. The schools that formerly did not produce 
many, if any, advanced degrees were engaged in starting or expanding those pro­
grams in their areas. Several new administrative leaders were brought in or advanced 
in their roles as part of the reorganization, both in the Colleges and for the campus. 
At the same time, normal instruction, research, and other activities continued in 
addition to the leadership changes. Taken broadly, the campus was a beehive of 
activity. On top of all of that President Crecine had started a number of other activi­
ties and sought to increase campus participation in several other outside activities.
One of those was his pledging campus support and resources in Atlanta’s quest 
to be chosen as the site for the 1996 Olympics; Georgia Tech, with the approval of 
the appropriate governing bodies had promised the campus as the site of the Olympic 
Village if Atlanta was chosen. In point of fact, this occurred in September 1990, 
only 3 months after the College came into existence. As I note below, the interest 
that this brought to the campus only added to the excitement of what was already 
seen and felt as a new beginning for Georgia Tech.

5.2.2  1996 Olympics and Other Contextual Factors
In addition to this general context, three exogenous factors impinged directly on 
CoC: (1) The choice of Atlanta to host the 1996 Olympics (with Tech as the Olympic 
Village), resulting in a huge amount of planning, construction, and other nonacademic 
activity on campus; (2) campus-wide responsibilities that were valuable to the cam­
pus and indirectly to the College, but that did not leave me sufficient time for internal 
matters; (3) President Crecine himself, who in spite of always being supportive and 
protective of CoC, had other personal characteristics that caused considerable con­
sternation to many of us and eventually led to his resignation effective June 30, 1994.
I was asked to play a major role in overseeing preparations for the Olympics. The 
plan for the Olympic Village was that a large amount of the campus (all dormitories, 
food service facilities, and other nonacademic or research buildings) would be 
enclosed within a security fence for about 2 months in the summer of 1996. The 
campus administration sprang into action with additional executive hires to lead the 
planning and oversight of approximately $300M of new dormitory construction and 
upgrading of campus infrastructure, including networking. It was quickly deter­
mined that it would be impossible to have the usual summer academic session (usu­
ally well-attended because of the co-op program in which 35–40% of the 
undergraduates participated at that time) and that except for some research facilities 
the entire campus would effectively be closed during that period. When actual prep­
arations got underway in late 1991, I was already the senior dean and was asked to 
serve on the campus Budget Committee that advised the Provost (and President) on 
all budget allocations. As if that wasn’t enough responsibilities outside the College 
my responsibilities on the Olympics oversight committee that met weekly required 
substantial work before each meeting unrelated to the College.
The preparations for the Olympics certainly energized the campus, especially the 
students! Among other physical benefits, the preparations resulted in a new, campus 
high-speed, local-area, fiber network that we dubbed FutureNet, that fell to me to 
lead when the campus CIO died suddenly (see below). FutureNet was designed by 
Ron Hutchins, at the time a senior staff member in the campus Office of Information 
Technology (OIT) and a Ph.D. student in the College; it was conceived to serve all 
networking on campus including the special needs for the Olympic Village from 
carrying 100+ TV channels to all Internet traffic to ordinary email.
­
2
2 FutureNet consisted of a large number of fiber strands to every building on campus (more than 
50), donated by AT&T and laid by Bell-South as part of their Olympic donations, and cutting-edge 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches. Buildings with high usage rates of network ser­
vices had up to 96 strands; every office, lab, and dorm room had cat-5 or fiber connections—a total 
of several thousand connections. With the donations of equipment and labor, it was built for an 
outlay of only $750,000 (which we obtained from the University System of Georgia) and it per­
formed flawlessly.
5.2  Context

62
­
­
In the midst of all of the work required to prepare for the Olympics, an additional 
challenge was added to the mix in 1994: the new chancellor of the University 
System of Georgia decreed that all 34 campuses would switch their academic calen­
dars from quarters to semesters. This requirement initiated a multi-year process of 
redefining the curricula for all degree programs, submitting these revisions for 
approval through a campus-wide process, publishing a new catalog, advising stu­
dents about the coming changes, and advising them individually through the transi­
tion. In addition, the curriculum process was constrained by the development of a 
new system-wide core curriculum requirement. Needless to say, a large amount of 
time of the faculty and staff had to be devoted to these activities. While these chal­
lenges were faced all across campus, the impact on the College of Computing was 
perhaps proportionally much greater because we were burdened with substantial 
additional responsibilities for the faculty and staff, almost from the day the College 
officially came into existence, since at the time we were not only understaffed but 
busy trying to hire new faculty and staff as well establish our internal 
infrastructure.
The process of defining Georgia Tech’s version of the new core curriculum ulti­
mately resulted in a challenging new opportunity for the College of Computing. The 
campus committee defining the new core decided to include an introductory com­
puting course with a substantial amount of programming content as a requirement 
for all Georgia Tech students. Prior to this development, over 50% of GT students 
already were taking one of our programming courses. Extending our reach to the 
entire student body was seen as a component of our mandate to be leaders in com­
puting for the whole campus. Since this new requirement didn’t take effect until 
1999, all of the preparation work (thankfully!) happened after the Olympics.
In mid-June 1992 F.L. (Bud) Suddath, Executive Assistant to the President and 
Vice President of Information Technology (VPIT), a close colleague and friend, 
died suddenly. I was asked within a few weeks by the President to assume the 
responsibilities of VPIT in addition to those of being Dean of Computing. These 
dual responsibilities continued until 1994 when Gordon Wishon was hired and inte­
grated into the many routine and on-going IT activities on campus as well as the 
additional tasks underway in preparation for the 1996 Olympics.
As noted above, there were three exogenous factors that impinged on the College 
as we began. Chief among these new responsibilities for me was personally leading 
the creation of FutureNet (described above)—creating and frequently meeting with 
an external advisory board of national networking experts, meeting campus and 
5  Laying the Foundation for a College (1990–1995)

63
system-wide leaders to explain what we were doing and how they could help, and 
assisting Ron Hutchins in working with school chairs and building managers across 
campus to facilitate FutureNet access. Without the full support and leadership of my 
Associate Dean, Rich LeBlanc, and the senior faculty, my frequent absence from 
the College and consequent inability to focus fully on the College, we would not 
have progressed as far as we did by 1996.
­
3
The third contextual situation over which we had no control, the turmoil around 
Pat Crecine and his forced resignation in 1994, were generally negative influences 
and led to considerable worry by some on campus, especially in the College, that his 
entire reorganization would revert to what had previously existed. By 1994, how­
ever, the wisdom of most aspects of the reorganization was clearly seen by almost 
everyone on campus and among key alumni. The rapid growth in students, ability to 
hire senior faculty and staff from well-known research universities, and to attract 
significant new research funding by newer units on campus including the College, 
as well as by the well-established Engineering College, illustrated this success.
The fact that after Pat Crecine’s resignation in 1964 the new President, Wayne 
Clough, and other new executive arrivals basically continued the strategic thrusts of 
Crecine by continuing to grow Computing and adding new emphases that further 
advanced the campus. Most notably, Engineering and almost all of its individual 
schools rapidly ascended in ranking nationally as well as in international reputation. 
Computing clearly benefited from that since beyond campus we were often seen as 
part of Engineering (as was often the case at other universities) even though in fact 
we were an independent unit. With the attention largely focused on growth in 
Engineering, we were able to grow independently without too much interference, 
but sometimes in their shadow when it came to gaining resources or attention to our

POP—a “plain ole professor”), with a greatly expanded range of authority, responsibility, and lati­
tude of action. My new peers eventually included several seasoned academic leaders, a retired 
four-star general, and a former astronaut who also had led NASA; all were friendly and willing 
teachers of a relative neophyte. To say that it was an incredible learning environment and experi­
ence for me is a huge understatement. I will be eternally grateful!

64
needs. In a way, the situation was parallel to the growth of ICS in the Slamecka era 
a generation before as described above.
5.2.3  The Situation in 1990
As described in previous chapters, Information and Computer Science (ICS), the 
prior name of the new College of Computing, had a respectable and long history, 
being one of the earliest academic computing departments in the country. It had had 
good leaders, plenty of students, strong faculty, and had produced several outstand­
ing students at all levels that went on to become leaders (including two of the four 
deans of computing to date). The faculty had produced some leading research 
results and as a group were known nationally. At the same time, it was small (34 
faculty; I became number thirty-five), a small support staff and minimal equipment, 
and was ranked somewhere in the 30s (out of over a hundred departments of com­
puter science at that time in research universities).
Even with a new, forward-looking mandate, coupled with numerous good ideas 
that had been developed by faculty leaders from across campus during the Transition 
Period described in Chapter 4, the College of Computing was a college in name 
only. The former School of ICS did not have sufficient infrastructure, size, and 
resources needed to meet the operational demands on a college at Georgia Tech. 
Moreover, it lacked sufficient connections to leading universities and companies 
strong in computing to be a leader nationally as well as to lead the campus in for­
ward-looking programs. It was one of the two smallest of the six colleges and 
smaller even than several of the larger schools in the College of Engineering. Also 
missing was a coherent group vision that was operational and a commonly held 
aspiration to work together to achieve it.
The vision of President Crecine to reorganize the campus in the late 1980s to 
recognize the coming fundamental importance of computing, as well as to empha­
size the importance of all academic units in a university, unleashed a new energy in 
Computing and the other units operating under the new campus structure. His lead­
ership extended further to his insistence that we all strive to be the best in our areas 
nationally and internationally, not just the best in the Southeast; to his constant 
exhortations to us to hire new people of the highest quality available, who had first-­
hand experience with the nature of a top-rank research university; and to helping us 
develop the resources and connections enabling us to advance meaningfully toward 
those lofty ambitions.
Pat Crecine had two overarching objectives for the College: First, to “Be at the 
table when resource decisions are made, not just be represented by a dean whose 
personal background and interests might not be in computing;” second, to “Lead, 
not own, all computing at Georgia Tech.” Rather than being turned off by these 
ambitions and the hard work implied by them, most faculty and staff already in the 
new college understood the great opportunity that had been handed to them and 
were eager to begin; they met the challenge with energy and imagination. That, 
5  Laying the Foundation for a College (1990–1995)

65
coupled with the support and vision of the President, was the biggest advantage that 
I had when I officially began work on July 1, 1990. The next 12 years is a story of 
innovative ideas from and hard work by the faculty and staff, amplified by the lead­
ership of senior faculty and myself. We were able to encourage, harvest, combine, 
and support the best of those ideas and work to build a new and productive 
community.
These exogenous factors have carried my narrative forward to the pivotal year of 
1996 because they were present through most of the first 6 years of the College. 
That was not the entire story, however, and in some ways perhaps not the most 
important from the standpoint of how a small, barely known computer science 
group grew to be one of a very few world leaders in academic computing. Let me 
return now to what we did internally to bring this growth and transition about to 
actualize our vision—the key to our success.
5.3  Initial Actions
The ICS faculty and I knew that we had a tremendous opportunity, perhaps the 
greatest professional opportunity any of us had ever had, and that it would take care­
fully focused effort to move forward toward the goal that had been set for us. I and 
a few others enthusiastically embraced the goal from the start and almost all of the 
faculty at least accepted it. At the same time, I was humbled by it and knew that I 
could only be successful with the help of everyone—faculty, staff, students, and 
external supporters. I knew that we had a lot of organizational foundation to build to 
become a functioning college at least as successful as those already in existence at 
Georgia Tech and perhaps different in some ways that weren’t immediately evident. 
I had the advantage of having been in other leading organizations that we now 
aspired to match and hopefully surpass. A key lesson I had learned was the impor­
tance of a strong foundation in the success of others.
In multiple ways, my previous professional history had prepared me for this role, 
but not on the traditional path of professor, department chair, and then dean, nor as 
a senior manager although I had some experience and close-hand knowledge of a 
fairly broad range of all these roles. The textbox below provides some high-points 
of my background.
It was clear to Pat Crecine, me, and most of the initial College faculty in 1990—
although, perhaps, not to everyone on campus—that computing in general was 
going to continue to expand exponentially in amount, importance, and wide impact 
throughout society. In short, we believed whole-heartedly in the vision that, in the 
future, advancement of large swaths of human activity was going to depend on 
advances in computing fundamentals. Thus, it seemed obvious from the start to us 
that expansion by purposeful activity would be necessary to fulfill the rare opportu­
nity before us to become a leader in the advancement of computing.
As with most issues on a campus filled with bright, self-directed, successful peo­
ple that were largely focused on what they personally and their research group could

achieve, issues in other fields beyond their home departments usually didn’t receive 
much attention from the front-line faculty. Those in leadership positions, because of 
what the academic system rewards, tend to be parochial and territorial in their 
responses to university-level strategic issues. As noted in Chapter 4, President 
Crecine’s plan to reorganize the Georgia Tech campus, however, created significant 
controversy, especially outside of the Engineering Schools, which were largely 
unaffected

5.3.1  Development of a Way Forward for the College 
of Computing
The first major step I took in September 1990, just prior to the start of the fall term, 
was to engage all of the faculty in discussions of a vision we wanted to try to achieve 
and how we wanted to proceed. Although my informal discussions with a number of 
faculty before and after I accepted the offer to be the founding dean had been almost 
uniformly in favor of the general vision for the College that had been developed 
before I arrived on campus, I understood that (1) not everyone had been heard from 
and (2) most importantly, that simply adopting that vision as a group did not address 
meaningfully what it would mean to each faculty member individually in their pur­
suit of educational, research, and service goals as well as their personal goals.
To begin the individual engagement of each faculty member, we had a 2-day retreat 
of all faculty and a few staff away from campus. This permitted us to become better 
acquainted as a group, for me to share my thinking about the future, and for them to 
share their thoughts and visions. We then proceeded to take some initial steps toward 
developing high-level goals that encompassed everyone while still permitting indi­
vidual faculty to develop their own directions within a larger, cooperative framework.
4 Some helpful exceptions were Robert Fulton, Ward Winer, and Bill Wepfer; several outside-ICS 
members of the Transition Committee including Bob Pierotti, Jim Craig, Leon McGinnis, and Ron 
Schaeffer; most of the Computer Engineering group in EE; and several others in individual 
instances.
5  Laying the Foundation for a College (1990–1995)

67
There were three primary outcomes of the retreat: (1) The faculty and I became 
better acquainted personally and professionally, (2) a shared vision, and (3) agree­
ment on some principles by which we wanted to operate. The first outcome obvi­
ously is a necessary condition for any teamwork in an environment that otherwise is 
usually quite individualistic and not organized on the basis of a hierarchical chain of 
command. In truth, those two days merely started a process that continued in vari­
ous ways for the next 12 years.
The second two outcomes were a bit more specific but at the same time were just 
the start of an initial refinement process over the next 4 or 5 months and additional 
sharpening over the next couple of years. That process resulted in agreement on the 
overall vision of where we wanted to head (the “vision”), basic principles by which 
we wanted to operate as a group, and some broad themes of activity. I knew that a 
group of faculty larger than (or sometimes just) one rarely agree completely on 
anything, let alone an overarching vision and multiple principles, but I knew that to 
be successful, we had to at least try. Fortunately, the most widely-respected leaders 
among the faculty (Enslow, Kolodner, and LeBlanc) understood the importance. 
Almost all the others quickly got on board with our efforts.
Ideas were offered by me at the retreat but as much as possible I encouraged 
faculty to take the lead in speaking to the group on a topic; these were then elabo­
rated and iterated in small groups, and eventually turned into written statements that 
could be communicated back to the entire group. Agreement on them was usually 
by a consensus that would emerge from further discussions in the entire group. 
Because they were mostly very broad, obtaining agreement on individual principles 
was usually not too difficult. In a few cases, for example a theme of “striving to 
grow,” it took some careful consideration of and concern for individual objections 
before I made a decision as moderator of the group discussion that tried to capture 
the majority opinion. It usually worked well.
The retreat was followed up by the faculty forming several working groups to 
continue the discussions of the retreat and turn them into more concrete goals and 
activities. This continued the process of engaging the faculty in determining a 
course of action for the College as a whole. This instilled the very important idea 
that as much as possible, they were to be involved directly in determining directions 
within a larger shared vision.
We did have remarkable acceptance of, or at least willing acquiescence to, the 
vision and principles worked out by all of the College faculty in discussions at that 
first retreat and continued over the next few months in faculty meetings, small 
groups, and sharing of drafts. By the start of 1991, we had in essence what follows 
below. There are always some in a group who for one reason or another hold back 
on expressing their personal opinions in public or private. However, in my succeed­
ing 12 years, I believe only one or two subsequently left solely because of disagree­
ment with what we were trying to achieve as a group rather than largely for other 
reasons. At the same time, over that 12 years we had remarkable success in recruit­
ing new faculty, including some who already had positions in other schools at Tech 
and of their own volition asked to move their positions to us, or at least have shared 
5.3  Initial Actions

68
positions or adjunct relationships with us. Needless to say, this gave all of us very 
positive reinforcement for our vision, actions, and principles of actualization!
It should be pointed out for the benefit of readers not in academia that this 
consensus-­forming process was a bit unusual for an academician. As dean I had the 
advantage of seniority, experience at established, highly successful organizations 
(e.g., NSF, a campus of the University of California), and authority. My experience 
included work with major companies as well as high-tech startups and it was natural 
for me to adapt that experience and treat my task as one of leading a high-tech 
startup in which principles and focused activity are essential. I had learned that 
perhaps my strongest characteristic as a leader of a group was my ability to “walk 
both sides of the street”—I had earned my spurs as a young professor and continued 
to teach and participate in a modicum of research activity to the day I left academia 
in 2002; at the same time, I knew the language and attitudes of industry, had had 
modest financial success in building a small training group in the early 1980s, and 
served as a consultant to the top leaders of several large corporations over extended 
periods.

69
During the next academic year, the campus leadership group of which I was a 
part had further training in strategic planning by an experienced and successful 
alumnus. That process was aimed at the creation of a new, annual budget allocation 
process that mandated creation of a strategic plan for every campus organization, 
such as the colleges and major service units. Every unit head had to defend in person 
their annual budget request on the basis of their written plan before a review board 
that included the President, the Provost, and the Vice Presidents of Finance and 
Research and the Budget Committee; the reviewers had received the written plan 
enough in advance so that they could read it; large colleges with multiple schools 
held similar reviews internally for each school and in some cases, individual schools 
also presented to the review board as well.
That was not what normally happens in a university but it was a process that 
worked, if followed carefully, for units trying to make a leap in capability and results 
as we were. It worked well for the College of Computing and arguably for most of 
the campus. The process is a simple one that starts with the articulation of and then 
repeated refinement and use of a vision for the future of what a specific group or 
subgroup is trying to achieve.
5.4.1  The Strategic Planning Method We Used
There are many planning processes for an organization, but this is not the place to 
compare and contrast. The one I used for over a decade or more worked for me and 
the faculty, as borne out by our success in developing a foundation that in the main 
has worked well ever since and is outlined in the text box below; I have used it ever 
since in some form for professional and personal projects.
Simplified Planning Method
Document & review all results at the end of each stage
Iterate between stages as needed
•	 Understand both the external and internal contexts of the organization
•	 Determine the current primary activities
•	 Identify the current missions of your organization as mandated & 
acquired
•	 Describe the results of the previous three steps as a current vision.
•	 Develop a future vision of what you are aiming for
•	 Describe the future mission(s) and primary activities
•	 Develop goals which if achieved will achieve the vision
•	 Develop strategies for achieving each goal
•	 Apply measurements to track progress
May be applied recursively to individual parts of an organization
Iterate and update on a regular basis
Expand with tactics and budgets as appropriate
5.4  Planning and Purposeful Activity

70
Inherent in it is that there is a time frame, typically beginning soon, but perhaps 
with an unstated ending. External contexts are those over which you have little or no 
control, such as the economy or the overall mission of a larger organization of which 
you are a part. Internal contexts are those over which you have at least some control, 
such as expenditures and hiring.
Primary activities may be composed of included activities, for example, giving a 
class may be composed of researching the material, preparing lectures, giving the 
lectures, and answering questions from the students. The mission of an organization 
is what it does as seen from the standpoint of an external observer. An existing orga­
nization may not have an explicit vision, but one can be inferred from its activities 
over time.
At the time one undertakes planning of the future, you assume that the current 
state of affairs has resulted from striving toward some vision of the future that was 
held in the past; I call this the current vision. For example, if at present the service 
component of an academic unit does not include anything other than service for 
other academic activities (teaching and research) and there is no evidence of any 
interest in service to any nonacademic activities, such as economic development, 
then you might conclude that the current vision of the unit will not lead to that 
broader concept.
Here is where we begin the planning of directed activity. If you imagine a future 
vision for the unit and you recognize that the current vision will not lead you there, 
then you have a goal that comes from the vision of a new future. Continuing the 
service example above that goal might be stated simply that the unit will reward 
service activity that is meaningful to a variety of audiences, including outside 
academia.
It is useful not only to have goals, but to work to develop strategies for activity 
that may be used in achieving more than just one goal at one specific time; a strategy 
is not a problem-solving method. In this context, a strategy is one that conditions 
problem-solving behavior. For example, a strategy for achieving a goal of making a 
unit a leader might be to hire the very best people available at the time of hiring; 
how to go about that in practice may depend on several factors.
Directed activity to achieve a vision or a specific goal must be measured in some 
way and at meaningful intervals to determine progress. Measurement of intangible 
goals is difficult, but not impossible. The act of trying to measure progress itself can 
sometimes suggest improvements. For example, if the goal is to “Hire the best 
people” break that down into “find them, recruit them, and hire them” which yields 
parts that may be amenable to measurement. If the overall result does not meet your 
expectations, then you can ask if you were looking in the wrong places or did the 
recruiting activity not yield enough suitable candidates or were willing candidates 
not actually signed up for some reason you might control—or usually some combi­
nation of these “measurements.”
Finally, as noted in the italicized comments at the bottom of the textbox above, 
we applied this general approach to subparts of the expected mission of an academic 
unit—education, research, and service—in a recursive manner. The above descrip­
tion of our planning method is meant only to be generally descriptive of how to 
5  Laying the Foundation for a College (1990–1995)

71
proceed in laying out purposeful activity, not a prescription. We iterated this whole 
process annually as will be described below; an example of a plan we developed is 
given in the Appendix.
After this digression into how we proceeded let me return to the overall question 
of the direction of where we were going—that is, our vision.
5.4.2  The Vision We Developed
The concept of a “vision” is derided by some because it is very general, usually 
lacking in hard specifics, may change in shape and implied instantiation over time, 
and usually doesn’t tell you what to do in a specific situation. All that being true, I 
and many of my faculty colleagues at the time, believe that having a vision and the 
purposeful, planned actions we took were the two most important elements in the 
success we had as a group.
A vision of where you are headed can develop at any time, of course, but is most 
useful if you have the opportunity as we did to begin anew as a group. When you are 
starting with an existing set of people, each with his or own vision (however, incom­
plete) of where their professional activity is taking them, to be successful you must 
somehow develop a group vision that encompasses important elements of most indi­
vidual’s personal visions. That is what our initial retreat described above started.
Our vision began with the single statement in President Crecine’s inaugural 
speech mentioned previously:
There will be no great 21st Century university without a great computing and 
information environment.
This statement had been discussed and developed over the next 2 years in the 
process briefly described in the previous chapter that engaged leaders from across 
campus, resulting in two, very important ways:
•	 Choice of the name “College of Computing”
•	 Explication of the meaning of a vision that encompassed not only a broad defini­
tion of computer science, but the use of computing and support of related fields 
such as cognitive science
The final version of this statement made strong use of the forthcoming principles 
for a field of “computing” as developed by a broad, national, professional commit­
tee—already largely known at Tech thanks to the leadership of Richard LeBlanc in 
injecting them into the discussions of the Transition Committee.
5.4  Planning and Purposeful Activity

5.4.3  Practicalities
To ensure that our visioning and planning activities were of use beyond merely being 
an intellectual exercise, we utilized a three-step process that began with a Strategic 
Plan that we intended to last for 5 years or longer changing only slowly over that 
time, but with annual adjustments as necessary. The second step was to develop a 
Tactical Plan that was intended to achieve, or at least make measurable progress, on 
each major sub-goal of the Strategic Plan within the time frame of the Strategic Plan. 
Typically we updated it annually as specific goals were achieved (or abandoned if 
deemed necessary) to guide us as we developed our budget request for the next aca­
demic year, as well as set targets for acquiring external funds. The third step was to 
develop an Operational Plan each year that posited internal allocations of funds and 
other resources that served as the supporting detail for requests for funds; it could 
then be adjusted appropriately over the year depending on actual resources acquired. 
As with any plan, all of these plans were developed with risks and potential opportu­
nities in mind, with alternatives at least thought of in the case of shortfalls in resources.
At an initial meeting of an external College of Computing Advisory Board in 
October 1991, I made a presentation, “Vision for the College of Computing,” that 
both illustrated the attitude (in that case, focused on research) that I attempted to 
instill in the faculty and staff as well as initiating the formation of a strong, national 
Advisory Board. This seminal event extended our community to an important group 
of external supporters and began the process of engaging faculty leaders with a 
group of well-placed national leaders in academia and industry. This presentation, 
while not a complete plan, contained many of the elements of a plan and were then 
developed into an explicit strategic plan in the following year.
The meeting of the Board in Fall 1991 provided the opportunity to unveil our 
strategic plan to a broader audience. It was noted in the Plan that
In a world where computer science is very closely blended with a variety of 
other disciplines in the context of challenging strategic applications, our 
research activity must push forward the frontiers of basic computer science 
and selected computing areas in which computer science is a key, but not 
exclusive, component. Our real specialty, however, will be in knowing how to 
effectively mix computer science and other areas.
These initial efforts to formulate a realizable vision coupled with evolving strategic 
plans were key to the early and continuing successes of the College and its members.
When the last Strategic Plan for the College of the first 12 years of its existence 
was drafted in 1999, the vision had matured into, but was remarkably similar to the 
1991 version:
The College of Computing will be the leader in computing research and edu­
cation. Our work, while richly diverse, will focus on human-centered cyberen­
vironments. We will:
•	 learn and lead throughout our careers,
•	 create innovative research products that have significant impact, and
•	 engage in service that enriches our state, nation, and profession.
5  Laying the Foundation for a College (1990–1995)

73
We will be a high-quality, internationally recognized community of schol­
ars with a strong intellectual core of computer science that is recognized as 
among the best in the world.
The addition of “education” was important and deliberate based on our clear 
understanding of its importance and our by-then proven ability to make important 
contributions beyond simply delivering known content in routine ways. Similarly, 
the more crisply stated aspirations reflected our growing assurance, based on expe­
rience, that we could contribute strongly along all three traditional dimensions of 
faculty activity.
The last Strategic Plan that I helped develop in late 1999 is presented in the 
Appendix as an example. It was intended to guide our actions at a general level for 
the coming 5 years, with annual updates if needed; it illustrates the first of the three 
levels of plans that we utilized. The first level is the Strategy, the second level, an 
Operational Plan, was updated typically once a year in preparing our budget requests 
for the coming academic year, by using as an outline the then current state of the 
strategic plan giving one or more specific actions we intended to take to make prog­
ress toward each goal. The third level, a Tactical Plan, assigned responsibilities and 
budget (if needed) for work on one or more specific actions, once our projected bud­
get for the coming year was approved. Examples of the second- and third-level plans 
are not provided here, partly because of their detail and partly because they named 
individuals and financial matters that were sensitive at the time and irrelevant now.
It is worth noting that the Vision Statement in the Strategic Plan in the Appendix 
is largely the one we first used in a presentation in 1991, with only some refine­
ments. I would have included that original Plan in the Appendix as well, but only 
fragments are available of the original now, over 30 years later.
Keep in mind that these plans did not account for all of the working time of each 
individual in the College. For some full-time staff members it might account for a 
noticeable fraction of their assigned duties while for others almost none. For faculty, 
with the exception of a few who for whatever reason were not primarily teaching or 
performing research, it typically only accounted for a small amount of their profes­
sional time. On the other hand, some activities couldn’t be measured in specific terms 
of time or money; examples such as “improve teaching to improve overall campus 
retention rates” or “strengthen core research areas by carefully evaluating a faculty 
candidate’s ability to strengthen existing faculty strength” are more of the form of 
guidelines for activities that a faculty member would already be doing—guidance on 
how to carry out specific actions rather than assigning new responsibilities.
The history of the succeeding 30+ years have so far borne out our belief in and 
use of a common vision. However, the existence and evolution of an effective vision 
alone did not suffice to get the College through its first 12 years, let alone the next 30.
The next section explicates the general themes and principles that we (myself, 
faculty, and staff) to follow for the 12 years while I was dean. They all had their 
roots in my and other leaders’ experiences before formation of the College initially 
as well as that of additional senior faculty and staff. They were articulated, at least 
5.4  Planning and Purposeful Activity

74
implicitly, in the conversations we had in the first 6 months of CoC’s existence and 
that were refreshed and updated periodically through group activities
5.5  Fundamental Themes and Principles
As used here a theme is just a set of actions that share one or more characteristics. 
A principle is a statement of a truth that we believed could and should pertain 
throughout our activities in building the College).
5.5.1  Themes
Five broad themes of collective action emerged that characterize the work of the 
College for the length of my role as dean. They were:
•	 Development of collective human resources
•	 Research and educational infrastructure development
•	 Aggressive outreach
•	 Educational reform and innovation
•	 Research depth and breadth
All of these themes involved both faculty and staff to various degrees. The first 
three were largely my responsibility as dean to initiate, provide funding for, and 
oversee, but the importance of faculty involvement and suggestions were key to 
their success. The last two, of course, were where faculty spent most of their time.
Because educational matters are the sole responsibility of faculty in substance as a 
matter of policy in most universities, my role in education as dean (and that of the 
associate deans) was primarily to suggest where collective action was needed by serv­
ing as the collector of data and ideas, moderator/shaper of these into specific actions 
when needed, and formulator of goals if that wasn’t already implicit in the agreed 
upon action. As a practical matter, however, it is usually a joint responsibility of the 
faculty and of the dean as the provider of most of the resources for teaching, such as 
classroom space, salary for teaching assistants, and administrative support. In some 
instances, especially in a field in which the dean is an expert, he or she as a senior 
faculty member may also be involved in contributing to curriculum and even indi­
vidual courses; it is at best, however, a process that must be undertaken very carefully.
Fashioning research and educational strengths out of a collection of individual 
(or small group) agendas is not easy, but can be done. Over time, new faculty addi­
tions can be chosen to emphasize or diminish activities to fit existing or added 
research themes to form more cohesive topic areas. While the faculty have a large 
say in choosing new or replacement faculty, as dean I had the responsibility dele­
gated to me by the upper administration to manage the funds allocated to us. That 
5  Laying the Foundation for a College (1990–1995)

75
gave me the ability to build up certain areas, almost always with the cooperation of 
the faculty as a whole.
There is a natural desire of faculty members to want to grow and strengthen their 
area of research by adding faculty in their areas of interest, sometimes to the neglect 
of other areas. If resources were unlimited that might not be a problem, but unfortu­
nately resources are almost always limited. Rather than making decisions unilater­
ally, I appealed to the faculty, especially those serving on the Recruiting Committee 
to put aside their personal desires to hire in their own areas and to make decisions 
based on what would most help the College as a whole to grow and strengthen in 
relation to our peers (actual and those we wished were). In most cases, they did, so 
that then if I was presented with a list of highly qualified candidates for the areas 
that best served the College objectives the hiring decisions were based on strategic 
objectives and economic reality. Setting the objectives was a planning process each 
year prior to recruiting; I will describe this process briefly below.
5.5.2  Principles and Their Use
Actions taken in all of these themes were largely guided by five principles that also 
quickly emerged from our collective experiences and discussions. They were:
•	 Breadth of computing
•	 Importance of community
•	 Importance of every individual
•	 Quality in everything
•	 Key role of infrastructure
These five principles might be seen as platitudes with which everyone agrees. At 
a superficial level, that may be true, but by mutual agreement we made those opera­
tional principles by which we could judge individual actions. In some cases, those 
judgments were left up to me (with appropriate inputs), in others they were used by 
me and faculty committees in a variety of ways. They and the overall vision of a 
broad, multi-disciplinary college focused on all aspects.
Breadth of Computing  There are a multitude of views of what constitute comput­
ing, but to simplify, there are exclusive and inclusive definitions. The exclusive view 
might be characterized as being concerned primarily with a small number of topics 
that are academically rigorous, strive for fundamental verities, and change slowly 
over time. This has traditionally been called “computer science;” physics is an 
example in another area. The inclusive view is that the topics encompassed by the 
exclusive view of computer science are used by and are a foundation for a much 
broader set of topics that involve other organized disciplines as well; most engineer­
ing fields of this sort. For example, mechanical engineering often includes the dis­
ciplines of design engineering and of manufacturing engineering.
5.5  Fundamental Themes and Principles

76
The groups and individuals that carried out the 1988–1990 Transition from the 
prior School of ICS to the College, endowed it with an inclusive charter. They 
explicitly chose the name “computing” to signify that the new unit should be con­
cerned with much more than “computer science” in the exclusive sense. Although 
the exclusive view tended to be dominant nationally at that time in computer science 
departments, this far-sighted, inclusive view, the most fundamental principle on 
which the College was founded, has contributed greatly to its growth in size and 
reputation, and it continues to this day.
One of the leading academic computing units then and now is the School of 
Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. It undoubtedly was clearly in the 
mind of President Crecine, since his previous position was as provost there. Further, 
there were already at least the start of two strengths in ICS at that time (Computers 
& People and Networking & Telecommunications) that were not seen in traditional 
computing groups. Finally, I already had strongly ascribed to the inclusive view in 
my research and teaching, further sharpened by my experiences at NSF just prior to 
coming to GT.
Today, there is rarely any reason to have to use this principle but in the early-­1990s 
I used it to justify to the upper administration hiring in new areas, such as telecom­
munications, that were not often seen in more traditional computer science depart­
ments. Internally, I used it prominently in talking with faculty (current and possible 
new hires), prospective graduate students, other areas on campus, industry, and 
potential donors.
Importance of Community  Ideally, an academic unit consists of a set of people 
who respect others as individuals and are able to work collaboratively with them on 
some things while disagreeing on others. Alan Perlis (a programming systems pio­
neer) once said to a group of us graduate students that he thought the research that 
Allen Newell (an AI pioneer) was doing was “crazy.” When I challenged him with 
“I thought you two were close colleagues!” he answered, “We are great colleagues 
and I have the highest respect for him; I just think his current research is crazy.” That 
spirit of mutual respect formed the basis for building one of the acknowledged, 
leading centers of computing research and education—Carnegie Mellon University.
The larger the unit, the more difficult it can be to build a community, but it is not 
impossible. Given the nature of the activities in which most academic units are 
engaged, there needs to be some commonality of intellectual interests; if not, the 
unit is nothing more than a neighborhood of individuals who may or may not share 
something in common. That may not be a detriment to individual scholarly success, 
but it makes any common activities, such as providing education in a coherent cur­
riculum, difficult. The greater loss may be the lost opportunity to cross-pollinate 
ideas and methods which can lead to larger successes both individually and as 
a group.
At Georgia Tech I started with 34 faculty FTE (a slightly larger number of indi­
viduals) and grew to over twice that before starting to develop strong subgroups, but 
even then there was (and continues to be) a strong sense of collective community. 
That illustrates a common story of organizational growth in which the spirit of 
5  Laying the Foundation for a College (1990–1995)

77
community is maintained by understanding the need for an overarching sense of 
common purpose. I once spent a day visiting many different subgroups at a major 
Intel research center of several thousand people; to a person, when I asked what the 
purpose of their subgroup was the answer was along always “To contribute to mak­
ing smaller, faster, and cheaper chips.” Only as an afterthought, they might answer 
something like “Oh, and to also understand [their subgroup focus] and contribute to 
knowledge in that area.”
An organization has some set of relationships—structure—that differentiate it 
from a random collection of people. “Community” is a diffuse term that describes a 
group of people, who may or may not form an organization. It usually involves a 
certain amount of respect between members, commonality of interest, knowledge of 
each other’s activities, and distinction from similar communities. Because of these 
characteristics, a community can be more powerful than an organization in some 
situations. Consider how a military organization that operates in close, extended, 
and stressful situations often becomes a community and is then capable of achieve­
ments not seen in a simple organization of the same size. It was this simple observa­
tion that the faculty leaders and I used frequently in recruiting, consideration of 
tenure and promotion cases, and in planning various activities intended to develop a 
sense of community.
Richard LeBlanc recently remarked to me “I remember multiple instances of 
visitors to the College saying something along the lines of ‘I can’t believe how 
much everyone enjoys working here.’ The fact that this was so visible to people who 
spent even a day or two with us was certainly the result of the community emphasis 
and while also focusing on the individual.”
Importance of Every Individual  This is a fundamental human quality, held at an 
abstract level by almost everyone; sadly it is not always practiced in a milieu where 
one set of people (faculty) have an inherently senior, organizational status to others. 
Quiet, but firm, leadership by senior faculty and staff (or department chairs or deans) 
is the best antidote. A particularly relevant example that we employed was to find a 
place within the College for a faculty member who was not suited for advancement 
but who could otherwise serve a very valuable role. We employed the same princi­
ple for valuable staff member who were very capable, but suited to the particular 
role in which they had been placed; in the case of staff members, that was often 
easier because of the need for administrative people across campus.
I established a personnel policy early on of respect for support staff by faculty 
members, and vice versa, and was not afraid to enforce it by personal example and 
gentle coaxing. Another operational instantiation of this principle was the rule that 
“work should be pushed down (automated or assigned to those whose skills were 
better suited to it) and that people should be pushed up (advanced). The corollary 
we practiced was that individuals for whom we did not have positions that fit their 
skills, or who had advanced as far as one could in our organization, would be 
assisted, without fault, in finding another position on campus or elsewhere to which 
they were better suited. Faculty quickly understood the importance of this rule, if 
they hadn’t already from their own experiences.
5.5  Fundamental Themes and Principles

78
Quality in Everything  This sounds like bland management-speak (it can be) or a 
truism (who wants less than quality?). Yet, as with the previous principle it is some­
times only selectively applied. In building the College of Computing, faculty gener­
ally understood the principle from the academic hiring process, although even there 
pushing the definition of “quality” to new levels took leadership from the senior 
faculty as well as myself. The idea that quality was a characteristic not only of inani­
mate objects such as lab space but also applies to processes such as student admis­
sions and advising was sometimes a new concept and not easy to implement with 
everyone, especially in the beginning. It extends to the physical space one has—it 
may not be the newest or most perfect, but the difference between keeping the space 
clean and tidy and not doing so made a large difference in the day-to-day attitude of 
those that worked in it and to our visitors.
Key Role of Infrastructure  Presumably you have a good idea of what infrastruc­
ture is needed for scholarly success in your specific area—specialized equipment, 
very-high-speed broadband, archival library access, technical/professional support 
personnel, or several of the above, as well as others. What is sometimes overlooked, 
however, is the administrative support infrastructure consisting of people and 
defined processes for tasks such as faculty and student recruiting, evaluations, pro­
posal submission, and so on. The secret is to understand what infrastructure is and 
what it isn’t, what the range of options are, and what the limits are. Economic con­
siderations will often set limits that cannot be exceeded, forcing hard decisions. A 
shiny new building is nice and does contribute to the idea of quality in everything, 
but it may not be necessary to your scholarly and educational success. Access to an 
archival library may be satisfied by rapid loan service from a nearby, larger facility. 
In some cases the most important infrastructure for you may be to have sufficient 
salary to attract competent staff, the training necessary to help them improve and 
advance in their careers, and the defined processes for everyone to follow.
In the computing world, it was understood and measured more than 50 years ago 
that when the load on a computer exceeded some threshold, typically 70–80% of 
maximum, that the efficiency dropped off significantly and with it the efficiency of 
the people using it. In today’s world, for anyone whose research and teaching 
involves computing, that translates to sufficient networking speed and available pro­
cessing power. Knowing that, one of my first actions was to hire a senior administra­
tor with extensive experience in a well-established unit in our field and after that an 
experienced technical infrastructure expert from a different, respected university. 
That team permitted us to build technical and administrative support structures that 
quickly became one of the favored places on campus to work. More importantly, 
that support enabled our faculty to excel in winning and performing on major 
research grants and contracts while also developing and delivering innovative edu­
cational programs.

5.6  Overarching Themes of Activity
The five themes we developed in the early 1990s guided our activities because they 
were strategic formulations, not specific objectives. They were easily derived from 
our agreed-upon principles and over-arching vision.
5.6.1  Developing Human Resources
In 1990 the College was already a functioning community and it was understood 
that this community needed to be maintained and strengthened if it was to achieve 
goals that require coordinated and mutually supportive cooperation of the majority. 
Academic units do not always form communities, a fact recognized by many in ICS 
and quickly by me as I met individuals and learned what they were doing. One can 
build a sense of community if the participants are willing, but it must be continually 
maintained in a number of ways. An integral part of this theme was also the profes­
sional development of each individual (faculty and staff) coupled with efforts 
focused on individuals to strengthen their sense of belonging to and being important 
to the larger community.
Two early activities illustrate this theme. In September 1990 the two-day faculty/
staff retreat mentioned above was held off-site in the relaxed conference facilities, 
situated in the woods, of a local company owned by an alumnus. This event helped 
build on the nascent spirit of community already present and start the process of 
envisioning a shared future and the strategic planning necessary to achieve it. This 
was followed up by a set of faculty committees that met over the next several weeks 
to come up with ideas and suggestions for different areas of importance to the entire 
College—education, major research areas, technical infrastructure, administrative 
support, and so on—specifically not discipline focused.
A second important action followed as a result: The presentation of a “Vision for 
the College of Computing” to an external Advisory Board in October 1991, men­
tioned above. This seminal event extended the community to an important group of 
external supporters and began the process of engaging faculty leaders with a group 
of well-placed national leaders in academia and industry. This presentation, while 
not a complete strategic plan, contained many of the elements of a plan and were 
then developed into an explicit strategic plan in the following year.
5.6.2  Building Infrastructure
Given the objectives of the College and based on the experience of the best comput­
ing groups in academia, it was obvious that our infrastructure needed to be addressed 
immediately and continuously to insure there was a solid foundation to support 
5.6  Overarching Themes of Activity

80
programmatic efforts. This set a tone of importance of this issue for the faculty and 
set a level of expectation for the staff most responsible for building and maintaining 
our infrastructure.
The College started with a decent physical infrastructure—two large floors of an 
almost new building and a reasonable complement of computers. The building (now 
called the College of Computing Building—CCB), while sufficient in size for the 
moment, had deficiencies in network wiring and did not afford much space for 
expansion in size of faculty, staff, labs, and student workspace. Efforts to obtain 
more space were largely unsuccessful or minimal for most of my 12 years as dean 
until the last 2 years when a significant donation was received that enabled the start 
of a large new building.
The substandard network wiring was successfully tackled almost immediately 
and was greatly augmented in the mid-1990s by the campus-wide upgrades of 
FutureNet mentioned above in preparation for the Olympics. Having newer and 
more equipment, while directly addressed from the start, was always a race between 
expanding needs and advancing technology. Of equal importance, however, was the 
people organization whose job it was to plan for and maintain the equipment and 
address the needs of everyone—students, faculty, and staff—no matter what their 
role was.
The College started with a few highly competent people on the Technical Services 
staff, some of whom went on to form the technical core and leadership of the cam­
pus computing office. At the same time, their mission was not clear beyond the 
technical needs of the equipment; as a result, I emphasized service to all compo­
nents of the College. The size and responsibilities of the technical staff were both 
increased to serve faculty, staff, and students better, based on their expressed imme­
diate and long-term needs. The result was an outstanding support organization with­
out which the resulting programmatic results could not have been achieved. It also 
served as an excellent example of the relationship between tangible and intangible 
infrastructure, motivated people, and helped produce results.
5.6.3  Engaging in Educational Reform and Innovation
The College (and its predecessor, ICS) operated from their start counter to the norm 
of infrequent, meaningful, educational reforms found in research-intensive univer­
sities. Rather than the normal course changes and curriculum shuffling one might 
expect, a clear and distinguishing theme has been true innovation in content, form, 
and delivery. These efforts have ultimately involved almost all faculty in one way or 
another, with leadership provided by the deans, associate and assistant deans, and, 
of course, the faculty.
5.2
5  Laying the Foundation for a College (1990–1995)

81

Second, the earliest truly substantive innovations of a broad and impactful nature 
were efforts to experiment with and make major changes in the introductory areas 
of the undergraduate curriculum to do two things: Focus more on lasting principles 
of computing rather than on the ever-changing technology and software, and democ­
ratize it to serve all students on campus.
The next academic year marked the beginning of a series of educational innova­
tions that have distinguished the history of the College. A redesign of the under­
graduate curriculum was completed that included a set of second-year courses 
designed to give students an early introduction to three key areas of the discipline: 
systems, software design/engineering, and artificial intelligence followed by choices 
of specialized elective courses that built on this foundation. Russ Shackelford, a 
Ph.D. graduate of CoC whose research had been on the process of learning to pro­
gram, was hired as an Instructor and began teaching the introductory programming 
course. He championed the idea of using undergraduates as peer teaching assistants 
since they connected better with the first-year students than Ph.D. students had pre­
viously; it also provided the undergrad TAs with a great learning experience. Our 
ability to hire a large number of undergraduate peer TAs proved crucial as we soon 
had to scale up our offerings as enrollments mushroomed in the late 1990s.
5.6.4  Developing Research Depth and Breadth
The very early, in-depth and highly successful expansion of our research in Human-­
Computer Interactions (HCI), led by Jim Foley and bolstered by a number of early 
hires, put us on the map as a place of serious scholarship in a field that was just 
5.6  Overarching Themes of Activity

82
emerging in the early 1990s. By creating the GVU Center that brought together 
respected faculty from across campus interested in the various ways people inter­
acted with computers under a single research banner showed the way for later cross-­
campus research interactions while further expanding our presence in the emerging 
professional community in HCI and graphics across the country and 
internationally.
Another early effort that succeeded well was to develop more strength in com­
puter science theory, an area that had already gained some prominence under Ray 
Miller. Through strategic hiring and careful attention to providing encouragement, 
strength was added to the existing theory faculty. Outreach to theoreticians in math 
and operations research schools on campus further bolstered the group, as did later 
hires from outside. Mentoring of all faculty, including through the annual review 
and promotion processes, helped faculty in all areas perform at higher levels of 
competitiveness. This helped them develop their strengths, while also helping some 
find better homes for their talents.

Building on roots developed before 1990 and several entirely new ones (to Tech), 
we developed over the next several years strengths in graphics, visualization, usabil­
ity, robotics, educational research, cybersecurity, networking, human-computer 
interaction, social computing, computer systems, data bases, and software engineer­
ing. As strength in numbers and activity in these areas increased, research centers 
were formed, including in computer systems design, robotics, and networking.
All hiring was a combination of strategic and opportunistic action. For example, 
observers of technical developments stretching back at least to the first, all-elec­
tronic telephone switching systems in the 1960s foresaw that computer networking 
was going to change the nature of telecommunications. Phillip Enslow, an ICS fac­
ulty member since the 1970s was one of those. As a result, ICS had a long history 
of being at the forefront of telecom and networking, with several established 
researchers in place when the College was created. This made a buildup in network­
ing a good strategic move. At the same time the Georgia Research Alliance (GRA), 
a partnership of the State, industry, and universities was just starting and preparing 
to provide matching funds for senior faculty hires—also a good opportunity. 
Utilizing these funds, CoC in 1993–1994 hired John Limb as a GRA Eminent 
Scholar. As a long time networking researcher with Hewlett-Packard, he was quickly 
able to establish productive working relationships with other efforts on campus, 
thus expanding our early activity in that area.
5.6.5  Engaging in Aggressive Outreach
From the start I knew that a unit larger than a department and, most especially, one 
that had aspirations to join the existing top computing units in the country, needed a 
broad portfolio of outreach activities. A few legacy senior faculty understood and 
supported this. Two activities illustrate what I mean.
Research outreach to industry was increased in a variety of ways to develop the 
connections necessary for the two-way flow of ideas and insights between basic and 
more applied research. This included encouraging interactions with industry, creat­
ing specific advisory boards for centers, encouragement of campus visits by major 
technology firms and reciprocal visits to their research centers by me and others, 
5.6  Overarching Themes of Activity

84
active outreach to top employers including starting a CoC-specific Career Fair, and 
inclusion of major industry leaders on the College’s Advisory Board.
Georgia Tech had long been a leader in Continuing Education but computing had 
only been marginally involved. In 1990, broad segments of industry were beginning 
to see the value of computing in new and advancing areas. This was recognized as a 
win-win situation if it was more closely tied to the faculty and operated in a profes­
sional manner by the College, not just a part of a larger program run centrally on the 
campus. This developed rapidly into a program very popular with professionals 
across the country. It was based on the experience and knowledge of the faculty and 
the expressed needs of the attendees. The service to the community was substantial 
as were the fiscal and relationship-building contributions to the College. By putting 
many of the faculty in touch with practicing professionals and their companies it 
helped change faculty attitudes toward applied research coupled with basic research 
and involvement in the formation of companies.
While these themes are treated separately above for expository purposes, they 
clearly were intimately tied together in dependent and empowering ways. With the 
initial context and guiding principles described above, let’s turn now to an overview 
of some of the major activities and representative events that shaped the College 
during 1990–1996.
5.7  Major Events and Activities 1990–1996
The first part of this chapter has outlined the approach I led the faculty to take from 
the start of the College in 1990. In the process of explaining and illustrating the 
approach, I gave a number of examples, some of which were drawn directly from 
what happened in that and gave a glimpse of the sequence. This second part of the 
chapter will more directly address the chronology and mention some key events and 
names. As a result, this part may not be as directly relevant to those wanting to fol­
low our approach in a new situation and less so in specifics and individual names.
The first 6 years swas dominated by activities preparing for growth. The period 
can be segmented into a quick start, and then expansion of four organizational ele­
ments essential to growth of the former school into a college: Administrative sup­
port, student support, outreach, and technical support.
5.7.1  Jump Start (July–December 1990)
Two fortuitous and unexpected events helped get the College off to a very produc­
tive start in 1990–1991: Encouragement to hire a specific, well-known faculty 
leader, and a tip that led to the hiring of an experienced and capable administrator.

The second fortuitous event came in the form of a tip in the summer of 1990 from 
a young faculty member, Richard Fujimoto. Knowing that the administrative staff 
of the former ICS was minimal, Richard mentioned to me that Vicky Jackson, long-­
time administrator in the CS Department at the University of Utah, was moving to 
Atlanta and might be interested in a job. Although ICS had been a functioning aca­
demic unit in the College of Science and Liberal Studies (COSALS), which went 
out of existence as an administrative unit in the reorganization, we no longer had the 
support and administrative organizations of COSALS to operate effectively as a 
college alongside established and much larger units on campus, especially 
Engineering.

An immediate contact with Vicky resulted in her joining CoC first as a consultant 
starting in September 1990 and then as the first Director of Administration in CoC—
essentially a chief of staff role. She continued in that position for the next decade 
and played a pivotal role in the development of the College. She not only managed 
much of the staff but personally assisted in key tasks such as making high-level 
contacts, drafting important correspondence, strategizing in a variety of areas, and 
doing whatever else needed to be done to build a strong, effective organization.
With the assistance of Vicky and inputs from several faculty, I also began plan­
ning that fall for an Inaugural Convocation to announce to the world and to the 
campus the aspirations of the new College of Computing. We planned to hold it in 
early 1991 so “save the date” announcements went out across campus and that act 
alone had a lasting effect. More on the Convocation below.
These very early events within the first few months of the life of the College were 
seminal in the history of the College. Taken together, they set initial standards and a 
sense of forward movement within the College that made a strong statement to the 
campus of our intention to fully implement the vision developed during the campus 
reorganization of 1988–1989.
5.7  Major Events and Activities 1990–1996

88
5.7.2  Initial Operation (AY91–AY96)
A number of other actions were taken over the first 6 months that had both short-­
term, and in most cases, lasting impact. At the start of the Fall Term, I announced a 
new administrative/technical structure and set of operating principles for the 
College. They were designed to improve support for students, faculty, and staff and 
enable future growth in size. In addition, I wanted to grow capability, personal sat­
isfaction, productivity, and contribution to the common good by all faculty and staff.
Among the actions I took were realignment of some staff and research faculty 
assignments. I added a few personnel at several levels including other senior staff. 
One of these was Dr. Billie Ann Rice to be Director of Continuing Education for the 
College (a new position). She had been a long-time instructor of popular courses 
and I felt could help us establish new and expanded industry contacts; she already 
had good working relations with some major service units on campus as well as in 
the Atlanta area that could be helpful to establishing the College as an independent 
entity. I also hired Dr. Russ Shackelford as an additional full-time instructor, as 
discussed above. These actions, and others taken in the first year, including strength­
ened review and counseling of graduate students, as well as of faculty, were later 
continued. Most of the actions had immediate impact and all had long-term impact 
in one form or another. These were all administrative, not tenure-track, appoint­
ments. I consulted with key faculty as well as Pete Jensen, the Associate Dean, but 
did not have to do a broad search as with faculty—all that was required at the point 
in time was the approval of my supervisor, the Provost.

It was clear, however, that some of the new industries growing up in the Atlanta 
region were very computing-focused and might be interested in supporting an aca­
demic computing unit (beyond the Rich Computer Center). Also obvious, was that 
if we wished to be considered a major player in the academic computer science 
community that we needed to be known to and work with the major, as well as up-­
and-­coming, computing companies. Thus, the hiring of Molly Croft was the initia­
tion of a fund-raising effort focused on the College. Over time, that effort paid off 
handsomely in spite of the small number of graduates interested in making dona­
tions and internal hurdles in seeking donations from alumni of other Tech schools. 
The connections with industry efforts also succeeded strongly.
Like most computer science departments at that time, the former ICS had a few 
computer servers not operated by the central campus Office of Information 
Technology and a small technical staff, some of whom were also graduate students. 
I had learned from my previous positions dating back to my graduate student days 
that a strong, professional technical support group under the control of the depart­
ment and adequate complement of computing devices was essential to the research 
and educational missions of the department.

Although the focus needed to be on building the organizational foundation, we 
did not neglect strengthening and expanding the number of faculty. In the fall of 
1991 we began advertising for faculty. The senior faculty, by then augmented by 
Jim Foley, an experienced leader himself, led the search for strong candidates.

By fall 1993, construction of new dorms and facilities along with renovation and 
upgrade of many buildings on campus to form the Olympic Village was obvious and 
somewhat disruptive. Planning for volunteer engagement, surrendering much of the 
campus to the Olympic Committee for the summer of 1996, and related activities 
began to impinge on normal campus operations. Added to this was a mandate from 
the University System of Georgia that all units must change from the quarter system 
to semesters beginning Fall Term 1998—prompting rethinking and redesign of cur­
ricula and programs geared to the academic year (just about everything!). Even 
though Georgia Tech was granted a year’s delay because of the Olympics, this, too, 
was a major, externally imposed distraction.
The rising tide of criticism of President over several issues concerning his man­
agement style and some decisions concerning preparations for the 1996 Olympics 
led to his resignation effective June 30, 1994. This change in leadership, especially 
given Crecine’s strong support for CoC, raised some concern that as one of Crecine’s 
additions to Tech that we might be threatened with being folded into another unit. 
The strength and independence of the College’s efforts had already proven them­
selves, however, and no threat every materialized. Our forward motion continued. A 
search begun earlier in the year brought a new president, G. Wayne Clough, to 
campus on September 1, 1994. Wisely, he didn’t try to alter the preparations well 
underway for the Olympics, which by then were dominating much of the adminis­
trative activity on campus.
The Computing Support Organization, led by David Leonard, continued to 
increase technical support for faculty and graduate student research, as well as 
classrooms and student computer clusters. The addition of several very experienced 
staff, some of whom had worked with ICS dating back to the 1970s, brought addi­
tional depth and new expertise. By the end of AY96, this group was operating as a 
very professional support group that made a significant contribution to the growth 
and strength of the College.
The administrative side of CoC’s operations—finance, personnel, student ser­
vices, support for proposal preparation and management of grants, faculty hiring, 
and the Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure (RPT) processes—were all in a 
much improved condition and running on a regularized basis due to the work of 
Vicky Jackson. The quality and value of this aspect of the College also began to be 
recognized and respected across campus. Most importantly, it contributed in unseen, 
but effective, ways to the successes of the faculty and students in their endeavors—
the purpose and intent of all of those operations. In March 1996 outreach and fund-­
raising activity expanded with the establishment of several endowed student 
scholarships for CoC students. Utilizing donated funds from John P. Imlay, Jr., the 
Imlay Faculty Fellowships were set up to support mid-level faculty; the first award 
was to Gregory Abowd.
GVU, under the leadership of Foley, added strength in the number of students, 
faculty from across campus, and industrial interest. Their outreach programs began 
operation to great success. Research activity in several areas flourished with its

support and guidance, and they obtained a large NSF training grant. EduTech, led 
by Kolodner, and with the key involvement of Mark Guzdial and other faculty 
across campus, obtained a significant DARPA grant for educational software and 
curricular development.
Several faculty members hired in this early period went on to leadership posi­
tions both within the College and beyond: Jessica Hodgins in graphics research, was 
a CoC assistant dean, a research leader at CMU, and Chief Scientist of Disney 
Imagineering; Gregory Abowd in software engineering and ubiquitous computing, 
served as a CoC Associate Dean, and is now Dean of Engineering at Northeastern 
University; and Ellen Zegura was Interim CoC Dean, and first CoC School of 
Computer Science Chair as well as chair of the CRA Board. Graduate student Robin 
Murphy later was given an endowed chair at Texas A&M while Beth Mynatt went 
on to have major impact at Xerox PARC, returned later as a CoC faculty member, 
and is now Dean of the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern. A 
number of other faculty and graduate students have gone on to major positions in 
academia and industry.
5.8  Summary
The first three academic years were a period of starting new activities, establishing 
new organizational structures, changing existing ones, selectively changing and 
augmenting staff, and adding a few, new faculty to replace departing or retiring 
faculty members. The next 3 years—academic years 1994, 1995, and 1996—were 
dominated by internal operational activities, some initial notable research and edu­
cational successes, and increasing involvement in and leadership of campus 
activities.
There is no room here to catalog all the faculty and student successes, but the 
sampling of facts and events in the textbox gives the flavor.
While not as visible, these and most other successes would not have been possi­
ble without the dedicated staff and organizational processes that we had built up 
over the previous 6 years that empowered the faculty and students to excel in their 
activities.
Beyond the activities overviewed above, my first 6 years was a period campus-­
wide of frantic activity preparing for the Olympics, enveloping three new colleges 
created by the reorganization in 1989–1990, and changing most of the top adminis­
tration (including all new deans). The staging of the Olympics provided a definite 
endpoint and an enforced “quiet time” for the College of Computing (and the rest of 
the campus) over the summer of 1996. Most faculty and graduate students worked 
from home, took industry internships, traveled, wrote papers and theses, attended 
technical meetings—and probably spent more time than normal with their families!

95
The summer of 1996, when the campus was largely turned over to hosting the 
Olympic Village, served as a welcome break in normal activities for almost every­
one on campus, as well as a good bookend to the starting phase of the College.
While this chapter has laid out the vision, principles, and techniques we used in 
establishing a strong foundation (and beyond), the next chapter starts to tell the 
story of the rapid expansion and growth in stature of the College of Computing up 
to the present. It covers the next 6 years while
I was dean and subsequent chapters will cover succeeding periods, as defined by 
the primary leaders. The elements of the foundation have largely endured, even as 
successive deans have had their own goals, styles, and techniques. While those 
chapters can be viewed as a set of narratives of those periods, with some connec­
tions to what has been presented in this chapter, they also represent what an endur­
ing vision and set of principles can enable.
Sampling of Additional Major Events 1990–1996
•	 Graduate student Jim Pitkow, with the help of Dr. Mimi Recker, and edu­
cational technology specialist, began taking an annual survey of World 
Wide Web users, the first such survey in the world.
•	 The first of many future DARPA robotics research contracts to Georgia 
Tech was awarded to Ron Arkin in 1993, who had just guided his Ph.D. stu­
dent, Robin Murphy, to the first robotics Ph.D. at Tech.
•	 Undergraduate John Selbie developed software to stream campus radio 
station WREK broadcasts over the Internet, one of the first two such efforts 
in the world.
•	 Larry Hodges and his collaborator, Barbara Rothbaum of Emory, pub­
lished the first controlled study on the use of virtual reality exposure for 
psychotherapy in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1995, showing the 
value of virtual reality for PTSD among other conditions.
•	 US News & World Report in 1996 ranked Georgia Tech #1 for graduate 
programs in Graphics and Human Interaction, beating out Brown, CMU, 
UNC, and MIT and ranking Georgia Tech 18th in the nation in computing 
in the same report. GVU’s successes clearly aided the college’s rankings.
•	 In AY96, CoC research expenditures exceeded $5 million, almost 2½ times 
what was spent in AY90.

Chapter 6
Building on the Foundation (1996–2002)
The first 6 years of the College of Computing was one of envisioning, designing, 
and building a foundation, but included only a very modest expansion in faculty size 
and new programs. This chapter describes what happened in the next 6 years and 
provides some elaboration of how and why we did certain things.
6.1  A Useful Pause in the Summer of 1996
A pause in one’s activities is often useful for reflection, analysis, and redirection 
along the way to a goal. In truth, I’m not sure that I nor my faculty would have done 
that individually and as a group had it not been forced on us by the Olympics effec­
tively dominating the campus over the summer. In retrospect, that extended pause 
(up to 3 months for some people) was very helpful to almost everyone, a useful 
lesson in long-term project activity, and something to which I attribute some of our 
success in the next 6 years and beyond.
While the Olympics disruption was unique in scale and impact, campuses any­
where can be subjected to forced closures for extended periods due to weather or 
other events and disruption due to massive and concentrated building or renovation 
programs. After 5 years of preparation and the near-hiatus in operations over the 
summer of 1996, the campus returned to a new normal of changed leadership 
(President Clough had only been in office for 2 years and had been wise enough to 
not make many changes as we all prepared for 1996), utilization of new facilities, 
and planning for further expansion (which Clough and a few new people began 
planning for before the Olympics)—all in all,  a less frenetic atmosphere 
You can dream, create, design, and build the most 
wonderful place in the world. But it requires people to 
make the dream a reality.

emphasizing operational effectiveness and response to new external imperatives, 
including the growing need to support economic development.
This latter issue was being felt nationally by many universities, most especially 
state-affiliated campuses, because of the emergence of many new Internet-related 
enterprises and the growing national consensus for enhanced economic develop­
ments. Georgia Tech was not only in that general position as a state-affiliated cam­
pus, but the State of Georgia had institutionalized a variety of economic development 
goals in the technology arena and we were the only technological university, public 
or private, not only in the state but in the entire region.
Beyond campus, this six-year period saw the full blooming—and crash—of the 
dotcom boom, significant improvement in Federal funding for computing research, 
and an economic decline at the end of the period. The relentless growth in the power 
of computers and the explosive growth in applications throughout society and the 
realization that information technology was changing almost everything, factors 
that were not widely understood in 1990, impacted and, no doubt, modified what we 
did. The College could no longer expect to be the beneficiary of benign neglect!

There were some important legacies of the Olympics for Georgia Tech beyond 
extended worldwide media coverage during the Games: First, renovation of all exist­
ing dormitories and eating facilities plus the construction of new dorms, all with high-
speed Internet capability unavailable off-campus, had the effect of almost doubling 
the number of on-campus student residents—an unprecedented, overnight conversion 
to a dominantly residential campus. This exciting “new” physical campus coupled 
with the State’s recently enacted HOPE scholarship program enhanced the recruit­
ment of top students from Georgia to attend Tech rather than out-of-state schools. The 
result was soon evident in the number and quality of applicants at all levels.
An example of a major legacy beneficial to the entire campus, but especially for 
the College, was FutureNet (described in Chapter 5), a campus broad-band fiber

network with multiple connections to every building and state-of-the-art internal 
connections to every office and lab in heavy-usage buildings. Many older buildings 
were upgraded physically, a new multi-million dollar natatorium was built and then 
given to the campus, existing sports facilities were upgraded and/or expanded, and 
multiple, new dormitories were added with a total of several thousand rooms. The 
Olympics paid for the upgrades and the rent on rooms in dormitories (old and new) 
and other facilities, effectively providing a substantial down payment on new build­
ings; the State-guaranteed annual payments on bonds that funded the rest of the cost 
of the new dorms could then be covered by future dorm-room rentals.
The economic situation locally and nationally in the late 1990s emphasized eco­
nomic development, especially in emerging computer-based industries. This was 
especially favorable to Georgia Tech, which, as a technologically-focused campus, 
had many of the majors and research activities that industry sought, not the least of 
which was computing. At the start of the period, the College was small, with a rela­
tively young faculty and overall not much experience in outreach to industry and 
commercialization efforts, a problem I recognized and took steps to address, as 
described below.
Traditionally, faculty activity at major universities has been divided into teach­
ing, research, and service to one’s profession or campus; in the new economic cli­
mate, service that directly aided economic development came to be highly valued. 
This also had the added advantage for CoC of emphasizing the blend of practical 
work and more fundamental research that was the staple of many faculty and a key 
tenet of our vision overall.
6.2  A Pivot to the Future
Over the next 6 years the College as a whole pivoted from foundation building to 
effective leveraging of the infrastructure, relationships, and culture built during the 
first 6 years. College-wide activity focused on strategic actions to build in size and 
impact along multiple dimensions, increasing outreach, faculty and staff develop­
ment, and hiring more faculty and additional staff to support them in their individual 
activities. The individual achievements were numerous, but before we sample them 
below, a look at some objective measures will capture the growth.
The “Snapshots of Important Measures” table below clearly illustrates the pivot 
that took place in AY97 (1996–1997), but a few caveats regarding the table are in 
order first:
–– Faculty numbers represent full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) for tenure-track 
faculty in residence only, which may differ for a variety of reasons from a roster 
of names (such as in the General Catalog).
–– University records do not record personnel numbers in an easily accessible man­
ner except for tenure-track, teaching, and research faculty. Further, some older 
records are completely inaccessible.
6.2  A Pivot to the Future

–– Some research faculty also taught a course occasionally.
–– Numbers for graduating students in AY97 may be skewed up or down because of 
the disruptions of the Olympics in 1996 to the normal graduation progress of 
students at all levels.

Space initially was two floors of the College of Computing Building, then space 
was added in two additional buildings, and finally more space in another building.
Because of the above caveats and other imprecisions, I had to make some approx­
imations indicated by (~).
In the following, I will comment on this growth.
6.2.1  Increases in Faculty and Students
The most measurable expansion for the College from 1996 to 2002 was in faculty, 
staff, and student enrollments, research funding, space, and external recognition. 
After only adding a net of four new faculty members in the first 6 years, 21 were 
added in the next 6 years, with funding coming from the increase in student hours 
taught. A dramatic increase in undergraduate majors was accompanied by substan­
tial growth in non-major service courses as will be discussed later in this chapter.
I was able to hold the number of senior staff basically level. However, support staff 
below the level of the administrative department leaders had to increase proportion­
ally to the increase in academic staff and students: From ~10 staff in AY91 to ~20 in 
AY97 to 59 in AY2002 (the first year for which an exact number could be obtained). 
In short, the strategy of building the structure from the top-down paid off by provid­
ing support for expanding the staff in advance of actual need as much as possible.
We tried to develop a formula for the ratio of support staff to faculty so that in plan­
ning future faculty hiring (the primary driver) we could approximate the number of 
6  Building on the Foundation (1996–2002)

101
staff needed. However, that effort was not entirely successful for a variety of factors; 
for example, a computer scientist engaged primarily in theoretical research, needed 
very little support, whereas one building complex systems for experimental purposes 
might need a large amount of staff support. A large operation of several hundred or 
even thousands of faculty, of course, can average for general purposes or even particu­
lar groups such as humanities, experimentalists, engineering, and so on. The effort 
over time, however, even for smaller-sized units to develop at least general guidelines 
is essential for rational management and worth the effort in growth environments.
Where we did have some success was in developing predictors for future enroll­
ments (new majors, transfers from other units, progress of students, etc.), essential 
for any school for a number of reasons. Rich LeBlanc developed some models that 
were so accurate that the central planning group for the university adopted his 
approach for general use instead of the one they had been using. This was in the 
mid- to late-1990s before planning tools were as readily available as they are today 
but the point is not that we developed them (a necessity) or that today better tools 
are available, but that rational approaches should be used when appropriate. At the 
same time, I would caution that blind application of metrics of easily definable 
items (e.g., number of students, square footage of space) and tools to measure them 
can lead to disaster if their improvement is allowed to become the goal, rather than 
helpful measures of progress to a meaningful goal (e.g., measures of student suc­
cess, impact of research).
The increase in undergraduate majors was about 80% in the first 6 years, but 
almost doubled in the next 6 years, a trend also seen nationally. The number of 
majors, however, while an important measure, doesn’t show the very large increase 
in student hours of instruction delivered that also occurred. The significant increase 
in M.S. and Ph.D. students was another direct result of having more faculty as well 
as the factors noted above. The added students, coupled with a variety of non-­
classroom and graduate advising activities of the older faculty, led to the expansion 
in the number of lecturers and instructors hired to enable experienced faculty to 
devote more of their time to other useful activities.
The expansion in funded research and research faculty (including post-docs) was 
a direct result of the faculty expansion; it might have shown a larger increase but 
many of the new faculty were just starting their careers and, in any event, it usually 
takes at least a year after a proposal is submitted to a funding agency for the expen­
diture impact to appear. The number of Ph.D. graduates understandably did not 
show a significant increase until after 2002 because of two factors. First, there was 
an upsurge in students returning to do graduate work after the dot-com bust starting 
in the fall of 2001. Second, the time it typically takes to complete a Ph.D. in com­
puting is 5 or 6 years and often more.
Infrastructure Expansion  Building on the foundations laid prior to 1996, we 
endeavored to stay ahead of the rapidly growing cohorts of faculty, staff, students, 
programs, and research activity. In spite of our best efforts, however, most infra­
structure expansions were just in time, at best. As is usually the case, available space 
on or near campus was the most critical item, followed closely for funds to upgrade 
technical infrastructure.
6.2  A Pivot to the Future

102
Space  While the space expansion shown in “Snapshots” might appear to be sub­
stantial, it was never sufficient. Lack of faculty offices, graduate student space, and 
lab space, especially for fields like robotics and systems, meant that every increase 
in personnel precipitated a scramble for space. Little or no space was available for 
meeting rooms, seminar rooms, and student workspaces. Utilization of the space the 
College could beg, borrow, or steal continued to be a major problem in spite of the 
best efforts of Vicky Jackson, Professor Jessica Hodgins, and, later, Professor Ellen 
Zegura in their roles in the College administration.

Until we finally obtained significant new space authorized as noted above, but 
not delivered until well after I had stepped down as dean, acquiring and managing 
space consumed a significant portion of my time. Getting additional space on any 
campus is usually a difficult tussle since no one ever easily relinquishes space 
assigned to them, so I employed a bottom-up approach of first identifying poten­
tially available space via informal “reconnaissance” by faculty or staff, then an 
approach to the “owner” of the space by the person I had appointed as our head of 
space, then an approach to the appropriate department chair or dean by me or other 
emissary, and only if necessary to the upper administration. At the same time, I took 
every opportunity I could to remind those in the administration above me of our 
severe needs. The strongest arguments I could make were based on the growth in the 
number of credit hours and/or external research funds for which we were responsi­
ble. Both of these factors brought money to the university which at least tended to 
remove our inherent disadvantage of being the new kid on the block.
Services  In addition to adding more staff to the Technical Services Organization 
(TSO), Financial Services, Student Services, and other support areas, all these 
groups matured and developed more procedures and services to try to keep the 
nonacademic load on faculty and students to a minimum. In many ways, this was as 
important—or more so—than just adding more staff. Two areas deserve more 
detailed description, however. On the negative side, several attempts to develop a 
communications activity that would be able to get the positive story of the work of 
the faculty and students out to a broader audience than the traditional means of just 
publishing scholarly papers never fully met expectations. The failure here was

largely due to the inexperience of the people engaged in the activity and the fact that 
managerial oversight of the communications activity was given to a person with 
experience but too many other responsibilities to give proper attention to it. 
Fortunately, my successor was able to fix the problem and the communications 
activity eventually became a campus and national leader.
On the positive side, TSO made excellent use of the high-quality campus fiber 
network to reduce the isolation of the increasingly dispersed faculty and students 
across campus and to work with the faculty to utilize the very advanced network to 
win major research awards, due in part to the existence of such a powerful technical 
infrastructure. To underscore the analysis above of the less-than-desired communi­
cations activity, TSO was headed from an early stage by a person that was highly 
skilled technically, a natural manager, and hired excellent people to work for him. 
In fairness, while both communications and technical support are important, the 
latter enables or hinders what all of us depend on daily to do our work. I understood 
that and was generally more willing to allocate scarce funds to TSO than to 
communications.
Student Expansion  The number of highly qualified applicants from the best 
undergraduate schools here and abroad increased in the latter half of the 1990s. 
Graduates at all levels were in high demand by industry and academia; all had bright 
prospects. Some joined startups or even started their own. The growing reputation 
of CoC nationally and locally, as well as the dot-com boom, resulted in steep enroll­
ment increases at all levels.
Undergraduates recognized the value, financial and academic, that a Georgia 
Tech education provided and flocked to “where the action was”—computing. This 
was not just for incoming freshmen but transfers from other universities and other 
majors on campus to the point that the College had to restrict the number of transfers. 
At the same time, the quality and preparation of the new students continued to 
increase to make CoC students among the top two or three majors on campus in 
terms of standardized test scores. They were also seen anecdotally as among the 
hardest-working and highest-achieving students. In addition to the very large enroll­
ments in beginning CS classes due to the College’s efforts to provide entry-level 
education for all Tech students, non-major enrollments expanded in highly popular 
fields such as networking, HCI, and robotics. CoC students increasingly were sought 
out by the best tech companies (e.g., Cisco, Google, IBM, Microsoft), won presti­
gious awards, went to the very best graduate schools (e.g., Berkeley, CMU, MIT, 
Stanford)—sometimes in diverse fields not directly related to computing (e.g., divin­
ity, medicine, management, and law), and started companies even while still students.
Ph.D. students were attracted by the growing research reputation of the College. 
As many startups failed and established companies contracted in the dot-com crash, 
the natural tendency of younger students was often to return to school. In a few 
cases, however, the students that returned for more advanced education had been 
very successful financially and were able to return to their first love—research and 
teaching. Master’s students were attracted for some of the same reasons, as well as 
6.2  A Pivot to the Future

104
an increasing need for advanced training in industry even as the total numbers 
needed were declining for a few years. Some graduates found faculty positions at 
top schools (e.g., Berkeley, Illinois, Santa Barbara) and the best industrial labs at 
that time (e.g., Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, IBM, Xerox PARC, and later Google), 
as well as excellent positions in a wide variety of industries and government 
organizations.
There were two very positive results of the large increase in students in CoC 
classes in the late 1990s. One was to earn the College increased respect on campus 
as a leader and an important component of campus. The second was to justify sig­
nificant increases in the funds provided to the College by the Administration due to 
the obvious need to staff properly the many classes and, in turn, to earn the campus 
additional support from the State because of the funding formula used by the 
Regents of the University System of Georgia.
At the same time, the enticements of the dotcom startups were hard to resist for 
many students and some faculty, including potential new hires. This was a distract­
ing factor but the College did not suffer a debilitating loss of students or faculty. The 
net result was to broaden and change the prevailing view of what undergraduates 
should be learning about innovation and marketable skills. The expected role of a 
faculty member also changed to include applied research and service in supporting 
economic development.
Faculty Expansion  Expansion of the faculty was enabled by budget growth due to 
the expanding enrollments, importance to economic development, and the foresight 
of the campus administration. This resulted in strategic buildups in robotics, new 
media, educational technology, telecom, information security, and systems. The 
number of full-time Lecturers was also expanded.
A number of junior faculty were hired as well as mid-level faculty with strong 
records; many of these faculty have gone on to be major leaders in research and of 
CoC as an organization. At the senior level, established senior people with signifi­
cant research reputations were hired. Among these were Dick Lipton, a member of 
the National Academy of Engineering and a widely respected researcher in CS the­
ory, security, and related subjects. At the time he was hired, Lipton was a professor 
at Princeton, but his involvement with ICS went back to the 1970s via collaboration 
with several faculty members at that time and extended well into the 1980s. Calton 
Pu, a researcher in systems with significant DARPA funding at the Oregon Research 
Institute, was hired as the first John P. Imlay, Jr. Software Chair. A third was Jarek 
Rossignac from IBM (mentioned above as new GVU Director), a noted researcher 
in computer graphics and visualization. In addition, several senior faculty members 
with primary appointments in other GT units were added as partial appointments in 
CoC (not just courtesy appointments). Faculty research activity not only expanded 
in total amount, but amount per faculty member—leveraged by more senior leader­
ship and strong staff and equipment support. Student accomplishments also contin­
ued to expand.

6.2.2  Programmatic Expansion
As the size of the faculty expanded and junior faculty progressed in their careers, 
activity in almost all areas grew from individual efforts to include more program­
matic and group efforts. Between 1996 and 2002 two new M.S. degree programs 
(M.S. in Cybersecurity and M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)) were 
developed, additional specializations in the Ph.D. program were created, existing 
programs were expanded, and new formal research centers were created. The HCI 
M.S. was a joint effort of the College of Computing, the School of Psychology, and 
the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture. Led by Albert Badre and 
using GVU as the model and springboard it was apparently the first interdisciplinary 
M.S. program in HCI nationwide and was later featured in a U.S. News and World 
Report. The program now includes Industrial Design.
The story of GTISC’s origins and growth provide an excellent example of two of 
the fundamentals on which the College is built—the breadth of computing and the 
interplay between academic activities (education and research) in computing and 
the world of practical activities. The full story could fill at least a chapter, but an 
example illustrates our outreach during this period.

primarily to listen, but not infrequently sharing an insight or suggestion that helped 
us formulate what was later hailed by many as a unique and seminal event. Phil 
Enslow (CoC) and Bill Read (International Affairs), as well as several other faculty 
members from CoC and other units across campus contributed greatly to the content 
and of the Forum. My executive assistant at the time, Ms. Jana Weber, in addition to 
helping with organization, expertly handled most of the communications with sev­
eral dozen top CEOs and government officials that we invited including the CEOs 
of IBM, Delta, UPS, the Director of the CIA, and the Defense Director of Research 
and Engineering; plus 150 other senior executives, almost all of whom attended; hun­
dreds more faculty, students, and researchers from around the country also came.
At the Forum, President Clough announced in his opening remarks the formation 
of the GT Information Security Center (GTISC). As we worked over a six-month 
period to fashion the program, it soon became clear that this was an area that Georgia 
Tech was in a position in which it could and should be a national leader. Later that 
spring we formed GTISC as a working committee and began meeting weekly with 
anywhere from 7 or 8 to up to 20 faculty and advanced graduate students in atten­
dance. In the ensuing 4 years we began hiring multiple faculty with strength in 
cybersecurity-related subjects, including two future leaders of GTISC and now SCP 
activities, Professors Sy Goodman and Wenke Lee. This strengthening of the faculty 
base and educational programs in cybersecurity continued under Deans DeMillo 
and Galil, providing the foundation on which the creation of SCP has been built. 
This led to actualization of GTISC in concrete programmatic and personnel actions 
on campus starting in the spring of 1998.
As information security became more important, the GT Information Security 
Center (GTISC) was formed later in 1998, grew rapidly in engagement, and hired 
its first full-time director in 1999. Its first impact was in education with establish­
ment of an M.S. in Information Security, and then, with the addition of more faculty 
and the reorienting of existing faculty interests, it became a presence on the national 
research scene. Later efforts under Rich DeMillo and the faculty directors of GTISC 
(Mustaque Ahamad, followed by Wenke Lee) have built GTISC into a campus-wide 
effort that now has a national reputation as one of the most important academic 
centers for research and education in cybersecurity.
GVU, the College’s oldest and largest center continued to grow and prosper 
under the leadership of Aaron Bobick, who in 2001 reframed the mission of GVU 
“to advance the state of the art of the interaction between people, computing 
machines, and information by developing technologies that naturally reflect the 
abilities and behavior of people.”
Involvement of CoC individual faculty with overseas universities had started in 
the 1960s in ICS and even included some direct agreements with foreign universi­
ties in the 1970s. The first institutional agreement between CoC and a foreign uni­
versity was signed with the 500-year-old Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, 
Spain in 1997. Led by Larry Hodges, it resulted in exchanges of graduate students 
and post-docs, and a series of short courses given there by CoC faculty and longer 
visits by their faculty to the College. A summer abroad program was established for 
Georgia Tech undergraduates (primarily CoC, but open to others), led by Norberto

Ezqeurra in cooperation with the Universitat Politécnica de Cataluña (Barcelona) in 
1999 to offer a set of courses on their campus. It was the first study abroad program 
designed for computer science majors and it continues today as a very successful 
and popular summer program.
As noted in Chapter 5, Russ Shackleford was hired in the early 1990s to teach 
and evolve our two introductory programming courses. Pascal was still the language 
used in these courses when he began and one of his tasks was to manage a transition 
to Java. As enrollments in these courses by computer science students and students 
in two large engineering majors grew substantially in the mid-1990s, Shackelford 
successfully advocated for the use of undergraduates as teaching assistants. As he 
had argued, these students were much more engaged with their responsibilities to 
the course and supportive of students than was typical for first-year Ph.D. students. 
They could also be employed in larger numbers, since they were hourly employees 
rather than more highly paid graduate teaching assistants. By 1998 they were sup­
porting enrollments of over 2000 per year in the two courses (1401 and 1402) of the 
introductory course sequence.
In the middle of the decade, Georgia Tech and the rest of the state university 
system began planning for a switch to semesters from the quarter system (see 
Chapter 5). As part of the process, a new Georgia Tech core curriculum was defined 
that included a course in computing for students in all majors. In 1999, a course 
based on the first course of the existing introductory sequence became a require­
ment for all Georgia Tech undergraduates. The challenge of scaling up to over 2000 
enrollments per year in a single course included finding enough teaching assistants, 
providing timely feedback on assignments, and attempting to meet the needs of all 
units on campus. This was more difficult than we had anticipated and we thus 
quickly found ourselves offering one of the most unpopular courses on campus!
This situation led to several rounds of modifications of our approach. These 
efforts included close cooperation with some of the Engineering schools that were 
heavy computing users as well as development of a Media Computation course by 
Mark Guzdial aimed at students in less technical majors. These modifications ulti­
mately resulted in a sustainable set of three courses that met the needs of all majors 
while keeping the demands on the College’s resources within reasonable limits. 
This was especially critical since at about the same time the number of students 
wanting to major, or at least minor, in computing was growing rapidly. An addi­
tional development took place starting in 2003 that demanded immediate and deci­
sive steps—a large cheating scandal involving hundreds of students in the single 
introductory computing course still being offered at that time. While interesting and 
informative, further discussion of these two developments (continued modification 
and the cheating scandal) requires more detail than fits with the main storyline of 
this book.
Another aspect of the switch to semesters showed the durability and usefulness 
of the curriculum redesign done in the early 1990s. As part of this effort, the faculty 
first developed a new curriculum which, when evaluated for implementation, proved 
too inflexible for students and created too many courses to be handled by the size of 
the faculty. A revised design was then built on the gateway courses concept from the

1991 curriculum, defining a core of required courses that ended in the sophomore 
year, with students then choosing two specialization tracks plus a capstone project 
to complete their degree requirements—a forerunner of the Threads curriculum 
introduced in 2006.

Outreach  Building on the foundations laid in the early 1990s, the College success­
fully reached out in a number of ways beyond the ever-increasing research results, 
reputations, and activities of the faculty and the students. The most notable and 
certainly the most durable success came in 2000, following up on approval by the 
Board of Regents for a new computing research building if a significant amount of 
private donations could be obtained to augment the approved state funds.

The first endowed chair was created in 1997 with a donation by Frederick 
G. Storey, with Richard Lipton later becoming the first holder of the chair. That 
effort was aided by Molly Croft, whose efforts also enabled an additional donation 
from John P. Imlay, Jr. which with funds previously donated by him, was used to 
create the first Dean’s Chair on campus, named in his honor—the John P. Imlay, Jr.

Incoming Governor Roy Barnes announced in January 1999 an ambitious eco­
nomic development program, the Yamacraw Project. A key feature of the program 
was endowment of new chaired professorships, including in CoC. Funding was also 
provided for additional faculty positions that proved to be crucial for our ability to 
handle rapidly growing demand for our undergraduate program. Jim Foley returned 
from a leave in industry to become Executive Director of the Project, and shortly 
afterward Rich LeBlanc stepped down as Associate Dean to become Yamacraw 
Director of Education.
In 2001 a Tenth Anniversary Celebration was held with a variety of events, 
including: (Former) Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno giving the 
Inaugural Thomas E. Noonan Lecture on Information Security; a banquet featuring 
former President Crecine; a convocation, “Computing the Next Ten Years,” featur­
ing talks by Raj Reddy (CMU), William Malik (Gartner Group), and Craig Mundie 
(Microsoft); a picnic lunch for everyone in CoC; and a reception to which the entire 
campus was invited and to which over 400 attended.
6.3  Facing the Future
By the start of the 2001–2002 academic year, the College of Computing was a func­
tioning, college-level organization. The previous 6 years had seen substantial growth 
in all objective measures, as discussed above, as well as in the internal mechanisms, 
protocols, and policies that define an organization and allow it to run smoothly. 
Further, there was a strong sense of respect for others by almost all members of the 
College and a shared belief that their wide-ranging research areas and modalities 
stemmed from some common, undefined body of knowledge and fundamental inter­
ests. It was the kind of spirit and commonality of high-level objectives that can be 
found in various, successful organizations, although perhaps less-so in an academic 
organization of a fairly large size.
At the same time, there were factors that threatened the continued smooth opera­
tion. The size of the faculty (including the number of research faculty), senior staff 
managers, technical staff, and support personnel had already reached or exceeded 
the size that could be properly guided by a dean and one or two associate/assistant 
deans without more internal structure. ECE, for example, was larger but for two 
reasons had developed an effective internal organization that worked well—they 
had many more senior and experienced faculty members that could serve as the de 
facto chairs of content groups composed of faculty (e.g., computer engineering, 
signal processing, and so on) and as an older field it was easier to define content 
5 It is worth noting that organizing the Forum was not only an “outreach activity,” but resulted in 
sparking a new campus-wide programmatic activity (GTISC) that is now seen as contributing 
substantially on the national scene to a subject of high societal priority.

113
groups that centered around a coherent set of research questions and related educa­
tional objectives. Needless to say, for the young, rapidly growing, and expanding 
field of computing, this was not yet possible.
The senior faculty and I explicitly addressed this need at our quarterly strategy 
dinners. I began by asking senior faculty members in several areas to begin to take 
on the role of area leaders; this partially reduced the demand on myself and my 
senior associates as well as providing better guidance of junior faculty. 
Implementation of this structure focused on mentoring and the annual evaluation 
process, but for a variety of reasons moved slowly and at various rates in each area. 
As a result, it was not fully rooted nor made a priority.
Beyond this structural issue, several operational problems had arisen that 
demanded our attention. Corporate donations and engagements for joint research 
and other collaborations were down; development of the first offerings of new 
courses dwindled; continuing education, which had brought a steady stream of rev­
enue that supported other activities, was dropping precipitously; and, management 
procedures/processes were not keeping up with the growth and variety of the busi­
ness operations of the College.
In short, the size of the faculty, staff, and student cohorts had grown beyond the 
bounds of “campfire management” (a phrase used by Provost Michael Thomas). 
Some of these challenges were understood and had been discussed (i.e., that it was 
time to restructure the College into schools or other organizational structures) while 
others may not have been sufficiently recognized (e.g., the need for better financial 
management mechanisms). The analogy could be made that the College was like a 
successful startup company that had reached a size (well over 100 faculty, research­
ers, and senior staff) at which the skills of a new set of leaders with some different 
skills were needed.
This is a good example of the “5-year rule” that I set out in 1990 to follow: For 
the health of an organization, to say nothing of the individuals in leadership posi­
tions themselves, a change at the top is needed after a small number of years. A 
similar “rule” has been observed and documented in numerous startup organiza­
tions: Once the organization reaches a size of somewhere between 100 and 120 
people, those that led the startup need to step aside for a new set of leaders that can 
take the organization to the next level. I was aware of both “rules,” but in spite of my 
best efforts it didn’t work out that way! At about that time, more rigorously defined 
reviews for deans and other senior leaders were instituted at Georgia Tech that, at 
least, provide an opportunity for objective review and orderly change, if needed. It 
might have been in my case!
In late 2001 I was recommended by a committee of national computing leaders 
for the position Washington DC of Assistant Director of the National Science 
Foundation for Computing and Information Science and Engineering. In early 2002, 
I accepted the offer, effective in May 2002 at the end of the academic term (I was 
teaching, as had been my habit since becoming dean 12 years earlier). This was a 
position in which I would be responsible for NSF funding in all areas of computer 
science, computer engineering, high-performance computing, human-centered 
computing, and other related fields as well as being part of the team that managed 
6.3  Facing the Future

114
NSF broadly. (In 2006 I officially retired from Georgia Tech and then stepped down 
from my NSF position in January 2007.) At that time, NSF was responsible for 
funding over 85% of basic computer science research in the country.
The principles used from the start—breadth of computing, community, impor­
tance of individuals, quality, and role of infrastructure—can be seen in the five 
themes that characterize 12 years of growth along multiple dimensions—develop­
ment of collective human resources, infrastructure development, educational inno­
vation, research depth and breadth, and aggressive outreach. These 12 years carried 
forward and actualized the visions of Dorothy Crosland, Vladimir Slamecka, Ray 
Miller, Pete Jensen, and Pat Crecine to make Georgia Tech a world leader in the new 
world of information processed by computers—computing. Most of all, the overall 
quality and leadership of the faculty and leaders assembled starting in 1964–65 and 
continuing to the present have built the internationally ranked College of Computing. 
The solid foundation that was built from 1990–2002 on the farsighted visions that 
preceded the College has enabled the growth and innovations and individual accom­
plishments since.
The five guiding principles articulated above taken together form a vision of a 
new form of an academic computing organization. In one form or another, that 
vision describes what those that came before saw for the future. I am, indeed, fortu­
nate to have had a small part to play in helping carry that vision forward, expanding 
it in the context of the late twentieth century in the process.
There were three primary reasons I chose to step down at that time. The position 
of Assistant Director of NSF for CISE was a desirable position of considerable 
influence on the Nation’s computing research activity to which I felt that I could 
contribute and that typically did not become open for a stretch of at least 4 or 
5 years; it became the proximate reason for me to leave Tech. Second, I had come 
to Georgia Tech in 1990 with the intention of only staying 5 or 6 years before seek­
ing another position for the health of the College as well as my career path; the 
advent of the Olympics had delayed any thought of moving on until after 1996. 
However, as early as 1997 I had considered several other potential moves, but 
decided against them. Third, throughout my 12 years I had commuted every week 
or two to my home in Washington where my wife had a good position with the 
Smithsonian; it was time to return to a non-commuting lifestyle.

Ellen Zegura had shown her ability to manage multiple professional responsibili­
ties at the same time: Teaching, maintaining an active research program, serving as 
Assistant Dean, and being the College’s representative to the Administration and to 
the firms that were creating the new Klaus Advanced Computing Building. Her 
responsibilities representing the College regarding everything related to the new 
building were quite time-consuming, involved making many major decisions, and 
required substantial time on tasks that a faculty member does not normally have. 
Her ability to do that had not escaped the attention of the Provost. In addition, this 
meant that she sat in many meetings with me and other senior administrative staff 
so that she was quite familiar with the administrative side of the College as well as 
with the top administration and they were familiar with her as well.

116
During Ellen’s short tenure, construction began on the new Klaus Building which 
added yet another new set of responsibilities––planning for the move to the new 
building. Most of the year-end administrative actions—completion of onboarding 
of new faculty, drafting a raise plan for the new year, and other actions had either 
been taken care of or could be handled by the very capable senior staff—except for 
three: Balancing a serious deficit in the College’s budget due to declining Continuing 
Education revenue and other factors, updating the faculty and staff raise plans under 
constantly shifting criteria due to a serious budget problem at the state (and campus) 
level, and completion of the hiring package for Rich DeMillo to join the faculty and 
be the Director of the Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC). This was 
a recruitment of several years duration that I had handled personally, but the final 
paperwork was left to Ellen to complete before July. Her 2020 interview (cited 
above) contains some interesting details about her participation in the design and 
construction of the Klaus Building, as well as about her time as Interim Dean.
In July, Rich DeMillo joined the faculty officially and was appointed Director of 
GTISC.  In August, Ellen Zegura had the honor of awarding the first M.S. in 
Information Security to Michael Edward Torrey. Space had been obtained in the 
Tech Square Research Building (TSRB)—called the Yamacraw Building at the 
time—to move the GVU Center there in December, but the preparations for that 
were done under her direction.
The story of the College of Computing does not end here, of course. In the next 
two chapters, I will present highlights of the next 20 years. My coverage of those 
years will be less detailed because I was not there to witness them, the lack of acces­
sible records, and the fact that the outcomes of some of the actions taken by my 
successors are still unfolding.
6.5  Summary
By the summer of 1996, it was clear that we had a compelling vision for the future 
that was worth striving for, useful principles and themes, and a strong and robust 
operational infrastructure of people and equipment. At the same time, the number of 
faculty was small compared to many other academic computing departments around 
the country and a fraction of those considered to be leaders to whose ranks we 
aspired. While there were some important programmatic developments, much of the 
activity was focused on expanding new faculty and integrating them into our com­
munity. It was also a period of starting to think about an organizational future 
beyond initiation. The next chapter will continue the story of the growth of the 
College in size and reputation under the second Dean of Computing that would bet­
ter situate it for continued growth.

Chapter 7
Strategic Expansion (2002–2010)
In the spring of 2002, I was focused on my new position at NSF that was due to 
begin in May. I did not spend much time looking back and assessing where the 
College of Computing was, even though I cared deeply about its status (and still do). 
I knew that things in the College were on an even keel albeit with some developing 
problems and needed changes, it was moving forward with a good cohort of matur­
ing leaders, and I was not worried. However, two people at Tech had been watching 
and assessing the College’s place at Tech and in the wider world of academe—
President G. Wayne Clough and Provost Jean-Lou Chameau. It soon became clear 
to my successor that they believed the College had a great future and were prepared 
to support that, not only in the interests of the College, but as a strategic driver for 
Georgia Tech.
1
1 The fact that I had been considered seriously in the late 1990s for provost at several good schools 
(and turned down one offer at the last minute) would certainly have been known to them––clear 
signals that I probably would not stay at Tech forever.
You never change things by fighting the existing 
reality. To change something, build a new model that 
makes the existing model obsolete.

7.1  The Demillo Era (2002–2008)
Strategic Expansion
Richard A. DeMillo had a long history with the predecessors of the College, having 
been one of the first Ph.D. graduates (the first in computer science) and then in 1976 
one of the early faculty members in the School of Information and Computer 
Science (ICS)—leaving in 1988 only shortly before the College was formed. With 
this background, his continuing knowledge of and interest in Georgia Tech, his

service on the CoC Advisory Board, and the fact that he was already in transition 
from his previous position (CTO of Hewlett Packard), he was able to take over the 
reins of the College quickly. As an experienced leader (he had also held a senior 
position at Bellcore—the successor to the famous Bell Telephone Labs) so he knew 
how to come into an organization and move rapidly to obtain results.
­
2
This clear mandate, similar to the one given to me by President Crecine, but more 
explicit, resonated well with DeMillo’s experience in industry as a research execu­
tive where direct “orders” and measurable results were the norm. His experience 
and leadership approach was recognized by Clough and Chameau as what was 
needed to continue and strengthen the by-the-then-recognized and valued expan­
sion, work quality, and rise in the rankings of the College that had begun in 1990. 
As senior executives, they were focused on getting results and have problems dealt 
with by the deans and others without creating additional problems; they judged that 
DeMillo could do that in an academic environment.
At an initial faculty retreat DeMillo held in his first week as dean he provided a 
personal view of the real-world of computing from the perspective of a senior exec­
utive at a major computer company, which he had until very recently been. His 
intentions were apparently to awaken the faculty to both the positive and negative 
aspects of the implications of that worldview for the potential future of the College. 
Although perhaps not as explicitly, it also foreshadowed some of the actions that he 
intended to take. After the opening presentation, the group then engaged in

Rich DeMillo (1947– ) has the longest history with Georgia Tech of any active 
member of the current College of Computing and is among a very few still on 
campus with such a long history. He holds a Master’s and Ph.D. from Tech, 
was an early faculty member, at Tech, a faculty member at Purdue, and has 
held visiting positions at several universities. He has had a distinguished 
academic career as well as holding senior positions in government and 
industry, including as Director of the Computer Research Division at NSF, VP 
of Computer Research at Bell Communications Research, and CTO of 
Hewlett-Packard. After stepping down as Dean of Computing in 2008, he 
continued at Georgia Tech as a faculty member and Director of the Center for 
the 21st Century University.

discussions of “What do we want to be?” This built on previous faculty conversa­
tions and continued after the retreat as well. A tangible outcome of those discus­
sions was the appointment of a faculty task force to consider what the structure of 
the College should be and subsequently a charge to it by the dean to write a report 
by the end of the 2003 spring term. The narrative of the restructuring of CoC will be 
covered below.
The story of DeMillo’s six-year time as dean can best be told in a series of nar­
ratives describing major areas of College-wide activity and impact during his six 
years as dean:
Structural Changes, People, Strategic Actions in Educational Programs, and 
Research Centers.
A few other items are included for historical completeness.
7.2  Structural Changes
In my presentations to the CoC Advisory Board in the later years of my tenure as 
dean, I had discussed the need to sub-divide the College in some way that would 
take into account my prior discussions with the senior faculty, the divergence of 
research interests and, to some extent, the lack of enough senior faculty to handle 
some of the important, faculty-oriented tasks such as mentoring, program direction, 
and representation on campus committees. This had prepared DeMillo on the need 
for dividing the College into sub-units and he knew that it was overdue; as a result 
that was the first thing he addressed.

Both division names encountered pushback and questions from the faculty. 
Every faculty member tended to think that their area of expertise was “core” (i.e., 
central). Because “Interactive Computing” didn’t describe everything included in 
that division this caused concern. Then since almost all of the faculty in the IC 
Division were also associated with GVU, the question arose as to why GVU as an 
organizational entity was still needed. The “core” question was never satisfactorily 
answered but the name remained; the GVU question was resolved by arguing that 
GVU also involved a substantial number of faculty from outside the College—prob­
ably more than from inside—and thus provided an important outreach across cam­
pus that was not within the charter of IC.
After two years of operation with the new structure in which the Chair of IC 
(Bobick) was also the Director of GVU, Beth Mynatt was appointed the new GVU 
Director in July 2005. This made clear that the IC Division encompassed more than 
GVU. This was driven primarily by the growth in robotics as well human-centered 
computing (HCC). Both fields share some commonality with the core interests of

GVU members but are (or were becoming at the time in the case of HCC) distinct 
fields with elements not common to GVU. While GVU could have become an 
umbrella organization covering a number of loosely allied fields, separation was a 
strategic move that allowed each organization to focus on a well-defined set of 
interests.

DeMillo’s plan was to work toward schoolhood of the divisions to be true degree-­
granting units, a good tactical move. Eventually, this would permit greater growth 
as well as greater independence from other units. Creating a degree-granting school 
required not only campus administrative approval, but also approval of the Faculty 
Senate and ultimately the Regents—a goal not achieved until February 2007 when 
the School of Computer Science and the School of Interactive Computing were 
approved by the Regents to begin operation within the College as degree-granting 
units. The chairs of the previous divisions with similar names became the first chairs 
of the new schools. CSE continued as a division for the time being since it was still 
quite small.
The resulting structure of the College has remained essentially the same for fif­
teen years and it is only today (2022) that a fourth school (Cybersecurity and 
Privacy) has been newly formed. Officially, it came into existence on July 1, 2021 
with former Dean Rich DeMillo serving as the Interim Chair of the new School 
while a search was conducted for a new chair. At the same time, some aspects of 
CoC have yet to be fully reconciled into a traditional college-with-independent-­
schools structure, specifically the ownership of the flagship computer science 
degrees.

7  Strategic Expansion (2002–2010)

123
While there are currently eight Ph.D. degrees and twelve M.S. degrees that are 
run by the schools (some in cooperation with other Georgia Tech Schools and 
Colleges), there are only two undergraduate degrees in CoC—B.S. in Computer 
Science (by far the largest), the responsibility of the School of Computer Science, 
and the B.S. in Computational Media, a joint program of the School of Literature, 
Media, and Communication in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and the 
College of Computing. Undergraduate instruction in CS, however, is handled by a 
combination of full-time instructors in a Division of Computing Instruction (report­
ing directly to the dean) and faculty from across the College. This poses a some­
times troublesome disconnect between providing Ph.D./M.S. instruction/supervision 
by the schools from the College-wide provision of undergraduate instruction.
This structure, focusing responsibility for undergraduate education at the college 
level, does emphasize to some extent the commonality of computer science to all of 
the degrees and research activity of the College. At the same time, some feel that it 
may remove most faculty too much from control and direction of the undergraduate 
program while others are very pleased with the arrangement since it allows them to 
focus more on the graduate curriculum and their research—a conundrum which 
probably won’t be resolved any time soon, if ever. Viewed in a larger context, this is 
a result of the need for instruction in underlying, disciplinary-focused subjects as 
well as in more problem-specific subjects in a world in which many of the problems 
facing society require computing knowledge across the spectrum to address 
successfully.
One very positive move, at least in the eyes of some faculty, however, was the 
creation of the Division of Computing Instruction. At many institutions with a 
strong and large group of tenure-track of faculty who both teach and carry out active 
research programs, there may be a number of instructionally focused professionals 
they often have little or no say in what is taught (or even how it is taught). Having a 
separate Division housing those professionals that focus on teaching, with perhaps 
some involvement in research, and giving them a fair amount of self-control over 
their teaching enables hiring and motivating them. This in turn, permits oversight by 
the faculty in general terms rather than in a lot of details.
It is generally seen by most people that have been interviewed for this book and 
as well as by others that the restructuring of the College is the premier accomplish­
ment of Rich DeMillo’s tenure as dean. While not perfect and something that will 
and should continue to evolve as conditions change, it was an essential step in the 
growth of the College and one that has turned out as well as could be expected.
7.3  People
An academic unit is only as strong as the people in it, coupled with the way in which 
they are encouraged to excel individually and work together to form a community 
that is stronger than the sum of their individual accomplishments. Key, of course, is 
to hire top-quality people, a principle followed in the College from the start and

continued during DeMillo’s tenure. The faculty grew by approximately twelve new, 
tenure-track faculty, along with several appointments joint with other units, senior 
staff, full- and part-time lecturers, and researchers that are not considered tenure-­
track. It should be noted that a precise count is not possible on a simple year-over-­
year basis because of variable starting times, resignations, leaves, joint appointments, 
and so on. The traditional count by FTE (full-time equivalent positions, the standard 
measure in assessing faculty size) usually translates into more people than FTEs. I 
try to focus on the people, not the numbers per se.
5
7.3.1  New Faculty
In a large, mature college the dean is not usually involved in routine faculty hiring 
until a department forwards a proposed hire for the dean’s evaluation and, hopefully, 
approval. That was not the situation that DeMillo had at the start of his tenure, espe­
cially for senior hires since the CoC was still growing in a number of areas and the 
chairs of the just-formed Divisions and soon thereafter Schools were not experi­
enced in hiring in the role of unit heads. The situation for leaders of research centers 
varies, but for large centers it is not uncommon that the dean to which the center 
reports chooses the directors; however, in some situations centers report not to the 
head of an academic unit but to a vice-president or provost of the campus. In the 
case of the College of Computing at that time, GVU and GTISC, although including 
faculty from across campus, were led by CoC and the dean had the responsibility of 
choosing and supervising their directors. As a result, DeMillo was more involved in 
hiring faculty than later deans, but less than I was when the College was just starting 
to grow beyond the size of a normal school.

Next, DeMillo set out to replace himself as Director of GTISC. He was well-­
acquainted with a highly respected researcher in cryptography at Xerox PARC, 
Ralph Merkel, and convinced him to come to Tech as a faculty member and Director 
of GTISC.  Faculty, however, raised some issues with the process of recruiting 
Merkel since it was done outside the usual hiring process of the faculty overseeing 
initial identification of potential faculty from which they would select a small subset 
of candidates that met agree-upon criteria and then forward those names to the dean 
for selection. The manner in which Furst had recently been hired was similar and 
the faculty apparently decided to insist on a more faculty-driven process. The issues 
were resolved eventually and Merkel joined the faculty in September 2003. 
Unfortunately, eminent researchers do not always make good leaders of others, let 
alone good managers. This was the case with Merkel and he left after three years.
At about the time the Division (later, School) of Computational Science and 
Engineering (CSE) was announced in 2005, with Richard Fujimoto as Founding 
Chair, two new faculty were hired to join Richard. The first was Haesun Park, a 
senior professor at the University of Minnesota and an NSF Program Director. Her 
personal accomplishments and broad knowledge and connections in the field from 
her service at NSF, complemented well those of Fujimoto. She later became the 
third Chair of CSE.
The second faculty hire for CSE was a young and rising star in the world of high-­
performance computing (HPC), David Bader, who had already made a mark for 
himself in his first academic position at the University of New Mexico. His research

is no public documentation, but Furst was probably considered by them as a possible candidate.

drive contributed measurably to the strength of the small, but growing, unit. Five 
years later he followed Fujimoto as school chair.

Since my focus in this book is on the organizational history of CoC, not on the 
complete historical record of every coming and going, I do not mention every fac­
ulty member that was hired or left during each dean’s time. At the same time, in 
addition to those mentioned in this volume that were hired between 2003 and 2008 
and immediately assumed either organizational leadership or provided impactful 
intellectual leadership, several others should be mentioned because of their eventual 
leadership roles in the College. Among these are Alberto Apostolico, Tom Conte, 
Keith Edwards, Beki Grinter, Santosh Vempala, and Eric Vigoda. All went on to 
build or continue strong research and education programs as well as taking on 
important organizational leadership roles that impacted the entire College. A num­
ber of full-time instructional faculty were also added, but no numbers are readily 
available.
7.3.2  Staff
Hard data on the size of administrative and support staff is not available, but as the 
College and its programs grew, so did the staff. Before dividing CoC into Divisions 
and then Schools, all direct support for academic and faculty functions was pro­
vided by the CoC staff. Once schools were set up, they each needed to have their 
own financial officers and other support staff. Because of the centralization of the 
undergraduate program and the fact that a strong and growing instructional staff 
carried much of the load of lower-division teaching and advising, most of that con­
tinued to be handled at the College level, along with counseling and other student 
support functions, as noted above.
Many of the functions of the Technical Services Organization (TSO) were taken 
over by the campus Office of Information Technology (OIT) during DeMillo’s time

and several key staff transferred to OIT, including David Leonard and his senior 
staff. Apparently, the central administration began refusing to provide funds at the 
College or School level for computer operations that could be provided by OIT, 
creating a budget problem for the College. Because budget issues are often not 
made known to the faculty in any detail, this led to some disagreement among fac­
ulty over the wisdom of the downsizing move imposed on TSO.
7.3.3  Loss of Two Pioneers
Alton P. (Pete) Jensen arguably possessed the longest history of contribution to the 
growth of computing at Tech when he passed away on February 6, 2005. As an 
Emeritus Professor, he continued to advise me professionally and personally in 
regular, private meetings as long as I was dean. His perspective and advice was 
always very helpful.
Vladimir Slamecka, the Director of the first academic computing unit at Tech, 
the School of Information Science, passed away in 2006. Only shortly before I 
stepped down did I make Vladimir’s personal acquaintance, but in several long con­
versations at his home benefited greatly from his counsel; I regret not having had 
those earlier in my tenure as dean—my loss professionally and personally.

As is the standard in established universities and senior colleges (those that have 
only limited graduate programs at the Ph.D. level) the faculty are responsible for 
educational matters—they are the experts, after all. Yet, for a faculty of any size, 
someone must serve as a focal point to organize individual efforts to create and/or 
make major changes to educational programs; that someone is often a faculty mem­
ber with a special passion for and knowledge of the issue at hand, but it may also be 
the department head or even the dean. Someone must also provide or obtain the 
necessary resources, such as release time, staff support, and perhaps travel funds to 
visit other universities to study their programs close-up or build new facilities; that 
person is usually the department head or dean, aided in some cases by faculty 
obtaining external grants to support an effort.
DeMillo came in as dean with knowledge of the current status of the educational 
programs in the College from his service on my Advisory Board, previous academic 
positions, previous collegial relationships with several people at Tech, and his most 
recent position in which he was in close contact with many of the country’s top 
schools; he was thus aware of what was going on locally and nationally in

computing education. As a result, it appears that he knew from day one that the CoC 
undergraduate curriculum needed some major renovation and had hired Merrick 
Furst, at least partly, to spearhead that effort. The next section will outline several 
important educational developments during this period.

Based on his dual graduate training in computer science and in educational the­
ory as well as his experience in teaching beginning computer science courses, 
Guzdial had the insight that the problem for the lower-achieving students was not 
brainpower (they were Georgia Tech students, after all!) but motivation in that par­
ticular course. That lack was not a fundamental one nor due to the instructor (there 
were many), but rather lack of interest in the examples used in the basic

Hall, 2000.
 
7  Strategic Expansion (2002–2010)

129
programming course and the seeming irrelevance of the course to their real interest. 
He further postulated, based on his earlier teaching at Georgia Tech, that creating 
and manipulating (digital) media was a topic that was relevant to, or at least an ele­
ment of, nonscientific topics such as history or architecture.
10
The new course, Media Computation, was almost immediately successful with a 
success rate around 85%, a rate that has been maintained up to the present. For 
Guzdial, it was not only a great contribution to the College, but provided him an 
excellent environment for evaluative research that helped refine the course design 
and illustrate its efficacy. Even before he and his collaborators and students started 
publishing the results, their success was copied by a number of other schools, 
including nontechnical universities.
By 2005 the basic course and several more advanced media computation courses 
were attracting enough students in their own right, not just those required to take it 
as a part of some other major, that the College created the B.S. in Computational 
Media degree in close collaboration with Dean Sue Rosser of the Ivan Allen College 
of Liberal Arts. Several other people, including Provost Jean-Lou Chameau were 
involved in getting this started, with Aaron Bobick as the local point person. For 
marketing reasons the degree had “Computation” first in the title, although the orig­
inal course titles remained since it was “media” that attracted the students. It was the 
first undergraduate degree at Tech that was truly joint between two Colleges.

10 ‘Media computation’ means manipulating the individual pixels of a picture or bytes of a sound 
sample by means of a program, not ‘computation by media.’
11 A number of years later in 2016 I was teaching a senior course at CoC and one of the top students 
on campus (and in my class) was a Computational Media major. I doubt she would have majored 
in computing without the B.S. in Computational Media (her sister chose CS at Stanford instead) 
and upon graduation took a position as an assistant to Steven Colbert, the creator and host of a 
popular, late-night TV show—not the usual type of position for a computing graduate (!) and a 
small example of the usefulness of the Computational Media degree to a broader selection of 
students.

7.4.2  Threads™ Through the BS in Computer Science
Beginning in the early 2000s, discussions were underway in the College about the 
continuing decline in enrollments in computing–Why was it happening and what 
could be done about it? Similar discussions were underway elsewhere and proposals 
for new degrees in CS + X where X was a field like biotechnology or finance that 
heavily used computing functionalities and CS concepts such as parallel activities 
and abstractions. DeMillo and others in the College (since the College as a whole 
was responsible for the Computer Science B.S.) visited a number of places that 
hired CoC graduates and also schools that were actively struggling with the same 
curricular problem to understand why enrollments were falling (a national 
phenomenon).
Two complementary conclusions came out—(1) the new world of information 
work in the 21st century demanded many different specializations, all based on or 
closely related to computer science, and (2) most computing curricula at that time 
were too rigid and increasingly did not permit students to develop individualized 
courses of study that fit their interests and talents. In short, the CS + X model that 
was being considered and even attempted elsewhere wasn’t going to work very well 
in attracting and educating new students to computing who wanted (and needed) a 
solid computing education that would prepare them for work in fields beyond the 
traditional core fields of computer science.
These conclusions led the College faculty, led by Charles Isbell with the assis­
tance of Associate Dean Merrick Furst, to develop a uniquely computer science 
solution: A platform for combining various strands of courses (some newly 
designed) that would fulfill these two objectives. They called it “Threads” since if 
one visualized a large collection of individual topics (or courses) as dots and then 
drew a line among a subset of the dots to form a coherent theme, the line would look 
like a thread running through the dots that represented courses. They defined nine 
threads (not a magic number) that covered most of the areas of computing at that 
time. If one permitted the threads to be drawn in a large number of ways with only 
a few restrictions on the courses taken, then the result would be a large number of 
“curricula” that a student could design for themselves in the context of their role 
(i.e., what they wanted to do) in an area of the real world which they saw themselves 
entering.

13
In 2006, work began on implementing the concept and working out a number of 
kinks and wrinkles. As students began to return to computing as a major and the 
flexibility of the new framework was made known to prospective students, the num­
ber of majors jumped 20% in the fall of 2006 over the previous year. Enrollment in 
the BS/CS major has continued to grow ever since so that today it is the largest 
major on campus while withstanding the pressure of a three-fold increase in enroll­
ment in just a few years. Today the Threads concept is still in place, running 
smoothly, and has been adopted in some form by several leading computer science 
departments, as well as much more widely in the educational world.
Some faculty have observed that Threads is not fundamentally different from the 
ability that CoC students had all along to choose specializations to fit their objec­
tives while still obtaining a solid grounding in the fundamentals of computer sci­
ence. Arguably, that may be fairly accurate, but what it did do was to conceptualize 
the needed flexibility in today’s world and expand it, introduce the overlaying idea 
of “roles,” and provide a clear framework for students (and their parents), academic 
advisors, and faculty members to think about courses and curricula in a more orga­
nized and rational manner.

The third educational development was the creation of the Computational Science 
and Engineering School (starting in July 2005) that would include an interdisciplin­
ary curriculum that went with the research interests of the faculty brought into the 
new school. This was an effort across multiple colleges and offices, especially sev­
eral schools in Engineering and Science, which required not only the blessing, but

the participation, of DeMillo and other top administrators in securing the coopera­
tion of his counterparts. As with several other efforts at the campus level, the inter­
actions with and agreement with some of the units were more complex and involved 
than is represented here.
The initial focus on graduate programs began with developing a Ph.D. and 
M.S. in CSE. Founding Chair Richard Fujimoto reached out to faculty and school 
leadership in multiple departments across the Colleges of Science and of Engineering. 
He found that they were quite receptive to cooperation and as a result the programs 
were interdisciplinary from the start. This made it materially easier to recruit new 
faculty, as well as to build on existing educational efforts in or relevant to CSE 
across campus. A part of this curriculum development area was the definition of the 
intellectual core of CSE on which the various degrees could be built. This later 
made it easy to develop a modeling and simulation thread in the undergraduate CS 
program. One of the innovations was to insist that undergraduate courses listed in 
the CS program have the catalog designation “CX” (e.g., CX 4010), the “X” desig­
nating that the course did not belong to a specific School.
At the same time that the M.S. in CSE was developed, they produced an on-line 
version that was offered for some time through the GT Continuing Education 
Department; it was given in the older mode of canned lectures with supporting 
material. Although developed before MOOCs and later the OMSCS Program (see 
next chapter), it did provide useful experience for faculty teaching it in giving lec­
tures that had to be well-organized and given before a camera. It also helped to build 
the reputation of the School in important centers of computational science and engi­
neering activity around the country, such as the national laboratories.
These educational activities along with others not mentioned here, coupled with 
the well-rounded research activities of the School, resulted in providing the campus 
a strong leadership position nationally in the increasingly important computational 
science and engineering field. Under Rischard Fujimoto’s leadership, the budding 
new school grew in size, strength, and reputation in a surprisingly short amount 
of time.
This was another idea which can be traced back at least to the late 1980s when 
under the leadership of Gordon Bell, at the time the NSF Assistant Director for 
CISE, there was a focus on bringing the more traditional strains of numerical com­
putations of science and engineering (called numerical analysis at the time and 
often focused professionally in the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics—
SIAM). I had been a part of the NSF effort as a Division Director in CISE at the time 
and attempted on several occasions a few years later as Dean of CoC to interest the 
faculty in starting such a program at Georgia Tech, but without success. As it hap­
pened, Rich DeMillo had followed me in that Division Director position at NSF and 
undoubtedly became aware of NSF’s programmatic efforts in the area; thus, he was 
later able to create CSE along those lines successfully as Dean.

The Ph.D. program in Human-Centered Computing humanizes computing and 
trains graduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersection of 
people and computing. This program originated in two longstanding intellectual 
traditions at Georgia Tech: (1) Scholarship in human-computer interaction (HCI) 
going as far back as Albert Badre’s research on human factors in computing in the 
1970s and later greatly expanded by GVU; (2) Interdisciplinary scholarship in cog­
nitive science also going as far back as the 1980s to Janet Kolodner’s research on 
human reasoning and her work on learning in the mid-1990s. In 2002, I appointed a 
committee co-chaired by Jim Foley and Nancy Nersessian (a senior professor I had 
hired to strengthen our efforts in Cognitive Science) to design a Ph.D. program in 
HCC. When they finished their work in 2004, Rich DeMillo was then dean and he 
appointed Elizabeth Mynatt the HCC Director; the HCC program officially launched 
in that year.
This first-of-its-kind HCC Ph.D. program resides in the School of Interactive 
Computing and currently consists of about 30 faculty and 40 Ph.D. students. The 
program has five core areas: HCI, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, learning 
science and technology, and social computing. Ph.D. students in the program con­
duct interdisciplinary research addressing a variety of societal challenges, for exam­
ple, in health, education, design, and justice. Since 2006, the program has graduated 
about eighty well-placed alumni. The HCC Ph.D. program is generally considered 
to be leading program of its kind in the country and the world.
7.4.5  Georgia Tech—Korea University M.S. Program 
in Embedded Software (GTKU)
A fourth major, purely unexpected, opportunity arose that led to the development of 
a very successful mode of distance delivery of graduate education. This provided a 
base of experience in the College that later smoothed the way for the successful 
launch of the OMSCS Program (see Chapter 8). It came about after a lengthy pro­
cess and the involvement of a number of people starting with DeMillo and including 
a number of campus officials in negotiating a complex agreement.
When in Taiwan in 2007 for an invited technical workshop, Kishore Ramachandran 
visited his former student, Joonwon Lee, then a professor at KAIST (Korean

Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Lee told him that, as a consultant 
to the Korean Government, he was putting together a request for proposals from 
American universities to provide the opportunity for students to obtain an American 
degree without leaving Korea. The program would be completely supported by the 
Samsung Corporation and the students would come from their technical employees. 
(This type of specific government/private partnership would never happen in the 
U.S., but it is common in Korea.) Lee hinted to Ramachandran that Georgia Tech 
should apply. They did and won over several other universities including CMU and 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, both of which were already deliver­
ing remote education abroad.
The program was unique for Georgia Tech in that it delivered a complete degree 
program remotely, not just a few regular courses or intensive short courses. The 
result was that students in the program received a GT M.S. degree, just as if they had 
been on campus in Atlanta. (The same had been true for students at the GT Lorraine 
campus in France since the early 1990s.) The program was designed so that half of 
the required courses would be delivered, either synchronously or asynchronously, 
remotely from Atlanta and the other half would be delivered in Korea by regular 
CoC faculty. Whether remote or in-person, courses in most cases were delivered to 
students on the GT campus at the same time as they were delivered to students 
in Korea.
Samsung, as sponsor of the program, insisted that there also be a deep research 
collaboration. To that end, the Samsung Georgia Tech Advanced Research Center 
(STAR) was created in the College. It was funded by Samsung who assigned some 
of their research staff to work there with GT professors. STAR provided research 
funding to faculty through a proposal process and Samsung was able to own the 
results that came out of the research. When faculty were in Korea for a term to 
deliver courses there, they had the opportunity to work with Samsung as consultants 
in the same manner that they might consult with a company in the U.S., for extra 
compensation. This was a very unusual arrangement for an American university and 
to arrange it took the involvement of a number of senior campus—an activity too 
involved to describe here.
The overall arrangement provided high-quality M.S. education to help a friendly 
nation, one of its major corporations, and some of its best technical people to achieve 
their goals. It gave participating faculty enhanced income opportunities and an 
opportunity for cultural emersion in another country. Finally, it also provided the 
College additional income that could be used anywhere it was needed, as well as 
developing valuable experience in remote learning to faculty. The program lasted 
until 2014 when the senior executive responsible for Samsung’s support left the 
company.

135
7.4.6  Continuing Education
While these efforts to expand and strengthen the College’s educational programs 
were underway, the long-standing Continuing Education (ConEd) offerings of the 
College continued to decline in popularity for a variety of reasons. Since that pro­
gram had to be at least self-sustaining, DeMillo eventually shut it down completely 
by transferring the full-time ConEd staff that were left to the central campus effort, 
with the exception of the College’s ConEd Director, Tom Pilsch; he was made 
Assistant Dean for Student Services to manage the growing staff of counselors.
In all of the above educational efforts, DeMillo’s industrial experience and skills 
were evident and valuable—a prime example being the GTKU Program where he 
was able to negotiate an arrangement that was very valuable to the College, with the 
active support and involvement of others as noted above. That is not to say that the 
faculty fully approved of all of these efforts and, indeed, there was quite a lot of 
angst expressed over the largely top-down process of bringing them about. 
Nonetheless, they were all eventually operating successfully and most continue 
today (aside from the GTKU program), more than fifteen years later.
7.5  Centers
Research centers located within one (or more) of the colleges have been key to 
emphasizing and encouraging high-quality research, in addition to the educational 
function that all of the Colleges conduct, by tenure-track faculty as the leaders and 
primary members of such efforts. GVU, founded in 1991 and reporting to the Dean 
of Computing, quickly became the premier example of such a center that from the 
start endeavored to span multiple disciplines in several colleges. It has been very 
successful in that, starting with CoC, but then quickly extending to multiple col­
leges under the leadership of Jim Foley and his successors. That success paralleled 
and contributed to the growth of the College and has set an example for the campus.
During WW II and since, the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), a contract 
research organization, has been the location of the largest amount of externally 
funded research at Tech. Even after that time, a small group of faculty within a 
school might sometimes organize into a center for the purpose of coordinating their 
individual efforts, but usually with little or no official approval or support. Some 
faculty were very active researchers and sometimes led major efforts at GTRI—an 
outstanding example was the work of several Mechanical Engineering professors 
who worked with GTRI to develop some of the most advanced undersea communi­
cation and detection technology.
GVU introduced a new paradigm, without replacing the previous one, where the 
management and direction of a group of tenure-track faculty researchers was located 
in a college or school. By 2002, that was a well-established model that served as a 
model for the entire campus.

Several of the centers discussed below were started much earlier and have been 
discussed above. This section attempts only to outline notable developments during 
the period of 2002–2010.

Its strong national technical leadership position through the research of its affiliated 
faculty in its founding fields (graphics, usability, and human-computer interaction) 
and the strength of the participation by its faculty in College and across campus 
strengthened during this time. Perhaps the most momentous organizational event 
was the move of the GVU labs and faculty offices to new facilities a half mile away 
from the bulk of the College’s other faculty and labs.
In 2003, Aaron Bobick, GVU Director at the time, made the difficult decision to 
move the Center from its original location in CCB to a new building in the newly 
built Technology Square campus across the freeway from the main campus—the 
Technology Square Research Building (TSRB). The building was part of the 
Yamacraw Project, an economic development effort of the State mentioned earlier. 
Richard LeBlanc, former Associate Dean of CoC and at that time on loan to the 
Yamacraw Project, played a significant role in making sure that TSRB was designed 
and built so that in future years it could serve as an office and lab building for regu­
lar academic use. The new Intelligent and Interactive Computing (IIC) Division that 
was also created that year under the leadership of Aaron Bobick included faculty 
members affiliated with GVU (with the largest number) as well as those from robot­
ics and AI that had been housed elsewhere. His difficult decision that co-located for 
the first time almost all the elements of the new Division (and later, School) enabled 
them to create a more cohesive and powerful identity.
Since at the time Bobick was also GVU Director as well as IIC Director it was 
unclear as a practical matter what the separation was, if any, between GVU and 
IIS. Bobick’s dual role and any confusion this brought about was soon resolved with 
the appointment of Professor Beth Mynatt to be head of GVU, allowing Bobick to 
focus on further strengthening all parts of IIC. GVU has continued its strong techni­
cal leadership and national reputation under Beth Mynatt and then up to the present 
(2022) under Keith Edwards since 2011.

7.6  Leadership Change
In 2007–2008, long-time differences in style and objectives between DeMillo and 
Provost Gary Schuster, coupled with growing faculty dissatisfaction with some of 
DeMillo’s actions and a resultant loss of faculty support for his leadership as dean, 
led the Provost to not extend DeMillo’s deanship for another five-year term. Schuster 
conducted a poll of the College faculty to determine their preference for an interim 
dean with the result that Schuster approached Jim Foley to ask if he would serve as 
Interim Dean beginning July 1, 2008 while a search for a new dean took place. 
DeMillo, however, had negotiated his return to the faculty to be the end of 2008 in 
order to complete some activities he had initiated. As a result, there was a six-month 
period during which there were two deans of CoC. Foley, however, had the budget­
ary and organizational authority, a fact that was apparently not made entirely clear 
to the faculty and staff, which caused a period of some ambiguity for a few months.

7.6  Leadership Change

7.7  Interim Dean Jim Foley (July 2008–September 2010)
Jim Foley had been a leading and very successful faculty member at Georgia Tech 
since 1991 when he was the first faculty hire I made (see Chapter 2), founding the 
highly successful GVU Center. After a stint in industry starting in 1996 and then as 
the first Executive Director of the Yamacraw Economic Development Project for the 
State of Georgia (see Chapter 6), he returned to regular faculty status in 2001. Since 
my Associate Dean, Rich LeBlanc, in the interim had also joined Yamacraw and 
continued there, I asked Foley to serve as Associate Dean, which he did until 
DeMillo was named as my replacement in late 2002.
Later in late spring 2008, when Foley agreed to be the Interim Dean it meant a 
disruption of his professorial activities, but he agreed to do so in the expectation that 
at most it would be for the coming academic year. His expressed intention was to 
continue devolving responsibilities to the schools started by DeMillo, but because 
there was a State budget crisis at that time he realized that continuing to keep some 
functions like admissions and finance centralized would save some much-needed 
funds—as a result, not much decentralization of administrative functions took place.
Foley also realized that the contentious period that had thrust him into the Interim 
Dean role was due, at least, in part to the lack of clarity about the prerogatives of the 
dean and of the faculty (as a group) on major issues affecting the future of the 
College, especially those of hiring and retention, promotion, and tenure (RPT). 
Specifically, the faculty had felt that their independence had been abridged in the 
RPT process. As a result, one of his first actions was to ask Janet Kolodner to lead a 
review. Her work led to the refinement of the College’s policies that clarified the 
roles, responsibilities, and limits of the dean and the faculty in RPT matters.
As the search for a new dean neared its conclusion in Spring 2009 and narrowed 
the number of candidates, the leading candidate had signaled his interest in accept­
ing the position if offered. Unfortunately, in the interim he encountered a personal 
emergency that caused him to drop out of contention just before an offer was made. 
By then all the other potential choices had also removed their names from conten­
tion. It is worth noting that this episode is an example of the small world of aca­
demic computing leadership at that time. The favored candidate later became the 
second successor to the position I held at NSF (AD/CISE) and he is now president 
of Carnegie Mellon University.
Foley then agreed when asked by the Provost to serve an additional year when a 
new search began in Spring 2009. Because of the recent sequence of events regard­
ing leadership of the College, Foley chose to maintain the College on the steady 
course of strategic expansion and improvement followed since 1990. This enabled 
considerable progress to be made under his initiative and leadership in his 2 years 
as Interim Dean.
The 2008 economic slowdown presented a potentially difficult financial time that 
Foley had to manage—state tax collections were down and as a result the allocation 
to GT was down, as was the College budget. The preceding year or two had seen 
some very good faculty hires, such as Henrik Christensen, but good faculty hires

come at the cost of generous start-up packages which needed to be covered. From 
where would the money come? Fortunately, CoC had the multi-year educational 
development and delivery contract with Korea University in Seoul, the GTKU pro­
gram described above in this Chapter, which generated a handsome surplus. Without 
those funds, CoC would have had to default on commitments made to recently hired 
faculty (startup funds were sometimes promised for a period of 2 or even 3 years 
after the new faculty started).
Two major grant awards were made to Georgia Tech on behalf of the College in 
September 2009. The first award, $2.5 million from NSF for Operation Reboot with 
the goal of transforming laid-off IT workers in Georgia into high-school computing 
teachers. It was awarded to Barbara Ericson, PI (research faculty) and Mark Guzdial, 
Co-PI under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, to assist unem­
ployed IT workers wanting to make a career switch into high school teaching, pair­
ing them with existing high school teachers who wanted to become more proficient 
in the computer science content area. The program eventually helped about thirty IT 
workers to successfully make the transition by pairing the experienced teachers with 
the IT workers and served as a model for similar programs at other universities. This 
was another example of the College’s impactful innovation and leadership in 
education.
The second award was the announcement that Georgia Tech would be the lead 
institution for a five-year, $12 million, Track 2 award from the National Science 
Foundation’s Office of Cyberinfrastructure to lead the Keeneland Project: a partner­
ship of academic, industry, and government experts in the development and deploy­
ment of an innovative and experimental high-performance computing (HPC) system 
using graphics processors for high-performance computing; Dr. Jeffrey Vetter, led 
the project. He had earned his Ph.D. in CoC under Karsten Schwan and was an 
Adjunct Professor in CoC as well as a senior staff member at Oak Ridge National Lab.
One notable activity that had been planned since the restructuring of the College 
into two schools and a division, was the approval of the Division of Computational 
Science and Engineering to be the College’s third school. Although Rich DeMillo 
had started the effort and laid the groundwork, it had not been achieved before he 
stepped down as dean. Foley recognized that to push the proposal through required 
active leadership and he made that his first priority, achieving the goal on January 
1, 2010.

7.7  Interim Dean Jim Foley (July 2008–September 2010)

An effort that had great promise was the creation of a bioinformatics effort in the 
College. Rich DeMillo had started discussions about forming a bioinformatics 
department, jointly with Emory University, modeled on the very successful Coulter 
Department of Biomedical Engineering that is a joint department of Georgia Tech 
and Emory. Foley saw this as an opportunity to continue the development of CoC—
and the discipline of computing—to encompass another computing-intense field 
requiring a high degree of interdisciplinary activity. This was based on his long-held 
view that in the future, computing will develop in ways similar to engineering, from 
an initial core to more and more areas where computing research can make impor­
tant contributions.
Discussions were held with senior people at Emory and they responded, “let’s do 
it.” Provost Gary Schuster and Associate Provost Andy Smith were positive, saying 
it is a “must do.” It was clear from the GT side, however, that significant investment 
in recruiting faculty for a new school would be needed, since there were very few 
faculty already at Tech who might join the new school. Further, the new Tech 
President, George P. “Bud” Peterson, was in place and after he learned more and 
talked with President James Wagner at Emory, he declined to proceed, to the disap­
pointment of Foley and those that had developed the proposal. Interestingly, the 
growing prominence of the campus’ efforts since 2018 in “data science,” much of 
which is centered on bioinformatics, may eventually provide the basis to revisit the 
efforts of 2006–2010. Those efforts today (2022) are led by CoC faculty members.
As Foley stepped down at the end of the 2009–2010 AY to return to his profes­
sorial activities, the College again showed a healthy increase of 13% in research 
expenditures over the previous year. Just prior to the end of the year, the search for 
a new dean culminated with the announcement of Zvi Galil as the next CoC Dean.
This interim period illustrates two major points in the growth of a relatively new 
academic unit. First, if a momentum of accomplishment and expansion has been 
well established previously, then a few years of interim leadership can be successful 
in maintaining and expanding the growth. Second, at least for a young organization 
that was still fairly thin in the senior ranks of experienced leaders, it is essential that 
the interim leader have the respect of the faculty and the ability to undertake the 
difficult role of an interim leader; Jim Foley successfully provided those ingredients.
7.8  Summary
The years of 2003–2008 were ones of continued growth and change in the College: 
Its structure was changed to having schools within it, rather than having a single 
large group, almost 35 new faculty, senior researchers, and educational profession­
als were hired, some of which replaced departures; five new degree programs were 
created in Computational Media, Robotics, Human-Centered Computing, and 
7  Strategic Expansion (2002–2010)

143
Computational Science and Engineering; two new centers were created, and the 
previously created new degree programs in Computational Media and Computer 
Security produced their first graduates; and the College of Computing Advisory 
Board was changed to include more industry representatives and less academic 
members. In short, what had essentially been a large academic department, even 
though it had the status, prerogatives, and responsibilities of a college, became a 
true college consisting of multiple schools within it.
Most of the actions taken by DeMillo were strategic, changed the basic structure 
of the College, and set it on a path that can still be seen today, while at the same time 
continuing it on the quest of creating a broad computing unit that characterizes all 
of the prior periods.
The years from 2008–2010 were led successfully by Interim Dean Foley. The 
process started by DeMillo came to a conclusion with the creation of the School of 
Computational Science and Engineering. Two major NSF awards were received, the 
Computing for Good Program was initiated, and faculty-led efforts defined more 
clearly the roles of the faculty and the dean in academic personnel matters. Most 
importantly, Foley’s leadership provided stability that has allowed the College’s 
strategic progress to continue.

Chapter 8
Growth by Innovating the Future 
(2010–2022)
A future historian of Georgia Tech and the College of Computing might well label 
the period from 1990 to 2010 as the Foundational Period of the College. By the time 
Zvi Galil took over the reins as the third Dean of Computing, its character, structure, 
and general directions had been established, but its potential for growth and yet 
more innovation was just starting. Zvi Galil took that next major step.
In 2010 after 20 years, it was still known as an academic unit with broad, even 
unique programs organized into the same three units established in 2003. Each had 
own focus but with many interactions among faculty within the College and across 
campus. The faculty were widely known locally and nationally for being innovators 
in research, education, and service to society.
The period from September 2010 to the present (2022) has been a period of deep­
ening and expanding growth of seeds planted earlier, explosive growth in the num­
ber of students driven by the innovation of new online modes of instruction, the 
ever-expanding adoption of computing throughout society, and the continued 
expansion of the College’s financial and physical resources. The educational inno­
vations that the College has pioneered in massive, degree-oriented programs are not 
unique in general form of delivery (online, asynchronous, course-focused). They 
have been used by CoC and elsewhere in a variety of forms and various delivery 
mechanisms for many years, but never at the scale of the Online Masters of Science 
in Computer Science (OMSCS) that Zvi Galil led. That effort has cemented and 
made known to the world that Georgia Tech’s College of Computing is a leader in 
innovating the future of higher education.
The only way you can predict the future is to build it.
—Alan Kay
For several reasons, not the least of which is that this narrative was already well-underway before 
2019, there are many fewer details than for previous eras. A future historian will have to docu­
ment those.

Most of the last academic years covered here, as Dean Charles Isbell took over, 
have coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic. Because this has caused the College 
(and most of the country) to switch rapidly to almost completely online instruction 
at all levels, the expertise developed during Zvi Galil’s time as dean (managed by 
then-Executive Associate Dean Charles Isbell) allowed the College to deal more 
easily than most schools with the setbacks and difficulties encountered elsewhere. 
Thus, the College has expanded its intellectual leadership on campus and more 
broadly in spite of the general difficulties and constraints that the Pandemic has 
imposed.

The major activity started and made known broadly by him in almost 100 talks 
in 16 countries (with more scheduled) was the Online Master’s in Computer Science 
(OMSCS); as such, it will be his major legacy among other accomplishments during 
his time as dean. It has also served to give a major boost to the reputation of the 
College as a leader in educational innovation and as a place to study computing at 
all levels. How OMSCS started, was initially developed, and is now operated will be 
described in more detail below.
These and other events between 2010 and 2019 are described below.
8.2  Organizational Strengthening
The most directly observable characteristics of the College during this period have 
been growth in the numbers of people (faculty, staff, students, and administrators), 
space, organizational details, and budget. There were no large-scale structural 
changes as there were under DeMillo.
As Galil took over leadership of the College from Foley in the summer of 2010, 
the current overall structure of the College of Computing was in place. Galil wisely 
did not change that structure, but he did build it out in depth. The fairly new schools 
were still rather thin in administrative support, at least partially because the educa­
tional activities needing the most support, were the undergraduate programs that 
were handled centrally.
Zvi Galil changed a trend started in the 2 years-service by Jim Foley as Interim 
Dean, morphing the top-level administrative structure of the College by reducing 
drastically the number of Assistant/Associate Deans, and focusing central staff on 
activities common to all of the Schools.
He also soon promoted Charles Isbell to be Executive Associate Dean and gave 
him effective responsibility for the programmatic operations of the College, retain­
ing as direct reports only the Finance and External Relations functions. This permit­
ted him to focus on one-one interactions, leaving the day-to-day operations to Isbell.
Galil interacted frequently with school chairs, faculty, and students internally, his 
peers and senior administrators on campus, as well as individuals and groups 
Zvi Galil had a long and distinguished career in academia before being hired 
as the third dean of computing in 2010. He earned his first degrees in his 
native country of Israel before coming to Cornell where he earned his Ph.D. in 
computer science. After a short post-doctoral fellowship at IBM Research, he 
returned to Israel. There he rose through the ranks of the faculty at Tel Aviv 
University, including serving as a department chairman. He then joined the 
faculty of Columbia University where he also served as department chair of 
CS and then dean of engineering. He continued his affiliation with Tel Aviv 
University and served as its President from 2007 to 2009. After stepping down 
as dean in 2019, he continues at Georgia Tech as a Professor.
8.2  Organizational Strengthening

external to campus. This latter activity increased markedly as OMSCS took off, as 
will be noted below. This had the effect of turning the College into a more tradi­
tional model of a large college in which the dean focuses on relationships and leaves 
many of the day-to-day details to his direct reports and their respective staffs. 
Initially, there were some questions about this conversion from essentially a large 
school, as it was when I was dean, into what may have appeared to be a top-heavy 
structure for its size in 2011.
In fact, this was a process that had roots in my final years when the senior faculty 
and I began to discuss how to develop more structure to support growth that we felt 
would come. That then became explicit under DeMillo and developed more fully 
under Galil. In the case of DeMillo, the administrative restructuring was in line with 
his previous industrial experiences and personal proclivities. Galil certainly was 
following his experiences in his previous positions. While it was true that in 
2011/2012 the College structure may have been a bit top-heavy, it turned out to be 
fortuitous as the number of students and needed support staff quickly and even 
exponentially expanded.
In the eyes of some faculty who were present in the College in its early years 
(and even before), this growth in size and, eventually, necessary structure was not 
altogether a good thing. It meant that for most faculty they had less involvement in 
the decisions about the direction of the College or even knowledge of what was 
going on in areas that did not directly touch their teaching, research, and service 
activities. For some, this was a good thing so that they could spend more time on 
what they perceived as the role of a faculty member. For others, who may have 
wanted more involvement in administrative matters, it usually meant having to 
make a more explicit choice between full-time faculty and administrative roles. As 
older faculty have retired, moved on, or made the switch to full-time administrative 
duties (while almost always maintaining some teaching and research) the nature of 
the faculty, of course, has changed.
A second overall activity important to the growth of the College during Gailil’s 
time was programmatic expansion in education and the expansion in entrepreneur­
ial and societal-issues oriented programs that will be described below. When the 
number of students began to grow as interest in computing took an upswing across 
the country, counseling staff were added as well as additional instructional faculty. 
The growth of OMSCS demanded the addition of even more support staff and sev­
eral senior administrative leaders in the educational arena, leading to additional 
structuring within the central administration of the College. All of this was a natural 
thing in the growth of an organization that was trying to respond to additional 
demand for its services.
The single activity that the period from 2010 to 2020 will be remembered for in 
connection with the College of Computing is the OMSCS Program—Zvi Galil’s 
legacy. This is the subject of the next section.

The development of a new, sustainable model for delivery of distance education via 
the Internet not only occurred during Galil’s time as dean, but he was personally 
involved in starting it, making sure it was developed with faculty involvement, prop­
erly implemented, and publicized. Indeed, he gave dozens of talks worldwide, par­
ticipated in numerous panels at meetings, and clearly became its chief spokesperson.

In 1998, I was approached by an entrepreneur from India with good credentials and 
connections with a proposal to offer the Georgia Tech B.S. in Computer Science 
remotely to students in India; his goal was to enroll at least 5000 students/per annual 
cohort. Rich LeBlanc, Kurt Eiselt, and I seriously explored his proposal for several 
months by carefully reviewing his credentials and meeting with him multiple times; at 
one meeting, he brought along one of his advisors, a former president of one of the 
distinguished Indian Institutes of Technology. We determined that his proposal made 
sense and that we could staff it at our end without too much difficulty. However, it was 
dependent on his being able to organize and properly staff several dozen learning 
centers in India where local instructors could answer questions, grade exams, and 
serve as teaching assistants for our faculty. In the end, I decided against proceeding 
because of doubts that he could successfully organize the in-country centers and

because of political considerations on campus if we began producing twice as many 
graduates per year as the rest of the campus combined, all in a foreign country!
Although massive online courses (MOOCs) had been taught as early as 2006, the 
term was first introduced in 2008 and did not really catch on until 2011 when 
Sebastian Thrun (already well-known for his development of one of the first self-­
driving vehicles) and Peter Norvig offered an AI course at Stanford that drew 
160,000 online registrants. Several other professors at Stanford and elsewhere 
quickly began to offer MOOCs and created companies to provide the technology 
platforms for such courses. Previously, there were a few low-cost and/or online 
degree programs, but nothing on the scale of a MOOC-based degree program from 
a major university; as of 2022 none have had the success of OMSCS (details below).
In 2013, Sebastian Thrun approached Dean Zvi Galil with a proposal to partner 
with Georgia Tech to offer an online Masters in Computer Science. The result was 
OMSCS, which rapidly became a leading example of what could be done with at 
least some courses in higher education. It grabbed the attention of the academic 
world and gained wide attention in society more broadly. Contrasted with the situa­
tion 15 years earlier, with the enhanced technical capabilities in 2013 and the exist­
ing proof of Thrun’s success, the idea this time went forward quickly.
8.3.1  Program Description
OMSCS is a traditional, courses-only, Masters program consisting of ten 3-credit 
courses taken from traditional faculty at Georgia Tech. A majority of the lectures are 
given by tenure-track faculty of the College of Computing in carefully organized 
and produced and packaged lectures, that are produced in a studio. A wide range of 
courses, now close to 50, are given providing the opportunity to specialize. Courses 
follow the on-campus academic schedule but the lectures are pre-recorded and need 
not be viewed at a specific time. Advising support is provided by a full-time profes­
sional staff of 8 or more advisors and staff assistants that are focused on OMSCS 
and related graduate programs.
Minimum application criteria are the same as for on-campus graduate programs, 
and include a 4-year degree from an accredited institution in computer science or 
closely related and relevant field (e.g., math or engineering) with an overall GPA of 
B or better. Credit is not given for work experience. Limited exceptions are made for 
degrees in other fields. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee 
admission. Women, under-represented minorities (as defined in the U.S.) and inter­
national students are especially encouraged to apply. Proof of English language 
proficiency is required for students that are not U.S. citizens, permanent residents, 
or green-card holders.
Once admitted a student must complete at least two courses in the program with 
a B or better within the first 12 months in order to continue in the program. Normal 
completion time for the program is 3 years but may be spread over 6 years; with 
special dispensation for unusual circumstances the time frame may be extended 
beyond 6 years.
8  Growth by Innovating the Future (2010–2022)

151
Students are enrolled as regular students by Georgia Tech in the MSCS/course 
option—the regular Masters curriculum (project and thesis options are also avail­
able to OMSCS as well as to on-campus students, but as of Fall 2022, only about 20 
chose either of those alternatives). Tuition and fees charged total $6600 on average 
for a full 10-course (30 academic credits) compared to $24,000 for on-campus stu­
dents ($47,000 for out-of-state); it must be completed entirely on-line. As of 2022 
the average time to completion was ~3.5 years for the 8700 graduates.
Current and official information on program specifics can be found online and in 
a variety of general and scholarly publications cited in the footnotes above.
8.3.2  Program Development
The partnership of Udacity (Thrun’s company) and Georgia Tech’s College of 
Computing obtained initial and significant financial support ($4 million in total) 
from AT&T (a long-time supporter of universities, including Georgia Tech) to 
jump-start the program by funding the conversion of basic courses to an online for­
mat (this support was later extended for the startup operational period). Udacity 
provided the computing platform and technical support. Georgia Tech provided the 
instructors, course material, and overall curriculum content and control. (The 
arrangement with Udacity ended in 2020 and their services for OMSCS are now 
provided by campus service providers.) At first, it cost an average of about $300,000 
per course to reproduce a course formerly given in the classroom and prepare it for 
online offering—much more than the additional compensation needed to pay for a 
faculty member to create a new course because of the rigor of the careful planning 
and reviewing needed for online viewing.
However, as the staff and faculty became more experienced at building online 
courses, the cost dropped rapidly. At the end of the Udacity relationship in 2020, 
course production cost was billed at $175,000 (which included Udacity’s profit), and 
now the program director usually estimates it at closer to $100,000 through Georgia 
Tech Professional Education. While still a significant amount of upfront money com­
pared to what a department might normally dedicate to creating a course, it is a very 
small amount if the expected number of tuition-paying students is very large.

Initially, a small number of teaching assistants were provided by Udacity but the 
model quickly shifted to hiring TAs from the on-campus student body, and soon 
thereafter to include online students and online alumni; by 2022 43% of TAs were 
OMSCS alumni and 34% were current OMSCS students. As the program began to 
be widely accepted by top students nationally (more than half) and from around the 
world, the revenue generated permitted the College to add additional full-time aca­
demic advisors to their existing on-campus advising staff that are devoted to 
OMSCS (currently 8) as well as instructional assistants to help with the preparation 
and delivery of courses.

8.3.4  Results to Date
As of 2022, 8700 students have graduated from OMSCS with a degree that has the 
same content as on-campus study and over 11,000 students are currently enrolled; 
over 5000 new students were enrolled in AY22 alone––all meeting or exceeding the 
basic requirements. A few demographics of the OMSCS total student population

•	 12% under-represented minorities (as U.S. defined, relative to the total 
population)
•	 63% U.S. citizen or permanent resident
•	 ~33% natural-born U.S. citizen, ~33% non-U.S.-born U.S. resident, ~33% 
non-U.S.-resident.

One of the side effects of OMSCS was the development of an online teaching 
assistant by Professor Ashok Goel in the College and one of his former students now 
at IBM that is completely automated. It was used in its first full year by over a thou­
sand students with a high-degree of satisfaction and almost none of them realizing 
that they weren’t communicating with a human teaching assistant.

8.4  Entrepreneurial Education
Beginning in the mid-1990s there was a ground-swell of entrepreneurial activity 
nationally in a wide variety of areas, some of which had not been previously seri­
ously considered as potential for a business or service; a number of them were not 
viable, at least in the short term, causing a number of the people involved to seek to 
information about how to succeed in starting a new business, especially in

computing. Fueled by an awakening of the power of new economic development in 
advancing social goals and empowered in large part by the emergence of the Internet 
and the tools for online activity that it provided, Georgia Tech, led by the College of 
Computing, provided strong leadership in this new realm.
Georgia Tech, being dominated by engineering almost since its founding, has 
been more oriented toward accepting as one form of “service” by faculty to be con­
tributing to or supporting economic activity, especially that of Georgia and Atlanta. 
That is not surprising since going back to its founding in the late 1800s, business 
was the primary reason the area’s leaders agreed to and supported its creation; to 
this day, the leadership of GT remains sensitive to the needs of Georgia because of 
the large financial support provided by its taxpayers. In spite of many Tech gradu­
ates going on to work for industry across the country, until recently the number of 
new companies created by Tech graduates was relatively small compared to today’s 
activities when many students are creating startups even before graduation.
As computers have become almost essential in so many activities this situation 
has started to change. The fact that the creation of a new company based on comput­
ing technology usually requires relatively little capital to launch (even though such 
companies may eventually employ hundreds or even thousands of people) coupled 
with Tech’s natural orientation to business, has created a natural environment for 
entrepreneurial activity aimed at developing new enterprises. The result, since the 
mid-1990s has been a significant increase in entrepreneurial activity across GT, not 
just in CoC.
If anything, the College may have lagged some of the engineering areas that had 
ready ideas for commercialization (e.g., automated engineering and architectural 
design tools or platforms). Creation of the College, and especially our insistence 
from the start that we had to be entrepreneurial not only in our research and teaching 
but in the manner we went about our activities as an organization opened up a new 
Georgia Tech organizational home for innovation in computing, just as computing 
across our society was exploding at the same time. Overall, these factors created an 
environment in which the College has become a major role model for entrepreneur­
ial education and activity at Tech.
As dean, I often told the faculty that individually and as an organization, we had 
to act like a Silicon Valley startup if we hoped to produce students and research 
results that were relevant (not necessarily immediately applicable). That was an 
attitude I had developed watching closely and participating in the development of 
software-based companies since the 1970s. I believe that attitude helped to empha­
size that we had a central role to play in creating the new digital world that started 
to explode around us in the mid-1990s.
Entrepreneurial activity was not entirely absent in the College prior to the 
mid-­1990s or earlier. A few faculty (e.g., Richard Fujimoto, Sham Navathe, Ashwin 
Ram, and likely others of which I’m unaware) had started companies or substan­
tially aided in startups, as had a few students, and others. In the late 1990s, as entre­
preneurial activity nationally (and at a number of campuses) increased, it was often 
students that initially took the lead in creating startups. Even today, because of the 
greater numbers of students than faculty, coupled with the ease and popularity of

doing small startups, there are probably many more student entrepreneurs than there 
are faculty entrepreneurs overall.

As a cap on this narrative of Zvi Galil’s time as dean, permit me a few reflections.
8.5  Growth by Innovation
An academic group, whether it be a set of faculty, a department, or a school/college, 
is often judged in an overall sense by some combination of size, reputation, and 
value of its efforts over time to society broadly. Most groups aspire to grow in one 
or more of these dimensions. Organizationally, mere size in number of people or 
resources is easy to assess, but not always a primary goal for members of the group 
although it may well be for the executives of the institution in which the group 
works. Reputation is in the eye of the beholder ultimately; for academics, it is often 
their reputation with their peers that is most important. The value of a group over 
time more broadly may take decades to assess properly as the intrinsic importance 
of their research and the students they educate to society as a whole plays out; in a 
shorter time-span, however, growth in public reputation of an academic group may 
be beneficial in enhancing the institution’s success in obtaining the resources to 
continue on a positive trajectory that is showing indications of being of value to 
society. In the longer term, however, the value of a particular set of researchers or 
even an entire institution may be in its value in producing results and educating 
students who go on to produce value (e.g., the former Bell Laboratories and several 
of the long-time premier universities such as Harvard, Yale, and a number of others).

All of these measures continued on a positive increase year over year at a rate 
generally at or above their long-term rate of improvement since the founding of the 
College. The one measure that saw an exponential increase under Zvi Galil was, of 
course, the total number of matriculated students (both majors and student hours 
delivered) due to the very large number of qualified students enrolling in OMSCS, 
on top of an already rapidly increasing number of students interested in the College’s 
offerings in traditional courses.
Shortly after Galil’s announcement, a search committee, aided by a professional 
search firm, began work to obtain, qualify, interview, and winnowing a broad selec­
tion of candidates to become the next dean.

The announcement, while not unexpected, was eagerly awaited as it became 
known that there were several outstanding candidates and, thus, in no way a fore­
gone conclusion.
Isbell had barely begun serving and making some administrative changes when 
the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic occurred. The pandemic has waxed and waned while 
changing in severity (perhaps due to more vaccinations and treatments), degree of 
spread, and perhaps changing into more of a recurring outbreak such as influenza. 
As a result much of his time as dean has been largely consumed with managing the 
sudden change to completely online operation. However, his direct involvement in 
OMSCS from the start, coupled with his thorough knowledge of Georgia Tech, and 
above all his fundamental skills and personality have allowed him to lead the

his graduate student and post-doc days. He was then one of my last hires in 2002. In spring 2023

The other major issue that Isbell has had to deal with since becoming dean has 
been the explosive growth in the number of OMSCS students and the subsequent 
need for a great expansion in counseling and support staff needed to run the pro­
gram. This, too, he has managed successfully. As of the fall of 2022 as I do a final 
editing of the book, the expectation is that the College of Computing will enroll the 
largest number of tuition-paying students in regular degree programs of any college

It is too early to assess whether or not the College can maintain, or transform 
in productive ways, its reputation as an innovative leader in education (e.g., 
Threads, OMSCS and related programs, SCP), research (e.g., graphics, visualiza­
tion, HCI, AI, systems, robotics, cybersecurity), and service (e.g., Flashpoint, 
CDI, Create-X and related programs). That assessment task will have to be left to 
future observers and analysts, but the results so far are suggestive that it will 
continue to be positive.

By the start of the Galil Era the College was large enough and involved in so many 
things across campus—high-performance computing, data science, and especially 
innovative education initiatives in entrepreneurship and online education—that I 
could only touch on a few notable developments in this time period. I did provide 
more information on the widely–publicized and by most measures highly successful 
OMSCS. Charles Isbell, as Executive Senior Associate Dean under Galil, had been 
heavily involved in all activities for more than a decade prior to becoming dean and 
was able to make a well–informed, running start. Because this book project was

Epilogue

1
If your interest is primarily as someone with a connection to or interest in the 
College, I have provided an historical narrative, not a complete record, that briefly 
describes its origins, major milestones, and how a series of visions built on one 
another to actualize the best of those visions. If your interest is in finding a possible 
model for driving organizational development in a rapidly changing environment, 
you can read the narrative from that viewpoint without becoming bogged down in 
too many details specific to this particular organization.

1 It was relatively easy to determine the date of the first modern computer on campus (1947), but 
one could argue that such a computer and even very early digital computers may have been used 
by Georgia Tech faculty and/or students earlier. Likewise, one could argue that 1947 is too early 
and it should be around 1954 when the first digital computer was installed. Similarly, the cutoff 
date for the narrative (2020) is not a bright line, by any means. For reasons explained in earlier 
chapters, the narrative starts to thin out after about 2010 and actually mentions a few events as late 
as 2023!

What I will do in this final chapter is to emphasize and illustrate (again) what I 
judge to be the major reasons that have powered this growth in prominence and size. 
I believe these are lessons that can be applied to any academic organization (and 
very likely some outside the academy) subject to local objectives, conditions, and 
inherent constraints. Finally, I believe most of the senior faculty and other organiza­
tional leaders directly involved in this history over the 75-year history covered 
would and do agree with me. To bolster this set of personal opinions, I would note 
that with the exception of Dorothy Crosland, the first leader mentioned, I have 
known all the others and worked or at least talked at length with them and thus know 
of their general approval of the directions things have taken.
9.1  Vision
I will dispense with recounting the various arguments for and against vision, to say 
nothing of the shades and dimensions of visions held by different people. Put simply, 
having a vision of what the unit could become in the future allowed the organizational 
leaders (Directors, School Chairs, Deans, faculty) over 75 years to build what exists 
today in an almost steady path upwards in size, value, and reputation.
­
3
In some cases, the vision of the leaders needed to change in response to exoge­
nous factors. This was certainly true of Vladimir Slamecka, the young information 
science researcher chosen by Crosland to be the first Director of the School of 
Information Science. His vision was to build a world-class academic department 
devoted to information science. When the rapid ascent of computer science over­
took information science as the dominant discipline in the practical aspects of 
information handling, he wisely chose to add faculty with strength relevant to that 
emerging discipline. Those faculty include Albert Badre, Rich DeMillo, Phil 
Enslow, Pete Jensen, and others who later became leaders at other institutions.
3 In this chapter, I will refer to names, periods, and events without explanation if they have been 
covered in previous chapters. If you are reading this without having read the previous chapters, you 
should still be able to understand the points I am trying to convey.
9  Epilogue

165
Sometimes the vision held at a specific time was used explicitly by the organiza­
tional leaders to guide and motivate others, especially faculty, in finding a way to 
reconcile their personal agendas with the encompassing agenda for the group to 
achieve some coherence. Ray Miller, who followed Slamecka as the Director of the 
renamed School of Information and Computer Science, envisioned an even stronger 
traditional computer science group (his personal specialty) but was flexible enough 
to recognize where the computing field and some of the faculty were headed and to 
add strength in emerging fields.
Badre’s seminal work on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) coupled with 
Jensen’s quiet insistence (vision) on the importance of studying and teaching about 
the relationship between humans and machines (usability), helped lay the part of the 
foundation that enabled Jim Foley to found GVU in 1991, the first major interdisci­
plinary center in the College and one of the first on campus. GVU, where usability 
(the “U”) became a founding and continuing principle later grew to become the 
largest and most productive interdisciplinary center on campus. Enslow’s vision of 
the future of telecommunications and his deep experience in its practical aspects 
later morphed into computer networking. DeMillo, originally focused on theoretical 
issues became a leader in software engineering and contributed to security and net­
working. LeBlanc’s strong background in basic computer science, especially soft­
ware, from one of the most respected CS departments at that time later was 
instrumental in the formation and leadership of the College. Kolodner’s expertise in 
AI as well as CS, provided a strong foothold in that area.
President Crecine in his inaugural speech in 1988 proposed a college-level group 
devoted to a broad vision of computing, but left the details largely unspecified. 
Jensen and LeBlanc in the period 1988–1990 expanded on Crecine’s vision as 
described in Chapter 4 to convince campus-wide committees of the wisdom of hav­
ing an independent college devoted to computing.
This succession of visions of something new based on what has come before 
characterizes what all leaders that are trying to build something new attempt, in one 
way or another. My vision was to build a group of computing academics that were 
driven not only to expand our knowledge of computing fundamentals, but to col­
laborate with experts in other areas to expand knowledge in their fields. It drove the 
actualizations that I and my colleagues devised and carried out over time. My vision 
was not entirely original—one could say it was just an actualization of Pat Crecine’s 
vision of a great computing group that could lead others, but it was more detailed 
and was coupled with actions to bring it into being.
What we did illustrates an important point that I want to leave you with. Success 
is rarely the product of having a completely original idea and then implementing it. 
However, if you can imagine the actions necessary to actualize someone else’s 
encompassing, but vague vision, then you may be successful. You will encounter 
exogenous social, environmental, and economic factors, as were we, but if you pre­
serve in your quest and use your vision as a guide, you can still reach your goal.
I will leave it to others to comment on my and my successors’ use of vision as 
dean, other than to note the obvious—all of us (myself, DeMillo, Galil, and Isbell as 
deans and Zegura and Foley as interim deans) have continued to adjust our personal 
9.1  Vision

166
visions over time in response to conditions and opportunities as evidenced by our 
actions and decisions.
The remainder of this chapter will reiterate our journey.
9.2  Choice of Principles
Every civilized person has some principles by which they live their personal and 
professional lives. Sometimes they are held in the mind of an individual and used 
frequently, usually automatically as in the case of always trying to be truthful. 
Sometimes they are held very consciously and explicitly referred to, for example, 
when trying to decide whether or not to be consistent in a particularly difficult 
situation.
I accepted the offer to be the Founding Dean of the College of Computing, not to 
just be a manager of funds and people but to build something new, that with hard 
work, some luck, and the basic cooperation of everyone involved, might grow to 
join the ranks of the very best academic units in our field. That was my vision and I 
was fortunate (lucky?) to have a group of faculty and staff to start with that were 
willing to join me in my quest to actualize it and align their personal visions with 
mine, when and if necessary and appropriate.
Chapter 5 discusses the five principles—breadth of computing, importance of 
community, importance of every individual, quality in everything, key role of infra­
structure—that we as a group developed as our core principles. Here, I want to dis­
cuss two things further: The importance of choosing the right principles and a few 
comments on applying the principles.
I thought of the group of faculty, staff, and in a broader sense the students at all 
levels that comprised the College as one might think about an individual: Does the 
person share my principles? If not completely, can we find a meaningful subset of 
principles that we can share? What principles, such as religious beliefs or nationali­
ties are irrelevant to our forming a productive professional relationship? Are we 
each willing to commit to agreed–upon, shared principles to the best of our abilities 
and to apply them wherever appropriate in our common activities?
As described in Chapter 4, the fairly small group of faculty (~35) and senior staff 
(2 or 3) were able at the start of the College to agree on the five principles mentioned 
above. Most were either already held by the individuals (e.g., importance of every 
individual) or were obvious when properly described (e.g., quality in everything). 
Everyone fairly readily agreed to abide by them in their professional activities. A 
key tactic that I and the senior faculty leaders employed was, first, to emphasize that 
the intent was to make group activities commensurate with their individual activities 
and, second, to not insist on specific fealty to the group principles, but to instead 
make clear that everyone, including ourselves, would be evaluated in meaningful 
ways along those dimensions of activity as well as by other appropriate measures. 
By “meaningful” it was understood in our environment that meant advancement, 
resources, and salary determinations.
9  Epilogue

167
Breadth of computing could just as well be stated as being a “Big Tent of 
Computing” or “A mix of core and applied sub-disciplines” or any of a number of 
other concise descriptions of the elements of the envisioned group we hoped to 
build by pursuing our individual and common work agendas. The extension to other 
academic disciplines and even organizational sub-units in industry and business is 
clear where there are broader objectives to which the sub-units are expected to con­
tribute while pursuing more specific objectives individually and as a group. I 
observed this, for example, in visits to Intel’s research facilities in the early 1990s 
and met with groups in a variety of departments ranging from core processor design 
to marketing. If I started by saying “I guess you focus on X” they would invariably 
correct me as a group by saying “No! Our group’s purpose  is to create faster, 
smaller, and cheaper chips, with a focus on X!”
Community meant that we shared more with our colleagues in the College, in 
general, than we shared with individuals in other colleges. This, along with the 
emphasis on quality, were perhaps the two most important principles we all tried 
to follow.
One or two of the original faculty chose to move their positions to a different 
Georgia Tech college (which was permitted at that time) or leave the university. A 
few others, when they had advanced far enough in their careers, understood that 
they might not measure up well in evaluation of their performance (such as quality 
of teaching) chose of their own volition to move to an administrative position or 
leave the university; a very few had to be encouraged to leave. Consideration was 
made for a few tenured faculty and staff beyond their most productive years either 
to retire or to find other ways to be productive and contribute to the group.
Over the time I was dean we hired over 50 tenure-track faculty; of that number a 
few very good and desirable faculty that on some dimensions we considered hiring 
either decided that our sense of community was not to their liking and refused our 
offers, or in a very few cases we declined to make an offer when we felt that they 
would not fit into our community despite having outstanding academic credentials. 
While that kind of a process could have been self-defeating, we found on the con­
trary that as our sense of community strengthened it became easier to get outstand­
ing people to join us.
The same held true on campus, with several faculty choosing to move their posi­
tions to the College (with mutual agreement of their former college or school and 
CoC) or to accept partial appointments with us. This extended, to our great fortune, 
to staff in a variety of positions across campus; a number made it known to their 
professional peers in the College or even to one of our faculty or to me that they 
would like to have a job with us.
It is important to note that this insistence on the importance of community was 
counter-cultural to the usual academic community in which the individual is para­
mount and operates that way. Over 12 years I, and I believe most of my colleagues, 
found that this did not distract from their individual accomplishments but instead 
provided additional motivation, support, and self-respect for everyone’s individ­
ual work.
9.2  Choice of Principles

168
Importance of every individual is a platitude that everyone ostensibly ascribes 
to in a civilized community but is too often not made completely operational. I had 
a firm, open-door policy that everyone from advanced Ph.D. students to the lowest-­
paid staff member to faculty or deans in other parts of the university knew about and 
utilized. I tried to ensure that everyone treated each other responsibly and consider­
ately as human beings, no matter their respective positions or ranks. With an occa­
sional prompting, that took hold and became a hallmark of our community. As a 
principle, this soon took hold and was perpetuated as a normal mode of behavior.
Quality in Everything is all too often only defined in terms of an end product 
and, of course, “quality” may be in the eye of the provider, but not others. I had 
learned, probably the hard way, that that does not reliably lead to outstanding results 
when measured against outsiders or even all members of our group. I tried every day 
to lead by examples, small (e.g., picking up trash in the hallways if I saw it) and 
large (e.g., insisting on more than self-referential definitions of quality), but some­
times I had to resort to exhortation. I was not perfect, nor is this the only answer, but 
at a bare minimum it demonstrably helped lead us to success.
In academia, and many other situations, great care is taken to hire the best avail­
able (i.e., quality) faculty members and compensate them the best one can; but the 
same care may not be taken with hiring and paying support professionals and other 
staff, from janitorial on up. You have undoubtedly observed the result. Another 
obvious shortfall in defining quality is to do it yourself, without asking others who 
may have other viewpoints, such as students, parents, future employers and in 
nonacademic settings, customers (a label which academics do not like to apply to 
students). The extension of looking outside the group for the definition of quality 
(i.e., how good a job you are doing) is to benchmark against peer institutions (or, 
even units within your own organization) and against organizations that you would 
like to be your peers.
All of this is good management 101, of course, but one of the failings of aca­
demic organizations (and many others) is that leaders and managers (don’t forget 
they are different) are too often chosen without paying much attention to evidence 
of a candidate’s abilities and record. It does not take an MBA to do this. I never had 
a management course nor did many of the really good professional staff I hired. 
Another thing to realize and keep in mind is that good leadership and management 
qualities need to be sought among members of the group at all levels. Many faculty 
members, certainly in a research university (or any organization composed of highly 
trained and competent individuals), rather quickly become managers and leaders of 
(sometimes) sizeable numbers of graduate students and staff. Even for those that 
only teach and/or perform scholarship by themselves, management of their time, 
resources, tasks, and relationships with students, parents and other members of the 
group (at all levels) is essential.
Key role of infrastructure, such as equipment, space, and support staff is not 
only obvious, but essential for those in scientific and technical fields; even mathe­
maticians, who often work alone, need access to funds and the means to communi­
cate with and visit with other mathematicians. The prime example of essential 
infrastructure in all fields today is access to good, high-bandwidth Internet service

and the equipment to use it, coupled with sufficient support staff for maintenance 
and assistance. Traditional libraries are still needed by many. Support staff properly 
deployed at all levels permit those whose jobs require particular skills to devote 
their time to the use of those skills for the benefit of the organization. The obvious 
counterexamples are situations in which those that teach must spend significant 
time performing clerical duties (e.g., copying) or technical staff must spend their 
time ordering parts and negotiating prices.
I can hear now the wails of many in academia (as well as other organizations) 
complaining that this all takes too much money that is never provided. That is often 
true, but while we always have a responsibility to make sure that there is not waste 
(and fraud), we also at the same time must make clear to others that good results 
may not be cheap. As the sign that one of my best graduate students hung over 
his desk said, “If you think education is too costly, consider the alternatives.”
9.3  Choice of Activity Themes
There were five themes of activity that as a group we had chosen and to which 
everyone was expected to contribute in some way and to some extent: Development 
of collective human resources, research and educational infrastructure develop­
ment, aggressive outreach, educational reform and innovation, and research depth 
and breadth. They were fairly obvious outcomes of the basic principles we had 
chosen to share and the context in which we found ourselves—a growing (in size 
and desired reputation) research university with the expected traditional activities of 
teaching, research, and service. Chapter 5 explicates our reasoning more fully.
Choosing effective themes for our type of organization, with the general goals 
we had been given by the President and the defining documents of the College, was 
not a difficult process. It required some careful thought, however, to make sure that 
we undertook those themes in a measured way that took into account our resources 
of time and potentially available money. The strategic planning process we followed 
guided us in doing and is described in Chapter 5; it is illustrated in the Appendix 
with a largely complete replica of the strategic plan we developed for 
AY2000—AY2005.
Nonetheless, the choice of themes is critical. Trying to do too much as a group 
takes away from the time that faculty have for their own research and educational 
agendas, to say nothing of their personal lives. Not attempting some fairly aggres­
sive objectives would have meant not achieving the overall success we were aiming 
for and that was eventually achieved—but balance was key to our success.
Another aspect already mentioned was making sure that the goals, principles, 
and activities of each individual faculty were commensurate, as well as balanced, 
with those of the group. This is a characteristic fairly unique to an academic group 
in a research university where the faculty are expected as individuals to choose and 
pursue their own agendas.
9.3  Choice of Activity Themes

170
Research is expected to be ground-breaking but demonstrably within a broad 
definition of computing in our case. Change of research subfields in which to be 
active is usually a slowly evolving process defined by the collective, perhaps unco­
ordinated, activities of individuals. In a growth environment, the leaders of the unit 
and/or the encompassing organization can affect that choice by approving (or not) 
the hiring of additional faculty in specific areas. Educational (curricular) choices are 
more the province of educators (faculty) than administrators, usually governed by 
campus-wide faculty curriculum committees and always ultimately constrained by 
the availability of resources.
In a public university in which most of the non-research funding comes from 
outside, almost always with attached expectations, there are also  usually broad 
expectations already in place (e.g., a medical school comes with the expectation that 
it will largely produce medical professionals, not engineers or basic scientists).
This balance of expectations, objectives, and degree of control over activities of 
sub-groups and individuals can be very complex in a university and is what makes 
it very different from an industrial or commercial or even other nonprofit organiza­
tions (e.g., governments). This key organizational factor is very often misunder­
stood by those outside the university—resulting, for example, the often–heard 
complaint that the university should be run just like any other business!
9.4  Implementation Issues
Most of the things that I believe have led to the success of computing at Georgia 
Tech have been mentioned here. We implemented these ideas and concepts care­
fully, but not without making some mistakes and having to change course or even 
back-track. Even-handedness, flexibility, willingness to accept new things and leave 
behind some old ones, and, yes, some good fortune helped us.
Do we have a unique secret of success? Hardly. On the other hand, the number 
of academic units of any size that have grown in size and stature organically in a 
fairly short amount of time is quite small, that is without simply “buying” an entire 
group en masse from another university.
I have written this book for the reasons set out in the Prologue. I am confident 
that the narrative of events is well-documented and reasonably complete. The judg­
ments and explanations of why certain things were done that I have incorporated in 
the narrative are my own, but have been informed by the interviews, private conver­
sations, and other sources available to me.
I am hopeful that this will fulfill the other reason—serving as an example for 
others considering or already embarked on a journey of improving their organiza­
tion. You, the reader, will have to opine on that matter. Good luck in your endeavors!

Appendix: Partial Example of an Academic 
Strategic Plan
NOTE: The following is a verbatim copy of the Strategic Plan we developed in late 
1999. The vision portion of it is quite close to our very first Strategic Plan in 1991. 
Unfortunately, a complete copy of that plan could not be located.
A few lengthy lists have been truncated and marked below. As outlined in 
Chapter 6, when a new 5-year Strategic Plan was developed, a draft was reviewed 
by various interested parties and their feedback was incorporated as appropriate. 
Then each year we would see if conditions a year later required any modifications 
to the Plan—normally only a few, if any changes were needed.
Accompanying the Strategic Plan was a Tactical Plan that followed the structure 
of the Strategic Plan and laid out for each Goal in the different categories, a set of 
specific actions that we believed would be needed to achieve the Goal; those actions 
often were planned to cover several academic years.
Early in each calendar year, we were required to submit a detailed budget request 
for the next academic year that started on July 1. We justified those requests by 
developing an Operating Plan for the coming year. It was at this point that the 
actualization of the details of our Strategic Plan took place.
While this process appears cumbersome and involves lots of planning overhead, 
in fact it did not and was very beneficial for several primary reasons: (1) The various 
Plans made explicit what we were doing, thus facilitating actions by providing con­
text; (2) the very incremental changes to the Strategic and Tactical Plans year over 
year; (3) the ability it gave us to manage resources rationally at a detailed level; and 
(4) the multiple points of interaction with faculty/staff and other stakeholders. 
Several of us, now with 30+ years of hindsight, attribute our success overall to 
vision and this very rational approach to actualizing the vision we had.

College of Computing Strategic Plan AY00-04
October 1999
The Context in Which We Work
As an integral part of Georgia Tech, our basic missions of research, education, and 
service are predetermined. The larger goals of the campus, especially in the area of 
economic development, help shape us. The resources made available by the campus 
in any particular time frame enable, or constrain, much of what we can do. Yet, we 
also help shape these campus-wide goals.
Beyond this obvious context, however, we are full players in the information 
technology revolution that is sweeping our society. Our research is helping advance 
this revolution. Our students are going into a wide variety of organizations and, in 
turn, helping create and apply a wide range of information technology. Our interac­
tions with industry are helping create new industries. In this part of our context, we 
are limited only by our vision, resourcefulness, and energy.
The College was founded to focus on computing—the integration of computer 
science and other disciplines to address problems of wide interest. Our interest in 
end results leads immediately to our concentration on the human element of com­
puting in much of our research and to our aggressive interdisciplinary orientation. 
This focus is even more relevant today than it was ten years ago, as validated by the 
explosion of computing in all aspects of life.
Information technology is at an inflection point where the activity of computing 
is rapidly moving:
From
primarily explicit interactions with largely discrete, disconnected comput­
ing boxes
To
primarily implicit interactions with a wide variety of highly interconnected, 
integrated, computational resources distributed throughout the environments 
in which we live, learn, work, and play.
The new world that is rapidly unfolding can be characterized as a set of overlap­
ping and interacting environments that are rich in information, computational 
power, and means of interacting with people. Harking back to the original meaning 
of the term “cybernetics,” we believe these environments should be called human-­
centered cyberenvironments to capture their integration of information, computa­
tion, and human activity.
Our research has already explicitly helped to pioneer cyberenvironments for edu­
cation, psychological therapy, scientific visualization, high-performance engineer­
ing computations, and online communities. All of our work, even the most 
theoretical, will contribute to the creation of these future cyberenvironments by us 
and by others.
Appendix: Partial Example of an Academic Strategic Plan

173
The rapid changes in our underlying technology and the concomitant changes in 
our society and economy provide an outstanding opportunity for us. Our unique 
blend of basic research and advanced interdisciplinary work, coupled with innova­
tive, high-quality education, is the future and will enable us to lead our research 
disciplines, Georgia Tech, Georgia, and the nation.
Our Vision
The College of Computing will be the leader in computing research and education. 
Our work, while richly diverse, will focus on human-centered cyberenvironments. 
We will:
•	 Educate outstanding students knowledgeable about computing and able to learn 
and lead throughout their careers,
•	 Create innovative research products that have a significant impact, and
•	 Engage in service that enriches our state, nation, and profession.
We will be a high-quality, internationally recognized community of scholars with 
a strong intellectual core of computer science that is recognized as among the 
best in the world.
The uniqueness of our focus on computing, as opposed to just computer science, 
and our integration of many elements into human-centered cyberenvironments set 
us apart from our peers.
Enduring Strategies
Since the College of Computing was founded in 1990, we have followed a set of 
strategies that have brought us to the forefront of American academic computer sci­
ence and to a place of prominence at Georgia Tech. These strategies are charac­
terized by:
•	 Striving for the highest quality in all aspects of our work at all times,
•	 Constantly seeking basic advances in computer science and related disciplines,
•	 Collaborating with our colleagues in many other disciplines and advanced 
application areas, both inside and outside Georgia Tech,
•	 Providing superior educational opportunities to majors and nonmajors alike at 
all levels,
•	 Building programs of sufficient size to have a significant impact,
•	 Investing in emerging technical and educational areas.
Annual revisions that incorporate feedback and inputs from all segments of the 
College and our external constituencies have permitted us to refine these strategies 
in response to the continual change in our field and in the context of Georgia Tech.
