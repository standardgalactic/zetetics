According to Land´e’s own reminiscences: “Thus, working quite alone in Frank-
furt am Main without encouragement from colleagues, I found the key, the g-factor,
which then opened the drawer with the g-formula in it, while whole groups of older
physicists, even the great atomist Sommerfeld, remained in the dark” . . . “I cracked
the magnetic code of atomic structure by the g-factor, followed its applications in
the g-formula.”

Large-Angle Scattering
Brigitte Falkenburg
In the  scattering experiments of  particle physics, large-angle scattering in-
dicates the recoil of the scattered “probe” particles at an impenetrable small or
point-like scattering center. In the history of subatomic physics, it happened twice
that unexpected large-angle scattering was observed in a crucial experiment. Both
discoveries are based on a classical or  semi-classical model of the atomic nucleus
( Rutherford atom).
Rutherford Scattering
In order to investigate subatomic structure, Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) scat-
tered α particles from radioactive radiation sources off thin gold foil. In 1909,
Rutherford’s assistants Hans Geiger (1882–1945) and Ernest Marsden (1889–1970)

performed scattering experiments with low energy α-particles of around 5 MeV.
They observed unexpected backward scattering at an angle of >90◦.
Rutherford spent two years calculating the probability of multiple backward
scattering in several atomic models  Rutherford atom. The homogeneous charge
distribution of Thomson’s plum pudding model of the atom ( atomic models) could
not explain Geiger’s and Marsden’s discovery. Finally Rutherford derived his fa-
mous formula for the Coulomb scattering, i.e., the scattering of a charged particle
at a point-like positive charge described by a Coulomb potential [1]. Rutherford’s
atomic model with a point-like nucleus explained the backward scattering in terms
of the differential cross section ( scattering experiments)
dσ/dθ = (ℏc/4E)2(ZZ′α)2 sin−4 θ
2,
with the scattering angle θ, where E is the kinetic energy of the probe particles,
Z, Z′ are the charge numbers of the probe particles and the atomic nucleus, and α
is the ﬁne structure constant. The formula predicts a non-negligible probability of
large-angle scattering.
The prediction of the formula was conﬁrmed in subsequent scattering ex-
periments which measured the angular distribution of the scattered α-particles
[5, 6]. Rutherford’s model included an additional term for the shielding by the
electrons which turned out to be negligible. The experiments were neither sensitive
to deviations from Rutherford’s formula due to strong interactions between the
α-particles and the gold nucleus, nor to quantum mechanical effects. For the
Coulomb potential, the quantum mechanics of scattering results in Rutherford’s
formula, too.
Pointlike Nucleon Constituents
In 1968, a similar discovery recurred in a high-energy scattering experiment at
the SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator). Large angle scattering was observed for
inelastic electron-nucleon scattering [2, 8]. The measured total cross section ( scat-
tering experiments) turned out to be scale invariant, i.e., the crucial dimensionless
quantity obtained from it did not depend on the scattering energy of the probe
particles ( nucleus models). In a far-reaching formal analogy to the Rutherford
scattering, James Bjorken (∗1934) and Richard P. Feynman (1918–1988)interpreted
this scale invariance as evidence for pointlike scattering centers within the protons
and neutrons that constitute the atomic nucleus [3, 4, 7]. Their interpretation was
based on the heuristic idea that the higher the energy of the probe particles is, the
smaller structures can be measured in a  scattering experiment. Bjorken and Feyn-
man concluded that the scale invariance of the measured cross section indicated
pointlike partons within the proton and neutron, i.e., particles that carry fractional
charges and certain fractions of the proton or neutron momentum ( parton model).
After carrying out other scattering experiments of a similar type and after accumu-

lating much more additional experimental evidence, these “partons” were identiﬁed
with the quarks of the quark model established in 1963 ( Rutherford atom; Quarks,
see  Color Charge Degree of Freedom in Particle Physics; Mixing and Oscillations
of Particles; Particle Physics; Parton Model; QCD; QFT) [8].

Light Quantum
Klaus Hentschel
The light quantum concept comprises 12 layers of meaning which matured at very
different times, thus refuting the simplistic legend that Albert Einstein (1879–1955)
singlehandedly discovered them all in 1905. Einstein’s “heuristic point of view” was
actually regarded with extreme skepticism until 1922. Today’s understanding of the
subject takes for granted that light quanta:
• Are particle-like and localized
• Propagate at a ﬁnite velocity
• Have equal velocity for all colors (i.e., frequencies)
• Transmit energy E
• Transmit momentum p = E/c (giving rise to radiation pressure)
