Apprenticeship Training Standard  
The Apprenticeship Training Standard or herein after referred to as “Logbook” is a 
document issued to Apprentices who sign a Training Agreement in the  
Province of Ontario as an official record of training. It is to be used by the Apprentice  
and Sponsor/trainer to guide the process of skills development in a particular trade. 
Training As An Apprentice 
 Ensure you, your sponsor, and your witness sign a Training Agreement with the 
Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development. Once it is 
registered, you will receive a copy of the registered Training Agreement for your 
records. 
 Notify the local Service Delivery Office immediately if any changes to contact 
information or training agreement, especially if you change sponsors.

ask questions, seek feedback and have the trainer sign off on competencies  
 Keep an accurate record of the hours you work.  
 Attend classroom training when it is offered. 
 Apply for the financial incentives for which you are eligible. 
Completing Your Logbook 
 Complete the Sponsor Record Form – A form must be completed for each 
Sponsor/Trainer used during your apprenticeship.   
 Confirm Skill Sign-off is Complete 
• You and your trainer sign-off each required skill to confirm that you have 
demonstrated competency in that skill.

Foreword: Purpose, Terms and Conditions of the registered Training Agreement 
 
Purpose: 
• Prior to starting official apprenticeship activities, the apprentice, sponsor and a witness are 
required to sign a Training Agreement.    
• The Training Agreement that you have signed is an important legal document that outlines 
your responsibilities as an apprentice and the responsibilities of your sponsor.   
Once registered, this training agreement (or contract) marks the start of your formal 
agreement between the apprentice, the sponsor and the Ministry. 
• For compulsory trades, the apprenticeship registration document must be accessible when 
working. 
 
The Apprentice agrees: 
- 
To inform the local Service Delivery Office of any change to your contact information or 
change in sponsor within 7 days;  
- 
To follow the Sponsor’s and Trainer’s lawful instructions and make every effort to acquire 
the skills identified in the Logbook for the Trade which is part of the apprenticeship program 
established by Skilled Trades Ontario for the trade; 
- 
To obtain written verification from the Sponsor and the Trainer(s) that the requirements in 
the Logbook for the trade have been met. 
- 
When you receive an “Offer of Classroom Training”, confirm your attendance by following 
the instructions in the offer.  Failure to do so may result in losing your opportunity to attend 
school which delays the completion of your apprenticeship. 
 
The Sponsor agrees: 
- 
To ensure that the Apprentice is provided with the training required as part of the 
apprenticeship program established by Skilled Trades Ontario for this trade; 
- 
To review the progress of training with the Apprentice, and with the Trainer(s) where the 
Sponsor and the Trainer are not the same party. 
- 
Release your apprentice from work to attend in-school training without penalty to the 
apprentice. 
- 
To maintain the journeyperson/apprentice ratio for your trade, if applicable. 
- 
To monitor their apprentice(s) progress to ensure that the Trainer(s) verifies, in writing, 
when each skill identified in the Logbook for the trade has been successfully completed by 
the Apprentice; 
- 
To contact the Ministry should any changes in your capacity to train, your contact 
information, or your apprentice’s status in the program change.

Methodology- Standard Development 
 
A standard is developed with a broad group of trade representatives who form the initial working 
group. This includes subject matter experts/ tradespeople/ instructors and employers from a cross 
section of the sector/industry, with varying years of work experience in the field.  The working 
group reviews, develops, and recommends revision to the content of the standard. Their role also 
involves harmonizing and updating other supporting content for the product.   
 
An essential part of the standard development is the validation process.  This is the opportunity to 
have a broader representation of the sector provide feedback on the content of draft standard.  This 
process is conducted in various ways and may include sending out a survey or the draft document 
(or both) directly to the sector.  The comments received are reviewed by the working group and 
revisions are made as required based on a consensus model.

Introduction to the Logbook 
 
This “on-the job” Logbook is the training standard for Electrician-Construction and Maintenance 
(309A) was developed by Skilled Trades Ontario in consultation with representatives from industry. It 
identifies all the skills associated with and required to learn the trade.   
 
The Logbook is divided into skill sets, which are further divided into skills. These skill sets and skills 
are written in statements that describe what the Apprentice must perform and to what standard, in 
order to be considered competent in that skill.   
 
The successful performance of these skills is tracked in the Logbook. Once achieved, this skills’ sign-
off, along with the completion of in-school program requirements or equivalent, is how the 
apprenticeship program is completed and apprentices receive a Certificate of Apprenticeship. 
 
The Sponsor/trainer and Apprentice are required to sign-off and date each skill after the Apprentice 
has demonstrated proficiency in these skills. However, if a skill is shaded, it is optional and does not 
need to be signed-off, though it has been defined as a part of the scope of practice for the trade.   
 
All practices described in this standard must be performed by the apprentice according to the 
specific criteria identified.  
 
In general, the standard of performance for the trade of Electrician – Construction and 
Maintenance (309A) is as follows:  
 
Standard of Performance

Roles and Responsibilities of the Apprentice 
 
An Apprentice is an individual who has entered into a registered Training Agreement (refer to 
Forward: “Purpose, Terms and Conditions of TA” page 1) with a Sponsor to receive training in a 
trade as part of an apprenticeship program established by Skilled Trades Ontario. As an Apprentice, 
you have certain roles and responsibilities to follow throughout your apprenticeship training: 
 
1. As an Apprentice, you signed the Training Agreement and have entered into a contract with 
the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development and your Sponsor. 
 
2. If you are registered as an Apprentice in a compulsory trade, your name will automatically 
appear in the Skilled Trades Ontario Public Register. 
 
3. You are responsible for informing the staff at your local Service Delivery Office regarding 
changes to the following: 
 
• Your Sponsor’s address; 
• Your name and address; and/or, 
• Your Sponsor, including starting employment with a new Sponsor

Roles and Responsibilities of Sponsors and Trainers 
 
Sponsors are responsible for ensuring all terms are met as per the registered Training Agreement. 
They are named on the registered Training Agreement as the entity responsible for ensuring 
Apprentices receive the training required as part of an apprenticeship program. As a signatory to 
this agreement, they are designated as the ‘Signing Authority’ for the Apprentice’s Skill Set 
Completion Form and are required to attest to successful achievement by signing the appropriate 
box at the completion of each skill set.  Some sponsors may also act as the Trainer. 
 
A Trainer is an individual who oversees the performance of a task and sets the workplace 
expectations and practices for the Apprentice.  
 
In compulsory trades, a Trainer must hold a valid Certificate of Qualification and be registered with 
Skilled Trades Ontario.   
 
In non-compulsory trades, a Trainer is an individual who holds one of the following: 
• A Certificate of Qualification.  
• A Certificate of Apprenticeship in the trade; or, 
• Has completed both the workplace-based training (competencies and/or hours as 
applicable) and classroom training components of the trade’s apprenticeship program; or, 
• Has workplace experience equivalent to the apprenticeship program) and has the skills 
outlined in the Logbook.   
 
Competency means being able to perform to the required standard (please refer to “Introduction to 
the Logbook”).  Trainers/Sponsors and Apprentices are required to sign-off and date the skills in the 
Logbook following each successful acquisition.  The Logbook forms a record of this achievement.  
 
The Trainer must provide their signature based on their assessment and professional judgment that 
the apprentice is competent in the skills described above.  The Trainer’s signature is not a general 
warranty or guarantee of the apprentice’s future conduct.  A classroom instructor is not permitted 
to sign-off the skills contained within this Logbook 
 
Sponsors participating in this training program will be designated as the Signing Authority and are 
required to attest to successful achievement by signing the appropriate box included at the end of 
each skill set.

Health and Safety 
 
Safe working procedures and conditions, accident prevention and the preservation of health are of 
primary importance for apprenticeship programs in Ontario.  These responsibilities are shared and 
require the joint efforts of government, sponsors, employers, supervisors, workers, apprentices and 
the public to achieve the goal of making Ontario's workplaces safe and healthy.  
 
The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) provides us with the legal framework and the tools 
to do this. It sets out the rights and duties of all parties in the workplace, placing ultimate 
responsibility on the employer for the health and safety of workers (in this case apprentices) by 
ensuring procedures, controls, and training are established for dealing with workplace hazards.  
Therefore, it is imperative that all parties become aware of circumstances that may lead to injury, 
illness or harm. Safe learning experiences and environments can be created by controlling the 
variables and behaviours that may contribute to or cause an accident injury or illness. 
 
A sponsor who is not the employer is reminded that the employer has legal responsibilities 
respecting health and safety over the apprentice who is their worker. The sponsor should encourage 
safe work habits and adherence to the employer’s occupational health and safety requirements for 
the workplace.  
 
It is generally recognized that a positive attitude about safety in partnership with health and safety 
competency contributes to an accident-free environment. Everyone will benefit as a result of a 
healthy attitude towards the prevention of accidents.  
 
Workers and apprentices can be exposed to a multitude of hazards and, therefore, should be 
familiar with the Occupational Health and Safety Act and regulations. 
 
The Internal Responsibility System: 
 
One of the primary purposes of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) is to facilitate a 
strong Internal Responsibility System (IRS) in the workplace. To this end, the OHSA lays out the 
duties of employers, supervisors, workers, apprentices, constructors and workplace owners. 
 
Workplace parties’ compliance with their respective statutory duties is essential to the 
establishment of a strong IRS in the workplace. 
 
Simply put, the IRS means that everyone in the workplace has a role to play in keeping workplaces 
safe and healthy. Workers and apprentices in the workplace who see a health and safety problem 
such as a hazard or contravention of the OHSA in the workplace have a statutory duty to report the 
situation to the employer or a supervisor. Employers and supervisors are, in turn, required to 
address those situations and acquaint workers with any hazard in the work that they do. 

Electrician – Construction and Maintenance

The IRS helps support a safe and healthy workplace. In addition to the workplace parties' 
compliance with their legal duties, the IRS is further supported by well-defined health and safety 
policies and programs, including the design, control, monitoring and supervision of the work being 
performed. 
 
Roles and Responsibilities under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 
 
Employer’s Responsibilities include but are not limited to the following:  
• Instruct, inform and supervise workers and apprentices to protect their health and safety. 
• Appoint competent persons as supervisors. 
• Inform a worker, apprentice, or a person in authority, about any hazard in the workplace and 
train them in the handling, storage, use, disposal and transport of any equipment, 
substances, tools, material, etc. 
• Take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a 
worker/apprentice.  
• In workplaces in which more than five workers are regularly employed, prepare and post a 
written occupational health and safety policy and set up and maintain a program to 
implement it. 
• Prepare and post policies with respect to workplace violence and workplace harassment and 
develop programs supporting workplace harassment and workplace violence policies. 
• Ensure knowledge of applicable legislative, regulatory, codes and standards so requirements 
to be followed are clear to all workers/apprentices. 
 
Trainer/Supervisor Responsibilities include but are not limited to the following: 
• Ensure that a worker or apprentice works in compliance with the Act and regulations. 
• Ensure that any equipment, protective device or clothing required by the employer is used 
or worn by the worker or apprentice. 
• Advise a worker/apprentice of any potential or actual health or safety dangers known by the 
supervisor. 
• Take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of workers. 
 
Worker/Apprentice Responsibilities include but are not limited to the following: 
• Work in compliance with the Act and regulations. 
• Use or wear any equipment, protective devices or clothing required by the employer. 
• Report to the employer or supervisor any known missing or defective equipment or 
protective device that may endanger the worker or another worker. 
• Report any hazard or contravention of the Act or regulations to the employer or supervisor. 
• Not remove or make ineffective any protective device required by the employer or by the 
regulations. 
• Not use or operate any equipment or work in a way that may endanger any worker. 

Electrician – Construction and Maintenance

The Three Rights of Workers/Apprentices 
 
The OHSA gives workers and apprentices three important rights: 
1. The right to know about hazards in their work and get information, supervision and 
instruction to protect their health and safety on the job. 
2. The right to participate in identifying and solving workplace health and safety problems 
either through a health and safety representative or a worker member of a joint health and 
safety committee. 
3. The right to refuse work that they believe is dangerous to their health and safety or that of 
any other worker in the workplace. 
 
For construction projects applying to construction trades a Constructor is also identified  
 
On all projects, either the owner or someone hired by the owner is the constructor.  
 
The intent of the Occupational Health and Safety Act is to have one person with overall authority for 
health and safety matters on a project. This person is the constructor of the project. 
 
The constructor is the party with the greatest degree of control over health and safety at the entire 
project and is ultimately responsible for the health and safety of all workers and apprentices. The 
constructor must ensure that all the employers, apprentices and workers on the project comply 
with the Act and its regulations. 
 
Constructor’s duties include the following: 
• To ensure that the measures and procedures in the Act and regulations are carried out. 
• To ensure that every employer, apprentice and worker on the project complies with the Act 
and regulations. 
• To ensure that the health and safety of workers/apprentices on the project are protected. 
 
Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development 
 
The Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development conducts periodic inspections 
of workplaces to ensure that safety acts and regulations are being followed. Please direct any 
questions to the Occupational Health and Safety Contact Centre at 1-877-202-0008.

Important Considerations for Electrical Work: De-energized vs Live Systems  
 
Rules for Electrical Work 
When performing work functions, individuals may be working with live or de-energized systems. The 
first rule of work for workers and apprentices is that systems should always be treated as live until 
de-energization is confirmed.  When possible, work should always be completed in a de-energized 
state.  Prior to beginning work, qualified individuals must determine if work can be done in a de-
energized environment or obtain employer rationale for not being able to de-energize.

Ready to Write Your Exam? 
 
Many of the skilled trades in Ontario have a final certification examination that you must pass to 
become certified in your trade. Passing the examination gives you the right to hold yourself out as 
a Journeyperson and receive a Certificate of Qualification in your trade. 
 
There are two types of trade certification examinations in Ontario: 
1. Provincial (Ontario) examinations - which lead to a Certificate of Qualification. 
2. Red Seal examinations – which lead to a Certificate of Qualification with an Interprovincial 
Red Seal endorsement. 
 
If a trade is designated as Red Seal in Ontario, you will be writing the Red Seal examination.  
To access the Red Seal preparation guide please visit:  red-seal.ca

Appendix A — Instructions for Apprenticeship Program Completion  
 
Once an Apprentice has completed all the classroom training and benchmark on-the-job hours 
specified for the trade and has acquired all the mandatory skills included in this Logbook.  
 
The Apprentice and the Sponsor complete the Apprentice Completion Form and the Skill Set 
Completion for Sponsors Form located on the following pages. 
 
1. They sign the forms and submit them to their local Service Delivery Office. To find the closest 
office, check the contact information at ontario.ca/page/employment-ontario-
apprenticeship-offices or call the Employment Ontario toll free number at (1-800-387-5656).   
 
2. For All Trades:  All mandatory skills (or the combination indicated in the completion 
requirements for the trade) in the Logbook must be signed-off.  The recommended hours are 
a benchmark.  If the Sponsor is completing the Apprentice before the industry recommended 
training hours are done, staff may request further information regarding the Apprentice’s on-
the-job training.  An example of a request would be a letter from the Sponsor confirming the 
Apprentice worked for some time in the trade before the initial Training Agreement was 
registered, thereby acquiring some skills beforehand. 
 
If Apprentices are submitting the completion request form and supporting documentation to their 
local Service Delivery Office by mail, fax, or email (as a scanned document), they should not 
include their Logbook; if they are presenting this form in person at the local Service Delivery 
Office, they should bring their Logbook with them.  
 
After staff verifies all the information in the completion request, they may contact either the 
Apprentice or the Sponsor for further information or documentation. Once the completion has 
been confirmed, the local Service Delivery Office will issue a Certificate of Apprenticeship to the 
Apprentice.  
 
Skilled Trades Ontario will receive notification of this completion.  
• If the Apprentice has completed a program in a compulsory trade, Skilled Trades Ontario 
will automatically register the Apprentice for a Provisional certificates of qualification to 
continue to work legally for one year while preparing for the certification examination.  
• If an Apprentice completes their apprenticeship in a non-compulsory trade and there is a 
Certificate of Qualification exam, they must write and pass the exam to receive a 
Certificate of Qualification from Skilled Trades Ontario. 
 
For permission to schedule an exam once completion is confirmed, the individual must first 
contact the Skilled Trades Ontario Client Services Department at 647-847-3000 or toll free at  
1-855-299-0028 to pay the certification examination fee. Once you have paid your exam fee with 
Skilled Trades Ontario, book your exam by contacting your nearest Employment Ontario local 
Service Delivery Office.
