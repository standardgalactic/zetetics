Abstract. In autonomous driving, the temporal stability of 3D object
detection greatly impacts the driving safety. However, the detection sta-
bility cannot be accessed by existing metrics such as mAP and MOTA,
and consequently is less explored by the community. To bridge this gap,
this work proposes Stability Index (SI), a new metric that can compre-
hensively evaluate the stability of 3D detectors in terms of confidence,
box localization, extent, and heading. By benchmarking state-of-the-art
object detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, SI reveals interesting
properties of object stability that have not been previously discovered
by other metrics. To help models improve their stability, we further in-
troduce a general and effective training strategy, called Prediction Con-
sistency Learning (PCL). PCL essentially encourages the prediction con-
sistency of the same objects under different timestamps and augmenta-
tions, leading to enhanced detection stability. Furthermore, we examine
the effectiveness of PCL with the widely-used CenterPoint, and achieve
a remarkable SI of 86.00 for vehicle class, surpassing the baseline by
5.48. We hope our work could serve as a reliable baseline and draw the
community’s attention to this crucial issue in 3D object detection.

Introduction
3D object detection aims to perceive objects of interest within the surrounding
environment, utilizing data from diverse sources such as point clouds [12, 19,
36, 45, 48, 52], camera images [22, 42], multi-sensors [8, 23, 28], etc. Serving as a
foundational component in autonomous driving, this task has attracted great
attention from both academia and industry. Numerous performant detectors [4,
16,21,41,42,46,51,53] have been proposed recently, significantly advancing the
development of 3D object detection.
Counterintuitively, it is rather common for highly performant detectors to
exhibit instability. Sensor noise, model sensitivity, slight scene changes, and non-

association and induces an abnormal velocity estimation. On the right, an intent of

results are predicted by [45], and object tracking is conducted with SimpleTrack [27].
deterministic operators, all contribute to detection instability. Despite great ad-
vancements, current state-of-the-art detectors predominantly emphasize improv-
ing single-shot detection accuracy, while often neglecting such temporal stability.
Detection stability encompasses more than mere robustness; it extends to the
broader context of ensuring human safety in autonomous driving. As exemplified
in Fig. 1, unstable detections, on both confidence scores and bounding boxes, can
result in abnormal velocity estimated by tracking. These erroneous estimations
may trigger false judgement on the behaviors of surrounding agents, potentially
misleading the ego-vehicle to make improper or even hazardous decisions. In
addition, systematically complementing poor detection stability requires extra
modules (e.g., Kalman filters [3,5,44] with carefully and usually manually tuned
parameters). This not only increases system complexity and latency, but also
necessitates tedious engineering efforts. As a conclusion, enhancing detection
stability is a crucial step towards safe and reliable autonomous driving.
To the best of our efforts, we find no prior work dedicating on detection
stability for 3D object detectors. One primary reason is the absence of an appro-
priate metric to quantify such stability. Current metrics in measuring detection
accuracy, such as mAP [14], usually overlook temporal information, which is
fundamental for stability assessment. On the other hand, metrics designed for
temporal object tracking (e.g., MOTA and MOTP [2]) are tailored to evaluate
how well objects are tracked over time. Trackers are designed to be robust with
respect to detection noises. A well-implemented tracking algorithm will certainly
hide instabilities of upstream detectors. As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), although the
detector produced inconsistent yaw and positions across two frames, trackers can
still associate the two boxes and fuse the well-behaving box extent information.
We argue a new metric is needed for detection stability. For this purpose,
we initiate a comprehensive analysis of the task, identifying that an effective
metric should exhibit four core properties: 1) Comprehensiveness: The metric
must take all detected attributes into account. 2) Homogeneity: All attributes
should be uniformly integrated into the metric. 3) Symmetry: The metric should
be consistent regardless of the input order. 4) Marginal Unimodality: The metric

value will never increase as the stability of any element deteriorates. Based on
our analysis, we accordingly propose a novel metric called Stability Index (SI),
which evaluates stability by quantifying the temporal consistency in terms of the
confidence score, box location, extent, and heading. Through our meticulously
designed schemes, the proposed SI fully complies with all the aforementioned
requirements, as demonstrated by our rigorous theoretical proofs.
On the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) [38], we thoroughly bench-
mark various popular 3D object detectors and observe that there is no evident
correlation between existing metrics (e.g., mAP and MOTA) and our proposed
stability metric SI. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that some effective tricks
in object detection, like using more augmentations and multi-frame strategies,
fail to yield many improvements in terms of stability.
To this end, we additionally introduce a framework called Prediction Consis-
tency Learning (PCL), which in essence penalizes prediction errors’ discrepancies
from the same objects under different timestamps and augmentations. It’s note-
worthy that our PCL is a general framework applicable to all detectors, and it
introduces no additional cost during inference. Without bells and whistles, PCL
boosts the SI of CenterPoint [48] from 80.52 to an impressive 86.00 SI on the
vehicle class, surpassing all state-of-the-art detectors.
We summarize our contributions as follows:
1. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive analysis of detection stability.
Subsequently, we introduce the Stability Index (SI) metric, which uniformly
evaluates and positively indicates the stability of all detection elements. Rig-
orous theoretical proofs are further presented to validate the efficacy of SI.
2. A general framework termed Prediction Consistency Learning (PCL) is pro-
posed to boost detection stability. Extensive experiments on the Waymo
Open Dataset unearth several intriguing insights of object stability as well
as demonstrate the effectiveness of the PCL.

3D Object Detection
3D object detection, a fundamental building block in autonomous driving, fo-
cuses on accurately locating objects within a three-dimensional space. Prior
works in this domain can be broadly categorized based on input modalities.
Most existing LiDAR-based works [12,13,15,19,20,36,45,48,52,53] transform
non-uniform point clouds into regular 2D pillars or 3D voxels, and employ convo-
lutions for efficient processing in later stages. Beyond voxel-based methods, the
task can also be accomplished using alternative point cloud representations, in-
cluding the range-view [4,7,16,26,39], point-view [9,21,29,30,34,35,37,46,47,49,
51], and their combinations [32,39]. Several studies [24,38,41] introduce recently
popular Transformer architectures and achieve remarkable detection accuracies.
Transformer architectures also demonstrate great success in transforming
camera images into bird’s-eye-view features. Such algorithmic breakthrough paved

the way for vision [22,42] and fusion [8,23,28] based 3D detection for self-driving
vehicles. It’s noteworthy that our proposed metric and method are agnostic to
input modalities, thus applicable to all 3D object detection methods.
2.2
Related Metrics
Properly measuring performances is crucial for any machine learning task, let
alone 3D object detection. The KITTI [18] dataset plays a pioneering role in
evaluating autonomous driving tasks, employing the well-established average
precision (AP) as metric. Waymo Open Dataset [38] further extends the metric
into APH by accounting for heading errors. In contrast, nuScenes [6] questions
the suitability of IOU-based metrics for vision-only methods, which usually come
with large localization errors. Therefore, a new metric called NDS is proposed
to assess error-prone predictions by utilizing a thresholded 2D center distance.
Multi-object tracking (MOT), the downstream task of object detection, stands
as another critical component for autonomous driving. Bernardin and Stiefelha-
gen [2] introduces metrics of MOTA and MOTP, where MOTA combines errors
including False Negatives, False Positives, and Identity Switches, while MOTP
focuses on how good sequences overlap with ground truths. Weng et al. [43]
points out that both metrics do not take scores into account, and extends them
into AMOTA and AMOTP by averaging scores across different recall levels. In
general, detection metrics disregard temporal relationships of detected boxes,
whereas tracking metrics mainly focus on whether objects are correctly associ-
ated across frames. Previous methods fall short in capturing detection stability
across frames, which serves as the key motivation behind this work.

Methodology
In this section, we first comprehensively analyze the stability in 3D object detec-
tion. Based on our analysis, we introduce a novel metric called Stability Index(SI)
and prove its key properties. In the end, we introduce our Prediction Consistency
Learning (PCL) to enhance detection stability.
3.1
Notations
A valid prediction P from 3D object detectors comprises a confidence score c
and a 3D bounding box defined as B = (x, y, z, l, w, h, θ). Here, (x, y, z) are
the coordinates of the box center, while (l, w, h) denote the box extent, and θ
represents the yaw angle. Elements and attributes are used interchangeably to
refer to the box properties.
Given two boxes B1 and B2, we define a transformation function TB1→B2(·)
which represents the mapping from B1 to B2. Consequently, we can apply this
customized transformation to an arbitrary box B, resulting in ˆB = TB1→B2(B),

In essence, this operation transforms discrepancies between B1 and B into those
between B2 and ˆB.
3.2
Analysis of Detection Stability
In the context of autonomous driving, variations in any of the predicted at-
tributes from detectors may result in hazardous situations. For instance, fluctu-
ations in box locations and heading may lead to inaccurate velocity estimations,
potentially leading to unsafe interaction decisions. Unstable confidence scores
may cause flickering predictions and hinder the autonomous driving system from
accurately tracking objects. Moreover, erratic predictions of a nearby vehicle’s
size may prompt the ego-vehicle to take improper evasive maneuvering. In sum-
mary, the stability of all detection elements must be comprehensively taken into
account to ensure the safety of autonomous driving.
A naive approach for assessing stability is to sum variations of all these
elements, essentially extending Zhang and Wang [50] in 2D video detection.
However, these variations should not be directly added as these detection at-
tributes represent different physical properties of the object. Moreover, element
variations are agnostic of the object properties and therefore fail to capture the
hazard levels caused by unstable predictions. For example, large jitters on the
yaw angle can lead to rapid changes in object behaviors for large-volume objects
(e.g., vehicles). In contrast, pedestrians suffer more from the instability of center

offsets and box dimensions rather than headings. Therefore, how to standardize
these elements into a single and consistent unit remains a challenging problem.
One possible way to unify physical units of the box-related elements is to
adopt the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) as used in the mAP metric. To achieve
this, we begin by assessing detection stability at the smallest unit, involving a
single object at two timestamps t1, t2 as illustrated in Fig. 2. Denote the ground-
truth boxes as Bg
1, Bg
2 and the predictions are Pi = {ci, Bi}, i ∈{1, 2}. The IoU
between the two predicted 3D boxes cannot be directly computed due to object
movement. In contrast, our pre-defined operation enables the measurement by
projecting boxes onto one of the ground-truths. For example, we can project B1
into the second ground-truth as ˆB1 = TBg
1 →Bg
2 (B1) and compute IoU( ˆB1, B2).
This IoU can reflect the detection stability to some extent. Nevertheless, this
measurement has two significant flaws (proved by Properties 1 and 2 in the
supplementary): (1) IoU varies with the order of frames, i.e., IoU( ˆB1, B2) ̸=
IoU(B1, ˆB2). (2) IoU is not marginal unimodal. In other words, enhancing the
stability of an element can, at times, lead to a poorer IoU value. Both flaws
prohibit IoU from serving as an effective assessment of detection stability.
Through the detailed analysis of stability and exploration of potential solu-
tions, we identify four key properties that an effective metric should meet:
– Comprehensiveness: The metric should comprehensively reflect influences
from all relevant detection elements.
– Homogeneity: Influences caused by all elements should be well-processed
into unified physical units.
– Symmetry: The metric values should be consistent when applied to both
forward and reverse inputs.
– Marginal Unimodality: For each element with others fixed, the metric
should be unimodal w.r.t. its stability.
3.3
Stability Index
While the IoU is a promising starting point, meeting the four properties de-
mands careful designs to effectively integrate the confidence score and address
the asymmetry and non-unimodality design flows. To this end, we introduce
schemes of projection with pivot boxes, element decoupling, and stability aggre-
gation, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Ultimately, we assess the stability of object pairs
in consecutive frames and denote the metric as Stability Index (SI).
Projection with pivot box. Since projections onto either of ground-truths can
introduce the asymmetry issue, we therefore propose to cast predictions onto an
intermediary pivot box Bp = (0, 0, 0, lp, wp, hp, 0). Here, we leverage geometric
averages lp =

2 to ensure that the pivot
box’s dimensions closely match those of the ground-truths Bg
1, Bg
2. This is crucial
for accurate stability measurements, as objects of different sizes are affected
by fluctuations to varying degrees. Finally, we have ˆB1 = TBg
1 →Bp(B1), ˆB2 =
TBg
2 →Bp(B2) as indicated in Fig. 2(b).

Element decoupling. For the marginal unimodality, the metric must exhibit
the following two characteristics when all elements are fixed except for one arbi-
trary element: (1) The metric reaches the peak value if and only if the element is
stable. (2) The metric value is monotonically non-decreasing as the stability of an
element deteriorates in any continuous direction. We recognize that IoU fails to
meet these characteristics due to the mutual interference between elements, and
therefore propose to decouple them into four distinct parts as shown in Fig. 2(c).
For instance, to measure the localization stability, we make elements except for
box centers in ˆB1, ˆB2 to be identical. Specifically, we replace them with those
from the pivot box, resulting in ˆBloc
i
= (ˆxi, ˆyi, ˆzi, lp, wp, hp, 0), i ∈{1, 2}. Simi-
larly, we can have ˆBext
i
, ˆBhdg
i
, i ∈{1, 2} for the box extent and heading. Then,
we assess the stability in box localization and extent by the two equations:
  \ s mall  \Met
r i cS {}
_ {l
} =  \iou  (\ha
t
 B^{lo
c
}_1, \hat B^{loc}_2),\quad \MetricS {}_{e} = \iou (\hat B^{ext}_1, \hat B^{ext}_2). 
(1)
Directly employing IoU( ˆBhdg
1
, ˆBhdg
2
), however, violates the unimodality if the
angle difference between ˆθ1 and ˆθ2 exceeds π/4 (proved in Lemma 3 in our
supplementary). Therefore, we regard this case as a failure and explicitly set the
metric to be 0. The stability in box heading finally is
  \ s

l \Met r icS { }_{h
} = \left
 
\ { \be

in  {split} &0, \qquad \quad \text {if } |\hat \theta _1-\hat \theta _2| \geq \pi /4,\\ &\iou (\hat B^{hdg}_1, \hat B^{hdg}_2),\ \text {otherwise.}\\ \end {split} \right . 
(2)
The stability in confidence can be captured by the difference between the
scores c1, c2, i.e., using 1 −|c1 −c2|. A remaining issue is that this function is
vulnerable to intrinsic confidence scales of object detectors. For example, if all
scores are divided by a scaling factor, the detection performance and stability
should remain unaffected. However, the value of 1 −|c1 −c2| would increase,
leading to an inaccurate measurement of stability. To address this issue, we cal-
culate 99% and 1% percentile of all confidences as c0.99 and c0.01. The confidence
stability is then calibrated by
  \ s mal
l
 \ M e tri c S {}_{c} =  \max \
l
eft (0, 1 - |c_1 - c_2| / (c^{0.99}- c^{0.01})\right ). 
(3)
Stability aggregation. In the last step, we aggregate stability from all com-
ponents using the following formulation:
  \ sma l l SI  = S I _c \times (SI_l + SI_e + SI_h)/3. 
(4)
Here, SIc ∈[0, 1] is treated as the weight of the box stability. SIl, SIe, SIh can
be averaged thanks to the same unit of IoU. In the end, SI successfully satisfies
the four properties of a valid stability evaluator according to Lemmas 1 and 2.
Detailed analyses and theoretical proofs are available in our supplementary.
Lemma 1. SI is a symmetric metric which uniformly assesses all elements’
influences on the detection stability.
Lemma 2. SI is marginal unimodality w.r.t. all elements. The maximum value
of 1 is reached if and only if the detection is perfectly stable across frames.

Fig. 3: The pipeline of the proposed Prediction Consistency Learning (PCL). In each
iteration, PCL samples a pair of frames at neighboring timestamps t and t′, and applies
augmentations M and M′ to the paired samples. GT-prediction matching and cross-
frame matching then collaboratively associate the detector’s predictions from the same
objects between the two frames. After the de-augmentation procedure, PCL calculates
the prediction errors in terms of confidence, localization, extent, and heading, which are
defined in the object self-coordinate system. Finally, PCL penalizes the error disparities
among all prediction pairs to enforce the temporal consistency. In the figure, pred. and
aug. represent prediction and augmentation, respectively.
Our previous discussions focus on the smallest set, consisting of a single object
at two consecutive timestamps. To assess SI for large-scale benchmarks, we begin
by pairing each ground-truth with a prediction using the Hungarian algorithm.
With the labeled object IDs, we segment the evaluation into calculating SI for
numerous smallest sets. The final result is simply the average of all values. More
details like the handling of corner cases are presented in the supplementary.
3.4
Prediction Consistency Learning
Beyond the design of the metric, we further attempt to boost the detection stabil-
ity of 3D object detectors. For this purpose, we introduce a general and effective
training strategy named Prediction Consistency Learning (PCL), as illustrated
in Fig. 3. Our PCL is built on the core idea of encouraging prediction consis-
tency across frames under various augmentations and timestamps. It consists
of four key stages: neighborhood sampling, prediction pairing, de-augmentation,
and prediction consistency loss.
Neighborhood sampling. For each frame F with timestamp t, we begin by
uniformly sampling an integer ∆t from the range [−n, n], where n is a pre-defined
parameter. Subsequently, we get the frame F ′ at timestamp t + ∆t and bundle
F, F ′ as a pair-wise input for the network. The frames are further augmented sep-
arately by random flipping, rotation, and scaling. We record the augmentations
into matrices M and M′, where M can be described as follows:

Here, ix and iy indicate whether the frames are x and y direction flipped, with
-1 meaning the corresponding flipping occurs and 1 otherwise. α is the angle
applied by random rotation, and s denotes the factor for random scaling.
Prediction pairing. After the detector generating predictions from paired sam-
ples, our next step is to gather the corresponding predictions for comparisons.
We first perform the GT-prediction matching to assign each ground-truth box
with the best-matched prediction, which can be accomplished by the Hungarian
algorithm or any other rational method. Subsequently, cross-frame matching as-
sociates predictions between two frames by corresponding object IDs and creates
prediction pairs for later comparisons.
De-augmentation. Data augmentation used during training can largely alter
the patterns of detection errors, impeding fair comparisons of predictions in
each pair. For example, random scaling can scale up the errors in box locations
and extents, while random flipping may change the error direction. Therefore,
we apply a de-augmentation step on each prediction to eliminate the influences
of augmentations. For a prediction P = {c, x, y, z, l, w, h, θ}, we recover it into
¯P = {¯c, ¯x, ¯y, ¯z, ¯l, ¯w, ¯h, ¯θ} with the corresponding M:

(6)
Prediction consistency loss. Before introducing the consistency loss, we first
compute prediction errors for a de-augmented prediction ¯P with respect to the
ground-truth box Bg. We define the error for confidence as ec = 1−¯c. Prediction
errors in box localization, extent, and heading are computed in the object’s ego-
coordinate system. Specifically, the error for box center is calculated by

(7)
The prediction error for the box extent is formulated as
  \
small \ mathbf  {e}_e = \left (\bar l/ l^g, \bar w/ w^g, \bar h/h^g\right )^T. 
(8)
In the end, the error eh for box heading is encoded into trigonometric vectors:
  \
s

\l eft (\sin (\bar \theta - \theta ^g), \cos (\bar \theta - \theta ^g)\right )^T. 
(9)
Our final step is to encourage each prediction pair to reveal similar patterns
in terms of prediction errors. Thereby, we collect the pair-wise errors {ec,i, e′
c,i},
{el,i, e′
l,i}, {ee,i, e′
e,i}, and {eh,i, e′
h,i} for i ∈{1, 2, · · · , N}, where N is the
number of successfully associated objects between frames F and F ′. In the end,

Experiments
4.1
Benchmark on the Waymo Open Dataset
Implementation details. We replicate commonly used LiDAR-based and fusion-
based 3D detectors on top of OpenPCDet [40] and MMDetection3D [11]. All
detectors are trained on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) [38] with default config-
urations. Our training uses the full version of the training set, consisting of 798
sequences with 158,361 samples. We evaluate these models with the LEVEL 1
mAP weighted by Heading accuracy (mAPH) and the proposed SI on the val-
idation set, which contains 202 sequences with 40,077 samples. Besides the SI,
we further present its sub-indicators of stability on confidence (SIc), localization
(SIl), extent (SIe), and heading (SIh).
Relation between SI and mAPH. Tab. 1 presents model results on cate-
gories of vehicle, pedestrian, and cyclist. Models are sorted by the mAPH on the
class vehicle, and we highlight the two best performing models in each column.
From the results, we find that there is no evident correlation between detection
accuracy and model stability. For instance, TransFusion has the highest mAPH
on the class vehicle while its SI is much lower than the LiDAR-based coun-
terparts with similar detection metrics. That could be because the fusion model
improves detection accuracy by additional information from camera images. The
visual information, however, is indirect in inferring precise 3D locations, thereby
increasing the detection uncertainty. On the other hand, CenterPoint achieves

73.73 mAPH for vehicle detection, higher than Second and PointPillar. But it
has the lowest SI of 80.52 among all detectors. These results negate definitive
positive relations between the two metrics.
Influence of object properties. Fig. 4 shows how various object properties
affect detection stability. We group objects based on specified properties and
detect them with CenterPoint. Fig. 4(a) presents a negative relationship between
detection stability and object distance, where longer distances correspond to
harder objects to learn in general. For all classes, SI increases with the number
of object points and becomes saturated when the point number reaches 53, as
demonstrated in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 4 (c) and (d) further explore the effects of object
volumes and length-to-width ratios for vehicles. We find that small vehicles tend
to have more stable detection. Vehicles with length-to-width ratios between 2 and
3 exhibit relatively high SI values. This may be attributed to the prevalence of
such vehicles in real-world scenarios. Vehicles with larger length-to-width ratios,
such as trucks/trams/buses, are relatively scarcer in the dataset, and require
larger receptive field requirements, making them more unstable in detection.
Effects of multi-frame strategy. Merging several consecutive point clouds
as one input is a commonly used strategy to address the sparsity in LiDAR
data. Tab. 2 reveals that this scheme not only improves model accuracy but also
benefits detection stability. Taking the vehicle for example, using four frames
results in notable improvements in the detection accuracy of CenterPoint and
PV R-CNN, reaching 75.85 and 80.51 mAPH, which surpass the baseline by
2.12 and 2.18 mAPH. Meanwhile, the values of SI for CenterPoint and PV R-

CNN are increased by 1.22 and 2.33, respectively. This trend is consistent for all
classes, illustrating the general effectiveness of the strategy in boosting detection
performances of both accuracy and stability.
Summary. Our experiments verify that the proposed SI is a complementary
metric to detection accuracy. The metric value varies a lot for different model
types and demonstrates several interesting patterns w.r.t. object properties. We
also examine two common-used schemes including data augmentation (in the
supplementary) and the multi-frame strategy. Increasing the degree of data aug-
mentation has a minor impact on detection stability. Though using multi-frames
is proven to be beneficial, it places heavy computational overhead during en-
coding data into voxel features. In contrast, our proposed PCL introduces no
additional computations during inference, while significantly improving detec-
tion stability as illustrated by the later experiments.
4.2
Experiments on PCL
Implementation details. We employ the widely-used CenterPoint as our base
model, which is trained with the default setting in OpenPCDet. Specifically, we
train the model for 36 epochs with the Adam optimizer. The one-cycle policy
with an initial learning rate 0.003 is used. The learning rate gradually increases to
0.03 in the first 40% epochs and then gradually decreases in the rest of training.
Instead of end-to-end training, we choose to fine-tune the base model with
PCL equipped for a few epochs. Training configuration mirrors that of the end-
to-end one, with the exception that the epoch number is reduced to 5 and the
learning rate is divided by 10. It’s noteworthy that the scheme not only highly
reduces training cost, but also shows how effectively PCL can take effect.
Effectiveness of PCL. We compare the performances of models fine-tuned
with and without PCL, as shown in Tab. 3. It can be observed that directly fine-
tuning the model has a marginal impact on both model accuracy and stability. In
contrast, when using PCL without cross-frame information involved (i.e., n = 0),
we already achieve SI values of 84.54, 70.95, and 68.80 for vehicle, pedestrian, and
cyclist, respectively. These results reveal significant enhancements, with gains of
+4.49, +3.52, and +0.60 compared to the baseline. For the mAP, we find an

interesting phenomenon: the mAP of three classes changes by +1.87, +0.63, and
-0.39. That leads to two valuable conclusions: (1) Our PCL not only enhances
stability but also improves the overall detection accuracy, particularly for the
vehicle class. (2) Regardless of how the mAP changes, the SI is consistently
improved, reinforcing that these two metrics assess different model attributes.
Effects of the interval between frame pairs. A key hyper-parameter of
PCL is the maximum interval n between a pair of frames, as described in the
neighborhood sampling. The larger n becomes, the longer the spans between two
frames contrasted by PCL will be. The results in Tab. 3 show opposing trends
in the detection accuracy and stability with n changes. Take the class vehicle
as an example. When n = 0, we have the highest mAP of 75.57 and the lowest
SI of 85.42 among all PCL models. The mAP eventually drops to 74.54 as n
grows. On the contrary, the model stability gradually rises to 86.00 SI with n
being 16. This may be because object morphology can change considerably when
the frame interval n grows. Forcefully aligning them can bring damage to model
accuracy. However, such alignment promotes consistent predictions for the same
objects, which subsequently leads to stable detection.
Effects of loss components in PCL. Our introduced consistency loss com-
prises components of confidence, localization, extent, and heading. We examine
the model performances with various combinations of these loss components and
report the results in Tab. 4. These results show that each part of the loss in PCL
can boost the model stability from the corresponding aspect, which confirms the
effectiveness of each component in PCL. The detection accuracy and stability
are the highest with all loss parts involved.
The loss component related to confidence score yields the highest improve-
ments in the final SI. This may be because that the classification loss for training
detectors primarily focuses on whether an object is correctly classified, leaving
sufficient room for enhancing consistency. In contrast, box parameters already
have a latent potential for consistent predictions as they all use ground-truth
labels as the targets. Enforcing consistency on these parameters is not as in-
fluential as it is on the confidence score. Furthermore, we observe that the loss
associated with the heading component leads to the least improvement, indicat-
ing that maintaining consistency in heading is a challenging task.

Visualization. In Fig. 5, we present visualizations of a few ground-truth data
and detection results from three distinct models: the baseline CenterPoint, Cen-
terPoint with 2 frames as input, and our PCL model with n = 16. In the first
row, we plot the trends in confidence scores with time changes and find the PCL
model exhibits superior capability in suppressing confidence score fluctuations
compared to the other two models. For the predicted boxes, PCL also has more
stable results than other models. It’s noteworthy that our PCL model, despite
having a lower mAP compared to the multi-frame version of CenterPoint, signifi-
cantly outperforms it in terms of SI. This further verifies that detection accuracy
and stability capture independent aspects of model performance. These phenom-
ena all demonstrate the effectiveness of PCL in enhancing detection stability.

Conclusions and Limitations
In this work, we comprehensively study a critical but overlooked issue in object
detection, i.e., detection stability. For evaluation of such stability, we carefully
design a well-proved metric named Stability Index (SI). The prediction consis-
tency learning framework is further proposed to enhance model stability. Our
extensive experiments have verified the rationality of SI and the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. We hope our work can serve as a reliable baseline and
draw the community’s attention to this crucial issue in 3D object detection.
To motivate future work, we outline a few limitations based on our current
comprehension: (1) The proposed SI focuses solely on the default detection ele-
ments for the purpose of generalization. However, some detectors yield additional
predictions such as velocity and attribute. Integrating the stability of these extra
elements into the metric, while maintaining the properties of SI, is a practically
valuable direction. (2) In the pursuit of a general baseline approach, we restrict
the design of PCL to be compatible with existing object detectors, avoiding the
introduction of extra computations during inference to ensure broad applica-
bility. Future works may surpass these constraints to explore possibilities for
enhanced performance.

In the supplementary, we first provide comprehensive analyses and theoretical
proofs for SI in Appendix A. Appendix B shows extra details of SI. In the end, we
present extensive experiments (e.g., comparisons of different metrics, analyses
on PCL, results in NuScenes benchmark, etc.) in Appendix C.
A
Theoretical Analysis
In this section, we provide detailed proofs for the proposed metric Stability
Index.
A.1
Proofs for Naive Approaches
Denote the ground-truth bounding boxes as Bg
1, Bg
2, and the predictions as
Pi = {ci, Bi}, i = 1, 2. The naive approach projects one predicted box onto the
location of the second ground truth for the calculation of IoU. In more detail, we
can project B1 onto Bg
2 as ˆB1 = TBg
1 →Bg
2 (B1) and then calculate IoU( ˆB1, B2), or
alternatively, compute it in reverse as IoU(B1, ˆB2). We next prove that the naive
approach fails to satisfy the properties of symmetry and marginal unimodality
by the following Property 1 and Property 2, respectively.
Property 1. The equality IoU( ˆB1, B2) = IoU(B1, ˆB2) does not always hold.
Proof. When considering the reverse projection, we can derive that
  \s mall  \b e gin {sp
l it}
 & \io u (
\ hat B_1
,  B_
2 ) = \ iou
 (T_
{ B_1^
g  \r
i ghtarr
o w B_2^g
} (B_
1 ), B_ 2) 
\ \ &
 = \iou (T_{B_1^g \rightarrow B_2^g}(B_1), T_{B_1^g \rightarrow B_2^g}( T_{B_2^g \rightarrow B_1^g}(B_2))) \\ & = \iou (T_{B_1^g \rightarrow B_2^g}(B_1), T_{B_1^g \rightarrow B_2^g}(\hat B_2)) \end {split} 
If IoU( ˆB1, B2) = IoU(B1, ˆB2) always hold, it will imply
  \smal l \i o u (B _1, \ha t  B_2) =
 \io
u  (\ha t B
_ 1, 
B _ 2) = \iou (T_{B_1^g \rightarrow B_2^g}(B_1), T_{B_1^g \rightarrow B_2^g}(\hat B_2)) 
This would suggest that any arbitrary projection TBg
1 →Bg
2 (·) does not alter the
IoU of two boxes.
Nevertheless, this assumption can be refuted with a straightforward example.
Imagine two adjacent squares initially possessing an IOU of 0. However, upon
rotating the squares, an intersection is formed, leading to an IOU value greater
than 0. This evident contradiction highlights that the proposition IoU( ˆB1, B2) =
IoU(B1, ˆB2) does not hold universally.
Property 2. The IoU( ˆB1, B2) is not marginal unimodal concerning the box ele-
ments.
Proof. To illustrate this, consider the following example: Let a Box be defined
{0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0}, and another Box as {δx, 0.05, 0, 3, 1, 1, δθ}. Here, we restrict
δx ∈{0, 0.25, 0.5} and δθ ∈[−10◦, 10◦]. The IoU curve between the two boxes is
shown in Fig. 6.

16
F. Author et al.
Fig. 6: The IoU curves w.r.t. the δθ variation.
Upon examining the plot, it is evident that each curve is not centered at
δθ = 0. This suggests that a less stable prediction on the box angle results in
a higher IoU. The same conclusion can be drawn for δx. Therefore, the IoU
function is not marginally unimodal.
A.2
Proofs for Stability Index
It can be readily inferred from the formulation of SI that it encompasses all
detection components and consolidates them into a unified metric (the weighted
IoU). Next, we proceed to prove the properties of Symmetry and Marginal Uni-
modality.
Property 3. The proposed Stable Index is symmetric.
Proof. The proposed score δc = 1−|c1 −c2| is symmetric, given that we take the
absolute value of the difference. Additionally, the metric essentially computes
the IoU with an intermediate pivot box, ensuring consistent values with changes
in frame order. Therefore, the final metric is symmetric.
Next, we demonstrate that the proposed metric adheres to the principle of
Marginal Unimodality. Before delving into the proof, we introduce a few lemmas.
Lemma 3. Denote the IoU value between two boxes {x1, y1, z1, l, w, h, θ} and
{x2, y2, z2, l, w, h, θ} as F(x, y, z), where x = x2 −x1, y = y2 −y1, z = z2 −z1.
Then F(x, y, z) is marginal unimodal w.r.t. x, y, z.
Proof. We can observe that the IOU value is 0 if |x| > l/2, |y| > w/2 or |z| >
h/2. Otherwise, when none of these conditions are met, we can calculate the
intersection volume as Vint = (l −|x|) · (w −|y|) · (h −|z|). This leads us to the
IOU value equation:
  \s mall F(x, y, z) = \frac {V_{int}}{2lwh - V_{int}} = 1\ / \ (\frac {2lwh}{(l-|x|)(w-|y|)(h-|z|)} - 1). z
With y and z fixed, F(x, y, z) is monotonically decreasing with x > 0 and
monotonically increasing with x < 0. Therefore, F(x, y, z) is unimodal with
respect to x when y and z are fixed. Similar conclusions can be derived for y and
z. In summary, F(x, y, z) exhibits marginal unimodality with respect to x, y, z.

Lemma 4. Denote the IoU value between two boxes {0, 0, 0, l1, w1, h1, 0} and
{0, 0, 0, l2, w2, h2, 0} as F(l, w, h), where l = l2/l1, w = w2/w1, h = h2/h1. Then
F(l, w, h) is marginal unimodal w.r.t. l, w, h.
Proof. The intersection volume of the two boxes is Vint = min(l1, l2)·min(w1, w2)·
min(h1, h2). The IoU value is then F(l, w, h) = Vint/(l1w1h1 + l2w2h2 −Vint).
Let’s first prove that F(l, w, h) is marginal unimodal w.r.t. l with w, h fixed.
We examine the reciprocal of the F(l, w, h) as
 
 \sm al l \
frac { 1 }{F(l,
 w, h)}  = \ frac {l _1w _ 1h_1+l_ 2w_ 2 h_2}{\min (l_1, l_2)\cdot \min (w_1, w_2) \cdot \min (h_1, h_2)} - 1. 
If l = l2/l1 > 1, then we can have
 
 \sm al l \
begin { split}
 \frac {1} { F(l, w,  h) }  &= \fr ac { l_
1
w_1h _ 1+l_2
w_2h_2} {\m i n (l_1,  l_ 2 )\cdot \min (w_1, w_2) \cdot \min (h_1, h_2)} - 1,\\ &= \frac {w_1h_1 + l w_2h_2}{\min (w_1, w_2) \cdot \min (h_1, h_2)} - 1. \end {split} 
Then it’s easy to derive that the first term monotonically increases with l, leading
to F(l, w, h) being monotonically decreasing with l.
Conversely, if l = l2/l1 < 1, the reciprocal of the F(l, w, h) becomes
 
 \sm al l \
begin { split}
 \frac {1} { F(l, w,  h) }  &= \fr ac { l_
1
w_1h_ 1 +l_2
w_2h_2} {\m i n (l_1,  l_ 2 )\cdot \min (w_1, w_2) \cdot \min (h_1, h_2)} - 1,\\ &= \frac {lw_1h_1 + w_2h_2}{\min (w_1, w_2) \cdot \min (h_1, h_2)} - 1. \end {split} 
Similarly, we can reach that F(l, w, h) monotonically increases with l.
In conclusion, F(l, w, h) is proven to be marginally unimodal with respect to
l with w, h fixed. This proof can be extended to demonstrate that F(l, w, h) is
also marginally unimodal with respect to w and h.
Lemma 5. If two 3D boxes are identical except for their heading values, then
their IoU is not unimodal with respect to the angle difference ∆θ. However,
within the range |∆θ| ≤π/4, the IoU is an unimodal function.
Proof. We encountered challenges in establishing a mathematical proof for this
assertion, prompting us to turn to experimental results for validation. Specifi-
cally, we generate a curve plotting the IoU against the angle difference for various
length-to-width ratios. The graph depicted in Fig. 7 serves as empirical evidence
supporting our claim.
Our Stability Index is defined as
  \ sma l l SI  = S I _c \times (SI_l + SI_e + SI_h)/3. 
(11)
The previous Lemmas 3 to 5 essentially validate the SIl, SIe, SIh is marginally
unimodal. Next, we prove that the final SI is also marginally unimodal.

Fig. 7: The IoU curves with respect to θ divergence where two boxes share the same
centers and sizes. As illustrated, when the ∆θ divergence is less than π/4, the IoU
consistently exhibits a monotonic behavior.
Property 4. The proposed Stability Index (SI) is marginal unimodal w.r.t. the
disparities of all prediction elements including the prediction score, box center,
box size and box heading.
Proof. For the SIc = max(0, 1 −|c1 −c2|/(c0.99 −c0.01)), we can easily conclude
that SIc monotonically non-decreases as the score discrepancy |c1−c2| decreases.
That means SIc is unimodal w.r.t. c1 −c2. SIl, SIe, SIh is also marginally uni-
modal according to Lemmas 3 to 5.
As SIc, SIl, SIe, SIh are all non-negative and each variable is only associated
with one of prediction score, box center, box size and box heading, it’s easy
to derive that SI = SIc × (SIl + SIe + SIh)/3 is marginal unimodal w.r.t. all
elements.
Our final proof is about the maximum value of the proposed metric:
Lemma 6. Stability Index reaches the peak value of 1 if and only if the predic-
tions are perfectly stable.
Proof. Since SIc, SIl, SIe, SIh are in the range of [0, 1], achieving SI = 1 implies
that all values are 1. This condition is met when the scores and all elements of
the bounding boxes, as transformed by the defined operations, are identical.
Conversely, if the predictions are perfectly stable, meaning that all IoUs are
1 and SIc = max(0, 1 −|c1 −c2|/(c0.99 −c0.01)) = 1, we can deduce that SI = 1.

Extra Details in Stable Index
SI essentially evaluates the stability of an object across two consecutive frames. In
the procedure of matching objects, there are two corner cases which are handled:
(1) If an object is observed and labeled in just one frame, this case is disregarded
as it doesn’t form a valid object pair. (2) If the object exists in both frames but
the Hungarian algorithm fails to find two predictions, the SI value is set to 0.
We define the consecutive frames as two frames with a time interval of ∆t. In
our implementation, we set ∆t to 0.5s. For a trajectory of length N, there will

We opt not to consider all object pairs, as we deem stability more meaningful
within the context of short time intervals. The computation of SI is efficient.
On a machine with an A6000 GPU and an 8352Y CPU, calculating SI takes ∼2
mins, much faster than computing mAP (>30 mins) and MOTA (∼12 mins).

Extra Experiments
This section presents our additional experiments.
C.1
Effects of data augmentation.
Data augmentation is a commonly used technique to enhance model robustness
against variations in the dataset. We examine whether introducing more aug-
mentation will enhance model stability. In addition to basic augmentations, we
incorporated random translation and point dropping during the training of Cen-
terPoint [48]. For each augmentation, we selected three different scales to ensure
experiment universality. The results are presented in Tab. 5.
Despite the increased augmentation scale, the changes in mAPH and SI are
marginal. Notably, the model achieves its highest stability in vehicle detection at
80.06 when randomly dropping 40% of points during training, which is only 0.29
higher than the baseline. This indicates that the application of augmentation
offers limited influences in improving model stability.
C.2
Comparisons of Different Metrics
MAP and the proposed SI are two metrics for object detectors. In the main text,
we have demonstrated that these metrics capture different properties of the de-
tection results. It’s also an interesting question how SI relates to tracking metrics
such as MOTA/MOTP, as they all somehow capture temporal information. In
this part, we provide more analyses on this question.

Stability Index and tracking metrics differ in the following aspects: (1) Track-
ing metrics primarily assess object trackers instead of directly evaluating detec-
tors. Consequently, their values can be highly influenced by the effectiveness of
the tracking modules. In contrast, SI serves as a detection metric. (2) Track-
ing metrics concentrate more on the long-term tracking performances, while
SI is designed to capture short-term properties as the stability is more mean-
ingful within the context of short time intervals. (3) Tracking metrics empha-
size whether objects are well-tracked while disregarding the inconsistency across
frames. As a result, they can exhibit different patterns compared to the proposed
SI. Fig. 8 shows some toy examples that demonstrate the lack of correlation be-
tween MOTA and SI.
We further provide experimental comparisons of these metrics, as presented
in Tab. 6. Object tracking was performed using SimpleTrack [27] with default
settings. It can been observed that there is no clear correlation between SI and
MOTA. For example, Second has a much higher SI value than CenterPoint (81.37
vs. 80.52). However, the MOTA of Second is 1.03 lower than that of CenterPoint.
Notably, PV R-CNN++ achieves the best tracking results, while lagging behind
VoxelNet and DSVT in terms of SI.

C.3
Analysis of Performance Enhancements with PCL
In addition to enhancing detection stability, our proposed PCL framework demon-
strates evident performance improvements, particularly for the vehicle class. To
delve into the reasons behind mAP boosts, we analyze object recalls under pre-
cision 0.6, as depicted in Tab. 7. It can been seen that the recalls improves
especially for the infrequent and hard objects with large length-to-width ratios.
This indicates that encouraging prediction consistency, rather than benefiting
easy cases, contributes to greater gains in hard scenarios.
C.4
The Effects of PCL on DSVT
In the main text, we apply the PCL framework to the popular CenterPoint
model [48]. To validate the generality of our PCL framework across different
detectors, we implement the PCL on the transformer-based DSVT model and
present the results in Tab. 8. If fine-tuning process without prediction consis-
tency loss, we observe a slight drop in mAP, while the SI shows a modest increase.
The overall performance of DSVT before and after fine-tuning does not exhibit
significant differences. In contrast, our PCL aids DSVT in maintaining detec-
tion performance after fine-tuning and substantially increases the SI. The SI is
boosted by 0.91, 1.36, and 0.86 for the vehicle, pedestrian, and cyclist classes, re-
spectively. These results demonstrate the efficacy and generality of the proposed
PCL framework.
The sub-indicators of the SI offer insights into the specific aspects contribut-
ing to the stability improvements. From Tab. 8,we observe enhancements in the
stability of confidence scores and box extents, while the improvements in the
stability of the other two elements are comparatively less pronounced. This phe-
nomenon diverges from the behavior observed in CenterPoint, where the stability
of all elements experiences a significant boost. One obvious explanation is that
DSVT outperforms CenterPoint in terms of detection performance. Another pos-
sible reason is that transformer-based feature extractor aligns better with the
sparse nature of point clouds compared to CNN-based approaches. Consequently,

the transformer-based model is capable of generating more stable estimations for
heading and localization.
C.5
Analysis of Offline Auto-labelling Methods
Recently, offline auto-labeling methods [17, 25, 31] have achieved exciting per-
formances, surpassing even human labels. We utilize our SI to analyze how can
these auto-labeling methods improve detection stability. In Tab. 9, the results of
a 16-frames detector before and after using CTRL [17] are presented, showcas-
ing a substantial improvement in detection stability from 89.90 to 93.38. Some
other interesting findings include: (1) Box localization and extent exhibit the
most significant stability improvements. Confidence scores also display increased
stability after the offline refinements. However, box heading shows the lowest im-
provements, indicating that heading stability is the most challenging aspect for
enhancements. (2) Heading stability is enhanced only for objects farther than
50m. This suggests that objects within 50m may already have sufficiently accu-
rate heading estimations. (3) The stability improvement is positively correlated
with object distance, aligning with intuition as there is more room for optimiza-
tion for farther objects.
C.6
Visualizations
To compare the detection stability of the baseline and PCL models more intu-
itively, we visualize a series of predictions across consecutive frames in Fig. 9.
As shown in Fig. 9, the detections predicted from the PCL model have less
fluctuation than those from the baseline model in all aspects, which further
demonstrates the effectiveness of PCL in enhancing the model stability.
