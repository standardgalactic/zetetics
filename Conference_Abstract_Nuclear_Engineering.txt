<General Introduction to Space Particle Dualism Theory> 
 
According to space particle dualism theory (SPD) every particle carries its own quantum of space, 
which is a complex 2-sphere with the radius:  
 
𝑅ℂ= 2 𝐺ℂ 𝐸
𝑐4
 
 
With:  
 
𝐺ℂ= 𝑘𝑒 𝑒2
𝑚𝑝2  
 
These quanta of space are called elementary spaces. They overlap and form our well-known three 
dimensional space. We can characterize the dimensionality of this granular space as:  
 
𝐷= 2 + (1 −1
√𝑛) 
 
With 𝑛 being the number of connections from one elementary space to other elementary spaces.  
In a first approximation 𝑛 can be estimated as:  
 
𝑛ℂ ≈ (
𝑘𝑒 𝑒2
10 𝐺|𝕐| 𝑚𝑝2)
2
 
 
More precise calculation yield:  
 
𝑛ℂ= (1
2  𝑎 𝑚𝑒

𝑙𝑃𝐿
)  
 
𝑎= 96 𝐺ℂ

𝑉𝑃 3 𝑐6  

 
 
The value of this granular dimensionality in the quantum vacuum yields:  
 
D ≈2.999999999999999999999999999999999991 
 
Which means that every difference in granular dimensionality can only appear at the 36th digit 
after the decimal point. This is why it is 1036 times weaker than electromagnetism.  
 
When placing an electron into a quantum vacuum (QV), then the virtual photons that are emitted 
by the electron cause an increase in the density of the QV and therefore the granular dimensionality 
in the surrounding space.  
If all particles are only allowed to move on the interconnected 2-dimensional surfaces of these 
elementary spaces, then regions where there are more elementary spaces have more pathways 
leading through them. That is what we call gravity.  
 
There is gravity caused by virtual photons, characterized by  
 
𝐺|ℚ|  = 𝐺|𝕐| 𝑘𝑒 𝑒2
ħ 𝑐
 
 
And gravity caused by virtual gluons, characterized by 
 
𝐺|𝕐|  = 𝐺 𝜇𝐹𝑒 (𝑚𝑝+ 𝑚𝑛)
6 𝑚𝐵𝐹𝑒
 
 
The gravitational force between two masses is accordingly given by 
 
𝐹𝐺|𝕐|  = 𝐺|𝕐|  × 
𝑛𝑞1 𝑛𝑞2
𝑟2
  =  𝐺|𝕐|  × 
|𝕐|1 |𝕐|2
𝑟2
 
 
With |𝕐| being the cardinal hypercharge, which is essentially the number 𝑛𝑞 of quarks.  
 
The gravity caused by cardinal hypercharge is infinite in reach, while the gravity caused by 
cardinal charge is only 40 meters. Beyond that the elementary spaces of virtual particles are too 
small to contribute to granular dimensionality.  
 
Evidence for a correlation between the chemical composition of test objects and the gravity 
between them has been found by various researchers, most notably by E. Fischbach, D. 
Sudarsky, A. Szafer, C. Talmadge, and S. H. Aronson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 56, 3 (1986).  
 
Speed dependent time dilation can be explained by the uniform growth of elementary spaces, 
which equals a change in the speed of light, and which is perceived as time dilation.  

 
Gravitational time dilation can be explained by the gravitational body changing the granular 
dimensionality of the background space, and thereby weakening the gravity between test objects 
within that gravitational field. This corresponds to a change in the strength of (hypercharge) gravity.  
 
All the local effects of general relativity are realized in SPD, while the problems GR causes in 
cosmology are avoided.  
In GR the vacuum energy leads to the vacuum catastrophe. In SPD this is avoided, because similar 
to the cosmology of Newtonian physics, gravity from different directions cancels out, so that the 
universe doesn’t collapse.  
In GR the chance for a flat universe is only 1 in 1062. In SPD the universe must have a flat 
geometry, because what GR interprets as space-time curvature are only differences in the density 
of granular space.  
 
Superpositioning and entanglement is explained by stating that we coexist in all worlds which are 
presently indistinguishable. The logarithm of the number of worlds is entropy.  
 
The cosmology of SPD is dominated by a concept called ‘entropic expansion’. It states that space 
expands in order to compensate the entropy increase in black holes. The entropy of a black hole 
depends on its surface area, and that is why it grows exponential.  
Accordingly the Hubble parameter at different times is given by:  
 
𝐻 = 𝐻0 − 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑡0
2
 × 𝑡2  + 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛 
 
𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛= 
𝑀𝐷𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛
2
 𝐻0
𝑀𝐷𝐻𝜇
2
 
 
With 𝑀𝐷𝐻_𝑚𝑖𝑛 being the minimal mass of dark matter black holes, which can be calculated using 
the dynamics of elementary spaces, and 𝑀𝐷𝐻_𝜇 being the present average mass of supermassive 
black holes.  
 
From this follows a time-redshift equation:  
 
𝑡 = 
3 𝑐 𝑧
𝐻0 − 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛
 − 2
3 + 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑐
 
 
For the age of the CMB this yields 𝑡𝐶𝑀𝐵= 4.4883577 × 1013 years.  
 
This can be used to calculate the abundance of dark matter in the Milky Way:  
 
𝑞𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘= 
𝑛∗ 𝑀∗𝜇
(𝑡0 𝑅∗ 𝑞𝐵𝐻 𝑀𝐵𝐻𝜇) + (𝑡0 𝑅∗ 𝑞𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡 𝑀∗𝜇)
 

 
 
𝑞𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘 =  90.36918138% 
 
This is exactly the 90% invisible matter that we know from star surveys. According to SPD all of 
what we call dark matter is ordinary matter stellar black holes and black dwarfs, while all the actual 
dark matter goes into the formation of primordial black holes that then evolve into supermassive 
black holes.  
 
Element abundance can also be shown to support the longer figure for the age of the CMB and the 
universe.
