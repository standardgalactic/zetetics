3. The origin of ENTERPRISE is the living: things who act and reactc.
4. The origin of FRICTION is the living and the unliving: things that only reactd.
5. ENTERPRISE for one may be FRICTION for others.
6. FRICTION for one may be ENTERPRISE for others.
7. ENTERPRISE may involve creating FRICTION.
8. FRICTION may involve creating ENTERPRISE. 
9. ENTERPRISE for one may involve creating FRICTION for others.
10. FRICTION for one may involve ENTERPRISE created by others.
11. Questions for ENTERPRISEe:
A) Who enterprises whom (or what)?
B) Who (or what) frictions whom (or what)?
12. ENTERPRISE filibusters such questions with a shifting mix off...
•
DEFENSE: conspires to keep enterpris
 
 ing
 
  things enterprising
•
OFFENSE: conspires to reduce friction
 
 al   things to enterprising things 
13. DEFENSE flexes more muscle than OFFENSEg:
A) DEFENSE sits on things that are...
•
already enterprising
•
barely frictional
B) OFFENSE moves on things that are... 
•
still frictional
•
barely enterprising
C) OFFENSE creates FRICTION not only for others but for itself
D) self-inflicted FRICTION makes OFFENSE feebler than DEFENSE
14. Constant DEFENSE is ultimately fatal to ENTERPRISE. ENTERPRISE'S muscle is ultimately 
offensive
H:
•
OFFENSE is the only path leading to firm and well-formed ENTERPRISE
•
DEFENSE ultimately leads to flabby and formless FRICTION
15. A target of ENTERPRISE may find itself merely a medium that ENTERPRISE passes through to 
reach some other target of enterprise.
16. The ENTERPRISE measure of a medium:
•
resistance: FRICTION faced while projecting OFFENSE through a medium
•
persistence: FRICTION faced while maintaining DEFENSE through a medium
17. Without FRICTION, ENTERPRISE would lightly prance through one enterprising thing after 
anotheri.
18. With FRICTION, ENTERPRISE could be dragged kicking and screaming through many frictional 
things after many other frictional things.
19. The first source of FRICTION is the eternal tug of war between...
•
TACITNESSj:
◦shaped by emergent conditioning

◦more enterprising than frictional
◦absolute ENTERPRISE is absolute tacitness
◦from the living
•
CONTINGENCYk:
◦shaped by random accident
◦more frictional than enterprising
◦absolute FRICTION is absolute contingency
◦from the living
◦from the unliving
•
EXPLICITNESSl:
◦shaped by intentional design
◦not entirely enterprising
◦not entirely frictional
◦from the living
20. The intensity of all this yanking back and forth falls on a continuum betweenm...
•
imbalance: one yank pulls ENTERPRISE towards one particular extreme
•
balance: two yanks in two opposite directions counter every one yank in one direction
21. ENTERPRISE conspires to reduce...
A) CONTINGENCY → EXPLICITNESS
B) EXPLICITNESS → TACITNESS
22. FRICTION conspires to grow...
A) TACITNESS → EXPLICITNESS
B) EXPLICITNESS → CONTINGENCY
23. Reducing CONTINGENCY to EXPLICITNESS or even TACITNESS may involve growing TACITNESS 
into EXPLICITNESS or even CONTINGENCY. 
24. The unfolding world outside is the gushing wellspring of CONTINGENCY. This makes it 
ENTERPRISE'S natural target even though ENTERPRISE'S usual target is ENTERPRISE.
25. The second source of FRICTION is ENTERPRISE itself.
26. ENTERPRISE may thwart its own best efforts through the FRICTION it creates.
27. Fortune may smile on ENTERPRISE in spite of, and not because of, its best efforts.
28. ENTERPRISE converts POWER into CONTROL to realize PURPOSE:
A) POWER: an opportunity for things to be enterprisingn
B) CONTROL: the certainty that things will be enterprisingo
C) PURPOSE: a sentiment about how things should be enterprisingp
29. Converting POWER into CONTROL creates FRICTION:
•
converting less POWER into less CONTROL creates less FRICTION
•
converting more POWER into more CONTROL creates more FRICTION
30. Realizing PURPOSE through CONTROL creates FRICTION:
•
realizing less PURPOSE through less CONTROL creates less FRICTION
•
realizing more PURPOSE through more CONTROL creates more FRICTION
31. This reduces ENTERPRISE to a trial of PURPOSE through the medium of POWER and CONTROLq.
32. EXPLICITNESS creates more FRICTION than TACITNESS:
A) EXPLICITNESS requires more CONTROL than TACITNESS
B) more CONTROL requires more POWER
C) converting more POWER to CONTROL reduces available POWER
D) reduced POWER constrains ENTERPRISE
E) constrained ENTERPRISE paves the way for more FRICTION

33. ENTERPRISE bludgeons ENTERPRISE from FRICTION with PARSIMONYr:
A) sense: zero-in on demand
B) extract: squeeze the workable from the raw
C) reduce: whittle the workable down to the elective
D) act: apply the elective to create supply
34. PARSIMONY bludgeons POWER from circumstance:
A) sense demand for POWER
B) extract possibility from circumstance
C) reduce possibility to POWER
D) act from POWER
35. PARSIMONY bludgeons CONTROL from uncertainty:
A) sense demand for CONTROL
B) extract flux from uncertainty
C) reduce flux to CONTROL
D) act to CONTROL
36. PARSIMONY bludgeons PURPOSE from informations:
A) sense demand for PURPOSE
B) observe
 
  knowledge from informationt
C) orient
 
  (or occasionally decide
 
 )   knowledge to PURPOSEu
D) a  ct   for PURPOSEv
37. Orientation tacitly reduces knowledge to PURPOSE by:
A) reducing knowledge to basic symbols (analysis) from the outside in (deduction) by drawing 
on cultural
 
    traditions
 
 , genetic 
 
 heritage
 
 , and previous experiencew
B) tossing out (or losing) most of the knowledgex
C) reassembling what's left over as PURPOSE (synthesis) from the inside out (induction)y
38. The dilemma of PARSIMONY:
A) take the more enterprising tacit path directly to actionz
B) take the more frictional explicit path through decision to actionaa
39. If PARSIMONY ends up taking the explicit path, decision explicitly reduces oriented PURPOSE 
even furtherab.
40. Action may turn up new information that PARSIMONY can to bludgeon into more PURPOSEac.
41. Tacit orientation extracts more PURPOSE from new information since it...
A) requires less CONTROL
B) coverts less POWER
C) creates less FRICTION
D) less FRICTION is more PURPOSE
42. Explicit decision extracts less PURPOSE from new information since it...
A) requires more CONTROL
B) converts more POWER
C) creates more FRICTION
D) more FRICTION is less PURPOSE
43. ENTERPRISE conspires to reduce...
•
explicit decision → tacit orientation
44. FRICTION conspires to grow...
•
tacit orientation → explicit decision
45. The third source of FRICTION is divergent levels of intensity between...
A) POWER → CONTROL
B) POWER → PURPOSE
C) PURPOSE → POWER

46. Intensity of POWER falls on a continuum between...
•
influence
 
  → diffuse
•
violence
 
  → concentrated
47. Intensity of CONTROL falls on a continuum betweenad...
•
diversity
 
  → diffuse
•
conformity
 
  → concentrated
48. Intensity of PURPOSE falls on a continuum betweenae...
•
limited
 
  → diffuse
•
absolute
 
  → concentrated
49. The fourth source of FRICTION is wildly divergent aggregations of:
•
tacit POWER, CONTROL, or PURPOSE
•
contingent POWER, CONTROL, or PURPOSE
•
explicit POWER, CONTROL, or PURPOSE 
50. The fifth source of FRICTION is ENTERPRISE unfolding as four parallel waves at once:
•
TACTICS: interacts with targets of ENTERPRISE
•
STRATEGY: squares POWER with PURPOSE
•
POLITICS: divides POWERaf
•
CULTURE: biases PURPOSE
51. Every wave beyond TACTICS is merely an accumulation of TACTICS.
52. Not all TACTICS are strategic but all STRATEGY is tactical: STRATEGY squares POWER with 
PURPOSE by accumulating tactical interactions.
53. STRATEGY only builds up ENTERPRISE by accumulating tactical interactions that yieldag:
A) POWER to square POWER with PURPOSE
B) CONTROL over squaring POWER with PURPOSE
C) PURPOSE through squaring POWER with PURPOSE
54. TACTICS wrestles with strategic problems that STRATEGY reduces to tactical problemsah.
55. STRATEGY is an approximate squaring of ENTERPRISE'S division of POWER with its bias of 
PURPOSE, not an exact fitai.
56. Neglect of POWER by STRATEGY leaves PURPOSE unrealizable:
A) no POWER, no CONTROL
B) no CONTROL, no PURPOSE
57. Neglect of PURPOSE by STRATEGY reduces ENTERPRISE to a jumble of meaningless tactical 
interactions.
58. Not all STRATEGY is political but all POLITICS is strategic: POLITICS divides POWER by 
accumulating strategic squarings.
59. POLITICS only builds up ENTERPRISE by accumulating strategic squarings that yield:
A) POWER to divide POWER
B) CONTROL over the division of POWER
C) PURPOSE through the division of POWER
60. STRATEGY wrestles with political problems that POLITICS reduces to strategic problems.
61. Maximizing an absolute division of POWER will rarely spur on ENTERPRISE. On the other hand, 
maximizing a relative division of POWER will often spur on ENTERPRISE. 
62. ENTERPRISE is exquisitely sensitive to fluctuations in relative POWER since...
•
the greatest predator of ENTERPRISE is ENTERPRISE
•
the most dangerous ENTERPRISE is the nearest ENTERPRISE
63. There is not enough POWER under heaven to realize every PURPOSE under heaven:
•
POWER is limited
•
PURPOSE is unlimited

64. This minor unpleasantry often reduces ENTERPRISE'S division of POWER to ENTERPRISE'S 
struggle over POWERaj.
65. ENTERPRISE'S struggle over POWER is ultimately ENTERPRISE'S struggle over violent POWER. 
66. ENTERPRISE is fundamentally biased toward maximizing its POWER to convert violence into 
CONTROL to realize PURPOSE.
67. Not all POLITICS is cultural but all CULTURE is political: CULTURE biases PURPOSE by 
accumulating political divisions of POWER.
68. CULTURE only builds up ENTERPRISE by accumulating political divisions of POWER that yield:
A) POWER to bias PURPOSE
B) CONTROL over biasing PURPOSE
C) PURPOSE through biasing PURPOSE
69. POLITICS wrestles with cultural problems that CULTURE reduces to political problems.
70. CULTURE is the art of the unspoken assumption: it conspires to say what's important, in what 
order it's important, and to make that order tacit.
71. Tacit bias is a feature, not a bug: if ENTERPRISE had to constantly and explicitly bias the 
selective half-truths, wishful thinking, half-remembered anecdotes, random trivia, maternal 
homilies, typographical errors, outright lies, misconceived slogans, innocent omissions, and 
clerical tidying that make up CULTURE, it would quickly exhaust all of its POWER.
72. ENTERPRISEak congeals around four parallel aggregators of waves of ENTERPRISE:
•
TRIBE: congeals around TACTICS
•
INSTITUTION: congeals around STRATEGY
•
MARKET: congeals around POLITICS
•
NETWORK: congeals around CULTURE
73. TRIBES coalesce from underlying NETWORKS into new INSTITUTIONS.
74. To complete the bootstrap from tribal jello to institutional brick, TRIBES must accumulate 
enough POWER through MARKETS.
75. New INSTITUTIONS coalesce around particular strategic orientations that aggregate POWER, 
CONTROL, and PURPOSE with TACITNESS, CONTINGENCY, and EXPLICITNESSal.
76. Institutional OFFENSE is the exception and not the rule: it comes with a real risk of institutional 
FRICTIONam.
77. Institutional DEFENSE is the rule and not the exception: it comes with all the benefits of already 
being enterprisingan.
78. This imbalance gradually tilts INSTITUTIONS towards devoting more and more of their POWER to 
defensive optimizationao.
79. This is self-defeating: unless countered by at least some institutional OFFENSE, institutional 
DEFENSE will become increasingly punctuated by institutional FRICTION.
80. Institutional FRICTION can build to such a crescendo that institutional crisis and even 
institutional collapse can ensueap.
81. Compensating for growing FRICTION, INSTITUTIONS shift from the more efficient tacit path of 
institutional orientation to the less efficient explicit path of tribal decisionaq. 
82. This shift is driven byar...
•
demands of the moment
•
bias towards investing in specialized TACTICS at the expense of generalized STRATEGY
•
need to protect tribal ENTERPRISE by erecting defensive barriers against challengers
•
habit conditioned by immersion in a particular TRIBE
83. Instead of reducing FRICTION, INSTITUTIONS shifting from the TACIT and strategic to the explicit 
and tactical grows FRICTION.
84. Tactical trivia grow exponentially while strategic big pictures grow linearly because knowledge 

encouragingas:
A) specialization, division, and disintegration grows at an exponential rate while...
B) generalization, unification, and integration grows at a linear rateat
85. The culminating point of ENTERPRISE made possible by an INSTITUTION'S original orientation is 
reachedau:
•
low-hanging fruit is picked clean
•
out-of-reach fruit isn't worth the ENTERPRISE needed to pick them
86. As FRICTION grows, INSTITUTIONS begin to...
•
desperately cultivate explicit or tactical trappings leftover from its original orientation
•
neglect tacit, contingent, or strategic essence that it was founded onav
87. Some TRIBES within failing INSTITUTIONS increasingly divert POWER from institutional 
ENTERPRISE towards their tribal ENTERPRISESaw. 
88. Other TRIBES go further and opt out of institutional ENTERPRISE entirely, seeking relief from 
growing institutional FRICTION in purely tribal ENTERPRISEax.
89. Crisis at hand, INSTITUTIONS disintegrate into fractious and unharmonious TRIBES as FRICTION 
consumes the last dying embers of its original orientationay.
90. Survivors of failing INSTITUTIONS don't know how their INSTITUTIONS arose and don't know 
how their INSTITUTIONS failedaz:
•
sense EXPLICITNESS 
•
barely sense TACITNESS 
•
can't fathom CONTINGENCY
91. While crisis is a heavy and blunt object that can remedy this dangerous disorientation, collapse 
is the heaviest and bluntest object of allba.
92. Definition of institutional crisis and collapsebb: uneven distribution of orientation within an 
INSTITUTION'S underlying NETWORKS.
93. NETWORKS may revive failing INSTITUTIONS by shifting their orientations in new directions.
94. NETWORKS may spawn new INSTITUTIONS from the TRIBES they connect even if earlier 
INSTITUTIONS they spawned collapsed.
95. The FRICTION that future INSTITUTIONS spawned by a NETWORK can endure may ratchet 
upwards if...
A) enough institutional orientation survives in the NETWORK after institutional crisis or collapse
B) institutional orientation is more evenly distributed across the NETWORK
