Cosmic inﬂation, a period of accelerated expansion in the early universe, can give rise to large
amplitude ultra-large scale inhomogeneities on distance scales comparable to or larger than the
observable universe. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy on the largest angular
scales is sensitive to such inhomogeneities and can be used to constrain the presence of ultra-large
scale structure (ULSS). We numerically evolve nonlinear inhomogeneities present at the beginning of
inﬂation in full general relativity to assess the CMB quadrupole constraint on the amplitude of the
initial ﬂuctuations and the size of the observable universe relative to a length scale characterizing
the ULSS. To obtain a statistically meaningful ensemble of simulations, we adopt a toy model in
which inhomogeneities are injected along a preferred direction. We compute the likelihood function
for the CMB quadrupole including both ULSS and the standard quantum ﬂuctuations produced
during inﬂation. We compute the posterior given the observed CMB quadrupole, ﬁnding that when
including gravitational nonlinearities, ULSS curvature perturbations of order unity are allowed by
the data, even on length scales not too much larger than the size of the observable universe. To
demonstrate the robustness of our conclusions, we also explore a semi-analytic model for the ULSS
which reproduces our numerical results for the case of planar symmetry, and which can be extended
to ULSS with a three-dimensional inhomogeneity structure. Our results illustrate the utility and
importance of numerical relativity for constraining early universe cosmology.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Cosmic inﬂation, a postulated era of accelerated expansion in the early universe, has become an integral part of
modern cosmology; but while inﬂation provides a dynamical mechanism to produce the initial conditions for the
standard hot Big Bang cosmology, the initial conditions for inﬂation itself are far more uncertain.
Cosmological
measurements are bounded by the cosmological horizon, placing fundamental limits on our direct knowledge of the
universe on arbitrarily large scales. However, many inﬂationary models — for example, those including “eternal”
inﬂation [1, 2] or starting from inhomogeneous initial conditions — lead to a rich and complicated structure on ultra-
large scales compared to our own local Hubble volume. It is thus of great interest to look for ways to probe this
structure using “local” measurements of the observable universe.
In this work we study the eﬀects of nonlinear inhomogeneities present at the beginning of single-scalar ﬁeld inﬂation
on the quadrupole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation observed today, a phenomenon known as
the Grischuk-Zel’dovich (GZ) eﬀect [3]. Because pre-inﬂationary physics primarily aﬀects the largest scales of the
observable universe, the CMB quadrupole is the most important observable in this context. Previous studies of the GZ
eﬀect (e.g., Refs. [4, 5]) neglect the impact of gravitational nonlinearities, basing their inferences on linear cosmological
perturbation theory and Gaussian statistics. In this context, the expected imprint of primordial inhomogeneities on
the CMB quadrupole shrinks exponentially with an increasing number of inﬂationary e-folds. However, the large
gravitational nonlinearities studied in this scenario could plausibly lead to signiﬁcant non-Gaussianity and departures
from linear perturbation theory, which in turn aﬀect our inferences about ultra-large scale structure (ULSS) from the
CMB quadrupole. While it is true that even in the highly non-linear regime not all realizations of inﬂation will give
rise to observable ULSS (e.g. because some regions undergo many e-folds of inﬂation), our primary goal is to sharpen

the connection between pre-inﬂationary physics and cosmological observables to determine precisely which scenarios
can be ruled out from observation.
The potential importance of gravitational nonlinearities motivates the fully general relativistic numerical treat-
ment that we undertake in this work. For computational eﬃciency, we assume primordial inhomogeneities are only
present along a preferred spatial direction, allowing for one-dimensional simulations. The model is speciﬁed by the
inﬂationary potential, and by the spectral shape and amplitude of primordial inhomogeneities in the inﬂaton ﬁeld.
Using exquisitely accurate numerical techniques, we evolve realizations of these pre-inﬂationary ﬂuctuations well into
the post-inﬂationary regime using mere seconds of computing time, while maintaining convergence to the level of
machine precision. This numerical eﬃciency allows us to sample many realizations of the initial conditions to build
up a statistical description of observables in our model.
For three qualitatively diﬀerent choices of the inﬂationary potential, we vary the initial ﬂuctuation amplitude and
build up a set of probability distributions over the locally observed ℓ= 2 CMB multipole, a20, at diﬀerent spatial
positions. We ﬁnd that independent of the inﬂationary model, and under a variety of physically plausible weighting
schemes for spatial positions, nonlinear gravitational eﬀects yield a highly non-Gaussian distribution for a20. We
then fold into our calculation the standard smaller-wavelength vacuum ﬂuctuations generated by inﬂation, to obtain
the probability distribution of power in the observed CMB quadrupole. The relative contribution of the ULSS and
vacuum ﬂuctuations is controlled by a variable that maps primordial length scales to present-day length scales.
We compute the full posterior over the initial ﬂuctuation amplitude and mapping parameter, comparing with what
would have been obtained if gravitational nonlinearities had not been taken into account. We conclude it is essential
to accurately model gravitational nonlinearities to make accurate inferences about ULSS from measurements of the
CMB quadrupole. Based on a semi-analytic extrapolation of our results, we expect similar qualitative conclusions
to hold in the case where no symmetry assumptions are made, and we comment on the broader implications of our
result to this more realistic scenario. More generally, our results motivate a systematic study of the inﬂuence of strong
gravity in the early universe on cosmological observables.
Our results ﬁt within the broader context of numerical relativity as a cosmological tool [6–18]. While much of this
previous work focused on the relativistic dynamics of either the pre-inﬂationary or matter-dominated Universe, this
work is among the ﬁrst to self-consistently connect initial conditions to cosmological observables.

Large- and small-ﬁeld models can be related to the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio through the Lyth bound [20].
The α attractor models conveniently interpolate between large-ﬁeld inﬂation at α ≫1 and small-ﬁeld inﬂation at
α ≪1. Current limits favor intermediate and small-ﬁeld models [21]. We analyzed three representative models:
α →∞(equivalent to a quadratic inﬂationary potential [22]), α = 2/3 (similar to Starobinsky’s R2 inﬂation [23],
where α = 1), and α = 2/300 (where inﬂation occurs on a ﬂat plateau). In all three cases we found qualitatively
similar behavior. To illustrate the basic phenomenology, we present results for α = 2/300 below.
We assume our spacetime possesses two spatial translation isometries and choose a synchronous gauge with metric
ds2 = −dτ 2 + a2

.

The full set of evolution and constraint equations resulting from Einstein’s equations are presented in Appendix A.
We introduce the ﬁeld momenta Πφ ≡a∥˙φ (with ˙φ ≡∂τφ) and the extrinsic curvatures Kxx and Kyy. We also deﬁne
H2
I ≡V (¯φ(τ = 0))/3M 2
P, where ¯φ(τ = 0) is the average value of the ﬁeld on the initial conditions surface τ = 0.
Below, we measure ﬁelds in terms of MP.
We choose the coordinates x, y, and z to measure proper distance on the initial spatial slice, corresponding to
a∥(τ = 0, x) = a⊥(τ = 0, x) = 1. The initial conditions for each simulation can then be speciﬁed entirely in terms of φ
and Πφ. Once these are given, we solve the momentum constraint for Kyy, and ﬁnally substitute into the Hamiltonian
constraint to obtain an algebraic equation for Kxx.
We take the scalar ﬁeld on the initial surface to be φ(τ = 0, x) = ¯φ + δ ˆφ(x) and Πφ(x) = ¯Πφ = 0. The mean ﬁeld
¯φ is set to obtain 60 e-folds of inﬂation in the homogeneous slow-roll approximation. The normalization V0 is set to
match the amplitude of scalar power measured by the Planck satellite [24]. The ﬂuctuations δ ˆφ(x) are drawn from a

The evolution equations are solved numerically from the initial pre-inﬂationary hypersurface through several post-
inﬂationary e-folds of expansion. Using the numerical techniques described in Appendix A, we are able to achieve
machine-precision accuracy with run times on the order of seconds. We use this numerical eﬃciency to explore four
orders of magnitude in Aφ, running 100 realizations of the Gaussian initial conditions at each amplitude.

EXTRACTING COSMOLOGICAL OBSERVABLES
The CMB quadrupole as viewed from each location in the simulation is determined by the comoving curvature
perturbation ζend at the end of inﬂation, along with the cosmological redshift to the end-of-inﬂation hypersurface.
There are a variety of methods to ﬁnd ζend [10, 25, 26]. Here we follow the δN formalism [27, 28] and compute

evaluated on the same hypersurfaces. It also proves convenient to consider only the spatial ﬂuctuations in ζ, so we
further deﬁne
δζ ≡ζ −¯ζ
(6)
with analogous deﬁnitions for δζ∥and δζ⊥. ¯ζ = ⟨ζ⟩is an average taken over the constant H surface with each grid
site weighted equally. For the adiabatic perturbations we study here, δζ freezes out within a few e-folds of the start

of our simulations, so that ¯ζ is a function of H alone and δζ is a function of x alone. The squared proper distance

(7)
where H′ ≡∂xH is evaluated with respect to synchonous spatial coordinates at ﬁxed τ. The hypersurface on which
inﬂation ends is deﬁned by the ﬁrst occurrence of ϵH ≡−d ln H/d ln a = 1 at each spatial position. After a short
transient, ϵH is a function of H alone. Therefore, ζend corresponds to the particular choice ζ(Hend). Note that ζ
quantiﬁes the overall expansion of a local packet of geodesics, so variations in the value of ζ as a function of position
encodes the comoving curvature perturbation.
As outlined in Appendix B, the Taylor series coeﬃcients of ζend around each point x0 along the end-of-inﬂation
hypersurface are related to the properties of a set of locally-deﬁned nearly homogeneous patches, which can in turn be
related to the observed CMB at each position. The constant term in the expansion ζend(x0) is the natural logarithm of
the local scale factor, which is not directly observable. The ﬁrst derivative term also produces no observable signatures,
since pure gradients in the gravitational potential are pure gauge in linear perturbation theory [5, 29]. The leading
observable is therefore the quadratic term in the expansion, which maps onto a CMB quadrupole through the Sachs-
Wolfe and Integrated Sachs-Wolfe eﬀect. For the situation we focus on, this truncated expansion encapsulates all
observable eﬀects of ULSS.
In appropriate coordinates, only the m = 0 mode of the ℓ= 2 CMB temperature anisotropy is non-zero. Along
a ﬁxed H slice, the physical size of the last scattering surface Rls is independent of position, so it is convenient to
approximate a20 by evaluating ζ at the physical position of the last scattering surface for each position x0

The derivatives are taken with respect to dimensionless coordinates ¯x = HIx. Here F is a constant dimensionless
factor encoding order unity projection coeﬃcients, a correction from both the early and late time Integrated Sachs-
Wolfe eﬀect, and a conversion from proper distance along the end-of-inﬂation hypersurface to comoving distance at
last scattering. Lobs = e−¯ζRls is the comoving radius of the surface of last scattering, and HI is deﬁned above. The
ﬁnal approximation assumes (H′/a∥˙H)2 ≪1, which is valid when the local Hubble expansion rate varies only on
scales much larger than the local Hubble horizon.
Due to uncertainties in the post-inﬂation expansion history which depend on the details of (p)reheating, the combi-
nation LobsHI is a free parameter. We have chosen our conventions such that in the homogeneous limit, LobsHI = 1 is
the necessary condition for solving the horizon problem, which translates into the observable universe being descended
from a single causally-connected domain at the beginning of inﬂation of physical size H−1
I
. In the small-amplitude
limit, H−1
I
translates into the local comoving scale of inhomogeneity. For the case of strong inhomogeneity, this
identiﬁcation is lost due to the strong spatial variations of the local scale factor on the end-of-inﬂation hypersurface.
IV.
SIMULATION RESULTS
For each simulation, we extract the locally-observed CMB quadrupole Eq. 8 at each grid site from ζend. Additionally,
we must assign a probability (or weight) to an imaginary observer at each grid point. We consider two weighting
schemes: comoving volume weighting where each grid point is weighted equally, and physical volume weighting where
each grid point is weighted by the total growth in physical volume during inﬂation (e3ζend(x)/⟨e3ζend(x)⟩). Because
each coordinate position x labels a geodesic, our simulation coordinates naturally preserve comoving volume (see also
Ref. [30]). Empirical PDFs are created by binning the a(UL)
20
samples by their assigned weights.
Several representative PDFs for the small-ﬁeld model of inﬂation (α = 2/300) are shown in the left panel of
Fig. 1. The PDFs for the comoving volume weighting scheme are denoted by solid lines and those for physical volume
weighting by dashed lines. Note that the PDFs in Fig. 1 are normalized to their variance; un-normalized distributions
would have a variance that increases with Aφ, spanning 8 × 10−2 < σ(UL)
20
≲1013 for 10−6 ≤Aφ ≤10−3.
As expected, for small Aφ the distribution is Gaussian. In this regime, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the weighting schemes. As Aφ is increased, gravitational nonlinearities become more important, with variations in ζ
becoming order unity for Aφ ≳2 × 10−4 in the small-ﬁeld model. In this same limit, the PDFs gain a more pronounced
non-Gaussian shape, primarily in the form of an increasing kurtosis. The PDFs also develop a sharp maximum at
positive values for a(UL)
20
, indicating a bias towards peaks in ζ over troughs, as well as a non-zero mean. The emergence
of a peak in the distribution oﬀset from the origin and the breaking of reﬂection symmetry about the origin arises

5
primarily from our assumption that the ULSS is planar symmetric, which breaks statistical isotropy. This can be seen
explicitly by comparing Fig. 1 and Fig. 6. For very large amplitudes, the distribution becomes very sharply peaked
about a(UL)
20
= 0.
In the highly nonlinear regime, most of the volume of the end-of-inﬂation surface descends from regions which have
experienced a larger amount of inﬂation than in the homogeneous limit (see also Refs. [31, 32]). This explains the
emergence of a peak at positive values in the a(UL)
20
PDF, as regions that inﬂate more are biased to be peaks rather
than troughs.1, which breaks statistical isotropy. In the statistically isotropic case, it is the spatial curvature that
develops a positive valued peak the same reason; see Sec. VII. It also explains the limiting form of the PDF, since for
most of the volume on the reheating surface, inhomogeneities would have been blown up to extremely large scales.
As a consequence, both weighting schemes produce similar results as illustrated in Fig. 1. The primary diﬀerence
is that the amplitude Aφ at which non-Gaussianities become apparent is lower for the volume weighting scheme.
Similarly, this is also the main diﬀerence between choices of inﬂationary potentials, where the threshold Aφ at which
the a(UL)
20
distribution becomes non-Gaussian increases as α is increased. This is simply a reﬂection of the increased
sensitivity to initial condtions of small-ﬁeld models compared to large-ﬁeld models [33].
To facilitate a comparison of the predictions of our toy model with the observed CMB angular power spectrum, we
combine the eﬀects on a20 of ULSS and the standard inﬂationary quantum ﬂuctuations that give rise to structure on
sub-horizon scales. The observed CMB quadrupole is constructed from the sample variance ˆC2. In our toy model, a
particular realization yields

the Planck satellite [24]. A more realistic scenario would have ULSS contributions to all 5 of the a2m in addition to
a contribution to the locally-observed spatial curvature; we explore a toy model where this is the case below.
In the right panel of Fig. 1, we show the predicted probability distribution over ˆC2, generated by drawing realizations
ˆC2 (Eq. 9) while ﬁxing the variance of a(UL)
20
to be 4 times larger than that of a(Q)
20 . For comparison, we show the
PDF over ˆC2 in the absence of ULSS (a χ2 distribution with 5 degrees of freedom). We will comment brieﬂy on this
in Section VII.
Surprisingly, Fig. 1 shows that for ﬁxed relative RMS, larger initial amplitudes Aφ become increasingly indistin-
guishable from the case of no ULSS contribution. At the level of Eq. 9, this is because the width of the peak in the
PDF is much smaller than the variance of the distribution, and nearly all a(UL)
20
draws come from the vicinity of the
peak very near zero.
V.
SEMIANALYTIC APPROACH TO ULSS QUADRUPOLE
Before turning to the observational constraints associated with the ULSS quadrupole, we ﬁrst outline a semi-analytic
approximation for the distribution of the temperature quadrupole a(UL)
20
in the ULSS. This explicitly demonstrates
the role of the local volume expansion in determining the qualitative behaviour of the distribution (and thus the lack
of constraining power for large initial ﬁeld ﬂuctuation amplitudes). Furthermore, the approach can be extended to
the full three-dimensional problem without relying on a (computationally infeasible) Monte Carlo sampling of ﬁeld
conﬁgurations using three-dimensional numerical relativity simulations. A derivation of the appropriate mapping
between the locally observed quadrupole moments/spatial curvature and the curvature perturbation in the case with
no assumption of planar symmetry is presented in Appendix B.
Identifying a∥≃a⊥≃eζ(x0), the general result Eq. B6 agrees with Eq. 8 to leading order in ∆ζ as deﬁned in
Appendix Eq. B4, yielding
a(UL)
2m (x0) ∝−(HILobs)2 e−2ζ(x0)ζ′′(x0) δm,0 .
(10)
Here, ′ represents a spatial derivative with respect to the spatial coordinates along a ﬁxed Hubble slice. Within
this approximation, the goal of numerical simulations is reduced to the determination of joint one-point probability

distributions for the local values of ζ and ζ′′. As is clear from the derivation in the Appendix, the reduction from the
full ﬁeld statistics to a few one-point distributions occurs because of the superhorizon nature of the perturbations.
In Fig. 2 we show normalized distributions of these two quantities as extracted from our numerical simulations,
assuming comoving volume weighting. Remarkably, we observe that the one-point distributions of ζ and its derivatives
are well-approximated by Gaussians, even in the non-linear regime (σζ ≳1). Furthermore, (ζ∥−ζ), which measures the
anisotropic expansion (equivalently, the deviation of ¯γij from the identity matrix), is small throughout the simulation
volume. Since we have
γij = e2ζdiag

e−2(ζ−ζ∥), e(ζ−ζ∥), e(ζ−ζ∥) 
(11)
this justiﬁes our approximation a∥≃a⊥≃eζ(x0) above so that we can take ¯γij ≈δij as in Appendix B.
As shown in Fig. 3, the emergence of a large peak around the origin in ˆa(UL)
20
is associated with large positive
ﬂuctuations in ζ, which act to increase the local scale of the ULSS relative to the physical size of the last scattering
surface. This eﬀect is evident from the exponential prefactor in Eq. 10. Further, if instead of comoving volume
weighting, we weight by the total volume expansion from the initial condition hypersurface, the eﬀect will be to
upweight the values of ˆa(UL)
20
in the peak around the origin, resulting in the emergence of the peak at smaller values
of Aφ, exactly as we observed previously. The above observations suggest we model ζ(x) as a Gaussian random ﬁeld,
and furthermore approximate ζ∥= ζ. To the order of approximation used in this section, ˆa(UL)

where P(k) = ⟨|˜ζk|2⟩is the power spectrum of ζ(x) in synchronous spatial coordinates on ﬁxed H slices.
The
¯σi’s parametrize the shape of the power spectrum, while σ0 modulates the amplitude of the ζ ﬂuctuations. The
determination of the distribution of ˆa(UL)
20
has thus been reduced to a determination of three numbers. In the more
general planar symmetric case we have a∦= a⊥̸= a, leading to a nontrivial unit determinant spatial 3-metric ¯γij. To
full second order in spatial derivatives, a(UL)
20
becomes a function of six correlated random deviates ζ, ζ′, ζ′′, ζ∥, ζ′
∥, and
ζ′′
∥. For example, assuming ζ∥= ζ, the approximation used in Eq. 8 also requires information about ζ′. We will not
pursue this semi-analytic extension here, since we veriﬁed that for the simulations presented in this paper, including
additional nonlinear corrections induced only small changes in the empirically derived PDFs for a(UL)
20
.
Figure 4 illustrates the a(UL)
20
distributions predicted by the simple Gaussian model for the ULSS. For illustration,
we have ﬁxed the shape parameters ¯σ1 and ¯σ2 to constants, while adjusting the overall amplitude of the spectrum
P(k). We veriﬁed that for the range of Aφ and kcut used in our simulations, this is a reasonable approximation for
the dynamically generated ULSS ζ ﬁelds.

OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
The CMB quadrupole obtained using the Commander approach2 on Planck 2015 data is ˆCobs
2
= 253.6 µK2. The
central value lies near the lower 95% conﬁdence level bound of the best-ﬁt ΛCDM model in the absence of ULSS.
This arguably anomalously low value for the CMB quadrupole has received note since the ﬁrst full-sky measurements
of the CMB angular power spectrum by the COBE satellite [34]. Our model does not alleviate this issue.

. In this decomposition, the value of Aφ enters into our ﬁnal posterior both
through the shape of a(UL)
20
as encoded in a(UL)

/σ(UL)
20
(such as those shown in Fig. 1) and through the relation
between R and (HILobs)2 whose Aφ dependence is carred by ⟨(¯a(UL)
2m )2⟩.
In computing the posterior, we assume uniform priors on log10 Aφ and log10 HILobs in the ranges −6 ≤log10 Aφ ≤
−3 and −5 ≤log10 LobsHI ≤0. The upper bound on log10 Aφ corresponds to the point where our numerics break
down (well into the nonlinear regime), and the upper bound on log10 HILobs is the value required to solve the horizon
problem. Note that the model without ULSS is at Aφ = LobsHI = 0, which maximizes the posterior.
In Fig. 5, we also show contours (dashed lines) for the posterior generated under the assumption that the ultra-large
scale a(UL)
20
are drawn from a Gaussian distribution of equal variance to the numerically derived non-Gaussian PDFs.
This is an extrapolation of Gaussian ﬂuctuations into the non-linear regime. As expected, for small Aφ where the
PDFs are approximately Gaussian, there is good agreement. However, the posterior has far more weight than the
Gaussian case when Aφ ≳10−4.4, where ζ ﬂuctuations are order unity. As a result, when considering the marginalized
posterior for the initial ﬂuctuation amplitude Aφ, the cutoﬀthat appears at large Aφ in the Gaussian case disappears
as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 5. Therefore, it is relatively more diﬃcult to constrain ULSS in the nonlinear
regime.
Comparing the posterior generated for the diﬀerent models of inﬂation and diﬀerent weighting schemes, we obtain
functions qualitatively similar to that shown in Fig. 5. In physical volume weighting, the deviations from the Gaussian
model arise at relatively smaller values of Aφ and larger values of HILobs. This can be traced back to the onset of
non-Gaussianities in a(UL)
20
at smaller values of Aφ for physical volume weighting (see Fig. 1). For large-ﬁeld and
intermediate models of inﬂation, the onset of deviations from the Gaussian model arise at larger values of Aφ and
smaller values of HILobs than for the small-ﬁeld model. Therefore, while the precise constraints from the posterior
depend on the inﬂationary potential and weighting scheme, the result in Fig. 5 is qualitatively robust.

completely changes the nature of our inferences at large Aφ. To illustrate the robustness of this conclusion to our prior choice,

distributed in the range [−5, log10(Lcut)] with varying choices of log10 Lcut ∈{−4, −3, −2, −1, 0}. Darker shades correspond to
larger values of log10 Lcut.
VII.
EXTENSION TO THREE DIMENSIONS
We now brieﬂy outline how the approach above may be extended to three dimensions, but leave the use of three-
dimensional numerical relativity simulations to verify the validity of these approximations to future work. As above,
we assume that ζ is the dominant gravitational degree of freedom. As described in Appendix B, in the Sachs-Wolfe
approximation and to linear order in the local derivatives of ζ we have
a(UL)
2m
∝−(HILobs)2 e−2σζ ˆ
G0 ˆG2m ,
(17)
where there are now 5 diﬀerent random deviates ˆG2m which arise as various linear combinations of the components of
the Hessian of ζ. For statistically homogeneous and isotropic ULSS, we have ⟨ˆG0 ˆG2m⟩= 0 and ⟨ˆG2m ˆG2m′⟩∝δm,m′.
Nontrivial correlations between these variables arise from the breaking of statistical isotropy, an explicit example of
which is given for the case of planar symmetric ﬂuctuations above. To full second order in the gradient expansion,
an additional function of ζ and (∂iζ∂jζ)2 (which is multilinear in the ∂iζ∂jζ’s) can appear. However, since this is a
nonlinear correction in the local perturbation ∆ζ (see Eq. B4), it requires determining photon transport properties
beyond linear perturbation theory, which we will not pursue here.3 The important feature for the analysis we presented
above is the presence of the e−2ζ multiplier, which leads to the emergence of a strong peak in the a2m distribution
around zero as before. As well as the CMB quadrupole, we can estimate the locally measured value of Ωk using Eq. B7
and Eq. B8:
Ωk ≈−e−2ζ
6H2

 4∇2ζ + 2(∇ζ)2
,
(18)
where ∇2ζ is a Gaussian random deviate and (∇ζ)2 a χ2 deviate with three degrees of freedom in the Gaussian
random ﬁeld model for ζ.
3 Such terms arise, for example, if the naive Sachs-Wolfe approximation is altered by evaluating ζ at the true physical distance to the last
scattering surface, rather than the physical distance measured in the locally deﬁned FRW background. Furthermore, they are generated
by the coordinate transform that removes the gradient term in the Taylor expansion of ζ.

In Fig. 6, we show distributions for a(UL)
2m
generated from Eq. 17 (left panel) and for Ωk from Eq. 18 (right panel),
as we scan the variance in δζ while holding ⟨(∂n
i ζ)2⟩/σ2
ζ ﬁxed. These normalized variances can be related to various
moments of the power spectrum through the three-dimensional generalization of Eq. 14. As in the case of planar
symmetry, the distribution over a(UL)
2m
becomes sharply peaked around zero as the amplitude of ﬂuctuations increases,
with similar qualitative features also occurring in the distribution of the spatial curvature. Therefore, we can predict
that in the three dimensional scenario, measurements of the quadrupole and spatial curvature lead to relatively weaker
constraints on ULSS in the non-linear regime than would be expected by extrapolating the linear result.
As well as the potential application to three-dimensions, the analysis in this section demonstrates the robustness of
our observation that large amplitude initial ﬂuctuations δφ in spatially ﬂat gauge cannot be constrained by the CMB
quadrupole. In particular, the loss of constraining power in the planar symmetric scenario arises from the formation
of the sharp peak in the a20 distribution at a20 = 0. However, we demonstrated this peak forms from the resulting
large amplitude ﬂuctuations in ζ, which themselves arise from ﬂuctuations in the initial location of the ﬁeld on the
potential. For superhorizon perturbations, this correspondence between ζ and δφ ﬂuctuations will be independent
of the spatial dimension, and therefore the qualitative conclusions reached in this work should continue to hold in
the higher dimensional setting. Similarly, the choice of local volume weighting of observers will further decrease the
constraining power of the quadrupole, as the regions that have inﬂated longer (and thus have pushed the local ULSS
to the largest scales which are unobservable) will be preferentially weighted.
VIII.
CONCLUSIONS
We have studied a toy model in which ultra-large scale structure (ULSS) is generated from the nonlinear evolution of
large amplitude inhomogeneities in the initial conditions for inﬂation in a single spatial direction. By enforcing O(60)
e-folds of inﬂationary expansion in the homogeneous limit, we consider the most optimistic scenario for observable
dynamically-evolved ULSS in single-ﬁeld inﬂation. In this setting, we have found a non-Gaussian probability distri-
bution over the imprint of ULSS on the CMB quadrupole. We ﬁnd that in cases where inﬂation is not completely
disrupted, large amplitude pre-inﬂationary ULSS is allowed by current data over a wide range in mapping scales
HILobs. The expectation from Gaussian statistics and linear cosmological perturbation theory is that increasingly
large amplitude pre-inﬂationary ULSS requires an increasingly large number of inﬂationary e-folds, and hence a small
mapping scale HILobs, to not make a large contribution to the CMB quadrupole. Our results are at odds with this
expectation, since increasingly large amplitude pre-inﬂationary ULSS is completely consistent with increasingly large
mapping scales HILobs. In this sense, inﬂation does a better job of hiding its initial conditions than you would expect
based on linear theory and Gaussian statistics.
Qualitatively, based on a semi-analytic model, we have argued that these conclusions are expected to hold in a
more realistic scenario where primordial inhomogeneities have no assumed symmetries. In a crude approximation, we
expect that the contribution to a2m from ULSS for each m is drawn from the non-Gaussian distributions similar to

11
those in Fig. 6, which are qualitatively similar to those of our toy model. The contribution from ULSS to the spatial
curvature would be drawn from an analogously non-Gaussian distribution, making it less likely to observe spatial
curvature than in previous computations that neglect gravitational nonlinearities [35, 36].
More generally, this work illustrates the novel possibility of applying the tools of numerical relativity to formulate
precise tests of early universe physics. As we reach the limit on accessible information about the primordial universe,
precise tools for making theoretical predictions are essential for extracting the most information from the limited
observations that are possible to make.

Both the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints should be zero for exact solutions to Einstein’s equations. Numer-
ically, we require that they remain as small as possible.
The evolution equations are solved numerically using a 10th order Gauss-Legendre time integrator [37, 38] and a
Fourier collocation-based spatial discretization [39]. As expected, the code displays exponential convergence with spa-
tial resolution (once all spatial structure is resolved) and tenth order convergence with temporal resolution. Adaptive
time-stepping is used to capture the relevant dynamical time scale, which varies by orders of magnitude during a
single run. We also reﬁne our grid as necessary to ensure we properly capture all spatial structure as the ﬁelds evolve
in time. Through this combination of precision numerical methods, we are able to evolve a single ﬁeld realization
through 60 e-folds of inﬂation and several post-inﬂationary e-folds of ﬁeld oscillations in order 1-10 seconds (dependent
on Aφ) on a single core. All dynamical ﬁelds are resolved to machine precision, with a similar accuracy in constraint
preservation. This numerical eﬃciency allows us to explore a range of amplitudes Aφ spanning between four and six
orders of magnitude (dependent on the choice of α), running 100 realizations of the Gaussian initial conditions at
each amplitude.
Appendix B: Extraction of Local Observables in the Local Linear Approximation
In this Appendix we brieﬂy outline an approach for extracting local CMB observables from numerically generated
spacetimes possessing complex superhorizon structure. For superhorizon perturbations in a synchronous coordinate
system during inﬂation, we have to leading order in the gradient expansion (assuming general relativity)
ds2 = −dτ 2 + e2ψ(x,τ)¯γij(x)
det¯γij = 1 .
(B1)
The time-independence of ¯γij arises from the rapid damping of the trace-free part of the extrinsic curvature, which
drives temporal variations in ¯γij. Re-slicing our spacetime so that our time-coordinate is deﬁned by surfaces of constant
H = −1
3Ki
i = ∂τψ and leaving the spatial coordinates unchanged X(x) = x, the metric in the new coordinate system
is

(B3)
This provides the deﬁnition of ζ¯γ(x, H), which has the important virtue of being of the form ζ¯γ(x, H) = ζ¯γ,0(H) +
δζ¯γ(x), when the wavelength of the ﬂuctuations δζ is larger than the horizon. Since synchronous coordinates are not
uniquely deﬁned, we have indicated this through the ¯γ subscript on ζ¯γ. After a short transient, we veriﬁed numerically
that this freezeout does indeed occur.
We now assume that ζ¯γ is the dominant gravitational degree of freedom, so that we can choose a synchronous
coordinate system Eq. B1 with ¯γij = δij. Denote ζ¯γ in this coordinate system by ζ. We also drop the subdominant
correction e−2ζ¯γ ∂iH∂jH
˙H2
correction.
All cosmological observables are then encoded in ζ.
Since we consider only
superhorizon perturbations, at each point x0 we want to approximate our spacetime as a local FRW. We therefore
Taylor expand
ζ(x0 + δx) ≈ζ(x0) + δx · ∇ζ + δxiδxj
2
∂2ζ
∂xi∂xj
+ O(∇3) ≡ζ(x0) + ∆ζ(δx|x0) = ¯ζ + δζ(x0) + ∆ζ(δx|x0) .

Provided we restrict ourselves to positions within the local Hubble horizon, each term beyond the ﬁrst one will be
small, and we can treat them as linear perturbations to a locally deﬁned background FRW spacetime with locally
deﬁned scale factor a(H|x0) = eζ(x0,H). Working to linear order in ∇ζ and ∂ijζ, the eﬀect of ∇ζ can be removed via
a coordinate change, and we can use the Sachs-Wolfe approximation to obtain the angular dependence of the CMB
temperature ﬂuctuations
δT
TCMB
(θ, φ|x0) ≈−1
5∆ζ(δxls(x0), Hls|x0) ,
(B5)
where δxls is the location of the last scattering surface and Hls is the Hubble rate at last scattering. This approximation
is derived within linear perturbation theory around a homogeneous FRW spacetime, and therefore to be consistent
we assume that r2
ls ≡P
i δx2
i,ls has no angular dependence. Importantly, rls does depend on the observer location
x0 through the spatial dependence of ζ(x0), which leads to substantial deviations from the expectations based on
linear perturbation theory. Beyond linear perturbation theory in each local FRW spacetime, one may expect that rls
acquires angular dependence (for example, if we evaluate ζ at the true physical distance to the last scattering surface).
This induces additional corrections involving (∆ζ)2 and higher order gradients to our results below. However, as we
will show below, the dominant eﬀect on the qualitative behaviour of a(UL)
2m
arises solely from the x0 dependence of rls,
and therefore these corrections will not remove the loss of constraining power for large amplitude initial ﬂuctuations
Aφ.
Carrying through the calculation outlined above, we ﬁnd to linear order in the synchronous derivatives of ζ
a(UL)
2m (x0) ∝−e−2δζ(x0) ˆG2m ∝−e−2σζ ˆ
G0 ˆG2m ,
(B6)
where ˆG0 and ˆG2m are (possibly correlated) random deviates determined by the statistics of the underlying ﬁeld ζ.
In particular, ˆG2m are given by various linear combinations of the trace-free part of the Hessian for ζ resulting from
the projection onto spherical harmonics at ﬁxed rls. This expression is only correct to linear order in the derivatives
of ζ, not to second order in the gradient expansion. In particular, an extra function of (∂xζ)2 can appear (even
within the approximation ¯γij = δij). A proper calculation of this eﬀect requires moving beyond the derivation of the
Sachs-Wolfe eﬀect in linear perturbation theory, and will be presented elsewhere. Similarly, the local value of the
intrinsic curvature of the constant H slices is
(3)R ≈−e−2ζ  4∇2ζ + 2(∇ζ)2
.
(B7)
Assuming ¯γij = δij + ¯hij can be treated perturbatively in ¯hij, Eq. B7 is correct to second order in spatial derivatives.
Rather than deal directly with the intrinsic curvature of the slices, it is convenient to instead consider
Ωk =
(3)R
6H2
0
(B8)
which is identical up to an overall constant. Although not precisely the same, this quantity will be closely related
to the quantity identiﬁed as spatial curvature in cosmological observations, as it directly enters into the Hamiltonian
constraint, which is the inhomogeneous generalization of the Friedmann equation.
