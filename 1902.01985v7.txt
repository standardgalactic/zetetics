J. POLIHRONOV
Abstract. This article examines the Bouton-Lie group invariants of the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE)
for incompressible ﬂuids. Bouton’s theory is applied to the general scaling transformation admitted by the
NSE and is used to derive all self-similar solutions. In light of these, the criticality of the standard NSE
system is examined and criticality criteria are derived. The theorem of Beale-Kato-Majda is used to rule
out blow-up for a subset of Bouton’s self-similar solutions. For a subset of Leray’s self-similar solutions,
the cavitation number of the ﬂuid is found to be a scale-invariant, conserved quantity. By extending the
analysis of Bouton to higher-dimensioned manifolds, additional conserved quantities are found, which could
further elucidate the physics of ﬂuid turbulence.
1. Introduction
Global regularity of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) is subject of intense research.
The present article adds to this eﬀort a study of the symmetry properties of the NSE by following the
example of a similar work on the general linear diﬀerential equation (GLDE, given below) by Charles
L. Bouton [3]. We present the work of Bouton on the GLDE and then apply his analysis to the NSE.
Following the reasoning of Bouton, we examine the invariants of the NSE with the purpose to draw
conclusions about the solutions and their properties.
The NSE is given by
ρ
∂⃗u
∂t + (⃗u · ∇)⃗u

=
µ∆⃗u −∇p
∇· ⃗u
=
0
⃗u(x, y, z, 0)
=
⃗u0(x, y, z)
(1.1)
We suppose initial conditions ⃗u0 in the Schwartz class [8]. Here ⃗u(x, y, z, t) = (u, v, w) is the velocity,
µ = ρν is the dynamic viscosity, ν is the kinematic viscosity, ρ = const is the ﬂuid density and p(x, y, z, t)
is the pressure.
Conjecture 1.1. The NSE global regularity conjecture [8] is the assumption that given the above ini-
tial conditions, there always exists a solution ⃗u(x, y, z, t), p(x, y, z, t) which remains smooth of class C∞
throughout IR3 and for all t ≥0:
⃗ui(x, y, z, t) ∈C∞(IR3 × [0, ∞))
p(x, y, z, t) ∈C∞(IR3 × [0, ∞))
i = 1, 2, 3; u1 = u, u2 = v, u3 = w,
as well as has bounded energy

The NSE assumes continuous ﬂuid and thus its velocity exists at inﬁnitely small points. This presents
diﬃculty, because despite that the total kinetic energy is conserved, the scaling properties of the NSE
prevent it from being able to control the solution at very small scales. This opens the possibility for
scaling induced blow-up and the solution may no longer be smooth after some ﬁnite time. If it can be
demonstrated that the solution can remain smooth this will further justify the choice of Navier and Stokes
to model a ﬂuid as a continuous medium and will show that the matematics of their equation always has
physically meaningful solutions.
We set about to work towards this goal by studying the symmetry properties of the NSE. Parallel
work was completed on the GLDE by Charles L. Bouton as early as 1899 [3]. Bouton examines in detail
Lie’s invariants of the GLDE. His is one of the earliest works where a diﬀerential equation is thoroughly
studied with Lie’s theory of continuous groups. Due to its comprehensive analysis, Bouton’s article can
be considered foundational in invariant theory [17]. Historically, the theory of point transformations and
Lie groups has been a well-known tool for the study of diﬀerential equations [6]. These techniques are now
widely used in the analysis of PDEs and are found in the textbooks [16]. To the author’s best knowledge,
they have not been applied previously to study existence and smoothness of the solutions of diﬀerential
equations and are used to this end here for the ﬁrst time.
This article is organized as follows: in the ﬁrst section, we present the work of Bouton on the GLDE;
then, we apply his analysis to the NSE. We use the most general scaling transformation, as published by
Ercan-Kavvas [7], wherein the viscosity ν is allowed to scale-transform. Bouton’s self-similar solutions are
derived by applying his ﬁrst theorem. Next, we re-examine NSE criticality based on the derived solutions.
We show that, under the general scaling transformation, the energy of the standard NSE system is no
longer supercritical and can be critical or subcritical. Criticality criteria are derived and shown to be
governed by a 5/2 law. Using the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion [1], we then argue that scaling induced
blow-up will not take place when the NSE problem is energy-subcritical. Bounded energy is shown to
follow from the same line of reasoning.
As a next step, we examine the scaling transformation where the viscosity ν is not allowed to transform
but is kept ﬁxed at all length scales. Here, Bouton’s theory leads to the self-similar solutions of Leray
[7], [4]. The aforementioned solutions of Bouton in the case of this transformation are non self-similar
polynomials. We also show that for a subset of Leray’s solutions we can derive a scale-invariant, conserved
quantity, namely Euler’s or, cavitation number of the ﬂuid.
In the last sections, we employ Cartan’s calculus in order to show that Bouton’s ﬁrst theorem is but
the ﬁrst of nine steps in the diﬀerential geometry analysis of the NSE. In each stage, the Lie derivatives
of diﬀerential forms are set to zero along the ﬂows of the inﬁnitesimal operators admitted by the NSE
and are solved as a system, which yields their common invariants.
By virtue of Bouton’s theorems,
selected invariants are shown to be conserved quantities. Seven such conserved quantities are found; they
are diﬀerential forms on manifolds, associated with the ﬂow of liquids. Their role as conditions on the
pressure and velocity of the ﬂuid in turbulent ﬂows is discussed.
2. Bouton and the GLDE
Charles Leonard Bouton is an American mathematician who has conducted a detailed study of the
invariant properties of the GLDE [3]. We begin by quoting relevant paragraphs from Bouton’s article on
the GLDE [3]; we start at §13. The GLDE is given by
y(n) + na1y(n−1) + n(n −1)
2
a2y(n−2)... + any = 0,
where as and y are functions of x alone and a0 ≡1. Also given is the point transformation
x1
=
χ(x)
y1
=
yψ(x).
(2.1)
known as ﬁnite transformation. Following Bouton’s notation, x1 and y1 are the transformed variables; χ
and ψ are arbitrary analytical functions.

§13: A diﬀerential equation is said to admit a point transformation, if this transformation leaves the
equation unchanged, or, transforms it into an equation of the same form. The transformation (2.1) is the
most general point transformation the GLDE is known to admit. Next, Bouton introduces the following
deﬁnitions:
Deﬁnition 2.1. An absolute invariant/covariant I of the GLDE is a function of the coeﬃcients as and
their derivatives. It remains unchanged upon transformation (2.1), I1 = I. Invariants do not contain the
dependent variable y or its derivatives; covariants do (as per §26). Bouton probably introduces the term
covariant, since the dependent variable y co-varies with as. I may contain the independent variable x.
Deﬁnition 2.2. A relative invariant/covariant R (as per §38) of the GLDE is a function of the coeﬃcients
as and their derivatives. Upon ﬁnite transformation (2.1) R transforms according to the rule R1 = fR;
f is known as the factor of ﬁnite transformation. Invariants do not contain the dependent variable y or
its derivatives; covariants do (as per §26). R may contain the independent variable x.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Deﬁne Isobaric weights (§15): [y(µ)]ν has weight µν; [a(j)
i ]l has weight (i + j)l.
Bouton begins deriving the invariants of the GLDE as early as chapter 2 and continues in chapters 4
and 5. He uses the method of inﬁnitesimal transformations by solving the equation
(2.2)
XI = 0,
where X is the symbol/operator of inﬁnitesimal transformation, corresponding to the ﬁnite transfor-
mation (2.1). Equation (2.2) represents the necessary and suﬃcient condition for I to be an absolute
invariant/covariant of the GLDE. In (2.2), X is not only an operator of the geometric transformation
(2.1), but is also extended [2] to include terms from the GLDE in itself: X = X(x, y, χ, ψ, as, a(j)
i , y(µ)).
§15: Write the arguments of the absolute covariant I (they are the same for the relative covariant R):
I = I(x, y, y′, y′′, ..., y(µ), a1, a2, ..., a(j)
i , ...).
§14,§15: Consider the two scaling transformations
x1 = x
x1 = Cx
y1 = Cy
y1 = y
y(µ)
1
= Cy(µ)
y(µ)
1
= C−(µ)y(µ)
ψ = C
ψ = 1
χ = x
χ = Cx
C = const.
(2.3)
Since these are included in (2.1) they inﬂuence the properties of all relative invariants and covariants R
of the GLDE. When R transforms, it must be according to the law R1 = fR. Therefore, R must be an
integral rational function (IRF), isobaric of weight W and homogeneous of degree λ.
§14, §15: The scaling transformations (2.3) also determine the properties of all absolute invariants and
covariants I of the GLDE. In order to have I transform as I1 = I, it follows that I must be an IRF of
weight zero and also homogeneous of degree zero. Bouton thus arrives at the following theorem:
Theorem 2.4. (of Bouton): Any absolute invariant/covariant of the GLDE for the group of transforma-
tions (2.1) must be homogeneous in the y(µ)’s of degree zero and isobaric in the y(µ)’s and a(j)
i ’s of weight
zero. Any relative invariant/covariant R must be homogeneous in the y(µ)’s of degree λ and isobaric in
the y(µ)’s and a(j)
i ’s of weight W. We write this as R(λ,W ).
Corollary 2.5. The transformation of a function is determined by the transformable entities within its
functional form. This is seen in the reasoning of Bouton by the way he calculates isobaric weights and
powers of homogeneity. Under ﬁnite transformation, the function I(x, y, y′, y′′, ..., y(µ), a1, a2, ..., a(j)
i , ...)
will transform according to how its individual arguments would transform within the functional form I.
The same is true for the relative invariants/covariants R.

Corollary 2.6. In the most general case, the factor of the relative invariants/covariants of the GLDE is
f = ψλ/χ′W (see eq.(2.1)).
Corollary 2.7. Due to the requirements for isobarity and homogeneity, IRFs are the only functions
arising in this study of invariants. In the particular cases when the denominator is constant, the IRF is
a homogeneous, isobaric polynomial (e.g. y(12) + (y′′′)4 + (y′′)6).
3. Bouton and the NSE
The ﬁnite transformations and their corresponding inﬁnitesimal group operators which leave the NSE
invariant have been studied and published extensively in the literature. They were derived in 3-dimensional
space by Lloyd [13]: the NSE admits time translations, scale changes and rotations (details provided in
later chapters), the ﬁnite scaling transformation being
(x′, y′, z′)
=
k(x, y, z)
t′
=
k2t
(u′, v′, w′)
=
(1/k)(u, v, w)
p′
=
(1/k2)p,
0 < k < ∞,
k = const,
(3.1)
where primed quantities are transformed quantities; we no longer use the index “1” to denote transforma-
tion. We omit the admitted groups that are not Lie groups. The NSE does not admit any other groups
[13]. According to recent work by Ercan and Kavvas the general scaling transformation admitted by the
Navier-Stokes equation is [7]:
(x′, y′, z′)
=
kαx(x, y, z)
t′
=
kαtt
ρ′
=
kαρρ
(u′, v′, w′)
=
kαx−αt(u, v, w)
p′
=
kαρ+2αx−2αtp
ν′
=
k2αx−αtν
g′
i
=
kαx−2αtgi, i = 1, 2, 3
0 < k < ∞,
k = const
(3.2)
and if αt = 2, αx = 1 with gravitational acceleration gi = 0, we arrive at the scaling transformation (3.1).
In the general case (3.2), all three spatial variables transform with the same scaling exponent αx and all
three velocity components transform with the same scaling exponent αx −αt; αx and αt are arbitrary
real numbers.
In this work, we set gi = 0. Also, we set “p” to stand for p/ρ and thus the ﬁnite transformation for
p in (3.2) will become p′ = k2αx−2αtp. If the NSE is dimensionalized, ν must scale-transform since it is
a dimensional constant (ν has dimension) and may be thought of ν = x2
0/t0. In the nondimensionalized
NSE the coeﬃcient ν no longer denotes viscosity, but the reciprocal value of the Reynolds number Re−1;
if Re is not allowed to scale, (3.2) still applies as long as αt = 2αx. However, as we will see later, Leray’s
self-similar solutions are the solutions of the nondimensionalized NSE and their self-similarity is due to
scaling invariance; obviously all variables in the nondimensionalized NSE are unitless and yet allowed to
scale. We will therefore examine in more detail both cases for the viscosity ν: (1) ν is allowed to scale;
(2) ν is kept ﬁxed at all length scales. Analogously with Bouton’s deﬁnitions of the preceding section, we
introduce
Deﬁnition 3.1. An absolute invariant/covariant I of the NSE is a function of the independent variables
x, y, z, t. I is such that upon transformations (3.1)-(3.2) it remains unchanged, I′ = I. Invariants do not
contain the dependent variables u, v, w, p or their derivatives; covariants do.

Deﬁnition 3.2. A relative invariant/covariant R of the NSE is a function of the independent variables
x, y, z, t. R transforms according to the rule R′ = fR upon transformation (3.1)-(3.2); f is the transfor-
mation factor. Invariants do not contain the dependent variables u, v, w, p or their derivatives; covariants
do.
Deﬁnition 3.3. Deﬁne weights as follows:
W(xa) = W(ya) = W(za)
=
aαx
W(tb)
=
bαt
W(ua) = W(va) = W(wa)
=
(αx −αt)a
W(pb)
=
2(αx −αt)b
W(νc)
=
(2αx −αt)c.
When variables are multiplied, their weights are added.
Consider the ﬁnite scaling transformation: the relative invariants and covariants R of the NSE must
transform according to the law R′ = fR. From Corollary 2.6 of Bouton, Deﬁnition 3.2 and from eqs.
(3.1)-(3.2) it follows that here f = kq. If αt = 2, αx = 1 the relative covariants R = u, R = v and R = w
yield f = k−1, while the relative covariant R = p yields f = k−2. Corollary 2.5 of Bouton states that
under ﬁnite transformation the dependent variables (the jet-space variables, or relative covariants) u, v,
w and p transform the same way as the relative invariant functions u(x, y, z, t), v(x, y, z, t), w(x, y, z, t)
and p(x, y, z, t). To ensure that their factor f is correct upon scaling transformation, they must be IRFs;
they must be isobaric of their respective weight in the x, y, z and also in t. Note that as in Corollary 2.7
of Bouton, IRFs are the only functions arising in the study of the invariants of the NSE. Whenever the
denominator of the IRF is constant, the invariant is an isobaric polynomial, e.g. R(2,−2) = u2 + v2 + w2.
All presented reasoning in this section therefore sums up in the following theorem:
Theorem 3.4. (of Bouton): To meet all isobarity requirements of their scaling transformation, the relative
invariant functions u(x, y, z, t), v(x, y, z, t) and w(x, y, z, t) must be isobaric in x, y, z and t of weight
W = αx −αt; while the relative invariant function p(x, y, z, t) must be isobaric in x, y, z and t of weight
W = 2(αx −αt). The Navier-Stokes system of PDEs becomes:
∂⃗u
∂t + (⃗u · ∇)⃗u

ν∆⃗u −∇p

(⃗r · ∇)p + t αt

=
2(αx −αt)
αx
p.
(3.3)
Here, ⃗r = (x, y, z) is the position vector. The added equations represent Bouton’s isobarity conditions.
Corollary 3.5. The transformation of a function is determined by the transformable entities within its
functional form. This is seen in the reasoning of Bouton by the way he calculates isobaric weights and
powers of homogeneity. Under ﬁnite transformation, the function I(x, y, z, t) will transform according to
how its individual arguments would transform within the functional form I. The same is true for the
relative invariants ⃗u(x, y, z, t), p(x, y, z, t).
Corollary 3.6. Under the general scaling transformation (3.2), the factor of the relative invariants/covariants
of the NSE is f = kαx−αt for the velocity and f = k2(αx−αt) for the pressure.
Corollary 3.7. Due to the requirements for isobarity (and also homogeneity, see later chapters), IRFs
are the only functions arising in this study of the invariants of the NSE. In the particular cases when the
denominator is constant, the IRF is an isobaric polynomial, for ex. (t3/t4
0)(x + z + (y2/t4
0)); t0 = const.

4. When Viscosity is allowed to scale
To ﬁnd Bouton’s self-similar solutions we apply Theorem 3.4; with the symbolic package Maple [14],
the added equations of Bouton can be integrated to yield:

(4.1)
These expressions are the self-similar solutions of the PDE system (3.3); they are isobaric IRF’s due to
the scaling invariance of the NSE. The general form (4.1) is a necessary condition that all self-similar
solutions must meet.
As the NSE models a ﬂuid continuum, solutions will exist at increasingly small scales.
We need
to address the possibility of scaling-induced blow-up, where mechanical energy may be stored within
inﬁnitely small volume while maintaining energy conservation. The NSE problem may be supercritical,
critical or subcritical depending on how its conserved quantities scale when the solution is subjected to a
scaling transformation [18]. As an example, take the energy in the case αt = 2, αx = 1 for the NSE in D
dimensions: the rescaling that preserves the equation is given in (3.1)
⃗u(x, y, z, t) →1
k⃗u
x
k , y
k , z
k, t
k2

,
while the energy is an integral of |⃗u|2 and thus the rescaling that preserves the energy is given by
⃗u(x, y, z, t) →
1
kD/2⃗u
x
k , y
k, z
k, t
k2

,
thereby showing that for the NSE in D = 3 dimensions energy is being rescaled more severely; this
ampliﬁes the rescaling at small scales k ≪1 [18]. Thus, the case αt = 2, αx = 1 is energy-supercritical
in 3-D. Similar procedure for establishing criticality is found in [19]; suppose X is a conserved quantity;
then, if λ is a scaling coeﬃcient,
(a) the PDE is X-critical, if X′ = X ∀λ (scale-invariant);
(b) the PDE is X-subcritical, if X′ diminishes as λ increases (λ > 1);
(c) the PDE is X-supercritical, if X′ increases as λ increases (λ > 1).
To ensure meaningful physics of the ﬂuid at t = 0 and throughout IR3, we formulate the following
lemma for Bouton’s self-similar solutions (4.1):
Lemma 4.1. Bouton’s self-similar solutions (4.1) can be nonzero and smooth at t = 0 if and only if they
are in the form
⃗u
=

,
(4.2)
where C and C are constants and the remaining terms are isobaric polynomials.
Proof. Bouton’s self-similar solutions are in the form (4.1). Based on the symmetry properties of the
NSE, we will assume that isobaric solutions (i.e. those that scale-transform according to (3.2)) always
exist. To this assumption, we add the Conjecture (1.1), namely that our chosen solution is smooth at
t = 0 in order to guarantee meaningful value of the initial energy. Smoothness of (4.1) at t = 0 requires
(αx −αt)/αt > 0 and (αx−αt)/αx > 0, that is, smoothness of the arbitrary functions F and F everywhere
in IR3 and for t = 0. If t is a factor in (4.1) however, even though smooth, such solution is trivial as it is
identically zero when t = 0; and since there is no forcing term in the NSE, eq.(1.1), the ﬂuid system would
be left with a total energy of zero, because its sole energy source is the initial velocity of the system. For
this reason, we add the arbitrary isobaric functions P and P (they are still in the isobaric form (4.1)),
which must themselves be smooth everywhere in IR3:

Regarding smoothness at t = 0: F and F must be smooth in (IR3 × 0); however, they are IRFs and as
such must be either isobaric polynomials, or the ratio of such polynomials (note that such polynomials
cannot contain constant terms since they do not have isobaric weight). Suppose they are a ratio of isobaric
polynomials; then their denominators must be nonzero at t = 0. However, at t = 0 their denominators
must be isobaric polynomials of only x, y, z which are always zero at least at the origin. This is a contra-
diction with the requirement of smoothness. Therefore, F and F must be isobaric polynomials. However,
it is impossible to build a smooth polynomial by using the arguments xi/t(αx/αt); since multiplying or
adding them always leads to discontinuities in either IR3 (esp. at the origin) or at t = 0. Similarly, F
and F cannot be closed-form functions of the given arguments, since the arguments are discontinuous in
(IR3 × 0). Therefore, the only remaining option is that they are constants.
Regarding the smoothness of x
αx−αt
αx
P and x
2(αx−αt)
αx
P: in order for the remaining terms to be smooth
in IR3 (as per the requirement of smoothness at t = 0), they must be isobaric polynomials. They cannot
be IRFs, since their denominators will be polynomials with roots at the origin, etc. They cannot be
closed-form functions, since their Taylor series will be either isobaric but discontinuous at least at the
origin, or not isobaric. Finally, it is evident that (αx−αt)/αx > 0 is mandatory to ensure smoothness.
□
Therefore, according to Lemma 4.1, if the self-similar solution is to be smooth and nonzero at t = 0,
the following condition must be true:
αx −αt
αt
> 0,
that is, the power index of t must be positive; and it is the stronger requirement in comparison to the
requirement of the power index of x being positive. Lemma 4.1 leads to the following corollaries
Corollary 4.2. The power index of both t and of x in (4.2) is positive if
αx > αt and αt > 0, thus αx > 0; or
αx < αt and αx < 0, thus αt < 0.
Corollary 4.3. The power index of x in (4.2) is positive if
αx > αt and αx > 0 or
αx < αt and αx < 0.
Regarding the existence of our chosen solutions: we begin by assuming that the NSE has solutions,
smooth in (IR3 ×0); this is the essence of Conjecture 1.1 and it is done to ensure the ﬂuid has ﬁnite initial
energy. We can also assume our chosen solutions are nonzero at t = 0, because the initial velocity and
pressure are the energy source of the system.
The NSE admits the scaling transformation (3.2).
Suppose all NSE solutions that scale-transform
according to (3.2) are discontinued at t = 0. Such supposition would be incorrect (e.g., see the initial
solution for the Taylor-Green vortex, eq.(12) in [20]). We will therefore suppose, that based on Conjecture
1.1, the NSE always has nonzero solutions, smooth in (IR3 × 0); and based on the scaling symmetry of
the NSE we will also assume that some of these solutions scale-transform according to (3.2). Then, they
must be in the form (4.2), according to Lemma 4.1.
Theorem 4.4. Bouton’s self-similar solutions (4.1) of the NSE in 3D have global in-time regularity as
long as they are energy-subcritical, smooth at t = 0 and nonzero at t = 0.

J. POLIHRONOV
Proof. We begin by considering all of Bouton’s self-similar solutions (4.1). To keep the NSE invariant
under scaling transformation, the velocity and energy transform as
⃗u′
=
kαx−αt⃗u,
E′
=
k5αx−2αtE.
The energy E at a given moment t, would be scale-invariant if ⃗u transformed according to the law
⃗u′ = k−3
2αx⃗u.
Compare the transformations kαx−αt⃗u and k−3
2αx⃗u; we have three cases to consider:
αx −αt
<
−3
2αx
αx −αt
>
−3
2αx
αx −αt
=
−3
2αx.
The three cases are compared whether they increase or decrease u for small scales k →0. We arrive to a
5/2 law governing the criticality of the NSE:
αt
αx
> 5
2
subcritical, when αx > αt, αx < 0, αt < 0,
subcritical, when αx < αt, αx > 0, αt > 0;
(4.3)
αt
αx
< 5

The case αx = 1, αt = 2 yields αt/αx = 2 < 5/2, supercritical. We omit the possible combinations
that involve αx = 0 since in them the x, y, z coordinates do not rescale. Now we will use the provisions
of Conjecture 1.1 and will limit our study only to those self-similar solutions of Bouton, that are not
equivalent to zero and are smooth in (IR3 × 0). Such solutions will have the form (4.2); the corollaries of
Lemma 4.1 show the conditions that need to be met.
Proposition 4.5. According to Corollary 4.3, to have solutions smooth in x we need αx > αt, αx > 0,
irrespective of the sign of αt. This is a supercritical case by virtue of (4.4). If αt > 0, the solutions are
smooth in t, according to Corollary 4.2.
Proposition 4.6. According to Corollary 4.3, we may also have solutions smooth in x, as long as αx <
αt, αx < 0, irrespective of the sign of αt. This is a subcritical case by virtue of (4.4). If αt < 0, the
solutions are smooth in t, according to Corollary 4.2.
Proposition 4.7. According to Corollary 4.2, to have solutions smooth in both t and x we need αx >
αt, αt > 0, αx > 0; this is a supercritical case by virtue of (4.4), irrespective of the sign of αt.

Proposition 4.8. According to Corollary 4.2, we may also have solutions smooth in both t and x, as
long as αx < αt, αt < 0, αx < 0; this is a subcritical case by virtue of (4.4).
Consider the solutions of Proposition 4.8; they are energy-subcritical and smooth in (IR3 × [0, ∞)).
Suppose they are diverging at some time t ∈(0, T]. According to the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion [1],
Z T

sup|∇× ⃗u|dt = ∞;
⇒∃t : |∇× ⃗u| = ∞;
⇒∃i : ∂⃗u

where i = 1, 2, 3 and x1 = x; x2 = y; x3 = z. Suppose this is induced solely by rescaling, that is, a smooth
solution of the NSE begins to diverge due to the scaling invariant properties of the equation,

the index 1 denotes transformation). At ﬁne scales, k →0 and therefore it must be true that
αt > 0,
which is a contradiction, since according to Proposition 4.8, our chosen solutions require αt < 0.
□
Therefore, rescaling does not lead to the blow-up of our chosen solutions. This can be shown even
for the supercritical cases. Consider the supercritical cases of Propositions 4.5, 4.7. These solutions are
discontinued at t = 0, but are smooth everywhere else. The proof in Theorem 4.4 applies here as well
(excluding the point t = 0), since again αt < 0. Since our chosen solutions are isobaric polynomials in
x, y, z and t, the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion conﬁrmed that their smoothness in (IR3 × [0, ∞)) cannot
lead to divergence through rescaling.
5. Bounded Energy
Consider the energy of the ﬂuid for the general scaling (3.2); the energy balance is given by [21]

The total energy will remain ﬁnite through energy conservation: we are guaranteed that ⃗u0 ∈C∞(IR3)
and expect both the Rhs and Lhs to be ﬁnite, as long as the energy is subcritical as per Theorem 4.4
which ensures that the velocity does not diverge anywhere in IR3 and for ∀t.
6. The Second Law
The question has been posed as to whether the second law of thermodynamics may be violated by
ordering the system through rearranging of its energy [18]. The NSE (1.1) models an incompressible,
isothermal ﬂuid; it is therefore isentropic, while energy arrangements such as raising E in one place while
decreasing it in another would mean a decrease in entropy. This is forbidden by deﬁnition as the entropy
of the ﬂuid is S = Caverage ln T = const because T = const. The possible change in entropy therefore
pose a physical problem rather than a mathematical one. In attempting to deﬁne T for a continuous
medium we recognize that the isothermal, incompressible NSE which models continuous medium does
not contain enough physics in order to guarantee S = const. Rather, it will be assumed for now that

10
J. POLIHRONOV
entropy does not change the same way this is assumed for the temperature. We will consider this as an
a priori imposed condition on the ﬂuid system rather than a corollary.
In comparison, energy conservation in the ﬂuid system is expected to hold from a physics’ standpoint; it
can be approached mathematically as well, since the ﬁrst vectorial equation within the NSE imposes con-
servation of momentum, which would guarantee that energy will be conserved. However, no mathematical
condition on the temperature is imposed in the NSE (1.1) and thus T cannot be controlled mathematically
and it can be only supposed that the second law of thermodynamics would not be violated.
7. When Viscosity does not scale
In this section, we will work with the scaling transformation (3.1), where the viscosity ν is kept at the
same value at all length scales. This is the case αx = 1, αt = 2 (or, αt = 2αx) in (3.2). Bouton’s theorem
(3.4) yields Leray’s self-similar solutions [5]

(7.1)
In the literature, Jean Leray [12] is credited with noticing that due to its scaling invariance the NSE
admits the so-called self-similar solutions [7], [4] eε⃗u(eε(x, y, z), e2εt), e2εp(eε(x, y, z), e2εt), where ε ≥0
[9]. According to Bouton’s Theorem 3.4 for the NSE, Leray’s self-similar solutions are the only possible
self-similar solutions which the scaling transformation (3.1) can generate. They are undeﬁned at t = 0
or at the origin etc., resulting in divergence of the ﬂuid energy at the initial moment or at the origin
etc. (contrary to the provisions of Conjecture 1.1). Analogous reasoning applies to the general scaling
transformation (3.2) with αt = 2αx, where again the solutions have ﬂuid energy undeﬁned at t = 0 or at
the origin/along the axes.
Continuing our study of the case of non-scaling viscosity αt = 2αx, we note that Bouton’s theorem
(3.4) can be changed to take units, or dimensionalization, into account:
Theorem 7.1. (of Bouton): In the case αt = 2αx, in order to meet all isobarity requirements of their
scaling transformation, the relative invariant functions u(x, y, z, t), v(x, y, z, t) and w(x, y, z, t) must be
homogeneous in x, y, z of degree 1 and homogeneous in t of degree -1; while the relative invariant function
p(x, y, z, t) must be homogeneous in x, y, z of degree 2 and homogeneous in t of degree -2. The Navier-
Stokes system of PDEs becomes:
∂⃗u

The added equations represent Bouton’s conditions of homogeneity. They yield a set of solutions, which
are a subset of Leray’s self-similar solutions (7.1):

where again the solutions have ﬂuid energy undeﬁned at t = 0. The solutions (7.1) and (7.3) can be
considered deﬁned for t > 0 and t < 0 [4]. We note that the self-similar solutions (7.3) of the PDE
system (7.2) are in the form ϕ(t)F(x, y, z) - the time dependence is a factor which multiplies a function
of the spatial coordinates. (7.3) can be considered to have proper units, if this is necessary for a study of
the dimensionalized NSE. Through homogeneity, u(x, y, z, t), v(x, y, z, t), w(x, y, z, t) are isobaric IRFs of
weight W = −1; while p(x, y, z, t) is an isobaric IRF of weight W = −2. Proper isobarity in both x, y, z
and t is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for their correct transformation.
Theorem 7.2. Within the set of Leray’s self-similar solutions (7.1), there is always a subset (7.3) which
is not subject to scaling-induced blow-up.
Proof. According to [13], the NSE admits the following Lie groups of transformations:

(7.6)
Because the operators (7.4)-(7.6) do not depend on partial derivatives, all absolute covariants of the
NSE will depend only on u, v, w, p. This is a property of the NSE worth noticing; its importance will be
seen in the last chapter of this work.
The necessary and suﬃcient condition (2.2) the absolute invariants/covariants of the NSE must satisfy
is expressed in the system of ﬁve PDEs
T I = 0
XI = 0
RxI = 0
RyI = 0
RzI = 0.
(7.7)
We solve (7.7) with Maple [14] and obtain all absolute covariants
(7.8)
I = F


,
where F is an arbitrary function and p/ρ is written shortly as “p”. It needs to be noted, that the form
of all covariants (7.8) is valid under the transformation (3.2) as well as under the general scaling (3.2);
in the ﬁrst case we solve the PDE system (7.7), while in the later X is replaced by two scaling operators.
In the simplest case (7.8) equals the dimensionless Euler’s number
(7.9)
E =
p
u2 + v2 + w2 ,
also known as cavitation number (if the vapor pressure is set to zero). E is an invariant with respect to
all symmetry transformations of the NSE (eqs. (7.7)). From (7.3) it follows that due to the factorization

12
J. POLIHRONOV
of the self-similar solution, the time-dependent parts in E cancel out and it turns out to be a conserved
quantity (in time),
E =

(7.10)
If the conserved quantities are found to provide upper bounds to the size of the solution, they are
termed coercive [18]. The cavitation number E contains the square of the modulus of the velocity |⃗u|2
in denominator and can thus be considered coercive; it is not an integral over IR3 and thus not subject
to delta-functions within the integration domain. Suppose that at large scales k ≫1 the modulus of
the velocity is ﬁnite but the energy of the system cannot ensure it does not tend to inﬁnity at a certain
location at very ﬁne scales. E is scale-invariant which means that as long as it has ﬁnite value at large
scales it must retain them at arbitrarily ﬁne scales as well. This would guarantee that |⃗u|2 does not grow
uncontrollably at any locale of inﬁnitely small size. In addition, this control is being exercised at any
given moment in time, because E is conserved, (7.10). Also, |⃗u| and the pressure p cannot be diverging
together as per the Bernoulli principle for incompressible ﬂuids; and therefore, the ratio p/|⃗u2| cannot be
ﬁnite unless both its numerator and denominator are ﬁnite ∀t.
□
Theorem 7.3. When the viscosity is not allowed to scale, αx = 1, αt = 2 (or, αt = 2αx), the Navier-
Stokes equation has a set of non self-similar solutions, which are nonzero at t = 0, nontrivial (not
identically zero everywhere) and inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable throughout IR3 and ∀t.
Proof. According to Lemma 4.1, The NSE exhibits self-similar solutions (4.2) under the general scaling
transformation (3.2) when viscosity is allowed to scale. If the viscosity is not allowed to scale i. e., αx = 1,
αt = 2 (or, αt = 2αx), the solutions (4.2)

and are therefore non self-similar under this transformation. Consider the supercritical (under the general
scaling transformation (3.2)) solutions of Proposition 4.7: here, βx > βt and βx > 0. We will set βt > 0,
since its sign is irrelevant. Suppose that the solutions are smooth and then diverging after ﬁnite time.
Suppose this is induced solely by rescaling, that is, a smooth solution of the NSE begins to diverge due
to the scaling invariant properties of the equation. According to the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion, the
integral of the vorticity will diverge and since αt = 2αx, it must be true that

at ﬁne scales k →0, which would be possible as long as βx < βt, or βx < 0 or βt < 0. However, any of
these would contradict the supercriticality condition of Proposition 4.7. It is not possible therefore that
this set of solutions would exhibit scaling induced blow-up in ﬁnite time. Moreover, since the non self-
similar solutions of Bouton are nonzero at t = 0 and nontrivial (not identically zero everywhere) as per
Lemma 4.1, by virtue of the same Lemma 4.1 they are polynomials, and therefore inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable
in IR3 × [0, ∞).

8. Turbulence
We calculate the scaling invariants of the NSE in the case αx = 1, αt = 2 (transformation (3.1)),
independently of other transformations by writing XI = 0, where the inﬁnitesimal operator of scale
changes X is given in (7.5). Maple yields
I = F
y
x, z
x, ux, vx, wx, px2, t

F being an arbitrary function. Then |⃗u|2r2 is an absolute covariant (r = |⃗r | =
p
x2 + y2 + z2); so are
(⃗u · ⃗r)2, (⃗r × ⃗u)i and (⃗r × ⃗u)2 etc. Write I as
(8.1)
|⃗r × ⃗u| +
1
ν

pr2.
This is a scale-invariant quantity in which |⃗r ×⃗u| is the modulus of the angular momentum per unit mass
for ﬂuid at position ⃗r; the pressure-viscosity term (1/ν)pr2 has the same units and can be considered to
account for viscous transfer of angular momentum. Next, consider the total angular momentum of the
ﬂuid per unit mass:
(8.2)
⃗Htot
m0
=
X
IR3
(⃗r × ⃗u) = const.
The RHS is scale-invariant vector because X(⃗r ×⃗u)i = 0; then the total angular momentum per unit mass
is a scale-invariant and a conserved quantity as well (recall that m0 = const is the unit mass of the ﬂuid
particle at position ⃗r as ﬂuid density is the same everywhere).
It may be argued, that the above mentioned scale-invariants as well as eqs. (8.1) and (8.2) suggest
collective ﬂuid behavior: the scaling invariance of ⃗r×⃗u and ⃗r·⃗u means that if at some scale |⃗u| decreases yet
at a diﬀerent scale |⃗r×⃗u| will remain invariant if the angle between ⃗r and ⃗u changes (|⃗r×⃗u| = |⃗r||⃗u| sin γ).
The invariant behavior of ⃗r · ⃗u suggests the same: the change of |⃗u| at one scale may trigger changes of
the direction of ﬂuid motion at other scales (⃗r · ⃗u = |⃗r||⃗u| cos γ). Small changes in |⃗u| can set oﬀlarge
changes in the directions of motion at smaller scales. Nonetheless, such momentum exchanges between
scales can only take place in diﬀerent moments because time is scaled as well.
However, (8.2) represents a conserved quantity. Through scale invariance, any changes in ⃗r × ⃗u on a
large scale will trigger instantaneous changes in the small scales, where rotation can take place. This is
a collective behavior throughout the ﬂuid volume, made possible by viscous transfer of momentum (i.e.
the second term in (8.1)) and ultimately due to the scaling invariance of the NSE.
Then, turbulence can generally be looked upon as the collective tendency of a viscous ﬂuid to generate
small scale vortices via its scaling properties and exchange of momentum. Such explanation is only qual-
itative though, while what is desired is a quantitative description which would allow control of turbulent
phenomena.
9. Differential Forms as Conserved Quantities
Bouton’s work consists of deriving the invariants of a diﬀerential equation; this is accomplished by
examining the ﬁnite transformations admitted by the equation as well as by putting to use their inﬁn-
itesimal operators to ﬁnd absolute and relative invariants. Both approaches give the same results; the
inﬁnitesimal transformations in equations (30) and (40) in Bouton’s article [3] are published by him for
the ﬁrst time; they conﬁrm his ﬁrst Theorem, which is based on ﬁnite transformations. In the sections
above, we applied Bouton’s analysis to the NSE. In this section, we will limit our study to the scaling
transformation (3.1), where αx = 1, αt = 2, or αt = 2αx, since it yields a conserved quanity, E. Recall
equation (7.7): all transformations, admitted by the NSE were used together to form the system of 5
PDEs T I = 0, XI = 0,... in order to ﬁnd a common covariant. As a matter of fact, the PDE system

14
J. POLIHRONOV
(7.7) is equivalent to the system of Lie derivatives
LT ωn = 0
LX ωn = 0
LRxωn = 0
LRyωn = 0
LRzωn = 0,
(9.1)
where I = ω0 of eq.(7.7) is a zero-form covariant (when n = 0) along the ﬂows of the vector ﬁelds
T , X, Rx, Ry, Rz. It makes sense to study precisely these ﬂows, since they correspond to vector ﬁelds
that leave the NSE unchanged (i.e., if we move all terms of the NSE to the Lhs and call this L, it is
said that the NSE admits the transformation if each operator, applied to L, reduces it to zero whenever
L = 0. For an example application of this rule see [13]). Therefore, Bouton’s invariant analysis of the
NSE is but a ﬁrst stage from a total of nine stages, all of which yield invariants of the NSE. The nine
stages correspond to the 8 variables x, y, z, t, u, v, w, p with whose diﬀerentials we can build 0-, 1-, ... and
8-forms. In all stages we use Maple to calculate the solutions of the corresponding systems of PDEs.
In all cases, we calculate (9.1) seeking n−form covariants as expressions of the dependent variables
u, v, w, p. Then we proceed as follows: we replace these variables with their corresponding functions, the
solutions of the NSE u(x, y, z, t), v(x, y, z, t), w(x, y, z, t) and p(x, y, z, t). We then examine the resulting
expressions and focus on those of them, which are conserved in time due to the cancelling out of the
time-dependent factor. From Theorem 7.1 it follows that they will also be scale-invariant. The fractions
p/⃗u2, u/v, |⃗u|/v, ⃗u2/(uv) etc. are time-independent by virtue of (7.3). This result follows from Theorem
7.1, according to which the self-similar solutions contain time as a factor and thus the above ratios
represent dimensionless scalar ﬁelds that no longer depend on t. In all expressions, ⃗u2 = u2 + v2 + w2;
|⃗u| =
√
u2 + v2 + w2.
The idea to utilize Cartan’s calculus in the study of the NSE has been researched previously by R.
Kiehn [11], [10]. In his analysis, he has studied the Lie derivatives along the ﬂows of vector ﬁelds and their
application to the NSE while in this work, the focus is on the vector ﬁelds of the diﬀerential operators
admitted by the NSE. The signiﬁcance of the derived results below is subject to future research where it
would be determined how the invariants of the NSE are related to the physics of the ﬂow.
0-forms: To ﬁnd the 0-forms that are covariants of all ﬁve operators simultaneously, we write eq. (7.7).
As explained, this is equivalent to the system of 5 Lie derivatives (9.1) when n = 0; it is a system of
5 PDEs, which yields the covariants (7.8). In the simplest case, this is (7.9), the Euler’s, or, cavitation
number E. Thus, B0 = E is an absolute invariant 0-form of the NSE; time-independent by virtue of
(7.3) and thus a conserved quantity of Bouton B0. It is a dimensionless scalar ﬁeld in IR3; its name
“cavitation number” indicates that E is related to cavitation phenomena and thus to turbulence. All
conserved quiantities below are multiples of E.
Recall again the fact that all inﬁnitesimal operators in (7.4)-(7.6) do not depend on the derivatives of
u, v, w, p as demonstrated by Lloyd [13]. This is an advantageous circumstance based on which all NSE
invariants are expressions of the dependent variables alone. Because they do not contain derivatives, we
can use them to ﬁnd conserved quantities in a simple functional form.
1-forms: Let ω1 be the form ω1 = a1(u, v, w, p)dx + a2(u, v, w, p)dy + ... + a8(u, v, w, p)dp. We solve the
system (9.1) for k = 1, which contains 8×5 = 40 PDEs. No conserved quantities are found. All functions
ai are considered to contain the dependent variables u, v, w, p.
2-forms: Let ω2 be the form ω2 = a1(u, v, w, p)dx∧dy+a2(u, v, w, p)dx∧dz +...+a28(u, v, w, p)dw∧dp.
The form can be reduced to 28 terms. We solve the system (9.1) for k = 2, which contains 28 × 5 = 140
PDEs. We obtain a 2-form conserved quantity of Bouton B2, which has 10 terms. All are multiplied by
F(B0), where F is an arbitrary function. For simplicity, we set F(B0) = B0 = E and get

10. Conclusions
The NSE global regularity conjecture is the assumption that given smooth initial conditions, a solution
of the NSE can always be found such, that it will remain smooth throughout 3-dimensional space and
all time. To evaluate the conjecture, we applied the pioneering work of Charles L. Bouton. According to
Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, Bouton was an American mathematician, born and lived just after the
end of the American Civil War [22]. He obtained his Ph. D. in mathematics under the guidance of Sophus
Lie at the University of Leipzig in Saxony, Germany in 1898 [15] and became professor in mathematics at
Harvard University, where he also served as editor of leading American journals in mathematics. Bouton’s
invariant theory was published in 1899 [3]; it consists of four theorems, the most relevant to the NSE being
the ﬁrst one according to which the scaling invariance of the PDE requires the solutions to be isobaric
functions. Bouton’s work on invariants is foundational, as acknowledged by researchers [17]; it includes
his doctoral thesis [3] and a number of other articles he authored. However, the memory of Bouton’s life
is enshrowded in mystery: despite of his prominent position in society [15], which is well-documented in
the media of his day, his memorial site is completely unmarked, unlike the sites pertaining to his parents
and all his siblings [23]. His Wikipedia entry lists only gaming theory in his publications record [22], while
the main thrust of his work was on Lie invariants of diﬀerential equations, which remains undiscovered
with very limited number of citations according to the Google Scholar database.
We adapted Bouton’s ﬁrst theorem to address the conjecture.
Bouton’s theory together with the
general scaling transformation of the NSE show the general form of all self-similar solutions. Under this
transformation, the NSE problem is no longer supercritical, but it can also be critical or subcritical,
depending on the scaling parameters. The criticality limit is governed by a 5/2 law, determined by the

ratio of two of the scaling transformation parameters. A subset of Bouton’s self-similar solutions are
shown to have global in-time regularity by using the Beale-Kato-Majda argument. It is assumed that
such solutions always exist due to the scaling properties of the NSE and the basic physics of the ﬂow.
We also studied Leray’s self-similar solutions as well as the regularity of a subset of those: when the
solutions are homogeneous functions, they yield a number of scale-invariant conserved quantities, which
are diﬀerential forms of various order and likely related to the physics of turbulence. When viscosity is
kept the same at all scales, the NSE always has non self-similar, isobaric polynomial solutions smooth in
IR3 × [0, ∞).
