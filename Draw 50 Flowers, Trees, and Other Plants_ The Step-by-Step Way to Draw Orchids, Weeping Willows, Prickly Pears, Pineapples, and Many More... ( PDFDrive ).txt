About the Author
Draw 50 Flowers, Trees, and Other Plants

Author’s Note
In recent books, I have worked with artists whom I consider to be
superbly talented. All are top achievers and craftspeople, highly acclaimed
by their colleagues and fans … and some have names and work you may
recognize. This way we are making available to you other styles of drawing,
techniques that are different from my own. With that in mind, I consider
myself very lucky to have been able to persuade Persis Lee Ames to join
with me in creating this book.
P. Lee Ames studied extensively at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston
and at the Art Students League in New York City. She then entered the
commercial art field and developed a career in advertising, book
illustration, jewelry design, and silver and greeting cards for Tiffany & Co.
Now that her children are grown, she works full-time on commissions for
portraits, landscapes, and murals for interior designers and private clients.
Her work can be found in private collections here and in Europe, and has
been featured in major magazines and newspapers.
Mrs. Ames considers herself an illustrator of nature and a realistic
painter. Flora is her specialty. She also excels in imaginative and whimsical
trompe l’oeil and faux finishes. Recently she has studied at the Isabel
O’Neil Studio in New York City, famed for its accomplishments in
decorative arts. Her portrait paintings, murals, and screens demonstrate
the artistic talents of this truly Renaissance woman.
And in case you’re wondering, Persis and I are not related.

To the Reader
To be able to see and enjoy what you are seeing is much to be grateful
for. But even more, being able to reproduce and convey to others, by
drawing, what you see or imagine provides greater satisfaction. As in all my
books, my purpose and pleasure are to show others, like yourself, a way to
construct drawings.
This world is full of glorious things to see. I think you’ll agree that the
flowers, fruits, trees, and the rest of the subject matter here are testament
to our beautiful world. In my earlier books, living subjects were all chosen
from the animal kingdom. The other major kingdom in the tree of life is the
vegetable kingdom, and almost all the drawings in this book are from there.
The only exception is the mushroom, which is one of the Fungi.
When you start working, I suggest you use clean white bond paper or
drawing paper and a pencil with moderately soft lead (HB or No. 2). Keep a
kneaded eraser handy (available at art supply stores). Choose the subject
you want to draw and then, very lightly and very carefully, sketch out the
first step. Also very lightly and carefully, add the second step. As you go
along, study not only the lines but the spaces between the lines. Size your
first steps to fill your drawing paper agreeably, not too large, not too small.
Remember the first steps must be constructed with the greatest care. A
mistake here could ruin the whole thing.
As you work, it’s a good idea to hold a mirror to your sketch from time to
time. The image in the mirror frequently shows distortion you might not
recognize otherwise.
You will notice that new step additions (in color) are printed darker. This
is so they can be clearly seen. But keep your construction steps always very
light. Here’s where the kneaded eraser can be useful. You can lighten a
pencil stroke that is too dark by pressing on it with the eraser.
When you’ve completed all the light steps, and when you’re sure you
have everything the way you want it, finish your drawing with firm, strong
penciling. If you like, you can go over this with India ink (applied with a fine
brush or pen) or a permanent fine-tipped ballpoint pen or a felt-tipped

marker. When the drawing is thoroughly dry, you can then use the kneaded
eraser to clean out all the underlying pencil marks.
Remember, if your first attempts at drawing do not turn out the way
you’d like, it’s important to keep trying. Your efforts will eventually pay off,
and you’ll be pleased and surprised at what you can accomplish. I sincerely
hope you’ll improve your drawing skills and have a great time drawing
these beautiful plants.
