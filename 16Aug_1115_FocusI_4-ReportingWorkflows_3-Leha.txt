What is Reproducible Research?
Possible Deﬁnition
a piece of reproducible research is an article that provides
readers with all the materials that are needed to produce the
same results as described in the publication

Why to use Reproducible Research
▶Beneﬁts for the researcher herself
In the mid-1980s, we realized that our laboratory’s
researchers often had diﬃculty reproducing their own
computations without considerable agony.
(Schwab, Karrenbach, and Claerbout, 2000)
▶Beneﬁts for others
▶Precise ‘description’ of methods
▶Easy re-use of applied methods
▶No forensic bioinformatics
(Baggerly and Coombes, 2009; Ioannidis et al., 2009)

Barriers for Reproducible Research
(Banks, 2011)
▶Deliberate non-reproducibility
▶Vagueness to cover potential mistakes
▶External reasons
▶Ownership of the data
▶Collaboration partners
▶Perception of eﬀort
▶Discipline
▶Resources
▶Change of work ﬂow

GNU make rules synchronize code and output
▶Sweave (Leisch, 2002)
interwoven R and LATEX by means of literate programming
▶Compendium (Gentleman and Temple Lang, 2007; Gentleman
et al., 2005)

What is Org-mode?
Org-mode is for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, doing
project planning, and authoring with a fast and eﬀective
plain-text system.
http://orgmode.org/
▶Major mode of emacs
▶File format
▶Created in 2003 by Carsten Dominik
▶Current Version 7.7; maintainer Bastien Guerry
▶Very active development

Org-mode and Reproducible Research
▶Through Org Babel, a literate programming (Knuth, 1984)
system

A Simple Example
The Data
We ﬁrst generate some data:
a <- rnorm (100, mean =0.0)
b <- rnorm (100, mean =0.8)

Analysis
A t-test shows that the means are signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent (p-value: ).

Summary
Using Org-mode for Research Can Give You
▶Reproducibility
▶Plain Text Files
▶Visual User Experience
▶Various Export Formats
▶Various Programming Languages
▶Intuitive Organizer
▶. . .
But
▶Reproducibility is still limited by active development
▶Less editing support than Sweave

Disclaimer
Claerbout’s principle
An article about computational science in a scientiﬁc
publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely
advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the
complete software development environment and the
complete set of instructions which generated the ﬁgures.
(Buckheit and Donoho, 1995)
