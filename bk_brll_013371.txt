FORMULA:
Logarithms, abbreviated ‘log’, must have a base. If it is 2, as in 
the binary system, then the log of 32 is 5 because 25 = 32. The log of 4 is
2 because 4 = 22; the log of 8 is 3 because 23 = 8. Then to 
multiply 4 by 8 you simply add 2 to 3, getting 5, which is the log of 
32. In the decimal system, the base of logarithms is 10 and the log of
100 is 2, of 1000 it is 3, and so on
(Logarithms, abbreviated ‘log’, must have 2, as in the binary system, then 
the log of 32 is 5 because 2 to the power of 5 equals 32. The log of 4 is 2 
because 4 equals 2 squared; the log of 8 is 3 because 2 to the power of 3  
equals 8. Then to multiply 4 by 8 you simply add 2 to 3, getting 5, which is 
the log of 32. In the decimal system, the base  of logarithms is 10 and the 
log of 100 is 2, of 1000 it is 3, and so on.)
