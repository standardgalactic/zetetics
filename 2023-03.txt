The persistence of imperfect mimicry in nature presents a challenge to mimicry
theory. Some hypotheses for the existence of imperfect mimicry make differing
predictions depending on how mimetic fidelity is measured. Here, we
measure mimetic fidelity in a brood parasite–host system using both trait-
based and response-based measures of mimetic fidelity. Cuckoo finches
Anomalospiza imberbis lay imperfectly mimetic eggs that lack the fine scribbling
characteristic of eggs of the tawny-flanked prinia Prinia subflava, a common
host species. A trait-based discriminant analysis based on Minkowski func-
tionals—that use geometric and topological morphometric methods related
to egg pattern shape and coverage—reflects this consistent difference between
host and parasite eggs. These methods could be applied to quantify other phe-
notypes including stripes and waved patterns. Furthermore, by painting
scribbles onto cuckoo finch eggs and testing their rate of rejection compared
to control eggs (i.e. a response-based approach to quantify mimetic fidelity),
we show that prinias do not discriminate between eggs based on the absence
of scribbles. Overall, our results support relaxed selection on cuckoo finches to
mimic scribbles, since prinias do not respond differently to eggs with and
without scribbles, despite the existence of this consistent trait difference.
1. Introduction
Although mimics evolve to resemble models, imperfect mimicry is common in
nature [1,2]. Explanations proposed for the persistence of imperfect mimicry
(reviewed in [1–4]) include relaxed selection, competing selection pressures,
and the evolution of models away from mimics. To test the predictive power of
these explanations, we must quantify imperfect mimicry in biological systems.
Two classes of methods can quantify imperfect mimicry [2,5]. Trait-based
approaches quantify trait differences between models and mimics. Response-
based measures quantify differences in receiver response to models and mimics.
Different hypotheses for imperfect mimicry entail different expectations for

trait and response differences. For instance, the hypothesis that
there is relaxed selection for perfect mimicry predicts that trait
differences exist, but that receiver responses to models and
mimics should be similar [2]. The hypothesis that models evolve
away from mimics predicts the existence of both trait differences
and differences in receiver responses to models and mimics [2].
Therefore, considering both trait-based and response-based
measures of mimetic fidelity is crucial to determine causes of
imperfect mimicry. However, very few studies have explicitly
quantified both measures for a mimetic phenotype [5].
Here, we quantify trait-based and response-based mea-
sures of imperfect mimicry in an avian brood parasite–host
system. Interspecific brood parasites, such as our study species,
the cuckoo finch, lay eggs in the nests of other species (hosts)
such as the tawny-flanked prinia, passing costs of parenthood
onto hosts [6]. To evade egg rejection by hosts, the distinct
maternal lineage of cuckoo finches which parasitises prinias
[7] has evolved mimicry of prinia egg patterns. Puzzlingly,
however, this mimicry appears strikingly imperfect to human
eyes: cuckoo finch eggs lack the scribbles of pigment which
are present on all prinia eggs (figure 2a). Yet, prinias frequently
accept eggs that lack scribbles [8]. Here, we quantify scribbles,
and their contribution to the differences between host and
parasitic eggs, using Minkowski functionals. These describe
geometrical patterns and topological connectedness [9–11].
We also experimentally improve mimicry to test whether this
influences receiver responses in prinia parents. We expected
to find trait differences between prinia and cuckoo finch eggs
corresponding to presence and absence of scribbles respect-
ively. We expected little response-based differences between
eggs with and without scribbles, since in nature prinias
accept some eggs which lack scribbles [8].
2. Methods
Fieldwork was conducted on Semahwa and Musumanene Farms
(ca. 16°740S, 26°900S) in Choma District, Zambia.
(a) Trait quantification
We used flexible discriminant analysis (FDA; function fda in R
package mda [12]) to quantify trait-based mimetic fidelity. A
high-performing FDA would correctly assign eggs to species,
reflecting trait differences between species.
We extracted measurements of colour and pattern traits from a
representative egg (prinia n = 215; cuckoo finch n = 123) from
clutches laid during 2018–2020 (alongside cuckoo finch eggs laid
in 2012–2016), as described in [13]. Colour measures were extracted
as in [7]; briefly, reflectance spectra were obtained using an Ocean
Optics USB2000 Spectrophotometer, with a PX-2 pulsed xenon
light source and an R400-7-UV/VIS reflectance probe, standar-
dized with a Spectralon 99% White Standard (Labsphere) and a
black felt cloth. Photon catches were calculated from the average
of five measurements of an egg’s background colour, using the R
package PAVO and a blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus model [14]. We
used two principal components of photon catches, capturing
88% of the variation, in the FDA.
Measures of principal marking size, marking size variation,
pattern contrast, pattern coverage, and the extent to which pattern
is dispersed between blunt and narrow poles of the egg were
extracted using granularity analysis in MATLAB [8] and adaptive
thresholding in the MICA toolbox in ImageJ [15], as described
in [13].
Further pattern measures were quantified using NaturePat-
ternMatch, which uses scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)
[16], to extract ‘features’ corresponding loosely to individual pat-
tern markings. We extracted the number of SIFT features, and the
mean and standard deviation of the size of the SIFT features.
Two principal components, capturing 94% of the variation,
were used in the FDA.
Scribbles are characterized by a large perimeter : area ratio,
which the measures above cannot capture. Therefore, to quantify
scribbles we deployed Minkowski functionals [9–11], which are
used to characterize statistical geometries in, for example, physical
patterns in reaction–diffusion equations and cosmic microwave
background radiation maps. For each image, we inverted
image intensity such that high intensity regions corresponded to
pattern markings, applied a Gaussian filter (MATLAB function
imgaussfilt) to reduce noise, and performed image thresholding
with 80 thresholds (MATLAB function bwlabel) so that only
regions with intensity values higher than the given threshold
were retained. For each thresholded image, we computed three
Minkowski measures (using the MATLAB imMinkowski toolbox
[17]) which assess pattern geometry and topology: the geometrical
measures of perimeter and area, and a topological measure, the
Euler characteristic [17]. The perimeter P of a thresholded image
is the total perimeter of all high intensity regions in it, the area
A is the total area of those regions, and the Euler characteristic is
the difference between the number of connected components
and the number of holes in the image (i.e. a measure of pattern
connectivity). To obtain a single value for each egg, we took the
integral (sum Σ) of each Minkowski functional across the
80 thresholds.
Intuitively, the dimensionless quantity P2/A can capture the
high perimeter and low area of scribbles (figure 1a). To confirm
this, we tested whether painting parasitic eggs with scribbles
(see below) increased Σ(P2/A), using a matched pairs t-test.
(b) Receiver response quantification
To determine whether the presence of scribbles affected host
responses, we conducted experiments (n = 44) largely as in [13].
Briefly, one egg from a completed host clutch was replaced with
an ‘experimental’ egg, with the nest observed for 4 days to deter-
mine whether the replacement egg was rejected [8,13]. Hosts
were given close colour matches to human vision (cf. [13]).
Unlike [13], real parasitic eggs (taken from other prinia nests)
rather than conspecific eggs were used as experimental eggs. The
test treatment (n = 17) was five scribbles painted on a real cuckoo
finch egg; at least a part of one scribble could be seen by viewing
any angle of the egg. Control treatments were: (a) 10 blotches
totalling approximately the same area (electronic supplementary
material) as the five scribbles in the test treatment (n = 14); or (b)
five scribbles painted with water (n = 13) (figure 2b). Control (a)
assessed whether the addition of paint influenced rejection. Con-
trol (b) determined a baseline rate of rejection and controlled for
effects of handling the egg. Treatments were allocated randomly.
We painted eggs with Standard Series Acrylic Van Dyke Brown
paint (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), using a firm toothbrush
bristle held in tweezers with putty. Paint colour was similar
to

(mean

We analysed whether treatment affected host response (i.e.
egg rejection) using logistic regression (function glm in R [18]).
3. Results

A FDA based on colour and pattern traits correctly assigned
86% of cuckoo finch eggs and 91% of prinia eggs to species.
The most important traits contributing to assignment were
Σ(P2/A) (coefficient = 50%) and ΣEuler (coefficient = 36%;

Z41 = 0.43, p = 0.67; treatment-blotches: estimate ± s.e. = 0.18 ±
0.79, Z41 = 0.23, p = 0.82; figure 2). Thus, the addition of scrib-
bles to a cuckoo finch egg did not reduce its probability of
rejection. In three trials, a prinia rejected one of its own
eggs alongside the cuckoo finch egg; in one trial, the prinia
rejected one of its own eggs while accepting the cuckoo
finch egg.
4. Discussion
In this study, we quantified trait-based and response-based
measures of mimetic fidelity in a brood parasite–host system.
We showed that scribbles are captured by Minkowski func-
tionals and result in quantifiable trait differences between
hosts and parasites (i.e. imperfect mimicry). However, the
addition of scribble markings to cuckoo finch eggs did not
reduce the probability of egg rejection by hosts, implying that
the absence of scribbles on parasitic eggs does not affect
response-based mimetic fidelity.
A discriminant analysis performed well at assigning eggs
to species, illustrating that consistent differences exist between
host and parasitic eggs. The principal traits contributing to
species assignment were the scaled ratio of perimeter to area
Σ(P2/A) and the Euler characteristic ΣEuler.
Intuitively, Σ(P2/A) corresponds loosely to marking size:
high values correspond to small markings or those with
more perimeter such as line-like markings. Previous work [8]
has shown that a coarse-grained measure of marking size
(principal marking size, calculated with granularity analyses)
differs significantly between prinias and cuckoo finches,
with hosts exhibiting smaller marking sizes than parasites
[8]. However, this measure cannot fully capture scribbles,
because scribbles are characterized by both large and small
size (since they are both long and thin). P2/A, by contrast, cap-
tures this property of scribbles. The Minkowski measure P2/A
could therefore be applied to the wide range of biological con-
texts in which patterns consist of lines, such as stripes and
waves [19].
Prinia eggs exhibited lower values of ΣEuler than cuckoo
finch eggs. ΣEuler is a topological measure corresponding to
the number of separate markings in a pattern, i.e. pattern con-
nectivity. This result was surprising since another measure of
number of markings (the number of SIFT features, extracted
using NaturePatternMatch [16]), shows the opposite relation-
ship: prinia eggs have more SIFT features than cuckoo finch
eggs [13]. This apparent discrepancy may also be due to scrib-
bles: one scribble often corresponds to multiple SIFT features,
due to large changes in orientation of some SIFT features. By
contrast, ΣEuler measures connectivity (low ΣEuler indicates
high connectivity) and scribbles often connect multiple mark-
ings together. The addition of scribbles did not affect ΣEuler
values for cuckoo finch eggs, perhaps because five scribbles
were too few to significantly increase connectivity. Neverthe-
less, Minkowski functionals provide qualitatively different
information to previously studied measures such as principal
marking size and number of SIFT features.
Moving from trait-based to response-based measures of
mimetic fidelity, few studies have tested whether attempts
to artificially improve mimicry result in improved receiver
performance (but see [20,21]). Here, we improved trait-
based mimicry by painting scribbles on cuckoo finch eggs.
Rejection rates across treatments were high (57–65%) despite
hosts being given close colour matches; by comparison, simu-
lations of parasitism in this system estimated that 50% of
randomly laid parasitic eggs would be rejected by both pri-
nias
and
another
host,
Cisticola
erythrops
[8,22].
This
suggests that there are unmeasured traits important in rejec-
tion, leading to rates being underestimated by simulations.
The addition of scribbles to cuckoo finch eggs did not
affect receiver performance, indicating that prinias do not
use this trait in rejection, unlike other traits which differ con-
sistently between parasitic eggs and their own [8,13]. Perhaps
prinias are unable to perceive thin markings, due to low
acuity or contrast sensitivity. While recent work has focused
on acuity limits in spatial vision [23], little research has
applied
contrast
sensitivity
functions
(CSFs)
to
spatial
visual modelling. Avian CSFs are typically 10 times lower
than those of humans [24], highlighting that patterns visible
to humans may be invisible to birds. Thus, cuckoo finches
may lack scribbles because prinias cannot use the absence
of scribbles in decision-making; i.e. the ‘eye-of-the-beholder’
hypothesis for imperfect mimicry [25].
Given that scribbles are not used in rejection, why are
prinia eggs scribbled? Perhaps scribbles have a function unre-
lated to parasitism, such as egg camouflage, which predicts
egg survival in other systems [26]. A close relative of
P. subflava, P. maculosa, which is not parasitized by cuckoo
finches, sometimes has scribbled eggs [27,28]. The function
of scribbles, in prinias and in a wide taxonomic range of
birds [27], merits further study.
In summary, we conducted trait-based and receiver-based
analyses of mimetic fidelity in a brood parasite–host system.
While discriminant analysis performed well at assigning eggs
to species, prinias did not use the most salient trait—the pres-
ence/absence of scribbles on eggs—in rejection. This suggests
that cuckoo finches are under relaxed selection to mimic this
trait. We also introduced a novel method for quantifying pat-
terning using Minkowski functionals, which can distinguish
long, thin markings from other patterns. Beyond the specific
example of egg pattern discrimination, statistical–geometrical
and statistical–topological measures such as Minkowski func-
tionals might be used to quantify markings in a wide range of
biological contexts [19].
