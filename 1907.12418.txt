ABSTRACT
The cosmological constant is estimated by considering the surface tension of supervoids in a void-dominated cosmic ﬂuid by
which we can get a possible source of dark energy. Looking at voids as bubbles, we deﬁne the concept of surface tension which
is shown to have an almost constant value for supervoids that are enclosed by superclusters. The surface tensions of voids are
computed by dimensional method for galaxies and superclusters with diﬀerent values for each group. At large scale which vast
voids are dominant the positive cosmological constants obtained of order (≃+10−52m−2), which are very close to those given
by 푃푙푎푛푐푘.

1 INTRODUCTION
As we know the existence of a type of material ﬂuid with negative
pressure remains an unsolved puzzle in physics and cosmology, be-
cause the lowest perceived pressure for any type of ordinary matter
ﬂuid is zero. But one of the ways to justify the current accelerating
expansion in the universe is to have negative pressure for the cos-
mic ﬂuid at large scale (Riess et al. 2004; Perlmutter et al. 1999;
Spergel et al. 2003; Ade et al. 2016; Cheng 2010; Srivastava 2008) .
In the ideal gas law it is assumed that the particles are point-like
without any volumes and interactions, but in the present physical cos-
mic ﬂuid, there exist some over-dense and under-dense regions that
some phenomena occurring between cosmic objects, for example the
merging of them is a common phenomenon at cosmological scale.
Galaxies and galaxy clusters, and even voids are all always evolving
and merging together to form larger ones. Although the volume of
the merged galaxies are small fractions of the total cosmos volume,
but taking into account the contribution of vast voids, the volumes
of these voids become large fractions of the present cosmic web and
their contributions will grow up (Cowen 2015; Pisani et al. 2015;
Hamaus et al. 2016; Khanpour et al. 2017; Koren 2017). As voids
expand, galaxies are squeezed in between them, and sheets and ﬁla-
ments form the void boundaries. This view is supported by computer
simulationsandnumerical studies (Van De Weygaert & Platen2011;
Padilla et al. 2005; Martel & Wasserman 1990). Also, novel cosmo-

logical constraints obtained from cosmic voids and exact calibrations
demonstrates that can be expect the immense potential to use cosmic
voids for cosmology in current and future data Hamaus et al. (2020).
Scientists usually consider only matter (galaxies and their clusters)
as the active part of the universe, so telescopes and probes focus on
this part of the cosmic ﬂuid. But the much larger under-dense part
of the current universe, the supervoids, are considered as the ineﬀec-
tive part in the dynamics of the universe. In this article for the ﬁrst
time, we take the role of cosmic voids very seriously and consider
the eﬀect of theirs surface tension on global and local scale to solve
important unresolved problems in physical cosmology. Several pa-
pers have pointed out that vast voids are not only a key element of
the cosmic mass and volume distribution, but also one of the purest
probes for global cosmic parameters (Bos et al. 2012; Pisani et al.
2015; Hamaus et al. 2016). We consider the current cosmic ﬂuid as
a mixture of two evolving and merging parts. These include the over-
dense galactic part on the one hand and the under-dense voids part
on the other. Given that voids make up a much larger contribution of
the current cosmic ﬂuid, we will show that this void-dominant ﬂuid
will create additional eﬀective negative pressure (with a negative
’cosmic equation of state’ i.e. 푤eﬀ< 0), on the large scale. As an
important consequence of this hypothesis, we will also be able to ob-
tain possible estimates for the cosmological constant by dimensional
calculating of the surface tensions on the supervoids boundary that
enclosed by superclusters. Our hypothesis is related to the surface
tension of supervoids, in which their average eﬀect can create an
eﬀective negative pressure at cosmic scales.
Our main thesis of this paper is the surface tension of cosmic voids
due to the existence of inhomogeneities and hence their role in global
expansion is closely related to the "backreaction" issue (Räsänen

E. Yusoﬁet al.
2012; Buchert et al. 2015). By deﬁnition, backreaction is the eﬀect
of inhomogeneities caused by matter and geometry on the global ex-
pansion of the universe Buchert et al. (2015). In some papers, Green
and Wald believe that backreaction of inhomogeneities is irrelevant in
cosmology (Green & Wald 2011, 2013). As we know, in Newtonian
context only inhomogeneities of the matter part can be considered
and the geometry part is considered ﬂat. Newtonian limit of GR au-
tomatically implies that the geometry is Euclidean, in particular that
the intrinsic curvature vanish everywhere (Buchert & Räsänen 2012;
Buchert 2018). But when we consider the global scale of the uni-
verse, the Newtonian framework - due to neglecting the role of curved
geometry- can not provide the desired results, and the Buchert-Ehlers
theorem results in a zero backreaction Buchert & Ehlers (1997).
In a recent new work, the eﬀect of inhomogeneities in the Newtonian
framework with a non-Euclidean topology is investigated Vigneron
(2021). The eﬀect of the backreaction in the context of general rela-
tivity have been widely studied (Buchert 2000, 2001; Buchert et al.
2020), in which both the role of matter and geometric inhomo-
geneities are considered on a global scale. So the consequence will
be the non-zero backreaction, and hence it can aﬀect the dynamics
and the accelerating expansion of the universe. The model presented
here can achieve this important request with a heuristic calculation
of the surface tension from the void-cluster interface.
The model presented in this paper is in the context of relativistic
cosmology. To achieve this goal we have already considered second-
order terms in the cosmic equation of state as
푃= 푤휌+ 푏휌2,
that the details are given in Khanpour et al. (2017).
Why the role of supervoids and their surface tension is taken seriously
in this article? When we consider signiﬁcant the second term- as an
interacting term- in the EoS of cosmic ﬂuid; there must be physical
objects that are interacting (or merging) with each other on the cos-
mic scale. Because the scales are so large, the best possible candidate
for these merging objects are the largest ones i.e. merging supervoids
that are enclosed by superclusters (Sutter et al. 2014; Cowen 2015).
By taking into account the eﬀect of the merging of vast voids on
the cosmic web together with the enlargement of empty spaces over
time at low redshift in N-body simulations Adermann et al. (2017),
as well as its similarity to the behavior of bubbles in hot overﬂowing
milk Yusoﬁ& Mohsenzadeh (2010); the idea of using bubble surface
tension will be considered as a possible model for studying eﬀects
of supervoids pressure in accelerating expansion. Recently, similar
to our idea, the surface tension hypothesis has also been proposed by
Ortiz to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe and some
other important challenges of physical cosmology Ortiz (2020). In
his paper the cosmic system under study was considered homoge-
neous and isotropic, while the formation of cosmic structure and its
inhomogeneities is ignored. But in our work, inhomogeneities in the
structure of the universe are the main factor of the production of
supervoids/superclusters and the resulting their surface tension.
So in the Sec. 2 we will introduce void-dominated cosmic ﬂuid
and by the drops-bubbles mixed ﬂuid model show that in such a
ﬂuid we will have an eﬀective negative pressure at large scale. In the
Sec. 3 and 4, by a dimensional calculating of the surface tension,
we will obtain a possible estimation for the values of cosmological
constants for two groups of cosmic objects 푖.푒. superclusters and
galaxies. Some results, predictions and discussions on the model
will be presented in ﬁnal section.

2 PRESSURE AND SURFACE TENSION OF COSMIC
VOIDS
Let’s consider the current cosmic web in Fig. 1 containing a network
of the voids, in which several clusters and ﬁlaments, small and vast
voids are merging to each other (see the area bounded to the black
rectangularinFig. 2). What iscertainisthat theuniverseisinthevoid-
dominated state in the large scale overview. The continuous merging
of voids causes the bubbles to grow larger, and this increasing in
the bubble radius results in an extra eﬀective repulsive force on
the particles (i.e., galaxies) on the surface of the bubbles (i.e., voids).
Under such conditions, cosmic ﬂuid is clustered like merging bubbles
and is situated in the void-dominated phase.
In the model proposed in this paper, we imagine galaxies and their
clusters as ’drops’ and under dense spaces (voids) between them
as ’bubbles’ Yusoﬁ& Mohsenzadeh (2010). In a mixture of water
drops and bubbles, bubbles on their surface move the ﬁne drops
away from their center to make themselves larger, while large drops

attract ﬁne drops to their center to grow larger. If the void wall forms
a set of galaxy clusters and superclusters, we will have a bubble
whose diﬀerence in internal and external pressure comes from the
Young-Laplace formula (Butt et al. 2003; Reichl 2016)
Δ푃= 2훾
¯푟.
(1)
Here, 훾represents the surface tension for drop (bubble) with average
radius ¯푟. The clusters of galaxies behave like drops, so their pressure
on the test particles/galaxies is positive with an attractive gravity
eﬀect (yellow circle in Fig. 2). These galaxies experience attractive
force in the clusters-dominated areas at local scales, but at large
scale that we have void-dominated areas, the situation is completely
diﬀerent. Galaxies that mostly accumulate on the surface of voids,
would experience eﬀective negative pressure, because of the fact that
voids inclosed by superclusters are expanding, and hence pushing
the galaxies away from each other. Therefore, inspired by (1), two
factors are eﬀective in the pressure of voids on cosmic scales. The ﬁrst
factor is the surface tension 훾, due to the attraction between material
particles that make up the disk-shaped objects on the surface of voids,
and the second factor is due to the curvature ( 1
¯푟) of these cosmic voids
.
Because the net eﬀective pressure of the cosmic web at large scale
essentially dominated by supervoids and their pressure, in which the
curvature term ( 1
¯푟) takes a negative sign in this case (see Fig. 2).
Here the negative sign means that the average pressure on galaxies
from the expanding supervoids at cosmic scales acts in reverse to the
pressure from the superclusters at local scales, and causing the galax-
ies to move away. Fortunately, the observational data conﬁrm nega-
tive pressure that EoS parameter 푤has a very narrow range around
푤= −1 with more likelihood to the side of 푤≲−1 (Srivastava
2008; Aghanim et al. 2020).
In what follows, we will show that the negative pressure coming
from surface tension and curvature of voids can justify the presence
of dark energy at large scale, and probably dark matter in local scales.
3 DIMENSIONAL CALCULATION OF SURFACE TENSION
The supervoids make up the main volume of the universe at cosmic
scale. Therefore, the thickness of the walls is small compared to the
large volume of the supervoids and they can almost be considered as
an idealised surface. The presence of a separating surface between
the under-dense and the over-dense areas creates a surface tension
that produce pressure diﬀerence between them. However, the interior
of walls is well observed and the eﬀect of wall thickness could be
investigated in a more accurate model.
Given the above ideal assumption for the surface tension of su-
pervoids, if we consider the location of clusters on the surface of
supervoids, as a result of this consideration, the mass and energy
of galaxies and their clusters are distributed on the shells of voids.
Therefore, the energy-to-area ratio i.e. surface tension 훾for the disc-
shaped objects can be calculated by using the following,
훾푖≡퐸푛푒푟푔푦

.
(2)
In the above relation 푀푖and 푅푖are binding mass and mean radius of
the cosmic objects such as galaxies, clusters and superclusters (Fig.
3). For example, the amount of surface tension or surface energy
for the Laniakea supercluster with 푀3 = 1.0 × 1047kg and 푅3 =
2.4 × 1024m is obtained as,
훾3 ≈0.50 × 1015J.m−2.
(3)
Figure 3. Schematic picture of supervoid with shell of superclusters on it
surface.
Because the surface tension is an intensive quantity (Butt et al. 2003;
Zemansky 2011), it is expected that the approximate values of surface
energy for the superclusters at large scale are the same order (∼
O(1015)J.m−2), but the energy density is not the same for these
objects.
4 AN ESTIMATION OF THE COSMOLOGICAL
CONSTANT WITH VAST VOID PRESSURE
In the standard cosmology with cosmological constant Λ, we have

(4)
Considering contribution of voids energy density 휌void, instead of
cosmological constant in the void-dominated (or quasi-vauum domi-
nated Yusoﬁ(2018)) cosmic ﬂuid, we can modify Friedmann’s equa-
tion to
( ¤푎

(휌matter + 휌void) −푘푐2
푎2 .
(5)
Since a void-dominated phase of cosmic ﬂuid can be regarded
as a quasi-vacuum dominated state i.e. 휌void = 휌Λ, therefore two
relations (5) and (4) are equivalent and we can deﬁne
Λ = 8휋퐺휌void

.

with consideration 휌void = 푃void/푤푐2,
Λ = 8휋퐺푃void

.
(7)
After formation of the structure in the cosmic scales, its dominant part
is supervoids that are enclosed by superclusters. The eﬀective pres-
sure supposed in these scales stems from the surface tension produced
on the interface between supervoids and superclusters. Therefore, due
to the predominance of voids in large structure heterogeneities, the
pressure diﬀerence in (1), can be equivalent to the eﬀective pressure
caused by the voids i.e. Δ푃≃푃void, and we can write,
Λ = 8휋퐺

According to the relation obtained above, Λ in addition to the surface
tension 훾, depends another factor i.e. ( 1

curvature term, we can choose both negative and positive sign for it
depending on whether under study is global or local. Therefore, we
can expect a positive and negative cosmological constant for global
and local scales, respectively. Therefore we note that according to
the sign of curvature term one can talk of a de Sitter world matter
(Λcs positive, pressure negative) or an anti-de Sitter world matter
(Λls negative, pressure positive) Cohen-Tannoudji & Gazeau (2021).

According to a recent study, an intergalactic void is responsible for
pushing the galaxies such as Andromeda or Milky Way at increasing
speed through the universe
Hoﬀman et al. (2017). Cosmic voids
typically have a diameter of 100 Mpc i.e. ¯푟void = 1.54 × 10+24m.
Also, 퐺= 6.67 × 10−11m3.kg−1.s−2 , 푤Planck = −1.03 ± 0.03, and
푐= 3 × 108m.s−1. By putting (3) and these values in equation (9),
we can estimate the following value for the cosmological constant
for 훾3 = 0.50 × 1015J.m−2,
Λ3 = 1.2979 × 10−52m−2.
(10)
By using of the 푃푙푎푛푐푘2018 values of ΩΛ = 0.6889 ± 0.0056 and
퐻0 = 67.66 ± 0.42(km/s)/Mpc, Λ has the value of Aghanim et al.
(2020)

 퐻0
푐
2
= 1.1056 × 10−52m−2.
(11)
The cosmological constant value in relation (9) depends on both the
surface energy and the radius of diﬀerent voids, but for a mean size
of the cosmic voids, the order obtained for cosmological constant
at cosmic scale Λcs, in each case is very close to the observational
value (11) and according to the ﬁrst four rows of Table 1. is in the
following range
0.6645 × 10−52m−2 ≤Λcs ≤1.6172 × 10−52m−2.
(12)
Fortunately, the observational value (11) for cosmological constant
is in this range.
Looking at Table 1, we will ﬁnd that smaller surface energy and
cosmological constant are obtained for larger cosmic objects. At
large scale due to the presence of galactic superclusters on the one
hand and supervoids on the other, we will obtain the least value
of surface tension. Therefore, the cosmological constant value, for
example for Laniakea supercluster is equal to (10), which is very
close to the observational value for the cosmological constant (11).
In Table 1, by considering the mass and approximate radius of
the disc-shaped cosmic objects, we could obtain the surface tension
for the two groups of objects. Then we will get the cosmological
constant corresponding to each surface tensions according to (8). The
values obtained in Table 1 show that for larger objects we will have
smaller surface tension and therefore less cosmological constant and
vice versa. The lowest surface tension is related to the superclusters
that make up the walls of large cosmic voids, but the largest surface
tension is related to the galaxies that make up the walls of local voids.
So correspondingly, the maximum amount of cosmological constant
for galaxies is Λmax = 2307.2800 × 10−52m−2 approximately 3472
times that of the minimum of it (Λmin = 0.6645 × 10−52m−2).
As a consequence of the dominance of supervoids with negative
curvature at cosmic scale, we have shown by an interesting heuristic
line of reasoning, that almost constant surface energy for the su-
perclusters on the boundaries of supervoids acts as a cosmological
constant and consequently acts as a driver in the accelerating motion
of galaxies at large scales.
Many studies have shown that the presence of inhomogeneities in
the structure of the universe plays a role in global expansion (Räsänen
2011; Wiltshire 2011; Clarkson et al. 2011; Buchert & Räsänen
2012; Buchert et al. 2015). So more precisely in our model super-
clusters and supervoids as the largest present inhomogeneities are
the result of structure formation. These two largest objects in the
universe can coexist and can produce eﬀective pressure in global and
local scales. So far we have shown that the eﬀective pressure caused
by supervoids on a global scale acts as a potential source of dark
energy. On the other hand, we speculate that collective force from
merging supervoids may act as a possible source for dark matter. On
this basis, we also predict that there are places in the universe that
can not have dark matter. We will address this issue in the near future
work.
5 SUMMARY AND SOME POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MODEL
We have proposed that the present cosmic ﬂuid composed of two
dynamical parts. On the one hand matters are clustering and on the
other hand voids are merging, simultaneously. Since the dominant
volume of the present cosmic web is formed by merging voids, based
the our model, the negative pressure or repulsive gravity is inevitable
at large scale. That is, the cosmic gas is considered as mixture of
so many voids (bubbles), each of supervoids has repulsive force
on galaxies, and hence the total eﬀective pressure of the universe
at large scale would become negative or repulsive. In other words,
voids merge with other voids to form larger voids. As a result of this
process, the galaxies on the shell of supervoids move away from each
other. As an interesting point, the merging of the cosmic voids at their
surfaces may produce both additional contracting (positive pressure)
at local over-dense scales and accelerating (negative pressure) at large
under-dense ones, simultaneously.
By dimensional calculating of the surface energy on the boundary
of voids, we have obtained almost the same value of surface ten-
sions for the supervoids enclosed by superclusters from the order of
O(1015)J.m−2. Also, we have calculated acceptable range for global
cosmological constant values that the observational value for Λ is in
this range.

Dark Energy in Void-dominated Cosmology
5
As we know, the scale of the largest supervoids grows in the standard
model and in the proposed model with cosmological time, and this
probably has an eﬀect on the cosmic equation-of-state and eﬀective
pressure of cosmic ﬂuid. The eﬀective equation-of-state for the cos-
mic ﬂuid in our model has a negative value which is of the order
of ”1”. Since, our calculations are dimensional and approximate, so
small changes in the amount of 푤eﬀdo not have much eﬀect on our
calculations and results. In addition, it should be noted that in the real
model the voids are very non-spherical and our results are at most a
rough order-of-magnitude argument.
The key point of this work is that the universe has evolved from a
matter-dominated cosmic ﬂuid to a void-dominated one (instead of
a vacuum-dominated). Therefore, the presence of such supervoids
in this period is considered as the possible driver of the universe
expansion and creates additional pressure on ordinary matter.
Highlights include:
(1) The present cosmic ﬂuid consists of two coexistent evolving parts,
namely merging superclusters and merging supervoids.
(2) In the proposed model, we have considered a fundamental role
for cosmic voids and their surface tensions in the dynamics of the
present universe at global scale.
(3) Both negative eﬀective pressure at the global scale and positive
ones at local scales are introduced.
(4) The almost constant surface tension on the supervoids shells re-
produces a cosmological constant whose magnitude is as same as
that conﬁrmed by observational 푃푙푎푛푐푘data.
Since, the cosmological constant value depends on surface energy
of clusters and the radius of voids, i.e. Λ ∼훾/푟void , at large-scale
which supervoids are dominant, we have obtained very small values
for the cosmological constants for the model of order (+10−52m−2),
which are very close to those given by 푃푙푎푛푐푘2018. However, on
local scales we were led to the larger values with negative sign
(Λls ≃−10−49m−2). It can be speculated that the surface tensions of
supervoids on a local scale provide an additional eﬀective force that
holds galaxies, clusters, and superclusters together. Finally, the valid-
ity of the proposed model can also be further examined in the three
years of observed dark energy survey data (DES Y3)Abbott et al.
(2021) as well as the Euclid mission Amendola et al. (2018). As a
ﬁnal point, we also expect that the proposed model is capable to solve
the Hubble tension. Attempts are being made to investigate this issue.
