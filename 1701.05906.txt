We study the eﬀects of acceleration on fermionic Gaussian states of localized modes of a Dirac
ﬁeld. We consider two wavepackets in a Gaussian state and transform these to an accelerated frame
of reference. In particular, we formulate the action of this transformation as a fermionic quantum
channel. Having developed the general framework for fermions, we then investigate the entanglement
of the vacuum, as well as the entanglement in Bell states. We ﬁnd that with increasing acceleration
vacuum entanglement increases, while the entanglement of Bell states decreases. Notably, our results
have an immediate operational meaning given the localization of the modes.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In general spacetimes the notion of particles loses its
invariant meaning. One consequence of this observation
is the detection of thermal particles in the Minkowski
vacuum by a uniformly accelerated observer. This phe-
nomenon is known as the Unruh eﬀect [1]. It has imme-
diate consequences for quantum states observed by ac-
celerated observers. Their description becomes observer-
dependent.
In particular, the entanglement present in
quantum states cannot be assumed to be independent of
the observer [2, 3].
In the past, several investigations of entanglement in
uniformly accelerating systems used nonlocalized Fock
states, see e.g. [3–5] and references therein. Therefore, it
was not clear how to obtain an operational meaning of en-
tanglement in these states. Furthermore, as pointed out
in [6, 7], it is questionable that these simpliﬁed models
capture the consequences of acceleration correctly. An-
other approach that is commonly used to study entangle-
ment in the Minkowski vacuum is employing accelerated
Unruh-de Witt detectors [8]. In these models, a two-level
system is linearly coupled to a scalar ﬁeld and the eﬀect
of ﬁnite time interactions is studied [9]. In particular,
it was shown that entanglement can be extracted from
vacuum correlations [10, 11]. The process of extracting
entanglement from the vacuum sometimes is referred to
as “entanglement harvesting” [12]. Since these eﬀects are
typically small, a direct observation is a challenging task.
However, analog systems to study these and related phe-
nomena were proposed [13–15]. Another approach to lo-
calize quantum states was taken in [6, 7, 16, 17]. Instead
of making use of Unruh-de Witt detectors, the modes
constituting the state itself were constructed to be local-
ized. That is also the approach we are following in this
work.
The goal of this work is to give a fully analytic treat-
ment of the eﬀect of acceleration on general localized
fermionic Gaussian states. These states are of great rel-
evance, as the class of fermionic Gaussian states con-
tains a broad variety of states such as vacuum states of
quadratic Hamiltonians, thermal states and Bell states.
Our approach is based on a method that was developed
to study bosonic two-mode Gaussian states of localized
wave packets [7]. Similarly to the bosonic case, we are
able to formulate the transformation connecting inertial
and accelerated observers as the action of a Gaussian
quantum channel.
The framework developed in this work is then used to
study the entanglement of the vacuum. In particular, we
quantify the amount of entanglement that could possi-
bly be harvested from the vacuum by local detectors and
show that it increases with increasing acceleration. Fur-
thermore, we are able to obtain the entanglement in Bell
states, a problem that attracted a lot of attention [3–5],
and show that this eﬀect is due to an inevitable mis-
match of the wave functions in Minkowski and Rindler
spacetime.
The structure of this work is the following. In Sec. II we
introduce the setting that we study in this work. In Sec.
III we calculate the transformation of general fermionic
Gaussian states for the case of two uniformly accelerated
observers with arbitrary accelerations. With these results
in hand, we study the vacuum entanglement in Sec. IV. In
particular, we compare our ﬁndings to the case of bosonic
Gaussian states. In Sec. V, we study the entanglement
in Bell states. Finally, we give the conclusions in Sec. VI.

FRAMEWORK
A.
Outline
As anticipated above, we study the eﬀect of accelera-
tion on spatially localized fermionic modes. These modes
are solutions of the equation of motion for the Dirac ﬁeld
ˆΨ. The Dirac equation is obtained by varying the action

where g denotes the determinant of the metric gµν, γµ
are the gamma matrices, m is the mass of the ﬁeld and
¯ˆΨ = ˆΨ†γ0. The ﬁeld can be expanded in a complete set of
solutions of the Dirac equation. Since we are interested in
modes that are suﬃciently localized, we choose to expand
ˆΨ in terms of localized wavepackets φ±
k . This gives the
expansion
ˆΨ =

(2)
in Minkowski space, where the ˆf †
k/ˆg†
k are the creation op-
erators for the wavepackets φ±
k of particles/antiparticles.
The Dirac equation dictates the anticommutativity of
the creation and annihilation operators; { ˆfk, ˆfl} = 0,
{ ˆf †
k, ˆf †
l } = 0 and { ˆfk, ˆf †
l } = δkl, where the same holds
for ˆgk and ˆg†
k with vanishing mixed anticommutators. Al-
ternatively, we can carry out an equivalent expansion in
Rindler space and obtain in terms of the respective cre-
ation and annihilation operators ˆd†
k/ˆe†
k and ˆdk/ˆek
ˆΨ =

(3)
Here the ψ±
k denote the respective wavepackets and the
ˆdk and ˆek satisfy the same algebra as the ˆfk and ˆgk.
Let Alice and Bob be two observers that are each in
possession of a (localized) mode of the fermion ﬁeld ˆΨ.
These modes have negligible overlap and we denote these
by φ+
I
and φ+
II, respectively. It follows that the corre-
sponding operators commute; [ ˆfI, ˆf †
II] = 0. Initially, these
modes are prepared in a fermionic Gaussian state ρ that
is completely characterized by its ﬁrst and second mo-
ments (covariance matrix). Then to describe the state
of the shared pair of modes from an accelerated perspec-
tive, Rindler space oﬀers a convenient reference frame.
The modes in both spacetimes are related to each other
by a Bogolyubov transformation. Hence, the Gaussian-
ity of state ρ is preserved under such a transformation.
The resulting state of Alice’s and Bob’s modes is thus
again a Gaussian of the transformed modes ψ±
I and ψ±
II.
As for bosons [7, 19], the map transforming the covari-
ance matrix of the inertial modes, into the state of the
accelerated modes, is a trace preserving Gaussian map
σ(f) →σ(d), which takes the form
σ(d) = Mσ(f)M T + N,
(4)
where M and N are 8 × 8 matrices [18] and we use the
superscripts (f) and (d) to indicate the modes that are
used to calculate the covariance matrix. One of the main
results of the present work is the exact analytic calcula-
tion of the matrices M and N for the generic case of two
uniformly accelerated observers.
B.
Fermionic Gaussian states
While bosonic Gaussian states are intensively stud-
ied in the context of quantum information and exten-
sive literature exists [20, 21], fermionic Gaussian states
are much less investigated. Therefore, we insert a brief
discussion of these states.
The most prominent mem-
bers of the family of fermionic Gaussian states are vac-
uum states of quadratic Hamiltonians, thermal states and
the Bell states. Even so fermionic Gaussian states share
some similarities with their bosonic counterparts, there
are crucial diﬀerences due to the anticommutativity of
fermions.
Starting from the creation and annihilation
operators ˆfk and ˆf †
k that satisfy the CAR algebra, i.e,
{ ˆfk, ˆfl} = 0 and { ˆfk, ˆf †
l } = δkl, we deﬁne the Majorana
fermion operators ˆck, as
ˆc2j−1 =
1
√
2( ˆf †
j + ˆfj),
ˆc2j =
1
i
√
2( ˆf †
j −ˆfj).
(5)
These form a Cliﬀord algebra
{ˆck, ˆcl} = δkl.
(6)
By deﬁnition, the density matrix of an even fermionic
Gaussian state can be written as
ρ = C e−i
2 ˆcT Aˆc,
(7)
where A is a real, antisymmetric matrix and C is the nor-
malization [18]. That is, these states are thermal states of
a quadratic Hamiltonian H = i
2ˆcT Aˆc. Upon an SO(2n)
transformation O with n being the number of Majorana
fermions ˆci, we can write the density matrix in the form
ρ = 1
2n
n
Y
k=1
 1 + iλkˆc′
2k−1ˆc′
2k

,
(8)
where the λi live in [−1, 1] and ˆc′ = OT ˆc. Further, using
the Bloch-Messiah reduction [22], we can ﬁnd a basis of
modes ˆhk such that every pure fermionic Gaussian state
can be written in the form
ρ =
n
Y
k=1

uk + vkˆh†
kˆh†
−k

,
(9)
where |uk|2 + |vk|2 = 1. Even Gaussian states are com-
pletely characterized by the corresponding covariance
matrix σkl [18]. The real antisymmetric covariance ma-
trix σkl for a Gaussian state ρ is given by
σkl = i Tr(ρ[ˆck, ˆcl]) = i⟨ˆckˆcl −ˆclˆck⟩.
(10)
The diagonal elements in (10) are vanishing due to the
commutator and the covariance matrix is completely
characterized by the elements
σkl = 2i⟨ˆckˆcl⟩,
with k > l.
(11)
All higher moments of ρ can be obtained by Wick’s the-
orem [18]. So far we concentrated on even states. While
these are completely characterized by σkl, the descrip-
tion of odd Gaussian states requires, in general, also the
knowledge of the ﬁrst moments
Tr(ρˆck) = ⟨ˆck⟩.
(12)

3
These are naturally vanishing for even states due to
the vanishing commutator with the parity operator P,
[P, ρ] = 0 [18].
More information regarding fermionic
Gaussian states and Gaussian linear maps can, for ex-
ample, be found in [23–27].
C.
Dirac ﬁeld in Rindler spacetime
We brieﬂy introduce solutions of the Dirac equation
that is obtained by varying action (1) with respect to
¯ˆΨ. For simplicity, we restrict our attention to the 1 + 1
dimensional case. However, the generalization to 3 + 1
dimensions is straightforward. Furthermore, we use units
such that c = ℏ= 1 throughout the entire work. We
start by deriving the solutions of the Dirac equation in
Minkowski coordinates (t, x). The Dirac equation takes
the form
i∂t ˆΨ = (−iα3∂x + mβ) ˆΨ,
(13)
where m denotes the mass of the ﬁeld and the matrices
β and α3 are given by
β =

(15)
where ωk =
√
k2 + m2. These are normalized as given in
(21). For further details, see [8]. Next, to describe the
physics of an accelerated observer [28, 29], we work in
Rindler coordinates
t =χ sinh(aη),
(16a)
x =χ cosh(aη),
(16b)
where a is a parameter that does not have an immediate
physical meaning. However, if we consider the worldline
of a particle with a proper acceleration A, namely χ = 1
A,
its proper time τ can be related to the coordinate time
η as Aτ = aη. In Rindler coordinates, the equation of
motion obtained from (1) is given by

and antiparticles respectively, one ﬁnds the normalized

Modes
Most of our calculations are general and do not depend
on the particular choice of modes. However, when con-
sidering concrete examples, namely in Sec. IV and Sec.
V, we have to make a speciﬁc choice. Physically, cavity
modes are suitable candidates for localized solutions. In
particular, motivated by the solutions obtained in [30],
for Λ ∈{I, II}, we consider the Minkowski modes

ization. As in [7], we use a Gaussian proﬁle to suﬃciently
localize the mode.
For the accelerated case, we choose wave packets of
particle solutions of the Dirac equation in Rindler space,
(17). Speciﬁcally, the localized modes we work with are

are plotted in Fig. 1.
The physical motivation for choosing localized cavity
modes is that these modes can possibly be detected by
a local detector (in our case a cavity). Therefore, the
choice of localized modes enables us to assign an oper-
ational meaning to quantities like entanglement.
Fur-
thermore, the modes (26) and (28) are purely positive
frequency solutions. This guarantees, that the average
particle and antiparticle numbers are zero in the Rindler
vacuum, as expected. In consequence, the modes do nec-
essarily have noncompact support. However, due to the
Gaussian proﬁle they are still suﬃciently localized.
III.
ACCELERATED FERMIONIC GAUSSIAN
STATES
In this section, we study the Bogolyubov transfor-
mation of fermionic Gaussian states relating modes in
Minkowski space to those of Rindler space. We give the
analytical solution for the general case of two uniformly
accelerated observers.
A.
Transformation of the Minkowski vacuum
To study the eﬀect of acceleration on the Minkowski
vacuum,
we restrict our attention to two localized
fermion modes with respective creation operators ˆf †
1 and

5
ˆf †
2. Then, using (5), we can write the corresponding Ma-
jorana operators ˆci as

(31)
From (10) it is clear that in the case of two modes, there
are six independent entries in the fermionic covariance
matrix. The same is true for the corresponding antipar-
ticles. Therefore, we ﬁnd the covariance matrix of the
Minkowski vacuum

where this expression describes two particle modes and

matrix of the Minkowski vacuum in the Rindler basis to

Transformation of general fermionic Gaussian
states
Using the results of the previous section, we derive the
transformation for general fermionic Gaussian states. We
recall that the transformed covariance matrix σ(d) can
be obtained using (4). Therefore, we can completely de-
scribe the transformation of general Gaussian states by
the two matrices M and N that we calculate in the fol-
lowing. To obtain M, we consider the transformation of
the ﬁrst moments (12). The Bogolyubov transformations
can be obtained from (22) and read

We now gathered all quantities that we need to specify
the transformation of a general Gaussian state character-
ized by ⟨ˆc(f)⟩and σ(f). First, we explicitly calculate the
noise matrix N. The matrix describing the noise arising
due to acceleration is given by
N = σ(d) −Mσ(f)

With the matrices M and N we now have all data that
is necessary to completely characterize the eﬀect of ac-

ing, we use the developed formalism to quantify vacuum
entanglement and, as a example of a nonvacuum state,
we study a maximally entangled state, the Bell state

VACUUM ENTANGLEMENT
A.
Vacuum entanglement for fermions
In this section, we study the entanglement in the vac-
uum as seen by an accelerated observer. As a measure
of entanglement we employ the logarithmic negativity.
In [31], it was shown that the partial transpose of a
fermionic Gaussian state is, in general, not Gaussian and
therefore it is diﬃcult to calculate the negativity exactly.
However, it was shown that a lower bound can be ob-
tained [31, 32]. Building on this construction, we derive
the respective bound ˜EN for our case in Appendix C. It
is given by
˜EN = ln(1
2(1 + N +
I N −
II + |N +
I,II|2+
+Re[
q
(N +
I −N −
II )2 −4|N +
I,II|2]+
+Im[
q
(N +
I −N −
II )2 −4|N +
I,II|2]))
(44)
where N +
I , N −
II and N +
I,II are the elements of the covari-
ance matrix (33) that are given by (35a) - (35c).
To obtain the entanglement of the vacuum, we choose
the modes as described in Sec. II D and solve (44) numer-
ically. We show the results for the entanglement between
two modes of diﬀerent accelerations in Fig. 2.
Firstly, it is important to emphasize that ˜EN is a lower
bound for the negativity and therefore it is diﬃcult to
make strong quantitative statements. However, it is rea-
sonable to assume that the actual value of the negativity
is close to the lower bound ˜EN . Therefore, in the follow-
ing, we refer to ˜EN as negativity, keeping this subtlety in
mind.
The entanglement between the state of a mode in
Rindler wedge I and its respective counterpart in wedge II
increases with increasing acceleration, see Fig. 2. For the
parameter regime we are interested in, the entanglement
is of the order 10−12, as measured by the logarithmic
negativity. That is, the particles that are produced due
to the Unruh eﬀect are correlated across the acceleration
horizon. Interestingly, the vacuum entanglement has an

by suitable detectors [10, 11].

Comparison to bosons
The aim of this section is to compare our results for
fermionic states to the results in the case of localized
modes of a massive scalar ﬁeld studied in [7]. For bosonic
Gaussian states the covariance matrix σ(d)
bos of the vacuum
takes the form
σ(d)

(46b)
where ψI, ψII are localized modes and the wI/IIΩare solu-
tions of the Klein-Gordon equation spanning the Hilbert
space for regions I and II, respectively.
The eﬀect of
acceleration on bosons is manifest in the covariance ma-
trix (45). While the Minkowski vacuum is described by
the covariance matrix σ(bos)
M
= I, for nonvanishing ac-
celeration, correlations build up and the oﬀ-diagonal el-
ements increase. As expected, the occupations are gov-
erned by the Bose-Einstein distribution that are explicit
in the matrix elements (46).
This contrasts with the
case of fermions where the occupation is characterized
by the Fermi-Dirac distribution, (35). Furthermore, due
to the presence of antiparticles for fermions, the corre-
lations that are build up in fermionic Gaussian states
are between particles and antiparticles, while for bosons
particles and antiparticles are identical.
Besides the diﬀerences outlined above, the results
for fermions qualitatively agree with the ﬁndings for
bosons.
Quantitatively, the entanglement we observed
for fermions is less than in the bosonic case.
In the
parameter regime we studied, bosons develop ten times
more entanglement [7].
However, one should keep in
mind that we were calculating a lower bound for the nega-
tivity and that the amount of entanglement also depends
on the explicit choice of modes.
In the next section, we go beyond vacuum entangle-
ment and study the degradation of entanglement for Bell
states.
V.
ENTANGLEMENT IN BELL STATES
Interestingly, Bell states of fermions are fermionic
Gaussian states, while maximally entangled states of two
bosons are nonGaussian. This fact, enables us to apply
our formalism to Bell states. Therefore, as an example for
a nonvacuum state, we consider a maximally entangled
state |B⟩of two particles in the following. We choose
|B⟩=
1
√
2(|00⟩+ |11⟩) =
1
√
2(1 + ˆf †
1 ˆf †
2)|0⟩.

This state is an even Gaussian state and it is described
by the following covariance matrix (cf. Appendix B 2)

(51)
where the ν± can be calculated from (49); cf. (C7) in
Appendix C.
We show the results for the entanglement of state |B⟩
in Fig. 3. For vanishing acceleration the modes are max-
imally entangled, while the entanglement decreases with
increasing acceleration. The constraint AL ≲1 that en-
sures that a single acceleration can be associated to a lo-
calized mode prevents us from studying arbitrarily large
accelerations.
The physical reason for the degradation of entangle-
ment is that the overlap between the inertial wavepack-
ets φ+
k and the accelerated ones ψ+
Ωdecreases with in-
creasing acceleration. This is an inevitable eﬀect of the
Bogolyubov transformation connecting Minkowski and
Rindler solutions.
Therefore, with increasing accelera-
tion the mismatch between the modes increases and the
entanglement in the initially maximally entangled Bell
state decreases.
Interestingly, the eﬀect of Unruh ra-
diation is negligibly small.
That is, the production of
thermal particles due to the Unruh eﬀect has only a very
small eﬀect to entanglement degradation of states of lo-
calized modes.
VI.
CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we developed a general framework to de-
scribe the eﬀect of acceleration on arbitrary fermionic
Gaussian states of two localized modes. We formulated
the transformation between the quantum state seen by
initial observers and the state seen by uniformly acceler-
ated ones as the action of a fermionic Gaussian channel,
and completely characterized this channel. This enabled
us to study how the entanglement of the vacuum and the
entanglement in Bell states is aﬀected by acceleration.
We found that vacuum entanglement is enhanced by
acceleration.
That is, the correlations in the vacuum
that build up due to the Unruh eﬀect lead to entangle-
ment between particles and antiparticles. In particular,
as our framework is employing localized modes, entangle-
ment has an operational meaning and can be extracted
by suitable local detectors; a process that is sometimes
referred to as “entanglement harvesting”. We also com-
pare these ﬁndings with the case of bosons [7] and ﬁnd a
qualitative agreement.
Furthermore, we quantiﬁed the entanglement degrada-
tion in a localized maximally entangled state of fermions.
The degradation is due to an increasing mismatch be-
tween the initial modes and the accelerated modes that
causes their overlap to decrease and, therefore, entangle-
ment decreases as well. The eﬀect of particle creation on
entanglement degradation is negligible.
We emphasize that due to the localization of the
modes, the framework presented in this work can be
applied to quantum information protocols, in scenarios

9
where local gravitational eﬀects or eﬀects due to acceler-
ation are not negligible. In particular, the entanglement
can be exploited as a resource.
For the future, we are interested in extending our stud-
ies to localized modes of fermions with arbitrary mutual
separation, as well as studying localized Gaussian states
in higher dimensional spacetimes.

Appendix A: Vacuum expectation values
We calculate the vacuum expectation values of the
Rindler creation and annihilation operators in the
Minkowski vacuum. Using the transformations between
the Minkowski and the Rindler vacuum given in (25), we
obtain for ⟨ˆbIΩˆb†
IΞ⟩M = ⟨S†ˆbIΩSS†ˆb†
IΞS⟩R
⟨ˆbIΩˆb†
IΞ⟩M = cos2(rΩ) δ(Ω−Ξ).

Similarly, we obtain for ⟨ˆbI†
ΩˆbI
Θ⟩M = ⟨S†ˆbI†
ΩSS†ˆbI
ΘS⟩R
⟨ˆb†
IΩˆbIΞ⟩M = sin2(rΩ) δ(Ω−Ξ).
(A2)
Considering operators in diﬀerent wedges, we ﬁnd
⟨ˆbIΩˆbIIΞ⟩M = 0.
(A3)
Also the remaining expectation values containing only
particle creation and annihilation operators are vanish-
ing. To summarize
⟨ˆbIΩˆbIIΞ⟩M = −⟨ˆbIIΩˆbIΞ⟩M = 0,
(A4a)
⟨ˆbIΩˆbIΞ⟩M =⟨ˆbIIΩˆbIIΞ⟩M = ⟨ˆb†

(A4e)
The same relations also hold after replacing particle by
antiparticle operators.
Finally, there are nonvanishing
correlations between particles/antiparticles in wedge I
and antiparticles/particles in wedge II. This manifests
in the vacuum expectation values
⟨ˆaIΩˆbIIΞ⟩M = −⟨ˆaIIΩˆbIΞ⟩M = cos(rΩ) sin(rΩ)δ(Ω−Ξ),
(A5)
⟨ˆbIΩˆaIIΞ⟩M = −⟨ˆbIIΩˆaIΞ⟩M = cos(rΩ) sin(rΩ)δ(Ω−Ξ).

Appendix B: Calculations of the covariance matrix
In this appendix, we give the details of the calculations
of the covariance matrices we used in this work.
1.
Calculation of the covariance matrix for the
Minkowski vacuum
The covariance matrix and the ﬁrst moments of the
Minkowski vacuum are obtained according to (10) and
(12), respectively. Due to the antisymmetry of the co-
variance matrix not all matrix elements are independent
and we are left with, in general, 1
2n(n −1) independent
entries for n being the dimension of the matrix. A short
calculation shows that, in the case of the Minkowski vac-
uum, the only nontrivial elements of the covariance ma-
trix originate in terms of the kind

and the ﬁrst moments vanish, as
the vacuum is an even state.
2.
Calculation of the covariance matrix for even
Bell states
The covariance matrix of the even Bell state |B⟩, given
in (47), is derived as
σ(f)
kl =2i⟨B|ˆckˆcl|B⟩,
=i⟨0|ˆckˆcl|0⟩+ i⟨0| ˆfII ˆfIˆckˆcl ˆf †

I ˆf †
II|0⟩+ i⟨0| ˆfII ˆfIˆckˆcl|0⟩.
(B3)
We give the calculation term by term. The ﬁrst one just
gives us 1
2 times the vacuum matrix. Further, we need

10
to calculate the following vacuum expectation values
i⟨0|ˆckˆcl ˆf †
I ˆf †

for k = 3, l = 1
i⟨0|ˆckˆcl ˆf †

for k = 4, l = 1
i⟨0|ˆckˆcl ˆf †
I ˆf †
II|0⟩= −i
2,
for k = 4, l = 2
(B4)
Similarly, we ﬁnd
i⟨0| ˆfII ˆfIˆckˆcl|0⟩= −i
2,
for k = 3, l = 1
i⟨0| ˆfII ˆfIˆckˆcl|0⟩= −1

for k = 3, l = 2
i⟨0| ˆfII ˆfIˆckˆcl|0⟩= −1
2,
for k = 4, l = 1
i⟨0| ˆfII ˆfIˆckˆcl|0⟩= i

for k = 4, l = 2
(B5)
and
i⟨0| ˆfII ˆfIˆc2ˆc1 ˆf †

2,
(B6)
where the same holds for i⟨0| ˆfII ˆfIˆc4ˆc3 ˆf †
I ˆf †

remaining ones are vanishing. Combining the above, we
obtain for the covariance matrix of particles and their
corresponding antiparticles

Calculation of the covariance matrix for the
transformed Minkowski vacuum
In this subsection, we calculate the transformed covari-
ance matrix σ(d)
kl = 2i⟨ˆckˆcl⟩. Using results for the vacuum
expectations values from Appendix A, we ﬁnd
⟨ˆdI ˆd†
I⟩=
Z
dΩ|(ψ+
I , w+
IΩ)|2 cos2(rΩ).
(B8)
Expressing (10) in terms of the operators ˆdk, we obtain
σ(d)
12 = 1 −2
Z
dΩ|(ψ+
I , w+
IΩ)|2 sin2(rΩ).
(B9)
Similarly, we obtain the remaining matrix elements to be
σ(d)
71 =2

dΩIm[(ψ−
I , w−
IΩ)(ψ+
II, w+
IIΩ)]F(rΩ),

σ(d)

dΩIm[(ψ−
I , w−
IΩ)(ψ+
II, w+
IIΩ)]F(rΩ), (B10)
where we used the deﬁnition F(rΩ) = cos(rΩ) sin(rΩ).
Replacing particles by antiparticles and vice versa in the
above equations, one obtains the elements σ(d)
53 , σ(d)
54 , σ(d)
63 ,
and σ(d)
64 .
Due to the antisymmetry of the covariance
matrix and the symmetry between wedges I and II, these
are all independent nonzero entries. Therefore, we arrive
at (33).
Appendix C: Logarithmic negativity
Given a fermionic Gaussian state ρ with covariance
matrix σ, we deﬁne Γ =

Γ11 Γ12
Γ21 Γ22

= iσ. Then the
partially transposed state can be written as sum of two
Gaussian states O±
ρpT = 1 −i
2
O+ + 1 + i
2
O−,
(C1)
where the covariance matrices of the O± are Γ+ =

Γ11
iΓ12
iΓ21 −Γ22

and Γ−=

Γ11
−iΓ12
−iΓ21
−Γ22

, respec-
tively [31]. If [Γ+, Γ−] = 0 holds, the logarithmic neg-
ativity E can be calculated exactly. One example of such
states are the isotropic states for which Γ2 = −λ21 holds
[33]. As we see that does not hold for the transformed
vacuum state.
We consider the vacuum covariance matrix (34) that
we rescale by i, i.e., Γ(vac) = iσ(d). To obtain the log-
arithmic negativity we have to partially transpose the
density matrix. It is of the form (C1). Accordingly, we
deﬁne Γ+ and Γ−as above. Then calculating the com-
mutator [Γ+, Γ−], we ﬁnd [Γ+, Γ−] ̸= 0 and we cannot
calculate the logarithmic negativity exactly. If O+ and
O−commute they can be diagonalized simultaneously
and we ﬁnd that the eigenvalues of O+ and O−are com-
plex conjugate to each other. What is left to do is to ﬁnd
the eigenvalues of O+ given Γ+. We denote the eigenval-
ues of Γ+ by ±νs and write O+ as
O+ =
Y
s=±
1 + iνsˆhs
1ˆhs
2
2
,
(C2)
where the ˆh±
j are the Majorana operators obtained from
the ˆcj via the operation diagonalizing Γ+.
Then the

11
eigenvalues of O+ are given by
ωss′ = 1
4(1 + sν+)(1 + s′ν−).
(C3)
To study the vacuum entanglement, we have ﬁrst to ﬁnd
the eigenvalues ±νs of Γ+, where we restrict ourselves to
the entanglement between particles I and antiparticles II
(the entanglement between antiparticles I and particles
II is analogous). Γ(vac)

From these we can write the eigenvalues of O+ as
ω++ =1
4(1 + ν+ + ν−+ ν+ν−),
ω−−=1
4(1 −ν+ −ν−+ ν+ν−),
ω+−=1
4(1 + ν+ −ν−−ν+ν−),
ω−+ =1
4(1 −ν+ + ν−−ν+ν−)
(C6)
and a lower bound for the entanglement can be obtained
[31]. It is given by
EN ≥˜EN = ln
 1 −2 Tro ρpT
= ln
 Tre ρpT −Tro ρpT
= ln(Re[ Tre O+ −Tro O+]+
+Im[ Tre O+ −Tro O+]),
(C7)
where Tre/o denotes the trace over the even and odd sub-
spaces, respectively. We next calculate Tre O+ −Tro O+
that can be given in terms of the eigenvalues ω as
Tre O+ −Tro O+ =
X
s,s′
Ss,s′ωss′
(C8)
with
Ss,s′ = Re[ls,s′] + Im[ls,s′],
(C9)
where ls,s′ = 1 for s = s′ and ls,s′ = is for s = −s′.
Thus, we ﬁnd
Tre O+ −Tro O+ =
X
s,s′
Ss,s′ωss′
=1
2(1 + ν+ν−+ ν+ −ν−)
(C10)
and, therefore, we obtain the lower bound
