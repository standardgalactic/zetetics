Abstract
We perturbatively calculate classical radiation in Yang-Mills theory and dilaton gravity, to
next-to-leading order in couplings. The radiation is sourced by the scattering of two relativistic
massive scalar sources with the dynamical eﬀect taken into account, corresponding to the post-
Minkowskian regime in gravity. We show how to arrange the Yang-Mills radiation such that
the duality between color and kinematics is manifest, including the three-term Jacobi identity.
The search for duality-satisfying expressions exploits an auxiliary bi-adjoint scalar theory as
a guide for locality. The double copy is obtained by replacing the color factors in Yang-Mills
with kinematic counterparts, following Bern-Carrasco-Johansson construction in S-matrix. On
the gravity side, the radiation is directly computed at the third post-Minkowskian order with
massive sources. We ﬁnd perfect agreement between observables in dilaton gravity and the
Yang-Mills double copy. This non-trivially generalizes the leading-order rules by Goldberger
and Ridgway. For the ﬁrst time, the kinematic Jacobi identity appears beyond ﬁeld-theory
S-matrix, suggesting that the color-kinematics duality holds more generally. Our results oﬀer
a path for simplifying analytical calculations in post-Minkowskian regime.

Introduction
After a century of eﬀort, gravity remains at the heart of modern physics. The enormous complexity
in gravity, even in the classical level, is one of the obstructions for making advances. This can be
seen from the non-linear nature in Einstein-Hilbert action which limits the space of exact solutions
and the range of perturbative orders. The need for a better theoretical understanding is particularly
urgent, after the breakthrough of gravitational wave detection [1].
Seeking insights for unraveling gravity from ﬁeld theory has a long history. A classic example
by Kawai, Lewellen and Tye (KLT) [2] is that a closed string can be related to a product of open
strings. In the low-energy limit, the KLT relation implies that gravity can be viewed as a square of
Yang-Mills theory (YM). Crucially, the hidden connection between gravity and YM is manifest at
the level of the S-matrix, which is physical and free from the gauge artifacts.
The connection between gravity and YM has gone deeper after the seminal work by Bern,
Carrasco, and Johansson (BCJ) [3, 4]. They start with a YM amplitude whose color factors Ci of
cubic diagrams are related by
Ci ± Cj = 0
Ci ± Cj ± Ck = 0
(1)
from the anti-symmetry of structure constants and Jacobi identity. A sharp conjecture by BCJ is
that the kinematic numerators, when expanded in cubic diagrams, can be made to satisfy the same
generic algebraic relations,
Ci ± Cj = 0
↔
Ni ± Nj = 0
Ci ± Cj ± Ck = 0
↔
Ni ± Nj ± Nk = 0
(2)
which goes by the name color-kinematics duality. Given their similarity, we replace color numera-
tors Ci with duality-satisfying representations Ni. The resulting amplitude, with two copies of Ni,
magically becomes a gravitational amplitude! By manifesting the duality between color and kine-
matics, the BCJ double copy generalizes the KLT relations to quantum level. Many gauge theories
are shown to have color-kinematics duality, including various matter contents and supersymmetries
at both tree and loop levels. Their double copies agree with a variety of gravitational theories. See
Ref. [5, 6] and references therein. Apart from conceptually intriguing, the complexity of gravity is
tremendously simpliﬁed into YM degrees of freedom via the double copy, which is the key behind
multi-loop gravity calculations [4, 7–21].
Can the double-copy idea really simplify calculation in gravity beyond the vanilla S-matrix, and
possibly illuminate gravitational wave physics? This is initiated in Ref. [22] by studying the Kerr-
Schild solutions in gravity which can be linked to gauge theory. Such similarities between gravity and
gauge theory have been extended further [23–29]. The double-copy structure of classical radiation
3

as Bremsstrahlung has been studied in various theories [25, 27, 30–36].
A squaring relation in
curved spacetime among three-point amplitudes has been also found recently [37]. All the studies
so far have restricted to either known exact solutions, which are diﬃcult to ﬁnd in gravity, or to
leading order in perturbative solutions. In contrast, the power of double copy in S-matrix goes far
beyond the simplest examples at three point. To show double copy is indeed promising, we have to
establish an example beyond the leading-order approximation.
The classical radiation as perturbative solutions in worldline formalism is particularly promising
for further studies [30–36]. First, there is still a notion of on-shell emission amplitudes as gauge-
invariant observables. Based on the success of S-matrix program, where the hidden connections
are discovered from physical quantities, any double-copy structure should be revealed ﬁrst in ob-
servables. Second, the perturbative regime is standard in worldline formalism. The observables
are available by brute-force calculation, so we can test the double-copy structure at higher orders.
Moreover, the worldline formalism directly gives results in the classical limit. Any progress made
here can be readily applied to general relativity.
Taking classical limit is not as trivial as we might think.
The meaning of classical limit is
two-fold. The obvious one is to set ℏ→0. A common belief is that classical limit corresponds to
tree-level approximation. While the statement is true for massless theories, it becomes subtle for
massive particles because loop diagrams still contain classical pieces by the inhomogeneous scaling
of propagators under the ℏ→0 limit [38, 39]. On top of this, the classical limit also forbids anti-
particles from being present. Given these two subtleties, it is non-trivial to extract classical limit
from a ﬁeld-theory calculation. The endeavor of applying S-matrix techniques to general relativity
is still an active area of research [40–53]. The worldline formalism is therefore advantageous because
both can be implemented straightforwardly.
In this paper we calculate classical radiation in YM and dilaton gravity to next-to-leading order,
with a particular focus on their double-copy structure. The gravitational theory considered here
is dilaton gravity, which contains a dilaton minimally coupled in gravity. It is the expected grav-
itational theory by double copying YM. The system is comprised of two massive scalar particles,
with arbitrary mass ratio and initial velocities, as long as the impact parameter is much larger
than Schwarzschild radius. (Details will be discussed in Section 2.) After the two point sources
pass through each other, classical radiation is measured by an observer at spatial inﬁnity. This
corresponds to the post-Minkowskian regime in gravity [54–63], where a scattering process is cal-
culated order-by-order in Newton constant GN. The scattering angle at the second order has been
computed by Westpfahl [62]. From the ﬁeld theory point of view, this is an inelastic scattering of
two scalars with a graviton in the ﬁnal state. Our results should be comparable to the one-loop
integrand in the aforementioned classical limit. It should be distinguished from the post-Newtonian
approximation of a bounded, rather than scattering, binary system where the perturbation is done
around small velocities. (A suitable ﬁeld-theory framework for post-Newtonian system would be the
4

eﬀective ﬁeld theory constructed in Ref. [64].) Although the scattering scenario might not occur as
often as inspiral black holes in astrophysics, it has been applied as inputs to the eﬀective one-body
formalism which could be useful for simulating binary black holes [65–68].
At next-to-leading order, the three-term Jacobi identity begins to appear among the color factors
in YM. Whether a kinematic version of Jacobi identity exists becomes a non-trivial test of color-
kinematics duality. Although the systems we investigated are still scattering processes, classical
radiation has a very diﬀerent structure than ﬁeld-theory S-matrix, rooted from the non-trivial
classical limit discussed above. In particular, the locality structure is scrambled under the classical
limit. This makes double copy challenging because one of its pillars is the preservation of locality by
maintaining the propagators. To expose color-kinematics duality, we exploit an auxiliary bi-adjoint
scalar theory (BS) as a guide. The double copy construction is then formulated in a suitable fashion
for worldline formalism. Despite many diﬀerence in details, the kinematic numerators in YM can
still be arranged to satisfy the same algebraic relation as color factors as Eq. (2), including
Ci ± Cj ± Ck = 0
↔
Ni ± Nj ± Nk = 0
(3)
as the ﬁrst example of kinematic Jacobi identity beyond ﬁeld-theory S-matrix. Despite all such
complications, it is still striking that the core of color-kinematics duality in Eq. (2) remains to hold.
After establishing color-kinematics duality, we ﬁnd the on-shell classical radiation agrees per-
fectly between dilaton gravity and the double copy of YM. Already at the level of action, the
complexity in gravity is much more signiﬁcant than YM and BS. Direct computation in gravity
then leads to an explosion in the number of terms in the ﬁnal expression. However, the success of
color-kinematics duality simpliﬁes a complicated expression in the gravity amplitude AGR as
ABS
˜Ci→Ni

AYM

(4)
by using the bi-adjoint scalar amplitude ABS supplemented with duality-satisfying representation
Ni from YM. This opens the avenue to extend the power of color-kinematics duality to perturbative
solutions in classical gravity.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
We introduce the backgrounds in Section 2,
including a review on worldline formalism and double copy construction. A summary of calcu-
lation is given in Section 3. Most of the next-to-leading order results are lengthy and thus are
provided as ancillary ﬁles to this work’s arXiv submission, ym_pos_NLO.m, ym_radiation_NLO.m,
gr_pos_NLO.m, gr_dilaton_NLO.m and gr_radiation_NLO.m, whose deﬁnitions can be found in
Appendix A and B. After the calculation is done, we discuss color-kinematics duality in Section 4,
including the BCJ and KLT amplitude relations. We conclude in Section 5.

Setups
This section introduces the necessary backgrounds before we go to next-leading-order calculations.
The ﬁrst two sections contains a review of the worldline formalism used in Ref. [30, 31], in a fashion
that is readily applicable for higher order calculations. The last part is devoted to be a compact
review of color-kinematics duality and double copy.
2.1
Actions and Equations of Motion
The systems we consider in this paper consist of point particles and radiation ﬁelds, which are
described by worldlines and ﬁeld theories respectively. For example, in Yang-Mills theory we have
point particles with trajectory and color charge degrees of freedom along the worldlines, as well as
the gauge ﬁeld mediating the interaction. The dynamics is compactly encoded in the full action
S = Spp + SBS/YM/GR
as a combination of the point-particle action Spp and the ﬁeld-theory part SBS/YM/GR, whose details
depend on the theories. While the worldline degrees of freedom only appear in Spp, the ﬁelds couple
to both the worldline and the ﬁelds themselves. The actions are usually ﬁxed by power-counting
and symmetries in the system. Once the action is given, the classical equations of motion (EoM)
follow straightforwardly. Let us discuss YM, dilaton gravity, and ﬁnally BS in turn.

ν as the non-Abelian ﬁeld strength.1 The ﬁeld-theory action in YM is
standard. The ﬁrst term in the worldline action is also standard for a free particle. In the second
term, ψ(τ) is the color wave function on the worldline which transforms linearly under the gauge
group. The point particle couples to the gauge ﬁeld via the color charge ca = ψ†T aψ. Note that
the worldline action manifests the reparametrization and gauge invariance, and is the leading term
with lowest number of derivatives. The action can also be derived from current conservation [30].
To make the notation more in line with particle physics, from now on we rescale the worldline
parameter τ ′ = τ/m for each worldline, and pµ = mvµ.
1Other relevant conventions are [T a, T b] = if abcT c, tr(T aT b) = δab/2, and the adjoint generator (T a

c = −if abc.

The EoM then follow from the least action principle. For the position and color of a point
particle, we have

where the gauge ﬁeld is evaluated at the worldline position xµ(τ ′). We emphasize that xµ(τ ′), pµ(τ ′),
and ca(τ ′) are the full time-dependent variables and are distinct from the initial conditions used later
in perturbative solutions. After adding a Fadeev-Popov gauge ﬁxing term SGF = −

We use Sint to denote all interactions in the ﬁeld-theory action. The gauge ﬁeld is also sourced by
all the present point particles which we now explicitly sum over. Without the point sources, the
EoM is Berends-Giele recursion relation for tree-level amplitudes [69].
Dilaton Gravity
The minimal action for a point particle in gravity is −m2 R dτ ′. The form of
the action is ﬁxed by power counting and reparametrization invariance. However, in the presence of
dilaton φ we can dress this action with arbitrary function of φ and still maintain reparametrization
and diﬀeomorphism invariance. The speciﬁc coupling we need to match the double copy of YM is
Spp = −m2

dτ ′eκφ

where the gravitational coupling κ2 = 32πGN = 1/md−2

which is the usual Einstein-Hilbert action plus a minimally coupled dilaton.2
The geodesic equation of a point particle is

(12)
where Γµ
ρσ is Christtoﬀel symbol and all the ﬁelds are evaluated at xµ(τ ′). Note that we have applied
gµνpµpν = m2 as a conserved quantity to simplify the above equation. To derive the EoM for ﬁelds,
the metric is expanded around ﬂat space, gµν = ηµν + κhµν. From now on, the indices are raised

and lowered by ﬂat metric unless otherwise noted. As in YM, we also need a gauge-ﬁxing term
SGF =
R ddx (∂µhµ

as the collection of all interacting terms in EoM. The ﬁrst term corresponds to the energy-momentum
in spacetime, which can be expanded into an inﬁnite tower of vertices comprised of gravitons and
dilatons, and the second term is the energy-momentum of the point particles.
It is conserved,
∂µ ˜T µν = 0, and can be interpreted as the tadpole term in the background ﬁeld gauge eﬀective
action [64]. Similarly, the full EoM for dilaton reads
√ggµνDµ Dνφ = −

(15)
Note that the left hand side of the above contains the □φ in ﬂat space and a tower of dilaton-graviton
interactions, which will be moved to the right-hand side when solving the EoM perturbatively.
Although the procedure to ﬁnd EoM seems straightforward, in practice it is daunting to expand
the Einstein-Hilbert action and even the leading-order three-point vertex is barely tractable by
hand, not to mention that this is only at the level of the EoM.3 In contrast, the entire EoM for
YM are summarized in Eq. (6), (7), (8), and (9). The potential advantage of the double-copy
construction should be clear hereafter.
Bi-adjoint Scalar Theory
The bi-adjoint theory is motivated as a cousin of YM which has
two copies of global color symmetries. The bi-adjoint scalar φa˜a carries the adjoint indices a and
˜a for the color and the dual color group respectively. The point sources are charged under both
symmetries and interact via the bi-adjoint scalar. The action is the sum of

mass dimension of the coupling y. The full EoM are simply

where all scalar ﬁelds in worldline EoM are evaluated at xµ(τ ′) as before.
2.2
Perturbation and Observables
The EoM derived in previous section are general. In this paper we solve these EoM perturbatively
around a small coupling constant. The zeroth order solution corresponds to a free particle with
straight line trajectory and stationary (dual) color charge, when applicable. All radiation ﬁelds are
turned oﬀat zeroth order. We parametrize the worldline degrees of freedom as
xµ
i (τ ′
i) = bµ
i + pµ
i τ ′ + δxµ
i
(21)
ca
i (τ ′
i) = ca
i + δca
i
(22)
and similarly for the dual color charge. Here bµ
i , pµ
i , and ca
i are the initial conditions at τ ′ →−∞.
The perturbation is then encoded in δxµ
i and δca
i , whose time dependence are not shown, and
the radiation ﬁeld as a series expansion in coupling constants. This perturbation regime crucially
set the zeroth order as free particles with straight line trajectories, corresponding to the post-
Minkowskian regime of gravity. As we emphasize in the introduction, this should be distinct from
the non-relativistic perturbation of bound states, e.g., the post-Newtonian regime of binary systems.
Nevertheless, these solutions are still strictly classical and readily applicable to general relativity.
With the zeroth order sources, we can plug into the radiation EoM to ﬁnd the ﬁelds at next
order. For example, Eq. (9) yields the gauge ﬁeld emitted from the zeroth order charge ca and
momentum pµ of a particle

(23)
as illustrated in Figure 1a. This is not yet the physical radiation at leading order for reasons we
will explain soon. This can then be plugged into into Eq. (6) and (7) to yield the deviation from
straight trajectory and static color charge.

with all higher order terms neglected.4 We can ﬁnd the trajectory deviation by integrating the
above twice from past inﬁnity to the present time. This can easily be done because the only time
dependence comes from the phase of free particle trajectory. With the boundary condition imposed
by k · p →(k · p + iϵ), this yields trajectory deviation at leading order

by plugging the ﬁeld strength in Eq. (23). The corresponding diagram is shown in as Figure 1b.
The time dependence of δxµ entirely resides in the phase e−ik·(b+pτ ′). The convenience of scattering
processes is that solving the EoM is equivalent to dressing the “propagator” −1/(ik·p). The position
EoM is second order in time so there is a double propagator. For color charge there is only a single
propagator because its EoM is ﬁrst order,

The form of this propagator is indeed related to the propagator 1/((p + k)2 −m2) in ﬁeld theory
by taking the classical limit [32]. The presence of both double and single propagator is one of the
challenges to make the double copy work directly in the classical limit.
Let us pause for a moment and examine the small parameters used for perturbative expansions
in these theories. There are several relevant quantities in the system: the typical size of impact

10

parameters b, the energy of the particles E ≳m, the color charges c and ˜c, and ﬁnally the coupling
constants. The typical scale of the radiation momentum is then set by 1/b. Applying the power
counting to Eq. (25), we can see the deﬂection δxµ ≪b if

is neglected
from the above formulae.
The deviation on color charge is also under control if c ∼˜c ∼Eb.
Finally, we demand the angular momentum Eb ≫ℏsuch that the quantum eﬀect, namely pure
graviton loop, does not enter. Overall this implies the impact parameter should be much larger
than Schwarschild radii of the sources.
We can calculate higher order results by iteration. The diﬀerences from the above are that the
ﬁelds can self-interact, and the sources are not static anymore. The latter not only corresponds to
substituting the initial momentum and color charges into higher order perturbations, but an extra
phase from trajectory deviation. As we have seen the radiation is naturally solved in momentum
space, as in Eq. (23), while the point particles naturally live in real space. Therefore we have to
Fourier transform back and forth between the worldline and radiation. To see this, the part of YM

contain the phase e±ik·δxi from the path correction which is then expanded order by order. The
calculation would not be consistent without this phase included. This phase makes the locality
highly scrambled particularly at higher orders. For instance, at next-to-leading order we have to
include e−ik·δx ∝(−ik · δx)2 with δx being the leading-order path deviation. The leading-order
path deviation contains the propagator δx ∝1/(lj · p)2 where lj is the momentum of radiation
inducing the path change. The propagator structure of (−ik · δx)2 is then 1/(lj · p)2(li · p)2 from
radiation sourced by particle i and j. It is diﬃcult to assign a Feynman diagram to reproduce such
pole structure along the line of Ref. [32]. Therefore we will calculate the radiation via algebraically
solving the equations of motion from now on.
Nevertheless, the worldline formalism is well-established and we can push to higher orders di-
rectly. It is helpful to streamline the structures of kinematic constraints beforehand. The radiation

Z
i =
Z
ddli
(2π)d 2πδ(pi · li) eilibi
(33)
This summarizes the pattern in Eq. (23) as n = 0, the leading-order results in Ref. [30, 31, 33–36] as
n = 1, and the next-to-leading-order results in this paper as n = 2. Let us go through each element
in turn. At the order O(g2n+1), the sources inserted are labeled by i ranging from 1 to n + 1. Each
source can absorb or emit radiation as we include the back reaction. The corresponding phase space
is integrated with the phase shift and kinematic constraint δ(pi ·li) in Eq. (33). The phase shift and
kinematic constraint is universal for the following reasons. As we see in Eq. (31) and likewise for
color charge, the absorption of momentum li will induce a phase e−ili·(bi+piτ ′
i). On the other hand,
the emission in Eq. (30) also gives rise to a phase of opposite sign. So if li is the net momentum
emitted by a worldline i, overall the time-independent part of phase shift is eili·bi. Moreover, the
time-dependent part of the phase shift yields the kinematic constraint pi · li = 0 for each worldline,
after integrating the proper time from past inﬁnity to future inﬁnity. The kinematic constraint can
be easily understood as the on-shell condition (pi −li)2 −m2
i = 0 of the point particle in classical
limit [32]. The overall momentum conservation relates radiation momentum k to the total net
momentum emission by worldlines P
i li. Finally, if there are more than n sources in the system,
we have to sum over permuting the labeling of n external sources into other possible combinations.
For instance, there are two source insertions for n = 1. The permutation sum then corresponds to
the sum over all possible pairs of particles in the system.
Analogous to radiation, we can also parametrize the degrees of freedom on a worldline (labeled
with subscript 1) as a sum over perturbation in coupling

For order O(g2n), the worldline deviation is induced by sources from i = 2, 3, · · · n and ltot = Pn

is the total radiation momentum absorbed by the worldline. If there are more than n particles in the
system, the permutation sums over all the possible source insertions. Note the time dependences
of both functions entirely lie in the phase e−i ltot·(b1+p1τ ′).
We are only interested in the observables measured by an apparatus at spatial inﬁnity. The
observable can be extracted by imposing retarded boundary condition, 1/k2 = 1/((k0 + iϵ)2 −⃗k2).
12

To propagate the ﬁeld to inﬁnity, it amounts to localize the ﬁeld at pole k2 = 0 when integrating
out the radiation momentum k [73]. Let us consider the gauge ﬁeld measured by a distant observer
in four dimension. Similar formulae apply to other type of ﬁelds in general dimension. For an
observer at distance r and direction ⃗n, we have
A±a(t,⃗n) =
1
4πr
Z dω
2π e−iωtr lim
k2→0
h
−k2 
e±
µ · Aµa(k)
i
(35)
where tr is the retarded time and kµ = (ω,⃗k) is the momentum 4-vector with spacial direction
aligned with ⃗n.
Taking the residue imposes the on-shell condition k2 = 0 shown above.
This
explains why the gauge ﬁeld in Eq. (23) is not yet the leading-order radiation, because the on-shell
condition does not have support on the kinematic constraint δ(k · p). We also need to project into
the two helicity states in four dimension via a polarization vector, which satisﬁes the transverse
condition k · e± = 0 and normalized, e± · e∗
± = −1. It is easy calculate the energy momentum and
angular momentum transmitted by the radiation once we have the above. So the ﬁnal radiation is
only relevant up to the on-shell and transverse conditions.
In sum, the radiation is given order by order as Eq. (32). The explicit formulae for BS and
dilaton gravity are provided in Eq. (43) and Eq. (58). The oﬀ-shell currents are rational function
of the initial conditions and momentum emitted by each worldline insertion, analogous to the loop
integrand in S-matrix. Given oﬀ-shell currents with momentum k, the emission amplitudes read
ABS(n) = lim
k2→0 J a˜a(n)
AYM(n) = lim
k2→0 eµ · J µa(n)
Ah(n) = lim
k2→0 eµν · J µν(n)
Aφ(n) = lim
k2→0 J (n)
(36)
with the on-shell condition imposed. The (dual) color indices are omitted in the emission amplitudes.
In generic dimension, the polarization vector for YM satisﬁes k·e = 0. For gravity, the polarization is
symmetric, transverse, and traceless, kµeµν = eµ
µ = 0. These on-shell amplitudes are gauge-invariant
objects where the double copy applies.
2.3
Color and Kinematics
Let us ﬁrst review the color-kinematics duality and double copy in ﬁeld theory. A tree-level ampli-
tude in Yang-Mills can be expressed as
X
i
CiNi
Di
(37)
where Ci and Ni is the respective color and kinematic numerator, and the propagator denominator
Di associated with cubic diagram i. Note that the color and propagators are one-to-one to a cubic
13

diagram which will not be the case for classical radiation. There is an intrinsic ambiguity in Ni
because the Yang-Mills theory has a quartic vertex. The Yang-Mills amplitude is the gauge invariant
under the sum over diﬀerent diagrams, which are related by color identities in Eq. (1). Crucially
the gauge invariance only relies on these algebraic relations, regardless of details in color factors.
A remarkable observation by Bern, Carrasco, and Johansson is that the double copy relation is
manifest through the color-kinematics duality in Eq. (2). If we replace color factors with kinematic
numerators
Ci →Ni,
(38)
then a YM amplitude in Eq. (37) becomes
X
i
NiNi
Di
,
(39)
which turns out to be an amplitude in gravity! This miraculous connection is based on two pillars—
locality and gauge invariance.
The locality structure, encoded in the propagators, is preserved
during the double copy construction.5 Second, the gauge invariance relies on the color identities,
which are obeyed by the kinematic numerators in Eq. (2). Therefore the gauge invariance is not only
preserved in Eq. (39) as the original YM, but is enhanced to (linearized) diﬀeomorphism invariance
in gravity via double-copy structure. Being both local and gauge invariant, the double copy is
justiﬁed as a gravitational amplitude which can be proven rigorously [8, 74].
The success of double copy hinges on the color-kinematics duality. However, it is far from obvious
that such duality-satisfying representation exists. In particular, the Jacobi identity imposes non-
trivial constraints on the numerators.
The existence of such representation, the so-called BCJ
numerators, has been proven at tree level but remains to be a conjecture beyond this. Even the
existence is known, ﬁnding explicit expression for BCJ numerators requires non-trivial eﬀort. See
Ref [5, 6] for more details.
Many features of double copy can be learned by studying the bi-adjoint scalar amplitude
X
i
Ci ˜Ci
Di
(40)
where we replace the kinematic numerators in YM with dual color factors [5, 6]. The bi-adjoint
scalar theory shares the same traits as any other theories with color-kinematics duality. For instance,
the color-stripped amplitudes, which are the amplitudes when we project Eq. (40) to a minimal
basis of color factors, are still dependent under the so-called BCJ amplitude relations. When we
stripped both color factors and remove the redundancies from amplitude relations, these doubly
stripped amplitudes form a matrix whose inverse becomes the KLT kernel. The very same kernel
allows us to double copy from YM to gravity directly at the level of amplitudes. We will see that
bi-adjoint scalar theory plays an important role in worldline formalism as well.
5More generally, double-copy construction can still hold even with non-local numerators.
14

The gravity amplitude obtained from YM double copy is not just Einstein gravity, but contains
other ﬁelds called factorized gravity.6 From degrees of freedom counting in little group, it is obvious
that the YM double copy contains more than the usual graviton. Speciﬁcally, if we use the polar-
ization eµ and ˜eν for each of the YM copy, the resulting polarization eµ˜eν in gravity is factorized
which can be decomposed as three terms
eµ˜eν = 1
2

eµ˜eν + ˜eµeν −2 e · ˜e
d −2Pµν

+ 1
2 (eµ˜eν −˜eµeν) + e · ˜e
d −2Pµν,
(41)
where Pµν = ηµν −(kµqν + qµkν) /k · q is a projector transverse to momentum kµ and a light-like
reference qµ.7 The ﬁrst term is symmetric and traceless, and thus corresponds to the usual graviton.
The second one corresponds to an anti-symmetric two-form, and the trace part from the last term
gives a dilaton. If the two-form is not present, we have a theory with graviton and dilaton whose
action is given by Eq. (11). Although it is possible to double copy gauge theories into Einstein
gravity, as demonstrated [16, 32], we only consider dilaton gravity in this work as an initial study
at next-to-leading order.

Summary of Calculation
We now proceed to calculate radiation at higher order in various theories. At the next-to-leading
order, corresponding to ﬁfth power in coupling constant, there are three source insertions for ra-
diation with n = 1, 2, 3. Without loss of generality, we can ﬁrst treat the third insertion as an
independent third body, with its own initial momentum and color charge, and calculate the current
involving three sources. If we want to retrieve the classical radiation in a two-body system, the
current is then extracted from a generic three-body system by identifying the initial conditions of
the sources. Take YM current as an example,
J µa(2-body) = 1
2!

J µa(3-body)

p3=p1,c3=c1 + J µa(3-body)

p3=p2,c3=c2

(42)
where we set the initial momentum p3 as p1 or p2 and likewise for the charges.
Note the net
momentum l3 emitted by the third source insertion should remain to be independent to l1,2. Since
the three-body current assumes the sources are distinct, there is an overall symmetry factor 2! for
the over-counting of identifying two sources. Similar formulae hold for the trajectory and color
charge at next-to-leading order.
These integrands are analogous to the bare integrand in ﬁeld
theories, including self-energy renormalization to leading order. See Figure 2 for an illustration.
Although this is book-keeping method, it is important for seeing the double-copy structure as we
will discuss in Sec. 5. Unless otherwise noted, from now on we consider a three-body system with
initial conditions p1,2,3, and the (dual) color charges c1,2,3 and ˜c1,2,3 when applicable. This avoids
extra terms in permutation sum in Eq. (32) at next-to-leading order.
6The name is not yet settled in literatures. It is also called fat gravity, extended gravity, or N = 0 supergravity.
7The ﬁnal results are independent of the reference vector.

Bi-adjoint Scalar Theory

for the bi-adjoint current and worldline degrees of freedom, following notations in Eq. (32) and
Eq. (34). The expression for dual color can be found straightforwardly.
Leading Order
Let us ﬁrst summarize the results at leading order from Ref. [31]. To linear order
in coupling (n = 0), the bi-adjoint scalar current emitted by particle 2 with momentum l2 is
J a˜a(0) = ca
2 ˜c˜a

(44)
using the notation in Eq. (43) and the subscript labels the particle. After this radiation is absorbed
by particle 1, its trajectory and color deviation are

2 and similarly the deviation of particle 2. Since there is only one source
inserted at this level, we omit the trivial sum in Eq. (43) as can be done by permutations.
16

To present the leading-order radiation, we introduce the notion of color stripping. To do so, we
ﬁrst reduce the color factors to a minimal basis,
J a˜a(n) =
X
i
Ci J a˜a(n, Ci).
(47)
The function J a˜a(n, Ci) associated with each color factor Ci is the color-stripped object, and likewise
for the emission amplitude and point source.8 At leading order, the independent color factors of
radiation emitted by particle 1, 2 are
C1 = (c1 · c2)ca
1,
C2 = (c1 · c2)ca
2,
C3 = [c1, c2]a

with the momentum of the radiation l12 = l1 + l2. The oﬀ-shell currents serve as inputs for higher
order radiation.
From the above results, we can see two exotic features in classical radiation from ﬁeld-theory
amplitudes. First, there are non-trivial numerators even for bi-adjoint scalar theory. Second, the
color and dual color is no longer diagonal. Both are features absent in ﬁeld-theory amplitude and
clarify the formulation of double copy in classical radiation.
Next-to-leading Order
Using the inputs from leading order and EoM, we ﬁnd the next-to-
leading-order worldline trajectory and (dual) color charge.
The results are summarized in Ap-
pendix B. For the radiation, the full list of numerators are given in Table 1. We can decompose the
current by these color numerators with C21 removed via Jacobi identity. The ﬁrst color-stripped

Note that it does not inherit the antisymmetry of 2 ↔3 in C19, because we have used Jacobi
identity. All other color-stripped amplitudes are related from these by permutation. For exam-
ple, the isometry of color numerators implies ABS(2, C20) = −ABS(2, C19)|1↔2. An ancillary ﬁle
bs_radiation_NLO.m is attached for A2,BS. Unfortunately, the next-to-leading-order radiation is
lengthy even for the simplest bi-adjoint scalar theory. After all, it should be compared with a
seven-point tree amplitude or a ﬁve-point amplitude at one loop. The level of complexity only
keeps growing for YM and gravity.

A non-trivial check for the calculation is the conservation of ∂µT µν(n) = 0 on the support of
the above kinematic constraints, even for oﬀ-shell momentum. For instance, the currents at O(κ)
emitted by a point particle with momentum p are T µν(0) = pµpν and J (0) = p2/(d −2). The
stress-energy is not traceless for massive sources, and therefore dilaton is produced. It is obvious
that ∂µT µν(n) = 0 by the kinematic constraint in Eq. (58). The leading order results can be found
in Ref. [30] which we completely reproduce.
The trajectory deviation at O(κ4) is also available as the function δX µ
1 (2) in the ancillary ﬁle
gr_pos_NLO.m. As we choose the worldline parametrization to be (proportional to) the proper time,
we have gµν(x(τ ′))pµ(τ ′)pν(τ ′) = m2 as a constant at any time τ ′. We have veriﬁed this at next-to-
leading order as a non-trivial check to trajectory deviation δX µ
1 (2). Note that for this equality to
hold, the metric has to be evaluated at the worldline trajectory xµ(τ ′) to necessary order.
For next-to-leading-order radiation, T µν(2) for graviton is provided in gr_radiation_NLO.m
and and the current J (2) for dilaton is given in gr_dilaton_NLO.m. First, we have veriﬁed Ward
identity ∂µT µν(2) = 0 even for oﬀ-shell stress-energy tensor. Also, the graviton emission amplitude
is independent of spacetime dimension, as a feature of dilaton gravity.
9The normalization of graviton and dilaton current are diﬀerent from the bi-adjoint scalar theory and YM.

Color-Kinematics Duality
Now we are ready to discuss the color-kinematics duality in classical radiation. With the previous
calculation, physical emission amplitudes are extracted via Eq. (36). The amplitudes of classical
radiation in worldline formalism are diﬀerent from ﬁeld theory in many places. As we have seen
concretely in Section 3, locality is obscured by the presence of both double and single propagators,
and also the phase perturbation from trajectory deviation. Even for the simple bi-adjoint scalar
theory in Section 3.1, there are kinematic numerators in the emission amplitudes and the two copies
of color factors are not diagonal. We lose the ﬁeld-theory decomposition in Eq. (37). As locality
becomes opaque, it is not obvious how to deﬁne double copy, nor whether a duality-satisfying
representation exist at all. Any proposal as a square to gravity has to be examined explicitly as
there is no rigorous proof. We will also study the BCJ and KLT relations for classical radiation since
these are the direct consequences of color-kinematics duality. Let us restrict to physical emission
amplitudes now and discuss these issues in turn.
4.1
Double Copy in Worldline Formalism
Built on the hints from leading order studies [30–36], we propose a simple resolution: use the
bi-adjoint scalar theory to identify those kinematic terms that are suppose to be propagators.
Concretely, we write the emission amplitude in bi-adjoint scalar theory as
ABS(n) = (−1)n X
i,j
Ci Pij ˜Cj
(61)
where we sum over all the color numerators Ci, ˜Cj and n = 0, 1, 2, · · · corresponds to the order
O(y1+2n). The locality is encoded in Pij, which is not necessary diagonal, and nor only lies in the
denominator. Nevertheless, we use the amplitude in bi-adjoint scalar theory to deﬁne locality, and
span the YM amplitude accordingly
AYM(n) =
X
i,j
Ci Pij Nj
(62)
As in ﬁeld theory, gauge invariance relies on the algebraic color identities in Eq. (1). We would
impose precisely the very same generic algebraic identities on kinematic factors Nj. Once this could
be done, this leads to the proposal
AGR(n) = (−1)n X
i,j
Ni Pij ˜Nj,
(63)
as the amplitude in dilaton gravity at O(κ1+2n). We replace the polarization in one of the copies
as ˜eν such that the polarization has a factorized form eµν = eµ˜eν.
This proposal are motivated by gauge invariance and locality, as in the conventional BCJ double
copy. Despite other diﬀerences, the gauge invariance in YM also relies are the color identities.
21

Therefore we can replace the color factors with kinematic numerators with the same algebraic
properties. This guarantees the gauge invariance in YM. Since the two color copies are on equal
footing in bi-adjoint scalar theory, the amplitude in Eq. (63) has doubly gauge invariance. For
locality, we ﬁnd that the pole structure are still given by the usual propagator of radiation ﬁeld,
and by solving the worldline EoM, e.g., Eq. (25) and (26). So keeping the kinematic kernel Pij in
bi-adjoint scalar for YM and gravity seems reasonable which we shall verify explicitly.
4.2
Duality-Satisfying Representations
To ﬁnd duality-satisfying representations at next-to-leading order, ﬁrst consider the color-stripped
amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory and YM. Then we make an local kinematic ansatz Ni for each
distinct (dual) color numerators Ci in Table 1. Crucially, we demand the ansatze satisfy the same
isometries and Jacobi identity as color numerators. Otherwise gauge invariance is not guaranteed
later on. For example, the ansatz for N1 should be symmetric under exchange of 2 and 3 from the
property of C1; and the ansatz for N4 should be anti-symmetric under 2 ↔3 as in C4. A caveat
here is that we should only focus on the overall algebraic relation than peeping into the detailed
structure. From the leading-order rules in Ref. [30], it is tempting to assume the kinematic ansatz
for C4,5,6 as (p1,2,3 · e) times a universal anti-symmetric function, analogous to f abeca
1cb
2ce
3. However,
this demands too much from color-kinematics duality, since the algebraic relations are all we need
for gauge invariance. Thus, we emphasize that only the algebraic relations in Eq. (1) are imposed.
Matching all color-stripped amplitudes via Eq. (61) and Eq. (62) under
˜Ci, →Ni,
(64)
then yields a solution with 47 free parameters, corresponding to diﬀerent generalized gauge degrees
of freedom. It is not obvious that the solutions exist at all. A particular choice of the duality-
satisfying representations is given in Table 2. It is straightforward to check that the kinematic
counterparts satisfy
N19 + N20 + N21 = 0
as the ﬁrst example of kinematic Jacobi identity beyond ﬁeld-theory amplitudes! Note that it only
holds under the kinematic constraints, li · pi = 0, and the on-shell and transverse conditions.
Using any of the duality-satisfying representations obtained from BS and YM, we are now ready
to test the double-copy construction at the next-to-leading order. On one hand, we ﬁrst take the BS
amplitude and then substitute the color and dual color factors with duality-satisfying numerators
as instructed by Eq. (38).10 The explicit formulae of the BS amplitude is summarized in Eq. (50),
(51), (53) and (54), and the duality-satisfying numerators are given in Table 2. This yields the
amplitude in Eq. (63). On the other hand, we calculate the graviton and dilaton amplitudes using

the standard EoM in dilaton gravity. Decomposing the double-copy amplitude via Eq. (41), we
arrive at the main result of this paper: The amplitudes agree precisely between the YM double
copy and dilaton gravity. It is miraculous that the rather enormous expression in gravity can be
summarized into a few equations.
Let us give a few remarks on the duality-satisfying representations we found here. Goldberger
and Ridgway found amazingly simple rules to match between YM and gravitational radiations [30].
The instruction is to replace color charge with momentum, and the structure constant with three-
gluon vertex in YM with appropriate momentum ﬂow. Not unexpectedly, it gets a bit more compli-
cated at higher orders. First, the solutions are far from unique, because numerators by themselves
are not physical. The same ambiguity occurs to the BCJ numerators in ﬁeld theory. In fact, we will
see that even the leading-order rules are not unique. At next-to-leading order, the leading-order
intuition suggests that C4 in Table 1 should be proportional to (p1 · e) which is in tension with the
full range of solutions we ﬁnd. Also it is unclear how to interpret a structure constant as a YM
three-gluon vertex beyond leading order because the momentum ﬂow is ambiguous. Therefore we
believe the general statement of color-kinematics duality relies on the algebraic relations in Eq. (1),
while the interpretation of color charge as momentum and structure constant as three-gluon vertex
in YM are special rules at leading order.
The formulation in Eq. (42), treating a two-body system as a three-body system, is very impor-
tant for double copy to work. By breaking the degeneracy, we keeps many color factors in YM from
vanishing. For example, the color factor C4 = (c1 · [c2, c3])ca
1, which appears in Figure 3, vanishes
identically once we identify c3 as c1 or c2. While this treatment seems to complicate YM calcula-
tion unnecessarily, this is exactly what we need to make the double copy works, because the very
same diagram is not zero in gravity. Indeed, this is consistent with our rules, where the kinematic
counterpart in Table 2 is not zero. Suppose we consider a two-body system in the beginning, this

tions follow Figure 2 but the wavy lines are gauge ﬁelds in YM, or gravitons in gravity. Particle
1 absorbs the leading-order radiation from 2 and 3 before emitting the ﬁnal radiation. The corre-
sponding color factor is zero by antisymmetry of the structure constant once we identify the color
c3 with c2, following the prescription Eq. (42). The corresponding diagram is non-zero for gravity.
class of color factors will lead to CiPijNj = 0 which map to NiPijNj ̸= 0 under the double copy.
This “zero-to-nonzero” phenomena is not special: there are several examples already in multi-loop
calculations [10]. So our formulation is actually preferred by keeping those color factors around in
the beginning. We expect the same behavior to happen at higher orders.
Although the numerators are not unique, it is possible that there is a general pattern for one
particular good choice of the duality-satisfying representations. Comparing the color and kinematic
numerators in Table 1 and 2, we observe that
ci · cj →pi · pj
(65)
is compatible with color-kinematics duality so far. Such pattern, if continuing to hold at higher
orders, may lead to a kinematic algebra manifesting the color-kinematics duality, and could pinpoint
to the origin of double copy [75–78].
4.3
Amplitude Relations
The color-kinematics duality comes hand-in-hand with two types of relations among physical on-
shell amplitudes. The ﬁrst type is the BCJ amplitude relations among color-stripped amplitudes.
The second type is the KLT relations realizing the double copy directly at amplitude level. Since
the KLT relations are for physical amplitudes, it allows us to obtain gravity amplitudes without
the speciﬁcation of duality-satisfying representations. Let us consider them in turn for classical
radiation.
We begin by reviewing the BCJ amplitude relations. Consider the color-stripped amplitudes in
bi-adjoint scalar theory and YM obtained by projecting the color numerators Ci to a minimal basis.11
11We abuse the notation slight by using the same Ci for color factors in a minimal basis
24

Using the form in Eq. (61) and Eq. (62), we ﬁnd ABS(n, Ci) = Pij ˜Cj and AYM(n, Ci) = PijNj. The
kernel Pij can be view as a matrix with indices run over minimal basis of color factors. If the
kernel is invertible, it would give rise to a unique duality-satisfying representations by matching
color-stripped amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory and YM. However, it is often not the case and
consistent with the fact that duality-satisfying representations are not unique. This immediately
implies that the kernel Pij has null vectors vi such that
X
i
vi ABS,YM(n, Ci) = 0
(66)
as non-trivial relations among color-stripped amplitudes. Note that this relation is universal: it
holds for any theories satisfying color-kinematics duality.
For classical radiation, we ﬁnd one BCJ relation even at leading order
(p1 · l2)A(1, C1) + (p2 · l1)A(1, C2) + 1
2

l2

A(1, C3) = 0.
(67)
which holds for both bi-adjoint scalar theory and YM. A quick way to verify the above relation is
from gauge invariance. Consider Eq. (63) with a longitudinal polarization ˜eµ ∝lµ
12, the left-hand-
side vanishes identically by gauge invariance and Ni reduces to the null vector vi in above equation.
This relation implies that the leading-order rule [30], although being the simplest choice, is not
unique. We can shift the rules with anything proportional to the above relation without changing
the results.
Since double copy relates physical amplitude of various theories, it should be possible to do so
directly at the level of amplitudes at least for tree level. Indeed, such construction is the famous
KLT relations. Again, consider the amplitudes in double copy form in Eq. (62) and Eq. (63). Let
us ignore that Pij is not invertible for a moment. The gravity amplitude is naively given by
AGR(n) = (−1)n X
i,j
Nk Pki P −1
ij Pjl Nl
= (−1)n X
i,j
AYM(n, Ci) Sij AYM(n, Cj),
(68)
as a consequence of double copy form with Sij = P −1
ij . How to reconcile with the fact that Pij,
as doubly-stripped amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory, is not invertible in general? It turns out
the above squaring relation still makes sense by introducing pseudo-inverse [79]. Alternatively, we
can delete the redundant doubly-stripped amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory due to the BCJ
relations. The remaining doubly-stripped amplitudes form a reduced kernel Pij, which is invertible
by construction. The KLT relations can then be derived straightforwardly.
Concretely, return to the classical radiation at leading order. The doubly-stripped amplitude in
Eq. (49) form a 3 × 3 matrix. If we choose to delete the third column and row, as instructed by
Eq. (67), the matrix becomes diagonal and readily invertible. Then the general form in Eq. (68)
25

reduces to
AGR(n) = −
2
X
i,j=1
AYM(n, Ci) Sij AYM(n, Cj)
(69)
with S11 = l2
2(p1 · l2)2/(l2 · l12), S22 = l2
1(p2 · l1)2/(l1 · l12), and zero otherwise. Note that the KLT
kernel Sij is not necessarily a local matrix.
Both types of relations generalize at next-to-leading order. First, we ﬁnd four BCJ relations
0 =(p1 · l123)A(2, C4) + (p2 · l123)A(2, C5 ) + (p3 · l123)A(2, C6 )
+ (l1 · l123)A(2, C19) + (l2 · l123)A(2, C20)
0 =(p1 · l123)A(2, C8) + (p2 · l123)A(2, C10) + (p3 · l123)A(2, C3)
−(l1 · l123)A(2, C18) + (l2 · l123)A(2, C16)
(70)
and also two more relations from the permutations of the second line. This implies there are only
16 independent color-stripped amplitudes at next-to-leading order. By deleting these redundancies,
the kernel Pij is now invertible and yields the KLT relations, which we verify numerically.
By realizing double copy at amplitude level, the KLT relations can be a fast numerical way to
generate gravitational radiation at higher orders. It also enables the construction from generalized
double copy [18, 20, 21]. It would be interesting to connect the BCJ and KLT relations to those in
the S-matrix with fundamental matter [16, 80–85] which we leave for future work.

Discussions and Outlook
In this paper, we calculate the classical radiation in bi-adjoint scalar theory, Yang-Mills theory,
and dilaton gravity to next-to-leading order. This is the ﬁrst gravitational result in the third order
of post-Minkowskian expansion. By comparing BS and YM in the form of Eq. (61) and Eq. (62),
we realize color-kinematics duality in Eq. (2). The resulting double copy amplitude in Eq. (63)
completely agree with explicit calculation in dilaton gravity. We also observe the BCJ and KLT
relations which are also the signatures of color-kinematics duality.
From S-matrix to classical radiation, the seamless transition of double copy hinges on the gauge
invariance and locality—both works surprisingly well in the classical limit. The gauge invariance
in emission amplitudes is based on the on-shell limits of the currents in Eq. (32) and Eq. (58).
Although the currents look like loop integrands in the S-matrix, they are gauge invariant prior to
the integration by our direct calculation. This makes gauge invariance is preserved under double
copy without subtlety. Second, locality also holds well by the very same kernel in Eq. (61) for YM
and dilaton gravity. Further study along the line of Ref. [32] might make the observations here
transparent. We also ﬁnd it important to break the degeneracy in color—by considering a generic
three-body system—to see the double-copy structure.
26

Given the extension to broader theories at leading order [32, 34–36], it would be interesting to
see if the same can be done at next-to-leading order. The case with spinning sources [34, 36] is
particularly interesting. As the calculation becomes more involved, double copy could be even more
valuable than in scalar case here. Second, the anti-symmetric two-form can be appear when spin is
non-zero. Conﬁrming double copy including spin and the two-form would complete the full picture.
More drastically, the S-matrix in seemingly diﬀerent theories, e.g., YM and the non-linear sigma
model, are uniﬁed under the transmutations in Ref. [86]. Given the success of double copy here, it
is possible that the same unifying relations carry through to classical radiation in various theories.
Of course, the most interesting extension would be classical radiation in Einstein gravity. This
has been demonstrated at leading order [32]. In fact, the modiﬁed gauge theory written in Ref. [32]
is rather unique by demanding the coupling between the extra scalar and a massive source propor-
tional to mass. It is possible that the same model also works at higher orders. If it succeeds, the
results would immediately useful as the ﬁrst calculation at third post-Minkowskian order in general
relativity.
The success at next-to-leading order suggests that the future at higher orders is promising.
Crucially, worldline formalism trivializes higher order calculations as tree-level-like processes with
multiple source insertions, along the line of Eq. (42). If we can fully understand such classical
processes as tree-level amplitudes in ﬁeld theory, extending the results in Ref. [32], then the well-
developed techniques in S-matrix will be available. They could teach us how the double copy works
at higher order, for broader type of sources, and possibly lead to an all-order proof.
For future applications to LIGO, it relies on how much the double-copy construction can simplify
binary black holes especially in post-Newtonian regime. We have demonstrated that the classical
limit does not obstruct double copy, at least in the scattering process in post-Minkowskian regime.
However, post-Newtonian regime remains quite distinct in many qualitative features [64]. The time
dependence of orbiting binaries would less straightforward as scattering particles. However, the
recent success at leading order [33] suggests that these complications can be controlled. Alter-
natively, the results in post-Minkowskian scheme can be used as for extracting useful information
about post-Newtonian systems by using subtraction [38, 40–42] or eﬀective one-body formalism [65–
68]. We hope the hidden simplicity found in gravitational S-matrix could eventually shed light on
the spacetime ripples from binary black holes.
