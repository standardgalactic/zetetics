Abstract: Conformal supergravity amplitudes are obtained from the double-copy
construction using gauge-theory amplitudes, and compared to direct calculations
starting from conformal supergravity Lagrangians.
We consider several diﬀerent
theories: minimal N = 4 conformal supergravity, non-minimal N = 4 Berkovits-
Witten conformal supergravity, mass-deformed versions of these theories, as well as
supersymmetry truncations thereof. Coupling the theories to a Yang-Mills sector is
also considered. For all cases we give the gravity Lagrangians that the double copy
implicitly generates. The two main results are: we determine a Lagrangian for the
non-minimal Berkovits-Witten theory, and we uncover the double-copy prescription
for the minimal N = 4 conformal supergravity.
Keywords: Scattering amplitudes, supergravity, gauge symmetry

Introduction
Quantum ﬁeld theories with four-derivative kinetic terms are notorious for their enig-
matic behavior. On the one hand they generically contain ghost-like states associated
to indeﬁnite signs in the propagators, suggesting that they are non-unitary theories
that should be discarded from further study. On the other hand they may have excep-
tionally good behavior in the ultraviolet regime, which over the years has stimulated
attempts to solve ultraviolet problems in the standard framework of two-derivative
theories that currently describe Nature.
Well-known classes of interesting four-derivative models are (super)gravity the-
ories built out of Riemann curvature squared invariants, R2, which are examples of
renormalizable theories of gravity [1]. Conformal (super)gravity [2–6] takes a special
place among these theories, due to its high degree of symmetry which enlarges the
local Poincar´e symmetry of Einstein gravity to local conformal (Weyl) symmetry.
Gravities of R2 type also feature in cosmology, with the Starobinsky model of inﬂa-
tion as the prime example [7]. Other interesting four-derivative models are gauge
theories of Lee-Wick type [8, 9], which are extensions to the Pauli-Villars regulariza-
tion trick and which have been employed in attempts to solve the hierarchy problem
of the Standard Model [10].
In this paper we study tree-level scattering amplitudes of several four-derivative
models, with a focus on conformal (super)gravity and closely-related four-derivative
gauge theories. Previous work [11] has shown that scattering amplitudes in conformal
(super)gravity, of the non-minimal Berkovits-Witten type [12], can be obtained from
the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) double copy of two gauge theories [13, 14]. The
two gauge theories are (super-)Yang-Mills theory and a new gauge theory with a four-
derivative kinetic term of the form (DF)2 [11]. The double-copy construction oﬀers
better means for understanding conformal gravity at both the classical and quantum
level, as it maps a complex gravitational theory to an easier-to-study gauge theory.
The double copy is currently best understood as a consequence of a duality
between color and kinematics [13, 14], which is a property of a large variety of
diﬀerent gauge theories [11, 13–19]. Given that two gauge theories obey the duality,
the color factors in the amplitudes of the ﬁrst theory can be replaced by the kinematic
numerator factors of the second theory [13, 14]. Doing so “doubles up” the spin of the
particles, and promotes the gauge invariance to a diﬀeomorphism invariance [20], thus
giving amplitudes that describe the scattering of spin ≤2 states in a gravitational
theory. By now, vast classes of gravitational theories are understood from the double-
copy perspective [11, 14, 15, 17–34].
The duality provides a rich structure to tree-level amplitudes [20, 24, 35–46], most
notably through the color-ordered n-point gluon amplitudes, which are constrained
by the so-called BCJ relations [13, 47, 48] — these can be used to eliminate all
but (n −3)! independent amplitudes. At the quantum level, the duality interrelates
– 2 –

the kinematic numerators of various loop diagrams, making it possible to obtain
most of them in terms of a small number of master diagrams [14–16, 22, 23, 26,
31, 49–55]. When the double copy is applied to gauge-theory tree amplitudes with
external adjoint particles it becomes equivalent to the well-known Kawai-Lewellen-
Tye (KLT) formula [56–58]. Whereas for non-adjoint and loop-level amplitudes the
double copy provides a more general framework, which has lead to rapid advances in
gravitational loop-level calculations [14, 15, 18, 19, 21–23, 26, 31, 49–55, 59–66] and
related ultraviolet studies [22, 67–73].
Color-kinematics duality and the double copy have found recent applications to
oﬀ-shell structures and quantities, such as form factors [74–77], classical solutions [78–
93], symmetries [20, 27, 94–100] and the kinematic Lie algebra [101–103]. The duality
and double copy also prominently feature in amplitudes of string theory [34, 48,
58, 104–112], the non-linear-sigma model, Born-Infeld, Volkov-Akulov, the special
galileon theory [103, 108, 113–118], and higher-spin theory [119].
In this paper we are ultimately interested in the properties of N = 4 conformal
supergravity, which has been argued to have the maximal degree of supersymmetry
compatible with four-dimensional local conformal symmetry [120]. Witten’s twistor
string theory [121] — which gives tree amplitudes of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory
in its single-trace sector [122] — is well-known to have a multitrace sector that is
“contaminated” by N = 4 conformal supergravity. This non-minimal form of confor-
mal supergravity was ﬁrst studied in isolation by Berkovits and Witten in ref. [12];
however, no complete Lagrangian was given there.
Recently Tseytlin considered
general non-minimal N = 4 conformal supergravities, and concluded that they are
free of conformal anomalies given that four vector multiplets are added to the spec-
trum [123]; thus agreeing with the analysis of the minimal theory [124–126].
A
complete bosonic action for all N = 4 non-minimal conformal supergravity theories
— parametrized by a free function — has been proposed by Butter, Ciceri, de Wit
and Sahoo [127]. We conﬁrm in this work, by direct calculation of amplitudes from
both the double copy and the action, that the Lagrangian of the Berkovits-Witten
theory is given by a simple choice of the free function.
Somewhat surprisingly, the minimal version of N = 4 conformal supergravity
has a trivial tree-level S-matrix when restricted to physical planewave states in four-
dimensional ﬂat space [128–131]. While this is a highly interesting behavior, perhaps
oﬀering some mitigation to the unitarity problem, it is an obstruction if we wish to
better understand the theory by studying its scattering amplitudes. In particular,
to determine whether minimal N = 4 conformal supergravity is constructible from
a double-copy perspective one needs non-trivial amplitudes for comparisons. This
problem can be circumvented by considering loop amplitudes for physical planewave
states, or tree-level amplitudes for non-planewave states.
We consider the latter
case, even if such non-planewave states have been suggested to be problematic due
to their growing behavior at inﬁnity [132]. Inspecting the non-vanishing amplitudes,
– 3 –

we conﬁrm that there exists a double-copy construction for minimal N = 4 conformal
supergravity; it involves a minimal version of the (DF)2 gauge theory where only
the kinetic term is retained.
As expected, the minimal (DF)2 theory also has a trivial tree-level S-matrix for
planewave states [11], which we explain in terms of the classical ﬁeld equations along
the lines of Maldacena’s argument [128]. Inspired by this, we note that “minimal”
four-derivative theories in general can be constructed to have a trivial tree-level S-
matrix for planewave states. We illustrate this property through a four-derivative
scalar toy model. Interestingly, the minimal scalar, gauge and gravity theories all
can be mass deformed by adding two-derivative theories to their Lagrangians, corre-
sponding to φ3, Yang-Mills and Einstein theories, respectively. The four-derivative
tree-level planewave S-matrices then become identiﬁed with the corresponding two-
derivative S-matrices, up to the overall mass scale that parametrizes the deformation.
This is analogous to the mechanism in Anti-de-Sitter space described by Malda-
cena [128].
All results obtained here for the N = 4 conformal supergravity theories also ap-
ply to supersymmetry truncations of these theories. In particular, corresponding
N = 0, 1, 2 conformal (super)gravity theories are known to exist [3, 5, 6, 133, 134],
and we obtain them as double copies by attributing the supersymmetry to the
N = 0, 1, 2 (super-)Yang-Mills side of the double copy. The other side of the double
copy is the bosonic (DF)2 theory [11], which comes in various forms, as summarized
in the following table of double copies considered in this paper:

The mass parameter interpolates between two-derivative and four-derivative theories,
and the inclusion of self-interacting scalars in the bosonic gauge theories translates to
the inclusion of non-abelian Yang-Mills (YM) sectors in the gravity theories [11, 18]
(see also ref. [34] for similar string theory double copies). Weyl-Yang-Mills conformal
supergravities were ﬁrst described in refs. [4, 135, 136].
This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we discuss technical details
of scalar four-derivative theories as a warmup to the more interesting gauge and
gravitational theories. In section 3, we review the conformal-gravity double-copy
construction of ref. [11], and in section 4 we consider details of N = 4 Einstein su-
pergravity that we need for later purposes. The double-copy construction of minimal
conformal supergravity is given in section 5, and in section 6 we compute amplitudes
directly from a non-minimal conformal supergravity Lagrangian and determine the
precise details of the Berkovits-Witten theory.

Warmup: four-derivative scalar theories
We here discuss a four-derivative scalar toy model that illustrates some of the salient
features that we will encounter when dealing with higher-derivative gauge theories
and supergravities. After discussing linearized on-shell solutions, propagators and
formal aspects of scattering in generic four-derivative scalar theories, we specialize
to a speciﬁc toy model that at low energy behaves as φ3 theory, and which is marginal
in D = 6. At high energies, it has a superﬁcial behavior consistent with a theory
marginal in D = 8. This theory is carefully constructed (tuned) so as to make it a
prototype for minimal conformal supergravity coupled to Einstein supergravity.
2.1
On-shell states
Consider a massless scalar ﬁeld with a four-derivative kinetic term L = −1
2φ□2φ+. . ..
The linearized four-derivative equation of motion, □2φ = 0, has two independent
solutions parametrized by an on-shell momentum p2 = 0:
φpw(x) = eip·x ,
φ
pw(x) = i (α · x) eip·x ,
(2.1)
where αµ is a constant vector satisfying α · p ̸= 0.1 The ﬁrst solution, which satisﬁes
□φpw = 0, is the usual planewave mode that is also present in two-derivative scalar
theories. The second, for which □φ
pw ̸= 0, is a non-planewave mode that is speciﬁc to
four-derivative theories.2 As this mode grows linearly in x, it is questionable whether
it can acceptably be taken as an external state of the S-matrix, since asymptotic
states are taken to live at inﬁnity.
Also, the growing behavior of the φ
pw mode
prevents orthogonalization of the two states (2.1). See refs. [132, 137] for recent
work related to non-planewave modes.
Related to the orthogonalization problem, the oﬀ-shell propagator in this theory,
φ
p
φ = −i
p4 ,
(2.2)
consists of only one term, a double pole, that does not obviously distinguish between
the planewave and non-planewave modes. To resolve the double pole, instead con-
sider mass deforming the Lagrangian to L = −1
2φ□(□+m2)φ+. . ., with the eventual
intention of sending the mass parameter m →0. The two solutions to the linearized
equation of motion, □(□+ m2)φ = 0, are a massless and a massive planewave:
φ0(x) = eip·x ,
p2 = 0 ,
φm(x) = eipm·x ,
p2
m = m2 ,
(2.3)
1It may appear that the freedom in αµ corresponds to a larger family of solutions; however,
note that the converse constraint ˜α · p = 0 deﬁnes a (D −1)-dimensional space of vectors ˜αµ
i ,
i = 1, . . . , D −1. Hence α · p ̸= 0 eﬀectively deﬁnes a one-dimensional space orthogonal to ˜αµ
i .
As an alternative perspective, note that φ
pw with a diﬀerent constant vector α′ corresponds to a
superposition of the two solutions in eq. (2.1).
2Note that ϕ ≡□φ
pw is a planewave since □ϕ = 0.

which satisfy □φ0 = 0 and (□+ m2)φm = 0. The mass-deformed propagator is

(2.4)
hence the two poles are well-separated after partial fractioning.
The one-to-one match between states and propagator terms makes it straightfor-
ward to identify the states in scattering amplitudes by examining the types of poles
that appear.
However, the relative sign implies that the massive mode is ghost-
like (assuming that the massless mode is physical). Indeed, as is well known, the
four-derivative kinetic term suggest that we are dealing with a non-unitary theory.
In the strict m →0 limit the two linearized solutions (2.3) become identical,
so one needs to consider subleading terms in the m →0 limit in order to still
have two modes. We expand the massive wavefunction φm around m = 0 using
pµ
m = pµ + m2
2p·qqµ, where pµ and qµ are null vectors independent of m with p · q ̸= 0:
φm(x) = eipm·x = eip·x 
1 + im2
2p · qq · x + O(m4)

.
(2.5)
The non-planewave mode φ
pw emerges in the m →0 limit as the linear combination
φ
pw(x) = φm(x) −φ0(x)
m2

m2→0 = i(α · x)eip·x ,
(2.6)
where we have the identiﬁcation αµ =
qµ
2p·q. From this formula it is also clear that
we can view the non-planewave state as the m2 derivative of the massive planewave
state in the neighborhood of m2 = 0. Alternatively, we can view the non-planewave
state as the momentum derivative of the massless plane wave φ
pw = (α · ∂p)φpw,
which is a more conventional interpretation [12, 130, 137].
2.2
Scattering amplitudes from classical solutions
A well-known aspect of tree-level scattering amplitudes is that they can be read out
from a perturbative solution to the classical equations of motion [102, 138], a proce-
dure which was streamlined in gauge theories by the Berends-Giele recursion [139].
In a two-derivative scalar theory (for example, φ3 theory) the equation of motion is
solved order-by-order in momentum space:
φ(p) =
∞
X
n=0
φ(n)(p) ,
(2.7)
where φ(n)(p) is of nth order in the coupling constant. The zeroth-order solution
φ(0)(p), which solves the free equation of motion □φ(0) = 0, has support only on
p2 = 0 (hence φ(0) is a planewave). Using functional diﬀerentiation of the higher-
order solutions one obtains an oﬀ-shell Berends-Giele current
J(p1, p2, . . . , pn) ≡
δn−1φ(n−2)(−p1)
δφ(0)(p2)δφ(0)(p3) . . . δφ(0)(pn) .
(2.8)
– 6 –

An n-point tree-level amplitude is then obtained using the LSZ prescription by mul-
tiplying with an inverse propagator corresponding to the oﬀ-shell leg 1,
A(2)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = −i lim
p2
1→0 p2
1 J(p1, p2 . . . , pn) ,
(2.9)
where the superscript (2) is used to indicate a two-derivative theory.
In a four-derivative mass-deformed scalar theory the details are mostly the same.
However, with the free equation of motion being □(□+m2)φ(0) = 0, the zeroth-order
solution φ(0) can have support on either p2 = 0 or p2 = m2 for each external leg,
corresponding to either massless or massive planewaves being scattered. As we in the
current work do not seek to scatter more than one ghostlike state we can make the
simplifying assumption that massless planewaves are used as boundary conditions.
For the oﬀ-shell leg 1 there are similarly two choices available,
A(4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = i lim
p2
1→0 p2
1(p2
1 −m2) J(p1, p2, . . . , pn) ,
(2.10a)
A(4)
n (1m, 2, . . . , n) = i lim
p2
1→m2 p2
1(p2
1 −m2) J(p1, p2, . . . , pn) ,
(2.10b)
where the superscript (4) reminds us that we are dealing with a four-derivative theory.
The ﬁrst possibility, which identiﬁes leg p1 as a massless planewave, is easily seen
to be equivalent to a multiplication with the inverse massless propagator −ip2
1m2,
matching the corresponding term in the partial-fractioned propagator (2.4). The
second possibility, which gives a massive planewave, is equivalent to multiplying by
i(p2
1 −m2)m2, which is the inverse massive propagator.
To convert the above amplitudes into one involving a non-planewave mode, one
repeats the limiting procedure given for the linearized states in eq. (2.6), obtaining
A(4)
n (˜1, 2, . . . , n) = lim
m2→0
A(4)
n (1m, 2, . . . , n) −A(4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n)
m2
.
(2.11)
One might be tempted to think of this as an m2 derivative of the massive ampli-
tude; however, this is not the case because the various limits taken in deﬁning the
amplitudes do not commute.
Consider the amputated current bJ(p1, p2, . . . , pn) ≡ip2
1(p2
1−m2) J(p1, p2, . . . , pn),
which schematically has the form
bJ(p1, p2, . . . , pn) = A + B(p2
1 −m2) + Cp2
1 + . . . ,
(2.12)
where the suppressed terms are higher powers of p2
1 and (p2
1 −m2); A, B, C are
functions independent of p2
1 and m2. The massless amplitude is obtained by setting
p2
1 = 0, and the massive one from p2
1 = m2; thus, they have the expansions
A(4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = A −m2B + O(m4) ,
A(4)
n (1m, 2, . . . , n) = A + m2C + O(m4) .
(2.13)
– 7 –

In the m2 →0 limit the term A is the planewave amplitude, and following eq. (2.11)
the sum B + C is the non-planewave amplitude, which is not the m2 derivative of
either amplitude in eq. (2.13). However, from inspecting eq. (2.12), it is clear that
we can obtain B + C from a p2
1 derivative directly on the amputated current:
A(4)
n (˜1, 2, . . . , n) = lim
p2
1→0
∂
∂p2
1
bJ(p1, p2, . . . , pn) = lim
p2
1→0 αµ ∂
∂pµ
1
bJ(p1, p2, . . . , pn) ,
(2.14)
where in the last step we used the chain rule on pµ
1|oﬀ-shell = pµ
1|on-shell + p2
1 αµ to
express the derivative directly in terms of the momentum, which is more convenient
than the squared momentum. Note, however, that we cannot take the limit p2
1 →0
before the derivative since then overall factors of p2
1 are undetectable.
With a few exceptions, in this paper we will be concerned with scattering only
massless, physical external states. The massless planewave modes φ0 do not depend
on m; similarly, it does not matter in which order one takes the m →0 and p2 →0
limits in the LSZ procedure. One may therefore avoid introducing m to the theory
entirely and simply use
A(4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = i lim
p2
1→0 p4
1 J(p1, p2, . . . , pn) .
(2.15)
Namely, one can calculate physical amplitudes involving planewave states using the
usual LSZ procedure by isolating 1/p4 poles on external legs. In conformal super-
gravities the mass deformation breaks dilatation symmetry and the m →0 limit is
potentially problematic. We will return to this point in section 5.2.
2.3
Factorization of four-derivative trees
To better understand the correspondence between states and propagators in generic
four-derivative scalar theories it is helpful to see how their tree amplitudes factorize.
Consider an n-point amplitude of massless planewave states in the mass-deformed
theory, where P = p1 +p2 +· · ·+pk is an internal channel. Using the Feynman rules,
the amplitude factorizes in the P 2 →0 and P 2 →m2 limits as
A(4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = bJ(−P, p1, p2, . . . , pk)
−i
P 2(P 2 −m2)
bJ(P, pk+1, . . . , pn) + ﬁnite ,
(2.16)
where we use amputated currents bJ(P, · · · ) ≡iP 2(P 2 −m2)J(P, · · · ). This decom-
poses into two contributions using partial fractions,
A(4)
n (1, . . . , n) = AL(0)
i
m2P 2AR(0) + AL(m2)
−i
m2(P 2 −m2)AR(m2) + ﬁnite, (2.17)
where we use shorthand notation for the amplitudes AL(P 2) ≡A(4)
n (−P, p1, . . . , pk)
and AR(P 2) ≡A(4)
n (P, pk+1, . . . , pn) when P 2 = 0 or P 2 = m2. That the amputated
– 8 –

currents bJ can be replaced with amplitudes follows from the deﬁnition (2.10) —
expanding each current around P 2 = 0 or P 2 = m2, the leading piece is an amplitude
and subleading pieces contribute only to the ﬁnite terms.
We are prevented from taking m →0 limit by the explicit appearance of m2 in
the denominators. However, it is a simple exercise to show that the expression (2.17)
is precisely equal to
A(4)
n (1, . . . , n) = AL(0)
−i
P 2(P 2 −m2)AR(0) + AL(0)
−i
(P 2 −m2)
AR(m2) −AR(0)
m2
+ AL(m2) −AL(0)

−i
(P 2 −m2)AR(0)
(2.18)
+ AL(m2) −AL(0)
m2
−im2
(P 2 −m2)
AR(m2) −AR(0)
m2
+ ﬁnite .
The m2 factors in the denominators are now matched with corresponding vanishing
expressions in the numerators, so there are no longer any singularities as m →0.
Only the ﬁrst three terms survive in this limit, and using the deﬁnition of amplitudes
with a single non-planewave state given in eq. (2.11) we ﬁnd that
A(4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = AL(0)−i
P 4AR(0) + AL(0)−i
P 2 ˜
AR(0) + ˜
AL(0)−i
P 2AR(0) + ﬁnite ,
(2.19)
where the amplitudes carrying tildes are those with non-planewave states in the
ﬁrst slot. Given that the above factorization is also implied by simple dimensional
analysis, we expect it also to hold for more general external non-planewave states.
From this exercise we learn a number of important lessons about amplitudes in
four-derivative massless scalar theories:
1. Leading factorization poles 1/P 4 always imply an exchange of planewave states.
2. Planewave and non-planewave states are mixed together in the subleading fac-
torization poles 1/P 2, which agrees with our earlier observation that the states
cannot be orthogonalized.
3. Subleading poles 1/P 2 generally have non-unique residues. This is because the
non-planewave amplitudes depend on αµ through the parametrization of the
momenta in the neighborhood of the pole, P µ|oﬀ-shell = P µ|on-shell+P 2αµ, which
is inherent in the deﬁnition of non-planewave states (2.6).
4. If a leading factorization pole 1/P 4 is absent from an amplitude, the interpre-
tation of states and poles 1/P 2 in this channel should become the usual one
for two-derivative theories.
This last point requires further explanation.
In the factorization (2.19) if either
AL(0) or AR(0) vanishes as m →0 then the 1/P 4 pole is of course absent; however,
– 9 –

subleading 1/P 2 poles might still be present. For example, if one of the amplitudes
is proportional to m2 (and therefore vanishes as m →0) then the non-planewave
state typically gives a non-vanishing 1/P 2 pole. This phenomenon occurs in minimal
conformal supergravities, and we will now elaborate on it using an explicit toy model.
2.4
A four-derivative toy model
To illustrate some of the features discussed, we now consider a speciﬁc four-derivative
toy model with Lagrangian

The resulting equation of motion,

(2.21)
takes the interesting form of an operator (□+ m2 −gφ) acting on the usual two-
derivative equation of motion for massless φ3 theory. As we have seen before, the
free equation of motion is □(□+ m2)φ(0) = 0.
First we consider amplitudes involving only massless planewaves. Any pertur-
bative solution to the equation of motion of the φ3 theory, □φ = g
2φ2, is clearly also
a solution to the four-derivative equation of motion (2.21). Therefore, provided that
the external-state boundary conditions φ(0) are identiﬁed with planewaves, it must
follow that the tree amplitudes in the four-derivative and two-derivative theories are
trivially related,
A(4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = m2A(2)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) .
(2.22)
The overall m2 factor can be deduced from the m →∞limit, where the four-
derivative equation of motion simpliﬁes to m2(□φ −g
2φ2) = 0. For instance, at four
points the planewave amplitude in the four-derivative theory is3

(2.23)
where s = (p1+p2)2, t = (p2+p3)2 and u = (p1+p3)2 — this is indeed proportional
to the usual φ3 amplitude.
In the m →0 limit this amplitude vanishes, as do
all planewave tree-level amplitudes of this (ﬁnely tuned) four-derivative theory. In
the forthcoming sections we will see examples of gauge and gravity four-derivative
theories that have exactly the same peculiar behavior.
3We are omitting the overall momentum-conserving factor (2π)4δ(4) (P
i pi), as we will do for
all amplitudes in the remaining part of this paper.
– 10 –

To obtain non-vanishing amplitudes in the massless limit we need to scatter one
or more non-planewave states. Let us focus on a single non-planewave state, and
obtain the amplitude starting from the mass-deformed theory. It turns out that in
the mass-deformed theory all amplitudes involving a single massive planewave vanish:
A(4)
n (1m, 2, . . . , n) = 0 ,
(2.24)
where 1m indicates that particle 1 is massive. One can see this by considering the
factorization channels of the tree amplitudes with only massless planewaves: as we
have already discussed, these are proportional to those of the two-derivative φ3 the-
ory. Hence there are no massive poles and therefore no residues corresponding to
amplitudes with one massive external state.
Next, using the deﬁnition of non-planewave amplitudes (2.11), the above col-
lapses to the following simple relation between four- and two-derivative amplitudes
(particle 1, the non-planewave mode, is denoted as ˜1):
A(4)
n (˜1, 2, . . . , n) = −A(2)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) .
(2.25)
Note that both sides of this relation are supported on the usual momentum-conserving
delta function (i.e. not a derivative of the delta function). Since this relation has no
overall factor of m2 it implies that in the m →∞limit the non-planewave amplitudes
remain non-zero, and thus we have arrived at non-vanishing tree amplitudes in the
massless four-derivative theory.
We will not dwell further on amplitudes in the scalar model, as in this paper
the focus is on gauge and gravity theories. However, we should emphasize that the
relationships (2.22) and (2.25) between two- and four-derivative amplitudes apply
more generally to other theories — one simply requires that the equations of motion
in a four-derivative theory be implied by those of a two-derivative theory. Confor-
mal supergravity amplitudes with this behavior, at three points, have already been
presented in refs. [132, 140].
Although this four-derivative toy model may seem rather contrived, all of the
special features demonstrated here apply also to minimal conformal supergravity —
to be discussed in section 5. Of course, one can also add more interactions to the
toy Lagrangian (2.20) and obtain amplitudes unrelated to those of φ3 theory. As we
shall see in section 6, gravitational analogies to such deformations of the interactions
correspond to non-minimal versions of conformal supergravities. Before we get to
conformal gravity, we will review a four-derivative gauge theory that features in the
double copy of certain non-minimal conformal gravities.

Review of conformal gravity double copy
Scattering amplitudes in non-minimal N = 4 Berkovits-Witten (BW) conformal
supergravity (CSG) can be obtained from the following double copy [11]:
(N = 4 BW CSG) = (DF)2 ⊗(N = 4 SYM) ,
(3.1)
where (DF)2 theory is shorthand for a certain four-derivative gauge theory built
out of dimension-six operators, and the second gauge theory is N = 4 super Yang-
Mills (SYM). In this section we review the construction starting with the (DF)2
Lagrangian, then give details of the double copy and ﬁnally consider natural defor-
mations and extensions.
3.1
The (DF)2 theory
The (DF)2 theory is a bosonic D-dimensional gauge theory that is built entirely out
of dimension-six operators (in D = 6 counting); its Lagrangian is [11]
L(DF)2 = 1
2 (DµF µν,a)2−g
3F 3+1
2 (Dµϕα)2+g
2CαabϕαF a

where the ﬁeld strength and covariant derivatives are deﬁned as4

(3.3)
The ﬁeld content comprises a gauge ﬁeld Aa
µ transforming in the adjoint representa-
tion of a gauge group G, and a scalar ﬁeld ϕα transforming in a real representation R,
with symmetric generators (T a
R)αβ. It is assumed that the representation R appears
in the tensor product of two adjoint representations, which deﬁnes the symmetric
Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients Cαab = Cαba. In addition, the tensor product R × R
contains R and this deﬁnes the totally symmetric dαβγ tensor. The details of the
representation are unimportant for calculating tree-level amplitudes; however, to en-
sure gauge invariance the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients need to transform as covariant
tensors of a Lie algebra, which enforces the relations
if abc(T c
R)αβ = (T a
R)αγ(T b

(3.4)
4Our Lie algebra generators and structure constants are deﬁned such that [T a, T b] = if abcT c
and Tr(T aT b) = (1/2)δab for fundamental-representation generators.
– 12 –

The kinetic term (DµF µν,a)2 has four derivatives, which implies that on the
support of Lorenz gauge ∂µAa
µ = 0 the linearized equation of motion for the gauge
ﬁeld becomes □2Aa
µ = 0. This implies the existence of four independent spin-1 modes:
two physical planewave gluons A±
µ (p) = ϵ±
µ (p)eip·x, and two ghost-like non-planewave
gluons ˜A±
µ (p) = ϵ±
µ (p)aνxνeip·x. Additionally, the ﬁeld equation permits a ghost-like
scalar excitation A0
µ(p) = ϵ0
µ(p)eip·x, which can be obtained as a longitudinal mode of
a massive gluon after deforming the theory with a mass term (as done in section 3.3).
As explained for the toy model in section 2.1, one may calculate amplitudes involving
physical gluons by isolating 1/p4 poles on external legs. We will in this section only
consider physical gluons (see section 5.1 for non-planewave gluons).
Gluon tree amplitudes are easier to work with if we consider a color decomposi-
tion into color-ordered amplitudes for the gauge group G = SU(Nc),
A(DF)2
n
= gn−2
X
σ∈Sn/Zn
Tr(T aσ1T aσ2 · · · T aσn)A(DF)2
n
(σ1, σ2, · · · , σn).
(3.5)
To obtain such a decomposition the color tensors Cαab and dαβγ can be massaged via
CαabCαcd = f acef edb + f adef ecb ,
Cαabdαβγ = (iT a
R)βα(iT b
R)αγ + (iT b
R)βα(iT a
R)αγ + CβacCγcb + CβbcCγca ,
(3.6)
until every color factor in the tree amplitude can be expressed in terms of only
f abc structure constants, at which point they can be converted to the trace basis
through standard SU(Nc) identities. The two relations (3.6) are also necessary [11]
for the color-ordered amplitudes with physical gluons to satisfy BCJ tree-amplitude
relations [13].
Since the (DF)2 theory satisﬁes color-kinematics duality, at least
through eight points [11], we may employ it to construct gravitational amplitudes
via the double copy.
3.2
Double copy with N = 4 SYM
First we discuss the double copy at the level of the physical on-shell states that we
are interested in scattering. The complete N = 4 SYM on-shell supermultiplet is
V = A+ + ηIλ+
I + 1
2ηIηJSIJ + 1
3!ϵIJKLηIηJηKλL
−+ η1η2η3η4A−.
(3.7)
where I, J, . . . are SU(4) R-symmetry indices and ηI are Grassmann-odd auxiliary
parameters used in the on-shell superspace formalism (see e.g. [141]). The on-shell
particle content resulting from a double copy of physical (DF)2 gluon states, A+ and
A−, with those of N = 4 SYM coincides with that of chiral and anti-chiral graviton
supermultiplets in N = 4 conformal supergravity:
H+ ≡A+ ⊗V = h++ + ηIψ+
I + 1

IJ + 1

IJ + 1
3!ϵIJKLηIηJηKψL
−+ η1η2η3η4 h−−.
(3.8)
– 13 –

These are the same on-shell graviton supermultiplets as are relevant for N = 4
Einstein supergravity. The additional ghost-like states that are proliﬁc in N = 4
conformal supergravity can in principle be considered (since they appear in factor-
ization channels of the tree-level amplitudes); however, we will not do so here.
For tree-level amplitudes involving only external graviton multiplets, it is con-
venient to phrase the BCJ double copy [13, 14] in terms of the KLT formula [56].
Doing this for the graviton multiplets in eq. (3.8) gives the following formula for
Berkovits-Witten conformal supergravity tree amplitudes:
M BW CSG
n

σ,ρ∈Sn−3
A(DF)2
n
(1, σ, n, n −1)S[σ|ρ]ASYM
n
(1, ρ, n −1, n) ,
(3.9)
where we have suppressed the gravitational coupling constant. The KLT kernel S[σ|ρ]
is an (n−3)!×(n−3)! matrix of kinematic polynomials that acts on the color-ordered
amplitudes for (n −3)! permutations of the external legs [57, 58, 142–144]:
S[σ|ρ] =
n−2

i=2
"
2p1 · pσi +
i
X
j=2
2pσi · pσjθ(σj, σi)ρ
#
,
(3.10)
where θ(σj, σi)ρ = 1 if σj is before σi in the permutation ρ, and zero otherwise.
As is manifest in the double copy, the four-dimensional conformal supergravity
amplitudes are classiﬁed according to (i) how many external states belong to the
H+ or H−multiplets (inherited from the helicity of the (DF)2 side), and (ii) their
maximally-helicity-violating (NkMHV) degree (inherited from the N = 4 SYM side).
The MHV-sector amplitudes were ﬁrst computed by Berkovits and Witten in ref. [12],
and have since been conﬁrmed up to eight points using the above double copy [11].
They are all given by the compact formula

i λα
i ηI
i ) is the usual supermomentum-
conserving delta function given in terms of on-shell spinors λα
i and the Grassmann-
odd numbers [145]. Historically, these amplitudes arose from the N = 4 twistor
string theory as a conformal gravity “contamination” of N = 4 SYM in the multi-
trace sector [12] (see also refs. [129, 137, 146]). Although some hints were provided
in Berkovits and Witten’s original work, a Lagrangian formulation of the ﬁeld theory
from which these amplitudes originate has until now been lacking.
This will be
discussed in section 6, where a Lagrangian is presented.
3.3
Deformations and extensions
Several extensions to the (DF)2 theory were considered in ref. [11].
Firstly, the
theory was mass deformed by adding a Yang-Mills term to the Lagrangian (3.2),
– 14 –

thus resolving the states coming from Aa
µ into massless and massive gluon states
(ﬁve states in total). For the resulting theory to still obey color-kinematics duality,
the scalar ϕα should also acquire the same mass. The mass-deformed Lagrangian
is [11]
L(DF)2+YM = L(DF)2 −m2
4 (F a
µν)2 −m2
2 ϕαϕα,
(3.12)
and m eﬀectively interpolates between the (DF)2 and YM theories in the m →
0 and m →∞limits respectively.
Upon taking the double copy (3.9) between
(DF)2 + YM and SYM, the resulting gravitational amplitudes interpolate between
Berkovits-Witten amplitudes and those of Einstein supergravity.
Another deformation considered in ref. [11] was the inclusion of a bi-adjoint
scalar φaA with cubic self interactions. This scalar transforms in the adjoint of the
gauge group G, and also in the adjoint of a global group ˜G. The complete Lagrangian
in this case is
L(DF)2+YM+φ3 = L(DF)2 −m2
4 (F a
µν)2 −m2
2 ϕαϕα + 1
2
 DµφaA2
+ g
2CαabϕαφaAφbA + gλ
3! f abc ˆf ABCφaAφbBφcC ,
(3.13)
where ˆf ABC are the structure constants of ˜G and the coupling λ is a free parameter.
The coupling to ϕα through Cαab is necessary to ensure valid BCJ amplitude relations
when the bi-adjoint scalars φaA are scattered. This theory plays a crucial role in the
novel double-copy constructions of heterotic and bosonic string amplitudes [34]. In
the m →0 limit, one obtains a (DF)2 + φ3 theory, and the resulting amplitudes
from the double copy with N = 4 SYM give rise to additional vector multiplets in
conformal gravity.
Finally, in the m →∞limit of this deformation the kinetic term of ϕα drops out.
This scalar may therefore be integrated out, giving rise to a φ4 interaction. Keeping
only terms proportional to m2, the resulting Lagrangian becomes [18]
LYM+φ3 = −1
4(F a

 DµφaA2

3! f abc ˆf ABCφaAφbBφcC −g2
4 f acef ebdφaAφbAφcBφdB,
(3.14)
where the overall m2 has been removed by rescaling, and λ′ = mλ is kept ﬁnite in
the limit. To realize this explicitly, one should make the ﬁeld φaA dimension-one by
rescaling φaA →mφaA. Taking the double copy with N = 4 SYM amplitudes now
gives N = 4 Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) supergravity amplitudes. More generally,
by varying the degree of supersymmetry one obtains [18]
(N = 0, 1, 2, 4 EYM SG) = (YM + φ3) ⊗(N = 0, 1, 2, 4 SYM) .
(3.15)
Both Einstein and EYM supergravity theories are discussed in the next section.

Einstein supergravity
To build familiarity with the formalism used to describe gravitational theories in this
paper we ﬁrst discuss some details of four-dimensional N = 4 Einstein supergravity.
For simplicity of presentation, we will focus on the ﬁelds that are singlets under the
SU(4) R-symmetry of the theory, as this is often suﬃcient to reconstruct the tree
amplitudes for all other ﬁelds (e.g. through supersymmetric Ward identities [147]).
The SU(4)-singlet sector of the pure N = 4 theory — which is sometimes play-
fully referred to as N = 0 supergravity — consists of ordinary Einstein gravity
coupled to a scalar dilaton ϕ and a pseudoscalar axion χ.5 Its Lagrangian is
e−1L = −2
κ2R + 1
κ2
 ∂µϕ∂µϕ + e2ϕ∂µχ∂µχ

,
(4.1)
where e = √−g, and g is the determinant of the metric (not to be confused with the
gauge coupling constant). The gravitational coupling κ is made explicit here, but in
the remaining part of this section we set κ = 2.6
The SU(4)-singlet part of the N = 4 Lagrangian may be more compactly ex-
pressed using the complex scalar ﬁeld τ,
τ = χ + ie−ϕ,
(4.2)
giving
e−1L = −R
2 + ∂µ¯τ∂µτ
4(Im τ)2.
(4.3)
Although the origin of this four-dimensional ﬁeld is diﬀerent, the way τ appears in
the Lagrangian should be familiar from the ten-dimensional eﬀective actions of string
theory [150].
4.1
Covariant SU(1,1)/U(1) formulation
It is well-known that the scalar sector of N = 4 supergravity (4.3) realizes a global
nonlinear SL(2,R)∼=SU(1,1) symmetry:
τ →aτ + b
cτ + d,
det
a b
c d

= 1,
a, b, c, d ∈R.
(4.4)
Any value of τ is also invariant under a U(1) stabilizer subgroup (which also acts on
the additional matter content in the theory), so one typically regards τ as living in
an SU(1,1)/U(1) coset space.
5The four-dimensional axion χ emerges from the D-dimensional antisymmetric Bµν tensor as
Hµνρ = i
2eκϕeϵµνρσ∂σχ, where Hµνρ = ∇µBνρ + cyclic is the curvature of Bµν (see e.g. ref. [148]).
6With respect to the complete N = 4 Lagrangian given in ref. [149] we set K = 1
2.
– 16 –

As the SU(1,1) symmetry is an important feature of the theories considered in
this paper, it would be advantageous to make it act linearly on the ﬁelds. Such a
linear realization is achieved by moving to the covariant formulation. We introduce
a doublet of complex scalars φα (α = 1, 2), subject to constraints
φαφα = 1,
φ1 = ¯φ1,
φ2 = −¯φ2.
(4.5)
The linear action of U ∈SU(1,1) on these scalars is simply φ′α = U αβφβ. Meanwhile,
the U(1) stabilizer is promoted to a local symmetry, acting on the scalars with
weight 1, i.e. φα →eiλA(x)φα. To write down U(1)-covariant derivatives ˜∇µ we use
a composite gauge ﬁeld aµ = iφα∂µφα — so, for instance, ˜∇µφα = (∂µ −iaµ)φα also
transforms with weight 1. Finally, we deﬁne the SU(1,1)/U(1) coset ﬁelds
Pµ = φαϵαβ ˜∇µφβ,
¯Pµ = −φαϵαβ ˜∇µφβ,
(4.6)
with ϵ12 = ϵ12 = 1. These are invariant under SU(1,1) and carry U(1) weights +2
and −2 respectively. In terms of them, the SU(4)-singlet part of N = 4 Einstein
supergravity Lagrangian is simply
e−1L = −R
2 + P · ¯P.
(4.7)
Of course, these constrained scalars are unsuitable for scattering. So we parametrize
them in terms of unconstrained scalars, and the covariant formulation gives us ﬂex-
ibility in how we do this. For instance, the U(1) gauge choice Im(φ1 + φ2) = 0 can
be parametrized as [151]
φ1 =
1
2
√
Im τ
(1 −iτ),
φ2 =
1
2
√
Im τ
(1 + iτ),
τ = iφ1 −φ2
φ1 + φ2,
(4.8)
which solves φαφα = 1. Via the deﬁnitions of Pµ and aµ given above this implies
Pµ = i∂µτ
2Im τ = 1
2(∂µϕ + ieϕ∂µχ),
aµ = −∂µ(τ + ¯τ)
4Im τ
= −1
2eϕ∂µχ,
(4.9)
thereby conﬁrming that the two versions of the N = 4 supergravity Lagrangian (4.3)
and (4.7) are equivalent.
Since τ should be perturbatively expanded around the point ⟨τ⟩= i, it is some-
what inconvenient to consider amplitudes in terms of this ﬁeld. Following ref. [6], an
alternative useful gauge ﬁxing is the reality condition φ1 = φ1, parametrized as
φ1 =
1
p
1 −|C|2,
φ2 = −
C
p
1 −|C|2,
C = −φ2
φ1.
(4.10)
In this case, one can easily show that
Pµ = −
∂µC
1 −|C|2,
aµ = Im(C∂µ ¯C)
1 −|C|2 .
(4.11)
– 17 –

Notice that these expressions for Pµ and aµ do not equal the ones given above in terms
of τ (4.9); the former are obtained from the latter via the U(1) transformation [152]
Pµ →e2iθPµ,
aµ →aµ + ∂µθ,
θ = 1
2ilog
1 −iτ
1 + i¯τ

.
(4.12)
C transforms non-linearly under SU(1,1), and the local U(1) symmetry is broken to
a global, chiral U(1) under which C has a charge of 2.
4.2
Double copy structure
With the parametrization choice (4.11), the SU(4)-singlet part of the N = 4 super-
gravity Lagrangian (4.7) becomes
e−1L = −R
2 +
∂µ ¯C∂µC
(1 −|C|2)2.
(4.13)
Using this Lagrangian as a starting point, amplitude calculations involving gravitons
and scalars are, in principle, straightforward. One simply expands gµν = ηµν + κhµν
and reads oﬀinteraction vertices and propagators in the usual way (see e.g. ref. [153]).
The denominator involving C expands to give an inﬁnite tower of interactions with
itself, its conjugate ¯C, and the graviton hµν ﬁeld.
As is well known, and as we have conﬁrmed by direct calculations, the result-
ing graviton-scalar tree amplitudes coincide with those computed from the double
copy [21, 154]:
(N = 0, 1, 2, 4 Einstein SG) = YM ⊗(N = 0, 1, 2, 4 SYM) .
(4.14)
Here the N < 4 supergravity theories are non-pure, in the sense that they have
additional complex matter multiplets where the scalars C, ¯C are the top and bottom
components, respectively. As should be familiar from the N = 0 case of the dou-
ble copy, we can identify the linearized on-shell dilaton ϕ and axion χ states with
symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of on-shell gluon states, respectively,
ϕ = −A+ ⊗A−−A−⊗A+,
iχ = A+ ⊗A−−A−⊗A+.
(4.15)
Using the non-linear expressions for τ and C in terms of φα (eqs. (4.8) and (4.10)
respectively), one can express C in terms of ϕ and χ:
C = −1 + iτ
1 −iτ = −1 −e−ϕ + iχ
1 + e−ϕ −iχ = −1
2(ϕ + iχ) + · · · .
(4.16)
Therefore, at the linearized on-shell level one can also identify
C = A−⊗A+,
¯C = A+ ⊗A−,
(4.17)
– 18 –

which justiﬁes our use of the C and ¯C states in the H−and H+ multiplets (3.8)
respectively.
We mentioned earlier that C has a U(1) charge of 2. The U(1) charges of other
states in the H+ and H−multiplets are given by the diﬀerence of their helicities on
the two sides of the double copy: qU(1) = h(SYM) −h(YM). When computing tree-
level amplitudes this symmetry is useful — for instance, it explains the decoupling
of the scalars in pure-graviton tree amplitudes.
Since the work of Marcus [155],
it is known that the U(1) symmetry of N = 4 Einstein supergravity is anomalous
at the quantum level (see refs. [154, 156, 157] for studies of the anomaly from the
double-copy perspective). U(1) symmetry breaking is also an important feature of
non-minimal conformal supergravities, where it happens already at tree level [125].
4.3
Coupling to vector multiplets
Before proceeding to conformal gravity we review the coupling of additional N = 4
vector multiplets to Einstein supergravity. With a vector multiplet that transforms
in the adjoint of a gauge group ˜G, the Lagrangian (4.7) generalizes to that of N = 4
Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) supergravity. The SU(4)-singlet part is

By taking only the diagonal elements of Hodges’ matrix and setting q = x = y

As mentioned in section 3.3, these amplitudes admit a double copy construc-
tion from the YM + φ3 theory deﬁned by the Lagrangian (3.14). We have checked
the MHV-sector single-trace (4.21) and double-trace (4.23) amplitudes by explicit
calculation from the EYM Lagrangian (4.18) for a variety of external states includ-
ing scalars, gravitons and gluons. We have also checked the single-, double-, and
triple-trace sectors of the six-point NMHV amplitude M6(A+, A+, A+, A−, A−, A−)
by comparison with the double copy.

Minimal conformal supergravity
In this section we explore scattering amplitudes in minimal conformal supergravity.
We show that the amplitudes admit a double-copy construction from a truncation
of the (DF)2 theory reviewed in section 3.1, which we therefore refer to as minimal
(DF)2 theory. In general, we will consider mass-deformed versions of these theories,
and thus the proper theories are obtained in the m →0 limit. By analogy to the
four-derivative toy model discussed in section 2.4, the four-derivative equations of
motion in these theories are automatically solved by classical solutions to Yang-Mills
and Einstein supergravity, respectively. Hence their tree amplitudes for planewave
states vanish for m = 0, and are equal (up to a factor of m2) to their two-derivative
counterparts for ﬁnite m. The vanishing of planewave amplitudes in minimal con-
formal supergravity follows from an argument by Maldacena [128], which was later
elaborated on in refs. [129–131].
5.1
Minimal (DF)2 theory
We deﬁne the minimal (DF)2 theory to consist solely of the kinetic term (DµF µν,a)2
from the Lagrangian (3.2). However, it is convenient to introduce the Yang-Mills term
from the very beginning, thus the mass-deformed minimal theory has the Lagrangian8
L = 1
2 (DµF µν,a)2 −m2
4 (F a
µν)2 .
(5.1)
We note that the classical equations of motion,
DλDλDρF ρµ,a −DλDµDρF ρλ,a + [Dµ, Dλ]DρF a
ρλ + m2DρF ρµ,a = 0 ,

8Up to an overall m2 factor, this is the Lee-Wick theory [8, 9] considered in ref. [10].
– 20 –

are solved by the Yang-Mills equations DµF µν,a = 0. The situation is therefore com-
pletely analogous to the scalar toy model in section 2.4. Tree amplitudes involving
physical gluons A+ and A−in the mass-deformed theory are proportional to those
of ordinary Yang-Mills theory,
A(4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = m2A(2)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) ,
(5.3)
implying that they vanish identically in the minimal (DF)2 theory (m →0). We
remind the reader that the superscripts are used to distinguish the four- and two-
derivative theories. Also, tree amplitudes involving a single non-planewave state are
given by
A(4)
n (˜1, 2, . . . , n) = −A(2)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) ,
(5.4)
and thus there exist non-vanishing amplitudes in the m →0 limit.
A minor diﬀerence compared to the scalar toy model is gauge ﬁxing. It is conve-
nient to use Lorenz gauge ∂µAa
µ = 0 in both the two- and four-derivative theories. In
the latter case, the gauge-ﬁxing term is LGF = −1
2(∂µAµ,a)(□+ m2)(∂νAν,a), which
gives a simple propagator,
Aµ,a
p
Aν,b =
i ηµνδab
p2(p2 −m2) .
(5.5)
This works equally well when m = 0, in which case the propagator is iηµνδab/p4.
5.2
Weyl gravity
The simplest four-dimensional conformal gravity is the pure Weyl theory. Including
an Einstein-Hilbert term from the start gives the mass-deformed Weyl theory,
e−1L = −1
κ2(Wµνρσ)2 −2
κ2m2R,
(5.6)
where κ is a dimensionless coupling.9 For simplicity, from now on we set κ = 2. The
four-dimensional Weyl tensor, and its square, are expressed as
Wµνρσ = Rµνρσ + gν[ρRσ]µ −gµ[ρRσ]ν + 1
3gµ[ρgσ]νR,
(Wµνρσ)2 = (Rµνρσ)2 −2(Rµν)2 + 1
3R2 = 2(Rµν)2 −2
3R2 + GB,
(5.7)
where GB is the topological Gauss-Bonnet term. Using that the Weyl tensor with
one raised index W µνρσ is invariant under dilatations gµν →e−2λD(x)gµν, it follows
that the massless theory has local scale symmetry.
9Note that the ordinary gravitational coupling is given by κ = κ/m, and for κ = O(1) the
Planck mass can be identiﬁed with m.

A graviton ﬁeld is obtained by considering the metric perturbation gµν = ηµν +
κhµν (instead of κ as we used earlier). The equations of motion are Bµν +m2Rµν = 0,
where the Bach tensor Bµν is

(5.8)
Any solution to the vacuum Einstein equations Rµν = 0 is also a solution to these
equations of motion. Therefore, as before, the following tree amplitudes of the four-
derivative mass-deformed Weyl theory are related to those of Einstein gravity:
M (4)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) = m2M (2)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) ,
M (4)
n (˜1, 2, . . . , n) = −M (2)
n (1, 2, . . . , n) .
(5.9)
This is strikingly analogous to Maldacena’s argument on the relation between con-
formal gravity and Einstein gravity amplitudes [128]; however, he considered curved
AdS space where the scale was provided by ΛAdS instead of m2. The vanishing of
planewave amplitudes in ﬂat-space conformal gravity follows either way in the limits
ΛAdS, m2 →0 [129–131].10
A ﬁnal remark regarding the m2 →0 limit: While one counts 2 + 5 = 7 on-
shell states in the massive theory (massless + massive gravitons), the massless Weyl
theory has 6 = 2 + 2 + 2 states (planewave + non-planewave gravitons + photons)
since a scalar should decouple due to the enhanced local scale symmetry [1]. One
might question the smoothness of the m →0 limit since the propagator typically has
1/m2 poles; however, we have conﬁrmed by explicit calculation that the amplitudes
obtained using either the m = 0 or m →0 prescriptions are identical. This point is
further discussed in appendix A.
5.3
Minimal conformal supergravity
In extending the discussion to conformal supergravity amplitudes, we seek a bosonic
extension to the Weyl Lagrangian (5.6) which originates from the SU(4)-singlet part
of minimal N = 4 conformal supergravity. Following Fradkin and Tseytlin’s classiﬁ-
cation [125], minimal conformal supergravity is deﬁned as possessing both the global
SU(1,1) symmetry acting on the scalars φα and the local U(1) symmetry acting also
on other ﬁelds.
Non-minimal theories, which we will discuss in section 6, break
both symmetries. All dependence on φα in the minimal theory should therefore be
10An alternative argument, following ’t Hooft and Veltman’s classic work [163] (see also [164]),
is that (Rµν)2 and R2 terms can be removed by a ﬁeld redeﬁnition gµν →gµν + aRµν + bgµνR,
thus (Wµνρσ)2 ∼GB vanishes in four dimensions. Note, however, this argument assumes that the
Einstein-Hilbert term m2R is nonzero which makes it somewhat suspicious in the m2 →0 limit.

through the coset ﬁeld P µ and the U(1)-covariant derivative ˜∇µ. Given also that the
Lagrangian should be of the four-derivative type and have local scale invariance, the
only allowed SU(4)-singlet combinations are
(Wµνρσ)2,
¯P µ ˜∇µ ˜∇νP ν + 2(Rµν−1
3gµνR) ¯P µP ν,
P 2 ¯P 2,
(P · ¯P)2,
(5.10)
where total derivatives and the Gauss-Bonnet term are excluded.
As the U(1) symmetry decouples the scalars from tree-level graviton amplitudes,
our discussion of the Weyl theory tells us that the pure-graviton superconformal am-
plitudes are given by m2 times their Einstein supergravity counterparts. For this to
generalize to the full physical planewave spectrum of N = 4 conformal supergravity
— the same H± multiplets as appeared in N = 4 Einstein supergravity (3.8) —
we require the equations of motion for Einstein supergravity to imply those of the
conformal theory. In the SU(4)-singlet sector, the former are
Rµν −1
2gµνR = T (2)
µν ,
˜∇µP µ = 0 ,
(5.11)
and the stress-energy tensor is
T (2)
µν = 2

(5.12)
This allows us to make an ansatz for the superconformal Lagrangian using the terms
in (5.10), and ﬁx coeﬃcients by examining the resulting equations of motion.
Doing so, we ﬁnd that the N = 4 minimal conformal supergravity theory has
the following SU(4)-singlet sector Lagrangian:
e−1L = −1

A helpful ﬁrst step is to re-express the gravitational equation given in eq. (5.11) as
Rµν = 2P(µ ¯Pν) and R = 2P · ¯P. On support of these relations, T (4)
µν then reduces to
T (4)
µν = m2T (2)
µν + Bµν .
(5.16)
So the four-derivative gravitational equation of motions (5.14a) are indeed solved by
the two-derivative counterparts.
As a ﬁnal conﬁrmation of this Lagrangian we compare it with the bosonic part
of the action constructed by Ciceri and Sahoo for the same theory [165]. This ver-
sion of the action contains additional gauge ﬁelds associated with the symmetries of
the conformal group, which allow the full conformal symmetry (including conformal
boosts) to be realized covariantly. As they do not correspond to physical states we
remove them either by integration or gauge ﬁxing — for full details, see appendix B.
The double copy structure of the amplitudes of minimal conformal gravity is
inherited from the two-derivative theories, and follows the usual pattern for diﬀerent
degrees of supersymmetry,11
(N = 0, 1, 2, 4 min.CSG) =
 min.(DF)2
⊗(N = 0, 1, 2, 4 SYM) .
(5.17)
Given that amplitudes involving planewave states vanish in both minimal (DF)2
and minimal conformal (super)gravity the relation is trivially satisﬁed in this case.
A less trivial conﬁrmation is that this double copy also works when one external
state is taken as a non-planewave mode. This works because the minimal (DF)2 and
minimal conformal supergravity amplitudes are proportional to the ordinary Yang-
Mills and Einstein supergravity amplitudes, which obey the color-kinematics duality
and the double copy, respectively. We leave further conﬁrmation of the minimal-
theory double copy to future work.
11Note that this double-copy identiﬁcation is for the four-dimensional theories. For D > 4 the
Gauss-Bonnet term needs to be accounted for, which may alter the details.

Non-minimal conformal supergravity
We now proceed to the Lagrangian description of non-minimal conformal supergrav-
ities, and their associated scattering amplitudes. The bosonic parts of the complete
class of N = 4 supersymmetric Lagrangians were recently constructed by Butter,
Ciceri, de Wit and Sahoo [127]. The SU(4)-singlet part of their Lagrangian is

The diﬀerent conformal supergravities are encoded in terms of the zeroth-degree ho-
mogeneous free function F(φα). The SU(1,1)/U(1) coset ﬁeld Pµ and U(1)-covariant
derivative ˜∇µ were introduced in section 4.1. The (anti-)self-dual part of the Weyl
tensor is deﬁned as

(6.2)
where Wµνρσ was given in eq. (5.7). In this case, rather than construct an ansatz,
we obtained the above Lagrangian directly from ref. [127] by eliminating additional
gauge ﬁelds associated with conformal symmetries — for details, see appendix B.2.
The scalar function F is of primary interest to us, F = 1 corresponding to
the already-discussed minimal theory for which all planewave tree-level amplitudes
vanish (for m = 0). For non-minimal N = 4 conformal supergravities the presence
of F breaks the SU(1,1)×U(1) symmetry and allows for non-vanishing planewave
amplitudes. Using the parametrization of φα in terms of C (4.10), we notice that
any choice of F that is solely dependent on ¯C = φ2/φ1 (or, alternatively, dependent
on ¯τ) is a zeroth-degree homogeneous function as required. Our main focus is
F = i¯τ,
(6.3)
for which we observe that the tree-level amplitudes match those of the Berkovits-
Witten theory (3.11).12 However, before discussing this case in more detail we make
some remarks about amplitudes for arbitrary F.
6.1
Generic non-minimal amplitudes
Given that F may be considered a function of only ¯C, and that for sensible pertur-
bations around C = 0 it should also be analytic at the origin, we deﬁne it as a series
expansion:
F( ¯C) = 1 −2

12See also ref. [123] where the conformal anomaly of the Berkovits-Witten theory was analyzed
using the Lagrangian of ref. [127].
– 25 –

Diﬀerent theories are classiﬁed by the constants fj. As all terms inside the square
brackets of the non-minimal Lagrangian (6.1) are at least quadratic in the ﬁelds,
both the scalar and graviton propagators are unaﬀected by the fj. Therefore, the
propagators and on-shell states of the diﬀerent non-minimal conformal supergravities
matches that of minimal theory, which, as we explained in section 5.1, for physical
planewave states matches that of N = 4 Einstein supergravity (3.8). Our gauge ﬁxing
procedure and resulting propagators are described in full generality in appendix A.
The dependence on F in the conformal supergravities is through the interactions.
When F ̸= 1 the equations of motion for Einstein supergravity (5.11) no longer
imply those of the conformal theory. Therefore, tree-level conformal supergravity
amplitudes with physical planewave states are generally not proportional to those of
Einstein supergravity, hence they do not vanish. Henceforth we focus only on the
planewave states. The nontrivial amplitudes from the non-minimal Lagrangian (6.1)
can be calculated from Feynman diagrams. However, obtaining tree-level amplitudes
from solutions to the classical equations of motion is better. Berends-Giele recur-
sion [139] is our main tool for checking the amplitudes discussed in this and other
sections.
At three points only the three-scalar and two-graviton-one-scalar vertices are
modiﬁed with respect to the minimal theory. The three-scalar amplitudes are, how-
ever, still required to be zero due to the three-point kinematics pi · pj = 0. The only
non-zero three-point amplitudes are therefore
M3(h−−, h−−, C) = if1⟨12⟩4,
M3(h++, h++, ¯C) = if1[12]4 .
(6.5)
For generic f1 ̸= 0 these amplitudes clearly violate the U(1) symmetry, as the scalar
carries U(1) charge. The amplitudes can be supersymmetrized to capture the full
N = 4 content; the MHV amplitude takes the form M3(H−
1 H−
2 H−
3 ) = if1δ8(Q).
Proceeding to n-point amplitudes, the Feynman vertices that are needed can
only receive contributions from coeﬃcients up to fn−2, which itself ﬁrst appears in
the 2-graviton-(n−2)-scalar and n-scalar vertices. Although the resulting amplitudes
are more complicated, we can identify certain patterns by restricting the external
states. For instance, in the MHV sector if all external states are restricted to the H−
multiplet (3.8) then one can show that the amplitudes have no poles. They may be
expressed simply as
Mn(H−

2 · · · H−

(6.6)
where Sn(fj) is a constant function of fj for us to determine.

We have checked by explicit calculation that
M3(h−−, h−−, C) = if1⟨12⟩4,

M4(h−−, h−−, C, C) = i(f2 + 3f 2

(6.7d)
The numerical coeﬃcients are clearly combinatoric factors — for instance, the co-
eﬃcient of f1f2 in the ﬁve-point amplitude is 10 = 5!/(2! × 3!), which counts the
number of ﬁve-point diagrams involving a three- and a four-point vertex (f1 is asso-
ciated with the former and f2 with the latter). A recursive formula for Sn generalizes
this pattern to arbitrary multiplicity,

The same pattern also applies when one external state belongs to H+ in the

The amplitudes reduce to those of the all-minus sector (6.7) in the soft limit p1 →0,
in which case the extra kinematic function has the interpretation of a soft factor.
This agrees with the BCFW-inspired soft factor of ref. [166]; similar arguments using
these soft factors have been used to calculate anomalous one-loop N = 4 Einstein
supergravity amplitudes [154, 157].
6.2
The Berkovits-Witten theory
We remarked earlier that F = i¯τ gives rise to a theory whose MHV amplitudes match
those of the Berkovits-Witten twistor string (3.11).
Using the generic all-minus
amplitudes found in the previous subsection, this is easily conﬁrmed. Comparing the
expansion of F (6.4) with
i¯τ = 1 + ¯C
1 −¯C = 1 + 2
∞
X
j=1
¯Cj,
(6.10)
we ﬁnd that fj = −j!.
In this case Sn = (−1)n, so as expected the all-minus
amplitudes are Mn = i(−1)nδ8(Q). The one-plus amplitudes also agree: in the n-
point expression (6.9) we recognize the helicity-dependent soft function as coming
– 27 –

from the Berkovits-Witten formula (3.11). Given that at n points we uniquely ﬁx
fn−2 using the all-minus sector, the identiﬁcation F = i¯τ is complete.
Using numerical Berends-Giele recursion we have explicitly checked this for a
wide variety of scalar-graviton amplitudes up to n = 7, including M6(C, C, C, ¯C, ¯C, ¯C).
While this NMHV amplitude is not predicted by the Berkovits-Witten formula, we
have compared it with NMHV amplitudes coming from the double copy (DF)2⊗YM.
This provides nontrivial evidence for the validity of this double-copy construction for
a wider class of amplitudes than those considered by Berkovits and Witten.13
6.3
The mass-deformed theory
When studying minimal conformal supergravity we found it helpful to deform the
theory by a massive component proportional to the Einstein supergravity action,
thus realizing the ghost-like particles as massive states by breaking scale symmetry.
In non-minimal theories we can do the same,

With F = i¯τ the amplitudes of this theory are expected to arise from the double
copy between mass-deformed (DF)2 theory (3.12) and N = 4 SYM. They smoothly
interpolate between Berkovits-Witten conformal supergravity as m →0 and N =
4 Einstein supergravity as m →∞[11].
For instance, the following four-point
amplitudes depend non-trivially on the mass:

(6.12b)
while the remaining four-point amplitude M4(H+

4 ) is independent of mass.
All three reproduce the Berkovits-Witten amplitudes (3.11) when m = 0; the ghost-
like internal states are exposed as poles of the form (p2 −m2)−1, including in the
all-minus sector where previously the poles could not be resolved.
The N = 4
Einstein supergravity amplitudes are obtained after dividing by m2 (in order to get
amplitudes of correct dimension) and sending m →∞— only the M4(H+
1 H+

amplitude contributes in this limit.
We have checked these three amplitudes by explicit calculation, using both the
double copy and the conformal supergravity Lagrangian (6.11). We have also numer-
ically cross-checked the corresponding ﬁve-point amplitudes with those arising from
13This numeric check was made against both the (DF)2 Lagrangian of ref. [11] and the (DF)2
CHY integrand of ref. [33]. Ref. [167] provides a toolkit for the evaluation of such amplitudes in
the CHY framework.

the double copy. Again, the details of the gauge-ﬁxing procedure for performing
these checks starting from the Lagrangian (6.11) may be found in appendix A.
6.4
Coupling to vector multiplets
Another important deformation to the (DF)2 theory considered in ref. [11] was with
terms containing bi-adjoint scalars φaA (3.13), for which a coupling of the gravi-

was introduced in eq. (4.19). For completeness we have also
included the mass deformation.
First we consider vectors in the undeformed theory, m = 0, which is the full-
ﬂedged Weyl-YM theory coming from Witten’s twistor string. The Berkovits-Witten
MHV formula (3.11) generalizes to the single-trace sector as

By explicit calculation, again using both the double copy and starting from the
Lagrangian (6.13), we have conﬁrmed this for a wide variety of MHV amplitudes
involving gravitons, scalars and gluons up to seven points. There is a clear similarity
between these amplitudes and the supersymmetric Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) am-
plitudes given in eq. (4.21); interestingly though, here the formula holds regardless of
how many H−multiplets are scattered. Also by analogy to the EYM version (4.23),
the double-trace MHV amplitudes are

⟨12⟩· · · ⟨r−1, 1⟩⟨r, r+1⟩· · · ⟨nr⟩.
(6.15)
The only diﬀerence with EYM is the lack of an overall −p2
r,n factor, i.e. the momen-
tum exchanged between the two color traces. This is easily understood by realizing
that the graviton propagator is now −1/p2 times the two-derivative propagator (see
appendix A).
Finally we consider vector multiplets in the m ̸= 0 theory. By explicit calcu-
lation, we conﬁrm a smooth interpolation between the undeformed superconformal

amplitudes as m →0 and N = 4 EYM supergravity amplitudes as m →∞(after
multiplication by appropriate power of m2). At four points, in addition to the two

Conclusions
In this paper we have conﬁrmed that a wide variety of conformal supergravity tree
amplitudes have compatible Lagrangian and double-copy origins. In particular, we
have identiﬁed a non-minimal N = 4 conformal supergravity Lagrangian whose
physical planewave amplitudes are those of the Berkovits-Witten theory [12]. This
theory turns out to be a simple case of the inﬁnite class of non-minimal Lagrangians
derived by Butter, de Wit, Ciceri and Sahoo [127]. The tree amplitudes are predicted
by a double copy between N = 4 super-Yang-Mills and a (DF)2 theory, where
the latter gauge theory was introduced by Nohle and one of the present authors in
ref. [11]. We have checked this double-copy construction by comparing to explicit
calculations of conformal supergravity amplitudes from the Lagrangian, including
six-point NMHV amplitudes which were not given in the original work [12].
Conformal supergravity theories have four-derivative kinetic terms, and as such
they exhibit ghost-like states that are connected to non-unitary behavior.
More
speciﬁcally, four-derivative theories generally include both regular planewave modes
and unusual non-planewave modes that exhibit linear growth — the two are some-
times described as forming a dipole. Whether the non-planewave modes are accept-
able asymptotic states for the S-matrix is an interesting question [132, 137]; our
partial analysis seems to suggest that these states can be considered even if ampli-
tudes for such states may pick up a dependence on a constant auxiliary vector αµ.
As the four-derivative oﬀ-shell propagators are of the form 1/p4, the factorization
properties of amplitudes when internal lines go on-shell are somewhat delicate. We
have showed that the leading 1/p4 poles are uniquely associated with intermediate
planewave exchange, whereas subleading poles 1/p2 generically arise from internal
– 30 –

non-planewave states propagating into planewave states. Thus the planewave and
non-planewave states are not orthogonal.
The details of the states and propagator poles becomes clearer by introducing a
mass deformation, which we did for the various four-derivative theories considered
in this paper. This allows for a unique separation of the degrees of freedom into
massless and massive states, and amplitudes can be obtained using the standard
LSZ procedure. In the m →0 limit details of the massless theories can be more
easily inferred. Non-planewave modes emerge as an inﬁnitesimal diﬀerence between
the massless and massive modes, which is a prescription that generalizes to the
amplitudes of such states.
We use the prescription to compute tree amplitudes
that have one external non-planewave mode, giving us a handle on certain minimal
theories where the planewave modes give a vanishing tree-level S-matrix.
We found it useful to analyze the tree-level amplitudes of diﬀerent four-derivative
theories by using perturbative solutions to the classical equations of motion, where
external states are speciﬁed as boundary conditions. An analogous setup was used
by Maldacena for pure Weyl conformal gravity in AdS space [128]. The equations of
motion are automatically solved by the vacuum Einstein equations Rµν = 0, which
implies vanishing of the conformal gravity planewave tree amplitudes in the ﬂat-space
limit [129–131]. By considering mass-deformed theories in ﬂat space, we extended
this argument to any four-derivative theory whose equations of motion are implied
by those of a two-derivative theory. Such theories we refer to as being minimal, since
the minimal conformal supergravities (N = 4 and truncations thereof) fall into this
class. Knowing that the equations of motion for N = 4 Einstein supergravity should
imply those of minimal N = 4 conformal supergravity, we derived the Lagrangian of
the latter theory from ﬁrst principles. Other minimal four-derivative theories that we
considered include a scalar toy model studied in section 2 and the minimal (DF)2,
both of which have vanishing tree-level S-matrices for planewave states.
For the minimal theories we showed that amplitudes with a single non-planewave
state are non-vanishing, and moreover equal (up to a sign) to amplitudes in the corre-
sponding two-derivative theories. Using the properties of amplitudes of the minimal
theories, we have obtained suﬃciently non-trivial evidence to support identifying
minimal N = 4 conformal supergravity with a new double-copy construction involv-
ing minimal (DF)2 and N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory. Further work is required to
conﬁrm that the double-copy construction continues to hold for tree amplitudes with
more non-planewave modes, as well as the other states present in N = 4 conformal
supergravity in the form of gravitino multiplets [12, 165]. These questions we leave
for future work.
Non-minimal four-derivative theories diﬀer from minimal theories only by their
interactions. In N = 4 conformal supergravity, these new interactions arise from a
function F of the complex scalars that multiplies the self-dual (Weyl)2 term. For
F ̸= 1 the SU(1,1)/U(1) symmetry enjoyed by the minimal theory is broken, and this
– 31 –

allows for non-zero planewave amplitudes. The choice F = i¯τ, where τ = χ + ie−ϕ
is the usual complexiﬁed axion-dilaton ﬁeld, gives the Berkovits-Witten version of
the theory. The appearance of i¯τ in front of the self-dual (Weyl)2 term is analogous
to the vector ﬁeld strength’s coupling Einstein supergravity, where SU(1,1)/U(1)
symmetry is also broken. After including such terms for vector multiplets in the
Berkovits-Witten conformal supergravity Lagrangian, we calculated the correspond-
ing amplitudes and showed that they match the double-copy construction for Weyl-
YM theories given in ref. [11].
We have also calculated certain amplitudes for generic choices of F, and showed
that they take on a very simple form in the sector where all graviton multiplets are
chiral. It would be interesting to explore whether a double-copy construction exists
for generic choices of F. The question can be rephrased as whether it is possible
to ﬁnd further variants of the (DF)2 theory, by modifying interactions and ﬁeld
content, while at the same time preserving the color-kinematics duality of the theory.
Lifting the (DF)2 theory to D = 10 dimensions suggest that there are no obvious
deformations in D = 10, since the corresponding N = 1 conformal supergravity
theory has been argued to be unique [168] (and should presumably be identiﬁed with
the dimensionally-oxidized Berkovits-Witten theory). Similar uniqueness results can
be inferred from the string theory double copies of ref. [34] that also involve the (DF)2
theory in ten dimensions. However, in lower dimensions — such as D = 4 or D = 6
— there might be room for further deformations of the (DF)2 theory. Alternatively,
it is possible that the generic non-minimal N = 4 conformal supergravity theories
come from constructions of the type (N = 2) ⊗(N = 2), where the unknown gauge
theories are not constrained by maximal supersymmetry.
A natural extension to this work is to compute loop amplitudes in conformal
supergravity, in order to better study ultraviolet properties, as well as issues with
unitarity. The issue of unitarity will be more pressing, as ghosts and other states now
necessarily appear in the loops. This includes Faddeev-Popov ghosts that should be
added to the (DF)2 theory if we wish to use the double copy construction for oﬀ-shell
loop momenta, without resorting to unitarity techniques. Fradkin and Tseytlin [123–
126] have shown that N = 4 conformal supergravity, of either minimal or non-
minimal type, have no conformal anomalies given that four vector multiplets are
added to the spectrum. This suggest that the loop-level amplitudes of these gravity
theories are ultraviolet ﬁnite to all orders, which would be interesting to conﬁrm by
explicit calculation.

A
Gauge ﬁxing and the graviton propagator
The quadratic graviton terms in the Lagrangians of all conformal (super)gravities are
the same, so this analysis is applicable to both minimal and non-minimal theories.
The quadratic terms are
L = −1
2hµν□(□+ m2)hµν + 1
6h□(□+ 3m2)h −1
3h∂µ∂ν(□+ 3m2)hµν
+ hµν∂ν∂ρ(□+ m2)hρ
µ −1
3hµν∂µ∂ν∂ρ∂λhρλ + O(h3) ,
(A.1)
where h = hµµ (indices are raised and lowered with the Minkowski metric ηµν).
Diﬀeomorphism symmetry hµν →hµν + 2∂(µξν) is respected for all m; however,
dilatation symmetry hµν →hµν −2λDηµν of the quadratic terms is respected only
when m = 0. We therefore perform gauge ﬁxing in these two cases separately — for
m = 0 we use gauge-ﬁxing terms
LGF = (∂νhµν −1
2∂µh)□(∂ρhµρ −1
2∂µh) + 1
3(□h −∂µ∂νhµν)2 ,
(A.2)
where the ﬁrst ﬁxes diﬀeomorphism symmetry and the second dilatation symmetry.
The m = 0 graviton propagator is then
hµν
p
hρσ = −i
2
ηµρηνσ + ηµσηνρ −ηµνηρσ
p4
.
(A.3)
When m ̸= 0 we instead use
LGF = (∂νhµν)(□+ m2)(∂ρhµρ)
(A.4)
to ﬁx diﬀeomorphism symmetry. Although the resulting propagator is rather non-
trivial, it can be reduced using the observation that any numerator terms containing
projectors with explicit pµ are irrelevant. They cancel out in connected correlators
as pµJµν = 0, where Jµν is the Berends-Giele current. It is therefore sensible to use
hµν

hρσ =

ηµρηνλ+ηµληνρ−ηµνηρλ
p2
−ηµρηνλ+ηµληνρ−2
3ηµνηρλ
p2 −m2

.
(A.5)
While this resembles the partial-fractioned propagators we have seen earlier, it cannot
be brought together into a factorized form. This reﬂects the fact that when m ̸= 0
there is an extra on-shell massive graviton state, which decouples when m = 0 due
to the introduction of dilatation symmetry.
– 33 –

When computing conformal supergravity amplitudes involving only physical
planewave modes, a useful check on our results has been to compare the m = 0
gauge ﬁxing with m ̸= 0 in the m →0 limit, and in all cases we have found agree-
ment. One can see this from the propagators above: when m = 0 the trace part of
the Berends-Giele current Jµµ = 0, so trace parts of the propagators are irrelevant.
In this case the massive propagator can be brought into a form equivalent to the
massless propagator (A.3).

Covariant description of conformal supergravities
In this appendix we demonstrate the equivalence between the four-dimensional con-
formal supergravity Lagrangians used in this paper and those already given in the
supergravity literature [127, 165]. The key distinction is that, in addition to the vier-
bein eµa and the spin connection ωµab — where a, b, . . . are tangent-space indices —
these alternative superconformal constructions also contain the gauge ﬁelds bµ and
fµ
a associated with dilatations and conformal boosts respectively. To make contact
with our results we therefore eliminate these ﬁelds: the former by gauge ﬁxing special
conformal symmetry, and the latter by explicitly solving for it.14
B.1
The minimal theory
The bosonic terms in the minimal four-dimensional N = 4 conformal supergravity
Lagrangian are given by Ciceri and Sahoo [127]. The SU(4)-singlet part is

(B.1)
where R(M)+
abcd is the self-dual supercovariant curvature. Derivatives Da (containing
the new ﬁeld content) are covariant under both conformal and local U(1) transfor-
mations.
The local SU(1,1)/U(1) coset ﬁelds Pa and ¯Pa are deﬁned using these
derivatives:
Pa = φαϵαβDaφβ,
¯Pa = −φαϵαβDaφβ,
(B.2)
The U(1) gauge ﬁeld aµ solves φαDaφα = 0 (ignoring the fermionic contribution).
In addition to showing equivalence with the minimal Lagrangian (6.1) given in
the main body of this paper, it is also instructive to demonstrate this Lagrangian’s
invariance under conformal and U(1) transformations. As discussed in section 4.1,
14Except for our use of the mostly-minus metric ηab = diag(+, −, −, −), our conventions match
those of Freedman and Van Proeyen [169]. Chapter 15 of this book provides an excellent introduc-
tion to the superconformal construction of gravitational theories.

where λD(x) and λK
a(x) are the local gauge parameters associated with dilatations
and conformal boosts respectively.
Conformal-covariant derivatives Da = eaµDµ are assembled using the general
principle that, for any argument X,
DµX = DµX −δX|λD→bµ, λK a→fµa, λA→aµ,
(B.4)
where Dµ is the ordinary (non-conformal) covariant derivative containing the spin
connection ωµab (not to be confused with the gauge-covariant derivative (3.3)). For
instance, Dµφα = (∂µ −iaµ)φα matches ˜∇µφα as given in section 4.1; similarly,
DaP b = DaP b −ea

give us all required terms in the action (B.1).
Dilatation symmetry of the Lagrangian (B.1) follows trivially from the covari-
ance of all terms — δDe−1 = 4λDe−1 cancels the overall scaling. Verifying special
conformal symmetry is a little harder — some helpful intermediate results are
δK(DaP b) = 2δb

The ﬁrst of these has already been used to write down the covariant derivative (B.5c).
One ultimately ﬁnds that
δK(e−1L) = −8λK,a ¯PbD[aP b] + h.c.,
(B.7)
which vanishes on support of the Maurer-Cartan equations associated with the
SU(1,1)/U(1) coset space [127, 165].
To reproduce the minimal Lagrangian given in the main body of this paper (5.13)
(not including its mass deformation) we eliminate the additional ﬁeld content. First,

φαDaφα = 0 is solved to give aµ = iφα∂µφα. Special conformal transformations are
gauge ﬁxed by setting bµ = 0, giving λK,a = −1
2eaµ∂µλD. Then we use the following
constraints on superconformal curvatures [165]:
R(P)µν
a = 0,
(B.8a)
R(M)µν

(B.8b)
The ﬁrst of these identiﬁes ω = ˚ω[e], which is the torsion-free spin connection. The
second is solved for fµ

It follows that Wµνρσ = R(M)µν

abcd = (W +
µνρσ)2.
When this expression for fµ
a is substituted into the Lagrangian (B.1), together with
the covariant derivatives (B.5) and the gauge ﬁxing bµ = 0, the Lagrangian (6.1) is
reproduced up to topological terms.
B.2
The non-minimal theory
The bosonic part of the complete Lagrangian for all N = 4 conformal supergravities
has been constructed by Butter, Ciceri, de Wit and Sahoo [127]. Its SU(4)-singlet
part is

When F = 1, by dropping total-derivative terms one may re-express this result as
Ciceri and Sahoo’s minimal Lagrangian (B.1). By a completely analogous procedure
to that used for the minimal Lagrangian, we have eliminated bµ and fµ
a to obtain
the version (6.1) given in the main text.
