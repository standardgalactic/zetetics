Entropic self-assembly is governed by the shape of the constituent particles, yet a priori
prediction of crystal structures from particle shape alone is non-trivial for anything but the
simplest of space-ﬁlling shapes.
At the same time, most polyhedra are not space ﬁlling
due to geometric constraints, but these constraints can be relaxed or even eliminated by
suﬃciently curving space. We show using Monte Carlo simulations that the majority of
hard Platonic shapes self-assemble entropically into space-ﬁlling crystals when constrained
to the surface volume of a 3-sphere. As we gradually decrease curvature to “ﬂatten” space
and compare the local morphologies of crystals assembling in curved and ﬂat space, we
show that the Euclidean assemblies can be categorized either as remnants of tessellations in
curved space (tetrahedra and dodecahedra) or non-tessellation-based assemblies caused by
large-scale geometric frustration (octahedra and icosahedra).
Introduction – Particle shape has become an impor-
tant design parameter in material science [1–3], colloidal
self-assembly [4–6] and granular matter [7–9]. One exam-
ple of the importance of shape is systems of hard parti-
cles, which, due solely to entropy maximization, can self-
assemble into a zoo of diﬀerent colloidal crystals simply
by changing, even subtly, particle shape [10]. Although
methods exist to inversely design particle shapes likely to
self-assemble into targeted crystalline structures [11–14],
it is non-trivial to predict those structures from particle
shape, other than through molecular simulation.
This
challenge becomes apparent even for the simplest poly-
hedra, the Platonic solids. Particle shape directly deter-
mines both their assemblies [10, 15] – in which entropy is
maximized – and packings [10] – in which density is max-
imized. However, assemblies and packings are the same
only for some Platonic solids and polyhedra in general
[16].
Cubes are one example where the self-assembled
simple cubic (SC) crystal structure and densest packing
(a space-ﬁlling SC crystal) coincide [17]. Hard octahedra
and icosahedra do not ﬁll 3D space, but they, too, maxi-
mize entropy in crystals that coincide with their densest
packing structures: a rhombohedral and face-centered
cubic (FCC) structure, respectively [10, 18]. However,
hard dodecahedra self-assemble into a 20-particle unit
cell β-Manganese rotator crystal [10] with two distinct
local particle environments instead of its densest packing
structure, FCC [18]. Likewise, hard tetrahedra famously
form quasicrystals [19, 20] with a myriad of diﬀerent par-
ticle environments instead of the putative densest pack-
ing structure with a unit cell comprised of four tetrahe-
dra arranged in a double-dimer structure [19, 21]. Evi-
dently, densest packings, at least in Euclidean space, can-
not serve as indicators to predict self-assembly [22, 23].
But what of curved space?
Polyhedra fail to self-assemble their densest packing
structures when they fail to resolve global geometric con-
straints that prevent the polyhedra from maximizing en-
tropy locally as well as globally [24]. For example, en-
tropy is maximized for cubes when cube faces are aligned,
a motif consistent with the SC densest packing, and thus
no geometric constraints arise during assembly. Inspired
by studies of Frank-Kasper phases [25, 26], glasses[27–
31], tetrahelix sheets [32] and liquid crystal blue phases
[33–36], we investigate in this manuscript if and how hard
particle assemblies are related to space ﬁlling tessella-
tions of curved space. We hypothesize that, if we can
ﬁnd a suitable space with curvature K that permits a
shape to tessellate, then the shape will self-assemble into
a crystal based on the tessellation in that space because
the tessellating arrangement will maximize entropy. By
subsequently ﬂattening the space and monitoring the de-
fects that arise in the process, we posit that we will gain
predictive information on the likely structure of the Eu-
clidean (3D) assembly.
We ﬁrst tested our hypothesis by determining if,
in positively curved space, any of the ﬁve Platonic
solids self-assemble entropy maximizing,
tessellating
4-polytopes
with
no
global
geometric
frustration.
We performed hard particle Monte Carlo (HPMC)
simulations and show that tetrahedra,
dodecahedra
and octahedra self-assemble into their corresponding
4-polytopes, each in a diﬀerently curved space.
We
then geometrically frustrated the assemblies by simul-
taneously increasing the 3-sphere radius R=K−1 while
keeping packing fraction constant, thereby ﬂattening the
curved spaces. By comparing the local environments of
particles assembled in curved and in ﬂat space, we show
that the geometric incommensurability, that prevents
particles to form entropically favorable tessellations,
manifests itself in two diﬀerent ways as we gradually
ﬂatten space. Interestingly, the Euclidean assemblies of
tetrahedra and of dodecahedra still exhibit signs of their
3-sphere tessellations. The geometric frustration suﬀered

by the tessellating assembly as curved space is ﬂattened
resolves by the appearance of defects, leading to an
assembly with free volume distributed non-uniformly
through the structure.
In contrast, we ﬁnd that the
assemblies of octahedra and of icosahedra have a large
curvature mismatch between the curved spaces they
tessellate and Euclidean space,
and thus their 3D
assemblies are not related to defect-ridden tessellations
from curved space.
Instead, these shapes resolve the
geometric frustration in Euclidean space by maximizing
entropy
uniformly
among
all
the
particles,
result-
ing in colloidal crystals of considerably less complexity
than those assembled by tetrahedra and by dodecahedra.
Self-Assembly of 4-polytopes – The family of regular
4-polytopes can be identiﬁed as tessellations of the 3D
positively curved volume of a 3-sphere. We performed
HPMC simulations of the self-assembly of N=600 tetra-
hedra, N=120 octahedra and N=24 dodecahedra with
circumsphere diameter σ conﬁned to the 3-sphere into
4-polytopes corresponding to the 600-cell consisting of
600 tetrahedral cells, the 120-cell with 120 dodecahedral
cells and the 24-cell with 24 octahedral cells, respectively.
There exist even more tessellations of the three Platonic
solids both in hyperbolic and spherical space, but these
three tessellations deviate in curvature the least from ﬂat
Euclidean space, which makes them the strongest candi-
dates for a comparison with self-assembled 3D structures.
Because cubes already tessellate Euclidean space, and
icosahedral tessellations exist only in hyperbolic space,
we do not simulate these two shapes [37].
All self-
assembly simulations were carried out at constant pres-
sure and constant N. Fig. 1d shows equations of state
for all three shapes. The data indicates a ﬁrst-order tran-
sition from the disordered ﬂuid phase into a crystalline
phase for the tetrahedron and dodecahedron systems. Al-
though a ﬁrst-order transition is not evident in the octa-
hedron data, we suspect this is simply due to the neces-
sarily small system size [38, 39].
The crystal structures that self-assemble above the
transition pressure (or corresponding density) are quanti-
ﬁed by two diﬀerent types of radial distribution functions
(RDF; see Fig. 1b and c). The RDF gc(r) quantiﬁes spa-
tial correlations between particle centroids, and develops
peaks that coincide with the characteristic geodesic dis-
tances between cells of the ideal 4-polytopes. Similarly,
the RDF gv(r) calculated from the polyhedron vertices
develops peaks that ﬁt the dual lattices of the 600-cell
(dual: 120-cell), 120-cell (dual: 600-cell) and 24-cell (self-
dual). Moreover, we observe that during the formation
of the 120-cell, the dodecahedron particles ﬁrst achieve
translational order before they align their orientations,
indicating a transition from the isotropic phase into a
plastic 120-cell and then into a 120-cell crystal.
By further increasing the density in the 24 octahedra
and 120 dodecahedra system, the peaks of gc(r) and gv(r)
narrow into delta functions, indicating space-ﬁlling ideal
packings. Also, the stereographic projections of the self-
assembled structures reveal the formation of the tessel-
lations (see Fig. 1a and Movies 1-3). We were unable to
compress the 600 tetrahedra into the perfect tiling of the
3-sphere, instead, we observe a 600-cell with void defects
and interstitials at a maximum density ρ=0.96.
Defect stabilized 600-cell – To determine why the per-
fect 600-cell tessellation of tetrahedra does not assem-
ble at high densities we performed additional simulations
with slightly lower and higher numbers of particles (see

Fig. 1e). Whereas the octahedron and dodecahedron 3-
sphere systems are the most densely packed for the ideal
number of particles that correspond to their 4-polytopes,
the tetrahedron systems create the lowest local density
for N=585 when defects are present (see Movie 4). Also
the critical pressures at the phase transition and free
energy calculations in Fig. 2 indicate that the 600-cell
spherical lattice is stabilized by impurities at the tran-
sition with N=585. This stabilization of the crystalline
phase via vacancies is similar to the equilibrium SC phase
of hard cubes [17], where cubes form linear arrays that
can slide along each other adding another entropic con-
tribution and leading to the stabilization of the SC crys-
tal via the inclusion of void defects.
Analogously, the
600-cell can be separated into 20 linear arrays known as
tetrahelix loops, indicating a similar sliding mechanism
[40] (see Fig. 2b). Despite our free energy calculations,
which suggest that the hard tetrahedron system should
eliminate the vacancies at higher densities like hard cubes
do in Euclidean space, the hard tetrahedron system con-
ﬁned to the 3-sphere is conﬁgurationally trapped. Our
compression scheme without allowing temporary overlaps
[41], therefore, is unable to eliminate defects integrated
into the crystal structure after its initial assembly, result-

Bending into ﬂat space – To study how assemblies in
Euclidean space resolve geometrical incompatibilities so
that particles can arrange into entropically favored con-
ﬁgurations, we frustrated the 24-, 120- and 600-cell struc-
tures from curved space into Euclidean space.
Specif-
ically, we increased the number of particles on the 3-

all simulations with Noct∈[26, 480], Ndod∈[125, 1000] and
Ntet∈[620, 1000]. We quantiﬁed the assemblies locally by
calculating a set of Minkowski-weighted Steinhardt or-
der parameters (SOP) q4, q5, q6, q8, q10 and q12 [42, 43]
in Fig. 3 (see SI). If the number of polyhedra ﬁts the
number that can tessellate the 3-sphere perfectly, the
particles achieve a local environment that is in accor-
dance with the 4-polytope conﬁguration once they enter
the ordered state. When we slightly increase the number
of particles in all three systems, local environments are
introduced that deviate from their ideal 4-polytope ar-
rangements. Consequently, the region of typical particle
environments expands in the 6-dimensional SOP space,
while most particles keep 4-polytope-like environments
(see Fig. 3).
For the dodecahedron and tetrahedron systems, this
region of local environments characterized by SOPs re-
mains consistent even for a large number of added par-
ticles (i.e. considerable ﬂattening) and can also be iden-
tiﬁed as the typical environments of their representa-
tive ideal and thermalized self-assembled structures in
Euclidean space: the β-Manganese structure for dodec-
ahedra and the quasicrystal for tetrahedra.
Moreover,
the development of the local environments with decreas-
ing K indicates why these systems feature multiple lo-
cal particle arrangements in Euclidean space. The unit
cell of the β-Manganese crystal lattice, for example, con-
tains 20 atoms with two unique Wyckoﬀsites 8c and 12d
and, hence, two diﬀerent local environments. The Wyck-
oﬀsites are located in two diﬀerent regions within the
SOP space, where, remarkably, 8c is close to the ideal
120-cell environment for hard dodecahedra. By assign-
ing each environment during the ﬂattening process to
one of the Wyckoﬀpositions depending on their distance
in SOP space (see Fig. 4), we identify 8c as inherited
from the 3-sphere tessellation whereas 12d is a disclina-
tion integrated into the 120-cell structure. In assemblies
with a small number of added dodecahedra N∈[120, 200]
the particles arrange mostly in an 8c-like local environ-
ment with only a few particles accumulating around the
12d environment. By ﬂattening space further, more de-
fects arise, which is in accordance with the increase in
12d-like environments. The ratio between 8c-like parti-
cles converges towards a value between the ideal ratio
of sites in a β-Manganese crystal N8c
N = 8
20=0.4 and a ra-
tio obtained from a self-assembled β-Manganese crystal
N8c
N =0.31±0.02.
Similarly the multiple environments in the quasicrystal
of hard tetrahedra can be interpreted as defects. Even
by comparing the SOPs between a quasicrystal and the
self-assembled 600-cell structure with void defects we de-
tect that the local environments match (see Fig. SI1).
By ﬂattening space, more and more particles obtain the
quasicrystalline environments. We, therefore, argue that
the quasicrystal is a result of the entropic gain to inte-
grate diﬀerent defects into the 600-cell that allows for
the development of a variety of diﬀerent local environ-
ments that we interpret as vacancies and interstitials in
the 600-cell.
However, hard octahedron systems with many added
particles Ntotal>50 paint a diﬀerent picture.
Here,
the octahedron assembly must overcome a larger curva-
ture diﬀerence to ﬂatten the 24-cell (∆K24≈1.571σ−1)
compared to the 120-cell (∆K120≈0.776σ−1) or 600-cell
(∆K600≈0.764σ−1). Therefore, the strategy of entropy
compartmentalization[44, 45] by adding defects to the 24-
cell eventually becomes less eﬃcient than maximizing en-
tropy by forming crystals with only one type of local envi-
ronment reminiscent of the rhombohedral crystal. This
phenomenon draws similarities to frustration escape in
geometrically frustrated assemblies (GFAs) of deformable
particles with open boundaries[46–49]. Despite not being
dominated by entropy but instead energetic contributions
such as particle deformation, binding between building
blocks, and boundary energy terms, GFAs also feature
an incompatibility between the locally preferred order
and global constraints. Similar to the space curvature in
our hard particle assemblies, the particle shape rigidity in
GFAs dictates if it is energetically more favorable for the
system to accumulate stresses without loosing locally pre-
ferred order (rigid self-limiting regime) or to escape the
frustration by deforming the particles (soft bulk regime).
Hence, the self-assembled structure of hard octahedra is
not based on a 3-sphere tessellation. Instead the assem-
bly is more related to the densest packing in Euclidean
space, which indicates how to accommodate global and
local geometric frustration uniformly.
Although we do not perform a similar computational
study with icosahedra, we observe in Fig. 3d that the
typical local environments of the self-assembled FCC
crystal of icosahedra show the same characteristics as
the octahedron system.
Within the SOP space the
icosahedra sit in-between an ideal FCC and the ideal
neighborhood of the icosahedral honeycomb (IH) tes-
sellation of hyperbolic 3-space, but are clearly detached
from the latter. This suggests that, like the octahedron
system, the occurrence of the FCC crystal in hard
icosahedron systems is also caused by the large diﬀer-

5
ence in curvature between the IH and Euclidean space.
As in the octahedron system, the frustration of being
geometrically
restricted
from
tessellating
Euclidean
space is distributed uniformly.
Therefore, we surmise
that the FCC phase is not related to the IH tessellation
in hyperbolic space, but rather to the densest packing in
Euclidean space.
Conclusion – In this Letter, we related the assembly of
complex colloidal crystal structures of hard polyhedra to
tessellations in curved space. By performing MC simula-
tions of hard tetrahedra, octahedra and dodecahedra on
positively curved 3-spheres, we showed that the particles
thermodynamically self-assemble their 4-polytope tessel-
lations. This observation indicates that the particles will
adopt their locally optimal conﬁgurations based on tes-
sellations if no geometrical restrictions are present, such
as those that occur for these systems when they attempt
to crystallize in Euclidean space. Moreover, we observed
by ﬂattening space that the equilibrium colloidal crystal
structures of the Platonic solids in Euclidean space can
be separated into two categories.
The ﬁrst category
includes entropy maximizing, self-assembled structures
in ﬂat space that can be understood as remnants of
perfect tessellations in curved space. The dodecagonal
quasicrystal reported in hard tetrahedron assemblies
can be traced back to the 600-cell and its low entropic
cost to implement defects into the crystal.
Likewise,
the β-Manganese conﬁguration of hard dodecahedra
stems from the 120-cell, with one Wyckoﬀsite of the
β-Manganese crystal identiﬁed as a local environment
native to the 120-cell tessellation, and the other Wyckoﬀ
site identiﬁed as a defect of the ideal 120-cell structure.
The second category includes self-assembled crystals
in 3D space that do not stem from tessellations in
curved space, such as the rhombohedral crystal of hard
octahedra or the FCC crystal of hard icosahedra. Their
corresponding space-ﬁlling tessellations require spaces
with considerably larger curvature than the tessellations
of the tetrahedron or dodecahedron.
Consequently,
maximizing entropy by introducing defects is only eﬃ-
cient when the system is slightly ﬂattened. In Euclidean
space,
these
assemblies
instead
adopt
a
geometric
compromise where entropy maximization is achieved
uniformly through a single type of local environment.
Although we focused only on hard shapes so far, our
ﬁndings probably also apply to systems with enthalpic
contributions considering the mathematical description
of Frank-Kapser phases as disclinated 600-cells [25, 26].
Hence, introducing additional degrees of freedom that
help resolving geometric frustration – such as shape
deformability or ﬂexible particle bonds – might allow
us to broaden the curvature window, where assemblies
based on non-Euclidean crystals minimize free energy,
and guide the prediction of new self-assembly structures.

Methods
We perform Monte Carlo simulations of hard polyhedra with circumsphere diameter σ in positively curved three-
dimensional space. We model the 3-dimensional space with constant curvature K as a spherical conﬁnement in four
dimensions such that all points r = (w, x, y, z) of the spherical polyhedra are embedded in the surface volume of a
hypersphere with radius R = 1
K
R2 = w2 + x2 + y2 + z2.
(1)
Computationally, these simulations are realized by implementing hyperspherical boundary conditions into Hoomd-
blue v2.9 [1] and representing both the position and orientation of each polyhedron by a pair of quaternions. The
algorithm allows for three Monte Carlo moves: translation via parallel transportation along geodesic great circle lines,
local rotation around a randomly chosen axis and reﬂections at the face of the polyhedron. The exact scheme is
detailed in Ref. [2].
A conﬁgurational change within a Monte Carlo step is accepted based on the excluded volume between particles.
Hence, to determine the overlap between two polyhedra we considered geodesic distances on the hypersphere surface
volume instead of 4-dimensional Euclidean distances. This means that the whole bodies of the polyhedra live on the
hypersphere surface. Consequently, the edges and faces spanned by the vertices all lie on geodesic lines and geodesic
planes, respectively, and are curved according to R. Numerically, we check for intersections between particles using
a XenoColloide algorithm scheme [3] modiﬁed to positively curved spaces by applying spherical instead of Euclidean
trigonometry. The maximum translational and rotational step is chosen such that around 50% of change attempts
are accepted.
For our simulations we perform multiple sets of NV T-simulations. Starting from a set number of particles N we
start the simulations at a high hypersphere radius R = N
1
3 such that the polyhedra are in an isotropic gas phase.
After every 1000th Monte Carlo step we attempt to decrease R by a factor of 0.999 to both slowly increase the packing
fraction and the curvature of the space. The attempt is successful if no overlaps have been detected and the simulation
continues with the new radius. Otherwise, the system is reset to the radius before the attempt. At every increment
of ∆R = 0.2σ the system is equilibrated for 1 × 106 Monte Carlo steps to avoid frustration during the process. These
compression steps are repeated until 100 consecutive shrinking attempts have failed. For each number of particles,
we ran 5 replica simulations.
Additional to the NV T-simulations we also run sets of isobaric simulations to determine the phase transition of
polyhedra from the isotropic gas phase into ordered crystal structures. For the volume move attempts we increase or
decrease the radius of the hypersphere. We choose the maximum radius move size such that roughly 50% of volume
move attempts are successful. We start from a low pressure P = 1 and increase the pressure by ∆P = 0.5 every
2 × 106 steps. For the last 1 × 106 Monte Carlo steps on each pressure level we determine the hypersphere radius to
determine the phase transitions.

Steinhardt order prameter
To determine the local environments within the polyhedra system we calculate the rotationally invariant Minkowski
weighted Steinhardt order parameters ql with l ∈{3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12} for each particle i [6, 7].

with the number of neighbors Nb, weights wij and the polar angles θij and φij between the bond of i and j. To
calculate the polar angles from the 4-dimensional position data of the particles we map all neighbor particles j to the
ﬂat 3-dimensional space that is tangential to the hypersphere and touches it at the position of particle i. Afterwards,
we determine the angles according to the bond vector rij and the orientation of particle i. The polar angles are the
same on the hypersphere and the tangential space as the mapping is conformal and preserves all angles between
directed vectors. For Minkowski weighted Steinhardt order parameter the weights are deﬁned as wij = Aij
Ai , where Ai
is the surface area of the Voronoi polyhedra around particle i and Aij is the area of the face between particle i and
j. We construct the Voronoi tessellation on the hypersphere by calculating the 4-dimensional convex hull around the
central position of each particle. As the particles live on the surface volume of the hypersphere, the 4D convex hull
is equivalent to a Delauney tetrahedralization in spherical space. The dual lattice of the Delauney tetrahedralisation
then corresponds to the Voronoi tessellation.
