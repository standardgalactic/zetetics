RPA Definitions 
› Attended RPA is defined as:
“Automation that interacts in real time with humans who initiate and control robot tasks, often 
embedding functions within apps., generally associated with front-office, agent-led activities.” 
› Unattended RPA is defined as:
“Automation that replaces a complete human function in a ‘lights-out’ “batch-oriented” 
manner, creating a virtual workforce, generally associated with back-office activities.”
› Hybrid RPA is defined as:
“Automation that combines attended and unattended  tasks that work together, generally 
associated with processes that span front and back-office activities.”

Firms expect 
different use cases

building blocks to 
form digital workers
Q4. Select the most probable combination of RPA and AI building blocks that will 
form digital workers? 
32%
29%
20%
19%
RPA supporting tasks driven by sensors and predictive analytics
e.g. IoT applications
RPA combined with machine learning to handle more complex
decision making in back office and mid office applications
RPA supporting unstructured content analytics e.g. supporting
tasks based on documents and forms input
RPA supporting customer facing chatbots (NLP/AI) to execute
tasks
Unsure if I’m interpreting this correctly – but 
it seems like firms have a lot of different use 
cases for RPA/AI to form digital workers

› Governance basics are being defined as we automate.
• Connectivity monitoring
• Out-of-the-box version control apps
• Centrally controlled rollback capabilities
• And testing procedures for application changes
› Process knowledge gaps create governance issues.
› Keep governance light but effective.
• Governance requires a decision-making group.
• Involve delivery and engagement team.
• Track catalog of ideas.
• Develop rules to prioritize — complex or simple — ROI and estimate 
delivery time.

Enterprise-grade 
RPA Background/context 
of the research

Much talk of enterprise-grade RPA, but what 
is it and why does it matter?
Everest Group is conducting survey-based research on:
• What is enterprise-grade RPA?
• Which features users believe to be the most important?
• What benefits can be realized from having these?
• What features are most valued by different industries and why?
This presentation highlights our interim findings. Everest Group will publish the full 
results in a report very soon.

Why enterprise-grade RPA matters? 
Implementing 
RPA across 
multiple 
business units
Reducing 
error rates & 
exceptions in 
automation
Speed of 
implementation
Speed to scale
Implementing 
RPA across 
multiple 
geographies
Helping 
regulatory 
compliance
Increasing 
process 
automation 
rates
Achieving 
faster ROI
It can contribute to the success of automation projects in many different ways:

RPA is a journey and the richness of the software 
speeds up that journey
Interim findings:
•
Users consider ease of software and robot maintenance, security and scalability to be the most important features of 
enterprise RPA
•
These reduce the effort that is needed to develop, run and maintain robots
•
More than 75% of enterprises are satisfied with their RPA ROI
•
Integrated cognitive and ML for processing unstructured data is important as is the availability of robot operational analytics
What you can learn from this research:
• What features to look for in RPA software
• What your peers or your industry believe to be the most important features of this type of technology
• Get insights on how different your take is on these and work out why that is
• What commercial models are available and preferred by different types of enterprises
• If you are achieving ROI in-line with other RPA users
