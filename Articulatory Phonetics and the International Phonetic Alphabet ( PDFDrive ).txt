Review: The Fundamental Question
A slight - but important - change in the wording:
▶What is the system of rules and mental representations
that underlies out ability to speak and understand a
human language?
(‘mental representation’ = the information stored in our
memory, which the ‘rules’ of our linguistic systems
operate over)

The Relevance of Sound
Fact:
For spoken language, some of those rules and mental
representations concern the production of sound.
▶When we speak an oral language, we produce sounds.
▶And so, our brains must in some way be encoding those
sounds (and how to make them).

Problem: The Representation of Phones
But, before we can start this project, we have a bit of a
problem:
▶We’re going to be talking about the sounds of human
languages (phones)...
▶Therefore, we’re going to need some way of
representing those sounds (phones) in written text.

▶English spelling is often ambiguous.
▶‘read’ can be read as sounding like ‘reed’ or ‘red’
▶There are phones in other languages that don’t exist
in English
▶The sound “ch” in German, or “tl” in Nahuatl.

What We Need:
An alphabet for representing phones (speech sounds)
which:
▶Is not ambiguous.
▶Every symbol stands for just one sound.
▶Every sound is represented by just one symbol.
▶Is not speciﬁc to a single language.
▶Any sound in any human language can be
represented.

▶[s] = an ‘s’ sound
▶[t] = a ‘t’ sound
▶[h] = an ‘h’ sound
▶In other cases, IPA and English spelling diverge:
▶[i] = an ‘ee’ sound
▶[e] = an ‘ay’ sound
Note:
To distinguish them, we will enclose IPA symbols in
square brackets ‘[ ]’

▶How?
We will precisely describe the phone they represent,
using four key properties of their articulatory phonetics:
▶Manner of Articulation:
How the oral tract is manipulated during production
of the sound
▶Place of Articulation:
Where the oral tract is manipulated during
production of the sound
▶Nasality:
Whether the velum is lowered during production of
the sound
▶Voicing:
Whether the vocal folds are vibrating during
production of the sound

Voicing
“Voicing” refers to whether the vocal folds are vibrating or
not while the phone is being made.
▶Voiced:
Vocal folds vibrate while the phone is being made
▶Voiceless:
Vocal folds don’t vibrate while the phone is made.

Summing Up:

basis of voicing
▶Voiced sounds are produced with vibration of the
vocal folds.
▶Voiceless sounds are produced with no vibration of

Summary
Nasality
“Nasality” refers to whether the velum is raised or
lowered during the production of the sound.
▶Nasal: the velum is lowered during the sound
(and so air is ﬂowing through the nasal cavity)
▶Oral: the velum is raised during the sound
(and so air is ﬂowing through the mouth)

What We’ve Seen So Far:
The consonants of English can be categorized on the
basis of:
▶Whether they are voiced or voiceless
▶Whether they are nasal or oral
▶Their place of articulation.
▶Labial (biliabial or labio-dental)
▶Dental
▶Alveolar
▶Alveopalatal

Stops
A stop is a phone that involves a complete blockage of
the oral tract.
▶(It’s a stop if there’s no air coming out of your mouth when
you make the sound.)
Example: [s] vs. [t]
▶When you make [t], airﬂow stops completely and is
released
▶When you make [s], airﬂow never stops

Fricatives
A fricative is a phone that is made by a radical narrowing
of the oral tract
▶When air moves through this narrow passage, the
airﬂow becomes turbulent.
▶This turbulent airﬂow makes a characteristic ‘hissing’
sound.
Example: [s] vs. [t]
▶When you make [t], airﬂow stops completely and is
released
▶When you make [s], you make a very narrow
constriction, but air still ﬂows out.

An affricate is a phone that is made up of two parts:
▶It begins as a stop (complete closure of the oral tract)
▶It ends as a fricative (narrow closure of the oral tract)
Illustration: ‘top’ vs. ‘shop’ vs. ‘chop’
▶‘Top’ begins with a stop (total closure, then total release).
▶‘Shop’ begins with a fricative (narrow closure).
▶‘Chop’ begins with an affricate.
▶It starts off with a total closure
▶But, we don’t just totally release it (like a stop)
▶We partially release it, into a [S]

Approximants
An approximant is a phone that involves a narrowing of
the oral tract that is:
▶less radical than with a fricative
▶more radical than with a vowel
Tip:
More informally, approximants are somewhere in
between consonants and vowels (and so are sometimes
called semi-vowels).
