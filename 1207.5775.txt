A graphical presentation of the timing of avalanche photodiode events in the datasets from the
experiment of Weihs et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5039 (1998)] makes manifest the existence of
two types of signal delay: (1) The introduction of rapid switching of the input to a pair of trans-
verse electro-optical modulators causes a delay of approximately 20 nanoseconds for a proportion
of coincident avalanche photodiode events; this eﬀect has been previously noted, but a diﬀerent
cause is suggested by the data as considered here. (2) There are delays that depend on in which
avalanche photodiode an event occurs; this eﬀect has also been previously noted even though it
is only strongly apparent when the relative time diﬀerence between avalanche photodiode events
is near the stated 0.5 nanosecond accuracy of the timestamps (but it is identiﬁable because of 75
picosecond resolution). The cause of the second eﬀect is a diﬀerence between signal delays for the
four avalanche photodiodes, for which correction can be made by straightforward local adjustments
(with almost no eﬀect on the degree of violation of Bell-CHSH inequalities).

INTRODUCTION
There have been several analyses of the datasets gen-
erated by the experiment of Wiehs et al. [1, 2]. Two, due
to Hnilo, Kovalsky, and Santiago [3], and Adenier and
Khrennikov [4], are particularly singled out by Weihs [5].
More recently, Zhao et al.
have analyzed the data as
part of a program to construct a computational model
that violates Bell inequalities [6].
The Weihs et al.
datasets contain, for a number of
runs, a recorded timestamp when an event occurred in
any of four avalanche photodiodes (APDs), together with
a binary record of the input to a transverse electro-optical
modulator at the time of each APD event. The times-
tamps have an accuracy of 0.5 nanoseconds and a reso-
lution of 75 picoseconds. The dataset for each run is in
two locally recorded parts, labelled “Alice” and “Bob”,
containing data collected at each end of the experiment.
The published papers and these datasets are the principal
historical record of the Weihs et al. experiment, which
together satisfy Bohr’s requirement that an experiment
must be classically described. At this level of description,
the datasets are essentially a nonlocal, contextual classi-
cal description of the whole experiment’s results, which
are well-known to be incompatible with a local, noncon-
textual classical particle model.
Section II describes a graphical presentation of three

datasets, longdist35, locbell2, and bellstat1, which diﬀers
from previous analysis by using the diﬀerence between
APD timings as a coordinate instead of considering co-
incidence of APD events as a binary value that is true
if the diﬀerence between their timings is less than the
width of a chosen window (which in the case of Weihs et
al.’s analysis was 4 nanoseconds, which the data suggests
as an appropriate width). The ﬁrst of the three datasets
considered uses two 500 meter ﬁber optic cables to dis-
tribute light from the central light source and a Paramet-
ric Down-Conversion (PDC) crystal to two remote sites,
at each of which there is a transverse electro-optical mod-
ulator, the output of which is directed to a dynamically
modiﬁed polarizer and thence to a pair of APDs; for the
second and third of these datasets the transverse electro-
optical modulators, the polarizers, and the two pairs of
APDs are close to the light source and the PDC crys-
tal. For the ﬁrst two of these datasets, the input signals
to the transverse electro-optical modulators are switched
rapidly between two values, whereas for the third dataset
there is a constant input signal to the transverse electro-
optical modulators.
The comparison of the ﬁrst two datasets with the third
dataset enables us to show in Section III that rapid
switching of the inputs to the transverse electro-optical
modulators causes a delay of approximately 20 nanosec-
onds for a proportion of coincident APD events.
We
also show in Section IV that there is a correlation of
APD events with the relative timing of APD events, on
a time-scale of approximately 1 nanosecond. It is clear
that these correlations are caused by diﬀerent timing de-
lays for the two APD signal channels (as suggested to

the author by Gregor Weihs), because adjusting the tim-
ings of the data for the two channels by a constant oﬀset
eliminates the eﬀect. Both delays have been previously
identiﬁed [7], however graphical presentation makes the
delays more immediately apparent.
Larsson and Gill [8] show that there is a “coincidence
loophole” that is distinct from the “detection loophole”,
which the Weihs et al.
experiment is well-known not
to close.
The 1 nanosecond time-scale of the correla-
tions described here, however, does not immediately sug-
gest a communication protocol that would allow a hid-
den variable model to be constructed. In particular, the 1
nanosecond time-scale is less than the 4 nanosecond time-
scale of typical window widths, so these correlations are
in a diﬀerent regime than the timing correlations that are
hypothetically introduced by Zhao et al. [6] as part of a
hidden variable model.
Although essentially self-contained, the analysis of the
Weihs et al.
datasets that is described here is partly
motivated by a random ﬁeld perspective on quantum
ﬁelds [9–11], which suggests a close look at the datasets
using methods of (stochastic) signal analysis.
In par-
ticular, precise diﬀerences of the relative timing of the
coincidence of APD events seem more likely to be of in-
terest from a ﬁeld perspective, instead of the less detailed
binary fact of approximate coincidence that is suggested
by a quantized photon perspective. Methods of signal
analysis are also adopted by Hnilo, Kovalsky, and Santi-
ago [3].
II.
A GRAPHICAL PRESENTATION OF THE
DATASETS
A C++ program was written to construct Embed-
ded PostScript graphs for a given dataset, either from
Alice’s perspective or from Bob’s perspective. For the
case of Alice’s perspective, we plot the time diﬀerence
tA −(tB(tA)−oﬀset) at each time tA at which there is an
APD event at A (Alice’s location), where tB(tA)−oﬀset is
the closest time to tA at which there is an APD event at B
(Bob’s location), with an oﬀset that allows for a slight dif-
ference between timestamps at A and at B that is more-
or-less constant over time periods of ten seconds (the
oﬀsets for the datasets considered here, longdist35, loc-
bell2, and bellstat1, are +4 nanoseconds, −12.5 nanosec-
onds, and +10.7 nanoseconds, respectively, with the sign
reversed when considering Bob’s perspective).
A neg-
ative value of tA −(tB(tA) −oﬀset) corresponds to an
APD event at A being earlier than the APD event at
B that is closest in time to it.
At each coordinate
(tA, tA −(tB(tA) −oﬀset)) a symbol is plotted that rep-
resents the binary input to the transverse electro-optical
modulator, which for the datasets discussed correspond

either to angles of 0◦or 45◦for Alice, or to angles of 22.5◦
or 67.5◦for Bob. The symbol plotted also represents in
which of the two APDs there was an event, which is taken
to add 90◦to the angle. Internally, the numbers 0, 1, 2,
and 3 are recorded, which correspond, for the datasets
discussed, to angles 0◦, 45◦, 90◦, and 135◦for Alice, and
to angles 22.5◦, 67.5◦, 112.5◦, and 147.5◦for Bob, which
are represented graphically by a square, a diamond, a
cross, and an “x”. If the APD event at A that is one of
a coincident pair is close to more than one APD event at
B, or if the APD event at B that is one of a coincident
pair is close to more than one APD event at A, the coinci-
dent pair is tagged as a multiple coincidence, represented
graphically by an “M”, and ignored for the purposes of
computing the violation of Bell-CHSH inequalities.

DELAYS CAUSED BY THE TRANSVERSE
ELECTRO-OPTICAL MODULATOR
Figures 1 and 2 show a vertical ±200 nanosecond sec-
tion and a vertical ±3 nanosecond section of the graph
for the whole ten seconds of data for longdist35 from Al-
ice’s perspective; subsequently we will show graphs for
only the ﬁrst two seconds of data, which are adequate
for our purpose here, more readable, and result in smaller
Embedded PostScript ﬁles. It is necessary to show dif-
ferent vertical sections of the graph to make diﬀerent
features of the data visually apparent. Note that there
is a wide stripe within approximately ±20 nanoseconds
in which there is a greater density of APD events, and
a narrower stripe within approximately ±1 nanosecond
in which there is a much greater density of APD events.
The density of APD events beyond ±20 nanoseconds is
approximately uniform. For comparison, the character-
istic lengths of the elementary geometry of the experi-
ment are a straight line separation between A and B of
400 meters and a separation between A and B along the
ﬁber optic cable light guide of 1000 meters, correspond-
ing to characteristic times of approximately 1.3 microsec-
onds and 3.3 microseconds at the speed of light. In the
vertical ±3 nanosecond section, an apparent drift of the
relative times of APD events at A and B over 10 sec-
onds is visible, which is consistent with properties of the
clocks that are used to provide timestamps, described
by Gregor Weihs as providing “a relative accuracy of
8 · 10−11, corresponding to 4.8 [nanoseconds], for a 60
[second] interval”[5]. The more-or-less linear drift over a
ten-second timescale allows for a straighforward adjust-
ment of the timestamps.
The stripe of APD event pairs that are within ±20
nanoseconds of each other is also present in the dataset
locbell2 (not shown), from both Alice’s and Bob’s per-
spective, but it is not present in the dataset bellstat1,

for which a vertical ±50 nanosecond section is shown in
Figure 3, nor in any of the datasets bellstat0, bellstat2,
and bellstat3. The dataset bellstat1 is less than 2 seconds
long; only two types of APD events are present because
there is no switching of the transverse electro-optical
modulator. Except for the dataset bellstat1, the binary
input to the transverse electro-optical modulator is cho-
sen randomly approximately every 100 nanoseconds. It
takes approximately 14 nanoseconds to switch from one
setting to another, during which time APD events are ig-
nored [5]. Given the diﬀerent distribution of APD event
pairs when there is no rapid switching of the transverse
electro-optical modulator, and given that the 14 nanosec-
ond period during which APD events are ignored is a
comparable time-scale to the 20 nanosecond broadening
of coincidences of APD events, it seems likely that the
eﬀect is caused by either electrical or optical properties
of the rapid switching of the transverse electro-optical
modulator. Ag¨uero et al. suggest that the “cause is a
drift between the clocks at stations A and B” because
their experiment uses a single clock and does not show a
broadening of coincidences [7], however there is no rea-
son to think that the clock is inaccurate on the relatively
coarse scale of ±20 nanoseconds in the Weihs et al. ex-
periment.
IV.
TIMING CORRELATIONS IN LONG
DISTANCE DATASETS
It is already apparent in Figure 2 that there is a strong
correlation on a nanosecond scale between the direction
associated with APD events at A and the time diﬀerence
between the APD events at A and B. The correlation
is easily visible in Figure 4, for the dataset longdist35
(and is equally visible for the dataset longdist34, which
is not shown), but is not as evidently present in Figure
6, for the dataset locbell2, the diﬀerence being the ex-
tensive modiﬁcation of the experimental apparatus nec-
essary to introduce a much greater distance between the
APDs and two lengths of 500 meters of ﬁber optic cable
for longdist35 (and for longdist34).
The precision of the correlation is greater from Alice’s
perspective than from Bob’s perspective, as can be seen
by comparison of Figures 4 and 5 (note that relative time
diﬀerence from Bob’s perspective has the opposite sign
to relative time diﬀerence from Alice’s perspective).
The apparent correlation can be eliminated, however,
by essentially local adjustments that depend only on
which APD the event occurred in, eﬀectively because
the electronics associated with the four APDs introduce
slightly diﬀerent delays. The consequent Figures 7 and
8 show the result of including both an adjustment for
timing drift of 50ps per second and local detector adjust-
ments of 0.0ns and 0.9ns for Alice and 4.4ns and 4.7ns
for Bob, instead of a uniform less detailed adjustment of
4 nanoseconds between Alice and Bob that is used for
Figures 4 and 5. The adjustments required for locbell2
are not as great.
V.
CONCLUSION
Although the rapid switching of the transverse electro-
optical modulator does not change the signal enough to
invalidate the results or interpretation of the Weihs et
al. experiment, nonetheless it is a matter of concern that
rapid switching introduces a distortion of APD event tim-
ings on a time-scale of 20 nanoseconds, which is enough to
have a technological impact in some circumstances. The
local adjustments for diﬀerent signal delays for diﬀerent
detectors are relatively small and of marginal interest in
the Weihs experiment.

DISCUSSION
This paper is not intended for publication, so I include
here fragmentary comments on quantum mechanical ex-
periments —for which Bell-violating experiments have
now become the most common example, replacing the
old favorite, the double-slit experiment— that are rather
disconnected from the analysis of Gregor Weihs’ experi-
ment that is the paper’s main purpose, but that may be
of interest to readers of the Bell inequality literature.
Although we can often describe experimental appara-
tus coarsely using operators and states that act on low-
dimensional Hilbert spaces, it is a nontrivial task to con-
struct experimental apparatus that can be described ac-
curately in such simple terms. If we wish to describe an
experimental apparatus accurately we generally must re-
sort to quantum ﬁeld models, unless we have taken great
care to ensure that an experimental apparatus is dynam-
ically elementary. This is analogous to descriptions of a
pendulum as a simple harmonic oscillator, which may be
quite accurate as a ﬁrst approximation, even for some-
thing as complex as a child’s swing, but it is no small
thing to construct a classical system that can be very ac-
curately modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator, so that,
for example, it may be used as an accurate clock. For the
purposes of quantum computation and other technolog-
ical applications of the mathematics of quantum theory,
it is desirable to construct devices that are accurately

describable using operators and states that act on low-
dimensional Hilbert spaces, but it is a diﬃcult engineer-
ing feat.
From a classical thermodynamics point of view, we ex-
pect the statistics of the APD events to be determined
by the geometrical conﬁguration of the whole apparatus,
because the conﬁguration of the experimental apparatus
determines the properties of the coarse-grained equilib-
rium state of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and of the PDC
crystal and APDs that interact with it.
Even though
at a ﬁne-grained level there are many non-equilibrium
APD events, nonetheless in terms of those statistics of
the properties of the APD events that are generally re-
producible on time-scales of seconds or minutes, the ex-
periment is at equilibrium. Indeed, it is precisely required
that at least some statistics must be reproducible in or-
der for us to claim that we are doing a Scientiﬁc experi-
ment, but there is no rule about what statistics must be
reproducible. A classical thermodynamic point of view
is therefore in line with Bohr’s view that the conﬁgura-
tion of the whole experimental apparatus conditions the
experimental results. Furthermore, we observe discrete
events only because we choose to design and use a ther-
modynamically metastable system such as an APD that
is capable of making transitions between thermodynam-
ically distinguishable states in diﬀerent ways depending
on its surrounding environment. We choose to condition
the output signal from an APD to be a binary value, and
to record the times at which the output signal makes a
transition to its excited state, but at a more detailed level
the output signal can be modeled as a continuous current,
which is ultimately more appropriate if we adopt a ﬁeld
theoretic perspective to enable more detailed modeling
of the APD as an integral part of the whole experimen-
tal apparatus. Thermodynamic transitions of an APD
should, if ideally constructed, occur randomly, at a mini-
mal dark rate, if there is no external signal, and statistics
of dark rate APD events should exhibit as little statis-
tically signiﬁcant structure as possible, so that when we
introduce an external signal, statistics of the APD events
can be used to characterize the external signal as cleanly
as possible.

FIG. 9: Visualization of the detector and instrument setting timing statistics, for a 3ns window in 60ps sections, for longdist35
from Alice’s perspective, adjusted for relative timing drift and for local detector delays, together with the corresponding
calculation of the Bell-CHSH inequality violation. For Alice, 0, 1, 2, and 3 correspond to angles 0◦, 45◦, 90◦, and 135◦. For
Bob, 0, 1, 2, and 3 correspond to angles 22.5◦, 67.5◦, 112.5◦, and 147.5◦.
