About the Authors 
Co-authors Laurie J. Bonnici and Brian C. O’Connor are 
professors of information science, University of Alabama and 
University of North Texas, respectively. They are academic 
descendants of pioneering information philosopher, Patrick 
Wilson of U. C. Berkeley, School of Library and Information 
Studies. Their work weaves O’Connor’s visual information 
approaches with Bonnici’s language analysis to examine the 
information at the edges. They enjoy kayaking and exploring 
coffee houses while navigating wherever they may be. Toronto 
provided fertile ground for conceiving the notion of anecdata 
and proximity in information experiences.

Proximity and Clues 
1.1
Introduction 
Our interest in proximity began two decades ago when a mutual friend introduced us 
because of our common passion for kayaking. As we chatted about types of kayaks and 
paddles, our conversation drifted to our work. We each began to think about some of the 
other’s comments: “I’ve heard this before.” The simple question “Who was your major 
professor?” yielded our ﬁrst discussion of proximity. Brian had studied under Patrick 
Wilson, Laurie had studied under Elfreda Chatman, who had studied under Wilson at the 
same time Brian had—we had a close intellectual relationship, a proximity that had been 
unknown until that moment. 
Over the years, physical proximity has been irregular and less than frequent, yet we 
have engaged in various projects and critiqued each other’s work based on our conceptual 
proximity, aided by the tele-proximity of email, telephone, Skype, and Zoom. Recently, 
we had the opportunity to spend some time together to work out a presentation for the 
Document Academy (DOCAM) on professors as dynamic documents. Our close but dif-
fering ties to Wilson surfaced in our discussions, largely in terms of the continuity of 
that dynamic quality through students and students of students—the roles of memory and 
critical consideration through generations. Kayaks also came into play. Kayaks have little 
or nothing to do with Patrick Wilson, but our passion for kayaking was the thread that 
brought us together. Would we have met and had a conversation that brought up the same 
point? It is possible, but not necessarily the likely case. This led to our thinking about 
the role of unexpected, unknown, unpredicted threads of proximity—the kayaks might 
be seen as simple catalysts in retrospect, yet they were a strong incentive to have the 
ﬁrst meeting and provided an affordance for both conversations and metaphors for our 
thinking and doing. Such unexpected connections are worth examining as components of 
information seeking and retrospective analysis.

Proximity and Clues
We set out to sketch a constellation of proximities, present examples of attempts to 
accomplish proximity, and provoke a discussion of the role of proximity in our ﬁeld. 
We suggest that proximity is a thread between retrieval constructs based on known top-
ics and predictable relations and the sorts of information seeking that lie outside those 
constructs—browsing, stumbling, encountering, detective work, art making, translation, 
understanding documents in hand. 
We see our work here more as a set of provocations than as a single, complete model— 
a meandering which “[may seem] to be a slower process than the straight line of progress, 
[but is only so] for the simply deﬁned objective, for the short view of time; for mean-
dering proceeds by covering more ground, percolating into deeper depths, listening to the 
murmurs of more voices, being what it is when and where it is observed.” (Klaver, 2018) 
We cover quite a bit of ground, paddle some lakes and rivers, and invite the murmurs of 
more voices. 
1.2
Once Upon a Time 
Our story of Proximity begins with an ancient Greek legend. Theseus had a problem and 
he had no clue how to solve it. 
For some time, the people of Athens had been compelled to send young men and 
women to Knossos to be sacriﬁced to the Minotaur—a half human, half bull creature 
born to the wife of King Minos as punishment for Minos insulting the god Poseidon. 
Theseus, being of the right age, promised his father King Aegeus he would slay the 
creature and free his people of this horrible burden. 
Killing the Minotaur would not be easy; yet, as an accomplished warrior, Theseus was 
conﬁdent he could slay the creature, as shown in Fig. 1.1 (Diosphos, 500 BCE). The 
real problem was what to do after the killing. The Minotaur was enclosed in a labyrinth, 
as visualized in Fig. 1.2 (van de Passe, 1602) designed by the legendary designer and 
maker, Daedalus, to be inescapable—keeping the dangerous creature and his sacriﬁcial 
meals trapped together and away from the citizenry of Knossos. Escaping the inescapable 
labyrinth was the real problem for which Theseus had no clue.
Enter Ariadne, daughter of King Minos. As often happens in such tales, Ariadne fell 
in love with Theseus, so she was invested in his problem of escaping the labyrinth. She 
went to Daedalus and asked for help. He suggested thread, so Theseus would have a 
physical connection to the outside—maintaining proximity to Ariadne. At the appointed 
hour Theseus prepared his sword and Ariadne gave him a ball of thread—literally a “clew 
or clue,” a skein of yarn or thread. Theseus entered the maze letting out the line from 
his clew, slew the creature, and wound/found his way back out through the otherwise 
inescapable labyrinth. Ariadne knew Daedalus and Theseus knew Ariadne; the chain of 
proximity yielded a clue for a useful solution to a vexing problem.

Proximity and Clues
We cannot always count on Ariadne going to Daedalus to help us solve problems, 
but humans do hunt and gather useful clues in numerous ways. It is our aim to set out 
examples of proximity and clues in order to suggest an inclusive model of information 
seeking and use. We hope, also, to provoke a broader conversation. 
1.3
Clues, Proximity, and Functionality 
It is useful to turn to the etymology of “clue” (a variant of the earlier “clew”). The Oxford 
English Dictionary (Weiner & Simpson, 2004) tells us that a clue is: “A ball of thread, 
which in various mythological or legendary narratives (esp. that of Theseus in the Cretan 
Labyrinth) is mentioned as the means of ‘threading’ a way through a labyrinth or maze; 
hence, in many more or less ﬁgurative applications: that which guides through a maze, 
perplexity, difﬁculty, intricate investigation, etc.” 
The OED gives as it earliest example of this meaning of “clue” as Chaucer’s Legend 
Good Women Ariadne from 1385: By a clewe of twyn as he hath gon The same weye he 
may returne a-non ffolwynge alwey the thred as he hath come. 
The OED also alerts us that, while physical closeness is the usual meaning of “proxim-
ity,” more abstract senses can also be implied: (1) The fact or condition of being near or 
close in abstract relations, as kinship, time, nature, etc.; closeness; (2) The fact, condition, 
or position of being near or close by in space; nearness. Now the dominant sense. 
The tale of Theseus and Ariadne presents us with different facets of proximity. The-
seus has to sail from Athens to Knossos just to be proximate with the Minotaur. Ariadne 
becomes close to Theseus and wanting to maintain physical and emotional proximity to 
him decides to help solve the problem of exiting the labyrinth. Neither Ariadne nor The-
seus has any idea of how to escape the labyrinth; however, Ariadne is close to Daedalus, 
designer of the labyrinth. It is Daedalus who comes up with the idea of using thread to 
establish a connection to the exit—a clue, a route marker for maintaining proximity to 
the exit. Had Theseus not met Ariadne and had she not known someone who might have 
an idea, the Minotaur would no longer have been a threat to Athens, but Theseus would 
not have returned home. 
We assume documents are a means of proximity to what was in the minds (broadly 
speaking) of their authors. However, ﬁnding and understanding documents is another layer 
of proximity between the coding practices of authors and the decoding abilities users. In 
general, documents are not sought simply for their physical presence; rather they are 
sought for what they enable us to do, for the states into which they might enable us to 
put our neural pathways, whether to solve a unique problem, engage in a lovely memory, 
remember what to buy at the grocery, ﬁnd reviews of blood pressure cuffs, or … 
Grocery lists, vacation photos, dissertations, journal articles are attempts to put the 
reader/viewer/user into proximity with the author. Grocery lists and vacation photos may 
be seen by nobody other than the author, yet even in this case the author is put back in time

and, perhaps place—standing before the empty shelf in the pantry two hours earlier, or 
back at a fjord in Norway in 1973. Damasio asserts that remembering something is putting 
neural pathways into the same state they were when the target of remembering originally 
happened. (Damasio) The documents act as clues, codes to help neural pathways become 
proximate to some earlier state. In a conversation, Brian asked Damasio if a novelist or 
ﬁlm director could be said to be putting readers and viewers into neural states they had 
never actually experienced; Damasio replied that he would not argue against that idea. 
(MIT Image & Meaning Symposium, 2005. Personal communication.) 
We assume meaning is (largely) function. Authors generate documents in order to share 
some functionality—perhaps only with themselves and those close to them or with some 
wider group; seekers want some functionality. The documents (messages) generated and 
sought are of all sorts—formally coded books, sculptures, movies, symphonies, videos 
of the cat, having beer and pizza with a professor while working out a dissertation idea, 
photographs of knots for holding ribs in a kayak, reading Ginsberg’s HOWL, hearing 
Ginsberg perform HOWL. 
We use the term epidata as a general term for clues to ﬁnding and understanding 
useful information. We should note that epidata includes dynamic and mutable constructs. 
Theseus was the ﬁrst to think of entering a labyrinth, killing a menacing creature, then 
exiting the labyrinth. There was no context, no established knowledge on how to proceed. 
Thread as a means of escaping a labyrinth could not have been found in Theseus’s local 
library; yet, now that we know the solution worked, we can move it into a standard index 
term. 
Wilson speaks of moving away from the topical or disciplinary organization and 
description of documents and instituting a “reorientation toward the functional.” (Wil-
son, 1977). Then he notes such an approach “explicitly recognizes the primacy of the 
need to bring knowledge to the point of use.” Now, there is a problem of a sort here. 
Much of what has been done in the past has been a matter of labeling—labeling what 
the primary subject of a document is and labeling what the primary subject of a question 
is. This makes it possible to match a user’s question to a document—essentially resulting 
in an efﬁcient warehousing system. However, this assumes that someone seeking infor-
mation actually knows just how to state what it is that is troubling, missing, vexing, or 
needed. It also assumes that someone knows how to translate whatever is in a retrieved 
document to their problem. It also assumes there is a document available. It also assumes 
that the document and the seeker employ a common language in a mutually expressed 
and understood way. Wilson (his works are just full of insights stated in wonderful prose) 
notes that if one “made knowledge available for use by making documents available for 
use, the librarian’s role would be clear-cut, [b]ut the availability of knowledge is not like 
the availability of an object – a book, a hammer, or a loaf of bread.”

Epidata 
The difference between seeing and understanding lies in knowing the context, and it should 
be emphasized that we approached this problem area from a particular perspective: helping 
readers to understand.

Our story of proximity turns to a food court in Toronto. For some time, we had been 
thinking about professors (among others) as dynamic documents, digesting new informa-
tion, critiques, and insights and updating their concepts. Having ideas rolling around in 
their head that they are yet processing. Those thoughts and critiques can be delivered to 
colleagues and students as soon as they are formulated and within the context at hand. 
For students looking a little bafﬂed a simple example and some extra background material 
can be provided for clariﬁcation of understanding. As for colleagues in the ﬁeld, much 
may be bypassed to get to further discussion of the new ideas (Fig. 1.3). 
We had been considering the concept of “professor as document” for some time largely 
attempting to model increasing constraints on the professoriate from many sides. While 
chatting and scribbling notes in a food court we turned our thoughts to Patrick Wilson as a 
professor of note to whom we each had strong but quite different connections—proximity. 
We reasoned it could help readers of Wilson’s philosophical works to know of his hardy 
laugh by making him appear more human and thus approachable. In the ﬁrst two pages

proximity and anecdata

of his oral history (Wilson & McCreery, 2000) the note “[laughter]” appears three times; 
Howard White noted from his doctoral student days: 
Wilson was a good lecturer—earnest but also playful in a style … with a crooked smile and 
the slightly odd habit of sometimes grasping his ankle and resting his knee on the front table, 
which gave him a crane-like stance. (White, 2000) 
It might be useful in some way for them to know that his passion and rigor was so 
deep that even after he had retired, he had a dream that he might have made an errant 
perception about positivism, and that he then went back through his writings to be sure 
his arguments still held. Brian then recalled an incident involving Wilson’s ﬁrst book. 
In 1997, Brian had assigned Wilson’s Two Kinds of Power to a group of master’s degree 
students in his course. The text was just as it had been when set in print thirty years earlier; 
no new versions, update, or changes had been made. Most of the students declared they 
would not read the book because Wilson was “too sexist”—he did not use gender-neutral 
pronouns and he used masculine phrases such as “How is a man to know…?” The writing 
style followed the norms of publishing for the time Wilson published the work—1968. 
Changes in cultural attitudes on gender over the ensuing thirty years combined with more 
static norms of publishing resulted in a breakdown in the functionality of Wilson’s text to 
connect with the students. This was an example of how small differences in circumstances 
might go unnoticed, yet cause signiﬁcant problems distancing a possible user and a source 
of potentially useful information. Common ground was not so substantial as it seemed— 
there was a lack of temporal proximity. When Wilson wrote the book there was no style 
manual that enforced gender-neutral pronouns. Brian posited to the students that if anyone 
would have argued for gender neutral use in publishing, Wilson would likely have been 
among them (from personal conversations with him). Even if he had used them, the 
publisher would have “edited” them away. Sharing these perspectives on Wilson with 
the students opened a pathway of proximity that shifted students’ perspective. This shift 
led to their reading the work with (self-reported) enthusiasm. Here we see that Brian 
provided information around the book (epidata) that led to a connection with the original 
and unchanged information (book). 
Laurie noted that such anecdotes might be helpful in translating across all manner of 
disruptions of functionality caused by lack of proximity to an information source. The 
very word “anecdote” prompted our original and early construct anecdata. We originally 
constructed “anecdata” to resonate with metadata, yet be signiﬁcantly different. The term 
“anecdote” comes from roots meaning “unpublished”—this does not mean it is not evi-
dentiary or of little use, only that anecdata is not ‘publicly” available in any ordinary 
sense. The Oxford English Dictionary notes: 
anecdote (n.)1670s, “secret or private stories,” from French anecdote (17c.) or directly from 
Medieval Latin anecdota, from Greek anekdota “things unpublished,” neuter plural of anek-
dotos, from an- “not” + ekdotos “published”

8

Proximity and Clues
Procopius’ 6c. Anecdota, unpublished memoirs of Emperor Justinian full of court gossip, 
gave the word a sense of “revelation of secrets,” which decayed in English to “brief, amusing 
story” (1761). 
As the construct of anecdata evolved, we noted a lack of depth in its fully expressing 
connection with information. Thus, we have coined the term epidata to reﬂect our idea of 
information that surrounds information; a term borrowed and adjusted from epigenetics.
• Epigenetics—the study of changes in organisms caused by modiﬁcation of gene 
expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself.
• Epidata—the changes in content around or accompanying information that modiﬁes 
meaning or understanding rather than alteration of the information itself. 
In our musings about professors as documents, we might consider epidata as a form of 
continuous development of faculty as document (connective synchronicity), even in the 
posthumous state. Little known knowledge about the distant and departed can continue to 
open doors for the diachronic documents left behind. Proximity to an author may enhance 
understanding of that author’s works, yet not all readers are close to an author. We propose 
epidata as a means of achieving virtual proximity. 
Proximity comes from Latin roots meaning “in the vicinity”—for us it is an under-
standing of an author afforded through closeness ties—closer proximity yields higher 
probability of informative epidata. For example, a doctoral student has proximity to a 
major professor; a student of that student would have virtual proximity, depending on 
what was remembered and passed on; those who read something such as White’s words 
on Wilson might have a third- generation virtual proximity; whereas a student with only 
the book would have only a reading familiarity (weak tie) and would lack the embellishing 
perspective epidata that enriches content. 
1.5
Diachronicity and Synchronicity—Epidata (Connective 
Synchronicity) 
Documents are characterized by both static and dynamic attributes allowing for their 
function and relevance, and even their potential reduction of use over time. O’Connor 
provides a concise overview of this phenomenon. Through notions of diachronicity and 
synchronicity he explains how documents retain and lose value as useful information 
(O’Connor et al., 2008, p. 41). In his presentation, synchronicity is characterized by soci-
etal and cultural changes in meaning over time. He posits that such changes, depending on 
context, allow for growth of use or death of information. Recognizing the diachronic char-
acteristics of documents, here we build on the notion of synchronicity as we conceptualize 
epidata.

1.5
Diachronicity and Synchronicity—Epidata …

We can say that a document (main source of information) is a message together with all 
the relations surrounding that message (epidata): a set of words, pictures, sounds together 
with what physical and social constraints urged the author to choose and position certain 
signs in just such a way and what caused (enabled, constrained) any recipient to ﬁnd the 
message useful. Barring decay of media, messages remain stable across time, while the 
mix of antecedents to making a message and the complementary mix of antecedents to 
understanding coding and decoding) are situational. 
In the 1960s people destroyed rock and roll records, now the same messages can be 
heard as background music at the supermarket. Musician’s lives evolved including one of 
the Beatles was bestowed with a knighthood and Brian May (Queen) earned a doctorate in 
astrophysics. The message (music) persisted through time (diachronic) while some of the 
attributes of the artists changed (synchronic); thus, we might say, the document changed. 
The ties between the state of affairs at play when the message was made and those at 
play for any particular author/recipient can be termed epidata. 
It is easy enough to recognize a decoding problem when there is a signiﬁcant difference 
between the message maker and a recipient. μÁνιν ¥ειδε θε`α ∏ηλη¨ι´αδεω ’AχιλÁoς 
oÙλoμšνην is recognizably in a different coding system from that of the rest of this text. 
A photo may make little sense without context. Where epidata become useful are in those 
circumstances where coding/decoding differences are seemingly slight yet stand in the 
way of discovery and understanding. 
The Four Tops express quite clearly the diachronic/synchronic dance with their lyrics: 
You’re sweet as a honey bee 
But like a honey bee stings 
You’ve gone and left my heart in pain 
All you left is our favorite song 
The one we danced to all night long 
It used to bring sweet memories 
Of a tender love that used to be 
Now it’s the same old song 
But with a different meaning 
Since you been gone 
It’s the same old song 
But with a different meaning 
Since you been gone 
I, oh I (Holland et al., 1965)

Proximity and Clues
We propose proximity and epidata to account for ways of ﬁnding and understanding 
functional information, ways that stand outside yet in concert with the norms of data 
and metadata. Epidata afford pathways, point to details that cast light on proximities 
that might otherwise go unknown. Epidata are those relationships not readily available 
or known from a document or the metadata around it. Epidata may be in the memory 
of a friend of an author, in knowledge of the culture within which a document was con-
structed; they may be immediately available upon looking in the right place or they may 
require signiﬁcant detective work for discovery. Epidata bring one closer to the author 
of a message, thereby aiding discovery, interpretation, and understanding of useful docu-
ments. Epidata make up the clue, the ball of thread that affords proximity while leaving 
the original information, in its original presentation, unchanged. 
Data, metadata, and epidata are all anchor points for clues—the threads between where 
one is and where one wants to be—between oneself and that to which one wants to be 
proximate. Some of those anchor points are at (for our purposes) the document end and 
some of those anchor points are at the seeker’s end. It would have done little good for 
Ariadne to stand at the entrance to the Labyrinth and throw the clue randomly into a 
passageway—it had to be attached to Theseus for him to be able to again get close to 
Ariadne. We might say in general that data rest largely at the document side, metadata act 
as general descriptions of typical pathways between documents and seekers, and epidata 
rest at the seeker side. 
1.6
Epidata: Clues to Proximity 
There are many ways to ﬁnd information about things we know we need to know. Yet, 
ﬁnding the most suitable information is not so simple a task. What of those times when 
something “isn’t quite right,”; what about times when what we have found does not 
make sense, even though it “should;” consider those times when we are not looking for 
information at all, but something “catches our eye?” 
A document (or document event) is co-constituted by a message maker & a message 
recipient—both impacted by antecedents—cultural and personal constraints. Looking at 
the clues that can bring users of documents into a closer relation with the authors of the 
documents is the form of proximity we are examining. When somebody visits a place, 
builds something, or solves a problem, we say they have ﬁrst-hand knowledge of that 
experience; when that person shows photographs, draws up plans, or prints an equation, 
we say that they have created a document to provide second-hand knowledge of the event. 
The closer the author and user are in terms of language, assumptions, life experiences, 
the more likely it is that the user will more fully understand the document. So we can 
say that author/user proximity is a way of understanding second-hand knowledge as if it 
were ﬁrst-hand knowledge.

Imagine being able to walk about the agora with Plato and observe the questioning 
style. Imagine observing the whirlwind ﬁve-day writing spree on the ﬁlm version of Gone 
with the Wind. Imagine understanding why people in nineteenth century photos seldom 
smile; understanding why Weston’s Pepper #30 is so astonishing; understanding why a 
two-line poem by Catullus was once shocking (and why Carl Orff’s version is so very 
unlike that of Catullus). Consider the “what if” questions and responses while having 
coffee with Zenodotus and Tim Berners Lee? Getting the subtle details around, but not 
central to, the information may be the catalyst to an aha moment information encounter. 
What of those times when we just wonder what someone from our hometown would 
think of this or that? What if we see that a current best-selling book on a topic for which 
we have little interest was authored by a college classmate—we might pick it up. What 
if we are a ﬁlmmaker between projects and happen to see a position open for a ﬁlm 
archivist, see ﬁne print “requires MLS,” and we enroll in graduate school? What if we are 
a scholar looking for inspiration? We might put ourselves in the library stacks looking at 
documents with which we are not familiar, in hopes of stumbling upon something useful? 
What if we want people to know the music of some of the blues greats, but we know we 
are not so talented as they are? We might play the music on loud electric instruments, 
speed the music up, call ourselves the Rolling Stones, and have our idols thank us for 
our efforts. All of these hint at the uses of proximity and the necessity for knowing the 
seemingly little hooks that make ﬁnding and understanding of information possible. 
When Patrick Wilson called for “…a reorientation toward the functional” and “the need 
to bring information to the point of use” the information world was on the cusp of the 
Internet age (Wilson, 1977). At that time, computers were used for some limited informa-
tion organization tasks. For the most part, documents largely remained paper-based. The 
joy of instantaneous access to a veritable sea of digital information made available through 
a search engine unwittingly circumnavigated human intermediaries; individuals holding 
potential to bridge author and reader that have the potential of opening the possibilities 
for new ways of discovering connections with useful information. 
Creative and scholarly works are a part of the author, their personal experiences poten-
tially emboldening content. The static nature of documents presented as books, journals, 
and even websites, eludes the dynamic representation embodied in the author. Anecdo-
tal fodder offers small differences in common ground between reader and the document 
opening a window of potential interest. The subtle connection holds potential to bring 
what may have been unnoticed information to the point of use.

helpful but are not now routinely gathered in some sense? Epidata are the data around or 
accompanying information that modiﬁes meaning or understanding rather than alteration 
of the information itself. What are the sorts of characteristics of the relationship between

beforehand, but for which one might train/advise a seeker to consider in any particular 
instance?

More Than Meets the Eye 
2.1
Toward an Ontology of Proximity1 
All of photography can be summarized as photons in, photons out. (O’Connor, 2009) 
The very things which an artist would leave out, or render imperfectly, the photograph 
takes inﬁnite care with, and so makes its illusions perfect. What is the picture of a drum 
without the marks on its head where the beating of the sticks has darkened the parchment? 
(Holmes, 1859) 
Vision gives us proximity at a distance. Human vision is a matter of photons exciting 
receptors; so, in a general sense, photographs require little in the way of decoding. The 
photon data of any photograph maps the surface of what was in front of the camera with 
exquisite empiricism, much as does the human eye at any point in time (Fig. 2.1). This 
data shows us a great deal about those objects—color, texture, size, orientation—that 
enables interaction with our world. There is a difference, though, between the camera and 
the brain—the brain generally has a conceptual construct within which to make use of the 
eye’s image. When we see the world around us, we generally do so across time—glancing 
at the thermometer, looking for the car keys, focusing on entering the road, shifting our 
gaze about the environment. Each scene is set within a larger context. Churchland refers 
to this as seeing “spatiotemporal particulars [within a] landscape or conﬁguration of the 
abstract universals, the temporal invariants, and the enduring symmetries that structure 
the objective universe of [the brain’s] experience.” (Churchland, 2012) Any individual 
photograph presents an exquisite data set of “spatiotemporal particulars,” but is, in and

of itself largely bereft of universal particulars of either the maker or the seeker or the 
viewer. Any individual photograph has speciﬁc photon data, but any particular viewer 
may not have adequate contextual constructs to be able to make use (make sense) of the 
photograph. The photon data puts our eyes in proximity to the original scene.(Bonnici 
and O’Connor, 2019) 
Photographs yield data based on physical proximity, but do not necessarily yield func-
tionality for viewers with little or no contextual data. We use the term epidata for those 
synchronic attributes, those characteristics of a message that are subject to change with 
time and circumstance, and which are not readily available or easily knowable. 
Probably many of us have engaged, unwittingly, in applying spatiotemporal particulars 
to abstract universals that translate to familiarities based on our brain’s experiences. Have 
you ever gazed toward the sky on a partially cloudy day to see something familiar in the 
shapes of the clouds? We conjure up concrete items from abstract formations of water 
particulates rendered as clouds to the human eye (Fig. 2.2). 
What do you see in this image? What do you make of this image? This is a snapshot 
of the sky rotated 90 degrees to the left. It was captured just a couple of hours after 
euthanizing a beloved pet. While walking a remaining pet, the dog kept looking up at the

sky. Following the pet’s gaze, Laurie’s eyes saw a heart-shaped cloud. Upon closer look, 
that same cloud looked a lot like her remaining dog walking as if leading her toward 
the sky. Was it the raw emotion of recently saying a ﬁnal goodbye to a beloved pet of 
sixteen years that allowed the brain to interpret the cloud as something familiar; something 
endearing? 
Without the epidata, what would you have seen in this image? 
2.2
How Do Photographs Mean? 
Words cannot describe photographs in the same sense that key words or subject headings 
can describe verbal documents because words are not native elements of photographs. It 
is quite likely that someone could say there is a lot of “red” in the photograph below; 
yet, there is no place in the image where the word “red” occurs. It is the case that there 
are many pixels with values (0n a scale of 0–255) close to Red 197, Green 19, Blue 36 
that activate the human visual system in a way that is often labeled “red,” but there are 
no letters “r,” “e,” “d.” Words can describe epidata—reactions and associations that might 
be functional. 
In 2004 we hung a 30-foot-long photomural in a gallery coffee shop, as pictured in 
Fig. 2.3. We then asked/allowed people to write on the print over a one-month period. We 
thought the physical presence of the collection as a whole together with social interac-
tion might provide clues to what is needed/wanted for functionality of photographs. For 
DOCAM ‘19 we wanted to compare reactions to some of the same individual images in 
a mural format. In both cases we were interested in verbalization of reactions to pho-
tographs. Since words are not native elements of photographs but we often use words 
to describe our reactions to photographs, we looked to written comments as clues to 
reactions—threads connecting photon data to utility.
Beyond being able to see the photon data for a woman or a dog or a boat, how do 
we think about photographs? How do we look for an image that reminds us of summer 
time in Kansas, or makes us think of desolation or love? Might it help to know what the 
photographer was thinking? Would it help to know how others reacted? Does the size of 
a photo presentation matter? Does moving along a mural inspire a form of narrativity? 
We were curious to see if the necessity of moving (at least the eyes) along a set of images 
not intended to be a coherent narrative would still provoke some form of narrativity in 
the broadest sense. Would the bright red in both upper corners be noticed and commented 
on? Would the large number of hands get a mention? Would anyone ask why there are 
feet in the two bottom corners? 
We had numerous comments written by a variety of viewers of the 2004 photomural 
and we wanted to see if we could ﬁnd any commonalities between those and any com-
ments from another photomural. The display space for the second piece precluded simply

More Than Meets the Eye
Fig. 2.3 30-foot photomural with margins for viewer comments
hanging a new copy of the ﬁrst mural. We selected a small subset of the original image 
set based largely upon the sorts of comments attached to them. 
This in itself was intriguing; the process of mulling over the differences in the two 
installations was fruitful; and the process of preparing the reprise was at once delightful, 
thought provoking, maddening, and extraordinary. Engaging with the images again—both 
those from the ﬁrst piece and the combination of new and re-used pieces in the second 
piece—was exhilarating and challenging. There is a good deal of personal history bound 
up in the individual images and in the making and showing of the ﬁrst mural. 
We prepared the mural for DOCAM ‘19 to use as a data gathering mechanism for our 
continuing work on proximity and epidata. Things did not go as planned. Unavoidable 
delays in hanging the piece and the venue (not the relaxed environment of a coffee shop,) 
seem to have dissuaded conferees from engaging with the mural with pens in hand. This 
was a disappointment. However, we soon realized that our planning of the new mural in 
and of itself provided a rich set of data and thoughts for sketching out an approach to 
photographs, epidata, and proximity. 
2.3
Coding, Decoding, ‘Spatiotemporal Particulars,’ 
and ‘Landscape[s] of Abstract Universals’ 
Understanding can be taken as the ability to do something with or because of a message— 
a means of bringing information to the point of use. We start with Shannon’s cleaving 
of meaning from message. Some form of data is coded in some medium, transmitted, 
received, and decoded. Some forms of coding and circumstances of message making and

2.3
Coding, Decoding, ‘Spatiotemporal Particulars,’ …
17
decoding require little proximity of the recipient to the message maker, while some forms 
utterly depend on proximity. 
Photon data from photographs presents to the eye/brain surfaces proximate to the cam-
era at the time of coding the photograph; however, it does not necessarily present data on 
time, place, what was outside the frame, why the particular surfaces were selected, why 
a particular data recording technique was employed. In some circumstances, this may be 
an acceptable state of affairs. It may be possible that the simple surface data is all that is 
required by a particular user for a particular use. In other circumstances, data beyond the 
surface data may be utterly necessary. Epidata affords pathways, points to details that cast 
light on proximities that might otherwise go unknown. As we see in the tale of Theseus 
slaying the Minotaur, yet depending on Ariadne for his own escape from the labyrinth, 
even the most slender of threads can hold or bespeak signiﬁcant proximity. 
The proximity need not be to the original maker of the photographic message or even 
to the object recorded. It may even be that the original photographer will have a different 
decoding of the photographic message at some subsequent viewing time. An example of 
this is a photograph Brian’s mother made in 1948. When Brian was about a year and a 
half old his mom made the picture in Fig. 2.4 of him with his dad on the steps of the 
art museum in Manchester, New Hampshire. A couple of years before his dad died, he 
went to sit on the steps just to think about the past. It occurred to him that he should 
make a self-portrait there by balancing his camera on a nearby ﬁre hydrant employing the 
timer on the shutter release. When he showed his mom the new picture, she wondered 
if he could combine it with hers as a “way to think about the two times together, as if 
you were together 60 years apart.” Figure 2.5 is the counterfactual image suggested by 
his mother. She was essentially proposing a form of temporospatial proximity. It was as 
if she were creating a memory that she knew would be important because of where she 
was in her own life.

Some Examples of Epidata and Thoughts on Possible Utility 
The image in Fig. 2.6 appears in the lower left portion of our DOCAM 2019 mural. On 
one level it is simply a photograph of somebody holding up blue reading glasses to a toy 
animal’s eyes. It might be useful at this level of decoding as a PowerPoint illustration for 
“Pay close attention” or “Read your hunting regulations carefully.” Those familiar with 
DOCAM would likely recognize this as the antelope mascot of the group; while yet others 
would know from having attended DOCAM ‘17 in Indiana, that this is Laurie Bonnici 
holding up her glasses to the antelope and the photo was made by Brian O’Connor. 
Knowing these details would give some context to the image of a smartphone making an 
image of Michael Buckland, just to the right of the “FASH” photo in the center. Even 
that sentence demonstrates the issues we are exploring because one would have to know 
that Michael Buckland was in attendance at the Indiana gathering.
The “FASH” photo in Fig. 2.7 had appeared in the 2004 mural and was the object of 
some speculation in written and verbal comments. In the earlier mural the image was not 
quite so large and was not centered in the mural. The image is shown without cropping, 
that is, the original did not present any additional surface data. Many viewers interpret the 
straight-edged angle on top of the head to be a paper pirate hat or other such whimsical 
head gear. “FASH” seemed perplexing to most who commented. The subject was actually 
a much larger than life-size image of a model, cut out and pasted to a construction wall, 
with weather and time having caused delamination around the edges—thus the pirate hat 
look. FASH is simply the ﬁrst part of FASHION COMPLEX. The image was made in 
Las Vegas in 2003, when digital cameras were beginning to overtake ﬁlm cameras. Brian 
was attending a photo convention and was taken by the NIKON ads on the tops of taxis 
“You have to love a town where image is everything!” The delaminating image seemed a 
cute counterpoint to the ad. Having the freedom to shoot lots of images without worrying 
about processing costs for ﬁlm was part of the plan for taking the walk on which the

2.4

Fig. 2.6 Toy antelope and 
blue reading glasses
photo was shot. In retrospect, this entire paragraph is some metadata “…larger than life-
size image of a model, cut out and posted to a construction wall…” with lots of epidata 
(nearly the remainder of the content). 
At ﬁrst glance the image in Fig. 2.8 might seem to be a simple, formalist photograph 
of a long hallway. As such it might be useful for representing the corridor of time, a 
long-term undertaking, a sad farewell, or just a pattern of straight lines broken up by a 
bit of human activity. For those who had their own physical proximity to the toy antelope 
above—folks who attended DOCAM’17 in Bloomington, Indiana, this might look famil-
iar as the on-campus hotel, though not many folks keep track of hotel hallway design 
and décor. In the sense of presenting these images in the mural format, we wondered if 
there would have been a “narrative” connection made between this hallway photo and 
the antelope photo—would comments on the one informed understanding of the other.

More Than Meets the Eye
Would anyone have “mistakenly” assumed the interior image of the hallway and the exte-
rior image in Fig. 2.9 of a city hall in New Hampshire were the same building because of 
their proximity in the mural? Likewise, would there have been any explicit connections 
made between hotel and city hall photos because they each have tiny human ﬁgures within 
largely architectural scenes? For that matter, would anyone comment—as did someone 
who happened to be near the city hall when the photo was made: “Looks like King Kong 
got the wrong building!” The distribution of similar colors and the converging parallel 
lines might set up a resonant pair for decorating a space. The exterior image is the city 
hall in Manchester, New Hampshire. Does that mean something? 
This image in Fig. 2.10 has had many comments in other venues; one informal inter-
action at DOCAM ‘19 was similar to most of the other comments. On the surface, this 
is a white dog with pretty ﬂowers, plant material, and assorted other objects. Terms such 
as pretty, beautiful, natural have been quite prevalent. When it is revealed that the dog 
has just been euthanized, most commenters have replied: “I am so sorry” or “How sad.” 
Brian had the privilege of living with the dog for many years, so it is at once lovely and 
sad for him. The dog often watched over the yard where he builds kayaks, so there are 
pieces from one of the boats on her and the ﬂowers come from her favorite parts of the 
yard. The image does not show that she is already in the bottom of a grave. Would that 
make a difference to meaning for some viewers? Would the context be a catalyst to build 
proximity if the viewer had also lost a dog to euthanasia?

The grey scale image of two horses and a rider in Fig. 2.11 was in the 2004 mural, 
while the full color image was made 10 years later. They were placed together in our 
DOCAM mural to see if there would be comments on similarities. In both photos, the 
men are not competitors rather they are pickup men who remove some of the rigging from 
the bucking horse and help get the animal back to the chutes. This is a rather mundane 
part of the rodeo for many viewers, yet a task requiring skill, strength, and agility. 
The top image was used in previous work (O’Connor et al., 1999) in which we asked 
viewers to describe images and then asked cataloguers to describe the same images. 
Viewers tended to describe actions and apply adjectives—“rugged,” “strong,” “amazing 
skill”—while cataloguers tended to apply nouns—“Cowboys,” Horsemen and Horse-
women.” The postures of the riders are remarkably similar even though the one in the 
top images is working on a horse whose head is toward the camera, while the one on the 
bottom works on a horse whose tail is toward the camera. To whom would the difference

matter? Does the color add or detract for some particular use of such an image? For whom 
would it matter that one is in California and one is in Texas? 
The photograph (Hillard, 1864) in Fig.  2.12 is quite ordinary on its surface, perhaps 
even clumsy looking with the inclusion of someone’s ﬁngers. Anyone can do an online 
search for Samuel Downing and ﬁnd a “better” version of this photograph. This photo-
graph was made explicitly to represent the materiality of this particular version of the 
photo of Samuel Downing. It appears in an original edition of The Last Men of the Rev-
olution. A Photograph of Each from Life. (Hillard, 1864) published in 1864. Rev. E. R. 
Hillard interviewed the last seven living veterans of the American Revolution and made 
a photograph of each one. In 1864 there was no half-tone printing or any other method 
of rapid printing of photos in a print run of a book. Each of the photographs in all of 
the copies is handmade and glued into place. So, when you are touching the photograph 
you can feel that it is a separate piece of material; also, you are touching a print made 
by someone who chatted with veterans of the Revolution and some of the last people to 
have lived in a time before photography.

Photographic Proximity 
The comments made about the photographs from our 2019 mural presented at DOCAM 
illustrate that having a picture’s photon data strike the eye/brain of a viewer is not enough; 
exquisitely speciﬁc data without some sort of context for the data, some form of prox-
imity beyond the utterly speciﬁc photon data may lead to limited functionality of the 
photographic document. 
We suggest that a ﬁrst order taxonomy of proximity comes into play. For some uses, 
very general notions of what surfaces and what coding practices recorded a particular set 
of surface data: cute photo of reading glasses on a toy antelope; for some uses, a deeper 
level of speciﬁcity: DOCAM ‘17 in Indiana; and for other uses, even more speciﬁcity, 
of a sort that might be hard to come upon: glasses and antelope photo was made by 
the authors of this piece, the glasses had made their ﬁrst appearance at DOCAM ‘16 in 
Denton, Texas, and disappeared a little later, only to reappear a couple of years later. 
We see this play out in many photos posted to social media platforms. Albannai 
presents several examples of conversational use of photographs on Facebook (Alban-
nai, 2016) that speak both to threads of proximity and to the collaborative environment 
in which we can now discover, request, and contribute to such threads. This photograph 
in Fig. 2.13 (Mydans, 1936) from the Library of Congress (labeled “Cigar store Indian, 
Manchester, New Hampshire”) was part of a discussion thread on a Facebook page con-
cerned with the history of the city. Comments included: “My mom said this was on the 
corner of bridge and elm st,” “She is 95 … she remembers a man named Bernie who 
worked there;” “my Dad used to stop there for his newspaper, of course smokes, and 
always treat for me and my sister;” and “My mother took me there to buy cigars for my 
father for Christmas.”
We have here locative information that does not exist in the Library of Congress record, 
and we have threads of how the store ﬁt into the life of the city and how it was signiﬁcant 
to the city’s inhabitants. Perhaps most demonstrative of the notion of threads of proximity 
is this comment on the same picture: “Saw that photo on a wall in Denny’s [restaurant] 
in CA a couple years ago. Asked our young waiter if he knew where it was taken and 
why. He didn’t so we told him. He found the story interesting and promised to share it 
with the rest of the staff”—note Denny’s in CA is about 3000 miles from the corner of 
Bridge and Elm Streets, in Manchester. 
The examples we presented and the work of Albannai demonstrate three levels of gen-
erality: any image with a particular object or characteristic will do; an image with certain 
qualities and intriguing connections is wanted; the photograph must show particular qual-
ities or have a backstory that is explicit as to why this is the most useful image. Yet each 
those three regions on a spectrum of utility can function along several vectors. We might 
here expand the idea of a taxonomy of proximity into the more inclusive, environmental 
notion of an ontology of proximities—referring to types of connections, types of uses, 
and circumstances of discovering the threads.

Proximity to Crises Through Presidential Photographs2 
We look at three photographs, each made at a time of profound crisis, in order to tease out 
notions of proximity. Each image was made by a highly skilled photographer, but each 
presents the photon data from only a fraction of a second. How is a viewer to insert the 
spatiotemporal particulars of that faction of a second into their own abstract universals? 
Can words and other images from the photographers enhance the viewer’s proximity to 
the original? Can we make use of the photographers’ accounts of their proximities for 
enhancing the understanding of individual viewers?

2.6.1
Crisis—1963 
In 1963, light generated photon data from a group of people in a small space. We can see 
some of that photon data today in the photograph in Fig. 2.14. It was made in the midst 
of an extraordinary crisis in the United States. The photo was made not only for news 
value and history but also to resolve one aspect of the crisis—continuity of government 
leadership. Yet, it shows essentially nothing of the actual crises. Photon data brings a 
viewer into a form of close proximity with a portion of the original data of the scene. 
However, without metadata and without epidata (contextual information not ordinarily 
collected), the functionality of that proximity may be severely limited, obstructing access, 
use, and understanding. The photograph, in and of itself does not tell us what crisis is doc-
umented; nor does it tell us just whom we are seeing or what is happening. This becomes 
increasingly problematic as spatial and temporal distance from the event increases; thus, 
requiring means for facilitating proximity become more signiﬁcant for understanding.

Metadata, such as captions, can add functionality and enhance the likelihood of under-
standing. A caption presents words that give some context: “Cecil Stoughton’s photograph 
of Lyndon Johnson being sworn in as President of the United States aboard Air Force One 
immediately after the assassination of President Kennedy.” Some metadata may be less 
than functional in terms of the relationship of such a photograph to the crisis from which 
it emerged. The Library of Congress (LOC) Subject Headings applied by the Prints and 
Photographs division give no hint of the assassination of Kennedy being the primary 
circumstance of Johnson’s inauguration:
• Johnson, Lyndon B.–(Lyndon Baines),–1908–1973–Inaugurations
• Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy,–1929–1994–Public appearances
• Presidential inaugurations–Texas–Dallas–1960–1970
• Oaths–Texas–Dallas–1960–1970. 
The folder holding this photograph in the John F. Kennedy Library is titled in an almost 
bizarrely comical way: Trip to Texas: Swearing-in ceremony aboard Air Force One, 
Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) as President. 
The obituary for the very ﬁrst ofﬁcial White House photographer Cecil Stoughton in 
the New York Times enhances proximity to the image and its impact. Within a recounting 
of Stoughton’s life, with considerable attention to his role as the ﬁrst ofﬁcial White House 
photographer, two sentences tell the reader just why the picture was so important: 
Mr. Stoughton’s picture is the only photographic record of the Johnson administration’s 
abrupt, ofﬁcial beginning. At a precarious moment in the country’s history, it gave the pub-
lic at least a semblance of continuity: one president sworn in as the widow of another looked 
numbly on. (Fox, 2008) 
What we do not see in captions or in the Library of Congress Subject Headings (among 
others) or even in the New York Times obituary, are: the efforts of the photographer to 
be on the scene; the necessity to reassure the American public; why the image is black 
and white; the purpose behind the composition. Not knowing such contextual information 
decreases the likelihood of ﬁnding and understanding a photograph, even one so inti-
mately connected to a horriﬁc and consequential crisis. We look to the backstory on the 
production of the image to glean epidata—the not so easily known or immediately avail-
able clues to understanding. These illuminate the proximity of the photographer to the 
subject/event, thus contextualizing the visual proximity the photograph presents. Epidata 
may not be useful to all potential users, but they may well be crucial to some viewer’s 
understanding. 
We ask: What are the things that are knowable about a photograph beyond 
title/caption/photographer and metadata such as time, place, camera? How can we under-
stand photographer decisions, mechanical constraints, cultural constraints? What can be 
gained by some form of proximity to the photographer’s initial making of an image and

28
2
More Than Meets the Eye
by some form of proximity to the circumstances of the image being published? While 
these may seem primarily of interest to photographers, they may well clarify matters for 
some viewers. Why do we not see the face of the federal judge administering the oath— 
the ﬁrst female judge to do so? Because there was no angle in the small room from which 
to make an image of Johnson and Kennedy and also include the judge’s face. Knowing 
that time was of the essence and it was only possible to make 21 pictures, might explain 
to a historian why certain people are in the picture but not well lighted. Knowing that 
there was no professional audio recorder available but somebody remembered there was a 
dictating machine in the Air Force One ofﬁce explains the little square item held in front 
of the judge. A fashion historian might ﬁnd the clothing of political ﬁgures of 1963 of 
interest, and perhaps especially Jackie Kennedy’s jacket. Stoughton’s image of the jacket 
is both a comment on his skill at choreographing the subjects and a cautionary tale about 
accepting a single photograph as the record of the moment. This photograph had to reas-
sure the nation, so Stoughton had her stand with her left shoulder to the camera—the side 
farthest from the president when he was shot, the side with the least amount of blood-
stain. Lady Bird Johnson’s diary entry for that day notes the reality of the other side of 
the jacket and the skirt: 
Her hair [was] falling in her face but [she was] very composed ... I looked at her. Mrs. 
Kennedy’s dress was stained with blood. One leg was almost entirely covered with it and her 
right glove was caked, it was caked with blood – her husband’s blood. Somehow that was 
one of the most poignant sights – that immaculate woman, exquisitely dressed, and caked in 
blood. (Johnson, 2001 - as quoted in Lady Bird) 
Since the dress is held by the National Archives—uncleaned—and, by the wishes of 
family, secured from public view at least until 2103, photographs are the primary source 
of study of the outﬁt for any purpose. 
We propose mechanisms of proximity, constraints on proximity, and levels of proximity 
in the making of the photographs as a substructure for connecting a viewer’s abstract uni-
versals with those of the photographer. We assert that the functional strength of the thread 
of proximity depends on the partners at both ends of the thread—the coding practices and 
the decoding abilities. 
We should note that every president since Kennedy has had an ofﬁcial White House 
photographer. Before Kennedy, White House photographs were made by members of the 
Army Signal Corp essentially as photographic records of events such as hosting digni-
taries, signing legislation, and the like. Since Stoughton’s time the ofﬁcial photographer 
has had onsite ofﬁce and facilities, but each president has used the photographer’s talents 
differently. There is not a statement purpose of the photographer’s position or, indeed, of 
responsibilities that can be assumed to hold across all the presidential photographers. 
Some have had close relations with the president and photographed casual and inti-
mate moments, where others have essentially been record makers (Krule, 2012). The 
photographs made by the White House photographer are publicly available with certain

2.6
Proximity to Crises Through Presidential Photographs
29
constraints on classiﬁed materials, but how many photographs are made of what sorts of 
topics and under what constraints vary with the president. The photographers are proxim-
ity pieces/agents between the president and the public, but without knowing the nature of 
the photographer’s link to the president, we cannot know the nature of a viewer’s proximal 
link to presidential events. 
2.6.2
Mechanisms of Proximity 
Representation 
We propose that photographs and perhaps documents in general are mechanisms that 
resolve the past, in the sense of (re)presenting its constituent parts. We can ask about any 
document what sort of resolving power does it afford one in determining a past state? A 
photographic document recovers a vector state of the past that enables a close mapping 
of surface qualities. There exists the possibility of recovering from the initial ﬁles, the 
temporal, spatial, and spectral component(s) of some State 1 from the State 2 represented 
in the photograph. 
Cecil Stoughton was witness to a crisis and provided some degree of eyewitness pres-
ence for future viewers. Precipitating event for the crisis was the assassination of President 
Kennedy—Stoughton’s photographs show us nothing of that event. The crisis at hand was 
assurance of continuity of government—Stoughton’s photographs record the swearing in 
of the new president. We should note that when we presented at DOCAM ‘21 and asked if 
anyone was familiar with the photo, the comments mentioned Kennedy assassination; yet 
the image does not directly document that event. It documents outcomes/ensuing activities 
of the assassination. 
2.6.3
Photographic Processes at the Time of the Crisis 
In a time when nearly everybody has a camera in their cell phone that is capable of making 
color photographs and videos, it may be difﬁcult for today’s viewers to comprehend that 
in 1963 there was only one camera aboard Air Force One. Cecil Stoughton—the ofﬁcial 
White House photographer—was photographing with a Hasselblad 500C camera, similar 
to the camera in Fig. 2.15, that weighed almost four pounds and could make only twenty 
images on each roll of ﬁlm.
To provide proximal links for current viewers of this photograph, we turn to 
Stoughton’s words on the making of the photograph under emotional stress, the time 
stress of knowing engines on Air Force One were already revving to leave for Washing-
ton, DC, and having someone on a phone in Washington, DC dictate the words of the 
oath of ofﬁce.

I took the color ﬁlm out of my Hasselblad and reloaded it with black and white, [since it took] 
two hours to process color ﬁlm in those days, they don’t transmit color on the wire photos, and 
black and white’s the only way to go. 
And now I’m in the cabin where the oath’s going to be taken, and the president says, “Ce-
cil, where do you want us?” you know. Because I had to arrange to make sure that I’d get the 
necessary picture: him holding his hand up and his other hand on the Bible, and anybody that 
would be surrounding him would be important, like Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Kennedy. 
The judge read the oath, and the president repeated it. I was clicking pictures left and right, 
standing in my little leather seat and spraying around the cabin while they were doing the 
talking. Got the picture that was required: Hand up, hand on the Bible, eyes open. And Jackie 
and Mrs. Johnson on the other side. And then the president said, “Let’s get this plane back to 
Washington.” 
Well, I couldn’t go back to Washington with it, because I had to take the ﬁlm off and get 
the ﬁlm processed and put it on the wires for the wire services, because the world was waiting 
to see what was going on … So it was important that the ﬁlm get processed and released as 
quickly as possible. 
…, went to the AP photo lab downtown in the Dallas Morning Herald’s photo lab, I think 
it was. We processed the ﬁlm, and made the prints, and put it on their wire service, wire photo 
drums. I repeat this drums thing, and a lot of times it’s not knowledgeable to people who 
weren’t aware of what the drums were. But it’s a telephonic device for transmitting pictures 
through the telephone wire. 
So the picture was developed and processed, printed and transmitted, and reprinted in 
Washington. By the time Johnson was getting off the plane at Andrews Field two hours later, 
the picture was on his TV screen in the cabin of the plane, and he was watching himself being 
sworn in before he got off. (Stoughton, 2002)

Being There: Proximity to the Kennedy Family 
Preparation 
Captain Cecil Stoughton, seen in uniform in Fig. 2.16, was trained as a US Army photog-
rapher and ﬁlmmaker under some of the luminaries of the day, such as Alfred Eisenstadt, 
Margaret Bourke White, and Ronald Reagan. He had seen combat action, including pho-
tographing events at Guadalcanal. He had considerable technical expertise and the ability 
to work under pressure. Assigned to photograph the inauguration of John F. Kennedy, 
he produced images that caught the eyes of the new President and First Lady. Kennedy 
arranged for him to be assigned as the ﬁrst ofﬁcial White House photographer, with an 
ofﬁce in the White House and a dedicated telephone in his home.

More Than Meets the Eye
In his time as White House photographer, Stoughton: 
sat poised each day for the sound of a buzzer, which meant President John F. Kennedy was 
ready for his services. Over 35 months, Mr. Stoughton shot state dinners, receiving lines and 
visitors of all kinds, from foreign leaders to “50 singing Nuns,” …But when the visitors left, 
Mr. Stoughton had the chance to capture the First Family in far more personal settings – in 
their White House quarters, at their vacation homes and on their many travels. (Fox, 2008) 
2.6.5
On the day of the Assassination 
Stoughton was with the press corps in the presidential motorcade and once the sound of 
a riﬂe shot was heard, he made use of several proximities to arrive at Air Force One as 
the only photographer. 
Stoughton’s words on making his way: 
The driver of our car was a local police ofﬁcer. … He recognized somebody on the sidewalk 
there; he said, “What happened?” And he said it sounded like–looked like somebody got shot 
in the president’s car, and they must have gone to Parkland [Hospital.] 
I told the guy, well, “Let’s go. We need to get there, too.” So we took off real quickly. … 
ended up at this Parkland Hospital. Jumped out of the car and started making pictures … The 
president’s car was in a little emergency ambulance drive-in. I went on inside the hospital– 
being part of the staff, I was not precluded from going in … 
out of the comer of my eye I could see Johnson, Vice President Johnson, and Lady Bird 
and Rufus Youngblood, his Secret Service guy, walking rather rapidly towards the door that I 
had come in just a few minutes before. And this chief warrant ofﬁcer that was handing me this 
phone, I said, “Where’s he going?” And I nodded my head like that. He said, “The president’s 
going to Washington.” …and my realizing immediately that Kennedy wasn’t the president 
anymore and that Johnson was, nominally, and knowing that there was a need for a ceremony 
of some kind, either impromptu or ofﬁcial, it behooved me to be with him. So, when he said 
the president’s going to Washington, I said, “So am I.” 
I didn’t ride out in Johnson’s car, but there was another car, police car, there, staff car, so 
to speak. – got into this car with a driver and followed the Johnson party out to what turned 
out to be Air Force One. Kilduff, Malcolm Kilduff, came running up the aisle and said, to the 
effect, “Thank God you’re here, Cecil. The president’s going to take his Oath of Ofﬁce on the 
plane. You’re going to have to make the pictures and release it to the press because (a) there’s 
no room and (b) they’re not here anyway.” (Stoughton, 2002) 
Physical proximity became an issue after the prints had been sent over the wire because 
of the blood on Jacqueline Kennedy’s outﬁt. Kenny O’Donnell at the White House had 
evidently seen other images showing the blood-stained clothes; so, he sent a plane to get 
Stoughton back to Washington, DC, where Stoughton went to his darkroom and made 
prints of the images that had been released—showing that there was no blood because

2.6

33
he had posed her and framed the image to avoid the blood. In 1963, printing from the 
negative required considerable time and required the negative, the piece of ﬁlm that had 
come from the camera. To show the White House staff that his negatives showed no 
discernible blood, Stoughton had to be in Washington, DC. 
In the case of Stoughton’s photograph of Lyndon Johnson taking the oath of ofﬁce, 
there are several other photographs to expand the spatiotemporal particulars, to expand a 
viewer’s proximity to the event. A sample of the other images on Stoughton’s roll of 21 
pictures publicly available through the National Archives and Records Administration is 
shown in Fig. 2.17. 
Putting Stoughton’s published image (lower right) into proximity with a sample of 
others made seconds before and after gives a sense of his observational acumen at the time 
of making the image and in preparing it for publication. All the people in the photographs 
are in almost exactly the same positions, and the camera is nearly locked into the same 
position because of the large crowd in the small space. Yet, Stoughton was able to record
Fig. 2.17 Sample of other images on Stoughton’s roll of ﬁlm from the swearing in of Lyndon 
Johnson

faces of most participants, even those in the background. He was also able to frame 
Lyndon Johnson in the center to give him a look of authority, while still framing the 
judge and Jacqueline Kennedy prominently. 
The other two photographs give a sense of just how crowded and chaotic the situation 
was. In his comments, Stoughton mentions “spraying around the cabin”—photographing 
everyone that was on the scene; we actually see some different people in the different 
images. 
Having these is not likely to make the most prominent image more readily accessible 
in a search; however, they do present the crowded confusion during the few minutes 
surrounding the oath taking photograph, perhaps increasing the utility of the prominent 
image. It might be said that the primary image could be an accidental, inadvertent link to 
the behind-the-scenes images and to just who was in the space. 
Next, we turn our lens of proximity and epidata on a more recent event, yet one that 
documents history through the lens of a White House photographer. We see an image of 
another president in another crowded space with other people. But rather than being the 
subject of the unfolding event, the image documents the people viewing the event as it 
was unfolding. 
2.6.6
Crisis 2011 
In 2011, Obama’s White House photographer Pete Souza—who had also been a White 
House photographer for President Reagan, gathered the photon data of several people 
gathered staring in a small room, in Fig. 2.18. Souza was using a digital single lens reﬂex 
camera with a wide-angle lens—a Canon D Mark II, similar to the camera in Fig. 2.19, 
though with a different lens—that weighed about the same as Stoughton’s Hasselblad, yet 
capable of making hundreds of high-resolution full color images on a single storage card. 
Souza had been a newspaper photographer in Chicago and had covered Obama’s career 
there; he had also photographed events in Afghanistan immediately after the events of 
September 11, 2001.
As with the Stoughton photograph, in and of itself, Souza’s image does not tell us 
what crisis is represented; nor does it tell us just whom we are seeing or what is happen-
ing. Souza’s photograph, made nearly 50 years after Stoughton’s photograph of President 
Johnson, affords rich comparative analysis. In many ways it is almost the same picture. 
We do not see anything of the crisis involved. The photo was made from the same corner 
of a small room, with lots of people, the angle of the wall trim in both pix is the same, 
and Jackie Kennedy and Hillary Clinton occupy both the same space and hold the role 
of ‘punctum’—not the primary object but one that gives the emotional punch. (Johnson, 
2011) Even what is different is similar—the space containing the judge and LBJ is totally

empty in the Obama photo, simply inverting the primary subject of LBJ to negative space. 
Of course, much of this is simply due to the fact that many impromptu presidential events 
take place in small places and there are often many folks involved. Perhaps the most 
obvious difference is that Souza’s photograph is in color. 
Context provided by epidata shows signiﬁcant similarities and signiﬁcant differences 
in the circumstances of production, in the role of the photographer, and in the initial 
intention/use of the photograph. There are two primary sources for the epidata—both of 
them substantially different from Stoughton’s oral history. Souza maintains an Instagram 
account with more than 2,000,000 followers. On that account he has posted a 22-min 
video in which he gives the background of making the “Situation Room” photograph. He 
also maintains a site on Flickr.com with 6668 photographs from the Obama White House. 
Flickr has an EXIF button, as shown in Fig. 2.20, that enables display of a photograph’s 
Exchangeable Image File format data. Ordinarily, EXIF data is used to store technical 
information generated by the camera at the time of exposure, e.g.: time, GPS coordinates, 
length of exposure, camera model, lens type. EXIF data can also hold notes entered by 
the photographer. 
Souza’s EXIF note is 372 words; many of the words simply tell us who is pictured in 
the photograph, but there is a good deal of contextual information also: 
May 1, 2011 “Much has been made of this photograph that shows the President and Vice 
President and the national security team monitoring in real time the mission against Osama 
bin Laden. Some more background on the photograph: The White House Situation Room is 
actually comprised of several different conference rooms. The majority of the time, the Presi-
dent convenes meetings in the large conference room with assigned seats. But to monitor this 
mission, the group moved into the much smaller conference room. The President chose to 
sit next to Brigadier General Marshall B. “Brad” Webb, Assistant Commanding General of 
Joint Special Operations Command, who was point man for the communications taking place. 
With[sic] so few chairs, others just stood at the back of the room. I was jammed into a cor-
ner of the room with no room to move. During the mission itself, I made approximately 100

photographs, almost all from this cramped spot in the corner. There were several other meet-
ings throughout the day, and we’ve put together a composite of several photographs (see next 
photo in this set) to give people a better sense of what the day was like. [Names] Please note: 
a classiﬁed document seen in front of Sec. Clinton has been obscured.” 
At the beginning of the note, we are given more situational detail than the Library of 
Congress Subject Headings provide for the Stoughton photograph of Johnson, together 
with an acknowledgement of the public reception of the photograph. We learn the White 
House Situation Room is more than one small space and why the photograph was 
made there. Unlike Stoughton, who choreographed the Air Force One image, Souza was 
“jammed into a corner of the room.” He mentions that he made “approximately 100 pho-
tographs” of that particular meeting and made images of other meetings from which he 
and his staff “put together a composite …to give people a better sense of what the day 
was like.” 
The image in Fig. 2.21 shows a frame from a video on Souza’s Instagram account. 
We learn from that video more details about the circumstances of this particular image. 
Unlike Stoughton’s situation, Souza had advanced notice that “something historic” would 
probably be happening “Saturday or Sunday.” He was not told just what it would be, only 
that he should be available. On the two days before the weekend, Souza accompanied 
Obama to Tuscaloosa, Alabama to observe severe weather damage, Cape Canaveral for 
a rocket launch that was delayed by weather, and a college commencement where the 
President gave the address—all the while knowing “something historic” was to happen 
on the weekend, but not yet knowing what.
When the event commenced, Souza walked with Obama to the Situation Room, chat-
ting about the matter. In a preliminary meeting, he made 140 images, during the event he 
made about 100 images, then in subsequent meetings on how to break the news and whom 
to contact he made several hundred more photographs—for a day’s total of 1003. We learn 
that he only made about 100 images because his camera was quiet but not entirely silent 
and he did not want to disrupt the concentration in the room. He was shooting with a 
digital camera capable of making some hundreds of images on a single storage card, yet 
for the time he was in that room he was making photographs at the same rate to which 
Stoughton had been constrained. Again, while the moods in both situations were serious, 
the Situation Room mood required the least possible photographic interference. 
While Stoughton rushed from Air Force one to a Dallas newspaper darkroom in order 
to get his photo “on the wire” as quickly as possible, we learn from the Instagram video 
that Souza gave his ﬁles to the White House photography staff and went home some-
time after midnight. He returned early in the morning to do a “rough edit” of the 1003 
down to 50 images that best gave a sense of the event. He printed the one now known 
simply as the Situation Room photograph and noticed what seemed as if it might be clas-
siﬁed material in front of Hillary Clinton. This required conﬁrmation—it was classiﬁed; 
it required consideration of whether the picture could be released to the public with the 
classiﬁed portion digitally obscured—a possible violation of the concept of not altering

White House photographs. As we see in the EXIF data, it was released with the alter-
ation; in the Instagram video we learn that it was an extensive discussion and the only 
photograph ever released that way from the Obama White House. 
Also, in the Instagram video Souza explains that he is often asked exactly what moment 
in the raid on bin Laden is recorded in the Situation Room photograph and that he cannot 
say. He has the time stamp on the image ﬁle, but until the ofﬁcial timeline of the operation 
is declassiﬁed, he cannot link the operational time to his ﬁle’s timestamp. 
2.6.7
Spatiotemporal Particulars 
Ken Johnson wrote in 2011: “Rarely has a photo revealed so little while evoking so 
much. It shows an intent President Obama and other ofﬁcials in the White House Sit-
uation Room, but tells little about what exactly the situation is, except that they are 
watching something off to the left.” (Johnson, 2011) This leads us back to questions

2.6
Proximity to Crises Through Presidential Photographs
39
of what are we seeing? What do we need to know to know what we are seeing? What did 
the photographer mean for the intended audience to see? 
Immediately after the Kennedy assassination, the White House needed a photograph to 
assure the world that, despite the shocking death of the president, there was continuity of 
government; immediately after the bin Laden raid, President Obama called several world 
leaders and made a televised speech—there was no pressing need for a photograph of the 
Situation room to calm fears. It should probably be noted that some quarters have asked 
for a photograph of bin Laden’s body, but that is another issue. 
When Ken Johnson was writing his article about the photograph, he could assume most 
who saw the photograph would recognize Obama, but that assumption might not hold so 
strongly as time passes. As the event pictured recedes into the past, fewer viewers are 
likely to have the situational particulars to associate the pixels of the image with particular 
details of experience. Think of the days when photo prints were put into albums—a 
set of particulars themselves receding into history—how many people experienced the 
frustrations of trying to remember “Was that my 18th birthday or 19th?” or “I wish 
someone had written down who the woman on the left is.” Recently we were showing the 
Stoughton photographs to some people in their 20s, many from countries other than the 
United States; when we asked “What does this mean?” one student responded: “That is 
not in our history books.” A lovely demonstration of the need for context beyond names 
of objects in the photographs. 
We can look at the additional situational particulars provided by the photographer to 
explain more to those of us who were witness, in any sense, to an event and to provide 
proximal bridges for those who were not witnesses. For those of us who were high school 
students at the time of the Kennedy assassination, the Johnson image is likely still a 
signiﬁcant spatiotemporal particular—a direct link to the memories of that day; for those 
somewhat younger, the picture may be a “my parents told me they could remember exactly 
where they were when they heard the news” particular; for younger viewers it may be a 
link to a history lesson or trip to Dallas or even simply “some  people in a room.”  
2.6.8
Proximity, Epidata, Spatiotemporal Particulars 
We can see in the EXIF data for Souza’s “Situation Room” that the shutter was open 
for 1/100th of a second—a very short time at human scale. We can ask: Is that enough 
time? To which we might well respond: “Enough time for what?” That moment’s worth 
of photon data shows who was in the room, though it tells neither names nor titles nor 
functions. Serious concentration is evident, though the picture alone does not tell us what 
sort of event is requiring the serious attention; nor does it tell us how long the attention 
has been so rapt nor whether the previous or next moment would have shown excitement. 
One might ask why not make video and audio recordings? At the time of the Johnson 
inauguration photograph, the preparation for making a 16 mm ﬁlm with audio would

likely have taken longer than the entire time the plane sat ready to leave; it would have 
required a large camera on a tripod and bright lights—which the limited space on Air 
Force One could not accommodate. In the case of the Obama photograph, a reasonably 
high-quality video could have been made with essentially the same equipment as made 
the still photographs, but narration of the event and accompanying discussion of strategies 
would likely have to be classiﬁed, possibly rendering the video unsuitable for release to 
the public. 
Another issue arises out of the technology—in the Stoughton photograph the viewer 
has no color data. For the original purposes of the photograph this is of little consequence; 
however, even at the time, Jackie Kennedy’s fashion was a matter of public interest. 
Especially after her suit was covered in her husband’s blood, the color became a matter 
of intense interest and even some controversy over whether or not any blood shows in 
Stoughton’s photograph. 
We tried an experiment and ran Stoughton’s photograph through three online colorizing 
engines—each used artiﬁcial intelligence and none required more than 10 s to produce 
results. As can be seen in a glance at Fig. 2.22, results varied in quality of coloring within 
the lines—recognizing the boundaries of discreet objects—but they all looked like color 
photographs. However, not one rendered Jackie’s coat as raspberry pink. 
We do have a Cecil Stoughton color photograph of the raspberry ensemble at the time 
of arrival in Dallas, shown in Fig. 2.23. We could look at lack of color data and at the lack 
of the motion and audio components of events as technological distance or weakening of 
the possible proximal ties between a record and an event. Other photographs, personal 
accounts, and even simple understanding of the recording processes can alert us to what 
is lacking—sometimes ﬁlling in what is missing, sometimes only acting as a caution to 
interpretation.
Even these simple colorized images raise a growing concern in trusting photographs 
to present photon data of a signiﬁcant event—deep fake proximity. Deleting people and 
objects from photographs or adding them in has been practiced since the mid-nineteenth 
century. Analog techniques could be convincing to the casual glance, but were generally 
detectable with some close scrutiny. Digital additions, deletions, and alterations can be 
nearly undetectable and are the subject of considerable research. Digital forensics research

Hany Farid notes: “Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Mussolini, and other dictators routinely doctored 
photographs so that the images aligned with their messages…They knew if they changed 
the visual record, they could change history.” (Farid, 2019) Digital manipulation requires 
“…techniques for reverse image searches, metadata analysis, ﬁnding image imperfections 
introduced by JPEG compression, image cloning, tracing pixel patterns, and detecting 
images that are computer-generated.” (Farid, 2019) 
Through close analysis of two famous presidential photographs, we have demon-
strated the value of proximity—the proximity of a recording device to the event, the 
representational abilities and constraints governing the richness and functionality of the 
representation, and the contextualizing roles of various sorts of epidata—to understanding 
and instilling relevancy over time. 
We emphasize that both of these photographs were made as the only records and 
each by the only individual with a camera at the event. Now, 58 years after the Johnson 
swearing in photograph and 10 years after the “Situation Room” image, it is routine that 
many more recording devices are typically on scene. The New York Times produced a 
visual investigation of the events of January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC, of which it 
said: “A six-month Times investigation has synchronized and mapped out thousands of 
videos and police radio communications from the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, providing the most 
complete picture to date of what happened — and why.” (Khavin, 2021) 
Most of those recording devices are sophisticated and highly portable and capable of 
recording video, sound, and GPS location data. This promises more sorts of data, trian-
gulation of representations, path tracking, and multiple representational agendas—news 
media reportage, participant eyewitness views, police recordings of events and reactions. 
Intriguing potential is balanced by two points: each of the recording devices has its own

42

More Than Meets the Eye
limitations; the agglomeration of all the representations requires organizing principles and, 
perhaps, selection practices that impose their own distancing from individual perceptions 
of the events. Ensuing archival processes are impacted by these limitations, as archival 
practices themselves can pose limitations depending on purpose, space, and available 
metadata. 
We assert that the greater the distance—temporal, spatial, cultural—a person holds 
from an event, the greater the need for connecting threads between that person’s abstract 
universals and the particulars of the event. A photograph is an exquisite representation 
of the surfaces in front of the camera; yet, as with all representations, the highlight-
ing of certain attributes, necessarily means leaving some behind (Marr, 1982). Some of 
the attributes left behind are due to technical capabilities of the recorder and some are 
the choice of the photographer. For a photograph to function as one of those connect-
ing threads a viewer must know both the representational capabilities of the medium at 
the time of making, together with the intended purpose. As with any representation, the 
functionality of a photograph depends on the viewer understanding the making of the 
representation. 
Another set of photos, of a president in a time of crisis were made under very different 
circumstances. While similar representational issues hold for these, the very different 
circumstances of the image production afford a set of spatiotemporal particulars that form, 
in a small way, an abstract universal. 
2.6.9
Crisis 2001 
An intriguing companion for the Stoughton and Souza photographs is the set of images 
made of President George W. Bush in a Florida classroom for a routine visit to promote 
reading. As seen in Fig. 2.24, there are many students, advisors, and media professionals. 
There is nothing about the photograph that “says” George W. Bush. We can see words 
on objects in the photograph—White House—though they are not native elements of 
the photograph. This single photograph tells us nothing about a crisis developing. The 
signiﬁcant, intriguing difference from the Johnson swearing in ceremony on Air Force 
One and Obama in the Situation Room is this event was recorded by multiple cameras— 
both still and moving images.
If one does a Google search on “George Bush in classroom 9/11” several images come 
up, as in Fig. 2.25. A screen shot of some of those images shows different moments— 
Chief of Staff Andrew Card’s head at different distance from Bush’s head—and different 
angles and different framing. Audio was recorded during the event, but what Card whis-
pers is not audible. We know now that this is the moment President Bush receives word 
of the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York; yet there is still nothing in the 
ofﬁcial White House photographs or the media images that “says” terrorists or Twin Tow-
ers. For all the extraordinary speciﬁcity of the images with their recording of the photon

data of the moment, captions and the stories within which the images are imbedded are 
necessary for linking the spatiotemporal particulars to the abstract universals of “what’s 
going on here?”.
A few minutes after President Bush had ﬁnished his reading with the school children in 
Florida, he gathered with advisors in a nearby classroom to get the latest intelligence on 
the events in New York. One of the White House photos of that time—visible in the top 
row of images in Fig. 2.25, second from the right—shows another portrait of a president at 
work during a crisis. This photograph differs from others we have discussed by actually 
presenting a small glimpse of the crisis at hand. In Fig. 2.26 we see a ﬁgure pointing 
behind President Bush toward a television screen showing an image of the Twin Towers 
in New York with a plume of smoke billowing out. The screen occupies only a small 
fraction of the area of the image and the screen is partly obscured by light reﬂections; 
yet, an image of the crisis itself—or, perhaps more properly, an image of an image of a 
fraction of a second within the crisis—is there.
Twenty years later, we ﬁnd through online search tidbits of proximity data scattered 
throughout search results. Data that offers more than the eye can see in the images. Much 
of this data has been collected over the ensuing years, offering proximity to the viewer. 
Much like the Johnson swearing in event, this proximity data serves to remind and inform 
people across generations. In sum, epidata serves to keep the photon data functional.

Personal Presidential Photograph Epidata 
In 2012 the Ms. Magazine Blog posted a piece on Barry Goldwater as a conservative 
Republican who had supported women’s reproductive rights. (Chesler, 2012) Illustrat-
ing the post was the photograph in Fig. 2.27 of Goldwater during the 1964 presidential 
campaign, Lyndon Johnson’s ﬁrst election since the assassination of John F. Kennedy. 
One might wonder just why this picture of Goldwater was chosen to illustrate the arti-
cle. The image clearly has crease marks and was made outdoors. The image in Fig. 2.28 
by Marion Trikosko for U.S. News & World Report shows Goldwater a few months later, 
shortly after his losing the presidential election. It is a more standard professional image 
available on Wikimedia with no known copyright restraints. It might be that in 2012 the 
author simply knew Flickr.com was a place to go to ﬁnd images with Creative Commons 
sharing agreements.
The photo credit at the bottom of the article reads: Photo of Barry Goldwater from 
Flickr user zudark under Creative Commons 3.0. If one goes to Flickr and seeks out 
the image from “zudark” one sees something rather more complex. Zudark’s page on 
Flickr.com actually notes that the photograph was made by “pelicanwind,” aka Brian 
O’Connor.

As to epidata, Brian was 17 years old when he made this image of Barry Goldwater. 
Just a few months earlier he had been sitting in his high school physics class, when the 
door burst open and the chemistry blurted out between tears that President Kennedy had 
been shot. 
During the election campaign, Brian spent about half an hour with Goldwater and a 
few campaign workers walking along the main street in the largest city in New Hampshire 
occasionally chatting with the candidate about politics and about photography—Goldwa-
ter was an accomplished, published photographer. This image was ﬁrst published in the 
Manchester High School Central school newspaper in the Spring of 1964. At that time 
there were no crease marks on the image. The original negatives and prints from the 
shoot disappeared over time. A single small print that Brian had made came to light— 
quite literally—in 2005 at the bottom of a box of books in his parents’ attic. The print had 
suffered various photo print ravages of time, but a digital copy and some digital editing 
made it viewable again. The crease marks were left as a reminder of the physical ravages 
that easily plague analog & chemical photography. The image itself, unremarkable on the 
face of it, still brings back visceral memories of the times for the photographer. 
We contacted the author of the article, Ellen Chesler: 
…curious if [you happen to recall why you] used the particular image of Barry Goldwater as 
[your] illustration, as [Brian] made the photograph in 1964. [we are] well aware that there are 
more pressing issues all around us, but if a moment arises and the question piques interest, 
[we] would be most grateful for a reply. 
Her response gave substance to our assumption that Flickr.com was simply a convenient 
source an image that could be used without rights fees:

Actually, it was the folks at Salon, where the piece ran, who chose the image… because the 
piece mentions Goldwater’s support for family planning ..... I suspect a photo editor there just 
picked it up from elsewhere on the web....(Chesler, 2019)

Through this journey of various photographs, we see that an image contains (represents) 
more than meets the eye. Rich, ancillary data that exists around photon data opens avenues 
of interest. These data, epidata, offer opportunity for proximity as potential points of 
access increasing the potential of use of the information. Epidata are not limited to 
images, as evidenced in our opening section discussing Wilson’s Two Kinds of Power. 
Epidata presents as a package of data around information painting a picture more vivid 
in interpretation and subsequent access. Epidata are not one-dimensional offering a single 
point of proximity. In the culminating section we explore more complex presentations of 
epidata and proximity. 
To this point we have focused our explorations of proximity and epidata on images. 
Early in our work we brieﬂy mentioned Brian’s experience of opening up students’ will-
ingness to read Wilson’s Two Kinds of Power. We turn now to the role of proximity 
and epidata opening avenues into word-based document discovery. In the following we 
demonstrate how these notions are much more complex than a few words and often go 
well beyond the linearity of a single proximal tie. 
We opened our narrative sharing the fact that we share a close intellectual relationship. 
We both are academic descendants of Patrick Wilson. Elfreda Chatman, Laurie’s major 
doctoral studies advisor, studied under Wilson at the same time as Brian, as sketched in 
Fig. 2.29. 
Elfreda served as Laurie’s doctoral dissertation advisor for three years, as sketched in 
Fig. 2.30. Not once during that time did Elfreda mention the name nor did she mention 
the work of Patrick Wilson.

More Than Meets the Eye
Fig. 2.30 Sketch of Chatman 
and Bonnici connection 
A year into her career as a professor Laurie accepted a faculty appointment in Texas, 
but not at the same university where Brian serves as a professor. Their respective uni-
versities are located in the same city in Texas. Being in the same ﬁeld and being in the 
same city, there is some likelihood our paths would have crossed. However, our meeting 
actually came about because a mutual friend knew we were both interested in kayaking. 
On our ﬁrst kayaking adventure, as sketched in Fig. 2.31, we discovered our common 
intellectual connection. The realization coming through a familiarity in language when 
discussing our research. By language we mean the words we used to describe our research 
as well as how we expressed our ideas to convey meaning. When one commences out 
from their academic home of doctoral studies and embarks on the journey of building a 
career at another institution, this kind of familiarity and intellectual tie is rewarding in 
both professional work and personal friendships, making for strong ties, as we see in our 
collaborative work over the years. 
Brian mentioned Wilson a number of times during that ﬁrst kayaking foray, as he 
continued to do in others over the ensuing weeks and months. Laurie wondered “who is 
this Wilson fellow?” To Brian’s amazement, Laurie had never been introduced to Wilson’s 
work during her time spent under Elfreda’s tutelage. Brian once blurted out that he heard

much of Wilson’s ideas in Laurie’s discussions of research and asked who her dissertation 
chair had been. This was the step into a web of proximity with Wilson. In Laurie’s early 
explorations of Wilson’s work, she was intrigued by Two Kinds of Power (Wilson, 1968) 
as well as Public Knowledge, Private Ignorance (Wilson, 1977). But it was Second-Hand 
Knowledge (Wilson, 1983) that she found a common thread connecting Wilsonian thought 
with her own interests in information sharing in online social media (OSM). Interestingly, 
Laurie felt that Wilson’s work resonated more closely with her own research endeavors 
than did that of Elfreda’s work, as sketched in Fig. 2.32. 
Is it possible Elfreda never saw the connection? Whatever the reason, an immediate 
proximal tie between Elfreda and Laurie evaded an intellectual tie with Wilson’s intel-
lectual work. And to further test the potential of proximity, Second-Hand Knowledge 
(Wilson, 1983) is the one work Brian has not read as a published book; he assisted in the 
indexing, so read it in manuscript. It was the familiarity distinguished through shared lan-
guage to express research, proximal ties through human relationships (Elfreda and Brian 
as doctoral student colleagues), Laurie’s studying under Elfreda, and a common interest 
in kayaking shared by Brian and Laurie which resulted in a path of proximity to Laurie’s 
connection with Wilson’s work. 
Through this ideascape, we present the complexities of proximity and epidata that open 
avenues to useful information. The notions of shared language, ideas, relationships and

hobbies (epidata) make up the information package consisting of epidata (info surrounding 
info) and the information. Through this ﬁrst-person journey we realized the complexities 
evidenced in proximity that make up metadata are not random, but rather form a web 
of connections and disconnections. We explore webs of connection in more depth in the 
following sections.

Epidata, Clues, Threads, Webs
3.1
Achieving Proximity
We propose Epidata as a term for all the sorts of clues to ﬁnding, encountering, and
understanding/making use of information that exist outside the ordinarily available tools
of data and metadata. Our retelling of the Ariadne and Theseus tale presents the utility of
a single clue. Our example of intellectual connections presented in Chap. 2 demonstrate
some of the complexities that clues offer in leading to information discovery. Now we
sketch some scenarios using multiple clues, forming webs of proximity.
A clue, a ball of thread, whether physical or metaphorical is capable of weaving a
conversation with the past and inﬂuencing the present. For Theseus, the clue kept track of
all the twists and turns of his path through the maze Daedalus had constructed to conﬁne
the Minotaur, as sketched in Fig. 3.1, and its victims, then return alive to Ariadne’s loving
arms from which he had set out.
We recently happened upon Life Beyond Humans (Lubow, 2022) which examines
artist/scientist Tomas Saraceno’s “obsession with balloons and spiders”—a spider web
seems to be a useful metaphor/model, as it is a vibrant instrument using subtle clues
to alert the spider to events happening within the structure, to potential prey. The clues,
the multiple threads in contact with one another and with the spider enable us to sketch
the possibly complex relations holding among multiple parties and multiple practices that
may hold within a proximity event.
On the ﬁrst page of the introduction to his Two Kinds of Power, information philosopher
Patrick Wilson writes: “How can a man be sure of ﬁnding, in the great mass of writings,
good and bad, pedestrian and extraordinary, the writings that would be of value to him?”
On the ﬁrst page of Chap. 1 Wilson begins his task of making “quite clear what are the
different varieties of inhabitants of [the bibliographic universe]” thus:

Epidata, Clues, Threads, Webs
Fig.3.1 Ariadne’s clue keeps Theseus in proximity to the exit from the labyrinth
A man writes a poem, a letter to a friend, a report on an investigation; he spends a certain
amount of time, a few minutes or many, at consecutive work or spread out over many days,
constructing a particular linguistic object, a piece of language. When he has ﬁnished, that is,
when he has decided to call the piece of work complete …
In that one paragraph “he” appears eight times. There are some 50 instances of such uses
of “man” in the 155 pages of the book; there are 54 instances of person, but none of
“woman,” so it is easy to see why some contemporary readers would assume some form
of gender bias.
It was simple enough to explain to the students who did not want to read Wilson’s Two
Kinds of Power because the author was “sexist,” that Wilson, writing in 1968, was operat-
ing in a slightly different culture. On the whole, the language was common to Wilson and
the students, except for the critical difference of gender-neutral terms; and the interests in
bibliography were common, even if Wilson’s notions were more philosophical than what
the students had previously encountered. There was signiﬁcant overlap, signiﬁcant com-
mon ground, signiﬁcant proximity so that a small piece of epidata, a clue, about publisher
formatting norms of the day enabled the students to engage with the rest of the work.

3.2
Spinning Webs of Clues: Bounty Hunting and Undercover Police Work
55
A few explanatory threads were enough to weave a web of proximity between the stu-
dents and the author; the antecedents of both parties were similar and required only a
little bit of adjustment.
Let us now turn to some examples of achieving proximity in situations more complex
than explaining pronoun usage changes over a thirty-year time span. More complexity
than Ariadne giving Theseus a single clue so that no matter his distance from or how
many turns he made, he could return to her simply, if not easily. These are situations
requiring webs of clues to achieve proximity—webs not just as substrates, but also as
a means of maneuvering and evaluating, using the vibrations of the clues together with
their stickiness.
3.2
Spinning Webs of Clues: Bounty Hunting and Undercover
Police Work
Two pieces of criminal justice research in which we were involved help us to see the ﬁnd-
ing, spinning, and weaving of clues into a web speciﬁcally to achieve physical, Euclidian
proximity to a suspect or fugitive. Some years ago, we had opportunities to work with
David O’Connor, a highly regarded fugitive recovery agent with an Ivy League degree. At
the same time we also worked with Baris Aksakal, an experienced undercover narcotics
ofﬁcer, working on a doctoral dissertation modeling street-level information processing.
Over time the two came to know each other and to contribute to each other’s thinking. In
writing a panel description for an early presentation of this work, we wrote:
On-the-ﬂy decision making, information juggling, analysis under duress, and the language of
daily life come under consideration. Humans are capable of thinking deductively and using
deterministic systems, yet they conduct much of their lives thinking analogically and acting
on the basis of experience, hunches, and best guesses–greater consideration of these abilities
should enhance retrieval system design. (Blair, et al., 2005)
We note that fugitive recovery agent—bounty hunter—O’Connor, said early on that
“bounty hunting is an information profession—it is seldom a simple known item search.”
Similarly, Aksakal, in his dissertation, notes:
Often the process of information seeking involves the lack of a “known item.” This is very
true of police work. Even if a description is given of a suspect, this does not lead to the direct
location of the criminal. Much work and juggling of information must be done.
The accounts of the search for clues, evaluating them, and weaving them together given by
both O’Connor and Aksakal resonate with the description of evolving searches in Bates’s
berry picking model:

56

Epidata, Clues, Threads, Webs
Each new piece of information they encounter gives them new ideas and directions to follow
and, consequently, a new conception of the query. At each stage they are not just modifying
the search terms used in order to get a better match for a single query. Rather the query itself
(as well as the search terms used) is continually shifting, in part or whole. (1989 p. 408)
3.2.1
What Do I Need to Know in Order to End Up Where the Target
Is?
This is the foundational question for tracking down a fugitive, a suspect, or even a doc-
ument assumed to exist but for which there is no locative data. Someone who has been
charged with a crime but wants to stay out of jail until their trial can often post a ﬁnan-
cial bond to guarantee that they will appear in court on the appointed date. In order to
afford the bond, many charged suspects secure loans from bail bond agencies. As part
of that process, they are required to give certain diachronic data such as name, date of
birth, address, and the like. Thus, they seem to be known items; however, “known item”
typically carries the connotation that the ‘item’s’ location is known or easily discover-
able. If someone walks into a library and asks: “Where do I ﬁnd Patrick Wilson’s ﬁrst
book?” a librarian can look in a catalogue, ﬁnd Wilson’s books, check the dates on the
document records, ﬁnd the earliest date, look in the location ﬁeld, and direct the patron
to the target document. The readily available diachronic data links directly to a known
location. However, the fugitive or the suspect is actively hiding, actively not being not
being linked by their diachronic data to a known address. The same could be said to be
essentially true for the information a researcher “knows” must exist but cannot describe,
provide sufﬁcient diachronic data. This is not to say that the known attributes are useless;
they provide initial contact points, possible database search terms, and descriptions for
others to use. Here a notice sent to ﬁre stations in locations the fugitive in the case we
analyzed might be operating:
On [DATE] I received a call from Dennis Bail Bonds in Chester, New Hampshire. They
inquired as to whether I would be interested in taking a contract to ﬁnd an individual. I stated
that I was. I went to Chester to pick up the appropriate paperwork and discuss pertinent par-
ticulars. The individual was one Anthony Caruso, DOB 10/05/44. Reason for location was
revocation of bail that was posted for the subject at Belknap Superior Court. I was informed
that the bail bond was in the amount of $50,000.00 and was issued by a Mr. Ed Brown.
Information was relatively sparse:

The question: “What do I need to know in order to end up where the target is?”
becomes operationalized as “What are the bits and pieces that can be spun into clues
that will accurately predict a location for the fugitive and a time that they will be there?”
The target attribute is the synchronic, functional attribute: where (O’Connor et al., 2003).
The search process, the attempt to achieve physical proximity depends on achieving a
conceptual, even kinship proximity with the target. Aksakal notes:
As suggested in the discussion of Chatman’s concept of small worlds, undercover police ofﬁ-
cers have to have an ability to think, speak, act, and even live like the other side – “walk the
walk, talk the talk.” They have to know the unwritten meanings of words stemming from
another culture: they have to be able to play different language games. Wittgenstein gives
examples of language games that ﬁt the context of undercover work, such as reporting an event
and speculating about an event. Wittgenstein, in addition to Chatman, explains the seman-
tic parts of information transformation that are not so explicit in the Shannon-Weaver model.
Both Wittgenstein and Chatman explain the role and context of the language of the under-
cover world. This language is part of the environment of which the sender and receiver are a
part.
We have long used a quote from wildlife photographer and animal tracker, Paul Rezendes
(Rezendes, 1992) when speaking of modeling representations of questions and documents:
Many people today think tracking is simply ﬁnding a trail and following it to the animal that
made it. …I think the true meaning of reading tracks and signs has in the forest has been

58
3
Epidata, Clues, Threads, Webs
pushed into the background by an overemphasis on ﬁnding the next track. …If you spend half
an hour ﬁnding the next track, you may have learned a lot about ﬁnding the next track but not
much about the animal. If you spend time learning about the animal and its ways, you may
be able to ﬁnd the next track without looking. Tracking an animal …brings you closer to it in
perception.
3.2.2
Serious or Deadly Consequences
Undercover police work differs from fugitive recovery in one signiﬁcant way—where the
bail bond skip is known, the target of an undercover operation may well not be known.
That said, the assumptions and processes are largely the same. Aksakal echoes the fugitive
recovery agent’s comment that bounty hunting is an information profession:
In the daily lives of undercover police, there are massive amounts of data received from dif-
ferent sources. Inadequate processing of large amounts of data can have serious or deadly
consequences. The important question for rookies is how will they separate the needed infor-
mation from “information pollution”? I searched for a way to put this process into a dynamic,
open system structure model of how an undercover cop seeks, gathers, ﬁlters, and transforms
the information.
3.2.3
Expertise and Trifles
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Doyle, 1892) has Sherlock Holmes comment: “It is, of course, a
triﬂe, but there is nothing so important as triﬂes.”Aksakal asserts that in fugitive recovery
and undercover police work:
information seeking and gathering is not just your average subject or keyword search in
the library catalogs or even a simple search in police databases. Information seeking in the
streets cannot realistically make signiﬁcant use of the methods that are developed for more
conventional information seeking behaviors. (Aksakal, 2005)
• Both formal and informal methods are signiﬁcant
• Small things matter (as possible clues)
• Expertise is more than the sum of several pieces of knowledge.
The importance of expertise and triﬂes is emphasized by the Supreme Court case, Terry
v. Ohio (1968). Aksakal observes that the Court holds:

3.2
Spinning Webs of Clues: Bounty Hunting and Undercover Police Work
59
Fig.3.2 Early conceptualization of Aksakal social virtual interface model
the nature of police work depends on experience and the ability to comprehend more about
conditions associated with criminal behavior than a normal citizen. [H]unches, sixth sense,
feelings, variable levels of trust and reliability, fear, pride, and twisting paths are major parts
of undercover police work.
Aksakal’s model of street level undercover police work, as sketched in Fig. 3.2, assumes
“real people are making real information judgments in face-to- face, human-to-human
situations.” It serves as a “systems model for social network situations that cannot easily
be explicitly measured because of the complexity of interactions impacting user behavior,”
especially when those interactions are woven “together with the very real danger involved
in these situations.”
Dreyfus and Dreyfus assert that experts gain their expertise with “training through
numerous practice and “real” situations,” (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986), giving credibility to
the notion of police expertise or “sixth sense” recognized by the Supreme Court’s decision
Terry v. Ohio (U.S. Supreme Court, 1968). Aksakal’s analysis of the descriptive statistics
for the transformation stage indicators of the model, together with content analysis of
interviews with veteran undercover police indicate that the subjects “believe that their job
requires more hunting than just simple gathering [and that it] requires more experience
and adaptation to the dynamic characteristics of those environments.”
Aksakal’s early notes and sketches of non-linear and poly-dimensional qualities of
“street-level” police work, as shown in the sample in Fig. 3.3, uses “the sizes, the irregular
lines, and the overwriting [to] demonstrate the multidimensional and multilayered nature
of the model better than standard graphical representations.” (Aksakal, 2005, p. 30).
Speaking of Aksakal’s model of the “general, non-linear, not ‘perfect,’ and ‘make-shift’
nature of information ﬂow and processing in street-level undercover police work” David
O’Connor notes, “[I]t better deﬁnes the complexity of the problem and better illustrates
where many of the contentious issues originate. But there also was a great need within the
police community itself for a model that clearly deﬁned how the “process” of effective

Fifty-Two Stories to an Arrest
In an earlier publication (O’Connor et al., 2003) we presented a 38-page condensed ver-
sion of the daily notes kept during a six-month investigation, commenting: “it is only
with such thick description that we see the importance of small details, the importance
of persistence, the importance of personal commitment, and the importance of analyzing
failures for clues to new paths.” We had titled the chapter in which we discussed this case
52 Stories to an Arrest because there were 52 primary components to spinning the threads
of the clues; they are summarized as:
24 people—relatives, acquaintances, victims
4 hotels/motels
4 car rental sites
3 credit card companies

Our analysis of the case report and subsequent discussions with the recovery agent
yielded a general set of activities for spinning clues and weaving a web for recovery of
fugitives:

Spinning Webs of Clues: Bounty Hunting and Undercover Police Work

fugitive recovery
• generate several threads or lines of investigation
• establish, monitor, maintain, generate collaborators
• monitor all the lines of investigation
• evaluate progress
• generate new threads
• modify threads
• abandon threads
• look for anomalies
• inform the generation and monitoring of the threads
– previous experience and
– knowledge of what fugitives do.
At that time, we constructed a multi-layered model reﬂecting the variety of tactics, num-
ber of collaborations, and constant juggling and evaluation represented in the attempt to
construct a web of proximity, summarized in Fig. 3.4 and the following.
3.2.5
Functional, Pragmatic, Contingent, Satisficing Model
We established the model on Copeland’s “functional, pragmatic, contingent, and satis-
ﬁcing” model of engineering design activity (O’Connor et al., 2003). We elaborated on the
model with callouts to collaboration, spinning and evaluating search threads, and the non-
linear nature of the process. Collaboration included assistance in one event, team member

for the entire search, temporary member of the team, evaluation of each collaboration.
Spinning and evaluating search threads included launching multiple threads simultane-
ously, evaluating threads, discarding threads, spinning threads together, launching new
threads. The nonlinear nature of the search included frequent evaluation of the entire
search, acknowledgment of the iterative nature of portions of the process, and acceptance
that the search might arduous.
These search components, as sketched in Fig. 3.5 ﬁt our analysis of the case study
and our conversations with the recovery agent; however, the illustration of the model
was too linear to represent their interconnections. We sought a modeling structure similar
to Copeland’s bricoleur model in Fig. 3.6, a nonlinear model incorporating the pragmatic
and contingent necessities of street-level investigative work. Those connections were high-
lighted during our discussions with O’Connor and Aksakal, when we brought up Bates’s
“idea tactics.” O’Connor noted that they are quite similar to the search tactics in fugitive
recovery and undercover police work. He emphasized that they are not deployed sequen-
tially but concurrently. The idea/search tactics and the threads of the investigation are
juggled—each is analyzed for its progress and potential, then many are evaluated in rela-
tion to others, continued, dropped, or modiﬁed. Expertise, triﬂes, and evaluation yield the
epidata, the web of clues in both the ancient sense and the contemporary sense, that bring
about physical proximity with the target. We adapted our analyses and the models from
Aksakal, Copeland, and O’Connor to the web of proximity format as in Fig. 3.7.

Shaking Up the Personal Knowledge Store: Browsing
and Idiocy
We turn here to scholarly browsing as a search activity with no speciﬁed target and no
initial clues. Academic scholars are charged with being creative, with generating new
knowledge. Knowledge yet to be generated cannot yet have been classiﬁed or indexed.
That is, one cannot walk into a library or login to a search engine and search with descrip-
tors for something that does not yet exist, that has not yet been described. One cannot
walk into a library or logon to a digital platform and ask for “my new knowledge paper”
or even “existing works likely to spark a new idea.” How is a scholar to achieve proximity
to a documentary source when neither the question nor the likely source of satisfaction is
known?
Browsing has long been a response to this question. Browsing is fundamentally a
matter of serial proximity to document after document until one is found that works, that
inspires, that ﬁlls in the missing piece. It is notable that “browse” refers to animals feeding

66
3
Epidata, Clues, Threads, Webs
Fig.3.7 Web of proximity for fugitive tracking
in the wild, “sometimes carelessly used for graze, but properly implying the cropping of
scanty vegetation.” (Weiner & Simpson, 2004) The sheer number of documents on stack
shelves or in a digital environment does not imply creative sustenance.
We use “idiocy” to emphasize the utterly personal, idiosyncratic nature of browsing.
Idiocy might seem a harsh term, yet it relates directly to creativity and to navigation for
creative purposes. While its current use is essentially pejorative, its etymology ﬁts the
notion of creativity. Liddell and Scott tell us that the Greek root—idios—means:
‡διoς
I. one’s own, pertaining to oneself: hence,
1. private, personal,
2. one’s own,
3. τ`α ‡. private interests,
II. separate, distinct,
b. ‡. λ´oγoς, in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, private account,
2. strange, unusual; peculiar, exceptional, eccentric,
3. peculiar, appropriate (Liddell & Scott, 1940).

3.3.1
Bring Forth, Produce, Beget, Cause
Creativity has at its root “to grow;” beyond that root there is a great deal of speculation,
debate, and a considerable number of experimental inquiries. Sculptor George Segal has
used “total goulash” to describe the complex web of attributes that comprise this state/set
of states. (Isakson, in O’Connor, 1988) Some general characterizations of creativity seem
to hold. For our examination of proximity, we can say it is “a unique integration of
various mental operations,” (Haley, in O’Connor, 1988) in large part an intentional, and
conscious attempt to reconcile or reformulate seemingly antithetical elements into a new
concept embodying the ‘truth’ of each of the seminal elements. (Rothenberg, in O’Connor,
1988) Such reconciliation or reformulation requires the ability to ‘know thyself’ (Demey,
in O’Connor, 1988), that is, to be in a ‘state of readiness for catching similarities’ and
to be ‘gullible’, making free-associations. (Arieti, in O’Connor, 1988) All manner of
connections are made willingly, especially those which seem ‘illogical’ or unsanctioned
by current knowledge or models; yet the connections remain subject to critical evaluation.
3.3.2
Locus of Representation
We assert that searching for information/inspiration in a document environment is an
attempt by the searcher to bring their knowledge state attributes surrounding unknown
values (reduced here to a small array for simplicity) into proximity with similar arrays
in other sources—documents representing knowledge states of their authors. We might
say that one is aware of one’s own antecedents (e.g.: language, topic knowledge, time
frame, experiences, relationships) and is seeking similar bundles of antecedents wrapped
around what is missing. A document that has some threshold of matching antecedents
and a value in the cell that is empty in the seeker’s array has some probability of being
useful. Search systems generally establish forms of representation as well as general rules
for how questions can be put to the system.
We can model the document search as an attempt to bring the seeker’s knowledge
state into a class of documents, as in Fig. 3.8. Simple classiﬁcation theory tells us that
members of a class share all (classical) or some signiﬁcant threshold (probabilistic) of
attributes; so, if we can ﬁnd a class that matches some or all of the scholarly searcher’s
known attributes with one or more documents with the same attributes, then the blank
attributes in the scholar’s array, may be ﬁlled by values in the corresponding cells in the
documents in the class. Bringing the scholar’s array into proximity with the document
arrays may well provide satisfaction.
What though of the case of the browsing scholar? essentially all attributes of the
scholar, all antecedents, are at play, as are all the attributes of all the documents. A
scholar navigates a document collection in hope of a ‘eureka’ situation—the discovery of
new knowledge, of new syntheses. Such seeking often relies on making new connections

68
3
Epidata, Clues, Threads, Webs
Fig.3.8 Searchers and documents represented as knowledge state arrays for classifying
between attributes of documents, between concepts in the user’s knowledge store (with
document attributes as catalyst), and between the user’s concepts and attributes of doc-
uments. The scholar seeking at the frontiers of knowledge requires an approach which
is not anchored to existing knowledge and relationships; they must turn to inward; they
must shift the locus of representation.
In a very small collection or in some ideal world, it would be reasonable to say: “Look
at every document in the collection and if there is anything useful there you will ﬁnd it.”
For searches in which there is some idea of what would be a suitable document standard
representation schemes can achieve useful degrees of proximity; they carve the search
space into manageable chunks. In the scholarly search there are few means of carving
the search space to manageable chunks, save for non-topical attributes such as docu-
ments in languages not spoken/read, ﬁelds in which the searcher is already knowledgeable
(Fig. 3.9).
Browsing generally relies on some form of sampling to carve the search space to a
manageable size, to accomplish within real world constraints the possibilities of an ‘ideal’
retrieval system which would screen all user attributes against all document attributes of
all works in the collection (Robertson et al., in O’Connor, 1988). It is a matter of sampling
texts at various levels of penetration into the collection as a whole and into any individual
document in order to make a judgement as to whether a document has sparked a eureka
moment, then to decide whether or not to move on to sample more (O’Connor, 1988).
The seemingly serendipitous discovery is not simply a matter of blind luck, rather it is
the recognition of a valuable document attribute/connection discovered by means outside

Fig.3.9 Browsing as sampling in documents sharing some attributes with seeker in hopes of ﬁlling
gaps or connecting concepts when the gaps are unknown
established access system rules and relying on the user’s self-knowledge. We have noted
in earlier work that browsing both burdens and empowers the scholar by:
• Enabling control of location and depth of penetration in a collection
• Formulating the rules of representation—what is highlighted and what left behind
• Determining the acceptability of tradeoffs in representation
• Determining the sampling method.
The web of proximity a eureka moment in Fig. 3.10 for relies on the browsing scholar’s
ability to sample and to glimpse at data points in documents at loci and depths determined
by themselves and on the ﬂy as the search progresses. Little else is at hand. Document
attributes are sampled and evaluated; strands of clues emerge, some to be seen no more
and some yield eureka.
Let us look at the weaving of a complex web closely related to the Wilson gender-
neutral pronoun case. We will present a good deal of detail in order to emphasize the
scale of the weaving project.

¥νδρα μoι ™ννεπε, μoàσα, πoλ´υτρoπoν
The case of Wilson’s Two Kinds of Power was simple, in the sense that both parties—the
author and the readers—used essentially the same language and were engaged in the same
topic. How, though, is a contemporary English reading audience to ﬁnd proximity with
this message?
¥νδρα μoι ™ννεπε, μoàσα, πoλ´υτρoπoν, Öς μ´αλα πoλλ`α
πλ´αγχθη, ™πε`ι Tρo´ιης ƒερ`oν πτoλ´ιεθρoν ™περσεν
Many of the characters look like those of the modiﬁed Roman alphabet we use, many
do not. We have shown this message to numerous people over the years and a frequent
(correct) response is: “It’s Greek to me.” Only very seldom has this meant the person
knew Greek; typically, it has been a way of saying: “It makes no sense to me.” Wyatt
Mason interviewing Odyssey translator Emily Wilson notes he said to her: “Treat me,” I
interrupted, ‘as if I don’t know Greek,’ as, in fact, I do not.” (Mason, 2017).
How are we to achieve some form of functional proximity in a case where the sepa-
ration between author and reader is not 30 years difference in a common language, but
3000 years in a very different language? The Oxford English Dictionary reminds us that

3.4
¥νδρα μoι ™ννεπε, μoàσα, πoλ´υτρoπoν
71
the earlier deﬁnition of proximity was: The fact or condition of being near or close in
abstract relations, as kinship (esp. in proximity of blood), time, nature, etc.; closeness.
Since this text is one of the oldest in the Western literary tradition, there are
translations. However, translations have shortcomings. Patrick Wilson notes:
A translation must preserve the sense of its original, and it is not hard to imagine, or ﬁnd,
instances of texts claiming to be translations of such and such a work, but bearing so little
resemblance to the original, preserving so little of the sense of the original as to be ‘no trans-
lation at all.’ But there is no imaginable way of saying precisely how much of the sense of the
original must be preserved, for a putative translation really to be a translation of some text.
(Wilson, 1968)
Scott notes in the translators’ introduction to Plato’s The Republic, the proximity issues
in maintaining “the sense of the original” and suggests “conversation” as an approach:
Frustration results from the recognition that translation can never reproduce the original. Vari-
ances in vocabulary, sentence structure, word order, idiom, and cultural context are not only
characteristics that make every language unique; they are also the principal reasons why
translation must be a matter of conversation and not mere copying (Plato et al., 1996).
Klaver enhances the notion of translation as conversation, as a weaving of proximity:
Translation is the beginning of understanding, the shadow of thought, inviting further think-
ing. Translation reveals a transitional quality of thinking. It facilitates transitions, connections,
relations, opening new ways of understanding, shedding new light on situations. It is predi-
cated upon an ontology of being with, an epistemology of knowing with. (Klaver, 2018)
A translation of a text such Homer’s Odyssey—from which the passage above is derived—
requires more than a Greek—to—some modern language dictionary precisely because of
Scott’s “variances.” A translation is an attempt to achieve proximity by reducing the
opacity of the variances. The processes and environment of translation can be seen as a
conversation between a translator, a text, and the antecedents of the author of the text;
together with a companion conversation between the translator, an audience, and their
antecedents. A translator spins clues from specialist understanding of languages and cul-
tures and requirements then weaves a web of those clues, a web of epidata between the
ancient author’s antecedents and those of the modern audience.
While ‘translation’ of Patrick Wilson’s Two Kinds of Power for an audience three
decades later required only a few minutes effort and brief discussion of a few social
and linguistic differences, translating a text from a distant time and place, such as Homer,
requires the spinning of many threads and weaving an extensive conversation with mul-
tiple parties (Fig. 3.11). To come to a sense of how the clues are spun then woven into
a web of proximity, we look ﬁrst to Mason’s thoughtful and extensive review of Emily
Wilson’s translation, then to Wilson’s own notes.

There are more than six dozen published English translations of the Odyssey, beginning
with Chapman’s in 1616; There are 13 published in the ﬁrst two decades of the twenty-
ﬁrst century. Emily Wilson’s 2018 translation is the subject of our ﬁnal sketch. Wilson’s
conversation with the antecedents is extensive.
3.4.1
Tell Me About a Complicated Man
Reviews for Wilson’s translation of Homer’s Odyssey bespeak her ability to achieve a web
of proximity to Homer’s ancient world for the modern reader. Library Journal notes: “Wil-
son offers a ﬂuent, straightforward, and accessible version.” Acclaimed classicist Mary
Beard writes: “Wilson’s version is an exciting one …forcing us to think how approach-
able, how weird, how everyday Homeric language ever was.” The Financial Times says:

3.4
¥νδρα μoι ™ννεπε, μoàσα, πoλ´υτρoπoν
73
“Wilson’s translation feels like a restoration …she scrapes away at old encrusted layers,
until she exposes what lies beneath.”
Wilson summarizes her approach to the translation, echoing Scott’s variances, thus:
I have taken very seriously the task of understanding the language of the original text as deeply
as I can, and working through what Homer may have meant in archaic and classical Greece. I
have also taken seriously the task of creating a new and coherent English text, which conveys
something of that understanding within an entirely different cultural context.
She also notes:
“My Homer does not speak in your grandparents’ English… I have tried to keep to a register
that is recognizably speakable and readable…”. (Wilson, p. 87)
It requires only a small sample of the English translations to demonstrate the variances
existing between just those translations; the differences in times and cultures yielding differ-
ences in the words not so opaque as the Greek, yet not necessarily transparent.
Four translations of the ﬁrst lines of The Odyssey
The Man, O Muse, informe, that many a way
Wound with his wisdome to his wished stay;
(Chapman, 1614 in Nicoll, 1965).
Tell me, O Muse, of that many-sided hero
who traveled far and wide.
(Butler, 1900).
Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices,
who wandered full many ways
(Murray, 1919 in Homer et al 1995).
Tell me about a complicated man.
Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost
(Wilson, 2018).
The ﬁfth word in the very ﬁrst line of the Greek poem is then used to illustrate this point.
The adjective πoλ´υτρoπoν—polytropon—is used to describe the central ﬁgure of the tale
well before we are given the hero’s name, so we might assume it is of some considerable
importance in establishing the man’s character/fate. Yet, among the 60 predecessors to
Wilson there are more than forty translations of that word, ranging from “crafty” to “tost

74
3
Epidata, Clues, Threads, Webs
to anf fro by fate,” from “skilled in expedients” to “shifty,” and from “Ingenious” to
“for shrewdness famed/and genius versatile.” Most opt for straightforward assertions of
Odysseus’s nature, descriptions running from the positive (crafty, sagacious, versatile) to
the negative (shifty, restless, cunning).” The Liddell & Scott Greek to English dictionary
renders polytropos thus:
πoλ´υ-τρoπoς
A. much-turned, i.e. much-travelled, much-wandering, epith. of Odysseus
II. turning many ways: metaph., shifty, versatile, wily
2. ﬁckle.
3. of diseases, changeful, complicated,
III. various, manifold. (Liddell & Scott, 1940)
Wilson notes that Odysseus “seems to contain multitudes: he is a migrant, a pirate, a
carpenter, a king, an athlete, a beggar, a husband, a lover, a father, a son, a ﬁghter, a liar,
a leader, and a thief” (p. 5) and that “Most of the epithets applied to Odysseus begin
with the preﬁx poly- meaning ‘much’ or ‘many’: he is a s ﬁgure who possesses many
attributes and possesses them intensely.” Yet, he is beset by so many trials, distractions,
calamities, and challenges—so many turns that he spends 10 years simply trying to makes
his way back home from the Trojan war. To accommodate this duality, this confusion of
Odysseus being battered by turns of fortune and Odysseus turning matters his way that
πoλ´υτρoπoν foretells, Wilson translates it as “complicated,” as we see in the Liddell and
Scott usage for describing a “disease.”
Mason (2017) quotes Wilson on using complicated:
I wanted there to be a sense [that] maybe there is something wrong with this guy. You want
to have a sense of anxiety about this character, and that there are going to be layers we see
unfolded. We don’t quite know what the layers are yet. So I wanted the reader to be told: be
on the lookout for a text that’s not going to be interpretively straightforward.
3.4.2
Clues and a Web of Proximity
Wilson asserts that this “very ancient and very foreign text” presents “concerns such as
“loyalty, families, migrants, consumerism, violence, war, poverty, identity, rhetoric, and
lies [that] are in many ways deeply familiar, but we see them here in unfamiliar guises.”
How might we model the hope that “my translation will enable contemporary readers
to welcome and host this foreign poem, with all the right degrees of warmth, curiosity,
openness, and suspicion”? What are the clues Wilson weaves into a web of proximity
connecting the modern English-speaking reader?

3.4
¥νδρα μoι ™ννεπε, μoàσα, πoλ´υτρoπoν
75
We propose two sorts of clues, skeins of thread, epidata: those which connect the
antecedents of the author of “very ancient and very foreign text” with the antecedents of
the “contemporary readers.” The antecedents are of two related sorts: the conventions for
observation and action of the ancient author and of the contemporary readers (what might
be regarded as the abstract universals of each) and the conventions for representation of
each. Wilson’s introduction provides a scaffold of antecedents that include, though are
not limited to:
Conventions of observation and action in the time of Homer
• Oral tradition: patchwork of dialects, times, places
• Geographical setting: hard to pin down, some real, some fantastical
• Hospitality & guest-friendship: distinctive bond, episodes of violation
• Gods: like humans
• Women: chattel, ﬁdelity, portrayed sympathetically
• Becoming a man: role of the son of Odysseus
• Slaves: fact, tools of the elite, major role.
Conventions of representation in The Odyssey
• Predictable rhythm of orality
• Formulaic expressions loosened
• Wide range of stylistic registers
• “…stylistic pomposity is entirely un-Homeric
• Vocabulary stripped of modern agendas
• Contemporary English very different
• Sexism and patriarchy: within.
To facilitate proximity, to reduce the impact of variances, to engage the reader in the con-
versation, Wilson wraps the 12,110 lines of poetry in 80 pages of introductory material, 11
pages of translator’s notes, 6 pages of maps, 26 pages of notes, 26 pages of a glossary, and
a Twitter feed. The last of these brings into play yet another instrument to weaving a web
of proximity for the “contemporary reader.” The aptly termed “Collected tweet threads”
link opens with these words: “Professor Emily Wilson’s Twitter feed (@EmilyRCWilson)
provides her readers with insights into the art of translation.”
The radial threads (in red) are the antecedents of both the original author and the cur-
rent recipient of the message, the conventions for observation and action, together with
the conventions for representation. The concentric threads are the tools and processes by
which the translator constructs a translation conversation. We use “translation conversa-
tion” to emphasize that achieving proximity requires reducing the impact of “[v]ariances

76

in vocabulary, sentence structure, word order, idiom, and cultural context” (Sterling, 1985)
and that understanding requires an “ontology of with, an epistemology of with.” (Klaver,
2018)
The proximity web in Fig. 3.12 is the affordance, the ﬁeld of epidata that enables
understanding. The document has already been found, its physical proximity is close, lit-
erally at hand. The epidata, whether the tiny bit of information about publishing practices
when Patrick Wilson wrote Two Kinds of Power in 1968 or the years of work and expertise
of Emily Wilson weaving a conversation for a contemporary audience of Homer, affords
a conceptual proximity between distant partners in a conversation engaging in a dance of
understanding.
The complexity of Homer and the attempts at translation we offer here demonstrate
some of the most formal, academic efforts to approximate the user with a document. The
translation context allowed us to tease out and then demonstrate our notion of epidata
as an often complex web of antecedents and connections. But what of less formal, more
everyday encounters where epidata lead us to useful information. In the remaining section
we offer a series of provocations extrapolated from our own experiences. Within each we
pose questions intended to provoke further thinking and application of epidata in the
information seeking process.

Our explorations of Webs of Proximity opened with the tale of Theseus and Ariadne.
The pursuit of the Minotaur by Theseus was simple, escaping the labyrinth was thought to
be impossible. Ariadne’s offer of a skein (klewe, clue) of yarn that would maintain contact
between her and Theseus as he journeyed into the labyrinth is an exemplar thread in the
Web of Proximity. This scenario is the evidence of myth, so we presented instances of
epidata in our real-life encounters that hold potentially impactful clues for our discipline
and others. We presented instances based on photographs, cases based on word-based
documents, and cases built, literally, on hard evidence to weave an illustrative web of
proximity constructs.
Next, we present sketches of other encounters with epidata, along with some ques-
tions. In essence, we offer these provocations to ignite ideas of how webs of proximity
present epidata that, although not centrally informative, present possibilities of ﬁnding or
stumbling upon information, or hold potential to add value to information facilitating a
seeker’s decision to engage with it, to ﬁnd it useful.

pursuit of the Minotaur by Theseus was simple, escaping the labyrinth was thought to be 
impossible. Ariadne’s offer of a skein (klewe, clue) of yarn that would maintain contact 
between her and Theseus as he journeyed into the labyrinth is an exemplar thread in the 
Web of Proximity. This scenario is the evidence of myth, so we presented instances of 
epidata in our real-life encounters that hold potentially impactful clues for our discipline 
and others. Here we present sketches of other encounters with epidata, along with some 
questions. In essence, we offer these provocations to ignite ideas of how webs of proximity 
present epidata that, although not centrally informative, present possibilities of ﬁnding or 
stumbling upon information, or hold potential to add value to information facilitating a 
seeker’s decision to engage with it, to ﬁnd it useful. 
Recently I was asked by a neighbor, who had a day of scheduled errands, to look in 
on her elderly pet who had been feeling poorly. I had had no previous close contact with 
my neighbor, Judy, other than frequent passing encounters during neighborhood forays 
with our dogs. My only knowledge about her was that she hailed from Washington, DC, 
several hundred miles away from where we both currently live.

Stumbling Upon a Clue
81
When I went to my neighbor’s home and opened the door, Judy’s dog Lily was nowhere 
in sight, so I ventured into the abode. Lily either had signiﬁcant hearing loss or was 
choosing to ignore my summons. I went in search of her throughout the home. Only in 
passing did I notice any elements of décor or design. With luck, Lily popped up from a 
chair, half hidden under a blanket, located under a small collection of black and white 
photos hanging on the wall. As I greeted the aging pup, I noticed that the photos included 
Lyndon Johnson as a subject (Fig. 4.1). My interest was piqued, but Lily’s desire to go 
outside trumped further viewing. While slowly exploring the neighborhood with Lily I 
found myself wondering about the photos I just saw. While musing, I recalled that every 
US president starting with Kennedy had an appointed White House photographer. My 
knowledge informed by a recent co-authored publication centered on an informational 
exploration of presidential photos (Bonnici & O’Connor, 2021). 
Upon my return from accompanying Lily on her constitutional, I took the opportunity 
to explore the framed photos on the wall more closely. Sure enough, I noted that each of 
the three photos was signed by Yoichi Okamoto, Johnson’s ofﬁcial photographer. Given 
the quality of the photos and the signatures on the matting, I knew that these must be 
authentic pieces. Given the era these photos document, they did not correlate with my 
neighbors speculated age. Thus, I found a cognitive disconnect in the relationship between 
photos and owner. To me, Judy appeared to be too young to have worked in DC during 
the Johnson years. How did she acquire items of such limited availability? How could I 
not ask? 
The next evening, I ran into Judy as we walked our pups in the neighborhood. After 
a brief exchange of appreciation for helping Lily the day before, I mentioned that I had 
noticed the presidential photos on her wall. I reafﬁrmed that she had worked in DC, 
but that I found it intriguing as she was much too young to have served in Washington 
during the Johnson era. A hearty laugh and an assurance afﬁrmed my thinking. Then she 
followed with “well, that’s an interesting story of how I got those.” The story goes like 
this… 
4.1.1
#Clues 
Judy had worked in DC during the Reagan years as a lobbyist. During her career she had 
become quite knowledgeable of people and processes, as is often the case with DC-based 
employment. About a year after she retired, a friend contacted her inquiring about her 
knowledge about some aspect work he was attempting to accomplish involving valuation 
of collectibles. She passed on to him name and contact info of someone in DC she thought 
could help. A few months later he asked Judy to lunch when she was making a visit to DC. 
He wished to thank her for connecting him with someone who helped him signiﬁcantly 
with his work. He passed her a portfolio of photos from the Johnson photographer’s trust 
collection that were gifted to him and invited her to choose any three she wished to have.

She chose the three I had noticed hanging on her wall. But why those photos? Judy shared 
with me that the Johnson years were a part of her formative years. He served as president 
at a time when she was young, impressionable, and had strong ideas. She appreciated that 
these photos were connected with signiﬁcant events in her lifetime.

#UShistory 
Image 1 
According to Judy, Image 1, shown in Fig. 4.2, sparked an important memory in her life. 
Eisenhower was the ﬁrst election she experienced as a child and she remembers listening 
to the outcome on the radio with her father. Thus, the photo provided a tangible connec-
tion/clue to a memory of a cherished loved-one. More speciﬁcally, the image documents 
a vacant time in US history. Johnson became president upon the assassination of John F. 
Kennedy. The vice-presidency position sat vacant for a time. A gap in presidential service, 
due to Kennedy’s demise, made for a unique proximal connection between Eisenhower 
and Johnson in the line of U.S. presidents.

The remaining two images were both selected by my neighbor as they reminded her 
of activities in which she became involved in her twenties/thirties; civil rights, anti-war, 
and women’s rights. Although she did mention that there were no images in the collection 
from which she was presented to select that represented women’s rights, the pictures she 
chose still connected her to the time of her engagement with women’s rights. 
Image 2 
Image 2, shown in Fig. 4.3, in her eyes, represents an era of tumultuous activities and 
a paradigmatic shift in US history. The photo of Johnson meeting with leaders of the 
Civil Rights Movement serves as a connection/clue to those racially-charged times and, 
ultimately, to a shift that made her feel good about the actions of our political leaders. 
Image 3 
Image 3, shown in Fig. 4.4, Judy feels, gave her a sense of direct witness to the President 
during the Vietnam War years. A similar sentiment was expressed by former White House 
Photographer, David Hume Kennerly, during the Ford administration (Estrin, 2013). He 
stated in an interview about Okamoto’s work: “He captured the tension and the fatigue 
on the face of L.B.J. When you look at the pictures, you just feel like you’re there.” Judy

#Archives, #Epidata 
To date, we have not been able to locate these three images through an Internet search. 
Photos apparently taken at these same events are published online; but these speciﬁc 
images which convey different angles, lighting, or content have yet to be found. The 
mere publication of this provocation makes these retrievable by an archivist working with 
presidential photos. And this additional documentation may inform archival work of a 
related image. Or it may lead the archivist to new information. Or it may even lead to the 
images’ owner, who might provide more information or facilitate a connection with the 
person from which these were acquired. All of these possibilities being potential connec-
tions in a web of proximity. Yet none of what is written here directly informs the images 
(i.e., describes event or what is going on). Nor does our provocation content describe the

photo (metadata). Rather what is written here is an appendix, irrelevant (anecdote) or rel-
evant (epidata), to the photos. At the very least, these photos made a stronger connection 
between Judy and me—a function likely never imagined by Yoichi Okamoto, yet one of 
value to me. 
4.1.4
# Incidental Glance 
Laurie was not looking for pictures of presidents; the neighbor’s photos were seen as an 
incidental consequence of performing a neighborly act. Having recently worked on a piece 
about presidential photographs, she likely had a heightened awareness of such documents, 
yet there was no intentional seeking at play in the discovery. Seeking understanding about 
the circumstances of the photos being there led to conversations with the neighbor that 
went beyond the images and their intended meaning. The photos, in a sense, catalyzed 
understanding the neighbor. Epidata can be seen as different from data and metadata in 
its potential for—perhaps even necessity within—unintended stumbling upon a document 
and the unexpected consequences of the circumstances of that stumbling. 
We assert that ultimately usefulness is determined by the user. Users may ﬁnd doc-
uments purposely searching by or formal of idiosyncratic means, or they may stumble 
upon them in the most unlikely places following a single slender thread of proximity. An 
intermediary may provide a thread of understanding or suggest a thread for ﬁnding. How 
might a provocation such as the presidential photos on a neighbor’s wall probe your think-
ing? How might it impact your work or personal interests? How might a historian use this 
information to accomplish their work despite the lack of centrality of information? What 
other sorts of threads of proximity have you followed? What threads of proximity have 
you provided to someone? 
4.2
Thoughts on Proximity 
The tale of Theseus and Ariadne presented us with different facets of proximity. The-
seus has to sail from Athens to Knossos just to be proximate with the minotaur. Ariadne 
becomes close to Theseus and wanting to maintain physical and emotional proximity to 
him decides to help solve the problem of exiting the labyrinth. Neither Ariadne nor The-
seus has any idea of how to escape the labyrinth; however, Ariadne is close to Daedalus, 
designer of the labyrinth. It is Daedalus who comes up with the idea of using a ball of 
thread to establish a connection to the exit—a clue, a route marker for regaining proxim-
ity to the exit. Had Theseus not met Ariadne and had she not known someone who might 
have an idea, the Minotaur would no longer have been a threat to Athens, but Theseus 
would not have returned home.

Provocations and Invitations
When you make a grocery list, when you take vacation photos, when you write a 
journal article you are attempting to put the reader/viewer/user into proximity with you, 
the author. Grocery lists and vacation photos may be seen by nobody other than you, yet 
even in these cases, you (the author) are put back in time and, perhaps place—standing 
before the empty shelf in the pantry two hours earlier, or back at a fjord in Norway in 
1973. Damasio asserts that remembering something is putting neural pathways into the 
same state they were when the target of remembering originally happened. (Damasio, 
2010) The documents act as clues, codes to help neural pathways become proximate to 
some earlier state. In a conversation in 2005, Brian asked Damasio if a novelist or ﬁlm 
director could be said to be putting readers and viewers into neural states they had never 
actually experienced; Damasio replied that he would not argue against that idea. 
We posit that meaning is (or is largely) function. Authors generate documents in order 
to share some functionality—perhaps only with themselves and those close to them or 
with some wider group; seekers want some functionality. The documents (messages) gen-
erated and sought are of all sorts—books, sculptures, movies, symphonies, videos on all 
manner of topics on social media reading Ginsberg’s HOWL, hearing Ginsberg perform 
HOWL, among myriad others. 
4.3
Epidata for No Place to Go 
Is understanding of an author’s coding practices/choices absolutely necessary for func-
tional understanding of a message. We present three provocations to stir discussion. 
An incomplete understanding of coding practices seems to yield understanding of the 
message.
This is what one sees on the VIMEO page for Brian’s ﬁlm No Place to Go; it is rather  
like standard bibliographic representations (Fig. 4.5) (O’Connor, 1970). The ﬁlm was 
made under the auspices of the federal War on Poverty program in 1970 in Nashua, New 
Hampshire, where collapse of local industry had led to hard times for many in the city. 
The half-hour ﬁlm was shown on local television channels, at U.S. Congressional hear-
ings on funding low-income housing, and was used in training new members of VISTA 
(Volunteers in Service to America the “domestic Peace Corp.”) Several professionals in 
various ﬁelds had gathered statistics, drawn maps, and consulted with government ofﬁ-
cials; however, there were no photographs, nothing to present the physical evidence of 
impoverished living. Brian had worked in a companion War on Poverty program and had 
experience making ﬁlms, so he volunteered his services. 
After a showing of No Place to Go in a ﬁlm theory class at the University of California, 
Berkeley in 1984, Brian conducted a Q&A session with students and faculty. Among the 
ﬁrst comments were praise for the selection of black and white ﬁlm over color, as shown in 
Fig. 4.6, and for the use of a sound collage rather than synchronized sound and narration. 
Brian responded that while he was pleased to hear that those two production decisions

to go. Made as part of a War on Poverty program in Nashua, New Hampshire
were regarded highly by the audience, he could not take credit for the choice—there was 
no choice, only necessity.
The ﬁlm was funded by a local community action group who in turn were funded by 
federal money from the War on Poverty. Funded is a big word—there was enough money 
to shoot 45 min of camera original and edit it to half an hour and make a print. The 
standard for budgeting such a ﬁlm at the time was to assume it would require shooting 
at least 50 feet of ﬁlm for every one foot in the ﬁnal 1,000-foot, half-hour product. That 
was generally stated as a “shooting ration of 50:1 shooting ratio; No Place to Go had a 
shooting ratio of 1.5:1. All labor was volunteer. 
In 1970 sound was generally not recorded onto the ﬁlm in the camera—it was recorded 
on a separate reel to reel tape recorder. To have synchronized sound required some means 
of assuring the camera and recorder were running at exactly the same speed—no such 
system was available on such a low-budget production. This constraint actually freed the 
production team to simply build a collage of images and a collage of sounds. The camera 
was entirely handheld because Brian wanted to be mobile and did not want to embarrass 
or overwhelm people in their homes. Black & white ﬁlm was the only option since the 
indoor light levels were so low (and the fuses in the homes would not have supported 
any form of additional lighting). Therefor, black and white ﬁlm was the only available 
option. The camera was a government surplus device designed for use in the Arctic (the

ﬁlm was shot in the winter); it used a spring motor that had to be wound up before each 
shot—about 18 s maximum run time per shot. At eight pounds it was considered to be 
portable. 
In comments for a much more recent showing of the ﬁlm to a ﬁlm theory course, Brian 
wrote: 
I should say that I spent a month talking with people in the neighborhood and with city ofﬁ-
cials and with members of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA, the domestic Peace 
Corp) before shooting any ﬁlm. I asked the residents what they thought we should ﬁlm; I 
showed all footage when it came back from the lab to the residents; I asked if there was any-
thing I didn’t get right or that was too embarrassed to have go on television. The title comes 
from a line that many people said to us - this was an urban renewal project to make the city 
look better and more productive, but there was no plan to re-settle or help the residents of the 
neighborhood - all of whom were being evicted. The music track by my friend Rob Vergas 
is a rendition of a piece by Bessie Smith called No Place to Go - about a major ﬂood on the 
Mississippi River in the early 20th century. We got a really cheap guitar from a pawn shop and 
recorded Rob sitting in the bath tub in my parents’ home to get the right sound. The shooting 
I still like, the editing still works for me, even the rough audio editing works. We were trying 
to put a human face on a major problem for which there were lots of statistics and surveys but 
not a lot of emotional buy in.

4.3
Epidata for No Place to Go
89
Here we have a small and intriguing coding/decoding issue: the ﬁlm sought to achieve an 
“emotional buy in” not available from tables and charts of ﬁgures about the neighborhood. 
The statistics do not put readers into the same sort of proximity as, for example, the 
photograph of a boy standing by the door to his derelict home, as shown in Fig. 4.7. 
City leaders and audiences in later years saw that emotional impact coming in part from 
technical practices that were necessities. The well-known black and white photographs of 
the Dust Bowl were largely in black & white and were powerful, though it might be argued 
that the subjects and compositions and lighting were also signiﬁcant in the coding. Color 
would have been Brian’s choice—to show the muted, old, faded color palette of poverty 
in the area at that time; though, in looking back—that is, in engaging with audiences and 
learning that for some the grey scale palette was a clue, an emotional hook to the burdens 
of poverty—he might have opted for a mix of color and black and white IF that had been 
an option. 
The message coded with statistics and graphs represented the neighborhood, the 
people, and the living conditions in a poor neighborhood; yet that message was only 
marginally meaningful, vaguely functional to many of the people who were making the 
case for change as well as for those who had to be persuaded. The movie coded the lives 
of the neighborhood in a way that functioned well for a larger audience, even if some of

home in No Place to Go

the coding was by necessity. The ﬁlm was successful in promoting legislative changes to 
aid low-income tenants and Volunteers in Service to America used the ﬁlm for training 
new volunteers—that is to say, the ﬁlm helped bring information to the point of use. 
So, we might say the ﬁlm is the message/document and all of the detail documented 
here is the epidata that potentially impacts how contemporary audiences see the No Place 
to Go. Much of the detail also addresses the idea that necessity resulted in using black 
and white ﬁlm, which not have been Brian’s choice, but because of famous historical use 
black and white photographs to document poverty many viewers unexpectedly applied 
their antecedent understanding of historical clues to their reading of the ﬁlm. 
4.4
Translation Disease: Proximity Gone Awry? 
We recently crafted a conference presentation on translations that don’t seem to work; not 
the early attempts of students or the mistakes of a frantic tourist, but serious productions 
of crafted words in another language, a novel into ﬁlm, a piece of music into a different 
style, an opera set in a different time and place. 
We opened with Wilson’s assertion: “A translation must preserve the sense of its orig-
inal … but there is no imaginable way of saying precisely how much of the sense of the 
original must be preserved, for a putative translation really to be a translation of some 
text.” (Wilson, 1968) 
In the conference proposal we used “disease” in its older sense of “lack of physical 
comfort, tranquility, state of mind” to describe reactions of original authors and reac-
tions of readers/viewers/listeners of translations. We asserted that when turgid free verse 
and modern assumptions bury the engaging poetry of Homer, some contemporary readers 
delight in the majesty of the epic, while others see encrusted layers burying the accessi-
bility of the original—dis-ease. When a high production value music video overwhelms a 
simple blues song about a tragedy, some audiences delight in that translation, while others 
see a loss of connection—dis-ease. When a Woody Allen movie is playing with subtitles 
in another language, some viewers who understand the original sound track are laughing, 
while others not ﬂuent in English usage in comedy are mystiﬁed by the laughter—dis-
ease. When a composer sets a two-line Latin poem into a minute and a half portion of 
a cantata, some listeners hear a lovely musical piece with the same Latin words, while 
others hear the music burying the raw power of the original—disease. 
We apply our web of proximity model to cases of translation that could be argued to 
bear little resemblance to the original, in order to tease out the role of antecedents in both 
the production and perception of translation documents. Translation at its best is fraught 
with difﬁculties; “poor” translations can shroud, transform, even completely obliterate 
the author’s intended meaning. An audience might like a lovely production that actually 
obscures the original or might ﬁnd in it an entry into exploring the original. We do not 
claim to have a way of saying how much of the sense of the original ought to be preserved

4.5

91
or in what way the preservation should happen; however, our model will provoke some 
ways of thinking about the problems of preserving some sense of the original. That is to 
say, our notions of proximity and epidata—especially considerations of how antecedents 
effect expression of the data of the message and the resulting interpretation. This is not 
an attempt to lay a critical judgment on any particular translation, nor is it an attempt 
to join the fray of argument over the place of authorial intent in “proper” understanding; 
rather it is an attempt to afford another means of bringing antecedents of all participants 
in the conversation into play.

How Many More Lucias Are Out There? 
Revisiting our early example of Prometheus and Ariandne where a ball of yarn serves as a 
clue, we saw that epidata helped solve Prometheus true challenge of exiting the labyrinth 
successfully. We might consider this a microcosmic approach where epidata connects 
a single person to a single source of information and then to a functional resolution 
to a problem. Anytime information successfully solves an issue makes for a valuable 
information use. 
But what of the power of epidata on a larger scale. Historically, opera was performed 
for the wealthy and noble classes. With the opening of the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice 
in 1637, opera became accessible to the general public. At this juncture, opera subdivided 
into two camps: opera seria and opera buffa. Opera seria focused on storylines around 
myth and kings with nobility remaining as the intended audience. Typically performed 
in three acts, the duration tested many audiences. On the other hand, opera buffa was 
comedic in nature portraying everyday stories. The air of these operas was plainer and 
presented in two acts making it attractive to a wider audience. Audiences to opera require 
processing a multiplicity of stimuli including the following of the plot and observations 
of sight, sounds, props, and stage design orchestrating a world that mirrors reality. The 
productions are a quintessential blurring of reality and ﬁction. 
Since the opening of the Teatro San Cassiano, more people have had access to enjoy 
opera. Yet opera remained elusive to the masses due to limited access to opera house 
venues. Today, the most notable opera house is the Metropolitan Opera in New York 
City, which is a far cry from medium-sized cities and certainly not accessible to small 
town America. In an effort to build revenues and attract new audiences, the Metropoli-
tan Opera (The Met) debuted the Met broadcast series in December 2006 bringing opera 
to communities around the globe via satellite into movie theaters. Since 2006 the Met 
has expanded its Live in HD performances covering more productions and broadcast to a 
growing number of cinemas throughout the world. And performances are now available 
through On-demand subscription to a TV near you. Yet there remains the issue of opera

closely reﬂecting our world. The static setting of the opera classics (1600–1900s) eventu-
ally separated them from mirroring reality, distancing understanding for a mass audience 
immersed in a modern world. Proximity was stretched. 
Enter the creative complex of opera production where, recently, Australian director 
Simon Stone translated the classic Lucia di Lammermoor. This opera tragico, written in 
three acts, is clearly intended for noble and wealthy audiences of the nineteenth century. 
Stone envisioned the power of bringing to the story a contemporary ﬂair that would 
resonate with audiences today. Donizetti’s classic opera was composed in 1835 at a time 
when male honor and dignity were at the center of real life. Working with the original 
score and libretto (synchronic data), Stone reworked the sight, sound, props, and stage 
design to reframe the story metropolitan Detroit in the 2000 (diachronicity). Stone saw 
reworking the storyline as a “great opportunity to participate in that conversation and 
confront the simultaneous absurdity and danger of the idea that a man’s pride is more 
important than a woman’s life.” 
Let’s revisit epidata and its origins to get a better look at it playing out in Stone’s recre-
ation of Lucia di Lammermoor affording a more likely connection for today’s audience. 
We conceived epidata from epigenetics. Deﬁned as the study of changes in organisms 
caused by modiﬁcation of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. 
epigenetics makes changes to the genes, small or large, to modify how the original gene 
is expressed. Turning to information, we deﬁne epidata as changes in content around or 
accompanying information that modiﬁes meaning or understanding rather than alteration 
of the information itself. 
The score and libretto for Lucia di Lammermoor are just squiggles on a page, as seen 
in Fig. 4.8, until it is performed by an orchestra and vocalists (Donizetti and Cammarano, 
1992). Stone left Donizetti’s original music composition intact. He made changes to the 
setting through alterations of visual presentation. Through this translation to a modern-
day tragedy where opioids impact human behaviors and outcomes. In Stone’s production, 
he conveys a world where what life promises in youth falls short in adulthood as the 
world evolves, leaving one feeling betrayed. “…, anyone else’s feelings of betrayal or 
abuse can’t compete with his own sense of loss from the position he lived in earlier to 
where he’s landed. So, you have capitalist systems, which only care about proﬁt, abusing 
workers, who in turn become perpetrators of abuse against other members of society, 
especially women. It’s a sad, vicious cycle.” (Dobkin & Goodwin, 2022)
In both the original opera production and the 2022 Met Opera production of Lucia di 
Lammermoor, the setting conveys a grim air. True to both versions, the characters hold 
to the hope of ﬁnding happiness despite life conditions. Both opera productions convey 
an underpinning of a fading dream. Stone shares “To me, that’s the way Donizetti’s score 
sounds, as well. He creates a sense of nostalgia from the get-go—the music of fading 
dreams.” (Dobkin & Goodwin, 2022)

In review, epidata is a phenomenon that has been occurring all around us. Outside of 
the context of formal information practice (i.e., reference desk, etc.), we see the impetus 
of inﬂuence played out in the information around information. The original information 
(like Donizetti’s music score) remains unchanged. It is the surrounding information that 
is reorchestrated to impact meaning and adoption of information. For example, in the 
presidential photos of Johnson’s emergency swearing-in ceremony, what if the blood on 
Jackie Kennedy’s dress was removed? Would this change the meaning for current day 
viewers of the photo? If pictures of the outside of Airforce One on that day were shared 
alongside of the photo, would the meaning change? What if we placed all the same people, 
in the same staging, in the Oval Ofﬁce, would the meaning change?

Thinkering1 with Shannon 
Here we have in Fig. 4.9 a typical graphical representation of Shannon’s linear model of 
communication. For our purposes, we wish to relabel/reorder some of the elements while 
staying true to Shannon’s construct. We want to be talking about authored messages. 
Ordinarily these would be books, articles, videos, streaming audio ﬁles, grocery lists, and 
the like. Shannon, of course, cleaved meaning from message, concerning himself only 
with the squiggles, dots, or bits arriving at their destination just as they had begun at 
their source. Meaning cannot be derived without the message but it is not inherent in the 
message. 
We have played with layering meaning on top of the message map, as represented in 
Fig. 4.10, as a means of clarifying our notion of proximity. What if we add a layer 
of author and user—the author coding some medium with the intention of preserv-
ing/sending some meaning; the recipient decoding the message for meaning to resolve 
some issue? What if we then add a layer of all the antecedents stimulating the author 
and all the antecedents stimulating the recipient of the message? We added the notion 
of “antecedents” to account for all the stimuli on the author’s constructing the message: 
e.g., purpose, intended audience, language, facility with the chosen medium. We do the 
same for the seeker to account for similar stimuli. This might be seen as similar to the 
notion of “common ground,” in which the probability of the author’s intended meaning 
being what is decoded by the seeker increases as the number of antecedents in common 
increases. This does not necessarily mean that seekers do not/cannot use messages for 
quite different purposes than those intended by the author.

Can we say the functionality of a message that arrives just as it was sent is dependent 
on the degree of overlap between the antecedents shaping the author’s coding abilities 
and the antecedents shaping the recipient’s decoding abilities? That is, the functionality 
is inﬂuenced by the proximity that holds between the partners in the conversation or that 
which can be provided as epidata. 
We might say that second-hand knowledge—books, articles, photographs, YouTube 
videos, Twitter, and all the progeny—provides a way of being close to events we did 
not witness, to experts whom we do not know, places we have not been. Second-hand 
knowledge helps us achieve a certain nearness, an approximation of ﬁrst-hand knowledge. 
The common ground an author and a recipient/seeker do not have can be seen as noise.

Representation 
By deﬁnition, representation throws out some of the attributes of that which is being 
represented. This is often just what one wants. If this were not the case, then we would 
also have to examine entire documents as the ﬁrst stage of a search; this would be a 
signiﬁcant enlargement of search space and require inordinate amounts of search time.

How, though, are we to come to solutions when the question cannot be represented in 
system terms or at all a priori. 
The little hook between an unformulated question and some document may well be 
what is tossed out during the representation process. It may even be the case that a satis-
factory document is in hand but is rejected for want of some attribute thought necessary 
yet could be shown to be unnecessary. 
The achievement of “common ground” might well take place with common topic, 
common language, common level of education; yet it might need to be sparked by some-
thing else in common. Here we do not distinguish between ﬁnding and understanding. 
Having a document in hand that does not make sense, does not enable understanding, is 
not functional is as good as not found. 
The primary thrusts of our discussion are that the goal or result of all forms of infor-
mation seeking is be close to an authority with useful information; that a good deal of 
seeking and ﬁnding is beyond retrieval; that anything that stands in the way of useful 
information can be modeled as interference or noise; that noise is situational; and, espe-
cially, that epidata expand the possibilities of ﬁnding, understanding, and making use of 
documents.

Epilogue/Prologue 
When we ﬁrst began to write, we used the metaphor of the tree falling in the woods, 
as pictured in Fig. 4.11, with nobody there to hear it—in order to step away from the 
concept of organizational, pre-coordinate representation of documents. We asked: If a tree 
falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? This philosophical 
thought experiment has probed minds since the early 1700s 
(Berkeley and Turbayne, 
1957). Responses to the question emerged from the physical science of sound where the 
predominant thinking is that sound is the sensation excited in the ear when air or other 
medium is set in motion. The major premise in this proposition is that there must be 
a receiver (hearer) in order for sound to be present. More technically speaking, sound is 
only recognized speciﬁcally at nerve centers further emphasizing the role of the receiver to 
justify existence of sound (Scientiﬁc American, 1884). Simply put, no ears, no sound…tree 
falls in silence.
Why open with this philosophical provocation? Sound depends on some form of prox-
imity. We want to use this metaphor as a probe into notions of proximity in the woods 
and forests of the information environment. Forests and woodlands, like libraries and the 
World Wide Web, have long been places useful to humans (Fig. 4.12). Jaegels uses the 
term “close associations” and “direct connections” to describe the relationships our fore-
bears had with forests: [these] gave boatbuilders and other craftsmen of the past a kind 
of intimacy that fostered communal knowledge.” (Jaegles, 2021) This sort of intimacy is 
at the heart of our argument and our model of proximity.

We wanted, among other things, to convey the idea that much of epidata is unpre-
dictable—ought we to include in the bibliographic record for each work a caution that in 
“x” years anyone who comes across the bibliographic record ought to check with the pub-
lisher’s style manual at the time of publication for policies on gender neutral pronouns? 
How would we even predict what elements of a culture might change just enough so 
that there could be a “slight” but consequential misunderstanding? Our concept of prox-
imity and its utility hinge on fostering the sensitivity to “close associations” and “direct 
connections” enabled by epidata.

The preceding pages represent our thinking about proximity and epidata along with provo-
cations we have used to moor our thinking. Here we add a few more provocations to seed 
our ongoing conversations 
What sort of thread would link a seeker to a functional message? 
Can we see documents as conversants between situations?

What if ﬁnding and understanding/functionality are not always purposeful/intended? 
Are we in some way addressing Wilson’s assertion about accessibility? 
All the documents in the library are immediately available to me, but they are not all accessible 
to me. 
Wilson lists linguistic inaccessibility, conceptual inaccessibility, and critical inaccessibility 
(Wilson, 1977). Can we argue that notions of epidata and proximity open up awareness of 
subtleties within each of these constructs of inaccessibility that might well go undetected, 
yet render a work functionally inaccessible without the user realizing it. 
When someone is seeking documental help to solve a problem, make a decision, per-
form a function, or better understand something, they are attempting to be close to an 
authority, they are seeking proximity to ﬁrsthand knowledge. In common systems of 
document retrieval, whether pre-coordinate or post coordinate, the assumption is that a 
representation of a question state and some representations of documents run through a 
similarity engine will yield a document or set of documents equal to the seeker’s task.

What about those situations in which documents have not yet been trieved or the mean-
ing is unclear? The representations of the documents may well be constructed “properly” 
while the seeker is unclear about the question or while the seeker does not even realize 
there is a question. 
4.10
Invitation 
Epidata is the term we use for links between the antecedents of authorship and those of 
seeking to see how we might aid in the looking for the attributes, the hooks, that might 
yield ﬁnding and understanding yet are not part of the data and metadata ordinarily used 
to guide seekers. The spectrum of data, metadata, epidata is continuous; the utility of any 
portion of the spectrum to a seeker depends on the quest. 
What could count as epidata? How might one know when epidata would be useful? 
Do digital platforms enable virtual proximity? 
Can we say, then, that representing documents with subject headings or strings of key 
words or similar extra-verbal representations functions for bringing seekers and docu-
ments together for certain sorts of questions and does quite the opposite for certain sorts 
of questions. They can bring seekers into proximity with ﬁrsthand knowledge in some 
instances, yet stand in the way of proximity for others. Might it be that the smallest or 
least likely attributes of a seeker/document couplet will be of great use, precisely because 
the “obvious” attributes are of little use. 
Can we model the conversation/dance between author and seeker as the co-authorship 
of functionality? 
Can we say that proximity is polydirectional; common ground is polydirectional. 
Can we say that a focus on retrieval not enough? Since re-trieve means “to ﬁnd again,” 
it implies that what is needed has already been found. 
What are we saying? Functionality of a message hinges on more than data and 
metadata. 
What are we not saying? We are not saying we have a complete model; we have a 
metaphor to organize observations and thoughts and conversations. 
What are we not seeing? We ask you: what are we missing? We invite your input. 
Bring your clue and join the continuing conversation by email and on our forthcoming 
podcast.
