Editorial Introduction
Robin Mackay
Surveying a century in which experience has taught us 
that man is capable of inventing ever more atrocious forms 
of violence and horror, is it necessary to remark that much 
of modern thought offers little to soothe, and much to 
exacerbate our disquiet? Nietzsche famously observed that 
the psychic well-being of the human organism is predicated, 
minimally, upon a drastically partial perspective, and 
ultimately upon untruth. Human cognitive defaults continue 
to cry out against the insights which modern physics, 
cosmology, genetics, neuroscience, psychoanalysis and the 
rest seem to require us to integrate into our worldview. As 
for philosophy, it has largely replaced wonder, awe, and 
the drive to certainty with dread, anxiety and finitude. 
Moreover, despite the diverse technological wonders 
they have made possible, the modern sciences offer little 
existential respite: There is no consolation in the claim that 
(for instance) I am the contingent product of evolution, or a 
chance formation of elementary particles, or that my ‘self’ is

Such experiments are already being undertaken – not 
for the most part by philosophers, but by those working in 
literature and the arts who, drawing upon the resources of 
modern thought, have devised means by which to produce 
experiences of the conceptual upheavals characteristic of 
the post-Enlightenment age. It is the scenarios of weird 
and horror fiction, the excessive existential sufferings of 
literature, the abstract emotional engineering of sound-art 
and music, and the poetical extrapolations of artists, that 
are apt to put us in the place of individuals set loose from 
the protective envelope of consensual reality, forced to 
integrate directly the lacerating force of thoughts usually 
blunted (even­ – or, sad to say, especially – in philosophical 
discourse) by the knowledge that they are, after all, ‘only 
thoughts’. It is through them that we identify ourselves 
with tormented individuals compelled – even if only 
momentarily – to live the problem of the rational corrosion 
of our cherished self-image, to viscerally absorb thoughts 
‘whose merest mention is paralysing’ (Lovecraft).
In the twentieth century, sf, weird fiction, and horror in 
particular have furnished a laboratory for shaping narratives 
pointedly informed by the conceptual paradoxes produced 
by modern science and philosophy. And increasingly, 
philosophy itself, and the high arts which so long looked 
with disdain upon such pulp fictions, are realising with what 
anticipatory clarity these genres have formulated problem­
atics which are becoming ever more pressing, not only 
conceptually and aesthetically, but even politically (given 
what is at stake in our maintenance of a naïve, comfortable 
self-image even as the most speculative theoretical insights 
are immediately and ruthlessly operationalised throughout 
the sociopolitical and commercial spheres, from advertising 
to healthcare, from warfare to banking). 
nothing but the correlate of the activation of neurobiological 
phase-spaces. Yet mundane thought, whether through 
obstinacy or inertia, maintains its stubborn course 
regardless, as if oblivious to their consequences, or at 
most allowing them to subsist at a safely delimited, solely 
theoretical level. 
What if, prising the more disturbing elements of modern 
thought loose from their comfortable framing as part of an 
intellectual canon, we were to become fully attentive to 
their most harrowing consequences? What if, impatient 
with a consideration of their claims solely from the point 
of view of their explanatory power and formal consistency, 
we yielded to the (perhaps ‘unphilosophical’) temptation 
to experiment with their potentially corrosive effects upon 
lived experience? If the overriding affect connected with 
what we ‘know’ ­– but still do not really know ­– about the 
universe and our place in it, would be one of horror, then, 
inversely, how might the existing literature of horror inform 
a reading of these tendencies of contemporary thought? 
These are some of the questions with which this 
volume of Collapse sets out to grapple, imagining for a 
moment a philosophy absolved of humanistic responsibili­
ties, devoting itself to the experimental marshalling of all 
possible resources in the service of a transformation that 
would no longer be circumscribed within the bounds of the 
purely theoretical, and thus striking an alliance with those 
affects which, for the most part elided, nonetheless haunt 
philosophical thought like its very shadow. A philosophy, 
then, bound to experiment with the employment of horror, 
that its insights might begin slowly but effectively to erode 
anthropic automatism.

commonplace ­– the Zoroastrian concept of druj as 
xenophobia turned inward. However, in order for horror 
to flower, he emphasises, another element is necessary – 
a thoroughgoing materialism, in which the knowledge 
of non-apparent conceptual distinction ­– the sensitivity 
towards hidden otherness – is prevented from diffusing into 
mysticism: The very birth, one might say, of the distinction 
between philosophy and religion, is also the birth of horror. 
It is this compaction, suggests Sieg, which finally blocks all 
exit from a self-referential universe pregnant with horror 
and yet (or precisely because it is) entirely rational ­– a 
universe in which the innocent victim is defenceless before 
the monstrous knowledge which invades them.
In his contribution Eugene Thacker details how 
theology has, nevertheless, maintained a consistent historical 
relation to horror. His ‘Nine Disputations on Theology and 
Horror’ examines the extent to which the concept of ‘life’ 
owes its integrity to an immanent ‘after-life’ which is the 
proper object of horror. If life is defined by a duplicity ­– the 
distinction between the living being and life ‘itself’ – then, 
according to Thacker’s historical survey of the ‘teratological 
noosphere’, in the undertow of the questioning of life we 
always find changing conceptualizations of afterlife, whose 
horrific avatars are so many embodiments (or disembodi­
ments) of this problematic duplicity. They provide us with 
a handle on a fundamental question of biopolitics in its 
varying historical forms: The suppression of the after-life 
immanent to life, whose horror reveals that which is already 
there prior to individual lives, the anonymous Levinasian 
‘there is’ which, Thacker argues, is ‘a point of attraction 
for ontology’ – in Thacker’s coinage, a ‘nouminous’ (both 
noumenal and numinous) life. However as Thacker’s 
‘disputations’ deepen, the ‘always-receding horizon’ of the 
Given this discursive intersection between the attempt 
to rethink reality through contemporary science and 
philosophy, and the tropes of the horror ‘genre’, then, 
there is a certain logic in examining together conceptual 
armature and artistic dramatisation. It was this double-
edged approach that we decided to take in the present 
volume, by bringing together contributions from authors 
of weird fiction, artists, and philosophers­ – only to discover 
ourselves vindicated by the impossibility of determining 
where the concept ends and the horror begins. The theme 
thus presented an opportunity to bring more fully to fruition 
Collapse’s vision of an integration of elements originating 
from very different spheres, mutually catalysing so as to 
produce a series of conceptual ‘interzones’. 
George Sieg’s contribution ably demonstrates how, in 
examining the nature of horror as an affect, a rich inter­
section of cognitive, conceptual, existential and political 
stakes comes into view. Firstly, unlike the essentially animal 
responses of fear and terror, horror attaches especially to 
the conceptual abstraction and reflexivity attendant upon 
self-consciousness ­– which is as much as to say that homo 
philosophicus is defined by a capacity for feeling horror. As 
Sieg argues, horror is characterised more through its victims 
than through its predators, and the victim’s itinerary is 
always that from innocence to knowledge. Corollary to this 
is the impossibility of flight to a ‘critical’ position on horror, 
since it is ‘always already’ (even such hoary philosophical 
locutions reveal a menacing aspect here …) the horror of 
knowing horror ­– whence Sieg’s characterisation of horror 
as peculiarly ‘gnostic’ (thus introducing a recurrent theme 
of this volume).
Sieg locates the historical kernel of horror in 
the endotropic amplification of an anthropological

Graham Harman’s emblematic invocation of ‘the 
electrons that form the pulpy torso of Great Cthulhu’ 
reminds us that the hard-nosed materialism that is a 
prerequisite for the emergence of horror finds its equally 
necessary counterpart in the polysemic qualifier ‘pulp’. 
Historically describing the re-formed, low-grade paper used 
to manufacture magazines carrying what was, and to some 
extent still is, considered low-grade and derivative literature, 
including fantastic fiction and comics, ‘pulp’ came to apply 
also to the latter’s supposedly ‘generic’ nature. More than 
coincidentally, it also sits well with what China Miéville 
nominates, in his contribution, the ‘new (Weird) haptic’ – 
a certain ‘palpability’ associated with horror and whose 
avatar, Miéville proposes, is that exemplarily ‘formless’ 
creature, the octopus ­– le poulpe. Himself a contemporary 
giant of weird fiction, and an unashamed champion of 
pulp, in his essay Miéville clearly demonstrates that an 
attentive reading of the history of the fantastic underpins 
his fiction. He undertakes to extract from their various 
historical combinations and scissions the two currents of 
the weird and the ‘hauntological’. Taking the ‘skulltopus’ 
and its ‘extreme rarity […] in culture’ as an indicator that 
the coexistence of the two genres makes them no less 
inviolably distinct, Miéville argues that, if the rise of the 
weird belongs to ‘crisis-blasted modernity’ – the enlighten­
ment become dark ­– and if in contemporary capitalism we 
live the weird, we are also haunted by ghosts of futures that 
never happened: the superposed temporalities of the genres 
expressing the tensions of post-modernity.
Disabusing us of any suspicion that the link between 
horror and philosophical thought is a purely modern 
invention, Reza Negarestani’s contribution recounts 
concept of life leads him to a more radical consideration of 
‘life as non-being’, or the horror of ‘life-without-Being’.
In their ‘Czech Forest’ cycle, Prague artist collective 
Rafani take an oblique approach to confronting a horrifying 
episode in their national history. Although at their birth 
Rafani announced themselves through overtly political 
manifestos, by addressing this suppressed event through a 
reappropriation of folk art, ‘Czech Forest’ displays a keen 
ability to navigate the borders of the political, the mythical 
and the aesthetic. In doing so, it adds a supplement to George 
Sieg’s argument that horror has its roots in xenophobia and 
the fear of the ‘enemy within’.
At the end of the Second World War, Czech inhabitants 
of the now-liberated Sudetenland turned on neighbouring 
Germans, whose families in some cases had inhabited the 
forest region for over a century, and drove them out with 
vengeful ferocity. The slogans reproduced in Rafani’s iconic 
images (from the ‘Unofficial Decalogue of Czech Soldiers 
in the Borderland’, a propaganda handbook published 
at the time) demonstrate starkly enough how this trium­
phalist convulsion relayed the horrors suffered under 
occupation, revisiting them once more upon the innocent. 
But the ‘Czech forest’ of the title also conducts a deeper 
current: the Forest, as fairy-tale locus of darkness, where 
children get lost, monsters lurk, and, at dusk, branch and 
leaf become menacingly animate. By subtly adapting the 
folk-art-inspired woodcuts that often illustrate such tales, 
Rafani’s work connects the transmutation of the rage of the 
oppressed into xenophobic hatred, with the mythopoetic 
roots of fear, thus transforming the story from national 
history into psychogeographical fable of horror: it becomes 
a reminder of what lurks beneath the comfort of homeliness, 
and of the horror of the internal other.

a retrospective ‘blackening’ of the history of differential 
calculus he associates with it: for ‘what could be worse for 
vitalism than at once being animated through a necrophilic 
alliance, and simultaneously, protected under the aegis of 
the void’?
The work of Jake and Dinos Chapman has continually 
toyed with the cohabitation of horror and laughter, 
employing the debasement of form and image as a weapon 
against moral self-certainty. Proof of concept in this respect 
was achieved in their (2004) ‘improvement’ of Goya’s 
famous Disasters of War through ‘rectifications’ that yanked 
the atrocity-victims into a cruelly absurd cartoon universe 
that addressed the viewer far more intensely and disqui­
etingly than the ‘originals’ with their patina of historical 
didacticism and art-historical legitimation. 
In the drawings they contribute to our volume, the 
Chapman brothers continue a preoccupation with the 
uncannily vacant images of the children’s colouring book 
(see e.g. Gigantic Fun [2000], My Giant Colouring Book [2004]). 
In I Can See, vulgarised Bataillean themes vie with the 
vacant potency of stereotyped simulacra reproduced for 
juvenile consumption; the comically brutal irruption into 
these adumbrated banalities of fragments of body-horror, 
and an insidious cross-breeding with the Chapmans’ own 
stock of cartoon atrocities, engenders a menacing air of 
inanity that resists easy decipherment. The artists’ program­
matic impoverishments, testing the limit at which the image 
will cease to conduct the craving for improvement, might 
be read in the light of Negarestani’s Aristotelian arithmetic 
­as a willed acceleration of the putrefaction of the form of 
art, an iterative process of decay which, however, only ever 
momentarily disturbs the veneration of ‘what remains’. 
how a certain hideously ingenious torture was no sooner 
historically recorded than its most gruesome details were 
employed as a conceptual resource for philosophical 
meditation.  Building on a fragment from a lost work by 
Aristotle, ‘The Corpse Bride’ launches a necrophilic inves­
tigation into the idea of ontology as a system of metaphys­
ical cruelty which reveals vitalism to be a ‘farce’ played out 
among the remains of the already-dead. 
In imbuing a famous Etruscan torture with universal 
pertinence, Negarestani’s Aristotle becomes a prophet 
of terror, insistent that any intelligible ontology as such 
mobilises non-belonging (or nothing) through the agency 
of a chain of putrefactory ratios or problematic intimacies 
with the dead. Aristotle assimilates the bond between soul 
and body with the bond between corpse and living victim, 
wherein only the differential layer of blackening or nigredo 
can properly be called ‘life’. Yet in Negarestani’s argument, 
even this chemistry of horror is only a preface to a deeper 
bond with the void which Aristotle seeks to dissimulate. 
The final twist in Negarestani’s investigation, in which the 
glorification of negativity or the subtractive mobilization of 
non-belonging (Badiou, Zizek, et al.) is revealed as an implicit 
and unconditional affirmation of the radically exterior, 
adds new and macabre detail to his previous Collapse 
essays on absolute exteriority and ‘affordance’: survival 
becomes an art of living with the dead, of maintaining a 
ratio of intensive decay to extensive putrefaction, of abiding 
in nigredo. 
What follows from Negarestani’s probing of the 
problematic conjunction of nekrous and philia, the dead and 
the essence of affirmation, reads like a thoroughly perverse 
twisting of Deleuze’s dialectic of problem and solution, and

The poems record moments when the obtuse momentum 
of life draws it momentarily into proximity with the indif­
ference of the universe; they offer no affirmation, no 
redemption, but only an icy clarity, a kind of conciliation 
with this indifference. The most innocuous spaces of the 
everyday (‘the insides of cupboards’) become abysmal 
revelations, whilst the empty repetitions of life reveal time 
as an implacable horror of merciless recurrence ‘every day, 
until the end of the world’. 
In his reading of the work of Thomas Ligotti – one of 
the foremost contemporary exponents of weird fiction – in 
tandem with the neurophilosophy of Thomas Metzinger, 
James Trafford argues that the horrifying travails of 
Ligotti’s protagonists give phenomenological expression to 
insights anticipating those presented in Metzinger’s extraor­
dinary treatise Being No-One. The latter includes explicitly 
as one of its goals the achievement of a theory that can be 
‘culturally integrated’;2 Trafford’s suggestion is that such 
an integration may imply a passage through horrors similar 
to those described – and generated ­– by Ligotti’s singularly 
suffocating tales.
Metzinger’s central contention is that the apparent 
immediacy 
or 
transparency 
of 
phenomenological 
appearances owes itself to an instrumental miscogni­
tion: transparency is in fact a ‘special form of darkness’. 
Ligotti’s fiction, premissed upon the catastrophic undoing 
of this miscognition, this protective opacity, documents the 
experience of the unravelling of selfhood.
Sieg argues that the monster is a less indispensable 
element of the horror genre than the victim, and it is the 
victims in Ligotti’s fictions, in their plumbing of the depths 
2. T. Metzinger, Being No One: The Self-Model Theory of Subjectivity (London: MIT Press, 
2004).
The Chapmans’ extended practical joke on the art-world 
continually subverts any anticipation that a work should 
supply abreactive or cathartic moral reinforcement through 
didactically-framed images (‘eye-care’?). Instead it invites a 
jarring and problematic convulsion, an irresolvable horror 
vacui. 
If Lovecraft’s name resounds throughout this volume, 
making several of his tales ‘required reading’ for the 
collected articles, it often does so through the filter of 
another work. Hardly a work of ‘secondary literature’ 
­– despite its biographical form, it is more of a passionate 
affirmation and exacerbation of Lovecraft’s great themes 
– Michel Houellebecq’s H.P.Lovecraft: Against the World, 
Against Life1 is one of the few studies to successfully explore 
the singular qualities of Lovecraft’s work. And, as little as 
it may seem evident at first, reading Houellebecq’s own 
work through his appreciation for Lovecraft reveals a 
profound influence. Houellebecq’s characters too live out 
the ‘unlivable’, encountering in heightened form the cosmic 
horrors which modern society simultaneously unleashes 
and suppresses; they are individuals who have taken into 
their very soul the full weight of what we know about our 
universe and our place within it. Yet unlike Lovecraft’s 
doomed heroes, for the most part Houellebecq’s remain 
trapped within the banal everyday: with no respite even 
through the negative transcendence of madness, the 
world becomes a relentless trial, its everyday rituals and 
objects beacons of desolate horror. Houellebecq’s poems 
– a selection of which we are delighted to include in this 
volume translated into English for the first time – distil his 
powerful vision into translucid moments of dread certainty.

to think without thinking horror. Ligotti rightly locates the 
interest of this programme less in its conceptual innovation 
than in its audacious defiance of the snares of rhetoric and 
the delights of intellectual sophistication. For, rather than 
reason, is it not these latter passions which govern more 
‘sophisticated’ philosophical architectonics, and in doing so 
obscure the conceptual vistas that might open up to those 
brave or foolhardy enough to interrogate philosophically the 
‘taboo commonplaces’ which they superciliously outlaw?3 
For Ligotti, though, perhaps even such interrogations risk 
tainting the crystalline clarity of thinkers such as Zapffe and 
Mainländer, for whom the real question swiftly becomes 
a practical one – in a reprise of the Gnostic abhorrence of 
nature and will-to-extinction. 
One might of course argue that, even in writing, such 
thinkers, and Ligotti himself, yield to the tide of life. Even 
the will to know, to think, and to write, may itself be a 
sublimated form of the not knowing that is crucial to survival. 
But if thinking and writing can themselves be sources of 
distraction, a thinking and writing of ‘concept horror’ 
attempts to force the reader to secrete something of the 
poison that is buried within them; it is a kind of demonic 
invocation. No less than his fictions, Ligotti’s straightfor­
ward account of our ‘malignant uselessness’ succeeds in so 
far as its language ­– like that of Lovecraft’s eldritch incanta­
tions – ceases to be representational and begins to summon 
the very desolate reality it describes, doing away with all 
cultivated distance and calm objectivity. Ligotti counsels 
precisely this surreptitious promotion of disillusionment, to 
be carried out patiently by those in every age to whom it 
3. A rare and fine example of such a dispassionate experiment in nihilism is Ray 
Brassier’s recently published Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction 
(Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2007). (See also ‘The Enigma of Realism’ in Collapse II, 
15-54.)
of a ‘spinning abyss’ (recalling the ‘layers within layers 
of horrific depravity’ revealed to Sieg’s gnostics) that 
Trafford sees as revealing the dark truth of Metzinger’s 
‘nemocentrism’.
In his own contribution, Thomas Ligotti demon­
strates that not only is self-consciousness a precondition 
for horror, the two are inextricable. ‘Thinking Horror’ is 
thus a pleonasm: the new epoch heralded by the dawn of 
self-consciousness is characterized by the production of 
‘horrors [and] flagrantly joyless possibilities’ and ­– swiftly 
ensuing ­– the erection of psychic defences against truth, 
either explicit, socialised, or in the form of commonplace 
ironies and homely platitudes (‘being alive is okay’).
If Ligotti’s fictions represent so many twisted descents 
into the void, here it is offered to us neat, in the manner of 
a classic, if unhinged, essayist, and with a certain humour 
indissociable from such dismal truths. Eschewing any 
orientation of his position according to the standard co-or­
dinates of a philosophical orthodoxy, Ligotti introduces 
us to the obscure figures who form his secret lineage of 
pessimism, and invents a pulp philosophy at once bracing 
for its brutal honesty and perversely enjoyable for its 
mordant wit.
Whilst much contemporary thought remains doggedly 
committed to continuing the perennial philosophical battle 
against mechanism and determinism, focusing increasingly 
sophisticated conceptual resources on the characterisation of 
‘singularities’ or ‘events’, Ligotti aligns himself, against ‘the 
crushing majority of philosophers’, with a pessimistic creed 
which, refusing to imprudently postulate such exceptions, 
instead assigns itself the sole task of outlining the futility of 
man’s lot and the comical details of his desperate attempts

commemorative discourses in which his own work is 
destined to be preserved as cultural mausolea, even as he 
promotes the simultaneous fascination and horror that the 
mummified object, in its living death, evokes. 
The alternately accusing and mutely questioning faces 
of the dead monkeys describe a strange twisting associative 
dance with Ligotti’s text, the nuances of dumb bewilder­
ment and silent petition inviting us to identify ourselves 
simultaneously with Kulik’s photographic subjects and the 
hapless, self-deluding targets of Ligotti’s rant. A deeply felt 
unease, and the troubled laughter that accompanies it, is the 
inevitable initial response to this marriage of text and image. 
But ironically, read within the context of Kulik’s work, 
‘Memento Mori’ obliquely hints at an egress from Ligotti’s 
dead end. For Kulik’s performances seek a zoophrenic 
overcoming of the limitations of the anthropic through a 
plunging into the animal. The involvement of ‘the point of 
view of different biological species in aesthetic practice,’ the 
artist proposes, ‘will produce a new renaissance’6 – Since 
the anthropomorphisation of the animal can only subject 
it to a further death, we should rather zoomorphise the human. 
This strategy of a ‘forward-to-nature’7 zoofuturism implies 
that escape from ‘the crisis of human schizophrenic culture’8 
might involve intimacy with a horror that walks on four 
legs – a horror that has left its teeth-marks on witnesses 
to Kulik’s uncompromising and profoundly disturbing 
animal-becomings.

falls to carry on the bad work, hastening the dissolution of 
the horrors of consciousness and life, and returning us to 
the void.
Ligotti’s text appears in our volume alongside a series 
of photographs by Oleg Kulik, a Russian artist whose 
work includes photography and photoassemblage but 
which culminates in his extraordinary live actions.4 One 
of the first artists from post-Soviet Russia to have garnered 
international attention, Kulik’s work thematises the porous 
boundary between animal and human (a tendency which 
reached its infamous apex in ‘Dog House’ [1996] when, 
exhibiting himself as a chained canine, Kulik was arrested 
for physically harming and mentally traumatising members 
of the public who flouted the warning to ‘beware of the 
dog’). As well as extending Kulik’s researches into what 
Mila Bredikhina has called ‘zoophrenia’,5 Kulik’s ‘Memento 
Mori’ complexifies the dialectic of life and death, presenting 
us with images of creatures who are doubly dead – 
already corpses, their deaths have been preserved through 
interment in a museum. Of course, we still cannot help 
reading their visages as anthropomorphic signifiers, now 
all the more macabre. Evincing all the stuffed-shirt dignity 
of victorian portraiture, the photographs could also be 
read as an extended ‘family tree’ – an ancestral archive we 
might prefer to keep in the closet. Not only do they act as 
‘memento mori’, reminding us of the horror of personal 
death; they also remind us, as does Ligotti, of the senseless 
and indifferent continuum of life of which we are an insig­
nificant part, and of the absurd folly of our enshrining 
any part of it, stuffed and preserved, for posterity. 
Perhaps Kulik thus identifies in advance the museums and

Meillassoux presents us here with a foretaste of what 
he will develop of a divinology, in rupture with the very 
couplet a/theism. But if the question for the bereaved is 
then no longer that of having enough time to mourn, but 
of what type of time, then, glancing forward to Benjamin 
Noys’ reading of Lovecraft’s conception of time, we might 
wonder whether the god who is to come, but whose arrival 
depends upon a lawless ‘hyperchaos’, is not destined to visit 
upon its devotees a ‘Horror Temporis’ more terrible still than 
the dilemma from which it frees them. Inspired by Meillas­
soux’s conception of ‘absolute time’, Noys suggests that, if 
(as Harman argues) the comparison between Lovecraft and 
Kant does not hold good, at least one affinity between them 
may yet be attested: in the introduction into weird fiction 
of the affect corresponding to the ‘empty form of time’. 
Time, released from its anthropocentric cycles, becomes 
unhinged and threatening in its indifference to humanity; 
fully purified, as in Meillassoux, of sufficient reason, it 
implies a ‘suspension of natural laws’. Invoking the ‘arche-
fossil’ as emblem of cosmic temporal disquiet, Noys notes 
that the Meillassouxian universe, freed from the yoke of the 
Principle of Sufficient Reason by a time whose vicissitudes 
are not even ameliorated by lawfulness, carries the Love­
craftian implication of a ‘material “outside” responding to 
no law’, a truly ‘unmasterable’ god – it is the universe of 
Azathothic materialism, releasing us ‘into the experience of the 
horror of […] the seething vortex of time’. And, as we know, 
those of Lovecraft’s protagonists who fall under the eldritch 
shadow of beings hailing from this ‘outside’, far from finding 
their hope replenished, finish traumatised and deranged. 
Given the trajectory of  ‘irrealism’ which accompanies the 
discovery of horror temporis, Noys concludes fittingly by 
showing how Peaslee’s ‘researches’, unsatisfactorily abridged 
wholly different, rationalist, antidote to despair. In previous 
contributions, Meillassoux presented his thesis of ‘absolute 
time’ or ‘the necessity of contingency’, founded upon a 
re-examination of Hume’s problem.9 In ‘Spectral Dilemma’, 
he unveils the ethical consequences of the position, 
introducing the conception of the ‘virtual god’ that lies at 
the heart of the philosophical system to which the acclaimed 
After Finitude10 – although a significant intervention in its 
own right – is a prolegomena. In his meditation on irre­
mediable bereavement, Meillassoux asks, with regard both 
to the spectres of those whose loss is personal to us, and 
to those belonging to the atrocities of the last century and 
which seemingly cannot be dispelled, how it is possible to 
escape the shadow of such deaths, thus to hope once more. 
Meillassoux’s answer to this question will surprise many, 
but undoubtedly constitutes a consistent development 
from his central philosophical contentions. Identifying the 
dilemma presented by the theist and atheist responses to 
the demands of ‘essential mourning’ – namely, that one 
must hope something for the dead, but that any existing 
god, having to be held responsible for their sufferings, can 
only be the object of horror and repugnance rather than 
veneration ­– Meillassoux shows that the ‘impossible’ concil­
iation of the parties must be sought through a thinking of 
the divine character of inexistence, which is further expanded 
into a very particular modal thesis, revealing the solution 
to the ‘spectral dilemma’ to be a formal counterpart to the 
speculative-rational solution of Hume’s problem.

impure, and evidently in the process either of coagulation or

Quite apart from the general ineptitude attacked by

finesse in denouncing as ‘continental science fiction’ the 
work of Iain Hamilton Grant, who his readers will 
know as the foremost exponent of steampunk materialism,13 
but who has latterly become ­– judging by his more recent 
works’ protracted descent into what he has described as 
‘the nuclear night of the unthinged’14 – chief scribe of idealist 
horror. In his essay on Lorenz Oken, which accompanies 
Todosch’s drawings, Grant adds an extraordinary coda to 
the powerful case put in his recent book15 for the contem­
porary importance of a philosophy of nature. 
As anticipated in Grant’s earlier account in Collapse16 
of the necessarily speculative form of its central problem 
– that of accounting for its own possibility qua natural 
production – the chief horror of naturephilosophy is that 
of an evacuation of the ‘comfort zone of interiority’.17  If 
‘the Idea is exterior to the thinking, the thinking is exterior 
to the thinker, and the thinker is exterior to the nature that 
produced it’, then naturephilosophy’s vocation, in the shape 
of thinking the production of thought, is to turn ‘us’ inside

German artist Todosch11 (whose work, like that of 
Oleg Kulik, has involved an uncanny intimacy with the

‘Hundetunnel’ project in Chicago,12 involved implanting

seems to invite myths and/or rationalisations whilst simulta­

great public inconvenience and stress-testing public reaction

strange objects (cute pokemon-like critters that turn out to 
have been carved from Carrera marble) like fetishes of a 
classical alien culture? A part of their disarraying force, and 
the irresistible desire to quell it with some narrative, results 
from a forced confrontation with the brute materiality of the 
heterogeneous matter that surrounds us but whose opacity 
and intractability are systematically suppressed through 
commodification and habituation. Refusing to make it serve

reasserting its ‘comfort zone’ through some neo-Fichtean 
subordination of the natural conditions of thought (irrecov­
erably ­– indeed horrifically – excessive for thought itself) 
to a pacificatory illusion of self-knowledge, and a  resub­
ordination of physics to ethics? In reasserting the need 
for a (necessarily speculative) account of nature to revoke 
Kant’s ‘daring act of reason’ which ineluctably peters out 
into the ‘ethical process’, Grant selects the model in which 
naturephilosophy’s science-fictional credentials are most 
ostentatiously paraded ­– Lorenz Oken’s monstrous (in 
size as in content) account of the natural generation of the 
universe.
In pursuing the ultimate ground of nature on the basis 
that the whole of nature is involved in each part, Oken 
characterises what Thacker described as the immanent 
‘after-life’ of life as a universal Ur-slime [Urschliem]. But since 
each successive sphere of nature constitutes an appearance 
of ‘something from nothing’, then that ‘nothing’ appears 
as another element in the naturephilosophical system: 
Ur-slime and Zero, mucus and matheme, are thus pitted 
against each other as true genetic elements of nature. Grant’s 
negotiation of Oken’s twisted dialectic of Zero, the ‘sink’ 
at the ‘core’ of existence, and Slime as its ‘oozing ground’, 
ends in the affirmation of an ‘ontological queasiness’ that 
cannot be ceded to the hygienic instinct. In a conclusion 
which demonstrates the capacity of naturephilosophy to 
offer new and profound readings of contemporary philo­
sophical problems ­– in this case that of Badiou’s mobilisa­
tion of a dialectic of ‘animal’ and ‘number’ against Deleuze 
– Grant argues that the impossibility of abstracting away 
‘the shock of the objective world’ means that there can be 
no ‘slime-free matheme’ unless via a unilateral assertion of 
out, in the process making it impossible ‘for anyone to 
recognise themselves in the production of their thoughts’.18 
This is accompanied, too, by an unpleasant community with 
the lower orders, far beyond zoophrenia (and even within 
the individual ­– in Oken’s theory of recapitulation the body 
becomes an infolded horror in which the head is a spine, 
the jaws and teeth deterritorialized limbs and nails ...).
Since a universe where even thought is a natural 
production, its ‘content’ thus having no necessary purchase 
on that production, is indeed something ‘very difficult to 
imagine’,19 we might say that a successful naturephilosophy 
would be a kind of forcible manipulation of the imagination; 
that it must appear in the form of a literally mind-bending 
speculative science/fiction and a brutal dismemberment 
of the body of representational thinking, relegating the 
Kantian a priori to a mere natural-historical prius, thought 
being separated from its conditions not by some absolutised 
transcendental membrane but by an asymmetry in the 
time of production.20 Naturephilosophy thus provides the 
formal schema for precisely that negation of the ‘insularity 
of transcendental subjectivity’ which (as Trafford argues) 
is harboured by the neuroscientific viewpoint and which 
afflicts Ligotti’s tormented protagonists.
If this gives us permission to speak of naturephilosophy 
as a kind of intellectual self-harm, an auto-horrification, 
Grant insists that against its ‘better judgement’, contem­
porary philosophy must indeed inflict this harm upon 
itself once again. Does post-Kantian philosophy, he asks, 
bowed by the blows of naturalism, dare escape the ‘trap’ of

superficial preoccupations with death and violence lie more 
real and more profound depths of horror, distributed social-
existential complexes rather than personal pathologies. 
Seen in the light of Shearer’s other work – for instance, 
his archive of thousands of eBay photographs that uninten­
tionally afford glimpses into metalheads’ home lives – the 
evident absurdity of the Poems’ unremitting nihilism, the 
distance between such extremity and ‘real life’, becomes 
an index of isolation and of the psychic torment of sociali­
sation, showing how the metalhead’s absolute ‘no’ to life 
anchors them against their inevitable concession to the 
tepid homeliness of ‘reality’.
In their painstakingly hand-drawn form, the Poems 
have been exhibited both in galleries and in public spaces 
­– Notably, during the 2006 Berlin Biennial, on the flank 
of an eight-storey building (see p. 322). Thus transformed, 
they invite a little of the negative sublime unapologetically 
celebrated by this subculture into the overlit, overfinanced 
spaces of the contemporary arts whose executives once 
told Shearer (as documented in Sorry Steve [1999]): ‘when 
we talk about celebrating cultural diversity, we don’t mean 
yours’.21 It is through a sort of sociological alchemy that 
Shearer distils and recombines – so they can no longer be 
overlooked – the potent elements of what Lovecraft might 
have called a shoggoth-culture, with all the class associations 
implied in this (one of Shearer’s favourite epithets for his 
works is ‘lumpen’). Shearer’s poetic invocations also echo 
those of Lovecraft, who considered his task to be to excite 
a physiological response in his readers. Again, like the 
famously overdone Lovecraftian prose ­– itself frequently

Gallery/Powerplant, 2007).
the impossibility of a philosophy of nature – which would 
be simply to blanch squeamishly at that twisting, oozing 
process which is thinking (or being thought by) nature.
Using the search-engine as a stratigraphical probe to 
sample the online collective unconscious, artist Steven 
Shearer assembles vast archives (sometimes partially 
exhibited as works in their own right) recording otherwise 
uncelebrated cultural and social formations, including in 
particular the young fans who draw sustenance from the 
hyperenergetic musical genre of death metal. The Poems 
series (2001–present) draws upon an extensive archive of 
death metal band and song names, evidence of the genre’s 
unremitting quest to make the cutting edges of language 
coincide with the violence of its sonic bombardment. 
Resynthesising the archive material to create a hysterical 
cycle of disturbing, fantastical, and absurd narratives and 
imagery, Shearer’s well-honed method of selection yields 
a striking and consistent objective cross-section of this 
cultural matter.
Although the relentless, hysterical fervour of the Poems 
is certainly amusing at times, Shearer’s work never stoops 
to ironic condescension. Like the lambent depictions of 
longhaired fans in his glowering Munch-like paintings, or 
in portraits which make of the humble biro an old-mas­
terly instrument, the Poems are imbued with a sensitivity 
to a collective existential quandary whose inhabitants 
seek to anchor themselves to the most extreme point of 
reference in a world of demonstrable mediocrity. And as 
Shearer’s Poems forcibly and prolongedly hold the viewer’s 
gaze captive at the point where language is flattened out 
into a continuous and impassive appeal to what it can’t say, 
his work rediscovers this extreme point. Beyond the lyrics’

Reading the persistent poring of phenomenological 
description over its object against Lovecraft’s circumlocu­
tory evocations of the unspeakable, Harman discovers – 
like Negarestani – that ‘real objects taunt us with endless 
withdrawal’. The probing of a disconnection between 
the ‘excessive presence’ of intentional objects and the 
withdrawing correlate that binds their qualities is the motor 
of both phenomenology and horror – As Miéville argues, 
the weird and the horrific are always palpable, but their 
pulpy flesh ultimately always escapes our grasp. What 
appears at first to be a mere similarity between literary 
style and philosophical programme reveals, according to 
Harman, a common strategy for intuiting this faultline in 
the object, this ‘weird tension in […] phenomena’.
Kristen Alvanson’s contribution presents us with a 
deformation produced in thought in its ongoing struggle 
to encompass the horror of nature’s indifference to its clas­
sificatory desires. Her Arbor Deformia is a cross-section of a 
discursive phylum, the product of the baffled internal forces 
and tendencies of reason.
Images such as those in Alvanson’s contribution ­(not 
least the fearsome ‘spider-goat’ [p. 366], whose branch in 
the Arbor surely neighbours that of Miéville’s ‘skulltopus’) 
have always been the object of simultaneous fascination 
and repulsion. Her photographs capture unfortunate 
creatures in already preserved form, as ‘doubly-dead’ as 
Kulik’s monkeys; all-too familiar, but so repugnant as to 
oblige us to a discursive dissociation. As she notes, they 
therefore seem to breed conceptual monstrosities, out-of-
control taxonomical systems as deranged as the beings they 
are designed to corral into rational discourse. The Arbor 
Deformia, integrating the biological and taxonomical levels 
verging on the comical or hysterical ­– the Poems obsessively 
invoke or engender, rather than merely describing, the 
objectless cosmic horror that inhabits every thinking being 
– the non-sense that ungrounds sense – but which some, by 
force of circumstance, are closer to than others, so that they 
may even cherish the secret of its constant closeness as a 
source of psychic sustenance.
‘On the Horror of Phenomenology’ finds Graham 
Harman arguing, against a certain normative notion of 
philosophical ‘maturity’, in favour of the demonstrable and 
necessary weirdness of philosophy. Turning to Husserl’s 
phenomenology as a test case, Harman suggests that 
reading its insistence on the excessiveness of intentional 
objects against Lovecraft’s descriptive delirium might 
provide some pointers towards the type of ‘weird realism’ 
he advocates. 
Problematising a Kantian reading of Lovecraft, Harman 
concurs with Miéville that a hallmark of weird writing  is that 
it takes on the ‘unspeakable’ with an ‘excess of specificity’ in 
description; adding that, rather than suggesting a noumenal 
‘backworld’, this is the excess of a phenomenal realm 
pregnant with the menace of ‘malignant beings’ which are 
threatening precisely in so far as they stalk the very same 
web of experience whose threads we too clamber along, 
attempting to ignore their more ominous vibrations.
Using literature’s manufacture of unassimilable and 
inexhaustible objects as a model for the production of phil­
osophical concepts, Harman insists that the latter’s excess 
over any definition makes them, too, excessive phenomena, 
intentional objects whose properties can never be exhaus­
tively enumerated ­– precisely the model proposed by 
Husserl’s sensitive and meticulous phenomenology.

of this twofold teratologism, gives an inventive graphical 
solution to the twisted logics of Paré’s sixteenth-century 
classifications.
It is not only Miéville’s essay, whose very title exhibits 
the combinatorial dis-ease it discusses, that vindicates this 
thesis according to which, when reason turns its classifica­
tory attentions toward monsters, taxonomy itself tends to 
become diseased and monstrous; in fact, Alvanson’s work 
seems a fitting coda to the entire volume in its affirmation 
that one does not bring the concept to bear on horror 
without horror simultaneously investing the conceptual.
We would like to offer our sincere thanks to all of 
our contributors for their work and commitment, and 
for having collaborated so willingly in our experiment in 
concept-horror. Their enthusiasm and generosity has made 
possible a volume whose diversity and wealth of conceptual 
interconnections this brief overview has only been able to

with our subtitle – provide inspiration both for further 
philosophical research, and for further development in 
the shape of literary and artistic creations fit to assemble 
philosophical ideas into machines for effective deterritori­
alization, whether it be through the ‘experiential gnosis of 
horror’, ‘multiple fraud’, ‘zoophrenia’, ‘mental experiment’, 
‘neurotechnology’, the ‘shock of the objective’, ‘molecular 
disembowelment’, ‘necrophilic reason’, the ‘furtive broad­
casting of disillusionment’ or even, in the last resort, through 
‘purely medical means’ … Let the horrors commence.

	Aversion to stimuli of fear or terror, whether personal or 
cultural, offers no great mystery beyond the psychological. 
Neither does the pattern of habituation and desensitiza­
tion  resulting from levels of fear and terror sufficient only 
to gradually bore the mind and senses. Similarly straight­
forward is the pattern of trauma, burnout, and malady 
proceeding from constant and unremitting over-exposure 
to stimuli producing anxiety and stress. These phenomena, 
while intriguing to the scholar of behaviour and cognition, 
offer nothing to compete with the philosophical fascination 
engendered by contemplation of their weirder sister, 
Horror. She presides over a genre of art which violates 
boundaries of medium as surely as she violates the precon­
ceptions of those who apprehend her; yet she shares her 
imageries, even her key signs and signifiers, with genres 
which would seem at first examination to be quite distinct.

capacity for conceptual abstraction. This capacity does not 
seem to be necessitated in the case of awe, which is known 
to be correlated with various ‘numinous’ states typical 
of religious and mystical experiences notably lacking in 
self-referential, conceptual abstraction; nor in the case of 
wonder, a response which may arise as a meta-response to a 
mysterious or apparently unfathomable event without any 
corresponding attempt to ‘conceive’ of or ‘conceptualize’ it 
any further. Thus it is that while children seem to display 
an extensive capacity for awe and wonder along with their 
similarly vast predilection for states of fear and terror (often 
to the dismay of more ‘rational’ adults), the capability to 
experience, appreciate, and even cultivate horror only 
increases with the skill of rational, conceptual, critical thought. 
Likewise, one may intellectually understand what numinous 
awe or wonder may entail, without experiencing them in 
the same context in which one understands them intellectu­
ally. Awe is not, in and of itself, awesome, nor is wonder in 
and of itself necessarily wonderful, but horror, self-referen­
tially, is, of and for itself, horrible and horrifying. That this is 
so makes horror the most Gnostic of emotional extremes 
and excesses, in the sense of being a knowledge character­
ized by directness of empirical experience (self-referential) 
rather than based on some correspondent premise (other-
referential). In keeping with this, it is no coincidence that 
those mystics and esoteric philosophers deemed ‘Gnostics’ 
in the increasingly decadent Imperial Roman cosmopolis 
elaborated mythic reflections of the world which detailed 
all manifest reality as nested layers within layers of horrific 
depravity, their ‘gnosis’ (direct, experiential knowledge) of 
salvation and escape implicitly depending on a nightmare 
network of interwoven matrix-horrors to escape from. 
The archaic roots of Gnostic horror can be followed 
(How often do the monsters typical of horror find their 
way into fantasies and ‘science’ fictions? The masters and 
progenitors of modern horror, Poe and Lovecraft, wrote 
tales of mystery and wonder along with their more horrific 
works. In the latter case, the same Mythos appeared in all 
of his chosen genres).1 
Whether expressed in the cinema or in the word, or 
experienced viscerally in the routines or tragedies of life, 
Horror remains distinctly consistent, arising from an 
experience of cognitive dread which cannot be escaped 
or evaded. Indeed, this very conceptual consistency is 
one of its traits: Horror is the most easily self-referential 
of all genres.2 Alone among concepts, Horror depends on 
the concept of the ‘concept’ for its own conceptual power 
– since dread beyond what can already be known to have been 
conceived is an indispensable characteristic of horror; alone 
among concepts, a full conception and understanding of 
it, implies the experience of it. Horror is not alone among 
those responses which require self-consciousness; animals 
lacking individual self-consciousness provide no evidence 
of experiencing horror despite their extensive capacity for 
fear. Of course, animals also do not seem to experience 
any other emotions typical of self-consciousness such as 
wonder, awe, or creative amusement either. Yet horror 
remains distinct from these others in its dependence on the

1990), 17-42. Carroll’s work presents a theory of ‘art-horror’ elaborated in exacting 
detail; the important aspect of it referenced here is that the horror genre depends, in 
his view, on its establishment of direct correlation between the emotional state of the 
monster’s victim and the emotional state of the audience or reader. The rest of his 
theory is not necessarily endorsed by the rest of this article.

fantasy, science-fiction, and even works classifiable only 
as mythic dramas (Anne Rice), not to mention their total 
escapist attraction in the form of gothic role-playing and 
subculture, neither of which exactly stimulate anything 
like the emotion of horror in their participants. The only 
consistent signifier of Horror is not the monster, but rather 
its victim.
	What might this tell us about the nature of self-con­
sciousness and its expression through the aesthetic?  Why 
is it that the most direct indicator of self-consciousness 
combined with rational, abstract cognition, seems to be the 
capacity for horror, and how is it the case that this condition 
can only be signified aesthetically through its embodiment 
in a victim? Most perplexingly – and, as will be revealed 
through this meditation upon Horror, most horrifically – 
why do the perpetrators of Horror, the ‘monsters’, exert 
such an attraction upon self-conscious beings that they 
violate not only their victims but also the boundaries of 
their own genre, ultimately to become not only figures 
of fun and fantasy, and occasionally figures of awe and 
wonder in the frequent cases of religions of the monstrous 
or terrible, but even role-models which provide for some 
not only escapist pleasure, but a guide to life?
I. Exaltation of the Victim
Impaled on towering spikes, the victims of Vlad Tepes 
– Dracula – make apt examples of Horror’s veneration of 
the violated. Is it any coincidence that the larger-than-life 
heroine-victims of the screen Dracula are likewise exalted 
figures?  The horror is not merely one of possible identifica­
tion with the damsel or hero threatened by the monstrous 
being; the work of Lovecraft is an excellent indication of 
through the labyrinthine tunnels of historic and prehistoric 
dualist myths, yet the experiential gnosis of horror is 
certainly anterior to the dualistic coping mechanisms it 
inspires in some persons and groups. Independently of, yet 
inclusive of, both self and other, Horror pervades conscious­
ness which is conscious of itself: to observe someone suffi­
ciently horrified is horrific. To observe a horrific other – a 
‘monster’ – is horrific. Yet to observe oneself horrified is 
just as horrific, if not more so. Thus, Horror also maintains 
the fascinating quality of being self-renewing, for while awe 
and wonder may both collapse under sufficiently detached 
rational observation, Horror only seems to increase the 
more it is contemplated.
	Yet the perpetrators and effectuators of Horror – 
‘monsters’ in whatever form – do not seem to be guarantors 
of Horror even if they are its prerequisites. (And ‘monsters’ 
here means anything horrifying, not necessarily only 
the tentacle-beasts reviled by Lovecraft or the cinematic 
creations which prey on the sentiments of moviegoers.) 
That this is so can easily be discerned by noticing that the 
various beings of Lovecraft’s Mythos appear throughout 
his own tales of wonder (such as Randolph Carter’s dream 
quests) with the same frequency that they manifest in 
overtly horrific contexts in the rest of his work. They spill 
across the threshold not only of genre, but of authorship, 
to populate the worlds of Robert Howard and ultimately 
the annals of contemporary science-fiction in a variety of 
media. Lest this phenomenon be thought limited to the 
bizarre Old Ones of Lovecraftian provenance, the example 
of the vampire should be sufficient contradiction. Perhaps 
the most classic staple of ‘gothic horror’, whether cinematic 
or literary, vampires nevertheless also find themselves in

possession may theoretically have done something to invite 
the demon in, but do not have the ‘gnosis’ of it ... until it 
arrives. At which point it is too late to forget, or to banish 
the knowledge. But if horror is an emotion particular only 
to abstract, reasoning self-consciousnesses, why don’t the 
victims ‘deserve’ what transpires, especially if they are guilty 
of something? It seems that one of the reasons that reason is 
required for horror, is that it is precisely reason which, in 
being violated, produces the experience of horror. Hence, 
the purest horror – ‘concept-horror’ – in which it is some 
concept which proves to be the most horrifying of all. 
Before seeking out the most archaic formulae of such 
‘concept-horror’, let us continue the autopsy of the horror 
victim. The archetypical possessed horror victim (as well 
as the favoured ‘Satanic’ sacrifice), a virgin young girl, is 
in-nocent by definition – and often expected, colloquially at 
least, to be blond and pretty. The significance of this, beyond 
the aesthetic, will be peeled back later as this morbid inquiry 
proceeds. It is worth inquiring: is involuntary possession 
always horrible? What about the identity of the possession 
victim? Even the lacklustre Exorcist prequel (still technically 
a horror film despite its heavy reliance on terror), set in 
Africa, ends up requiring the demon to eventually possess 
a European female presented as an object of desire in the 
course of the story. How would such a possession film fare 
if all the possession victims were of African identity and 
undefined desirability? The zombies in Night of the Living 
Dead are most successful in their assaults on innocent 
young women, and survived only by the black hero of the 
film who is finally killed when the white mob purging the 
zombies miscodes him as ... one of the monsters. 
this, desexualized as it is, and with characters stripped down 
to being bare instruments of perception, as Houellebecq 
points out in his thorough study of Lovecraftian horror.3 
Yet Lovecraft’s depictions of violated observers whose 
very perceptions are impaled by an intrusive, inescapably 
bizarre alien otherness, do have something in common with 
cinematic preferences for innocent feminine youth across 
a genre inclusive of innumerable ladies of monstrous fate, 
murderous fate (Vivian Leigh, screen avatar of a victim 
conceived by an author deeply influenced by Lovecraft, 
Robert Bloch), demonic violation (Linda Blair, whose 
diabolical inhabitant was not merely a standard horned 
scaly devil à la Dante or Bosch, but in fact was identified 
in the Exorcist film tradition as the hideous disease-demon 
Pazuzu, a Mesopotamian entity worthy of Lovecraft’s Mad 
Arab necromancer Al-Hazred and his Necronomicon), or 
demonic seduction and subversion (Mia Farrow, mother of 
Rosemary’s Baby, offspring of Satan himself). Hidden within 
the obscure commonality here discerned is further gnosis of 
horror: let us vivisect it, and see.
Whether male or female, the ideal victim of horror is 
innocent, as regards the horror. This is not just in the usual 
analogical sense of being undeserving of their torment (for 
while many victims of fictional horror are not innocent of 
all wrongdoing, none could possibly deserve exactly what 
befalls them) but in the literal sense of previously having no 
gnosis of it. Indeed, in Lovecraft’s work, it is the horrifying 
knowledge which is often itself the source of the awful conse­
quences befalling the victim. Likewise, victims of demonic

to be known as Lovecraftian horror is indeed the most 
conceptual. In some cases, Lovecraft’s clinical descriptions of 
the utterly alien and bizarre juxtaposed with the inability of 
his protagonists (mere projections of the perceptive faculty) 
to ignore or turn away until it is too late, suffice to produce far 
greater horror than any description of their actual physical 
violation could hope to do. As Houellebecq points out, 
this is one reason why Lovecraftian horror is so difficult to 
portray through visual media,4 though as this examination 
will show, the variable manifestations of horror all have 
an unexpectedly common conceptual trait despite their 
differences in regard to content. An interesting exception 
to the general rule that Lovecraftian films wind up being 
merely fantastic rather than horrible, is John Carpenter’s 
1995 In the Mouth of Madness. It manages to convey Love­
craftian horror through an almost excessively self-referen­
tial structure and plot: instead of being a Lovecraft story 
transplanted into a modern setting, it features as antagonist 
an author representing a sort of combination of Lovecraft 
himself and his dark prophet Nyarlathotep,  whose work 
begins horrifically to be reflected in reality following his 
mysterious disappearance. One of the most memorable, 
and horrifying, scenes in the film involves the investigating 
detective trapped in a cinema watching a film that begins 
to depict him being assaulted by creatures reminiscent of 
Lovecraft’s story Dagon. Despite the usual unfilmability of 
Lovecraft’s eldritch horrors, In the Mouth of Madness captures 
the inescapable violation of perception, reason, and sanity 
which occurs in the stories, by actually using the context 
4. Houellebecq,  64-69.
Leaving demons and victims of miscoding aside, 
further insight into the realm of horror lies in the 
characterization of one of the most classic horror motifs: 
the standard vampire-victim (or vampire love-interest). 
He or she begins as innocent of the vampiric reality, even if 
not virginal. Is it horrific for a vampire to prey on another 
vampire? Yet there is a certain commonality between the 
vampire, whether male or female, and its prey; the prey 
is likewise pale, often presented as attractive – fitted to 
be turned into a vampire, in fact. What about the victims 
of other, more inhuman, horrible monsters?  While such 
creatures will sometimes kill indiscriminately (especially 
in ‘terror’ films as opposed to horror proper), they do 
seem to have an unusual taste for devouring the civilized, 
the self-aware, the rational: victims who are particularly 
innocent of the creatures’ visceral realm. Even when the 
jungle-beast or the tentacle-monster starts eating its way 
through its own natives or cultists – is this alone horrific? 
Not enough to make a horror film out of it. Even the horror 
of the murder victim, in order to survive in the realm of 
more realist horror fiction, seems to share the signal traits: 
either innocence of unavoidably fitting the criteria of ‘victim’, 
until it is too late; or the equally horrible foreknowledge 
of unavoidably fitting that criteria; innocence of the world 
(physical, moral, or conceptual) from whence the horrible 
murderer/monster originates; and again, a cultural and 
racial type frequently associated with, or perhaps conflated 
with, ‘purity’.  
Why should this particular type of victim find itself 
exalted through an entire genre which is not even so specifi­
cally jealous of its own monstrous protagonists?  And how 
does this relate to the conceptual nature of horror?

recording what is perceived (however horrible), or 
occasionally, to the staged or dramatic quality of events.  
Considering the abstract nature of such perceptual 
‘concept’ horror as is particularly present in Lovecraft’s 
work, is there any indication that his personal and aesthetic 
preferences, such as his Aryan racism as revealed throughout 
his personal biography and correspondence,7 contribute 
significantly to the content of his work?  Sufficient inves­
tigation has been done by others in exhaustive considera­
tion of the role of miscegenation in Lovecraft’s cosmology, 
as well as his representation of inhuman, meaningless, 
blind cosmic Life through unnameable and indescrib­
able ‘outer’ horrors, to establish that there is a certain 
analogy between the ‘penetration’ of the Aryan purity 
by ‘hideous’, alien, foreign elements, and the penetration 
of hapless Anglo-Saxon professors by tentacled predators 
from Outside their known reality.8  This necessitates a 
corresponding examination of the philosophical ramifica­
tions of Aryan racism in the context of horror, or at least 
a consideration of whether such an element is indeed indis­
pensable to Lovecraftian horror. But if so, is it indispensable 
to the whole horror genre? Or even to Horror itself? The 
intrusive, stark, ‘inconceivable reality’ of the concentration 
7. In reference to New York, Lovecraft wrote in a letter: ‘The organic things — Italo-
Semitico-Mongoloid — inhabiting that awful cesspool could not by any stretch of the 
imagination be call’d human. They were monstrous and nebulous adumbrations of 
the pithecanthropoid and amoebal; vaguely moulded from some stinking viscous 
slime of earth’s corruption, and slithering and oozing in and on the filthy streets. 
[…] They — or the gelatinous fermentation of which they were composed — seemed 
to ooze, seep and trickle thro’ the gaping cracks in the horrible houses […] and I 
thought of […] unwholesome vats, crammed to the vomiting point with gangrenous 
vileness.’ This description could, taken out of context, just as plausibly be guessed as 
an extract from an obscure Lovecraft tale concerning the miscegenated progeny of 
some horrific elder or outer things.

of film itself to reflect the self-referential, self-conscious 
nature of horror, when visual depictions are called for. At 
the same time, the constant use of embedded Lovecraft 
quotations, ostensibly ‘fictional’ even within the realm of 
the film, as part of the plot of the story itself, lends the film a 
quality of impossibility and madness which is a hallmark of 
Lovecraft’s work. Outside the horror genre proper, a similar 
technique was utilized in David Cronenberg’s adaptation of 
William Burroughs’s Naked Lunch by including the bizarre 
events presaging and during the writing of the book in the 
plot of the film itself, thereby again using self-referentiality 
to evade the Lovecraftian curse of unfilmability. While the 
book is surreal and often disgusting, some of the scenes in 
the film, particularly those involving monstrous eroticism, 
certainly approach horror, although that may not have 
been the specific intent. Cronenberg’s entire oeuvre is replete 
with the imagery of ‘bio-horror’, in which the conceptual 
boundaries of the flesh are violated and protagonists 
become their own monstrous victims – as in The Fly – 
demonstrating that the monster is not only ‘interstitial’, as 
Carroll describes,5 but is also an instance of ‘incomplete 
abjection’, in Kristeva’s sense. The conceptual boundaries 
of the bodily self are horrifically violated not just through 
destruction or even invasion, but ultimately through an 
inability to separate from a body that itself becomes alien.6 
As a final example, Hitchcock’s films, whether suspense or 
horror, tend to involve frequent, if subtle, self-reference to 
the eye as instrument of perception, the camera as avatar 
of the viewer’s inability to cease looking and therefore

What, then, was the origin of this power – the power not 
of an ‘image’, but of a concept of parasitic, infectious disease-
horror – over the cultural (and perhaps even philosoph­
ical) mind of the Zoroastrian Aryan, making him the very 
inventor of the concept of evil?  
The Aryans in Iran, unlike their Vedic peers and 
Lovecraft both, would not seem to have had obvious justi­
fication for elaborating a traditional ethnic xenophobia 
into full-blown moral paranoia. The Brahmins were faced 
with an indigenous population whose dominant genetic 
traits have been proven by history to be mightier than 
their Aryocentric anti-miscegenation law codes. In parallel, 
Lovecraft was driven from New York by the dominant, 
successful immigrant populations. As we know, he found 
this experience horrific, yet in contrast, any expected 
‘horror’ on the part of the Brahmins for the dark non-Aryan 
people seems to have been notably absent in India. Black 
Kali herself, whether an Aryan death goddess, as some 
claim, or the terrible indigenous mother herself, inspires 
simultaneous awe and terror, but not horror. The mixing of 
castes and the Kali-yuga, inspired woe or detached sorrow 
in the pure Aryans – but not horror. The Aryans in Iran, 
by contrast, were apparently the sole inhabitants of a desert 
plateau, and thus without significant competition, their 
recessive traits secure until Arab invasions millennia later. 
Lest it be suggested that a lack of racial competition turned 
their conflict-obsessed, warlike selves against each other 
until the prophet Zoroaster invented his horrors merely as 
a foil to produce cultural unity, the reader should only need 
to be reminded of northern Europe, which occupied itself 
quite consistently in a constant state of unremitting tribal 
warfare throughout its entire history until it was Christian­
ized, uninterrupted by anything like a gnosis of horror, 
camp as often remarked upon by both scholars of modern 
evil and the Holocaust itself seems to attest that Horror is 
inseparable from Aryan racism, so investigating this rela­
tionship of dependence from another vantage may prove 
revealing.
The first Aryans to conceive of absolute horror, the 
Zoroastrian dualists of prehistoric Iran, found its origins 
in the Mother of Abomination, Drug, later known as 
Druj, whose name comprises both what we would know 
as a ‘drag-on’ and also what might best be conceived as a 
‘simulation’, a corruption of reality, whether in the form of 
a strategic dissimulation, a false affirmation, or an outright 
physical blackening as of a decomposing corpse. The word 
is usually translated simply as ‘Lie’, and was also used in 
the context of betrayal, such as, of an oath, promise, or 
contract. Why these Aryans in Iran as the originators of a 
concept of intrusive, infested, parasitic horror, propagating 
itself upon and within a host innocent of its nature? The 
Druj, mother of all demons and of the Devil himself, 
originally an abstraction, a conceptual evil knowledge, the 
Angstful Mind, reaches out from her primordial, prehistoric 
Middle-Eastern domain to eventually rip herself free from 
the stomachs of Aryan astronauts in Geigeresque, cinematic 
form as the ‘alien’. Like the ‘alien Mother’, the Druj is 
horrifically and monstrously interstitial – She is fecund, 
yet death-producing; female, yet signified by masculine 
intrusiveness. She penetrates and violates like a rapist, 
yet she is an endless womb of darkness and depravity.9

Cynthia Freeland, The Naked and the Undead: Evil and the Appeal of Horror (Boulder: 
Westview, 1999). See also Barbara Creed’s essay, ‘Horror and the Monstrous 
Feminine: An Imaginary Abjection’, for an apt description of an ‘archaic, phallic 
mother’ reminiscent of Druj, with the Angra Mainyu as her surrogate ‘male 
component’.

of strokes with the punishment whip a transgressor is to 
receive for violating any of the minutiae of purity laws, 
concerned with everything from moral conduct to the 
compulsively precise handling of corpses in order to ensure 
that the community and the natural world remain undefiled 
by the naso-druj, the corpse-demon. Extreme infractions, 
such as exposure of corpses to water or fire, result in the 
transgressor being publicly flayed alive.  Many interesting 
technicalities of the Zoroastrian hygiene obsession can be 
found in the Vendidad, such as the association of albinism 
with uncleanness, and the rule that physicians-in-training 
were to practice on those who worshipped the daevas so as to 
avoid accidentally killing the faithful. Male homosexuality 
is so abhorred that its practitioners are proclaimed in the 
Vendidad to be demons incarnate. Sexual intercourse with 
a menstruating woman is an offense against purity worthy 
of death. Eventually, for the Zoroastrians, any being of 
evil thoughts, or an evil mind, might be a vehicle for Druj. 
This does not only include representatives of any other 
creed whatsoever: even those who outwardly professed the 
Good Religion might secretly be ‘endowed with the Lie’. 
The incredible irony of Zoroastrianism is that the same 
Aryan trait of xenophobia which made the ancient Iranians 
amenable to this most paranoid of all world-views had to be 
abandoned in order for the Zoroastrian creed of absolute 
moral goodness in opposition to absolute moral evil to 
be adopted. Once the Aryans adopted the Zoroastrian 
religion, their enemies were not outsiders but any others (even 
unrecognizable others in their midst, like Drujic ‘body­
snatchers’), who carried the Lie. Even, and especially, fellow 
Aryans – a notion inconceivable amongst any other Indo-
European group, none of which had any difficulty either 
with feuding incessantly with each other indiscriminately, 
conceptual, racial, or otherwise. 
It can only be that, for reasons unknown (perhaps 
reasons sufficiently horrific that, as in the case of Great 
Cthulhu and the Lovecraftian Old Ones, it may be more 
wholesome not to know), the Aryans in Iran encountered, or 
believed themselves to have encountered, a threat perceived 
to be sufficiently difficult to distinguish from themselves 
that it was, or might be, within.10  The requisite condition 
for absolute horror is presented: inescapable dread, a factor 
which would produce constant terror – except that flight 
is not only impossible, but inconceivable. Conceptual 
horror enshrined in philosophy was then born in Iran as 
the Mother of Abominations. It is no exaggeration to say 
that by the time the moral dualism of the Zoroastrians was 
fully cosmologically and performatively elaborated in the 
Vendidad, their book of ritual codes and taboos against 
the devils, their obsession with purity – the exaltation of 
themselves as potential victims of intrusive, penetrative 
violation by Druj and her ravenous children – had reached 
proportions so extreme that the same ritual fixations outside 
of an excusably cultural or religious context would now 
earn a diagnosis of paranoid-schizophrenia with combined 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, or worse. The Vendidad is a 
study in terror if not outright horror itself. Each ‘Fargard’, 
or chapter, recites repetitively and thoroughly the number 
10. Lovecraft himself speculated on a similar process involving fear of hidden, internal 
others in European tradition, writing in his classic study Supernatural Horror in Literature 
(NY: Dover, 1973), ‘Much of the power of Western horror-lore was undoubtedly due 
to the hidden but often suspected presence of a hideous cult of nocturnal worshipers 
whose strange customs were rooted in the most revolting fertility rites of immemorial 
antiquity. This secret religion, stealthily handed down among peasants for thousands 
of years despite the  outward reign of Druidic, Greco-Roman, and Christian faiths in 
the regions involved, was marked by “Witches Sabbaths” […] on Walpurgis Night 
and Hallowe’en, the traditional breeding-seasons of the goats and sheep and cattle; 
and became the source of vast riches of sorcery legend.’

the Outside). Lovecraft’s own universe, in contrast to both 
of those visions, is a horrifically amoral one. The rational 
perceiver cannot escape the immeasurable, futile, imbecile 
meaninglessness of the blind cosmos, and is devoured by it. 
Yet the Zoroastrian believes that through morality (Good 
Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds), the Druj and 
her children can be overcome. Ironically, in doing so, the 
Zoroastrian remains ‘Aryan’ in name only, abandoning 
the signifying trait of racial xenophobia which Lovecraft 
himself maintained – even through the absolute materialism 
consistently apparent in the same correspondence in which 
he expresses his racist views. This is not mere coincidence. 
Rather, it plainly demonstrates an inescapable ‘Aryan truth’ 
which is perhaps the ‘Aryan horror’: As long as the Aryan 
identifies in any meaningful way with ethnic traits which are 
constantly genetically embattled by competing populations, 
the capacity for perceiving a world of unremitting conceptual 
horror remains. This observation, however, fails to account 
for why Lovecraft elaborated, under the influence of his 
racial obsessions, a cosmology of absolute horror, while his 
equally race-obsessed Brahmin counterparts by contrast 
in fact ultimately presented a cosmology of all-pervading, 
triumphal wonderment and awe. Simultaneously, the 
Brahmins’ Iranian cousins, originally equally xenophobic, 
chose to maintain their paranoia through moralism – at 
the cost of their ethnic fixation. It is Lovecraft’s philosoph­
ical materialism which settles the matter: both the Indian 
Brahmins and the Iranians maintained cultural beliefs in a 
spiritual realm independent of the material world. Lovecraft 
did not.11

or with uniting easily against even more foreign outsiders. 
Yet the Iranians became the exception, and gave the world 
the 
first 
universalist 
moral 
philosophy, 
ultimately 
bequeathing it to the ancient Jews, who shared with the 
Indo-European ancestors of the Aryans a xenophobic 
racism, even while the Jews lacked those recessive genetic 
traits the preservation of which, as signifiers of purity, 
inspired a racialist concept amongst the Indo-Europeans 
forgotten aeons ago. 
A comparison of the Druj to the Old Ones of the 
Lovecraftian mythos is intriguing, for while both concepts 
were invented by racists, the inventors of the former 
ceased to be racist as soon as they conceived their horror, 
whilst Lovecraft became only more vitriolic with time 
and exposure to foreign people. The principal difference 
is easily summarized: the Druj was considered to be evil, 
whilst Cthulhu, Azathoth, Yog-Sothoth, and all their 
various spawn, are simply alien. (In this, the Geigeresque 
cinema ‘alien’ is more Lovecraftian than Zoroastrian, yet as 
the quasi-androgynous-yet-penetrating ‘demon-child’ of the 
Alien Mother it functions much as do the daevic offspring 
of Druj. Unlike Lovecraft’s Outer Ones, it is susceptible to 
physical, material defeat in a modern combat myth, and 
by a very un-Lovecraftian heroine who defends the moral 
world order against violation by both the alien outsider, 
and the ‘Drujic’ simulation-strategy of the nefarious 
corporation and its android agent. Perhaps more Lovecraf­
tian in effect than Ripley’s ‘alien’ nemesis is Norman Bates, 
– ‘possessed by the Druj’, the ‘lie’ of his mother, yet in that 
very sense his own victim and his own monster, even as he 
butchers his victim, who finds the purifying waters of the 
shower no refuge from asexual penetration by the avatar of

enough to embrace such a conception with participatory 
enthusiasm.13  He did not want to contribute to the world 
of horrors; rather, he rejected life. If he had believed in a 
soul, he would have been a Gnostic dualist, but even this 
option was closed to him in his atheistic materialism. (The 
Gnostics, while rejecting the supposedly-divine ‘archons’, 
the spiritual creators of, and rulers of, the material world 
of horrors, asserted an all-Good, all-perfect, spiritual 
reality of divine emanations beyond it; an option totally 
unacceptable to Lovecraft’s materialistic ‘cosmicism’).14 
no indication that either one was understood to murder human beings sadistically 
or for the purpose of deriving pleasure specifically from harming people. In this 
sense, the difference between dystheism and maltheism could be likened to the 
difference between honoring man-eating beasts (or an advanced race of amoral extra-
terrestrials, for a more ‘godlike’ analogy) and honoring serial or mass-murderers (or, 
to continue the analogy of ‘advanced’ beings, a race of creature that hunts human 
beings for sport or pleasure). 
13. While it might be considered questionable to assert that the Nazi philosophy 
is maltheistic since ‘Providence’ or the ‘Gott-force’ in Nature was understood by 
the Nazis to support Aryans and cause them to flourish, it would certainly have 
been perceived as maltheistic by Lovecraft. He was married to a Jewish woman, 
reviled violence and cruelty, and was too materialistic to have considered theological 
justifications for killing as are found in the Bhagavad-Gita, in which the god Krishna 
reveals to the story’s protagonist that he should have no regret over killing even 
those for whom he feels respect or affection since all beings are merely projections of 
an ultimately indestructible Self. Himmler was reported to have frequently carried a 
translation of this text – and was presumably not, for this reason, a maltheist, despite 
his affection for the imagery of death. The ideology of those Jews who willingly 
cooperated with the Nazi regime (especially any who cooperated with the SS) could 
easily have been described as one of the forms of maltheism proposed above, however, 
particularly in cases wherein the plight of the Jews was understood to have been sent 
as divine retribution, since modern Jews, unlike their ancient predecessors, generally 
regard Yahweh as omnipotent (thanks to Zoroastrian influence identifying Yahweh 
with the omnipotent Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, subsequent to their liberation 
by Cyrus the Great and his Zoroastrian Persians, from captivity in Babylon).  It 
is perhaps this potential for maltheism within monotheism that led to the famous 
‘trial of God in Auschwitz’ account of Elie Wiesel, and the various elaborations of 
‘Holocaust theology’ in modern Judaism.
14. Ironically, the earliest Gnostics themselves seem to have been Hellenized 
Alexandrian Jews, probably expatriate in the wake of the second Jewish revolt under 
increasing Indian rationalism and critical thinking, was that 
all life is pervaded with suffering, rendering theism irrelevant. 
For Lovecraft, thoroughly atheistic and avowedly soulless, 
it was not just suffering, but utter horror. Yet his ultimate 
rejection of the opportunity to write Nazi propaganda in 
the pre-war decade, and his rejection of Nazi atrocity and 
genocide, demonstrates something else: while Lovecraft’s 
cosmos was a brutal one, he was not himself maltheistic12 
12. In contrast to dystheism, which merely supposes that the deity is not good, maltheism 
proposes that the deity is actively and intentionally malicious. It should be noted 
that neither of those alternatives specify whether or not it is advisable to venerate 
the deity in question. The Zoroastrian Church condemned two maltheistic sects, 
one of which, called the daevayasna, was accused of venerating the Druj, Ahriman, 
and the daevas apotropeically – that is, with the intent to placate or banish them. The 
other sect, that of the yatukih sorcerers, was accused of actively honoring the evil 
principles with the intent to gain power from doing so: the original example of what 
the Christian world knows as the ‘pact with the Devil’.  It remains unclear whether or 
not the yatukih also recognized the existence of a ‘good’ deity opposing Ahriman and 
the Druj, and if so, whether they ignored him, or actively opposed him. (Or whether 
they acknowledged him as good at all). It seems that the Lovecraftian cults of the 
Old Ones would qualify as maltheistic only in the ‘Derleth recension’ of the Cthulhu 
Mythos, since only that later, dualized version of Lovecraft’s cosmology promotes 
the Elder Gods as moral opponents of the Old Ones. It may be possible to consider 
some forms of monotheism to be necessarily maltheistic, when an understanding 
of the god is offered in which its omnipotence (or ultra-potence, in cases in which 
it is more powerful than any other being or beings combined, but not actually all-
powerful) is not only greater than its benevolence, but uncompromised with any 
notion of benevolence whatsoever. Within such possible monotheistic conceptions 
of a non-benevolent god who is either the only god or the supreme one, a further 
distinction may perhaps be drawn between apotropaic maltheism, in which the god or 
deity is venerated in the hope that its malefic attention may be turned away, contractual 
maltheism, in which the power is venerated in order to increase one’s standing, stature, 
or power within its reality or domain, and latreic maltheism, in which it is actively 
worshipped or adored in a sort of religious Stockholm-syndrome,  a compulsive 
response to its irresistible but awful or malign numinosity. A sub-category of latreic 
maltheism might be propitiatory maltheism, in which it is supposed that the malice of the 
divine being can be mollified in some way even if not actively averted, as in the case 
of apotropeic maltheism. It should be noted that this typology of maltheism could 
easily be mirrored with reference to dystheistic demon-cults in which destructive (but 
not intentionally malicious) powers are venerated for the aims or reasons described. 
The disease-demon Pazuzu, for example, was viewed as dangerously destructive 
most of the time, as was the even more feared child-slaying Lamashtu, but there is

spiritual transcendence or eternal life through resurrection. 
In a great biographical and historical double irony, 
Lovecraft the racist married a Jewish woman, Sonia 
Greene, exempting her from his xenophobic tirades – yet 
his materialism historically descended from a rationalistic 
response to Judaeo-Christianity, the offspring of Zoroastrian 
dualism and Semitic culture.
III. Purity
There can be no reversing the unique tragedy of the 
Holocaust. It must be remembered, with shame and 
horror, for as long as human memory continues. Only 
by remembering can we pay fitting tribute to the victims. 
(UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, observing International 
Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27, 2006, anniversary 
of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau by the Soviets.)
	Now archetypal symbols of human evil, often regarded 
as actually living embodiments of absolute horror, the 
Nazis are strangely absent from fictional horror, while their 
presence (or their equivalent, such as Palpatine’s Galactic 
Empire of Star Wars fame) is surreally commonplace 
alongside various more eldritch monsters in the annals of 
fantasy and science-fiction. Additionally, Occult Nazism is a 
staple of fringe conspiracy lore and pseudo-esoteric crypto-
history, and Nazi super-villains and super-sorcerers of some 
variety are by no means infrequent adversaries in occult 
fiction and suspense thrillers. This alone is peculiar, since 
surely the Nazis are regarded as infinitely more horrific, in 
carnal reality, than any serial murderer one could name – 
yet not a single horror-genre film of any significance has ever 
featured someone racially motivated to prey on non-Aryan 
victims, much less featured an actual Nazi as its antagonist. 
The Zoroastrians, however, maintained their spiritual 
beliefs despite their conception of the ‘life-horror’ of Druj. 
They only conceived of such horror in the absence of the 
simple othering process that gave rise to the Vedic caste 
system, or the assimilation of local populations that char­
acterized the gradual Indo-European drift into Europe. 
Instead, whatever ethnic or cultural influences threatened 
the ancient Iranians, these threats must have been 
perceived as outwardly indistinguishable from the Aryan 
population, requiring a new concept in order to maintain 
Aryan self-other polarity. That concept: horror – mother 
of absolute dualism; as Druj, Mother of Abominations. In 
identifying that which was ‘other’ than the ambiguity of 
the life of flesh, the Zoroastrians also invented the Iranian 
version of the Indo-European cognitive dualism. In contrast 
to societies of gradual, graduated ethnic mixture wherein this 
perspective manifested as mind-body dualism, in apparently 
homogenous Iran, it manifested as moral dualism. Instead of 
an escape from the embodied world, as sought by Orphics, 
Gnostics, and yogis alike, the Zoroastrians conceived of 
immortal youth in a perfected, resurrected body, inhabiting 
an eternally perfected world of monotonous, sterile 
cleanliness and light, given to Ahura Mazda’s faithful as 
a reward for moral behaviour. For Lovecraft, materialist 
that he was, no such solace could be found either in 
Trajan, who particularly reviled the God of Israel as an evil ‘demiurge’.  See Carl B. 
Smith II, No Longer Jews: The Search for Gnostic Origins (Peabody: Hendrickson, 2004), 
for details. They generally abominated the whole material cosmos, but proposed a 
transcendent spiritual escape, in a manner similar to the renunciation of the round of 
rebirth by Indian philosophers seeking liberation, and to the earlier Orphic mystics. 
While all these philosophies share in common an origin in the collision of Indo-
European and non-Indo-European cultural patterns, only Gnosticism seems to have 
originated amongst people who were themselves an ethnic out-group within an Indo-
European society – and it is only Gnosticism which proposes not only a binding and 
malignant material world, but a malicious creator-god as its origin.

rejected in order to avoid the horror. The work of Lovecraft 
represents a striking testament to the fact that, from the 
perspective of the Aryan racist, the manifest physical 
world is a whole world of horror, a reality not just of terrible 
strife, or frightful competition for resources, but indeed an 
inescapably dreadful experience of invasion from without. 
This phenomenon of belief provides further demonstra­
tion that the Nazi preoccupation with ‘Jewish materialism’ 
and with the supposedly insidious nature of Jewish 
sexuality as virally infecting, perverting, and corrupting the 
otherwise pure German race, was by no means an artifact of 
Christian morality combined with political expedience. For 
the Zoroastrian Iranians also displayed a paranoid response 
to confrontation with influences perceived as invasive from 
without and hidden within. The Nazis, however, despite 
all their dualistic propaganda, rejected the solution of 
moral dualism, preferring instead consciously and willfully 
to become embodied perpetrators of absolute horror 
upon their presumed infiltrators. While Nazi propaganda 
depicted Jews in verminous terms, and displayed the octo­
pus-tentacles of the Elders of Zion insinuating themselves 
upon defenseless globes and world-maps, the Nazis did not 
depict Jews as externally menacing, mighty demonic beings 
with huge armies of Satanic devils at their disposal, capable 
of opposing the Aryan legions on equal footing. While the 
Nazis presented the ‘hordes’ from the Communist east as 
threatening mobs of ‘sub-humans’, such mobs were certainly 
not depicted as mythically comparable to the bewitching 
majesty of the Angstful Mind and all the monstrous and 
terrible children of the Druj. Stalin was no Ahriman, at least 
not to the Nazis. Rather, the self-proclaimed elite of the Nazi 
party, Himmler’s SS, reveled in its own imagery of death, 
(The infamous ‘Nazi exploitation’ genre of course excepted 
– save that it qualifies more as pornography than horror.) 
More peculiar still is the occasional association, in occult 
and fantasy/science-fiction, of said Nazi super-villains with 
black magic, ‘Satanic’ rites, and the conjuration of terrible 
ancient monstrosities blatantly reminiscent of Lovecraft’s 
Mythos. (The tentacled horrors emerging from the abyss 
in the Hellboy comics and films with the assistance of Nazi 
sorcerers and Rasputin serve as an excellent example.) 
Beneath the apparently superficial aesthetic of the 
pop-culture sensibility lurks something of significance: the 
same perpetrators of violence and horror – whether evil 
Nazis or Cthulhu monsters – are determined to be figures 
of either horror or fantasy based specifically on the identities 
of their victims. Thus, while Lovecraft’s violated professors 
are often stripped of all significant personality and traits, 
even of any references to sexuality, they remain Anglo-Saxon 
professors, horrified by the miscegenated, bestial realities 
they confront. In fact, so long as they are not engaged in 
the violation of Lovecraft’s ideal Aryan scientists (modeled 
more or less after himself), the very same tentacular Old 
Ones somehow desist from being figures of actual horror, 
instead crossing genres and winding up being summoned 
for genocidal purposes by more murderous Germanic 
professors in the vein of Mengele and Himmler, whose 
racial sensibilities, if not their ethics, Lovecraft embraced. It 
would seem that horror as it is generally appreciated within 
contemporary culture not only requires victims identifiable 
with the originating ethno-cultural group, but also depends 
upon the total disassociation of the monster from possible 
identification with such victims. That is, horror requires 
both a Zoroastrian dualism, and the maintenance (at least 
cryptically) of the racialism the Zoroastrians themselves

Zoroastrians were racist, albeit sporadically, when fighting 
Central Asian adversaries. Lovecraft was not beyond re-ap­
propriating monstrous imageries in a non-horrific context to 
make his racist point. His pentacular Great Old Ones with 
their asexual lost civilization, eventually overthrown by their 
own decadent progeny, resonate in strange kinship with the 
human researchers who discover their remains beneath 
the Antarctic ice – a closer kinship than those researchers 
would have had to fellow humans whom Lovecraft would 
have called ‘inferior stock’. Such a demonstration of the 
ultimate identification of the monstrous with Aryan purity 
need not be considered completely tangential in Lovecraft’s 
work, however. In one of his more unusual tales, somehow 
one of wonder and horror simultaneously, Lovecraft’s bare 
instrument of perception, the narrator, discovers itself to be 
the monster. In this short story is collapsed and compressed 
the full gnosis of the Aryan truth of horror, ultimate originator 
of both the moral dualism and the renewed Aryan dualism 
of absolute racial superiority, and of self-victimization, as 
an antidote to perceived weakness. The purest form of 
conceptual horror is the realization of inescapable identity 
with the monstrous perception – the concept – which is 
both the object and source of horror. Yet, when that object 
of horror is also the subject, the instrument of perception, 
wave upon wave of self-referential, cascading horror is the 
result. Zoroastrian dualism provides one solution – a ‘good’ 
spiritual identity for the self, an ‘evil’ spiritual identity for 
the other, horrific only in ‘this world’.  Nazi racism provides 
the other solution – ‘evil’ deeds of horror performed by 
the self as a displacement of the horror of invasion by the 
other, the pure becoming the monstrous: the self-exalted 
victim, the now-monstrous Aryan; the reality victim, the 
scapegoated Jew. For Lovecraft, though, as for any Aryanist 
and glorified in the extermination not of mighty evil foes, 
but of weakness, both in themselves and in others. In simple 
terms, they chose to act the part of their own monsters. It 
is an irony of history and human thought that the Nazis’ 
chosen victims had become the world’s most loathed yet 
sometimes venerated ethnic group aeons previously, only 
after combining their own xenophobia with a moral dualism 
invented by Iranian Aryans for the purpose of adapting 
their own racism to an as yet unidentified, invisible enemy. 
Yet, despite the clearly monstrous nature of Nazi policy, 
Heinrich Himmler is often quoted as remarking that the 
real Nazi ‘triumph’ lay in their performance of horrific 
deeds while remaining otherwise humane and uncorrupt – 
at least in their own minds, the SS represented less a Stock­
holm-syndrome style identification with and veneration 
of ‘life-as-horror’, and more an attempt to somehow buy 
off ‘life-horror’ through mass offerings of victims rendered 
suitable due to the Jewish adoption of post-Aryan moral 
dualism as an ethical philosophy augmenting the Jews’ pre-
existent ethnic exclusivism.
Still, even as the Nazis remain the most morally 
demonized of all possible monsters, the exaltation of the 
pure white victim remains consistent and genre-inviolable: 
evil as the Nazi may be, the monster violating the same 
lovely blondes who could well be the Nazi ideal of beauty, 
is horrible. Lest the association of arcane horrors with 
monstrous-Aryans-gone-bad (rather than Aryan victims 
violated) be thought a post-war consequence, consider that 
Dracula, the vampiric horror icon, is based on a figure of 
Romanian history considered a local hero of Christendom, 
utilizing the horror of impalement as a deterrent against 
invasion by foreign others, the non-Aryan Turks. Even the

materialist, there was no solution or escape from the horror, 
as becoming the monster through deliberate identification is 
hardly an option for the extreme reductionist. For him, life 
is a conceptual nightmare with only the void of an empty 
consciousness as contrast.

Nine Disputations on 
Theology and Horror
1. After-Life
Ever since Aristotle distinguished the living from the 
non-living in terms of psukhê – commonly translated as 
‘soul’ or ‘life-principle’ – the concept of ‘life’ has itself been 
defined by a duplicity – at once self-evident and yet opaque, 
capable of categorization and capable of further mystifica­
tion. This duplicity is related to a another one, namely, that 
there are also two Aristotles – Aristotle-the-metaphysician, 
rationalizing psukhê, form, and causality, and Aristotle-the-
biologist, observing natural processes of ‘generation and 
corruption’ and ordering the ‘parts of animals’. 
Arguably, the question of life is the burning question of 
the contemporary era, one in which life is everywhere at 
stake as ‘bare life’, one in which ‘all politics is biopolitics’. 
If the question of Being was the central issue for antiquity 
(raised again by Heidegger), and if the question of God

several concise statements concerning the life of the after-life. 
In the seventh circle, Dante and his guide Virgil come to 
the ‘burning desert’, upon which a multitude of bodies are 
strewn about.1 Among them Dante and Virgil come across 
Capaneus, one of the seven kings who assaulted Thebes 
and defied the law of Jove. Capaneus lies stretched out on 
the burning sand, a rain of fire descending upon him, while 
he continues his curses against the sovereign. As Virgil 
explains, Capaneus is one of the blasphemers, grouped 
with the usurers and sodomites for their crimes against 
God, State, and Nature. But, as with many of Dante’s 
depictions in the Inferno, there is no redemption, and the 
punished are often far from being penitential. Their tired, 
Promethean drama of revolt, defiance, and blasphemy goes 
on for eternity.
It is easy to read such scenes in a highly anthropo­
morphic manner. But each individual ‘shade’ that Dante 
encounters is also associated with a group or ensemble that 
denotes a category of transgression, and this is especially 
the case of Middle Hell. Upon entering the gates of the City 
of Dis, Dante and Virgil are first confronted by a horde 
of demons, and then by the Furies. Once they are able to 
pass, they come upon a ‘landscape of open graves’, each 
one burning and holding within it one of the Heretics. The 
scene is visually depicted with great drama by Gustav Doré, 
who, following the prior example of Botticelli, presents the 
heretics as a mass of twisted, emaciated corpses emerging 
from their graves. Along the way they also encounter a 
river of bodies immersed in boiling blood (watched over by 
a regiment of Centaurs), as well as the ‘wood of suicides’, in 
1. Cf. XIV, 22-24: ‘some souls were stretched out flat upon their backs,/others were 
crouching there all tightly hunched,/some wandered, never stopping, round and 
round’ (Inferno, trans. Mark Musa, Penguin, 1984; all citations refer to this edition).
– as alive or dead – was the central issue for modernity 
(Kierkegaard, Nietzsche), then perhaps the central question 
today is that of Life – the function of the concept of ‘life 
itself’, the two-fold approach to life as at once scientific 
and mystical, the return of vitalisms of all types, and the 
pervasive politicization of life. 
The question that runs through these brief disputatio 
is the following: Can there be an ontology of ‘life’ that 
does not immediately become a concern of either Being 
or God? Put differently, if one accepts that the concept 
of ‘life’ is irreducible to biology, what then is to prevent 
it from becoming reducible to theology? Let us be even 
more particular: To what extent is ‘life’ as a concept always 
situated between a biology of a non-ontological ‘life itself’ 
and an onto-theology of the life-beyond-the-living, or 
‘after-life’? 
But what comes ‘after life’? Is it death, decay, and 
decomposition, or is it resurrection and regeneration? Is it, 
in biological terms, the transformation of the living into the 
non-living, from the organic life of molecules to non-organic 
matter? Or does it involve a theological re-vitalization of 
the resurrected, living cadaver? In either case, the after-life 
bears some relation to the ‘during life’ and the ‘before life’, 
and it is precisely the ambiguity of these relationships that 
has shaped the debates on mechanism and vitalism in the 
philosophy of biology, as well as the earlier debates in Scho­
lasticism on the nature of creaturely life. 
There is no better guide to the after-life than Dante. The 
life of the after-life in the Commedia is a political theology, 
at once rigidly structured and yet coursing with masses of 
bodies, limbs, fluids, fires, rivers, minerals, and geometric 
patterns of beatific light. In particular, the Inferno gives us

‘I am a living contradiction.’ Such phrases denoting a living-
death recur in the Inferno, often spoken by Dante himself.4 
Perhaps, then, this phrase ‘What I was once, alive, I am still 
now’ actually means – in the afterlife – that ‘I am still living, 
even in death.’ This living contradiction – being living dead 
– is also linked to the political-theological contradiction 
of a power that at once ‘shuts down’ as much as it ‘lets 
flow’. There is a kind of Medieval biopolitics in the Inferno 
quite different from the modern, Foucauldian version. 
The strange conjunction of sovereignty and multiplicity in 
the Inferno does not demand the punishment of souls, but 
instead requires a mass of animated, sensate, living bodies, 
in some cases resulting in an almost medicalized concept of 
the after-life (e.g. the Sowers of Discord are meticulously 
dismembered, dissected, and anatomized). In tandem with 
a sovereign ‘shutting-down’ we have also a kind of govern­
mental ‘letting-flow’; indeed, at several points the Inferno 
seems to imply their isomorphism.
Blasphemy, then, can be viewed in this regard as the 
assertion of living contradiction. But this assertion is not 
simply a resistance to an authoritative demand to be non-
contradictory. In its modern variants it strives to become 
an ontological principle as well. Nowhere is this more 
evident than in the ‘weird biologies’ of H.P. Lovecraft’s 
At the Mountains of Madness.5 The narrative describes two 
kinds of blasphemous life. The first involves the discovery 
of unknown fossils and a ‘Cyclopean city’ in the deep 
Antarctic, both of which display ‘monstrous perversions of

which the bodies of the damned are fused with dead trees 
(watched over by the Harpies). Within many of the circles, 
Dante encounters nothing but multiplicity – bustling crowds 
(the Vestibule of the Indecisive), a cyclone of impassioned 
bodies (Circle II, the Lustful), a sea of bodies devouring 
each other (Circle IV, the Wrathful), dismembered bodies 
(Circle VIII, the Sowers of Discord), and a field of bodies 
ridden with leprosy (Circle VIII, the Falsifiers). The life-
after-life is not only a life of multiplicity, but it is also a life 
in which the very concept of life continually negates itself, 
a kind of vitalistic life-negation that results in the living dead 
‘citizens’ of the City of Dis.
Perhaps, then, one should begin not by thinking about 
any essence or principle of life, but by thinking about a 
certain negation of life, a kind of life-after-life in which the 
‘after’ is not temporal or sequential, but liminal.
2. Blasphemous Life
But we’ve forgotten about blasphemy. What is 
blasphemy in regard to the forms of life-negation found 
in the Inferno? Returning to the burning desert, Capaneus, 
noticing Dante’s inquiring gaze, shouts back to him: ‘What I 
was once, alive, I still am, dead!’2 On one level this is simply 
a descriptive statement – defiant towards divine sovereignty 
in life, I remain so in the after-life. But surely Capaneus 
realizes that, after life, resistance is futile?3 Or have the 
terms changed, after life? Perhaps his words do not mean 
‘I am still defiant’ but rather, quite literally, something like 
2. XIV, 51. An alternate edition by Mandelbaum translates ‘Qual io fui vivo, tal son 
morto’ thus: ‘That which I was in life, I am in death.’

words becoming his own punishment.

to those bodies and sparkled less voluminously on a smooth 
part of the accursedly resculptured wall in a series of grouped 
dots – we understood the quality of cosmic fear to its uttermost 
heights.9
What Lovecraft puts forth in his tales of cosmic horror 
is a form of blasphemy that is decidedly non-anthropomor­
phic and misanthropic. At the mountains of madness we 
move from a concept of blasphemy as grounded in human 
agency (the blasphemy of Capaneus in the underworld) to a 
blasphemy of the unhuman (‘more and more amphibious’). 
For Lovecraft, ‘it’ is blasphemous – but also indifferent, 
incomprehensible, and in many cases unnamable (‘the 
thing’, ‘the doom’, ‘the fear’, ‘the whisperer’). 
At the center of blasphemous life is this idea of the 
living contradiction. Blasphemous life is the life that is living but 
that should not be living. This contradiction is not a contra­
diction in terms of medical science; the blasphemous life 
can often be scientifically explained and yet remain utterly 
incomprehensible. If it is a logical contradiction, it would 
have to be one in which the existence of true contradictions 
would not only be admitted, but would be foundational to 
any ontology. In logical terms, the assertion that there are 
true contradictions is often referred to as ‘dialetheism’.10 But 
with Lovecraft we have a twist. The Shoggoths are bizarre 
examples of dialethic biologies, contradictions that are living 
precisely because they are contradictory, or ‘blasphemous’.
9. Ibid., 331.
10. In its simplest form, dialetheism argues that for any proposition X, both X and 
not-X are true. Dialetheism therefore works against the Law of Non-Contradiction 
(articulated in Aristotle’s Metaphysics Gamma), but, in order to avoid accepting 
absolute relativism, it must also accept some form of paraconsistent logic. For more

geometrical laws’.6 The discovery leads to the remains of an 
unrecognizable, intelligent species of ‘Old Ones’ that, in the 
Lovecraftian mythos, are thought to have lived eons prior 
to the earliest known human fossilized data.7 
But this only leads to a further revelation, in which 
the explorers discover another type of life which they call 
the Shoggoths and which seem to resemble formless yet 
geometric patterns: ‘viscous agglutinations of bubbling 
cells – rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and 
ductile – slaves of suggestion, builders of cities – more and 
more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more 
amphibious, more and more imitative [...] ’8 In Lovecraft’s 
inimitable prose, the Shoggoths are the alterity of alterity, 
the species-of-no-species, the biological empty set. When 
they are discovered to still be alive, they are described 
sometimes as formless, black ooze, and sometimes as math­
ematical patterns of organic ‘dots’, and sometimes as a 
hurling mass of viscous eyes. Formless, abstract, faceless. 
In an oft-referenced passage, what the narrator expresses is 
the horizon of the ability of the human characters to think 
this kind of ‘life’:

tively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those

However, while it has become customary to view 
epidemics in light of post-germ-theory ‘autoimmuni­
tary’ boundary disputes, there is a more fundamental 
problem articulated in the pre-modern concept of plague 
and pestilence, where biology and theology are always 
intertwined in the concepts of contagion, corruption, and 
pollution.12 One of the central concerns of chroniclers 
of the Black Death was that of causation, and how that 
causation was interpreted in relation to the divine.13 As 
the Black Death spread throughout Medieval Europe, the 
motif of the ‘angry God’ recurs in many of the chronicles, 
both fictional and non-fictional. It forms a key framing-tool 
for Boccaccio’s Decameron, is a motif in Piers Plowman, and 
it shapes the sub-genre of plague pamphlets in England.14 
These in turn make reference to the examples of Biblical 
plague, of which the most well-known is the Ten Plagues 
of Egypt, in which God sends down ten ‘plagues’ to 
persuade the Egyptian pharaoh the free the Jewish people.15 
12. A great deal of the cultural theory surrounding epidemics has focused on its 
modern, germ-theory context. Emily Martin’s Flexible Bodies (Boston: Beacon, 1994) 
and Laura Otis’ Membranes (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000), 
provide views from anthropology and literary studies, respectively. Jacques Derrida 
noted the way in which political conceptualizations of the enemy have, in a post-9/11 
era, centered around autoimmune disorders, in which the threat comes from within. 
See Giovanna Borradori and Jacques Derrida, ‘Autoimmunity: Real and Symbolic 
Suicides – a Dialogue with Jacques Derrida’, in Philosophy in a Time of Terror (Chicago: 
University of Chicago Press, 2003). However, there is as much to learn from the pre-
modern discourse of plague and pestilence, which often de-emphasizes the ontology 
of interior-exterior in favor of a theology of life and life-after-life.
13. For a survey, see the collection Epidemics and Ideas: Essays on the Historical Perception 
of Pestilence, edited by Terrence Ranger and Paul Slack (Cambridge University Press, 
1992).
14. A particularly good example in this regard is William Bullein’s mid-sixteenth 
century plague pamphlet, A Dialogue Against the Fever Pestilence.
15. Exodus 7:14-12:42.
Whereas for Dante the blasphemous is the living 
contradiction – to be living in death, to be living after life 
– for Lovecraft the blasphemous is the very inability to 
think ‘life’ as a concept at all. Blasphemy is here rendered 
as the unthinkable. To account for such blasphemous life, 
one would have to either compromise existing categories of 
thought, or entertain contradictory notions such as ‘living 
numbers’ or ‘pathological life’.
3. Ambient Plague
The anonymous ‘it’ of blasphemy is also expressed 
in the hermeneutics of plague and pestilence. Our very 
concepts regarding the disaster already betray a profound 
anxiety. That some disasters are ‘natural’ while others are 
not implies a hypothetical line between the disaster that can 
be prevented (and thus controlled), and the disaster that 
cannot. The case of infectious diseases is similar, except 
that the agency or the activity of this ‘biological disaster’ 
courses through human beings themselves – within bodies, 
between bodies, and through the networks of global transit 
and exchange that form bodies politic. In the U.S., the 
two-fold conceptual apparatus of ‘emerging infectious 
diseases’ (naturally-caused) and ‘biodefense’ (artificially-
caused) cloaks a generalized militarization of public health. 
More fundamentally, when it becomes increasingly more 
difficult to discern the epidemic from the bioweapon, entire 
relations of enmity are re-cast. The threat is not simply 
an enemy nation or terrorist group, the threat is itself 
biological; biological life itself becomes the absolute enemy. 
Life is weaponized against Life, resulting in an ambient 
Angst towards the biological domain itself.11

Creator and creatures as pathological, a divine sovereign 
that emanates itself through a miasmatic diffusion of decay. 
But what is being emanated here is not creation itself but 
rather its opposite, a kind of de-creation that occupies the 
underside of what Aristotle called ‘passing away’ (disease, 
decay, decomposition).18 This strange type of life, that 
seems to emanate from a Neoplatonic One and diffuse itself 
throughout creaturely life, cannot be understood without 
taking into account another element. As varied as the 
Medieval accounts of plague and pestilence are, one of the 
common motifs, along with the angry God, is that of plague 
and pestilence as a divine weapon. The divine sovereign 
doesn’t simply pass judgment; the sovereign weaponizes 
life – the pathological life of ‘plagues’ – and turns it against 
the earthly life of the creature, which is itself a product of 
the divine will. 
Arguably this motif has its roots in antiquity: in Hesiod, 
for instance, we see how Zeus sends the ‘gift’ of plague-
ridden Pandora to Prometheus as a form of retribution; 
likewise The Illiad opens with an angry Apollo sending 
down ‘arrows’ of plague upon the armies of men for their 
disrespect towards the gods. There are earthly instances of 
this as well. An oft-mentioned example in this regard is the 
Medieval practice of catapulting corpses. The primal scene 
in this regard is the fourteenth-century Italian trading post 
at Caffa, on the northern border of the Black Sea. Ongoing 
skirmishes between Italian merchants and Muslim locals 
18. The motif of decay has been picked up most recently by Reza Negarestani, who 
discusses ‘decay as a building process’. In a seminar given at Goldsmiths College, 
Negarestani adopts two approaches to understanding the concept of decay – that 
of mathematics (derived from Scholasticism as it developed at Oxford) and that of 
architecture. There is much to expand upon here, particularly in the relation between 
architecture and resurrection. The ruin may be one conceptual mediation between 
them.
Here the ‘plagues’ do include epidemic disease, but also 
rivers that turn into blood, swarms of insects, tempestual 
storms, and an eclipse. Another, more common reference 
among the Black Death chronicles is apocalyptic. Revelations, 
with its dense and complex symbology, tells of ‘Seven 
Angels’ sent forth to deliver ‘Seven Plagues’ that are to 
be ‘poured’ upon mankind as a form of divine judgment; 
here again the ‘plagues’ range from contagious disease to 
aberrations in livestock, the weather, and the destruction 
of human cities.16
	In all these instances we see this key element: a 
divine sovereign who, in the form of a judgment and/or 
punishment, sends down – or better, emanates – a form of 
miasmatic life that is indissociable from decay, decomposi­
tion, and death. What is noteworthy about the pre-modern 
concept of plague and pestilence is not only its blurring 
of biology and theology, but the profound lability that the 
concepts of plague and pestilence have. In the chronicles 
of the Black Death, plague seems to be at once a separate, 
quasi-vitalized ‘thing’ and yet something that spreads in the 
air, in a person’s breath, on their clothes and belongings, 
even in the glances between people. As one early chronicler 
notes, ‘one infected man could carry the poison to others, 
and infect people and places with the disease by look 
alone’.17
	It is tempting to understand the Medieval hermeneu­
tics of plague and pestilence as Neoplatonic – a supernat­
ural force emanating from a divine centre. However this 
would require that we understand the relation between

4. Nekros
However, it should not be forgotten that the weaponized 
plague always targets a body or bodies. And what, indeed, 
is the target of the living weapon, if not the living target – 
that is, the corpse?
The concept of nekros has two significant meanings in 
classical culture. On the one hand, nekros is the corpse or 
the dead body. In the Odyssey, for instance, when Odysseus 
organizes the funeral rites for one of his companions, it is 
the nekros that is burned at the grave site: ‘Once we’d burned 
the dead man (nekros) and the dead man’s (nekrou) armour,/
heaping his grave-mound, hauling a stone that coped it 
well,/we planted his balanced oar aloft to crown his tomb.’20 
Certainly nekros names the singularity of the departed life, 
or of life recently departed from the body, leaving behind 
a corpse. But this corpse retains something residual of that 
life, insofar as both the corpse and its armor are together 
set upon the grave. We might even say that nekros not 
only names the ‘dead man’, but also the thingness of the 
corpse. In a sense nekros oscillates between the body-minus-
life and the thingness of the corpse, the latter approaching 
the domain of the purely non-living (e.g., the armor as the 
non-living body).
	However the Odyssey also contains another, more 
significant usage of nekros. This comes in the well-known 
passages recounting Odysseus’ journey to the underworld. 
In this scene Odysseus first performs a sacrificial rite that 
calls to the dead, who then emerge from the underworld in 
a kind of slow-motion swarming: 
And once my vows and prayers had invoked the nations of 
the dead (ethnea nekrôn), I took the victims, over the trench I 
20. The Odyssey, trans. Robert Fagles (New York: Penguin), XII.13-15.
led, in one instance, to the catapulting of plague-ridden 
corpses by the latter, over the fortress walls of the former.19
All of this is to suggest that the political theology of 
pestilence is not an issue of shutting-down or ‘walling’. It 
is, certainly, that, but only to an extent. For the pervasive, 
diffuse, and circulatory quality of pestilence – this ‘thing’ or 
‘event’ that is at once a divine emanation and yet a source of 
social and political chaos – raises a more complex problem 
for sovereign power: how to control the pervasiveness of pestilence 
without losing control of the pervasiveness of people. 
But it is not clear in the accounts of chroniclers, or in the 
texts of Boccaccio, Chaucer, or Langland, if pestilence is that 
which causes social and political disorder, or if pestilence is 
continuous with this affective fantasy of total chaos. So we 
have a strange situation in which pestilence, itself super­
naturally caused by a divine, primary sovereign power, 
then elicits a host of exceptional measures by secondary, 
earth-bound sovereign actors, in order to ward off the 
pending and pervasive chaos that pestilence occasions – 
which itself emanates from the primary, divine sovereignty 
– the primum mobile of pestilence, as it were.
19. Here is De Mussis’ account, which is thought by most historians to be second-
hand: ‘The dying Tartars, stunned and stupefied by the immensity of the disaster 
brought about by the disease, and realizing that they had no hope of escape, lost 
interest in the siege. But they ordered corpses to be placed in catapults and lobbed 
into the city in the hope that the intolerable stench would kill everyone inside [...] 
And soon the rotting corpses tainted the air and poisoned the water supply, and the 
stench was so overwhelming that hardly one in several thousand was in a position 
to flee the remains of the Tartar army. No one knew, or could discover, a means of 
defense’. In The Black Death, 17.

form of life was to take place.23 One set of debates centres 
around the problem of the temporality of resurrection. If 
the living, mortal, earthbound body was susceptible to the 
processes of growth and decay, then in what material state 
would the body be resurrected? What kind of life returns? 
Would the resurrected body – the life-after-life – live in 
a state of perpetual stasis (as a kind of ‘living statue’), or 
does it still undergo transformations, either in the form of 
higher perfections, or in terms of a beatific hypergrowth? 
The so-called material continuity debates among Patristic 
thinkers not only highlights the problem of time in relation 
to life and after-life, but it points to a problem that cuts 
across the theological and political domains (for instance, 
when Paul lays out the basic anatomy of the corpus mysticum 
as constituted both by unity and by participation).
Resurrection could be resurrection of the body, the soul, 
or more generally of ‘the dead’. But even theories of the 
resurrection of the soul – as one finds in Origen’s notion 
of a ‘spiritual body’ – still maintain the minimal necessity 
of a body-in-flux. The problems of material continuity are 
also linked to spatial and topological problems concerning 
the material process by which the formless body of decay 
and putrefaction is re-assembled and re-vitalized. The mere 
return of material particles does not constitute resurrec­
tion, for those particles must be either ensouled, renewed, 
or in some way cast anew. And here the almost absurdist 
debates concerning ‘chain consumption’ come into the 
foreground. If the corpse undergoes decay and decompo­
sition into so many particles and non-living matter, if the

Bynum’s study The Resurrection of the Body in Western Christianity, 200-1336 (New York: 
Columbia University Press, 1995).
cut their throats and the dark blood flowed in – and up out of 
Erebus they came, flocking toward me now, the ghosts of the 
dead and gone (nekuôn kataethnêôtôn)21
Here nekros no longer names the corpse, nor even the 
thingness of the corpse. Instead, nekros names something 
alive, or at least vitalized – but in a way fundamentally 
different from the life of zoê. Nekros as the corpse presumes 
a reliable boundary between life and death, whereas nekros 
as ‘the dead’ are characterized by an ambivalent vitalism. 
These dead souls are detained souls, they are immaterial 
yet non-transcendent, a life that at once continues to live 
on but that lives on in a kind of interminable, vacuous, 
immortality. Nekros is thus not the corpse but rather ‘the 
dead’, or the existence of a life-after-life.
But what, if anything, ‘lives on’ after life? Paul provides 
what would become a center of dispute in later theological 
debates over resurrection. The mortal body, like all living 
things, displays an infusion of life-spirit as well as processes 
of growth. ‘But God gives it a body as he has determined, 
and to each kind of seed he gives its own body [...] So also 
is the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is 
perishable, it is raised imperishable [...] It is sown a natural 
body: it is raised a spiritual body.’22 The organicist motif 
of resurrection is that of a seed that is sown in the earth 
and that grows and is animated (or re-animated) into a new 
body, the latter being both the resurrection of the person as 
well as that of the community of the corpus mysticum. 
There is also a great deal of ambiguity in the Pauline 
formula. Patristic thinkers differed on what kind of

limit-experience of ‘absolute otherness’. In gothic fictions, 
the numinous is ephemeral; it can either be revealed to have 
natural and rational causes (as in Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of 
Udolpho), or the supernatural can be affirmed, and its horror 
sublimated into an affirmation of faith (Walpole’s The Castle 
of Otranto) or a descent into damnation (Lewis’s The Monk).
The concept of the numinous is etymologically 
associative to the Kantian concept of noumena. Kant’s own 
re-affirmation of the split between phenomena (the world as it 
appears to the subject) and noumena (the inaccessible world-
in-itself) tended to draw his analyses towards the former 
and away from the latter. Indeed, there is a sense in which 
Kant’s antinomies of pure reason – God, the universe, the 
soul – are pushed so far away from phenomena that they 
begin to occupy a space not that far from noumena.24 And yet 
it is precisely this domain – the anonymous ‘there is’ – that 
has for so long remained a point of attraction for ontology.
Let us consider a conceptual portmanteau, comprising 
the gothic ‘numinous’ (the horror of the divine as absolute 
otherness) and Kantian noumena (the unhuman, anonymous 
‘in itself’). In what sense is the nekros, as ‘the dead’, also a kind 
of nouminous life? A nouminous life would have to articulate 
a conceptual space that is neither that which is lived and 
outside of discourse (the gothic ‘numinous’), nor that which 
is purely reasoned and unlived (the Kantian antinomies). 
We could call this a ‘horror of life’ if such a phrase did 
24. Kant, in the Lectures on Philosophical Theology, notes the following: ‘God knows 
all things as they are in themselves a priori and immediately through an intuitive 
understanding. For he is the being of all beings and every possibility has its ground 
in him. If we were to flatter ourselves so much as to claim that we know the modum 
noumenon, then we would have to be in community with God so as to participate 
immediately in the divine ideas [...] To expect this in the present life is the business 
of mystics and theosophists [...] Fundamentally Spinozism could just as well be called 
a great fanaticism as a form of atheism’ (trans. Allen Wood and Gertrude Clark, 
Cornell University Press, 1978, 86).
corpse is devoured by worms and beasts, and those beasts 
devoured by man, how can the parts or particles of the 
body be re-assembled? (One can imagine a solution to this 
problem offered by Jarry’s Ubu ... ). One partial resolution, 
offered by Tertullian, was to shift emphasis from the matter 
to the form of the resurrected body, so that continuity could 
exist through change. Cannibalism thus does not negate 
continuity, and the living dead can also be the eaten dead.
The theological debates over resurrection point to 
some basic dichotomies: should the organicist model of 
the growth and decay of the natural world (seeds, plants, 
animals) serve as the analogical model for resurrection, 
or are those processes precisely what resurrection aims to 
correct and to ‘heal’? Such questions have to do, in effect, 
with the nature and the supernature of the after-life, or 
better, with the relation between life and a ‘life-plus-some­
thing’ that constitutes the early Medieval theology and later 
Scholastic onto-theology. Insofar as the after-life is related 
in some way – as analogy, as model, as perfection – to 
finite, mortal life, it obtains a certain familiarity that enables 
thinkers such as Origen to talk at length about growth and 
decay in a theological context. But insofar as the after-life is 
a supernatural phenomenon, a divine and sovereign action, 
it remains outside the scope of philosophical and even 
theological inquiry.
How can life – something that is presumably lived – be 
situated at such a point of inaccessibility? Discussing the 
role of the supernatural in the eighteenth-century gothic 
novel, literary critic S.L. Varnado suggests that the aesthetics 
of the gothic novel revolve around a confrontation with 
the divine as an experience of horror. Varnado uses the 
theological term ‘numinous’ to describe this experience, the

films, to Ingmar Bergman’s Through a Glass Darkly, to Dario 
Argento’s now-complete ‘Three Mothers’ trilogy.
If both theology and horror deal with the concept of 
‘life’, then what exactly is this ‘life’ that lies at the limits 
of the thinkable? Aristotle gives us one clue. In the De 
anima Aristotle explicitly thinks the question of life as an 
ontological question, through the concept of psukhê: ‘It must 
be the case then that soul (psukhê) is substance as the form 
of a natural body which potentially has life, and since this 
substance is actuality, soul will be the actuality of such a 
body.’25 There is, to borrow terms that Scholasticism would 
favor, an ‘ensoulment’ or animation that thus takes place 
in hylomorphism, a process through which life is literally 
formed (or in-formed ... and sometimes de-formed).
However Aristotle gives us a slightly different picture in 
the De Generatione et Corruptione. Here the central question is 
not about any principle of life, but rather about the problem 
of morphology. Aristotle asks, how are ‘coming-to-be’ and 
‘passing-away’ different from alteration in general? Are 
growth and decay merely examples of the larger genre of 
change in itself? This in turn leads to a more fundamental 
question regarding the domain of the living: ‘What is that 
which grows’?’26
Aristotle’s approach is to distinguish between different 
modalities of change. There are, first, the processes of 
alteration, which are qualitative (one thinks of a tree 
sprouting branches or an animal growing fur – the tree 
or animal remains the same kind of tree or animal).

not bring with it undue anthropomorphic and even exis­
tentialist connotations. Perhaps we can say that, if the life-
after-life is a nouminous life, it is because it elicits a noumenal 
horror that is the horror of a life that indifferently ‘lives on’.

5. The Spirit of Biology
The relationship between theology and horror in the 
West invites a number of superficial comparisons: in the 
Eucharist there is both cannibalism and vampirism; in the 
Jewish and Christian apocalyptic traditions the realization 
of the City of God always entails resurrection of the dead; 
and in numerous instances the New Testament portrays 
the various demons and demonic possessions that elicit 
the healing powers of the Messiah. Indeed, considering 
the extent to which genre horror deals with the themes of 
death, resurrection, and the divine and demonic, one could 
argue that genre horror is a secular, cultural expression of 
theological concerns. 
If we look more closely, however, we see that in many 
instances it is a concept of ‘life’ that mediates between 
theology and horror. We can even imagine our theologians 
carefully watching the classics of early twentieth-century 
horror film: the relation between the natural and the 
supernatural (Aquinas watching The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari); 
the distinction or non-distinction between human and 
beast (Augustine watching The Wolf Man or Cat People); 
the coherence or incoherence of the corpus mysticum (Paul 
watching Revolt of the Zombies or I Bury the Living); the 
problem of the afterlife (Dante watching the Italian silent 
film version of L’Inferno). But one need not imagine such 
scenarios, for many so-called art-horror films deal with 
such issues, from David Cronenberg’s early ‘tissue horror’

instance of the living. Let us say that the former is ‘the 
living’, while the latter is ‘Life’ (capital L). If the living are 
particular manifestations of Life (or that-which-is-living), 
then Life in itself is never simply this or that instance of 
the living, but something like a principle of life (or that-by-
which-the-living-is-living). This fissure between Life and the 
living is Aristotelian in origin, but the fissure only becomes 
apparent in particular instances – we see it in the Scholastic 
attempt to conceptualize ‘spiritual creatures’, we see it in 
the problem of the life-after-life of resurrection, and we also 
see it in natural philosophy and the attempts to account for 
teratological anomalies and aberrations.
However, the most instructive examples come from 
classical horror film, in particular the ‘creature features’ 
of film studios such as Universal or RKO. The prolifera­
tion of living contradictions in horror film constitutes our 
modern bestiary. Let us consider a hagiography of life in 
the relation between theology and horror. The living dead, 
the undead, the demon-beast, and the phantasm. Each of 
these are repudiations of life, but not their full negation. Life 
is repudiated in favor of an ambivalent and ‘nouminous’ 
after-life. Each also takes up a certain relation between 
life and the political, centered around a key concept that 
structures its own genre conventions. The table overleaf 
provides a brief summary.
There are also the processes of coming-to-be and passing-
away, which are substantial changes (as when one animal 
is eaten by another animal, the former undergoing modi­
fication in substance). Finally, there are the processes of 
growth and decay, which can involve changes in magnitude 
(growing larger or smaller).27 Now, while the first two are 
general processes of change that occur in the living and 
non-living, Aristotle implies that growth and decay are 
exclusive to the domain of the living. Why is this? One 
of the reasons Aristotle provides is that growth and decay, 
though exclusive to the living, fundamentally have to 
do with changes across the substance of the living and 
non-living, changes that may be due to ‘the accession of 
something, which is called food’ and is said to be ‘contrary 
to flesh’, and that involves the ‘transformation of this food 
into the same form as that of flesh’.28 
To Aristotle’s example of nutrition we might also include 
the processes of decay and decomposition, the reverse 
passage of nekros into non-living matter. Food for worms ... 
But might we also include another passage, that of nekros 
into the life-after-life? What sort of change would this be 
– alteration, coming-to-be/passing-away, or growth/decay? 
Would this constitute a kind of biology of spiritual transfor­
mation, or would it constitute the ‘spirit of biology’?
What horror explicitly thinks, theology implicitly 
admits: a profound fissure at the heart of the concept of 
‘life’. Life is at once this or that particular instance of the 
living, but also that which is common to each and every 
27. ‘We must explain (i) wherein growth differs from coming-to-be and from 
alteration’, and (ii) what is the process of growing and the process of diminishing in 
each and all of the things that grow and diminish’ (Ibid., I.5.320a.9-12, 485).

6. Univocal Creatures
One of the peculiarities of Aristotle’s De anima is that, 
while it opens with the stated aim of inquiring into the 
‘principle of life’, it quickly bypasses this aim in favor of 
detailed analyses of the natural world, the senses, and the 
intellect. What ostensibly begins with an investigation into 
the ontology of zoê ends with a rather opaque meditation on 
nous. It is almost as if Aristotle discovers that the question of 
‘life’ can only be ontological if it ceases to be a question of 
life-as-such. This has also coloured later glosses on the text, 
such as those by Averröes and Aquinas, whose commen­
taries are themselves characterized by this shift.29 
	In Book II, however, Aristotle makes some important 
distinctions. After having offered the concept of psukhê as 
the life-principle, Aristotle distinguishes between different 
types of psukhê – that is, that psukhê is itself manifested in a 
range of specific forms. As is well-known, Aristotle distin­
guishes between plants, animals, and humans, based on 
the manifestation of psukhê or the life-form that governs 
them. While plants are characterized by a nutritive psukhê, 
animals are characterized by a sensory and motile psukhê, 
and humans by a reasoning or intellective psukhê. This 
forms an ascending order, for whereas plants are governed 
by nutrition, they can neither move nor think. The same 
follows for animals, since they lack reason.
	The Aristotelian distinction was, of course, surpassed 
by the growth of natural history and, later, the emergence 
of a separate field of biology. But while the modern life 
sciences have analyzed the domain of the living down to 
29. Averröes’ notion of the ‘material Intellect’, as well as the Thomist distinction 
between existence and essence, can be regarded as attempts to smooth over the 
transition in the De anima between the question of ‘life’ and the question of thought.

Tables such as this obviously have their limitations. 
But one thing to note is that in each case we have a form 
of life that at once repudiates ‘life itself’ for some form of 
after-life. Each of these figures are literally living contra­
dictions. The zombie is the animated corpse, the vampire 
is the decadence of immortality, the demon is at once a 
supernatural being and a lowly beast, and the specter exists 
through materializations of its immateriality. And, in each 
case, the form of after-life works towards a concept of life 
that is itself constituted by a privation or a negation, a ‘life-
minus-something’; the basic Aristotelian (and Hippocratic) 
concepts of flesh, blood, meat, and spirit are paradoxically 
living but without life. In this sense, horror expresses the logic of 
incommensurability between Life and the living.

between two approaches, that of equivocity and that of 
univocity. In the first, there is no relation between creature 
and Creator, and the divine remains forever outside the 
possibility of being thought. In the second – univocity 
– there is a relation of continuity between creature and 
Creation, such that, in extreme cases, the latter can be said 
to be co-existent with and immanent in the former. The 
problems with each, from Aquinas’ position, are easy to 
see. While equivocity forecloses any possibility of thinking 
or experiencing the divine, univocity makes it too easy, in 
effect flattening the divine onto nature. As is well-known, 
the solution offered by Aquinas is that of analogy. Between 
no relation (equivocity) and pure relation (univocity), there 
is partial relation, or analogy. Thus the creature is analogous 
to the Creator, their difference articulated in the form of 
degrees of perfection (‘proportion’ and ‘proportionality’). 
The creature is the life that is less-than-divine, the Creator 
is the life that is more-than-the-living. 
Might we also then say that, for Aquinas, the living are 
analogously related to Life? Aristotle’s question of ‘life’ and 
the life-principle cannot be asked of Life as such. It can only 
be asked of the living, of something ‘beyond’ the living or 
that forms the living. But then we would have to consider 
‘life’ in general as a kind of negative concept, a concept that 
at once asserts its asking as it recedes into the background 
of this question.
	This negative concept of life is ontologized along two 
axes. The first is predicated on ontological difference. It 
posits a distinction, as we noted previously, between ‘Life’ 
and ‘the living’. The De anima posits psukhê as a general 
life-principle, but at the same time distinguishes it from 
particular instances of the living in plant, animal, and human 
the smallest molecule, the Aristotelian concept of a ‘life 
principle’ remains contested terrain.30 In particular, one 
issue left unresolved in the De anima has to do with the 
concept of psukhê itself. Is there one, univocal psukhê that 
cuts across different domains of the living? Does psukhê in 
effect emanate from its ideal center towards the multitude 
of individual life forms? Or is there a psukhê that is proper to 
each individual, constituting a kind of propriety to psukhê?
	The Scholastic reception of Aristotle offers a number 
of responses, and, ironically, forms an important chapter 
in the philosophy of biology. However, before Aristotle’s 
‘biological’ works make their appearance in the twelfth 
century via Arabic translations, there were already attempts 
to indirectly think Life as a name of the divine. The 
creature, emblematic of the domain of the living, is always a 
symptom. It is an effect, a product – as Bonaventure would 
put it, a vestigium or ‘footprint’ of the divine. The world of 
the living is a liber creaturae. Life is precisely that which is 
symptomatic of the divine, though it is not of the divine 
itself.
	But it is Aquinas who both synthesizes the various 
positions on the creature and emphasizes that the concept of 
the creature revolves around the relation between Creator 
and creature, supernatural and natural, light and mud. In 
his attempts to wed Aristotelianism with Christian doctrine, 
Aquinas offers a neat summary of what we might call the 
‘creaturely triad’. What is the relation between the creature 
and Creator, between the living and the divine Life that 
make the living possible? Aquinas first sets up a dichotomy 
30. The differing positions of genetic determinism, biocomplexity, developmental 
systems biology, and the various branches of cognitive science today raise these 
questions.

For example, the emergence of a science of pathology – 
what Foucault, discussing pathological anatomy in the early 
nineteenth century, describes as the study of ‘pathological 
life’ – already points to the complicated way in which the 
question of what life is quickly folds onto the notion that life 
is. Foucault identifies several aspects to pathology – is it the 
study of the disease-in-itself, the disease as it is manifested 
in the patient, or the disease within a set of environmental 
conditions? Pathological anatomy signals an innovation 
because it not only posits that decay and decomposition 
are themselves processes of life, but that they exhibit char­
acteristics that make them more than simply the inverse of 
growth, development, or the healthy state. 
With the emergence of modern germ theory (Koch, 
Pasteur), the concept of immunity (Metchnikoff), and an 
epidemiology driven by political economy (Snow’s cholera 
maps of London), the question becomes even more dense: 
not only are there distinct processes of after-life (decay, 
decomposition, putrefaction), but these are abetted by a host 
of life-forms that themselves resist easy classification within 
biology.31 The concept of pathology is an after-life, in so far 
as it asks us to think Aristotle’s distinction between growth 
and decay, coming-to-be and passing-away, in a single 
thought. Today, the study of pathology is often divided along 
sub-disciplinary lines that betray interesting assumptions: 
while virologists bracket the roles of environment and 
transmission, focusing on the pathogenic organism, epide­
miologists black-box the pathogenic organism, emphasizing 
environment and a statistical approach that is biopolitically 
tied to public health.
31. For example, in modern debates over whether viruses are living. For a perceptive 
overview, see Lynn Margulis’ book Symbiotic Planet (New York: Basic Books, 1998).
life. Everything hinges on the relation between Life and the 
living. In the period of high Scholasticism, the spectrum of 
creation, from monotheism to pantheism, from orthodoxy 
to heresy, illustrates the way in which the question of Life 
is never far from the question of the nature of the divine. In 
this sense the De anima is ontologically prior to texts such as 
De Partibus Animalium and Historia Animalium.
	The non-concept of life is also aligned on a second 
axis, on which it is predicated on a distinction between 
a ‘principle of life’ and its corresponding ‘boundaries of 
articulation’ (this is its essence and existence, substance 
and accident). The principle of life may vary quite widely, 
from psukhê to a theological soul, to modern mechanism 
and/or ‘vital spirit’, to contemporary concepts of molecule, 
gene, and information. But it always makes possible one or 
more boundary relations that, when applied to the domain 
of the living, re-affirm the principle of life as essence. Such 
boundaries include, first and foremost, that between the 
living and the non-living. Secondary ones include the 
division between the organic and inorganic, and between 
human and animal.
7. Pathological Immanence
Arguably, the modern concept that has done the most 
to steer the question of life away from ontology has been 
that of the organism. Only when the relation between Life 
and the living can be encapsulated in the architecture of the 
organism, can the question of life emerge from its Scholastic 
hiding place into an epistemologically-rooted ‘life science’.
	But even in the life sciences there are innumerable 
instances of life-beyond-life, instances of ‘the living’ that 
turn back upon the hidden ontological question of Life.

Duns Scotus who plays a pivotal role in the passage between 
the Neoplatonic emphasis on emanation and ‘participation’, 
and Spinoza’s assertion of immanence, encapsulated in his 
famous phrase Deus sive natura (‘God or nature’).32 The very 
problem of creation, and of the relation between Creator 
and creature, must presuppose a relation of continuity, even 
though a ‘formal objective distinction’ can still be made 
between the two: ‘In the concept of a creature, however, 
no notion or species will be found to represent something 
proper to God which is wholly different in nature from 
anything pertaining to a creature.’33 For Duns Scotus (in 
the ‘strong’ reading via Deleuze), nothing can be thought 
through the creature which is not univocally thought of the 
divine; the natural always implicates within itself the super­
natural, life the after-life.
For Deleuze, the central ontological issue is thus 
not that of transcendence vs immanence, but rather of a 
different tension: that between emanence and immanence. 
The former produces immanent effects, but such effects 
emanate from a source that remains above and beyond 
those effects; emanence of effects implies an eminence of 
cause. Not surprisingly, Deleuze favors immanence, in 
which the effect is immanent in the cause. Deleuze expands 
the term ‘expression’, borrowed from Spinoza, to describe 
this creaturely immanence, essentially flattening out the 
32. Scotus, in the Opus oxoniense, notes that ‘a species which can be multiplied in 
more than one individual, is not of itself determined to any certain number of 
individuals but is compatible with an infinity of individuals. This is evident in the 
case of all perishable species. Therefore, if the perfection of necessary existence 
can be multiplied in more than one individual, it is not of itself restricted to any 
certain number, but is compatible with infinity (trans. Allen Wolter, in Duns Scotus: 
Philosophical Writings, Hackett, 1987, I., dist.II, q.iii, 88).
33. Ibid., I, dist. III, q.i, 29.
This last dichotomy is instructive, for it suggests to us 
several forms of after-life. As an organism, as a member 
of ‘the living’, the pathogenic organism (viruses, bacteria, 
fungi) can be situated broadly within the post-Darwinian 
liber creaturae. But, as we know, it is the very nature of such 
organisms to pass between life forms – to pass through, 
to pass between, and even, in cases of genetic mutation, 
to pass beyond. The means by which this is achieved are 
through processes that innately question the autonomy of 
the living organism – infection, transfection, parasitism, 
symbiosis. This in turn opens onto another, quite different 
form of after-life, one where the locality of ‘the living’ 
tends to become unlocalized, diffuse, distributed, and even 
invisible, tending towards an abstract domain in which ‘the 
living’ comes to overlap with ‘Life’.
This is precisely the terrain explored by Deleuze, and 
the point of reference here is the Scholastic concept of 
the creature. A setting of the creaturely life within an ontology of 
immanence – perhaps this is the tension at the heart of Deleuze’s 
own, peculiar form of vitalism. Deleuze’s emphasis on the 
nonorganic life that altogether bypasses biological categori­
sation is often coupled with an equal emphasis on that 
which is alive, and not simply on that which exists. Though 
Deleuze, in his own writings and with Guattari, does make 
frequent references to the history of biology (e.g. the Cuvi­
er-Geoffroy debate, Jacob and genetics, animal ethology), 
it is really in the context of Scholasticism that this type of 
Deleuzian biophilosophy can be identified.
In his lectures at Vincennes, Deleuze will often re-cast the 
Scholastic triad of analogy-equivocity-univocity in terms of 
another triad, that of transcendence-emanence-immanence. 
While Deleuze’s admiration for Spinoza is well-known, it is

the West, then it would seem that Life is always receding 
behind the living. This is the limit of natural philosophy, 
beyond which one must have recourse to either natural 
theology or what Kant calls onto-theology, the system of 
knowledge of the ‘being-of-all-beings’.
	But, in the tradition of Aristotelian natural philosophy, 
Life is not simply the absent center to every instance of the 
living. The relation between Life and the living is that, while 
the former conceptually guarantees the latter, in itself it is 
never available to thought. This, however, does not mean 
that Life is a concept of negation because it is privative, for 
its lack of ‘thisness’ is precisely what exceeds any particular 
instance of the living. If Life has a negative value, then, 
it is because of its superlative nature, because it exceeds 
any instance of the living. Any critique of life would have 
to begin from this presupposition of the superlative nature 
of Life. Life is ‘nothing’ precisely because it is never some 
thing.
	In this sense, philosophical thinking about life borrows 
heavily from the tradition of mystical theology – and in 
particular from the tradition of negative theology. Before 
Anselm offers his famous ontological proof for the existence 
of God (God as ‘that beyond which nothing greater can be 
thought’), the ninth-century Irish philosopher John Scottus 
Eriugena provides one of the most elaborate theories of the 
divine as ‘nothing’ (nihil). Eriugena’s Periphyseon is deeply 
influenced by the apophatic approach of the Pseudo-Diony­
sius. But the Periphyseon applies a dialectical rigor not found 
in the latter’s works. In Book III, Eriugena puts forth a 
notion of the ‘divine darkness’, in which the divine is nihil 
precisely because of its superlative nature: ‘For everything 
that is understood and sensed is nothing else but the 
‘divisions of nature’ first formalized by Eriugena into a 
single, univocal, immanent expression: ‘In the limit Nature 
as a whole is a single Animal in which only the relations 
between the parts vary.’34
If this notion of expressive immanence is, as Badiou 
notes, a ‘vitalist ontology’, is it vitalist because of what it 
says about ‘Life’ or for what it says about ‘the living’? What, 
indeed, does vitalism come to mean in Deleuze’s biophi­
losophy, if not a kind of subtractive vitalism, one that posits 
a creature-without-creation, an emanation-without-center, 
a decay that is growth, and a collapsing of ‘Life’ and ‘the 
living’, a distinction that structures both the Aristotelian 
and Scholastic concepts of life? If pathology broadly names 
one kind of life-after-life (growth-in-decay, coming-to-be in 
passing-away), a pathological immanence would name one 
of the central – unresolved – problematics of Deleuzian 
vitalism: that of the relation between ‘life’ and ‘immanence’. 
If the former presumes some level of dynamic change 
(even if that change occurs immanently), the latter requires 
the existence of a fully actual, non-dynamic diffusion, 
enmeshing, or blanketing. The limit-point, the pathological 
turn, is at that point where immanence becomes so absolute 
that is becomes ambient and pervasive, itself receding into 
a zone of non-life.
8. Life as Non-Being
What is striking about many of the attempts to ontologize 
life is the way in which ‘life’ becomes an always-receding 
horizon. If we accept the Aristotelian distinction between 
Life and the living as structuring the philosophy of life in

York: Zone, 1990), 278.

question of Life as an ontological question:
 [...] in any serious and scientifically minded ‘philosophy of life’ 
(this expression says about as much as the ‘botany of plants’) 
there lies an inexplicit tendency toward understanding the being 
of Da-sein. What strikes us first of all in such a philosophy (and 
this is its fundamental lack) is that ‘life’ itself as a kind of being 
does not become a problem ontologically.36
This ‘missing ontological foundation’ is itself what 
grounds these fields. The question that Life is, is displaced 
by the question of what Life is – or, more accurately, what 
the domain of the living is. The anthropological category 
of man, the psychological category of mind, and a general 
biology of the organism all presume a Being of Life. Where 
Heidegger leaves off, however, is at the question of whether 
Life is a species of Being, or whether the ontology of Life in 
effect transforms Life into Being. His last words on the topic 
are at once suggestive and opaque: ‘Life has its own kind of 
being, but it is essentially accessible only in Da-sein.’37
	One point of entry is to think about non-Life (a non-Life 
that is not Death), and by extension, non-Being (a non-Being 
that is not Nothing). Put another way, the challenge would 
be to think the relation between Life and Being as mediated 
by negation. This is, to be sure, an ancient problem, one 
posed by the presocratics, in the attempt to secure a concep­
tually-sound concept of the One or the Many. At its root is 
the problem – really, the profound ambivalence towards – 
the concept of non-Being. As Levinas notes, in a language 
not too far removed from Eriugena:
36. Being and Time, trans. Joan Stambaugh (Albany: State University of New York 
Press, 1996), §10, 43-44.
37. Ibid., 46.
apparition of what is not apparent, the manifestation of the 
hidden, the affirmation of the negated, the comprehension 
of the incomprehensible [...]’35
To what extent can we say that Life is nihil in this sense? 
Once the ontological difference between ‘Life’ and ‘the 
living’ is collapsed, life subtracts from itself any possibility 
of an affirmation. What remains is a kind of negative 
theology, or better, a negative theo-zoology, whereby 
life always displays some relation to the negation of life. 
Hence the after-life is not about the dichotomy between life 
and death, but about a more fundamental relation – that 
between Life and Being.
	One problem has to do with what happens once the 
concept of ‘Life’ detaches itself from ‘the living’. This 
is a problem implicit in the De anima, where the concept 
of psukhê is sometimes a life-principle, and sometimes a 
stand-in for the being of form itself. In a modern context, 
process philosophy (Bergson, Whitehead) and process 
theology (Chardin, Steiner) likewise reach a zone in which 
‘Life’ becomes convertible with Being – even if the name of 
Life is process or becoming.
	For many, however, all of this is a false problem. The 
opening sections of Being and Time provide what is perhaps the 
clearest statement on this point. There Heidegger effectively 
glosses over the fields of anthropology, psychology, and 
biology as fields which must presume being in order to 
begin their inquiries about man, mind, and organism. 
While each of these fields, according to Heidegger, deals in 
some way with Life, none of them are capable of posing the

9. Anonymous Horror
Granted, there is a certain absurdity in asking about 
the non-being of Life; one might as well inquire into non-
existent creatures ... which is, of course, precisely what the 
domain of supernatural horror does. Horror film is replete 
with examples of the horror of the ‘there is ... ’ The titles 
of such films are telling: The Being, The Creature, The Entity, 
It’s Alive!, It Lives Again, Monster Zero, The Stuff, Them!, The 
Thing, and so on. In these films, the site of horror is not 
simply that of a physically threatening monster, for at least 
these can be given names (Dracula, Frankenstein’s monster, 
Wolf-Man), and thereby included within the sphere of 
moral and theological law. This also means they can be 
destroyed. But what of the creature that cannot be named, 
or that is named in its unnamability? The unnamable 
creature is also the unthinkable creature. This would be 
the B-horror version of Beckett’s L’innomable. In some cases 
the unnamable creature is without form, the intrusion of 
a raging, inverted hylomorphism. Cold War films such as 
The Blob and Caltiki the Immortal Monster exist in a state of 
oozing, abject, borderlessness. In other cases the unnamable 
creature is without matter, existing as pure (demonic) spirit, 
an inverted theophany. In Fiend Without A Face, human 
beings are besieged by immaterial, brainstem-like entities, 
suggesting telepathy as a form of contagion.41 
These films represent a subtle subversion of the classic 
creature-feature by shifting the criteria by which a monster 
is made. Whereas the creature-feature films define the 
monster as an aberration (and abomination) of nature, 
the unnamable creature is an aberration of thought. 
41. In postmodernity this tradition is extended in films such as Mario Bava’s Planet of 
the Vampires, Cronenberg’s Scanners and Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Cure.
When the forms of things are dissolved in the night, the 
darkness of the night, which is neither an object nor the quality 
of an object, invades like a presence [...] But this nothing is 
not that of pure nothingness. There is no longer this or that; 
there is not ‘something’. But this universal absence is in turn a 
presence, an absolutely unavoidable presence [...] There is is an 
impersonal form, like in it rains, or it is warm.38
 Thus the problem of non-Being is not simply that of 
a fear of nothingness or of the vacuum. Rather, it is the 
quite gothic fear of a something whose thingness is under 
question. ‘This impersonal, anonymous, yet indistinguish­
able consummation’ of being, which murmurs in the depths 
of nothingness itself we shall designate by the term there is 
[...] The rustling of the there is [...] is horror.’39 The pinnacle 
of this type of horror – really a kind of concept-horror – is 
the evisceration of all noological interiority: ‘horror turns 
the subjectivity of the subject, his particularity qua entity, 
inside out.’40
	What is the ‘there is’ of Life? Is the concept of Life 
already a ‘there is’, and therefore already enveloped in 
the gothic horror of absolute otherness and pervasive 
anonymity? If ‘Life’, as opposed to ‘the living’, is always 
receding into the anonymous ‘there is’, does this then mean 
that Life is really Life-without-Being?

of thinking. To this we can offer another proposition:
In its traditional onto-theological formulations, 
• 
Life is what is denied of Being. While the latter 
is the domain of the transcendent, the eternal, 
the infinite, the spiritual, and the fully actual, the 
former is subtracted from this – the immanent, 
the temporal, the finite, the material, and the 
virtual.
Life therefore bears some minimal relation to non-Being. 
But this can take several forms. The non-Being of Life can 
be situated either ‘above’ or ‘below’ the scale of the human 
– on the one hand there is the strata of Thomist ‘spiritual 
creatures’ or the strata of Aristotelian creaturely life, while 
on the other hand there is the strata of demonic multitudes 
or the strata of subhuman plague and pestilence. This non-
anthropomorphic and even misanthropic quality of Life 
sustains these strata with a certain inaccessibility. Even 
as Life, in conditioning the living, is able to assert its self-
evident character, it also puts forth its noumenal qualities. 
Kant’s statements concerning the teleology of the natural 
world would have to be qualified: it is because Life is noumenal 
that it is teleological. But this then means that the ‘ends’ of Life 
are also ‘anonymous’.
Any question of the possibility of an ontology of life would 
have to consider ‘life’ as a particular intersection between a 
biology of a non-conceptual life itself and an onto-theology 
of transcendence, emanence, and immanence. The problem 
is that the concept of Life has remained tenaciously non-
conceptual, even as it continues to function in a conceptual, 
even ontological way in contemporary scientific fields 
such as network science, swarm intelligence, and biocom­
plexity. The issue is not that Life cannot think its own 
The classical creature-features still retain an element of 
familiarity, despite the impure mixture of categories (plant 
+ human) or differences in scale (giant reptiles, ants, 
leeches, etc.). Films featuring unnamable creatures, by 
contrast, contextualize the monster in terms of ontology 
(form-without-matter, matter-without-form) or in terms of 
onto-theology (the spiritual abject, the oozing abstraction). 
They point towards a form of life-after-life that highlights 
conceptual aberrations.
	Let us pause for a moment and gather together our 
propositions concerning this concept-horror, or, granting 
ourselves some poetic license, what we can also refer to as 
the ‘teratological noosphere’:
The question of an ontology of life is traditionally 
• 
predicated on a fundamental distinction between 
Life and the living, or, between that-by-which-the-
living-is-living and that-which-is-living.
This distinction is deployed along two axes: One 
• 
which requires a ‘principle-of-life’ to structure all 
manifestations of the living, and another in which 
the living is in turn structured according to various 
‘boundaries of articulation’.
In the context of Scholasticism, the ontology of life 
• 
continually oscillates between a natural philosophy 
of creatures and an onto-theology of the divine 
nature. 
The structure of the concept of life is most often 
• 
that of negative theology.
Each of these propositions structures the basic way in 
which ‘life’ as a concept is thought as such. Each of these also 
contain one or more fissures, one or more ‘heretical’ strands

foundationalism, its own decision. Indeed, this is arguably 
what post-Darwinian biology obsesses over. Rather, the 
issue is that Life as a concept must always presume a further 
question concerning Being. The infamous question ‘What 
is Life?’ appears to be always superseded by the question 
of ‘What is Being?’ And yet the very idea of Life-without-
Being would seem to be an absurdity for philosophy – 
though, as we’ve seen, not for horror.

0. Prologue: the Tentacular Novum
Taking for granted, as we do, its ubiquitous cultural 
debris, it is easy to forget just how radical the Weird was 
at the time of its convulsive birth.1 Its break with previous 
fantastics is vividly clear in its teratology, which renounces 
all folkloric or traditional antecedents. The monsters of high 
Weird are indescribable and formless as well as being and/or 
although they are and/or in so far as they are described with an 
excess of specificity, an accursed share of impossible somatic 
precision; and their constituent bodyparts are dispropor­
tionately insectile/cephalopodic, without mythic resonance. 
The spread of the tentacle – a limb-type with no Gothic 
or traditional precedents (in ‘Western’ aesthetics) – from 
a situation of near total absence in Euro-American tera­
toculture up to the nineteenth century, to one of being the 
default monstrous appendage of today, signals the epochal 
shift to a Weird culture.2

Verne in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1869) and Hugo in 
The Toilers of the Sea (1866) – which include extraordinary 
descriptions of monster cephalopods. These texts, while 
indispensable to the development of the Weird, remain 
in important respects pre-Weird not only temporally but 
thematically, representing contrasting oppositions to the still-
unborn tradition, to varying degrees prefigurations of the 
Weird and attempts pre-emptively to de-Weird it. 
Verne reveals his giant squid6 at the end of a character’s 
careful itemisation of its qualities, qualities which he can 
see, but which we for several paragraphs suppose him to 
be remembering from descriptions (‘Did it not measure 
about six metres? […] was its head not crowned with eight 
tentacles…? [...] were its eyes not extremely prominent 
[…] ?’).7 The animal thus appears pre-mediated by human 
understanding, at the end of a long section detailing the 
history of architeuthology, so that its monstrousness, 
though certainly not denied, is already defined by human 
categorisation. Frisson notwithstanding, the Weird, usually 
implacably Real in Lacanian terms, is preincorporated into 
the symbolic system. 
When he sees it, the narrator Arronax relays the 
sight with a laborious itemised description interrupted by 
pedantic asides (‘Its eight arms, or rather legs, were […] 
implanted on its head, thus giving these animals the name 
6. In fact the animal is, fittingly, slightly evasive of precise taxonomy: it is described 
as a ‘poulpe’, usually translated ‘octopus’, and as ‘calmar’, ‘squid’. Though it seems to 
resemble the latter more than the former, with eight limbs it is lacking the squid’s 
two longer hunting arms. It has also been translated into English as an ‘immense 
cuttlefish’, ‘devil-fish’, and indeed as a ‘poulp’.

The12‘Lovecraft Event’, as Ben Noys invaluably 
understands it,3 is unquestionably the centre of gravity of 
this revolutionary moment; its defining text, Lovecraft’s 
‘The Call of Cthulhu’, published in 1928 in Weird Tales. 
However, Lovecraft’s is certainly not the only haute Weird. 
A good case can be made, for example, that William 
Hope Hodgson, though considerably less influential 
than Lovecraft, is as, or even more, remarkable a Weird 
visionary; and that 1928 can be considered the Weird 
tentacle’s coming of age, Cthulhu (‘monster […] with an 
octopus-like head’) a twenty-first birthday iteration of the 
giant ‘devil-fish’ – octopus – first born to our sight squatting 
malevolently on a wreck in Hodgson’s The Boats of the ‘Glen 
Carrig’, in 1907.4
There are, of course, honoured precursors: French 
writers were early and acute sufferers from Montfort’s 
Syndrome, an obsessive fascination with the cephalopodic.5 
In short order, the two key figures in the French pre-Weird 
tentacular, Jules Verne and Victor Hugo, produced works –

associated, his passage is much closer to haute Weird. Hugo 
counterposes the octopus to the chimera, to underline the 
former’s afolkloric monstrousness. He repeatedly stresses 
the octopus’s taxonomic transgression: it has no claws, but 
deploys vacuum as a weapon; it eats and shits with the same 
orifice (supposedly); it swims and walks and crawls; it is – 
as he stresses with ecstatic Kristevan disgust at the octopus-
as-abject – flaccid, gangrene-like, and, ‘horrifyingly […] soft 
and yielding’.11 The octopus is problematised ontology. 
Hugo is nowhere more Weird than in his admirably 
clear insistence that octopuses, ‘killjoys of the contemplator’, 
demand a rethinking of philosophy.12 There are, nonetheless, 
what one might archly call ‘countervailing tendencies’ 
pulling the passage away from haute Weird (it should go 
without saying that this is genealogy not criticism).
Though distinguished from the chimera, the octopus is 
identified with the Medusa, demon, and, repeatedly, with 
the vampire, reacquainting it, if unstably, with ‘traditional’ 
teratology. The octopus is obsessively depicted as evil – 
indeed, such a ‘perfection of evil’ that its existence is a 
vector of heresies of a double god, a cosmic parity of good 
and evil.13 Although, in a more subterreanean moment of 
French cephalopodia, Lautréamont deploys the octopoid 
to mock moralism, as when ‘legions of winged squid14 
[…] scud swiftly toward the cities of the humans, their 
mission to warn men to change their ways’, a similar 
problematic is evident in Maldoror (1869). Lautréamont’s

of cephalopods’) and questionable exactitude that can only 
undermine the ‘cosmic awe’8 which typifies the Weird 
(‘We could distinctly see the 250 suckers in the form of 
hemispherical capsules […]’). Arronax carefully uses ‘bras’ 
then ‘pieds’ to describe the limbs, rather than his assistant’s 
‘tentacules’: scientism rejects the tentacle. ‘I did not want to 
waste the opportunity of closely studying such a specimen 
of cephalopod’, Arronax tells us. ‘I overcame the horror its 
appearance caused me, picked up a pencil, and began to 
draw it.’9 Verne mounts a pre-emptive rearguard defence of 
a bourgeois ‘scientific rationality’, depicting it as stronger 
than this new bad-numinous. 
Arronax describes his own description as ‘too pallid’, 
and says that only ‘the author of The Toilers of the Sea’ 
could do it justice. The reference is to the extraordinary 
passage in which Hugo’s Gilliat is attacked by a ‘pieuvre’ 
(Guernésiais for octopus), the greatest and strangest of the 
pre-Weird reveries on the tentacular, and favourite for the 
title tout court. The chapter is a visionary rumination on 
the horror of octopus-ness. The creature is described in a 
vomit of aghast and contradictory metaphors and similes: 
‘a rag of cloth’, ‘a rolled-up umbrella’, ‘disease shaped into 
a monstrosity’, ‘a wheel’, ‘a sleeve containing a closed fist’, 
‘birdlime imbued with hate’, ‘a pneumatic machine’ – and 
on and on.10

There is no Vernian rejection of ‘tentacle’: the word and 
its derivations appearing twenty times in the short piece. 
There is no moralism – though horrifying, the monsters 
are predators, not devils. Above all, ‘this extraordinary 
raid from the deeper sea’ is unprecedented, unexpected, 
unexplained, unexplainable – it simply is. All that we who 
suffer this tentacular Event can hope is that they have 
returned ‘to the sunless depths of the middle seas, out of 
which they have so strangely and so mysteriously arisen.’
The 
three 
decades 
between 
the 
Verne/Hugo/
Lautréamont moment and Wells’s saw the Franco-Prussian 
War and the Commune, the so-called ‘Long Depression’ 
of 1873-1896, the rise of ‘new unionism’, and the ‘new 
imperialism’ and murderous ‘scramble for Africa’.17 In­
creasingly visible, especially in the last, the crisis tendencies 
of capitalism would ultimately lead to World War I (to 
the representation of which traditional bogeys were quite 
inadequate). It is the growing proximity of this total crisis – 
kata-culmination of modernity, ultimate rebuke to nostrums 
of bourgeois progress – that is expressed in the shift to the 
morally opaque tentacular and proto-Lovecraftian radical 
Weird of ‘The Sea Raiders’.
Like Wells and unlike Lovecraft, William Hope 
Hodgson was barometric enough to the incipient apocalypse 
to en-monster it before it exploded into the war that killed 
him. In a stunning letter describing the front, he refers to 
what he considered his masterpiece, The Night Land: ‘My 
God, what a Desolation! […] the Infernal Storm that seeps 
for ever, night and day, day and night, across that most 
17. Simultaneous with the increase of its formlessness and historylessness, its 
efficacy as placeholder for the unrepresentable, the octopus’s somatic specificity – its 
spreading tentacles – also saw it increasingly deployed in satire as symbol for the 
‘new imperialism’.
God is confronted by Maldoror ‘changed into an octopus, 
clamp[ing] eight monstrous tentacles about his body’, the 
two now knowing they ‘cannot vanquish each other’.15 
This Manichean tentacular is in sharp contrast with the 
monstrosities of haute Weird, which are impossible to 
translate into such terms – predatory and cosmically 
amoral, but not ‘evil’. If they serve any morally heuristic 
purpose it is precisely to undermine any religiose good/evil 
binary.
Counterintuitively, it is also precisely Hugo’s heady 
itemisation of the octopus’s dreadfulness that pulls against 
its Weirdness. Hugo decries the devilfish as unthinkable 
with what is almost a sermon, that unfolds aghast, yes, but 
without surprise. Hugo’s octopus lurks like a bad conscience, 
a horror that we already know we are inadequate to thinking. 
By contrast, whether one deems it successful, risible, 
both, or something else, Lovecraft’s hysterical insistences 
that nothing like this had ever been seen before, that nothing could 
possibly prepare anyone for such a sight, when his Great Old 
Ones appear, is the narrative actualisation of the Weird-as-
novum, unprecedented, Event. 
In 1896, the other great early adopter of the tentacular, 
H.G. Wells, published the first and neglected haute Weird 
text (despite its author not generally being located in the 
sub-genre, perhaps because of the never-convincing Fabian 
camouflage draped over his bleak numinous). ‘The Sea 
Raiders’ tells of Haploteuthis ferox, a hitherto-unknown and 
aggressively predatory cephalopod which besieges the 
English coast, rising from deep waters to feed on boaters, 
and disappearing again.16

rather than a hallucinatory/nihilist novum. The Great Old 
Ones (Outer Monstrosities, in Hodgson’s formulation)23 
neither haunt nor linger. The Weird is not the return of any 
repressed: though always described as ancient, and half-
recalled by characters from spurious texts, this recruitment 
to invented cultural memory does not avail Weird monsters 
of Gothic’s strategy of revenance, but back-projects their 
radical unremembered alterity into history, to en-Weird 
ontology itself. 
Weird writers were explicit about their anti-Gothic 
sensibility: Blackwood’s camper in ‘The Willows’ 
experiences ‘no ordinary ghostly fear’; Lovecraft stresses 
that the ‘true weird tale’ is characterised by ‘unexplainable 
dread of outer, unknown forces’ rather than by ‘bloody 
bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains according to 
rule’.24 The Weird entities have waited in their catacombs, 
sunken cities and outer circles of space since aeons before 
humanity. If they remain it is from a pre-ancestral time. In 
its very unprecedentedness, paradoxically, Cthulhu is less 
a ghost than the arche-fossil-as-predator. The Weird is if 
anything ab-, not un-, canny.
This must be insisted upon for the heuristic edges of 
the Weird and the hauntological – and indeed of other 
fantastic categories – to stay sharp. Hence the importance of 
‘Geek Critique’, which rebukes, say, Terry Eagleton when

odd miles from where you sit infinitely remote.’18 The Weird 
is here explicitly, in John Clute’s magnificent formulation, 
‘pre-aftermath fiction’.19
The Weird’s unprecedented forms, and its insistence 
on a chaotic, amoral, anthropoperipheral universe, stresses 
the implacable alterity of its aesthetic and concerns. The 
Weird is irreducible. A Weird tentacle does not ‘mean’ the 
Phallus;20 inevitably we will mean with it, of course, but 
fundamentally it does not ‘mean’ at all (perhaps Weird Pulp 
Modernism is the most Blanchotian of literature).

The Weird, then, is starkly opposed to the hauntologi­
cal. Hauntology, a category positing, presuming, implying 
a ‘time out of joint’,21 a present stained with traces of the 
ghostly, the dead-but-unquiet, estranges reality in an almost 
precisely opposite fashion to the Weird: with a radicalised 
uncanny – ‘something which is secretly familiar, which 
has undergone repression and then returned from it’22 –

that the ‘exact shape’ is of enormous importance. 
Briggs and Sullivan are wrong, but their error is not 
merely personal. While we may sympathise with S.T. Joshi 
in finding this use of the term ‘ghost story’ ‘irksome’, his 
deployment of a robust common sense against it – ‘To me 
“ghost story” can mean nothing but a story with a ghost in 
it’29 – does not get at the nature of the problem. Key here 
is Briggs’s justification of her imprecision by claiming that 
the term ‘ghost story’ ‘is being employed with something 
of the latitude that characterizes its general usage’.30 The 
imprecision is that of the culture, and it shifts. 
A quarter-century before Briggs, ‘reasons of simplicity’ 
were sufficient for Penzoldt to ‘use the term “ghost story” also 
for tales of the supernatural that do not deal with a ghost’.31 
Mindful that there is nothing simple about such a decision, 
Briggs by contrast feels the need to justify her own position 
at some length: the looseness of usage is changing. A quar­
ter-century after her, the new common sense has become 
that ghostly ghost stories are ‘a distinct literary form’,32 and 
when Handley asserts her own position, precisely contrary 
to Briggs’s, almost as read but not quite, she takes a moment 
to argue it. Clearly the politics of ghostly specificity has 
shifted markedly, but has not banished all remnants of its 
countertendency – hauntology is haunted by a pre-haunto­
logical taxonomic indeterminacy.

whole culture had fallen in love with the undead’;25 because 
whatever the merits of the rest of his argument, only two of 
those figures are undead, and they are all different. Teratological 
specificity demands attention. And, granting the contro­
versial position that ghosts are teratological subjects, such 
specificities are nowhere more different and important than 
between Weird and hauntological.

evil spirits’ but ‘spirit[s] appearing after death’.26 Some years 
previously, however, two such perspicacious writers as Julia 
Briggs and Jack Sullivan as a matter of policy play fast and 
loose with categories of ghosthood. ‘I am […] compromis­
ing’, Sullivan says. ‘All of these stories are apparitional, in 
one sense or another, and “ghost story” is as good a term as 
any.’27 According to Briggs, ‘the term “ghost story” […] can 
denote not only stories about ghosts, but […] spirits other 
than those of the dead […] To distinguish these from one 
another according to the exact shape adopted by the spirit 
would be an unrewarding exercise.’28 I have argued, rather,

In the early nineteenth century, the explicitly sectarian 
character of that moralism had waned, but the instructional 
nature of hauntings remained. 
Cultural production expressed anxiety over the sclerotic 
arrogance of the Victorian era and its victims, as well as the 
dominant culture’s ideological counterattack, the tendency 
to increased and cruder moralism. Non-mimetic art tends 
to express such frictions particularly vividly, and in the 
nineteenth century we can see the battle for the two souls 
of the ghost in the fictions of Dickens, versus those of the 
man he published,34 Sheridan Le Fanu. 
Dickens thinks nothing of jostling together, in ‘A 
Christmas Carol’, the ghost of a person, Jacob Marley, with 
those of various Christmases. To post-hauntological eyes 
this is a category-error, but Dickens is merely subordinating 
the specifics of the ghost to his extreme and mawkish 
extrapolation of the preceding epoch’s tendency to morally 
‘mean’ with spectrality. In neither ‘The Haunted House’ 
(1859) nor ‘The Haunted Man’ (1848) are the haunts 
revenants of the dead, but ‘of my own innocence’, or a 
doppelganger who performs a selective mnemectomy so 
the story can thumpingly moralise that it is important 
to remember wrong done to us ‘that we may forgive it’. 
Dickens’s ghosts are apotheoses of the instructional ghosts 
of the preceding century – out of time, rearguard in their 
sentimentality, themselves haunted by the future. They 
are not so much convincing, morally, as performatively 
flourished. These are not modern ghosts, but the last, 
already-dead walking dead of a dead epoch, bobbed about 
on sticks.
34. Le Fanu’s masterly ‘Green Tea’ appearing in All the Year Round in 1869.
At this point in history, describing as a ‘ghost story’ a 
piece about werewolves or vampires, let alone about Shub-
Niggurath or similar, would likely be considered false 
advertising. But it was not always so. In the early twentieth 
century, the terato-taxonomic membrane least breached 
today, that between the Weird and the Hauntological, 
was more likely to be permeated than that between ghosts 
and ‘traditional’ monsters. The self-styled ‘ghost stories’ 
of the 1920s might feature, say, giant flesh-sucking slugs 
(‘Negotium Perambulans’ and ‘And No Bird Sings’, by E.F. 
Benson). 
As Handley points out, a ghost meant to the eighteenth-
century English just what it does to us now: a revenant, not 
some eldritch oozing tentacled thing. At some point after 
1800, however, that distinct ghost-ness of the ghost ebbed 
– temporarily, as it turned out – until by 1910 Hodgson’s 
haute-Weird adventurer Carnacki could without embar­
rassment be described as a ‘Ghost Finder’ in his battles 
with Hog-manifestations of ‘million-mile-long clouds of 
monstrosity’.
It is not so much irony as a constitutive contradic­
tion that it was a few years before that, in the mid-to-late 
nineteenth century, almost precisely in the middle of that 
trajectory of the de-ghosting ghost, that the key works of 
what is now vaunted as a high ghostly, an echt hauntologic, 
the ‘tradition’ of the English ghost story, appeared.
2. Ancestral Spirits
The eighteenth-Century ghost was a revenant who 
tended to moralism and anti-Popish sniping, embodying as 
dread example lessons about virtue, justice, and so on.33

about being crushed to death by the collapse of an old 
grand mansion. When discovered dead, a horrified look 
on his face, his doctor was said to have intoned: ‘I feared 
this. That house fell on him at last.’ The story is tenacious, 
which, in the face of the fact that it is almost certainly 
untrue,36 bespeaks its cultural resonance. Le Fanu’s 
problematic is the crisis and coming fall of the house of 
Victoriana (and of the particular colonial upheavals of 
fading Protestant Ascendancy), and as such foundational 
to what followed; but the present of which it is a vivid 
expression is the fringe of a past, rather than the start of a 
future. His fiction is of end and failure. 
The politics of sensory perception are important. 
Le Fanu, in his masterwork ‘Green Tea’, stresses the 
malevolent inhuman strangeness of the monkey, but also 
that it was incorporeal. This was, in ghost-story terms, not 
‘New Ghostly’ but ‘new traditionalism’, uniting Le Fanu 
with Dickens and other pre-Weird, fabular-logic-wielding 
ghost-smiths. As Victorian ghosts grew more ostentatiously 
moralistic, they decorporealised. (In earlier centuries they 
had moralised and provided the thrills of physicality: they 
were often ‘thought capable of moving material objects 
and of inflicting physical harm […] [and] those who were 
confronted by ghosts believed that they could inflict material 
damage by shooting or stabbing the spirit’.)37 
Central in marking him out as the key figure in this 
peculiar period, later to be designated the birth of a ghost-
nation, Le Fanu’s disciple M.R. James’s ghosts could be 
touched, and touch. 
36. Jim Rockhill, ‘Introduction’, in J Sheridan Le Fanu, Mr Justice Harbottle and Others 
(Ashcroft, BC: Ash-Tree Press, 2004). xii-xv. 
37. Handley, Visions, 9.
Le Fanu’s ghosts, by contrast, in their moral contingency, 
are intimations of disaster.35 Even in his more seemingly 
traditional ‘moral’ stories, such as ‘Mr Justice Harbottle’ 
(1872), the nature of the spectral agents of revenge – their 
inhuman, de-subject-ed strangeness, and the repeated 
intimations that they, victims of injustice, are in hell (‘pallid 
[…] secretly suffering […] glittering eyes and teeth’) makes 
sense according to no moral accounting. In the extraor­
dinary ‘Green Tea’ (1869), the text’s insinuations that 
Jennings’s merciless torment at the hands of the abominable 
monkey spirit is in some way payback – that he is ‘guilty’, 
that he shows ‘shame’, though for what is unknown – read 
as morally obscene. 
The blurring of the Weird with the ghostly is prefigured in 
the auditioning of animal spirits as avatars of the monstrous 
(before the Weird’s demand to be considered cephalopod 
was clear), in the stark and amoral universe, in the proto­
plasmic formlessness of the dying vampire Carmilla (1872), 
in the autotelos of the monster (the monkey in ‘Green Tea’ 
just is). For these reasons it is tempting to agree with Sullivan 
that Le Fanu, rather than the more-usually-cited James, is 
the key revolutionary figure in the so-called ‘traditional’ 
ghost-story that we can now see was a – Weird-inflected – 
‘New Ghostly’. 
However, while his fiction is if anything more vatic 
and perspicacious than James’s (shades of Hodgson and 
Lovecraft), Le Fanu is a towering interstitial figure. The 
popular story of his death is so theoretically kitsch on this 
point that it could have been scripted by a cultural critic. 
Le Fanu was reputedly a martyr to a recurring nightmare

modernity, and a surprising number of his ‘ghosts’ 
manifest through it. The demon in ‘Casting the Runes’ 
bizarrely announces its intent by means of an adver­
tisement in a railway carriage. The attack which the 
runes occasion is brought down quite amorally on 
whoever took them last, according to the deperson­
alised passings-on of bits of paper. The horror is of the 
universal equivalent in mass commodification: the runes 
are Bad Money. Most astonishingly, in ‘The Diary of Mr 
Poynter’, what is haunted is not a scrap of fabric nor the 
materials with which it is made but the design upon it: it is 
the copied design, reprinted with explicitly cutting-edge 
modern techniques, that is the locus for the apparition. 
This is the work of hauntology in the age of mechanical 
reproduction. 
•  James, like the haute Weird, is largely uninterested 
in plot, subordinating it to his invented strangeness. 
Unlike Lovecraft, who might simply dispense with it, to 
present Weirdness in pulp bricolage, ‘flashed out’, as he 
puts it, ‘from an accidental piecing together of separated 
things’,40 James goes through the motions of plot; but 
i) his narrative arcs are utterly predictable, and ii) he 
knows this, and repeatedly uses formulations like ‘I 
surely do not need to tell you …’ or ‘It will be redundant 
to conclude…’ or similar. This palpable impatience is 
underlined by his later increasingly epigrammatic and 
sparse stories. And like Borges, when he cannot be 
bothered even with half-hearted narrative, James simply 
describes his ideas freed of it, as in ‘Stories I Have Tried 
to Write’.
40. Lovecraft, ‘The Call of Cthulhu’.
3. The Old New Weird Ghostly
James is regularly cited as a – or the – founder of the 
‘tradition’ of English ghost stories. It is commonplace to 
then wryly point out that James’s ghosts are in fact often 
not ghosts, but inhuman ‘demons’ of one sort or another.38 
Lovecraft stressed that James had ‘invent[ed] a new type 
of ghost’, not ‘pale and stately, and apprehended chiefly 
through the sense of sight’ but ‘lean, dwarfish, and hairy 
– a sluggish, hellish night-abomination midway betwixt 
beast and man – and usually touched before it is seen’.39 In 
the rubble of the Lovecraft Event we can go further: the 
adversaries of James’s stories are disproportionately and 
emphatically Weird.
• Touch and touchability is central. James’s is the 
horror of the physical universe (a trauma that would 
trace into the obsessive materiality/-ism of Lovecraft’s 
horror). It is the cloth-ness of the notorious face ‘of 
crumpled linen’ in ‘Oh Whistle and I’ll Come to You 
My Lad’ that makes it so terrible. James even names one 
of his late stories ‘The Malice of Inanimate Objects’. The 
touchability of his ‘ghosts’ is not a return to that of their 
18th-century cousins: this is a new (Weird) haptos, with 
little to do with human somaticism, and everything to do 
with the horror of matter. The most grotesque moment 
in ‘The Ash Tree’ is the ‘soft plump, like a kitten’, with 
which a just-glimpsed giant spider drops off the bed. 
•  James’s repeated insistence that he is an ‘antiquary’ 
is not convincing. He is acutely conscious of capitalist 
38. See for example Rosemary Pardoe, ‘MR James and the Testament of Solomon’ 
(1999). <http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/ArchiveSolIntro.html>

Nor, though, did he write Weird in any straightfor­
ward sense. James does not have the visionary abandon of 
later haute Weird. His use of more traditional ghosts and/
or occasional folk-ish figures is repeated alongside Weird 
figures that in shortly forthcoming work would be repudia­
tions of them. James’s corpus represents an under-one-roof 
co-existence – that would be all but unsustainable at any but 
that unique fulcrum moment – of what will later be seen to 
be hauntology and the Weird, the oppositional dyad. 
In this context, the key James story is without question 
‘Count Magnus’. Here, the ‘strange form’ from whose hood 
projects ‘the tentacle of a devil-fish’ – a Weird, inhuman, 
Cthulhoid figure who sucks faces from bones – is the servant 
of ‘a man in a long black cloak and broad hat’, a malevolent 
human ghost. This is an astounding crossover, its categoric 
transgression eclipsing any Marvel-DC or Cerebus-meets-
Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtle shenanigans. James creates 
the ultimate tag-team: Hauntology deploys Weird as its sidekick.
4. Jean Painlevé’s Quantum Vampire
There is, in ‘Count Magnus’, and in James in general, 
no aufhebung of the Weird and hauntological. The two are, 
I suggest, in non-dialectical opposition, contrary iterations 
of a single problematic – hence in ‘Count Magnus’ the 
peculiarly literal and arithmetic addition of Weird to haunto­
logical (with the latter privileged, precisely because James 
is, fundamentally, somewhat ghostlier than he is Weird).  
Alongside the fantasist’s urge to literalise and concretise 
problematics, modern – particularly geek – culture is char­
acterised by an accelerating circuit of teratogenesis, new 
monsters endlessly produced and consumed (exemplified in 
commodity form by the innumerable rpg and video-game 
• Most important, of his non-ghost ‘ghosts’, a dispro­
portionate number have appurtenances of the Weird, 
and read now as startlingly teratologically ahead of 
their time. His apparitions are hairy (‘The Diary of Mr 
Poynter’, ‘Canon Alberic’s Scrapbook’), chitinous (‘The 
Ash-Tree’), slimy and/or amphibious (‘The Treasure 
of Abbot Thomas’), totally bizarre (‘The Uncommon 
Prayer-Book’), and more than once, tentacled (‘The 
Treasure of Abbot Thomas’, ‘Count Magnus’).
Today’s ghost stories are, overwhelmingly, exclusively 
hauntological, their figures revenant dead in time out of 
joint.41 This tradition misremembers itself into existence. 
Many of its claimed foundation texts can only be so 
anointed in an act of heroic misrepresentation. Neurotically 
insistent on his own status as a ghost-story writer James 
may have been (the titles of his collections reiterate: Ghost 
Stories of an Antiquary (1904), More Ghost Stories …, (1911), A 
Thin Ghost and Others (1919), A Warning to the Curious and Other 
Ghost Stories (1925)); however, though he is often considered 
to have perfected or inaugurated such hauntological work, 
it is not, for the most interesting part, what defines James’s 
oeuvre. 
41. Of the sixteen stories in the acclaimed recent collection of ‘new ghost stories’ The 
Dark (New York: Tor, 2003), various innovations of approach notwithstanding, there 
is only really one story (‘One Thing About the Night’, by Terry Dowling) in which 
the haunt is not a revenant function of the human (and it is not Weird, but the dark of 
the collection’s title). Even more telling is All Hallows, the journal of the Ghost Story 
Society, that contains, according to its own guidelines, work ‘in the style of the classic 
supernatural tale’, listing James as its first exemplar. Of the 23 stories in a recent 
bumper issue (All Hallows 43, Summer 2007), one contains a hint of the genuinely 
Weird (‘The Reflection’, by S.D. Tullis, haunted both by ghosts and by the ‘wrinkled 
tentacles’ (253) which may have trapped them in a mirror). For the others, two time-
slips and one imp aside, to be a ghost story is, reasonably enough but innovatively, and 
in contradiction to James, definitionally to be a story of a ghost.

bestiaries; by the coquetry with which films hint at and 
protect their ‘monster shot’; by Pokémon, which deployed 
the cultural addiction as its slogan: ‘Gotta catch ’em all!’). 
If the contradiction between Weird and hauntological was 
sublatable, then such drives would surely have led to the 
monstrous embodiment of any putative ‘resolved’ third 
term between Weird and haunt.
Nor is it difficult to imagine what such a synthesis would 
be. The outstanding synecdochic signifier for a revenant 
human dead is the skull – mind-seat now empty-eyed, 
memento mori, grinning, screaming.42 The nonpareil 
iteration of the embodied Weird is the tentacle, and by 
suspiciously perfect chance, the most Weird-ly mutable – 
formless – of all tentacled animals is the octopus, the body of 
which, a bulbous, generally roundish shape distinguished 
by two prominent eyes, is vaguely homologous with a 
human skull. 
The shapes are ready, and take little to combine: the 
Weird-hauntological monster is clearly a tentacled skull 
(see facing page for my own rendition).
Considering the fecundity and vigour of the teratological 
drive, the symbolic resonance of its constituents and their 
apparent topological compatibility for easy crossbreeding, 
the extreme rarity of the skulltopus in culture is mysterious. 
There are a very few examples, but the pickings are astound­
ingly meagre.43 There is clearly something not right about 
42. See for example The Screaming Skull directed by Alex Nichol (1958); F. Marion 
Crawford’s ‘The Screaming Skull’ (in Uncanny Tales, London: T. Fisher Unwin, 
1911).

proportion. The octopus should, with that oozability of 
Weird skin, merge with the skull to become a skulltopus. 
That event is the asymptote of the interaction we see – but 
of course it does not happen, because it cannot. 
Instead, Painlevé shows us the unstable haptic flirtation 
of the two without merger. Those seconds are fleeting – the 
intervening years have distinguished the traditions of 
skull and octopus, and James’s ingenious ‘Count Magnus’ 
solution would be hard to pull off now – but are the heart 
of the film (which otherwise pretends to be about vampire 
bats and ticks). They are the outstanding cultural example 
of the superposition of Weird and hauntological. We cannot 
sustain the skulltopus; as close as we can come is Painlevé’s 
skull-and-octopus-interaction quantum vampire.

5. Neoliberalism, the Skull and the Octopus
Hauntology and Weird are two iterations of the same 
problematic – that of crisis-blasted modernity showing its 
contradictory face, utterly new and traced with remnants, 
chaotic and nihilist and stained with human rebukes. We 
can see these tendencies of the fantastic pulling at each other 
in the years since James, who inaugurates their contrary 
twinned birth, in waves of varying speeds depending on the 
ideological moment. At times one or other iteration might 
be dominant, but neither can ever efface the other. Opposed 
but not separable, the traces of the Weird are inevitably 
sensible in a hauntological work, and vice versa. 
The degree to which one or the other has been stronger 
has affected the tendency towards their separation as genres 
of thought and pulp. Since the 1970s their ‘separateness’ has 
become dominant, not because there is a ‘drive to separate’, 
but as a corollary of the oscillating efficacy of as-simon-
pure-as-possible Weird and/or hauntology, for thinking our 
fraught and oppositional history since the end of Keynes­
ianism, that great Cthulhu-swat and ghostbuster. 
In quick and dirty caricature, with the advent of the 
neoliberal There Is No Alternative, the universe was an 
ineluctable, inhuman, implacable, Weird, place. More 
recently, however, as Eagleton haunto-illiterately points out, 
the ghosts have come back, in numbers, with the spectral 
rebuke that there was an alternative, once, so could be 
again. 
We do not get to choose, however – and why would we 
want to? If we live in a haunted world – and we do – we 
live in a Weird one.

et les pirates tyrrhéniens, describes the baroque details of the 
Etruscans’ punishment. A living man or woman was tied to 
a rotting corpse, face to face, mouth to mouth, limb to limb, 
with an obsessive exactitude in which each part of the body 
corresponded with its matching putrefying counterpart. 
Shackled to their rotting double, the man or woman was 
left to decay. To avoid the starvation of the victim and to 
ensure the rotting bonds between the living and the dead 
were fully established, the Etruscan robbers continued to 
feed the victim appropriately. Only once the superficial 
difference between the corpse and the living body started to 
rot away through the agency of worms, which bridged the 
two bodies, establishing a differential continuity between 
them, did the Etruscans stop feeding the living. Once both 
the living and the dead had turned black through putre­
faction, the Etruscans deemed it appropriate to unshackle 
the bodies, by now combined together, albeit on an infini­
tesimal, vermicular level. Although the blackening of the 
skin indicated the superficial indifferentiation of decay (the 
merging of bodies into a black slime), for the Etruscans 
– executioners gifted with metaphysical literacy and 
alchemical ingenuity – it signalled an ontological exposition 
of the decaying process which had already started from 
within. Also known as the blackening of decay or chemical 
necrosis, nigredo is an internal but outward process in 
which the vermicular differentiation of worms and other 
corpuscles makes itself known in the superficial register 
of decay as that which undifferentiates. For the Etruscan

A Prelude to Putrefaction 
In the eighth book of Aeneid (483-88), Evander 
attributes an outlandishly atrocious form of punishment 
to Mezentius, the Etruscan King. However, it is not Virgil 
who first speaks of this punishment, for before Virgil, 
Cicero cites from Aristotle an analogy which compares the 
twofold composite of the body and soul with the torture 
inflicted by the Etruscan pirates. Revived during the reign 
of the Roman Emperor Marcus Macrinus, the notoriety of 
this atrocity survives antiquity and the Middle Ages. In the 
sixteenth century, the horror of this torture is expressed, 
once again, by a popular emblem called Nupta Contagioso 
showing a woman being tied to a man plagued by syphilis, 
at the King’s order. Widely distributed throughout Europe, 
the emblem continues to reappear in different contexts 
during the Renaissance and even toward the nineteenth 
century. Nupta Contagioso or Nupta Cadavera literally suggests 
a marriage with the diseased or the dead: a forcible 
conjugation with a corpse, and a consummation of marriage 
with the dead as a bride. 
Haunted by the unusually philosophical insinuations 
of this punishment as well as its subtle imagery, to which 
human imagination cannot help contributing, Iamblichus 
and Augustine – like Aristotle – ruminate on the Etruscan 
torture. They both adopt it as something more than a 
fundamental allegory in their philosophies: they see in 
it a metaphysical model that exposes and explains the 
condition(s) of being alive in regard to body, soul and 
intellect.3 Jacques Brunschwig, in his 1963 essay Aristote

undergo necrosis and decay in order to remain in being and 
the Ideas must be founded on an intensive necrosis and an 
extensive decay in order to remain in their essence and to 
synthesize with other Ideas. In other words, this moment 
marks a necessity for Ideas – even the Idea of ontology itself: 
in order to be active intensively and extensively, inwardly 
and outwardly, the Idea must first be fully necrotized and 
blackened on all levels, intensively and extensively.
The following is a disorganized venture – more in line 
with grave robbers and necrophiles than with archaeolo­
gists and scholars of history – to disinter the twist inherent 
to the fragment associated with Aristotle and to delve into 
the moment when, prior to all arrangements and establish­
ments, a pact with putrefaction must be made; the moment 
of nucleation with nigredo, as we must call it.
corpse and released when decay finished its ascension from 
within to the surface. Therefore the so-called climax of the 
punishment – the blackening of the body – coincides with 
the superficial conclusion of decay, the exposition of decay 
on an ontological level.
In a now lost piece, the young Aristotle makes a reference 
to the torture practiced by the Etruscan pirates.4 In that text, 
Aristotle draws a comparison between the soul tethered to 
the body and the living chained to a dead corpse (nekrous):
Aristotle says, that we are punished much as those were 
who once upon a time, when they had fallen into the hands 
of Etruscan robbers, were slain with elaborate cruelty; their 
bodies, the living [corpora viva] with the dead, were bound 
so exactly as possible one against another: so our souls, tied 
together with our bodies as the living fixed upon the dead.5
Whether this fragment points to a Platonic phase in the 
philosophical life of Aristotle or not, it provides us with a 
unique resource for discovering the less explicit ties between 
his Metaphysics and De Anima. Accordingly, it also holds a 
key for understanding the severed ties between Aristotle’s 
philosophy and that of Plato on the one hand and the 
enduring bonds between Aristotle and Scholasticism on 
the other. Yet more ambitiously, this fragment subtly points 
to a moment in philosophy when both the philosophy of 
Ideas and the science of being qua being are fundamen­
tally built upon putrefaction and act in accordance with 
the chemistry of decay. It is the moment when beings must

intimacy, a problematic collusion with the rotting double 
which brings about the possibility of intelligibility within 
an inert cosmos. The intelligibility allotted to the body 
as corpora cadavera by ratios of the intellect (or reasons) – 
each inherent to a different type or gradation of the soul 
– animates the world according to the intellect. Yet in doing 
so, reason reanimates the dead rather than bestowing life 
upon it; for in terms of the Aristotelian body qua cadaver, 
intelligibility is the reanimation of the dead according to 
an external agency. Reason grounds the universe not only 
on a necrophilic intimacy but also in conformity with an 
undead machine imbued with the chemistry of putrefaction 
and nigredo. 
Both in Etruscan torture and in Aristotle’s fragment, 
the living or the soul is tied to the dead or the body face to 
face. The Greco-Roman motif of the mirror is obviously at 
play here; one sees itself as the other, the perfect matching 
double. However, the great chain of philosophers from 
Aristotle to Augustine and beyond only tell us about one 
side of the mirror, shamelessly underestimating the under­
standing of both the living and the dead. They tell us that 
the soul sees itself as the dead party whilst chained to the 
body. But this is surely a ridiculous attempt to unilateralise 
the mirror motif, for not only does the living see itself as 
dead, but the dead also looks into the eyes of the living, and 
its entire body shivers with worms and dread. It is indeed 
ghastly for the living to see itself as dead; but it is true 
horror for the dead to be forced to look at the supposedly 
living, and to see itself as the living dead, the dead animated 
by the spurious living. Neither Aristotle nor Augustine tell 
us about this infliction upon the dead of the burden of the 
living, this molesting of the dead with the animism of the 
Necrophilic Reason 
Aristotle’s fragment regarding the Etruscan torture 
bears a deeply pessimistic irony; it is not the supposedly 
living body which is tethered to a corpse to rot, because it 
is exactly the soul qua living which is bound to a corpse – 
namely, the body. For Aristotle, the soul, as the essence of a 
being, needs a body to perform its special activities, and it 
is the responsibility of the soul to be the act of the intellect 
upon the body. Therefore this necrocratic confinement is 
both the price and a means of having a body as instrument, 
and then using this instrument to govern and eventually 
unite beings. The soul, in this sense, has two activities, 
inward and outward. The outward activity of the soul is the 
actualization of the body according to the active intellect 
(nous) which is immortal; in other words the extensive 
activity of the soul is the animation of the body according 
to the ratio (reason) derived from the nous, the intensive 
and inward activity of the soul. The inward activity of the 
soul is its unitive activity according to the intellect as the 
higher genus of being qua being. The intensive activity of 
the soul is the act of bringing the universe into unison with 
the intellect according to ratio; for this reason, the intensive 
activity of the soul coincides with the enduring of the 
soul in its relation to the intellect, which itself is internal 
to the soul. Here, the intensive and extensive, inward and 
outward activities of the soul must be in accordance with 
one another in order for the world to be intelligible and, in 
its intelligibility, to move toward intellect in proportion to 
reason. 
If the intelligibility of the world must thus imply a 
‘face to face’ coupling of the soul with the body qua dead, 
then intelligibility is the epiphenomenon of a necrophilic

since the body debases its essence – and at the same time 
approaches being qua being by remaining in itself (i.e. by 
ascending in its purity). For Aristotle, only subtraction can 
make such double-headed and simultaneous mobilization 
possible. Aphairesis or subtraction, accordingly, maps the 
vectors of the mobilization and effectuation of reason. Aphairesis 
is thus a procedure whereby the soul can be captured simul­
taneously in the sense of its belongings (or bodies) and in 
its movement toward nous which sheds those belongings as 
it approaches the intellect – an arithmetic formulation of 
the Etruscan metaphysical cruelty.6
The Aristotelian procedure of aphairesis, or subtraction, 
as a formulation for the metaphysical model of intelligible 
ontology, resurfaces explicitly during the Middle Ages – 
especially during the period known as High Scholasticism 
(1250–1350) – creeping beneath metaphysical systems, 
alchemical models and theological creeds. However, before 
affecting scholasticism, Aristotle’s model implicitly exerts its 
forbidden influence on Neo-Platonism, especially through 
apophatic or negative theologians for whom the ineffa­
bility of God must be exposed by aphairesis or abstraction. 
Plotinus states that the reality of the One (hen) cannot be 
explained through the epistemological registers or attributes 
(belongings) which it shares with humans. Therefore, the 
Divine must be stripped of all its belongings by aphairesis, 
6. Aphairesis, as a subtractive correlation between the soul and the body, simultaneously 
offers the soul the capacity of having a body as an instrument or belonging, and the 
opportunity of preserving its ultimate correlation with intellect. Arithmetically, in 
aphairesis or subtraction, the amount that is negated or taken away marks the dying 
correlation of a magnitude with its belongings (as the correlation of the soul with the 
mortal body). The amount that remains after subtraction, however, represents the 
correlation between the remainder and that which continues to remain regardless 
of the magnitude of subtraction. This can be expressed as the undying correlation 
between the soul and the intellect. 
living. It is the Barbarians who formulated and exposed 
the ulterior cruelty of the Etruscan torture in retaliation for 
the Romans’ atrocities: they slaughtered their own cattle, 
disembowelled them and then forced the Romans inside 
the carcasses in such a way that only the talking heads of 
the soldiers protruded. In doing so, they exhibited the farce 
of vitalism by ventriloquising the dead with the living.   
The binding of the soul to the body as a tying of 
the living to the dead is later arithmetically captured by 
Aristotle in the formulation of a metaphysical model which 
is best understood arithmetically, or at least geometrically, 
as scholastic philosophers preferred. In vitalizing matter 
and actualizing it, the soul needs a body as an apparatus by 
which the universe of beings can be led toward the intellect 
which causes the noumenal universe to exist. In order both 
to use and to be used by the body under the direction of the 
intellect, the soul must first remain in itself. And conversely, 
in remaining in itself, the soul must animate the body and 
bring about the synthesis and unification of bodies. In other 
words, in simultaneously governing beings and conducting 
them toward being qua being (higher genera of being), the 
soul must first remain in itself and extend beyond itself. For 
Aristotle, this metaphysical model, the model of intelligible 
ontology, is arithmetically distilled as aphairesis (apo+airein, 
abstraction), a taking away or subtraction. As an Aristo­
telian mathematical procedure, aphairesis consists in two 
vectors of operation, of negative and positive directions in 
regard to each other, in diametric opposition but synergisti­
cally continuous and reinforcing. For aphairesis, as taking 
away or subtraction, emphasises simultaneously removal 
(that which is taken away) and conservation (that which is 
left behind by removal) – the removed and the remainder. 
A soul coupled with the body mixes with the impure –

the first place. Aristotle’s system of metaphysics is thus built 
upon an assumption which has been taken for granted: 
that for every subtraction, there is a possibility of conserva­
tion in the form of a remainder, and for every remainder, 
the possibility of persistence in remaining, i.e. a resistance 
toward further subtraction through remaining in itself. 
The coupling of the soul with the body could indeed 
lead to the instant mortification of the soul, thus eliminating 
the possibility of the soul’s conferring intelligibility on the 
universe. But this is not the case, for the soul remains in 
itself and brings about the possibility of intelligibility. For 
this reason, the possibility of intelligibility is based on the 
possibility having a conserved part or remainder after 
subtraction – that is, the continued possibility of the soul 
after coupling with the dead and being putrefied by its rotting 
double. Only when this possibility is taken as a determin­
able and certain possibility can reason be associated with 
the intelligibility that issues forth from nous. The persistence 
of the soul in conserving its essence, or the determination 
of the One in remaining, certainly wards off the threat of 
becoming the dead qua the body or belonging; but only at 
the cost of becoming intimate or problematically hooked 
up with the dead. We shall now see how the insistence in 
remaining so or conservation in regard to subtraction pushes 
the soul to a more rotten depth of nigredo, and how reason 
exhumes a more problematic intimacy with the nekrous.           
Horror in the Negative 
Subtraction is an economical mobilization of non-be­
longing in two directions: (1) the shedding of belongings 
or extension by means of expendable belongings; 
(2) remaining or intensive resistance against the 
a procedure which takes away all that exists extraneously 
and negatively contributes to all that remains and itself 
progressively diminishes (becoming sublime). Here, the 
conceptual abstraction of aphairesis returns to Aristotle’s 
subtractive model, seeded within his fragment on the 
Etruscan torture: the coupling of the soul with the body 
qua belonging is necessary in order to shed belonging and 
lead toward being qua being. This is so given that being 
qua being is a genus of being which persists and remains 
under any condition or environment synthesized by other 
beings whatsoever. In other words, being qua being is that 
which continues to remain after all belongings are shed, 
removed and taken away. This is what makes aphairesis the 
fundamental procedure in revealing or exposing the One, 
as employed for the most part by neo-Platonists such as 
Plotinus and Proclus. 
Both Aristotle’s and Plotinus’ formulations of aphairesis 
are grounded on one precondition, which can be summarized 
in terms of conservation after subtraction: despite being chained 
to the festering corpse or being subtracted, the soul is able 
to conserve some of itself and render the body intelligible. 
In the same vein, no matter what is taken away from 
the Divine, it will continue to remain as the One already 
there. Correspondingly, if magnitude Y is subtracted from 
magnitude X the result can be either zero, or x (where x 
is a remainder from X). Both Aristotle, in regard to the 
soul vis-à-vis the intellect (as part of the soul which remains 
under any condition), and Plotinus, in regard to the One, 
take conservation of a remainder for granted. The world 
cannot be intelligible and move toward intellect without the 
assumption that the subtraction or mortification of the soul 
by the body does not lead to the total erasure of the soul in

The remainder as an exposed and determinable quantity 
must be hosted by the indeterminable vector continued 
remaining, namely, to remain. The remainder alone as a 
determinable quantity is exposed by what is subtracted, 
but to remain, or in other words, to persist in remaining, 
coincides with the continuation of subtraction – a greater 
and greater subtraction. In short, the more the remaining 
persists, the more it is subtracted, the less the remainder 
gets. Persistence in remaining means to shrink more, 
because the act of remaining coexists with the progression 
of subtraction. To remain is at the same time a persistence 
in subtraction (hence mobilization of the vector that takes 
away belongings) and the continuation of the remainder in 
remaining less. R as the remainder reveals something already 
there, but persistence or continuation in remaining suggests 
insistence on what is always already there and can only be 
perpetuated through rs smaller than R. A system of cosmo­
genesis whose Ideals and infinities have been established 
prior to its building processes – as the ones already there – has 
a certain destiny with regard to the horror genre: Its horror 
stories are inherently concerned with decay even if they 
deal with other themes and dabble in other affairs.     
To provide further clarification as to how the continua­
tion of the remaining or remaining in itself is only possible 
in remaining less – subtractive extension and diminutive 
intention – the procedure of aphairesis can be mathemati­
cally (albeit schematically) demonstrated. Take two 
geometrical magnitudes A and B, where A > B as the Ideal 
ground of the procedure and a guarantee for its continu­
ation (iterative subtraction). The procedure starts by 
subtracting the greatest multiple of the smaller magnitude 
B (henceforth mB) from the greater multiples of the greater 
magnitude A: A – mB = R. The result of the subtraction as 
expendability of belongings. The subtractive procedure 
of aphairesis bifurcates into two directionally opposite but 
synergistic vectors – the extensive and intensive vectors 
of subtraction. The outward and extensive vector of 
subtraction is the one by which belongings are taken away 
or by which the soul can extend beyond itself via a body. 
The latter, however, is the vector of remaining so and as 
such. As the inward vector of subtraction, remaining – or, 
more accurately, the persistence of the remainder – char­
acterizes an intensive vector of subtraction whereby that 
which continues to remain brings about the possibility of 
being qua being or the Ideal. It is the persistence of the soul 
in remaining after its katabatic contact with the body that 
opens up the opportunity of its coming into unison with 
the intellect. Similarly, only that which continues to remain 
despite being stripped of its belongings or attributes can 
eventuate the One (hen) and the Idea of being qua being; 
for once again, being qua being is ‘being in remaining so 
and as such’. To this extent, not only must the soul remain 
after its necromantic contact with the body, but also at 
least a part of it must continue to remain. In other words, 
Aristotle’s model of conservation (viz., having a conserved 
part after subtraction) might be based on the determin­
ability of having a remainder in the first place, but it mainly 
concerns the continuation of the remainder. 
Having a remainder after subtraction is not sufficient 
for the march toward the intellect, or for the exposition 
(explanation) of the Idea of being qua being. The remainder 
must continue to remain – this is the insinuation of the meta­
physical model of conservation. The possibility of the 
remainder is necessary but not sufficient, for its sufficiency 
lies in the possibility of the remainder in remaining.

remainder in remaining (viz., to remain) is submission to 
the de facto reign of putrefaction, the universal of intelli­
gibility and the particular of a problematical openness to 
the dead. For the body which is nourished by the soul, the 
mandatory submission of the soul to decay (diminutio or 
lessening) is in fact the mimesis of the dead by the soul. By 
mimicking the dead, the soul can repose intimately with the 
dead until it is reclaimed through reason by the intellect. 
But the exposition of the intellect is too contingent upon 
its correlation with the soul through reason which is itself 
aligned with decay or the intensive diminution undertaken 
by the soul. Accordingly, to remain as such is equal to 
intensive diminution coupled and differentially connected 
to extensive decay7 – the shriveling soul whose continuity 
extends to the necrotized body through the worms which 
twist in and out of it:
For as the Etruscans are said often to torture captives by 
chaining dead bodies [nekrous] face to face with the living, fitting 
part to part, so the soul seems to be extended throughout and affixed 
to all the sensitive members of the body.8
Mapping the vector of intensive decay or diminution, 
the act of remaining bridges the gap between the 
subtractive extension and the interiorization of no-thing 
7. In medieval literature and painting, the intensive and extensive vectors of decay 
are imagined as a shriveling body from which a cosmic range of other beings emerge. 
While the shriveling body which folds back upon itself visually narrates the intensive 
aspect of decay; worms, corpuscles and other nameless beings which come forth from 
the contracting body stand for the extensive vector of decay. As the inheritor of the 
alchemical tradition, Giordano Bruno sees the intensive decay of the shriveling body 
in the caput mortuum (death’s head) or the residuum of a substance after its attributes 
have been extracted by distillation; while the extensive vector of decay is seen by 
Leibniz as worms which contain smaller worms, ad infinitum.

hitherto a conserved part is the remainder R which is less 
than the smaller magnitude B (R < B). Since the remainder 
R is less than the smaller magnitude B, the procedure is 
continued by subtracting the greatest multiple of the 
remainder R (henceforth nR) from the smaller magnitude 
B: B – nR = r’. The result of the subtraction is again a 
remainder but it is less than the previous remainder (r’ < 
R). The procedure of subtraction (aphairesis) will continue 
in this way to reveal that which remains as the one already 
there. For this reason, the persistence in remaining or the 
act of remaining (to remain) – as the continual result of the 
subtractive operation – can only invest itself in remaining less 
and as ontological decay. The continuity of remaining and 
thus the revelation of the One (already there) and being qua 
being (being in remaining so and as such) is only attainable, 
and must be conducted, through diminution and decay: 
R > r’ > r” > ...

The tenacity of the soul – as an act of the intellect upon 
the body – in conserving its inner parts brings life to the 
universe as an intelligible principle. Yet this insistence on 
survival or remaining introduces decay and nigredo into 
both intelligibility and vitality. The persistence of the

with that which remains, it will be indexed by exhaustion. 
Yet the guarantor cannot be the subject of exhaustion for if it 
were then it could not maintain and guarantee the lessening 
of the remaining, that is to say, the continuity of remaining. 
What is itself consumed cannot sufficiently guarantee the 
exhaustion of that which correlatively succeeds it. 
In short, if the guarantor of remaining is correlated with 
the act of remaining, it will be indexed by exhaustion and 
thus cease to influence. Any disruption in the influence of 
this guarantor induces a discontinuity in the persistence in 
diminution, which in fact is the continuation of remaining. 
Moreover, the guarantor of remaining should not be sought 
in the extensive vector of subtraction by which belongings 
are taken away, because the subtracted magnitude cannot 
influence the fate of remaining magnitude. Therefore, 
not only must this guarantor evade correlation with that 
which remains (something), but it must also inspire the 
act of remaining, or in intensive terms, remaining less 
or diminution. Exterior to the Idea of ontology (namely 
remaining), the guarantor of remaining as such is nothing 
– the impossibility of being correlated either with what is 
removed or with what remains. To this extent, this impos­
sibility of correlation and belongings entails both diachron­
icity and exteriority. The guarantor of remaining – no-thing 
– must be diachronic and external to the remaining, 
otherwise the remaining cannot maintain its continuity, 
whose ontological constitution is anchored by remaining 
less. By approximating no-thing as radical exteriority, the 
remaining can continue to remain and shed its belongings, 
that is to say, it can remain less or remain in itself. 
Remaining in itself is the medium of being qua being and 
hence the medium by which union with the intellect and 
or no remainder. If the soul must conserve the inner parts 
of itself (corresponding to the higher genera of being qua 
being) after coupling with the body, then it must remain 
itself at the same time as extending beyond itself. However, 
as argued above, remaining (as of the soul) is not possible 
except through remaining less, that is to say as intensive 
diminution of the remaining. Yet what is the guarantor of 
remaining per se, or to be exact, what guarantees that the 
remaining shrinks and becomes less? Keeping in mind that 
remaining in itself is remaining less, intensive diminution is 
reinforced by extensive subtraction. The answer is that 
only through the interiorization of nothing qua non-be­
longing, can remaining continue to remain, or to be precise, 
continue to remain less. Without nothing being interiorized 
diachronically within the remaining, the remaining cannot 
continue to become less and thus persist. This nothing qua 
non-belonging cannot be simply equal to the exhaustion 
of the remaining; nor can it be equated with the Idea of 
being qua being (viz., the One) which sheds belongings. 
In other words, nothing as the guarantee of ‘continuation 
in remaining’ is neither the content of the exhaustion, nor 
can it be taken as correlated with the remaining. Interest­
ingly, the reasons for this resistance toward correlation with 
what remains and what is removed lies in the premises of 
the act of remaining – persistence in remaining assumes 
two basic Ideas: diminution or shrinkage, and continuity 
in diminution. Not only must that which remains/survives 
become less, it must also maintain continuity in lessening. 
For this reason, the guarantor of remaining must simul­
taneously be the impetus of the intensive diminution 
and induce a continuity in remaining (in remaining less) 
from outside. The guarantor must be autonomous and 
separate from that which remains, because if correlated

nothing, for only nothing, as the impossibility of belonging, 
can guarantee the continuing shedding of belongings. 
This relation between solution and problem, secured by 
means of the prioritization of nothing, can be explained in 
Aristotelian terms as well: Chained to the body, the soul 
cannot bring the universe into unison with the intellect 
or bring about the possibility of progression toward nous 
(the problem) unless it continues to remain according to an 
inner part of itself, conserving the innermost depths of its 
essence (the solution). Here the solution, which pertains to 
remaining, cannot be correlated with the problem without 
submitting to the priority of nothing or – in terms of the 
soul – the void. The soul must submit to the priority and 
primacy of nothing or the void in order to solve its problem 
in regard to the intellect. 
In short, intensive diminution or remaining less is the 
solution to the problem of remaining, but this solution 
itself must bind the priority and primacy of nothing to the 
fullest extent. In this sense, nothing as exteriority is interi­
orized to provide that which remains with the ontological 
constitution requisite in remaining as such – but only as a 
problematic bond with nothing, which, as the impossibility 
of belonging, cannot be relieved through being captured 
by correlation. If nothing qua non-belonging is uncorrelat­
able, then it is the embracing of nothing by the soul or the 
living that becomes the manifest problematic. In order to 
survive or enlighten with life, the soul must either sleep 
with the dead, or accede to the priority and primacy of the 
void as its internal guide. What could be worse for vitalism 
than at once being animated through a necrophilic alliance, 
and simultaneously, protected under the aegis of the void? 
It is decay that provides the bridge between the latter 
the exposition (revelation) of the One is possible. But this 
medium only takes on its structure in so far as the remaining 
approximates or limitropically approaches no-thing or the 
impossibility of belonging in order to maintain an intensive 
diminution necessary for remaining less or remaining in 
itself. Intensive diminution is in itself synchronous only by 
virtue of its disjunction with a diachronic exteriority which 
ontologically underpins the continuity of the remaining in 
remaining less. 
In order to remain in any instance, first of all nothing, 
as impossibility of belonging, must be prioritized and 
postulated in its exteriority. The reason for this prioriti­
zation of nothing as a non-correlatable exteriority is to 
satisfy the prerequisite ontological status required for effec­
tuation of the remainder in any instance. This prerequisite 
status is the intensive diminution or remaining less, for 
the diminution of the remaining is nothing but remaining 
as such. In subtraction, diminution or intensive decay is 
at the same time a solution to the problem of remaining 
and the very ontological constitution of the remaining 
per se. However, this solution simply cannot work, or in 
other words, is not able to be correlated with its problem, 
unless nothing as radical exteriority is taken as a necessity. 
In order to shed belongings and remain less, the uncorrelat­
able primacy of non-belonging must be affirmed. In other 
words, nothing must be prioritized prior to all arrangements 
and establishments of the remainder.
Accordingly, something that remains, or something in 
general – as that which remains – always testifies to the 
binding or interiorization of nothing as priority and primacy. 
In the persistence of its remaining, the remainder must shed 
its belongings (or remain less) by affirming the primacy of

nothing. Remaining might be a solution in regard to finding 
a medium through which the Ideal can be explained, but 
such a solution brings with it the problems inherent to the 
clandestine alliance with nothing. Persistence under any 
subtractive condition is definitely a fitting solution for the 
revelation of the One and the effectuation of being qua 
being, but this solution was already infested with problems 
which do not belong here. Our survival or continuation 
in remaining is indeed a vitalistic solution, but it is not 
an authentic or genuine one, for it inherently transmits 
an entirely alien set of problems to which it can neither 
correlate nor belong. Survival, in this sense, is the remobi­
lization of problems whose nature is radically detrimental 
to our solutions.
In contrast to the exteriorization of belongings, the 
exteriority of nothing in its primacy is internalized in order 
that the remainder might remain and survive. Remaining 
is a trajectory whose continuity is described by the removal 
of its attributes and belongings, but  whose continuation  is 
guaranteed only by its diminution and decay. To stave off 
the realism of the dead which follows from its coupling with 
the body, the soul disguises its putrefaction as survival; that 
is to say, reformulates the problem of decay according to 
new correlations with its own Ideals and reasons. However, 
in distracting the dead, the soul is exposed to problems 
whose concerns belong neither to the living nor to the 
dead. Katabasis,9 or the descent of the soul, is not radical 
enough, for it conveys the profit-seeking openness of the 
soul to the body as an instrument, an economical openness 
9. In Greco-Roman ritualistic tradition, katabasis refers to a journey which is 
characterized by descent (usually to the underworld). Katabasis is a depthwise and 
pro-ground (profundus) movement; for that reason, in scholastic alchemy, it is often 
associated with nigredo or depthwise and intensive decay.  
(the problematic embracing of nothing) and the former 
(the subtractive bond with the body or belonging). That 
which arises from death can only peacefully repose among 
the dead, as living. 
The interiorization of nothing through which the 
remainder continues to remain and is subjected to 
ontological shrinkage by remaining in itself, deploys a 
subtractive vector which is implicit in remaining. This inter­
nalized or implicit subtractive vector corresponds with the 
persistence of the remainder, or more precisely, it coincides 
with the survival of the remainder in its resistance to the 
explicit subtractive vector through which belongings are 
exteriorized. The medium of survival and its constitution 
are thus, problematically, the implicit apparatus of death. It 
is in this sense that the persistence of that which remains – 
the innermost depth of the soul, the intellect or the One – is 
ultimately indeterminable; for it is not only determined by 
the exteriorization of belongings but also by that nothing to 
which it must implicitly submit in order to remain (less). 
Once the intellect, as the highest genus of being qua being, 
is deprived of its determinability, reason, in its mission to 
redeem the world on behalf of the intellect, reclaims the 
world for a problematic death qua life instead. 
As for Plotinus’ metaphysics, the horror of abstraction 
(aphairesis) is akin to the horror implicit in the Idea of 
ontology or remaining as such: the apogee of the One is 
undermined by another culmination which emphatically 
precedes it, yet cannot be chronically culminated. The 
search for the Ideal turns out to be a sub rosa search for 
the problematic on behalf of nothing, conducted all along 
through the bottom-up chemistry and differential dynamics 
of decay and putrefaction. As we shall see, the guarantor of 
any Idea of persistence,  regardless of its Ideal or telos, is

of diminution and decay whilst fastened to nothing as a 
constitutional primacy. The two necroses of the soul, to this 
extent, can be categorized, as regards of their extensive and 
intensive development (-plication) in metaphysical cruelty 
and nigrescent katabasis, as explicit and implicit necroses of the 
soul. The former – the explicit necrosis of the soul – is the 
coupling with the body qua cadavera in order for the soul to 
extend beyond itself by means of subtracted or necrotized 
belonging (the body). The latter – the implicit necrosis of 
the soul – is entailed by the internalization of nothing in its 
primacy in order to shed belongings and remain in itself. 
The two necroses of the soul upon which the universe and 
intellect are fixed bring about the possibility of ontology as 
a great chain of corpses whose arrangement is determined 
by their explicit and implicit indulgence in necrophilia. 
Aristotle fully exposes the first necrosis only to exploit its 
explicit drama to conceal the second.   
The Idea and the worms 
The subtractive correlation between vitalism and matter, 
we argued, is accomplished by means of explicit necrosis, 
or the soul-body composite according to Aristotle’s system. 
Yet the explicit necrosis is linked to an implicit necrosis 
whose necessity is fully supported and affirmed by reason. 
For the sake of clarity, we shall delineate the nature of the 
second necrosis before moving forward: The subtractive 
correlation between matter and vitalism is intensively 
conducted through a medium which constitutes the very 
Idea of ontology – that is, of remaining so and as such. Yet 
remaining as remaining less – diminution or intensive decay 
– requires a guarantee whereby it can be perpetuated or at 
least made possible in both its lessening and its continuity. 
based on mutual affordability. Yet it is exactly this conser­
vationist affordance of the soul-body composite that causes 
the soul to be cracked open by nothing from within. The 
first descent of the soul is only a twist that opens the soul 
on to an ultimate katabasis where the soul is directly – albeit 
problematically – fettered to nothing, kept alive to rot away 
in and for itself. It is here that Aristotle’s analogy of the 
relation between body and the soul with the tribulation 
imposed by the Etruscan pirates proves to be, if not wrong, 
then problematic; for it sincerely suggests the necrotiza­
tion of the soul by the body only to divert attention from a 
second necrosis, blacker than the first. 
The soul is necrotized in its mission to govern the 
universe and vitalize matter according to the intellect. In full 
conformity with its vitalistic intention, the soul assumes an 
intimacy with nothing: it is invaded by nothing from behind 
(a tergo). The second necrosis of the soul – shrouded in the 
explicit cruelty of the first – is its unbreakable and wilful 
bond contracted with nothing in order to remain, a tie fully 
based on reason. It is only in the second necrosis that the 
climax of the Etruscan torture finds its proper narrative. 
The fastening of the living to the dead is a culmination 
from the perspective of a collective gathering, but surely 
of minor interest when we know that the living, the soul, 
is itself rotting. The real climax of the Etruscan torture, 
for this reason, is the feeding of the living while strapped to 
the dead. It is only this second necrosis that fully suggests 
the culmination of the Etruscan torture: while tethered 
to nothing, the soul qua remainder continues to live, as 
its continuation in remaining (less) is guaranteed by the 
primacy and priority of nothing. Bound to nothing, the 
remainder effectuates the act of remaining in the form

lies in the establishment of an ontological medium which 
not only reinforces subtraction but also remains in itself 
and according to the Ideal. In other words, to settle the 
problem of exposing Ideals, the solution must abide by the 
ontological status of ‘the Ideal as that which withstands any 
subtractive magnitude’. For this reason, the solution must 
be correlated both to subtraction and to the ontological 
medium of the Ideal. Although correlated to subtraction 
from one side, the ontological intension of the solution must 
only correspond to that of the Ideal. Otherwise it undoes 
the problem by dispossessing it of its assumed ground. 
Now, if the ontological intention of the Ideal is indifferent 
to subtraction, then in order to explain the Ideal, the solution 
must expose the continuity of the Ideal in remaining, or 
more accurately, the intractability of the Ideal in regard 
to subtraction. Accordingly, then, remaining in itself – or 
in other words, remaining as such – constitutes the solution. 
However, as argued, in order to expose the Ideal, remaining 
as such must correspond to the act of remaining less, which is 
impossible without the intervention of nothing. Therefore, 
the solution (viz., remaining as an ontological medium) 
radically betrays the Ideal because, firstly, it submits to 
the priority and the primacy of nothing; and secondly, it 
internalizes the disjunctive exteriority of nothing in order to 
realize and authenticate itself. To this extent, if the Ideal is to 
be explained (the problem), the solution must essentially be 
posed on behalf of nothing because only through remaining 
less, or more exactly, decay (the solution), can the Ideal, the 
problem and the solution encompass each other as Idea. As 
the medium cementing the Idea in its most concrete – albeit 
volatile – form, decay or remaining (less) entails nothing on 
both planes of exteriority and interiority because through 
While this guarantor cannot be included by the extensive 
and intensive vectors of subtraction, it can be problemati­
cally posited in such a way that the remaining can maintain 
its diminution and continuity by approaching it as a limit 
process. This guarantor is the impossibility of belonging 
or the disjunctive nothing which, once presupposed by 
the remainder, can impose the continuous shedding of 
belongings. Recall that the shedding of belongings is 
registered extensively as the subtractive extension or exte­
riorization of belongings, and intensively as remaining, or 
more accurately, remaining less. In a similar vein, Plotinus’ 
procedure of aphairesis or abstraction exposes the One 
through remaining as an ontological medium, but in doing 
so it exerts the imposition of nothing or no-one. It is in 
this sense that for both Aristotle and Plotinus, the medium 
of revelation for the Ideal (that which continues to remain 
under any subtractive magnitude) is diminution and 
intensive decay. Yet this is not the only twist inherent to the 
problem of exposing or explaining the Ideal. The second – 
implicit – necrosis brings a far more convoluted twist to the 
assumed correlations between the Ideal, the problem and 
the solution. 
We argued that both the intellect and the One as the 
Ideal posit problems in regard to their ontological status 
(being qua being) as related to the universe or beings. 
Speaking somewhat reductively, part of the problem posited 
by the intellect regards channelling the progression of the 
universe into unison according to reason. Likewise, the 
problem posed by the One is the exposition of the One as 
the Ideal of being qua being – that is to say, the exposition 
of the One as that which is indifferent to, or even resists, 
the subtractive mobilization of belongings. The solution

imposition of nothing as the exposition of the problematic. 
By problematic we mean the submission to the priority 
of nothing in order to effectuate the Idea of something or 
the short-circuiting of ontological intention with the inter­
vention of nothing in order to bring about the possibility 
of ontology. In pursuing the ontological intension of the 
Ideal, the correlation between the solution and the problem 
traffics and imposes the intention of nothing as the implicit 
constitutional necessity and the radical exterior of the Ideal 
and its intention. Correlation, in this sense, is equal to the 
very Idea of twist (flectere), for which inflection (pursuing 
the intension of correlativity) is already a deflection 
(inviting that which is radically exterior to that intention). 
In twisting into something, the correlation between solution 
and problem, twists into nothing; and in twisting into 
nothing such correlation twists back into something. Only 
through these twists in and out can the Idea of something 
be resonant. The correlation between solution and problem 
is effectuated as intensive decay or depthwise putrefaction 
(nigredo), but it is the twist of correlation that makes for 
the peculiarly vermicular sinuosity of implicit putrefaction, 
the second necrosis. If the explicit necrosis, the coupling of 
the soul with the body is differentially consummated by 
worms’ bridging of the dead and the supposedly living, the 
second necrosis or the tie between the soul and the intellect 
is vermicularly completed by the correlation as twist. 
By adhering to remaining so and as such as a fitting 
ontological medium, the One submits to the intension of 
that which bores through it. Once the Idea of correlation is 
established, it refracts toward the problematic and is adopted 
by the Idea of twist. As what necessitates the intervention 
of nothing, the correlation between solution and problem 
the intervention of nothing, the true Idea of remaining can 
be underpinned in its continuity, diminution and being. 
The Idea of something as that which remains or survives 
subtraction even transiently points to the essentially 
duplicitous nature of this intervention. The intervention or 
imposition of nothing in its priority and primacy ensures 
the act of remaining and persistence of something, but at the 
same time this vitalistic triumph takes place by remaining 
less or approximating nothing. To put it differently, the 
imposition of nothing imparts an inherently duplicitous 
nature to the Idea of ontology: remaining is at the same 
time a vitalistic persistence and an intensive decay on the 
part of a problematic intimacy with nothing. Decay conveys 
this duplicity in the most subtle manner where the Idea of 
remaining per se becomes that of remaining less and the Idea of 
ontology as such coincides with the second necrosis. 
Correlated to this double-dealing solution, not only is 
the problem betrayed, but also the Ideal is undermined 
by virtue of its correlation with the problem. Rather than 
securing the Ideal as ground, the correlation between the 
solution (i.e. remaining) and the problem (i.e. explaining 
the Ideal) perforates and ungrounds the Ideal with nothing. 
If the correlation between solution and problem is built 
upon a double-betrayal and the duplicity of solution, then 
such correlation twists itself out of its assumed intension 
rather than terminating it – That is, given that this assumed 
intention is either that of exposing the Ideal or that of effec­
tuating the Idea of something (anything) through remaining. 
The Idea of correlation – that is, the correlation between 
solution and problem – does not need to be terminated so 
that nothing can be imposed. On the contrary, the correlation 
per se is what is fundamentally needed to bring about the

What is at stake here is not reason as glorified tool of 
disclosure or sponsor of quixotic ventures toward the 
intellect, but rather the chameleon nature of reason 
unmasked by the problematic. Bound to the problematic, 
the animation of reason spawns writhing coils, convolu­
tions, bends and ogees – worms, ratios of putrefaction.  
The Idea of survival or the persistence of the remaining 
characterises the problematic both as the Idea of perforation 
between the problem and the Ideal, and as the twist between 
solution and problem. The Ideas of perforation and twist 
are inherent to the machinery of putrefaction and decay for 
which remaining less is persistence in remaining, which in 
turn is insistence upon nothing in the form of the problematic. 
Only through diminution or intensive decay, which binds 
survival to the problematic, can the remaining be posited 
as the solution to the problem of exposing Ideals. Nothing 
inside the Idea or encompassed by it, can invest itself outside 
of decay; putrefaction becomes the generative medium of 
the Idea. In order to be revealed or effectuated, the Ideal 
must not only remain in itself but must also be bound to 
decay. The revelation of any truth whatsoever is conducted 
through decay; but decay is the radically problematic – the 
Idea. In its intensive and implicit form, decay is problematic 
intimacy with nothing qua non-belonging; it is the intensive 
movement of the Idea according to its ontological medium 
and intention. The Idea of persistence in remaining or 
persistence in general immanently points to decay as the 
solution where the continuity of remaining is sponsored by 
nothing; thereby, the problematic imposes itself regardless 
of the objective of the ontological medium and its vitalistic 
impetus. Whether the act of remaining is bound to the 
intention of the Idea, the Ideal, the problem or the solution, 
renders the fate of being something entirely problematic. At the 
same time it makes the destinies of the Ideal, the problem 
and the solution indeterminable in themselves by factoring 
in the exteriority of nothing as another determinant to 
which they have no access and over which they have no 
influence. Given that the destiny of the Ideal is to survive 
at all costs, the destiny of the problem is to expose the 
Ideal and the destiny of the solution is to locate (chorizein) 
an ontological medium that encompasses the problem, the 
Ideal and the solution. In this regard, correlation-as-twist 
is also twist-as-destiny (wyrd). If the Ideal anticipates the 
correlation between the solution and the problem, then 
twist as correlation can also operate under the aegis of the 
Ideal. Corresponding to the explicit and implicit necroses of 
the soul and the Etruscan metaphysical cruelty, correlation 
as twist also operates through two concurrent waves of 
distortion. The explicit twist of correlation is the Idea of 
ontology that is generated under the aegis of nothing qua 
non-belonging or disjunctive exteriority. The implicit twist 
– more insidious than the first – is the problematic interven­
tion of nothing under the shroud of the ontological medium 
or the reign of the Ideal. In this sense, the Ideal becomes 
a necessary excuse to transmit the intention of nothing in 
the form of the problematic. Whether on the side of the 
Idea of ontology or that of nothing, the problematic as twist 
becomes more intricate as each side maintains its position 
by conforming to the reason that either bilaterally or unilat­
erally supports it. As the problematic intertwines with 
reason, it unleashes the problematizing powers inherent to 
reason as a double-dealer. Once reason and the problematic 
copulate, the Idea of reason comes forth as that through 
which nothing can reside outside the pandemonium of 
the problematic either in supporting itself or the other.

extend it beyond itself; it is caused by the profit-seeking or 
economical openness of X to not-X. The second necrosis, 
the persistence of the Idea or the progress in the direction 
of proper perfection by virtue of imposing the primacy and 
priority of nothing; it is entailed by the survival of X or 
the possibility of the Idea in its temporal continuation. The 
Idea in its creativity is the distance between survival and 
openness. By openness we mean the extensive deployment 
of the Idea according to that which does not belong to it; by 
survival, the intensive employment of the Idea according 
to its ontological medium or its proper objective. Whilst 
establishing continuity between openness and survival, 
this distance also posits a subtractive correlation between 
them. 
By virtue of this distance, openness and survival, 
the first and the second necroses negatively reinforce 
and contribute to each other. Through this distance or 
subtractive space, investment in openness contributes to 
survival or remaining which, simultaneously, coincides 
with diminution (remaining less) and closure (remaining in 
itself). Conversely, the immersion in survival is a contribu­
tion to openness, yet it is openness in terms of that which 
does not belong to the Idea (not-X) or is not the subject of 
its survival. Creativity is therefore the art of ratios11 between 
openness and survival, or to be exact, between the first 
and second necroses. The subtractive space or the distance 
between openness and survival maintains the Idea between 
two necroses; but even the two necroses have to encompass 
this space to reinforce each other. The subtractive space 
between openness to the body and remaining according to 
the intellect is defined as the third necrosis; for it is the space 
where only death can enter and death is the only outcome. 
11. Here, the word ‘art’ is employed in its Lullian connotation.  
the problematic is enacted. In short, regardless of what 
shrinkage through remaining entails, the Idea of remaining 
as such always envelops an encounter with nothing under 
the heading of the problematic. 
Mezentiusial Metaphysics
The fact is that every living thing among us suffers the torment 
of Mezentius - that the living perish in the embrace of the dead: 
and although the vital nature enjoys itself and runs things for 
a while, the influence of parts nevertheless gets the upper hand 
not long afterwards, and does so according to the nature of the 
substance and not at all to the nature of the living one.10
 The vitalizing forces of the soul move in the direction 
of two necroses, vectorially opposite but functionally 
synergistic and collusive. The soul is a bicephalous necrosis. 
The extensive deployment of the soul through the body is 
equal to the synthesis of the Idea with that which does not 
belong to it, while the intensive employment of the soul in 
itself and according to the intellect is the necessary intention 
of the Idea. More succinctly, the coupling of the soul with the 
body is the outward and extensive activity of the Idea and 
the soul in itself as the activity of the intellect is the inward 
or intensive activity of the Idea. The outward activity of 
the Idea is marked by contingency, yet its inward activity is 
defined by necessity. Only through the two necroses can the 
necessary and contingent activities of the soul or the Idea 
be correlated to each other. In the same way, the creativity 
of the Idea, as correlation between its contingent / extensive 
and necessary / intensive activities, is only possible through 
the two necroses. The first necrosis couples the Idea (X) 
with that which does not belong to it (not-X) in order to

The third necrosis of the soul or the Idea simultaneously 
binds and unbinds the first and the second necroses; it is 
the effectuation of correlation as subtraction or the impos­
sibility of addition. The third necrosis is the vinculum of 
doom, the bond through which every contribution, every 
investment and every impetus is subtractively – and not 
additively – engendered. Change through subtraction, 
or the mobilization of extensive and intensive vectors in 
regard to each other, is the very Idea of decay.
In its gradation (step-by-step movement) between the 
body, the soul and the intellect, reason aligns with three 
necroses; the truth it confirms is predominantly determined 
by the ternary logic of three deaths. More gravely, with 
regard to the connection between reason and truth, 
whatever necrosis reason invokes, the two other necroses 
will join the gathering. One should not forget that the 
three necroses of the soul are firmly fastened to each other 
in the same way that the three necroses of the Idea are 
subtractively tied together. Accordingly, for reason, there 
is always a crowd of deaths. The movement of reason is 
the enumeration or counting of these deaths. The first, 
second and third necroses, at poles and their in-between: 
‘It is strange’, Reason shrugs; ‘all roads lead to the bosom 
of the dead.’
Fig. 2 (Facing Page): Goya’s Disparates plate no. 7, The ‘Matrimonial’ – or, according 
to a trial proof, ‘Disordered’ – Disparate (folly, nightmare) introduces a curious 
adaptation of Andrea Alciato’s emblem regarding marriage by force to a corpse or 
a man seared with syphilitic scabs. In Goya’s depiction, the coupling of the living 
with a putrid corpse is already a fiendish redundancy, for the supposed living cannot 
come into being other than by being fixed upon a phantom rotting double. When 
the implicit necrosis of the living is extended to the explicit necrosis of the dead, it 
begets a nonhuman deformity, a quadrupedal necrosis each of whose four legs – now 
two – have already been amalgamated by putrefaction.

I love those hospitals, asylums of suffering
Where the elderly, forgotten, slowly turn into organs
Beneath the gazes, mocking and full of indifference
Of junior doctors who scratch themselves, eating bananas.
In their hygienic but nonetheless sordid rooms
You can easily divine the nothingness that stalks them
Especially when, in the morning, they sit up, livid,
And plead with a whine for their first cigarette.
The old know how to weep with a minimum of sound,
They forget thoughts and they forget gestures
They no longer laugh much, and all that remains of them
At the end of a few months, before the final phase,
Are a few phrases, almost always the same:
Thank you I am not hungry my son is coming on Sunday.
I can feel my intestines, my son will come all the same.
And the son is not there, and their hands almost white.
A Life, Small
I felt old very soon after my birth;
Others struggled, desired, sighed;
I felt within myself only a vague regret.
I never had anything resembling a childhood.
Deep in some woods, on a carpet of moss,
Foetid tree trunks survive their leaves;
Around them develops an atmosphere of mourning;
Their skin filthy and black, mushrooms pushing through it.
I have never been any use for anything or to anyone;
A shame – one lives badly when one lives only for oneself.
The slightest movement constitutes a problem,
One feels unhappy and yet generic.
One is obscurely driven, like an animalcule;
Reduced almost to  nothing,  and yet how one suffers!
Carrying along a sort of void
Portable and petty, vaguely ridiculous.
One no longer sees death as a tragic event;
Mostly on principle, from time to time, one laughs;
One tries vainly to accede to contempt.
Then we accept all, and death does the rest.

At the age of seventeen, my sister was very ugly,
In eighth grade they called her double-fatty.
One November morning she jumped in the lake;
But they fished her out; the water was yellow and troubled.
Curled up under the bedspread like an great obese rat,
She dreamt of a serene and barely-conscious life
With no social relations and no hope of a screw,
But tranquil, so gentle, almost evanescent.
The next morning she perceived forms,
Light and fleeting, on the wall to her right.
She said stay with me, I must not sleep;
I see a great Jesus, in the distance, he’s limping.
She said I’m a little scared, but it couldn’t be any worse.
Do you think he’ll come back?  I’ll put on a blouse.
I can see little houses, there’s a whole village;
It’s so lovely, down there. Is it going to hurt?
So many hearts have beaten, already, upon this earth
And the little objects curled up in their cupboards
Recount the sinister and lamentable story
Of those who had no love upon this earth.
The crockery of old bachelors,
The tarnished cutlery of the war-widow
My god! And the handkerchiefs of old spinsters
The insides of cupboards, how cruel life is!
The objects all arranged and life all empty
And the evening meals, the grocers’ leftovers 
TV unwatched, repast without appetite.
Finally illness, making everything more sordid,
And the tired body that mingles with the earth,
The never-loved body that fades away without mystery.

Where is my subtle body?  I feel the night coming on,
Pricked with needles and electric shocks
Noises come from far away into a confined space:
The rumbling city, anecdotal machine.
Tomorrow I’ll go out, I’ll leave my room,
I’ll walk, worn-out, on a dead boulevard,
Summer women, their bodies that arch and curve
Will be renewed amidst fastidious decor.
Tomorrow there will be salades auvergnates
In bustling cafés where managers chew;
Today is Sunday.  May the splendour of God reign!
I just bought myself a rubber doll.
And I see bloody stars flying
I see punctured eyes sliding across the walls;
Mary, mother of God, protect my child!
The night clambers onto me like an unclean beast.
Death is so difficult for old ladies who are too rich
Surrounded by daughters-in-law who call her “sweetie”,
Pressing a silken handkerchief to their magnificent eyes,
Evaluating the paintings and the antique furniture.
I prefer the death of those old people in the tower-blocks
Who still imagine right to the end that they are loved,
Awaiting the arrival of hypothetical sons
Who will pay for a coffin in real fir.
The old, too-rich ladies end up in the cemetery,
Surrounded by cypresses and plastic shrubs
A nice promenade for sexagenarians,
The cypresses smell good and keep away the mosquitoes.
The old people in the tower-blocks end up at the crematorium,
In a little case with a white label.
The building is calm; no-one, even on Sundays,
Disturbs the sleep of the very old black janitor.

Nature
I have no time for those pompous imbeciles
Who go into ecstasies before bunnies’ burrows
Because nature is ugly, tedious and hostile;
It has no message to transmit to humans.
How pleasant, at the wheel of a powerful Mercedes,
To drive through solitary and grandiose places;
Subtly manipulating the gearstick.
You dominate the hills, the rivers, and all things.
The forests, so close, glitter in the sun
And seem to reflect ancient knowledges;
In the depths of their valleys must lie such marvels,
After a few hours you are taken in;
Leaving the car, the irritations begin;
You stumble into the middle of a repugnant mess,
An abject universe, deprived of all meaning
Made of stones and brambles, flies and snakes.
You miss the parking-lots and the smell of petrol,
The serene, gentle glint of the nickel counters;
It’s too late.  It’s too cold.  The night begins.
The forest enfolds you in its cruel dream.
At the corner of FNAC a crowd simmers
Very dense and very cruel
A huge dog chews the body of a white pigeon.
Further away, in the alley,
An old homeless woman curled up into a ball
Is spat on by kids without speaking a word.
I was alone, rue de Rennes.  Electric signs
Directed me along vaguely erotic paths.
Hi it’s Amandine.
I felt nothing in my prick.

Over the rich girls and the salacious shows.
The managers consume.  It is their only function.

End of the Evening
At the end of the evening, the rise of despair is an inevitable 
phenomenon. There is a kind of timetable of horror. Well, 
I don’t know; I think so.
The expansion of the internal void. That’s what it is. 
A taking-flight of every possible event. As if you were 
suspended in the void, equidistant from every real action, 
by monstrously powerful magnetic forces.
Thus suspended, incapable of any concrete grip on the 
world, the night can seem so long to you. And, indeed, it 
will be.
It will be, however, a protected night; but you will not 
appreciate this protection. You will only appreciate it later, 
once you return to the city, once you return to the day, once 
you return to the world.
Around nine’o’clock, the world will already have attained 
its full level of activity. It will turn smoothly, with a gentle 
whirring. You will have to take part in it, to jump in – a little 
as if one jumped onto the footplate of a shuddering train

Hypermarket – November
Firstly I stumbled into a freezer
I started to cry and I felt a little afraid.
Someone grumbled that I was spoiling the atmosphere;
To retain an air of normality I carried on.
Commuters, drained, with brutal gaze
Walked up and down slowly near the mineral water,
A rumour of the circus and of semi-vice
Mounted from the shelves. My gait was clumsy.
I collapsed at the cheese counter;
There were two old ladies carrying sardines.
The first turned and said to her neighbour:
“It’s really sad, though, a boy of that age.”
And then I saw very broad, circumspect feet;
There was a salesman who took measurements.
Many seemed surprised by my new shoes;
For the last time I was a little on the margins.

I. Being No-One
In his Being No-One,1 Thomas Metzinger sets out a 
radical challenge to any philosophical defence of the status 
of subjective self-consciousness against the incursions of 
reductive neuroscience. Deploying all the resources of a 
nascent science of consciousness, Metzinger proposes at a 
stroke to eliminate selves from the ontological horizon and 
to destroy our most cherished ‘originary’ intuitions about 
‘ourselves’ and our place in the world. Such intuitions

According to Metzinger, organisms are not selves; rather, 
they possess ‘self-models’ which cannot be recognised by 
the system that employs them. All that exist are specific 
information processing systems engaged in self-modelling, 
but whose models cannot be correlated with any ostensibly 
‘real’ items in the world. Metzinger thereby eliminates 
substantive subjectivity in favour not of reduction as such, 
but of tractable explanation. Rather than reducing the 
self, he uses the scientific resources at his command to 
produce a functional model of what ‘selves’ must be: ‘The 
phenomenal self is not a thing, but a process – and the 
subjective experience of being someone emerges if a conscious 
information processing system operates under a transparent 
self-model.’5
Expanding upon Wilfred Sellar’s attack on the ‘Myth of 
the Given’ – ‘the idea that some of our beliefs or claims have 
a privileged epistemic status because the facts that make 
them true are “given” to us by experience’6 – Metzinger 
claims that our folk-philosophical intuitions are a direct 
result of the bounds of our cognition, as expressed in the 
limitations of our phenomenal state-space. He illustrates 
this with a naturalist substantiation of Plato’s allegory of 
the cave, predicated on the argument that ‘our phenomenal 
model of reality is an internal model of reality that could, 
at any time, in principle, turn out to be quite far removed 
from a much more high-dimensional physical reality

furnish the precondition for the phenomenological 
description of the world that distinguishes between natural, 
manifest appearances and the supervening artifices of 
theoretical knowledge. By staking out a supposedly ‘unob­
jectifiable’ domain of subjectivity, philosophy has sought 
to maintain its distance from the coruscating potency of 
neuroscience. Husserl’s so-called ‘principle of all principles’ 
provides perhaps the most radical expression of this kind 
of philosophical presupposition:1‘that every originary, 
presentive intuition is a legitimising source of cognition, 
that everything originarily offered to us in “intuition” is 
to be accepted simply as what it is presented as being, but 
also only within the limits in which it is presented’.2 But it 
is precisely the legitimacy of such ‘pre-theoretical’ intuitions 
that Metzinger problematises, on the grounds that even 
appearances themselves are never immediately ‘manifest’ 
to the conscious subject who experiences them. Working 
across several levels of explanation, Metzinger is not only 
able to draw out a tractable science of consciousness, but to 
expose consciousness’ ‘naive realism’ about its own states. 
Despite formidable technical complexity, the upshot 
of Metzinger’s analyses could not be more clear: ‘no such 
things as selves exist in the world: Nobody ever was or had 
a self’.3 Consequently, ‘consciousness is only appearance’.4

draw out some of the ramifications of Metzinger’s theses. 
Our fundamental contention is that, just as the expropriation 
of subjectivity which is the fundamental theme of Ligotti’s 
fiction finds an unexpected realist basis in Metzinger’s phil­
osophical naturalism, so, conversely, Ligotti’s own meta­
physical ‘irrealism’ affords resources through which the 
‘unimaginable’ consequences of Metzinger’s naturalistic 
‘nemocentrism’ can be brought into speculative focus.13 
II. Phenomenology and the Fiction of Experience
Metzinger argues that neuroscience circumvents the 
supposedly irreducible ambit of self-consciousness and 
dissolves self-intimacy through the objectivation of the 
mechanisms of subjectivity. It is the non-intuitability of 
these mechanisms themselves that gives rise to qualitative 
experience – an experience which is thus constituted by its 
very inability to access the impersonal mechanisms which 
make the phenomenal simulation of self possible. This 
phenomenal simulation is transparent to experience: ‘we do 
and autonomous. Hence, Ligotti inverts the very possibility of redemption: The 
close-ness of world is disclosed in grotesque fabulation to be utterly autonomous in 
exactly the same moment as it is revealed that the mind is equally autonomous from 
the normative phenomenal experience of man. See, for example, T. Ligotti, Crampton 
(Poplar Bluff, MO: Mythos Books, 2002); T. Ligotti, ‘I Have a Special Plan For This 
World’ in Teatro Grotesco (London: Random House, 2008); T. Ligotti, ‘Mad Night of 
Atonement’ in Noctuary (New York: Carroll and Graf, 1994); T. Ligotti, ‘The Tsalal’ 
in Noctuary (New York: Carroll and Graf, 1994); and T. Ligotti, ‘The Sect of the Idiot’ 
in Songs of a Dead Dreamer (London: Robinson Publishing, 1989).
13. ‘A nemocentric reality model is one that satisfies a sufficiently rich set of 
constraints for conscious experience [...] while at the same time not exemplifying 
phenomenal selfhood. It may be functionally egocentric, but it is phenomenologically 
selfless. It would, while still being a functionally centred representational structure, 
not be accompanied by the phenomenal experience of being someone.’ (Metzinger, 
Being No One, 336). Nemocentricism, for Metzinger, is a phenomenologically 
unimaginable possibility; however, it is a possibility that is perfectly conceivable and 
neurobiologically possible (see Metzinger, Being No One, op.cit.).
than we have ever thought of’.7 The ‘cave’ is the physical 
organism; the shadows, a ‘low-dimensional projection of a 
higher dimensional object’; the fire is neural dynamics, i.e. 
the ‘self-regulating flow of neural information processing’; 
the wall is the space of phenomenology, though the wall and 
fire are not separate entities. In sum, ‘[t]he cave in which we 
live our conscious life is formed by our global, phenomenal 
model of reality.’8 In line with some of the bolder suggestions 
proposed by contemporary physicists,9 then, Metzinger’s 
analogy proposes that phenomenological perception may 
well be imprisoned within a virtual model, in which an 
experienced object is merely a  ‘low-dimensional shadow of 
the actual physical object in your hands, a dancing shadow 
in your central nervous system’.10 The crucial and far-
reaching difference from Plato’s cave, however, is that this 
illusion is, quite literally, no-one’s illusion: ‘there is no-one 
in the cave [...] The cave shadow is there. The cave itself is 
empty.’11

cosmology which, from the third person perspective, is 
understood to be a representational and functional property 
which can be analysed in its entirety on this basis.19 ‘Selves’ 
in the full-blooded ontological sense, then, fall victim to 
Ockham’s razor:
Under a general principle of ontological parsimony, it is not 
necessary (or rational) to assume the existence of selves, 
because as theoretical entities they fulfil no indispensable 
explanatory function [...] All that can be explained by the 
phenomenological notion of a ‘self’ can also be explained using 
the representationalist notion of a transparent self-model.20
 Even the most elementary components of phenome­
nality are unavailable to the self. For example, Metzinger 
argues that, in order to draw logical concepts from 
phenomenal content, and therefore to have epistemic and 
justified belief with regard to simple forms of phenomenal 
content, transtemporal identity criteria would have to be 
assumed, drawn directly from material identity criteria.21 
In that case, the abstraction of logic or ontology from 
experience would necessitate the indubitability of the self-
manifestation of appearances: ‘letting apparition show 
itself in its appearance according to its appearance’.22 Thus, 
phenomenological appearance is rooted in an originary 
field of self-identity which, removing the imposition of

not experience phenomenal states as phenomenal states 
[…] [we] look through them’.14 Metzinger regularly alludes 
to fully immersive virtual reality to illustrate his thesis: 
‘We do not experience our conscious field as a cyberspace 
generated by our brain, but simply as reality itself, with 
which we are in contact in a natural and unproblematic 
way.’15 Folk psychology’s agenda is driven by a first person 
logic, occupying a perspectival and geometric structure that 
is temporally and spatially individuated.16 This first-person 
perspective, however, is simply the phenomenal self-model, 
which Metzinger considers amenable to a neurobiological 
description, most likely involving parallel distributed 
processing (pdp), and a functional description: ‘the 
phenomenal self-model is a plastic, multimodal structure’.17 
First-person phenomenal experience is thus formulated 
as an empirical ideality, an empty fiction that is plastic, 
and therefore highly dependent upon the idiosyncrasies 
of the species. Effectively, the first-person perspective is 
a generation of worldhood, ‘a phenomenal cosmology’.18

experience encapsulate the intuition of phenomenal

16. Folk psychology attributes a unique and direct causal link from a selection 
process for volition as the cause of behaviour. Metzinger takes this causal link to be 
untenable, so that; ‘it is not only that folk psychology is false - it is the content of the 
conscious self-model that attributes a causal relation between two events represented 
within it’ (Metzinger, Being No One, 360). Folk psychology is therefore both false and 
hallucinatory from a scientific, third person account.

the specific reality of both the manifest and non-manifest 
elements of phenomenal consciousness. 
III. Transparency: A special form of darkness
The phenomenal self comes about through a ‘special 
form of epistemic darkness’ – essentially, the inability of 
the subject to represent the conditions of its own intuitions. 
Folk psychology posits that the world is given immediately 
to subjective consciousness; it assumes that the experience 
of phenomenal content is transparent to the self. Metzinger 
argues, on the contrary, that immediacy is an illusory 
experience of the ‘outside’ world: 
From an epistemological perspective, we see that our 
phenomenal states at no point in time establish a direct 
and immediate contact with the world for us […] However, 
on the level of phenomenal representation […] this fact is 
systematically suppressed.25 
In a direct inversion of the traditional notion of the trans­
parency of inner sense, Metzinger argues that transparency, 
as an essential characteristic of phenomenal experience, 
illuminates the phenomenological fallacy of pure experience 
and the ‘subjective impression of immediacy’. Naive realism 
is not, therefore, a philosophical theory as such; it is the 
global character of intuition, once the latter is understood 
in terms of phenomenal content locally supervening on 
neurobiological properties. Opacity, as opposed to transpar­
ency, occurs when appearances are cognised as appearances. 
Hence, our primitive pre-reflective feeling of conscious 
selfhood is never truthful, in that it does not correspond 
to any single entity inside or outside of the self-representing 
25.������������
 Metzinger, Being No-One, 59.
the conceptual a priori, claims to return ‘things’ to lived 
experience, and to the fleshly actuality of consciousness. 
According to Metzinger, we only assume the reliability of 
this primitive self-identity on the assumption that ‘in our 
subjective experience of sensory sameness we carry out a 
phenomenal representation of this transtemporal identity 
on the object level in an automatic manner, which already 
carries its epistemic justification in itself.’ – and ‘[i]t is 
precisely this background assumption which is false’.23 The 
transtemporal criteria necessary for the subjective individu­
ation and consequent logical identity are simply unavailable 
to subjective introspection, so that phenomenal concepts are 
a priori incapable of being introspectively formed. Phenom­
enological primitives, supposedly straightforwardly given 
to the conscious subject, are incapable of providing even 
the most basic conceptual traction on the data of conscious­
ness. Hence, as Metzinger argues: 
The phenomenological approach in philosophy of mind, at 
least with regard to those simple forms of phenomenal content, 
is due to failure; a descriptive psychology cannot come into 
existence with regard to almost all of the most simple forms of 
phenomenal content […] The neural and functional correlates 
of the corresponding phenomenal states can, in principle, 
provide us with transtemporal identity criteria as well as 
with those logical identity criteria for which we have been 
looking. Neurophenomenology is possible; phenomenology is 
impossible.24 
Only through the objective scientific circumvention of 
self-conscious experience is it possible to gain traction on

However, as Metzinger is unwilling to split vehicle from 
content – which he believes would reify abstract content 
– transparency is further complexified by the assumption 
that there is a processual and physically realised embodied 
content.30 Metzinger therefore effectively lays waste to func­
tionalism’s attempt to abstract the cognitive from actual 
physiological processes, an attempt which arguably already 
concedes the irreducible status of human sapience vis-à-vis 
its empirical substrate. 
This, of course, is a characteristically modern philosoph­
ical distinction – the same one that allows Kant to maintain 
the autonomy of the transcendental subject from any 
empirical intervention or knowledge whatsoever. Through 
the Critique of Pure Reason’s so-called ‘paradox of inner sense’, 
Kant is able to maintain the transcendental status of the 
‘I think’ without lapsing into pure idealism, which would 
necessarily conflate inner sense with consciousness.31 
Inner and outer sense are given in empirical perception as 
an intuitive whole, which is ultimately determined by the 
understanding through the transcendental synthesis of pure 
apperception.32 Therefore, the intuitive unity of subjective 
consciousness remains distinct from the transcendental 
Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences 2 (2003), 353–93.
30. Hence, phenomenal transparency is distinguished from a Cartesian epistemic 
transparency; ‘The Cartesian claim about the epistemic transparency of self-
consciousness can itself not be epistemically justified.’ (Metzinger, Being No-One, 167), 
though it is phenomenologically adequate (see Metzinger, Being No-One, 340).
31. This is key to Kant’s critique of idealism and of the Cartesian subject; that they 
conflate inner sense with the conscious self. 
32. Kant argues that: ‘What determines inner sense is the understanding and its 
originary power of combining the manifold of intuition, that is, of bringing it under 
an apperception.’ I. Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans. Meiklejohn, ed. V. Politis 
(London: Everyman, 1993), 111 (B153).
system.26 The culmination of this inversion of the concept 
of transparency is indicated by the fact that transparency 
is a form of darkness: ‘With regard to the phenomenology 
of visual experience transparency means that we are not 
able to see something, because it is transparent. We don’t 
see the window but only the bird flying by. Phenomenal 
transparency in general, however, means that something 
particular is not accessible to subjective experience, namely, 
the representational character of the contents of conscious 
experience.’27 The immediately given contents of the 
Phenomenal Self-Model (psm) correspond neither to the 
sub-personal mechanisms underlying those contents, nor to 
any kind of external reality; the entire life-world is illusory, 
an ‘online hallucination’.28 Metzinger calls this feature of the 
self-model theory (smt) ‘autoepistemic closure’ – that is, the 
closure and boundedness of processing in regard to internal 
dynamics. Autoepistemic closure allows for the availability 
of phenomenal content but not of the vehicle of content.29 
26. See ibid., 565.
27.� Ibid., 169. Metzinger elucidates this point: ‘We do not have the feeling of living in 
a three-dimensional film or in an inner representational space: in standard situations 
our conscious life always takes place in the world. We do not experience our conscious 
field as a cyberspace generated by our brain, but simply as reality itself, with which 
we are in contact in a natural and unproblematic way. In standard situations the 
contents of pure experience are subjectively given in a direct and seemingly 
immediate manner. It is precisely in this sense that we can say: they are infinitely 
close to us.’ (Metzinger, ‘The Problem of Consciousness’ , 11-2).
28. See Metzinger, Being No-One, 51. As Metzinger puts it: ‘The instruments of 
representation themselves cannot be represented as such anymore, and hence the 
experiencing system, by necessity, is entangled in a naive realism.’ (Ibid., 169).
29. The dualism of vehicle and content is not available for Metzinger; they cannot 
be understood as two distinct entities (see Metzinger, Being No-One, 166). More 
specifically then, transparency results from the: ‘attentional unavailability of 
earlier processing stages in the brain for introspection. Transparency results from a 
structural / architectonic property of the neural information-processing going on in 
our brains’ (T. Metzinger, ‘Phenomenal Transparency and Cognitive Self-Reference’,

plastic structure which can be neurobiologically described 
as a complex neural activation pattern. But furthermore, 
‘[o]n a more abstract level the same pattern of physiolog­
ical activity can also be described as a complex functional 
state’.34 Since appearances are not discursively structured 
for Metzinger, he eradicates the autonomy of nomological 
consistency by rooting the manifestation of appearances in 
physical structures that are in no way dependent upon ideal 
(transcendental) laws. 
Metzinger thus inverts Kantian ‘opacity’, arguing that it 
is not the transcendental opacity of the self that is primary, 
but the transparency of the self-model, which, through its 
objectivation, can become opaque, allowing for the cognising 
of appearances as appearances. It is our functional design 
that forces us into a naive realism, so that the explanation 
for semantic transparency is given by an evolutionary, 
rather than a transcendental, account: ‘for biological 
systems like ourselves – who always had to minimise the 
computational load [...] naive realism was a functionally 
adequate “background assumption” to achieve reproduc­
tive success [...] [there was] no evolutionary pressure on our 
representational architecture to overcome the naive realism 
inherent in semantic transparency’.35

Such a binding of properties is, for instance, necessary in enabling us to see objects 
as objects’ (Metzinger, ‘Faster than Thought: Holism, Homogeneity and Temporal 
Coding’, in Conscious Experience, ed. T. Metzinger (Thorverton, UK: Imprint Academic, 
1995), 435.

unity of apperception, the ‘I think’, that unifies the manifold 
of presentations into an object of experience. 
Metzinger concurs with Kant on the futile nature of 
rational psychology, and similarly on his transcendental 
(rather than ontological) distinction between phenomenal 
content and reality. However, this transcendental opacity, 
for Kant, lies in the fact that there can be no transparent 
knowledge of the self – concomitant with which is the 
dissolution of the substantive self through the positing of a 
formal a priori ground of subjectivity. Hence, whilst Kant’s 
concept of ‘transcendental illusion’ certainly corresponds 
with what Metzinger terms ‘phenomenological illusion’ 
– that is, the drawing of epistemic conclusions from 
phenomenal experience -- ultimately, Kant’s positing of a 
noumenal subjectivity commits the same fallacy that he had 
sworn to abjure. For, if Metzinger is correct, then the psm 
undermines any attempt to transcendentalise subjectivity 
or consciousness, and the putatively noumenal substratum 
of inner sense can be cashed out in its entirety from within 
the ambit of scientific objectivity. Kant presupposed the 
unification of sense to be given through the unity of apper­
ception that acts as the transcendental guarantor for the 
nomological consistency of appearances, and thus specifies 
ideal laws of appearance that have subsequently been shown 
to be rooted in empirical intuition. Metzinger disavows the 
role of syntactical invariance through his insistence on 
the sub-symbolic and immanent objectivity of the non-
manifest element of consciousness.33 The self-model is a 
33. As Metzinger explicates: ‘the presence and striking holism of phenomenal reality 
[…] would no longer have to be explained in accordance with classical philosophical 
models from above (e.g. by a transcendental subject), if we had a good bottom-up 
alternative […] called “feature binding” in the terminology of brain research: The 
fusion of different properties perceived by the system into a holistic internal structure.

things themselves’, succeeds only in transcendentalising 
folk psychology. In the wake of Metzinger, consciousness 
must be conceived of as produced by immanent objective 
mechanisms, which are themselves sub-symbolic, non-
linguistic, and unconscious, so that ‘pure self-reflection’ is 
exposed as caught within the obscurantism of an empirico-
transcendental circularity. 
Metzinger argues that where philosophy has long 
grappled with reason and representation, it is only now 
that representation has ‘through its semantic coupling with 
the concept of information, been transposed to the domain 
of mathematical precision and subsequently achieved 
empirical anchorage’.37 Thus, ‘[c]onceptual progress by 
a combination of philosophy and empirical research 
programs is possible; conceptual progress by introspec­
tion alone is impossible in principle’.38 Metzinger’s work 
constantly forces philosophy to take account of objective 
intelligence; the sub-personal production of phenomenality 
as a naturalised Kantianism. The objective structure of 
knowledge is invested with empirical contingency, as one 
among many objective procedures; man as a mass of info-
theoretic computation packed densely through sedimented 
layers of transcendental deception. 
V. Nemocentrism 
Perhaps one of the most intriguing undercurrents of 
Metzinger’s book, albeit one that he does not expand upon, 
is the implicit suggestion that the interests of thought can 
be unbound from lived experience, and in many cases even 
37. Metzinger, Being No One, 19.
38.� Ibid., 83.
IV. The Immanent Objectivation of Consciousness
Kant safeguards the autonomy of philosophy via 
recourse to a notion of an a priori transcendental subjec­
tivity which would circumscribe possible experience, 
rendering empirical science inherently incapable of investi­
gating the objectivity of the object and the formal conditions 
of empirical actuality. And, whether overtly or not, much 
‘continental philosophy’ remains wedded to the presuppo­
sition that science is supervenient on a set of concepts that 
are ideally embedded in the subject. This disjunction of 
the empirical sciences and philosophy arguably attains its 
most extreme formulation in Husserl’s conception of pure 
phenomenology as a transcendental-eidetic science whose 
bracketing of the world ensures that the natural sciences 
are confined to res extensa, thereby preserving an immanent 
plane of pure experience governed by an irreducible tran­
scendental consciousness: ‘the existence of Nature cannot 
be the condition for the existence of consciousness, since 
Nature itself turns out to be a correlate of consciousness: 
Nature is only as being constituted in regular concatenations 
of consciousness’.36 However, according to Metzinger, it is 
the very domain of pre-theoretical access which, despite all 
claims to the contrary, is ultimately tethered to the myopia 
of contingently – evolutionarily – circumscribed conditions 
of intuition. Phenomenology, rather than reaching into ‘the 
36. E. Husserl, Ideas, Book 1, 116. See also Husserl’s account of phenomenology 
as an eidetic science: ‘phenomenological or pure psychology as an intrinsically 
primary and completely self-contained psychological discipline, which is also sharply 
separated from natural science, is, for very fundamental reasons, not to be established 
as an empirical science but rather as a purely rational (“apriori,” “eidetic”) science. As 
such it is the necessary foundation for any rigorous empirical science dealing with 
the laws of the psychic, quite the same way that the purely rational disciplines of 
nature pure geometry, kinematics, chronology, mechanics are the foundation for every 
possible “exact” empirical science of nature’ (Husserl, ‘Phenomenology: Entry for the 
Encyclopedia Britannica’, Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology 2, 1971: 77-90.

a mere semblance – and not a semblance of a supra-terres­
trial realm, or an alien ‘Other’, but a semblance of the real 
world, which is utterly indifferent to the interests of organic 
life and thought. Ligotti thus unfolds some of the existential 
and phenomenological implications of Metzinger’s concep­
tualisation of the relative autonomy of appearances: His 
characters experience reality in a way that is utterly incom­
mensurate with the phenomenological register of human 
perception.
Ligotti’s work is characterised by two movements which 
he refuses to separate: the subject’s passive dispossession 
of self-consciousness, and the ‘enlightenment of inanity’. 
This double movement unmasks the reality within which 
the characters have always been. The suffocating effect 
Ligotti achieves through this process is intensified by his 
staunch repudiation of any recourse to the supernatural; 
there is no possibility of escape. Hence, the ascecis of the 
personal takes place within a positively insignificant reality, 
a realisation which dissolves both the intimacy of subjective 
experience, and the impersonal distance of the mechanics 
of that experience. 
Ligotti’s phenomenological nemocentrism draws out 
this collapse of any securely demarcated ontological and 
epistemological foundations in a weird-fictional landscape 
filled with the ruins and ghosts of puppets. Throughout 
Ligotti’s work, the puppet figures as the insensate and 
sub-personal reality hidden beneath the ‘mindless mirrors’ 
of our naive reality. Puppets function as ‘conduits to the 
unreal’,43 through whose agency hallucinatory phenom­
enality bleeds into a simultaneous concretisation of the

opposed to the interests of life.39 For example, in a general 
discussion of scientific realism, Metzinger writes that 
‘there are aspects of the scientific world-view which may 
be damaging to our mental well-being’.40 The object ‘man’ 
consists of tightly packed layers of simulation, for which 
naive realism becomes a necessary prophylactic in order to 
ward off the terror concomitant with the destruction of our 
intuitions regarding ourselves and our status in the world: 
‘conscious subjectivity is the case in which a single organism 
has learned to enslave itself’.41 It is at this point that Thomas 
Ligotti’s work can illuminate Metzinger’s thesis, offering 
a phenomenological purchase upon that which Metzinger 
has claimed to be impossible for the imagination – method­
ological nemocentrism. 
Ligotti 
invokes 
the 
expropriation 
of 
subjective 
experience thus: ‘There are no people, nothing at all like 
that, the human phenomenon is but the sum of densely 
coiled layers of illusion, each of which winds itself upon 
the supreme insanity that there are persons of any kind.’42 
Ligotti couples this supreme insanity with a metaphysical 
irrealism regarding the substantive nature of the world. The 
supposedly foundational order of the phenomenal world is 
39. This is consistent with our general critique of phenomenology, following 
Derrida’s characterisation of Husserl’s work as ‘a philosophy of life […] because 
the source of sense in general is always determined as an act of living, as an act of 
a living being, as Lebendigkeit’ (J. Derrida, Speech and Phenomena and Other Essays on 
Husserl’s Theory of Signs (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1973) 10). On 
this divorce between the interests of thought and those of life, see Ray Brassier’s Nihil 
Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2006).

concomitant with the increasing passivity of the narrator 
engenders an affect of universal claustrophobia through the 
implosion of the personal – which was, of course, never 
personal to begin with.  
It is resolutely not the case, however, that the puppet-
world is ‘willed’ into existence by an ‘Other’; there is no 
puppet master pulling the strings.48 Ligotti’s systematic 
assault on empirical realism is not a result of the reinvigora­
tion of the world with a Heraclitean flux, a pure produc­
tivity, or a contingent excess of materiality. Ligotti’s real 
is ‘positively’ senseless, rigorously disabling any attempt 
to provide reality with substantive or ideal foundations by 
irreversibly severing its reciprocity with the pretensions 
of subjective thought. Ligotti can no more assume the 
existence of an extant and hypostatised nature than he can 
assume the necessary constancy of presence. The transcen­
dental illusion exposed by Metzinger is expanded into a 
total disparity between the interests of life and the reality 
that life finds itself within. The secure foundations of the 
phenomenal and the real dissolve, not into a universal 
solipsism, but into a rigorous realism; ‘it is not, in the end, 
a replacement of the real world by the unreal, but a sort of 
turning the real world inside out to show that it was unreal 
all along’.49     
48. As Ligotti consistently maintains, the dissolution of the self cannot give way to a 
Schopenhaurian Will, as this reinstates some form of ‘first philosophy’ in the form of 
an underlying essence. See Ligotti, ‘Tsalal’; ‘You wrote that there is not true growth 
or evolution in the life of this world but only transformations of appearance, an 
incessant melting and molding of surfaces without underlying essence. Above all you 
pronounced that there is no salvation of any being because no beings exist as such, 
nothing exists to be saved – everything, everyone exists only to be drawn into the 
slow and endless swirling of mutations that we may see every second of our lives’.
49. Joshi, ‘Thomas Ligotti’, 139. Hence the statement; ‘Nothing is real’ (Ligotti, 
Crampton, 83), is not assumable under the idealising consequences of phenomenal 
immediacy. 
oneiric. Life is played out as an inescapable puppet show, an 
endless dream in which the puppets are generally unaware 
that they are trapped within a mesmeric dance of whose 
mechanisms they know nothing, and over which they have 
no control. As Dziemianowicz notes in relation to Ligotti’s 
‘Dreams of a Mannikin’, the puppet’s overriding affect is a 
suspicion that ‘he and his entire world are merely a fictional 
diversion’.44 The puppet is not merely an mocking parody 
of man, it is the unmasking of the animate face of insensate 
reality, the unveiling of the inexorable mechanics of the 
personal; ‘There are no means for escaping this world. It 
penetrates even into your sleep and is its substance. You 
are caught in your own dreaming where there is no space. 
And are held forever where there is no time. You can 
do nothing you are not told to do. There is no hope for 
escape from this dream that was never yours. The very 
words you speak are only its very words.’45 ��������������
The irrepress­
ible horror concomitant with Ligotti’s concretisation of 
the oneiric stems from the experience of living in a ‘three-
dimensional film’, a ‘tunnel through an inconceivably 
high-dimensional reality’.46 This phenomenal experience of 
nemocentrism ultimately dissolves both the intimacy of the 
personal and the distance of the impersonal; ‘nothing’s too 
small, nothing’s too big. You lose your car keys, your wife 
gets run over by a semi, some nut blows up the capital of 
Pakistan’.47 For this reason, the concretisation of the puppet

Ligotti’s horror, then, can be understood in terms of 
Metzinger’s theory, in such a way as to grasp Ligotti’s 
work as a fictional realisation of Metzinger’s nemocen­
trism. Ligotti’s horror is removed from the realm of the 
fantastic and given naturalistic traction through Metzinger’s 
definition of man as the ‘puppet shadow [that] dances on the 
wall of the neurophenomenological caveman’s phenomenal 
state space’.52 Equally, reading Metzinger alongside Ligotti, 
or as Ligottian theory-horror, accentuates the anomic 
terror of the arrogation of the self, as the folk psycholog­
ical ascription of agency that is preserved in the artifice 
of natural language is extricated from the transcendental 
pretensions that phenomenology underwrites. 
Finally, Ligotti enables us to recognise that the theoretic-
practical resolve of Metzinger’s theory is to be found not 
in the reduction of folk psychology, but in a kind of neuro­
technology. Phenomenality and knowledge-weighting 
are malleable: ‘the phenomenal self-model is a plastic, 
multimodal structure’53 whose ‘insertion and integration 
into other domains of information architecture amplify 
the potential for cognitive pliability’.54 What is this but the 
naturalisation of the final outcome of Ligotti’s fantastical 
puppet-dance: the realisation that underlying our parochial 
self-conceit is the impersonal reality of the meat-puppet?55 
52. Metzinger, Being No One, 558.

54. See Metzinger; ‘change the representational content of the conscious self-model 
[…] get some unconscious microfunctional output’ (Metzinger, ‘Response to “A Self 
Worth Having”’). 
55. The conjunction of Ligotti and Metzinger induces the definition of man 
as the shadow of a ‘meat-puppet’. For a reading of man as a meat-puppet within 
contemporary science, see R. Doyle, On Beyond Living: Rhetorical Transformations of 
the Life Science (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997), 36; see also its fictional 
realisation in the character of Molly in W. Gibson, Neuromancer (London: Voyager, 
1984).
Where Metzinger definitively resolves to destroy 
the possibility of the synthesis of man and nature, it is 
through Ligotti’s phenomenological fictionalisation that 
the affective ramifications of this move are elucidated. 
Ligotti has developed a method of realising the absolute 
indifference of the real to the human and the personal 
through a metaphysical irrealism in which he disentangles 
appearances from both sufficient reason and originary 
manifestation by severing the nomological isomorphism of 
appearances and their substrate; in the end, subjectivity is 
simply a specific exacerbation of objectivity.50 Accordingly, 
an unforeseen consequence of Ligotti’s inhabitation of 
Metzinger’s epistemic nemocentricism is that Metzinger’s 
naturalistic realism ends up providing traction on Ligotti’s 
metaphysical irrealism: ‘The horror and nothingness of 
human existence – the cosy facade behind which was only a 
spinning abyss.’51 Phenomenal cosmology is not given by a 
structural syntax, but is simply an exacerbation of objective 
processes unconstrained by any form of ideality.
50. The dissolution of apodictic realism is continuous with the dissolution of apodictic 
thought; ‘the integrity of material forms is only a prejudice, at most a point of view 
[...] things are not bolted down, so to speak. And no more is that thing which we call 
the mind’ (T. Ligotti, ‘The Cocoons’ in The Shadow at the Bottom of the World  [NY: 
Cold Spring Press, 2005], 164). 
51. T. Ligotti, Conspiracy Against the Human Race (Forthcoming – see extract in 
present volume). This would entail the extraction of metaphysical naturalism from 
naturalistic realism, which is methodological rather than ontological. Accordingly, 
it is possible that naturalism may not be the most promising explanatory ground 
for Metzinger’s self-model theory, as evolutionary ethology can be shown to 
ground a representational efficacy, but in order to extrapolate scientific realism on 
this basis, Metzinger would have to argue that nature is inherently functional, and 
therefore promoting a functional univocity. In this case, Metzinger would succumb 
to the charges that Stephen J. Gould poses to Daniel Dennett: making ‘thinly veiled 
attempts to smuggle purpose back into biology’ (S. J. Gould, The Richness of Life: A 
Stephen Jay Gould Reader [London: Vintage, 2007], 442). See D. Dennett, Darwin’s 
Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (London: Penguin, 1996).

Here the objectivation of the world indicates its real condition, 
unveiling the inexorable mechanics of appearances as a 
prospect of hideous insanity – a hall of mindless mirrors 
unbound from the densely coiled layers of illusion that 
characterise the interests of life and the physiology of 
thought. Meanwhile, cognitive protectionism and organic 
enslavement ensure the oneiric aphasia of the shadow of 
the puppet dance:
To know, to understand in the fullest sense, is to plunge into 
an enlightenment of inanity, a wintry landscape of memory 
whose substance is all shadows and a profound awareness 
of the infinite spaces surrounding us on all sides. Within this 
space we remain suspended only with the aid of strings that 
quiver with our hopes and our horrors, and which keep us 
dangling over the gray void. How is it that we can defend such 
puppetry, condemning any efforts to strip us of these strings? 
The reason, one must suppose, is that nothing is more enticing, 
nothing more vitally idiotic, than our desire to have a name 
– even if it is the name of a stupid little puppet – and to hold 
on to this name throughout the long ordeal of our lives, as if 
we could hold on to it forever. If only we could keep those 
precious strings from growing frayed and tangled, if only we 
could keep from falling into an empty sky, we might continue 
to pass ourselves off under our assumed names and perpetuate 
our puppet’s dance throughout all eternity.56

Beginnings1
For ages they had been without heads. Headless they 
lived, and headless they died. How long they had thus 
flourished none of them knew. Then something began to 
change. It happened over unremembered generations. The 
signs of a transfiguring were being writ ever more deeply into 
them. As their breed moved forward, they began crossing 
boundaries whose very existence they never suspected ... 
and they trembled. Some of them eyed their surroundings 
as they would a strange land into which they had wandered, 
even though their kind had trodden the same earth for 
countless seasons. And after nightfall, they looked up at 
a sky filled with stars and felt themselves small and fragile 
in the vastness. More and more, they came to know a new

way of being. It was as if the objects around them were 
one thing and they were another. The world was moving 
farther and farther away, and they were at the center of this 
movement. Another world was forming inside the heads 
they now had. Each of them, in time, became frightened 
in a way they had never known. In former days, they were 
frightened only by sights and sounds in the moments they 
saw or heard them. Now they were frightened by things 
that were not present to their senses. They were also 
frightened by visions that came not from outside them but 
from within them. Everything had changed for their kind, 
and they could never return to what they once had been. 
The epoch had passed when they and the rest of creation 
were one and the same. They were beginning to know a 
world that did not know them. This is what they thought, 
and they thought it was not right. Something which should 
not be ... had become. And something had to be done if 
they were to flourish as they had before, if the very ground 
beneath their feet were not to fall out from under them. 
They could do nothing about the world which was moving 
farther and farther away and which knew them not. So 
something would have to be done about their heads.
Differences
For centuries a debate has been going on among us, 
a shadowy polemic that periodically attracts public notice. 
The issue: what do people think about being alive? 
Overwhelmingly, those questioned will say, ‘Being alive is 
all right’. More thoughtful respondents will add, ‘Especially 
when you consider the alternative’, betraying a jocularity that 
is as logically puzzling as it is macabre, since the alternative 
is the first among certitudes that make being alive not

all right. These speakers weigh down one side of the survey. 
On the other side is a small sample in disagreement with the 
majority. Their response to the question of what they think 
about being alive will be a negative one. They may even 
fulminate about how objectionable it is to be alive. Now, 
there are really no incisive answers to why people think 
or feel this way or that. But one thing is sure: the people 
in the second group are pessimists. And in the minority 
opinion of pessimists, most of the people in this world have 
to work very hard to keep from thinking there is anything 
objectionable about being alive. 
Lamentably, we cannot choose to think what we 
think or feel what we feel. If we did have this degree of 
mastery over our internal lives, then we would be spared 
an assortment of sufferings. Psychiatrists would be out 
of a job as depressives chose to stop being depressed and 
schizophrenics chose to stop being crazy. Most people, 
especially those who say that being alive is all right, do 
believe they have considerable choice in choosing what 
they think and feel. And psychiatrists, who will never be 
unemployed, seldom dissuade their clients from believing 
they can choose their thoughts and feelings. Nevertheless, 
those who believe they can choose what they think and 
feel are incapable of choosing what they choose to think and 
feel. Should they still believe themselves in control of what 
they choose to choose to think and feel, they still could 
not choose to choose to choose . . . and so on. Were there 
any choice on our part regarding what we think and feel, 
it would not be adventurous to conjecture that we would 
think about pleasant things rather than horrible things and 
choose to feel good rather than bad. Some might even choose 
to think about nothing at all and to live in a permanent 
state of euphoria until they died of natural causes. With 
godlike power over your thoughts and feelings, you could 
do as you choose. And who would choose to think horrible 
thoughts and feel bad feelings about being alive? 
Zapffe
If the most contemplative individuals are sometimes 
dubious about the value of existence, they do not often 
publicize their doubts but align themselves with the man 
in the street, tacitly declaiming, in more erudite terms, 
‘Being alive is all right, etc’. The butcher, the baker, and the 
crushing majority of philosophers all agree on one thing: 
human life is justified, and we should keep our species 
going for as long as we can. To tout the opposing side is 
asking for grief. But some people seem born to bellyache 
that being alive is not all right. Should they vent this 
unpopular view in philosophical or literary works, they 
may do so without apprehension that their efforts will have 
an excess of admirers. Notable among such efforts is ‘The 
Last Messiah’ (1933), an essay written by the Norwegian 
philosopher and man of letters Peter Wessel Zapffe (1899-
1990). In this work, which has been twice translated into 
English,2 Zapffe elucidated what he saw as the tragedy of 
human existence.

(translator Gisle R. Tangenes). Regrettably, Zapffe’s philosophical masterwork, On 
the Tragic (1941), has not appeared in any major language at the time of this writing. 
However, abstracts of its substance, as well as excerpts from this treatise and other 
writings by Zapffe as translated into English by Tangenes, confirm that throughout 
his long life he did not abandon or dilute the pessimistic principles of On the Tragic as 
they appear in miniature in ‘The Last Messiah’.

Before discussing why Zapffe saw human existence as 
a tragedy, it may be useful to consider a few facts whose 
relevance will become manifest down the line. As some 
may know, there exist readers who treasure philosophical 
and literary works of a pessimistic, nihilistic, or defeatist 
nature as indispensable to their existence, hyperbolically 
speaking. Cynical by nature, these persons are well aware 
that nothing indispensable to their existence, hyperbolically 
or literally speaking, must make its way into their lives, as 
if by natural birthright. They do not think that anything 
indispensable to anyone’s existence may be claimed as a 
natural birthright, since the birthrights we commonly 
bandy about are all fictions, something we dreamed up 
after straying from a factual world into one fabricated by 
our heads. For those who have given any thought to this 
matter, the only rights we may exercise are these: to seek 
the survival of our individual bodies, to create more bodies 
like our own, and to perish through a process of corruption 
or mortal trauma. This is presuming that one has been 
brought to term and has survived to a certain age, neither 
being a natural birthright. Stringently considered, our only 
natural birthright is to die. No other rights have been allocated 
to us except, to repeat, as fabrications. The divine right of 
kings may now be acknowledged as a fabrication, a falsified 
permit for prideful dementia and impulsive mayhem. The 
unalienable rights of certain people, however, seemingly 
remain current: whether observed or violated, somehow we 
believe they are not fabrications because an old document 
says they are real. Miserly or munificent as a given right 
may appear, it denotes no more than the right of way 
warranted by a traffic light, which does not mean you have 
the right to drive free of vehicular misadventures. Ask any 
paramedic.

Our want of any natural birthright – except to die, in 
most cases without assistance – is not a matter of tragedy 
but only one of truth. Coming at last to the pith of Zapffe’s 
thought as spelled out in ‘The Last Messiah’, the tragedy 
of human existence had its beginnings when at some stage 
in our evolution we somehow acquired consciousness. 
Zapffe believed consciousness to be a mistake in human 
evolution, an adventitious outgrowth that made of us 
a race of monsters – things that had nothing to do with 
the rest of creation. Because of consciousness, we became 
susceptible to thoughts that were startling and dreadful to 
us. (‘I think, therefore I am and will one day die’, or thus 
might have read René Descartes’ formulation had he gone 
the whole mile with it). Our heads now began dredging 
up horrors, flagrantly joyless possibilities, enough of 
them to make us drop to the ground in paroxysms of self-
soiling consternation should they go untrammeled. This 
potentiality necessitated that certain defense mechanisms be 
put to use to keep us balanced on the knife-edge of vitality 
as a species. While a modicum of consciousness may have 
had survivalist properties during an immemorial chapter of 
our evolution, further escalations of this faculty appeared 
to be maladaptive, turning our awareness into a seditious 
agent working against us. As the Norwegian philosopher 
concluded, along with others before and after him, we must 
hamper our consciousness for all we are worth or it will 
impose upon us a too clear vision of the ‘great matter of 
birth and death’, to borrow a phrase from Zen Buddhism. 
Thus, each of us became a paradox: we could not live with 
ourselves as we were and we could not live otherwise. We 
could only keep the horror in its box. 
 For the rest of the earth’s organisms, existence is 
relatively uncomplicated. Their lives are about three 
things: survival, reproduction, death – and nothing else. 
But we know too much to content ourselves with surviving, 
reproducing, dying – and nothing else. We know we are 
alive and know we will die. We also know we will suffer at 
intervals throughout our lives before suffering – slowly or 
quickly – at the point of death. This is the knowledge we 
‘enjoy’ as the most intelligent organisms to gush from the 
womb of nature. And as such, we feel shortchanged if there 
is nothing more for us than to survive, reproduce, and die. 
We want there to be more to it than that, or to think there 
is. This is the tragedy: consciousness has forced us into 
striving to be something other than what we are – hunks of 
spoiling flesh on hardening bones. For other organisms, life 
is a well-managed ramble toward their demise. But we are 
susceptible to startling and dreadful thoughts, and we need 
some fabulous illusions to take our minds off them. For us, 
then, life is a con game we must run on ourselves, hoping 
we do not catch on to any monkey business that would 
leave us stripped of our defense mechanisms and standing 
bare-assed before the silent, staring void. To end this self-
deception, to free our species from this backbreaking labor 
of lies, we must cease reproducing. Nothing less will do, 
per Zapffe, although in ‘The Last Messiah’ the character 
after whom the essay is named does all the talking about 
human extinction. Elsewhere Zapffe speaks for himself on 
the subject. 
More audacious than it is astonishing, Zapffe’s thought 
has a substructure in existential psychology and sociology 
rather than in metaphysics, analytics, or hard science. It 
is penetrable and ineluctably dismal, resting on taboo

commonplaces and outlawed truisms while eschewing 
the arcane brain-twisters that for thousands of years have 
been philosophy’s stock-in-trade. The World as Will and 
Representation (two volumes, 1819 and 1844) by the German 
philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer is perhaps the most 
handsome metaphysical system ever elaborated, which 
does not mean that the Will-to-live as the causal agent for 
everything that moves is not just an overwrought floorshow 
for brainiacs. But Zapffe’s principles are crystalline and 
therefore could never interest professors or practitioners of 
philosophy, who prefer to circle around grand exhibitions 
of theory wherein harsh realities and reeling senselessness 
are secreted behind elegant explications of what our lives 
are really about. If we must think, it should be done only in 
circles, outside of which lies the unthinkable.   
Masterminding
Zapffe’s two central propositions as adumbrated 
above are as follows. The first is that consciousness has 
overreached the point of being a sufferable property of our 
species, and thus we thwart it in four principal ways.
(1) Isolation. So that we may get on with living 
without going into a free fall of trepidation, we isolate 
the dire facts of being alive. These are stowed away in a 
remote compartment of our minds. They are the family 
freaks in the attic whose existence we deny in a conspiracy 
of silence. 
(2) Anchoring. To stabilize our lives in the 
tempestuous waters of chaos, we conspire to anchor them 
in metaphysical and institutional ‘verities’ – God, Morality, 
Natural Law, Country, Family – that imbue us with a sense 
of being official, authentic, and safe in our beds.
(3) Distraction. To keep our heads unreflective of a 
world of horrors, we distract them with the worst trash or 
the best trash. The most operant and elementary method 
for furthering the conspiracy, distraction is in continuous 
employ and demands only that everyone keep their eyes on 
the ball – or television screen or great book.
(4) Sublimation. That we might annul a paralyzing 
stage fright having to do with the nightmare intervals of 
being alive, we sublimate our fears by making an open 
display of them. In the Zapffian sense, sublimation is the 
rarest technique utilized for conspiring against the human 
race. Putting into play both deviousness and skill, this is 
the process by which thinkers and artistic types recycle the 
most demoralizing and unnerving aspects of life as works 
in which the worst fortunes of humanity are presented in a 
stylized and removed manner as entertainment. In so many 
words, these thinkers and artistic types confect products that 
provide an escape from our suffering by a bogus simulation 
of it – a tragic drama or philosophical woolgathering, for 
instance. Zapffe uses ‘The Last Messiah’ to showcase how 
a literary-philosophical opus cannot perturb its creator or 
anyone else with the severity of true-to-life horrors, but 
only provide a pale representation of these horrors, just as 
a movie whose centerpiece is the romance of two young 
people, one of whom dies of leukemia, cannot rend its 
audience with the throes of the real thing, even if it may 
produce an award-winning tearjerker, as in the case of the 
1971 film adaptation of Erich Segal’s 1970 bestselling novel 
Love Story.
By cleaving to these stratagems, we keep ourselves from 
scrutinizing too closely the smorgasbord of pain and fear 
laid out for us by life.

COLLAPSE IV
220
The second of Zapffe’s two central propositions – that 
our species should refrain from reproducing – brings to 
mind a familiar cast of characters. The Gnostic sect of 
the Cathari in twelfth-century France were so tenacious in 
believing the world to be an evil place engendered by an 
evil deity that its members were offered a dual ultimatum: 
sexual abstinence or sodomy. (A similar sect in Bulgaria, 
the Bogomils, became the etymological origin of the term 
‘buggery’ for their practice of this form of erotic release). 
Around the same period, the Catholic Church mandated 
abstinence for its clerics, a directive that did not halt them 
from betimes giving in to sexual quickening. Most sadly, 
the raison d’être for this doctrine was the attainment of grace 
(and in legend was obligatory for those in search of the 
Holy Grail) rather than an enlightened governance of 
reproductive plugs and bungholes. Lusting to empower 
itself, the Church slacked off from the example of its ascetic 
founder in order to breed a copious body of followers and 
rule as much of the earth as it could.
In another orbit from the theologies of either Gnosticism 
or Catholicism, the nineteenth-century German philosopher 
Philipp Mainländer (pseudonym of Phillip Batz) advocated 
chastity as the surest blueprint for salvation. The target 
point of his redemptive plan was the summoning within 
ourselves of a ‘Will-to-die’. This brainstorm, along with 
others as gripping, was advanced by Mainländer in a 
treatise whose title has been translated as The Philosophy of 
Redemption.3 Unsurprisingly, the work itself has not been

Otto Weininger in his infamous study translated as Sex and 
Character (1903), he had ruminated more about the venereal 
goad rather than against it. Mainländer also made the cardinal 
error of pressing his readers to work for such ends as justice 
and charity for all. An unbridled visionary, although not 
of the inspirational sort that receives a charitable hearing 
from posterity, he shot himself in the foot every chance he 
got before aiming the gun a little higher and ending his 
life. This act was consummated the day of the publication 
of The Philosophy of Redemption. To the end, Mainländer 
avouched his personal sense of well-being and proposed 
universal suicide for a most esoteric reason (see under the 
section ‘Deicide’ below). 
A less composed figure than Mainländer was the Italian 
philosopher Carlo Michelstaedter. In his 1910 doctoral 
dissertation, published in English as Persuasion and Rhetoric4, 
the twenty-three-year-old Michelstaedter critiqued, as later 
would Zapffe, the tactics we use to falsify the realities of 
human existence in exchange for a speciously comforting 
view of our lives. Michelstaedter’s biographers and critics 
have speculated that his despair of any person’s ability to 
break through their web of illusions was the cause of his 
suicide (two bullets from a gun) the day after he finished his 
dissertation. What seems to have finished Michelstaedter 
was a stellar fact of human life that he could not accept: 
no one has control over how they will be in this world, 
a truth that eradicates all hope if how you want to be is 
invulnerably self-possessed (‘persuaded’) and without 
subjection to a life that would fit you within the limits of its 
unrealities (‘rhetoric’, a word oddly used by Michelstaedter).

But individuals are defined by their limitations; without 
them, we fall outside the barrier of identifiable units, 
functionaries in the big show of collective existence. The 
farther you proceed toward a vision of humankind under 
the aspect of eternity, the farther you drift from what makes 
you a person among persons in this world. In the observance 
of Zapffe, an overactive consciousness endangers the 
approving way in which we define ourselves and our lives. 
It does this by threatening our self-limited perception of 
who we are and by blackmailing us with unsavoury facts 
about what it means to know we are alive and will die. A 
person’s demarcations as a being, not how far he trespasses 
those limits, create his identity and preserve his illusion 
of being someone. Transcending all illusions and their 
emergent activities would untether us from ourselves and 
license the freedom to be no one. In that event, we would 
lose our allegiance to our species, stop reproducing, and 
quietly bring about our own end. The lesson: ‘Let us love 
our limitations, for without them nobody would be left to 
be somebody.’
While recognizing the nuisance of conscious existence, 
not all are as unrelenting in their pessimism as Zapffe. In 
his 1913 Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations,5 the Spanish 
writer Miguel de Unamuno speaks of consciousness as 
a disease bred by a conflict between the rational and the 
irrational. The rational is identified with the conclusions 
of consciousness, primarily that we will all die. The 
irrational represents all that is vital in humanity, including 
a universal desire for immortality. The coexistence of the 
rational and the irrational turns the human experience 
into a wrangle of contradictions to which we can submit

225
with a suicidal resignation or obstinately defy as heroes 
of futility. Unamuno’s penchant is for the heroic course, 
with the implied precondition that one has the physical 
and psychological spunk for the fight: ‘I think, therefore 
I know that life is a meaningless bitch and then I will die; 
but I cannot let that keep me from living in defiance of 
what I know, which is what everyone does, pessimist or 
not.’ In line with Unamuno, Joshua Foa Dienstag, author 
of Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit,6 also gives the thumbs-
up to the pessimist-as-hero – one who is aware of the 
dispiriting lowdown on life and yet marches on. Also 
siding with this never-say-die group is William R. Brashear, 
whose The Desolation of Reality7 concludes with a format for 
redemption, however partial and imperfect, by means of 
what he calls ‘tragic humanism’, which recognizes human 
life’s ‘ostensible insignificance, but also the necessity of 
proceeding as if this were not so, and of willfully nourishing 
and sustaining the underlying illusions of value and order’. 
Not exactly pessimists in the tradition of Schopenhauer or 
Zapffe, Unamuno, Dienstag, and Brashear are at least vocal 
about what is at stake for those who know they are alive 
and will die.
 Meaningfulness
Among the unpleasantries of life that lie in wait is the 
abashment some persons suffer because they feel their 
lives are destitute of meaning. The sense that one’s life has 
meaning is sometimes declared to be a necessary condition 
for developing or maintaining a state of good feeling. This 
is horrendous news considering the mind-boggling number

of books and therapies for a market of discontented 
individuals who are short on a sense of meaning, either 
in a limited and localized variant (‘I received an A on my 
calculus exam’) or one that is macrocosmic in scope (‘There 
is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is his prophet’). 
Those who are euphoric, or even moderately content, are 
not parched for meaning. Relatively speaking, feeling good 
is its own justification. As long as such states last, why louse 
up a good thing with self-searching interrogations about 
meaning? But an abnormal degree of elation could also 
be a sign of psychopathology, as it is for individuals who 
have been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Such 
persons should be treated by mental health professionals, 
although psycho-behavioral therapeutics often puts a 
patient in the clutches of mind healers who are modern-
day incarnations of positive-thinking preachers such as 
Norman Vincent Peale. No one ever bought a copy of 
The Power of Positive Thinking8 who was not dissatisfied with 
his or her life. This dissatisfaction is precisely the quality 
that the great pessimists – Buddha, Schopenhauer, Freud 
– saw as definitive of the human packing plant. Millions of 
copies of Peale’s book and its reiterations, including Martin 
Seligman’s Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology 
to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment ,9 have been sold. 
And they were not purchased by readers who were madly 
content with their place on the ladder of subjective well 
being, in the vernacular of ‘positive psychology’. Neither 
have they been documented as hoisting themselves toward 
‘lasting’ fulfillment by reading the books of these gurus of 
happiness.10

While every other creature in the world is insensate to 
meaning, those of us on the high ground of evolution are 
full of this enigmatic hankering, a preoccupation that any 
comprehensive encyclopedia of philosophy treats under 
the heading life, the meaning of. We have a need that is 
not natural, one that can never be satisfied no matter how 
many big lies we swallow. Our unparalleled craving may 
be appeased – like the yen of a dope fiend – but we are 
deceived if we think it is ever gone for good. Years may pass 
during which we are unmolested by life, the meaning of. 
Some days we wake up and just say, ‘It’s good to be alive’. If 
everyone were in such elevated spirits all the time, the topic 
of life, the meaning of would never rise up in our heads or 
our conversations. But this ungrounded jubilation soon runs 
out of steam. Our consciousness, having snoozed awhile in 
the garden of incuriosity, is pricked by some thorn or other, 
perhaps death, the meaning of. Then the hunger returns 
for life, the meaning of, the emptiness must be filled again, 
the pursuit is resumed. And we will keep chasing after the 
impossible until we are no more. This is the tragedy that we 
do our best to cover up in order to brave an existence that 
holds terrors for us at every turn, with little but blind faith 
and habit to keep us on the move. 
Humanness
As heretofore posited, consciousness may have facilitated 
our species’ survival in the hard times of prehistory, but as 
it became evermore acute it evolved the potential to ruin 
everything if not securely muzzled. This is the problem: we

instruct an individual to achieve, see ‘Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon’ by

must either outsmart consciousness or be thrown into its 
vortex of doleful factuality and suffer, as Zapffe dubbed it, 
a ‘dread of being’ – not only of our own being but of being 
itself. On the strength of this premise, Zapffe inferred that 
the sensible thing to do would be to call off all procreative 
activities. Not only would it be the sensible thing to do, 
but it might be the most telling indication, even the only 
indication, of what it means to be human. This could settle 
some old questions. Is the condition of being human what 
we think it is? And what do we think it is to be human? 
Nowhere in philosophy or the arts are there answers on 
which we can all agree. Science has us down as a species of 
organic life. But whatever it means to be human, we can at 
least say that we have consciousness – an attribute that has 
made us the royalty of creation, yet one that we cannot let 
get out of hand if we are to survive. Question: why would 
we want to survive as a species caught in this double bind? 
Answer: because we do not know what it is to be human. 
To repeat what cannot be repeated enough: we can 
tolerate existence only if we believe – in accord with a 
complex of illusions, a legerdemain of deception – that we 
are not what we are: unreality on legs. As creatures with 
consciousness, we must suppress that divulgement lest it 
break us with a sense of being things without significance or 
foundation, anatomies shackled to a landscape of pointless 
horrors. In plain language, we cannot live with ourselves 
except as impostors, paradoxical beings who must lie to 
ourselves about ourselves, as well as about our no-win 
situation in this world. Thus, we are zealots of Zapffe’s 
four consciousness-smothering strategies: isolation (‘Being 
alive is all right’), anchoring (‘One Nation under God with 
Families, Morality, and Natural Laws for all’), distraction 
(‘Better to kill time than kill oneself’), and sublimation 
(‘I am writing a book entitled The Conspiracy Against the 
Human Race’). These practices make us what we are – 
beings with a nimble intellect who can deceive themselves 
‘for their own good’. Isolation, anchoring, distraction, and 
sublimation are the wiles we use to keep our heads from 
dispelling every illusion that keeps us up and running. 
(‘We think, therefore we know we are alive and will one 
day die; so we had better stop thinking, except in circles.’) 
Without this cognitive double-dealing, our world would be 
seen for what it is – something that is not very good to 
see, something that everyone glimpses from time to time 
and then looks away because they do not want to see too 
much of it. Maybe if we could resolutely gaze wide-eyed at 
our lives we would know what it is to be human. But that 
would stop the puppet show that we like to think will run 
forever.
In ‘The Last Messiah’, Zapffe wrote: ‘The whole of 
living that we see before our eyes today is from inmost to 
outmost enmeshed in repressional mechanisms, social and 
individual; they can be traced right into the tritest formulas 
of everyday life.’11 The four formulas that Zapffe picked 
out as individual and social mechanisms of repression 
are probably the most trite he could have chosen, which 
may have been deliberate on his part because they are 
so familiar to us and so visible in human affairs. No one 
hesitates to admit them. Not overweight persons or tobacco 
users, who will promptly admit to playing dumb when 
they are scarfing down a cupcake or smoking a cigarette. 
Not soldiers fighting a war, who will proudly admit they 
are risking their lives and limbs for a good greater than

themselves – their families, their country, their god. Not 
anyone who is going to die soon, who will not voluntarily 
admit to playing the same old games for as long as possible 
rather than be consumed by thoughts of mortality and the 
agony that may precede it. Not artists, who with a shrug 
will admit to keeping their aesthetic distance for fear of 
being hamstrung by the realities they instantiate (musicians 
practice distraction rather than artistic sublimation). Such 
repressional mechanisms have been well analyzed by 
professional thinkers, particularly in relation to the fear of 
death. (For an enumeration of these and other mechanisms 
for grappling with thanatophobia, see Choices for Living: 
Coping with the Fear of Dying12 by Thomas S. Langer). For 
almost all philosophers who write on the subject, death 
is studied in the abstract, while the more messy truths 
attending it are either bracketed or cold-shouldered. Death, 
of course, is only a sub-category of suffering, which, if it is 
even recognized by philosophers, is not something they care 
to brood upon. Suffering cannot be studied in the abstract. 
Philosophically, there is not much that can be done with 
it, and those few who try will be arraigned for talking 
nonsense. Almost all philosophers balk at saying anything 
about suffering, the meaning of. But none of them 
hesitate to admit that they, in league with everyone else, 
employ repressional mechanisms in their lives. And what 
use are repressional mechanisms if not to avoid discussions 
about suffering?

Suffering
In The Open Society and Its Enemies,13 Karl Popper expounded 
a new slant on human suffering. Briefly, he revamped the 
Utilitarianism of the nineteenth-century British philosopher 
John Stuart Mill, who wrote, ‘Actions are right in proportion 
as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend 
to promote the reverse of happiness’. Popper remolded 
this summation of a positive Utilitarianism into a negative 
Utilitarianism whose position he handily stated as follows: 
‘It adds to clarity in the fields of ethics, if we formulate our 
demands negatively, i.e. if we demand the elimination of 
suffering rather than the promotion of happiness.’ Taken 
to its logical and most humanitarian conclusion, Popper’s 
demand can have as its only end the elimination of those 
who now suffer and those who will suffer if they are born. 
What else could the ‘elimination of suffering’ mean if not its 
total abolition, and ours? Naturally, Popper held his horses 
well before suggesting that to eliminate suffering would 
demand that we as a species be eliminated. But he should 
still be applauded for promoting the basics of a school of 
thought that would prefer to eliminate suffering – or at least 
tone it down – than to promote happiness in human life. 
Other philosophies of a similar type as Negative 
Utilitarianism are Abolitionism and Algonomy. The people 
behind these incipient movements are fiery battlers against 
a world that is effectively indifferent to human suffering, 
which they have situated as the only problem with being 
alive. Abolitionism has gone so far as to preach that not 
only should human beings be emancipated from suffering, 
they should also know what it is like to feel unbroken 
bliss throughout their lives and no mental or physical 
13. London: Routledge, 1945.
inconvenience upon their deaths – a Utilitarianism beyond 
positivity or negativity. While no safe and efficient means 
yet exists to reach this peak existence, the parent figure of 
Abolitionism, the British philosopher David Pearce, has 
encyclopedically catalogued the ameliorations for suffering 
that now exist and has brilliantly outlined what steps we 
should presently be taking toward a life of engineered 
happiness. Nevertheless, an Abolitionist life would still not 
be perfect, since painful fatalities caused by accidents and 
natural disasters can never be gotten around. And such a 
life would be as useless as any other. That having been 
said, the existence that Pearce wants for the human race 
would at least not be malignant through and through, since 
it would turn the suffering with which we are drenched into 
a shower of (mostly) pleasurable sensations.
In ‘The Last Messiah’, Zapffe is not sanguine about 
eliminating suffering, nor is he so unworldly as to beseech 
a communal solution for its elimination by snuffing out the 
human race, as did the Cathari and the Bogomils. (He does 
critique the barbarism of social or religious proscriptions 
of suicide, but he is not a standard-bearer for this form 
of personal salvation). Zapffe’s thought is foremost an 
addendum to that of various sects and individuals who 
have found human existence to be so unquestionably awful 
that extinction is preferable to survival. It also has the 
value of advancing a new answer to the old question ‘Why 
should generations unborn be spared entry into the human 
thresher?’ But what might be called ‘Zapffe’s Paradox’, in the 
tradition of possessively named formulations that saturate 
primers of philosophy, is as useless as the propositions 
of any other thinker who is pro-life or anti-life or is only 
juggling concepts to clinch what is reality and can we ever 

Ligotti – Thinking Horror / Kulik – Dead Monkeys
235
get there. Having said as much, we can continue as if it 
had not been said. The value of a philosopher’s thought is 
not in its answers – no philosopher has any that are more 
helpful than saying nothing at all – but in how well they 
speak to the prejudgments of their consumers. Such is the 
importance – and the nullity – of rhetoric. Ask any hard-
line pessimist, but do not expect him to expect you to take 
his words seriously.
The greatest strike against philosophical pessimism is 
that its only theme is human suffering. This is the last item 
on the list of our species’ preoccupations and detracts from 
everything of any importance to us, such as the Good, 
the Beautiful, and tomorrow’s weather. Cures may be 
discovered for certain diseases and sociopolitical barbarities 
may be amended, but these are only stopgaps. Human 
suffering is insoluble as long as human beings exist. The 
one truly effective solution for suffering is that spoken of 
in Zapffe’s ‘Last Messiah’. It may not be a realistic solution 
for a stopgap world, but it is one that would forever put 
an end to suffering, should we ever care to do so. The 
pessimist’s credo, or one of them, is that nonexistence never 
hurt anyone and that conscious existence hurts everyone. 
(Uneasy indeed are the heads that wear the crown of 
creation). Without consciousness we would still know pain; 
suffering, however, would not disturb us.
The twentieth-century Austrian philosopher Ludwig 
Wittgenstein once said or wrote, ‘I don’t know why we 
are here, but I’m pretty sure it is not in order to enjoy 
ourselves’. But Wittgenstein’s uncertain determination 
does not go to the heart of human existence. Hedonism is 
irrelevant as a justification for our lives. No price is too high 
for our creaturely reward of just being here and knowing 

COLLAPSE IV
236
Ligotti – Thinking Horror / Kulik – Dead Monkeys
237
that others will be here after us. This is our ‘pleasure’, and 
no amount of suffering will lead our species to question 
it. While this pleasure began as a relief from the anxieties 
of genealogical slippage, it now stems in the main from 
psychological satisfactions. The modern family unit is an 
indulgence, not a necessity. It is a satisfaction of the ego or 
an appurtenance of one’s public image. Children are not 
economic insurance for their families but consumer goods, 
personal accessories, trinkets or tie-clips. No longer their 
parents’ employees, as in earlier days, they strike out on their 
own and go into business for themselves when sufficient 
capital has been accumulated or may be borrowed – life on 
the installment plan. 
But if the price of suffering has fallen – not that it was 
ever unaffordable – we still must deal with a progressively 
insidious consciousness, that invader of our homes and 
heads. Zapffe’s achievement as a pessimist treads beyond 
plaints of how rich with suffering life can be. We – as 
genetic donors consorting two by two for the protraction of 
our species – have no problem with suffering. The problem 
for us – as billions of lone individuals who mingle but can 
never merge with one another – is the pyrotechnics of 
cogitation we must perform to stave off our consciousness 
of pain, of death, of life as a danse macabre into which we 
are always pulling new partners and lying to them as we lie 
to ourselves.
Our success as a survival-happy species is calculated in 
the number of years we have extended our lives, with the 
reduction of suffering being only incidental to this aim. The 
lifespan of non-domesticated mammals has never changed, 
while ours has grown by leaps and bounds. What a coup 
for us. Unaware of the length of their stay on earth, other 
warm-blooded life forms are sluggards by comparison. 
Without consciousness of death, we would not frantically 
rouse ourselves to lengthen our mortal tenure. And how 
we have cashed in on our efforts: no need to cram our lives 
into three decades now that we can cram them into seven, 
eight, nine, or more. Time will run out for us as it does for 
all creatures, true, but at least we can dream of a day when 
we might choose our own deadline. Then everyone could 
die of the same thing: satiation with a durability that is 
malignantly useless. Without a terminus for the journey 
of our lives, their uselessness would become excruciatingly 
overt. Knowing ourselves to be on a collision course with 
the Black Wall of Death may be a horror, but it is the only 
thing that makes it possible to value that which comes 
before, if we are not too cast down by thoughts of our 
mortality to do so. While this quid pro quo may be a bad 
value, without it there is no value. Only a terminal point, 
only endness, can make the present seem precious, although 
the here-and-now is almost invariably taken for granted so 
that we can squander what little time we have by looking 
cockeyed to the future. It is in the future that we expect to 
inherit a greater value than that which trickles backwards 
into our lives from their certain end. But as everyone knows, 
even though we disregard this knowledge, the future is only 
the present in disguise, and as soon as it arrives we begin 
hunting for another future. Not until the future is behind 
us can there be any peace on this earth or in our heads. If 
only we could end our arduous voyage to a fool’s future, 
Zapffe’s prospectus for our self-extermination would be a 
walk in the park. At all levels, the systems of life – from 
sociopolitical systems to solar systems – are repugnant and 
should be negated as malignantly useless.

‘Worthless’ rather than ‘useless’ is the more familiar 
epithet in this context. The motive for using ‘useless’ in 
place of ‘worthless’ in this histrionically capitalized phrase 
is that ‘worthless’ is tied to the concepts of desirability 
and value, and by their depreciation introduces them into 
the mix. ‘Useless’, on the other hand, is not so inviting of 
these concepts. ‘Worthless’ can serviceably be connected 
to the language of pessimism and does what damage it 
can. But the devil of it is that ‘worthless’ really does not 
go far enough when speaking pessimistically about the 
character of existence. Too many times the question ‘Is 
life worth living?’ has been asked. This usage of ‘worth’ 
excites impressions of a fair lot of experiences that are 
arguably desirable and valuable within limits and that 
follow upon one another in such a way as to suggest that 
life is not worthless overall, or not so worthless that a case 
could not be made for its worth. With ‘useless’, the spirits 
of desirability and value do not as readily rear their heads, 
and existence as dizzying pointlessness state of affairs may 
be more intemperately asserted. Naturally, the uselessness 
of all that is or could be may be repudiated as well or badly 
the worthlessness of all that is or could be. For this reason, 
the adverb ‘malignantly’ has been annexed to ‘useless’ to 
give it a little more semantic stretch, if not enough to deter 
any rebuttals from the opposition. But to express with any 
adequacy a sense of the sucking uselessness of everything, 
a nonlinguistic modality would be needed, some effusion 
out of a dream that coalesced every nuance of the useless 
and wordlessly transmitted to us the inanity of any possible 
thing, conception, or condition. Indigent of such means of 
communication, the uselessness of all that exists or possibly 
could exist must be spoken with a poor potency.

Of course, everyone believes there are things, 
conceptions, and conditions that are not useless. We all live 
within relative frameworks where something may not be 
useless – in a practical way – with respect to something 
else. A potato masher is not useless if one wants to mash 
potatoes. For some people, a system of being that includes 
a god may not seem useless, possibly because it involves 
concepts such as eternity and infinity. Yet even something 
that involves concepts such as eternity and infinity is 
not saved from being useless except within a relative 
framework of what is not eternal or infinite. It would then 
not be useless only in the same relative capacity as a potato 
masher. As long as there are entities that are relative to one 
another, they will be potato-masher entities. And if there 
were a god that had no relation to anything that was not 
that god – that was not relative to anything because nothing 
else existed – then such a thing would be the paradigm of 
uselessness, being that there would be nothing for which it 
could not be useless. Should that god drum up a universe in 
which there were things for which it would not be useless, 
it could only be a potato-masher god. Far more likely in the 
minds of many people is that the universe was drummed 
up without a god, thereby making the uselessness of that 
universe, except in the potato-masher relations of its part, 
unbelievably evident. Some people do not get up in arms 
about the relativity of everything; others do. The latter 
want to worship gods that are not just potato-masher gods 
or to think in terms of absolutes that are really absolute 
and not just absolute potato-mashers. They cannot accept 
an existence in which everything is malignantly useless 
except as some species of potato masher. They particularly 
do not like to think that they themselves are potato-masher 
things living potato-masher lives in a potato-masher world. 
Christians, Jews, and Muslims have a real problem with a 
potato-masher world. Buddhists have no problem with it 
because for them the way to salvation is to realize the truth 
of ‘dependent origination’, which means that everything 
is related to everything else in a great network of potato 
mashers that are always interacting with one another. 
So the only problem Buddhists have is not being able to 
realize that everything is a great network of potato mashers. 
They think that if they could get over this hump, then they 
would be forever liberated from suffering. In the Buddhist 
faith, everyone suffers who cannot see that the world is 
a malignantly useless potato-mashing network. Contrary 
to Christians, Jews, and Muslims, Buddhists do not have 
the handicap of believing in a god or even in their own 
reality, although they do have other handicaps.
Discontent
Being royally conscious of the solemn precincts in which 
we exist, of the savage wasteland and sordid burlesque that 
lies beneath life’s piddling nonsense, would turn us to dust. 
Saddled with self-knowledge, we thrive only insofar as we 
vigilantly obfuscate our heads with every baseless belief or 
frivolous recreation at our disposal. But as much as our 
heads are inclined to clog themselves with such trash, a 
full-scale blockage is impossible. This impossibility makes 
us heirs to a legacy of discontent. In his study Suicide (1897), 
the French sociologist Emile Durkheim contended that 
‘one does not advance when one proceeds toward no goal, 
or – which is the same thing – when the goal is infinity. 
To pursue a goal which is by definition unattainable is to 
condemn oneself to a state of perpetual unhappiness’. Who 
can gainsay that the goal of our race has no visible horizon 

COLLAPSE IV
242
Ligotti – Thinking Horror / Kulik – Dead Monkeys
243
and therefore, in Durkheim’s view, we are doomed, as the 
French thinker rather euphemistically put it, to ‘a state of 
perpetual unhappiness’? Along similar lines, psychoanalyst 
Adam Phillips writes in his Darwin’s Worms: On Life Stories 
and Death Stories:14 ‘Tyrannical fantasies of our own 
perfectibility lurk in even our simplest ideals, Darwin and 
Freud intimate, so that any ideal can become another excuse 
for punishment. Lives dominated by impossible ideals, 
complete honesty, absolute knowledge, perfect happiness, 
eternal love are experienced as continuous failures.’ (Phillips’ 
twist of mind may be seen as self-serving due to his belief in 
psychoanalysis, which by its nature is not designed to make 
people happy on a tight schedule, or to make them happy 
at all). To counter these glum assessments of things, the 
world’s religions all offer goals that they say are very much 
attainable, if only in the afterlife or the next life. 
In The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), existentialist superstar 
Albert Camus represents the unattainable goal of the 
title figure as an apologetic for going on with life rather 
than ending it. As Camus insisted in his discussion of this 
gruesome parable, ‘We must imagine Sisyphus as happy.’ 
The credo of the Church Father Tertullian, ‘I believe 
because it is absurd’, might as rightly be attributed to Camus. 
Caught between the fabrications of the Carthaginian and 
the rationalizations of the Frenchman, Zapffe’s proposal 
that we put out the light of the human race extends to us 
a solution to our troubles that is infinitely more satisfying 
than that of either Tertullian or his modern avatar Camus, 
who considered suicide as a philosophical issue for the 
individual yet, by some oversight, did not entertain the 
advantages of an all-out attrition of the species. Aside from 
14. London: Faber, 1999.
a repertoire of tricks we can do that other animals cannot, 
the truest indicator of a human being is unhappiness. 
The main fount of that unhappiness, as Zapffe and others 
have written, is our consciousness. And the more dilated 
consciousness becomes, the more unhappy the human. In 
the end, Camus’ injunction that we must imagine Sisyphus 
as happy is as unavailing as it is feculent.
On the subject of whether or not life is worth the trouble, 
the answer must always be unambivalent . . . and positive. 
To teeter the least bit into the negative is tantamount to 
moral suicide. If you value your values, no doubts about 
this matter can be raised, unless they occur as a lead-up to 
some determinate affirmation. In the products of high or 
low culture, philosophical disquisitions, and arid chitchat, 
the anthem of life must forever roar above the squeaks of 
dissent and must be delivered to us without abatement 
or appreciable contradiction. We were all born into a 
rollicking game that has been too long in progress to allow a 
substantive change in the rules. Should the incessant fanfare 
that meets your ears day in and day out sound out of tune 
and horribly inappropriate, you will be branded persona non 
grata and welcome wagons will not stop at your door. So if 
you know what is best for you and want a good seat from 
which to watch human existence as it goes by, you must not 
recognize Zapffe’s proposal for the salvation-by-extinction 
of the human race as a solution to the absurdity of life.
Those who treasure philosophical and literary works of 
a pessimistic, nihilistic, or defeatist nature as indispensable 
to their existence are hopelessly frustrated with living in a 
world on autopilot when they would like to switch it over 
to manual consciousness and nosedive humanity into a 
crash without survivors. On the flip side, most ordinary 

Ligotti – Thinking Horror / Kulik – Dead Monkeys

people can live with discontent because it is concomitant 
with their expectation that humanity will forever ‘survive’ 
(Middle English by way of Middle French from the Latin 
supervivere – to outlive or live beyond). Bulletin: we, as 
a subcategory of the mélange of earth’s organisms, may 
outlive other species, but we will not live beyond our own 
time of extinction, as over ninety-nine percent of preceding 
life forms on this planet have not lived beyond theirs. We 
can pretend this will not happen, fantasizing super-scientific 
eternities, but in good time we will be taken out of the scene. 
This turn of events will be the defeat of Project Immortality, 
which has been in the works for millennia. 
Mistake
Consciousness is an existential liability, as every pessimist 
agrees. It is also a mistake that has taken humankind down 
a black hole of logic: to make it through this life, we must 
pretend that we are what we are not, according to Zapffe’s 
Paradox. To correct this mistake, we should desist from 
procreating. What could be more judicious or more urgent? 
At the very least, we might give some regard to this theory 
of the mistake as a ‘thought-experiment’. All civilizations 
become defunct. All species die out. All the suns of all the 
galaxies will blow up. There may even be an expiration 
date on the universe itself. Human beings would certainly 
not be the first phenomenon to go belly up. But we could 
be the first to spot our design-flaw, that absent-minded 
flub of nature called consciousness, and do something 
about it. And if we are mistaken about consciousness 
being a mistake, our self-removal from this planet would 
still be a magnificent move on our part, the most laudable 
masterstroke of our existence, and the only one. No evil

would attend our departure from existence, and the many 
evils we have known would go extinct along with us.
Taking our leave from life might seem a thoroughly 
negative course of action, but it is not as simple as that. 
Every negation is adulterated or secretly initiated by an 
affirmative spirit, mass suicide included. An unequivocal 
‘no’ cannot be uttered or acted upon. Lucifer’s last words in 
heaven may have been ‘Non serviam’, but none has served 
the Almighty so well, since His sideshow in the clouds 
would never draw any customers if it were not for the main 
attraction of the devil’s hell on earth. Only catatonics and 
coma patients have what it takes to sit out the horseplay of 
creation. Without a ‘yes’ in our hearts, nothing would be 
done. And to be done with our existence en masse would be 
the most ambitious affirmation of all.
With regard to consciousness, ‘fluke’ or ‘mutation’, 
rather than ‘mistake’, would be more accurate terms in the 
present discussion, since it is not in the nature of Nature 
to make mistakes – it just makes what it makes. ‘Mistake’ 
has been used for its pejorative connotation in ‘The Last 
Messiah’. Of course, phenomena other than consciousness 
have been thought to be a mistake, beginning with life itself. 
For example, in a novel titled At the Mountains of Madness 
(1936), the American writer H. P. Lovecraft has one of his 
characters mention a ‘primal myth’ about ‘Great Old Ones 
who filtered down from the stars and concocted earth life 
as a joke or mistake’. Schopenhauer, once he has drafted 
his theory that everything in the universe is energized 
by a Will-to-live, shifts to a commonsense pessimism to 
visualize a species inattentive to the possibility that its life is 
a concatenation of snafus.
Many millions, united into nations, strive for the common 
good, each individual for his own sake; but many thousands 
fall sacrifice to it. Now senseless delusion, now intriguing 
politics, incite them to wars with one another; then the sweat 
and blood of the multitude must flow, to carry through the 
ideas of individuals, or to atone for their shortcomings. In 
peace, industry and trade are active, inventions work miracles, 
seas are navigated, delicacies are collected from all the ends 
of the earth; the waves engulf thousands. All push and drive, 
some plotting and planning, others acting; the tumult is 
indescribable. But what is the ultimate aim of it all? To sustain 
ephemeral and harassed individuals through a short span of 
time, in the most fortunate cases with endurable want and 
comparative painlessness (though boredom is at once on the 
lookout for this), and then the propagation of this race and of 
its activities. With this evident want of proportion between the 
effort and the reward, the will-to-live, taken objectively, appears 
to us from this point of view as a folly, or taken subjectively, 
as a delusion. Seized by this, every living thing works with the 
utmost exertion of its strength for something that has no value. 
But on closer consideration, we shall find here also that it is 
rather a blind urge, an impulse wholly without ground and 
motive.15 
Schopenhauer is here straightforward in limning his 
awareness that, for human beings, being alive is all ‘folly’ 
and ‘delusion’. He also noted elsewhere in his work that 
consciousness is ‘an accident of life’. 
Schopenhauer’s is a great pessimism, not least because 
it revealed a pattern underlying the pessimistic imagination. 
As indicated, Schopenhauer’s insights are yoked to a 
philosophical superstructure centered on the Will, or the 
15. The World as Will and Representation, trans. E. J. F. Payne (NY: Dover, 1969).

COLLAPSE IV
248
Will-to-live, a blind, deaf, and dumb force that surfaced for 
reasons unknown, assembled a universe, and, once human 
bodies had shot up within it, mobilized them to their 
detriment. While Schopenhauer’s metaphysics is impossible 
to swallow and could never persuade anyone of its validity, 
no intelligent person can fail to see that every living thing 
behaves exactly in conformance with his thought in its liberal 
articulation: wound up like toys by some force – call it Will, 
élan vital, anima mundi, or whatever – organisms go on running 
until they run down. In pessimistic philosophies, only the 
force is real, not the things that are activated by it. They are 
only automata, puppets, and, if they have consciousness 
mistakenly, believe that they are self-winding selves and not 
self-conscious nothings suffering from Zapffe’s Paradox. 
Here, then, is the pattern Schopenhauer made discernable 
in pessimism: behind and beyond the scene of life, there 
are machinations that are not amenable to resistance 
or control. For Zapffe, consciousness is a mistake, but it 
is also a mystery whose workings elude us while we are 
tugged along by the invisible hand of nature to survive and 
reproduce. For Unamuno, we are prodded by an irrational 
and irresistible vitalism to letch after immortality. For 
Michelstaedter, individuals are fitted into a straightjacket 
by faceless doctors who control their patients’ minds with 
unrealities. For Mainländer, a Will-to-die, not a Will-to-live, 
plays the occult master pulling our strings.
Of a kind with these scheming powers that the pessimist 
places in the background of life are those enormities that 
skulk within the narratives of the great supernatural horror 
writers. In conceiving Azathoth, that ‘nuclear chaos’ which 
‘bubbles at the center of all infinity’, Lovecraft might 
well have been thinking of Schopenhauer’s Will. In ‘The 

COLLAPSE IV
250
Ligotti – Thinking Horror / Kulik – Dead Monkeys
251
Willows’, the twentieth-century British writer Algernon 
Blackwood suggests the existence of a minatory force as 
unseen and pitiless as Zapffe’s Nature. Such supernatural 
writers are great because they do not follow the rules of 
popular horror literature: there are no ‘good versus evil’ 
scenarios in their stories and no one need survive to make 
for a good ending. Human beings are set up to be destroyed, 
as they are in reality, and their destruction occurs not in 
an everyday world bustling with life and pleasure but in 
hermetic haunts bustling with death and suffering.
Ecocide
Despite Zapffe’s work as a philosopher, although not in 
an occupational capacity (he earned his living by writing 
poems, plays, stories, and humorous pieces), he is nonetheless 
better known as an early ecologist who popularized the 
term ‘biosophy’ to name a discipline that would broaden 
the compass of philosophy to include the interests of other 
living things besides human beings. Thereupon, he serves as 
an inspiration to the environmentalist agenda, the politics of 
the health of the earth. Here, too, we catch ourselves – and 
Zapffe himself, as he affirmed – in the act of conspiring to 
build barricades against the odious facts of life by isolation, 
anchoring, distraction, and sublimation as we engage in an 
activity (in this case the cause of environmentalism) that 
bypasses the perennial issue. Vandalism of the environment 
is but a sidebar to humanity’s refusal to look its fate in the 
face. We live in a habitat of unrealities – not of earth, air, 
water, and wildlife – and cuddly illusion trumps grim logic 
every time. Some of the more militant environmentalists, 
however, have concurred with Zapffe that we should retire 
from existence, although their advocacy of abstinence and 
universal suicide to save the earth from being pillaged by 
human beings is not exactly what the philosopher had in 
mind. While a worldwide suicide pact is highly appealing, 
what romantic fabrications would cause one to take part in 
it just to conserve this planet? The earth is not our home. 
We came from nothing, and to that condition our nostalgia 
should turn. Why would anyone care about this dim bulb 
in the blackness of space? The earth produced us, or at 
least subsidized our evolution. Is it really entitled to receive 
a pardon, never mind the sacrifice of human lives, for this 
original sin – a capital crime in reverse (just as reproduction 
makes one an accessory before the fact to an individual’s 
death)? Someone once said that nature abhors a vacuum. 
This is precisely why nature should be abhorred. Instead, 
the nonhuman environment is simultaneously extolled and 
ravaged by a company of poor players who can no longer 
act naturally. It is one thing for animals to feed and fight 
and breed in an unthinking continuance of their existence. 
It is quite another for humans to do so, since it is possible 
for us to ask the wholly legitimate question: ‘Is it really all 
right for us to be alive and know that we will die?’ 
It might be theorized that the human species evolved to 
serve as nature’s roundabout way of cutting into its veins 
and bleeding out. A strange idea, no protesting that, but 
not the strangest we have ever heard or lived by. We could 
at least take up the theory and see where it leads. If it is 
false, then where is the harm? But until it is proven so, we 
must let ourselves be drawn along by nature’s plan, as we 
always have, if only by twiddling our thumbs and letting 
its suicidal course continue without interference. From a 
human vantage, would this not be a just self-punishment 
on nature’s part for fashioning a world in which pain is 

COLLAPSE IV
252
Ligotti – Thinking Horror / Kulik – Dead Monkeys
253
essential, a world that could not exist without pain, a world 
where pain is the guiding principle of all organisms, which 
are inexorably pushed by pain throughout their lives to 
do that which will improve their chances to create more of 
themselves? Left unchecked, this process will last as long as 
a single cell remains quivering in this cesspool of the solar 
system, this toilet of the galaxy. So why not lend a hand in 
assisting nature’s suicide, in case it has second thoughts? 
For want of a deity, let the earth take the blame for our 
troubles. What else is it good for? Let it save itself if it can 
– the condemned are known for the acrobatics they will 
execute to wriggle out of their sentences – but if it cannot 
destroy what it has made, then may it perish along with 
every other living thing it has brought forth in pain. While 
pain is not a problem for species, even a hyper-conscious 
hive of creatures such as human beings for whom pain has 
been upgraded to suffering, it is not a phenomenon whose 
praises are often sung.
Deicide
The idea of a self-destructing nature parallels 
Mainländer’s fantasy in which the Will-to-die that should 
inhere in humanity is only a reflection of the death wish 
of a God who, in the beginning, masterminded His own 
quietus from an existence He did not want to spin out 
any longer than it had already been spun. God’s plan to 
suicide himself could not work, though, while he existed as 
a unified entity outside of space-time and matter. Seeking 
to nullify His oneness so that He could be delivered into 
nothingness, he disintegrated Himself – big bang-like – 
into the time-bound fragments of the universe, which 
included organic life forms. In Mainländer’s philosophy, 
‘God knew that he could change from a state of super-reality 
into non-being only through the development of a real 
world of multiformity.’ Through this method, He excluded 
Himself from existence. ‘God is dead’, wrote Mainländer, 
‘and His death was the life of the world’. Once the great 
individuation had been accomplished, the momentum of 
its creator’s self-annihilation would continue until nothing 
remained standing. And those who committed suicide, as 
did Mainländer, would only be following God’s example 
and moving toward the end of the Creation. Furthermore, 
the Will-to-live that Schopenhauer argued activates the 
world  was revised by his disciple Mainländer as evidence 
not of a movement of a tortured life within beings, but as a 
deceptive cover for an underlying will in all things to burn 
themselves out as hastily as possible in the fires of becoming 
... or begoing, as it were. In this light, human progress is 
shown to be an ironic symptom that our downfall into 
extinction has been progressing nicely, because the more 
things changed, the more they progressed toward a reliable 
end.
While the wisdom of religions such as Christianity 
and Buddhism is all for leaving this world behind, their 
leave-taking is for destinations unknown and impossible to 
conceive. For Mainländer, these destinations do not exist. 
His forecast is that one day our will to survive in this life or 
any other will be universally extinguished by a conscious 
will to die and stay dead, after the example of God. 
From the standpoint of Mainländer’s philosophy, Zapffe’s 
Last Messiah would not be an unwelcome sage but a 
crowning force that has been in the works since God took 
his own life. Rather than resist our end, as Mainländer 
concludes, we will come to see that the knowledge that life 

COLLAPSE IV
254
is worthless is the flower of all human wisdom. Elsewhere 
the philosopher states, Life is hell, and the sweet still night 
of absolute death is the annihilation of hell. Mainländer’s 
cosmic scenario, inhospitable as it is to all other ideations 
that include a god-figure, should give pause to those 
absorbed with supernatural schemes that are no less bizarre 
(for example, the much-studied soteriology of the Gnostics). 
Consider this: if God exists, or once existed, what would 
He not be capable of doing? Why should God not want 
to be done with Himself as a reaction to His suffering the 
sickness and pain now reflected in His creation? Why 
should He not have kicked off a universe that is one great 
puppet show destined by Him to be crunched or scattered 
until an absolute nothingness has been established? Why 
should He fail to see the benefits of nonexistence, as many 
of us lesser beings have? Alone and immortal, nothing 
needed Him. In the same way, nothing in this world needs 
us, which could be why we created a god who pays attention 
to everything we do, since no other organism cares about 
us or could be diminished by our extinction. (Quite the 
opposite). Mainländer’s first philosophy, and last, is in fact 
odd, but no more so than those of any religious or secular 
ethos that presupposes the worth of human life. Both are 
objectively insupportable and come out of nowhere: they 
are only propensities in search of validation.16

and Notices Philosophy and Psychological, 1895; Rudolph Steiner’s The Riddles of Philosophy,

Reading, 1986; and Henry Sheldon’s Unbelief in the Nineteenth Century, 2005. For a

October 1897 issue of the journal Lucifer.

Pessimism
It would be a sign of callowness to bemoan the fact that 
pessimistic writers do not rate and may be denounced in 
both good conscience and good company. This judgment 
makes every kind of sense in a world of card-carrying or 
crypto-optimists. Once you understand that, you can spare 
yourself from suffering excessively at the hands of ‘normal 
people’, a pestilent confederation of upstanding creatures 
who in concert keep the conspiracy going by rehashing 
their patented banalities and watchwords. This is not 
to say that such people do not have their struggles and 
responsibilities, their pains and sufferings, and their deaths 
by accident, murder, or disease, which only makes all the 
more pestilent their normal thinking that being alive is all 
right and that happiness should attend upon the arrival 
of life’s newcomers, who, it is always assumed, will be 
normal.
Phobic to any somber cast of thought, humankind 
as nonetheless imbibed ever-increasing disillusionments 
throughout its history. The biblical Genesis, along with all 
other fables of origination, has been reduced to a mythic 
analogue of the big bang theory and the primordial soup. 
Pantheon after pantheon has been belittled into ‘things 
people used to believe’. And petitions for divine intervention 
are murmured only inside the tents of religious fanatics and 
faith-healers. In the past century or so, disillusionments of 
this kind have become the province of specialists in the 
various sciences, so they are not well understood by, if 
known to, those who go to church on Sunday and read 
the astrology column in the newspaper the rest of the 
week. Generalists of disillusionment broadcast on a wider 
frequency. Yet their message, a repetitive dirge that has 

COLLAPSE IV
258
been rehearsed for thousands of years, is received only 
by epicures of pessimism, cognitive mavericks who have 
impetuously circled the field in a race to the finish line.
Contemporaneous with every generation, disillusionment 
must proceed furtively. Anyone caught trying to accelerate 
its progression will be reprimanded and told to sit in the 
corner. While the Church has lost its clout to kill or torture 
dissenters such as Zapffe, Schopenhauer, and Lovecraft, 
they are still under watch by guard dogs both sacred and 
secular. A sign of progress, some would say. But sufferance 
of such minds should not lead us into premature self-
congratulation. The pace at which our kind plods toward 
disillusionment is geologically slow, and humanity can be 
cocksure of kicking the bucket by natural causes or an ‘act 
of God’ before it travels very far toward that radiant day 
when with one voice it might cry out, ‘Enough of this error 
of conscious life. It shall be passed down no longer to those 
innocents unborn’.

Spectral Dilemma1
Quentin Meillassoux
Mourning to come, god to come.1
[…] every man has two things belonging to him, namely, a life 
and a phantom.2
1. The Spectral Dilemma
What is a spectre?  A dead person who has not been 
properly mourned, who haunts us, bothers us, refusing 
to pass over to the ‘other side’, where the dearly-departed 
can accompany us at a distance sufficient for us to live our 
own lives without forgetting them, but also without dying 
their death – without being the prisoner of the repetition 
of their final moments. Then what is a spectre become the 
essence of the spectre, the spectre par excellence?  A dead 
person whose death is such that we cannot mourn them.

in hearing their voices, the mere shadow of a living being. 
The question which poses itself to us is thus the following: 
is essential mourning possible – and if so, under what conditions?
Is it possible, after a twentieth century whose history was 
dominated by odious deaths, to live a non-morbid relation 
with the departed, for the most part unknown to us, and 
yet still too close for our lives not to be secretly gnawed 
away at by them? At first glance, we seem to find ourselves 
constrained to respond in the negative. For this essential 
mourning seems impossible to envisage if it is referred to 
the general alternative of which the relation to the departed 
seems to admit. This alternative can be stated, summarily, 
in very simple terms: either God exists, or he doesn’t. 
Or more generally: either a merciful spirit, transcending 
humanity, is at work in the world and its beyond, bringing 
justice for the departed; or such a transcendent principle is 
absent. Now, it becomes rapidly apparent that neither of 
these two options – let’s call them for convenience religious 
or atheistic, however innumerable the ways in which they 
can be configured – allows the requisite mourning to take 
place. To say that God exists, or that he does not – whatever 
is thought through these two statements, both are paths to 
despair when confronted with spectres. To demonstrate 
this, let us directly exhibit, in the form of ‘cases for the 
defence’, what appear to us to be the strongest responses of 
each position to the challenge of such a mourning.
Take the following religious apology: ‘I might hope 
to come to terms with my own death, but not that of 
terrible deaths. It is terror in confronting these past deaths, 
irremediably past, not my coming end, which makes me 
believe in God. Certainly, if my disappearance, by some 
chance, should be terrible, then I shall die hoping for myself 
That is to say: a dead person for whom the work of 
mourning, the passage of time, proves inadequate for a 
tranquil bond between them and the living to be envisaged. 
A dead person the horror of whose death lays heavy not 
only upon their nearest and dearest, but upon all those who 
cross the path of their history.
Essential spectres are those of terrible deaths: premature 
deaths, odious deaths, the death of a child, the death of 
parents knowing their children are destined to the same end 
– and yet others. Natural or violent deaths, deaths which 
cannot be come to terms with either by those whom they 
befall, or by those who survive them. Essential spectres 
are the dead who will always refuse to ‘pass over’, who 
obstinately cast off their shroud to declare to the living, 
in spite of all evidence, that they still belong amongst 
them. Their end attests to no meaning, brings with it 
no completion. These are not necessarily shadows who 
declare their revenge, but shadows who cry out beyond all 
vengeance. Whoever commits the imprudence of lending 
an ear to their call risks passing the rest of his life hearing 
their complaint.
We will call essential mourning the completion of mourning 
for essential spectres: that is to say the accomplishment of a 
living, rather than morbid, relation of the survivors to these 
terrible deaths. Essential mourning assumes the possibility 
of forming a vigilant bond with these departed which does 
not plunge us into the hopeless fear – itself mortifying – 
that we feel when faced with their end, but which, on the 
contrary, actively inserts their memory into the fabric of our 
existence. To accomplish essential mourning would mean: 
to live with essential spectres, thereby no longer to die with 
them. To make these spectres live rather than becoming,

noble words – love, justice – with his odious practices: isn’t 
this a good definition of hell? You say that in the dazzling 
presence of such a God, I will grasp the infinitely loving 
nature of his attitude to his creatures? You only succeed in 
exacerbating the nightmare you promise: for you suppose 
that this being has the power to spiritually transform me in 
such a radical fashion as to make me love He who allows 
such atrocities to occur, for having let those atrocities occur. 
This is a promise of a spiritual death infinitely worse than 
a merely bodily death: in the presence of God, I will cease 
to love the Good, for He would have the power to make 
me love Evil as if it were Good. If God exists, the exit of 
the dead is thus aggravated to infinity: their bodily death is 
redoubled in their spiritual death. To this hell you wish for 
them, I prefer, for them as for myself, nothingness, which 
will leave them in peace and conserve their dignity, rather 
than putting them at the mercy of the omnipotence of your 
pitiless Demiurge.’
We can see that each of these two positions is only 
supported by the weakness of the other: the atheist is 
atheist because religion promises a fearful God; the believer 
anchors his faith in the refusal of a life devastated by the 
despair of terrible deaths. Each masks his specific despair 
by exhibiting his avoidance of the other’s despair. Thus the 
dilemma is as follows: either to despair of another life for 
the dead, or to despair of a God who has let such deaths 
take place.
We will call spectral dilemma the aporetic alternative of 
atheism and religion when confronted with the mourning 
of essential spectres.3 In this aporetic alternative, we 
3. I have called ‘religious’ every position which brings together the thesis of a life 
beyond the grave with the existence of a personal God; ‘atheistic’ every position 
what I hope for spectres. But I myself am but a spectre in 
waiting. I can be Sadducean for myself, and for others, but 
I will always be Pharisean for spectres. Or again: I might 
be rigorously atheist for myself, might refuse to believe in 
immortality for myself, but I could never do so for them: 
For the idea that all justice is impossible for the innumerable 
massed spectres of the past corrodes my very core, so that 
I can no longer bear with the living. Certainly, it is they, 
the living, who need help, not the dead; but I think that 
help to the living can only proceed given some hope for 
justice for the dead. The atheist might well deny it: for my 
part if I were to renounce this, I could not live. I must hope 
for something for the dead also, or else life is vain. This 
something is another life, another chance to live – to live 
something other than that death which was theirs.’
Now take the following, atheist response: ‘You want to 
hope, you say, for something for the dead. Let’s look closer, 
then, at what you promise them. You hope for justice in 
the next world: but in what would this consist? It would 
be a justice done under the auspices of a God who had 
himself allowed the worst acts to be committed, in the case 
of criminal deaths, or who himself had committed them, 
in the case of natural deaths. You call just, and even good, 
such a God. But what would you think of this: the promise 
to live eternally under the reign of a being called just and 
loving, who has, however, let men, women and children 
die in the worst circumstances, when he could have saved 
them without any difficulty whatsoever; who has even 
directly inflicted such sorrows – And even this, He says, as 
a mark of his infinite (and thus mysterious, unfathomable) 
love for the creatures he thus afflicts. To live under the

Let us begin by exposing what we shall call the 
‘formal’ conditions for a resolution of the dilemma. These 
conditions constitute at once the irreducibly legitimate part 
of the two preceding positions – atheistic and religious – 
and the source of the aporia.  Each of these positions of the 
dilemma exhibits, we believe, an indispensable element of 
essential mourning:
the religious position establishes that mourning 
–	
is not possible unless we can hope for the dead 
something other than their death. The spectres 
will not pass over to the other world until the day 
we might hope to see them rejoin ours.
The atheistic position establishes that the 
–	
existence of God is an insurmountable obstacle 
to the elaboration of such despair, for only a 
perverse God could permit terrible deaths, and 
only an even more perverse God could make 
himself loved for doing so.
The aporia stems from the fact that these two conditions, 
equally indispensable, appear incompatible. There is only 
one way, then, to lift this impasse: we must prove that the 
incompatibility between these conditions is only apparent, 
and that there exists a third option, neither religious nor 
atheistic, capable of coherently combining the two elements 
of the response. From this point on, our path is clear: 
resolving the dilemma comes down to making thinkable the statement 
oscillate between the absurdity of a life without God, and 
the mystery of a God who calls ‘love’ his laissez-faire and 
production of extreme evil: the double form of a failure to 
accomplish essential mourning. On the contrary, we will 
call a resolution of the spectral dilemma a position which 
would be neither religious nor atheist, and which, because 
of this, would manage to extract itself from the double 
despair inherent to their alternative: despairing at the belief 
in justice for the dead, or believing despairingly in a God 
without justice. Our question concerning the possibility of 
essential mourning can be reformulated as follows: Under 
what conditions could we hope to resolve the spectral dilemma? 
How to think a bond between the living and dead which 
extracts itself from the twofold distress of the atheist and 
the religious believer?
To sketch a possible response to this question, we 
must proceed in the following fashion: we must exhibit 
the conditions of a solution to the dilemma, and evaluate 
the theoretical legitimacy of the latter along with its 
credibility. We do not exclude, of course, the possibility 
that this solution might eventually turn out to be illusory, 
and that we might have in the end to renounce extracting 
ourselves from the atheo-religious alternative. But this 
potential renunciation must proceed only from the precise 
examination of the solution. Not being able to present the 
which recuses both of these theses. One might certainly conceive of positions 
which derogate from this convenient classification: Sadduceanism, evoked above, 
conjugates the belief in a personal God with the refusal of immortality; Spinozism, 
on the other hand, conjugates the recusal of a personal God with the thesis of a 
possible immortality. However, such positions do not change the essential point of 
the analysis: the incapacity of the principal systems of representation to resolve the 
spectral dilemma. In the case of Sadduceanism, I add to the despair of an evil God 
the despair of the non-resurrection of the dead; in the case of Spinozism, I must 
renounce all hope of a happy immortality for those who perished too soon to accede 
to wisdom, and accommodate myself to the pitiless necessity which presides over 
this type of destiny.

It is a question of maintaining that God is possible – not in 
a subjective and synchronous sense (in the sense that I 
maintain that it is possible that God currently exists), but in 
an objective future sense (where I maintain that God could 
really come about in the future).  At stake is the unknotting 
of the atheo-religious link between God and necessity (God 
must or must not exist) and its reattachment to the virtual 
(God could exist).
The question then takes on a greater precision: 
resolving the spectral dilemma comes down to exhibiting 
the exact sense of the divine inexistence, at the same time as 
establishing that one can legitimately adhere to it.
The thesis – God no longer exists – can be decomposed 
according to two poles of signification which must then be 
studied consecutively:
What must be signified by a ‘no longer’, in order 
1.	
for a god to be thought as one of its eventualities? 
Such an examination comes down to thinking the 
signification of a time compatible with essential 
mourning: What is time, if it contains the divine 
as one of its virtualities, and what could legitimate 
our belief in the effectivity of the latter?
What does the signifier ‘god’ really mean once the 
2.	
latter is no longer posited as existing – as possible 
and to come, but no longer as actual and necessary? 
Such an examination would necessitate, notably, 
an elaboration of the elements of a discourse on 
the divine distinct from all theology founded on 
the thesis of an eternal God.
Within the confines of the present article we can only 
broach the first point. We will thus agree here to understand 
conjugating the possible resurrection of the dead – the religious 
condition of the resolution – and the inexistence of God – the 
atheistic condition of the resolution. These two elements 
will be synthesised in the following statement, which will 
occupy our attention from now on:
God no longer exists.
This statement formulates a thesis which we will call 
the thesis of divine inexistence, an expression that must be 
understood in the twofold sense that permits its equivocity. 
Firstly, in an immediate fashion, the divine inexistence 
signifies the inexistence of the religious God, but also the 
metaphysical God, supposed actually existent as Creator 
or Principle of the world. But the divine inexistence also 
signifies the divine character of inexistence: in other words, the 
fact that what remains still in a virtual state in present reality 
harbours the possibility of a God still to come, become 
innocent of the disasters of the world, and in which one 
might anticipate the power to accord to spectres something 
other than their death.
The position of the divine inexistence allows us to 
grasp the source of the apparent insolubility of the spectral 
dilemma. The latter comes from the fact that atheism and 
religion seem to constitute an alternative exhausting all the 
possibilities: either God exists, or he does not. But the two 
theses are in truth stronger than these factual statements: 
for their sense lies in the supposedly necessary character of 
either the inexistence or the existence of God. To be atheist 
is not simply to maintain that God does not exist, but also 
that he could not exist; to be a believer is to have faith in 
the essential existence of God. We now see that the thesis 
of the divine inexistence must, to gain ground against such 
an alternative, shift the battle to the terrain of modalities:

271
must say of the sought-after God not only that it must be 
posited as inexistent and possible, but also that it can only 
be conceived as contingent and unmasterable. This God, in fact, 
cannot be posited except as contingent, in the sense that, if 
its thinkability supposes that nothing prohibits its advent, 
inversely, no destinal law can be supposed to guarantee 
its emergence, for such a supposition is still theoretically 
exorbitant. It must be able to be, but nothing can be 
thought that constrains it to be. And this God can only be 
thought as unmasterable in its advent, in the sense that it 
must exceed all phantasmatic hopes of absolute domination 
of nature on the part of man. Neither Prometheanism of 
death vanquished, nor providentialism of a god to come – 
which are just exacerbated versions of atheism and religion 
confronted with the spectral dilemma – can found the hope 
of a solution.
Taking as granted the following hypotheses:
The laws of nature do not allow us to hold 
1.	
out any serious hope of a future rebirth of the 
departed.
Neither is there any hope of a transcendent 
2.	
Order of laws of nature, a bringer of justice for 
living and dead, whether actually at work, or in 
the course of emerging.
What outcome remains to us? It suffices, in response to 
this question, to determine what it is in such hypotheses 
that constitutes an obstacle to essential mourning: What 
seems to prohibit any resolution of the spectral dilemma, 
once I renounce the idea that a law exists, either natural or 
supernatural, capable of realising my hopes? The response 
is obvious: If I admit that there only exist natural laws 
incapable of resolving my dilemma, then this dilemma is 
by ‘god’ the minimal sense required for an essential 
mourning to be envisaged: the emergence of a regime of 
existence in which, for the spectres, something begins other 
than their death.
3. Speculative Treatment of Hume’s problem
What would a time capable of divine emergence be? 
And what could make us decide to adhere to the idea of 
such a time, knowing that our all-too-evident desire to 
believe, far from rendering the task easier for us, can only 
increase our suspicion in regard to every plea which flatters 
our hopes?
Before entering into the heart of the subject, let us begin 
by distinguishing the so-called ‘occult’ senses of the divine 
inexistence, that is to say those which rest upon the thesis 
that a hidden law exists, unknown for the moment, but 
capable of being at the origin of a redemption to come. This 
thesis comes down to an atheistic or religious interpretation 
of the divine inexistence, depending on whether it will be a 
question of founding the hope of rebirth on the Promethean 
mastery of death by a future humanity supposed technically 
capable of effectuating it; or a question of maintaining that 
a necessary process of divinisation of the world is already 
secretly in progress, which will culminate in universal 
justice for the living and the dead alike. In both cases, one 
maintains that an occult law exists upon which all hopes 
must rest: a natural law not yet known, of the resurrection 
of bodies, a providential law of progressive emergence of the 
divine – indemonstrable, even fantastic, theses, incapable in 
any case of supporting any serious hope.
But as soon as we prohibit ourselves any such path, we

so rather than otherwise, that is to say why they should 
remain in their current state rather than being arbitrarily 
modified from one moment to the next.
Now, our perspective is the inverse of Hume’s: for 
we propose on the contrary to start out from the effective 
possibility that natural laws might break down without reason, 
in favour of an eventality incompatible with them. For we 
pose the following question: since Hume has convinced us 
that we could a priori (that is to say without contradiction) 
conceive a chaotic modification of natural laws, why not 
have confidence in the power of thought, which invites us 
to posit the contingency of the laws of nature, rather than in 
experience, in which alone the presentation of the apparent 
fixity of observable constants finds its source? Why 
extrapolate the empirical fixity of laws into a belief in their 
necessity, rather than adhering to the intellection of a radical 
Chaos which Hume has masterfully, if implicitly, revealed 
to us? Why not, in other words, absolutise the failure of 
the Principle of Sufficient Reason, by maintaining that the 
meaning of that absence of reason for laws which we run 
up against in the Humean problem is not an incapacity of 
thought to discover such reasons, but a capacity of thought 
to intuit a priori, in the real itself, the effective absence of the 
reason of things as laws, and the possibility of their being 
modified at any moment? It would be a question of making 
of contingency the absolute property of every being, laws 
as well as things – a property which a redefined reason, a 
reason emancipated from the Principle of Sufficient Reason, would 
take as its task to conceive and to describe. Thus the idea 
presents itself of an inverted, rather than a reversed Platonism, 
a Platonism which would maintain that thought must free 
itself from the fascination for the phenomenal fixity of laws, 
insoluble, in so far as – but only in so far as – I admit also 
the necessity of the laws of nature. It is not the incompatibility 
between the laws of nature and the divine which prevents 
essential mourning: it is the belief in the necessity of such 
laws. And it is indeed this modal thesis which founds the 
atheistic belief in the impossibility of the existence of God, 
as of any event contradicting the attested constants.
The first question we must treat is thus as follows: what 
founds my adhesion to the necessity of laws, and thereby 
my refusal of any possible event’s contradicting them? 
Now, this problem is well-known since it is precisely the 
question posed by Hume concerning the rational justification of our 
belief in causal necessity. We are consequently confronted once 
more by this question, but – let us note well, for this is 
the speculative interest of the matter – we must tackle it 
‘backwards’ in relation to its traditional treatment.
Let us explain. The usual way of posing the question 
of causal necessity proceeds with the interrogation as 
formulated by Hume himself, and which can be stated 
as follows: it being understood that we believe in the 
necessity of laws, can this belief be founded in reason, so 
as to guarantee that laws will be in the future what they 
are today, all other circumstances being equal? The aporia 
encountered by Hume consists in the fact that neither logic 
nor experience are able to offer any such justification. 
For, on one hand, there is nothing contradictory in the 
observable constants being modified in the future; and, 
on the other, experience teaches us only about the present 
and the past, not the future. So that the supposed necessity 
of natural laws becomes an enigma since the Principle of 
Sufficient Reason cannot be effectively applied to it: We 
cannot rationally discover any reason why laws should be

the absolute. All metaphysics, according to this reading, 
cannot but be speculative; however, not all speculation 
is necessarily fated to be metaphysical. For speculation 
which founded itself on the radical falsity of the Principle of 
Sufficient Reason would describe an absolute which would 
not constrain things to being thus rather than otherwise, 
but which would constrain them to being able not to be 
how they are. We can therefore formulate the conclusion 
at which we wished to arrive at, namely that the existential 
resolution of the spectral dilemma passes by way of the speculative, but 
non-metaphysical, resolution of Hume’s problem.
*           *           *
A few words, to conclude, on the inexistent god.  How 
– according to what principles of investigation – might one 
attempt to designate its nature, once the latter is defined as 
a contingent effect of Chaos? On this point, we must agree 
to pose again, outside the transcendental field, a Kantian-
style question: What am I permitted to hope for, now that 
I can hope? What is a god which would be once more 
desirable, lovable, worthy of imitation? If one supposes 
granted the real eventuality of emergences in rupture with 
the present laws of nature, what will be the most singular 
possible divinity, the most interesting, the most ‘noble’ in a 
sense (paradoxically) close to Nietzsche’s? Must this future 
and immanent god be personal, or consist in a ‘harmony’, 
a becalmed community of living, of dead, and of reborn? 
We believe that precise responses to these questions can 
be envisaged, and that they determine an original regime 
of thought, in rupture with both atheism and theology: 
a divinology, yet to be constituted, through which will be 
fabricated, perhaps, new links between men and those who 
haunt them.
so as to accede to a purely intelligible Chaos capable of 
destroying and of producing, without reason, things and 
the laws which they obey.
Does this mean that we will have resolved Hume’s 
problem when we have posited the contingency of laws 
rather than their necessity? No, indeed, for we are then 
confronted by another problem, in the form of an objection 
expressing the reason why our thesis does not appear 
credible, namely: If laws could be modified without reason 
at any moment, it would be extraordinarily improbable if this 
possibility were never to manifest itself. And in truth, if 
matter could incessantly, in the least of its parts, follow 
innumerable different laws, the disorder would be such 
that there would not even be manifestation. This argument, 
as we know, is the very core of Kant’s transcendental 
deduction: the contingency of laws is incompatible with 
the constitutive stability of representation. But our task is 
more precise now: to resolve the reformulated Humean 
problem, we must refute such an inference, from the contingency of 
laws to a frequent, even frenetic, disorder, whether of matter or of 
representation; we must establish that the manifest stability 
of laws does not demand that we maintain their necessity. 
Such is the first problem – which is far from being the last – 
that the spectral dilemma obliges us to resolve if we would 
recuse the impossibility of a counter-natural event coming 
to pass.  From this point on, God must be thought as the 
contingent, but eternally possible, effect of a Chaos unsubordinated to 
any law.
Let us agree to call speculative all philosophies which 
accord to thought the capacity to accede to an absolute, and 
metaphysical all philosophies which ground themselves on a 
modality of the Principle of Sufficient Reason to accede to

Horror Temporis
In his ‘Notes on Writing Weird Fiction’ (1937) Lovecraft 
wrote that time played such a large part in his fiction because 
he found it ‘the most profoundly dramatic and grimly 
terrible thing in the universe’.1 On the one hand, the horror 
of time is not simply the trifling matter of individual human 
finitude, but rather the recognition of scientific statements 
concerning cosmic timescales that precede and exceed the 
existence of humanity and life itself. Unlike Engels, who 
hoped against hope for future relief from the second law of 
thermodynamics,2 Lovecraft only foresaw future extinction.

2. As Engels puts it, in the vein of William Hope Hodgson’s The Night Land (1912):
Millions of years may elapse, hundreds of thousands of generations be born and 
die, but inexorably the time will come when the declining warmth of the sun will 
no longer suffice to melt the ice thrusting itself forward from the poles; when the 
human race, crowding more and more about the equator, will finally no longer

	The question is of ‘the mode of manifestation’ of this 
operation, which Lovecraft regards as requiring an ‘object 
embodying the horror and phenomena observed’. His fiction 
works through images of these objects, through the domain 
of the imaginary, but only through the impasse where the 
imaginary touches upon the real. If scientific laws provide 
him with the final regulative guarantee of consistency then 
his fiction probes the inconsistency of ‘shattered natural 
law’ and the inconsistency of the object. To achieve this 
effect requires the gradual purification of the object from the 
regulation of representation. In the case of time this process 
can be traced in the last of his great texts: ‘The Shadow Out 
of Time’ (1936).4 Here it is a matter of what kind of object 
constitutes the shadow that falls from the outside – not a 
mystical outside of completed alterity, the tout Autre, but a 
material ‘outside’ which does not respond to the effect of 
law or to any correlation or relation to humanity.
That outside is named in the opening of the story as 
the ‘seething vortex of time’. The preliminary image of 
the vortex obviously derives from Poe and his use of the 
vortex in the form of a whirlpool in a number of his stories. 
Bergson and Deleuze Meillassoux approaches a subtractive thinking of matter as ‘an 
infinite madness’ in which,
we would have to conceive what our life would be if all the movements of the 
earth, all the noises of the earth, all the smells, the tastes, all the light – of the 
earth and of elsewhere, came to us in a moment, in an instant – like an atrocious 
screaming tumult of all things, traversing us continuously and instantaneously. 
(104)
Can we suggest that this is often the state of the Lovecraftian hero at the end of many 
of the stories? Can we also suggest, alongside Meillassoux, that this indicates the 
ruination of philosophy in ‘absolute communication’, the point at which Lovecraft 
indicates the collapse of the philosophical in chaos?

Omnibus 3: The Haunter of the Dark and Other Tales (London: Panther Books, 1985), 
464-544.
A science that produces time as indifferent to humanity is 
thus the source of the horror temporis. On the other hand, 
he writes that his stories are concerned with achieving the 
‘suspension or violation’ of natural laws in order to probe 
‘the infinite cosmic spaces beyond the radius of our sight 
and analysis.’ This suspension seems to promise an oneiric 
mysticism in the Dunsanian vein that escapes ‘the prison-
house of the known’ into the ‘enchanted lands of incredible 
adventures and infinite possibilities’. Thus, we seem to be 
left with the paradox of a horror based on science that 
threatens to proceed through an insipid anti-scientific 
mysticism. But Lovecraft’s actual solution, at least in his 
great texts, was more inventive: the suspension of natural 
laws would produce a new materialism which liberates us 
into the experience of the horror of time in its subtraction 
from any law and any relation.3
find even there enough heat for life; when gradually even the last trace of organic 
life will vanish; and the earth, an extinct frozen globe like the moon, will circle in 
deepest darkness and in an ever narrower orbit about the equally extinct sun, and 
at last fall into it. Other planets will have preceded it, others will follow it; instead 
of the bright, warm solar system with its harmonious arrangement of members, 
only a cold, dead sphere will still pursue its lonely path through universal space. 
And what will happen to our solar system will happen sooner or later to all the 
other systems of our island universe; it will happen to all the other innumerable 
island universes, even to those the light of which will never reach the earth while 
there is a living human eye to receive it.
And when such a solar system has completed its life history and succumbs to 
the fate of all that is finite, death, what then? Will the sun’s corpse roll on for all 
eternity through infinite space, and all the once infinitely diverse, differentiated
natural forces pass for ever into one single form of motion, attraction? ‘Or’ - as 
Secchi asks – ‘do forces exist in nature which can re-convert the dead system into 
its original state of an incandescent nebula and re-awake it to new life? We do 
not know’.

for these alien creatures ‘there was no such thing as time in 
its humanly accepted sense.’ During the period in which 
Lovecraft was writing, Heidegger and Bergson were trying 
to produce new concepts of time that would correlate, in 
however attenuated a fashion, with the human experience 
of time. What Lovecraft suggests is the detachment of 
time from any relation to humanity – proceeding without 
philosophy towards the real.
	This, though, is only the first object of horror temporis. 
Despite the monstrous nature of these creatures, Lovecraft’s 
narrator evinces considerable sympathy for the Great Race 
and their project to gather knowledge, and secure their 
future survival, by this process of mind exchange. The 
organisation of their social system by ‘a sort of fascistic 
socialism’ dominated by a clerisy implies a kind of cosmic 
Keynesian planner-State of the kind Lovecraft himself 
obviously approved. The crisis that State has to manage is 
the threat of the elder beings – the second object of horror. 
These ‘half polypous, utterly alien entities’ are only partly 
material (here we see the purification of the object) and 
dominated the earth six hundred million years ago. The 
Great Race would subdue these creatures beneath the cities 
they had built and which were then occupied by the Great 
Race. The old mole of alien class struggle had literally gone 
underground only to sporadically erupt in revolutions 
‘shocking beyond all description’. The final flight of the 
Great Race to new bodies would be caused by the ‘final 
successful irruption of the elder beings’.5
	This little allegory of 1917 and the New Deal requires 
little deciphering, especially after China Miéville’s reading 
5. H. P. Lovecraft ‘The Shadow Out of Time’, 502, 504, 505, 506.
Take, for example, this description from ‘A Descent into 
the Maelström’ (1841): ‘the interior surface of a funnel vast 
in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly 
smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but for 
the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around.’ In 
this case we have an image taken from nature that embodies 
a turbulent flow in excess of mechanistic materialism. This 
is nature itself as what Lacan would call antiphysis – a ‘rotten’, 
chaotic, fractured nature. Lovecraft radicalises this impasse 
of nature by not containing it within nature as an emergent 
fracture. Instead, as the ‘seething vortex of time’, the vortex 
becomes the chaotic space of the emergence of nature itself: 
the Outside. We no longer have a confined phenomena, a 
hole in the imaginary through which the real surges. Lacan 
would state that while the real does not lack anything, it is 
full of holes and one can even make a vacuum in it.
	The mode of manifestation proceeds through a 
number of supplementary objects of horror that embody 
the shadow that falls from outside. In the first instance the 
shadow falls on the story’s narrator, Nathaniel Peaslee, 
when he suffers from a strange experience of amnesia 
between 1908 and 1913 (the same period as Lovecraft’s 
own nervous breakdown). As the narrative unfolds it soon 
becomes evident that Peaslee had his mind exchanged with 
a member of the Great Race – alien beings that lived on 
the earth fifty million years before mankind and that have 
mastered the secret of time. When Peaslee returns to his 
body he finds that ‘my conception of time – my ability to 
distinguish between consecutiveness and simultaneousness 
– seemed subtly disordered’. This disorder of time can be 
explained as a result of the transference or interference by 
the Great Race, but also by the impact of his realisation that 

COLLAPSE IV
282

283
worse: ‘the blackness of space illimitable; unimagined space 
alive with motion and music, and having no semblance of 
anything on earth.’10 The narrative had earlier made clear 
how even the horror of the elder beings is finite; the Great 
Race knows that these creatures ‘were slowly weakening 
with the aeons. Indeed, it was known that they would be 
quite dead in the time of the post-human beetle race which 
the fleeing minds would tenant’.11 No consciousness, alien 
or human, subtends the seething vortex of time.
	Sound is then only the signal for the definitive rupture 
of the musica universalis – and the revelation of the real 
qua chaos – compact but full of holes. But this effect is 
withdrawn. The final ‘shattering’ revelation of Lovecraft’s 
narrative is the – by now for the reader, entirely predictable 
– recovery by the narrator of a text from the depths of the 
alien city written in his own hand. This forms the definitive 
proof that ‘there lies upon this world of man a shocking and 
incredible shadow out of time’. In this revelation we witness 
the retraction of the horror back towards the constraints of 
the object. Lovecraft himself remained dissatisfied with the 
story and refused to type it up. If every critical reading is 
a kind of rewriting, and often, as in this case, something of 
the expression of the text we desired rather than the text we 
have, then what I desire is that ‘terrible thing’: a fiction of 
the ‘seething vortex of time’.
I, Nathaniel Peaslee, have found that last proof of my otherness 
written in my own hand. But then this textual proof serves 
to keep me guarded as one of the chosen of the Great Race. 
I is another, another subject. We might all be doomed but I, 
10. Ibid, 343-4.

of At the Mountains of Madness (1931).6 The layering of these 
two objects of horror can be found in Peaslee’s exploration 
of the ancient city of the Great Race in the Australian 
desert, as he searches for definitive proof of his abduction. 
The city itself forms an abyss, parallel to the horror of 
the vortex, with its ‘vast chain of aeon-dead black gulfs’. 
Within the abyssal city, however, there is a further abyss. 
This is one of the prisons of the ‘elder things’: a ‘downward 
aperture’ open and ‘yawning unguarded down to abysses 
past imagination’. Returning back past the open trap door 
Peaslee stumbles and hears the resultant noise answered by 
‘a shrill, whistling sound, like nothing else on earth, and 
beyond any adequate verbal description’ – the sound of 
the elder beings. These ‘tides of abomination surging up 
through the cleft itself’7 fill-out the abyss or vortex with a 
material presence. Unlike At the Mountains of Madness we are 
not greeted with the appearance of these creatures; instead 
they remain signalled only by sound.
	Therefore this filling-out of the abyss is withdrawn and 
we are faced with a further layer of the shadow. The alien 
whistling of the creatures calls up another fear, the fear 
of being ‘engulfed in a pandemoniac vortex of loathsome 
sound and utter, materially tangible blackness’.8 The 
‘materiality’ here is the subtractive or purified materiality 
of the vortex of seething time – the seething blackness of 
chaos. Recall ‘The Music of Erich Zann’ (1921),9 in which 
the mad music of Zann is played to ward off something

Nathaniel Peaslee, have had the honour of being chosen as a 
great mind who will be recorded. 
Something, however, whispers in poor Nathaniel’s ear:
What about the shadow out of time? You presume that the 
shadow comes from outside. You suggest, implicitly, some 
stable and material outside that forms the flipside of existent 
reality. I come with the good bad news, the shadow out of 
time does not exist outside time, it is time. Time itself is the 
shadowy vortex of a ‘matter’ that forms nothing and has no 
need of you, anyone or anything else. Good night Nathaniel 
and good luck.

Being and Slime:
The Mathematics of Protoplasm
in Lorenz Oken’s ‘Physio-Philosophy’
It is a daring act of reason to set humanity free and to abstract the shock 
of the objective world; yet the venture cannot miscarry, since man becomes 
greater to the degree he knows himself and his strength.

A philosophy or ethics without a philosophy of nature is a non-thing, a

1. Introduction: The Non-Thing or, On the Forms 
Occurring in Contemporary Philosophy
The fate of post-Kantian philosophy depends on 
whether the ‘shock of the objective world’ can be overcome 
by self-knowledge, on the actuality of the ‘shock of the 
actual’.3 A seismic chain runs through transcendental­
ism’s subjugation of earthquakes to epistemology, a 
vulcanism poignantly articulated in the objections of 
the cosmologist Johann Heinrich Lambert to Kant’s 
relegation of time to an a priori form of inner intuition:
‘If changes are real, then time is real […] If time is unreal, then no 
change can be real’.4 This is the shock of physics shattering the

insularity of transcendental subjectivity, demonstrating the 
stakes of the modal investigation of epistemogenesis with 
which the transcendental philosophy attempted to replace 
ontology.123 4
Schelling’s account of transcendentalism as a ‘daring 
act of reason’ clearly articulates the substitution of ethics 
for ontology that lies at its core. The accuracy of this 
diagnosis is certainly revealed in transcendental philoso­
phy’s restriction of reality to the scope of possible intuition,

107 (italics in original). Lambert is responding to § 14 of On the Form and Principles of 
the Sensible and Intelligible World, where Kant argued that ‘although time, posited in 
itself and absolutely, would be an imaginary being […], it is a condition, extending to 
infinity, of intuitive representation for all possible objects of the senses’ (Ak.II: 401; 
1992a: 395). Kant echoes Lambert’s question and his response in the first Critique: 
‘Time is certainly something real, namely, the real form of inner intuition’ (A36-6/
B53-4).
but its terms are more overtly displayed in the unstable 
dualism of teleology and mechanism in the third Critique. 
The dualism is unstable, because despite appearances, it 
is not only a dispute about natural causality (although this 
is certainly part of it), but outlines the procedure whereby 
physical grounds are reduced to the inscrutable abjecta of 
reason’s ultimately moral actualisation. This procedure 
consists in (a) maintaining the phenomenal indifference of 
moral and natural purposes in keeping with the constraints 
placed by the first Critique on theoretical reason; while (b) 
extending the authority of practical over theoretical reason, 
in keeping with the second Critique; and thereby (c) rejecting 
ontology for an ethicised phenomenology. It should be 
noted, moreover, that the logical form of this procedure is 
self-reinforcing: (a) + (b)  = (c) = (a) + (b). We shall call it 
the ethical process.
The claim of this paper is that this ethical process is 
as untenable as it is ubiquitous. It is point (c) that makes 
it recognisably ubiquitous, although usually (not always) 
without the string of reasons (a) and (b) that establish it. 
It is untenable because reason must now affirm ethical 
grounding as the absence of grounds, or the absence of grounds 
as ethical grounding. The ethical process is the principal 
element of the philosophy of what Oken, above, calls the 
‘bare contradiction, the non-thing’.
In the equation of ‘bare contradiction’ and ‘non-thing’, 
it is clear that Oken considers logical forms to entail 
ontological consequences: that a bare contradiction is a 
non-thing. This is in complete contradiction to the verdict 
of Hegel’s Philosophy of Nature, where he dismisses Oken 
as practising a ‘mere formalism’ comprising nothing but 
‘assertions’ common to ‘the philosophy of nature of his 

Grant – Being and Slime / Todosch – Drawings
291
time’.5 In contrast, what the geological Naturphilosoph Henrik 
Steffens called Oken’s ‘hard, insurmountable realism’6 
consists, in part, in a realism with regard to grounds. The 
core philosophical problem to which Oken’s Naturphil­
osophie is addressed is consequently to determine ‘how 
something derived its existence from nothing’.7 As will 
become apparent, the ‘nothing’ from which ‘somethings’ 
always derive their existence is the mathematical nothing, 
the zero. Thus, Oken’s ‘generative history of the world’8 
consists entirely in demonstrating the repeated ontological 
consequences of what he calls, emphasising this generative 
operation, the mathes-is issuing from Zero. Thus, the formal 
reason of an existent is = the real ground of existence = 0. 
The question is whether the zero is always the same, i.e. 
whether 0 is always = 0, or whether, for instance, in the 
domain of biology, the 0 is slimy.
The story is often told that the immediate post-Kan­
tian reaction consists in the ‘organicist turn’, with Goethe, 
Schelling and the Naturphilosophen cited as evidence. While 
it is certainly true that the post-Kantian philosophers and 
naturalists attempted to resolve Kant’s dualism by way 
of organic or self-organizing causality, this story remains 
5.  Hegel, Philosophy of Nature, trans A.V. Miller (Oxford: Oxford University Press,

seem to ratify Hegel’s assessment: ‘Philosophy, as the science which embraces the 
principles of the universe or world, is only a logical, which may perhaps conduct 
us to the real, conception.’ Hegel ignores countervailing propositions: ‘what holds 
good of mathematical principles must also hold good of the principles of nature’ 
(Elements 67).

philosophically inadequate. In brief, the reasons for the 
insufficiency of this story are (i) that it segregates philosophy 
from nature, making the former merely the corollary of the 
latter; and (ii) that by making the naturalisation of teleology 
versus cognitively insuperable intentionality (the problem 
of ‘access’) into the only significant problem to which the 
Idealists contribute, it (iii) leaves the problem of the forms 
of realism pursued in the long aftermath of Kantianism, 
entirely unaddressed. This essay will therefore take Oken’s 
Mathesis as a particular case study in the pursuit of a post-
Kantian realism reducible neither to dogmatism nor to the 
ethical process, a pursuit that remains as insistent today as 
it did two hundred years ago.
2. Physio-Philosophy as the System of the Generation 
of the World
The Elements of Physio-Philosophy (Lehrbuch der Naturphiloso­
phie) is a summative work that synthesises Oken’s previous 
researches. Since his Preface to the Lehrbuch provides a retro­
spective of this works, and since, like most of the Naturphi­
losophen, Oken remains as scorned as he is ignored, we will 
introduce the main points of Oken’s system through his 
own bibliographical commentary.
Oken’s first work, the Outline of Nature Philosophy, Theory 
of the Senses and the Animal Classification based Thereupon (1802), 
sets out from the thesis that ‘the animal classes are virtually 
nothing else than a representation of the sense-organs’, a 
position by which, he states, he ‘still abides’ in the Elements 
(xi). This is notable both in its attempt to infer a system 
from physiological particulars, a realism that will survive, 
just as it is inverted, in the Elements; and in the structural role 
it allots to the theory of recapitulation, further developed 
and exemplified in this gloss of the theory as propounded 
in On the Significance of the Cranial Bone (1807):
[…] the head is nothing other than a vertebral column […] [just 
as] the maxillae are nothing else but repetitions of arms and 
feet, the teeth being their nails […]9 
This ‘vertebral theory of the skull’, over the discovery 
of which Oken disputed with Goethe,10 not only ‘supposed 
a community between the human skull and that of the 
lower vertebrates’, but extended beyond the organic into 
the mineral, geological and cosmogenic domains, carrying 
the ‘law of serial repetition […] to ludicrous lengths’ in 
Oken, according to some.11 While such a law must lose in 
determinacy what it gains in extent, the principle behind 
it is simple: that no product of nature arises in isolation 
from all other products, each being dependent on others, 
‘tak[ing] its starting-point from below’, as Oken notes.12 
How far below, however, must research plunge in order to 
locate the basal, serially repeated element? Writing retro­
spectively in 1846, this is what the neurophysiologist Jacob 
Henlé called the ‘genetic method’, which had as its goal ‘to 
identify the simple type of a given structure and to trace 
its progressive elaboration’.13 Where the genetic researcher 
is in possession of the fully elaborated organ, the task is 
9. Elements, xii.
10. As notably discussed by Hegel in his Philosophy of Nature, §354 Zusatz: ‘Oken, 
to whom Goethe had communicated the treatise [On Morphology 1785], paraded its 
ideas as his own in a programme he wrote on the subject, and so gained the credit 
for them.’

simplified; insofar as the basal element of any living organi­
sation is to be encountered within the domain of the biotic, 
the task becomes simpler still: to find the basal type of all 
life. 
However, if in principle there are no independent 
products in nature, then the prospect of an end to the genetic 
typing of any natural product is not to be found in the part, 
but rather in the whole. Oken’s next work will accordingly 
transform the search for nature’s basal elements into the 
search for ‘the nature of nature’,14 or metaphysics. 
Combining the results of the Outline and Significance, 
Oken’s On the Universe as a Continuation of the Sensory System 
(1808) argued ‘that the Organism is nothing other than a 
combination of all the Universe’s activities within a single 
individual body’ and that ‘World and Organism are one 
in kind, and do not stand merely in harmony with each 
other’.15 The last clause here indicates an important thesis 
regarding the theory of recapitulation, which does not 
assert that there merely exists a contingent ‘harmony’ or 
phenomenal similarity between parallel series (e.g. world-
generation and speciation) that remain of fundamentally 
different natural orders, but rather that all of nature is 
involved in the generation of any part of it. Moreover, as 
evinced by the work’s title, Oken is no longer concerned, 
as he was the Outline, to derive merely formal devices from 
physiological givens, but rather to assert that this structure 
is really instantiated in the universe as such. Accordingly, 
Oken extended his systematising attention to the elements 
of physics in First Ideas towards a Theory of Light, Darkness, 
Colour and Heat (1808), where each of these phenomena

are derived from tensions, antagonisms and motions in the 
aether, constituting a ‘primitive field theory’,16 and in the 
Natural System of Ores (1809), where mineral particulars are 
considered for the first time.
While the resultant dynamics fulfilled the post-Kan­
tian brief for physics established especially by Franz von 
Baader’s Ideas On Rigidity and Fluidity (1792), Apolph Karl 
August von Eschenmayer’s Propositions from the Metaphysics of 
Nature applied to Chemical and Medical Objects and Attempt to 
Derive the Laws of Magnetism A Priori from the Propositions of the 
Metaphysics of Nature (both 1797), Oken had also to integrate 
the phenomena of life into this universal physics. While it 
is only in the Elements that this is achieved, Oken’s contribu­
tion towards it – the theory of ‘primal slime’ or protoplasm 
– was first advanced in On Generation (1805), which argued
[…] that all organic beings originate from […] the infusorial 
mass, or the protoplasm [Urschleim] from whence all larger 
organisms fashion themselves or are evolved. Their production 
is therefore nothing else than a regular agglomeration of […] 
mucus vesicles or points [Schleimpunkte], which first form 
themselves by their union or combination into particular 
species.17
Since naturephilosophy is to be ‘the generative 
history of the world’,18 rather than that of biological 
individuals alone, the Elements undertakes to synthesise 
the sensory, cosmogonic, geological, embryological and

297
philosophical systems into a single, self-recapitulating series. 
The question arises as to how primary the ‘primal slime’ is. 
Written prior to the cosmogonic synthesis of Of the Universe, 
Oken’s programme in On Generation has not yet undertaken 
the transition to from the physics to the metaphysics of 
nature. Thus, as briefly digested as the Elements is vast 
(numbering 3652 propositions), Oken describes its project 
as finally
[...] bring[ing] these different doctrines into mutual connexion, 
and to show, forsooth, that the Mineral, Vegetable and Animal 
classes are not to be arbitrarily arranged in accordance with 
single or isolated characters, but to be based upon the cardinal 
organs or anatomical systems, from which a firmly established 
number of classes must of necessity result; moreover, that each 
of these classes commences or takes its starting-point from 
below, and consequently that all of them pass parallel to each 
other.19
Yet even here Oken holds out a physicalist solution to 
the genetic problem, noting that a parallelism between the 
classes make it possible ‘to prove that they by no means 
form a single ascending series’.20 Although the primacy of 
primal slime may thus yet be safeguarded, how the Elements’ 
project is to be achieved is set out in the opening sections 
of the work, which introduce the naturephilosophical terms 
of reference. Amongst the most important of these is the 
actual and logical priority of natural ground:
Naturephilosophy is the first, philosophy of mind, the second: 
the former, therefore, is the ground and foundation of the latter, 
19. Elements, xiii.
20. Ibid.

COLLAPSE IV
298
Grant – Being and Slime / Todosch – Drawings
299
for nature is antecedent to the human mind. […] Without 
naturephilosophy, therefore, there is no philosophy of mind, 
any more than a flower is present without a stem, or an edifice 
without a foundation.21
Moreover, since naturephilosophy ‘has to show how, 
and in accordance indeed with what laws, the material took 
its origin’, it follows that history forms a single temporal 
series from the development of matter to particular natures 
to mind. The formal reason = real ground of existence 
consists in the various solutions to the problem of ‘how 
something derived its existence from nothing’.22
The other element, then, is Zero, the nothing, and it 
is introduced in the Elements for the first time as paralleling 
the Urschleim in biology. In what sense, however, ‘parallel’? 
Are the biological and the mathematical parallel and thus 
independent, or does everything depend on ‘what is below 
it’? The problem of the relative and mobile primacies 
attaching to the various basal types running throughout 
Oken’s system is that Zero is the equilibrium point in 
Oken’s polar philosophy of nature, and is so dominant 
that it led Steffens to describe Oken’s ‘insurmountable 
realism’ as complemented only by an ‘ideal element’ that 
is ‘entirely negative’, a view Knittermeyer endorses.23 The 
basal Zero – ‘Oken’s most pervasive principle’ – states that 
‘all development proceeds along the same path by adding 
elements to an original nothingness’, a law that ‘holds 
for human ontogeny, the historical sequence of species, 
21. Elements  15-16, t.m.
22. Ibid., 10.
23. Schelling und die romantische Schule (op.cit.), 192.
the evolution of the earth itself’.24 This account certainly 
follows from the irreversible priority Oken attaches to 
Nature over Mind; but the problem remains: either the Zero 
is the merely formal element Hegel accused Oken’s naturephi­
losophy as consisting in, in which case ‘The universe’ is 
not ‘the reality of mathematics’;25 or ‘existence derives from 
nothing’ and Slime is not primal. The Okenian solution to 
the genetic problem therefore consists in a struggle between 
Nothing and Slime.
3. Zero or Slime? The Elements of the Elements 
and the Groundedness of the Ground
The Elements outlines its system in sections 18-21 of its 
‘Introduction’. The ‘generative history of the world’ divides 
into three parts:
1. Mathesis (of the whole),
from which stem (a) Hylogeny and (b) Theogony, or the 
generative philosophy of matter and mind;
2. Ontology (of the singular),
which follows the generation of nature from Mathesis, and from 
which stem (a) Cosmogony and (b) Stoichogeny; and
3. Biology (of the whole in the singular),
which recapitulates the generation of Hylogeny, Theogony and 
Ontology in embryogenesis.
Mathesis – the actions of mathematics, ‘the only true,

301
the primary, the universal science’26 – subdivides in turn 
into the theories of material totalities or Hylogeny, a ‘rather 
primitive field-theory’27 comprising aether, light and heat; 
and of immaterial totalities or Pneumatogeny, a Theogony 
comprising God and Nothing. Ontology divides into 
Cosmogony, or the emergence of the cosmic bodies, and 
Stoichogeny, or how the heavenly bodies ‘divide themselves 
further […] into the elements’. Biology, concerned with 
‘the whole in singulars [which] is the living or Organic […] 
divides into Organogeny, Phytosophy and Zoosophy’.28 
Two things concerning Oken’s conception of Biology 
are immediately apparent. The first is that it is no longer 
predicated, as was Oken’s procedure in the Outline (1802), 
on a particular kind of being whose contours are given in 
nature, but rather on a particular stage in the development 
of structural complexity involving God, Nothing and Matter, 
or mathematics, singulars and substance; that is, the whole 
of nature. Since the whole is the self-division of God, 
Nothing and Matter, and the singular is the elemental, 
hylogenetic singular attained and actualised through these 
divisions; and since further it is articulated primarily 
by mathematics, then the true object of Biology is the 
mathematics of these self-divisions as actualised in living 
somethings. This is the fork in Biological science that leads 
to the theory of the Primal Slime (Urschleim) and its mani­
festation in Slime Points (Schleimpunkte). The theory of slime 
which forms the oozing ground of Oken’s ‘physio-philos­
ophy’ is ultimately therefore a ‘mathematics endowed with 
26. Ibid., 24-5
27. Mullen (1977) Loc.cit.
28. Elements, 21.
substance’,29 or the product of the mathetic-ontogenetic 
process; the biogenetic process then ‘takes its starting point’ 
from the ‘infusorial mass’ or ‘primal slime’ below, which it 
divides into the innumerable ‘mucus vesicles [Schleimpunkte]’ 
that are the ‘primal constituent parts of [this] organic mass’. 
The production of complex singulars (individuals) consists 
therefore in the ‘agglomeration of infusoria’ up to the 
level of species.30 Biology is therefore the science of the 
production of individuals that has as its basis the science of 
the production of wholes.
Secondly, if the system that supports this account of 
the organic is a true system, that is, if the philosophy of 
nature is not merely a reflection upon nature, but rather 
‘the generative history of the world’,31 a world that articulates 
‘mathematical propositions’ as much as it generates ‘natural 
things’,32 then it follows that Biology is no isolated science 
of abstracted particulars, but rather concerns the develop­
mental singularities by which the mathematicising cosmos 
is actualised. Hence Oken’s insistence that
Natural History is not a closed department of human 
knowledge, but presupposes numerous other sciences, such 
as Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry and Physics, with even 
Medicine, Geography and History.33
Biology becomes the science it must when and only 
when the totality of the sciences – of wholes, singulars,

303
and singulars-in-wholes – recovers the entirety of science 
as such. This means that Biology recapitulates Mathesis, 
just as Oken’s categories suggest: of the Whole, and of 
the Whole in the Singular. The one science of the whole is 
mathematics, the language of ontogenesis. From this second 
perspective, Oken derives what many, including Hegel, 
deride as the ‘empty formalism’ of his system, a formalism 
articulated around an irreducibly ontogenetic element: the 
‘oscillating Zero’, or God: ‘God is = + 0 –’.34 The problem 
of the relation between the multiplicity of sciences and the 
‘universal science’ arises starkly: either there is one universal 
science to which all others are reducible, or Mathesis, the 
theory of the whole, has no claim to universality, and does 
not therefore articulate ontogeny. In short: what is the relation 
between the Primal Slime and the Zero? Oken’s proposed solution 
is: mathematics is the universal science that generates, inter­
connects, and necessitates all the others. The ‘wavering 
Zero’ is the generative core of being and slime.
The problem of priority is a problem for a metaphysi­
cally realist natural history precisely because the theory of 
recapitulation, considered causally, abolishes linear time. 
Whenever there arise claims to priority (the primal Zero 
34.Elements, 99. Knittermeyer puts Oken’s case economically and concisely: ‘God 
is the father, the generator, but himself ungenerated, transformed into the plus 
and the minus and yet always remains himself as the existent nothing [das wesende 
Nichts]. God is the son who goes forth from the father into finitude, and he is the 
mind that takes finitude back, in turn, to the origin and reproduces the “mental 
bond” with the generating origin. As the first, this divine acting is the ‘primary rest 
[Urruhe]’, the “wavering and resting point in the universe”, the “never appearing 
and yet ubiquitously present”. As the second he is eternal ponentiation and hence, 
corresponding to the number series 1 + 2 + … + n, the creator of the temporal series. 
As the third, however, God is he who takes back the finite [being] released into the 
restless time effecting motion and life, into the whole and binds it into him in all-filling 
space. The formless oscillation of life here receives form and integument. The divine 
brings itself closer to appearing and therefore materiality.’ (Hinrich Knittermeyer, 
Schelling und die romantische Schule. München: Ernst Reinhardt, 1928, 189).
or the Primal Slime), Oken appears to equivocate. Having 
noted therefore the priority of the philosophy of nature 
over that of mind in section 15; along with the ontogenetic 
dependency of the latter on the former (‘nature is antecedent 
to mind’) in section 16; section 17 concludes not with this 
serial genetic dependency, but with a ‘parallelism’ between 
the two. One section later, however, the parallelism is 
extended to the relative priorities of the one over the other. 
Thus: 
It will be shown in the sequel that the mental is antecedent to 
nature. Naturephilosophy must, therefore, commence from the 
mind.35
Which, then, does come first – Zero or Slime? Around 
what axis is the topology of nature and mind spinning? 
Does mathematics remain the ‘primary science’, or is a 
mathematical realism usurped by a realism concerning 
natural history? The relation of system and history remains 
at the core of the metaphysics of natural history; especially 
as this project was renewed in Prigogine and Stengers new 
‘physiophilosophical’ alliance.36 What is seldom noted is 
that this entails a natural history of metaphysics that extends 
beyond the steady accumulation of form that character­
ises Hegelian history of philosophy. The natural history 
of metaphysics is a physics of metaphysics, a science of the 
grounds of metaphysics in nature, or a physics of ideation 
as such. Although sounding more redolent of hard-nosed 
contemporary eliminativists than of post-Kantian idealists, 
this recognition was core to Naturphilosophen such as

Schelling, who characterised philosophy as ‘the natural 
history of mind’37 and Troxler, who defines metaphysics as 
the physics (Naturlehre) of human knowledge.38 If nature is 
necessary to generate mind, as sections 15 and 16 note, 
then mind is necessary to the abstract recapitulation of 
natural production in reflection, or to the recapitulation of 
the mathetic whole in the biological singular. Yet Oken’s 
system extends beyond reflection on natural production, 
since ontogenesis depends on Mathesis. The Platonic 
kinship is unmistakable:39 mathematics, or the Idea, are not 
simply nominal or formal processes, but rather ontogenetic. 
Just as the Phaedo argues40 that it is because of the form of 
Beauty that beautiful things exist, so Oken argues that it is 
because of Mathesis that things exist, or because of Nothing 
(= 0) that there are beings. That Oken inverts the causal 
or physical dependency of mind on nature does indeed 
stem from his characterisation of Mathesis as hylogeny and 
theogony , which gives direction to the system, towards the 
production of animals capable of Mathesis and therefore, 
famously, of man:
Man is the summit, the crown of nature’s development, and 
must comprehend everything that has preceded him [while] 
man is a complex of all that surrounds him, namely, of element, 
mineral, plant and animal.41

At the very point where thinking slime affords nature 
linearity, however, at the crown of its development from 
elements to animals, directionality reverses. Mathesis 
as theogony is concerned with the immaterial whole; 
yet what is the ‘immaterial’? Merely ‘that which is nothing 
in relation to the material’,42 just as ‘God is = + 0 –’43 or ‘the 
eternal is the nothing of nature’.44 The ‘immaterial’ is the 
zero of material, its generative ground, just as God is that of 
nature, since nothing iterated is the becoming of something. 
Thus the sense in which ‘something derives its existence 
from nothing’45 now becomes ‘very clear’. Just as
numbers have not issued forth from zero as if they had 
previously resided therein, but the zero has emerged out of 
itself […], and then it was a finite zero, a number46
so something emerges not ‘out of’ but rather from the acts 
of the nothing’s self-extensions: ‘Zero is […] the primary act 
[and] numbers are [its] repetitions’.47 Thus another primary 
whose ‘positing and negating are called realisation [which] 
is a process of extension taking place in the Idea’.48 And 
this positing and negating takes place, equally, in the ‘highest, 
most exalted art […] of war’,49 reducing everything to

nothing after the Napoleonic model. The nothing initiates 
a ceaseless imitatio nihil amidst the extended multiplicities 
formed of the infinite repetition of the primary act, while 
existence resists the sink at its core.
At first sight far from satisfactory, all this wavering 
Nothing leaves an ontological queasiness in place of 
any principle of sufficient reason. It pervades Oken’s 
system, with its martial apex. For what kind of 
biologist does war supercede life as the system’s goal? 
That the complexifications of Primal Slime here cede to the 
destruction of war demonstrates that the cosmos worships 
the Nothing-God. The culmination of Biology is the 
destruction of individuals, which is held in check so long as 
there remains something. Kant tells us, reassuringly enough, 
that reality can never sink to zero; but Oken’s mehylotheogony 
supplants all Being with increase and decrease, each limitless. 
The fragile hold of beings is secured by Slime alone – all 
that ontology can hope for is Slime potentiated and negated 
into and out of all things. The question thus arises is this: 
is the Urschleim – or, ontically speaking, the Schleimpunkte – 
negable, reducible, as well as ‘potentiable’? The prospect 
of the contingency of all beings issues directly from this as it 
were gravitational distortion of the local spacetime of their 
generation.
The question would hold no terror were the passage 
from mathetic metheology to ontology secured, e.g. by a 
causal or a linear-progressive process; but it is not. The 
whole is not left behind by history, by the accumulation 
of causes from whence emerges time; rather, it returns in 
Biology. Oken’s Biology is not therefore testimony to the 
final discovery of a ‘Newton of the blade of grass’, of an 
organicism to save us from the ravages of nature, but

only the repetition of the None-All in every generated 
particular. 
All directionality, whether in ideation or cosmogeny, 
in embryogenesis, hylogeny, temporalisation or primary 
Mathesis, is withdrawn in favour of the polar model that 
determines the ‘primitive field theory’ Oken constructs 
around the tensions, antitheses and motions of the aether 
in the First Ideas for a Theory of Light, and which inherits and 
extends the galvanic process Ritter discovered to ‘constantly 
accompany the animal kingdom’ into the mineral, chemical 
and mathetic domains along the lines suggested by the 
magnetic schema, in which the zero is not primitive, but 
first and last in, and the principle of, all the extensions of 
its force.50 Oken’s mutiplicity of primaries – act, slime, rest, 
etc. – are primary relative both to the lower nothing from 
which, at ontogenetic root, they issue, and to the ‘higher 
zeros’ that counteract them which they in turn give rise: 
rest, war, act.
The polar metaphysics of nature, therefore, collapses 
the axis of higher and lower, antecendence and succession, 
into a field theory of polar dependency: ‘The world is God 
rotating’ or ‘a rotating globe of matter’.51 Natural history is 
always therefore relative to the mathetic zero from which its 
50. The schema owes its most definitive account to Karl August Eschenmayer’s 
Attempt to Deduce the Laws of Magnetic Phenomena a priori from the Propositions of Metaphysics 
(1797), and to Schelling’s reworking of it in his Exposition of my System of Philosophy 
(1801). For Eschenmayer, see Jörg Jantzen, ‘Adolph Karl August von Eschenmayer’,

objects issue, and the frame of reference is always generated 
after the field that is its object. The ultimate significance 
of sections 15, 16 and 18 of the Elements is therefore that 
the priority of nature with respect to mind generates a 
nothing in nature from which naturephilosophy begins. 
Ironically, Oken’s post-Kantian solutions make Lambert’s 
physico-critical intervention redundant by realising the full 
consequences of self-effecting processes: the elimination of history 
in nature: ‘Time is the infinite succession of numbers or the 
mathematical nothings’.52 We turn now to Oken’s solutions 
to his polar take on the genetic problem.
4. Okenian Solutions, and … 
Oken’s solution to the genetic problem is not what 
Henlé’s ‘student of the nervous system’ might have hoped 
for. Rather than identifying the ‘basal element’ of neuroge­
netic recapitulation, Oken resolves individuation into the 
whole. Schematically:
Mathesis
(1)	
→ Ontogenesis → Biogenesis → the production 
of the whole in the singular → Mathesis potentiated.
The consequence of this is that the causal series 
(2)	
that ties time to change is sacrificed for a codepen­
dency relation, a reciprocity, between the elements 
recapitulating the basic scheme of the whole in a 
singular. ‘The law of causality is a law of polarity’, 
not of time.53 Time, Oken continues, is accordingly 
‘only repetition, and thus also a suppression of 
52. Elements 72.

[…] positions’.54 Because the whole is expressed at 
the apexes of individuation (Ideation and War), 
Okenian ontogenesis produces irreducibly local 
maps,  while ‘pneumatogenesis’ has primally and 
then derivatively multiplied them. Potentiation is 
potentiation of the whole in its individuation, as 
Schelling would later note of the involutive-evol­
utive process.55
If, logically, mathematics is the expression of the 
(3)	
whole in the individual; and if, theogonically, 
‘God = + 0 – is before and after all things’, then 
modally, only the nothing is necessary. Here, 
then, we derive the central lesson of Oken’s 
system of nature: the contingency of all beings, 
so the ‘principle of sufficient reason’ is satisfied 
by nothing potentiated. Precisely in consequence 
of this, mathematics or mehylogeny does not so 
much supplant nature as generate it: by taking on 
the project of the ‘natural history of metaphysics’, 
Oken’s slimy Platonic naturephilosophy has 
mathetic functions accreting numbers and organs, 
indifferently: ‘all development’, as Gould notes 
of Oken’s system, ‘begins with a primal zero and 
progresses to complexity by the successive addition 
of organs in a determined sequence’.56 The zero 
accretes by self-extension in the forms of mineral, 
chemical, plant and animal organs.57
54. Ibid., 74.

Idealism and the Endgame of Theory: Three Essays by Schelling (Albany NY: SUNY, 1994).

57. Elements, 867.
If, as we have seen, recapitulation becomes, by 
(4)	
virtue of (2), above, if not aionic (although Oken 
occasionally makes precisely this point: ‘Zero 
must be endlessly self-positing, for in every 
respect it is indefinite or unlimited, eternal’),58 then 
certainly achronic. It forms the logic of Idea in the 
hylogenetic → biogenetic process, and as such is 
the repeated intercession of the eternal into time, 
or its negation.
Even anthropogenesis, so often criticised as 
(5)	
the ‘anti-copernican’ core of the post-Kantian 
‘restoration’, accordingly suffers. No sooner is man 
declared the ‘highest’, insofar as it is through man 
that nature achieves Ideation and thus reproduces 
Mathesis, than war erupts because ‘the Nothing is 
higher than the highest’: ‘the Zero, the highest’.59 
Oken therefore demonstrates that anthropogenesis 
culminates neither in the humanism of finitude nor 
in the ontolotheological eschatology, but rather 
ceaselessly repeats the mathetic mehylotheogony of the 
cosmogonic process:
In the process of destruction, the finite being seeks 
to become the universe itself [because] man is a 
complex of all that surrounds him.60

5. … Post-Okenian Problems.
The continuance of Being is a continuous positing of the 
Eternal, or of nothing, a ceaseless process of becoming real in 
that which is not. There exists nothing but nothing, nothing 
but the Eternal, and all individual existence is only a fallacious 
existence. All individual things are monads, nothings, which 
have, however, become determined.61
We have noted that the Okenian number series are 
primary, and issue from a primary Zero, ‘the one essence 
of all things, the 0, the highest identity’.62 Disregarding for 
the moment the metaphysics of polar time, the Zero is, if 
not primitive, then ultimate, insofar as everything resolves 
into it. Oken invests considerable effort in the elaboration 
of zero. 
Firstly, it is twofold: intensive or ideal, and extensive 
or real. Yet these two remain indifferent: ‘the real and the 
ideal are no more different than ice and water; both […] are 
essentially one and the same’.63 This is where the repeatedly 
claimed similarity of Oken’s Zero and Schelling’s refor­
mulated law of Identity are apparent:64 that identity is the 
61. Ibid., 58.
62. Ibid., 40.
63. Ibid., 36.
64. This tendency starts with Oken’s translator, Tulk: ‘the present work stands alone 
in Germany, as being the most practical application upon a systematic scale of the 
principles advanced by Schelling, more especially in the Mathesis and Ontology’ 
(Elements vi). More recently, Joseph L. Esposito, in Schelling’s Idealism and the Philosophy 
of Nature (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1977, 143) repeats the point: 
‘Essentially Oken’s system is the same as Schelling’s, but with specific scientific 
disciplines superimposed on it, so that it became at once a picture of the World 
System and a proposal for how to study it. […] Mathesis is the condition of Schelling’s 
Absolute Identity, wherein the first differentiation occurs’. See also Wolfgang Förster, 
‘Schelling als Theoretiker der Dialektik der Natur’, in Hans Jörg Sandkühler, ed.,

315
ground of differentiation, and that no differentia, insofar as 
they are different, are identical. 
Secondly, the susceptibility of Zero to ‘infinitely 
numerous forms’65 invites speculation as to the other forms 
it has in fact assumed: apart from Eschenmayer’s magnetic 
schema, therefore, Kant’s account of the eliminative 
actions of negative magnitudes, or the ontological problem 
of negative numbers, pinion around zeros, as does the 
‘minimax’ of zero sum games, or the empty set from which 
Russell and Whitehead, on the one hand, and Badiou 
on the other, draw such diverse ontological conclusions. 
Finally, and perhaps decisively, the ungenerated and 
ungenerable, non-phenomenal attributes of the Platonic 
Idea make it into the zero of the physical world, a series 
of problems best explored in the Parmenides. The actual 
and potential permutability of zero into many formal 
schemas brings Oken’s theorizing out of the domain of 
the ‘number mysticism’ of which he has been routinely 
accused66 to demonstrate the ontological vitality of the 
problem of the relation of number, being and animal.67 The 
question Badiou raises against Deleuze of the separability 
of mathematics and ontology, on the one hand, from nature 
on the other, is, as is topologically appropriate, twisted in 
Oken. On the one hand, Mathesis, ontology and biology form

distinct domains that are all, on the other, articulated by their 
respective and interrelated zeros. In other words, each 
series takes its starting point from its predecessor, so that 
Mathesis entails ontology entails biology. The problem of 
the independent dependence of series one on the other is in 
effect the problem solved by the generation of nature itself, 
insofar as it recapitulates these series in all its products. On 
Oken’s evidence, then, number is inseparable from animal 
precisely because animals are the numbers of nature:68 ‘life’, he 
writes, ‘is a mathematical problem’.69 Mathesis, ontology 
and biology are equally inseparable, therefore, because the 
series are not statically taxonomic, but actually genetic. It is 
the genetic element in Oken that indicates a resolution to the contem­
porary problem.
Thirdly, the Ideal and Real forms correspond to the 
Zero in a state of intensity and extensity in number series. 
‘The latter’, writes Oken, ‘is only expanded intensity, the 
former, extensity concentrated in the point’.70 It is this 
latter differentiation that provides Oken with the means to 
formulate the issuing forth of something out of the nothing 
by way of the latter’s repetition rather than its expulsion of 
a latent content.
The Zero thus provides a genuine solution to the 
problem of sufficient reason: nothing is the reason why there 
are beings, or is the ungrounding of primary ground from 
which grounds emerge. This thesis is rich in implications: 
firstly, since the determination of nothing occurs only in 
68. I owe this point to lengthy and unforgettable conversations with my colleague 
Sean Watson.

317
the process of extension and concentration, and since it is 
susceptible to ‘infinitely numerous forms’, it grounds the 
contingency of all beings, although it ought not to be omitted 
that it grounds this contingency of singulars. Secondly, if all 
things have one essence (= 0; Elements 40), then in what 
sense are all things really diverse? If merely formally (as Oken 
in fact argues), then ontology – the actual generation of 
singulars – cannot fulfill its function, and the All remains = 
0; if essentially, then the Zero ceases to be the primitive = the 
highest in all things, and the All is not = 0. The problem this 
poses can thus be summatively stated: is the Zero capable 
of real generation? Since Oken answers that ‘naturephilos­
ophy is the generative history’ or ‘the science of the genesis 
of the world’,71 the formal and essential ‘generations’ of zero 
must be essentially indifferent while formally different. If, 
however, all difference is formal difference, and the Zero is 
always the generating (potentiable and negable) element, 
then it must either be concluded that formal difference is 
essentially indifferent or that formal differentiation is the 
generation of an additional mode not given in the alternatives. 
This, indeed, is Oken’s solution: ‘positing and negating the 
Eternal is called realisation’.72
What does the contingency of all beings therefore 
entail? That the formal differentiation and essential indif­
ference of the generations of zeros never attain to fixity, 
whether of species, phyla or morphology. Indeed, this is 
guaranteed by the endlessly rotating axes of theogonic 
and hylogenic nature,73 just as it is by Oken’s ‘singular to 
71. Ibid., 11, 66.
72. Ibid., 40.
73. cf. Elements 142, 161.
whole’ transformation of the genetic problem. Accordingly, 
Oken’s is a universal morphogenesis, which earned his 
work credit from D’Arcy Thompson74 and E.S. Russell,75 
amongst others. Okenian ontology does not therefore so 
much chart whole entities, but rather singulars, both in the 
sense of cosmogony, or the generation of the one universe – 
‘there can be only one nature’;76 and of stoichogeny, or the 
generation of the elements and organs that accrete to the 
various formally differentiated singulars. Ceaselessly oscillating 
around the zeros from which they issue and the complexes 
they recapitulate, depending on the extensity of the zeros’ 
generations, the emergent material forms are not so much 
limited geometries as they are limited acts. 
Taking these points together, it becomes evident that 
what the contingency conferred upon beings by Oken’s 
principle of sufficient reason consists in is the consequence 
of the contingency of dynamics. On this account, biology is 
the science of the contingent dynamics of the primal slime, 
oscillating between the achievement of Ideation and mineral 
inertia. Indeed, the polar field thus generated by biology 
involves rocks as much as Ideas, as much as the biological 
singular involves the osseous and the nervous systems; 
all biological systems, however, are evolved from the slimy, 
74. D’Arcy Thompson cites Oken twice by name in On Growth and Form [1917]. Ed & 
abridged by J.T. Bonner. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966), and gives 
the following, Okenian account of morphology: ‘Morphology is not only a study 
of material things and of the forms of material things, but has its dynamical aspect, 
under which we deal with the interpretation, in terms of force, of the operations of 
Energy’, 14.
75. E.S.Russell, in Form and Function: a Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology 
(London: John Murray, 1916), 90, thus describes Oken as’a careful student of 
embryology’. The most recent exponent of the positive view of Okenian morphology 
is Stephen J. Gould, op. cit.

protoplasmic mass whose contingencies are involved in them. 
To return to the problem of the separability of mathematics 
and nature, we must now pose it the other way round: is a 
slime-free matheme possible? Morphology, with its principle of 
sufficient reason, argues not.
6. Conclusion: The Rotations 
of 
the Before 
and the After
With Schelling, we argued at the beginning of this 
essay that the ethical process is possible only if the ‘shock of 
the objective world’ can be abstracted away. One means 
of achieving this is by insisting on the separability of 
mathematics and nature, and by insisting on the ‘impossi­
bility’ of a philosophy of nature, as does Badiou.77 Another 
means of achieving this is by insisting on the insuperability 
of the nominal frameworks of self-conscious, finite reason. 
Since the latter is a subdivision of the former, however, 
there is no difference in kind, but only in degree, between 
these two means of abstracting the world. 
Oken’s insistence, by contrast, on the material world of 
nature as forming the generative basis not only of natural 
individuation, but also of the thought-series that can only 
arise on their basis in turn, suggests that one more entailment 
might flow from his principle of sufficient reason: the order 
of priority of nature and mind. With this order, the shock 
of conjoint time and change by which Lambert forced the 
progressive splintering of the system of transcendental 
philosophy, is reintroduced: if there is an order of priority, 
how can it be grounded given the ceaseless rotation of Matter 
and God? To resolve this merely formally, by arguing that 
77. Badiou, loc.cit., 64.
Matter is the zero of God, just as God is the zero of Matter, 
is not to resolve the problem at all, but to avoid it, since 
Mathesis consists precisely in the formal differentiation of 
Matter and God – of hylogeny and theogony – from which 
ontogenesis flows. Further, we have already noted Oken’s 
inversion of his initially stated order of priority: ‘nature 
first, mind second’78 becomes ‘mind first, nature second’.79 
Since we must concede that Oken’s dynamics admit of no 
transcendent or transcendental axes, therefore, the grounds 
of the before and the after must be established by other 
means.
Ultimately, as Oken repeatedly argues, the task of 
naturephilosophy is ‘to show how […] the Material took its 
origin; and therefore, how something derived its existence 
from nothing’.80 By now we recognise this as Oken’s 
trademark, polar procedure: matter and nothing are 
conjointly the first focus of the systematic task of generating 
nature in thought. Thought, in other words, involves matter 
and nothing, i.e., the whole (Mathesis). Indeed, philosophy 
and war are the latest of the zero’s accretions, the former 
consisting always in ‘the repetition of the origin of the 
world’,81 while the latter, through the ‘process of destruction’, 
seeks to reestablish the essential identity of everything82 in 
the zero that must necessarily remain. Each involves the 
entire universe and its generation; the first as universal 
repetition, the second as universal equation. War reveals 
the ground, and philosophy repeats its generations, up to

321
and including its own generation in nature. Because ground 
supersedes its repetition, which precedes its revelation, 
an order of priority can be established in thought. Hence 
Oken: ‘Time is the act of numbering; numbering is 
thinking; thinking is time’.83 
This is not to argue that time exists only in thought, in the 
Kantian manner, but rather that, as Oken notes, thinking is 
time. This is because 
Time itself is only repetition […] The vicissitude of things is in 
fact time; if there be no change, there is also no time.84
In other words, because the grounding of existents 
consists in the repetition of zero, this grounding extends to 
Ideation, to philosophy. Philosophy is the formal repetition 
of cosmogony, while war is its essential repetition. Because 
Ideation is not itself the ground of time (Kant), but time 
that of Ideation, the grounding of existents in nothing 
establishes the a priority of nature with respect to mind, 
but without segregating mind from any part of nature or 
Mathesis. The principle of sufficient reason therefore states: 
something emerges from nothing, and this process is inviolable.
Oken’s natural history of metaphysics therefore indicates 
that naturephilosophy is not simply a means, but the necessary 
means by which post-Kantian philosophy escapes the trap 
that the ethical process sets for it: the primacy of nature 
extends even to those slimy neural accretions to the primal 
Zero that make metaphysics possible.

On the Horror of Phenomenology:

In a dismissive review of a recent anthology on 
Schelling, Andrew Bowie accuses two authors of a style 
he ‘increasingly’ thinks of as ‘continental science fiction’.1 
There is room for further increase in Bowie’s thinking. With 
his implication that science fiction belongs to the juvenile or 
the unhinged, Bowie enforces a sad limitation on mental 
experiment. For nothing resembles science fiction more 
than philosophy does — unless it be science itself. From 
its dawning in ancient Greece, philosophy has been the 
asylum of strange notions: a cosmic justice fusing opposites 
into a restored whole; a series of emanations from fixed 
stars to the moon to the prophets; divine intervention in the

movement of human hands and legs; trees and diamonds 
with infinite parallel attributes, only two of them known; 
insular monads sparkling like mirrors and attached to tiny 
bodies built from chains of other monads; and the eternal 
recurrence of every least event. While the dismal consensus 
that such speculation belongs to the past is bolstered by the 
poor imagination of some philosophers, it finds no support 
among working scientists, who grow increasingly wild in 
their visions. Even a cursory glance at the physics literature 
reveals a discipline bewitched by strange attractors, 
degenerate topologies, black holes filled with alternate 
worlds, holograms generating an illusory third dimension, 
and matter composed of vibrant ten-dimensional strings. 
Mathematics, unconstrained by empirical data, has long 
been still bolder in its gambles. Nor can it be said that science 
fiction is a marginal feature of literature itself. Long before 
the mighty crabs and squids of Lovecraft and the tribunals 
of Kafka, we had Shakespeare’s witches and ghosts, Mt. 
Purgatory in the Pacific, the Cyclops in the Mediterranean, 
and the Sphinx tormenting the north of Greece.
Against the model of philosophy as a rubber stamp for 
common sense and archival sobriety, I would propose that 
philosophy’s sole mission is weird realism. Philosophy must 
be realist because its mandate is to unlock the structure of 
the world itself; it must be weird because reality is weird. 
‘Continental science fiction’, and ‘continental horror’, must 
be transformed from insults into a research program. It 
seems fruitful to launch this program with a joint treatment 
of Edmund Husserl and H.P. Lovecraft, an unlikely pair 
that I will try to render more likely. The dominant strand 
of twentieth-century continental thought stems from the

337
phenomenology of Husserl, whose dry and affable works 
conceal a philosophy tinged with the bizarre. In almost the 
same period, the leading craftsman of horror and science 
fiction in literature was Lovecraft, recently elevated from 
pulp author to canonical classic by the prestigious Library 
of America series.2 The road to continental science fiction 
leads through a Lovecraftian reading of phenomenology. 
This remark is not meant as a prank. Just as Lovecraft 
turns prosaic New England towns into the battleground 
of extradimensional fiends, Husserl’s phenomenology 
converts simple chairs and mailboxes into elusive units that 
emit partial, contorted surfaces. In both authors, the broken 
link between objects and their manifest crust hints at ‘such 
terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position 
therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation 
or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of 
a new dark age’3 – or preferably, revive a metaphysical 
speculation that embraces the permanent strangeness of 
objects. If philosophy is weird realism, then a philosophy 
should be judged by what it can tell us about Lovecraft. 
In symbolic terms, Great Cthulhu should replace Minerva 
as the patron spirit of philosophers, and the Miskatonic 
must dwarf the Rhine and the Ister as our river of choice. 
Since Heidegger’s treatment of Hölderlin resulted mostly 
in pious, dreary readings, philosophy needs a new literary 
hero.

Lovecraft’s Materialism
In the great tales of Lovecraft we find a mythology 
centered in New England, but ranging from the Antarctic 
to Pluto as well. Humans are no longer lords of the cosmos, 
but are surrounded by hidden monstrosities who evade or 
corrupt our race, sometimes plotting its downfall. ‘The Old 
Ones’, or ‘Those Ones’, are the disturbing general terms by 
which these creatures are known. They vastly exceed us in 
mental and physical prowess, yet occasionally interbreed 
with human females, preferring women of a decayed 
genetic type. The least encounter with the Old Ones often 
results in mental breakdown, and all reports of dealings 
with them are hushed. But their unspeakable powers are 
far from infinite. To achieve their aims, the Old Ones seek 
minerals in the hills of Vermont, infiltrate churches in 
seaport towns, and pursue occult manuscripts under the 
eyes of suspicious librarians. Their researches are linked 
not only with Lovecraft’s fictional authors and archives (the 
mad Arab al-Hazred, Miskatonic University), but real ones 
as well (Pico della Mirandola, Harvard’s Widener Library). 
Their corpses are carried away by floods, and even the 
mighty Cthulhu explodes, though briefly, when rammed 
by a human-built ship. There are also rivalries between 
the monsters, as becomes clear in ‘At the Mountains of 
Madness’. The powers of the various Old Ones are no 
more uniform than they are infinite.
This balance in the monsters between power and frailty 
is mentioned to oppose any Kantian reading of Lovecraft. 
Such a reading is understandable, since Kant’s inaccessible 
noumenal world seems a perfect match for the cryptic 
stealth of Lovecraft’s creatures. His descriptions of their

339
bodies and actions are almost deliberately insufficient, and 
seem to allude to dimensions beyond the finite conditions 
of human perception. His monsters are not just mysterious, 
but often literally invisible; they undermine our stock of 
emotional responses and zoological categories. The very 
architecture of their cities mocks the principles of Euclidean 
geometry. A few examples will indicate the style:
When a traveler in north central Massachusetts takes the 
wrong fork at the junction of the Aylesbury Pike […] he comes 
upon a lonely and curious country […] Gorges and ravines of 
problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden 
bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips 
again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively 
dislikes […]4
Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect of 
incisions, seemed to inflict the visible cattle […]5
[Wilbur Whateley] would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar 
jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener 
with a sense of unexplainable terror.6
And most compellingly:
It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human 
pen could describe [the dead creature on the floor], but one 
may properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by 
anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely 
bound up with the life-forms of this planet and of the three 
known dimensions.7

At the climax of ‘The Dunwich Horror’, when Curtis 
Whateley briefly glimpses the formerly hidden creature 
on the mountaintop, he describes it as made of squirming 
ropes, shaped somewhat like a hen’s egg, with dozens of 
legs like barrels that shut halfway as it walks — a jelly-like 
creature having nothing solid about it, with great bulging 
eyes and ten or twenty mouths, somewhat grey in color 
with blue or purple rings, and a ‘half-face’ on top.8 In the 
later tale ‘At the Mountains of Madness’, the vast Antarctic 
city displays ‘no architecture known to man […] with vast 
aggregations of night-black masonry embodying monstrous 
perversions of known geometrical laws.’9 When this dead 
metropolis is first sighted from the air, the narrator assumes 
it must be a polar mirage:
There were truncated cones, sometimes terraced or fluted, 
surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously 
enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped discs; 
and strange, beetling, table-like constructions suggesting piles 
of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-
pointed stars […] There were composite cones and pyramids 
either alone or surmounting cylinders and cubes or flatter 
truncated cones and pyramids, and occasional needle-like 
spires in curious clusters of five. All of these febrile structures 
seemed knit together by tubular bridges […].10
The near-incoherence of such descriptions undercuts 
any attempt to render them in visual form. The very point 
of the descriptions is that they fail, hinting only obliquely at 
some unspeakable substratum of reality. It is obvious why 
this might seem Kantian in its implications.

Nonetheless, the Kantian reading fails. Even if we 
accepted a metaphysics splitting the world into noumenal 
and phenomenal realms, there is no question that the 
Old Ones would belong entirely to the phenomenal. The 
mere fact of invisibility is surely not enough to qualify 
the monsters as noumenal. The so-called Higgs boson of 
present-day physics, assuming it exists, lies beyond the gaze 
of current particle accelerators. No one has ever witnessed 
the core of the earth, or the center of the Milky Way which 
may or may not be home to a massive black hole. Countless 
other forces must exist in the universe that could be only 
decades away from discovery, while others will remain 
shielded from human insight in perpetuity. But this does not 
make them noumenal: these forces, however bizarre, would 
still belong to the causal and spatio-temporal conditions 
that, for Kant, belong solely to the structure of human 
experience. Let us grant further that the Old Ones may 
have features permanently outstripping human intelligence, 
in a way that the Higgs boson may not. Even so, this would 
be the result not of the transcendental structure of human 
finitude, but only of our relative stupidity. The game of 
chess is not ‘noumenal’ for dogs through their inability to 
grasp it, and neither is Sanskrit grammar for a deranged 
adult or a three-year-old. In ‘The Whisperer in Darkness’, 
the Old Ones even invite humans to become initiated into 
their larger view of the world:
Do you realise what it means when I say that I have been on 
thirty-seven different celestial bodies — planets, dark stars, and 
less definable objects — including eight outside our galaxy and 
two outside the curved cosmos of space and time? […] The 
visitors are eager to know men of knowledge like yourself, and 
to shew them the great abysses that most of us have had to 
dream about in fanciful ignorance.11 
Humans prepare to reach these deeper abysses, neither 
through Heideggerian Angst nor a mystical experience that 
leaps beyond finitude and reduces philosophy to straw, but 
through purely medical means: ‘My brain has been removed 
from my body by fissions so adroit that it would be crude to 
call them surgery.’12 The great horror of Lovecraft’s universe 
lies not in some sublime infinite that no finite intelligence 
can fully grasp, but in the invasion of the finite world by 
finite malignant beings. For all the limits imposed on our 
intellect by Kant, he leaves us reassured that the finite and 
phenomenal world is insulated from horror, governed 
and structured by our own familiar categories. Far more 
troubling is Lovecraft’s subversion of the finite world: no 
longer a kingdom led by innocuous rational beings, but one 
in which humans face entities as voracious as insects, who 
use black magic and telepathy while employing mulatto 
sailors as worse-than-terrorist operatives.
The Old Ones are anything but noumenal. Noumenal 
beings scarcely have need of buildings, whether Euclidean 
or otherwise. Noumenal beings are not dissected on the 
tables of polar explorers, do not mine for rocks in Vermont, 
and have no purpose mastering Arabic and Syriac dialects 
to consult the writings of medieval wizards. They would 
never speak in physical voices, not even with ‘the drone 
of some loathsome, gigantic insect ponderously shaped 
into the articulate speech of an alien species […] [with] 
singularities of timbre, range, and overtones [placing it]

wholly outside the sphere of humanity and earth-life.’13 
Michel Houellebecq, in a brilliant study of Lovecraft,14 
is correct to emphasize his absolute materialism: ‘What 
is Great Cthulhu? An arrangement of electrons, like us. 
Lovecraft’s terror is rigorously material. But, it is quite 
possible, given the free interplay of cosmic forces, that 
Great Cthulhu possesses abilities and powers to act that far 
exceed ours. Which, a priori, is not particularly reassuring 
at all.’15
The terror of Lovecraft is not a noumenal horror, then, 
but a horror of phenomenology. Humans cease to be 
master in their own house. Science and letters no longer 
guide us toward benevolent enlightenment, but may force 
us to confront ‘notions of the cosmos, and of [our] own 
place in the seething vortex of time, whose merest mention 
is paralysing’, and ‘impose monstrous and unguessable 
horrors upon certain venturous [humans]’.16 Confronted 
with the half-human offspring of the Old Ones, even the 
political Left will endorse the use of concentration camps: 
‘Complaints from many liberal organizations were met 
with long confidential discussions, and representatives were 
taken on trips to certain camps and prisons. As a result, 
these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent’.17

To expand on a passage cited earlier:
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of 
the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid 
island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it 
was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each 
straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; 
but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge 
will open such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful 
position within, that we shall either go mad from the revelation 
or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new 
dark age.18

Though ostensibly Kantian on a first reading, nothing 
could be less Kantian than this passage in its call for barriers 
to enlightenment, and its placement of ‘terrifying vistas’ 
not in some transcendent sublime, but in the electrons that 
form the pulpy torso of Great Cthulhu.
The Weirdness of Objects
The literary critic Harold Bloom shares the following 
anecdote:
Some years ago, on a stormy night in New Haven, I sat down to 
reread, yet once more, John Milton’s Paradise Lost […] I wanted 
to start all over again with the poem: to read it as though I had 
never read it before, indeed as though no one had ever read it 
before me […] And while I read, until I fell asleep in the middle 
of the night, the poem’s initial familiarity began to dissolve 
[…] Although the poem is a biblical epic, in classical form, the 
peculiar impression it gave me was what I generally ascribe to 
literary fantasy or science fiction, not to heroic epic. Weirdness 
was its overwhelming effect.19 
 Science fiction is found not only in ‘science fiction’, 
but in great literature of any sort. More generally, Bloom 
contends that ‘one mark of an originality that can win 
canonical status for a literary work is a strangeness that 
we either never altogether assimilate, or that becomes 
such a given that we are blinded to its idiosyncracies.’20 
Although Bloom has little time for philosophy, which 
he views as cognitively less original than literature, his 
standard of canonical achievement seems equally valid for 
19. Harold Bloom, The Western Canon, 24-5. (New York: Riverhead Books, 2004).

philosophical work. If there is one feature that unites the 
great works of philosophy, it is surely their inability to be 
fully assimilated, or their tendency to become such a given 
that we are blinded to their strangeness. Though Plato 
and Kant can be seen as restrictive establishment figures, 
their works are saturated with deviant images and nearly 
fantastic concepts; they exceed all possible interpretation, 
resist all attempted summary, and appeal to readers of 
any nationality or political orientation. The education of 
young philosophers builds on these works as on bedrock. 
And they come alive only when some gifted interpreter 
rediscovers their strangeness.
Pressing further, it also seems evident that the 
strangeness of works comes less from the works as a whole 
than from the weirdness of the personae that fill them, 
whether in literature, philosophy, or science. Though Don 
Quixote and Lear’s Fool appear solely in literary works, 
they are no more reducible to extant plot lines than our 
friends are exhaustively grasped by our dealings with them. 
Characters, in the broadest sense, are objects. Though we 
only come to know them through specific literary incidents, 
these events merely hint at a character’s turbulent inner 
life — which lies mostly outside the work it inhabits, 
and remains fully equipped for sequels that the author 
never produced. If a lost Shakespearean tragedy were 
discovered, dealing with the apparent suicide of the Fool 
(who disappears without explanation from the existing 
text of King Lear), the same Fool would have to be present 
in the new work, however unexpected its speeches. The 
same is true of philosophical concepts, which must also be 
viewed as characters or objects. While recent philosophy 

COLLAPSE IV
346
Harman – Horror of Phenomenology / Tilford – Agitations
347
insists on precise definitions of every term, a genuine 
philosophical concept always eludes such precision. We 
could list the known features of Leibniz’s monads in a 
laminated chart, yet the list includes contradictions, and 
surely leaves us hungry for more. The same holds true of 
argon in chemistry or the string in physics. A thing cannot 
be reduced to the definitions we give of it, because then 
the thing would change with each tiny change in its known 
properties, as Kripke has sharply objected.21 A good rule of 
thumb is as follows: unless a character gives rise to different 
interpretations, unless a scientific entity endures changed 
notions of its properties, unless a philosopher is entangled 
in contradictory assertions over one and the same concept, 
unless a new technology has unforeseen impact, unless a 
politician’s party is one day disappointed, unless a friend is 
able to generate and experience surprises, then we are not 
dealing with anything very real. We will be dealing instead 
with useful surface qualities, not with objects. Let ‘object’ 
refer to any reality with an autonomous life deeper than its 
qualities, and deeper than its relations with other things. 
In this sense, an object is reminiscent of an Aristotelian 
primary substance, which supports different qualities at 
different times. Socrates can laugh, sleep, or cry at various 
moments while still remaining Socrates – which entails that 
he can never be exhaustively described or defined.
My thesis is that objects and weirdness go hand in 
hand. An object partly evades all announcement through 
its qualities, resisting or subverting efforts to identify it with 
any surface. It is that which exceeds any of the qualities, 
accidents, or relations that can be ascribed to it: an ‘I know 
21. Saul Kripke, Naming and Necessity. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1996).
not what’, but in a positive sense. Against frequent efforts 
to dismiss objects as fantasies assembled by humans from 
a pre-given surface of experienced contents, I contend that 
reality is object-oriented. Reality is made up of nothing 
but substances — and they are weird substances with a 
taste of the uncanny about them, rather than stiff blocks 
of simplistic physical matter. Contact with reality begins 
when we cease to reduce a thing to its properties or to its 
effect on other things. The difference between objects and 
their peripheral features (qualities, accidents, relations) is 

COLLAPSE IV
348
Harman – Horror of Phenomenology / Tilford – Agitations
349
absolute. Though this thesis is deeply classical, it cannot 
possibly be ‘reactionary’, since the objects of which I speak 
resist all reduction to dogma, and in fact are the only force 
in the world capable of doing so.
Intentional Objects
Few will object to the term ‘weird realism’ as a description 
of Lovecraft’s outlook. Weird Tales was the periodical that 
spawned his career, and ‘weird fiction’ the term most 
often used for his own writings. Lovecraft was opposed to 
realism in the literary sense of James or Zola, their minute 
descriptions confined to the subtleties of human life. Yet 
he seems like a realist in the philosophical sense, hinting 
at dark powers and malevolent geometries subsisting well 
beyond the grasp of human life. By contrast, Edmund 
Husserl seems to be neither weird, nor a realist, and even 
looks like the opposite: a ‘non-weird antirealist’. No reader, 
however emotionally unstable, is terrified by Husserl’s 
works. Even in his life history, the sufferings we find stem 
from personal and political burdens, not from the family 
strain of madness that paralyzed the young Lovecraft and 
destroyed his parents. Moreover, when phenomenology 
is critiqued or abandoned, this is usually because of its 
wholehearted idealism. All of phenomenology results from 
a decision to ‘bracket’ the world, suspending reflection 
on real waves, genes, and chemicals in favor of what lies 
entirely within human consciousness. Ironically, this point 
has led some to compare Husserl with Kant as well. Here 
the comparison fails yet again, but for the opposite reason: 
while Lovecraft’s monsters are too shallow to be noumenal, 
Husserl’s intentional objects are too deep to be purely 
phenomenal.
Husserl often proclaimed his motto: ‘to the things 
themselves’. Though the phrase is partly misleading, it 
should be taken more seriously by those realists who find 
little of value in his thought. The first step is to remember 
that Husserl’s ‘things themselves’ are obviously not meant 
in the Kantian sense. His bracketing of nature leaves him 
with an immanent world of pure experience. Description 
(not explanation, as with realists) is taken to be the sole 
philosophical method. Furthermore, there is no room in 
Husserl for real things that might be viewed directly by 
God and that lie outside the parameters of human access to 
the world. All of this might seem to lead to a mere flattening 
of the noumenal into a special case of the phenomenal, as 
found in Fichte and his heirs. In his ontology, Husserl would 
seem to belong to the tradition of German Idealism; his 
own student Heidegger sometimes makes this claim, hinting 
vaguely that Husserlian phenomenology is the same basic 
project as Hegel’s Science of Logic. Some observers might even 
be seduced by the recurrence of the term ‘phenomenology’ 
in both Husserl and Hegel.
But despite Husserl’s fixation on the immanent world 
of appearance, he injects a dose of obstinate reality into the 
immanence. This occurs through his notion of intentional 
objects. The principle of intentionality is well-known: 
every mental act has some object, whether it be thinking, 
indicating, wishing, judging, or hating. This principle 
has not been correctly understood. It does not mean that 
Husserl somehow escapes idealism: his intentional objects 
remain purely immanent, and must not be confused with 
real forces unleashed in the world. The trees I perceive, the 
food I enjoy, or the swindlers I despise, remain phenomenal 

COLLAPSE IV
350
Harman – Horror of Phenomenology / Tilford – Agitations
351
entities. After all, their real existence is bracketed, so that our 
description of them takes no account of whether they truly 
exist. Intentionality remains phenomenal. But Husserl’s 
genuine difference from the idealists lies in the fact that 
intentional reality is made up of objects, which play no role 
at all for Fichte or Hegel. It is said that Husserl would lead 
his students through painstaking descriptions of a mailbox; 
perhaps on other days it was lampposts, inkwells, cats, 
rings, or vases. The point of such descriptions was ‘eidetic 
variation’, considering these objects from a variety of angles 
so as to approach their unvarying essence beneath all passing 
manifestation. The mere fact that intentional objects 
have an essence should prevent our seeing Husserl as a 
straightforward idealist, since ‘essence’ is normally a realist 
term, linked with the inherent features of a substance apart 
from all access to it. It is unthinkable that Fichte or Hegel 
would guide their students through minute descriptions 
of a specific solid object, since in their current of thinking 
objects have no stubborn essence of their own. ‘Essence’, for 
Hegel, is sublated into the higher unity of the concept, and 
Hegelians even like to accuse later continentals of a fixation 
on essence. By contrast, though Husserl brackets the world 
in order to focus on an immanent field of consciousness, 
the ego is not entirely master in this immanent realm. Cats 
and lampposts resist our first approach, demanding patient 
labours if their essence is to be gradually approached. While 
the shadows in Heidegger’s thought lie buried beneath 
perception, Husserl’s mysteries riddle the field of perception 
itself. Yet both thinkers allow for secrets to be harboured in 
the core of the things, and this is what separates them from 
idealism. Despite their regrettable focus on human reality, 
Husserl and Heidegger are object-oriented philosophers.
In one sense Husserl’s obvious rival is psychologism, 
which holds that logical laws have only psychological 
validity. Husserl assaults this position in his massive 
prologue to the Logical Investigations, concluding that logic is 
objective through its ideal validity within the phenomenal 
realm. But an equally important rival is British Empiricism. 
Logical Investigations II is a detailed critique of the positions of 
Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. For all the differences between 
these three classic figures, it is safe to portray them as allied 
in advance against intentional objects. What comes first for 
the empiricists are isolated qualities, sometimes known as 
‘impressions.’ By contrast, the tradition of phenomenology 
begins not with qualities, but with phenomenal objects. 
While the British school holds that objects are a bundle 
produced through the habit of linking diverse qualities 
together (Hume), or by imagining that hidden powers 
underlie qualities already seen (Locke), phenomenologists 
such as Husserl and Merleau-Ponty insist on beginning 
with the total Gestalt before any reduction to discrete 
tones and hues. For phenomenology, the slamming door 
and the black fountain pen precede their qualities, which 
gain sense only through a relative enslavement to those 
objects. Herein lies the greatness of phenomenology, which 
is more empirical than the empiricists. Experience is not 
of ‘experienced contents’, but of objects; isolated qualities 
are found not in the world we experience, but only in the 
annals of empiricism.
In Logical Investigations V, the rival is Husserl’s own teacher 
Brentano, whether fairly or not. If Brentano held that all 
mental acts are grounded in some sort of presentation, 
Husserl twisted the formulation slightly, countering that 

COLLAPSE IV
352
Harman – Horror of Phenomenology / Tilford – Agitations
353
all mental acts are object-giving. The difference is subtle, but 
fateful. A presentation seems to put all its contents on the 
same footing. To represent a globe or a tower is to witness 
a specific configuration of colors, textures, shadows, and 
physical co-ordinates. But if we see experience as object-
giving rather than presentational, we shift our focus toward 
the essential nucleus of the perception, stripping the paint 
and confetti from its outer shell through eidetic variation. 
And here we find the crucial difference between Husserl’s 
intentional objects and the real objects of realist philosophers. 
Real objects, which play no role in the bracketed thinking 
of Husserl, subsist apart from their relations to anything 
else; no reality could be independent if it were generated 
by efforts to perceive or influence it. In this sense, it seems 
obvious that real objects must partly withhold themselves 
from all perception, description, registration, or cataloguing 
of their traits. A substance simply is what it is, and exceeds 
the endless summation of qualities that can be ascribed 
to it. But strangely enough, this is not true of Husserl’s 
intentional objects, where an inverse relation holds. Without 
belabouring a point made elsewhere,22 whereas real objects 
taunt us with endless withdrawal, intentional objects are 
always already present. A real tree would be deeper than 
anything that can be said or known about it, but the tree 
of intentional experience is entirely present from the start 
— it is always a genuine element of experience, affecting my 
decisions and my moods. If the real tree is never present 
enough, the intentional tree is always excessively present, 
its essence accompanied by the noisy peripheral detail 
that eidetic variation needs to strip away. The real object 
‘fire’ is able to scald, burn, boil, melt, and crack other 
real objects, while the intentional object ‘fire’ has a very 
different function: it merely unifies a shifting set of profiles 
and surfaces whose various flickerings never affect its ideal 
unity. Real objects hide; intentional objects are merely 
weighed down with trains of sycophantic qualities, covering 
them like cosmetics and jewels.

The Weirdness of Husserl
The strangest defect of the books that Husserl published 
during his lifetime lies in how few descriptions they actually 
contain. Whatever he may have done in the classroom, 
one scours his principal works in vain for more than a 
handful of concrete examples. Husserl seemed content, 
in his major published writings, with hesitant manifestoes 
for phenomenology; Merleau-Ponty and Lingis, heirs of 
greater stylistic gifts, were left to put the method to the test. 
Consider the case of some massive artifact – say, a hotel 
complex such as the Nile Hilton, in my adopted home city. 
The phenomenologist might see it as follows: The hotel is 
not an arbitrary conglomerate pieced together from flecks 
of color and sound. What we first encounter is the hotel as a 
whole, its visible profiles all joined in allegiance to the total 
reality of the object. Observers may disagree over the exact 
boundaries of the facility, over where its style begins and 
ceases to reign, but all will agree that the hotel is present in 
consciousness as a unit. The various doors, plants, gates, 
windows, and guards are clearly imbued with a kind of 
hotel-being, since all would strike us quite differently if 
stripped from this zone and encountered elsewhere. We 
now circle the hotel, soaking up the feel of its various 
entryways: grand entrance in front, dusty two-guard access 
in back, glamorous terraces when viewed from the south 
at a distance, and grim windowless façade to the north. 
We explore the interior, passing from food court to travel 
agencies to weight room to rooftop lounge, finally knocking 
on random doors and asking to examine individual rooms. 
Never in these movements do we see the whole of the 
Hilton, yet never do we lose the sense of a general style to 
which the individual scenes belong. It is not important that 
moths and beetles would not also see it as a ‘hotel’, since we 
are dealing here not with objective reality, but only with our 
human intention of the hotel as a unified whole. Normally, we 
make no separation between an intentional object and the 
surface features through which it is announced. Though we 
only see one face of the hotel at a time, the presence of hotel 
and surface seem to be simultaneous, and joined together 
without fissure.
Yet this intimate bond between object and quality 
is an illusion, as both Husserl and Lovecraft are aware. 
Let’s begin with a Lovecraftian version of the hotel. This 
requires an attempt to mimic his own literary style — a 
method of reverent parody that deserves to become a staple 
of philosophy. The following paragraphs might be found in 
an unwritten Lovecraft tale, ‘The Nile Hilton Incident’: 
Though apparently of recent date, the Nile Hilton is built 
around strange inner corridors of disturbingly ancient 
provenance. Its membership in the Hilton chain, meant to 
reassure travelers from the Occident, conceals grotesque legal 
maneuvers and deviant managerial practices of a purely local 
origin, and provides cover for a dubious history long expunged 
from brochures. The doormen are slumped and sullen in a 
manner atypical of Egypt, while their complexions speak 
vaguely of a strange admixture of Aztec and Polynesian blood 
not consonant with the known history of the city. 
Unnoticed by the casual witness, the building itself embodies 
subtle though monstrous distortions of sound engineering 
principle. Though the outer walls seem to meet at solid right 
angles, the hue of the concrete departs from accustomed values 
in a manner suggestive of frailty or buckling. The gaping air-
shafts are striking for an edifice of such late construction, and

seem fitted to an age when consumption and leprosy were still 
in abundance. For unknown reasons, several of the fire escapes 
would appear to issue beneath the surface of the ground. And 
though the rear façade displays no evident structural flaws, 
there is a sense of looming collapse in the area; one arising less 
from visual clues than from certain peculiarities of sound and 
odour which the management has refused to acknowledge. It 
is here that a faint but incessant thumping or scraping noise 
is combined with a scent joining the aroma of sandalwood to 
one oddly reminiscent of the corpses of bovines. In response to 
occasional complaints, the concierge makes ostentatious show 
of despatching inspectors; yet something in the rhythm of his 
response gives the unwonted impression of deceit.
Presumably, Merleau-Ponty was never a reader of 
Lovecraft. This is unfortunate, since their methods of 
description have a great deal in common. Although 
we normally encounter things clothed in a variety of 
costumes, we pass silently and directly through these 
garments to the thing as a whole, which seems to imbue 
them with its spirit. But in Lovecraft, the relation between 
a thing and its surface is perturbed by irregularities that 
resist immediate comprehension, as if the object suffered 
from a strange disease of the nervous system. In real life, 
an Egyptian doorman is usually found in a cheerful and 
careless pose, displaying the typical physiognomy of the 
southern populations of Aswan and Luxor. To describe 
him instead as ‘slumped and sullen’, as displaying racial 
features of distant or extinguished peoples, and especially 
to call attention to one’s perplexity over these aberrations, 
leads to a breakdown in the usual immediate bond between 
the doorman and his qualities. A rare fissure is generated 
between the object and its traits. Although ‘Egyptian 
doorman’ remains a legitimate element of our experience, 
he is now a menacing kernel that seems to control his 
outer features like ghastly marionettes, rather than being 
immediately fused with them. Merleau-Ponty would agree 
that the durability of concrete is somehow legible in its 
colour, though the total emotional and perceptual effect 
of a wall is normally simultaneous and unified. But to 
suggest that something is amiss in the expected colour of 
a wall, something that faintly suggests imminent physical 
breakdown, is to decompose the usual bond between the 
phenomenon and the outer forms through which it is 
announced. Language is also able to hint at depth, at real 
things lying outside all access to them. Surprisingly, this 
is not the method of Lovecraft, whose materialism gives 
him a philosophy rooted in the surface, but one in which 
the relation between objects and their crusts is rendered 
problematic. His monsters are not deep in themselves, and 
function in his stories only to disturb the assumptions of 
human observers. One can imagine third-person tales of 
the Old Ones battling in outer space, aeons before the 
emergence of human beings. Such stories would yield 
more of fantasy than of horror, since we would miss the 
gradual awareness of human subordination that provides 
the Cthulhu mythos with its terror. There is nothing 
inherently compelling about a humanoid dragon with an 
octopus for a head; any teenager could draw such a thing, 
while scaring no-one. The horror comes instead from the 
declared insufficiency of the description, combined with a 
literary world in which this monster is a genuine player 
rather than a mere image. The description is horrific only 
insofar as it undermines any distinct image: ‘If I say that my 
somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous

pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, 
I shall not be entirely unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. 
A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly 
body with rudimentary wings; but it was the general outline 
of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful.’23 
Whatever this ‘general outline’ may be, the narrator feels 
that his descriptions are at best ‘not entirely unfaithful’ to 
its spirit. But this is the very principle of phenomenological 
description, whose eidetic reductions never quite grasp the 
essence of the thing, and which differs from Lovecraft only 
in its usual avoidance of the theme of existential threat. 
In both cases, the known link between objects and their 
properties partially dissolves.
23. Lovecraft, Tales, 169. From ‘The Call of Cthulhu.’
While there are palpable similarities between Lovecraft 
and Poe in their preference for moods of horror, too little 
has been said about their similarities of style. In both 
authors we find hesitant and flowery wording that not only 
paints their narrators as frail aesthetes, but effectively stunts 
the relation between things and their traits. In Poe’s tale 
‘The Fall of the House of Usher’, the narrator describes 
Roderick as having ‘a nose of a Hebrew model, but with 
a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely 
moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a 
want of moral energy.’24 To claim directly that there is a 
typical Jewish nose with a specific nostril size, or that the 
character of a person can be read from structures of the 
skull, would merely make one a racist and a phrenologist. 
But Poe’s strange appeal to unexpected disproportions 
of nostril and chin manages to disassemble the complex 
amalgam of surface and inference that silently accompanies 
every new face. To say that Roderick can bear no sounds 
except the music of guitars would merely give an eccentric 
description, not a horrific one. The terror comes instead 
through Poe’s meandering way of depicting the trait: 
‘there were but peculiar sounds, and those from stringed 
instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.’25 
Roderick’s panpsychist theory of inanimate perception 
might be just a vitalist platitude if stated in a journal article. 
Yet Poe surrounds the idea with enlivening obstacles: ‘His 
opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all 
vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had 
assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under

361
certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization.’26 
The phrasing should not be dismissed as belonging to 
a lost era of florid English style; the circumlocution is 
deliberate, and creates a gap between object and profile that 
is concealed in everyday experience. The same holds for 
the narrator’s description of Roderick’s macabre painting 
of an underground tunnel, in which ‘certain accessory 
portions of the design served well to convey the idea that 
this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface 
of the earth’.27 And finally, Poe’s descriptions of music are as 
impossibly vague as Lovecraft’s stunted polar travel diaries. 
Foremost among Roderick’s improvisations on the guitar is 
‘a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild 
air of the last waltz of von Weber’.28 If a musicologist were 
to specify the precise distortions of Roderick’s melodies in 
a report commissioned by psychiatrists, or if we heard a 
recorded version of the music, the effect would be ruined. 
The point is not to pin down his exact deviations from 
mainstream musical practice, but to hint that something 
is terribly amiss in the relation between the music and its 
exact tones.
In Lovecraft as in Poe, the horror of things comes not 
from some transcendent force lying outside the bounds of 
human finitude, but in a twisting or torsion of that finitude 
itself. The immediate fusion between a thing and its 
tangible signals gives way to the detachment of a tortured 
underlying unit from its outward qualities. In similar 
fashion, cubist painting renders its figures paradoxically

distinct from the amassing of planes and angles through 
which they are presented. It is no accident that only certain 
paintings by Georges Braque seem to approach a notion 
of what Lovecraftian architecture might look like,29 and 
surely no accident that Ortega y Gasset links Husserl with 
Picasso.30 That said, we should turn briefly from Lovecraft 
and Poe to the Husserlian version of cubism.

viewed in conjunction with Lovecraft’s description of the Antarctic city.

What is most disturbing about intentional objects is that 
they are both always and never present. Husserl established 
that the field of perception is made up of objects, not sense 
data. Yet hotels, museums, and trees require the most 
laborious work of eidetic variation to free them of all noise, 
and even this method never succeeds. The hotel is present 
from the start, yet we never reach a truly exemplary vision 
of it, free of environmental accident. Nor are these accidents 
ever directly present. As soon as we shift our focus from the 
hotel as a whole to the peripheral dance of light along its 
façade, we have turned sunbeams or moon-rays into our 
new intentional object, and the eidetic reduction will now 
be blocked by further shimmering variations that do not 
affect the beams or rays as a whole. Intentional objects are 
everywhere and nowhere; they ‘bubble and blaspheme 
mindlessly’ at every point in the cosmos. Although vividly 
present as soon as we acknowledge them, intentional objects 
express their reality only by drawing neighboring objects 
into their orbit, and these things in turn are only present by 
enslaving still others. As Merleau-Ponty first observed, the 
structure of perception is not obvious in the least. There is no 
such thing as a directly given experience. Even less directly 
given would be the real objects lying outside all intentional 
experience, bracketed by Husserl and hence not considered 
in this article. Just as Lovecraft’s horror has nothing to 
do with transcendent things themselves, the horror of 
phenomenology arises even though all transcendent reality 
is suspended. Lovecraft’s heroes cannot maintain their faith 
in the familiar contract between things and their properties, 
since the creatures they encounter are never quite captured 
by any list of tentacles or strange vocal timbres. A weird 
reading of phenomenology (the only possible reading) loses 
faith not just in the given sense data of empiricists, but even 
in the clean separation between objects and qualities. What 
is present is never objects or qualities, but only a fission 
between one object and the satellite objects bent by its 
gravitational field, even if everyday perception deadens us 
to this fact.
Without having even considered the status of real 
objects, we find that intentional objects already have a 
weirdness that eludes definition. It is often falsely held 
that phenomena have definite qualitative features, which 
is the position of empiricism, not of Husserl. It is held 
even more widely, and just as falsely, that real objects must 
have definite material features and exact positions in space-
time. These views form the apparent motive for recent 
philosophies of ‘the virtual.’ If real and intentional objects 
are both somehow actual, both fully enshrined in the world 
in a manner that could in principle be described, then 
both seem fully inscribed in a context or web of mutual 
interrelations. And since true realism requires that things 
be considered apart from all relations, the only solution 
would be to shift the scene of realism away from concrete 
objects and phenomena towards disembodied attractors, 
topological invariants, or other virtual entities, all of them 
outstripping any possible embodiment in specific entities.31 
What this step misses is the already abominable 
weirdness of concrete objects, whether real or phenomenal. 
But Lovecraft and Husserl do not miss this point. Though 
the materialism of Lovecraft and the idealism of Husserl 
31. See especially Manuel DeLanda’s wonderful Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy.

might seem to divide them, these doctrines go hand in hand. 
For we are never really sure just what an object is. Whether 
we define it as nothing more than electrons, or as just a shape 
present in consciousness, we replace the fathomless reality 
of things with an intellectual model of what their underlying 
reality ought to be. In this sense, realism tends to oppose 
the outlooks of Lovecraft and Husserl. Yet in a different 
sense, they save the weirdness of objects from its neglect by 
philosophies of the virtual. While such philosophies may 
deserve admiration for insisting on realism against any 
idealism or narrowly physical materialism, they are wrong 
to hold that objects are always utterly specific. Lovecraft 
(surprisingly) and Husserl (unsurprisingly) remain fixed on 
a material/phenomenal plane that prevents them from being 
full-blown metaphysical realists. But at least they grasp the 
weird tension in the phenomena themselves, always in tense 
dissolution from their qualities. It is a one-legged realism 
that misses the genuine hiddenness of things, but a weird 
realism nonetheless.

Arbor Deformia
 
Among manuscripts published and treatises written 
on teratology and cryptozoology, one work has been 
more influential than others: Ambroise Paré’s Des monstres 
et des prodiges, written in the sixteenth century. Paré was a 
distinguished French surgeon, the royal surgeon of Henry 
II, Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III. Monsters and 
Prodigies was penned by Paré at the peak of the sixteenth-
century teratological frenzy inherited from the occult 
and medical preoccupations of the Middle Ages. Written 
toward the later stages of his professional life as a surgeon, 
Monsters and Prodigies is a monstrous paean to arborescent 
models of taxonomy. For Paré, as a scientist who believed 
that his teratologic treatise should be incorporated with his 
works on surgery and practical medicine, the problem of 
taxonomy is more twisted and deformed than monsters 
and deformities themselves. Problems inherited from 
the Middle Ages concerning theological riddles, occult 
forces and fantastic fauna cannot easily be reconciled with 
Renaissance solutions. Therefore, for Paré what is deemed 
as truly monstrous is taxonomy itself: How is it possible to 
build a monstrous order or taxonomy to bring all fiends, rogue beings, 
demonic deformities and divine marvels back into the fold?

‘Taxonomy as monstrous’, ‘hierarchy as deformity’, 
‘category as schizophrenic order’ and ‘tree as lusus naturae’ 
could all stand as partial characterisations of Paré’s 
teratological system. In order to tackle the enigma of 
deformities, monsters and prodigies once and for all, Paré 
creates a paraphysical model in which (I) Singularity, (II) 
planes and (III) forces are the main components from 
which to concoct a taxonomic system. Forces derive from 
different fields or spheres and vary from occult-paranormal 
to mechanical-physical forces; in Paré’s system, most of 
the taxonomies evolve out of interactions between these 
elements. These interactions include the application of 
forces to planes, the fusion of forces with each other or 
the conflict of certain forces with singularity. However, the 
force of Godhead or singularity is capable of developing 
taxonomies on its own. These elements can produce thirteen 
causes which incite abnormalities. Further classifying, Paré 
divides these causes into another four groups based on 
which deformities are identified: (i) marvellous causes, (ii) 
monstrous causes, (iii) mutilating causes and finally (iv) 
fraudulent causes. Marvelous causes are those which belong 
to the direct intervention of God and are divided into (1) 
wrath and (2) glory of God. Monstrous causes originate 
from the fusion of different forces or the application of 
different forces to certain planes; they are (3) too many 
seeds, (4) too little seed and (5) maternal imagination 
during pregnancy. Mutilations are mostly brought forth 
by the application of mechanical forces either directly to 
the embryo or through the womb; the rest originate from 
biological forces which themselves are divided into two 
sources, interspecies and hereditary. Mutilations include 
(6) deformity or smallness of the womb, (7) bodily postures 
of the mother during pregnancy, (8) unnatural pressure, 

Alvanson – Arbor Deformia
371
blows or even a blast of air to the womb, (9) hereditary 
or accidental illnesses, (10) rotten seed, (11) mingling of 
seeds belonging to different species. The fourth category of 
causes, fraudulent causes, are strictly related to occult forces: 
(12) through the artifice of wicked beggars, (13) demons 
and the Devil himself. Among these thirteen causes, 11 and 
13 can form a categorical alliance – causes by unnatural 
conceptions (13a). The causes involving seeds (3, 4, 10, 11) 
can merge together to compose yet another offshoot, causes 
by unnatural seeds (13b). In this manner, Paré continues to 
add more branches, stems, branchlets, twigs and unnatural 
fruits to his taxonomy. Although Paré briefly touches on 
African and oceanic monsters, he emphasizes that the 
origin of monsters should be left hidden, referring to the 
cryptogenic essence of the monstrous. 
The Arbor Deformia (see p.368) is a schematic designed 
after the Paréan system of teratological taxonomy. Taking 
taxonomy as the monstrous idea inclusive of all monsters 
and deformities, the Arbor Deformia is an arborescent model 
in the tradition of the early trees of knowledge, elements, 
demons and celestial bodies. The Arbor Deformia follows the 
tradition of arborescent distributions where the idea of the 
tree is the ratio of two operations, contraction and expansion, 
represented by two folds, roots and branches. In early 
arborescent models the tree is not a dichotomous totality 
but a proportional relation between the underground and 
elevated activities; it is also the perpetuation of asymmetries 
or deformities in symmetry or form. The non-dichotomous 
relation between the root and the branch is typified by 
the trunk as the middle-ground part of the model. Given 
that the tree is a ratio between underground and elevated 
activities, it can be infinitely deformed without losing its 

COLLAPSE IV
372
defining outlines. As a part of the ratio between roots and 
branches, new changes can be made within the existing 
range which is marked by the two poles, roots and branches. 
This enormous capacity for deformation is exemplified in 
the image of hollow trees. Hollow trees frequently appear in 
illustrations and paintings of the Grotteschi style, Arabesque–
inspired ornamental engravings of the sixteenth century, 
not to mention the dead elm trees that feature in Italian 
Renaissance paintings. A thirteenth-century engraving from 
the Ornamentale Vorlage-Blätter made by the Flemish sculptor 
and draughtsman Cornelis Floris II depicts a tree which is 
not a tree, but a sport of nature. Alluding to the forbidden 
fruit of the Garden of Eden, Floris’ tree is in the shape of a 
fruit bursting open with demons, monsters and serpents. It 
is a hollowness which only in appearance bears the burden 
of its tree-ness.
New forces and planes have been added to Arbor 
Deformia to include those causes of deformities which are 
absent in Paré’s taxonomy. Arbor Deformia is comprised of 
five forces and two planes. Forces include (1) hereditary 
biological forces, (2) inter-specific biological forces, (3) 
mechanical forces, (4) occult forces, and (5) geopathic 
forces. The plane of the differential and the plane of geo-
mechanics are the receptive planes for forces. The plane 
of geo-mechanics is not directly involved in producing 
deformities and monsters, but connects two different forces 
which can cause abnormalities: The plane of the differential 
expresses the embryonic stage of cell differentiation. A 
blow is a mechanical force; when it is applied to the womb 
during the embryonic differentiation of cells it can cause a 
deformity in the fetus and consequently, the newborn. For 
example, a mechanical shock transmitted to the limb buds 

COLLAPSE IV
Alvanson – Arbor Deformia
375
can later cause the baby to have seven toes on each foot and 
no elbows, because the limb buds contain in themselves the 
ideas of toes and elbows which will later differentiate into the 
actual toes and elbows. Excessive or unwanted application 
of mechanical forces to the embryo may cause a group of 
deformities called mutilations. In Arbor Deformia, marvels 
are created by singularities such as the direct intervention 
of God. The cases of deformities or inversion of internal 
organs which are not lethal are usually associated with the 
direct intervention of God and considered marvels. Jean 
Macé, a seventy-two-year-old soldier, was dissected after 
his death and found to be a perfect epitome of situs inversus, 
with his heart and spleen being on the right, the liver on 
the left. Joseph-Guichard Duverney, the French anatomist, 
declared the case a marvel because the original internal 
deformity was originally situated in the performed germ in 
such a way as not to cause death or mutilation.
Occult forces include a wide range of influences and 
emanations including imagination, electricity, odic and 
magnetic force, demonic influences, etc. The womb, 
according to Renaissance teratological models, is the 
organ  which hungers for external forces.1 Any ambiguous 
emotion or obscure force directed toward a woman will be 
absorbed and picked up by the womb. The classic medieval 
example of the occult influence of imagination upon the 
embryo is ‘a woman looking upon an ape too attentively 
during her pregnancy and as a result giving birth to a baby 
with thick black hair covering the entire body and even 
inside the mouth’. Occult forces can conflict or join with 
other forces to cause deformities. For this reason, occult 
1. According to Renaissance texts, if the female seed does not fruit, it will ferment by 
its own hunger, rot and turn into vermin which will devour or disfigure the womb 
(cf. Isabella de Moerloose’s account in her autobiography, 1695).

COLLAPSE IV
376

forces are mostly involved with fraudulent deformities. For 
example, electricity as an occult force can combine with 
a mechanical force and give rise to a fraud. A mother bat 
warmly breastfeeding its baby on an electricity wire has 
been electrocuted. The mechanical haptic bond between 
the mother and the baby has been captured by electricity; 
and hence, a motherly contact has been deformed to a 
monstrous fraud (see facing page). Occult forces can also 
work upon themselves to produce further frauds. A person 
who has spent a long time in absolute darkness can permeate 
a spectral image joined to his torso or the back of his head. 
Such spectral frauds might be in the form of a second head, 
a shape-shifting and conjoined twin, etc. Such auric or 
proto-ectoplasmic frauds are usually associated with odic,2 
magnetic or other occult emanations. Occult forces are able 
to conflict with singularity or alter the will of God into a 
fraud. A succubus can have sex with a man as he sleeps, 
turning his dream of being a man to the awakening of a 
water beetle. 
In Far Eastern, especially Chinese, teratology, monsters 
can come to life through the combination of earthly 
forces and occult influences. A geopathic force or stress is 
usually defined in terms of harmful earth rays connected 
2. Odic force is a name given in the nineteenth century by Carl von Reichenbach 
to a hypothetical vital force, a life flux which emanates from vital substances and is 
similar to electricity and magnetism. Odic force manifests itself most often in the 
mouth, the hands, the forehead and the occiput and has different laws of distribution 
than those of electricity: ‘Odylo-luminous phenomena of great extent appearing over 
metal plates (electrified or unisolated) do not adhere to the metallic surface, as the 
electrical currents do, but flow over it as the aurora borealis does over the earth. 
Odylic currents do not flow merely from the points but also from the sides of bodies, 
even of jagged bodies, e.g. large crystals: electricity prefers a point for exit.’ (Carl 
von Reichenbach)

to the earth’s electromagnetic fields, fault lines, minerals, 
underground caves, etc. These forces can combine with 
occult forces which influence the plane of geo-mechanics and 
cause particular deformities. A boy at the onset of puberty 
who walks along and over leylines or other energy lines can 
be influenced by earthly-occult radiations which might drive 
the boy mad or increase the rate of bone growth, enlarging 
the head or putting an end to his overall growth. In Chinese 
teratology, there have been cases of pregnant women who, 
after being exposed to a particular location such as a former 
altar for sacrificing humans or a house with a dark history, 
have given birth to extremely deformed babies. Since these 
deformities are caused by more than one obscure force they 
are categorized as the group of multiple frauds. The last two 
forces, the hereditary and inter-specific biological forces, 
make the organic fold of the tree over which non-organic 
forces grow and blossom. Unnatural conceptions between 
pigs and men or ants and lions are among inter-specific 
biological deformities. While deformation by a corrupt 
seed belongs to the hereditary forces or forces associated 
with the lineage. Arbor Deformia shows the proportion of its 
branches to its roots, of the inorganic arms to the organic 
appendages. Monsters, frauds, marvels, mutilations and 
multiple frauds are the fruits of this proportional relation.

Atomised (trans. F. Wynne, London: Heinemann, 2000) – filmed by 
Oscar Roehler in 2006 – and Platform (trans. F. Wynne, London: 
Heinemann, 2002), Michel Houellebecq has published several 
books of poetry (collected in Poésies, Paris: J’ai Lu, 2000) and 
various essays – notably his 1991 book on H. P. Lovecraft Against 
the World, Against Life (trans. D. Khazeni, San Francisco, CA: 
Believer Books, 2005).  Houellebecq’s most recent novel was The 
Possibility of an Island (2005, trans. G. Bowd, London: Weidenfeld & 
Nicolson, 2007). He now lives and works in Ireland.
Oleg Kulik
The practice of Oleg Kulik, who has been internationally acclaimed 
as one of the most radical artists working today, encompasses 
extraordinary live actions, manipulated photography and other 
media. Much of his past work has been concerned with exploring 
the subject of animal as human being or animal as a non-anthro­
pomorphous Other. A book documenting Kulik’s work since 
1993 accompanied his 2001 performance in the UK (Oleg Kulik: 
Art Animal, Birmingham: Ikon Gallery 2001). He is represented by 
XL Gallery, Moscow (xlgallery@gmail.com).
Thomas Ligotti
Thomas Ligotti has gathered a dedicated cult following and 
garnered critical acclaim and awards for his fiction, which includes 
the collections Teatro Grotesco (London: Random House, 2008), 
Noctuary (New York: Carroll and Graf, 1994) and Songs of a Dead 
Dreamer (London: Robinson Publishing, 1989). He is currently 
working on a volume of theoretical writings entitled The Conspiracy 
Against the Human Race.

students from Prague’s Academy of Fine Arts. Their constitu­
tion states that they ‘build on the everyday experience of wide 
social strata; we analyse it and look for points that go beyond the 
sphere of the mundane. With a conscious art form we attempt 
to reflect their interests, dreams, fears, and ambitions. What we 
express is in harmony with their ideas; we speak the language of 
bitter truth.’ 
Steven Shearer
Steven Shearer is an artist who lives and works in Vancouver, 
Canada. Shearer exhibits internationally, with recent exhibitions 
including solo presentations at the IKON Gallery, Birmingham, 
The Power Plant, Contemporary Art Gallery, Toronto, and De 
Appel, Amsterdam, most recently showing at the New Museum, 
New York in a two person exhibition entitled Double Album.

the Study of Esotericism, currently writing his PhD thesis on the 
genesis and development of occult warfare. He is also preparing 
for publication a monograph on the origins of Zoroastrian dualism 
and the concept of Druj.  He continues to pursue further oppor­
tunities to explore the liminal boundary between esoteric and 
academic theory and praxis. 
Eugene Thacker
Eugene Thacker is associate professor of new media at the 
Georgia Institute of Technology. His publications include Biomedia 
(Minneapolis: U. Minnesota Press, 2004) and The Global Genome: 
Biotechnology, Politics and Culture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press).

In a global environment marked by timidity and laxness in thought, re.press 
publishes outstanding work in contemporary philosophy. A dedicated 
philosophy press—one of the very few active in the Anglophone world 
today—re.press is committed to publishing rigorous philosophy that doesn’t 
give way on its desire. At once exclusive and egalitarian, independent and 
open, re.press seeks to support and disseminate such thought worldwide.
re.press is currently publishing under three series:
Anamnesis, Transmission and Anomaly
forthcoming titles
The Mathematics of Novelty: Badiou’s Minimalist Metaphysics
Sam Gillespie
Gillespie tackles the issue of philosophical materialism in Deleuze and Badiou, 
enquiring after the source and nature of the ‘novelty’ that both philosophers of 
multiplicity claim to discover in the objective world. Working with the addition 
of Lacan’s concept of anxiety, the author illuminates the form of the relation 
Badiou determines between philosophy and its conditions (art, love, science, 
politics). This leads to the polemical conclusion that, as a transformative 
project Badiou’s philosophy ultimately reclaims the power of the negative from 
the positivity and pure productiveness of Deleuze’s system, thereby freeing 
thought from the limits set by experience.
The Radical Critique of Liberalism: In Memory of a Vision
Toula Nicolacopoulos
There are many books about liberalism, but no defence of radical critique that 
treats liberal theory with the depth, breadth and intensity of this work. 
Rigorously examining Rawls, Waldron, Larmore and Kymlicka, the book 
demonstrates that an adequate appreciation of the deep structural ﬂaws of 
liberal theory presupposes the application of a critical philosophical 
methodology that has the power to reveal the systemic interconnections within 
and between the varieties of liberal inquiring practices.
Hegel's Jena Philosophy of Nature - 'The Organics'
G.W.F Hegel (translated by Erich D. Freiberger)
Never before translated, this part of Hegel’s work represents a signiﬁcant 
contribution to both Hegelian scholarship and modern philosophy as a whole. 
This translation consists of ‘the Organics’ of 1803/4 and 1805/6 from 
Hegel’s early Jena Philosophy of Nature.

Cyclonopedia: Complicity with Anonymous Materials
Reza Negarestani
The Cyclonopedia manuscript remains one of the few books to rigorously and 
honestly ask what it means to open oneself to a radically non-human life—this 
is a text that screams, from a living assemblage known as the Middle East, ‘I 
am legion.’ Cyclonopedia refuses to be called either ‘theory’ or ‘ﬁction’; a 
heady mixture of philosophy, the occult, and the tentacular fringes of Iranian 
culture—call it ‘occultural studies’ (Eugene Thacker, author of Biomedia and 
The Global Genome). 
The Charmed Circle of Ideology: A Critical Analysis of the 
Emergence of Postmarxism
Geoff Boucher 
Boucher combines close reading, careful exposition and polemical intent to 
offer an immanent critique of ‘postmarxian’ cultural theory. Concentrating his 
attention on Laclau and Mouffe, Butler and Žižek, Boucher links the relativism 
exempliﬁed in contemporary theoretical trends to unresolved philosophical 
problems of modernity. In conclusion, Boucher points to ‘intersubjectivity’ as an 
exit from postmarxist theory’s charmed circle of ideology.

Collapse IV features a series of investigations by philosophers, 
writers and artists into ‘Concept Horror’. Contributors address 
the existential, aesthetic, theological and political dimensions of 
horror, interrogate its peculiar affinity with philosophical thought, 
and uncover the horrors that may lie in wait for those who pursue 
rational thought beyond the bounds of the reasonable.
This unique volume continues Collapse’s pursuit of indisciplinary 
miscegenation, the wide-ranging contributions interacting to 
produce common themes and suggestive connections. In the 
process a rich and compelling case emerges for the intimate bond 
between horror and philosophical thought.
