DEDICATION 
 
 
I dedicate this thesis to my family. My parents, Melanie and Charles Carvell have been 
incredibly supportive and encouraging. They instilled motivation, self confidence, and a hard 
work ethic in me from an early age which had brought me to this graduate school and carried 
me through its courses and requirements. My two little brothers, Robert and Elliot have given 
perspective and support. They remind daily to set an example. I would also like to dedicate 
this to my grandmother Adeline. She was raised by her siblings after the death of her mother. 
In the 1930‟s she courageously enrolled in college, paying for it on her own, defeating the 
odds, and even fibbing her age so she would be accepted. As a woman in engineering I hope 
she can see some of herself in me as I do.

ABSTRACT 
 
Medical ultrasound has shown great potential as a minimally invasive therapy 
technique. It can be used in areas such as histotripsy, thermal ablation, and administering 
medication. The success of these therapies is improved by the cavitation of microbubbles.  
This study evaluated the effect of varying the pressure amplitude on cavitation resonance 
frequency and the corresponding bubble size at therapeutic field levels. Other research 
indicated that the resonance size depends on pressure amplitude; however, that investigation 
only considered pressure amplitudes up to 1 MPa [MacDonald et al. (2004)]. Our study was 
conducted by simulating the response of air bubbles in water to linearly propagating sine 
waves using the Gilmore-Akulichev formulation to solve for the bubble response. The 
frequency of the sine wave varied from 0.5 to 5 MHz while the amplitude of the sine wave 
varied from 0.0001 to 5 MPa. The optimal seed size for a particular frequency of excitation 
and amplitude, which is normally only established for stable cavitation, was defined in our 
study as the initial bubble size that resulted in the maximum bubble expansion prior to bubble 
radius dropping below its initial radius. The simulations demonstrated a downshift in 
resonance size with increasing pressure amplitude. Therefore, at therapeutic levels, smaller 
bubbles can have a more dramatic response to ultrasound than larger bubbles.

CHAPTER ONE: OVERVIEW 
 
The minds of engineers come in many varieties as can be seen in the complexity of 
subdivisions in each field.  The beauty lies in the multitude of ways engineers can improve 
life for the current human race and those generations thereafter, including their capacity to 
further medical science.  Second only to heart disease, cancer claims the most lives of United 
States men and women, with cancer related deaths climbing over half a million each year 
since 2006 [1]. In 2009 1.5 million Americans are projected to be diagnosed with cancer. The 
cancer cases affecting at least 25% of women and men are breast and prostate, respectively.  
A goal of engineers is to treat this disease by developing fortifying technology to make cancer 
treatment more accessible, successful, and less painful. Acoustic wave therapy can 
accomplish these goals, especially when targeted at the soft tissue.   
 
The use of sound waves entered the medical community in the middle of the twentieth 
century. Most commonly it is used in obstetrics to view the development of the fetus.  This is 
a diagnostic ultrasound example where the transducer is used to view the uterus during 
pregnancy. Diagnostic ultrasound has also been used for real-time imaging for guidance 
during surgical procedures. More recently the use of ultrasound has been accepted in 
therapeutic applications in addition to diagnostic applications. Minimally invasive procedures 
such as kidney stone treatment using a high intensity focused, know as shock wave therapy, 
ultrasound transducer and simple procedures such as heating joints and administering 
medications have been accepted by the Federal Drug Administration and are regularly 
employed. These procedures are generalized as therapeutic ultrasound.  Kidney stones are 
broken up by using focused high-pressure sound waves; this process is termed lithotripsy. It is 

2 
 
safe, non-surgical, outpatient procedure because the acoustic shock waves are able to pass 
through the skin and soft tissue without significant damage.  Physical therapists often use 
ultrasound as a treatment mechanism to stimulate blood flow in certain areas as well as using 
a topical medication and letting the acoustic waves carry it beyond the skin surface into the 
muscles and joints.  
This research group, headed by principal investigator Dr. Timothy Bigelow, has been 
funded to explore advances in the field of high intensity focused ultrasound therapy, 
specifically, for cancer treatment of soft tissue organs. The research studies a new technique 
that has been developed using pulsed high intensity focused ultrasound, called histotripsy. 
Histotripsy‟s function can be identified in its root words. The Greek word „histo‟ means body 
tissue and the word „tripsy‟ translates into crush, grind, or break down. This procedure does 
breakdown unwanted body tissue into sub cellular structures by using microbubble cavitation 
induced in an ultrasonic field [2].  This process aims to destroy cells without damaging 
surrounding tissue similar to previously mentioned therapy procedures. Focused ultrasound 
energy passes through layers of skin, fat, muscles and overlaying soft tissue organs to reach its 
target without affecting those layers. The histotripsy research is motivated in part by thermal 
ablation, which is another focused ultrasound technique that uses heat to damage tissue cells. 
Histotripsy is an alternative to traditional, invasive surgery requiring scalpels and suctions and 
would reduce a patient‟s pain, cost, and recovery time if successfully developed and accepted 
by the medical community.

1.1 Background Therapeutic Ultrasound Work 
For years ultrasound has shown remarkable potential as a tool for minimally invasive 
therapy.  Recently, ultrasound thermal ablation of tissue has successfully treated some 
neoplasia and uterine fibroids [8].  The procedure uses the energy in the ultrasound waves to 
heat and kill targeted tissue and has been extensively studied [9, 10, 11]. In addition to killing 
the tissue, ultrasound therapies are being successfully developed to enhance thrombolysis 
[12], improve drug and gene delivery [13], control bleeding and hemorrhaging from severe 
trauma [11], erode or liquefy tissue [2, 3,14, 15] and destroy bacteria biofilms [16]. Many of 
these developing therapies have been found to depend upon or be significantly enhanced by 
the cavitation of microbubbles.  Therefore, it is critical to understand the interaction of 
microbubbles with high intensity sound waves. Fully understanding the interaction will better 
ensure effective ultrasound therapy.  
 
1.2 Background Histotripsy Work 
 
High intensity focused ultrasound has been used in medicine to thermally ablate 
unwanted lesions. As with most medical procedures, there is risk involved and a goal should 
be to minimize the risk. Thermal ablation uses continuous ultrasound waves that can be 
focused to accurately locate and damage unwanted tissue with excessive heat. An approach 
using repetitive, very short pulses of high intensity controlled ultrasound has given promising 
preliminary results for tissue erosion [3]. The complex tissue and microbubble interaction in 
the focal region of the ultrasound beam gives rise to cavitation in the soft tissue region. The 

4 
 
intricate cavitation process produces mechanical damage resulting from extreme expansion 
and collapse of the oscillating microbubbles giving rise to microjets that shred the tissue into 
sub cellular fragments. Therapeutic tissue damage using histotripsy is largely based on the 
ability to induce, control, and manipulate microbubbles internally.  
 
In the past decade new discoveries involving histotripsy research have been made. In 
this work the primary focus was targeted to perforate the left atrial septum of a newborn child 
diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome [4]. Either tissue removal via reconstructive 
surgery or a heart transplant is required for the neonates to live beyond two weeks after 
discovering this birth defect. Using ultrasound to erode the unwanted tissue was the goal of 
these studies. Porcine atrial wall samples submerged in a distilled, degassed water bath were 
exposed using a single element focused ultrasound transducer [3]. During these experiments 
many well defined holes were created in the tissue due to the cavitating microbubbles created 
by the high intensity ultrasound pulses. Since these initial histotripsy trials, varieties of the 
technique have been developed including transducer frequency, alignment, and pressure 
amplitudes of the acoustic wave [4].  More important than the multitudes of techniques that 
can be used to produce histotripsy is the actual desired effect, cavitation of microbubbles. The 
oscillating microbubble has complexities during the histotripsy process. If better understood, 
desired effects can be maximized to use ultrasound for surgeries including hypoplastic left 
heart syndrome and soft tissue neoplasia in the abdomen.

1.3 Background Cavitation Work 
 
For hundreds of years scientists have noted interesting phenomena, referring to 
cavitation, but could not define it until the late 1800‟s due to the small order of magnitude at 
which the effects were occurring [5]. Cavitation is the expansion and collapse of a gas filled 
bubble in fluid. Acoustic cavitation is this same expansion and collapse of a gas bubble in 
fluid with the addition of an acoustic field.  Previous research on bubble dynamics evolved 
from the equation of motion concerning the bubble, liquid and the pressure the system is 
under [6]. The equation of motion remains the building block for the complexity of the 
microbubble during the cavitation process.  
 
The dependence of the frequency and the bubble size has always been a theoretical 
base for bubble formulations as well. This dependence can be derived from the equation of 
motion and has been used as a reference for many bubble formulations involving cavitation 
[7].  In previous works there has been some exploration of the bubble size relating to the 
frequency and pressure amplitude, seen in Flynn and Church [38]. In this work a dependency 
was shown relating both pressure amplitude and frequency for the normalized bubble size 
(maximum expansion to initial radius.) Flynn and Church show plots holding the pressure 
amplitude at a fixed state able to achieve cavitation (5 MPa) and vary the frequency from 0.1 
to 10 MHz. As the frequency decreases the initial bubble size that gives the largest response 
increases. This result is expected by referencing the inverse relationship of bubble size and 
frequency [7, 21]. Their work then held the frequency constant and varied the pressure 
amplitude from 0.5 MPa to 5 MPa. These plots show that during the initial cycle the initial 
radius does not respond unstably until 2 MPa. These initial plots give a great reference for the 

6 
 
work completed in this work. The improvement was searching for a specific optimal seed size 
to achieve the greatest maximum collapse. Having these specific values for each frequency 
and pressure amplitude may lead to a better understanding of cavitation nuclei in biological 
tissue.  
 
1.4 Research Objective  
 
The ultimate goal of this research was to advance the use of histotripsy for soft tissue 
cancer treatment. Considering the background research and tools available, the general goal of 
the research was to develop a histotripsy system and to improve the system or procedure. The 
specific objective was to complete theoretical computations gaining knowledge to improve the 
excitation relationship between the oscillating microbubble and the undesired cancerous cells.  
 
The quest for optimum damage to undesired cells via cavitation depends on many 
factors, some can be controlled and others cannot. The controllable factors would include the 
frequency of the therapy transducer, the size of the microbubble, and the pressure amplitude 
of the driving sound waves.  The theoretical computations are aimed at optimizing the three 
controllable factors of the system, to achieve the most damage to the target tissues in the least 
amount of time. Given a range of frequencies the objective was to find corresponding bubble 
sizes at specific pressure amplitudes that would, in the future, optimize the physical system 
for histotripsy.  
 
In this thesis, the response of a spherically symmetric air bubble in an unbounded 
water media to ultrasound waves was simulated. The goal was to determine how the 

7 
 
maximum bubble response depended on ultrasound frequency and bubble size for pressure 
amplitudes at therapeutic levels. The hypothesis was that as the pressure amplitude increased, 
the bubble size that resulted in the maximum response for a specific ultrasound frequency 
(i.e., optimal seed  size) would decrease. Existing research shows a decrease in resonance 
size with increasing pressure [7], but that work only considered pressures less than 1 MPa, 
well below the acoustic pressures used to induce inertial cavitation in biomedical 
applications. These pressures have occurred up to 20 MPa.  For the purposes of this study, 
the optimal seed size was defined as the initial bubble size that results in the greatest bubble 
expansion relative to the initial size prior to the bubble radius falling below the initial radius 
(i.e., first collapse).  
1.5 Thesis Organization 
 
This document contains the descriptive research procedure. Theoretical background 
research was completed; experiments were conducted using ex vivo tissue which corresponds 
to theoretical cavitation work; and mathematical models were shown using Matlab to further 
understand and improve the theoretical knowledge regarding microbubble response given 
preset input parameters. This thesis also contains an analysis of the simulation results and 
projected future work.

CHAPTER TWO: THEORY 
2.1 Rectified Diffusion 
 
In order for acoustic cavitation to occur, small gas bubbles must develop in a liquid. In 
general, a small gas bubble would likely diffuse into the surrounding liquid unless acted upon 
by an external force, such as an acoustic field. The sound field counteracts the normal process 
and at some threshold pressure will cause gas to diffuse into, instead of out of, the bubble. The 
increase of gas into the bubbles causes the bubble radius to grow in size; this process has been 
coined “rectified diffusion.” [6] The rate of gas diffusion in a liquid is proportional to the 
concentration gradient of dissolved gas. As the bubble radius increases the concentration 
gradient also increases which causes an influx of gas molecules.  
 
To mathematically explain the dynamics of a gas bubble in liquid the equation of 
motion is the building block. The Eq. 1 shown below refers to the motion of the bubble radius. 
It is assumed that the liquid properties are constant, the bubble remains spherical in shape, and 
that the acoustic wavelength is much larger than the diameter of the gas bubble.

In Eq. 1, R represents the radius of the bubble, ρ is the density of the liquid, 
 is the 
pressure of the gas inside the bubble, σ is the surface tension, 
 is the hydrostatic pressure in 
the liquid, and 
 is the driving force of the acoustic field. Flick‟s law of mass 
transfer is the equation used to demonstrate gas diffusion in and out of the bubble, shown in 

9 
 
Eq. 2. The concentration inside the gas bubble is assumed to be a constant; therefore, the 
diffusion refers to the surrounding liquid.

In Eq. 2  c represents the concentration of the gas in the liquid, v is the velocity of the liquid 
and D is the diffusion constant. The diffusion equation and the equation of motion are 
dependent on one another through the velocity and change in concentration term in Eq. 2 as 
well as the 
 in Eq. 1. Epstein and Plesset [17] treated this problem by setting the gas 
bubble at rest in an infinite liquid; they found the rate of change for the number of gas moles 
in the bubble shown by Eq. 3. In Eq. 3, 
 is the initial uniform concentration of the gas 
(concentration at infinity) and 
 is the concentration of gas in the liquid at the bubble wall 
[17].

If these formulations were to be useful to realistic processes, such as cavitation, a dynamic 
form must be solved. The derivation assumes that the bubble undergoes spherical and 
symmetrical motion only and there is negligible diffusion during a single oscillation of the 
gas bubble. The second assumption can be made due to diminutive diffusion occurring 
during an extremely fast oscillation. The general equation, developed by Eller and Flynn [6], 
for the flux of gas into the bubble can be seen in Eq. 4 where 
 is the equilibrium radius.

In the above equations 
is the period of the bubble,  is the radius of the bubble changing 
with time, and 
 is the saturation concentration of the gas in liquid. The derivation of 
equations four through seven are seen in Appendix A.  
 
To achieve rectified diffusion the pressure of the sound field must reach and exceed a 
certain pressure threshold. The threshold occurs at the moment the average diffusion is zero, 
and as the pressure is increased the concentration of gas in the bubble, 
, also increases 
which causes the bubble to grow in size. For frequencies used in therapy procedures, the 
diffusion pressure threshold can be illustrated using the ratio of concentrations shown below:

The functions A and B depend on the bubble size over time found by using the equation of 
motion. The pressure threshold dependent variables end up being the pressure amplitude of 

11 
 
the incoming sound wave PA, the radius of the bubble, R, and the frequency of the acoustic 
wave, ω. 
 
2.2 Bubble Dynamics 
 
Small bubble oscillations have been difficult to model. In order to obtain a direct 
formulation for bubble dynamics, assumptions had to be made. There have been three 
prominent models for small bubble oscillation; Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Herring, and the 
Gilmore model; two of which are directly correlated to the equations used for the 
mathematical computations in this thesis. The Rayleigh-Plesset model assumes the velocity 
of sound is infinite in liquid; the Herring model improves by assuming the velocity is a finite 
constant; and the Gilmore model allows the sound speed to vary depending on the specific 
liquid in which the bubble is oscillating [18]. These three formulations for a bubble 
oscillating in an acoustic field are all accredited, and used by many for different specialties in 
the field.  
 
Rayleigh [19] was the pioneer in mathematically modeling the dynamic behavior of 
bubbles. Since his first published work in 1917, small improvements have been made on the 
original equation by Plesset [20] and Glimore [21].  The problem was solved for the collapse 
of a gas bubble in a significantly larger body of liquid. By ignoring the surface tension of the 
bubble and the viscosity the bubble boundary changing with time was solved by means of the 
momentum equation.

Eq. 9 shows change in radius as dependent on ρ, P∞, and P(R) which are the liquid density, 
pressure of the liquid at infinity, and the pressure of the liquid at the bubble boundary. Eq. 9 
became the well-known Rayleigh-Plesset equation by simply adding the surface tension and 
viscosity effects as shown in Eq. 10.

The derivation to the Rayleigh-Plesset equation using an energy balance approach is in 
Appendix B.  
 
Gilmore [21] further improved this method. The Gilmore equation advances beyond 
the others by having capabilities for higher pressure fields. Additionally, it was presented in a 
form that could be computed to produce a large number of results in a reasonable amount of 
time. Gilmore [21] begins with the conservation of momentum regarding the vector velocity 
of a spherical bubble as it grows and collapses. A derivation of the Gilmore equation, shown 
in Eq. 11, is in Appendix C.

Although the Keller-Herrring equation is not used directly in the simulation 
computations, it is used to reference what the linear approximated resonant frequency would 
be at low pressure amplitudes. Eq. 12 is shown below in terms of pressure with β as an 
arbitrary parameter between 0< β<1 and P(t) the pressure in the liquid at the bubble wall.

2.3 Cavitation 
Cavitation is the response of gas bubbles in liquid after oscillating to an acoustic 
field. There are two specific types; stable and inertial cavitation. Stable cavitation is the 
relatively small oscillations of the bubble‟s radius about its equilibrium radius. These 
oscillations may generate microstreaming in the vicinity of the bubble leading to improved 
sonoporation, but otherwise have little effect on the tissue. The amplitude of the oscillations 
during stable cavitation experiences a resonance that depends on the size of the bubble and 
frequency of the sound. When a bubble is driven at its resonant frequency it reaches higher 
oscillation amplitudes and will provide more effective therapy. The resonance frequency for 
a particular bubble size also depends on the ambient pressure, surface tension, and the liquid 
density. When measuring the resonance response during stable cavitation, numerous acoustic 
cycles are often needed to allow the transient behavior of the dynamic system to fade.

Inertial cavitation is the dramatic expansion and violent collapse of the gas bubble 
that occurs at higher acoustic pressure levels. During inertial cavitation the bubble expands to 
many times its original size and collapses violently causing microjets that can shred tissue. 
Inertial cavitation occurs over a small number of acoustic cycles, usually three or less, before 
the collapse takes place. Therefore, it is more difficult to determine the resonance 
size/frequency for a bubble undergoing inertial cavitation because numerous acoustic cycles 
cannot be used to remove the impact of other transients in the dynamic system.

CHAPTER THREE: SIMULATIONS 
 
 
This chapter will discuss the reason for simulating bubble behavior in an ultrasound 
field, programming code, mathematics used, and the justification for a new definition of 
optimal seed size.  
 
3.1 Simulation Motivation and Code 
 
To better understand bubble activity the numerical computing system, MATLAB was 
used. To have an idea about what is happening to a bubble on the micron order of magnitude a 
computing system was necessary. The original code was written in Fortran by Dr. Charles 
Church. After the code was converted to be read using the MATLAB system other 
modifications were made. The code was written to calculate the response of bubbles to a sine 
wave. The phase of the acoustic pressure in the programming code was initially set to be 
negative; in order to compensate for this a negative pressure value was entered to achieve 
reasonable results. The modified code had nineteen initial inputs that remained constant 
throughout each simulation. These constants were defined as P(2) through P(20) and are  in 
Appendix E section C.1 with the rest of the attached code.  
 
As can be seen in the list of constants, the simulations involved a single air bubble in 
water. The variables were pressure amplitude and frequency The search function, shown in 
Appendix C part C.2, was written to scan initial bubble sizes searching for the maximum 
expansion relative to the initial size, prior to when the bubble dropped below its initial size.  

16 
 
Finding this optimal seed size was the primary goal of the simulations.  Our optimal seed size 
was also used to find the maximum bubble expansion relative to the initial size over 50 
acoustic cycles or until the initial radius dropped below one tenth its initial size (neglecting 
bubble fragmentation and assuming rebound). The simulations found the optimal seed size for 
pressure amplitudes of 100 Pa to 5 MPa for acoustic frequencies of 1, 3, and 5 MHz.  These 
pressures and frequencies were selected based on their relevance to therapeutic ultrasound.   
 
3.2 New Definition of Optimal Seed Size 
 
The traditional definition of resonance size stems from a relationship between the 
frequency of the acoustic waves and the bubble radius in the acoustic field. A bubble at the 
resonance size for a particular frequency would undergo maximum changes to its radius when 
excited at that frequency once any transient behavior of the dynamic system has subsided. The 
oscillations for bubbles of a different size would be less than the oscillations at the resonance 
size.  The relationship between resonance frequency and resonance size for low level acoustic 
excitations is given by the following equation:

In Eq. 12 Γ is the polytropic exponent of the encapsulated gas in the microbubble and Ro is 
the initial bubble radius [7] . A derivation for this is in Appendix D starting with Eq. 11, the 
Keller-Herring equation of bubble dynamics.  

17 
 
 
While this traditional definition of resonance size works well for stable cavitation 
applications, resonance size is impossible to define when inertial cavitation is present.  When 
undergoing inertial cavitation a single bubble would typically undergo one expansion prior to 
a violent collapse, which would leave the bubble in fragments.  Furthermore, even if the 
bubble did not fragment and the bubble radius rebounded for many cycles, the bubble‟s 
response would not be periodic as is illustrated in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1(a) shows a bubble 
undergoing stable cavitation while Figure 3.1(b) shows a bubble undergoing inertial 
cavitation and rebound as simulated in our study.  The transient behavior in Figure 3.1(a) 
passes after about 5 to 10 acoustic cycles, leaving a periodic sinusoidal oscillation while the 
oscillations in Figure 3.1(b) never exhibit any periodicity even out to 50 acoustic cycles.  
Therefore, it is impossible to “wait” until the transient behavior of the system has subsided 
when determining a resonance size/frequency for a bubble undergoing inertial cavitation.  
For this reason, a modified definition of resonance size was used in our study. 
 
 

18 
 
 
Figure 3.1: A bubble undergoing stable cavitation is shown in part (a). The simulated bubble was 
driven at 1 MHz and 1 kPa. The bubble oscillation shown in (b) was driven at the same frequency, 1 
MHz but with a higher pressure amplitude, 1 MPa. Both plots show the radius normalized to the initial 
radius.  
 
When determining a resonance response for inertial cavitation, we defined the 
optimal seed size for a particular acoustic frequency as the initial bubble size that resulted in 
the largest bubble expansion prior to when the size of the bubble dropped below its initial 
size (i.e., first collapse).  This definition avoids the complication of bubble fragmentation that 
would alter the bubble size while still providing some guidance to inertial cavitation based 
therapies.  For consistency, this definition was used throughout the entire range of pressure 
amplitudes rather than just for amplitudes where inertial cavitation was expected.  Our new 
definition for optimal seed size does not generally give the same size as the traditional 
definition even for smaller excitation pressures inducing stable bubble oscillations as is 
illustrated in Table 3.1.

optimal seed size developed to study the relationship between bubble size and frequency at higher 
pressure amplitudes. 
 
 
Table 3.1 shows both the traditional/theoretical resonance size and the new optimal 
seed size found under our new definition.  The traditional size was found from Eq. 11 while 
the new size was found via computer simulations for a pressure amplitude of 100 Pa.  The 
new optimal seed size is approximately the same as the traditional size for 3 and 5 MHz, but 
differs significantly at the lower frequencies.  This difference can be attributed to variations 
in the transient behavior of the microbubble system as is illustrated in Figures, 3.2-3.5.

bubble.

bubble. 
 
Figures 3.2 and 3.3 for the 0.5 MHz and 1 MHz cases, show within the initial cycle that the 
simulated optimal seed size has a slightly larger peak value than the theoretical resonance 
size. After the transients subside, however, the peaks level out smaller than the theoretical 
resonance peaks. The theoretical cycles continue to increase until reaching steady state with 
peaks approximately five times greater than the new optimal seed sizes. In Figures 3.4 and 
3.5, however, which corresponds to the 3 and 5 MHz cases, the initial transient behavior of 
the theoretical and new optimal seed sizes are nearly identical.

In these equations, C is the speed of sound at the bubble wall and is calculated from the

and the pressure at the bubble wall, P(R).  These pressures are given by:

The Gilmore-Akulichev formulation was selected for the study because it is capable 
of calculating the response of a bubble at higher acoustic pressures (prior to bubble 
fragmentation) without requiring the complexity and computational cost of three dimensional 

24 
 
models of bubble dynamics.  Other models such as Rayleigh-Plesset or Keller-Herring, while 
popular with simulating bubble dynamics for contrast agent and some drug delivery studies 
[7, 24, 25, 26, 27], are not valid when the bubble expands more than several times its initial 
radius [28].  In addition, three-dimensional models are not required since the bubble is 
oscillating in isolation in an unbounded fluid (symmetric collapse), and the research was only 
interested in bubble behavior prior to the inertial collapse when bubble fragmentation is 
likely.  The problem was further simplified by assuming that the ultrasound waves were not 
corrupted by nonlinear propagation distortion so that the acoustic excitation only had a single 
frequency (i.e., no harmonics or sub-harmonics).

CHAPTER FOUR: SIMULATION RESULTS 
4.1: DEPENDENCE ON OPTIMAL SEED SIZE 
The dependence of optimal seed size as a function of pressure amplitude is shown in 
Figures 4.1-4.4. It is clear from these Figures that with increasing pressure amplitude there 
will be a reduction in the resonance bubble size.  They also show the maximum expansion 
relative to the initial size when the simulations are allowed to continue over 50 cycles or until 
the initial size dropped below one tenth its initial size.  The maximum expansion of the 
bubbles also appears to increase dramatically as the optimal seed size of the bubble 
decreases.  Therefore, the drop in optimal seed size probably correlates with the onset of 
inertial cavitation. 

26 
 
 
Figure 4.1: The plots correspond to 0.5 MHz frequency. The top graph (a) represents a decrease in 
bubble size as the pressure increases and the bottom graph (b) corresponds to the maximum 
expansion relative to initial size.  
 

27 
 
 
Figure 4.2: The plots correspond to 1 MHz frequency. The top graph (a) represents a decrease in 
bubble size as the pressure increases and the bottom graph (b) corresponds to the maximum 
expansion relative to initial size.

Figure 4.3: The plots correspond to 3 MHz frequency. The top graph (a) represents a decrease in 
bubble size as the pressure increases and the bottom graph (b) corresponds to the maximum 
expansion relative to initial size.

bubble size as the pressure increases and the bottom graph (b) corresponds to the maximum 
expansion relative to initial size.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

30 
 
4.2: Pressure Threshold 
 
To better understand these results, the pressure threshold corresponding to the 
dramatic drop in optimal seed size and the dramatic increase in expansion were determined 
for each frequency.  The threshold values were determined by first fitting lines to the last 
three points in each plot for optimal seed  size and also for the maximum expansion.  These 
four points corresponded to pressure amplitudes of 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 MPa.  The pressure 
threshold was then given as the pressure amplitude where this line intercepted the optimal 
seed size (dashed line) and the expansion sizes (solid line) at low excitation levels (i.e., 100 
Pa) The pressure threshold values for all four frequencies for both resonance size and 
expansion are shown in Figure 4.5. 
 

31 
 
 
Figure 4.5:  The pressure threshold in Pascals for frequencies of 0.5 through 5 MHz for both the 
dramatic reduction in optimal seed size and the dramatic increase in maximum expansion.  
 
The pressure threshold corresponding to the dramatic drop in optimal seed size with pressure 
increases linearly with frequency, similar to what has been observed for inertial cavitation 
thresholds in other research [29]. Also, the threshold for the dramatic drop in resonance size 
is the same as the threshold for the dramatic increase in expansion indicating both effects 
have the same cause.

CHAPTER FIVE: EXPERIMENTS USING Ex Vivo PORCINE LIVER 
 
To parallel the theoretical work and potential clinical application my work involved 
handling and performing experiments using ex vivo bovine and porcine liver. This section will 
discuss how the tissue was prepared, the workings of the experimental set-up used, and the 
results of the completed experiments. 
5.1 Tissue Preparation 
 
Choosing a soft abdominal tissue was done to make the transition from ex vivo to in 
vivo easier. As sound travels through various media it is more difficult to control the 
properties of the acoustic wave, leading to the possibility that those properties may change 
once they reach the target. Attenuation, absorption, and scattering will all occur when the 
sound source crosses the various barriers of the body. Parenchymatous abdominal organs have 
fewer acoustic interfaces making it a good starting point for ultrasound therapy. Using a soft 
tissue organ ex vivo would increase the likelihood of successfully repeating the experiment in 
vivo.  
 
Both bovine and porcine liver were tested in the system. Initially bovine was used. 
Due to the size of a single liver it was challenging to dismantle the organ into pieces suitable 
for the experiment that sought to simulate the size and properties of a human liver. Also, the 
time between which the liver was removed from the animal and used in the experiment was a 
critical factor. The longer the organ is ex vivo the less realistic it becomes and the less useful 
the tests results then would be. A transition to porcine liver was made that improved all 
aspects of tissue preparation. The porcine provided a smaller liver and one that had more 

33 
 
characteristics to human tissue. Normal porcine liver contains five usable lobes. One lobe is a 
suitable size for an experiment that can be prepared simply by cutting a lobe from the organ 
and cleaning it under running water for at least five minutes to prevent excess blood in the 
experimental system.  
 
In initial trials the tissue sample was placed in a small vacuum sealed plastic wrap 
prior to use. The plastic, though thin, was later revealed to have a negative effect of the 
alignment process of the source as well as possibly interfering with the therapy. The vacuum 
sealed plastic was discarded and the tissue went straight from cleaning into the experimental 
apparatus. This step did improve the accuracy of the alignment as well as results. The final 
tissue preparation improvement was to place the clean single lobe into a cylindrical gas 
chamber submerged in distilled water. The degassing of the tissue removed air bubbles 
accrued during exposure time between the harvesting, packaging and cleaning. This removal 
of air bubbles drastically improved results during the experiments. This also correlates to in 
vivo cases much more than tissue with accumulated gaseous bubbles. In the human body gas 
bubbles do not occur naturally.  
 
 
5.2 Experimental Apparatus 
 
Apparatus for the ex vivo tissue experiments consisted of a waveform generator, an 
amplifier, a matching network, and a single ultrasound transducer. To locate objects using the 
transducers a pulse echo was sent into the matching network and the reflections were 
monitored by an oscilloscope. The transducer is operated by a precise, three dimensional 

34 
 
motion system controlled manually or by a computer. The transducer is submerged into a 
water bath placed below the controlled motion system. The water bath fills a 20x20x10 
plexiglas tank. The tissue sample is placed on the floor of this tank to be treated by the 
system.  
 
The waveform generation can be an arbitrary sine wave, but the setting cannot, in this 
specific set-up. Two types of waveform generators were used to treat the tissue samples in 
these experiments: a computer card and an arbitrary generator by Agilent 33220A. The 
Agilent generator does not depend on the reliability of the computer or the program that 
controls it, LabView. These factors make using a arbitrary generator a more reliable choice. 
To achieve the tissue damage by histotripsy the generator was set to emit a sine wave with 
eight hundred and fifty volts peak-to-peak. This was the voltage limitation due to the power 
amplifier. The period cycle was five milliseconds, a twenty second pulse with a duty cycle of 
3.6%.  
 
The amplifier used was made by E&I Ltd., model number 1140LA-CI. It is a 
broadband solid state amplifier covering the frequency range of 100 KHz to 3MHz. Over 
1500 Watts can be produced and it has a 55 dB gain. The main limitation with this amplifier is 
that its input voltage must be 1.0 Volts RMS to ensure no damage will be done to the 
amplifier.  
 
The output of the amplifier is connected to the matching network and then the 
ultrasound transducer. The matching network was manufactured specifically for each 1.1 
MHz ultrasound source. The sources are focused and concave used singly. Transducers 58 and 
59 are used with no preference or limitations to either one. The focal lengths were tested in 

35 
 
the water bath using a single wire. The difference between the two transducers were slight, but 
found in the focal lengths. Transducer 58 had a focal length of approximately 64.064 mm and 
Transducer 59 focused at 64.351mm.  
 
To locate the reflections a Panametics pulser module model number 5900 was used. It 
sends in a pulse/echo using a 200 Hz PRF, 32 J of energy, with the sampling at 50 Ohms, a 
high pass filter of 1 MHz and a low pass filter of 50 MHz. The attenuation was set to 35.5 dB 
and the gain was 40 dB. These settings gave a clear signal of the pulse and the echoes off the 
different surfaces, such as the top of the tissue, bottom of tissue and the plexiglas tank. Using 
these echoes as well as the knowledge of the transducer focal lengths, the focus can be set to 
wherever the desired region inside the tissue sample. After the source has been aligned using 
the pulse/echo method the connections were reattached and the wave generator sent the sine 
wave into the amplifier which reached the sample through the transducer. To monitor the area 
treated by the system the three dimension motion controller holding the transducer was given 
a preset grid to scan. The settings were input in LabView. These settings are up to the 
controller‟s discretion depending of the area to be treated. The time spend on each spot can 
also be controlled. The longer the step pause the more probable damage to the tissue at that 
particular point. In the experiments performed the step pause was always set to one minute. 
The experimental set up can be seen in Figure 5.1, and Figure 5.2 shows an enlarged view of 
the transducer and tissue.

tissue. The transducer cord is attached to a matching network that receives the amplified wave from 
the RF amplifier.

tissue as the high pressure amplitude sound wave works on dissipating a well in the middle. 
 
 
 
5.3 Experimental Results 
 
The results depended greatly on the equipment used and how the tissue had been 
prepared. When the E&I amplifier was purchased the source was given enough voltage to 
destroy the tissue. Prior to this amplifier being employed, some discolorations were seen, but 
there was no dissipation of tissue; therefore, no histotripsy was occurring. The likely outcome 
was some light thermal ablation. Secondly, degassing the porcine tissue sample also greatly 
increased the results of the experiment that is histotripsy could be seen in the tissue with the 
naked eye. The damage looked like multi pinpoint foci. In the first case, shown in Figure F.3, 
the damage done is significant but not as applicable because the water bath used was not 

38 
 
degassed water. This caused the bubble interaction on the top of the tissue to create a trench. 
Although exciting, the parameters are not realistic for a typical situation considering bubbles 
do not occur naturally in humans. Figure three shows another trench inside the tissue sample. 
This achievement was much more encouraging because the parameters were ideal and the 
damage was done inside the sample, which would be applicable to a real life scenario.

CHAPTER SIX: DISCUSSION 
 
In my research, a single, spherical air bubble in water was simulated mimicking the 
response it would have in an ultrasonic field. The bubble displayed oscillations when driven 
at therapeutic pressure levels. Given the ultrasound frequency and bubble size, the goal was 
to establish how the maximum bubble response was dependent on these parameters. It was 
proposed that the optimal seed size of the bubble for any given ultrasound frequency would 
decrease as the pressure amplitude increased. The optimal seed size was defined as the 
bubble size that resulted in the largest expansion prior to the bubble radius decreasing to 
below its original size, which occurred in one cycle. Using this definition, the optimal seed 
size was used to simulate bubble responses over fifty cycles or until the bubble drops below 
one tenth its initial size and the maximum expansion relative to the initial size was found. 
Results have shown that as the pressure amplitude increases beyond some threshold, the 
optimal seed size of the bubble decreases, confirming our hypothesis. In addition, the 
maximum expansion of the bubble dramatically increases at the same threshold pressure. 
This pressure threshold is linearly dependent on frequency and is probably due to the onset of 
inertial cavitation that has been shown to increase linearly with frequency [29]. 
Considering the simulations demonstrated a downshift in resonance size with 
increasing pressure amplitude, the hypothesis was made that smaller bubbles can have a more 
dramatic response to therapeutic ultrasound than larger bubbles.  To further explore this 
possibility, the initial bubble size was varied about the optimal seed size found previously, 
and the maximum expansion relative to the initial size was determined for a 1 MHz 100 Pa 

41 
 
(Figure 6.1(a)) and for a 5 MPa (Figure 6.1(b)) sinusoidal excitation. The peak shown in 
Figure 6.1(a) corresponds to the theoretical resonance size while the peak in Figure 6.1(b) 
corresponds to the optimal seed size that the search function revealed. These scaled input 
values support that smaller bubbles would have a more dramatic effect in therapeutic 
applications. The plots also show that as the pressure amplitude increases for the system the 
resonance peaks change shape. In the lower pressure amplitude case shown in Figure 5.1(a) 
the resonance peak is narrow while in the high pressure amplitude case the optimal seed peak 
is much broader. This indicates that at higher pressure levels it is less critical to use bubbles 
at resonance size to achieve results. The resonance peak at higher amplitudes is also 
asymmetric indicating that the bubbles less than optimal seed size will not respond 
independent of the pressure amplitude of the acoustic wave. 

42 
 
 
Figure 6.1:  A range of initial radii is shown on a log scale normalized with respect to the theoretical 
resonance size 3.704 microns (a) and the simulated optimal seed size 2.9932 microns (b.) The 
maximum expansion of these radii is shown on a linear scale, also normalized with respect to each 
individual input. The frequency was 1 MHz and the pressure amplitude was 100 Pa. 
 
While the results can provide some insight into the resonance behavior of bubbles, or 
technique did have several limitations.  First, bubble to bubble interaction can impact 
resonance behavior [30, 31] and in this study a single bubble was tested. In reality a large 
number of bubbles would be present. Many factors arise when dealing with numerous 
bubbles such as the spacing between the bubbles, bubble size, and asymmetric coupled 
collapse of the bubbles. Another possible limitation would be the assumptions made of the 

43 
 
bubble during its expansion and collapse. For example, the bubble‟s surface tension remained 
constant throughout the simulations. While this assumption is true for larger bubbles, it may 
not be true for smaller ones. However, surface tension has been shown to be constant for 
nanoscale bubbles [32]. A reason the research did not consider testing higher pressures was 
that the physics might change as the bubble size continued to drop. This is an unfortunate 
limitation considering higher pressure amplitudes, up to 20 MPa,  would have greater 
applicability in some applications such as ultrasound histotripsy [4, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. 
Nonlinear propagation also affects the system and its unaccountability limits our model, and 
as noted, we used only linear acoustic waves to excite the bubbles. Nonlinear distortion of 
the wave would be present especially at the higher pressure amplitudes. Nonlinear distortion 
will result in an asymmetric waveform with the peak compressional pressure becoming 
significantly larger than the peak rarefractional pressure. At even higher pressures, shock 
waves can also appear in the waveform. Due to the nonlinear nature of bubble dynamics, 
nonlinear distortion/shock formation is likely to have an impact on the bubble response as 
well.      
A look at the frequency dependence on size was also an area of interest during the 
study. Previous works [6, 7] have noted a strong inverse dependency between frequency and 
resonant bubble size; as the frequency increases the bubble size decreases. This phenomenon 
can be clearly seen in Figure 6.2 at the left hand side of the graph. The interesting and new 
effect was seen at high pressure amplitudes. As the pressure increased the bubble becomes 
more dependent on the pressure than on the frequency. This shift begins at pressure 
amplitudes where transient cavitation starts to occur. The conclusion is that at higher pressure 

44 
 
amplitudes where inertial cavitation occurs the active bubbles are less dependent on the 
frequency of excitation. 
 
Figure 6.2: Plot shows bubble behavior under four frequencies: 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 MHz. The strong 
frequency dependence decreases as the pressure amplitude reaches levels where inertial cavitation 
occurs.

APPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF RAYLEIGH-PLESSET EQUATION IN TERMS 
OF BUBBLE RADIUS 
 
 
The Rayleigh-Plesset equation is an addition to the Rayleigh [18] equation taking into 
account the surface tension and viscosity. The derivation for the equation will be completed 
making the same assumptions that the gas bubble is spherical in shape and has a wavelength 
sufficient for rectified diffusion. The bubble will also be submerged in a sizable liquid with 
an acoustic field acting upon it as an external force.  
 
The liquid incompressibility cause the velocity to fall off as an inverse square law 
which gives a relationship between the velocity u(r,t), the bubble radius R(t) and the bubble 
wall velocity R(t)/dt. This change is bubble radius produces the pressure differences at the 
center of the gaseous bubble. The difference in work done along with the pressure at the 
bubble wall equals the kinetic energy in the liquid shown by Eq. (B.2).

After rearranging this kinetic energy equation, and differentiating with respect to R, it can be

APPENDIX C: DERIVATION OF GILMORE FORMULATION FOR BUBBLE 
DYNAMICS 
 
Gilmore [21] starts by using the basic flow relations of a spherical bubble, modeling 
as it grows and collapses in an infinite liquid. This method neglects any asymmetric motions 
the bubble might undergo during cavitation. Due to spherically symmetric liquid flow, the 
velocity vector, , can be written as negative the gradient of the velocity potential, 
,  hence 
the equation of motion as written in Eq. C.1:

(C.2) 
The conservation of mass problem can be used to transform the gradient dot the vector 
velocity shown in Eq. C.2.  Eq. C.2 allows the viscosity term in Eq. C.1 to be ignored and the 
integration over the pressure field can be completed provide a couple assumptions. The first 
is that the pressure at infinity is a constant, and when the pressure is at infinity the velocity 
and its potential can be dismissed. The second assumption is that the liquid density, ρ, can be 
written in terms of pressure.  The quantity H(p) is the enthalpy difference between the 
pressure at the bubble wall and the pressure at infinity. After making the assumptions and 
substituting Eq. C.3 into C.1 and integrating the equation a new relationship can be seen in 
Eq. C.4.

Assuming that the sonic wave speed does not vary significantly from its speed at infinity, c∞, 
Eq. C.5 can be used to express the velocity potential for diverging spherical sound waves.  
Defining „r‟ as the distance from the center of the bubble and  „f‟ as a function Eq. C.4 can be 
rewritten in C.5.

To obtain equations C.7 and C.8 it is assumed that r(H +u2/2) is propagating through with 
the velocity of (c + u.) The equation is simply written in terms of particle velocity and 
expanded, as seen in Eq. C.8.  
 

54 
 
In the spherical, symmetric, bubble cavitation formulation Eq. C.1 can be rewritten as 
the derivative of the velocity with respect to time set equal to the negative value of the partial 
derivative of the enthalpy with respect to distance, „r.‟ Neglecting the viscosity, Eq. C.2 can 
be written as follows:

(C.9) 
 
Using relationships c2=dp/dρ and dp/ρ=dH, and substituting into C.8 one can see the 
formulation becomes a relationship between the velocity and pressure fields.

The spherical flow particle derivative can be found by eliminating the derivatives with

Gilmore justifies this result that Eq. C.12 agrees with the numerical solution of u/c=2.2.  The 
relationship between the fluid equations and the bubble wall motion are easily connected. As 
the bubble cavitates it is in the path of Eq. C.12. Using the fluid equation at ‘r’  at the bubble 
wall (R) and dividing by C:

APPENDIX D: DERIVATION OF LINEAR RESONANCE FREQUENCY 
EQUATION7  
 
For small bubble oscillations undergoing stable cavitation in a low intensity acoustic 
field the linear value of the resonance frequency can be derived by making the equation of 
motion linear. The assumptions are that the amplitude of incoming wave would be much 
smaller that the ambient pressure. Starting with general Keller-Herring [K-H] equation, as 
shown in Eq. 11, it can be rewritten in terms of pressure, shown below.

gas inside the bubble (air).   
 
Using the original K-H equation given in Chapter Two (Eq. 11) and Eq. D.1the 
relationship R(t)=R0(1+x(t)) where -1 ≤ x ≤ 1 works out to be:

E.2 Search Function 
 
 
This function used variables of frequency, pressure amplitude and cycles to complete 
a bounded search over the function in C.1 titled max_iradbigelow. It was written to scan 
initial bubble sizes searching for the maximum expansion relative to the initial size, prior to 
when the bubble dropped below its initial size.  Finding this optimal seed size was the 
primary goal of the simulations. For example, if the frequency was on the 1 MHz loop and 
the pressure amplitude (pamp) was on the 1 MPa loop the search function would find the 
smallest bubble size for that particular set of input variables. This example of the code would 
produce twenty eight values of optimal seed sizes.

E.3 Finding Theoretical Size  
 
Using the Keller-Herring linearization of the bubble dynamics a theoretical resonance size 
was modeled. The code used a roots function to solve for the resonance size given a specific 
frequency. The original equation is shown in Eq. 12, Chapter 3.  This was implemented into 
the search function to serve as a sanity check for the results as low pressure amplitudes.  
 
function r_size = find_size_theory(f); 
% Resonance size given bubble frequency 
  
  
%Equation given in "A Numerical Investigation of the Resonance of 
%Gas-filled Microbubbles: Resonance Dependence on Acoustic Pressure 
%Amplitude" NOTE: the ki(shell elasticity parameter) terms were neglected

%  po    = AMBIENT PRESSURE
