EDUCATION
Oxford University: Degree of BA in Mathematics and Philosophy (First Class Honours), 1973. Converted to 
MA (Oxon.), 1977.  
University of Manchester: Ph.D. in Philosophy, 1976. Dissertation: The Ontology of Reference. Studies in 
Logic and Phenomenology, xvi + 477pp., a study of theories of meaning and reference in Frege and Husserl. 
Supervisor: Wolfe Mays. 
Abstract: We propose a dichotomy between object-entities and meaning-entities. The former are entities such 
as molecules, cells, organisms, organizations, numbers, shapes, and so forth. The latter are entities such as 
concepts, propositions, and theories belonging to the realm of logic. Frege distinguished analogously between a 
‘realm of reference’ and a ‘realm of sense’, which he presented in some passages as mutually exclusive. This 
however contradicts his assumption elsewhere that every entity is a referent (even Fregean senses can be 
referred to by means of suitably constructed expressions). We apply the meaning/object dichotomy to 
mathematical and fictional entities, and develop a view of mathematical and other abstract objects as the results 
of certain types of demarcation – as for example the North Sea is the result of demarcations built into naval charts. 
Such demarcations reflect demarcatory acts, which presuppose complex cognitive and social structures enabling 
the creation of maps, of theories (of mathematics, of natural science), and of novels.

STUDIES OF MY WORK 
Festschrifts 
1. Leo Zaibert (ed.), The Theory and Practice of Ontology, London and New York: Palgrave/MacMillan, 
December 2016 
This book provides close examination of ontology and the work of Professor Barry Smith, one of the most prolific 
philosophers of the modern day. In this book numerous scholars who have collaborated with Smith explore the various 
disciplines in which the impact of his work has been felt over the breadth of his career, including biology, computer 
science and informatics, cognitive science, economics, genetics, geography, law, neurology, and philosophy itself. While 
offering in-depth perspectives on ontology, the book also expands upon the breadth of Smith’s influence. With insights 
from renowned and influential scholars from many different countries, this book is an informative and enlightening 
celebration of all Smith has contributed to numerous academic schools of thought.

SOCIAL MEDIA 
HL7 Watch: HL7 (Health Level 7) is a collection of standards and proposals for healthcare-specific data 
exchange between computer applications. Considerable efforts are being invested by governments and 
industry to use HL7 as part of national health IT projects. Many claims are made on behalf of HL7 by its 
advocates. The goal of this blog is to investigate the merits of these claims, and to provide some needed 
independent perspective on the HL7 project.

JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUES 
1. Barry Smith and Richard Scheuermann (eds.), Ontologies for Clinical and 
Translational Research (Special issue of the Journal of Biomedical 
Informatics), Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2011, 176 pp. 
Abstract: A collection of original papers focusing on the ways in which biomedical ontologies 
are being used in attempts to break down the barriers between the many different sorts of 
information relevant to the understanding and treatment of disease, ranging from 
information deriving from experimental biology and model organism research to clinical trial 
data and information of the sort contained in electronic health records. The contributions 
represent both the state of the art and works in progress, and they reveal how far we still 
have to go if we are to reach the level of domain coverage and semantic consistency sought 
by those engaged in information-driven clinical and translational research.

Abstract: This special issue of Applied Ontology is devoted to the foundation, the 
comparison and the application of functional theories in all areas, with particular attention 
to the biological and engineering domains. It includes theoretical and technical contributions 
related to the description, characterization, and application of functions.  
3. Andreas Tolk and Barry Smith (eds.), Command and Control Ontology 
(Special issue of the International Journal of Intelligent Defence Support 
Systems), 4 (3), 2011, 98 pp. 
Abstract: Intelligent defence support systems are confronted with the need to manage 
ever-increasing floods of data in a way that raises significant challenges because the data 
are described and presented using different terminologies and formats. How, on this basis, 
is it possible to reach a common understanding of the information content of these data 
among people and software agents? How is it possible to ensure that domain knowledge is 
reused in consistent fashion in a way that makes this information available for integration 
and analysis? How can we support the identification, selection, composition, and 
orchestration of services based on such diverse data providing homogeneous support by a 
service-oriented architecture? This collection is devoted to the use of ontologies to answer 
questions such as these.

1. Barry Smith, “The Ontogenesis of Mathematical Objects”, Journal of the 
British Society for Phenomenology, 6 (1975), 91–101. 
Abstract: Mathematical objects are divided into (1) those which are autonomous, i.e., not 
dependent for their existence upon mathematicians’ conscious acts, and (2) intentional 
objects, which are so dependent. Platonist philosophy of mathematics argues that all objects 
belong to group (1), Brouwer’s intuitionism argues that all belong to group (2). Here we 
attempt to develop a dualist ontology of mathematics (implicit in the work of, e.g., Hilbert), 
exploiting the theories of Meinong, Husserl and Ingarden on the relations between 
autonomous and intentional objects. In particular we develop a phenomenology of 
mathematical works, which has the stratified intentional structure discovered by Ingarden 
in his study of the literary work.  
2. Barry Smith, “Frege and Husserl: The Ontology of Reference”, Journal of 
the British Society for Phenomenology, 9 (1978), 111–125. 
Abstract: Analytic philosophers apply the term ‘object’ both to concreta and to abstracta 
of certain kinds. The theory of objects which this implies is shown to rest on a dichotomy 
between object-entities on the one hand and meaning-entities on the other, and it is 
suggested that the most adequate account of the latter is provided by Husserl’s theory of 
noemata. A two-story ontology of objects and meanings (concepts, classes) is defended, 
and Löwenheim’s work on class-representatives is cited as an indication of how the need for 
higher types may be obviated, even in mathematical contexts. The paper concludes with a 
sketch of the taxonomy of the object realm which results from the above. 
3. Barry Smith, “An Essay in Formal Ontology”, Grazer Philosophische 
Studien, 6 (1978), 39–62. 
Abstract: This paper is both a working introduction to the realist ontological theory put 
forward by the Polish phenomenologist Roman Ingarden and also a development of 
Ingarden’s views in the light of current tendencies in analytic philosophical logic. The central 
theme of the paper is the ontological analysis of states of affairs, and in particular of 
negative states of affairs, a topic which is of some specific interest in forming a connecting 
link between the Brentano-Meinong-Husserl tradition to which Ingarden belonged, and the 
(Frege)-Russell-Wittgenstein tradition which gave rise to modern philosophical logic. 
4. Barry Smith, “Law and Eschatology in Wittgenstein’s Early Thought”, 
Inquiry, 21 (1978), 425–441. 
Abstract: The paper investigates the role played by ethical deliberation and ethical 
judgment in Wittgenstein’s early thought in the light of twentieth-century German legal 
philosophy. In particular the theories of the phenomenologists Adolf Reinach, Wilhelm 
Schapp and Gerhart Husserl are singled out, as resting on ontologies which are structurally 
similar to that of the Tractatus. In each case it is actual and possible Sachverhalte which 
constitute the prime ontological category. The study of the relationship between the states 
of affairs depicted, e.g., in the sentences of a legal trial and prior fact-complexes to which 
these may correspond suggests one possible connecting link between the logical and 
ontological sections of the Tractatus and the ethical reflections appearing at the end. It is 
argued that the latter can best be understood in terms of the idea of a “last judgment” (with 
its associated ethical rewards and punishments) which would relate to the world as a whole 
as a penal trial relates to individual complexes of facts.

Abstract: For Meinong, familiarly, fictional entities are not created, but rather merely 
discovered (or picked out) from the inexhaustible realm of Aussersein (beyond being and 
non-being). The phenomenologist Roman Ingarden, in contrast, offers in his Literary Work 
of Art of 1931 a constructive ontology of fiction, which views fictional objects as entities 
which are created by the acts of an author (as laws, for example, are created by acts of 
parliament). We outline the logic of fiction which is implied by Ingarden’s approach, showing 
how it distinguishes the properties possessed by fictional objects (for instance of having 
been created by such and such an author in such and such a work) from characteristics (for 
instance of smoking a pipe, of living in Baker Street) which are merely associated with such 
objects.

6. Barry Smith, “Logic, Form and Matter”, Proceedings of the Aristotelian 
Society, Supplementary Volume 55 (1981), 47–63. 
Abstract: It is argued on the basis of ideas derived from Wittgenstein’s Tractatus and 
Husserl’s Logical Investigations that the formal comprehends more than the logical. More 
specifically: that there exist certain formal-ontological constants (part, whole, overlapping, 
etc.) which do not fall within the province of logic. A two-dimensional directly depicting 
language is developed for the representation of the constants of formal ontology, and means 
are provided for the extension of this language to enable the representation of certain 
materially necessary relations. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relationship 
between formal logic, formal ontology and mathematics.

8. Barry Smith and Kevin Mulligan, “Framework for Formal Ontology”, Topoi, 
3 (1983), 73–85. 
Abstract: We draw on the distinction first expounded by Husserl between formal logic and 
formal ontology. The former concerns itself with (formal) meaning-structures; the latter 
with formal structures amongst objects and their parts. The paper attempts to show how, 
when formal ontological considerations are brought into play, contemporary extensionalist 
theories of part and whole, and above all the mereology of Leniewski, can be generalised to 
embrace not only relations between concrete objects and object-pieces, but also relations 
between what we shall call dependent parts or moments. A two-dimensional formal 
language is canvassed for the resultant ontological theory, a language which owes more to 
the tradition of Euler, Boole and Venn than to the quantifier-centred languages which have 
predominated amongst analytic philosophers since the time of Frege and Russell. Analytic 
philosophical arguments against moments, and against the entire project of a formal 
ontology, are considered and rejected.

Gargani (eds.), Wittgenstein and Contemporary Philosophy (Teoria, 5), Pisa: 
ETS (1984), 156–165. 
Abstract: The paper seeks to show how Weininger’s interpretations of Kant and 
Schopenhauer help us to understand some of the peculiar reflections on the will, on 
happiness and unhappiness, and on the problems of life, which are to be found in 
Wittgenstein's Notebooks. It seeks to explain, above all, why Wittgenstein should wish to 
reject the basic ethical axiom of “love thy neighbor.” There follows a sketch of one possible 

BARRY SMITH

Kantian interpretation of the Tractatus along Weiningerian lines. The conclusion is drawn, 
however, that, while in the Notebooks many of Weininger’s views are still accepted, by the 
time of the Tractatus Wittgenstein has moved to a position in which a thinker like Weininger 
must be conceived as propounding so much more “ethical nonsense.” Wittgenstein adopts 
in the Tractatus a wholly new conception of the ethical, a form of logical individualism or 
quietism.

10. Barry Smith, “Acta cum fundamentis in re”, Dialectica, 38 (1984), 157–
178. 
Abstract: The paper defends a theory of mind according to which certain sorts of acts are 
‘real material relations’ and compares this theory to causal theories of reference and 
perception. All mental acts are dependent for their existence upon the subject (person, 
organism) whose acts they are. Relational acts are dependent also on intended objects in 
the world. The relational theory thus implies a rejection of the Cartesian thesis to the effect 
that we could in principle have exactly the same thoughts even though the objects of these 
thoughts did not exist. It implies thereby also a rejection of Husserlian phenomenology. 
Husserl’s earlier work on the formal ontology of part, whole and dependence nevertheless 
provides a framework which can allow a precise formulation of the relational theory. 
11. Barry Smith, “Ten Conditions on a Theory of Speech Acts”, Theoretical 
Linguistics, 11 (1984), 311–330. 
Abstract: It is now generally recognized that figures such as Reid, Peirce, and Reinach 
formulated theories of speech acts avant la lettre of Austin and Searle, in Reid and Reinach’s 
cases under the heading ‘theory of social acts’. Here we address the question as to what 
conditions would have to be satisfied for such theories to count as ‘theories of speech acts’ 
in the now familiar sense.  
12. Kevin Mulligan, Peter M. Simons and Barry Smith, “Truth-Makers”, 
Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 44 (1984), 287–321. 
Abstract: A realist theory of truth for a class of sentences holds that there are entities in 
virtue of which these sentences are true or false. We call such entities ‘truthmakers’ and 
contend that those for a wide range of sentences about the real world are moments 
(dependent particulars). Since moments are unfamiliar, we provide a definition and a brief 
philosophical history, anchoring them in our ontology by showing that they are objects of 
perception. The core of our theory is the account of truthmaking for atomic sentences, in 
which we expose a pervasive ‘dogma of logical form’, which says that atomic sentences 
cannot have more than one truthmaker. In contrast to this, we uphold the mutual 
independence of logical and ontological complexity, and the authors outline formal principles 
of truthmaking taking account of both kinds of complexity. We conclude by suggesting how 
to overcome the problem of negation faced by an account of truth in keeping with 
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus.

Als zu Beginn des Jahrhunderts der Realismus wieder ernst genommen wurde, gab es viele 
Philosophen, die sich mit der Ontologie der Wahrheit befaßten. Unabhängig von der 
Bestimmung der Wahrheit als Korrespondenzbeziehung wollten sie herausfinden, inwieweit 
zur Erklärung der Wahrheit von Sätzen besondere Entitäten herangezogen werden müssen. 
Einige dieser Entitäten, so zum Beispiel Bolzanos ‘Sätze an sich’, Freges ‘Gedanken’ oder 
die ‘propositions’ von Russell und Moore, wurden als Träger der Eigenschaften Wahrheit und 
Falschheit aufgefaßt. Einige Philosophen jedoch, wie Russell, Wittgenstein im ›Tractatus‹ 
und Husserl in den ›Logischen Untersuchungen‹, argumentierten, zusätzlich zu den 
Wahrheitsträgern bzw. an ihrer Stelle müßten Entitäten angenommen werden, auf Grund 
deren Sätze und/oder ‘Propositionen’ wahr sind. Solchen Entitäten gab man verschiedene 
Namen, insbesondere ‘fact’, ‘Tatsache’, ‘state of affairs’ und ‘Sachverhalt’. 1 Wir wollen einer 
Entscheidung über die Angebrachtheit dieser Ausdrücke nicht vorgreifen und daher zunächst 
eine neutralere Terminologie verwenden: Alle Entitäten, die für diese zweite Rolle in Frage 
kommen, wollen wir ‘Wahrmacher’ nennen.

Lors du renouveau réaliste des premières années de ce siècle, des philosophes de divers 
horizons s’impliquèrent dans la recherche d’une ontologie de la vérité. Que le point de vue 
de la vérité-correspondance ait été retenu ou non, ils s’y intéressèrent dans la mesure où il 
était requis de supposer l’existence d’entités jouant un rôle pour rendre compte de la vérité 
des phrases. Certaines de ces entités, comme les Sätze an sich de Bolzano, les Gedanken 
de Frege, ou les Propositions de Russell et Moore, étaient conçues comme porteurs des 
propriétés de vérité et de fausseté. Cependant, quelques penseurs comme Russell, 
Wittgenstein dans le Tractatus ou Husserl dans les Recherches logiques, arguèrent qu’en 
plus ou à la place de ces porteurs de vérité, il fallait supposer l’existence de certaines entités 
en vertu desquelles les phrases ou les propositions sont vraies. Plusieurs noms ont été 
utilisés pour désigner ces entités, comme « fait », « Sachverhalt », et « état de choses ». Afin 
de ne pas préjuger de la pertinence de ces termes, nous allons employer une terminologie 
plus neutre et appeler vérifacteurs toutes les entités candidates pour ce rôle.

Abstract: A study of the background of Husserl’s early thinking in the perceptual psychology 
of Carl Stumpf and of the implications of Stumpfian ideas for an understanding of Husserl’s 
phenomenology. Other topics treated include the ontology of part, whole and dependence; 
gestalt theory; and Husserl’s notion of the synthetic a priori.

Studien, 25/26 (1986), 533–557.  
Abstract: In perceptual experience we are directed towards objects in a way which 
establishes a real relation between a mental act and its target. In reading works of fiction 
we enjoy experiences which manifest certain internal similarities to such relational acts, but 
which lack objects. The substitution theory of art attempts to provide a reason why we seek 
out such experiences and the artifacts which they generate. Briefly, we seek out works of

art because we enjoy the physiology and the phenomenology of, for example, the 
experience of love or mountain climbing, and works of art serve as props for the promotion 
of substitutes for the corresponding genuine feelings. Art arose, or came to be separated 
out from other, related phenomena, through the discovery that the experience of substitute 
emotions can be pleasurable.

16. Kevin Mulligan and Barry Smith, “A Relational Theory of the Act”, Topoi, 
5/2 (1986), 115–130.  
Abstract: The paper defends a view of perceptual acts as real relations of a subject to an 
object. To make this view coherent, a theory of different types of relations is developed, 
resting on ideas on formal ontology put forward by Husserl in his Logical Investigations and 
on the theory of relations sketched in Smith’s “Acta cum fundamentis in re”. The theory is 
applied to the notion of a Cambridge change, which proves to have an unforeseen relevance 
to our understanding of perception. 
17. Kevin Mulligan and Barry Smith, “Husserl’s Logical Investigations”, 
Grazer Philosophische Studien, 27 (1986), 199–207. 
Abstract: The magisterial analyses of logic and meaning advanced in Husserl's Logical 
Investigations of 1900/01 have for a number of reasons been neglected by analytical 
philosophers in subsequent decades. This state of affairs has to do, in part, with the history 
of the editions and translations of Husserl's writings. Findlay's readable but imperfect 
translation appeared seventy years after the work itself was first published, and the editors 
and translators and expositors of Husserl's works have reflected the prevailing philosophical 
atmosphere on the Continent by concentration their energies on Husserl's later writings. 
Now, however, over eighty years after the appearance of Husserl 's one true masterpiece, 
a critical edition of the work is at last available in completed form. We here analyze the 
structure and content of this new edition, published as part of the Husserliana series by the 
Husserl Archive in Louvain. 
18. Kevin Mulligan and Barry Smith, “A Husserlian Theory of Indexicality”, in 
Grazer Philosophische Studien, 28 (1986), 133–163. 
Abstract: It is well known that Husserl’s Logical Investigations contain the beginnings of 
an account of the meanings of indexical expressions, expressions whose meanings depend 
essentially on some sort of explicit or implicit pointing or indication [Anzeigen], and 
therefore on some contribution by the surroundings of speaker and hearer. Husserl in fact 
speaks explicitly of ‘occasional expressions’, that is of expressions like ‘this’ and ‘that’ whose 
meanings depend on features of the occasion of use, but it is possible to gauge the full 
implications of his explicit remarks on the problem of indexical or occasional meanings only 
if these are read in conjunction with what he says elsewhere in the Investigations, especially 
on the subject of perceptual judgments and proper names. Moreover, Husserl’s deliberations 
on indication, perception and naming, as also what he has to say on demonstrative 
pronouns, spatial and temporal adverbs and tenses, must themselves be understood – like 
everything else in this work – as applications of a very general theory of meaning and of 
structure or dependence. In what follows we shall set out Husserl’s account of indexicality 
and develop it in various ways. Unlike Husserl himself – who retrospectively described his 
own account as an ‘act of violence’ – we are strongly of the opinion that this effort is 
worthwhile.

39–49. 
Abstract: This paper is a study of Brentano’s ontology, and more specifically of his theory 
of substance and accident as put forward toward the end of his life in the materials collected 
together as the Kategorienlehre or Theory of Categories. Here Brentano presents an 
auditious (re-)interpretation of Aristotle’s theory of substance and accidence. We show that 
on the Brentano initially defends, it is space which serves as the single substance upon 
which all other entities depend as accidents of space. In an appendix, however, Brentano 
puts forward an even more radical suggestion, inspired by the physics of Kelvin. According 
to this final view, space itself is an accident of a deeper substance: the present time.

(1987), 57–66. 
Abstract: Ingarden’s puzzle is: how can we come to know what is essentially involved in 
an act of knowing? As starting point he takes what he holds to be a particular good candidate 
example of such an act, namely an act of perceiving an apple. Here we have act and object 
standing in a certain first-level relation to each other. We now in a second level act of 
reflection, make this first-level relation into an object, and strive to apprehend this object 
as an instantiation of the essence knowledge. But how, on this basis, could we ever establish 
that we had indeed grasped this essence, and that this is indeed the appropriate essence? 
Surely, through some third-level act of reflection on this second-level act. We expound from 
an ontological point of view Ingarden's idea as to how this regress can be avoided.

Abstract: Between 1910 und 1915 the Hungarian philosoper Der ungarische Philosoph Béla 
Zalai (1882-1915) developed his “comparative metaphysics of systems”, which had a 
significant influence on both the young Georg Lukács and also on Karl Mannheim. Through 
an analysis of Zalai’s approach to metaphysics, we show how he served to mediate between 
the realist Austrian philosophy of Meinong and of the early Husserl on the one side, and the 
German (idealistic, Kantian) philosophy then dominant in Hungary.

Abstract: This is a historical study of the logical, psychological and linguistic dimensions of

Brentano–Studien, 1 (1988), 75–88. 
Abstract: The piece of wax takes on the form of the seal; but this occurs in a way that is 
largely indifferent to the particular constitution of the seal. Similarly, Aristotle says, ‘the 

BARRY SMITH  
 
 
84 
 
 
sense is affected by what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent as to 
what in each case the substance is’. We show that Brentano takes this Aristotelian account 
of the relation between sense and its objects as the basis for his theory of mind in the 
Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint. 
24. Barry Smith, “The Primacy of Place: An Investigation in Brentanian 
Ontology”, Topoi, 8 (1989), 43–51. 
Abstract: In his later writings Brentano defended a peculiar doctrine to the effect that the 
substances of the material world are three-dimensional places. The paper presents the 
psychological origins of this view and shows how the issue as to the nature of substance 
can throw light not only on Brentanian and Aristotelian ontology but also on a spectrum of 
views ranging from Quine, Kotarbinski and Lesniewski to Twardowski and Meinong. 
25. Barry Smith, “Logic and the Sachverhalt”, The Monist, 72 (1989), 52–
69.  
Abstract: Logic is often conceived as a science of propositions, or of relations between 
propositions. There is an alternative view, however, defended by Meinong, Pfänder, Reinach 
and others, which sees logic as a science of “Sachverhalte” or states of affairs. A 
consideration of this view, which was defended especially by thinkers within the tradition of 
Brentano, throws new light on the problems of intentionality and of mental content. It 
throws light also on the development of logic in Poland. Here the influence of Brentano’s 
student Kasimir Twardowski is especially important, and the paper concludes with a new 
interpretation of Tarski’s work on truth against the background of Twardowski’s thinking.

26. Barry Smith, “On the Origins of Analytic Philosophy”, Grazer 
Philosophische Studien, 35 (1989), 153–173. 
Abstract: Analytic philosophers have until recently been reluctant to pursue historical 
investigations into the Central European roots of their own philosophical tradition. The most 
recent book by Michael Dummett, however, entitled Origins of Analytic Philosophy, shows 
how fruitful such investigations can be, not only as a means of coming to see familiar 
philosophical problems in a new light, but also as a means of clarifying what, precisely, 
‘analytic philosophy’ might mean. As Dummett points out, the newly fashionable habit of 
referring to analytic philosophy as ‘Anglo-American’ leads to a ‘grave historical distortion’. 
If, he says, we take into account the historical context in which analytic philosophy 
developed, then such philosophy ‘could at least as well be called "Anglo-Austrian"’ (p. 7). 
We here show the implications of this assertion for a more adequate understanding of the 
relations between analytic and Continental philosophy.

methodological underpinnings of Menger's work. These include Leibnizian, Kantian, Millian,

and even Popperian readings; but they include also readings of an Aristotelian sort. I argue 
tha the historical situation in which Menger found himself points to the inevitability of the 
Aristotelian reading and that this reading fits also very naturally to the text of Menger's 
works. At the same time I will explain why the diversity of interpretations is not, however, 
entirely surprising. Menger broke new ground in economic theory in part by fashioning new 
linguistic instruments not easily open to unambiguous interpretation.

28. Karl Schuhmann and Barry Smith, “Elements of Speech Act Theory in 
the Work of Thomas Reid”, History of Philosophy Quarterly, 7 (1990), 47–
66. 
Abstract: Historical research has recently made it clear that, prior to Austin and Searle, the 
phenomenologist Adolf Reinach (1884-1917) developed a full-fledged theory of speech acts 
under the heading of what he called "social acts". He we consider a second instance of a 
speech act theory avant la lettre, which is to be found in the common sense philosophy of 
Thomas Reid (1710-1796). Reid’s s work, in contrast to that of Reinach, lacks both a unified 
approach and the detailed analyses of pertinent examples. But his writings leave no doubt 
that he is acutely aware of the very problems concerning language structure and use out of 
which contemporary speech act theory has evolved and that he goes a good way towards 
solving these problems in the spirit of the modern theory.  
29. Barry Smith, “Textual Deference”, American Philosophical Quarterly, 28 
(1991), 1–13. 
Abstract: Works of philosophy written in English have spawned a massive secondary 
literature dealing with ideas, problems or arguments. But they have almost never given rise 
to works of ‘commentary’ in the strict sense, a genre which is however a dominant literary 
form not only in the Confucian, Vedantic, Islamic, Jewish and Scholastic traditions, but also 
in relation to more recent German-language philosophy. Yet Anglo-Saxon philosophers have 
themselves embraced the commentary form when dealing with Greek or Latin philosophers 
outside their own tradition. The paper seeks to establish the reasons for this peculiar 
asymmetry by examining those factors which might be conducive to the growth of a 
commentary literature in a given culture.

Abstract: The paper addresses the apparent asymmetry as between German and English 
philosophical texts, turning on the fact that translations from the former into the latter 
language are typically much more easily obtained than in the reverse direction. A range of 
factors are shown to be involved, both stylistic and sociological. Most important, however, 
is a difference in the conception of what philosophy is in the two cultures.

Abstract: Johannes Daubert he was an acknowledged leader, and in some respects the 
founder, of the early phenomenological movement, and was considered – as much by its 
members as by Husserl himself – the most brilliant member of the group. In Daubert’s 
unpublished writings we find a series of reflections on Lask, and on Neo-Kantianism, which 
form the subject-matter of this paper. They range over topics such as the ontology of the 
‘Sachverhalt’ or state of affairs, truthvalues (Wahrheitswerte) and the value of truth, 
negative judgments and the copula, and the relation between perception and judgment.

contemporary work on common sense in the field of artificial intelligence (J. Hobbs, P.

Abstract: From the point of view of Brentano’s philosophy, contemporary philosophy of 
mind presupposes an over-crude theory of the internal structures of mental acts and states 
and of the corresponding types of parts, unity and dependence. We here describe Brentano’s 
own account of the part-whole structures obtaining in the mental sphere, and show how it 
opens up new possibilities for mereological investigation. One feature of Brentano’s view is 
that the objects of experience are themselves parts of mind, so that there is a sense in 
which for him (as e.g. for Leibniz) ontology is a proper part of rational or descriptive 
psychology.

Abstract: To what in reality do true logically simple sentences with empirical content 
correspond? Two extreme positions can be distinguished in this regard: ‘Great Fact’ theories, 
such as are defended by Davidson; and trope-theories, which see such sentences being 
made true simply by those events or states to which the relevant main verbs correspond. A 
position midway between these two extremes is defended, one according to which sentences 

BARRY SMITH  
 
 
87 
 
 
of the given sort are made true by what are called ‘dependence structures’, or in other 
words by certain complex concrete portions of reality between the parts of which relations 
of dependence are defined. Principles governing such dependence-structures are laid down, 
principles of an ontologically motivated sort which serve as basis for a “topological 
semantics” conceived as an alternative to standard set-theoretic approaches to semantics 
of the Tarskian sort. These principles are then used to resolve certain puzzles generated by 
the (semantically motivated) theory of events put forward by Davidson.

(eds.), Return of the A Priori (Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 
Supplementary Volume 18), (1993), 301–322.  
Abstract: Where Humeans rule out the possibility of material or non-logical necessity, and 
thus of any associated knowledge a priori, the German legal philosopher Adolf Reinach 
defends the existence of a wide class of material necessities falling within the domain of 
what can be known a priori, for example in fields such as color and shape, rational 
psychology, law and economics. Categories such as promise or claim or obligation are, in 
Reinach’s view, exist as nodes in a system of necessary relations, so that anyone who has 
experience of relevant instances of these categories is implicitly aware also of a 
corresponding family of relations to certain other categories – as for example that every 
promise implies a mutually correlated claim and obligation.  
Midway between the two extremes of Hume and Reinach stands Searle, who accepts 
necessary relations of the mentioned sorts, but sees them as human creations, following 
from ‘constitutive rules’ analogous to the rules of chess. We seek to demonstrate that Searle 
does not occupy a stable and acceptable half-way house between Hume and Reinach; that 
he, too, if he is to do justice to the very constitutive rules which form the center of his 
approach, must on pain of circularity embrace something like the Reinachian position. 
37. Karl Schuhmann and Barry Smith, “Two Idealisms: Lask and Husserl”, 
Kant-Studien, 83 (1993), 448–466. 
Abstract: Neo-Kantianism is common conceived as a philosophy ‘from above’, excelling in 
speculative constructions – as opposed to the attitude of patient description which is 
exemplified by the phenomenological turn ‘to the things themselves’. When we study the 
work of Emil Lask in its relation to that of Husserl and the phenomenologists, however, and 
when we examine the influences moving in both directions, then we discover that this idea 
of a radical opposition is misconceived. Lask himself was influenced especially by Husserl’s 
Logical Investigations, and Husserl, especially in his later writings, was in some respects 
closer to Kant than were the Neo-Kantians. The contrast between the two philosophers can 
be illustrated by looking at their view of the objects of judgment; for Lask, as for Kant, 
judgment can relate to the thing as such only in an indirect way. The world of judgment is 
a collection of ‘imitations holding a secondary position’. It is cut apart from the plain world 
of real things by what Lask calls a ‘chasm of artificiality and imagery’. For Husserl, in 
contrast, the object of judgment is a ‘Sachverhalt’ or state of affairs, something ontologically 
‘positive’ in the sense that it is an entity in its own right and does not point beyond itself in 
the manner of a mere sign or proxy for something else.

38. Barry Smith and Roberto Casati, “Naive Physics: An Essay in Ontology”, 
Philosophical Psychology, 7/2 (1994), 225–244.  
Abstract: The project of a naive physics has been the subject of attention in recent years 
above all in the artificial intelligence field, in connection with work on common-sense 
reasoning, perceptual representation and robotics. The idea of a theory of the common-
sense world is however much older than this, having its roots not least in the work of 
phenomenologists and Gestalt psychologists such as Kohler, Husserl, Schapp and Gibson. 
This paper seeks to show how contemporary naive physicists can profit from a knowledge 
of these historical roots of their discipline, which are shown to imply above all a critique of 
the set-theory-based models of reality typically presupposed by contemporary work in 
common-sense ontology.

Abstract: The perception of spatial bodies is at least in part a perception of bodily 
boundaries or surfaces. The usual mathematical conception of boundaries as abstract 
constructions is, however, of little use for cognitive science purposes. The essay therefore 
seeks a more adequate conception of the ontology of boundaries building on ideas in 
Aristotle and Brentano on what we may call the coincidence of boundaries. It presents a 
formal theory of boundaries and of the continua to which they belong, of a sort which allows 
a resolution of certain Zeno-style paradoxes. The theory proves to be applicable not only in 
the cognitive science field but also in regard to problems relating to the ontology of 
geographical and geopolitical boundaries.

International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 43 (1995), 641–667.  
Abstract: Common sense is on the one hand a certain set of processes of natural cognition 
– of speaking, reasoning, seeing, and so on. On the other hand common sense is a system 
of beliefs (of folk physics, folk psychology and so on). Over against both of these is the 
world of common sense, the world of objects to which the processes of natural cognition 
and the corresponding belief-contents standardly relate. What are the structures of this 
world? How does the scientific treatment of this world relate to traditional and contemporary 
metaphysics and formal ontology? Can we embrace a thesis of common-sense realism to 
the effect that the world of common sense exists uniquely? Or must we adopt instead a 
position of cultural relativism which would assign distinct worlds of common sense to each 
group and epoch? The present paper draws on recent work in computer science (especially 
in the fields of naive and qualitative physics), in perceptual and developmental psychology, 
and in cognitive anthropology, in order to consider in a new light these and related questions 
and to draw conclusions for the methodology and philosophical foundations of the cognitive 
sciences.

Abstract: Philosophers in the field of analytic metaphysics have begun gradually to come 
to terms with the fact that there are entities in a range of categories not dreamt of in the 
set-theory and predicate-logic-based ontologies of their forefathers. Examples of such “entia 
minora” would include: boundaries, places, events, states holes, shadows, individual colour- 
and tone-instances (tropes), together with combinations of these and associated simple and 
complex universal species or essences, states of affairs, judgment-contents, and myriad 
abstract structures of the sorts which are studied by the mathematical sciences. How, as 
hunter-gatherer ontologists, are we to bring order into this vast array? How are we to gauge 
the ontological merits of given candidate entities, and how are we to understand their 
relation to entities of more humdrum sorts? Meinong, it turns out, offers a very simple 
answer to all of these questions.

Abstract: The paper seeks to show how the world of everyday human cognition might be 
treated as an object of ontological investigation in its own right. The paper is influenced by 
work on affordances and prototypicality of psychologists such as Gibson and Rosch, by work 
on cognitive universals of the anthropologist Robin Horton, and by work of Patrick Hayes 
and others on ‘naive’ or ‘qualitative physics’. It defends a thesis to the effect that there is, 
at the heart of common sense, a theoretical core of true propositions pertaining to 
mesoscopic objects, and that the latter are to be understood as relating mereologically to 
the objects studied by physical science.

Abstract: The paper is a contribution to formal ontology. It seeks to use topological means 
in order to derive ontological laws pertaining to the boundaries and interiors of wholes, to 
relations of contact and connectedness, to the concepts of surface, point, neighbourhood, 
and so on. The basis of the theory is mereology, the formal theory of part and whole, a 
theory which is shown to have a number of advantages, for ontological purposes, over 
standard treatments of topology in set-theoretic terms. One central goal of the paper is to 
provide a rigorous formulation of Brentano’s thesis to the effect that a boundary can exist 
as a matter of necessity only as part of a whole of higher dimension which it is the boundary

conceptual scheme. It takes as its starting point an Aristotelian ontology of “substances” 
and “accidents”, which are treated via the instruments of mereology and topology. The 
theory recognizes not only individual parts of substances and accidents, including the 
internal and external boundaries of these, but also universal parts, such as the “humanity” 
which is an essential part of both Tom and Dick, and also “individual relations”, such as 
Tom’s promise to Dick, or their current handshake.

Umwelten”, Zeitschrift für philosophische Forschung, 52 (1998), 521–540. 
Abstract: Erst in neuester Zeit haben sich analytische Philosophen vorbehaltlos dem 
Bereich der Metaphysik gewidmet. Unter den interessantesten Ergebnissen dieser 
,analytischen Metaphysik' ist John Searles neues Buch zur Ontologie der sozialen 
Gegenstände (Die Konstruktion der gesellschaftlichen Wirklichkeit. Zur Ontologie sozialer 
Tatsachen, Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1997). Was sind Staaten, Gemeinschaften, Gesetze? Nach 
Searle sind diese Gegenstände Korrelate einer ,kollektiven Intentionalität'. Searle vertritt 
m.a.W. eine kognitive Theorie von sozialen Gegenständen. Ein Problem bei einer solchen 
Theorie ist, daß wir Analogien zu bestimmten sozialen Gebilden auch bei Tieren begegnen, 
die den begrifflichen Apparat einer kollektiven Intentionalität nicht besitzen. Um dieses 
Problem zu umgehen, liegt es nahe, die biologischen Lehren von tierischen Umwelten, die 
etwa durch von Uexküll entwickelt wurden, auszunutzen. Von Uexkülls Umweltlehre ist 
jedoch eine Art organische Monadologie: jedes Tier, jeder Mensch, ist in seiner eigenen 
spezifischen Umwelt beheimatet, und es wird also schwer verständlich, wie das Verhalten 
zwischen Tieren überhaupt möglich ist. Der vorliegende Beitrag bietet eine Lösung dieses 
Problems, durch die wir auch eine verbesserte Auffassung der Ontologie sozialer 
Gegenstände überhaupt gewinnen. Als Grundlage dieser Auffassung dient die realistische 
Theorie menschlicher Umwelten, die in der ökologischen Psychologie J. J. Gibsons und Roger 
Barkers entwickelt wurde.

Abstract: We outline Brentano’s theory of boundaries, for instance between two 
neighboring subregions within a larger region of space. Does every such pair of regions 
contain points in common where they meet? Or is the boundary at which they meet 
somehow pointless? On Brentano’s view, two subregions such do not overlap; rather, along 
the line where they meet there are two sets of points which are not identical but rather 
spatially coincident. We outline Brentano’s theory of coincidence, and show how he uses it 
to resolve a number of Zeno-like paradoxes.

77 (3) (1999), 274–291. 
Abstract: We take as our starting point a thesis to the effect that, at least for true 
judgments of many varieties, there are parts of reality which make such judgments true. 
We argue that two distinct components are involved in this truthmaker relation. On the one 
hand is the relation of necessitation, which holds between an object x and a judgment p 
when the existence of x entails the truth of p. On the other hand is the dual notion of 
projection, which holds between a judgment p and an object x when the truth of p entails 
the existence of x. A truthmaker for a judgment p is then a necessitator for p which satisfies 
the further constraint that it is part of p’s projection. We offer a formal theory of the 
truthmaker relation thus defined, exploiting ontological tools of basic mereology and the 
theory of dependence. We then apply the theory to a range of problems connected with 
generic expressions, ellipsis, vagueness, and indexical and perceptual judgments.

Abstract: The categories of object and attribute, substance and accident, continuant and 
occurrent, have long enjoyed a dominant position in the history of metaphysics. The concept 
of niche (environment, setting, habitat), on the other hand, has been almost entirely 
neglected, in spite of the wide application of this and similar concepts in a variety of 
disciplines, from evolutionary biology to context-based semantics. The paper presents a 
theory of the niche, a theory of objects in their settings. It defends a view of niches as 
special sorts of parts of reality and builds upon existing work exploiting the resources of 
mereology (or the theory of part and whole) as an instrument of realist ontology. The theory 
will be illustrated above all by means of simple biological examples, but the concept of niche 
should be understood as being, like concepts such as part, boundary and location, a formal 
concept, one that is applicable in principle to a wide range of different domains.

An Empirical Investigation of Geographic Categories”, American Journal of 
Economics and Sociology, 58: 2 (April 1999), 245–272. 
Abstract: Ontology, since Aristotle, has been conceived as a sort of highly general physics, 
a science of the types of entities in reality, of the objects, properties, categories and 
relations which make up the world. At the same time ontology has been for some two 
thousand years a speculative enterprise. It has rested methodologically on introspection 
and on the construction and analysis of elaborate world-models and of abstract formal-
ontological theories. In the work of Quine and others this ontological theorizing in abstract 
fashion about the world was supplemented by the study, based on the use of logical 
methods, of the ontological commitments or presuppositions embodied in scientific theories. 
In recent years both types of ontological study have found application in the world of 
information systems, for example in the construction of frameworks for knowledge 
representation and in database design and translation. As ontology is in this way drawn 
closer to the domain of real-world applications, the question arises as to whether it is 
possible to use empirical methods in studying ontological theories. More specifically: can we 

BARRY SMITH

use empirical methods to test the ontological theories embodied in human cognition? We 
set forth the outlines of a framework for the formulation and testing of such theories as they 
relate to the specific domain of geographic objects and categories. 
50. Barry Smith and Achille Varzi, “Fiat and Bona Fide Boundaries”, 
Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 60: 2 (March 2000), 401–420.  
Abstract: We argue that the basic typology of spatial boundaries involves an opposition 
between bona fide (or physical) boundaries on the one hand, and fiat boundaries on the 
other, the latter being exemplified especially by boundaries induced through human 
demarcation, for example in the geographic realm. The classical metaphysical problems 
connected with the notions of adjacency, contact, separation and division can be resolved 
in an intuitive way by recognizing this two-sorted ontology of boundaries. Bona fide 
boundaries yield a notion of contact that is effectively modeled by classical topology; the 
analogue of contact involving fiat boundaries calls, however, for a different account, based 
on the intuition that fiat boundaries do not support the open/closed distinction on which 
classical topology is based. In the presence of this two-sorted ontology it then transpires 
that mereotopology—topology erected on a mereological basis—is more than a trivial formal 
variant of classical point-set topology.

Abstract: One reason for the renewed interest in Austrian philosophy, and especially in the 
work of Brentano and his followers, turns on the fact that analytic philosophers have become 
once again interested in the traditional problems of metaphysics. It was Brentano, Husserl, 
and the philosophers and psychologists whom they influenced, who drew attention to the 
thorny problem of intentionality, the problem of giving an account of the relation between 
acts and objects or, more generally, between the psychological environments of cognitive 
subjects and the different sorts of external (physical, geographical, social) environments 
which they inhabit. The present essay addresses this environmental version of the problem 
of intentionality. It draws not only on the work of Husserl and Scheler but also on the Gestalt 
psychological writings of Kurt Koffka and Kurt Lewin. It considers the influential subjective 
idealist theory of animal environments put forward by J. von Uexküll and contrasts this with 
a realist theory of organism-environment interaction based on the work of the ecological 
psychologists J. J. Gibson and Roger Barker. This realist theory is then exploited as a basis 
for an ontology of social objects of a range of different sorts.

“Using Cross-Lingual Information to Cope with Underspecification in Formal

Abstract: Description logics and other formal devices are frequently used as means for 
preventing or detecting mistakes in ontologies. Some of these devices are also capable of 
inferring the existence of inter-concept relationships that have not been explicitly entered 
into an ontology. A prerequisite, however, is that this information can be derived from those

formal definitions of concepts and relationships which are included within the ontology. In 
this paper, we present a novel algorithm that is able to suggest relationships among existing 
concepts in a formal ontology that are not derivable from such formal definitions. The 
algorithm exploits cross-lingual information that is implicitly present in the collection of 
terms used in various languages to denote the concepts and relationships at issue. By using 
a specific experimental design, we are able to quantify the impact of cross-lingual 
information in coping with underspecification in formal ontologies.

285-309. 
Abstract: Part 1 of this exchange consists in a critique by Smith of Searle’s The Construction 
of Social Reality focusing on Searle’s use of the formula ‘X counts as Y in context C’. Smith 
argues that this formula works well for social objects such as dollar bills and presidents 
where the corresponding X terms (pieces of paper, human beings) are easy to identify. In 
cases such as debts and prices and money in a banks computers, however, the formula 
fails, because these are cases of what he calls ‘free-standing Y terms’, since there is here 
no X which can count as the corresponding Y. In his response in Part 2, Searle argues that 
Smith’s critique rests on three misunderstandings: 1. in wrongly presupposing that Searle 
is trying to analyze the nature of what he calls “social objects”, rather than of social facts; 
2. in thinking that the counts as formula is intended as a definition, rather than as a mere 
mnemonic; and 3. in neglecting the naturalism of Searle’s account.

Zur Frage der Philosophie in Österreich und Deutschland”, Grazer 
Philosophische Studien 58/59 (2000), 241–262. 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable philosophical phenomena of the last 20 years is the 
rise of so-called ‘Continental Philosophy’ (C.P.), a creation above all of the North American 
university. Lectures under the heading of ‘Continental Philosophy’ are offered every year in 
Anglo-Saxon universities to many thousands of philosophy students, a practice which 
appears questionable not least for the reason that the lectures in question deal not with 
philosophy in Continental Europe as a whole, but rather only with a certain narrow segment 
of Franco-German philosophy, in which Heidegger seems to serve as the sole fixed point. 
Around him are assembled a progression of Paris-based thinkers expounding progressively 
more nonsensical claims concerning the ‘end’ of philosophy (or of the ‘modern’, of ‘the 
author’, of ‘man’, of ‘identity’, and so forth). In all of this the later Husserl is sometimes 
taken into account as C.P.-precursor, his teacher Franz Brentano however not at all. Other 
prominent German philosophers of the 20th century such as Ernst Cassirer or Nicolai 
Hartmann are likewise totally ignored, and so also are French philosophers in the tradition 
of Poincaré, Bergson or Gilson, as well as Polish, Scandinavian or Czech philosophers. The 
essay offers an explanation of these peculiar facts, which has to do with the different roles 
of politics and science in the different parts of Europe.

Argument”,

Abstract: Searle’s tool for understanding culture, law and society is the opposition between 
brute reality and institutional reality, or in other words between: observer-independent 
features of the world, such as force, mass and gravitational attraction, and observer-relative 
features of the world, such as money, property, marriage and government. The question 
posed here is: under which of these two headings do moral concepts fall? This is an 
important question because there are moral facts – for example pertaining to guilt and 
responsibility – which hover uncomfortably close to the boundary between the observer-
relative and the observer-independent. By means of a thought experiment involving an 
imagined Chinese society in which guilt is determined by the random throwing of sticks, I 
seek to show that moral concepts threaten the foundations of Searle’s philosophy of social 
reality.

a rare and fatal kidney ailment in virtue of which his brain is no longer able to send signals 
to his kidneys. If you remove the radio, the violinist will die. But never mind, it is only for 
nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and the radio can safely be 
removed. Are you morally obliged to agree to this situation?

Ontological Investigation”, International Journal of Geographical Information 
Science, 15: 7 (2001), 591–612. 
Abstract: This paper reports the results of a series of experiments designed to establish 
how non-expert subjects conceptualize geospatial phenomena. Subjects were asked to give 
examples of geographical categories in response to a series of differently phrased 
elicitations. The results yield an ontology of geographical categories—a catalogue of the 
prime geospatial concepts and categories shared in common by human subjects 
independently of their exposure to scientific geography. When combined with nouns such 
as feature and object, the adjective geographic elicited almost exclusively elements of the 
physical environment of geographical scale or size, such as mountain, lake and river. The 
phrase things that could be portrayed on a map, on the other hand, produced many 
geographical scale artefacts (roads, cities, etc.) and fiat objects (states, countries, etc.), as 
well as some physical feature types. These data reveal considerable mismatch as between 
the meanings assigned to the terms ‘geography’ and ‘geographic’ by scientific geographers 
and by ordinary subjects, so that scientific geographers are not in fact studying geographical 
phenomena as such phenomena are conceptualized by naive subjects. The data suggest, 
rather, a special role in determining the subject-matter of scientific geography for the 
concept of what can be portrayed on a map. This work has implications for work on usability 
and interoperability in geographical information science, and it throws light also on subtle 
and hitherto unexplored ways in which ontological terms such as ‘object’, ‘entity’ and 
‘feature’ interact with geographical concepts.

Abstract: Extended entities have boundaries of two different sorts: those that do, and those 
that do not correspond to physical discontinuities. Call the first sort (coastlines, the surface 
of your nose) bona fide boundaries; and the second (the boundary of Montana, the boundary 
separating your upper from your lower torso) fiat boundaries. Fiat boundaries are found 
especially in the geographic realm, but are involved wherever language carves out portions 
of reality in ways which do not reflect physical discontinuities. These ideas are applied to 
the treatment of cognitive categorization, of the semantics of vagueness, of Quine’s 
indeterminacy thesis, and of standard ontological problems such as Tibbles’ tail.

Abstract: The parceling of land into real estate is more than a simple geometrical affair. 
Real estate is a historical product of interaction between human beings, political, legal and 
economic institutions, and the physical environment. And while many authors, from Jeremy 
Bentham to Hernando de Soto, have drawn attention to the ontological (metaphysical) 
aspect of property in general, no comprehensive analysis of landed property has been 
attempted. The paper presents such an analysis and shows how landed property differs 
from other types of property in a way which implies a special role for political and economic 
philosophy of property rights in land.

Abstract: While Husserl sought to find room in his later writings for the surrounding world 
of human practical experience, and while similar efforts were made also by later 
phenomenologists such as Heidegger, and Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty, in none of these 
authors do we find sustained attempts to grapple with the interactions between the world 
of human thought, feeling and action on the one hand and the surrounding environment as 
this is described by physics and biology on the other. Some attempts were made in this 
regard by Gestalt psychologists such as Wertheimer, Köhler, Koffka, and Lewin, and Koffka 
and Lewin in their turn influenced two American psychologists J. J. Gibson and Roger Barker, 
both of whom (independently) conceived their work under the banner of ‘ecological 
psychology.’ It is against this background that the term 'Husserlian ecology' is to be 
understood in what follows.

Abstract: Standard definitions of the truthmaker relation in terms of necessitation fail. This 
is because there exist malignant necessitators (every contingent object is a malignant 
necessitator for every necessary truth). In my "Truthmaker Realism" (Australasian Journal 
of Philosophy, 77, 1999) I show that these standard definitions can be repaired by adding 
a second factor, in some ways the dual of necessitation, which I call ‘projection’. Projection 
imposes on the relation between truths and truthmakers the additional requirement of 
relevance or aboutness. In his "Smith on Truthmakers" (Australasian Journal of Philosophy, 
79, 2001), Dominic Gregory attempts to show that this attempt to prune the abundance of 
malignant necessitators fails. His argument reveals the existence of some unclarities in the 
prose commentary to the formal theory of my original paper. Here, however, I show that it 
does not undermine this formal theory itself.

Organism-Environment Relations”, Theory in Biosciences, 121 (2002), 139–
162. 
Abstract: The history of evolution is a history of development from less to more complex 
organisms. This growth in complexity of organisms goes hand in hand with a concurrent 
growth in complexity of environments and of organism-environment relations. It is a 
concern with this latter aspect of evolutionary development that motivates the present 
paper. We begin by outlining a theory of organism-environment relations. We then show 
that the theory can be applied to a range of different sorts of cases, both biological and non-
biological, in which objects are lodged or housed within specific environments, or niches. 
Biological science is interested in types—for example in genotypes, phenotypes and 
environment types—and in regularities that can serve as the basis for the formulation of 
laws or general principles. Types, however, can exist only through their corresponding 
tokens. Our theory of token environments is meant to plug this gap and to provide a first 
step towards a general theory of causally relevant spatial volumes.

Abstract: Mereotopology is an extension of mereology (the formal theory of part-whole 
relations) which includes also relations of boundary, countinuity and contact. Mereotopology 
faces problems when its methods are applied to objects which lose and gain parts yet 
preserve their identities over time. We offer a new solution to these problems, based on a 
theory of partitions of reality of finite grain. This theory is extended to a theory of coarse- 
and fine-grained histories (or finite sequences of partitions evolving over time), drawing on 
machinery developed within the framework of the so-called ‘consistent histories’ 
interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Reference”, Logique et Analyse, No. 169-170 (2000, published 2003), 49–

Abstract: The truthmaker theory rests on the thesis that the link between a true judgment 
and that in the world to which it corresponds is not a one-to-one but rather a one-to-many 
relation. An analogous thesis in relation to the link between a singular term and that in the 
world to which it refers is already widely accepted. This is the thesis to the effect that 
singular reference is marked by vagueness of a sort that is best understood in 
supervaluationist terms. In what follows we show that the supervaluationist approach to 
singular reference, when wedded to the truthmaker idea, yields a framework of surprising 
power, which offers a uniform set of solutions to a range of problems regarding identity, 
reference and knowledge, problems which have hitherto been dealt with on an ad hoc basis.

Abstract: Do mountains exist? The answer to this question is surely: yes. In fact, ‘mountain’ 
is the example of a kind of geographic feature or thing most commonly cited by English 
speakers (Mark, et al., 1999; Smith and Mark 2001), and this result may hold across many 
languages and cultures. But whether they are considered as individuals (tokens) or as kinds 
(types), mountains do not exist in quite the same unequivocal sense as do such prototypical 
everyday objects as chairs or people.

dealt with along the way include: modes of substance-formation, twinning, the nature of 
the intra-uterine environment, and the nature of the relation between fetus and mother.

partitions as a means for tempering the vagueness of their judgments, and we demonstrate 
how the theory of reference partitions can yield a natural account of this practice, which is 
referred to in the literature as ‘approximation’.

Abstract: We propose a modular ontology of the dynamic features of reality. This amounts,

change and process. We argue that dynamic spatial ontology must combine these two 
distinct types of inventory of the entities and relationships in reality, and we provide 
characterizations of spatiotemporal reasoning in the light of the interconnections between 
them.

Bioinformatics: A Case Study in the Gene Ontology”, BIOSILICO: Drug

Abstract: The automatic integration of information resources in the life sciences is one of 
the most challenging goals facing biomedical informatics today. Controlled vocabularies 
have played an important role in realizing this goal, by making it possible to draw together 
information from heterogeneous sources secure in the knowledge that the same terms will 
also represent the same entities on all occasions of use. One of the most impressive 
achievements in this regard is the Gene Ontology (GO), which is rapidly acquiring the status 
of a de facto standard in the field of gene and gene product annotations and whose 
methodology has been much intimated in attempts to develop controlled vocabularies for 
shared use in different domains of biology. As the GO Consortium has recognized, however, 
its controlled vocabulary is as currently constituted marked by a number of problematic 
features which are characteristic of much recent work in bioinformatics and which are 
destined to raise increasingly serious obstacles to the automatic integration of biomedical 
information in the future. Here we survey some of these problematic features, focusing 
especially on issues of compositionality and syntactic regimentation.

(2004), 247–258. 
Abstract: We propose an ontological theory that is powerful enough to describe both 
complex spatio-temporal processes and the enduring entities that participate therein. For 
this purpose we introduce the notion a directly depicting ontology. Directly depicting 
ontologies are based on relatively simple languages and fall into two major categories: 
ontologies of type SPAN and ontologies of type SNAP. These represent two complementary 
perspectives on reality and employ distinct though compatible systems of categories. A 
SNAP (snapshot) ontology comprehends enduring entities such as organisms, geographic 
features, or qualities as they exist at some given moment of time. A SPAN ontology 
comprehends perduring entities such as processes and their parts and aggregates as they 
unfold themselves through some temporal interval. We give an axiomatic account of the 
theory of directly depicting ontologies and of the core parts of the metaontological fragment 
within which they are stembedded.

heterogeneous databases as well as proprietary structured datasets have to be integrated 
into a single global customizable scheme. We will present a tool to integrate different 
biological data sources by mapping them to a proprietary biomedical ontology that has been 
developed for the purposes of making computers understand medical natural language.

Abstract: We present a new method for generating typologies of formal-ontological 
relations. The guiding idea is that formal relations are those sorts of relations which hold 
between entities which are constituents of distinct ontologies. We provide examples of 
ontologies (in the spirit of Zemach’s classic “Four Ontologies” of 1970), and show how these 
can be used to give a rich typology of formal relations in a way which also throws light on 
the opposition between three and four-dimensionalism.

Abstract: An explicit formal ontological representation of entities existing at multiple levels 
of granularity is an urgent requirement for biomedical information processing. We discuss 
some fundamental principles which can form a basis for such a representation. We also 
comment on some of the implicit treatments of granularity in currently available ontologies 
and terminologies (GO, FMA, SNOMED CT).

Abstract: The pathbreaking scientific advances of recent years call for a new philosophical 
consideration of the fundamental categories of biology and its neighboring disciplines. Above 
all, the new information technologies used in biomedical research, and the necessity to 
master the continuously growing flood of data that is associated therewith, demand a 
profound and systematic reflection on the systematization and classification of biological 
data. This, however, demands robust theories of basic concepts such as kind, species, part, 
whole, function, process, fragment, sequence, expression, boundary, locus, environment, 
system, and so on. Concepts which belong to the implicit stock of knowledge of every 
biologist. They amount to a dimension of biological reality which remains constant in the 
course of biological evolution and whose theoretical treatment requires contemporary 
analogues of the tools developed in traditional Aristotelian metaphysics. To provide the 
necessary theories and definitions is a task for philosophy, which is thus called upon to play 
an important role as intermediary between biology and informatics.

Abstract: To enhance the treatment of relations in biomedical ontologies we advance a 
methodology for providing consistent and unambiguous formal definitions of the relational 
expressions used in such ontologies in a way designed to assist developers and users in 
avoiding errors in coding and annotation. The resulting Relation Ontology can promote 
interoperability of ontologies and support new types of automated reasoning about the 
spatial and temporal dimensions of biological and medical phenomena.

Ontological Analysis of the NCI Thesaurus”, Methods of Information in 
Medicine, 44 (2005), 498–507. 
Abstract: Objective: The National Cancer Institute Thesausus is described by its authors 
as “a biomedical vocabulary that provides consistent, unambiguous codes and definitions 
for concepts used in cancer research” and which “exhibits ontology-like properties in its 
construction and use”. We performed a qualitative analysis of the Thesaurus in order to 
assess its conformity with principles of good practice in terminology and ontology design. 
Materials and methods: We used both the on-line browsable version of the Thesaurus and 
its OWL-representation (version 04.08b, released on August 2, 2004), measuring each in 
light of the requirements put forward in relevant ISO terminology standards and in light of 
ontological principles advanced in the recent literature. Results: We found many mistakes 
and inconsistencies with respect to the term-formation principles used, the underlying 
knowledge representation system, and missing or inappropriately assigned verbal and 
formal definitions. Conclusion: Version 04.08b of the NCI Thesaurus suffers from the same 
broad range of problems that have been observed in other biomedical terminologies. For its 
further development, we recommend the use of a more principled approach that allows the 
Thesaurus to be tested not just for internal consistency but also for its degree of 
correspondence to that part of reality which it is designed to represent.

Abstract: Tumors, abscesses, cysts, scars, fractures are familiar types of what we shall call 
pathological continuant entities. The instances of such types exist always in or on anatomical 
structures, which thereby become transformed into pathological anatomical structures of 
corresponding types: a fractured tibia, a blistered thumb, a carcinomatous colon. In 
previous work on biomedical ontologies we showed how the provision of formal definitions 
for relations such as is_a, part_of and transformation_of can facilitate the integration of 
such ontologies in ways which have the potential to support new kinds of automated 
reasoning. We here extend this approach to the treatment of pathologies, focusing 
especially on those pathological continuant entities which arise when organs become 
affected by carcinomas. Includes a classification of biomedical entities which revises the 
classification provided in Rosse, et al.

Abstract: A life we view as an ordered sequence of actions and events of a special kind. 
We then defend the thesis that a meaningful life is a life upon which some sort of valuable 
pattern has been imposed—a pattern which relates not merely to what goes on inside the 
person’s head, but which involves also, in serious ways, the person having an effect upon 
the world. Meaningfulness is then a special kind of value which a human life can bear. More 
specifically, it is a kind of intrinsic value – something that we value for its own sake. We 
then argue that it is crucial that, if such an imposed shape or pattern is to contribute to 
meaningfulness, then it must be the result of the person’s own efforts and of his or her own 
decisions.

Abstract: It is argued that medical science requires a classificatory system that (a) puts 
functions in the taxonomic center and (b) does justice ontologically to the difference 
between the processes which are the realizations of functions and the objects which are 
their bearers. We propose formulae for constructing such a system and describe some of its 
benefits. The arguments are general enough to be of interest to all the life sciences.

Natural Language Processing and the Integration of Biomedical Databases”, 
International Journal of Medical Informatics, 75 (3-4), 2006, 224-231.  
Abstract: The central hypothesis of the collaboration between Language and Computing 
(L&C) and the Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Science (IFOMIS) is 
that the methodology and conceptual rigor of a philosophically inspired formal ontology 
greatly benefits application ontologies. To this end r®, L&C’s ontology, which is designed to 
integrate and reason across various external databases simultaneously, has been submitted 
to the conceptual demands of IFOMIS’s Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). With this project we 
aim to move beyond the level of controlled vocabularies to yield an ontology with the ability 
to support reasoning applications. Our general procedure has been the implementation of a 
meta-ontological definition space in which the definitions of all the concepts and relations 
in LinKBase® are standardized in a framework of first-order logic. In this paper we describe 
how this standardization has already led to an improvement in the LinKBase® structure that 
allows for a greater degree of internal coherence than ever before possible. We then show 
the use of this philosophical standardization for the purpose of mapping external databases 
to one another, using LinKBase® as translation hub, with a greater degree of success than 
possible hitherto. We demonstrate how this offers a genuine advance over other application 
ontologies that have not submitted themselves to the demands of philosophical scrutiny. 
LinKBase® is one of the world’s largest applications-oriented medical domain ontologies, 
and BFO is one of the world’s first philosophically driven reference ontologies. The 
collaboration of the two thus initiates a new phase in the quest to solve the so-called “Tower 
of Babel”.

Information in Medicine, 45 (2), 2006, 204-210. 
Abstract: Objective: Clinical guidelines are special types of plans realized by collective 
agents. We provide an ontological theory of such plans that is designed to support the 
construction of a framework in which guideline-based information systems can be employed 
in the management of workflow in health care organizations. Method: The framework we 
propose allows us to represent in formal terms how clinical guidelines are realized through 
the actions of individuals organized into teams. We provide various levels of implementation 
representing different levels of conformity on the part of health care organizations. Result: 
Implementations built in conformity with our framework are marked by two dimensions of 
flexibility that are designed to make them more likely to be accepted by health care 
professionals than are standard guideline-based management systems. They do justice to 
the fact (1) that responsibilities within a health care organization are widely shared, and (2) 
that health care professionals may on different occasions be noncompliant with guidelines 
for a variety of well justified reasons. Conclusion: The advantage of the framework lies in 
its built-in flexibility, its sensitivity to clinical context, and its ability to use inference tools 
based on a robust ontology. One disadvantage lies in the complication of its implementation.

Abstract: Ontological principles are needed in order to bridge the gap between medical and

inferences across the levels of granularity which span medicine and biology, an example of 
which include the understanding of the roles of tumor markers in the development and 
progress of carcinoma. Such information integration is also important for the integration of 
genomics information with the information contained in the electronic patient records in 
such a way that real time conclusions can be drawn. In this paper we describe a large multi-
granular datasource built by using ontological principles and focusing on the case of colon 
carcinoma.

Benchmarking of Biomedical Terminologies”, Journal of Biomedical 
Informatics, 2006; 39(3): 288-298. 
Abstract: It is only by fixing on agreed meanings of terms in biomedical terminologies that 
we will be in a position to achieve that accumulation and integration of knowledge that is 
indispensable to progress at the frontiers of biomedicine. Standardly, the goal of fixing 
meanings is seen as being realized through the alignment of terms on what are called 
‘concepts’. Part I addresses three versions of the concept-based approach – by Cimino, by 
Wüster, and by Campbell and associates – and surveys some of the problems to which they 
give rise, all of which have to do with a failure to anchor the terms in terminologies to 
corresponding referents in reality. Part II outlines a new, realist solution to this anchorage 
problem, which sees terminology construction as being motivated by the goal of alignment 
not on concepts but on the universals (kinds, types) in reality and thereby also on the 
corresponding instances (individuals, tokens). We outline the realist approach, and show 
how on its basis we can provide a benchmark of correctness for terminologies which will at 
the same time allow a new type of integration of terminologies and electronic health records. 
We conclude by outlining ways in which the framework thus defined might be exploited for 
purposes of diagnostic decision-support.

Abstract: In the last two decades, WORDNET has evolved as the most comprehensive 
computational lexicon of general English. In this article, we discuss its potential for 
supporting the creation of an entirely new kind of information resource for public health, 
viz. MEDICAL WORDNET. This resource is not to be conceived merely as a lexical extension 
of the original WORDNET to medical terminology; indeed, there is already a considerable 
degree of overlap between WORDNET and the vocabulary of medicine. Instead, we propose 
a new type of repository, consisting of three large collections of (1) medically relevant word 
forms, structured along the lines of the existing Princeton WORDNET; (2) medically 
validated propositions, referred to here as medical facts, which will constitute what we shall 
call MEDICAL FACTNET; and (3) propositions reflecting laypersons’ medical beliefs, which 
will constitute what we shall call the MEDICAL BELIEFNET. We introduce a methodology for 
setting up the MEDICAL WORDNET. We then turn to the discussion of research challenges 
that have to be met in order to build this new type of information resource.

Electronic Health Records”, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 2006; 39(3): 
362-378. 
Abstract: The goal of referent tracking is to create an ever-growing pool of data relating to 
the entities existing in concrete spatiotemporal reality. In the context of Electronic 
Healthcare Records (EHRs) the relevant concrete entities are not only particular patients 
but also their parts, diseases, therapies, lesions, and so forth, insofar as these are salient 
to diagnosis and treatment. Within a referent tracking system, all such entities are referred 
to directly and explicitly, something which cannot be achieved when familiar concept-based 
systems are used in what is called “clinical coding”. In this paper we describe the 
components of a referent tracking system in an informal way and we outline the procedures 
that would have to be followed by healthcare personnel in using such a system. We argue 
that the referent tracking paradigm can be introduced with only minor – though nevertheless 
ontologically important – technical changes to existing EHR infrastructures, but that it will 
require a radically different mindset on the part of those involved in clinical coding and 
terminology development from that which has prevailed hitherto.

Abstract: The development of the Functional Genomics Experiment Ontology (FuGO) is a

genomics experiments, including the study design, protocols and instrumentation used, the 
data generated and the types of analysis performed on the data. FuGO will contain terms 
that are both universal to functional genomics experiments and those that are domain 
specific. In this way, the ontology will serve as the ‘semantic glue’ to provide a common 
understanding of data across these disparate data sources. In addition, FuGO will reference 
out to existing mature ontologies in order to avoid the need to duplicate these resources,

Taxonomies”, BMC Bioinformatics, 2006, 7: 212, PMC1482721 
Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies are among the most important computational 
resources formolecular biology and bioinformatics. A series of recent papers has shown that 
the Gene Ontology (GO), the most prominent taxonomic resource in these fields, is marked 
by flaws of certain characteristic types, which flow from a failure to address basic ontological 
principles. As yet, no methods have been proposed which would allow ontology curators to 
pinpoint flawed terms or definitions in ontologies in a systematic way. We present 
computational methods that automatically identify terms and definitions which are defined 
in a circular or unintelligible way. We further demonstrate the potential of these methods 
by applying them to isolate a subset of 6001 problematic GO terms. By automatically 
aligning GO with other ontologies and taxonomies we were able to propose alternative 
synonyms and definitions for some of these problematic terms. This allows us to 
demonstrate that these other resources do not contain definitions superior to those supplied 
by GO. Our methods provide reliable indications of the quality of terms and definitions in 
ontologies and taxonomies. Further, they are well suited to assist ontology curators in 
drawing their attention to those terms that are ill-defined. We have further shown the 
limitations of ontology mapping and alignment in assisting ontology curators in rectifying 
problems, thus pointing to the need for manual curation.

Abstract: Abstract Philosophy in the West divides into three parts: Analytic Philosophy (AP), 
Continental Philosophy (CP), and History of Philosophy (HP). But all three parts are in a bad 
way. AP is sceptical about the claim that philosophy can be a science, and hence is 
uninterested in the real world. CP is never pursued in a properly theoretical way, and its 
practice is tailor-made for particular political and ethical conclusions. HP is mostly developed 
on a regionalist basis: what is studied is determined by the nation or culture to which a 
philosopher belongs, rather than by the objective value of that philosopher’s work. Progress 
in philosophy can only be attained by avoiding these pitfalls.

Abstract: Formalisms based on one or other flavor of Description Logic (DL) are sometimes 
put forward as helping to ensure that terminologies and controlled vocabularies comply with 
sound ontological principles. The objective of this paper is to study the degree to which one 
DL-based biomedical terminology (SNOMED CT) does indeed comply with such principles. 
We defined seven ontological principles (for example: each class must have at least one 
parent, each class must differ from its parent) and examined the properties of SNOMED CT 
classes with respect to these principles. Our major results are: 31% of these classes have 
a single child; 27% have multiple parents; 51% do not exhibit any differentiae between the 
description of the parent and that of the child. The applications of this study to quality 
assurance for ontologies are discussed and suggestions are made for dealing with the 
phenomenon of multiple inheritance. The advantages and limitations of our approach are 
also discussed.

Abstract: The IPAP Schizophrenia Algorithm was originally designed in the form of a flow 
chart to help physicians optimise the treatment of schizophrenic patients in within a 
framework of guideline-based medicine. We take this algorithm as our starting point in 
investigating how artifacts of this sort can benefit from the facilities of high-quality 
ontologies. The IPAP algorithm exists thus far only in a form suitable for use by human 
beings. We draw on the resources of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) in order to show how 
such an algorithm can be enhanced in such a way that it can be used in Semantic Web and 
related applications. We found that BFO provides a framework that is able to capture in a 
rigorous way all the types of entities represented in the IPAP schizophrenia algorithm in way 
which yields a computational tool that can be used by software agents to perform monitoring 
and control of schizophrenic patients. We discuss the issues involved in building an 
application ontology for this purpose, issues which are important for any Semantic Web 
application in the life science and healthcare domains.

the assignment of identifiers are left open. The paradigm of a referent tracking system (RTS) 
recently advanced in the healthcare and life sciences environment is able to fill these gaps. 
This is demonstrated by pointing out inconsistencies in the DOI models and by showing how 
they can be corrected using an RTS.

PMC2211452. 
Abstract: A substantial fraction of the observations made by clinicians and entered into 
patient records are expressed by means of negation or by using terms which contain 
negative qualifiers (as in “absence of pulse” or “surgical procedure not performed”). This 
seems at first sight to present problems for ontologies, terminologies and data repositories 
that adhere to a realist view and thus reject any reference to putative non-existing entities. 
Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Referent Tracking (RT) are examples of such paradigms. 
The purpose of the research here described was to test a proposal to capture negative 
findings in electronic health record systems based on BFO and RT. Methods: We analysed a 
series of negative findings encountered in 748 sentences taken from 41 patient charts. We 
classified the phenomena described in terms of the various top-level categories and relations 
defined in BFO, taking into account the role of negation in the corresponding descriptions. 
We also studied terms from SNOMED-CT containing one or other form of negation. We then 
explored ways to represent the described phenomena by means of the types of 
representational units available to realist ontologies such as BFO. Results: We introduced a 
new family of ‘lacks’ relations into the OBO Relation Ontology in terms of which we were 
able to accommodate nearly all occurrences of negative findings in the sample studied.

PMC2814061 
Abstract: The value of any kind of data is greatly enhanced when it exists in a form that 
allows it to be integrated with other data. One approach to integration is through the 
annotation of multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies or ‘ontologies’. 
Unfortunately, the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies 
which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) 
consortium has set in train a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, 
including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing a process of coordinated reform and new 
ontologies being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing 
ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be 
interoperable, logically well-formed, and to incorporate accurate representations of 
biological reality. We describe the OBO Foundry initiative, and provide guidelines for those 
who might wish to become involved.

“Framework for a Protein Ontology”, BMC Bioinformatics, Nov. 2007, 
8(Suppl. 9): S1. PMC2217659 
Abstract: Biomedical ontologies are emerging as critical tools in genomic and proteomic 
research, where complex data in disparate resources need to be integrated. A number of 
ontologies describe properties that can be attributed to proteins. For example, protein 
functions are described by the Gene Ontology (GO) and human diseases by SNOMED CT or 
ICD10. There is, however, a gap in the current set of ontologies—one that describes the 
protein entities themselves and their relationships. We have designed the PRotein Ontology 
(PRO) to facilitate protein annotation and to guide new experiments. The components of 
PRO extend from the classification of proteins on the basis of evolutionary relationships to 
the representation of the multiple protein forms of a gene (products generated by genetic 
variation, alternative splicing, proteolytic cleavage, and other post-translational modifica-
tions). PRO will allow the specification of relationships between PRO, GO and other onto-
logies in the OBO Foundry. Here we describe the initial development of PRO, illustrated 
using human and mouse proteins involved in the transforming growth factor-beta and bone 
morphogenetic protein signaling pathways (http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro).

Abstract: Throughout the biological and biomedical sciences there is a growing need for, 
prescriptive ‘minimum information’ (MI) checklists specifying the key information to include 
when reporting experimental results are beginning to find favor with experimentalists, 
analysts, publishers and funders alike. Such checklists aim to ensure that methods, data, 
analyses and results are described to a level sufficient to support the unambiguous 
interpretation, sophisticated search, reanalysis and experimental corroboration and reuse 
of data sets, facilitating the extraction of maximum value from data sets them. However, 
such ‘minimum information’ MI checklists are usually developed independently by groups 
working within representatives of particular biologically- or technologically-delineated 
domains. Consequently, an overview of the full range of checklists can be difficult to 
establish without intensive searching, and even tracking thetheir individual evolution of 
single checklists may be a non-trivial exercise. Checklists are also inevitably partially 
redundant when measured one against another, and where they overlap is far from 
straightforward. Furthermore, conflicts in scope and arbitrary decisions on wording and sub-
structuring make integration difficult. This presents inhibit their use in combination. Overall, 
these issues present significant difficulties for the users of checklists, especially those in 
areas such as systems biology, who routinely combine information from multiple biological 
domains and technology platforms. To address all of the above, we present MIBBI (Minimum 
Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations); a web-based communal resource 
for such checklists, designed to act as a ‘one-stop shop’ for those exploring the range of

extant checklist projects, and to foster collaborative, integrative development and ultimately 
promote gradual integration of checklists.

“Gene Ontology Annotations: What they mean and where they come from”, 
BMC Bioinformatics, 2008; 9(Suppl 5): S2. PMC2367625 
Abstract: The computational genomics community has come increasingly to rely on the 
methodology of creating annotations of scientific literature using terms from controlled 
structured vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology (GO). We here address the question of 
what such annotations signify and of how they are created by working biologists. Our goal 
is to promote a better understanding of how the results of experiments are captured in 
annotations in the hope that this will lead to better representations of biological reality 
through both the annotation process and ontology development, and in more informed use 
of the GO resources by experimental scientists.

Abstract: Ontologies describe reality in specific domains in ways that can bridge various 
disciplines and languages. They allow easier access and integration of information that is 
collected by different groups. Ontologies are currently used in the biomedical sciences, 
geography, and law. A Biomedical Ethics Ontology would benefit members of ethics 
committees who deal with protocols and consent forms spanning numerous fields of inquiry. 
There already exists the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI); the proposed BMEO 
would interoperate with OBI, creating a powerful information tool. We define a domain 
ontology and begin to construct a BMEO, focused on the process of evaluating human 
research protocols. Finally, we show how our BMEO can have practical applications for ethics 
committees. This paper describes ongoing research and a strategy for its broader 
continuation and cooperation.

Journal for Geographical Information Science, 23 (6), 2009, 765-798. 
Abstract: This paper presents an axiomatic formalization of a theory of top-level relations 
between three categories of entities: individuals, universals, and collections. We deal with 
a variety of relations between entities in these categories, including the sub-universal 
relation among universals and the parthood relation among individuals, as well as cross-
categorial relations such as instantiation and membership. We show that an adequate 
understanding of the formal properties of such relations – in particular their behavior with 
respect to time – is critical for geographic information processing. The axiomatic theory is 
developed using Isabelle, a computational system for implementing logical formalisms. All 
proofs are computer verified and the computational representation of the theory is available 
online.

Abstract: A wide variety of ontologies relevant to the biological and medical domains are 
available through the OBO Foundry portal, and integration of these ontologies is extremely 
desirable. However, heterogeneities in naming conventions pose serious obstacles to such 
integration. We summarize a review of existing naming conventions and highlight certain 
disadvantages with respect to their general applicability in the biological domain. We also 
present the results of a survey carried out to establish which naming conventions are 
currently employed by OBO Foundry ontologies and to determine what their special 
requirements regarding the naming of entities might be. Lastly, we propose an initial set of 
typographic, syntactic and semantic conventions for labelling classes in OBO Foundry 
ontologies.

Focusing specifically on the TGF-beta signaling proteins, we describe the building, curation,

“An improved ontological representation of dendritic cells as a paradigm for 
all cell types”, BMC Bioinformatics, February 2009, 10:70. PMC2662812 
Abstract: The Cell Ontology (CL) is designed to provide a standardized representation of 
cell types for data annotation. Currently, the CL employs multiple is_a relations, defining 
cell types in terms of histological, functional, and lineage properties, and the majority of 
definitions are written with sufficient generality to hold across multiple species. This 
approach limits the CL’s utility for cross-species data integration. To address this problem, 
we developed a method for the ontological representation of cells and applied this method 
to develop a dendritic cell ontology (DC-CL). DC-CL subtypes are delineated on the basis of 
surface protein expression, systematically including both species-general and species-
specific types and optimizing DC-CL for the analysis of flow cytometry data. This approach 
brings benefits in the form of increased accuracy, support for reasoning, and interoperability 
with other ontology resources.

Abstract: The perceptual psychologist J. J. Gibson embraces a radically externalistic view 
of mind and action. We have, for Gibson, not a Cartesian mind or soul, with its interior 
theater of contents and the consequent problem of explaining how this mind or soul and its 
psychological environment can succeed in grasping physical objects external to itself. 
Rather, we have a perceiving, acting organism, whose perceptions and actions are always 
already tuned to the parts and moments, the things and surfaces, of its external 
environment. We describe how on this basis Gibson sought to develop a realist science of 
environments which will be ‘consistent with physics, mechanics, optics, acoustics, and 
chemistry’.

Abstract: The desideratum of semantic interoperability has been intensively discussed in 
medical informatics circles in recent years. Originally, experts assumed that this issue could 
be sufficiently addressed by insisting simply on the application of shared clinical 
terminologies or clinical information models. However, the use of the term ‘ontology’ has 
been steadily increasing more recently. We discuss criteria for distinguishing clinical 
ontologies from clinical terminologies and information models. Then, we briefly present the 
role clinical ontologies play in two multicentric research projects. Finally, we discuss the 
interactions between these different kinds of knowledge representation artifacts and the 
stakeholders involved in developing interoperational real-world clinical applications. We 
provide ontology engineering examples from two EU-funded projects.

45. PMC2904529 
Abstract: We propose a typology of representational artifacts for health care and life 
sciences domains and associate this typology with different kinds of formal ontology and 
logic, drawing conclusions as to the strengths and limitations for ontology in a description 
logics framework. The four types of domain representation we consider are: (i) lexico-
semantic representation, (ii) representation of types of entities, (iii) representations of 
background knowledge, and (iv) representation of individuals. We advocate a clear 
distinction of the four kinds of representation in order to provide a more rational basis for 
using ontologies and related artifacts to advance integration of data and enhance 
interoperability of associated reasoning systems. We highlight the fact that only a minor 
portion of scientifically relevant facts in a domain such as biomedicine can be adequately 
represented by formal ontologies as long as the latter are conceived as representations of 
entity types. In particular, the attempt to encode default or probabilistic knowledge using 
ontologies so conceived is prone to produce unintended, erroneous models.

Abstract: This essay concerns the problems surrounding the use of the term ‘concept’ in 
current ontology and terminology research. It is based on the constructive dialogue between 
realist ontology on the one hand and the world of formal standardization of health 
informatics on the other, but its conclusions are not restricted to the domain of medicine. 
The term “concept” is one of the most misused in literature and documentation of technical 
standards in the computer and information technology domains. In this paper we propose 
to use the term “concept” in the context of producing defined professional terminologies 
with one specific and consistent meaning, which we then propose for adoption as the agreed 
meaning of the term in future terminological research, and specifically in the development

of formal terminologies to be used in computer systems. We also discuss and propose new 
definitions of a set of cognate terms. We describe the relations governing the realm of 
concepts, and compare these to the richer and more complex set of relations obtaining 
between entities in the real world. On this basis we also summarize an associated 
terminology for ontologies as representations of the real world and a partial mapping 
between the world of concepts and the world of reality.

PMC2807365 
Abstract: Significant associations have been found between specific human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) alleles and organ transplant rejection, autoimmune disease development, and 
the response to infection. Traditional searches for disease associations have conventionally 
measured risk associated with the presence of individual HLA alleles. However, given the 
high level of HLA polymorphism, the pattern of amino acid variability, and the fact that most 
of the HLA variation occurs at functionally important sites, it may be that a combination of 
variable amino acid sites shared by several alleles (shared epitopes) are better descriptors 
of the actual causative genetic variants. Here we describe a novel approach to genetic 
association analysis in which genes/proteins are broken down into smaller sequence 
features and then variant types defined for each feature, allowing for independent analysis 
of disease association with each sequence feature variant type. We have used this approach 
to analyze a cohort of systemic sclerosis patients and show that a sequence feature 
composed of specific amino acid residues in peptide binding pockets 4 and 7 of HLA-DRB1 
explains much of the molecular determinant of risk for systemic sclerosis.

to Work”, Methods of Information in Medicine, 49 (2), 135-40. (Published 
September 2010) PMC3116518  
Abstract: Biomedical ontologies exist to serve integration of clinical and experimental data, 
and it is critical to their success that they be put to widespread use in the annotation of 
data. How, then, can ontologies achieve the sort of user-friendliness, reliability, cost-
effectiveness, and breadth of coverage that is necessary to ensure extensive usage? 
Methods: Our focus here is on two different sets of answers to these questions that have 
been proposed, on the one hand in medicine, by the SNOMED CT community, and on the 
other hand in biology, by the OBO Foundry. We address more specifically the issue as to 
how adherence to certain development principles can advance the usability and 
effectiveness of an ontology or terminology resource, for example by allowing more accurate 
maintenance, more reliable application, and more efficient interoperation with other 
ontologies and information resources. Results: SNOMED CT and the OBO Foundry differ 
considerably in their general approach. Nevertheless, a general trend towards more formal 
rigor and cross-domain interoperability can be seen in both and we argue that this trend

should be accepted by all similar initiatives in the future. Conclusions: Future efforts in 
ontology development have to address the need for harmonization and integration of 
ontologies across disciplinary borders, and for this, coherent formalization of ontologies is 
a prerequisite.

Abstract: The Salivaomics Knowledge Base (SKB) is designed to serve as a computational

Saliva Ontology (SALO) as a consensus-based controlled vocabulary of terms and relations 
dedicated to the salivaomics domain and to saliva-related diagnostics following the 
principles of the OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry. The Saliva Ontology is an 
ongoing exploratory initiative. The ontology will be used to facilitate salivaomics data 
retrieval and integration across multiple fields of research together with data analysis and 
data mining. The ontology will be tested through its ability to serve the annotation 
('tagging') of a representative corpus of salivaomics research literature that is to be 
incorporated into the SKB.

Abstract: Since 2002 we have been testing and refining a methodology for ontology 
development that is now being used by multiple groups of researchers in different life 
science domains. Gary Merrill, in a recent paper in this journal, describes some of the 
reasons why this methodology has been found attractive by researchers in the biological 
and biomedical sciences. At the same time he assails the methodology on philosophical 
grounds, focusing specifically on our recommendation that ontologies developed for 
scientific purposes should be constructed in such a way that their terms are seen as referring 
to what we call universals or types in reality. As we show, Merrill’s critique is of little 
relevance to the success of our realist project, since it not only reveals no actual errors in 
our work but also criticizes views on universals that we do not in fact hold. However, it 
nonetheless provides us with a valuable opportunity to clarify the realist methodology, and 
to show how some of its principles are being applied, especially within the framework of the 
OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry initiative.

Abstract: While classifications of mental disorders have existed for over one hundred years, 
it still remains unspecified what terms such as 'mental disorder', 'disease' and 'illness' might 
actually denote. While ontologies have been called in aid to address this shortfall since the 
GALEN project of the early 1990s, most attempts thus far have sought to provide a formal 
description of the structure of some pre-existing terminology or classification, rather than 
of the corresponding structures and processes on the side of the patient. We here present 

BARRY SMITH  
 
 
113 
 
 
a view of mental disease that is based on ontological realism and which follows the principles 
embodied in Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and in the application of BFO in the Ontology of 
General Medical Science (OGMS). We analyzed statements about what counts as a mental 
disease provided (1) in the research agenda for the DSM-V, and (2) in Pies' model. The 
results were used to assess whether the representational units of BFO and OGMS were 
adequate as foundations for a formal representation of the entities in reality that these 
statements attempt to describe. We then analyzed the representational units specific to 
mental disease and provided corresponding definitions. Our key contributions lie in the 
identification of confusions and conflations in the existing terminology of mental disease and 
in providing what we believe is a framework for the sort of clear and unambiguous reference 
to entities on the side of the patient that is needed in order to avoid these confusions in the 
future.

Biomedical Informatics, 2011 (Feb.), 44:1, 35-41. PMC2930208.  
Abstract: This paper addresses a family of issues surrounding the biological phenomenon 
of resistance and its representation in realist ontologies. The treatments of resistance terms 
in various existing ontologies are examined and found to be either overly narrow, internally 
inconsistent, or otherwise problematic. We propose a more coherent characterization of 
resistance in terms of what we shall call blocking dispositions, which are collections of 
mutually coordinated dispositions which are of such a sort that they cannot undergo 
simultaneous realization within a single bearer. A definition of ‘protective resistance’ is 
proposed for use in the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and we show how this definition 
can be used to characterize the antibiotic resistance in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA). The ontological relations between entities in our MRSA case study are used 
alongside a series of logical inference rules to illustrate logical reasoning about resistance. 
A description logic representation of blocking dispositions is also provided. We demonstrate 
that our characterization of resistance is sufficiently general to cover two other cases of 
resistance in the infectious disease domain involving HIV and malaria.

term also to support reasoning about the provenance and contents of such literature, by 
providing a representation of the philosophical domain that is orientated around what 
philosophical literature is about.

Abstract: Background: Part of the ReMINE project involved the creation of an ontology

Objectives: The ontology had to satisfy the following requirements: (1) to be able to account 
for the distinct and context-dependent ways in which authoritative sources define the term

‘adverse event’, (2) to allow the identification of relevant RAPS information on the basis of 
the disease history of a patient as documented in electronic health records, and (3) to be 
compatible with present and future ontologies developed under the OBO Foundry 
framework. Methods: We used as feeder ontologies the Basic Formal Ontology, the 
Foundational Model of Anatomy, the Ontology of General Medical Science, the Information 
Artifact Ontology and the Ontology of Mental Health. We further used relations defined 
according to the pattern set forth in the OBO Relation Ontology. In light of the use of the 
ontology for the representation of adverse events that actually occurred and therefore are 
registered in a database, we also applied the principles of Referent Tracking. Results: We 
merged the upper portions of the feeder ontologies and introduced 22 additional 
representational units of which 13 are generally applicable in biomedicine and 9 in the 
adverse event context. We provided for each representational unit a textual definition that 
can be translated into equivalent formal definitions. Conclusion: The resulting ontology 
satisfies all requirements set forth. Merging the existing ontologies, although all designed 
under the OBO Foundry principles, brought new insight into what the representational units 
of such ontologies actually denote.

PMC3189193 
Abstract: Representing species-specific proteins and protein complexes in ontologies that 
are both human- and machine-readable facilitates the retrieval, analysis, and interpretation 
of genome-scale data sets. Although existing protein-centric informatics resources provide 
the biomedical research community with well-curated compendia of protein sequence and 
structure, these resources lack formal ontological representations of the relationships 
among the proteins themselves. The Protein Ontology (PRO) Consortium is filling this 
informatics resource gap by developing ontological representations and relationships among 
proteins and their variants and modified forms. Because proteins are often functional only 
as members of stable protein complexes, the PRO Consortium, in collaboration with existing 
protein and pathway databases, has launched a new initiative to implement logical and 
consistent representation of protein complexes. We describe here how the PRO Consortium 
is meeting the challenge of representing species-specific protein complexes, how protein 
complex representation in PRO supports annotation of protein complexes and comparative

biology, and how PRO is being integrated into existing community bioinformatics resources. 
Conclusion: PRO is a unique database resource for species-specific protein complexes. PRO 
facilitates robust annotation of variations in composition and function contexts for protein 
complexes within and between species.

Abstract: The National Center for Biomedical Ontology is now in its seventh year. The goals 
of this National Center for Biomedical Computing are to: create and maintain a repository

of ontologies and terminologies in clinical and translational research; educate their trainees 
and the scientific community broadly about biomedical ontology and ontology-based 
technology and best practices; and collaborate with a variety of groups who develop and 
use ontologies and terminologies in biomedicine. The centerpiece of the National Center for 
Biomedical Ontology is a web-based resource known as BioPortal. BioPortal makes available 
for research in computationally useful forms more than 270 of the world's biomedical 
ontologies and terminologies, and supports a wide range of web services that enable 
investigators to use the ontologies to annotate and retrieve data, to generate value sets 
and special-purpose lexicons, and to perform advanced analytics on a wide range of

Abstract: This essay is a contribution to social ontology, drawing on the work of John Searle 
and of Hernando de Soto. At the center of the argument is the proposition advanced by de 
Soto in his Mystery of Capital to the effect that many of the entities which structure our 
contemporary social reality are entities which exist in virtue of the fact that there are (paper 
or digital) documents which support their existence. I here develop de Soto’s argument 
further, focusing specifically on the ontological problems raised by a family of new types of 
social phenomena – exemplified most dramatically in the domain of finance for example in 
the form of what are called ‘structured investment vehicles’ – made possible as a result of 
the employment of computer technology in entity creation. I address also Searle’s most 
recent work on social ontology, and conclude with an appendix on the theory of 
documentality advanced by Maurizio Ferraris.

are relevant to plant science, with a detailed description of the Plant Ontology (PO). We 
discuss the challenges of building an ontology that covers all green plants (Viridiplantae). 
Key results: Ontologies can advance plant science in four keys areas: 1. comparative 
genetics, genomics, phenomics, and development, 2. taxonomy and systematics, 3. 
semantic applications and 4. education. Conclusions: Bio-ontologies offer a flexible 
framework for comparative plant biology, based on common botanical understanding. As 
genomic and phenomic data become available for more species, we anticipate that the 
annotation of data with ontology terms will become less centralized, while at the same time, 
the need for cross-species queries will become more common, causing more researchers in 
plant science to turn to ontologies.

Abstract: We begin by describing recent developments in the burgeoning discipline of 
applied ontology, focusing especially on the ways ontologies are providing a means for the 
consistent representation of scientific data. We then introduce Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), 
a top-level ontology that is serving as domain-neutral framework for the development of 
lower level ontologies in many specialist disciplines, above all in biology and medicine. BFO 
is a bicategorial ontology, embracing both three-dimensionalist (continuant) and four-
dimensionalist (occurrent) perspectives within a single framework. We examine how BFO-
conformant domain ontologies can deal with the consistent representation of scientific data 
deriving from the measurement of processes of different types, and we outline on this basis 
the first steps of an approach to the classification of such processes within the BFO 
framework.

Abstract: As available intelligence data and information expand in both quantity and 
variety, new techniques must be deployed for search and analytics. One technique involves 
the semantic enhancement of data through the creation of what are called ‘ontologies’ or 
‘controlled vocabularies.’ When multiple different bodies of heterogeneous data are tagged 
by means of terms from common ontologies, then these data become linked together in

ways which allow more effective retrieval and integration. We describe a simple case study 
to show how these benefits are being achieved, and we describe our strategy for developing 
a suite of ontologies to serve the needs of the war-fighter in the ever more complex 
battlespace environments of the future.

Abstract: The Plant Ontology (PO; http://www.plantontology.org/) is a publicly-available, 
collaborative effort to develop and maintain a controlled, structured vocabulary (“ontology”) 
of terms to describe plant anatomy, morphology and the stages of plant development. The 
goals of the PO are to link (annotate) gene expression and phenotype data to plant 
structures and stages of plant development, using the data model adopted by the Gene 
Ontology. From its original design covering only rice, maize and Arabidopsis, the scope of 
the PO has been expanded to include all green plants. The PO was the first multi-species 
anatomy ontology developed for the annotation of genes and phenotypes. Also, to our 
knowledge, it was one of the first biological ontologies that provides translations (via 
synonyms) in non-English languages such as Japanese and Spanish. There are about 2.2 
million annotations linking PO terms to over 110,000 unique data objects representing 
genes or gene models, proteins, RNAs, germplasm and Quantitative Traits Loci (QTLs) from 
22 plant species. In this paper, we focus on the plant anatomical entity branch of the PO, 
describing the organizing principles, resources available to users, and examples of how the 
PO is integrated into other plant genomics databases and web portals. We also provide two 
examples of comparative analyses, demonstrating how the ontology structure and PO-
annotated data can be used to discover the patterns of expression of the LEAFY (LFY) and 
terpene synthase (TPS) gene homologs.

2013, 42(1): D415-21. 
Abstract: The Protein Ontology (PRO) formally defines protein entities and explicitly 
represents their major forms and interrelations. Protein entities represented in PRO 
corresponding to single amino acid chains are categorized by level of specificity into family, 
gene, sequence and modification metaclasses, and there is a separate metaclass for protein 
complexes. All metaclasses also have organism-specific derivatives. PRO complements 
established sequence databases such as UniProtKB, and interoperates with other biomedical 
and biological ontologies such as the Gene Ontology (GO). PRO relates to UniProtKB in that 
PRO’s organism-specific classes of proteins encoded by a specific gene correspond to entities 
documented in UniProtKB entries. PRO relates to the GO in that PRO’s representations of

organism-specific protein complexes are subclasses of the organism-agnostic protein 
complex terms in the GO Cellular Component Ontology. The past few years have seen 
growth and changes to the PRO, as well as new points of access to the data and new 
applications of PRO in immunology and proteomics. Here we describe some of these 
developments.

study of neurological diseases. ND is being developed in compliance with the Open 
Biomedical Ontology Foundry principles and builds upon the paradigm established by the 
Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) for the representation of entities in the 
domain of disease and medical practice. Initial applications of ND will include the annotation 
and analysis of large data sets and patient records for Alzheimer’s disease, multiple 
sclerosis, and stroke.

I diagnostic algorithms and new Axis II instruments. Methods: A comprehensive search of 
published TMD diagnostic literature was followed by review and consensus via a formal 
structured process by a panel of experts for revision of the RDC/TMD. Results: The 
recommended Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) Axis I protocol includes both a valid 
screener for pain diagnoses and valid criteria for the most common pain-related TMDs and 
for one intra-articular disorder. The Axis II protocol retains selected RDC/TMD screening 
instruments augmented with new instruments to better assess the interactions between 
pain and psychosocial functioning. A comprehensive classification system is also presented. 
Conclusion: The recommended evidence-based DC/TMD protocol is appropriate for use in 
both the clinical and research settings. Simple Axis I and II screening tests augmented by 
validated Axis I and Axis II instruments allow for identification of simple to complex TMD 
patients.

An Introduction to the Biological Collections Ontology and Related

(PMC3940615) 
Abstract: The study of biodiversity spans many disciplines and includes data pertaining to 
species distributions and abundances, genetic sequences, trait measurements, and 
ecological niches, complemented by information on collection and measurement protocols. 
A review of the current landscape of metadata standards and ontologies in biodiversity 
science suggests that existing standards such as the Darwin Core terminology are 
inadequate 
for 
describing 
biodiversity 
data 
in 
a 
semantically 
meaningful 
and 
computationally useful way. Existing ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology and others in 
the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry library, provide a semantic 
structure but lack many of the necessary terms to describe biodiversity data in all its 
dimensions. In this paper, we describe the motivation for and ongoing development of a 
new Biological Collections Ontology, the Environment Ontology, and the Population and 
Community Ontology. These ontologies share the aim of improving data aggregation and 
integration across the biodiversity domain and can be used to describe physical samples 
and sampling processes (for example, collection, extraction, and preservation techniques), 
as well as biodiversity observations that involve no physical sampling. Together they 
encompass studies of: 1) individual organisms, including voucher specimens from ecological 
studies and museum specimens, 2) bulk or environmental samples (e.g., gut contents, soil, 
water) that include DNA, other molecules, and potentially many organisms, especially 
microbes, and 3) survey-based ecological observations. We discuss how these ontologies 
can be applied to biodiversity use cases that span genetic, organismal, and ecosystem levels 
of organization. We argue that if adopted as a standard and rigorously applied and enriched 
by the biodiversity community, these ontologies would significantly reduce barriers to data 
discovery, integration, and exchange among biodiversity resources and researchers.

Abstract: The authors outline the way in which documents as social objects have evolved 
from their earliest forms to the electronic documents of the present day. They note that 
while certain features have remained consistent, processes regarding document

authentication are seriously complicated by the easy reproducibility of digital entities. The 
authors argue that electronic documents also raise significant questions concerning the 
theory of ‘documentality’ advanced by Maurizio Ferraris, especially given the fact that 
interactive documents seem to blur the distinctions between the static documents (or 
‘inscriptions’) which form Ferraris’s starting point, and dynamic software processes. The 
authors argue further that the Ferraris view as applied to legal documents is flawed because 
of the fact that courts may treat contractual obligations as enduring even in spite of a 
complete absence of enduring inscriptions. Finally, the authors note that traces in brains, 
another important family of inscriptions (as Ferraris conceives them), differ significantly 
from genuinely documentary inscriptions by their lack of public inspectability.

development, integration and application of cognitive ontologies”, Frontiers 
in Neuroinformatics, 8:62, 2014.  
Abstract: We discuss recent progress in the development of cognitive ontologies and 
summarize three challenges in the coordinated development and application of these 
resources. Challenge 1 is to adopt a standardized definition for cognitive processes. We 
describe three possibilities and recommend one that is consistent with the standard view in 
cognitive and biomedical sciences. Challenge 2 is harmonization. Gaps and conflicts in 
representation must be resolved so that these resources can be combined for mark-up and 
interpretation of multi-modal data. Finally, Challenge 3 is to test the utility of these 
resources for large-scale annotation of data, search and query, and knowledge discovery 
and integration. As term definitions are tested and revised, harmonization should enable 
coordinated updates across ontologies. However, the true test of these definitions will be in 
their community-wide adoption which will test whether they support valid inferences about 
psychological and neuroscientific data.

“OAE: The Ontology of Adverse Events”, Journal of Biomedical Semantics, 
July 2014, 5:29.  
Abstract: A medical intervention is a medical procedure or application intended to relieve 
or prevent illness or injury. Examples of medical interventions include vaccination and drug 
administration. After a medical intervention, adverse events (AEs) may occur which lie 
outside the intended consequences of the intervention. The representation and analysis of 
AEs are critical to the improvement of public health. The Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) 
has been developed to standardize and integrate data relating to AEs and to support 
computer-assisted reasoning over such data. OAE has over 3,000 terms with unique 
identifiers, including terms imported from existing ontologies and more than 1,800 OAE-
specific terms. In OAE, the term ‘adverse event’ denotes a pathological bodily process in a 
patient that occurs after a medical intervention. Causal adverse events are defined as those 
events that are causal consequences of a medical intervention. OAE has been used in the 
analysis of both vaccine and drug adverse event data, for example, using the influenze 
vaccine data extracted from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)

Phenotypes”, PLoS Biology, January 2015, 13 (1).  
Abstract: Despite a large and multifaceted effort to understand the vast landscape of 
phenotypic data, their current form inhibits productive data analysis. The lack of a 
community-wide, consensus-based, human- and machine-interpretable language for 
describing phenotypes and their genomic and environmental contexts is perhaps the most 
pressing scientific bottleneck to integration across many key fields in biology, including 
genomics, systems biology, development, medicine, evolution, ecology, and systematics. 
Here we survey the current phenomics landscape, including data resources and handling, 
and the progress that has been made to accurately capture relevant data descriptions for 
phenotypes. We present an example of the kind of integration across domains that 
computable phenotypes would enable, and we call upon the broader biology community, 
publishers, and relevant funding agencies to support efforts to surmount today's data 
barriers and facilitate analytical reproducibility.

human, mouse, and chicken. The resulting ontology has allowed us to identify species-
specific gaps in experimental data and possible functional differences between species, and

“Biomedical Imaging Ontologies: A Survey and Proposal for Future Work”, 
Journal of Pathology Informatics, 2015, 6:37. PMC4485195 
Abstract: Ontology is one strategy for promoting interoperability of heterogeneous data 
through consistent tagging. An ontology is a controlled structured vocabulary consisting 
of general terms (such as ‘cell’ or ‘image’ or ‘tissue’ or ‘microscope’) that form the basis for 
such tagging. These terms are designed to represent the types of entities in the domain of 
reality that the ontology has been devised to capture; the terms are provided with logical 
definitions thereby also supporting reasoning over the tagged data. This paper provides a 
survey of the biomedical imaging ontologies that have been developed thus far. It outlines 
the challenges, particularly faced by ontologies in the fields of histopathological imaging and 
image analysis, and suggests a strategy for addressing these challenges in the example 
domain of quantitative histopathology imaging. The ultimate goal is to support multiscale 
understanding of disease that comes from using interoperable ontologies to integrate 
imaging data with clinical and genomics data.

Abstract: In recent years, sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of a 
wide range of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Unfortunately, annotation and integration of 
ncRNA data has lagged behind their identification. Given the large quantity of information 
being obtained in this area, there emerges an urgent need to integrate what is being 
discovered by a broad range of relevant communities. To this end, the Non-Coding RNA 
Ontology (NCRO) is being developed to provide a systematically structured and precisely 
defined controlled vocabulary for the domain of ncRNAs, thereby facilitating the discovery, 
curation, analysis, exchange, and reasoning of data about structures of ncRNAs, their 
molecular and cellular functions, and their impacts upon phenotypes. The goal of NCRO is 
to serve as a common resource for annotations of diverse research in a way that will 
significantly enhance integrative and comparative analysis of the myriad resources currently 
housed in disparate sources. It is our belief that the NCRO ontology can perform an 
important role in the comprehensive unification of ncRNA biology and, indeed, fill a critical 
gap in both the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Library and the National

representation of small regulatory ncRNAs, which we see as the first step in providing a

Investigations”, PLoS ONE, 11(4): e0154556, April 29, 2016. 
Abstract: The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is an ontology that provides 
terms with precisely defined meanings to describe all aspects of how investigations in the 
biological and medical domains are conducted. OBI re-uses ontologies that provide a 
representation of biomedical knowledge from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies 
(OBO) project and adds the ability to describe how this knowledge was derived. We here 
describe the state of OBI and several applications that are using it, such as adding semantic 
expressivity to existing databases, building data entry forms, and enabling interoperability 
between knowledge resources. OBI covers all phases of the investigation process, such as 
planning, execution and reporting. It represents information and material entities that 
participate in these processes, as well as roles and functions. Prior to OBI, it was not possible 
to use a single internally consistent resource that could be applied to multiple types of 
experiments for these applications. OBI has made this possible by creating terms for entities 
involved in biological and medical investigations and by importing parts of other biomedical 
ontologies such as GO, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and Phenotype 
Attribute and Trait Ontology (PATO) without altering their meaning. OBI is being used in a 
wide range of projects covering genomics, multi-omics, immunology, and catalogs of 
services. OBI has also spawned other ontologies (Information Artifact Ontology) and 
methods for importing parts of ontologies (Minimum information to reference an external 
ontology term (MIREOT)). The OBI project is an open cross-disciplinary collaborative effort, 
encompassing multiple research communities from around the globe. To date, OBI has 
created 2366 classes and 40 relations along with textual and formal definitions. The OBI 
Consortium maintains a web resource (http://obi-ontology.org) providing details on the 
people, policies, and issues being addressed in association with OBI. The currentrelease of 
OBI is available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl.

Formal Ontology”, Applied Ontology, 11 (2), (2016), 103-128. 
Abstract: The notion of function is indispensable to our understanding of distinctions such 
as that between being broken and being in working order (for artifacts) and between being 
diseased and being healthy (for organisms). A clear account of the ontology of functions 
and functioning is thus an important desideratum for any top-level ontology intended for 
application in domains such as engineering or medicine. The benefit of using top-level 
ontologies in applied ontology can only be realized when each of the categories identified 
and defined by a top-level ontology is integrated with the others in a coherent fashion. Basic 
Formal Ontology (BFO) has from the beginning included function as one of its categories, 
exploiting a version of the etiological account of function that is framed at a level of 
generality sufficient to accommodate both biological and artifactual functions. This account 
has been subjected to a series of criticisms and refinements. We here articulate BFO’s 
account of function, provide some reasons for favoring it over competing views, and defend 
it against objections.

Abstract: Identification of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has been significantly improved over 
the past decade. On the other hand, semantic annotation of ncRNA data is facing critical 
challenges due to the lack of a comprehensive ontology to serve as common data elements 
and data exchange standards in the field. We developed the Non-Coding RNA Ontology 
(NCRO) to handle this situation. By providing a formally defined ncRNA controlled 
vocabulary, the NCRO aims to fill a specific and highly needed niche in semantic annotation 
of large amounts of ncRNA biological and clinical data.

Abstract: Statistics play a critical role in biological and clinical research. However, most 
reports of scientific results in the published literature make it difficult for the reader to 
reproduce the statistical analyses performed in achieving those results because they provide 
inadequate documentation of the statistical tests and algorithms applied. The Ontology of

Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS) is put forward here as a step towards solving this 
problem. The terms in OBCS cover the major types of statistical processes used in basic 
biological research and clinical outcome studies. OBCS is aligned with the Basic Formal 
Ontology (BFO) and extends the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), an OBO (Open 
Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry ontology supported by over 20 research 
communities. We discuss two examples illustrating how the ontology is being applied. In 
the first (biological) use case, we describe how OBCS was applied to represent the high 
throughput microarray data analysis of immunological transcriptional profiles in human 
subjects vaccinated with an influenza vaccine. In the second (clinical outcomes) use case, 
we applied OBCS to represent the processing of electronic health care data to determine 
the associations between hospital staffing levels and patient mortality.

Abstract: Definitions vary according to context of use and target audience. They must be 
made relevant for each context to fulfill their cognitive and linguistic goals. This involves 
adapting their logical structure, type of content, and form to each context of use. We 
examine from these perspectives the case of definitions in ontologies.

Image Ontology (QHIO): A case study using the hot spot detection problem”, 
Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 66 (2017) 129–135. 
Abstract: Interoperability across data sets is a key challenge for quantitative 
histopathological imaging. There is a need for an ontology that can support effective 
merging of pathological image data with associated clinical and demographic data. To foster 
organized, cross-disciplinary, information-driven collaborations in the pathological imaging 
field, we propose to develop an ontology to represent imaging data and methods used in 
pathological imaging and analysis, and call it Quantitative Histopathological Imaging 
Ontology – QHIO. We apply QHIO to breast cancer hot-spot detection with the goal of 
enhancing reliability of detection by promoting the sharing of data between image analysts.

representation of protein entities”, Nucleic Acids Research 45 (D1), 2017, 
D339-D346. 
Abstract: The Protein Ontology (PRO; http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pr) formally defines 
and describes taxon-specific and taxon-neutral protein-related entities in three major areas: 
proteins related by evolution; proteins produced from a given gene; and protein-containing 
complexes. PRO thus serves as a tool for referencing protein entities at any level of 
specificity. To enhance this ability, and to facilitate the comparison of such entities described 
in different resources, we developed a standardized representation of proteoforms using 
UniProtKB as a sequence reference and PSI-MOD as a post-translational modification 
reference. We illustrate its use in facilitating an alignment between PRO and Reactome 
protein entities. We also address issues of scalability, describing our first steps into the use 
of text mining to identify protein-related entities, the large-scale import of proteoform

information from expert curated resources, and our ability to dynamically generate PRO 
terms. Web views for individual terms are now more informative about closely-related 
terms, including for example an interactive multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we 
describe recent improvement in semantic utility, with PRO now represented in OWL and as 
a SPARQL endpoint. These developments will further support the anticipated growth of PRO 
and facilitate discoverability of and allow aggregation of data relating to protein entities.

Abstract: The Planteome project provides a suite of reference and species-specific 
ontologies for plants and annotations to genes and phenotypes. Ontologies serve as 
common standards for semantic integration of a large and growing corpus of plant 
genomics, phenomics and genetics data. The reference ontologies include the Plant 
Ontology, Plant Trait Ontology, and the Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology developed 
by the Planteome project, along with the Gene Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological 
Interest, Phenotype and Attribute Ontology, and others. The project also provides access to 
species-specific Crop Ontologies developed by various plant breeding and research 
communities from around the world. We provide integrated data on plant traits, phenotypes, 
and gene function and expression from 95 plant taxa, annotated with reference ontology 
terms.

part-whole relationships in BFO-conformant ontologies”, Recent Advances in 
Information Systems and Technologies (Advances in Intelligent Systems and 
Computing, 569), 2017, 184-194. 
Abstract: In the visual representation of ontologies, in particular of part-whole 
relationships, it is customary to use graph theory as the representational background. We 
claim here that the standard graph-based approach has a number of limitations, and we 
propose instead a new representation of part-whole structures for ontologies, and describe 
the results of experiments designed to show the effectiveness of this new proposal especially 
as concerns reduction of visual complexity. The proposal is developed to serve visualization 
of ontologies conformant to the Basic Formal Ontology. But it can be used also for more 
general applications, particularly in the biomedical domain.

definitions in ontologies”, Ciência da Informação, 46 (1), 2017, 73-88. 
Abstract. Ontologies are being used increasingly to promote the reusability of scientific 
information by allowing heterogeneous data to be integrated under a common, normalized 
representation. Definitions play a central role in the use of ontologies both by humans and 
by computers. Textual definitions allow ontologists and data curators to understand the 
intended meaning of ontology terms and to use these terms in a consistent fashion across 
contexts. Logical definitions allow machines to check the integrity of ontologies and reason 
over data annotated with ontology terms to make inferences that promote knowledge 
discovery. Therefore, it is important not only to include in ontologies multiple types of 
definitions in both formal and in natural languages, but also to ensure that these definitions

meet good quality standards so they are useful. While tools such as Protégé can assist in 
creating well-formed logical definitions, producing good definitions in a natural language is 
still to a large extent a matter of human ingenuity supported at best by just a small number 
of general principles. For lack of more precise guidelines, definition authors are often left to 
their own personal devices. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing the ontology 
community with a set of principles and conventions to assist in definition writing, editing, 
and validation, by drawing on existing definition writing principles and guidelines in 
lexicography, terminology, and logic.

Abstract: Immunology researchers are beginning to explore the possibilities of

are being applied in the validation of the methods used in the original studies, leveraging 
studies for meta-analysis, or generating new hypotheses. To promote these goals, the 
ImmPort data repository was created for the broader research community to explore the 
wide spectrum of clinical and basic research data and associated findings. The ImmPort 
ecosystem consists of four components–Private Data, Shared Data, Data Analysis, and 
Resources—for data archiving, dissemination, analyses, and reuse. To date, more than 300

Husserliana, 4 (1975), 219–239.  
Abstract: At the beginning of the present century, a series of paradoxes were discovered 
within mathematics which suggested a fundamental unclarity in traditional mathematical 
methods. These methods rested on the assumption of a realm of mathematical idealities 
existing independently of our thinking activity, and in order to arrive at a firmly grounded 
mathematics different attempts were made to formulate a conception of mathematical 
objects as purely human constructions. It was, however, realised that such formulations 
necessarily result in a mathematics which lacks the richness and power of the old ‘platonistic’ 
methods, and the latter are still defended, in various modified forms, as embodying truths 
about self-existent mathematical entities. Thus there is an idealism-realism dispute in the 
philosophy of mathematics in some respects parallel to the controversy over the existence 
of the experiential world to the settlement of which lngarden devoted his life. The present 
paper is an attempt to apply Ingarden’s methods to the sphere of mathematical existence. 
This exercise will reveal new modes of being applicable to non-real objects, and we shall 
put forward arguments to suggest that these modes of being have an importance outside 
mathematics, especially in the areas of value theory and the ontology of art.

Abstract: In manuscripts of 1930-1 Johannes Daubert, principal member of the Munich 
board of realist phenomenologists, put forward a series of detailed criticisms of the idealism 
of Husserl’s Ideas I. The paper provides a sketch of these criticisms and of Daubert’s own 
alternative conceptions of consciousness and reality, as also of Daubert’s views on 
perception, similar, in many respects, to those of J. J. Gibson.

Abstract: Much recent work on the intellectual background of Austrian economics reveals 
an unfortunate lack of awareness of the distinct nature of the Austrian contribution to 
philosophy, from which the Austrian economists drew many of their ideas. The present essay 
offers a sketch of this contribution, contrasting Austrian philosophy especially with the 
modes of philosophy dominant in Germany. This makes it possible to throw new light on the 
relations on Mises, Kant and the Vienna circle, and it allows us also to establish the extent

to which Austrian economics might properly be seen as being allied to the German 
hermeneutic tradition of Dilthey, Gadamer, et al. The essay concludes with a criticism of the 
hermeneutic relativism recently canvassed by some Austrian economists, concentrating 
especially on the work of Don Lavoie, whose writings are treated as symptomatic of a wider 
and somewhat regrettable trend.

(Fall 1990), 1–5.  
Abstract: We defend a view according to which Austrian economics rests on what can most 
properly be called an Aristotelian methodology. This implies a realist perspective, according 
to which the world exists independently of our thinking and reasoning activities; an 
essentialist perspective, according to which the world contains certain simple essences or 
natures which may come together in law-like ways to form more complex static and dynamic 
wholes, and an apriorist perspective, according to which given essences and essential 
structures are intelligible, in the sense that they ca be grasped non-inductively in our 
thinking. We show the consequences of this view for an analysis of the thinking of Mises 
and Hoppe, both of which – we claim – incorporate what we believe to be foreign mixtures 
of Kantianism in their account of the foundations of Austrian economics.

Abstract: The phenomenon known as ‘Pascal’s syndrome’, familiar to those who work with 
adolescents, affects a significant fraclion of adolescents who, in striving to establish 
themselves as independent adults, pass lhrough a phase in which they make utterances 
that amount lo a radical negation of everything their parents think or believe. Such rebellion 
may express itself in political, religious, economic, or sexual terms. In some cases, however, 
it leads co what can only be described as an ontological rebellion, expressing itself in 
utterances such as ‘Reality does not exist,’ or ‘The world is a gigantic conspiracy,’ and so 
forth. A very small minority of sufferers from such ontological rebellion become 
philosophers. We address the implications of this phenomenon for the present-day state of 
the humanities disciplines.

Abstract: There is an old problem in philosophy: the problem of how we pass from the 
mental theater of our representations to the external realm of concrete physical objects. 
This problem arises against the background of representationalist theories of the relation 
between mind and its objects which are marked by the following three features: 1. The 
perceiving subject is idealized. It is conceived as lying outside any context or environment 
and in abstraction from any goal-directed behavior. 2. Perception is seen as beginning with 
raw or bare sensations. Then, by a process of inference, there arise beliefs about external 
physical objects. 3. Physical objects are assumed to be out there in the world, but to be 
inaccessible to direct experience. This representationalist theory lives on in the 
computational theories of the mind and in the doctrines of methodological solipsism 
embraced by contemporary cognitive scientists. But by making perception dependent on 
sensation, and by making sensations the direct objects of experience, it has matters exactly 
upside down. The paper draws on the ecological psychology of J. J. Gibson and Roger Barker 
in order to provide the metaphysical principles of a more adequate theory.

Abstract: Initially the problems of data integration, for example in the field of medicine, 
were resolved in case by case fashion. Pairs of databases were cross-calibrated by hand, 
rather as if one were translating from French into Hebrew. As the numbers and complexity 
of database systems increased, the idea arose of streamlining these efforts by constructing 
one single benchmark taxonomy, as it were a central switchboard, into which all of the 
various classification systems would need to be translated only once. By serving as a lingua 
franca for database integration this benchmark taxonomy would ensure that all databases 
calibrated in its terms would be automatically compatible with each other. We describe one 
strategy for creating such a lingua franca, in which philosophical ontology plays a central 
role.

Abstract: Is it possible to compare civilizations one with another? Is it possible, in other 
words, to construct some neutral and objective framework in terms of which we could 
establish in what respects one civilization might deserve to be ranked more highly than its 
competitors? Morality will surely provide one axis of such a framework (and we note in 
passing that believers in Islam might quite reasonably claim that their fellow-believers are 
characteristically more moral than are many in the West). Criteria such as material well-
being will need to play a role, too, as also will happiness or pleasure (and again we note 
that it is not clear a priori that there is more happiness in the West than there is in other 

BARRY SMITH

civilizations). But even happiness (pace some proponents of the utilitarian philosophy) 
comes in different types, and to count in the civilization stakes the happiness involved would 
presumably need to be of the right kind. We explore what this might mean in terms of the 
idea of a self-chosen life plan.

Abstract: The current informal practice of pharmacometrics as a combination art and

future of the discipline and to comprehend the gaps that exist because of its absence. The

development of pharmacometric informatics has important implications for expediting 
decision-making and for improving the reliability of decisions made in model-based 
development. We argue that well-defined informatics for pharmacometrics can lead to much 
needed improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of the pharmacometrics 
process. The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of the pervasive yet often 
poorly appreciated role of informatics in improving the process of data assembly, a critical 
task in the delivery of pharmacometric analysis results. First, we provide a brief description 
of the pharmacometric analysis process. Second, we describe the business processes 
required to create analysis-ready datasets for the pharmacometrician. Third, we describe 
selected informatic elements required to support the pharmacometrics and data assembly 
processes. Finally, we offer specific suggestions for performing a systematic analysis of 
existing challenges as an approach to defining the next generation of pharmacometric 
informatics.

2008. This workshop included more than 30 participants from various backgrounds in 
biomedicine and bioinformatics. The goal of the workshop was to provide an introduction to 
the basic tools and methods of ontology, as well as to enhance coordination between groups 
already working on ontologies of cellular networks. The meeting focused on three questions: 
What is an ontology? What is a pathway? What is a cellular network?

Abstract: How do we find what is clinically significant in the swarms of data being generated 
by today’s diagnostic technologies? As electronic records become ever more prevalent – and 
digital imaging and genomic, proteomic, salivaomics, metabalomics, pharmacogenomics, 
phenomics and transcriptomics techniques become commonplace – fdifferent clinical and 
biological disciplines are facing up to the need to put their data houses in order to avoid the 
consequences of an uncontrolled explosion of different ways of describing information. We 
describe a new strategy to advance the consistency of data in the dental research 
community. The strategy is based on the idea that existing systems for data collection in 
dental research will continue to be used, but proposes a methodology in which past, present 
and future data will be described using a consensus-based controlled structured vocabulary 
called the Ontology for Dental Research (ODR).

Abstract: The goal of the Ontology Summit 2010 was to address the current shortage of 
persons with ontology expertise by developing a strategy for the education of ontologists. 
To achieve this goal we studied how ontologists are currently trained, the requirements 
identified by organizations that hire ontologists, and developments that might impact the 
training of ontologists in the future. We developed recommendations for the body of 
knowledge that should be taught and the skills that should be developed by future 
ontologists; these recommendations are intended as guidelines for institutions and 
organizations that may consider establishing a program for training ontologists. Further, we 
recommend a number of specific actions for the community to pursue.

Abstract: The 2013 Rostock Symposium on Systems Biology and Bioinformatics in Aging 
Research was again dedicated to dissecting the aging process using in silico means. A 
particular focus was on ontologies, as these are a key technology to systematically integrate 
heterogeneous information about the aging process. Related topics were databases and 
data integration. Other talks tackled modeling issues and applications, the latter including 
talks focussed on marker development and cellular stress as well as on diseases, in 
particular on diseases of kidney and skin.

Abstract: In his The Meaning of Disgust, Colin McGinn employs elements of the 
phenomenological theory of disgust advanced by Aurel Kolnai in his “On Disgust” of 1929. 
Kolnai’s treatment of what he calls “material” disgust and of its primary elicitors—putrefying 
organic matter, bodily wastes and secretions, sticky contaminants, vermin—anticipates 
more recent scientific treatments of this emotion as a mode of protective recoil. In her 
review of McGinn’s book, Nina Strohminger charges McGinn with neglecting such scientific 
studies. We here attempt to show how Kolnai goes beyond experimental findings in his 
careful description of the phenomenological differences between disgust and other emotions 
of forceful disapproval.

Theory”, in J. Odmark (ed.), Language, Literature and Meaning I: Problems 
of Literary Theory, Amsterdam: Benjamins, 1979, 373–390. 
Abstract: The paper seeks to apply the work of the Polish phenomenologist Roman 
Ingarden to certain problems in literary theory; contrasts the notions of ontological and 
epistemological incompleteness of the represented objects of a literary work and considers 
the question of the nature of such objects. The paper concludes by analyzing some of the 
degrees of freedom possessed by the readings of literary work in relation to the work itself.

1981, 113–161. 
Abstract: There is a narrow thread in the vast literature on Kafka which pertains to Kafka’s 
knowledge of philosophy, and more precisely to Kafka’s use in his fictional writings of some 
of the main ideas of Franz Brentano. Kafka attended courses in philosophy at the Charles 
University given by Brentano’s students Anton Marty and Christian von Ehrenfels, and was 
for several years a member of a discussion-group organized by orthodox adherents of the 
Brentanian philosophy in Prague. The present essay summarizes what is known about 
Kafka’s relations to the Brentanist movement. It draws on Brentanian ideas on the evidence 
of inner perception, on oblique consciousness, on active introspection, on correct and 
incorrect judgment, and on consciousness as a species of inner tribunal, in order to throw 
light on central features of Kafka’s writings, including stylistic features. Special attention is 
directed towards Die Verwandlung and Der Prozess, and a reading of the latter is offered 
according to which the trial of Joseph K. occurs entirely within the mind of K. himself.

Abstract: Reinach’s essay of 1911 establishes an ontological theory of logic, based on the 
notion of Sachverhalt or state of affairs. He draws on the theory of meaning and reference 
advanced in Husserl’s Logical Investigations and at the same time anticipates both 
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus and later speech act theorists’ ideas on performative utterances. 
The theory is used by Reinach to draw a distinction between two kinds of negative judgment: 
the simple negative judgment, which is made true by a negative state of affairs; and the 
polemical negative judgment, which is a performative utterance in which the truth of some 
earlier judgment – typically a judgment made by some other person – is denied.

Abstract: Austrian economics starts out from the thesis that the objects of economic 
science differ from those of the natural sciences because of the centrality of the economic 
agent. This allows a certain a priori or essentialistic aspect to economic science of a sort 
which parallels the a priori dimension of psychology defended by Brentano and his student 
Edmund Husserl. We outline these parallels, and show how the theory of a priori dependence 
relations outlined in Husserl’s Logical Investigations can throw light on the Austrian account 
of entrepreneurship.

1986, 150–171.  
Abstract: Christian von Ehrenfels was a student of both Franz Brentano and Carl Menger 
and his thinking on value theory was inspired both by Brentano’s descriptive psychology 
and by the subjective theory of economic value advanced by Menger, the founder of the 
Austrian school of economics. Value, for Ehrenfels, is a function of desire, and we ascribe 
value to those things which we either do in fact desire, or would desire if we were not 
convinced of their existence. He asserts that the needed theoretical understanding of values 
is to be achieved by generalizing economic laws of valuation to apply to value in general. 
The law of marginal utility, for example, is a law to the effect that the n+1st sample of a 
good which I receive is ceteris paribus less valuable than the nth sample (imagine that the 
samples in question are, for example, a series of identical ham sandwiches). The essay 
describes how Ehrenfels provides on this basis an account of the different types of values, 
both intrinsic and non-intrinsic. It outlines also Ehrenfels views on the problem of 
interpersonal value-comparisons and on the struggle for survival between different values 
of different types.

Abstract: Ernst Mach's atomistic theory of sensation faces problems in doing justice to our 
ability to perceive and remember complex phenomena such as melodies and shapes. 
Christian von Ehrenfels attempted to solve these problems with his theory of "Gestalt 
qualities", which he sees as entities depending one-sidedly on the corresponding simple 
objects of sensation. We explore the theory of dependence relations advanced by Ehrenfels 
and show how it relates to the views on the objects of perception advanced by Husserl and 
by the Gestalt psychologists.

Abstract: Provides a survey of the development of speech act theory from Aristotle through 
Reid and Peirce to Edmund Husserl, Anton Marty, Johannes Daubert, Adolf Reinach, and 
finally to Austin and Searle. A special role is played by Husserl's theory of objectifying acts 
(meaning, roughly, acts of naming or stating) and of the efforts by his followers to extend 
this theory to cover phenomena such as questioning and commanding. These efforts 
culminated in the work of Adolf Reinach, who developed the first systematic theory of speech 
acts in connection with his monograph of 1913 on “The A Priori Foundations of the Civil 
Law”.

Abstract: The ontology of language is concerned with the relations between uses of 
language, both overt and covert, and other entities, whether in the world or in the mind of 
the thinking subject. We attempt a first survey of the sorts of relations which might come 
into question for such an ontology, including: relations between referring uses of 
expressions and their objects, relations between the use of a (true) sentence and that in 
the world which makes it true, relations between mental acts on the one hand and 
underlying mental states (attitudes, beliefs), on the other, relations between my acts and 
states, associated uses of language and overt actions on my part and on the part of those 
other subjects with whom I communicate.

Abstract: The theory of speech acts put forward by Adolf Reinach in his "The A Priori 
Foundations of the Civil Law" of 1913 rests on a systematic account of the ontological 
structures associated with various different sorts of language use. One of the most original 
features of Reinach's account lies in hIs demonstration of how the ontological structure of, 
say, an action of promising or of commanding, may be modified in different ways, yielding 
different sorts of non-standard instances of the corresponding speech act varieties. The 
present paper is an attempt to apply this idea of standard and modified instances of 
ontological structures to the realm of judgement and cognition, and thereby to develop a 
Reinachian theory of how intentionality is mediated through language in acts of thinking 
and speaking.

Abstract: The essay provides an account of the development of Reinach’s philosophy of 
“Sachverhalte” (states of affairs) and on problems in the philosophy of law, leading up to 
his discovery of the theory of speech acts in 1913. Reinach’s relations to Edmund Husserl 
and to the Munich phenomenologists are also dealt with.

Abstract: The Austrian philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels published his essay "On 'Gestalt 
Qualities'" in 1890. The essay initiated a current of thought which enjoyed a powerful 
position in the philosophy and psychology of the first half of this century and has more 
recently enjoyed a minor resurgence of interest in the area of cognitive science, above all 
in criticisms of the so-called 'strong programme' in artificial intelligence. The theory of 
Gestalt is of course associated most specifically with psychologists of the Berlin school such 
as Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Kohler and Kurt Koffka. We shall see in what follows, 
however, that an adequate philosophical understanding of the Gestalt idea and of Ehrenfels' 
achievement will require a close examination not merely of the work of the Berlin school but 
also of a much wider tradition in Austrian and German philosophy in general.

McKenna (eds.), Husserl’s Phenomenology: A Textbook, Lanham: University 
Press of America, 1989, 29–67. 
Abstract: Logic for Husserl is a science of science, a science of what all sciences have in 
common in their modes of validation. Thus logic deals with universal laws relating to truth, 
to deduction, to verification and falsification, and with laws relating to theory as such, and 
to what makes for theoretical unity, both on the side of the propositions of a theory and on 
the side of the domain of objects to which these propositions refer. This essay presents a 
systematic overview of Husserl’s views on these matters as put forward in his Logical 
Investigations. It shows how Husserl’s theory of linguistic meanings as species of mental 
acts, his formal ontology of part, whole and dependence, his theory of meaning categories, 
and his theory of categorial intuition combine with his theory of science to form a single 
whole. Finally, it explores the ways in which Husserl’s ideas on these matters can be put to 
use in solving problems in the philosophy of language, logic and mathematics in a way which 
does justice to the role of mental activity in each of these domains while at the same time 
avoiding the pitfalls of psychologism.

through the hard training of his courses in Lvov. Twardowski instilled in his students an 
enduring concern for clarity and rigour. He taught them to regard philosophy as a 
collaborative effort, a matter of disciplined discussion and argument. And he encouraged 
them to work together with scientists from other disciplines — above all with psychologists, 
and also with mathematicians — so that the Lvov school of philosophy would gradually 
evolve into the Warsaw school of logic.

Abstract: My aim is to lay down some constraints on a correspondence theory of truth for 
empirical sentences of a natural language on the basis of a theory according to which that 
to which a true empirical sentence of such a language corresponds is a part of the natural 
world. The problem is to find some means of delineating those portions of the world which 
serve as correspondents, portions of reality otherwise called ‘truthmakers’.

Abstract: In der klassischen Logik von Aristoteles bis Wolff findet sich eine durchgängige 
Parallelität von logischen (einschließlich grammatikalischen und psychologischen) und 
ontologischen Gebilden. Der Logiker beschäftigt sich mit Subjekt und Prädikat, aber 
gleichzeitig auch z.B. mit Substanz und Akzidenz als Entitäten in der Welt. Nach Kant begann 
für die Logik eine Phase, in der diese ontologische oder objektbezogene Seite verloren ging. 
Gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts beginnt man dann aber wieder über die ontologischen 
Korrelate des Denkens und des Urteilens zu sprechen. Wir zeigen, dass diese 
Wiederbelebung der alten Logik mit der Einführung des Terminus ‘Sachverhalt’ in die 
Sprache der Philosophie verbunden ist.

nominalism and ‘pansomatistic reism’ to the later doctrine of ‘temporal phases’. We show 
that the surface clarity and simplicity of Kotarbiński’s writings mask a number of profound 
philosophical difficulties, connected above all with the problem of giving an adequate 
account of the truth of contingent (tensed) predications. The paper will examine in particular 
the attempts to resolve these difficulties on the part of Leśniewski. It will continue with an 
account of the relations of Kotarbińskian reism to the ontology of things or entia realia 
defended by the later Brentano. Kotarbiński’s identification of Brentano as a precursor of 
reism is, it will be suggested, at least questionable, and the paper will conclude with a more 
careful attempt to situate the Brentanian and Kotarbińskian ontologies within the spectrum 
of competing ontological views.

Abstract: Modern physics is not the science of some ultimate bedrock of reality. Rather 
(crudely speaking) it is a science which deals with a limited number of ways in which matter 
manifests itself in qualitative reality. It deals with these manifestations not, however, as 
denizens of the qualitative world, but in purified form, as quantities or magnitudes. Physics 
seeks to use mathematical devices to explain the given manifestations by showing how they 
are subject to formal laws or principles. We describe a variety of such manifestations and 
show how qualitative reality is preserved, in the physicists’ view of reality, but filtered 
through structures of a quantitative sort.

Abstract: We assume a position of scientific realism to the effect (i) that the world exists 
and (ii) that through the working out of ever more sophisticated theories our scientific 
picture of reality will approximate ever more closely to the world as it really is. Against this 
background consider, now, the following question: 1. Do the empirical theories with the help 
of which we seek to approximate a good or true picture of reality rest on any non-empirical 
presuppositions? One can answer this question with either a 'yes' or a 'no'. 'No' is the 
preferred answer of most contemporary methodologists – Murray Rothbard is one 
distinguished counterexample to this trend – who maintain that empirical theories are 
completely free of non-empirical ('a priori') admixtures and who see science as a matter of 
the gathering of pure 'data' obtained through simple observation. From such data scientific 
propositions are then supposed to be somehow capable of being established.

in Honour of Paul Weingartner, Amsterdam/Atlanta: Rodopi, 1991, 45–56. 
Abstract: What sort of set theory results when restrictions are placed on the sorts of 
elements which may form a set? Given an arbitrary relevance relation, one can formulate a 
notion of set which will apply only to totalities of mutually relevant entities. Relevance might 
signify for example: exists at the same time as, belongs to the same body as, is less than 
a certain distance from, etc. The resultant theory, which embodies topological constraints, 
can then be used as the basis for an account of relevance between propositions which is in 
the tradition of the relevant logics of analytic implication studied by M. Dunn and W. T. 
Parry.

Abstract: Recent work in formal philosophy has concentrated overwhelmingly on the logical 
problems pertaining to epistemic shortfall - which is to say on the various ways in which 
partial and sometimes incorrect information may be stored and processed. A directly 
depicting language, in contrast, would reflect a condition of epistemic perfection. It would 
enable us to construct representations not of our knowledge but of the structures of reality 
itself, in much the way that chemical diagrams allow the representation (at a certain level 
of abstractness) of the structures of molecules of different sorts. A diagram of such a 
language would be true if that which it sets out to depict exists in reality, i.e. if the structural 
relations between the names (and other bits and pieces in the diagram) map structural 
relations among the corresponding objects in the world. Otherwise it would be false. All of 
this should, of course, be perfectly familiar. (See, for example, Aristotle, Metaphysics, 1027 
b 22, 1051 b 32ff.) The present paper seeks to go further than its predecessors, however, 
in offering a detailed account of the syntax of a working universal characteristic and of the 
ways in which it might be used.

Abstract: The paper seeks to indicate ways in which the crude distinction between Anglo-
Saxon and Continental philosophy may have to be amended in light of recent developments 
in Eastern Europe. As is well known, the philosophy of science is to no small part a product 
of the universities of the Habsburg Empire (in Vienna, Prague, Lemberg/Lwow, etc.). Logic, 
too, has played a more significant role in Eastern Europe (not least in Poland) than in the 
philosophical cultures of Germany or France. For these and other reasons, a shift in the 
center of gravity of Continental philosophy is currently being realized, as younger Eastern 
European philosophers in newly liberalized institutions begin to return to their roots in their 
native pre-Communist intellectual traditions.

Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the historical roots of the analytical tradition. As 
Michael Dummett points out in his Origins of Analytic Philosophy, many tendencies in Central 
European thought contributed to the early development of analytic philosophy. Dummett 
himself concentrates on just one aspect of this historical complex, namely on the 
relationship between the theories of meaning and reference developed by Frege and by 
Husserl in the years around the turn of the century. It is to this specific issue that the 
present essay is devoted, though we attempt a more sympathetic reading of Husserl's views 
on these matters than is to be found in Dummett’s work. Topics covered include Husserl’s 
theory of intentionality, his view of meanings as types or essences of mental acts, of the 
relation between meaning and expression, of states of affairs, and of indexicality.

Husserl’s philosophy, by the usual account, evolved through three stages: 1. development 
of an anti-psychologistic, objective foundation of logic and mathematics, rooted in 
Brentanian descriptive psychology; 2. development of a new discipline of "phenomenology" 
founded on a metaphysical position dubbed "transcendental idealism"; transformation of 
phenomenology from a form of methodological solipsism into a phenomenology of 
intersubjectivity and ultimately (in his Crisis of 1936) into an ontology of the life-world, 
embracing the social worlds of culture and history. We show that this story of three 
revolutions can provide at best a preliminary orientation, and that Husserl was constantly 
expanding and revising his philosophical system, integrating views in phenomenology, 
ontology, epistemology and logic with views on the nature and tasks of philosophy and 
science as well as on the nature of culture and the world in ways that reveal more common 
elements than violent shifts of direction. We argue further that Husserl is a seminal figure 
in the evolution from traditional philosophy to the characteristic philosophical concerns of 
the late twentieth century: concerns with representation and intentionality and with 
problems at the borderlines of the philosophy of mind, ontology, and cognitive science.

Abstract: Can there be a theory-free experience? And what would be the object of such an 
experience. Drawing on ideas set out by Husserl in the “Crisis” and in the second book of 
his “Ideas”, the paper presents answers to these questions in such a way as to provide a 
systematic survey of the content and ontology of common sense. In the second part of the 
paper Husserl’s ideas on the relationship between the common-sense world (what he called 
the ‘life-world’) and the world of physical theory are subjected to a critical evaluation. The 
relation of Husserl’s ideas to current work in folk psychology and naive physics and to the 
direct realism of J. J. Gibson are also treated.

Abstract: The term ‘Continental philosophy’ designates not philosophy on the continent of 
Europe as a whole, but rather a selective slice of Franco-German philosophy. Through a 
critical analysis of the arguments advanced by Otto Neurath, the paper addresses the issue 
of why Austrian philosophers in particular are not counted in the pantheon of Continental 
philosophers. Austrian philosophy is marked by the predominance of philosophical analysis 
and of the philosophy of science. The paper concludes that it is not Austria which is the 
special case when seen against the background of contemporary mainstream philosophy, 
but rather Germany and France.

Abstract: As an object in which property rights can be invested, land is a peculiar hybrid 
structure that comprehends both spatial and non-spatial aspects. Even in its purely spatial 
aspect land is treated differently from culture to culture, thus for example in the degree to 
which property rights in land are held to relate to vague or precisely delineated parcels and 
to portions of space above and below the surface of the earth. When we examine the non-
spatial aspects of landed property, however, the dimensions of variability across cultures 
are multiplied tremendously. The goal is to provide a general framework for comparison of 
different socio-legal ontologies of land. The relevance of this project turns on the fact that 
without land (or real estate) it is difficult (perhaps impossible) to obtain credit; without 
credit it is difficult for nations to develop. Thus, if land is treated in a radically different way 
from one nation to another, this will surely exert an effect upon the development of nations.

Aesthetics of the Grazer Schule”, in L. Albertazzi (ed.), The Philosophy of

Abstract: The most obvious varieties of mental phenomena directed to non-existent objects 
occur in our experiences of works of art. The task of applying the Meinongian ontology of 
the non-existent to the working out of a theory of aesthetic phenomena was however carried 
out not by Meinong by his disciple Stephan Witasek in his Grundzüge der allgemeinen 
Ästhetik of 1904. Witasek shows in detail how our feelings undergo certain sorts of structural 
modifications when they are directed towards what does not exist. He draws a distinction 
between genuine mental phenomena and what he calls ‘phantasy-material’, asserting that 
‘the job of the aesthetic object, whether it is a work of art or a product of nature, is to excite 
and support the actualisation of phantasy-material in the experiencing subject’. We might 
think of such phantasy-material as a matter of ersatz-emotions or emotional ‘slop’. We could 
then see Witasek’s aesthetics as an elaborate taxonomy of the various different sorts of 
ersatz-emotions which the subject allows to be stimulated within himself in his intercourse 
with works of art, and see works of art themselves as machines for the production of ever 
more subtle varieties of such phantasy-material in the perceiving subject.

Abstract: In his The Sensory Order of 1952 Hayek develops a connectionist view of the 
mind that is similar to the view developed by Donald Hebb in 1949. The paper presents the 
details of Hayek’s theory in the light of subsequent developments in connectionist 
psychology. It expands on Hayek’s comparison between the mind and the price system of 
the market order, and it concludes with a series of criticisms of Hayek’s views in particular 
and of connectionism in general, focusing on the issues of active, deliberate thinking, on 
mental causality, and on the stability of human cognitive categories.

Abstract: The paper challenges the assumption, common amongst philosophers, that the 
reality described in the fundamental theories of microphysics is all the reality we have. It 
will be argued that this assumption is in fact incompatible with the nature of such theories. 
It will be shown further that the macro-world of three-dimensional bodies and of such 
qualitative structures as colour and sound can be treated scientifically on its own terms, 
which is to say not only from the perspective of psychology but also ontologically. A new 
sort of emergentist position will be defended, one which yields the basis of a method for 
describing the perceptually salient macroscopic world in mathematical terms. Broadly, it will 
be argued that the macroscopic world exists in virtue of certain specific sorts of boundary-
patterns in the field of what is captured by the theories of microphysics.

Abstract: How can two neighboring spheres be in contact, given that, between any two 
points of the continuum, an infinity of further points must be admitted? Chisholm proposed 
a solution to this paradox, which rests on a theory of the coincidence of boundaries drawn 
from the work of Franz Brentano. For Brentano, a boundary can never exist except in 
connection with other boundaries and except as belonging to a continuum of higher 
dimension. Taking Chisholm’s formalizations of Brentano’s ideas as its starting point, the 
present paper seeks to develop a general theory of topology based on mereology.

Abstract: The paper uses the tools of mereotopology (the theory of parts, wholes and 
boundaries) to work out the implications of certain analogies between the ‘ecological 
psychology’ of J. J Gibson and the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl. It presents an 
ontological theory of spatial boundaries and of spatially extended entities. By reference to 
examples from the geographical sphere it is shown that both boundaries and extended 
entities fall into two broad categories: those which exist independently of our cognitive acts 
(for example, the planet Earth, its exterior surface); and those which exist only in virtue of 
such acts (for example: the equator, the North Sea). The visual field, too, can be conceived 
as an example of an extended entity that is dependent in the sense at issue. The paper 
suggests extending this analogy by postulating entities which would stand to true judgments 
as the visual field stands to acts of visual perception. The judgment field is defined more 
precisely as that complex extended entity which comprehends all entities which are relevant 
to the truth of a given (true) judgment. The work of cognitive linguists such as Talmy and 
Langacker, when properly interpreted, can be shown to yield a detailed account of the 
structures of the judgment fields corresponding to sentences of different sorts. A new sort 
of correspondence-theoretic definition of truth for sentences of natural language can then 
be formulated on this basis.

extended in space, including in particular a sketch of Aristotle’s theory of places. The fourth 
and final part then goes beyond Aristotle to give an account of the ontology of the 
environments which constitute the everyday world of human action.

Abstract: The Matrix exposes us to the uncomfortable worries of philosophical skepticism 
in an especially compelling way. However, with a bit more reflection, we can see why we 
need not share the skeptic’s doubts about the existence of the world. Such doubts are 
appropriate only in the very special context of the philosophical seminar. When we return 
to normal life we see immediately that they are groundless. Furthermore, we see also the 
drastic mistake that Cypher commits in turning his back upon reality and re-entering the 
matrix. Not only does reason compel us to admit the existence of the external world, it also 
requires us to face this world, to build for ourselves meaningful lives within it, and to engage, 
as adults, in the serious business of living.

Abstract: The dominant theory of judgment in 1870 was one or other variety of 
combination theory: the act of judgment is an act of combining concepts or ideas in the 
mind of the judging subject. In the decades to follow a succession of alternative theories 
arose to address defects in the combination theory, starting with Bolzano’s theory of 
propositions in themselves, Brentano’s theory of judgment as affirmation or denial of 
existence, theories distinguishing judgment act from judgment content advanced by 
Brentano’s students Twardowski, Husserl and Meinong, and finally, Adolf Reinach’s addition 
of a linguistic dimension to the Brentano-Husserlian theory of judgment – an account of 
judgments as ways of doing things with words in what Reinach called ‘social acts’.

Smith (ed.), John Searle, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003, 1–

Abstract: We provide an overview of Searle's contributions to speech act theory and the 
ontology of social reality, focusing on his theory of constitutive rules. In early versions of 
this theory, Searle proposed that all such rules have the form 'X counts as Y in context C' 
formula – as for example when Barack Obama (X) counts as President of the United States 
(Y) in the context of US political affairs. Crucially, the X and the Y terms are here identical. 
A problem arises for this theory for cases involving 'free-standing Y terms', as for example 
in the case of money in a computerized bank account. Here there is no physical X to which 
a status function might be attached. We conclude by arguing that Searle's response to this 
problem creates difficulties for his naturalistic framework.

Abstract: Suppose you own a garden-variety object such as a hat or a shirt. Your property 
right then follows the ageold saw according to which possession is nine-tenths of the law. 
That is, your possession of a shirt constitutes a strong presumption in favor of your 
ownership of the shirt. In the case of land, however, this is not the case. Here possession 
is not only not a strong presumption in favor of ownership; it is not even clear what

possession is. Possessing a thing like a hat or a shirt is a rather straightforward affair: the 
person wearing the hat or shirt possesses the shirt or the hat. But what is possession in the 
case of land? This essay seeks to provide an answer to this question in the form of an 
ontology of landed property.

Abstract: The essay surveys recent developments in ontology and defends a strategy for 
improvement of ontologies based on ontological realism. As a thought experiment, we 
consider central theses of Aristotelian metaphysics, and show how they fall short of what 
we believe to be the requirements of ontology today. Above all, Aristotle provides us with 
no strategy for the reconciliation of common-sense realism and scientific realism where 
these diverge. We focus specifically on shortfalls in Aristotle’s treatment of individual 
accidents, especially in regard to the category of place. We then show how Aristotle’s 
metaphysics needs to be supplemented by a theory of holes, of fiat boundaries, of 
granularity, and of vagueness.

Abstract: We have a variety of different ways of dividing up, classifying, mapping, sorting 
and listing the objects in reality. The theory of granular partitions presented here seeks to 
provide a general and unified basis for understanding such phenomena in formal terms that 
is more realistic than existing alternatives. Our theory has two orthogonal parts: the first is 
a theory of classification; it provides an account of partitions as cells and subcells; the 
second is a theory of reference or intentionality; it provides an account of how cells and 
subcells relate to objects in reality. We define a notion of well-formedness for partitions, 
and we give an account of what it means for a partition to project onto objects in reality. 
We continue by classifying partitions along three axes: (a) in terms of the degree of 
correspondence between partition cells and objects in reality; (b) in terms of the degree to 
which a partition represents the mereological structure of the domain it is projected onto; 
and (c) in terms of the degree of completeness with which a partition represents this 
domain.

Abstract: Imagine a 5-stone weakling whose brain has been loaded with all the knowledge 
of a champion tennis player. He goes to serve in his first match – Wham! – His arm falls off. 
The 5-stone weakling just doesn’t have the bone structure or muscular development to 
serve that hard. There are, clearly, different types of knowledge/ability/skill, only some of

Philosophy of Computing and Information, Oxford: Blackwell, 2003, 155–
166. 
Abstract: Ontology as a branch of philosophy is the science of what is, of the kinds and 
structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations in every area of reality. 
‘Ontology’ in this sense is often used by philosophers as a synonym of ‘metaphysics’ (a label 
meaning literally: ‘what comes after the Physics’), a term used by early students of Aristotle 
to refer to what Aristotle himself called ‘first philosophy’. But in recent years, in a 
development hardly noticed by philosophers, the term ‘ontology’ has gained currency in the 
field of computer and information science, and in information-driven research in 
bioinformatics and related areas. We examine these new developments in applied ontology, 
and show what lessons they might have for both philosophers and information scientists.

Abstract: Otto Weininger’s Sex and Character interprets Kant’s categorical imperative in a 
way which takes it to imply that all human relations, including human sexual relations, are 
immoral; it is thus in a certain sense impossible to lead a moral life on this earth. We discuss 
Weininger’s ideas on man, woman, value and intellect, and describe their influence among 
the Central European intellectuals of his day, including Wittgenstein, and also including Karl 
Kraus.

Abstract: Against the background of a taxonomy of types of suicide advanced by Durkheim 
we propose an analysis of the phenomenon of terrorist suicide attacks. We argue that suicide 
of this sort is a specifically non-Western phenomenon. The significant difference between 
the strategy of Western terrorist groups and those terrorist groups engaged in suicide

attacks is rooted in a peculiar feature of the history and character of the West extending 
back to the Middle Ages. 
Vor dem Hintergrund einer von Durkheim ausgehenden Selbstmordarten-Typologie wird das 
Phänomen von terroristischen Selbstmordattentaten untersucht: Diese scheinen ein 
spezifisch nicht-westliches Phänomen zu sein. Der deutliche Unterschied zwischen der 
Strategie westlicher Terrorgruppen und solchen Terrorgruppen, die Selbstmordattentate 
ausüben, geht auf ein besonderes Merkmal der Geschichte und der Eigenart des Westens 
zurück; und dies wiederum ist tief im Mittelalter verwurzelt.

Objectivity of Truth”, in J. Hintikka, et al. (eds.), Philosophy and Logic: In 
Search of the Polish Tradition, Dordrecht/Boston/Lancaster: Kluwer, 2003, 
229–268. 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that the account of objective truth taken for 
granted by logicians at least since the publication in 1933 of Tarski’s “The Concept of Truth 
in Formalized Languages” arose out of a tradition of philosophical thinking initiated by 
Bolzano and Brentano. The paper shows more specifically that certain investigations of 
states of affairs and other objectual correlates of judging acts, investigations carried out by 
Austrian and Polish philosophers around the turn of the century, formed part of the 
background of views that led to standard current accounts of the objectivity of truth. It thus 
lends support to speculations on the role of Brentano and his heirs in contemporary logical 
philosophy advanced by Jan Woleński in his masterpiece of 1989 on the Logic and 
philosophy in the Lvov-Warsaw School of 1989.

Abstract: It is often claimed that the beginnings of Brentano’s ontology were Aristotelian 
in nature; but this claim is only partially true. Certainly the young Brentano adopted many 
elements of Aristotle’s metaphysics, and he was deeply influenced by the Aristotelian way 
of doing philosophy. But he always interpreted Aristotle’s ideas in his own fashion. He 
accepted them selectively, and he used them in the service of ends that would not have 
been welcomed by Aristotle himself. The present paper is an exposition of the development 
of Brentano’s ontology, beginning with the Lectures on Metaphysics first delivered by 
Brentano in Würzburg in 1867 and concluding with his late work from 1904–1917.

Abstract: In 1929 when Aurel Kolnai published his essay “On Disgust” in Husserl's ]ahrbuch 
he could truly assert that disgust was a "sorely neglected" topic. Now, however, this 
situation is changing as philosophers, psychologists, and historians of culture are turning 
their attention not only to emotions in general but more specifically to the large and 
disturbing set of aversive emotions, including disgust. We here provide an account of 
Kolnai’s contribution to the study of the phenomenon of disgust, of his general theory of 
emotions and of the phenomenological methodology he employed in his work.

Abstract: If Mont Blanc is a vague object, then its vagueness will depend on the context in 
which reference is made. In a geological context the mountain might include only rock, 
perhaps together with a certain amount of air in the crevices and tunnels which have been 
formed beneath its surface. In a context of soil chemistry we might include also a 
surrounding thin layer of organic matter. In a skiing context we might include some snow. 
This essay sketches in informal terms the theory of granular partitions, which is designed 
to do justice to this context-dependence of vagueness by means of what might be described 
as a contextualized supervaluationism. Granularity and vagueness, it is argued, are two 
sides of a single coin: what is vague at one level of granularity may appear crisp at another. 
The resultant theory can be shown to resolve certain problems in our description of 
perceptual content, for example when John says that he sees the wall, but that he does not 
see the molecules by which the wall is constituted.

Geomorphology, Chichester, England: Springer-Praxis, 2004, 75–100. 
Abstract: The shape of the Earth’s surface, its topography, is a fundamental dimension of 
the environment, shaping or mediating many other environmental flows or functions. But 
there is a major divergence in the way that topography is conceptualized in different 
domains. Topographic cartographers, information scientists, geomorphologists and 
environmental modelers typically conceptualize topographic variability as a continuous field 
of elevations or as some discrete approximation to such a field. Pilots, explorers, 
anthropologists, ecologists, hikers and archeologists, on the other hand, typically 
conceptualize this same variability in terms of hills and valleys, mountains and plains, 
barrows and trenches, that is, as (special sorts of) objects, with locations, shapes, and often 
names of their own. In this chapter, we sketch an approach to bridging this fundamental 
gap in geographic information infrastructure.

2004, 335–350. 
Abstract: We propose as a UCGIS research priority the topic of “Ontological Foundations 
for Geographic Information.” Under this umbrella we unify several interrelated research 
subfields, each of which deals with different perspectives on geospatial ontologies and their 
roles in geographic information science. While each of these subfields could be addressed 
separately, we believe it is important to address ontological research in a unitary, systematic 
fashion, embracing conceptual issues concerning what would be required to establish an 
exhaustive ontology of the geospatial domain, issues relating to the choice of appropriate 
methods for formalizing ontologies, and considerations regarding the design of ontology-

driven information systems. This integrated approach is necessary, because there is a 
strong dependency between the methods used to specify an ontology, and the conceptual 
richness, robustness and tractability of the ontology itself. Likewise, information system 
implementations are needed as testbeds of the usefulness of every aspect of an exhaustive 
ontology of the geospatial domain. None of the current UCGIS research priorities provides 
such an integrative perspective, and therefore the topic of “Ontological Foundations for 
Geographic Information Science” is unique.

J. Pasniczek (eds.), The Lvov-Warsaw School: The New Generation (Poznan 
Studies in the Philosophy of the Sciences and the Humanities, vol. 89), 2006, 
19–39. 
Abstract: Why have Polish philosophers fared so badly as concerns their admission into the 
pantheon of Continental Philosophers? Why, for example, should Heidegger and Derrida be 
included in this pantheon, but not Ingarden or Tarski? Why, to put the question from another 
side, should there be so close an association in Poland between philosophy and logic, and 
between philosophy and science? We distinguish a series of answers to this question, which 
are dealt with under the following headings: (a) the role of socialism; (b) the disciplinary 
association between philosophy and mathematics; (c) the influence of Austrian philosophy 
in general and of Brentanian philosophy in particular; (d) the serendipitous role of 
Twardowski; (e) the role of Catholicism. The conclusion of the paper is that there is no such 
thing as 'Polish philosophy' because philosophy in Poland is philosophy per se; it is part and 
parcel of the mainstream of world philosophy simply because, in contrast to French or 
German philosophy, it meets international standards of training, rigour, professionalism and 
specialization.

Rodopi, 2004, 25–39. 
Abstract: Building on the writings of Wittgenstein on rule-following and deviance, Kristóf 
Nyíri advanced a theory of creativity as consisting in a fusion of conflicting rules or 
disciplines. Only such fusion can produce something that is both intrinsically new and yet 
capable of being apprehended by and passed on to a wider community. Creativity, on this 
view, involves not the breaking of rules, or the deliberate cultivation of deviant social habits, 
but rather the acceptance of enriched systems of rules, the adherence to which presupposes 
simultaneous immersion in disciplines hitherto seen as being unrelated. The paper presents 
a demonstration of the fruitfulness of this theory by means of an account of some of the 
political, cultural and intellectual peculiarities of the Habsburg Monarchy.

framework based on principles of evaluation which would be acceptable, in principle, to all 
human beings. Morality will surely provide one axis of such a framework (and we note in 
passing that believers in Islam might quite reasonably claim that their fellow-believers are 
characteristically more moral than are many in the West). Criteria such as material 
wellbeing, too, will need to play a role, as also will happiness or pleasure. Even happiness 
(pace some proponents of the utilitarian philosophy) comes in different types, and to count 
in the civilization stakes the happiness involved would presumably need to be of the right 
kind. We propose a specification for what this ‘right kind’ of happiness might be.

139–158. 
Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid progress in the development of ontologies as 
semantic models intended to capture and represent aspects of the real world. There is, 
however, great variation in the quality of ontologies. If ontologies are to become 
progressively better in the future, more rigorously developed, and more appropriately 
compared, then a systematic discipline of ontology evaluation must be created to ensure 
quality of content and methodology. Systematic methods for ontology evaluation will take 
into account representation of individual ontologies, performance (in terms of accuracy, 
domain coverage and the efficiency and quality of automated reasoning using the 
ontologies) on tasks for which the ontology is designed and used, degree of alignment with 
other ontologies and their compatibility with automated reasoning. A sound and systematic 
approach to ontology evaluation is required to transform ontology engineering into a true 
scientific and engineering discipline. This chapter discusses issues and problems in ontology 
evaluation, describes some current strategies, and suggests some approaches that might 
be useful in the future.

Maurice Monnoyer, Metaphysics and Truthmakers, Frankfurt/Lancaster/New 
Brunswik: Ontos, 2007, 79-98. 
Abstract: This paper is a fresh attempt to articulate the role of a theory of truthmakers. 
We argue that truthmaker theory constitutes a cornerstone of good methodology in 
metaphysics, but that a conflation of truthmaker theory with the theory of truth has been 
responsible for certain excesses associated with truthmaker-based approaches in the recent 
literature. If truthmaker theory is not a component of a theory of truth, then truthmaker

maximalism – the view that every truth has a truthmaker – loses its primary motivation. 
More generally, if the task of truthmaker theory is not to provide a definition or account of 
truth in truthmaker terms, there is no pressing need for hard, a priori principles stating 
which truths have truthmakers and which do not.

Résumé: Le présent article est une tentative nouvelle d’articuler le rôle d’une théorie des 
vérifacteurs. Nous soutenons que la théorie de la vérifaction constitue une pierre angulaire 
dans une bonne méthodologie en métaphysique, mais que l’amalgame entre la théorie de 
la vérifaction et la théorie de la vérité a été responsable de certains excès associés aux 
approches vérifactionnistes dans la littérature récente. Nous montrons que la théorie de la 
vérifaction conserve son attrait comme instrument d’investigation métaphysique, et ce, 
malgré notre accord avec les doctrines défl ationnistes telles que celles défendues par Ayer, 
Quine, Field et Horwich (ou, du moins, malgré notre neutralité à leur égard). Nous soutenons 
en outre que les intuitions sous-jacentes à la théorie de la vérifaction s’éclairent quand nous 
les dissocions d’une théorie de la vérité et, par-dessus tout, de la tentative de fournir une 
défi nition de la vérité.

Social Ontology”, in Savas L. Tsohatzidis (ed.), Intentional Acts and

Springer, 2007, 155–174. 
Abstract: For much of the first fifty years of its existence, analytic philosophy shunned 
discussions of normativity and ethics. Ethical statements were considered as pseudo-
propositions, or as expressions of pro- or con-attitudes of minor theoretical significance. 
Nowadays, in contrast, prominent analytic philosophers pay close attention to normative 
problems. Here we focus our attention on the work of Searle, at the same time drawing out 
an important connection between Searle’s work and that of two other seminal figures in this 
development: H.L.A. Hart and John Rawls. We show that all three thinkers tend to assume 
that there is but one type of normativity within the realm of social institutions – roughly, 
the sort of normativity that is involved in following the results of chess – and that they 
thereby neglect features that are of crucial significance for an adequate understanding of 
social reality.

Abstract: The automatic integration of rapidly expanding information resources in the life 
sciences is one of the most challenging goals facing biomedical research today. Controlled 
vocabularies, terminologies, and coding systems play an important role in realizing this goal, 
by making it possible to draw together information from heterogeneous sources – for 
example pertaining to genes and proteins, drugs and diseases – secure in the knowledge 
that the same terms will also represent the same entities on all occasions of use. In the 
naming of genes, proteins, and other molecular structures, considerable efforts are under 
way to reduce the effects of the different naming conventions which have been spawned by 
different groups of researchers. Electronic patient records, too, increasingly involve the use 
of standardized terminologies, and tremendous efforts are currently being devoted to the

creation of terminology resources that can meet the needs of a future era of personalized 
medicine, in which genomic and clinical data can be aligned in such a way that the 
corresponding information systems become interoperable.

Memories”, in P. Rittgen (ed.), Handbook of Ontologies for Business

2007, 34–46. 
Abstract: For corporate memory and enterprise ontology systems to be maximally useful, 
they must be freed from certain barriers placed around them by traditional knowledge 
management paradigms. This means, above all, that they must mirror more faithfully those 
portions of reality which are salient to the workings of the enterprise, including the changes 
that occur with the passage of time. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate how 
theories based on philosophical realism can contribute to this objective. We discuss how 
realism-based ontologies (capturing what is generic) combined with referent tracking 
(capturing what is specific) can play a key role in building the robust and useful corporate 
memories of the future.

eine zeitliche Grenze auszuzeichnen, an der ein menschliches Lebewesen zu existieren 
beginnt? Man beachte, was geschieht, wenn wir vom Thema zeitlicher Unstetigkeit zum 
räumlichen übergehen. Lebewesen haben räumliche Grenzen (wie sie durch ihre Haut 
geformt wird). Die letzteren sind genuine Diskontinuitäten, auch angesichts der Kontinuität 
der Materie in der physikalischen Welt. Und ebenso müssen wir schließen: Das Leben 
menschlicher Lebewesen hat zeitliche Grenzen - seinen Beginn und sein Ende - die auch 
angesichts der Kontinuität physikalischer, chemischer und biologischer Prozesse, in die sie 
involviert sind, echte Diskontinuitäten sind.

Abstract: We aim to provide the ontological grounds for an adequate account of 
persistence. We defend a perspectivalist, or moderate pluralist, position, according to which 
some aspects of reality can be accounted for in ontological terms only via partial and 
mutually complementary ontologies, each one of which captures some relevant aspect of 
reality. Our thesis here is that this is precisely the sort of ontological account that is needed 
for the understanding of persistence, specifically an account involving two independent 
ontologies, one for continuants, and one for occurrents.

feature of a logically sound approach is that we have clear and functional definitions of the 
relational expressions such as ‘is a’ and ‘part of’.

Abstract: The Common Anatomy Reference Ontology (CARO) is being developed to 
facilitate interoperability between existing anatomy ontologies for different species, and will 
provide a template for building new anatomy ontologies. CARO has a structural axis of 
classification based on the top-level nodes of the Foundational Model of Anatomy. CARO will 
complement the developmental process sub-ontology of the GO Biological Process ontology, 
using it to ensure the coherent treatment of developmental stages, and to provide a 
common framework for the model organism communities to classify developmental 
structures. Definitions for the types and relationships are being generated by a consortium 
of investigators from diverse backgrounds to ensure applicability to all organisms. CARO will 
support the coordination of cross-species ontologies at all levels of anatomical granularity 
by cross-referencing types within the cell type ontology (CL) and the Gene Ontology (GO) 
Cellular Component ontology. A complete cross-species CARO could be utilized in other 
ontologies for cross-product generation.

Abstract: Consider a game of blind chess between two chess masters that is recorded in 
some standard chess notation. The recording is a representation of the game. But what is 
the game itself? This question is, we believe, central to the entire domain of social ontology. 
We argue that the recorded game is a special sort of quasi-abstract pattern, something that 
is: (i) like abstract entities such as numbers or forms, in that it is both nonphysical and 
nonpsychological; but at the same time, (ii) through its association with specific players and 
a specific occasion, tied to time and history. We discover other abstract patterns of this sort 
especially in the domains of law and commerce. This essay draws on the work in social 
ontology, and specifically on the attempts of Hernando de Soto and of John Searle to develop 
an ontology of the social world based on an analysis of the peculiar interdependence 
between quasi-abstract patterns and their representations in documents of different sorts.

Abstract: Ontologies are being ever more commonly used in biomedical informatics and 
we provide a survey of some of these uses, and of the relations between ontologies and 
other terminology resources. In order for ontologies to become truly useful, two objectives 
must be met. First, ways must be found for the transparent evaluation of ontologies. 
Second, existing ontologies need to be harmonised. We argue that one key foundation for 
both ontology evaluation and harmonisation is the adoption of a realist paradigm in ontology 
development. For science-based ontologies of the sort which concern us in the eHealth 
arena, it is reality that provides the common benchmark against which ontologies can be 
evaluated and aligned within larger frameworks. Given the current multitude of ontologies 
in the biomedical domain the need for harmonisation is becoming ever more urgent. We 
describe one example of such harmonisation within the ACGT project, which draws on 
ontology-based computing as a basis for sharing clinical and laboratory data on cancer 
research.

Abstract: We present applications of the ACGT Master Ontology (ACGT MO), which is a new

emphasizing the integration of both clinical and molecular data. The development of a new

The ACGT MO is a test case for the application of best practices in ontology development. 
This paper provides an overview of the application of the ontology within the ACGT project 
thus far.

We propose a formalization of a realist ontology using first order logic with identity and 
allowing quantification over terms representing both individuals and universals. In addition 
to identity, the ontology includes also relational predicates such as subtype, instantiation, 
parthood, location, and inherence. Inspired in part by Davidson’s treatment of events, the 
ontology includes also various relations linking events to their participants and to the times 
at which they occur. The approach allows a simulation of some of the features of second 
order logic within a classical first order framework.

In Kapitel 5 dieses Buches wurde mit dem ontologischen Sextett eine Klassifizierung der 
Realität vorgestellt, die das klassische Aristotelische Viereck erweitert, indem sie Einzeldinge 
und Universalien in insgesamt sechs Kategorien umfaßt. Zwischen den Entitäten dieser 
Kategorien sind bestimmte Beziehungen postuliert worden, wie zum Beispiel Inhärenz, 
Partizipation, Instantiierung, Exemplifizierung und Charakterisierung. In diesem Kapitel soil 
der Frage nachgegangen werden, wie eben diese Beziehungen zwischen den Entitäten dieser 
Kategorien genauer charakterisiert und die sie bezeichnenden relationalen Ausdrücke 
eindeutig formal definiert werden konnen.

Experiment Metadata in Biological Data Mining”, Biological Data Mining, Jake 
Chen and Stefano Lonardi (eds.), Boca Raton: Chapman Hall / Taylor and 
Francis, September 2009, 529-559.  
Abstract: According to the PubMed resource from the U.S. National Library of Medicine, 
over 750,000 scientific articles have been published in the ~5000 biomedical journals 
worldwide in the year 2007 alone. The vast majority of these publications include results 
from hypothesis-driven experimentation in overlapping biomedical research domains. 
Unfortunately, the sheer volume of information being generated by the biomedical research 
enterprise has made it virtually impossible for investigators to stay aware of the latest 
findings in their domain of interest, let alone to be able to assimilate and mine data from 
related investigations for purposes of meta-analysis. While computers have the potential for 
assisting investigators in the extraction, management and analysis of these data, 
information contained in the traditional journal publication is still largely unstructured, free-
text descriptions of study design, experimental application and results interpretation, 
making it difficult for computers to gain access to the content of what is being conveyed 
without significant manual intervention. In order to circumvent these roadblocks and make 
the most of the output from the biomedical research enterprise, a variety of related 
standards in knowledge representation are being developed, proposed and adopted in the 
biomedical community. In this chapter, we will explore the current status of efforts to 

BARRY SMITH

develop minimum information standards for the representation of a biomedical experiment, 
ontologies composed of shared vocabularies assembled into subsumption hierarchical 
structures, and extensible relational data models that link the information components 
together in a machine-readable and human-useable framework for data mining purposes.

Vitali Sintchenko (ed.), Infectious Disease Informatics, New York: Springer, 
December 2009, 373-395. 
Abstract: Technological developments have resulted in tremendous increases in the volume 
and diversity of the data and information that must be processed in the course of biomedical 
and clinical research and practice. Researchers are at the same time under ever greater 
pressure to share data and to take steps to ensure that data resources are interoperable. 
The use of ontologies to annotate data has proven successful in supporting these goals and 
in providing new possibilities for the automated processing of data and information. In this 
chapter, we describe different types of vocabulary resources and emphasize those features 
of formal ontologies that make them most useful for computational applications. We 
describe current uses of ontologies and discuss future goals for ontology-based computing, 
focusing on its use in the field of infectious diseases. We review the largest and most widely 
used vocabulary resources relevant to the study of infectious diseases and conclude with a 
description of the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) suite of interoperable ontology modules 
that together cover the entire infectious disease domain.

Abstract: Ontologies are today being applied in almost every field to support the alignment 
and retrieval of data of distributed provenance. Here we focus on new ontological work on 
dance and on related cultural phenomena belonging to what UNESCO calls the “intangible 
heritage.” Currently data and information about dance, including video data, are stored in 
an uncontrolled variety of ad hoc ways. This serves not only to prevent retrieval, comparison 
and analysis of the data, but may also impinge on our ability to preserve the data that 
already exists. Here we explore recent technological developments that are designed to 
counteract such problems by allowing information to be retrieved across disciplinary, 
cultural, linguistic and technological boundaries. Software applications such as the ones

envisaged here will enable speedier recovery of data and facilitate its analysis in ways that 
will assist both archiving of and research on dance.

(ed.), Transatlantic Cooperation Surrounding Health Related Information 
and Communication Technology (Studies in Health Technology and 
Informatics 170), 2011, 1-15. 
Abstract: Semantic interoperability is one of the priority themes of the ARGOS Trans-
Atlantic Observatory. This topic represents a globally recognised challenge that must be 
addressed if electronic health records are to be shared among heterogeneous systems, and 
the information in them exploited to the maximum benefit of patients, professionals, health 
services, research, and industry. Progress in this multi-faceted challenge has been 
piecemeal, and valuable lessons have been learned, and approaches discovered, in Europe 
and in the US that can be shared and combined. 
Semantic interoperability requires the use of standards, not only for EHR data to be 
transferred and structurally mapped into a receiving repository, but also for the clinical 
content of the EHR to be interpreted in conformity with the original meanings intended by 
its authors. Wide-scale engagement with professional bodies, globally, is needed to develop 
these clinical information standards. Accurate and complete clinical documentation, faithful 
to the patient's situation, and interoperability between systems, require widespread and 
dependable access to published and maintained collections of coherent and quality-assured 
semantic resources, including models such as archetypes and templates that would (1) 
provide clinical context, (2) be mapped to interoperability standards for EHR data, (3) be 
linked to well specified multi-lingual terminology value sets, and (4) be derived from high 
quality ontologies.

(ed.), Milan: Mimesis, 2012, 83-108. 
Abstract: Amongst the entities making up social reality, are there necessary relations 
whose necessity is not a mere reflection of the logical connections between corresponding 
concepts? We distinguish three main groups of answers to this question, associated with 
Hume and Adolf Reinach at opposite extremes, and with Searle who occupies a position 
somewhere in the middle. We first set forth Reinach’s views on what he calls ‘material 
necessities’ in the realm of social entities. We then attempt to show that Searle has not 
identified a sustainable position somewhere between the Humean and the Reinachian 
extremes. This is because Searle’s position is threatened by circularity, and to steer clear 
of that danger it must incorporate at least some elements of Reinach’s essentialism.

Abstract: If we are to develop efficient, reliable and secure means for sharing information 
across healthcare systems and organizations, then a careful analysis of human actions will 
be needed. To address this need, the HL7 organization has proposed its Reference 
Information Model (RIM), which is designed to provide a comprehensive representation of 
the entire domain of healthcare centered around the phenomenon of human action. Taking 
the Basic Formal Ontology as our starting point, we examine the RIM from an ontological 
point of view, describing how it fails to provide a representation of the healthcare domain 
which would enjoy the sort of clarity, coherence, rigor and completeness that is claimed on 
its behalf.

Wittgenstein and Pauler”, in Anne Reboul (ed.), Mind, Values and 
Metaphysics. Philosophical Papers Dedicated to Kevin Mulligan, Vol. 1, New 
York: Springer, 2014, 387-486.  
Abstract: As Kevin Mulligan, more than anyone else, has demonstrated, there is a 
distinction within the philosophy of the German-speaking world between two principal 
currents: of idealism or transcendentalism, characteristic of Northern Germany, on the one 
hand; and of realism or objectivism, characteristic of Austria and the South, on the other. 
We explore some of the implications of this distinction with reference to the influence of 
Austrian (and German) philosophy on philosophical developments in Hungary, focusing on 
the work of Ákos von Pauler, and especially on Pauler’s reading of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus.

Bernhard Schmid (eds.), Institutions, Emotions, and Group Agents. 
Contributions to Social Ontology, Dordrecht: Springer, 2014, 19-31. 
Abstract: The theory of document acts is an extension of the more traditional theory of 
speech acts advanced by Reinach, Austin and Searle. It is designed to do justice to the ways 
in which documents can be used to bring about a variety of effects in virtue of the fact that, 
where speech is evanescent, documents are continuant entities. This means that documents 
can be preserved in such a way that they can be inspected and modified at successive points 
in time and grouped together into enduring document complexes. We outline some 
components of a theory of document acts, and show how it can throw light on certain 
problems in Searle’s ontology of social reality.

and Computer Science”, Philosophy, Computing and Information Science,

Abstract: The discipline of ontology has enjoyed a checkered history since 1606, with a 
significant expansion in recent years. We focus here on those developments in the recent 
history of philosophy which are most relevant to the understanding of the increased 
acceptance of ontology, and especially of realist ontology, as a valuable method also outside 
the discipline of philosophy.

Abstract: Values exist not in isolation, but in complex wholes. Values are what they are 
because of the complex wholes in which they are situated. To do justice to this thesis will 
require a holistic ontology, a theory according to which many types of entities exist only as 
inseparable parts or moments of wider contexts or environments. An ontological theory of 
environments – with roots in Gestalt psychology and the ecological psychology of J. J. 
Gibson and Roger Barker, and which is related also to the theory of motivation sketched by 
Edmund Husserl as part of his theory of the lifeworld or Lebenswelt – will help us to 
understand the ontology of values. It will help us also to understand what values are. It will 
not, however, tell us what is good or bad. From facts of ontology, no value propositions 
follow.

Abstract: If media studies are to become established as a genuine science, then it needs 
to be determined what the subject matter of this science is to be. I propose a specification 
of this subject matter as consisting in: 1. the new sorts of digital entities that have been 
added to social reality through the invention of the digital computer, and 2. the new sorts 
of interactions involving human beings which such entities make possible. I support this 
proposal by examining examples of some of the ways in which the digital products of 
emerging media differ from entities of other sorts. I then draw consequences from this 
examination to demonstrate how these products mark out a new realm within the larger 
domain of social ontology. 
 
PAPERS IN CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 
 
1. Barry Smith, “Wittgenstein and the Background of Austrian Philosophy”, 
in E. Leinfellner, et al. (eds.), Wittgenstein and His Impact on Contemporary 
Thought, Vienna: Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, Dordrecht: Reidel, 1978, 31–35. 
Abstract: Surveys the evidence for an influence of Austrian philosophers – specifically 
Brentano, Meinong, Husserl, Twardowski and Mach – on the early Wittgenstein. Such 
influence might either have been direct, for instance through Wittgenstein’s reading of Mach, 
or indirect, through the mediation of Russell and Moore. The paper concludes by addressing 
the possible influence of Stumpf and Reinach on Wittgenstein’s technical usage of the term 
‘Sachverhalt’ in the Tractatus. 
2. Barry Smith, “On Tractarian Law”, in H. Berghel, et al. (eds.), 
Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle and Critical Rationalism, Vienna: Hölder-
Pichler-Tempsky, Dordrecht: Reidel, 1979, 31–35. 
Abstract: ‘It is clear’, wrote Wittgenstein in the Tractatus, ‘that ethics has nothing to do 
with punishment and reward in the usual sense of the terms’ (6.422). But he insisted also 
that there must be some kind of ethical punisment and reward; ‘the reward,’ he tells us, 
‘must be something pleasant, and the punishment something unpleasant’. I attempt to 
interpret Wittgenstein’s intentions here as a modification of ethico-legal views we find in

Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and Weininger. ‘Reward’ and ‘punishment’ are conceived as 
elements in an ideal legal system, of which existing penal law and the divine law would be 
special cases.

Abstract: A brief study of the logical, linguistic, psychological and ontological problem of 
‘impersonalia’, which is to say of assertions such as ‘it’s raining’ or ‘es blitzt’ which seem to 
have no subject. Such assertions cause problems not only for defenders of traditional 
subject-predicate views of assertive sentences, but also for those, such as Frege, who 
defended a view in terms of functions and arguments.

Abstract: A preliminary statement of the formal theory of the truthmaker relation advanced 
in the paper “Truth-makers” (Mulligan, Simons and Smith) in 1984. Correspondence 
theories of truth have. I give a brief account of some more or less obvious formal 
characteristics of this almost forgotten basic truthmaker relation. I then attempt to show 
how this account may be extended to provide elements of a theory of truth which is in 
keeping with the spirit of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus.

Abstract: Defends a view of intentional directedness according to which those seemingly 
object-directed acts – involved for example in reading works of fiction – which lack existing 
objects as targets, are not intentional (thus: not directed towards any object). Rather, each 
such act seems to its subject as if it were so directed because it is associated with a belief 
of a certain special sort, whose intentional directedness is not towards any putative external 
object but rather towards the very act itself with which the belief is associated.

The Gestalt tradition was initiated in 1890 by Christian von Ehrenfels with his essay “On 
Gestalt Qualities”. We describe how Ehrenfels and other thinkers in the tradition stretching 
from Brentano, Meinong and Ehrenfels to Benussi, held different views of the the way in 
which the organized structure which is the object of perception – for example a melody or 
pattern of colors – relates to the physiological processing on the side of the perceiver on 
the one hand, and to the objects in the world – for example single tones or patches of color. 
We focus particularly on the problem of the objectivity of perceptual Gestalten and on the 
contrast between the so-called Graz school of Meinong and Benussi and the Berlin school of 
Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka.

Abstract: The present essay seeks, by way of the Austrian example, to make a contribution 
to what might be called the philosophy of the supranational state. More specifically, we shall 
attempt to use certain ideas on the philosophy of Gestalten as a basis for understanding 
some aspects of that political and cultural phenomenon which was variously called the 
Austrian Empire, the Habsburg Empire, the Danube Monarchy or Kakanien.

Commentary”, in R. Haller and J. Brandl (eds.), Wittgenstein: Towards a Re-

Abstract: The commentary is a form of literature that once predominated in all major 
philosophical cultures, from classical China to Renaissance Italy. Commentaries on the 
writings of German thinkers such as Kant, Hegel, Marx and Heidegger have kept the form 
alive to some extent in recent centuries; but among contemporary philosophers in the 
analytic mainstream it is a form that is almost never used. Why then, among philosophers 
in the analytic tradition, should the writings of Wittgenstein have spawned the growth of a 
commentary literature? What are the marks of an author, and of the surrounding culture, 
which spawn such growth?

Abstract: Human cognitive acts are directed towards entities of a wide range of different 
types. What follows is a new proposal for bringing order into this typological clutter. The 
starting point for our categorial scheme is the concept of extended entity. Two sorts of 
extended entity are initially distinguished: objects, which are extended in space; and 
processes, which are extended in time. Examples of objects are: you and I. Objects are 
possessed of divisible bulk: they can be divided, in reality or in thought, into spatial parts. 
Examples of processes are: your life and my current headache. It is unproblematic that both 
objects and processes have outer boundaries: the exterior surface of your skin; the 
beginning and the ending of your life. Here however we focus on what we can think of as 
inner boundaries – the boundary dividing your upper and lower torso? Or the boundary 
dividing your life before from your life after your fourteenth birthday?

Eschenbach, C. Habel and B. Smith (eds.), Topological Foundations of 
Cognitive Science, Hamburg: Graduiertenkolleg Kognitionswissenschaft,

Abstract: The paper introduces the concepts at the heart of point-set-topology and of 
mereotopology (topology founded in the non-atomistic theory of parts and wholes) in an 
informal and intuitive fashion. It will then seek to demonstrate how mereotopological ideas 
can be of particular utility in cognitive science applications. The prehistory of such 
applications (in the work of Husserl, the Gestaltists, of Kurt Lewin and of J. J. Gibson) will 
be sketched, together with an indication of the field of possibilities in linguistics, perceptual 
psychology, categorization and geographic information systems. Topological structures will 
be shown to play a central role in studies of naive physics not least in virtue of the fact that 
even well-attested departures from true physics on the part of common sense leave the 
topology and vectorial orientation of the underlying physical phenomena invariant: our 
common sense would thus seem to have a veridical grasp of the topology and broad general 
orientation of physical phenomena, both static and dynamic, even where it illegitimately 
modifies the relevant shape and metric properties. The implications of this and related 
insights for the methodology of psychology will be explored.

(Lecture Notes in Computer Science 988), Berlin/Heidelberg/New York, etc.: 
Springer, 1995, 475–484.  
Abstract: The paper is an exercise in descriptive ontology, with specific applications to 
problems in the geographical sphere. It presents a general typology of spatial boundaries, 
based in particular on an opposition between bona fide or physical boundaries on the one 
hand, and fiat or human-demarcation-induced boundaries on the other. Cross-cutting this 
opposition are further oppositions in the realm of boundaries, for example between: crisp 
and indeterminate, complete and incomplete, enduring and transient, symmetrical and 
asymmetrical. The resulting typology generates a corresponding categorization of the 
different sorts of objects which (complete) boundaries determine or demarcate. The theory 
is applied first of all in the areas of geography and of administrative and property law. 
Indications are then given as to how the typology may be applied also in other fields where 
physical and fiat boundaries are at work, including the field of cognitive linguistics and the 
related field of the ontology of truth.

Philosophy, Vienna: Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, 1995, 300–309. 
Abstract: Just as some have argued that the folk-psychological ontology of beliefs, desires, 
etc. yields the best explanation we can have of the order of cognitive phenomena conceived 
from the perspective of first-person experience, so we argue here that (1) the 
commonsensical ontology of folk physics yi~lds the best explanation we can have of our 
externally directed cognitive experience and that (2) an ontology of mesoscopic things, 
events and processes must pl~y a role, iI\ particular, in our best scientific theory of human 
action.

Abstract: Why does ‘ethnic cleansing’ occur? Why does the rise of nationalist feeling in 
Europe and of Black separatist movements in the United States often go hand in hand with 
an upsurge of anti-Semitism? Why do some mixings of distinct religious and ethnic groups 
succeed, where others (for example in Northern Ireland, or in Bosnia) fail so 
catastrophically? Why do phrases like ‘balkanisation’, ‘dismemberment’, ‘mutilation’, 
‘violation of the motherland’ occur so often in warmongering rhetoric? All of these questions 
are, it will turn out, connected. To understand how they are connected we we will need to 
examine how human beings acquire a relationship to specific chunks of land, a relationship 
that is emotionally so strong that they are prepared to die – or kill – to protect that land for 
themselves or to win it back from others. Territoriality, the biologically rooted predisposition 
to defend core areas of home ranges against intruders, is a near-universal phenomenon 
amongst animals of all species. But the ways in which defended territories are conceived 
and demarcated differ widely from species to species and from group to group. By coming 
to an understanding of the geometry of these differences we can come to understand also 
some of the factors which give rise to interethnic conflict.

Abstract: Human cognitive acts are directed towards objects extended in space of a wide 
range of different types. What follows is a new proposal for bringing order into this 
typological clutter. The theory of spatially extended objects should make room not only for 
the objects of physics but also for objects at higher levels, including the objects of geography 
and of related disciplines. It should leave room for different types of boundaries, including 
both the bona fide boundaries which we find in the physical world and the fiat (or human-
demarcation-induced) boundaries with which much of geography has to deal. Two distinct 
axiomatic theories of boundaries are accordingly presented, and the need for both is 
examined in some detail. The resultant dual framework is shown to have application above 
all for our understanding of issues involving contact, division, and separation, issues which 
have posed serious difficulties for the ontological theories of boundaries that have been 
proposed hitherto.

(ed.), Formal Ontology in Information Systems, Amsterdam, Oxford, Tokyo, 
Washington, DC: IOS Press (Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and 
Applications), 1998, 19–28. 
Abstract: The term ‘formal ontology’ was first used by the philosopher Edmund Husserl in 
his Logical Investigations to signify the study of those formal structures and relations – 
above all relations of part and whole – which are exemplified in the subject-matters of the 
different material sciences. We follow Husserl in presenting the basic concepts of formal 
ontology as falling into three groups: the theory of part and whole, the theory of 
dependence, and the theory of boundary, continuity and contact. These basic concepts are 
presented in relation to the problem of providing an account of the formal ontology of the 
mesoscopic realm of everyday experience, and specifically of providing an account of the 
concept of individual substance.

the theory of location, and the question of the interaction of these three domains within a 
unified spatial representation theory is addressed. In the final part we also consider the idea 
of non-standard geographies, which may be associated with geography under a classical

used English-speaking subjects to test our hypotheses. Our experiments show geographic 
categories to be similar to their non-geographic counterparts in the ways in which they 
generate instances of different relative frequencies at different levels. Other tests, however, 
provide preliminary evidence for the existence of important differences in subjects’ 
categorizations of geographic and non-geographic objects, and suggest further 
experimental work especially with regard to the role in cognitive categorization of different

Abstract: Where some have attempted to apply cognitive methods to the study of 
geography, the present paper is designed to serve as a starting point for applying methods 
of geographic ontology to the phenomena of cognition. Agglomerations are aggregates of 
entities that are dispersed through space on geographic scales. Examples include: plagues, 
biological species, major world religions. The paper applies standard mereotopological 
theories of spatial regions to agglomerations in this sense. It offers the beginnings of a 
general theory of the relations between social, cultural, ethnic and religious agglomerations 
on the one hand and territorially demarcated spatial objects on the other. In this way it 
serves as the basis for a general ontological theory of types of human groups and also of 
types of conflict between these groups. At the same time it provides ontological foundations 
for the epidemiological study of cognitive phenomena, and especially of cognitive 
phenomena in the sociopolitical realm.

it deals with the ontology of ecological contexts (niches, habitats, environments, ambients) 
and of the relations between organisms, niches, and the spatial regions they occupy. The

theory which builds upon notions and principles of mereology, topology, and the theory of

Abstract: Information may be defined as the conceptual or communicable part of the 
content of mental acts. The content of mental acts includes sensory data as well as concepts, 
particular as well as general information. An information system is an external (non-mental) 
system designed to store such content. Information systems afford indirect transmission of 
content between people, some of whom may put information into the system and others 
who are among those who use the system. In order for communication to happen, the 
conceptual systems of the originators and users of the information must be sufficiently 
similar. A formal conceptual framework that can provide the basis for exchange of 
information is termed an ontology. In its most fundamental form, ontology studies the most 
basic constituents of reality. Traditionally, ontology seeks to reflects structures that are 
independent of thought and cognition. The term ontology is used more broadly in artificial 
intelligence and software engineering, to refer to the conceptual basis for an information 
system.

scientists on concepts such as territory, habitat and niche.

Abstract: The Renaissance architect, moral philosopher, cryptographer, mathematician, 
Papal adviser, painter, city planner and land surveyor Leon Battista Alberti provided the 
theoretical foundations of modern perspective geometry. Alberti’s work on perspective 
exerted a powerful influence on painters of the stature of Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci 
and Piero della Francesca. But his Della pittura of 1435–36 contains also a hitherto 
unrecognized ontology of pictorial projection. We sketch this ontology, and show how it can 
be generalized to apply to representative devices in general, including maps and spatial and 
non-spatial databases.

Abstract: Two hundred and sixty-three subjects each gave examples for one of five 
geographic categories: geographic features, geographic objects, geographic concepts, 
something geographic, and something that could be portrayed on a map. The frequencies 
of various responses were significantly different, indicating that the basic ontological terms 
feature, object, etc., are not interchangeable but carry different meanings when combined 
with adjectives indicating geographic or mappable. For all of the test phrases involving 
geographic, responses were predominantly natural features such as mountain, river, lake, 
ocean, hill. Artificial geographic features such as town and city were listed hardly at all for 
geographic categories, an outcome that contrasts sharply with the disciplinary self-
understanding of academic geography. However, geographic artifacts and fiat objects, such 
as roads, cities, boundaries, countries, and states, were frequently listed by the subjects 
responding to the phrase something that could be portrayed on a map. In this paper, we 
present the results of these experiments in visual form, and provide interpretations and 
implications for further research.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a formal theory of partitions (ways of dividing up or 
sorting or mapping reality) and we show how the theory can be applied in the geospatial 
domain. We characterize partitions at two levels: as systems of cells (theory A), and in 
terms of their projective relation to reality (theory B). We lay down conditions of well-
formedness for partitions and we define what it means for partitions to project truly onto 
reality. We continue by classifying well-formed partitions along three axes: (a) degree of 
correspondence between partition cells and objects in reality; (b) degree to which a partition 
represents the mereological structure of the domain it is projected onto; and (c) degree of 
completeness and exhaustiveness with which a partition represents reality. This 
classification is used to characterize three types of partitions that play an important role in 
spatial information science: cadastral partitions, categorical coverages, and the partitions 
involved in folk categorizations of the geospatial domain.

how the term ‘ontology’ is currently used. We conclude by suggesting some grounds for 
optimism as concerns the future collaboration between philosophical ontologists and 
information scientists.

A General Ontological Language”, in Christopher Welty and Barry Smith

Abstract: Every domain-specific ontology must use as a framework some upper-level 
ontology which describes the most general, domain-independent categories of reality. In 
the present paper we sketch a new type of upper-level ontology, which is intended to be 
the basis of a knowledge modelling language GOL (for: 'General Ontological Language'). It 
turns out that the upper-level ontology underlying standard modelling languages such as 
KIF, F-Logic and CycL is restricted to the ontology of sets. Set theory has considerable 
mathematical power and great flexibility as a framework for modelling different sorts of 
structures. At the same time it has the disadvantage that sets are abstract entities (entities 
existing outside the realm of time, space and causality), and thus a set-theoretical 
framework should be supplemented by some other machinery if it is to support applications 
in the ripe, messy world of concrete objects. In the present paper we partition the entities 
of the real world into sets and urelements, and then we introduce several new ontological 
relations between these urelements. In contrast to standard modelling and representation

formalisms, the concepts of GOL provide a machinery for representing and analysing such 
ontologically basic relations.

Abstract: The parceling of land into real estate is more than a simple geometrical affair. 
Real estate is a historical product of interaction between human beings, political, legal and 
economic institutions, and the physical environment. And while many authors, from Jeremy 
Bentham to Hernando de Soto, have drawn attention to the ontological (metaphysical) 
aspect of property in general, no comprehensive analysis of landed property has been 
attempted.  The paper presents such an analysis and shows how landed property differs 
from other types of property in a way which implies a special role for political and economic 
philosophy of property rights in land.roduct of interaction between human beings, political,

vagueness and approximation”, Proceedings of COSIT Workshop on Spatial 
Vagueness, Uncertainty and Granularity (2001). 
Abstract: We propose a view of vagueness as a semantic property of names and predicates. 
All entities are crisp, on this semantic view, but there are, for each vague name, multiple 
portions of reality that are equally good candidates for being its referent, and, for each 
vague predicate, multiple classes of objects that are equally good candidates for being its 
extension. We provide a new formulation of these ideas in terms of a theory of granular 
partitions. We show that this theory provides a general framework within which we can 
understand the relation between vague terms and concepts and the corresponding crisp 
portions of reality. We also sketch how it might be possible to formulate within this 
framework a theory of vagueness which dispenses with the notion of truth-value gaps and 
other artifacts of more familiar approaches. Central to our approach is the idea that 
judgments about reality involve in every case (1) a separation of reality into foreground and 
background of attention and (2) the feature of granularity. On this basis we attempt to show 
that even vague judgments made in naturally occurring contexts are not marked by truth-
value indeterminacy. We distinguish, in addition to crisp granular partitions, also vague 
partitions, and reference partitions, and we explain the role of the latter in the context of 
judgments that involve vagueness. We conclude by showing how reference partitions 
provide an effective means by which judging subjects are able to temper the vagueness of 
their judgments by means of approximations.

Abstract: Standard theories in mereotopology focus on relations of parthood and 
connection among spatial or spatio-temporal regions. Objects or processes which might be 
located in such regions are not normally directly treated in such theories. At best, they are 
simulated via appeal to distributions of attributes across the regions occupied or by functions 
from times to regions. The present paper offers a richer framework, in which it is possible 
to represent directly the relations between entities of various types at different levels, 
including both objects and the regions they occupy. What results is a layered 
mereotopology, a theory which can handle multiple layers (analogous to the layers of a 
lasagna) of spatially or spatiotemporally coincident but mereologically non-overlapping 
entities.

Abstract: In their paper “Sixteen Days” Barry Smith and Berit Brogaard try to answer the 
question: when does a human being begin to exist? In this paper we will address some 
methodological issues connected with this exercise in ontology. We shall begin by sketching 
the argument of “Sixteen Days”. We shall then attempt to characterize what is special about 
the ontological realism of “Sixteen Days” as contrasted to the linguistic constructivism which 
represents the more dominant current in contemporary analytic philosophy. This will allow 
us to infer guidelines for assessing the quality of ontological theories of various types. We 
shall argue that ontological parsimony, groundedness, faithfulness to ordinary language, 
consistency with science, coherence, and fruitfulness are at least part of the adequacy 
criteria for such theories. These criteria will then be applied to the theory presented in 
“Sixteen Days”, and they will lead us to some revisions of this theory as well as to some 
reflections on its ethical implications.

in the treatment of task-based clinical guidelines as a means for better understanding the

and between related guidelines. We used as our starting point a DAML+OIL-based ontology 
for the WHO guideline for hypertension management, comparing this with related guidelines 
and attempting to show that TGP provides a flexible and highly expressive basis for the 
manipulation of ontologies of a sort which might be useful in providing more adequate 
Computer Interpretable Guideline Models (CIGMs) in the future.

subsystems at a variety of levels. At the highest level are bodily systems proper, such as 
the endocrine system, which are central to our understanding of human anatomy, and play 
a key role in diagnosis and in dynamic modeling as well as in medical pedagogy and

computer visualization. But there is no explicit definition of what a bodily system is; such 
informality is acceptable in documentation created for human beings, but falls short of what 
is needed for computer representations. Our analysis is intended as a first step towards 
filling this gap.

Proceedings of the Conference: Towards an Electronic Patient Record (TEPR

(CD-ROM publication). 
Abstract: Ontology is currently perceived as the solution of first resort for all problems 
related to biomedical terminology, and the use of description logics is seen as a minimal 
requirement on adequate ontology-based systems. Contrary to common conceptions, 
however, description logics alone are not able to prevent incorrect representations; this is 
because they do not come with a theory indicating what is computed by using them, just as 
classical arithmetic does not tell us anything about the entities that are added or subtracted. 
In this paper we shall show that ontology is indeed an essential part of any solution to the 
problems of medical terminology – but only if it is understood in the right sort of way. 
Ontological engineering, we shall argue, should in every case go hand in hand with a sound 
ontological theory.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing wealth of genomic data has driven the development of 
tools to assist in the task of representing and processing information about genes, their 
products and their functions. One of the most important of these tools is the Gene Ontology 
(GO), which is being developed in tandem with work on a variety of bioinformatics 
databases. An examination of the structure of GO, however, reveals a number of problems, 
which we believe can be resolved by taking account of certain organizing principles drawn 
from philosophical ontology. We shall explore the results of applying such principles to GO 
with a view to improving GO’s consistency and coherence and thus its future applicability in 
the automated processing of biological data.

approach to the understanding of ontologies and of the relationships ontologies bear to 
instances in reality, we provide an application of this theory in relation to an example drawn 
from the context of the pathophysiology of hypertension. This exercise is designed to 
demonstrate how, by taking ontological principles into account we can create more realistic

Abstract: It is widely understood that protein functions can be exhaustively described in 
terms of no single parameter, whether this be amino acid sequence or the three-dimensional 
structure of the underlying protein molecule. This means that a number of different 
attributes must be used to create an ontology of protein functions. Certainly much of the 
required information is already stored in databases such as Swiss-Prot, Protein Data Bank, 
SCOP and MIPS. But the latter have been developed for different purposes and the separate 
data-structures which they employ are not conducive to the needed data integration. When 
we attempt to classify the entities in the domain of proteins, we find ourselves faced with a 
number of cross-cutting principles of classification. Our question here is: how can we bring 
together these separate taxonomies in order to describe protein functions? Our proposed 
answer is: via a careful top-level ontological analysis of the relevant principles of 
defeTclassification, combined with a new framework for the simultaneous manipulation of 
classifications constructed for different purposes.

follows we present the outlines of a framework for understanding the relations between 
organizations, guidelines, individual patients and patient-related functions. The derived 
framework provides a means to extract the knowledge contained in the guideline text at 
different granularities, in ways that can help us to assign tasks within the healthcare 
organization and to assess clinical performance in realizing the guideline. It does this in a 
way that preserves the flexibility of the organization in the adoption of the guidelines.

Abstract: We propose an ontological theory that is powerful enough to describe both 
complex spatio-temporal processes (occurrents) and the enduring entities (continuants) 
that participate therein. The theory is divided into two major categories of sub-theories: 
(sub-) theories of type SPAN and (sub-)theories of type SNAP. These theories represent two 
complementary perspectives on reality and result in distinct though compatible systems of 
categories. In SNAP we have enduring entities such as substances, qualities, roles, 
functions; in SPAN we have perduring entities such as processes and their parts and

aggregates. We argue that both kinds of ontological theory are required in order to give a 
non-reductionism account of complex domains of reality.

natural language, and information systems: Implications of cross-linguistic 
studies of geographic terms”, 6th Annual Conference of the Association of 
Geographic Information Laboratories for Europe (AGILE), 45-50. 
Abstract: Ontology has been proposed as a solution to the 'Tower of Babel' problem that 
threatens the semantic interoperability of information systems constructed independently 
for the same domain. In information systems research and applications, ontologies are often 
implemented by formalizing the meanings of words from natural languages. However, words 
in different natural languages sometimes subdivide the same domain of reality in terms of 
different conceptual categories. If the words and their associated concepts in two natural 
languages, or even in two terminological traditions within the same language, do not have 
common referents in the real world, an ontology based on word meanings will inherit the 
'Tower of Babel' problem from the languages involved, rather than solve it. In this paper we 
present evidence from a preliminary comparison of landscape terms in English with those 
in the Yindjibarndi language of northwestern Australia demonstrating that this problem is 
not just hypothetical. Some possible solutions are suggested.

Abstract: What follows is a contribution to the field of user modeling for adaptive teaching 
and learning programs especially in the medical field. The paper outlines existing 
approaches to the problem of extracting user information in a form that can be exploited by 
adaptive software. We focus initially on the so-called stereotyping method, which allocates 
users into classes adaptively, reflecting characteristics such as physical data, social 
background, and computer experience. The user classifications of the stereotyping method 
are however ad hoc and unprincipled, and they can be exploited by the adaptive system 
only after a large number of trials by various kinds of users. We argue that the remedy is 
to create a database of user ontologies from which readymade taxonomies can be derived 
in such a way as to enable associated software to support a variety of different types of 
users.

Abstract: Formal principles governing best practices in classification and definition have for 
too long been neglected in the construction of biomedical ontologies, in ways which have 
important negative consequences for data integration and ontology alignment. We argue 
that the use of such principles in ontology construction can serve as a valuable tool in error-
detection and also in supporting reliable manual curation. We argue also that such principles 
are a prerequisite for the successful application of advanced data integration techniques 
such as ontology-based multi-database querying, automated ontology alignment and 
ontology-based text-mining. These theses are illustrated by means of a case study of the 
Gene Ontology, a project of increasing importance within the field of biomedical data 
integration.

time reflect well-defined needs on the prat of our customers. We compare our strategy with

Abstract: We propose a modular formal ontology of the biomedical domain with two

biological processes, corresponding broadly to physiology. The result constitutes what might 
be described as a joint venture between two perspectives – of so-called three-
dimensionalism and four-dimensionalism – which are normally regarded as incompatible. 
We outline an approach which allows them to be combined together, and provide examples 
of its application in biomedicine.

Abstract: The human body is a system made of systems. The body is divided into bodily 
systems proper, such as the endocrine and circulatory systems, which are subdivided into 
many sub-systems at a variety of levels, whereby all systems and subsystems engage in 
massive causal interaction with each other and with their surrounding environments. Here 
we offer an explicit definition of bodily system and provide a framework for understanding 
their causal interactions. Medical sciences provide at best informal accounts of basic notions 
such as system, process, and function, and while such informality is acceptable in 
documentation created for human beings, it falls short of what is needed for computer 
representations. In our analysis we will accordingly provide the framework for a formal 
definition of bodily system and of associated notions.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine relies on the execution of clinical practice guidelines 
and protocols. A great deal of of effort has been invested in the development of various 
tools which automate the representation and execution of the recommendations contained 
within such guidelines and protocols by creating Computer Interpretable Guideline Models 
(CIGMs). Context-based task ontologies (CTOs), based on standard terminology systems 
like UMLS, form one of the core components of such a model. We have created DAML+OIL-
based CTOs for the tasks mentioned in the WHO guideline for hypertension management, 
drawing comparisons also with other related guidelines. The advantages of CTOs include: 
contextualization of ontologies, providing ontologies tailored to specific aspects of the 
phenomena of interest, dividing the complexity involved in creating ontologies into different 
levels, providing a methodology by means of which the task recommendations contained 
within guidelines can be integrated into the clinical practices of a health care set-up.

Abstract: The paper presents the outlines of an ontology of plans and guidelines, which is 
then used as the basis for a framework for implementing guideline-based systems for the 
management of workflow in health care organizations. The framework has a number of 
special features, above all in that it enables us to represent in formal terms assignments of 
work-items both to individuals and to teams and to tailor guideline to specific contexts of 
application in health care organizations. It is designed also to enable implementations to do 
justice to the fact that the processes carried out in health care organizations may deviate 
in different ways from the norms set forth in corresponding guideline definitions. This means 
that implementations built in conformity with the framework will be marked by a type of 
flexibility that might make them more likely to be accepted by healthcare professionals than 
are standard guideline-based management systems.

Abstract: The Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) symbolically represents the structural 
organization of the human body from the macromolecular to the macroscopic levels, with 
the goal of providing a robust and consistent scheme for classifying anatomical entities that 
is designed to serve as a reference ontology in biomedical informatics. Here we articulate 
the need for formally clarifying the is-a and part-of relations in the FMA and similar ontology 
and terminology systems. We diagnose certain characteristic errors in the treatment of 
these relations and show how these errors can be avoided through adoption of the formalism 
we describe. We then illustrate how a consistently applied formal treatment of taxonomy 
and partonomy can support the alignment of ontologies.

has been poorly appreciated in the informatics community, and it turns out that importing 
the benefits of philosophical insight and methodology into applications domains yields 
diverse improvements. L&C’s LinKBase® is one of the world’s largest medical domain 
ontologies. Its current primary use pertains to natural language processing applications, but

improving the interoperability of the ontologies it embeds.

Abstract: There is a recognized need for a meta-classification that can serve as a 
foundation for more refined ontologies in the field of proteomics. Standard data sources 
classify proteins in terms of just one or two specific aspects. Thus SCOP (Structural 
Classification of Proteins) is described as classifying proteins on the basis of structural 
features; SWISS-PROT annotates proteins on the basis of their structure and of parameters 
like post-translational modifications. Such data sources are connected to each other by 
pairwise term-to-term mappings. However, there are obstacles which stand in the way of 
combining them together to form a robust meta-classification of the needed sort. We discuss 
some formal ontological principles which should be taken into account within the existing 
datasources in order to make such a metaclassification possible, taking into account also 
the Gene Ontology (GO) and its application to the annotation of proteins.

Whistler, BC, 2-5 June 2004, 114–120. 
Abstract: Software application ontologies have the potential to become the keystone in 
state-of-the-art information management techniques. It is expected that these ontologies 
will support the sort of reasoning power required to navigate large and complex 
terminologies correctly and efficiently. Yet, there is one problem in particular that continues 
to stand in our way. As these terminological structures increase in size and complexity, and 
the drive to integrate them inevitably swells, it is clear that the level of consistency required 
for such navigation will become correspondingly difficult to maintain. While descriptive 
semantic representations are certainly a necessary component to any adequate ontology-
based system, so long as ontology engineers rely solely on semantic information, without a 
sound ontological theory informing their modeling decisions, this goal will surely remain out 
of reach. In this paper we describe how Language and Computing nv (L&C), along with The 
Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Sciences (IFOMIS), are working 
towards developing and implementing just such a theory, combining the open software 
architecture of L&C’s LinkSuiteTM with the philosophical rigor of Basic Formal Ontology. In 
this way we aim to move beyond the more or less simple controlled vocabularies that have 
dominated the industry to date.

paper is to study the degree to which one DL-based biomedical terminology (SNOMED CT) 
complies with such principles. We defined seven ontological principles (for example: each 
class must have at least one parent, each class must differ from its parent) and examined 
the properties of SNOMED CT classes with respect to these principles. Our major results 
are: 31% of the classes have a single child; 27% have multiple parents; 51% do not exhibit 
any differentiae between the description of the parent and that of the child. The applications 
of this study to quality assurance for ontologies are discussed and suggestions are made for 
dealing with multiple inheritance.

Abstract: The Gene Ontology is an important tool for the representation and processing of 
information about gene products and functions. It provides controlled vocabularies for the 
designations of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes used in 
the annotation of genes and gene products. These constitute three separate ontologies, of 
cellular components), molecular functions and biological processes, respectively. The 
question we address here is: how are the terms in these three separate ontologies related 
to each other? We use statistical methods and formal ontological principles as a first step 
towards finding answers to this question.

Abstract: A consumer health information system must be able to comprehend both expert 
and non-expert medical vocabulary and to map between the two. We describe an on-going 
project to create a new lexical database called Medical WordNet (MWN), consisting of 
medically relevant terms used by and intelligible to non-expert subjects and supplemented 
by a corpus of natural-language sentences that is designed to provide medically validated 
contexts for MWN terms. The corpus derives primarily from online health information 
sources targeted to consumers, and involves two sub-corpora, called Medical FactNet (MFN) 
and Medical BeliefNet (MBN), respectively. The former consists of statements accredited as 
true on the basis of a rigorous process of validation, the latter of statements which non-
experts believe to be true. We summarize the MWN / MFN / MBN project, and describe some 
of its applications.

Abstract: Medical terminology collects and organizes the many different kinds of terms 
employed in the biomedical domain both by practitioners and also in the course of 
biomedical research. In addition to serving as labels for biomedical classes, these names 
reflect the organizational principles of biomedical vocabularies and ontologies. Some names 

BARRY SMITH  
 
 
184 
 
 
represent invariant features (classes, universals) of biomedical reality (i.e., they are a 
matter for ontology). Other names, however, convey also how this reality is perceived, 
measured, and understood by health professionals (i.e., they belong to the domain of 
epistemology). We analyze terms from several biomedical vocabularies in order to throw 
light on the interactions between ontological and epistemological components of these 
terminologies. We identify four cases: 1) terms containing classification criteria, 2) terms 
reflecting detectability, modality, uncertainty, and vagueness, 3) terms created in order to 
obtain a complete partition of a given domain, and 4) terms reflecting mere fiat boundaries. 
We show that epistemology-loaded terms are pervasive in biomedical vocabularies, that the 
“classes” they name often do not comply with sound classification principles, and that they 
are therefore likely to cause problems in the evolution and alignment of terminologies and 
associated ontologies. This paper introduces the idea of epistemological intrusion into the 
study of medical ontologies.

Proceedings of the Third International Conference (FOIS 2004), Amsterdam:

Abstract: There is an assumption commonly embraced by ontological engineers, an 
assumption which has its roots in the discipline of knowledge representation, to the effect 
that it is concepts which form the subject-matter of ontology. The term ‘concept’ is hereby 
rarely precisely defined, and the intended role of concepts within ontology is itself subject 
to a variety of conflicting (and sometimes intrinsically incoherent) interpretations. It seems, 
however, to be widely accepted that concepts are in some sense the products of human 
cognition. The present essay is devoted to the application of ontology in support of research 
in the natural sciences. It defends the thesis that ontologies developed for such purposes 
should be understood as having as their subject matter, not concepts, but rather the 
universals and particulars which exist in reality and are captured in scientific laws. We 
outline the benefits of a view along these lines by showing how it yields rigorous formal 
definitions of the foundational relations used in many influential ontologies, illustrating our 
results by reference to examples drawn from the domain of the life sciences.

Abstract: One of the tasks of ontology in information science is to support the classification 
of entities according to their kinds and qualities. We hold that to realize this task as far as 
entities such as material objects are concerned we need to distinguish four kinds of entities: 
substance particulars, quality particulars, substance universals, and quality universals. 
These form, so to speak, an ontological square. We present a formal theory of classification 
based on this idea, including both a semantics for the theory and a provably sound 
axiomatization.

Abstract: This paper provides an axiomatic formalization of a theory of foundational 
relations between three categories of entities: individuals, universals, and collections. We 
deal with a variety of relations between entities in these categories, including the is-a 
relation among universals and the part-of relation among individuals as well as cross-
category relations such as instance-of, member-of, and partition-of. We show that an 
adequate understanding of the formal properties of such relations – in particular their 
behavior with respect to time – is critical for formal ontology. We provide examples to 
support this thesis from the domain of biomedicine.

Abstract: Description Logics are nowadays widely accepted as formalisms which provide 
reasoning facilities which allow us to discover inconsistencies in ontologies in an automatic 
fashion. Where ontologies are developed in modular fashion, they allow changes in one 
module to propogated through the system of ontologies automatically in a way which helps 
to maintain consistency and stability. For this feature to be utilized effectively, however, 
requires that domain ontologies be represented in a normalized form.

healthcare organizations. This in turn requires that the management of information and 
knowledge within healthcare organizations be combined with models of resources and 
processes of patient care that are based on a general ontology of social interaction.

Abstract: Biomedical research is increasingly a matter of the navigation through large 
computerized information resources deriving from functional genomics or from the 
biochemistry of disease pathways. To make such navigation possible, controlled 
vocabularies are needed in terms of which data from different sources can be unified. One 
of the most influential developments in this regard is the so-called Gene Ontology, which 
consists of controlled vocabularies of terms used by biologists to describe cellular 
constituents, biological processes and molecular functions, organized into hierarchies via 
the relation of class subsumption. Here we seek to provide a rigorous account of the logic 
of classification that underlies GO and similar biomedical ontologies. Drawing on Aristotle, 
we develop a system of axioms and definitions for the treatment of biological classes and 
instances.

Bioinformatics”, Proceedings of Bio-Ontologies Workshop, Intelligent

Abstract: Recent work on the quality assurance of the Gene Ontology (GO, Gene Ontology 
Consortium 2004) from the perspective of both linguistic and ontological organization has 
made it clear that GO lacks the kind of formalism needed to support logic-based reasoning. 
At the same time it is no less clear that GO has proven itself to be an excellent terminological 
resource that can serve to combine together a variety of biomedical database and 
information systems. Given the strengths of GO, it is worth investigating whether, by 
overcoming some of its weaknesses from the point of view of formalontological principles, 
we might not be able to enhance a version of GO which can come even closer to serving the 
needs of the various communities of biomedical researchers and practitioners. It is accepted 
that clinical and bioinformatics need to find common ground if the results of data-intensive 
biomedical research are to be harvested to the full. It is also widely accepted that no single 
method will be sufficient to create the needed common framework. We believe that the 
principles-based approach to life-science data integration and knowledge representation 
must be one of the methods applied. Indeed in dealing with the ontological representation 
of carcinomas, and specifically of colon carcinomas, we have established that, had GO (and 
related biomedical ontologies) followed some of the basic formal-ontological principles we 
have identified (Smith et al. 2004, Ceusters et al. 2004), then the effort required to navigate 
successfully between clinical and bioinformatics systems would have been reduced. We point 
here to the sources of ontologicallyrelated errors in GO, and also provide arguments as to 
why and how such errors need to be resolved.

transformation_of characteristic of pathologies.

Reicher (eds.), Experience and Analysis, Vienna: HPT&ÖBV, 2005, 153–170. 
Abstract: The analytical philosophy of the last one hundred years has been heavily 
influenced by a doctrine to the effect that one can arrive at a correct ontology by paying 
attention to certain superficial (syntactic) features of first-order predicate logic as conceived 
by Frege and Russell. More specifically, it is a doctrine to the effect that the key to the 
ontological structure of reality is captured syntactically in the ‘Fa’ (or, in more sophisticated 
versions, in the ‘Rab’) of first-order logic, where ‘F’ stands for what is general in reality and 
‘a’ for what is individual. Hence “f(a)ntology”. Because predicate logic has exactly two 
syntactically different kinds of referring expressions –  ‘F’, ‘G’, ‘R’, etc., and ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, etc. 
– so reality must consist of exactly two correspondingly different kinds of entity: the general 
(properties, concepts) and the particular (things, objects), the relation between these two 
kinds of entity being revealed in the predicate-argument structure of atomic formulas in 
first-order logic.

Abstract: The National Cancer Institute’s Thesaurus (NCIT) has been created with the goal 
of providing a controlled vocabulary which can be used by specialists in the various sub-
domains of oncology. It is intended to be used for purposes of annotation in ways designed 
to ensure the integration of data and information deriving from these various sub-domains, 
and thus to support more powerful cross-domain inferences. In order to evaluate its 
suitability for this purpose, we examined the NCIT’s treatment of the kinds of entities which 
are fundamental to an ontology of colon carcinoma. We here describe the problems we 
uncovered concerning classification, synonymy, relations and definitions, and we draw 
conclusions for the work needed to establish the NCIT as a reference ontology for the cancer 
domain in the future.

Abstract: The last two decades have seen considerable efforts directed towards making 
Electronic Health Records interoperable through improvements in medical ontologies, 
terminologies and coding systems. Unfortunately, these efforts have been hampered by a 
number of influential ideas inherited from the work of Eugen Wüster, the father of 
terminology standardization and the founder of ISO TC 37. We here survey Wüster’s ideas 
– which see terminology work as being focused on the classification of concepts in people’s 
minds – and we argue that they serve still as the basis for a series of influential confusions. 
We argue further that an ontology based unambiguously, not on concepts, but on the 
classification of entities in reality can, by removing these confusions, make a vital 
contribution to ensuring the interoperability of coding systems and healthcare records in the 
future.

Health Records”, Medical Informatics Europe (MIE 2005), Geneva, Studies in 
Health Technology and Informatics 116 (2005), 71–76. 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are organized around two kinds of statements: 
those reporting observations made, and those reporting acts performed. In neither case 
does the record involve any direct reference to what such statements are actually about. 
They record not: what is happening on the side of the patient, but rather: what is said about 
what is happening. While the need for a unique patient identifier is generally recognized, 
we argue that we should now move to an EHR regime in which all clinically salient particulars 
– from the concrete disorder on the side of the patient and the body parts in which it occurs 
to the concrete treatments given – should be uniquely identified. This will allow us to achieve 
interoperability among different systems of records at the level where it really matters: in 
regard to what is happening in the real world. It will also allow us to keep track of particular 
disorders and of the effects of particular treatments in a precise and unambiguous way. We 
discuss the ontological and epistemological aspects of our claim and describe a scenario for 
implementation within EHR systems.

Abstract: There are a number of existing classifications and staging schemes for 
carcinomas, one of the most frequently used being the TNM classification. Such 
classifications represent classes of entities which exist at various anatomical levels of 
granularity. We argue that in order to apply such representations to the Electronic Health 
Records one needs sound ontologies which take into consideration the diversity of the 
domains which are involved in clinical bioinformatics. Here we outline a formal theory for 
addressing these issues in a way that the ontologies can be used to support inferences 
relating to entities which exist at different anatomical levels of granularity. Our case study 
is the colon carcinoma, one of the most common carcinomas prevalent within the European 
population.

Abstract: SNODENT is a dental diagnostic vocabulary incompletely integrated in SNOMED-
CT. Nevertheless, SNODENT could become the de facto standard for dental diagnostic 
coding. SNODENT’s manageable size, the fact that it is administratively self-contained, and 
relates to a well-understood domain provides valuable opportunities to formulate and test, 
in controlled experiments, a series of hypothesis concerning diagnostic systems. Of 
particular interest are questions related to establishing appropriate quality assurance 
methods for its optimal level of detail in content, its ontological structure, its construction 
and maintenance. This paper builds on previous software-based methodologies designed to 
assess the quality of SNOMED-CT.

Abstract: The Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) is a map of the human body. Like 
maps of other sorts – including the map-like representations we find in familiar anatomical 
atlases – it is a representation of a certain portion of spatial reality as it exists at a certain 
(idealized) instant of time. But unlike other maps, the FMA comes in the form of a 
sophisticated ontology of its object-domain, comprising some 1.5 million statements of 
anatomical relations among some 70,000 anatomical kinds. It is further distinguished from 
other maps in that it represents not some specific portion of spatial reality (say: Leeds in 
1996), but rather the generalized or idealized spatial reality associated with a generalized 
or idealized human being at some generalized or idealized instant of time. It will be our 
concern in what follows to outline the approach to ontology that is represented by the FMA 
and to argue that it can serve as the basis for a new type of anatomical information science. 
We also draw some implications for our understanding of spatial reasoning and spatial 
ontologies in general.

Abstract: The pivotal role of the relation part-of in the description of living organisms is 
widely acknowledged. Organisms are open systems, which means that in contradistinction 
to mechanical artifacts they are characterized by a continuous flow and exchange of matter. 
A closer analysis of the spatial relations in biological organisms reveals that the decision as 
to whether a given particular is part-of a second particular or whether it is only contained-
in the second particular is often controversial. We here propose a rule-based approach which 
allows us to decide on the basis of well-defined criteria which of the two relations holds 
between two anatomical objects, given that one spatially includes the other. We discuss the 
advantages and limitations of this approach, using concrete examples from human anatomy.

Abstract: Biomedical terminologies are focused on what is general, Electronic Health

one to the other is unproblematic. We argue that this is not so, and that, if the EHR of the 
future is to fulfill its promise, then the foundations of both EHR architectures and biomedical 
terminologies need to be reconceived. We accordingly describe a new framework for the 
treatment of both generals and particulars in biomedical information systems that is 
designed: 1) to provide new opportunities for the sharing and management of data within 
and between healthcare institutions, 2) to facilitate interoperabilityforms among different 
terminology and record systems, and thereby 3) to allow new kinds of reasoning with 
biomedical data.

Abstract: The integration of biomedical terminologies is indispensable to the process of 
information integration. When terminologies are linked merely through the alignment of 
their leaf terms, however, differences in context and ontological structure are ignored. 
Making use of the SNAP and SPAN ontologies, we show how three reference domain 
ontologies can be integrated at a higher level, through what we shall call the OBR framework 
(for: Ontology of Biomedical Reality). OBR is designed to facilitate inference across the 
boundaries of domain ontologies in anatomy, physiology and pathology.

far identifiers that uniquely identify the particular disorders patients have, the symptoms 
they experienced, the actual treatments that have been applied, and so forth. Referent 
tracking has been introduced as a paradigm to make this also a standard procedure. In this 
talk, we discuss how natural language understanding can contribute to this.

Abstract: The paradigm of referent tracking is based on a realist presupposition which 
rejects so-called negative entities (congenital absent nipple, and the like) as spurious. How, 
then, can a referent tracking-based Electronic Health Record deal with what are standardly 
called ‘negative findings’? To answer this question we carried out an analysis of some 748 
sentences drawn from patient charts and containing some form of negation. Our analysis 
shows that to deal with these sentences we need to introduce a new ontological relationship 
between a particular and a universal, which holds when no instance of the universal has a 
specific qualified ontological relation with the particular. This relation is found to be able to 
accommodate nearly all occurrences of negative findings in the examined sample, in ways 
which involve no reference to negative entities.

Abstract: Ontology is a burgeoning field, involving researchers from the computer science, 
philosophy, data and software engineering, logic, linguistics, and terminology domains. 
Many ontology-related terms with precise meanings in one of these domains have different 
meanings in others. Our purpose here is to initiate a path towards disambiguation of such 
terms. We draw primarily on the literature of biomedical informatics, not least because the 
problems caused by unclear or ambiguous use of terms have been there most thoroughly 
addressed. We advance a proposal resting on a distinction of three levels too often run 
together in biomedical ontology research: 1. the level of reality; 2. the level of cognitive 
representations of this reality; 3. the level of textual and graphical artifacts. We propose a 
reference terminology for ontology research and development that is designed to serve as 
common hub into which the several competing disciplinary terminologies can be mapped. 
We then justify our terminological choices through a critical treatment of the ‘concept 
orientation’ in biomedical terminology research.

Abstract: ‘Eruv’ is a Hebrew word meaning literally ‘mixture’ or ‘mingling’. An eruv is an 
urban region demarcated within a larger urban region by means of a boundary made up of 
telephone wires or similar markers. Through the creation of the eruv, the smaller region is 
turned symbolically (halachically = according to Jewish law) into a private domain. So long 
as they remain within the boundaries of the eruv, Orthodox Jews may engage in activities 
that would otherwise be prohibited on the Sabbath, such as pushing prams or wheelchairs, 
or carrying walking sticks. There are eruvim in many towns and university campuses 
throughout the world. There are five eruvim in Chicago, five in Brooklyn, twenty three in 
Queens and Long Island, and at least three in Manhattan. The US Supreme Court is (like 
most other major US Federal Government buildings) located within the eruv of Washington 
DC. In many cases, not all of those living within or near the area of an actual or proposed 
eruv will themselves be Orthodox Jews, and this has sometimes led to protests against eruv 
creation. It is such protests which triggered the writing of this essay.

Abstract: Referent tracking (RT) is a new paradigm, based on unique identification, for 
representing and keeping track of particulars. It was first introduced to support the entry 
and retrieval of data in electronic health records (EHRs). Its purpose is to avoid the 
ambiguity that arises when statements in an EHR refer to disorders or other entities on the 
side of the patient exclusively by means of compound descriptions utilizing general terms 
such as ‘pimple on nose’ or ‘small left breast tumor’. In this paper, we describe the 
theoretical foundations of this paradigm and show how it is being applied to the solution of 
analogous problems of ambiguous identification in the fields of digital rights management, 
corporate memories and decision algorithms.

Abstract: For most people, the term ‘standard’ generates an immediate impulse to run in 
the opposite direction. We all know that this means someone is bent upon the ‘one, true 
capitalization style’, thereby fomenting an instantaneous rebellion. While it is somewhat 
audacious to propose standards, the adoption of a few shared simple conventions is an 
important strategy to improve quality in controlled vocabularies and ontologies we build. 
Ontologies should not only satisfy computational requirements, but also meet the needs of 
human readers who are trying to understand them. When confronted by the full complexity 
of an ontology, logical coherence and predictable naming is important, then our guesses 
about where something may be found, or what it is called, are right more often than wrong. 
Conforming to naming conventions in ontology construction will help consumers more

are only partially distinguished and that a more detailed study is required to propose clear 
recommendations for enhancement along at least the following lines: (1) explicit 
representation of the provenance of a class; (2) separation of the time-period during which 
a component is stated valid in SNOMED-CT from the period it is (or has been) valid in reality, 
and (3) redesign of the historical relationships table to give users better assistance for 
recovery in case of introduced mistakes.

promises many benefits to those who use health record data to improve patient care. To 
further the adoption of the paradigm we provide an illustration of how data from an EHR 
application needs to be decomposed to make it accord with the tenets of Referent Tracking. 
We describe the ontological principles on which such decomposition needs to be based in 
order to allow integration efforts to be applied to other EHR applications by interested 
parties. We find that an ordinary statement from an EHR reveals a surprising amount of 
‘hidden’ data that is revealed by its decomposition according to these principles.

Abstract: We present some ideas on logical process descriptions, using relations from the

naturally decomposed in terms of more basic structured logical process descriptions using 
terms from linear logic. In our view, the process descriptions are able to clarify the usual 
relational descriptions of DIO. In particular, we discuss the use of logical process 
descriptions in proving linear logical theorems. Among the types of reasoning supported by 
DIO one can distinguish both (1) basic reasoning about general structures in reality and (2) 
the domain-specific reasoning of experts. We here propose a clarification of this important 
distinction between (realist) reasoning on the basis of an ontology and rule-based inferences 
on the basis of an expert’s view.

Abstract: Increasingly, the high throughput technologies used by biomedical researchers 
are bringing about a situation in which large bodies of data are being described using 
controlled structured vocabularies—also known as ontologies—in order to support the 
integration and analysis of this data. Annotation of data by means of ontologies is already 
contributing in significant ways to the cumulation of scientific knowledge and, prospectively, 
to the applicability of cross-domain algorithmic reasoning in support of scientific advance. 
This very success, however, has led to a proliferation of ontologies of varying scope and 
quality. We define one strategy for achieving quality assurance of ontologies—a plan of 
action already adopted by a large community of collaborating ontologists—which consists in 
subjecting ontologies to a process of peer review analogous to that which is applied to 
scientific journal articles.

Abstract: The Protein Ontology (PRO) addresses the need for a formal description of

basis of content derived automatically from various data sources. Curation is needed to 
ensure correct representations of relationships both internally (between PRO nodes) and 
externally (to other ontologies). Focusing specifically on the TGF-beta signaling proteins, we 
describe how this ontology can be used for multiple purposes, including annotation, 
representation of objects in pathways, data integration, and the representation of biological 
system dynamics and of disease etiology.

category of tendency, and considers the merits of recognizing two sub-categories of function 
for domain ontologies, namely, artifactual and biological function. The motivation is to help 
advance the coherent ontological treatment of functions, roles, and dispositions, to help 
provide the potential for more detailed classification, and to shed light on BFO’s general

Abstract: Increasingly, in data-intensive areas of the life sciences, experimental results are 
being described in algorithmically useful ways with the help of ontologies. Such ontologies 
are authored and maintained by scientists to support the retrieval, integration and analysis 
of their data. The proposition to be defended here is that ontologies of this type – the Gene 
Ontology (GO) being the most conspicuous example – are a part of science. Initial evidence 
for the truth of this proposition (which some will find self-evident) is the increasing 
recognition of the importance of empirically-based methods of evaluation to the ontology 
development work being undertaken in support of scientific research. The ontologies created 
by scientists must, of course, be associated with implementations satisfying the 
requirements of software engineering. But these ontologies are not themselves engineering 
artifacts, and to conceive them as such brings grievous consequences. Rather, we shall 
argue, ontologies such as the GO are comparable to scientific theories, to scientific 
databases, or to scientific journal publications. Such a view implies a radically new 
conception of what is involved in the authoring, maintenance and application of ontologies 
in scientific contexts, and therewith also a radically new approach to the evaluation of 
ontologies and to the training of ontologists.

Abstract: Many existing biomedical vocabulary standards rest on incomplete, inconsistent 
or confused accounts of basic terms pertaining to diseases, diagnoses, and clinical 
phenotypes. Here we outline what we believe to be a logically and biologically coherent 
framework for the representation of such entities and of the relations between them. We 
defend a view of disease as involving in every case some physical basis within the organism 
that bears a disposition toward the execution of pathological processes. We present our 
view in the form of a list of terms and definitions designed to provide a consistent starting

future.

An Essay in the Ontology of Identity”, Proceedings of InterOntology 2009 
(Tokyo, Japan, February 27-March 1, 2009), 77-86. 
Abstract: Health Level 7 (HL7) is an organization seeking to provide universal standards 
for the exchange of healthcare information. In a document entitled ‘HL7 Version 3 Standard: 
Data Types’, the HL7 organization advances descriptions of data types recommended for 
use as identifiers. We will argue that the descriptions supplied provide insufficient guidance 
as to what exactly the entities are which these data types uniquely identify. Are they real 
things, such as persons or pieces of equipment? Or are they representations of such real 
things in information artifacts? We here outline the problems faced by HL7 in providing 
answers to such questions, problems which arise because of the lack of anything like a 
coherent ontology in the HL7 standard, and we make some recommendations for future 
improvements.

Abstract: One way to detect, monitor and prevent adverse events with the help of

what is the case, what is believed about reality, and what is represented. We report on how 
Basic Formal Ontology and Referent Tracking exhibit this capability and how they are used 
to develop an adverse event ontology and related data annotation scheme for the European

Abstract: As health systems around the world turn towards highly distributed, specialized 
and cooperative structures to increase quality and safety of care as well as efficiency and 
efficacy of delivery processes, there is a growing need for supporting communication and 
collaboration of all parties involved with advanced ICT solutions. The Electronic Health

application. To meet the requirements for sustainable, semantically interoperable, and 
trustworthy EHR solutions, different standards and different national strategies have been 
established. The workshop summarizes the requirements for such advanced EHR systems 
and their underlying architecture, presents different strategies and solutions advocated by 
corresponding protagonists, discusses pros and cons as well as harmonization and migration

Command and Control, Proceedings of the 14th International Command and 
Control Research and Technology Symposium (ICCRTS), Washington DC, 
Jun 15-17, Arlington, VA: The Command and Control Research Program, 
2009. 
Abstract: The goal of the Department of Defense Net-Centric Data Strategy is to improve 
data sharing throughout the DoD. Data sharing is a critical element of interoperability in the 
emerging system-of-systems. Achieving interoperability requires the elimination of two 
types of data heterogeneity: differences of syntax and differences of semantics. This paper 
builds a path toward semantic uniformity through application of a disciplined approach to 
ontology. An ontology is a consensus framework representing the types of entities within a 
given domain and the relations between them. The construction of an ontology begins when 
a Community of Interest (COI) identifies its authoritative data sources (ADS), which are 
usually manifest in relevant doctrinal publications, glossaries, data dictionaries, and logical 
data models. The identified terms are then defined in relation to a common logical 
framework that has been designed to ensure interoperability with other ontologies created 
on the basis of the same strategy. As will be described, the Command and Control (C2) 
Ontology will include representations of a substantial number of entities within the 
Command 
and 
Control 
(C2) 
domain. 
If 
domain 
ontologies 
(e.g. 
Strike 
and 
Counterinsurgency) semantically align with the C2 Ontology, then a substantial barrier to 
systems interoperability is thereby crossed.

Abstract: This paper addresses a family of issues surrounding the biological phenomenon 
of resistance and its representation in realist ontologies. Resistance terms from various 
existing ontologies are examined and found to be either overly narrow, inconsistent, or 
otherwise problematic. We propose a more coherent ontological representation using the 
antibiotic resistance in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a case study.

The goal of the UCore initiative is to foster information sharing by means of an XML schema 
providing consensus representations for four groups of universally understood terms under 
the headings who, what, when, and where. We here describe a project to create an 
ontology-based supporting layer for UCore, entitled ‘Universal Core Semantic Layer’ (UCore 
SL), and describe how UCore SL can be applied to further UCore’s information sharing goals.

for Command and Control Messaging Systems”, Proceedings of Ontology for

Abstract: The Joint Battle Management Language (JBML) is an XML-based language 
designed to allow Command and Control (C2) systems to interface easily with Modeling and 
Simulation (M&S) systems. While some of the XML-tags defined in this language correspond 
to types of entities that exist in reality, others are mere syntactic artifacts used to structure 
the messages themselves. Because these two kinds of tags are not formally distinguishable, 
JBML messages in effect confuse data with what the data represent. In this paper we show 
how a realism-based ontology combined with a rule language can be used to make these 
distinctions explicit. The approach allows storage of the contents of JBML messages in a 
Referent Tracking System in a format that mimics the structure of reality thereby providing 
an aid to message validation.

Proceedings of the Third Interdisciplinary Ontology Meeting (Tokyo, Japan, 
February 27-28, 2010), Tokyo: Keio University Press, 2010, 25-34. 
Abstract: Definitive diagnosis of malaria requires the demonstration through laboratory 
tests of the presence within the patient of malaria parasites or their components. Since 
malaria parasites can be present even in the absence of malaria manifestations, and since 
symptoms of malaria can be manifested even in the absence of malaria parasites, malaria 
diagnosis raises important issues for the adequate understanding of disease, etiology and 
diagnosis. One approach to the resolution of these issues adopts a realist view, according 
to which the needed clarifications will be derived from a careful representation of the entities 
on the side of the patient which form the ultimate truthmakers for clinical statements. We 
here address a challenge to this realist approach relating to the diagnosis of malaria, and 
show how this challenge can be resolved by appeal to Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and to 
the Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) constructed in its terms.

Abstract: The goal of the OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry initiative is to create 
and maintain an evolving collection of non-overlapping interoperable ontologies that will 
offer unambiguous representations of the types of entities in biological and biomedical 
reality. These ontologies are designed to serve non-redundant annotation of data and 
scientific text. To achieve these ends, the Foundry imposes strict requirements upon the 
ontologies eligible for inclusion. While these requirements are not met by most existing 
biomedical terminologies, the latter may nonetheless support the Foundry’s goal of 
consistent and non-redundant annotation if appropriate mappings of data annotated with 
their aid can be achieved. To construct such mappings in reliable fashion, however, it is 
necessary to analyze terminological resources from an ontologically realistic perspective in 
such a way as to identify the exact import of the ‘concepts’ and associated terms which they 
contain. We propose a framework for such analysis – based on the analysis of configurations 
and groups of entities in reality – that is designed to maximize the degree to which legacy

terminologies and the data coded with their aid can be successfully used for information-
driven clinical and translational research.

Abstract: This paper addresses the use of dispositions in the Infectious Disease Ontology 
(IDO). IDO is an ontology constructed according to the principles of the Open Biomedical 
Ontology (OBO) Foundry and uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper ontology. 
After providing a brief introduction to disposition types in BFO and IDO, we discuss three 
general techniques for representing combinations of dispositions under the headings 
blocking dispositions, complementary dispositions, and collective dispositions. Motivating 
examples for each combination of dispositions is given along with a specific use case in IDO. 
Description logic restrictions are used to formalize statements relating to these 
combinations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reformulation of the treatment of boundaries, at parts and 
aggregates of entities in Basic Formal Ontology. These are currently treated as mutually 
exclusive, which is inadequate for biological representation since some entities may 
simultaneously be at parts, boundaries and/or aggregates. We introduce functions which 
map entities to their boundaries, at parts or aggregations. We make use of time, space and 
spacetime projection functions which, along the way, allow us to develop a simple temporal 
theory.

Conference on Ontology and Analytical Metaphysics, February 24-25, 2011, 
Tokyo: Keio University Press, 2011, 23-36. 
Abstract: We present an ontology of pain and of other pain-related phenomena, building 
on the definition of pain provided by the International Association for the Study of Pain 
(IASP). Our strategy is to identify an evolutionarily basic canonical pain phenomenon, 
involving unpleasant sensory and emotional experience based causally in localized tissue 
damage that is concordant with that experience. We then show how different variant cases 
of this canonical pain phenomenon can be distinguished, including pain that is elevated 
relative to peripheral trauma, pain that is caused neuropathically (thus with no necessary 
peripheral stimulus), and pain reports arising through deception either of self or of others. 
We describe how our approach can answer some of the objections raised against the IASP 
definition, and sketch how it can be used to support more sophisticated discrimination of 
different types of pain resulting in improved data analysis that can help in advancing pain 
research.

Abstract: As is well known, speech acts such as acts of promising can have ontological 
consequences. For example an act of promising can give rise to a mutually correlated claim 
and obligation. Increasingly, speech acts in the narrow sense are being augmented by the 
use of documents of multiple different sorts. In this paper we analyze the results of this 
augmentation from the ontological point of view, considering especially the domains of law 
and commerce. We show how document acts are not isolated phenomena, but rather form 
large and complex systems with other entities, including occurrent entities such as acts of 
signing and inspecting, as well as speech acts for example of instructing people to sign or 
complete a document. The paper concludes with a consideration of some of the special 
problems associated with the use of digital documents, for example as concerns issues of 
security and provenance.

Abstract: Affective science conducts interdisciplinary research into the emotions and other 
affective phenomena. Currently, such research is hampered by the lack of common 
definitions of te rms used to describe, categorise and report both individual emotional 
experiences and the results of scientific investigations of such experiences. High quality 
ontologies provide formal definitions for types of entities in reality and for the relationships 
between such entities, definitions which can be used to disambiguate and unify data across 
different disciplines. Heretofore, there has been little effort directed towards such formal 
representation for affective phenomena, in part because of widespread debates within the 
affective science community on matters of definition and categorization. We describe our 
efforts towards developing an Emotion Ontology (EMO) to serve the affective science 
community. We here focus on conformity to the BFO upper ontology and disambiguation of 
polysemous terminology.

Abstract: Health Level 7 (HL7) is an international standards development organisation in 
the domain of healthcare information technology. Initially the mission of HL7 was to enable 
data exchange via the creation of syntactic standards which supported point-to-point 
messaging. Currently HL7 sees its mission as one of creating standards for semantic 
interoperability in healthcare IT on the basis of its flagship “version 3” (v3). Unfortunately, 
v3 has been plagued by quality and consistency issues, and it has not been able to keep

pace with recent developments either in semantics and ontology or in computer science and 
engineering. HL7’s response has been to develop its “Services-Aware Interoperability 
Framework” (SAIF), which is intended to provide a foundation for work on all aspects of 
standardization in HL7 henceforth. We here summarise the major design principles that 
must be satisfied by a semantic interoperability framework – principles relating both to 
static semantics and to computational behaviour. We then assess the SAIF in light of these 
principles. We conclude that the SAIF is not in a position to support the needed reform of 
the HL7 v3 family of standards.

measuring vital signs, and the anatomical entities participating in such measurements. VSO 
is implemented in OWL-DL and follows OBO Foundry guidelines and best practices. If 
properly developed and extended, we believe the VSO will find applications for the EMR, 
clinical informatics, and medical device communities.

November 16-17, 2011, CEUR, Vol. 808, 6-13.  
Abstract: We describe a strategy for integration of data that is based on the idea of 
semantic enhancement. The strategy promises a number of benefits: it can be applied 
incrementally; it creates minimal barriers to the incorporation of new data into the 
semantically enhanced system; it preserves the existing data (including any existing data-
semantics) in their original form (thus all provenance information is retained, and no heavy 
preprocessing is required); and it embraces the full spectrum of data sources, types, 
models, and modalities (including text, images, audio, and signals). The result of applying 
this strategy to a given body of data is an evolving Dataspace that allows the application of 
a variety of integration and analytic processes to diverse data contents. We conceive 
semantic enhancement (SE) as a lightweight and flexible process that leverages the richness 

BARRY SMITH  
 
 
202 
 
 
of the structured contents of the Dataspace without adding storage and processing burdens 
to what, in the intelligence domain, will be an already storage- and processing-heavy 
starting point. SE works not by changing the data to which it is applied, but rather by adding 
an extra semantic layer to this data. We sketch how the semantic enhancement approach 
can be applied consistently and in cumulative fashion to new data and data-models that 
enter the Dataspace.

International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (CEUR 897), Graz, July 23-
25, 2012, 56-60. 
Abstract: Ontologies are being developed throughout the biomedical sciences to address 
standardization, integration, classiﬁcation and reasoning needs against the background of 
an increasingly data-driven research paradigm. In particular, ontologies facilitate the 
translation of basic research into beneﬁts for the patient by making research results more 
discoverable and by facilitating knowledge transfer across disciplinary boundaries. 
Addressing and adequately treating mental illness is one of our most pressing public health 
challenges. Primary research across multiple disciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, 
biology, neuroscience and pharmacology needs to be integrated in order to promote a more 
comprehensive understanding of underlying processes and mechanisms, and this need for 
integration only becomes more pressing with our increase in understanding of differences 
among individuals and populations at the molecular level concerning susceptibility to speciﬁc 
illnesses. Substance addiction is a particularly relevant public health challenge in the 
developed world, affecting a substantial percentage of the population, often co-morbid with 
other illnesses such as mood disorders. Currently, however, there is no straightforward 
automated method to combine data of relevance to the study of substance addiction across 
multiple disciplines and populations. 
In this contribution, we describe a framework of interlinked, interoperable bio-ontologies for 
the annotation of primary research data relating to substance addiction, and discuss how 
this framework enables easy integration of results across disciplinary boundaries. We 
describe entities and relationships relevant for the description of addiction within the Mental 
Functioning Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest Ontology, Protein Ontology, 
Gene Ontology and the Neuroscience Information Framework ontologies.

Abstract: Plants from a handful of species provide the primary source of food for all people, 
yet this source is vulnerable to multiple stressors, such as disease, drought, and nutrient 
deficiency. With rapid population growth and climate uncertainty, the need to produce crops 
that can tolerate or resist plant stressors is more crucial than ever. Traditional plant 
breeding methods may not be sufficient to overcome this challenge, and methods such as 
highOthroughput sequencing and automated scoring of phenotypes can provide significant 
new insights. Ontologies are essential tools for accessing and analysing the large quantities

of data that come with these newer methods. As part of a larger project to develop 
ontologies that describe plant phenotypes and stresses, we are developing a plant disease 
extension of the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDOPlant). The IDOPlant is envisioned as a 
reference ontology designed to cover any plant infectious disease. In addition to novel terms 
for infectious diseases, IDOPlant includes terms imported from other ontologies that 
describe plants, pathogens, and vectors, the geographic location and ecology of diseases 
and hosts, and molecular functions and interactions of hosts and pathogens. To encompass 
this range of data, we are suggesting in-house ontology development complemented with 
reuse of terms from orthogonal ontologies developed as part of the Open Biomedical 
Ontologies (OBO) Foundry. The study of plant diseases provides an example of how an 
ontological framework can be used to model complex biological phenomena such as plant 
disease, and how plant infectious diseases differ from, and are similar to, infectious diseases 
in other organism.

Abstract: A repository of clinically associated Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) isolates is used 
to semi-automatically generate a set of application ontologies for specific subfamilies of Sa-
related disease. Each such application ontology is compatible with the Infectious Disease 
Ontology (IDO) and uses resources from the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry. The 
set of application ontologies forms a lattice structure beneath the IDO Core and IDO 
extension reference ontologies. We show how this lattice can be used to define a strategy 
for the construction of a new taxonomy of infectious disease incorporating genetic, 
molecular, and clinical data. We also outline how faceted browsing and query of annotated 
data is supported using a lattice application ontology.

Abstract: Mental and behavioral disorders represent a signiﬁcant portion of the public 
health burden in all countries. The human cost of these disorders is immense, yet treatment 
options for sufferers are currently limited, with many patients failing to respond sufﬁciently 
to available interventions and drugs. High quality ontologies facilitate data aggregation and 
comparison across different disciplines, and may therefore speed up the translation of 
primary research into novel therapeutics. Realism-based ontologies describe entities in 
reality and the relationships between them in such a way that – once formulated in a suitable 
formal language – the ontologies can be used for sophisticated automated reasoning 
applications. Reference ontologies can be applied across different contexts in which 
different, and often mutually incompatible, domain-speciﬁc vocabularies have traditionally 
been used. In this contribution we describe the Mental Functioning Ontology (MF) and 
Mental Disease Ontology (MD), two realism-based ontologies currently under development 
for the description of humanmental functioning and disease. We describe the structure and 
upper levels of the ontologies and preliminary application scenarios, and identify some open 
questions.

Abstract: We have begun work on two separate but related ontologies for the study of 
neurological diseases. The first, the Neurological Disease Ontology (ND), is intended to 
provide a set of controlled, logically connected classes to describe the range of neurological 
diseases and their associated signs and symptoms, assessments, diagnoses, and 
interventions that are encountered in the course of clinical practice. ND is built as an 
extension of the Ontology for General Medical Sciences — a high-level candidate OBO 
Foundry ontology that provides a set of general classes that can be used to describe general 
aspects of medical science. ND is being built with classes utilizing both textual and 
axiomatized definitions that describe and formalize the relations between instances of other 
classes within the ontology itself as well as to external ontologies such as the Gene Ontology, 
Cell Ontology, Protein Ontology, and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest. In addition, 
references to similar or associated terms in external ontologies, vocabularies and 
terminologies are included when possible. Initial work on ND is focused on the areas of 
Alzheimer’s and other diseases associated with dementia, multiple sclerosis, and stroke and 
cerebrovascular disease. Extensions to additional groups of neurological diseases are 
planned. The second ontology, the NeuroPsychological Testing Ontology (NPT), is intended 
to provide a set of classes for the annotation of neuropsychological testing data. The 
intention of this ontology is to allow for the integration of results from a variety of 
neuropsychological 
tests

functioning. 
Neuropsychological testing is an important component in developing the clinical picture used 
in the diagnosis of patients with a range of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s 
disease and multiple sclerosis, and following stroke or traumatic brain injury. NPT is being 
developed as an extension to the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations.

“Annotating affective neuroscience data with the Emotion Ontology”, 
Towards an Ontology of Mental Functioning (ICBO Workshop), Third 
International Conference on Biomedical Ontology, Graz, July 22, 2012. 
Abstract: The Emotion Ontology is an ontology covering all aspects of emotional and 
affective mental functioning. It is being developed following the principles of the OBO 
Foundry and Ontological Realism. This means that in compiling the ontology, we emphasize 
the importance of the nature of the entities in reality that the ontology is describing. One of 
the ways in which realism-based ontologies are being successfully used within biomedical 
science is in the annotation of scientiﬁc research results in publicly available databases. 
Such annotation enables several objectives, including searching, browsing and cross-
database data integration. A key beneﬁt conferred by realism-based ontology is that suitably 
annotated research results are able to be aggregated and compared in a fashion that is 
based on the underlying reality that the science is studying. This has the potential of 
increasing the power of statistical analysis and meta-analysis in data-driven science. This 
aspect has been fruitfully exploited in the investigation of the functions of genes in molecular 
biology. Cognitive neuroscience uses functional neuroimaging to investigate the brain 
correlates of areas of mental functioning such as memory, planning and emotion. The use 
of functional neuroimaging to study affective phenomena such as the emotions is called 
‘affective neuroscience’. BrainMap is the largest curated database of coordinates and 
metadata for studies in cognitive neuroscience, including affective neuroscience (Laird et 
al., 2005). BrainMap data is already classiﬁed and indexed using a terminology for 
classiﬁcation, called the ‘Cognitive Paradigm Ontology’ (CogPO), that has been developed 

BARRY SMITH  
 
 
206 
 
 
to facilitate searching and browsing. However, CogPO has been developed speciﬁcally for 
the BrainMap database, and the data are thus far not annotated to a realism-based ontology 
which would allow the discovery of interrelationships between research results across 
different databases on the basis of what the research is about. In this contribution, we 
describe ongoing work that aims to annotate affective neuroscience data, starting with the 
BrainMap database, using the Emotion Ontology. We describe our objectives and technical 
approach to the annotation, and mention some of the challenges.

Abstract: We describe a strategy that is being used for the horizontal integration of 
warfighter intelligence data within the framework of the US Army’s Distributed Common 
Ground System Standard Cloud (DSC) initiative. The strategy rests on the development of 
a set of ontologies that are being incrementally applied to brcding about what we call the 
‘semantic enhancement’ of data models used within each intelligence discipline. We show 
how the strategy can help to overcome familiar tendencies to stovepiping of intelligence 
data, and describe how it can be applied in an agile fashion to new data resources in ways 
that address immediate needs of intelligence analysts.

Abstract: There are two important ways in which, when dealing with documents, we go 
beyond the boundaries of linear text. First, by incorporating diagrams into documents, and 
second, by creating complexes of intermeshed documents which may be extended in space 
and evolve and grow through time. The thesis of this paper is that such aggregations of 
documents are today indispensable to practically all complex human achievements from law 
and finance to orchestral performance and organized warfare. Documents provide for what 
we can think of as a division of intellectual, instructional, and deontic labour, allowing plans, 
orders, and obligations to be enmeshed together in a way that often involves the use of 
diagrammatic elements, as for example in a musical score.

Abstract: The Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program has always 
emphasized data standards to promote sharing and comparison of data across the CTSA 
Consortium and beyond. Yet creation and adoption of such standards is still painfully slow. 
Urgent action remains necessary. History shows the high value of standard terms, 
definitions, and symbols (i.e. ontology) to science. But the creation and adoption of such 

BARRY SMITH  
 
 
207 
 
 
standards often takes decades, as we show with two examples: chemical elements and units 
of measure. Translational science requires a consistent set of standard ontologies spanning 
all scales, from molecule to organism to population. But clinical terminologies at the 
macroscale – such as SNOMED and ICD – inhibit translational science. They are inconsistent 
with successful micro-scale ontologies such as the Gene Ontology, and they also cannot 
change rapidly with the advance of science. Translational science must settle on standards 
that evolve in a way that is closely tied to scientific advance. In the case of chemical symbols 
and SI Units adoption proceeded in three overlapping stages. First came widespread 
recognition and understanding of the problem. Second, influential stakeholders helped to 
develop, test, and select appropriate standards. Third, once scientifically useful standards 
emerged, the community enforced them via peer review. How can we accelerate progress 
on clinical ontologies through all three stages? The authors, all of whom are involved in the 
new CTS Ontology Affinity Group, sketch a plan for the Consortium to invest in and adopt 
standard clinical ontologies that are open and well disseminated, following the strategies of 
the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry, Neuroscience Information Framework, and eagle-

Abstract: Representing the kinetic state of a patient (posture, motion, and activity) during 
vital sign measurement is an important part of continuous monitoring applications, 
especially remote monitoring applications. In contextualized vital sign representation, the 
measurement result is presented in conjunction with salient measurement context 
metadata. We present an automated annotation system for vital sign measurements that 
uses ontologies from the Open Biomedical Ontology Foundry (OBO Foundry) to represent 
the patient’s kinetic state at the time of measurement. The annotation system is applied to 
data generated by a wearable personal status monitoring (PSM) device. We demonstrate 
how annotated PSM data can be queried for contextualized vital signs as well as sensor 
algorithm configuration parameters.

July 7, 2013, CEUR, vol. 1061, 1-2. 
Abstract: What follows is a summary of basic principles pertaining to the definitions used 
in constructing an ontology. A definition is a statement of necessary and sufficient 
conditions. What this means in the simplest case can be understood as follows. To say that 
ɸ-ing is a necessary condition for being an A is just another way of saying that every A ɸ’s; 
to say that ɸ-ing is a sufficient condition for being an A is just another way of saying that 
everything that ɸ’s is an A. The goal in writing a definition is to specify a set of conditions 
of this sort which are all necessary, and which are jointly sufficient.

which the content formulated with their aid will be available to computational reasoning.

Wrangling Using Ontology and Referent Tracking”, Proceedings of the Fifth 
International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO), Houston, 2014, 
(CEUR, 1327), 27-32. 
Abstract: Ontological realism aims at the development of high quality ontologies that 
faithfully represent what is general in reality and to use these ontologies to render 
heterogeneous data collections comparable. To achieve this second goal for clinical research 
datasets presupposes not merely (1) that the requisite ontologies already exist, but also (2) 
that the datasets in question are faithful to reality in the dual sense that (a) they denote 
only particulars and relationships between particulars that do in fact exist and (b) they do 
this in terms of the types and type-level relationships described in these ontologies. Using 
Referent Tracking as basis, we describe a strategy for addressing issue (2), which consists 
in creating for each dataset a template that, when applied to each particular record in the 
dataset, leads to the generation of a collection of Referent Tracking Tuples (RTT) built out 
of unique identifiers for the entities described by means of the data items in the record. The 
proposed strategy is based on (i) the distinction between data and what data are about, 
and (ii) the explicit descriptions of portions of reality which RTTs provide and which range 
not only over the particulars described by data items in a dataset, but also over these data 
items themselves. This last feature allows us to describe particulars that are only implicitly 
referred to by the dataset; to provide information about correspondences between data 
items in a dataset; and to assert which data items are unjustifiably or redundantly present 
in or absent from the dataset.

Representation of CDC Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Case Reports”, 
Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Biomedical Ontology 
(ICBO), Houston, 2014, (CEUR, 1327), 74-77. 
Abstract: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Active Bacterial Core 
Surveillance (CDC ABCs) Program is a collaborative effort betweeen the CDC, state health 
departments, laboratories, and universities to track invasive bacterial pathogens of 
particular importance to public health. The year-end surveillance reports produced by 
thisprogram help to shape public policy and coordinate responses to emerging infectious 
diseases over time. The ABC’s case report form (CRF) data represents an excellent 
opportunity for data reuse beyond the original surveillance purposes. In this work, we focus 
on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which has been tracked by the ABCs 
program since 2005. We use the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Staphyloccocus aureus 
extension ontology (IDO-Staph), along with other ontologies following the principles of the 
Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry (OBOF) to represent the entities referenced by the 
MRSA specific ABCs CRF. The goals of this effort are: (1) to demonstrate that infectious 
disease case report data can be positioned for reuse and linking to complementary data 
sources at the point of collection, (2) to identify any coverage gaps or limitations in the

Basic Formal Ontology”, Formal Ontology in Information Systems. 
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference (FOIS 2014), Amsterdam: 
IOS Press, 227-240. 
Abstract: Changes in an upper level ontology have obvious consequences for the domain 
ontologies that use it at lower levels. It is therefore crucial to document the changes made 
between successive versions of ontologies of this kind. We describe and apply a method for 
tracking, explaining and measuring changes between successive versions of upper level 
ontologies such as the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). The proposed change-tracking method 
extends earlier work on Realism-Based Ontology Versioning (RBOV) and Evolutionary 
Terminology Auditing (ETA). We describe here the application of this evaluation method to 
changes between BFO 1.0, BFO 1.1, and BFO 2.0. We discuss the issues raised by this 
application and describe the extensions which we added to the original evaluation schema 
in order to account for changes in an ontology of this type. Our results show that BFO has 
undergone eight types of changes that can be systematically explained by the extended 
evaluation schema. Finally, we discuss problematic cases, possible pitfalls and certain limits 
of our study that we propose to address in future work.

Territorial Disputes”, Proceedings of the Conference on Semantic Technology

(STIDS 2014), CEUR, vol. 1304, 2-9. 
Abstract: Disputes over territory are a major contributing factor to the disruption of 
international relations. We believe that a cumulative, integrated, and continuously updated 
resource providing information about such disputes in an easily accessible form would be of 
benefit to intelligence analysts, military strategists, political scientists, and also to historians 
and others concerned with international disputes. We propose an ontology-based strategy 
for creating such a resource. The resource will contain information about territorial disputes, 
arguments for and against claims pertaining to sovereignty, proffered evidence for such 
claims, political and military motives (overt or hidden), and associated conflicts. Our 
approach is designed to address several issues surrounding the representation of 
geopolitical conflict, including the tracking and individuation of disputes and the validation 
of disseminated information.

Abstract: Maintaining systems of military plans is critical for military effectiveness, but is 
also challenging. Plans will become obsolete as the world diverges from the assumptions on 
which they rest. If too many ad hoc changes are made to intermeshed plans, the ensemble 
may no longer lead to well-synchronized and coordinated operations, resulting in the system 
of plans becoming itself incoherent. We describe in what follows an Adaptive Planning 
process that we are developing on behalf of the Air Force Research Laboratory (Rome) with

the goal of addressing problems of these sorts through cyclical collaborative plan review 
and maintenance. The interactions of world state, blue force status and associated plans 
are too complex for manual adaptive processes, and computer-aided plan review and 
maintenance is thus indispensable. We argue that appropriate semantic technology can 1) 
provide richer representation of plan-related data and semantics, 2) allow for flexible, non-
disruptive, agile, scalable, and coordinated changes in plans, and 3) support more intelligent 
analytical querying of plan-related data.

Abstract: The Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) was created to serve as a domain‐neutral 
resource for the representation of types of information content entities (ICEs) such as 
documents, data‐bases, and digital images. We identify a series of problems with the current 
version of the IAO and suggest solutions designed to advance our understanding of the 
relations between ICEs and associated cognitive representations in the minds of human 
subjects. This requires embedding IAO in a larger framework of ontologies, including most 
importantly the Mental Functioning Ontology (MFO). It also requires a careful treatment of 
the aboutness relations between ICEs and associated cognitive representa‐tions and their 
targets in reality.

Abstract: Research has indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs), a special class of non-coding 
RNAs (ncRNAs), can perform important roles in different biological and pathological 
processes. miRNAs’ functions are realized by regulating their respective target genes 
(targets). It is thus critical to identify and analyze miRNA-target interactions for a better 
understanding and delineation of miRNAs’ functions. However, conventional knowledge 
discovery and acquisition methods have many limitations. Fortunately, semantic 
technologies that are based on domain ontologies can render great assistance in this regard. 
In our previous investigations, we developed a miRNA domain-specific application ontology, 
Ontology for MIcroRNA Target (OMIT), to provide the community with common data 
elements and data exchange standards in the miRNA research. This paper describes (1) our 
continuing efforts in the OMIT ontology development and (2) the application of the OMIT to 
enable a semantic approach for knowledge capture of miRNA-target interactions.

“Joint Doctrine Ontology: A Benchmark for Military Information Systems 
Interoperability”, Semantic Technology for Intelligence, Defense and 
Security (STIDS), 2015, CEUR vol. 1523, 2-9. 
Abstract: When the U.S. conducts warfare, elements of a force are drawn from different 
Services and work together as a single team to accomplish an assigned mission on the basis 
of joint doctrine. To achieve such unified action, it is necessary that specific Service 
doctrines be both consistent with and subservient to joint doctrine. Two less commonly 
addressed requirements flow from the ways in which, in an age of ever increasing flows of 
heterogeneous network data, unified action involves not only live forces but also automated 
systems. First, the information technology that is used in joint warfare must be aligned with 
joint doctrine. Second, the separate information systems used by the different elements of 
a joint force must be interoperable in the sense that data and information that is generated 
by each element must be usable (understandable, processible) by all the other elements 
which need them. Currently, such interoperability is impeded by multiple inconsistencies 
among different data and software standards. We describe here the on-going project of 
creating a Joint Doctrine Ontology (JDO), which uses joint doctrine to provide shared 
computer-accessible content valid for any field of military endeavor, organization, and 
information system. JDO addresses the two above-mentioned requirements of unified action 
by providing a widely applicable benchmark for use by developers of information systems 
that would both guarantee alignment with joint doctrine and support interoperability.

Abstract: Ontologies formally represent reality in a way that limits ambiguity and facilitates 
automated reasoning and data fusion, but is often daunting to the non-technical user. Thus, 
many researchers have endeavored to hide the formal syntax and semantics of ontologies 
behind the constructs of Controlled Natural Languages (CNLs), which retain the formal 
properties of ontologies while simultaneously presenting that information in a 
comprehensible natural language format. In this paper, we build upon previous work in this 
field by evaluating prospects of implementing International Technology Alliance Controlled

Materials”, Proceedings of International Design Engineering Technical 
Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference 
(IDETC/CIE 2016), August 21-24, 2016, Charlotte, NC  
Abstract: The development of manufacturing technologies for new materials involves the 
generation of a large and continually evolving volume of information. The analysis, 
integration and management of such large volumes of data, typically stored in multiple 
independently developed databases, creates significant challenges for practitioners. There 
is a critical need especially for open-sharing of data pertaining to engineering design which 
together with effective decision support tools can enable innovation. We believe that 
ontology applied to engineering (OE) represents a viable strategy for the alignment, 
reconciliation and integration of diverse and disparate data. The scope of OE includes: 
consistent capture of knowledge pertaining to the types of entities involved; facilitation of 
cooperation among diverse group of experts; more effective ongoing curation, and update 
of manufacturing data; collaborative design and knowledge reuse. As an illustrative case 
study we propose an ontology focused on the representation of composite materials focusing 
in particular on the class of Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) in particular. The scope of 
the ontology is to provide information about the components of such materials, the 
manufacturing processes involved in creation, and diversity of application ranging from 
additive manufacturing to restorative dentistry. The ontology is developed using Basic 
Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI).

Abstract: Given the assertion of a relation between two types such as: "Epidermis has part 
some Keratinocyte", we define silent change as any kind of change of the instance-relata of 
the relation in question that does not change the truth-value of the respective type-level 
assertion. Such assertions are notoriously difficult to model in OWL 2. To address this 
problem, we distinguish different modes of type-level relatedness giving rise to this problem 
and describe a conservative extension to the BFO top-level ontology that allows expressing 
these modes.

Abstract: Achieving space domain awareness requires the identification, characterization, 
and tracking of space objects.  Storing and leveraging associated space object data for 
purposes such as hostile threat assessment, object identification, and collision prediction 
and avoidance present further challenges. Space objects are characterized according to a 
variety of parameters including their identifiers, design specifications, components, 
subsystems, capabilities, vulnerabilities, origins, missions, orbital elements, patterns of life, 
processes, operational statuses, and associated persons, organizations, or nations. The 
Space Object Ontology provides a consensus-based realist framework for formulating such 
characterizations in a computable fashion. Space object data are aligned with classes and 
relations in the Space Object Ontology and stored in a dynamically updated Resource 
Description Framework triple store, which can be queried to support space domain 
awareness and the needs of spacecraft operators. This paper presents the core of the Space 
Object Ontology, discusses its advantages over other approaches to space object 
classification, and demonstrates its ability to combine diverse sets of data from multiple 
sources within an expandable framework. Finally, we show how the ontology provides 
benefits for enhancing and maintaining long-term space domain awareness.

Abstract: This paper presents the Obstetric and Neonatal Ontology (OntONeo). This 
ontology has been created to provide a consensus representation of salient electronic health 
record (EHR) data and to serve interoperability of the associated data and information 
systems. More generally, it will serve interoperability of clinical and translational data, for 
example deriving from genomics disciplines and from clinical trials. Interoperability of EHR 
data is important to ensuring continuity of care during the prenatal and postnatal periods 
for both mother and child. As a strategy to advance such interoperability we use an approach 
based on ontological realism and on the ontology development principles of the Open 
Biomedical Ontologies Foundry, including reuse of reference ontologies wherever possible. 
We describe the structure and coverage domain of OntONeo and the process of creating and 
maintaining the ontology.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) serve as repositories of documented data 
collected in a health care encounter. An EHR records information about who receives, who

additional elements relating to social relations in which the healthcare consumer is involved. 
To provide a consensus representation of common data and to enhance interoperability 
between different EHR repositories we have created a solution grounded in formal ontology. 
Here, we present how an ontology for the obstetric and neonatal domain deals with these 
general elements documented in health care encounters. Our goal is to promote the

with next-generation analysis methods and automated scoring of traits and phenotypes to 
develop improved varieties. The Planteome project (www.planteome.org) develops and 
hosts a suite of reference ontologies for plants associated with a growing corpus of genomics 
data. Data annotations linking phenotypes and germplasm to genomics resources are 
achieved by data transformation and mapping species-specific controlled vocabularies to 
the reference ontologies. Analysis and annotation tools are being developed to facilitate 
studies of plant traits, phenotypes, diseases, gene function and expression and genetic 
diversity data across a wide range of plant species. The project database and the online 
resources provide researchers tools to search and browse and access remotely via APIs for 
semantic integration in annotation tools and data repositories providing resources for plant 
biology, breeding, genomics and genetics.

International Conference on Biological Ontology (ICBO), CEUR 1747, 2016. 
Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies are essential biomedical research and clinical reagents 
that are produced by companies and research laboratories. The NIAID ImmPort 
(Immunology Database and Analysis Portal) resource provides a long-term, sustainable data 
warehouse for immunological data generated by NIAID, DAIT and DMID funded 
investigators for data archiving and re-use. A variety of immunological data is generated 
using techniques that rely upon monoclonal antibody reagents, including flow cytometry, 
immunofluorescence, and ELISA. In order to facilitate querying, integration, and reuse of 
data, standardized terminology for describing monoclonal antibody reagents and their 
targets needs to be used for annotating data submitted to ImmPort.

Foundry”, International Conference on Biological Ontology (ICBO), CEUR 
1747, 2016. 
Abstract: It is now generally accepted that wherever we need to address multiple different 
kinds of data deriving from multiple different kinds of sources, a strategy is required to 
ensure interoperability across the various systems involved. The United Nations 
Environmental Program (UNEP) is developing an ontology for use in their knowledge 
management platform – the Sustainable Development Goals Interface Ontology (SDGIO). 
The UNEP approach to achieving interoperability is modeled on the OBO (Open Biomedical 
Ontologies) Foundry, an initiative of ontology developers working in a range of life science 
domains who have been working since 2004 to develop a suite of ontologies which would 
work together consistently in such a way as to advance the integration of data. To serve 
such integration the OBO Foundry members formulated and tested an evolving set of

principles for ontology development which are now being used by ontology developers also 
in other areas, including manufacturing, geology, transport and security.

for entities and mereotopological relations in ontologies, Ontobras, Brasilia, 
August 28-30, 2017, CEUR 1908. 
Abstract: In the graphical representation of ontologies, it is customary to use graph theory 
as the representational background. We claim here that the standard graph-based approach 
has a number of limitations. We focus here on a problem in the graph-based representation 
of ontologies in complex domains such as biomedical, engineering and manufacturing: lack 
of mereotopological representation. Based on such limitation, we proposed a diagrammatic 
way to represent an entity’s structure and various forms of mereotopological relationships 
between the entities.

Abstract: In the specific case of geography, the real world consists on the one hand of 
physical geographic features (bona fide objects) and on the other hand of various fiat 
objects, for example legal and administrative objects, including parcels of real estate, areas 
of given soil types, census tracts, and so on. It contains in addition the beliefs and actions 
of human beings directed towards these objects (for example, the actions of those who work 
in land registries or in census bureaux), and the relations between these beliefs and actions 
and their targets.

Towards an Axiomatized Upper-Level Ontology, IMISE Report, University of 
Leipzig, 2001.  
Abstract: Every domain-specific ontology must use as a framework some upper-level 
ontology which describes the most general domain-independent categories of reality. In the 
present paper we sketch a new type of upper-level ontology, and we outline an associated 
knowledge modelling language called GOL – for: General Ontological Language. It turns out 
that the upper-level ontology underlying well-known standard modelling languages such as 
KIF, F-Logic and CycL is restricted to the ontology of sets. In a set theory which allows 
Urelements, however, there will be ontological relations between these Urelements which 
the set-theoretic machinery cannot capture. In contrast to standard modelling and 
representation formalisms, GOL provides a machinery for representing and analysing such 
ontologically basic relations. GOL is thus a genuine extension of KIF and of similar 
languages. In GOL entities are divided into sets and Urelements, the latter being divided in 
their turn into individuals and universals. Foremost among the individuals are things or 
substances, tropes or moments, and situoids: entities containing facts as components.

The objective of this research programme is to contribute to the establishment of the 
emerging science of Formal Ontology in Information Systems via a collaborative project 
involving researchers from a range of disciplines including philosophy, logic, computer 
science, linguistics, and the medical sciences. The researchers will work together on the 
construction of a unified formal ontology, which means: a general  framework for the 
construction of ontological theories in specific domains. The framework will be constructed 
using the axiomatic-deductive method of modern formal ontology. It will be tested via a 
series of applications relating to on-going work in Leipzig on medical taxonomies and data 
dictionaries in the context of clinical trials. This will lead to the production of a domain-
specific ontology which is designed to serve as a basis for applications in the medical field.

Abstract: We propose an ontological theory that is powerful enough to describe both 
complex spatio-temporal processes and the enduring entities that participate in such 
processes. For this purpose we distinguish between ontologies and metaontology. 
Ontologies are based on very simple directly depicting languages and fall into two major 
categories: ontologies of type SPAN and ontologies of type SNAP. These represent two 
complementary perspectives on reality and result in distinct though compatible systems of 
categories. In a SNAP (snapshot) ontology we have the enduring entities in a given domain 
as they exist to be inventoried at some given moment of time. In a SPAN ontology we have 
perduring entities such as processes and their parts and aggregates. We argue that both 
kinds of ontology are required, together with the meta-ontology which joins them together.

On the level of meta-ontology we are able to impose constraints on ontologies of a sort 
which can support efﬁcient processing of large amounts of data.

Integration of Medical Coding Systems and Electronic Patient Records, 
IFOMIS Reports, 2004. 
Abstract: In the last two decades we have witnessed considerable efforts directed towards 
making electronic healthcare records comparable and interoperable through advances in 
record architectures and (bio)medical terminologies and coding systems. Deep semantic 
issues in general, and ontology in particular, have received some interest from the research 
communities. However, with the exception of work on so-called ‘controlled vocabularies’, 
ontology has thus far played little role in work on standardization. The prime focus has been 
rather the rapid population of terminologies at the level of fine detail. In this paper, we 
argue that more efforts are needed on the side of both research and standardization to 
ensure that the coding systems used in electronic healthcare records enjoy a semantics that 
is coherent with the semantics of the record. We propose realist ontology as a method to 
bring about this coherence by means of a robust system of top-level ontological categories.

Context of a Task-Based Clinical Guidelines Model, IFOMIS Reports, 2004. 
An important part of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is its Semantic Network, 
consisting of 134 Semantic Types connected to each other by edges formed by one or more 
of 54 distinct Relation Types. This Network is however for many purposes over-complex, 
and various groups have thus made attempts at simplification. Here we take this work 
further by simplifying the relations which involve the three Semantic Types – Diagnostic 
Procedure, Laboratory Procedure and Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure. We define 
operators which can be used to generate terms instantiating types from this selected set 
when applied to terms designating certain other Semantic Types, including almost all the 
terms specifying clinical tasks. Usage of such operators thus provides a useful and 
economical way of specifying clinical tasks. The operators allow us to define a mapping 
between those types within the UMLS which do not represent clinical tasks and those which 
do. This mapping then provides a basis for an ontology of clinical tasks that can be used in 
the formulation of computer-interpretable clinical guideline models.

Abstract: Best practices in ontology building for biomedicine have been frequently 
discussed in recent years. However there is a range of seemingly disparate views 
represented by experts in the field. These views not only reflect the different uses to which 
ontologies are put, but also the experiences and disciplinary background of these experts 
themselves. We asked six questions related to biomedical ontologies to what we believe is

conclusions which we believe can help provide an insight into the practical problems which

Abstract: Semantic interoperability can be defined as the ability of two or more computer 
systems to exchange information in such a way that the meaning of that information can 
be automatically interpreted by the receiving system accurately enough to produce useful 
results to the end users of both systems. Several activities are currently being performed 
by a variety of stakeholders to achieve semantic interoperability in healthcare. Many of 
these activities are not beneficial, because they place too great a focus on business aspects 
and not enough on involvement of the right sorts of researchers, in particular those that are 
able to see how the data and information relate to the entities of concern on the side of the 
patient. The lack of a central focus on the patient, and the associated focus on ‘concepts’, 

BARRY SMITH

have spawned a variety of mutually incompatible terminologies exhibiting non-resolvable 
overlap. The predominance of the healthcare IT industry in the writing and selection of 
semantic interoperability standards mitigates against the benefits that standards, when well 
designed, can bring about. 
23. Fabian Neuhaus and Barry Smith, Ontology Summit 2010 Communiqué: 
Creating the Ontologists of the Future, Gaithersburg, MD: National Institute 
for Standards and Technology, March 2010. 
Abstract: Increasingly, major national and international projects and systems centered on 
ontology technology are being developed and deployed by governments and by scientific 
and commercial organizations. This brings a growing need for ontology expertise and thus 
for new methods and organizations for the education and training of ontologists. The goal 
of the Ontology Summit 2010 was to develop a strategy for the education of ontologists. To 
achieve this goal we studied how ontologists are currently trained, the requirements by 
organizations that hire ontologists, and developments that might impact the training of 
ontologists in the future.  
The main findings and results of the Ontology Summit 2010 are: (1) That there is already 
a large demand for trained ontologists, and the demand is expected to increase as ontology-
based technologies become more successful and as the quantities and number of different 
types of data continues to expand. (2) That there are very few formal training opportunities 
for ontologists, and they often do not meet the needs of trainees or of those who would hire 
them. (3) That organizations wanting to hire ontologists often have difficulties in identifying 
qualified candidates since there are so few formal qualifications in ontology, and there is no 
professional organization that certifies ontologists.  
We developed recommendations for the body of knowledge that should be taught and the 
skills that should be developed by future ontologists; these recommendations are intended 
as guidelines for institutions and organizations that may consider establishing a program 
for training ontologists. Further, we recommend a number of specific actions for the 
community to pursue as a follow-up to the Ontology Summit 2010 that will improve the 
education of ontologists

Abstract: The integration of standardized biomedical terminologies into a single, unified 
knowledge representation system has formed a key area of applied informatics research in 
recent years. The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is the most advanced and most 
prominent effort in this direction, bringing together within its Metathesaurus a large number 
of distinct source-terminologies. The UMLS Semantic Network, which is designed to support 
the integration of these source-terminologies, has proved to be a highly successful 
combination of formal coherence and broad scope. We argue here, however, that its 
organization manifests certain structural problems, and we describe revisions which we 
believe are needed if the network is to be maximally successful in realizing its goals of 
supporting terminology integration.

Abstract: The Plant Ontology (PO: http://www.plantontology.org) is a structured 
vocabulary and database resource for all plant scientists that links plant anatomy, 
morphology and development to the rapidly expanding field of plant genomics. The primary 
purpose of the PO is to facilitate cross-database querying and to foster consistent use of 
vocabularies in annotation. Originally designed to span the monocot-dicot divide in flowering 
plants, the PO has been redesigned to encompass a wider variety of angiosperm species, 
as well as gymnosperms, pteridophytes (ferns), lycophytes (lycopods) and bryophytes 
(liverworts, mosses and hornworts). Recent changes in the PO include the addition of more 
than 80 new terms to accommodate non-seed plants, with an emphasis on those needed to 
annotate gene expression from the Physcomitrella patens genome. An essential feature of 
the PO is the set of freely accessible web links from terms to associated annotations, which 
are structure- or development-specific genes, proteins and phenotypes sourced from 
numerous plant genomics datasets. Currently, the PO includes over 2 million such 
annotations associated with over 1,300 terms. Outreach activities include workshops, 
conference presentations and outreach booths. Also, image libraries are being created 
through PlantSystematics.org and linked to PO terms to provide reference images for plant 
structure terms. The PO is a valuable resource for both research and teaching that can be 
used as a guide to plant structures and growth and developmental landmarks in life cycles 
of plants across many taxa.

The Plant Ontology is a structured vocabulary and database resource for all plant scientists 
that links plant anatomy, morphology and development to the rapidly expanding field of 
plant genomics. Recent changes in the PO include the addition of more than 80 new terms

facilitate cross-database querying and to foster consistent use of vocabularies in annotation. 
The use of ontologies ensures consistent annotations within and across species, enabling 
both prediction of gene function and cross-species comparisons of gene expression. An 
essential, powerful feature of the PO is the set of links from terms to associated annotations, 
which are structure- or development-specific genes, proteins and phenotypes sourced from 
numerous plant genomics datasets. Currently, the PO includes over 2 million annotations 
associated with over 1,300 terms. We will give a brief tutorial on how to access the PO and 
associated data, and demonstrate the utility of linking Physcomitrella gene expression data 
to PO terms. The combination of ontology terms and the annotation of diverse gene 
expression and phenotype data sets facilitates diverse analyses, including assessing the 
similarity between genes of inter- or intra-specific origin and the exploration of structural 
homologies among organs, tissues and cell types.

Ontology, A Controlled and Structured Plant Vocabulary for All Botanical 
Disciplines”, Botany 2013, New Orleans, July 17-21, 2013. 
Abstract: Recently, plant genome sequencing has expanded to different species of plants. 
This has dramatically expanded our knowledge of gene expression in plant structures and 
development, as well as plant evolution. However, due to the vast phylogenetic diversity 
within the plant kingdom some inconsistencies with terminology have occurred. These 
conflicting plant vocabularies challenge advancement in the plant sciences; therefore, it is 
important to have a consistent plant structure vocabulary that encompasses all green 
plants. The Plant Ontology (PO) has been constructed as a well-structured vocabulary 
whether the terms are anatomical or developmental. The PO also annotates gene expression 
data to a wide diversity of plant parts and stages of development, for example, terms can 
be linked with relevant genes that are expressed during the development of a certain 
structure. Terms are arranged in a hierarchical structure in which taxon-specific annotations 
occur; this provides the opportunity for users to compare gene expression in homologous 
structures across clades. This serves as a critical aid for plant scientists who incorporate 
large data sets to engage questions on genomics, development, and comparative genetics 
across different plant groups. The Plant Ontology also provides other resources for plant 
biologists to use such as the Annotation of Image Segments with Ontologies program 
(AISO), allowing users to annotate plant structures with relevant terminology and genes

Abstract: Statistics play a critical role in biological and clinical research. To promote 
logically consistent representation and classification of statistical entities, we have 
developed the Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS). OBCS extends the 
Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), an OBO Foundry ontology supported by some 
20 communities. Currently, OBCS contains 686 terms, including 381 classes imported from 
OBI and 147 classes specific to OBCS. The goal of this paper is to present OBCS for

Smith, Pankaj Jaiswal, “Common Reference Ontologies for Plant Biology: A 
Platform for Integrative Plant Genomics”, Proceedings of Plant and Animal 
Genome XXII, San Diego, CA, 2014 (Poster). 
Abstract: Around the world, a small number of plant species serve as the primary source 
of food for the human population, yet these crops are vulnerable to multiple stressors, such 
as diseases, nutrient deficiencies and unfavorable environmental conditions. Traditional 
breeding methods for plant improvement may be combined with next-generation methods 
such as automated scoring of traits and phenotypes to develop improved varieties. Linking 
these analyses to the growing corpus of genomics data generated by high-throughput 
sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, phenomics and genome annotation projects 
requires common, interoperable, reference vocabularies (ontologies) for the description of 
the data. The ‘Common Reference Ontologies for Plant Biology’ (cROP) initiative is building 
the needed suite of reference ontologies, together with enhanced data storage and 
visualization technologies. The cROP will assume the further development of the existing 
Plant Ontology (PO), Plant Trait Ontology (TO), and Plant Environment Ontology (EO) and 
will develop the Plant Stress Ontology (PSO) for abiotic and biotic stresses. It will also 
include relevant aspects of ontologies such as Gene Ontology (GO), Cell Type (CL), Chemical 
Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI), Protein Ontology (PRO) and the Phenotypic Qualities 
Ontology (PATO). It will include a centralized platform where reference ontologies for plants 
will be used to access cutting-edge data resources for plant traits, phenotypes, diseases, 
genomes and semantically-queried gene expression and genetic diversity data across a wide 
range of plant species. cROP will unify and streamline a fragmented semantic framework 
and will support allele discovery, advance the understanding of crop evolution, and facilitate 
crop development.

“Ontobull and BFOConvert: Web-based programs to support automatic 
ontology conversion”, International Conference on Biological Ontology 
(ICBO), CEUR 1747, 2016. 
When a widely reused ontology appears in a new version which is not compatible with older 
versions, the ontologies reusing it need to be updated accordingly. Ontobull 
(http://ontobull.hegroup.org) has been developed to automatically update ontologies with 
new term IRI(s) and associated metadata to take account of such version changes. To use 
the Ontobull web interface a user is required to (i) upload one or more ontology OWL source 
files; (ii) input an ontology term IRI mapping; and (where needed) (iii) provide update 
settings for ontology headers and XML namespace IDs. Using this information, the backend 
Ontobull Java program automatically updates the OWL ontology files with desired term IRIs 
and ontology metadata. The Ontobull subprogram BFOConvert supports the conversion of 
an ontology that imports a previous version of BFO. A use case is provided to demonstrate 
the features of Ontobull and BFOConvert.

Abstract: Both ‘Sachverhalt’ and ‘state of affairs’ seem to have been derived from the 
juridical ‘status’ in the sense of 'status rerum' meaning: state or constitution of things. 
‘Status’ signifies also in an extended sense ‘the way things stand, the condition or peculiarity 
of a thing in regard to its circumstances, position, order’. We describe the history of usage 
of ‘Sachverhalt’ from these beginnings, addressing the role of Goclenius, Lotze, Stumpf, 
Husserl and Adolf Reinach, whose theory of the relations between judgment and Sachverhalt 
served as one starting point for the development of Reinach’s theory of speech acts in 1913.

12. “Realistic Phenomenology”, in L. Embree (ed.), Encyclopedia of 
Phenomenology, Dordrecht/Boston/London: Kluwer, 1997, 586–590.  
Abstract: The tradition of realist phenomenology was founded in around 1902 by a group 
of students in Munich interested in the newly published Logical Investigations of Edmund 
Husserl. Initial members of the group included Johannes Daubert, Alexander Pfänder, Adolf 
Reinach and Max Scheler. With Reinach’s move to Göttingen the group acquired two new 
prominent members – Edith Stein and Roman Ingarden. The group’s method turned on 
Husserl’s idea that we are in possession a priori (which is to say: non-inductive) knowledge 
of entities (for example, colors, tones, values, shapes) of a range of different sorts. Pfänder 
applied this method in his descriptive psychology of willing and motivation, Reinach 
(anticipating the later speech act theory) to what he called ‘social acts’, Stein to the ontology 
of communities, and Ingarden to works of art and aesthetic phenomena. The movement 
latter, through Ingarden, lived on in Poland, where it influenced the young Karol Wojtyła. 
13. “Austria” in L. Embree (ed.), Encyclopedia of Phenomenology, 
Dordrecht/Boston/London: Kluwer, 1997, 43–48. 
Abstract: Philosophy in the German-speaking world can be divided inlo two loose traditions, 
which we might refer to as the German and the Austrian (or Austro-Hungarian), 
respectively. The main line of the first begins with Kant, Fichte, Hegel and Scheling and 
ends with Heidegger and his contemporary followers. The main line of the second embraces 
the philosophy of Prague, Lemberg (now Lwiv), and Cracow as much as that of Vienna and 
Graz. It begins with Bolzano, Mach, Brentano, Meinong and Twardowski and ends with 
Willgenstein, Neurath and Popper. Here we describe the evolution of this Austrian tradition, 
paying special attention to the role of phenomenology therein.

Abstract: Where humans can manipulate and integrate the information they receive in 
subtle and ever-changing ways from context to context, computers need structured and 
context-free background information of a sort which ontologies can help to provide. A 
domain ontology captures the stable, highly general and commonly accepted core 
knowledge for an application domain. The domain at issue here is that of the life sciences, 
in particular molecular biology and bioinformatics. Contemporary life science research 
includes components drawn from physics, chemistry, mathematics, medicine and many 
other areas, and all of these dimensions, as well as fundamental philosophical issues, must 
be taken into account in the construction of a domain ontology. Here we describe the basic 
features of domain ontologies in the life sciences and show how they can be used.

Abstract: While Darwin is commonly supposed to have demonstrated the inapplicability of 
the Aristotelian ontology of species to biological science, recent developments, especially in 
the wake of the Human Genome Project, have given rise to a new golden age of classification 
in which ontological ideas – as for example in the Gene Ontology, the Cell Ontology, the 
Protein Ontology, and so forth – are once again playing an important role. In regard to 
species, on the other hand, matters are more complex. We provide a brief overview of 
recent proposals concerning the ontology of species, dealing with species as sets, classes 
and as collections, the views of Ernst Meyr, and mereological views.

Abstract: We review an influential series of lectures on analytic philosophy published in 
1976 by the West German philosopher Ernst Tugendhat focusing on Tugendhat's treatment 
of Husserl, and particularly on issues connected with the notion of dependence or 
Abhängigkeit central to Husserl's philosophy. These issues are of interest not only because 
Tugendhat's work is one of the few contributions to contemporary analytic philosophy in 
which they are confronted explicitly, but also because what he has to say about Husserl and 
dependence illustrates well both the positive and the negative thrust of his argument.

Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 46 (1985), 170–173. 
Abstract: The thesis of Delius's book is that statements of self-awareness such as "I am 
aware that I see a cat" possess what he calls 'Cartesian characteristics' of indubitability or 
absolute self-evidence. He argues that this is the case in virtue of the fact that such 
statements are not about anything independent of themselves. The book is described as a 
'semantical inquiry', but it is not by any means a contribution to the philosophy of language 
of the predictable sort. Statements of self-awareness express what Delius calls 'egological 
experiences', and the subject of the book is most accurately described as consisting in the 
relations between egological statements and egological experiences, in a sense made clear 
in the course of the book.

Abstract: This edition of Husserl's correspondence comprises 10 volumes. Its philosophical 
core is contained in the first four volumes, which correspond to the four phases of Husserl's 
philosophical career: as follower of Brentano, as mentor of the realist phenomenologists in 
Munich (the founders of the 'phenomenological movement'), and as professor, successively, 
in Göttingen and Freiburg. The remaining five volumes pertain to HusserI's correspondence 
with philosophers and other scholars outside the inner circle of the phenomenological 
movement, with institutions and editors, and with family members and friends. Volume 10 
comprises a masterly introduction to the edition by the editors, Karl and Elisabeth 
Schuhmann, together with chronological tables and seven separate indexes enabling the 
user to trace references in the letters to Husserl's own publications, manuscripts and 
lectures, as well as to persons, institutions and places.
