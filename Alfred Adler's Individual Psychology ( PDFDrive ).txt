to Gestalt Theory 
Adler was the 1st to try Family Therapy 

Adlerian Theory Today 
Child Therapy is the major arena for 
Adlerian Theory today 
Child Guidance Centers – non-profit 
counseling centers to help families deal 
with misbehavior in children 
Rudolf Dreikurs – a disciple of Adler, 
adapted Adlerian Theory to Child 
Psychology – book ―Children the Challenge‖ 

Dreikurs’ Theory of Mistaken 
Goals of Childhood 
If a child is discouraged – feels inferior – 
doesn’t feel useful 
Their 1st strategy is usually to seek Undue 
Attention to feel important 
If that strategy doesn’t work – they will move 
one of two ways:   
They may switch to a goal of Power 
Or they will intensify the seeking of attention by 
Demonstrating Total Inadequacy 

Dreikurs’ Theory of Mistaken 
Goals of Childhood 
Mistaken Goal – Power 
Believes that the only person who matters is 
the one in control 
Will defy authority and be uncooperative 
If they are unable to win power struggle – will 
then escalate to a goal of Revenge 

Dreikurs’ Theory of Mistaken 
Goals of Childhood

Total 
Inadequacy 
 
     Revenge 

Changing Mistaken Goals 
Parenting 
Undue Attention 
Give a child lots of due attention – when the situation 
allows for the child to be the center 
If a child demands undue attention – when the 
situation does not allow for attention to be given – 
withdraw from and ignore the child 
Demonstrating Complete Inadequacy 
Give a child lots of encouragement – you can do it! 
Never do something for a child that they are capable 
of doing for themselves! 
 

Changing Mistaken Goals 
Parenting 
Power 
Don’t play the power struggle game – withdraw from 
the situation – ignore tantrums 
Give a child a choice between two acceptable 
alternatives, spell out the consequences of each 
choice, and calmly enforce their choice  
Revenge 
This is a very discouraged child – give lots of 
encouragement at appropriate times 
Work on building social interest – serve others 
together – affirm the child’s value and significance
