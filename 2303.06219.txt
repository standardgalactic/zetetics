Abstract 
As AI systems proliferate, their greenhouse gas emissions are an increasingly important concern 
for human societies.  We analyze the emissions of several AI systems (ChatGPT, BLOOM, 
DALL-E2, Midjourney) relative to those of humans completing the same tasks.  We find that an 
AI writing a page of text emits 130 to 1500 times less CO2e than a human doing so. Similarly, 
an AI creating an image emits 310 to 2900 times less. Emissions analysis do not account for 
social impacts such as professional displacement, legality, and rebound effects. In addition, AI is 
not a substitute for all human tasks.  Nevertheless, at present, the use of AI holds the potential to 
carry out several major activities at much lower emission levels than can humans. 
  
 

 
 
Introduction 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has made rapid advancements in recent years, with applications in a 
wide range of domains such as healthcare (1), finance (2), transportation (3), and environmental 
conservation (4). However, as the uses of AI have become more prevalent, concerns have also 
been raised about AI’s detrimental impact on the environment, in particular the energy 
consumption required to train and run AI models and accompanying greenhouse gas emissions 
(e.g., 5, 6).  For example, training the model for GPT-3, one of the most powerful systems 
currently in broad deployment, produces emissions equivalent to the lifetime impact of five cars 
(7).  
  
Several of the skills that AI is being trained to execute---such as the ability to write or to create 
images---are activities that previously were almost exclusively the domain of humans. In this 
article, we analyze the environmental impact of several AI systems in relative terms, comparing 
their emissions to those of humans completing the same task. Specifically, we focus on the tasks 
of writing and illustration. By comparing the environmental impact of these tasks when 
completed by AI versus humans, we highlight the substitutability between humans and AI, and 
demonstrate that, while AI has substantial environmental costs, at present these costs are 
typically far lower than for a human completing the same task.  
  

We recognize that these findings are not generalizable to all contexts. While AI use may be 
beneficial in some writing and illustration contexts, not all activities lend themselves to AI 
intervention.  In fact, AI and humans cooperating on tasks may remain the best approach in many 
fields.  In addition, these findings are based on the current state of AI and human activity; future 
changes in technology and society will likely change the environmental impact of both AI (8, 9) 
and that of humans (10). There are also other complicating factors that need to be considered, 
such as professional displacement, legal use of training materials, and rebound effects. 
Nevertheless, the findings presented here suggest that concerns about the emissions generated by 
AI systems should be tempered by recognition that, even relying on cautious assumptions, 
humans produce far more emissions when engaging in some of the same tasks.  While AI is often 
portrayed as an environmental threat to humanity, in this respect, at least, it may offer us 
valuable assistance. 
Results 
Writing: AI vs. Human 
AI Writing 
While it can be difficult to define the scope of the problem when calculating the emissions 
produced by an AI system (5), two major components of that impact are the training of the model 
(a one-time cost that is amortized across many individual queries) and the per-query emissions. 
To offer two data points on the environmental impact of training models, training GPT-3 (the 
system on which the popular ChatGPT chatbot is based (11)) produces approximately 552 metric 

tons CO2e (8).  Training BLOOM, a model slightly larger and substantially more energy-
efficient than GPT-3, produces 30 metric tons of CO2e (8).  
  
In addition to the amortized emissions of training, responding to each prompt carries its own 
emission footprint as well. An online estimate for ChatGPT (albeit an informal one) estimates 
that it produces 0.382 grams CO2e per query (12), based on 3.82 metric tons CO2e per day 
divided by 10,000,000 queries per day.  A deployment of BLOOM produced 1.5 grams per query 
(340kg CO2e divided by 230,768 queries) (9). 
  
Estimating that ChatGPT may do a full re-training of the model once per month, and continuing 
with the estimate of 10,000,000 queries per day, the 552 metric tons divided by 300,000,000 
queries equates to 1.84 grams CO2e per query.  Together, the training and operation for ChatGPT 
sum to 2.2 grams CO2e per queries. For BLOOM, assuming a similar level of usage and 
frequency of retraining as for ChatGPT, the per-query impact of training is 0.10 gram CO2e, and 
the per-query cost is 1.47 grams, summing to 1.6 grams per query.  These figures suggest that the 
impact of an AI query, including both amortized training and the query itself, is on the order of a 
few grams CO2e. 
Human Writing 
An article in The Writer magazine suggests that Mark Twain’s output of approximately 300 
words per hour, is “about the average when examining the daily work of other writers” (13). The 
emission footprint of a US resident is approximately 15 metric tons CO2e per year (14), or 
approximately 1.7kg CO2e per hour. Therefore, assuming that a person’s emissions while writing 
are in line with their overall annual impact, we propose that the carbon footprint for a US 

resident generating a page of text (250 words) is approximately 1400 grams CO2e.  For a resident 
of India, by comparison, the annual impact is 1.9 metric tons (14), which equates to 
approximately 180 grams CO2e per page. We use the US and India here as the countries with the 
highest and lowest per capita impact among large countries (over 300M population). 
  
In addition to the footprint of the person writing, the footprint of a computer running for the 
length of time it takes a human to write a page, approximately 0.8 hours, is itself far more 
impactful than the AIs.  Assuming an average of 75 Watts for a typical laptop computer (15), the 
laptop produces 27 grams of CO2e (16). (We note that green energy providers may reduce the 
amount of CO2e resulting from this amount of computing, and that the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas 
Equivalencies Calculator we used for this conversion masks a great deal of complexity on this 
topic. Nevertheless, for the purpose of comparison to humans, we assume that the EPA 
calculator captures the relationship adequately.) A desktop computer uses 200 Watts, producing 
72 grams CO2e in the same amount of time. 
Comparison 
Figure 1 compares several variations of authorship: BLOOM is 1500 times less impactful, per 
page of text produced, than a US resident writing, and 190 times less impactful than a resident of 
India writing.  ChatGPT is 1100 times less impactful than a US resident writing, and 130 times 
less impactful than a resident of India writing. Assuming the quality of writing produced by AI is 
sufficient for whatever task may be at hand, AI produces less CO2e per page than a human 
author. 
  

 
Figure 1: This figure compares the CO2e emissions of AI and humans engaged in the task of 
writing one page of text. AI writing (BLOOM or ChatGPT) produces 130 to 1400 times less 
CO2e per page than a human author. AI also produces substantially less CO2e than the computer 
usage to support humans doing that writing. 
 
Authorship does not exist in a vacuum, and any accounting for the return on energy expenditure 
is confounded by the impact to the rest of the network in which it is embedded.  For example, 
successful AI deployments may beget more costly models in the future, more frequent prompts 
by users, or more costly training schedules.  On the other hand, human authorship may implicitly 
be training for other kinds of productive human work that would be lost in the face of the 
proliferation of AI writing.  The freed human time may also incur new unexpected 
environmental costs.   
 
 

Illustration: AI vs. Human  
Two prominent AI image generation engines are DALL-E2 and Midjourney.  DALL-E2 is based 
on an underlying GPT-3 engine (similar to ChatGPT above), and Midjourney is based on a 
system called Stable Diffusion.   
AI Illustrator 
Given the shared reliance on GPT-3, we estimate that DALL-E2’s footprint is similar to the 
footprint of ChatGPT calculated above: 2.2 grams CO2e per query. To estimate the impact of 
Midjourney, we take a different approach, based on statements made by Midjourney’s CEO 
David Holz.  Holz stated, with regard to Midjourney’s computer usage, that “[e]very image is 
taking petaops … So 1000s of trillions of operations. I don't know exactly whether it's five or 10 
or 50. But it's 1000s of trillions of operations to make an image… [W]ithout a doubt, there has 
never been a service before where a regular person is using this much compute” (17).  
  
AI data centers, such as Google’s Compute Engine (18), often run on Nvidia A100 GPUs (19).  
These GPUs can process 1.25 petaoperations per second while using 400 Watts of electricity 
(19).  In the largest-emissions scenario (from Holz’s comments), generating an image requires 50 
petaoperations; therefore, the AI would need to run on that device for 40 seconds.  This work 
would require 4.5Wh to process, or 1.9 grams CO2e (16).   
Human Illustrator 
There is a wide range of time that it may take for a human illustrator to produce an illustration. 
To arrive at an estimate for how long it takes, on average, we combined the average cost for an 

illustration project ($200 (20)), and the average hourly rate of pay for an illustrator ($62.50/hour 
(20)). Based on these figures, we propose that 3.2 hours per illustration is a viable estimate for a 
professional illustrator producing a commercial piece of work based on a provided specification, 
across a wide range of styles and formats.  Since the environmental footprint for a US resident is 
approximately 15 metric tons CO2e per year (14), we calculate that the carbon footprint for a US-
based illustrator is approximately 5500 grams CO2e per image.  For a resident of India, by 
comparison, the impact would be approximately 690 grams CO2e per image (14). 
  
The carbon footprint for a laptop operating for the duration of a human illustrator creating an 
image (3.2 hours) is 100 grams CO2e. The footprint of that duration for a desktop computer is 
280 grams CO2e.   
 
Figure 2: This figure compares the CO2e emissions of AI and humans engaged in the task of 
creating one image. AI image creation produces 310-2900 times less CO2e per image than 
human creators. AI produces many times less CO2e than computer usage to support humans 
making images. 

Comparison 
Figure 2 shows that DALL-E2 emits approximately 2500 times less CO2e than a US-based artist, 
and approximately 310 times less than an India-based artist.  Midjourney emits approximately 
2900 times less CO2e than a US artist, and 370 times less than one based in India. Here, as with 
the writing analysis above, both laptop and desktop usage while supporting a human drawing an 
image would themselves be many times more impactful than the AI systems as well. 
Discussion 
The findings above demonstrate that the environmental footprint of AI completing two major 
tasks is substantially lower than that of humans completing those same tasks. 
  
The results for each specific task reflect an array of assumptions about the nature of these tasks 
and the people and AIs engaged in such tasks. For example, writing an in-depth, heavily-
referenced, original article on a niche scientific topic is currently beyond the capabilities of an 
AI, and therefore is a context where human effort is more efficient than AI effort (since the AI 
cost for such a task is effectively infinite, at present). In the domain of illustration, drawing a 
stick figure is likely faster for a human than an AI at present (and therefore may have lower 
emissions due to dramatically lower speed), whereas the reverse is true for a complex illustration 
such as one resembling an oil painting. Nevertheless, despite these specific regions of the task-
space where humans have lower emissions, the data presented in this paper suggest that, overall, 
the use of AI can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of certain tasks when compared to 
equivalent human activity.  
  

These findings are also based on the current state of AI and human activity; future changes in 
technology and society will undoubtedly change the relative environmental impact of AI as well. 
For example, as evidenced by the order-of-magnitude difference in emissions from training 
GPT-3 (8) vs. training BLOOM (9) despite similar sized training data, algorithmic advances may 
profoundly reduce the footprint of AI systems, as has already been hypothesized (8). 
Alternatively, advances may improve the performance of AI, but at the cost of dramatic increases 
in energy use and accompanying emissions. For example, the possibility of ubiquitous 
personalization of AI content, in which all media consumed by everyone on earth---every book, 
every movie, every game, every educational worksheet---has been precisely tailored to that 
individual’s unique and evolving preferences, paves the way for vastly greater emissions 
footprints for future AI systems. Whether the net effect of increasingly efficient algorithms and 
larger training sets and deployment contexts will cause total energy use to increase or decrease 
over time remains to be seen. 
  
Similarly, societal changes regarding the footprint of various human societies may also change 
the ratio between AI and human activity.  For example, the per capita impact of a human in the 
US has been mostly falling since it peaked in the 1970s (14), and the per capita impact of a 
human in India has been rising almost continuously since the 1940s (14) (although the impact of 
a resident of India is still only one seventh the impact of a US resident). These trends may 
continue, or may be altered by social and/or technical changes.  Either way, they are highly 
likely to affect the human side of the AI/human ratio of the environmental costs related to the 
activities addressed in this article. 
  

Previous studies have compared AI to other technological systems. Such comparisons obscure 
the role that AI is positioned to take in society, as AI transitions from digital tools of limited 
utility to more complex instruments with high generative capacity. AI is poised to take over roles 
once thought to be solely the domain of humans---those requiring creativity and the ability to 
integrate across multiple intellectual domains to synthesize concepts from each. This study 
provides new insights on the relative environmental footprint of AI and humans, and it highlights 
the importance of considering the impact of AI relative to a human when evaluating its overall 
impact on the environment. 
  
While the environmental footprint of AI may be lower than that of humans for certain tasks, 
there are other important factors that may influence AI's overall impact on the world. For 
example, as AI technology becomes more advanced, it is likely that such technologies will 
displace human workers in certain industries. And, if the past is any indicator, professional 
displacement may lead to job losses and reduced income. The displacement of jobs by 
technology has been amply studied, e.g., (21), as has displacement by AI in particular (22). Job 
displacement is deeply problematic not only to those displaced, but to society at large, as it can 
disrupt the economic and social stability of entire geographic regions. 
  
On the other hand, the development of AI has the potential to create jobs as well.  These jobs 
could be meaningful and well-compensated replacements for those AI displaces, or they could be 
demeaning and/or involve low pay. For example, OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT, outsourced 
work to a Kenyan company where workers were employed to label specific instances of toxic 
online content, including content many would likely find disturbing or distasteful, described as 

“text [that] appeared to have been pulled from the darkest recesses of the internet” (23). 
Analogous displacements of workers took place during the Industrial Revolution and with the 
various technological revolutions accompanying the rise of digital technologies. While these 
displacements necessarily cause changes in the job industry, historically such technological shifts 
have given rise to new forms of employment to replace those lost. 
  
There are also legal issues that are pertinent to the use of preexisting text, images, or sounds as 
training sets for AI. The legality of using preexisting material is particularly salient when 
training sets include copyrighted material, because use of such material may infringe.  Perhaps 
“fair learning” will one day be recognized as a type of fair use that involves the transformation of 
copyrighted materials for educational purposes.  However, at present, it remains unpredictable 
how courts will decide such a dispute. There is a class action lawsuit against the AI company 
Midjourney currently pending on this topic (24) that may provide precedent in this legal domain.  
Were Midjourney to be held liable for impropriety in using copyright works owned by others, the 
generous statutory damages scheme available to the plaintiffs could be ruinous for that particular 
company, while, more generally, chilling or inhibiting innovation in AI.  On the other hand, if AI 
use of copyrighted material as training sets is held to be permissible, this will likely have the 
effect, within the current patent system, of spurring advances in AI.  Another outcome could be 
the rise of companies acquiring vast sets of training data.  While these legal issues are not 
necessarily intractable, they nevertheless represent an important point of contention over the 
future of such AI systems. 
  

Additionally, as AI technology becomes more efficient, it is possible that such efficiency will 
lead to an increase in the demand for AI-produced goods and services, which could lead to 
further increases in resource use and pollution via rebound effects (25). The broadening of use 
cases for AI, and the proliferation of ways that AI could impact each use case (e.g., ubiquitous 
personalization of content) could lead to potentially far greater demand for energy than occurs at 
present.  As such, while the impact of AI is currently far less than humans in the tasks described 
above, it is important to maintain vigilance in this domain to avoid runaway resource use.  At the 
same time, it is possible that advances in the efficiency and specificity of AI could further 
decrease its environmental impact compared to human impacts from equivalent activities.  Such 
an increasing environmental advantage could argue in favor of accelerating applications of AI.  
In either scenario, vigilance and adaptation are vital.  And, whether the footprint of AI goes up or 
down, we support the call for disclosure of energy consumption to whatever degree possible 
across AI use cases (26).  
  
Despite these current and potential future forms of societal transformation and harm, profound 
benefits to society could accrue through the use of AI.  Such systems could enable the 
development of new approaches to sustainable futures (26); they could lead to benefits in 
medicine (27); and they could improve human educational systems (28). We argue that these and 
other benefits of AI offset the potential harms such systems may entail.  And most relevant to the 
findings of this paper, AI can potentially do so with substantially lower carbon emissions.  
 
We argue that the most beneficial and efficient use of both AI and human labor is via 
collaboration between the two types of entity, taking advantage of their respective strengths.  For 

example, in this article, we began with a draft written by an AI to bootstrap the effort, but the 
authors have edited it so thoroughly that the AI text is unrecognizable. (We acknowledge this use 
of AI for two reasons; first, it is required by the Nature submission guidelines and second, and 
perhaps more importantly, starting with AI was a more energy efficient way to achieve a high 
quality final product.)  Similarly, a human illustrator may choose to work with an AI in the early 
stages of an interaction with a client, to give them a sense of the broad range of possibilities 
available to them, and then complete a human-created illustration for the client only at the last 
stage.  Such a hybrid approach could allow for more rapid and more efficient coalescing of 
understanding between the client and the human illustrator, while also producing a final product 
that has the excellence and polish of a human-produced piece of work. (For example, unlike 
many AI-produced images, the human hands won’t be uncannily misrepresented (29).) 
Hopefully such collaborative processes may address a range of concerns about AI-generated 
content (30).  
 
In sum, due to its substantially lower impact than humans at at least two important tasks, AI can 
play an important role in various sectors of society without, at present, running afoul of 
problematic carbon emissions.  While the carbon footprint of AI is nontrivial, the footprint of 
humans doing the same work is far greater, and should not be discounted in the assessment of 
AI.  
Methods 
We conducted numerical analyses based on previously published data for various aspects of the 
environmental impacts of both modern AI systems, humans in various locations around the 

world, and other components that may be involved in the production of text and images. These 
data sources were obtained from existing studies and databases on the environmental impact of 
AI and human activities. All figures and calculations are available below, or online here:
