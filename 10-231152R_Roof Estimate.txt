The Seller is a building component supplier and as such may supply ''a portion of'' or ''all of'' the required engineered 
components for a structure. These components are designed as per National Building Code and/or sealed structural 
drawings by others. In the event the Seller supplies ''a portion of'' or ''all of'' the required engineered components, the Seller 
does not design or analyze the entire structure as one system. The Seller also does not guarantee the performance of all 
engineered components when used as a structural system; this can only be performed by a Licensed Professional 
Engineer. It is the Buyer's responsibility to consult a Licensed Professional Engineer if a structural analysis of the building is 
required.
In no event shall the Seller be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages (including but 
not limited to, downtime, loss of use, lost revenue, goodwill or profit) of any kind whatsoever, regardless of cause or the 
foresee ability thereof. Notwithstanding anything contained in the contract to the contrary, the Seller's maximum liability 
(including, without limitation, liability for claims based in contract or in tort, including negligence), shall not exceed the 
contract value.
