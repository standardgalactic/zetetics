Nonlinear dependence of the renormalization scale on test functions
Peter Morgan
Received: date / Accepted: date
Abstract Quantum electrodynamics exhibits an informal nonlinear dependence on Lorentz invari-
ant test function properties that determine the renormalization scale, such as Mandelstam variables,
contrary to the linear dependence on test functions that is required by the Wightman axioms. A
ﬁrst example of an alternative interacting quantum ﬁeld formalism that has a comparable weakly
nonlinear dependence on Dirac spinor test functions is constructed, using U(1)–gauge connections
and U(1)–gauge invariant Dirac spinor test functions.

1 Introduction
Gauge invariance and covariance are signiﬁcant guides in the construction of quantum ﬁeld theories
(QFTs) in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formalisms. Here, instead of introducing nonlinear modiﬁca-
tions of the free quantum ﬁeld Lagrangian or Hamiltonian dynamics and the accompanying renor-
malization, the Lorentz invariant U(1)–gauge invariance that is required for observables of quantum
electrodynamics is ensured by introducing a nonlinear construction of U(1)–gauge connections and
U(1)–invariant Dirac spinor test functions in Section 3, which may be used as part of a U(1)–gauge
invariant formalism to construct a wide range of interacting models. We thereby avoid the intro-
duction of products of distributions and, because only direct space–time relationships between test
functions contribute to Vacuum Expectation Values (VEVs), we avoid divergent integrations over in-
termediate loop momenta. As a consequence of this formalism, observables become weakly nonlinear
functionals of the test functions that are used to model the various wave packets and measurement
windows that are used in an experimental apparatus, so that the quantum ﬁelds will no longer be
operator–valued distributions.
Section 2 compares the weakly nonlinear dependence on test functions that is introduced here
with the nonlinear dependence on experimental scales that is introduced by the Lorentz invariant
choice of a renormalization scale in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms to interacting QFT.
It is pointed out that the renormalization scale is a Lorentz invariant function of properties of the
set of wave packets that are prepared and measured in an experiment, informally dependent on
wave–number properties such as the Mandelstam variables, so that Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
formalisms implicitly use nonlinear functionals of test functions. The nonlinear dependence is rela-
tively weak, however, insofar as the renormalization scale is independent of the amplitudes of the
test functions, so that homogeneity (of degree 1) is preserved.
The reconciliation of the mathematically coherent Wightman axioms with the empirically suc-
cessful Lagrangian and related formalisms to interacting QFT is a longstanding problem [1,2]. In
an attempt to make the Wightman axioms more applicable, we will here relax the postulate that

a Wightman ﬁeld ˆφ(x) is an operator–valued distribution, whereby the operators of the theory are
obtained by linear “smearing”, for a well–behaved linear space S of “test” functions,
ˆφ : S →A; f 7→ˆφf =
Z
ˆφ(x)f(x)d4x,
(1)
which has hitherto been little addressed in the literature. Our point of departure will be to take a
map ˆξ : f 7→ˆξf, from a suitably well–behaved space of test functions into a ∗-algebra of operators, to
be a weakly nonlinear functional of the test functions, so that in general ˆξf+g ̸= ˆξf + ˆξg, essentially
denying the linearity that is implied by Eq. (1), however we will continue to require homogeneity of
degree 1 over the reals, ˆξλf = λˆξf. Nonetheless, the action of the ∗-algebra of operators on Hilbert
space vectors is taken to be linear, (ˆξf +ˆξg) |ψ⟩= ˆξf |ψ⟩+ˆξg |ψ⟩and (λˆξf) |ψ⟩= λ(ˆξf |ψ⟩), and we will
retain the usual Born rule construction of expected values, of probabilities, and of correlations that
is common to all quantum theory —and their use to model the statistics of multiple experimental
datasets— and the converse Gelfand–Naimark–Segal (GNS)–construction of a Hilbert space from
the expected values that are generated by a state over a ∗-algebra of operators [3, §III.2]. This
“Born–GNS” linearity is eﬀective, as in Lagrangian QFT, as quantum theory’s way of generating
probabilities that satisfy the Kolmogorov axioms of probability, however the linearity we relinquish
has no comparable necessity.
2 Nonlinearity and renormalization
We ﬁrst note that real–space renormalization quite strongly motivates some kind of nonlinear struc-
ture. As a loose description of the general process, we have from Wilson and Kogut,
“The [ﬁrst] basic idea [of the renormalization group] is the same as in hydrodynamics. In
hydrodynamics one introduces new variables such as the density ρ(x) which represents an
average over the original microscopic degrees of freedom.” [4, p. 79]
The processes that are used to construct higher–level block variables, however, such as majority
rule and decimation, are not in general expressible as linearly constructed weighted averages of
lower–level block variables. A full description of the process of real–space renormalization might be
a list of nonlinear renormalization functionals, in which successive levels are constructed from the
level below, so that with explicit indexing we might write ρ[F1,F2,...](x) instead of ρ(x) (although
networks of renormalizations are also possible), but a minimal systematic formalism is to use a
mass scale µ to generate a list of nonlinear renormalization functionals that allows us to construct
sequences ρµ1(x), ρµ2(x), .... We may, for example, introduce a single nonlinear functional F to
construct F : ρµi 7→ρµi+1, with µi+1 < µi because renormalization acts as a semi–group that only
transforms towards coarser descriptions at lower mass scales, or, as a continuous construction, we
may introduce a parameterized renormalization functional such as Fλ : ρµ 7→ρλµ, λ < 1. For such
a construction, µ parameterizes the nonlinear renormalization process, so that the phenomenology
associated with a given ρµ(x) depends nonlinearly on µ. A more recent account makes explicit the
dependence of the dynamics on scale, found everywhere in the literature and in textbooks,
“the natural description of physics generally changes with the scale at which observations
are made. Crudely speaking, this is no more high–minded a statement than saying that the
world around us looks rather diﬀerent when viewed through a microscope. More precisely,
our parametrization of some system in terms of both the degrees of freedom and an action
specifying how they interact generally change with scale.” [5, p. 178]
Both for real–space renormalization and for Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, the renormal-
ization scale determines the dynamical constants of an eﬀective (quantum) ﬁeld theory, both the
eﬀective masses of the ﬁelds and the strengths of the interactions between them.
Less minimally than a one–dimensional scale µ, we can adapt the use of a test function w(x) in
quantum ﬁeld theory in a linear convolution with an operator–valued distribution ˆφ(x) to obtain a
linear space of quantum ﬁeld operators ˆφw(x) = [ˆφ ⋆w](x) =
R ˆφ(y)w(x −y)d4y, by interpreting

Nonlinear dependence of the renormalization scale on test functions

the test function w(x) as an inﬁnite–dimensional description of the many scales at which a given
measurement or preparation operates, with varying amplitudes at diﬀerent wave–numbers. If it is
taken that the test function is a parameterization of a nonlinear renormalization process rather than
of a linear smearing, it is natural to suppose that the phenomenology associated with a given ρw(x)
will in general depend Lorentz covariantly and nonlinearly on w(x), although our experience clearly
suggests that the nonlinearity is relatively weak.
Renormalization in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms ordinarily makes no formal connec-
tion between the renormalization scale that is used in calculations for a given interacting quantum
ﬁeld theory and the scales that are implicitly introduced by the test functions that model particu-
lar measurements and preparations, but there is a clear pragmatic connection, in that the highest
rest–mass that is used in each test function and Lorentz invariant experimental parameters such as
Mandelstam variables that are determined by the relationships between several test functions all
contribute to the determination of the renormalization scale to be used. Indeed, because the vari-
ous masses associated with the dynamics are all determined by the renormalization scale, Lorentz
invariant properties of the test functions that describe the various wave packets and of the relation-
ships between the test functions are the only available guides for the renormalization scale, unless
we take the renormalization scale to be entirely independent of the test functions that describe the
experimental apparatus in detail.
Although there is a Lorentz invariant dependence of the renormalization scale on the wave–
numbers that are used in test functions, the renormalization scale is generally independent of the
amplitudes of the test functions. At least in the ﬁrst instance, therefore, it seems a worthwhile
mathematical simpliﬁcation to require models to be homogeneous of degree 1 over the reals in the
test functions.
An advantage of introducing a weak nonlinear functional dependence on detailed Lorentz invari-
ant properties of all test functions, as in Section 3, is that it allows widely varying measurement scales
of the diﬀerent measurement and preparation apparatuses that are part of a collection of experi-
ments to be accommodated naturally, where a single renormalization scale would only inadequately
reﬂect the complexity of the experiments. Insofar as more sophisticated experiments introduce de-
pendencies on multiple length–scales, it may become necessary for more sophisticated models of the
nonlinear dependence on experimental contexts to be used than the current dependence on a single
renormalization scale, and, conversely, this theoretical focus requires an experimental focus on the
eﬀects of introducing or discovering dependencies on multiple length–scales.
3 U(1)–gauge transformations for Dirac spinor test functions
If the Dirac spinor operator–valued distribution ˆψ(x) gauge transforms as ˆψ(x) 7→eiθ(x) ˆψ(x), with
θ(x) ∈R, a natural choice is to take a corresponding Dirac spinor test function U(x) to gauge
transform contravariantly as U(x) 7→e−iθ(x)U(x), so that the scalar operator
ˆψU =
Z
U c(x) ˆψ(x)d4x 7→
Z
U c(x) ˆψ(x)d4x
is U(1)–gauge invariant (where the charge conjugate U c(x) of U(x) is used to ensure that ˆψU follows
the convention that it should be complex–linear in U; Appendix A discusses the relation of this to
the conventional notation).

however, are not invariant under the U(1)–gauge transformation of U(x) and V (x). To modify these
expressions to be U(1)–gauge invariant, we introduce, as a ﬁrst and most natural example, a Lorentz

which U(1)–gauge transforms, when U(x) 7→e−iθ(x)U(x), as
uα[U](x) 7→uα[U](x) + ∂αθ(x);
a class of such connections is constructed in Appendix B. Using this U(1)–gauge connection, we may
apply a standard method for constructing a U(1)–gauge invariant object,

where we require that θ(x) diminishes suﬃciently fast at inﬁnity and that the 4–vector distribution
Ξµ(x) satisﬁes ∂µΞµ(x) = δ4(x) in a way that ensures Lorentz and translation invariance of the
construction of Uu. One example that ensures this is for Ξµ(x) to be the gradient of a zero–mass
Green’s function in 3+1–dimensions, such as Ξµ(x) = ∂µGret(x). For this case, it is suﬃcient for
Uu(x) = U(x) if uµ[U](x) is divergence–free, ∂µuµ[U](x) = 0, and uµ[U](x) decreases suﬃciently
rapidly at inﬁnity; we ﬁnd that the test function Uu(x) satisﬁes this condition, because

= 0,
and, consequently, (Uu)u(x) = Uu(x) is for this case idempotent. For this case, we may regard the
operation U 7→Uu as a way to construct a test function for which the chosen connection uα[Uu] is
divergence–free; how the operation achieves the divergence–free property is ﬁxed by the choice of
Ξµ. Other examples are constructed in Appendix C, for some of which Ξµ(x) has components that
are divergences of Dirac algebra–valued bivector ﬁelds as well as components that are gradients of
scalar ﬁelds.
Requiring that the positive semi–deﬁnite inner products (Uu, Uu) and (Uu, Uu)+ exist is taken
to be a nontrivial deﬁning constraint on the Dirac spinor test function space. For example, for the
ansatz U(x) = E(x)e−ik·xΦ(x)U0, where E(x) is a real–valued positive–deﬁnite envelope, Φ(x) is a
real–valued long–range regularization, and U0 is a constant Dirac spinor, uα[U](x) = ∂α[k·xΦ(x)],
independent of both E(x) and U0; it is enough for (Uu, Uu) and (Uu, Uu)+ to exist for this case if E(x)
and Φ(x) are smooth and decrease rapidly for large x, whereas for the quantized free Dirac spinor
ﬁeld Φ(x) may be constant. For this simplest case, Uu(x) = E(x)U0 is independent of k and of Φ(x),
with only the constant relative phases of the components of the constant spinor U0 surviving. For
less straightforward cases, however, u[U](x) will in general not be a derivative of a scalar, so that the
curvature bivector duµα[U] = ∂[µuα][U] will in general not be trivial and Uu(x) will have surviving
nontrivial variations of relative phases of its components. For example, for constant Dirac spinors
u(1) and u(2), representing spin–up and spin–down in some frame, for which u(1)u(1) = u(2)u(2) = 1,
u(1)u(2) = 0 = u(1)iγ5u(1) = u(1)iγ5u(2) = u(2)iγ5u(2), for the Dirac spinor test function
U(x) = E1(x)e−ik1·xΦ1(x)u(1) + E2(x)e−ik2·xΦ2(x)u(2),

If over some large region we take Φ1(x) ≈1 and Φ2(x) ≈1 to be constant, E1(x) ≈cos(k3·x + θ),

uα[U] ≈cos2(k3·x + θ)k1α + sin2(k3·x + θ)k2α,
duµα[U] ≈sin(2k3·x + 2θ)k3[µ(k2 −k1)α],
so that for this ansatz the U(1)–gauge connection, with this gauge–ﬁxing, oscillates between the
spin–up wave–number k1 and the spin–down wave–number k2, following the doubled spin–up/spin–
down wave–number k3 that is associated with E1 and E2. The U(1)–gauge curvature follows the same
doubled spin–up/spin–down wave–number k3, with amplitude determined by the bivector generated
by the spin–up/spin–down wave–number and the U(1)–gauge invariant diﬀerence between the spin–
up wave–number and the spin–down wave–number. It is enough for Uu to exist for this ansatz if
E1(x) and E2(x) are smooth and Φ1(x) and Φ2(x) are smooth and decrease rapidly at long range;
it is enough for (Uu, Uu) and (Uu, Uu)+ to exist if E1(x) and E2(x) also decrease rapidly at long
range. We note that although the construction of Uu is mathematically straightforward it is not
straightforward to write down Uu even for these elementary ans¨atze.
We also require that the U(1)–gauge invariant positive semi–deﬁnite inner product (du[U], du[U])0
exists, where (·, ·)0 is the two–point VEV of the quantized free Maxwell bivector ﬁeld,

As well as taking Uu to be a test function for the quantized Dirac spinor ﬁeld, du[U] will also be taken
to be a test function for the quantized Maxwell bivector ﬁeld, which, taken with other test functions,
describe how a state preparation modulates the vacuum state or how a measurement responds to
a given prepared state; ˆψ(x) and ˆF(x) unmediated by experimentally descriptive explicit choices
of test functions are taken not to be accessible to experiment. In the ﬁgurative language of signal
analysis, a test function is referred to as a “window function”, as if when making a measurement
we must say what kind of distorting window we are looking through; as for all test functions, the
bivector du[U], for example, is not the Maxwell bivector ﬁeld, it is the window that mediates when
we prepare or examine the Maxwell bivector ﬁeld using ˆFdu[U]. In terms of diﬀerential forms, in the
absence of boundary terms, we could instead write ˆFdu[U] as ˆAδdu[U], because ˆF = d ˆA, or, because
δ ˆF = ˆJ,
ˆJu[U] = δ ˆFu[U] = ˆFdu[U] = d ˆAdu[U] = ˆAδdu[U],
so that u[U] is a 4–current test function (or, in fact, a 4–current test connection), and a given choice
for u[U] determines a constitutive relation for a given type of quantized Dirac spinor ﬁeld, insofar
as a given Dirac spinor test function U determines a 4–current test connection u[U], and hence
also a Maxwell bivector test function du[u]. To emphasize again the vagaries of the duality between
quantum ﬁelds as operator–valued distributions and test functions, δdu[U] is a test function, not a
test connection, for the electromagnetic ﬁeld connection ˆA, and ˆAδdu[U] = ˆFdu[U] is gauge invariant.
As well as the alternative terminology “window function” for “test function”, a test function that is
used to construct a time–ordered VEV generating functional is said to be a “source ﬁeld”.

Using the above, we can now construct U(1)–gauge invariant anti–commutation relations and
two–point VEVs for a quantized Dirac spinor ﬁeld as an elementary nonlinear deformation of the
quantized free Dirac spinor ﬁeld that preserves homogeneity,
ˆξU = ˆψUu,
{ˆξU, ˆξ †
V} = (Vu , Uu),
⟨0| ˆξ †
V ˆξU|0⟩= (Vu , Uu)+.
Also naturally, as a phase shift that depends on what other Dirac spinor test functions we use
to modulate the vacuum or as simultaneous measurements, we may construct ﬁeld operators that
introduce a directly electromagnetic eﬀect, for example,
ˆΨU = eiλˆFdu[U] ˆξU,
so that a state preparation that uses this operator results in a measurable Maxwell ﬁeld as well as
a measurable Dirac spinor ﬁeld. The use of the Dirac spinor test function U in two nonlinear forms,
as the U(1)–gauge invariant Dirac spinor test function Uu and as the U(1)–gauge invariant Maxwell
test function du[U], introduces a nontrivial relationship between the quantized Dirac and Maxwell
ﬁelds. With this construction, the VEVs are U(1)–gauge invariant, but the operators ˆΨU and ˆΨ †
U
that are used to generate the VEVS are not.
The constructions given for ˆΨU ensure homogeneity of degree 1 over the reals, ˆΨλU = λ ˆΨU,
because u[λU] = u[U], where linearity in general is not satisﬁed, ˆΨU+V ̸= ˆΨU + ˆΨV . [More gener-
ally, u[U] is invariant under multiplication by a real–valued positive–deﬁnite scalar function E(x),
u[EU] = u[U].] There is, unfortunately, no obvious empirically principled constraint that would
require that the mathematically natural exponential eiλˆFdu[U] should not be replaced by an arbi-
trary polynomial or special function in ˆFdu[U], although tractability and the naturalness of a phase
shift in this context are perhaps good mathematical reasons. With the introduction of a collection
of diﬀerent connections un[U], we might also construct signiﬁcantly less tractable operators, such
as P
n λn(ˆFdun[U])n ˆψUun, which we might further complicate by the introduction of diﬀerent mass
ﬁelds for diﬀerent connections, ˆψ(n)
Uun, or, even more diﬃcult, we may also introduce functions of
such homogeneous expressions as ˆψUu ˆψ †
Uu/(Uu, Uu)+, etc., provided the resulting VEVs are Lorentz
and U(1)–gauge invariant. All such expressions construct a complex of Dirac spinor and Maxwell
bivector ﬁelds for a given Dirac spinor test function, which may be tuned in very many ways to
attempt to achieve a degree of empirical usefulness. It is troubling that the huge wealth of high
energy experimental data has been ﬁtted so thoroughly into the conceptual space of interacting
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms that it is relatively diﬃcult to apply that data as restric-
tive principles in the conceptual space of the nonlinear test function formalism that is introduced
here, beyond the application of Lorentz and U(1)–gauge invariance and covariance and the possibly
tenuous requirement that homogeneity is preserved.
The choice of u[U] determines a submanifold of the space of Dirac spinor test functions because
of the invariance of U 7→Uu under the action of the U(1) gauge transformation U(x) 7→e−iθ(x)U(x).
A geometric way to characterize the submanifold is ﬁrst to observe that for a given Dirac spinor
U the 4–vectors Jµ[U] = UγµU, Zµ[U] = Uγ5γµU, and the real and imaginary parts Xµ[U] and
Y µ[U] of UγµU c constitute an orthogonal tetrad that is orthonormal up to a constant multiple,
Jµ[U]Jµ[U] = −Zµ[U]Zµ[U] = −Xµ[U]Xµ[U] = −Y µ[U]Yµ[U]
= [UU]2 + [Uiγ5U]2.
For a test function U(x), Jµ[Uu(x)] = Jµ[U(x)], Zµ[Uu(x)] = Zµ[U(x)], σ[Uu(x)] = Uu(x)Uu(x) =
U(x)U(x), and ω[Uu(x)] = Uu(x)iγ5Uu(x) = U(x)iγ5U(x) are invariant under U(1)–gauge transfor-
mations, however the U(1)–gauge invariant directions of the real and imaginary parts of Uu(x)γµU c
u(x)
are in a ﬁxed relation to spatial derivatives of U(x) in the backward light–cone of x (given the choice
of Ξµ = ∂µGret and of uµ[U]), independently of the non–U(1)–gauge invariant directions of the real
and imaginary parts of U(x)γµU c(x). Because of Fierz identities, the expression for u[U] given above
can be rewritten,
uα[U](x) = i

3.1 4–momentum of prepared states, interactions, and locality
The underlying free quantum ﬁeld structure has not been modiﬁed, so that the 4–momentum oper-
ator has the same expression in terms of the free ﬁeld creation and annihilation operators as it has
for the free quantum ﬁelds ˆF and ˆψ and the expected 4–momentum for a given state will still be in
the forward light–cone. The 4–momentum associated with a given set of test functions is diﬀerent,
however, because of the nonlinearity of the quantum ﬁeld operators as functionals of the test func-
tions, so that the 4–momentum becomes a nontrivial function of the wave–number components of
the test functions.
The nonlinear modiﬁcation we have introduced results in the possibility of interactions because
of the modiﬁcation U 7→Uu, as well as there being a modiﬁcation of the VEVs because of the
introduction of the Maxwell bivector ﬁeld. For an example four–point VEV for the quantized free
Dirac spinor ﬁeld, smeared by test functions, we obtain

We note that the 1–point factors exp[−1
2λ2(du[U1], du[U1])0], etc., are generally insigniﬁcant, not
only in this particular transition probability but also when we construct superpositions, insofar as
we may modify U1 etc. by a constant factor U1 7→exp[ 1
2λ2(du[U1], du[U1])0] U1, which eliminates
the 1–point factors because du[U1] is invariant under multiplication by a real constant. Such a
modiﬁcation may be automated by deﬁning ˆΨ

the eﬀect of normal–ordering. We also note that this transition probability and the next may be
tuned substantially by replacing the exponential eiλˆFdu[U] by an arbitrary function of ˆFdu[U], by
using the constructions in subsection 3.3, or by using the alternative U(1)–gauge connections and
propagators in Appendices B and C.
From a foundational point of view, we might assert that all observables should be constructed
using only ˆΨ, insofar as all Maxwell bivector ﬁeld phenomena are caused by the presence of nontrivial
Dirac spinor ﬁelds, however we can use the quantized free Maxwell bivector ﬁeld ˆF(x) at least for
practical purposes, with linear smearing by a bivector test function f(x), say, to obtain the operator
ˆFf , in which case we can construct nontrivial three–point VEVs such as

with it being worthwhile to recall that (V c

netically trivial when U(x) and V (x) have a single component, in which case du[U] and du[V ] are
trivial, so that when constructing models in this nonlinear test function formalism we will in general
expect to use multi–component Dirac spinor test functions for which du[·] is non–trivial.
The multi–component variation of an electromagnetically nontrivial Dirac spinor test function for
the nonlinear case is analogous to the lesser detail of the polarizations and spins of S–matrix in and
out states, and equally may not be known, making it necessary to extend summations over polariza-
tion and spin components to include averaging over components of the multi–component variation.
For example, for a free electron ﬁeld in quantum electrodynamics we would expect to specify a wave–
number kµ and a spinor u(1)(f) (representing a polarization frame f, which is constrained by the free
ﬁeld Dirac equation to be aligned with kµ), resulting in a test function e−ik·xu(1)(f); interacting quan-
tum electrodynamics also requires an infra–red regularization that is determined by the spectrum of
the detector sensitivities. In contrast, for the minimal nontrivial fermion ﬁeld example Eq. (2), which
also speciﬁes the surrounding electromagnetic ﬁeld, we would specify a wave–number kµ, two con-
stant spinors, u(1)(f) and u(2)(f) (representing up and down spinors in a polarization frame), and a
polarization wave–number ℓµ, resulting in a base test function cos(ℓ·x)e−ik·xu(1)(f)+sin(ℓ·x)u(1)(f);
as for interacting quantum electrodynamics, there must be suitable long–range regularization. It will
be of interest if there is any systematic choice of test functions that gives eﬀective models of this
class for given experimental preparations and measurements, and for a given theory of U(1)–gauge
connections and propagators, however it will only be useful if there are enough beneﬁts to justify
the increased complexity.
The quantized Maxwell bivector ﬁeld ˆF is a free ﬁeld, used essentially for practical purposes,
so that although there are ˆF– ˆΨ †– ˆΨ interactions, there are no photon–photon interactions; as it is
presented here, a model that is constructed using only ˆΨ, using a macroscopic number of Dirac spinors
as sources of the quantized Maxwell bivector ﬁeld, would be taken to be more fundamental. There
is apparently no way to deform ˆFf to include Dirac spinor components that preserves homogeneity
and that is as immediately natural as the way in which we have deformed ˆψUu to construct ˆΨUu.
Locality is preserved by the construction given here insofar as the free quantum ﬁeld structure
underlies the nonlinear construction, however for the connection u[U] that is constructed using a
Dirac spinor test function U to exist, U(x) must be non–zero —even if arbitrarily small— everywhere.

Nonlinear dependence of the renormalization scale on test functions

Local observables are nonetheless possible as limits in appropriate operator norms after the GNS–
construction of a vacuum sector or other Hilbert space, by taking sequences of observables in which
the everywhere non–zero test functions used to construct each instance in the sequence approach
arbitrarily close to zero outside a given region of space–time.
3.2 A diagrammatic presentation
The algebraic presentation we have used is enough more straightforward than Feynman integrals,
particularly because there is no need to manage the combinatoric structure of renormalization, that
a diagrammatic presentation is relatively superﬂuous, however it is helpful to see what can be done.

by-point operation that is relatively inappropriate for test functions U and V that are nowhere zero,
even if arbitrarily small almost everywhere. Although the diagrams are presented as simply being
added, powers of i are implied by the diagram rules.

degree 0 over the reals, so they may be used in many ways to construct deformations of Uu that
preserve U(1)–gauge invariance and homogeneity.
For a given Dirac spinor test function, we can also construct a continuum of connections u[U],
as is shown in Appendix B. Given any two such connections, u1[U] and u2[U], say, the diﬀerence
u1[U] −u2[U] is a U(1)–gauge invariant vector ﬁeld that is homogeneous of degree 0 over the reals,
so we may use it anywhere we might use δdu[U].
We also note the constructions of more general U(1)–gauge propagators in Appendix C.
Even more than for the introduction of eiλˆFdu[U], however, there is a lack of decent empirical or
theoretical constraint, so we will not further pursue these and other constructions here.
3.4 A U(1)×U(1)–gauge connection
It is possible also to construct a Dirac spinor test function that is invariant under the Lorentz
invariant U(1)×U(1)–gauge transformation
U(x) 7→e−i(θ1(x)+γ5θ2(x))U(x),
for which UγµU and Uγ5γµU are invariant; UγµU c is invariant under the θ2(x) component only; UU,
Uiγ5U, and Uγ[µγν]U are invariant under the θ1(x) component only. We introduce two connections,

for which, under the U(1)×U(1)–gauge transformation given above,

This construction is somewhat more constrained than the construction of U(1)–gauge connections,
but here again we may replace Ξµ

that if Ξµ
±(x) are Dirac algebra–valued, they must be even–graded, [Ξµ

4 Discussion
Allowing nonlinearity as proposed here allows considerable arbitrariness, which has been somewhat
controlled by everywhere insisting upon Lorentz invariance, U(1)–gauge invariance, and homogene-
ity. The connection with existing theory and experiment needs improvement, but the more elaborate
structures of the electroweak model and of quantum chromodynamics do not easily provide empiri-
cally principled constraints.
The constructive proposal in Section 3 can be seen as radical —even though the adherence to
Lorentz and translation invariance and to non–supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theory on Minkowski
space–time is intended to be conservative— and may contain missteps, however the analysis in
Section 2 of the determination of the renormalization scale appropriate for a model of a given exper-
iment suggests an approximate general form for any weakly nonlinear test function formalism: there
should be a dependence on wave–numbers that are relevant to the experiment, but no dependence
on amplitude. The amplitude invariant U(1)–gauge invariance of Section 3 is a more–or–less plau-
sible response to the analysis in Section 2, given the general empirical success of gauge invariance,
however this paper is more a preliminary discussion than it is exhaustive and empirically ﬂawless.
Even if the speciﬁc details of the constructions pursued here are not useful, it is nonetheless of
interest that a weakening of linearity that is no stronger than can be motivated by a reasonable
reconsideration of renormalization creates a possibility of modeling some kinds of interactions in a
well–deﬁned almost–Wightman ﬁeld theory.
It is partly encouraging that very many models exist in a nonlinear test function formalism,
whereas the existence of renormalized interacting Lagrangian and Hamiltonian models is relatively
delicate, however a nonlinear test function formalism may be understood to be less explanatory
than Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formalisms precisely because there are so many models as well
as because there is a relatively greater distance from classical dynamics, instead having a closer
relationship to signal analysis. In contrast, we are very familiar with the quantization of Lagrangians
and Hamiltonians and with symmetry, renormalization, and other constraints, we have a great deal
of experience in their eﬀective use, and there is a comfortable if partly illusory closeness to classical
models. Nonetheless it is to be hoped that it will be possible either to construct an alternative,
signal analysis–oriented formalism that is at least marginally empirically useful or to clearly state
why such formalisms cannot be useful as empirical, engineering–oriented models, and that in either
case an understanding of whatever relationships there may be with renormalized Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian formalisms will be useful.

where u(α)(k)e−ik·x and v(α)(k)eik·x are two pairs of orthogonal solutions of the Dirac equation (iγµ∂µ −m)U(x) = 0,
for which, from [6, §2-2-1],
(kµγµ −m)u(α)(k) = 0,
(kµγµ + m)v(α)(k) = 0,
u(α)(k)u(β)(k) = δαβ,
v(α)(k)v(β)(k) = −δαβ,

k0 is the positive square root

The algebraic elements γµ generate the Cliﬀord algebra C(1, 3), satisfying the anti–commutation relations γµγν +
γνγµ = 2gµν with metric diag(1, −1, −1, −1); taken with an imaginary i we obtain the Dirac algebra, which is
isomorphic to the algebra of 4–dimensional matrices over the complex ﬁeld. The Dirac conjugate is a complex anti–
linear anti–automorphism of the Dirac algebra, satisfying γµ = γµ, i = −i, AB = B A, which uniquely determines
a Lorentz invariant Dirac conjugate of a Dirac spinor; the charge conjugate is a complex anti–linear automorphism,
satisfying (γµ)c = −γµ, ic = −i, (AB)c = AcBc, which determines a Lorentz invariant charge conjugate of a Dirac
spinor only up to a complex phase; a complex conjugate is deﬁnable for the Dirac algebra, (γµ)∗= γµ, i∗= −i,
(AB)∗= A∗B∗, but this does not determine a Lorentz invariant conjugate of a Dirac spinor.
To obtain a manifestly Lorentz covariant presentation of these anti–commutation relations, we may rescale
the creation and annihilation operators, taking b′
α(k) = 2m 2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0)bα(k) and d′
α(k) = 2m 2πδ(k·k −
m2)θ(k0)dα(k), equivalent to rescaling by m/k0 on the mass-shell, so that

the spinor ﬁeld, so that, manifestly Lorentz covariantly,

Whatever the scaling of the unobservable creation and annihilation operators, we have for ˆψξ(x) the Lorentz covariant
anti–commutation relations [6, Eq. 3-170]

We may put the above structure into an equivalent smeared operator form, smearing the Dirac spinor operator–
valued distribution ˆψξ(x) with a Dirac spinor test function Uξ(x) to obtain a scalar operator that is a linear functional
of U(x),

where ˆbU and ˆdU are complex anti–linear in U. We have to introduce charge conjugation to ensure that ˆψU follows the
convention that it should be complex–linear in U, and correspondingly for ˆdUc. For these scalar smeared operators,
we have the anti–commutation relations

uα[U](x) = i

we obtain a U(1)–gauge connection if Re
h
M1[U] + M2[U]
i
= 1, with uα[U](x) homogeneous of degree zero over
the reals if M1[U] and M2[U] are homogeneous of degree zero over the reals. Constructions that use other Lorentz
invariants, such as U(x)γµU(x)U(x)γµU(x), all reduce to the same form by the application of Fierz identities such as
U(x)γµU(x)U(x)γµU(x) = [U(x)U(x)]2 + [U(x)iγ5U(x)]2,
U(x)γµU(x)U(x)γµ∂αU(x) = U(x)U(x)U(x)∂αU(x) + U(x)iγ5U(x)U(x)iγ5∂αU(x).
Also because of Fierz identities, M1[U] and M2[U] may both be taken to be functionals of U(x)U(x) and U(x)iγ5U(x)U(x).
We also note that the sum of a U(1)–gauge connection and a 4–vector is a U(1)–gauge connection, and that the di-
vergence δduα[U] of the U(1)–gauge curvature duαµ[U] is a 4–vector, so that we may add a weighted multiple of this
and higher derivatives to obtain a new U(1)–gauge connection.
There is no reason why any such constructions must be of use in detailed physical models, but they are available
within the admittedly only partial empirical constraints adopted here of Lorentz invariance, U(1)–gauge invariance,
and homogeneity of degree 1 over the reals.
C Alternative U(1)–gauge propagators
The requirement that ∂µΞµ(x) = δ4(x) may be Lorentz covariantly satisﬁed in a number of ways. The main text
suggests the most obvious, the gradient of a retarded zero–mass Green’s function in 3+1–dimensions, Ξµ(x) =
∂µGret(x). The next obvious alternative is an arbitrary aﬃne combination of ∂µGret(x) and ∂µGadv(x), plus ∂µξ(x),
where ξ(x) is a Lorentz invariant solution of the wave equation, however lower–dimensional propagators may also be
used when the direction of the projection can be speciﬁed by the test function,

U(x).
It is essential that the function Ξ[U(x)]µ is independent of the point x −y for Uu(x) to be U(1)–gauge invariant. For
example, a 4–vector distribution used by Steinmann [7] is Ξ0(x) = Ξ1(x) = Ξ2(x) = 0, Ξ3(x) = δ(x0)δ(x1)δ(x2)θ(x3),
which may be given in manifestly Lorentz covariant form as a function of a Dirac spinor Z that is non–zero only along
a space–like half–line,

× δ(ℜ[ZcγαZ]xα)δ(ℑ[ZcγαZ]xα).
Alternatively, in a slightly generalized form that is non–zero both along a space–like half–line and along a time–like
half–line in proportions speciﬁed by the scalar–pseudo–scalar phase of Z, we may use
Ξ′[Z]µ(x) = (ZZ)2ZγµZθ(ZγαZxα)δ(Zγ5γαZxα)δ(ℜ[ZcγαZ]xα)δ(ℑ[ZcγαZ]xα)

To show that δΞ[Z](x) = δΞ′[Z](x) = δ4(x) we use the equal–length Lorentzian orthogonality of the tetrad ZγµZ,
Zγ5γµZ, ℜ[ZcγµZ], and ℑ[ZcγµZ], and the identity (ZZ)2 + (Ziγ5Z)2 = ZγαZZγαZ. For constructions that have
a dependence on the point x as well as on the separation x −y, the connection uα[Uu](x) in general will not be
divergence–free.
As another example, we may use a 4-vector distribution that in elementary coordinates is Ξ0(x) = 0, Ξi(x) =

We may use Ξ[U(x)]µ(x −y), Ξ′[U(x)]µ(x −y), Ξ′′[U(x)γU(x)]µ(x −y), or a convex sum of these and similar
constructions in the construction of Uu. We note that all the above constructions are invariant under multiplication by
a real–valued positive–deﬁnite scalar function E(x), U(x) 7→E(x)U(x), as well as under U(1)–gauge transformations.
Finally, Ξµ(x) may be Dirac algebra–valued (noting, however, that ∂µΞµ(x) = δ4(x) is a scalar), in which case
we may use, for example,
Ξµ(x) = Ξµ
(0)(x) + ∂ν
h
γ[µ∂ν]φ(1)(x) + iγ[µγν]φ(2)(x) + γ5γ[µ∂ν]φ(3)(x)
i
+ iγ5∂µξ(4)(x).
where φ(1)(x), φ(2)(x), and φ(3)(x) are arbitrary Lorentz invariant distributions, possibly including massive components,
Ξµ
(0)(x) is a scalar U(1)–gauge connection, and ξ(4)(x) is a Lorentz invariant solution of the wave equation. With this
construction, the connection uα[Uu](x) in general will not be divergence–free; at the cost of still less tractability, we
may also introduce Dirac algebra–valued U(1)–gauge connections of the form Ξ[U(x)]µ(x −y).
There is no reason why any such constructions must be of use in detailed physical models, but they are available
within the admittedly only partial empirical constraints adopted here of Lorentz invariance, U(1)–gauge invariance,
and homogeneity of degree 1 over the reals.
