Abstract 
The diversity of cognitive deficits and neuropathological processes associated with dementias has encouraged 
divergence in pathophysiological explanations of disease. Here, we review an alternative framework that 
emphasises convergent critical features of pathophysiology, rather than the loss of “memory centres” or 
“language centres”, or singular neurotransmitter systems. Cognitive deficits are interpreted in the light of 
advances in normative accounts of brain function, based on predictive coding in hierarchical neural networks. 
The predicting coding rests on Bayesian integration of beliefs and sensory evidence, with hierarchical 
predictions and prediction errors, for memory, perception, speech and behaviour. We describe how 
analogous impairments in predictive coding in parallel neurocognitive systems can generate diverse clinical 
phenomena, in neurodegenerative dementias. The review presents evidence from behavioural and 
neurophysiological studies of perception, language, memory and decision-making. The re-formulation of 
cognitive deficits in dementia in terms of predictive coding has several advantages. It brings diverse clinical 
phenomena into a common framework, such as linking cognitive and movement disorders; and it makes 
specific predictions on cognitive physiology that support translational and experimental medicine studies. The 
insights into complex human cognitive disorders from the predictive coding model may therefore also inform 
future therapeutic strategies.

Introduction 
Cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative diseases have often been characterised as the loss of core functional 
modules in distinct brain regions, such as “memory centres” or “executive centres”. This approach 
emphasises the functional difference between disorders, at a time when preclinical models suggest 
convergence in the pathophysiology of different diseases. Here we re-evaluate diverse cognitive and 
behavioural features of dementia in terms of advances in predictive coding accounts of brain function (Rao 
and Ballard, 1999; Friston, 2005a; Bar, 2007; Clark, 2013). We re-assess clinical deficits in terms of the 
disruptions in a precisely tuned hierarchy of prediction, prediction error and inference.  
The predictive coding accounts of normative brain function integrate cognitive and computational 
neuroscience to explain how we perceive and interact with our environment. It proposes that in health, the 
brain acts as an active Bayesian inference machine that learns in terms of statistical regularities in the external 
world (Box 1), and generates predictions to increase the efficiency of information processing and 
understanding of our sensorium (Rao and Ballard, 1999; Friston, 2005a; Bar, 2007; Clark, 2013).  
The predictive coding account serves as a common neurobiological framework to describe cognitive, 
perceptual and behavioural phenomena. There is direct evidence for predictive coding of vision (Hosoya et al., 
2005; Hohwy et al., 2008), rhythmic perception (Vuust et al., 2009; Vuust and Witek, 2014), auditory 
processing (Wicha et al., 2004; Kumar et al., 2011; Dikker and Pylkkänen, 2013; Lewis and Bastiaansen, 2015; 
Lewis et al., 2015), reward and preferences (O'Doherty et al., 2006), and action control (Ramnani and Miall, 
2004; Kilner, 2011). The representation of predictions, prediction errors and precision in each system depends 
on a fine-tuned cortical hierarchy, with laminar-specific connectivity and balanced excitatory-inhibitory 
neurochemistry (Figure 1A). Imbalances or disruption in the system result in domain-specific or domain-
general cognitive impairments, as has been established for psychosis (Fletcher and Frith, 2009; Friston et al., 
2014b) and autism (Pellicano and Burr, 2012; Lawson et al., 2014). For example, hallucinations and delusions 
arise from faulty precision-weighting of the prediction error signals (Fletcher and Frith, 2009), leading to an 
increased reliance over the internal model and reduced reliance on sensory evidence.  
In this Update, we re-assess the impairments in perception, action and higher cognition in the predictive 
coding framework, and consider the mechanisms of impairment in dementia and related neurodegenerative 
diseases. We start with perception and action, with an emphasis on the lower levels of cortical hierarchy, 
before considering higher cognitive systems.   
 
Perception 
In perceiving our environment, we make use of prior knowledge and context to predict sensory inputs. In the 
auditory scene analysis, we parse its constituent objects over time and space, such as recognising one’s own 
name in a noisy environment (i.e. the cocktail party effect) (Bregman, 1990). Top-down predictions based on 
prior experience of the speakers, their language and the topic, facilitates this segregation, especially in noisy 
environments (Griffiths and Warren, 2002). In vision, the context-based predictions likewise aid rapid object 
recognition under both normal and challenging conditions (Bar, 2007; Summerfield and de Lange, 2014).  
The use of auditory predictions is largely preserved in normal ageing (Moran et al., 2013) but can be 
significantly disrupted in mild cognitive impairment and dementia. These abilities use temporo-parietal areas 
that are affected by Alzheimer’s disease (Golden et al., 2015), and accordingly, patients have difficulty 
following conversations in the presence of background noise. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease show 
impairments in segregating, tracking and grouping auditory objects that evolve over time (Goll et al., 2012), 
and in perceiving sound location and motion (Golden et al., 2015). They are  

4 
 
  
also worse at adapting to expected auditory stimuli (reduced auditory mismatch negativity responses - (Gaeta 
et al., 1999; Pekkonen et al., 2001; Laptinskaya et al., 2018)). Even otherwise healthy APOE4 carriers (i.e. 
elevated risk of Alzheimer’s disease) show impairments in detecting auditory targets using contextual 
information (Zimmermann et al., 2019). Patients with amnestic and logopenic phenotypes of Alzheimer’s 
disease are impaired in processing a melodic contour, which depends on working memory to predict the 
upcoming sounds (Golden et al., 2017). 
In the visual domain, hallucinations and illusions are commonly reported in patients with cortical Lewy body 
pathology. The perceptual content is often based on the immediate environment or autobiographical 
memories, with pareidolic experiences in ambiguous sceneries (Uchiyama et al., 2012), or familiar people or 
pets (Barnes and David, 2001), even if known to have died. The hallucinations are visually complex and 
familiar, rather than simple visual percepts such as amorphous shapes and shadows (Collerton et al., 2005; 
Mosimann et al., 2006; Moran et al., 2013). This is expected in the predictive coding framework, as a result of 
abnormal up-weighting of intermediate level priors and relative down-weighting of the visual sensory 
evidence (Friston, 2005b; Fletcher and Frith, 2009; Sterzer et al., 2018; Corlett et al., 2019). Several 
neuroanatomical sites have been implicated (Pezzoli et al., 2017), with abnormal activity and connectivity 
between visual cortex, medial temporal and medial prefrontal areas  
Box 1: Predictive coding and the hierarchical networks 
Predictive coding describes how the brain perpetually creates and evaluates its own predictions across cognitive and 
behavioural domains. To explain this fundamental mechanism of the brain, predictive coding rests their premises on 
prior cognitive models such as those of Helmholtz, who proposed that perception is the outcome of probabilistic 
inferences and the predictive dynamics of information processing. The predictive coding accounts (Rao and Ballard, 
1999; Friston, 2005a; Bar, 2007; Clark, 2013) put forward a biological implementation of generative models with 
multi-level hierarchies encompassing neural circuits at the micro and macro level. These models are proposed to 
capture statistical patterns and dependencies in the external world and events, and used these patterns to deliver 
top-down predictions, in turn increasing the efficiency of an organism’s information processing and understanding 
of the external world. Each layer in the hierarchy predicts the activity in the layer below through top-down relay of 
information. When a mismatch arises between the prediction and the sensory input, then the residual errors 
between the two, are propagated bottom-up. Overlapping with some previous theories (Mumford, 1992; Barlow, 
1994), the forward and backward connections are suggested to convey bottom-up prediction errors and the top-
down predictions respectively.  
A key feature of the generative models is plasticity. The internal model is proposed to update its probabilistic history 
of past perceptions and their causes, i.e. recognition density or priors, to fine-tune itself iteratively with every 
prediction and increase the accuracy of future predictions. Both the predictions and prediction errors are relayed 
with precision weighting, i.e. an estimate of uncertainty, computed across all levels of the information processing 
cascade. The iterative updates of the internal model are influenced by the relative precision weights of the 
prediction and prediction error, where larger weights have greater impact on the distribution. The account 
therefore, puts forward hypotheses for the functional specialisation of connections in the anatomy of cortical 
hierarchies as well as dynamic process of prediction-to-perception. Any disruptions to the components of the model 
could result in domain-general impairments, for example over-reliance on the priors, under-reliance on sensory 
evidence, failure to detect errors, inability to capture probabilistic patterns and learn. 
In predictive coding, updating of the predictions is weighted by measures of certainty (or precision) of the 
predictions and the sensory information (Brown et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2019), such that, in a novel environment 
sensory information is more likely to be weighted favourably, or when sensory information is diminished predictions 
are held with higher precision. This fine balance determines optimal motor control for initiating and inhibiting 
movement, and for learning or tuning motor schema. Although in predictive coding, dopamine is considered to be 
one of the key neurotransmitters mediating precision (Friston et al., 2012; Friston et al., 2014a), this theory is 
relevant to many non-dopaminergic disorders. Impairments at any level of the distributed hierarchical process for 
movement can result in a cascade of errors that leads to erroneous motor output that is difficult to modify. At lower 
levels, impairments lead to bradykinesia, apraxia, or alien limb, while dysfunction at higher levels can lead to apathy, 
impulsivity or disinhibition.

Fig 1. Predictive coding mechanism within the hierarchical brain network 
A. Schematic illustration of the predictive coding mechanism at a single cortical layer within the hierarchy. Top-down predictions are 
conveyed via the backward connections (black arrows) from the state units (black nodes) in the deep cortical layers. The predictions 
are compared with conditional expectations at the lower level in the hierarchy by the error units in the superficial cortical layers (blue 
nodes) to produce prediction errors, which are then passed bottom-up (blue arrows) to the higher level to update the predictions in a 
Bayesian fashion. Triangles and circles represent pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons respectively. Precision weighting (red) 
regulates the post-synaptic gain of the error units, via neuromodulation. B-D illustrates three layers of a hierarchical network of the 
motor system as an example of how the predictive coding mechanism gets impaired in neurodegenerative diseases, going from lower 
to higher cortical layers from left (light blue) to right (yellow). Each layer of the hierarchy makes predictions relayed in a top-down 
fashion. Higher layers of the network make episodic predictions that are multimodal, abstract and span across a longer timescale (e.g. 
remembering that the London marathon is in two months). Intermediate layers carry out task-set predictions that depend on the 
immediate context and last a shorter timescale (e.g. expecting to see runners, cheering supporters and water stands on the venue). 
Lower layers make fast-moving, proprioceptive predictions on the expected consequences of our actions (e.g. expected position of the 
limbs and the body following each stride). B. Normal cortical hierarchy of the motor system is characterized with optimal control where 
top-down predictions suppress the bottom-up prediction errors at each layer. C. In apathy, predictions at the higher levels fail to 
suppress prediction errors at the intermediate level, leading to stronger contextual prediction errors, and reduced goal-directed 
movement. D. In akinesia, predictions at the lower levels fail to suppress proprioceptive prediction errors, resulting in failure to move.

(Stebbins et al., 2004; Ramírez-Ruiz et al., 2007; Perneczky et al., 2008; Sanchez-Castaneda et al., 2010; 
Peraza et al., 2014; Heitz et al., 2015; Shine et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2015; O'Callaghan et al., 2017a). However, 
cholinergic insufficiency rather than atrophy is proposed to be the cause. Acetylcholine enhances sensory 
precision and strengthens bottom-up signalling (Moran et al., 2013). The cholinergic loss in dementia with 
Lewy bodies would weaken the feed-forward prediction errors relative to the feedback information of 
predictions based on higher level priors (Collerton et al., 2005; Diederich et al., 2005; O'Callaghan et al., 
2017b). Indeed, patients who experience more visual hallucinations have more severe degeneration of their 
cholinergic pathways (Ballard et al., 2000; Harding et al., 2002; Halliday, 2005), and these symptoms are 
alleviated with cholinesterase inhibitors (Mori et al., 2006). 
 
Action and apathy 
In the active inference framework, the prediction errors in sensory systems could be minimised either by 
updating future predictions or by changing the sensory inputs to match the predictions. Although the direct 
evidence for active inference is largely from motor control (Kilner, 2011), behavioural symptoms  like apathy 
could arise from disruptions at higher levels (Hezemans et al., 2020). 
Evidence for active inference comes from ‘sensorimotor attenuation’: a transient down-weighting of the 
predicted sensory consequences of actions, observed in 98% of healthy adults (Figure 1B) (Wolpe et al., 
2016a). For example, when participants attempt to match a force applied to their hand by pressing a sensor 
with a finger, the force generated is typically greater than the force applied. This is suggested to facilitate 
movement, enhance perception, and provide a sense of agency (cf.(Wolpe and Rowe, 2014)).  In healthy 
ageing there is greater reliance on the predictions and less on the sensorium (Wolpe et al., 2016a). Whereas 
in neurodegenerative diseases, deficits in sensorimotor predictions (or their precision) results in an over-
reliance on sensory evidence, causing a poverty of movement (Brown et al., 2013; Wolpe et al., 2016b; Wolpe 
et al., 2018a). Deficits in sensorimotor predictions are linked to disease severity (Wolpe et al., 2014; Wolpe et 
al., 2018b), volumetric and white matter loss in pre-supplementary motor area (Halliday et al., 2005; Wolpe 
and Rowe, 2014; Wolpe et al., 2018a). Symptomatic therapies using peripheral vibration can improve motor 
symptoms in some patients (cf.Sweeney et al., 2019 for review), by reducing the precision from sensory 
evidence and increasing the relative precision of the prediction (Macerollo et al., 2018). The physiological 
correlate of sensorimotor attenuation is beta desynchronisation (Palmer et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Palmer 
et al., 2019) which is required for movement planning and initiation (Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999). 
In bradykinetic disorders, beta power is elevated (Schnitzler and Gross, 2005; Levy et al., 2010; Bizovicar et al., 
2014; Moisello et al., 2015). Dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson’s disease can enhance beta 
desynchronisation, (Brown and Marsden, 1999; Levy et al., 2010) and increase sensorimotor attenuation 
(Macerollo et al., 2016; Wolpe et al., 2018a).  
Apathy, like bradykinesia, could be explained by deficits in the precision of the prediction, however the 
deficits occur within high levels of the hierarchy (Figure 1C): within a network involving anterior cingulate and 
prefrontal cortex with loss of connectivity to the striatum (Le Heron et al., 2018; Nobis and Husain, 2018; 
Passamonti et al., 2018). In active inference terms, when the precision of the prediction is low or there is low 
certainty in action-outcome mapping, the outcome is a lack of response (Friston et al., 2010; Friston et al., 
2014a; Parr et al., 2019). In healthy controls greater expression of apathy trait is associated with lower 
certainty on predictions about action outcomes (Hezemans et al., 2020). In bradykinesia a lack of movement, 
for instance to switch on a light in a dark room, is due to overriding sensory evidence from proprioception 
that they are not moving, relative to the impaired precision on the predictions for movement. This results in 
limited sensorimotor attenuation, and thus an inability to initiate the action to switch on the light. In contrast, 
patients with apathy may not initiate the action to switch on the light because the sensory evidence, that the 
room is dark, overrides the weak predictions/precision of the internal prediction (to switch on the light). 
Apathy may also be linked to deficits in how reward and cost are encoded in the prediction or how the value 
of the action weights precision (Hezemans et al., 2020), suggesting that high cost or low value actions, and 
low certainty of action-outcome contingencies can result in absence of movement. In this light, dopamine is 

7 
 
re-framed as a modulator of the precision of higher-order states, not just of the sensory evidence. As such, it 
modulates active inference by which complex behaviours are executed to resolve the prediction error 
between high-order predictions and intermediate feedforward evidence of the state. Devaluation of 
outcomes by dopamine depletion then reduces behaviour (Hezemans et al., 2020). However, non-
dopaminergic changes in dementia will lead to a similar change in precision weighting and result in apathy, 
including noradrenaline (Ruthirakuhan et al., 2018), GABA and glutamate, which regulate the precision of 
feedforward and feedback information transfer in cortical hierarchies (Moran et al., 2007; Moran et al., 2015).  
The changes in GABA and glutamate in dementias (Murley and Rowe, 2018) may therefore contribute to 
apathy, in the presence of relatively normal dopaminergic function.  
Speech and language 
Healthy language comprehension shows remarkable speed and resistance to noise, which is supported by 
predictive coding mechanisms at multiple levels of linguistic representation: phonological (Gagnepain et al., 
2012; Ettinger et al., 2014; Monsalve et al., 2018), semantic (DeLong et al., 2005; Lau et al., 2013; Lau and 
Nguyen, 2015; Maess et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Klimovich-Gray et al., 2019), syntactic (Fonteneau, 2013; 
Wlotko and Federmeier, 2015; Henderson et al., 2016) and discourse context (Otten and Van Berkum, 2008). 
In neurodegenerative aphasias, many of the deficits of frontotemporal and temporo-parietal networks can be 
understood in terms of impairments of predictive coding.   
Degeneration of frontal and perisylvian cortex leads to speech production deficits and agrammatism (Gorno-
Tempini et al., 2004; Hayes et al., 2016; Henry et al., 2016). This reduces the top-down control used to 
optimise perception and production of speech (Pickering and Garrod, 2007, 2013; Park et al., 2015; Sohoglu 
and Davis, 2016). As a result, non-fluent aphasic patients show greater speech processing deficits and delays 
at the lexical level when speech is degraded (Utman et al., 2001; Moineau et al., 2005) or ambiguous 
(Hagoort, 1993; Swaab et al., 1998; Grindrod and Baum, 2005). While damage to the temporo-parietal 
junction leads to repetition deficit (Baldo et al., 2008; Buchsbaum et al., 2011) arising from disrupted mapping 
between speech representations and proprioceptive articulatory predictions in the motor and inferior frontal 
cortices (Adams et al., 2013; Parr et al., 2018). Cope et al. (2017) showed that in the presence of intact 
temporal cortex, frontal neurodegeneration in non-fluent primary progressive aphasia (nvPPA) causes overly 
precise and inflexible contextual predictions, with reduced frontal-to-temporal directional connectivity (Figure 
2B-D). This leads to delayed resolution of speech inputs by the temporal cortex, and impaired perception of 
degraded speech. However, the reliance on inflexible priors becomes a paradoxical advantage as noise 
increases. Accordingly, the patients’ symptoms were relatively reduced in noisy environments and worse in 
quiet settings. Inflexible predictions similarly affect speech production in nvPPA. Whereas delayed auditory 
feedback in healthy controls reduces fluency and accuracy of speech (Lin et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016), 
delayed feedback does not impair nvPPA fluency: this suggests a reliance on internal models of speech (with 
strong priors) and relative weakness of the precision of sensory representations (Hardy et al., 2018).  
Efficient reading requires greater top-down signalling from higher order language areas to disambiguate 
visually confusable words (Price and Devlin, 2011). While damage to the left medial occipito-temporal areas 
causes alexia and object agnosia with spared central language abilities and orthographic knowledge (Damasio 
and Damasio, 1983; Binder and Mohr, 1992), reading deficits are often more severe than object recognition 
deficits. Concurrently, lesions of inferior frontal cortex cause auditory agnosias and pure word deafness 
(Confavreux et al., 1992; Otsuki et al., 1998). Woodhead et al. (2013) showed that whole-word training to 
improve reading was associated with stronger feedback connectivity from the inferior frontal gyrus to the 
occipital areas, and bidirectional connectivity between ventral occipito-temporal and occipital areas. This 
suggests stronger top-down priors aid prediction of the words. Semantic processing is similarly dependent on 
top-down signalling, using contextual information and prior knowledge to predict forthcoming words 
(Kocagoncu et al., 2017; Klimovich-Gray et al., 2019; Lyu et al., 2019). The N400 is an electrophysiological 
index of the prediction error, reflecting the degree of mismatch between semantic priors and sensory input 
(Kutas and Federmeier, 2011) (i.e. semantic prediction error). Semantic dementia impairs the differentiation 
of concepts that belong to the same semantic category, such as giraffe and zebra (i.e. taxonomic blurring). 

8 
 
They display preserved N400 to semantically unrelated words, but significantly reduced N400 to semantically 
related words (Hurley et al., 2012), indicating the weakness of the semantic priors. Disambiguating meaningful 
objects (but not meaningless shapers) in difficult viewing conditions (Cumming et al., 2006) is also impaired, 
suggesting domain-general deficit of top-down semantic control. 
 
Memory and learning 
Statistical dependencies and regularities underpin our learned beliefs, and form the priors to understand 
future experience. Hippocampus is proposed to encode expectancies of future events based on the 
probabilistic consequences of the past events (Eichenbaum et al., 1999; Strange et al., 2005; Harrison et al., 
2006), its activity is modulated by the entropy, a measure of predictability, of the future events before they 
take place (Weiler et al., 2010). A corollary of this, damage to the medial temporal lobe structures in many 
dementias, has severe implications for memory retrieval, episodic future thinking and probabilistic learning.

frontotemporal dementia patients compared to healthy controls. Figure displays local (intrinsic) decreases in self-modulation of the

frequency responses at the written word offset, and spoken word onset. The beta power was significantly higher in the nvPPA group

Predictive coding mechanism underlies anticipating events both at micro and macro timescales. At the macro 
timescale, prospection refers to the ability to create mental simulations of future episodes, actions and 

9 
 
expectations on their consequences (Gilbert and Wilson, 2007). Prospection is an integral part of decision 
making, and planning in novel scenarios. Future simulations are created by using prior episodes and 
knowledge as building blocks (Johnson and Sherman, 1990; Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993), and they activate 
the same network involved in remembering the past: the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe 
structures (Addis et al., 2007; Schacter et al., 2007). Patients with Alzheimer’s disease, semantic dementia, 
and hippocampal damage show comparable impairments in past and future thinking (Hassabis and Maguire, 
2007; Addis et al., 2009; Andelman et al., 2010; Gamboz et al., 2010; Irish et al., 2012; Irish et al., 2015). Their 
imaginary episodes are fragmented and show significant reductions in richness and content. Similarly, 
selective insult to the prefrontal cortex (Klein et al., 2002), in frontotemporal dementia (Irish et al., 2013) and 
damage to the fronto-striatal pathways in Parkinson’s disease (de Vito et al., 2012) results in impoverished 
future thinking.  
The ability to anticipate events at the micro timescale breaks down in many dementias. The weather 
prediction task captures probabilistic learning and is associated with activity and connectivity in fronto-striatal 
circuits (Knowlton et al., 1994). Although patients with Alzheimer’s can perform this task well (Klimkowicz-
Mrowiec et al., 2008), Parkinson’s disease (Knowlton et al., 1996; Shohamy et al., 2004), Huntington’s disease 
(Holl et al., 2012), and frontotemporal dementia patients (Dalton et al., 2012; Weickert et al., 2013) have 
severely impaired performance. Short-term learning and plasticity are also identified by auditory mismatch 
paradigms. Mismatch responses to ‘oddball events’ index the prediction error that is fed-forward from 
primary to secondary auditory cortex then to frontal cortex, so as to update predictions that are in turn fed-
backwards to temporal cortex (Garrido et al., 2009). The amplitude of mismatch negativity is reduced in 
Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia (Jiang et al., 2017), Parkinson’s disease (Brønnick et al., 2010), and 
frontotemporal dementia (Hughes and Rowe, 2013), with impaired  frontotemporal connectivity  (Stam et al., 
2006; Hughes and Rowe, 2013; Beste et al., 2017; Shaw et al., 2019) (Figure 2A). Alzheimer’s patients show 
impairments in the mismatch responses especially at longer inter-stimulus intervals (Pekkonen et al., 1994; 
Gaeta et al., 1999; Pekkonen et al., 2001), in relation to reduced temporal activity (Ruzzoli et al., 2016; Jiang 
et al., 2017). 
Memory and learning are dependent on cholinergic modulation of NMDA receptor plasticity (Miaskinov et al., 
2008), which modulates the precision of the prediction error (Moran et al., 2013; Carbajal and Malmierca, 
2018). Impaired mismatch response in Alzheimer’s disease is partially explained by the degeneration of 
cholinergic projections, with relatively preserved top-down propagation of the priors (Ruzzoli et al., 2016). 
Cholinergic agents partially restore the mismatch response in Alzheimer’s disease (Engeland et al., 2002), 
enhancing feed-forward signalling by precision of the sensory evidence weighting (Yu and Dayan, 2002; 
Moran et al., 2013). Similarly, dopamine is suggested to encode prediction errors, and that successful 
feedback-based learning is dependent on intact dopaminergic modulation of bottom-up signals (Schultz et al., 
1997). Interestingly, when Parkinsons’ patients are on medication, their learning is remediated on tasks that 
give positive feedback (Knowlton et al., 1996; Frank et al., 2004). These findings suggest that memory, sensory 
and reward-based learning could get impaired following dopaminergic, cholinergic imbalances as well as 
fronto-striatal damage in dementia.  
 
Risk taking and impulsivity 
Disinhibited and impulsive behaviors are common to many dementias (Nombela et al., 2014; Lansdall et al., 
2017; Borges et al., 2019), describing the predisposition to act out of context, prematurely, or on the basis of 
little evidence (Dalley and Robbins, 2017). In the predictive coding framework, these behaviours may also be 
explained by impaired precision on the internal predictions at higher levels. 
Early or fast responses, in tasks such as Go-NoGo or stop-signal RT, may be related to impaired elevated 
precision on prior beliefs (Limongi et al., 2018). Drift diffusion models (Zhang et al., 2016) demonstrate how 
patients with PSP can be both impulsive and bradykinetic in an oculomotor decision task: patients had slow 
drift rates, reflecting limited sensory attenuation (resulting in bradykinesia, as discussed above), but had a 

10 
 
response bias towards the decision boundary – that is a high confidence in their prior ‘to move’. 
Consequently, patients may be slow to move but nevertheless quick to reach a decision to move. 
For more complex decisions, when selecting between different valued outcomes, impulsive decisions may be 
related to impairments in the prediction errors, as illustrated by classic gambling tasks.  In gambling tasks, that 
pay high reward on ‘risky decks’, patients with frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s 
disease choose the risky decks more frequently than healthy controls (Delazer et al., 2007; Sinz et al., 2008) 
The risk-taking behaviour is associated with impairments in dopamine and noradrenaline signalling for 
processing prediction errors. 
Dopamine and its receptor affinity is largely depleted in dorsal striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in 
early stages of Parkinson’s disease (Agid et al., 1993; Kaasinen et al., 2003) and linked to impaired feedback 
processing (Brand et al., 2004), specifically for modulating future decisions with the help of negative feedback 
(Frank et al., 2004). These studies underline the crucial role of dopamine in prediction error signalling, as well 
as encoding reward-based outcome of decisions. The dopamine hypothesis may explain reflection impulsivity 
in Parkinson’s disease (Averbeck et al., 2013), and perhaps in part in PSP which has dopamine deficiency and 
significant atrophy of the midbrain (Bocchetta et al., 2019).   
Noradrenaline is also a key regulator of impulsivity. A focal noradrenergic area is the locus coeruleus, affected 
in many neurodegenerative diseases, including synucleinopathies, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and 
Alzheimer’s disease (Betts et al., 2019) and strongly associated with impulsivity (Passamonti et al., 2018). The 
locus coreuleus is widely connected to motor control circuits, including the subthalamic nucleus, motor 
cortex, and pre-supplementary motor area (Hamani et al., 2004; Bonnevie and Zaghloul, 2019). In predictive 
coding framework, activation in this structure is linked to learning about changing contingencies (for example 
in reversal learning) and is suggested to mediate the reciprocal subcortical-cortical circuit of updating 
predictions from prediction errors (Sales et al., 2019). Depletion of tyrosine, a substrate required for 
dopamine synthesis, worsens performance on gambling tasks (Sevy et al., 2006); whereas methylphenidate, a 
dopamine and noradrenergic agonist, ameliorates risk-taking in frontotemporal dementia patients (Rahman et 
al., 2006). Similarly, atomoxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, reduces reflection impulsivity 
and risk taking in Parkinson’s disease (Kehagia et al., 2014; Rae et al., 2016). 
 
Conclusion 
In this Update, we reviewed recent clinical evidence with the main purpose of shifting our thinking from 
localist frameworks to disorders of cortical hierarchies, in understanding the makings of clinical phenomena. 
We have discussed the generalisability of the predictive coding principles to account for cognitive and 
perceptual impairments observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Whilst acknowledging that predictive 
coding framework is not a panacea for explaining all clinical phenomena, we showed how a diverse range of 
neurocognitive deficits and aetiology could be described as mechanistic disruptions in a fine-tuned cortical 
system relying on maintaining a fragile balance. We discussed that there are multiple pathological routes 
leading to behavioural symptoms that appear similar on the surface but arise from different disruptions in the 
network. We then reviewed evidence on how the disruptions within hierarchical predictions could arise from 
changes in connectivity in relation to neurochemical imbalances that weight the importance (i.e. precision) of 
the predictions. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that cortical hierarchies could be thrown off balance in 
neurodegenerative diseases due to widespread atrophy, and changes in connectivity and neurochemistry, 
which could be explained within the predictive coding framework. Further frequency-resolved network and 
modelling at the microcircuit level of these mechanisms is necessary to further our understanding of clinical 
phenomena, and to develop better diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
