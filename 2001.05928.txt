Abstract:
Recently two of the authors presented a spinorial extension of the scattering equations,
the polarized scattering equations that incorporates spinor polarization data. These led to new world-
sheet amplitude formulae for a variety of gauge, gravity and brane theories in six dimensions that
naturally incorporate fermions and directly extend to maximal supersymmetry. This paper provides a
number of improvements to the original formulae, together with extended details of the construction,
examples and full proofs of some of the formulae by BCFW recursion and factorization. We show
how our formulae reduce to corresponding formulae for maximally supersymmetric gauge, gravity and
brane theories in ﬁve and four dimensions. In four dimensions our framework naturally gives the
twistorial version of the 4d ambitwistor string, giving new insights into the nature of the reﬁned and
polarized scattering equations they give rise to, and on the relations between its measure and the CHY
measure. Our formulae exhibit a natural double-copy structure being built from ‘half-integrands’. We
give further discussion of the matrix of theories and formulae to which our half-integrands give rise,
including controversial formulae for amplitudes involving Gerbes.

Introduction
Worldsheet approaches to scattering amplitudes generate perhaps the most compact and mathemati-
cally structured formulae for tree-level S-matrices and loop integrands available. These formulations
cannot at this stage be obtained from space-time action formulations. The ﬁrst such formulae for
ﬁeld theory amplitudes (as opposed to conventional string theory amplitudes) arose from the twistor
strings of Witten [1], Berkovits [2] and Skinner [3]. These give rise to remarkable worldsheet formulae
for tree-level super Yang-Mills [4, 5] and gravity [6] in four dimensions. These formulae were extended
by Cachazo, He and Yuan (CHY) [7] to tree formulae for gravity and Yang-Mills amplitudes in all
dimensions together with a variety of further theories [8] including D-branes and Born-Infeld theories,
but without fermions or supersymmetry.
The CHY formulae are based on the scattering equations. These are equations for n points on
the Riemann sphere arising from the n null momenta taking part in a scattering process. They were
ﬁrst discovered in conventional string theory as a semi-classical approximation in [9] and at high
energy [10].
They were then seen to underpin the twistor string [11] and to naturally arise from
string theories in the space of complex null geodesics, ambitwistor space [12] in an RNS formulation.
These RNS ambitwistor models provide the worldsheet theories underpinning the CHY formulae and
extend straightforwardly [13] to incorporate the later CHY formulae [8]. The RNS ambitwistor model
was followed by a fully supersymmetric pure spinor formulation in 10 dimensions [14] but which does
not lead to such explicit formulae for amplitudes. Although the original RNS forms of ambitwistor
string theories contain supersymmetry and fermions in their Ramond sectors, as do the pure spinor
formulations more directly, it has been diﬃcult to obtain explicit formulae for such amplitudes with
arbitrary numbers of fermions. As such they don’t directly make contact with the original twistor-
string formulae by dimensional reduction.
A framework was subsequently developed in six dimensions [15, 16] that allowed the supersym-
metric extension of the original CHY formulae and those for brane theories. These models had some
features of the original RSVW formulae [4, 5] in that moduli of maps from the worldsheet to chiral
spin space in six-dimensions are integrated out against delta functions. Although these authors were
able to obtain amplitude formulae for a variety of supersymmetric theories in this way, there were a
number of issues. In particular the formulae distinguish between even and odd numbers of particles,
and become quite awkward for odd numbers of particles in gauge and gravity theories where such
distinctions are not natural. Although a number of persuasive checks were made, there has been no
attempt at a systematic proof of factorization or recursion for these formulae. Their possible origins
from worldsheet models remain obscure.
Subsequently the last two named authors of this paper introduced a distinct approach [17] based
on extending the scattering equations to incorporate polarization data. These polarized scattering
equations have a geometric origin in string theories in six-dimensional ambitwistor space expressed in
twistorial coordinates (although complete worldsheet theories that give rise to the full supersymmetric
worldsheet formulae remain lacking). They were used to obtain compact formulae for amplitudes for
a full range of six-dimensional theories, now without any awkward distinction between even and odd
numbers of particles for gauge and gravity theories. These formulae diﬀered from those of [15, 16]
both in the underlying form of the scattering equations, and also provided a number of new integrand
structures. These included 6-dimensional analogues of the 4d formulae of [18] that provided a more
eﬃcient and compact version of the RSVW [4, 5] and Cachazo-Skinner formulae [6] for gauge and grav-
ity theories, as well as formulae for D5 and M5-branes all expressed naturally in new supersymmetry
representations. There were also more controversial formulae for Gerbe multiplets with (2, 0) super-
– 2 –

symmetry that were analogous to gauge theory amplitudes and with (3, 1) and (4, 0) supersymmetry
that have some analogy with Gerbe-like gravity amplitudes.
In this article we give an improved and more detailed analysis of the formulae of [17]. We shift
the supersymmetry representation in such a way as to maintain the same simple exponential structure
but so that it no longer depends on the solutions to the polarized scattering equations. We present
manifestly permutation invariant expressions for the brane integrands, as well as direct computations
for three and four point amplitudes, which we compare to known answers previously obtained by
recursion [19, 20]. For the polarized scattering equations we give a deeper analysis, showing that
generically there is a unique solution for each solution to the conventional scattering equations: we
prove that, although they are superﬁcially expressed as nonlinear equations, the solutions can be
obtained by normalizing solutions to a system of linear equations. As a further check on the formulae,
we derive the symmetry reductions to ﬁve dimensions giving formulae for the same variety of theories
there with maximal supersymmetry. We also show that the controversial (0, 2)-PT, (3, 1) and (4, 0)
formulae for interacting gerbes reduce to standard gauge and gravity formulae in 5d. Reducing further
to 4d we land directly on the 4d ambitwistor string formulae of [18]. Our treatment gives new insights
there, giving an interpretation of the 4d reﬁned scattering equations introduced there as also being
polarized scattering equations. We also give a proof via 6d of the relation between the CHY measure
in 4d with the 4d reﬁned/polarized scattering equations measure.
Our main result consists of a proof of factorization for all our gauge, gravity and brane formulae.
We also introduce a new spinorial realization of BCFW recursion adapted to 6d for gauge and gravity
that therefore leads to a full proof of our formulae. Somewhat surprisingly, despite their poor power
counting at large momenta, our brane formulae have no boundary contribution for large BCFW shifts.
The paper is structured as follows.
In §2 we give an extended introduction.
This contains a
review of the formulae of CHY and the original scattering equations, the four dimensional formulae of
[18]. We structure this four-dimensional discussion to highlight that these formulae were also based on
4d polarized scattering equations (as are the closely related RSVW formulae [4] based on the original
twistor-string). The review goes on to deﬁne the ingredients and details of the six-dimensional formulae
of [17] with some improvements and updates to include for example (2, 0)-supergravities and statements
of the main results. In §3 the polarized scattering equations and measure are studied in more detail.
It is shown that given a solution to the original scattering equations, there exists generically a unique
solution to the polarized scattering equations which can be obtained essentially by solving linear
equations and then normalizing.
The associated measures are also shown to reduce to the CHY
measure. Section 4 goes on to prove basic properties of the integrands we use, permutation invariance
(see also appendix A.1), invariance under supersymmetry and compatibility of the supersymmetry
factors with the reduced determinants. In §5 the three and four point amplitudes are computed from
the new formulae and shown to agree with the standard answers for the corresponding theories. Section
6 gives the symmetry reductions to give new formulae in ﬁve dimension, and then to the standard
known formulae of [18] in four dimensions, giving new insights into the relations between CHY and
4d reﬁned/polarized scattering equations measures there.
The full proof of the gauge and gravity formulae by BCFW recursion is given in section 7. Along
the way we prove factorization for all non-controversial formulae. Our BCFW shifts are diﬀerent from
those of other authors so we give a brief comparison in Appendix A.2. To give a practical example we
use our BCFW shift to derive the four point formulae in appendix A.4.
Finally in §8 we discuss further issues and directions. These include a brief discussion of the
Grassmannian approach of [16] and its use in [21] to obtain a correspondence between the formulae
studied in this paper and those of [16]. This leads to some brief remarks concerning analogues of
– 3 –

the momentum amplituhedron of [22] in 6d. There is also some discussion of ambitwistor worldsheet
models and the controversial formulae for Gerbe theories with (2, 0), (3, 1) and (4, 0) supersymmetry.

Review and extended summary of results
We start with a review of the CHY formulae [7] for gauge and gravity theories with a brief mention
of those for other theories [23]. We further give an introduction to the 4d reﬁned/polarized scattering
equation formulae of [18] in such as a way as to bring out the analogy with the formulae that come
later in 6d as the scattering equations there were extended to include an extra scaling per point that
incorporates the polarization data.1 This extended introduction then introduces the six-dimensional
spinor-helicity formalism [19], polarized scattering equations, measures and integrands that underlie
the formulae for the various diﬀerent theories, and then summarizes the amplitude formulae and other
main results of the paper.
2.1
Review of CHY
For a scattering process involving n null momenta ki, the scattering equations arise from a meromorphic
vector-valued function
P(σ)µ =
n
X
i=1
kiµ
σ −σi
,
(2.1)
where σ ∈C is a coordinate on the Riemann sphere CP1. When momentum is conserved, P(σ)µ
naturally transforms as a 1-form on CP1 under M¨obius transforms. Equivalently, P(σ) has weight
−2 in homogeneous coordinates and is a section of the line bundle O(−2) on CP1. The scattering
equations are then
Resσi
P 2(σ)
2
= ki · P(σi) =
X
j
ki · kj
σij
= 0 ,
σij = σi −σj.
(2.2)
The scattering equations imply that P 2(σ) is global and holomorphic, but it must then vanish as there
are no global one-forms squared on CP1, so P(σ)µ is therefore null for all σ.
The scattering equations then underpin the CHY formulae for massless scattering amplitudes in
the form

1 In that paper, the equations were referred to as the reﬁned scattering equations as the extra data and measures
distinguish the diﬀerent MHV sectors so they were reﬁned by MHV degree.

Here, the Jacobians for the gauge-ﬁxing and solving the scattering equations are given by
|pqr| := σpqσqrσrp ,
Φij := ∂ki · P(σi)
∂σj
,
(2.5)
and the superscript pqr denotes the removal of the corresponding rows and subscript lmn the cor-
responding columns. It is standard that (2.4) is permutation invariant [7]. The integration is over
M0,n, the space of n marked points on the Riemann sphere, having divided by the volume of the
M¨obius transformations SL(2, C) in the Faddeev-Popov sense. (The second C3 factor is removed by
removing the pqr delta functions in the product and replacing them with a further factor of |pqr|).
The delta functions are understood as complex delta functions that localize the integral to a sum over
the (n −3)! solutions to the scattering equations of residues given by the integrand I divided by the
given Jacobian.
The integrands denoted I vary from theory to theory. They are usually a product of two factors
I = Ih
L Ih
R with each “half-integrand” Ih
L,R transforming under M¨obius transformations as a 1-form in
each σi. In the original CHY formulae, two possibilities for these half-intgrands were discussed. The
ﬁrst was a Parke-Taylor factor that depends on a permutation ρ
PT(ρ) =
n
Y
i=1
1
σρ(i) ρ(i+1)
.
(2.6)
The second was the CHY Pfaﬃan Pf′(M) where M is the skew matrix that depends on polarization
vectors eiµ associated to each null momenta kiµ

σli ,
i = j .
(2.7)
On the support of the scattering equations, the matrices M have a two-dimensional kernel, and so the
Pfaﬃan Pf M vanishes. One can however deﬁne a non-trivial reduced Pfaﬃan by deleting two rows
and columns, say i and j, and quotienting by the corresponding generators of the kernel,
Pf′(M) := 1
σij
Pf(M[ij]).
(2.8)
This reduced Pfaﬃan is invariant under which rows and columns are removed. We then obtain
Yang-Mills:

(2.9a)
Gravity:
Z

(2.9b)
There are many related formulae. Biadjoint scalar amplitudes are constructed from a product of two
Parke-Taylors and further integrands for Einstein-Yang-Mills, DBI, and other massless theories in
[13, 23].
2.2
The reﬁned/polarized scattering equations in 4d
In four dimensions, polarization data can be presented in terms of spinor-helicity variables. A null
momentum kµ, µ = 1, . . . , d, is expressed for d = 4 in terms of two-component spinors kα ˙α = κα˜κ ˙α,
– 5 –

α = 1, 2, ˙α = ˙1, ˙2. We will use the conventional angle and square bracket notation to denote undotted
and dotted spinor contractions
⟨ϵiϵj⟩:= εαβϵα
i ϵβ
j ,
[˜ϵi˜ϵj] = ε ˙α ˙β˜ϵ ˙α
i ˜ϵ
˙β
j .
(2.10)
We will, for the most part use complexiﬁed polarization data as we will take our Maxwell 2-forms to
be simple and null, although momenta can be taken to be real. So the little group is the C∗subgroup
of the complexiﬁed Lorentz group that preserves the momentum and acts by rescaling κα and ˜κ ˙α. We
take polarization data for a Maxwell ﬁeld or gluon to be a null vector eµ that is null and orthogonal
to kµ.
Null simple 2-forms are then either self-dual or anti-self-dual given by Fµν = e[µkν] with
Fα ˙αβ ˙β = ϵαϵβε ˙α ˙β or its conjugate in terms of spinor-helicity data ϵα = ϵκα or ˜ϵ ˙α = ˜ϵ˜κ ˙α respectively.
Thus, polarization simply associates a scale to either κα or ˜κ ˙α.
In order to polarize the scattering equations, we can seek global meromorphic λ(σ)α and ˜λ(σ) ˙α
such that
P(σ)α ˙α = λ(σ)α˜λ(σ) ˙α .
(2.11)
The weights of λ(σ)α and ˜λ(σ) ˙α must add up to −2 to give P and we will take them each to take values
in O(−1). In 4d we have the freedom to let them take values in diﬀerent line bundles λα ∈Ω0(Σ, L),
˜λ ˙α ∈Ω0(Σ, ˜L) such that L ⊗˜L ∼= KΣ. While this set-up emerges naturally from the original twistor-
string and related models [3, 24, 25], the higher dimensional analogues of (2.11) will only make sense
when both spinors take values in O(−1), and so the 4d ambitwistor-string model [18] provides the
more natural starting point.
Amplitudes in the 4d ambitwistor string are localized on scattering equations that are reﬁned by
MHV degree as follows. Take k gluons i = 1, . . . , k to have negative helicity polarization ϵiα = ϵiκiα
and p = k + 1, . . . , n positive with polarization data ˜ϵi ˙α = ˜ϵi˜κi ˙α. The equations then incorporate the
polarization data via the following ans¨atze for λ(σ)α and ˜λ(σ) ˙α;
λ(σ)α =
k

i=1

σ −σi

˜λ(σ) ˙α =
n
X
p=k+1
ui˜ϵi ˙α

(2.12)
where the σi and ui are together determined by the polarized scattering equations

p = k + 1, . . . n −k,
ui˜λ(σi) ˙α = ˜κi ˙α
ϵi
,
i = 1, . . . , k .
(2.13)
It is easy to see that the σi satisfy the original scattering equations. In [18], these equations were
incorporated into a measure

(2.15)
The quotient by GL(2, C) removes the ﬁrst three dσi and one dui whilst introducing a factor of
σ12σ23σ13 but no delta functions are removed. The four-momentum conserving delta functions, do

not need to be inserted manually, as they are implied by the delta functions. This measure is related

(2.16)
Although this is clear from an indirect general argument as described in §6.2, we also give a detailed
proof there via 6d. Here the symmetric matrix Hk is deﬁned on each MHV sector by
Hk

i ≤k
−[˜ϵi˜λ(σi)]

(2.17)
with vanishing entries otherwise. It follows straightforwardly from (2.12) that H has a two-dimensional
kernel spanned by the vectors (u1, . . . , uk, 0, . . . , 0) and (0, . . . , 0, uk+1, . . . , un). Its reduced determi-
nant is deﬁned by
det ′Hk :=
det Hk[lm]
[ij]
uiujulum
(2.18)
where H[lm]
[ij]
is the matrix with rows i, j and columns l, m removed with l ≤k < m, i ≤k < j. We
remark that det ′Hk is supported on the sectors appropriate to Nk−2MHV degree2 [28]. The full (n−3)!
set of solutions to the scattering equations break up into the Nk−2MHV sectors with k = 2, . . . , n −2
with Eulerian number3 A(n −3, k −2) in each sector.
This reduced determinant plays a dual role in that it agrees with the CHY Pfaﬃan Pf′(M)
when the polarization data is restricted to the appropriate MHV degree. Thus, because (2.16) already
essentially contains one CHY Pfaﬃan, the integrand for Yang-Mills formula is simply the Parke-Taylor
factor and the one for gravity contains one additional copy of det ′(H).
These formulae directly extend to incorporate supersymmetry either by using chiral or anti-chiral
supermomenta. For super-Yang-Mills with N = 4 supersymmetries, our supermultiplets will be either
chiral or antichiral with the supermultiplet given by
(Fαβ, ψαI, ΦIJ , ψI

respectively where q3I = εIJ KLqJ qKqL/6 and q4 = q3IqI/4 etc.. These are obtained from each other by
ϵ = 1/˜ϵ and fermionic Fourier transform from qI to ˜qI. At N = 4 these multiplets are the same. For
N < 4 we can deﬁne them in an obvious way so as to be complementary.
To obtain supersymmetric formulae at Nk−2MHV, we partition {1, . . . , n} = Y ∪¯Y with |Y | = k
and particles i ∈Y in the ﬁrst representation and i ∈¯Y in the second and introduce the supersymmetry

Polarized scattering equations framework in 6 dimensions
We here recall basic deﬁnitions from [17].
Spinor helicity in 6d:
In six dimensions, vectors transform in the antisymmetric representation of
SL(4, C), the spin group of the Lorentz group Spin(6, C). Thus a 6-momentum can be expressed as
kAB = k[AB] = γAB
µ kµ, where A, B = 0, . . . , 3 are spinor indices and γAB
µ
are antisymmetric 4 × 4 Pauli
matrices, the chiral constituents of the γ-matrices satisfying the Cliﬀord algebra. The inner product
of vectors is deﬁned via the totally skew, SL(4)-invariant tensor 1
2εABCD, which is also used to raise
and lower skew pairs of spinor indices.
For massless particles, the little group is given by Spin(4, C) ∼= SL(2)×SL(2). Since null momenta
kAB with k2 = kABkCDεABCD = 0 are of rank two due to the antisymmetry of the spinor indices, the
on-shell condition can be solved by chiral (or antichiral) spinors [19],
kAB = ε˙a˙bκA
˙aκB
˙b ≡

κAκB
,
kAB = κa
Aκb
Bεab ≡⟨κAκB⟩.
(2.22)
Here, a = 0, 1, ˙a = ˙0, ˙1 are the corresponding SL(2, C) little group spinor indices, and we have
introduced the four-dimensional notation ⟨·, ·⟩and [·, ·] brackets now used to denote little group con-
tractions.
Polarization data is made up of representations of the little group. A Dirac particle has polarization
data ϵA = ϵaκa
A. A Maxwell ﬁeld strength is represented by F A
B , with F A
A = 0 because the Lie algebra
of the Lorentz group is sl(4). For a momentum eigenstate, with a null polarization vector orthogonal
to k, we ﬁnd
F A
B = ϵAϵB .
(2.23)
The Maxwell equations require kABϵA = 0 = kABϵB, so that all polarization data is encoded in little
group spinors ϵa and ϵ˙a with4
ϵA = ϵ˙aκA˙a ,
ϵA = ϵaκa
A .
(2.24)
6D polarized scattering equations:
Now in 6d, we can seek a spinor-helicity factorization for
P(σ) over CP1
PAB = λAaλa
B =
1
2εABCDλC
˙aλD ˙a .

there exists non zero (ua

EiA := uiaλa

(2.26)
This is scale invariant in u and v, so we can normalize
⟨viϵi⟩= 1 .

We introduce an analogue of (2.1) for λAa(σ)
λAa(σ) =
n
X
i=1
uiaϵiA
σ −σi
.
(2.28)
Together, (2.26), (2.27) and (2.28) will constitute the polarized scattering equations. One motivation
for this latter formula arises from a heuristic twistorial ambitwistor-string model that was presented
in [17].
These provide our 6D polarized version of the 4d polarized scattering equation (2.13) as equations
on the (σi, uia, via) that determine the (uia, via) on the support of a solution σi to the ordinary
scattering scattering equations. More explicitly we can write
EiA :=
X
j
⟨uiuj⟩ϵjA
σij
−⟨viκiA⟩= 0 .
(2.29)
We can eliminate the vi from these equations by skewing with ϵiA to get
ϵi[AEB]i :=
X
j
⟨uiuj⟩ϵj[BϵA]i
σij
−kiAB = 0 ,
(2.30)
which follows from the normalization condition on vi. Although these are 6 equations, skewing with
ϵiC vanishes identically by construction and there are only three independent equations per point that
serve to determine the uia and σi. Summing this version of the equations over i, the ﬁrst double sum
vanishes being antisymmetric over i, j, leaving the sum of momentum showing that these equations
imply momentum conservation.
Although as presented, the equations for uia appear nonlinear, later we will see that they are
underpinned by linear equations, and, in proposition 3.2, that there exists a unique solution to these
equations for each solution σi to the unpolarized scattering equation.5

however see that this measure is equal to the CHY measure in §3.2.

Supersymmetry in 6d
Here we review supersymmetry representations in 6d, in particular that in [17]. That representation
depends on individual solutions to the scattering equations, so we introduce a variant that maintains
the same simple structure, but that is global.

Supersymmetry representations in 6 dimensions have been explored in the context of scattering
ampitudes by a number of authors [19, 20, 29]. In six dimensions, (N, ˜N)-supersymmetry possesses an
Sp(N) × Sp( ˜N) R-symmetry group for which we introduce indices I = 1, . . . , 2N, and ˙I = ˙1, . . . ,
˙
2 ˜N.
On momentum eigenstates with momentum kAB, the supersymmetry generators QAI and QA
˙I satisfy,
temporarily suppressing the particle index i for readability,
{QAI, QBJ} = kAB ΩIJ,
{QA
˙I , QB
˙J } = kAB Ω˙I ˙J
(2.33)
where ΩIJ and Ω˙I ˙J are the R-symmetry symplectic metrics. The supersymmetry generators thus reduce
to the little group as
QAI = κa
AQaI ,
QA
˙I = κA
˙a Q˙a
˙I
(2.34)
where we now have
{QaI, QbJ} = εabΩIJ ,
{Q˙a ˙I, Q˙b ˙J} = ε˙a˙bΩ˙I ˙J .
(2.35)
Super Yang-Mills.
A key example is (1, 1) super Yang-Mills theory. The linearized ‘super-Maxwell’
multiplet is
F := (F B
A , ψA
I , ˜ψA ˙I, φI ˙I) ,
(2.36)
consisting of a 2-form curvature F B
A , spinors of each chirality ψA
I and ˜ψA ˙I and four scalars φI ˙I. On
momentum eigenstates with null momentum kAB, QCJ acts on this multiplet by
QCJF = (kACψB
J , ΩJIF A
C , kACφJ ˙I, ΩJI ˜ψ ˙IC) .
(2.37)
To construct a supersymmetry representation, we need to choose half of the QaI as anticommuting
supermomenta. The possibilities discussed in the literature [19, 20, 29] focus on halving either the I
or the a-indices manifesting only full little-group or only R-symmetry respectively. The former was
used successfully implemented in recent work on 6d scattering amplitudes for a variety of theories
[15, 16]. However, the latter is more natural from the perspective of the ambitwistor string [30], and
will be the formulation we work with here. The two approaches are of course related by appropriate
Grassmann Fourier transforms and we discuss the details of the R-symmetry breaking approach and
its correspondence with the little group breaking approach used in this section in §4.2.
For amplitudes in the representation (2.31) based on the polarized scattering equations, there is a
natural choice of supermomenta that manifests the full R-symmetry, because the polarized scattering
equations provide a natural basis (ϵa, va) of the little group space for each particle so that ϵaQpol
aI
anti-commute. They can therefore be represented as Fermionic variables
qI := ϵaQpol
aI .
(2.38)
This allows us to write the supersymmetry generators as
Qpol
aI =

vaqI + ϵaΩIJ
∂
∂qJ

,
˜Qpol ˙a
˙I
=

v ˙a˜q ˙I + ϵ˙a ˜Ω˙I ˙J
∂
∂˜q ˙J

.
(2.39)
The full super Yang-Mills multiplet is then obtained from the pure gluon state F(0, 0) = (ϵAϵB, 0, 0, 0)
as
Fpol(qI, ˜q ˙I) =
 (ϵA + q2⟨vκA⟩)(ϵB + ˜q2⟨vκB⟩), qI(ϵA + ˜q2⟨vκA⟩), ˜q ˙I(ϵA + q2⟨vκA⟩), qI ˜q ˙I

.
(2.40)
This gives a representation of the anti-commutation relations (2.35) such that the (1, 1)-super-Yang-
Mills superﬁeld becomes
ΦR
pol = gϵ˜ϵ + qI ψI˜ϵ + ˜q ˙J ˜ψϵ ˙J + q2gv˜ϵ + ˜q2gϵ˜v + qI ˜q ˙J φI ˙J + · · · + q2˜q2 gv˜v .
(2.41)
– 10 –

where gϵ˜ϵ = ϵa˜ϵ˙a ga˙a is the gluon with polarization ϵa˜ϵ˙a etc.
This explicit form of the multiplet
highlights one of the peculiar features of this supersymmetry representation: Since the supersymmetry
generators depend via v on the individual solutions to the polarized scattering equations, so do all
states in the bottom half of the multiplet, e.g. gv˜v or gv˜ϵ. The supersymmetry representation is thus
dynamic, not just particle-speciﬁc, and varies with the solution to the scattering equations, i.e., via is
not speciﬁed in advance, but depends on the momenta and polarization data and an individual solution
to the scattering equations. While any issues associated to this peculiarity can be easily avoided by
only calculating amplitudes with external states at the top of the multiplet,6 we prefer to work with
a global supersymmetry representation that can be introduced as follows.
The new representation.
Instead of using the basis (ϵa, va) of the little group introduced by the
polarized scattering equations (which depends on the solutions to the scattering equations), let us
choose a global basis for each particle
(ϵia, ξia) ,
with ⟨ξiϵi⟩= 1 .
(2.42)
Using this basis, ϵaQaI again anti-commute, and can be represented by Grassmann viariables qI =
ϵaQaI. However, the supersymmetry generators are now globally deﬁned,
QaI =

ξaqI + ϵaΩIJ
∂
∂qJ

,
˜Q˙a
˙I =

ξ ˙a˜q ˙I + ϵ˙a ˜Ω˙I ˙J
∂
∂˜q ˙J

.
(2.43)
Note that due to the normalization condition ⟨vϵ⟩= 1, we know that va and ξa are related by
va = ξa + ⟨ξv⟩ϵa .
(2.44)
This implies that the supersymmetry generators Qpol
aI and QaI are not related by a linear transforma-
tion of the respective supermomenta qI. Returning to the example of super Yang-Mills, the multiplet
now takes the form
F(qI, ˜q ˙I) =
 (ϵA + q2⟨ξκA⟩)(ϵB + ˜q2⟨ξκB⟩), qI(ϵA + ˜q2⟨ξκA⟩), ˜q ˙I(ϵA + q2⟨ξκA⟩), qI ˜q ˙I

,
(2.45)
and the (1, 1)-super-Yang-Mills superﬁeld becomes
ΦR = gϵ˜ϵ + qI ψI˜ϵ + ˜q ˙J ˜ψϵ ˙J + q2gξ˜ϵ + ˜q2gϵ˜ξ + qI ˜q ˙J φI ˙J + · · · + q2˜q2 gξ˜ξ .
(2.46)
where as above gϵ˜ϵ = ϵa˜ϵ˙a ga˙a denotes the gluon with polarization ϵa˜ϵ˙a. By construction, this represen-
tation is now global and independent of the solution to the polarized scattering equations. Of course,
this global deﬁnition comes at the expense of having to introduce an additional reference spinor ξa,
whereas the dynamic representation ΦR
pol only depends on a single choice of polarization spinor.
For the most part hereon, we will work in the global R-symmetry preserving representation ΦR.
However, it is easy to convert our formulae to the little-group preserving representation: for this we
break up QaI = (Ql
a, Qal, ) with l = 1, . . . , N so that ΩIJ =
 0
δl

and introduce supermomenta
ηal so that
QaI =

.
(2.47)
We explain the correspondence in more detail in 4.2 and give the alternative formulae below.
6 i.e. taking all gluons as gϵ˜ϵ, fermions as ψI˜ϵ or ˜ψϵ ˙J and scalars as φI ˙J. This can always be achieved by a choice of
polarization. Note in this context that the supermomenta themselves only depend on the ϵia from (2.38).

2.5
Integrands
Supersymmetry determines the full super-amplitude from the amplitudes involving only the top of
the multiplet.
We will see in §4.2 that superysmmetry implies that the total dependence on the
supermomenta is encoded in the exponential factor eF , with F = FN + ˜F ˜N where7

For example for N = (1, 1) super Yang-Mills we take the exponential factor exp F YM = exp(F1 + ˜F1).
In the dynamic R-symmetry preserving representations (2.41) as used in [17], we only keep the F pol
N
terms in the exponential, eF pol with F = F pol
N
+ ˜F pol
˜N . Alternatively, we can Fourier transform in half
the fermionic variables to make contact with the little-group-preserving representation of Refs. [15, 16]
as given in (2.47). To do so, we choose an explicit oﬀ-diagonal representation for the R-symmetry
metric, decompose the fermionic variables qI =

transform one of these half-dimensional fermionic subspaces,

On the right, we have relabeled ql = ηϵl := ⟨ϵηl⟩, and grouped the fermionic variables into a little-group
spinor ηl
a. In this representation, the fermionic delta-functions take the same form as the polarized
scattering equations with ηal replacing κaA, and we deﬁne dµpol|N+ ˜

to be the measure obtained by
combining the fermionic delta functions (2.49) into dµpol

This gives our formulae for superamplitudes from the formulae for the top states of the supermultiplets.

On the polarized scattering equations, the determinant det H vanishes because H has co-rank 2
due to
X
i
uiaHij = λaA(σj)ϵA
j + ujaHjj = 0 .
(2.53)
The ﬁrst term follows from the deﬁnition (2.28) of λaA and the second equality from (2.52). Similarly,
P
j Hijuj ˙a = 0. These identities nevertheless imply that H has a well deﬁned reduced determinant
det ′H :=
det(H[i1i2]
[j1j2])
⟨ui1ui2⟩[uj1uj2] .
(2.54)
Here H[i1j1]
[i2j3] denotes the matrix H with the rows i1, i2 and columns j1, j2 deleted, and det ′H is
well-deﬁned in the sense that the (2.54) is invariant under permutations of particle labels, and thus
independent of the choice of i1,2, j1,2, see §4.1 for the proof.
The reduced determinant det ′H is manifestly gauge invariant in all particles, carries SL(2, C)σ
weight −2, as expected for a half-integrand Ispin−1 and is equally valid for even and odd numbers of
external particles. On the support of the polarized scattering equations, it is veriﬁed using factorization
in §7.2 that det ′H is equal to the CHY half-integrand Pf ′M.
Another important building block, relevant for the D5 and M5 theory, is the skew matrix A,
familiar from the CHY formulae [7, 31], with
Aij = ki · kj
σij
.
(2.55)
Again, the Pfaﬃan PfA vanishes on the scattering equations (2.2), but the reduced Pfaﬃan Pf′A =
(−1)i+j
σij
PfAij
ij is well-deﬁned and non-zero for even numbers of particles [7, 31].
The ﬁnal ingredients are constructed from (σi, uia, ˜ui˙a), and are only needed for M5-branes. These
only lead to amplitudes with even numbers of particles. We present a formulation pointed out by [21]
using [32], giving a useful alternative formulation to that in [17], the connections to which we discuss
in §4.3. Deﬁne the family of matrices U (a,b) by
U (a,b)
ij
= ⟨uiuj⟩a [˜ui˜uj]b
σij
.
(2.56)
In fact we will only need U (2,0) and U (0,2) although for even numbers of particles we have the identity
det ′H =
Pf′ A
Pf U (1,1) ,
(2.57)
allowing for the use of U (1,1) according to taste.
With these ingredients, we have the following integrands of various supersymmetric theories as
follows
(1,1)-Super Yang-Mills:
PT(α) det ′H eF1+ ˜
F1
(2.58a)
(2,2)-Supergravity:

The resulting superamplitudes are SL(2, C)σ × SL(2, C)± invariant, the super Yang-Mills and super-
gravity amplitudes are gauge invariant, and the supergravity amplitudes are permutation invariant.
We also see colour-kinematics duality expressed in the form of the super Yang-Mills and supergravity
amplitudes. The M5 amplitudes are manifestly chiral.
The integrands used here improve the formulae in [17] by having a static, ﬁxed once and for all
supersymmetry representation. We have furthermore replaced the determinants of n/2 × n/2 blocks
of U-matrices with manifestly permutation invariant Pfaﬃans. These integrands are quite diﬀerent
from those of [16], not only in the supersymmetry representation, but also in the Pfaﬃans of our U
matrices and our spinorially constructed det ′H replaces the CHY Pfaﬃans.
The main result of this paper, expressed and proved in detail in §7, is:
Theorem 1 The amplitude formulae (2.31) with integrands (2.58) all factorize correctly. There exists
good BCFW shifts for the gauge and gravity formulae so that their equivalence with the corresponding
tree-level S-matrices is guaranteed by recursion and the three-point examples of §5.
We will see later explicitly that these formulae all correctly reproduce the known three- and four- point
amplitudes. We will see further that the supergravity and super Yang-Mills amplitudes reduce to the
four-dimensional expressions given in terms of the four-dimensional polarized scattering equations
above.
2.6
The double copy and Gerbe-theories.
As remarked in [17], our half-integrands provide a double-copy matrix of theories given in terms of
the improved half-integrands of this paper in the ﬁrst four columns of table 1 below. This table is
analogous to those obtained in [13, 31] in the CHY and RNS ambitwistor-string framework and the
entries provide nodes in the web of theories of [33]. The table contains the amplitude formulae for the
theories described above, but the last column also gives three expressions that may not correspond to
an amplitude in a well-deﬁned theory. Analogous formulae were also found in the framework of [16].
A key feature of this last column is that is provides amplitude-like formulae of the type that might
arise for theories that contain Gerbes in their linear multiplets. Gerbes are closed self-dual 3-forms and
correspond to ﬁelds BAB = B(AB) in spinors. The spin-2 analogues have spinors ψA
BCD for (3, 1) and
ψABCD for (4, 0) in their linear multiplets (whereas the spinor corresponding to the Weyl tensor of a
genuine gravitational ﬁeld is the trace-free symmetric spinor ΨCD
AB). See [34–37] for further discussion
of these spin-2 linear ﬁelds and their possible links with interesting interacting theories.

The example that may be of most interest in this column is the ‘(2, 0)-PT formula’, obtained from
combining the M5 half-integrand Pf ′A det X eF2/Pf U (2,0) with a Parke-Taylor factor, i.e. replacing
– 14 –

the det ′A of the M5-integrand by a Parke-Taylor half-integrand. This leads to an expression with
a non-abelian structure and N = (2, 0) supersymmetry.
While this formula may seem suggestive
of amplitudes for the famous (2, 0)-theory arising from coincident M5-branes, this is certainly too
simplistic, because that theory lacks a perturbative parameter and thus has no S-matrix.8 Ref. [16]
have further shown that the equivalent four-particle expression in their framework factorizes into
non-local three-particle formulae that are not even well-deﬁned, 9 and thus cannot be interpreted as
amplitudes. Moreover, the formulae in the right-hand column are not obviously deﬁned for an odd
number of particles. The (2, 0)-M5 theory is not expected to have amplitudes for odd numbers of
particles, but that is already guaranteed by the additional det ′A factor which, being the determinant
of a skew matrix, automatically vanishes for odd n. However, for the other factor we have no analogue
of (2.57) to provide a meaning for odd n. This issue may well be connected to the diﬃculties in
deﬁning three-particle extensions for the (2, 0)-PT mentioned above and discussed in [16].
Despite these diﬃculties in identifying underlying theories for these formulae, they are all well-
deﬁned and manifestly chiral and supersymmetric, and we discuss them further in §8.
Further theories, (2,0) supergravity.
Our matrix in table 1 can be extended further using the
half-integrands from [13, 31] to give potentially supersymmetric 6d versions of the theories discussed
there. Further half-integrands in [39, 40] will give further potentially supersymmetric formulae for the
higher order theories treated there.
This larger matrix will by no means be exhaustive and many further theories can be constructed
by stripping out some of the supersymmetry and adjoining fewer or more ﬁelds than are present in
the maximally supersymmetric multiplet. This yields further half-integrands and theories. In many
settings the correct couplings will then be ensured from the original supersymmetric theory. We give
an example that follows the analysis of Heydeman et al. [41]. In the context of their 6d framework,
they extract all chiral N = (2, 0) 6d supergravity amplitudes together with the abelian (2, 0) tensor
multiplets from the known formulae for N = (2, 2) supergravity. The number of tensor multiplets
can then be changed with impunity. If there are 21 of them, this leads to anomaly cancellation and a
correspondence with a K3 reduction of type IIB string theory.
The (2, 2) supergravity multiplet can be regarded as the tensor product of the (2, 0) multiplet
with the (0, 2) multiplet. The latter consists of ﬁelds (BAB, ΨA
˙I , φ ˙I ˙J) with φ ˙I ˙JΩ
˙I ˙J = 0 so that there are
only 5 scalars. This can be truncated to throw out the ΨA
˙I and the number of scalars can be reduced
or increased. In the tensor product with the (2, 0) multiplet, the scalars correspond to (2, 0) abelian
tensor multiplets. With just one ﬂavour of (2, 0) abelian tensor multiplet embedded into the (2, 2)
multiplet (together with the (2, 0) gravity), integrating out the (0, 2) part of the supersymmetry from
the (2, 2) formula yields, with m abelian multiplets and n graviton multiplets

into which the ﬂavour vectors of the m abelian tensor multiplets can be contracted before taking the
determinant in (2.59).
We remark that this formula superﬁcially contains more polarization data than expected for the
m abelian tensor multiplets as it contains an ϵA in addition to the ϵA for each tensor multiplet, coming
from the (n + m) × (n + m) reduced determinant det′ H. However, it will be seen in §4.4 that these
expressions are independent of the spurious ϵA as they should be.

Polarized scattering equations and measure
In this section we prove various statements made in the introduction. We ﬁrst give an alternative form
of the scattering equations that manifests that the scattering equations imply momentum conservation.
In §3.1 we prove the existence and uniqueness for solutions to the polarized scattering equations given
an initial solution to the scattering equations. Underlying this is a linear formulation of the polarized
scattering equations that we make explicit in §3.1.1. This is not used explicitly in what follows and can
be omitted by a casual reader. The ﬁnal subsection §3.2 proves that the polarized scattering equations
measure is equivalent to the standard CHY measure.
We ﬁrst recall the form of the polarized scattering equations in which we eliminate the via by
skew-symmetrizing the ith polarized scattering equation with ϵiA to obtain
ϵi[A]EB]i = ϵi[A⟨uiλB](σi)⟩+ kiAB =

When the scattering equations are not imposed, although the residue of ResσiP(σ) is no longer

Linear form of equations, and existence and uniqueness of solutions
In this subsection we prove existence and uniqueness using algebreo-geometric arguments. We deﬁne
the bundle over CP1 in which λaA, a = 0, 1, takes its values to show that it is a rank-two bundle with
canonically deﬁned skew form, and so generically has a pair of sections that can be normalized.
We work with bundles on CP1 which will be direct sums of line bundles O(n) whose sections can
be represented in terms of homogeneous functions of degree n in terms of homogeneous coordinates
σα, α = 0, 1 on CP1 with skew inner product (σiσj) := σi0σj1 −σi1σj0. We prove:
Proposition 3.2 For each solution {σi} to the scattering equations and compatible polarization data
in general position, there exists a unique solution to the polarized scattering equations (2.26), (2.27)
and (2.28) up to a global action of SL(2, C) on the little-group index.
Proof: Let P AB(σ) arise from the given solution to the scattering equations as the spinor form of
(2.1). To remove the poles, deﬁne Π(σ)AB := P AB Q(σσi) which is now holomorphic object of weight
n −2 on CP1 and is a null 6-vector so as a skew matrix has rank 2 on CP1 (for momentum and σi in
general position it will be vanishing on CP1).
We require λaAP AB = 0 for a = 0, 1 so to study solutions to this equation, deﬁne the rank-2
bundle E = ker P ⊂SA on CP1 where SA is the rank four trivial bundle of spinors over CP1. To
calculate the number of sections we wish to compute the degree of this bundle. To do so consider the
short exact sequence
0 −→E −→SA −→E0(n −2) −→0 ,
(3.6)
where the second map is multiplication by Π(σ)AB and E0(n −2) ⊂SA(n −2) is the annihilator of E
twisted by O(n −2), that being the weight of ΠAB. In such a short exact sequence the degree of §A is
the sum of that of E and E0(n −2) since the degree is the winding number of the determinant of the
patching function, and the maps of the exact sequence determine these up to upper triangular terms
that dont contribute to the determinant. Since SA is trivial, it has degree 0, so we ﬁnd
deg E + deg E0 + 2(n −2) = 0 .
(3.7)
Because E0 = (S/E)∗and S is trivial, we have deg E0 = deg E so this gives deg E = 2 −n.
Now ΛaA := λaA
Q(σσi) is a section of E(n −1) which by the above has degree n. Our ΛaA
is subject to the n conditions, one at each marked point, as we impose ΛaA|σ=σj ∝ϵjA. This has
the eﬀect of deﬁning a subbundle with a reduction of degree by 1 at each marked point, so the total
degree is now zero. Thus this subbundle therefore has degree zero. For data in general position, it will
therefore be trivial with a two-dimensional family of sections spanned by ΛaA, a = 0, 1. These can be
normalized because Λ0[AΛ1B] = fΠAB where f is a holomorphic function of the sphere of weight n.
The conditions on ΛaA at σi imply that f vanishes at each σi so f = c Q
i(σ σi) and we can normalize
our sections so that c = 1 reducing the freedom in the choiced of frame ΛaA to SL(2). On dividing

i(σ σi)2 we obtain PAB = λaAλa

3.1.1
An explicit linear version of the polarized scattering equations
This is not essential to the logical structure of the paper and can be omitted by the casual reader.
However, the above argument is rather abstract and it is helpful to see explicitly at least the underlying
linearity of the problem of solving the polarized scattering equations. However we have not been able
to give explicit versions of all the algebreo geometric proofs above.
According to the above, we are trying to ﬁnd a pair of solutions λaA, a = 1, 2 to the equations
P(σ)ABλB(σ) = 0 ,
(3.9)
where λA(σ) has projective weight −1 in σ and P weight −2. The argument above gives λA
Q(σσi)
as a section of E(n −1) which has degree n and rank 2 so generically has n + 2 global sections. To
make this more explicit, make the ansatz10
λA =
X
i
uiaiκai
A
(σσi) ,
(3.10)
which removes double poles from (3.9). Given that the total weight of (3.9) is negative, it will be
satisﬁed if the residues at its poles vanish. The vanishing of the residue at σi yields

Now deﬁne pa˙a

after solving the CHY scattering equations (2.2) by
P AB(σi)κa
iA = κB
i˙apa˙a

.
(3.12)
This makes sense at σi as κa
iA annihilates the pole, and a second contraction with κb
iB leads to zero as
it gives ki · P, so it must be a multiple of κB
i˙a. We can understand this also by considering the 2-form
P(σi) ∧ki which in spinors gives, using the above,

using eiAB = ϵi[A˜ϵB]i where ˜ϵAκAB

10We attach the additional i-index to ai here to distinguish this uaii from the uia in the original ansatz for λAa; the
ai is a little group index associated to momentum ki rather than the global one associated to λAa. We will drop these
sub-indices when the equations are unambiguous.

(3.16)
The discussion of the previous subsection implies that generically these equations have n+2 solutions.
These equations reduce to the original polarized scattering equations if we supplement them with n
further equations ⟨ϵjuj⟩= 0, since we will then have uajj = ϵjajuj as in the original ansatz (2.28). We
then expect to ﬁnd a pair of linearly independent solutions uia, with a = 1, 2 now global little group
indices, so that we now have
ua
aii = ϵiaiua
i .
(3.17)
In order to normalize these solutions, observe that for a pair of solutions λ1
A, λ2
A to (3.9), we must have
that
λ1
[Aλ2
B] = fPAB
(3.18)
for some meromorphic function f on CP1 with poles at the σi. However, when we impose (3.17),
the double poles in (3.18) vanish and f must be constant, so we can normalize the pair of solutions
ua
i so that the coeﬃcient is 1. The full n + 2-dimensional space of solutions also has a volume form
determined by (3.18).
In general (3.16) are 2n-equations on 2n-unknowns, so we must have n + 2 relations to agree with
the discussion of the previous subsection and to allow us to impose these extra n conditions. The
relations follow from the original equation (3.9) and the nilpotency P ABPBC = 0 that follows from the
original scattering equations. This leads to the nilpotency

with EA := ⟨uλA⟩−⟨vκA⟩.
(3.23)

uai = κiaA(W A

After integrating out the four components of (ua, vb), we are left with a single delta-function on both
sides of the equation. It is easy to see that they have the same support as the latter delta function on
the left implies that va ̸= 0, but this can only be true when (λa

happens iﬀεABCDλ0

A systematic proof uses a basis with ϵa = (0, 1), κ0

4 = 1 and all other components zero. This
allows us to integrate out the va directly against the delta functions reducing the right side to

(3.24)
where the latter equality follows by direct calculation integrating out the ua; this gives (3.23) in this
basis.
The CHY measure is deﬁned to be

where K = P
i ki, the volume of SL(2, C)σ quotients by the M¨obius invariance of σ, and the C3

(3.26)
where SL(2, C)σ denotes M¨obius invariance of σ as above in the CHY measure, the SL(2, C)u is acting
on the little group index of ua, and the integrals are over the (ui, vi) variables.
Proof: We ﬁrst reduce the SL(2, C)σ factor ﬁxing (σ1, σ2, σ3) to be constant with the standard

We can trivially perform one of each of the vi integrals against the δ(⟨viϵi⟩−1) delta functions by
choosing a basis of the little group spin space for each i so that ϵia = (1, 0) ﬁxing va
i = (vi, 1).
Choosing a basis of spin space consisting of {ϵiA, ϵ0A} with i = 1, 2, 3 and ϵ0A chosen so that
⟨0123⟩= 1, and dual basis ˜ϵA
i , i =, 0, . . . , 3 we ﬁnd via (3.30)
K0i = Ei0 ,
Kij = E[ij] ,
(3.31)
so that these polarized scattering equations can be replaced by δ6(K).
The remaining scattering
equations in Q3

E(ij) =
( uij
σij + . . .
i ̸= j
vi + . . . ,
i = j
(3.32)
where the . . . denotes terms involving i, j > 3. Thus we can integrate out duij and dvi against these
remaining polarized scattering equation delta functions δ(E(ij)) for i, j ≤3 yielding an extra numerator
factor of σ12σ23σ13.
Finally we can use (3.23) to replace the remaining polarized scattering equations delta functions
by standard ones thus yielding the desired formula.

Integrands
In this section, we discuss the integrands In and the supersymmetry representation in more detail.
We ﬁrst show that the spin-one contribution det ′H is permutation invariant, and that it is equivalent
to the CHY pfaﬃan Pf′M in providing the correct dependence on the spin-one polarization data.
We move on to giving further details of the supersymmetry factors and of the ingredients required
for brane theories. Finally, we prove crucial properties such as linearity of the spin-one contribution
in the polarization data, and the compatibility of the reduced determinant with the supersymmetry
representation.
4.1
The kinematic reduced determinant det ′H.
For our ambidextrous spin one contribution, recall that we deﬁned an n × n matrix H by
Hij =



ϵiAϵA
j
σij
i ̸= j
ei · P(σi) ,
i = j
,
(4.1)
where ei is the null polarization vector above and P(σ) is as deﬁned in (2.1). We ﬁrst prove the
equivalence between this deﬁnition of Hii and that in (2.52). In order to use the vector representation
of the polarization vector, we introduce a spinor ˜ϵA so that ϵA = kAB˜ϵB. Then the polarization vector
is eAB = ϵ[A˜ϵB]. The equivalent deﬁnition of Hii (2.52) is
λaA(σi)ϵA
i = −uiaHii ,
λ˙aA(σi)ϵiA = −u˙a
i Hii .
(4.2)
The left side is a multiple of uia (or u˙a
i ) due to the scattering equation and the identity kABκa
A = 0.
Starting from the second last formula we obtain the ﬁrst from
ei · P(σi) = ϵ[A˜ϵB]λaA(σi)λa
B(σi) = −Hii˜ϵBuaλa
B(σi) = −Hii˜ϵBvaκa
B = −Hii .
(4.3)
– 21 –

This then, being neither chiral nor antichiral justiﬁes the equivalence.
The matrix Hij is not full rank because
X
i
uiaHij = λaA(σj)ϵA
j + ujaHjj = 0 ,
(4.4)
and so, as above, we deﬁne the generalized determinant
det ′(H) : =
det(H[ij])
⟨uiuj⟩[uiuj] =
det(H[i1i2]
[j1j2])
⟨ui1ui2⟩[uj1uj2]
(4.5)
where H[ij] denotes the matrix H with the ij rows and columns deleted and H[i1i2]
[j1j2] the matrix with
the with rows i1, i2 and columns j1, j2 removed. These are well-deﬁned as
Lemma 4.1 The generalized determinant deﬁned above is permutation invariant.
Proof: We can extend the argument of appendix A of [26] on such generalized determinants as follows.
Consider an n×n matrix Hj
i with a p-dimensional kernel and cokernel, i.e., that satisﬁes P
i wi
aHj
i =
0 and P
j Hj
i ˜wb
j = 0 where a, b = 1, . . . , p. We must also assume that there are volume p-forms on these
kernels, ⟨w1 . . . wp⟩and [ ˜w1, . . . ˜wp]. Our reduced determinant can be understood as the determinant
of the exact sequence
0 →Cp
˜
w→Cn H
→Cn w→Cp →0 .
(4.6)
To make this explicit, note that we have
εj1...jnεi1...inHjp+1
ip+1 . . . Hjn
in ⟨w1 . . . wp⟩⟨˜w1 . . . ˜wp⟩= det ′(H)w[i1
1 . . . wip]
p ˜w1
[j1 . . . ˜wp
jp]
(4.7)
for some det′(H). This formula follows because skew symmetrizing a free index on the left with a wr
or ˜wr vanishes as it dualizes via the ε to contraction with Hj
i . Thus it must be a multiple of the right
hand side as deﬁned. The deﬁnitions (4.5), (2.54) then follow by taking components of this deﬁnition
in the case p = 2 on the i1, i2, j1, j2 indices. In our context the natural volume form on the kernel is
deﬁned on the 2-dimensional space of uiai = uiϵai by the f on the right hand side of (3.18) but for our
polarized scattering equation framework, the normalizations are such that this is 1 so the bracketed
terms on the left of (4.7) reduce to unity in (4.5).
□
Note that the ﬁrst term on the left side of (4.7) is simply the pth derivative of det H where we have
to relax the scattering equations and momentum conservation to make the determinant not identically
zero. The CHY matrix is also non-degenerate away from the support of the scattering equations and
momentum conservation. We have
Proposition 4.1 The determinant is related to the full CHY Paﬃan by det(H) = Pf M.
Proof: We use the form of the CHY Pfaﬃan due to Lam & Yao [42]. They show that the full Pfaﬃan
of M can be expanded into a sum over the permutations ρ ∈Sn of the particle labels,
Pf

where each term has been decomposed into the disjoint cycles I = (i1 . . . iI), J = (j1 . . . jJ) of the
permutation ρ. The terms in this cycle expansion are given by
MI =

Cii

(4.9)
and σI =

−1 denotes the Parke-Taylor factor associated to the cycle.
Euler’s formula for the determinant of H similarly gives
det(H) =

(4.10)
where the terms HI are given by
HI = Hi1i2...HiIi1 =
( tr(Fi1...FiI )
σI

Hii
if I = {i} ,
.
(4.11)
Here the trace over the Fs is taken in the spin representation and we have Cii = Hii hence the equiv-
alence.
□
This result provides some circumstantial evidence that Pf′M = det′ H on the support of the
scattering equations, but we do not have a direct proof. We prove this only indirectly via factorization
in §7.2. Our det′ H can therefore be used as a half-integrand in place of Pf′(M) in the theories as
described in [31] to give full integrands

(4.14)
Superamplitudes must be supersymetrically invariant and so are annihilated by the total QAI and
indeed this determines the amplitude for the whole multiplet from the amplitudes involving only the
top of the multiplets.
– 23 –

It is easily veriﬁed that the supersymmetry factors give an amplitude that is supersymetrically
invariant, since
QAI eFN =

(4.15)
and similarly QA
˙I eF = 0.
Here, the second equality follows from vi = ξi + ⟨ξivi⟩ϵi, and the sum
vanishes on the support of the polarized scattering equations. Conversely, given an integrand In for
the top states of a multiplet, (2.50) is the unique supersymmetric completion using the supersymmetry
representation (2.43), as can be veriﬁed using supersymmetric Ward identities.
The little-group preserving supersymmetry representation.
In six dimensions, amplitudes
can alternatively be written in a supersymmetry representation that breaks R-symmetry, but preserves
little group symmetry. We construct this representation by choosing an N-dimensional subspace on
which ΩIJ vanishes indexed by l, m = 1 . . . N so that aI = (al, al) with ΩIJaIbJ = albl −blal. Then
QI
A = (Ql
A, QAl) = κa
A(Ql

(4.16)
satisfying
{Ql
a, Qm
b } = 0 = {Qal, Qbm} ,
{Qal, Qm
b } = ϵabδm
l ,
(4.17)
with similar relations for QA ˙I = (QAl, QA
l ) = κA
˙a(Q˙al, Q˙a
l ). Thus we can introduce supermomenta ηla
as fermionic eigenvalues of Qla so that our supermomentum eigenstates satisfy
Qlaφ = ηlaφ ,
Qlaφ = ∂φ
∂ηla
,
˜Ql ˙aφ = ˜ηl ˙aφ ,
˜Ql ˙aφ = ∂φ
∂˜ηl ˙a
.
(4.18)
This clearly gives a representation of (4.17). For N = (1, 1) super Yang-Mills, we can replace the
l-index by ‘1’ when l = 1 is an upper index and ‘2’ when l is a lower index to ﬁnd
ΦLG = φ1˙1 + ηaψa˙1 + ˜η˙a ˜ψ1˙a + ηa˜η˙aAa˙a + η2φ2˙1 + ˜η2φ1˙2 + · · · + η2˜η2φ2˙2 ,
(4.19)
for the R-symmetry breaking representation.13
Fermionic Fourier transform.
The sets of supermomenta from the R-symmetry preserving rep-
resenting are related to those above by decomposing qI = (ql, ql) and observing that the deﬁnitions
allow us to identify
η1l := ηϵl = ϵaηal = ql ,
η2l := ηξl = ξaηal = ∂
∂ql .
(4.20)
The latter relation implies a fermionic half-Fourier transform on the supermultiplets written for general
(N, ˜N) as

As discussed in section 2.5, we can implement the fermionic half-Fourier transform at the level of the
amplitudes. Starting from the exponential (R-symmetry preserving) representation, we ﬁnd that the
supersymmetry factors turn into delta-functions that mimic the polarized scattering equations,

the measure, dµpol|N+ ˜

. We remark that in this delta-function representation of
the superamplitude, all components are monomials in the Grassmann variables η, and the all-gluon
amplitude sits in the middle of the multiplet (4.19). It is straightforward to check that we recover the
integrand det ′H of the gluon amplitude in the top state by extracting the component proportional to
Q
i⟨viηi⟩[˜vi˜ηi].
We can also verify directly that the supersymmetry factors ∆0|N
n
are invariant under supersym-
metry, and that superamplitudes in the delta-function representation are annihilated by the super-

M5 and D5 theories
We ﬁrst recall the ingredients for D5 and M5-branes. These are supersymmetric theories that share
a scalar sector with Lagrangian of the form L ∼
p
−det(ηµν + k P
r ∂µφr∂νφr).
For D5 branes
r = 1, . . . , 4 and for M5 branes r = 1, . . . , 5 thought of as transverse coordinates to 6d worldvolumes in
10d or 11d respectively. D5-branes are naturally completed with (1, 1)-supersymmetry, and M5 with
(2, 0)-supersymmetry. In the case of D5-branes, the linearised multiplet then coincides with the (1, 1)
super-Maxwell multiplet (2.36). The Lagrangian for the bosonic parts of the multiplet extends the
Born-Infeld action to give
L ∼
s
−det(ηµν + k

∂µφr∂νφr + κFµν).
For M5 branes, the (2, 0) supermultiplet is (GAB, ψIA, φIJ) with φIJ = φ[IJ] and φIJΩIJ = 0. Here
the spinor GAB = G(AB) corresponds to a self-dual 3-form whose linearized equations are that it
– 25 –

should be closed (and hence co-closed by self-duality). Such a ﬁeld is known as a Gerbe, often thought
of as a curvature associated to a 2-form potential BB
A. See [43] for a modern review.
There are CHY formulae [31] for the bosonic brane theories with any number of scalars, and
further including the Born-Infeld contribution. As in [17], we follow the strategy in [15] that obtains
full superamplitudes for D5 and M5 theories by incorporating supersymmetry factors on top of these
CHY formulae for scalar amplitudes. This makes use of the fact that both theories share an SU(2)
subsector of the scalars. The full supersymmetric amplitudes can then be reconstructed from the known
scalar amplitudes in this sector by applying supersymmetry. We go on to explain their relationship
with the half-integrands (2.56) given in the introduction.
The D5 integrand.
The bosonic part of this is well-known from [31] in the original CHY-format,
where it takes the form ID5 = det ′A Pf ′M. Substituting the spin-one half-integrand in the 6d spinor-
helicity formalism, and inserting the correct supersymmetry factors immediately gives the 6d integrand
ID5 = det ′A det ′H eF1+ ˜
F1 ,
(4.25)
of the full superamplitudes. We can now extract the shared subsector of scalar amplitudes from this
D5 integrand by a suitable integration over the super momenta qI, ˜q ˙I. For an all-scalar amplitude
where we scatter generic scalars φJi ˙Ji
i
, the integrand takes the form
IJ1 ˙J1...Jn ˙Jn
D5

i=1
d2qi d2˜qi qJi
i ˜q
˙Ji
i ID5 = det ′A det ′H (Pf U)
J1...Jn (Pf ˜U)
˙J1... ˙Jn .
(4.26)
Here, U and ˜U are n × n matrices carrying the R-symmetry indices of the scalars, with entries
U
JiJj
ij
= ⟨uiuj⟩
σij
ΩJiJj ,
˜U
˙Ji ˙Jj
ij

σij
Ω
˙Ji ˙Jj ,
(4.27)
and Pf U and Pf ˜U are deﬁned by specifying the R-symmetry indices, and then taking the Pfaﬃan as
usual. To construct the M5 integrand, we further have to restrict this amplitude to the shared SU(2)
scalar subsector between M5 and D5 theory, which is the subspace of non-self-interacting scalars of the
respective theories. This sector can be constructed along similar lines to the discussion in §4.2. Let us
choose again an N-dimensional subspace of the supersymmetry generators on which the metric ΩIJ
vanishes, indexed by aI = (al, al) with ΩIJaIbJ = albl −blal. From this we can directly construct two
non-self-interacting scalar subsectors, Y = {φl˙l} and Y = {φl˙l} for D5, and Y = {φlm} and Y = {φlm}
for M5. Any other non-self-interacting subsector is related to Y and Y by an SU(2) transformation.
Note that each of the non-self-interacting subsectors contains exactly one scalar state; this is obvious
for D5, where φl˙l = φ1˙1
LG and φl˙l = φ2˙2
LG in the notation of the last section, and for M5 theory this
follows from the antisymmetry constraint on the scalar indices, φIJ = −φJI. Moreover, amplitudes in
this SU(2) subsector are non-trivial, as long as n/2 of the scalars are in Y , and the other n/2 in Y .
This is most easily seen in the R-symmetry breaking representation, where the multiplets take the
form
ΦLG
D5 = φ1˙1
LG + ηaψa˙1 + ˜η˙a ˜ψ1˙a + ηa˜η˙aAa˙a + η2φ2˙1
LG + ˜η2φ1˙2
LG + · · · + η2˜η2φ2˙2
LG ,
(4.28a)
ΦLG
M5 = φLG + ηalψal + εlmηalηbm Bab + ηalηa
m φlm
LG + (η3)al ˜ψal + η4 ˜φLG ,
(4.28b)
with φLG = φlm, ˜φLG = φlm and φlm
LG = εmnφln in the M5 multiplet. In this representation, amplitudes
are monomials of degree 2n in the fermionic variables, so scalar amplitudes from the SU(2) subsector
are generically non-trivial when n/2 particles are in Y , as claimed above.
– 26 –

Using this construction, we can restrict the generic scalar amplitudes of (4.26) to the SU(2)
subsector with |Y | = |Y | = n/2. The matrices U and ˜U then take the form
U =

0
UY
−U T
Y

˜U =

(4.29)
where UY and ˜UY are n/2 × n/2 matrices with entries UY ip = U (1,0)
ip
and ˜UY ip = U (0,1)
ip
for for i ∈Y
and p ∈Y . In this SU(2) scalar subsector, the scalar D5 amplitudes are thus given by
ISU(2)
D5
= det ′A det ′H det UY det ˜UY .
(4.30)
We can compare this to the same scalar subsector in the CHY formalism [31], where the integrand is
given by ISU(2)
D5
= (Pf ′A)3 det XY . Here, XY is an n/2 × n/2 matrix with entries XY ip = σ−1
ip , again
with for i ∈Y and p ∈Y . This gives the identity
det XY
det UY det ˜UY
Pf ′A = det ′H .
(4.31)
The M5 integrand.
As discussed above, the scalar amplitudes (4.30) are the same in both the
M5 and D5 theory. Supersymmetry then uniquely determines the M5 integrand IM5
n
from this SU(2)
scalar subsector as follows. Consider the following generic ansatz for the M5 superamplitude,
AM5
n
=
Z
dµpol
n
IM5 eF2 .
(4.32)
By integrating over suitable supermomenta qI, we can again extract the SU(2) scalar sector, and a
similar calculation to the above D5 case gives
ISU(2)
M5
= IM5 det 2UY .
(4.33)
There is no contribution of the local terms −1
2
P
i⟨ξivi⟩q2
i ⊂F2 in the exponential because the scalars
obey ΩIJφIJ = 0. As discussed above, the amplitudes (4.33) in the SU(2) scalar subsector have to
agree with the D5 case (4.30), which uniquely determines the M5 integrand to be
IM5 = det ′A det ′H det ˜UY
det UY
= (Pf ′A)3 det XY
det 2UY
,
(4.34)
where the second equality follows from (4.31).
While this gives a valid formula for the M5 integrand, it obscures the permutation invariance of
the Gerbe amplitudes, because the integrand superﬁcially seems to depend on Y . However, it turns
out that all of the combinations
det ˜UY
det UY
,
det XY
det 2UY
,
det XY
det UY det ˜UY
,
(4.35)
are in fact permutation invariant, and in particular independent of the choice of Y .
This can be
made manifest, as pointed out in [21], by using results ﬁrst derived in [32] relating the above ratios to
Pfaﬃans of a family of matrices U (a,b), deﬁned as before by
U (a,b)
ij
= ⟨uiuj⟩a [˜ui˜uj]b
σij
.
(4.36)
– 27 –

The main theorem we will need here, derived in [32], gives a fundamental identity for the splitting of
the Pfaﬃan Pf U (a,b) into two determinants,
Pf U (a,b) = det U (a1,b1)
Y1
VY1VY 1
det U (a2,b2)
Y2
VY2VY 2
V ,
with a = a1 + a2 , b = b1 + b2 .
(4.37)
Here, V denotes the Vandermonde determinant, and VY1,2 are the Vandermonde determinants for the
subsets Y1,2 etc. Ref.
[32] further proves that each of the factors det U (a1,b1)
Y1
/VY1VY 1 are invariant
under the full Sn permutation group, despite only manifesting permutation invariance on the subgroup
Sn/2 × Sn/2 × Z2. The only further identity we will need is for det XY , which can be expressed as
det XY =
V 2
Y V 2
Y
V
.
(4.38)
If we choose Y1 = Y2 = Y in (4.37), we thus ﬁnd that
Pf U (a,b) = det U (a1,b1)
Y
det U (a2,b2)
Y
det XY
.
(4.39)
This gives manifestly permutation invariant formulae for all of the ratios in (4.35),
Pf U (2,0) = det 2UY
det XY
,
Pf U (1,1) = det UY det ˜UY
det XY
,
(4.40)
from which we deduce the following manifestly permutation invariant representation fo the M5 half-
integrand, as well as the following relation between the reduced determinant det ′H and det ′A,
Ih
M5 =
Pf ′A
Pf U (2,0) ,
det ′H =
Pf ′A
Pf U (1,1) .
(4.41)
In particular, the full M5 superamplitude takes the form
AM5
n
=
Z
dµpol
n
det ′A
Pf ′A
Pf U (2,0) eF2 .
(4.42)
This integrand now manifests N = (2, 0) supersymmetry and is manifestly chiral and permutation
invariant. We note that all dependence on the polarization data is encoded by the Pfaﬃan Pf U (2,0),
an argument similar to the one presented in §4.5 guarantees that the amplitude is indeed linear. While
the integrand is guaranteed to be correct by construction (supersymmetry and agreement with the
SU(2) scalar subsector of D5 theory), we verify in §6 that both M5 and D5 amplitudes agree upon
dimensional reduction to ﬁve dimensions as an additional check.
4.4
Consistency of the reduced determinant with the supersymmetry representation
Our gauge (and gravity) formulae in eﬀect give two diﬀerent representations of bosonic amplitudes
with gluons coming from diﬀerent parts of the multiplets. One comes from simply substituting gluon
polarizations from diﬀerent parts of the multiplet in the kinematic integrand det ′H and the other
from expanding out the supersymmetry factors. In this subsection we show that these give the same
formulae.
When a subset I of the particles are in states at the bottom of the (chiral part of the) supersym-
metry multipet, the integrals over the supercharges lead to the integrand
Ih
n = det U I det ′H eF
¯
I+ ˜
F ,
(4.43)
– 28 –

where U I
ij = U (1,0)
ij
and the superscripts indicate the restriction to the subsets I and ¯I respectively.
On the other hand, for any choice of polarization data, the integrand for gluons (gravitons) takes the
form of a reduced determinant,
I
vi1...vi|I|
n
= det ′HI eF
¯
I+ ˜
F ,
with
HI
ij =




⟨ξiκiA⟩ϵA
j

(4.44)
where HI is deﬁned with polarization spinors ⟨ξiκiA⟩instead of ϵiA for i ∈I. For the supersymmetry
to be compatible with the representation of the integrand, the two prescriptions for the amplitude
must agree, Ih
n = I
ξi1...ξi|I|
n
.
A lemma on reduced determinants.
To prove the equivalence of (4.43) and (4.44), the general
strategy will be to ﬁrst identify the relation between H and HI.
To draw conclusions about the
behaviour of their reduced determinants though, we will need a few results discussed in appendix A
of [26], which we review here for convenience.
In contrast to regular determinants, it does not make sense to ask how a reduced determinant
behaves under the addition of an arbitrary vector to a row or column of H, because this will in general
spoil the linearity relations among its rows and columns. On the other hand, we can deﬁne a new
reduced determinant by multiplication with an invertible n × n matrix U, since this leaves the (full)
determinant det H = det ˆH = 0 unaﬀected,
ˆHj
i := U k
i Hj
k .
(4.45)
Since the kernel and co-kernel of H are spanned by w and ˜w,14 the kernel of ˆH = UH is ˆw = U −1w.
To be explicit, ˆH and ˆw satisfy relations analogous to (2.53),
X
i

a ˆHj
i = 0 ,
X
j
˜wb
j ˆHj
i = 0 ,
for ˆwi
a =
 U −1i
k wk
a .
(4.46)
We can thus deﬁne a reduced determinant det ′ ˆH as in (4.7) by
εi1i2...inεj1j2...jn ˆHjp+1
ip+1 . . . ˆHjn
in ⟨ˆw1 . . . ˆwp⟩

˜w1 . . . ˜wp
= det ′ ˆH ˆw[i1
1 . . . ˆwip]
p
˜w1
[j1 . . . ˜wp
jp] .
(4.47)
Let us multiply this equation by p facors of U. On the right-hand-side, this cancels the factors of U −1
from the kernel ˆw[i1
1 . . . ˆwip]
p , whereas on the left, it combines with the (n −p) factors from ˆH = UH
to det U. Putting this all together, we arrive at the following lemma [26]:
Lemma 4.2 Under multiplication by an invertible matrix U, the reduced determinant of a matrix
ˆH := U H behaves as
det ′ ˆH = det U det ′H ,
(4.48)
with the reduced determinant deﬁned using the kernel ˆw = U −1w.
This implies in particular that the usual row- and column operations leave the reduced determinant
unaﬀected, det ′ ˆH = det ′H, due to det U = 1.
14As discussed above, for super Yang-Mills and supergravity, we take wi
a = uia, where a denotes the chiral little group
index, and similarly for ˜w˙b
j = ˜u˙b
j.

Equivalence of the reduced determinants.
Lemma 4.2 now allows us to prove the compatibility
of the supersymmetry representation with the reduced determinant. We ﬁrst note that on the support
of the polarized scattering equations, HI and H are related via
HI

−⟨ξivi⟩Hij =:

(4.49)
for i ∈I. In the second equality, the middle term vanishes because u spans the kernel of H, and we
use the last equality to deﬁne U I. Combining the above result with HI
ij = Hij for i /∈I, we thus have
HI = U IH ,
with
U I

(4.50)
Since det U I is generically non-zero, and lemma 4.2 gives directly that
det ′HI = det U I det ′H ,
(4.51)
conﬁrming the equivalence of the two prescriptions.
4.5
Linearity in the polarization data
As another important check on the amplitudes (2.58), we verify that they are multilinear in the
polarization data. This is of course a mandatatory requirement for amplitudes, but is not manifest
in the integrands for gauge and gravity theories because the reduced determinants depend on the
u-variables and these can potentially depend in a complicated way on the polarization data via the
polarized scattering equations. We ﬁrst observe that linearity is manifest for amplitudes with two
external scalars and n −2 gluons. Given the supersymmetry of the formulae this provides strong
circumstantial evidence. Then we show explicitly that the reduced determinant is linear on the support
of the polarized scattering equations and go on to the full superamplitude.
4.5.1
Linearity from supersymmetry
Linearity of the gluon states is most easily seen from the mixed amplitudes with two external scalars,
e.g. j = 1, 2, and n −2 gluons. In this case, we can choose to reduce the determinant det ′H on the
scalar states, giving
Aφ1φ2ϵ3˜ϵ3... =
Z
dµpol
n
1
σ2
12
det H[12]
[12] PT(α) .
(4.52)
The integrand is then manifestly independent of {ui, vi} as well as ϵ1,2, and only depends on the
punctures σi and the polarization of the gluons. Due to the invariance of the measure established by
proposition 3.3, the ‘polarization’ spinors of the scalars ϵ1,2 are choices of reference spinors. For the
gluons on the other hand, the integrand is now manifestly linear in ϵi. Supersymmetry then guarantees
that linearity extends to the all-gluon amplitude.
The consistency between the supersymmetry representation and the reduced determinant discussed
in the last section further guarantees that the argument above holds for gluons both at the top and the
– 30 –

bottom of the multiplet; we simply replace H by HI. For gravity and brane-amplitudes, the argument
is completely analogous, and follows again from the multilinearity of the amplitude Mφ1φ2ϵ3˜ϵ3... with
two scalars and n −2 gravitons.
4.5.2
Linearity for non-supersymmetric amplitudes.
We now study the dependence of the reduced determinant on the polarization data directly by expand-
ing the spinors ϵa in a basis. This gives the desired linearity for pure Yang-Mills and gravity directly,
where the above supersymmetry argument seems excessive, but can equally be applied to supersym-
metric theories. We ﬁrst discuss (chiral) linearity for gluons, but the proof extends straightforwardly
to linearity in the anti-chiral polarization data, as well as (bi-)linearity for gravity amplitudes.
Consider the amplitude Aϵ1 or the superamplitude Aϵ1, where one of the particles is a gluon with
polarization ϵ1, and all other particles are in arbitrary states. We can expand ϵ1 in an (arbitrarily
chosen) polarization basis ζa
1 , ζa
2 via
ϵa
1 = α1ζa
1 + α2ζa
2 ,
with ⟨ζ2ζ1⟩= 1 .
(4.53)
It will be helpful to think of this new basis (ζ1, ζ2 =: ξζ1
1 ) as playing a similar role to (ϵ1, ξ1), both in
the polarized scattering equations and in the integrands. To prove linearity of the (super-) amplitudes
in the polarization, we then have to show that amplitudes in the two diﬀerent bases are related via
Aϵ1 = α1 Aζ1 + α2 Aζ2 ,
(4.54)
where the amplitudes Aϵ1 and Aζr are respectively given by
Aϵ1 =
Z
dµpol
n
det ′H PT(α) ,
Aζr =
Z
dµpol,ζr
n
det ′Hζr PT(α) ,
(4.55)
and the superscripts ζr indicate that the respective quantities are deﬁned using the polarization ζr. For
the measure, proposition 3.3 guarantees that dµpol
n
= dµpol,ζr
n
, but the integration variables uζr
i = ui(ζr)
deﬁned by dµpol,ζr
n
enter into the deﬁnition of the reduced determinant det ′Hζr. Since the measure
and the Parke-Taylor factors are invariant under changes of polarization, the linearity relation (4.54)
for the amplitude is equivalent to linearity of the spin-one contribution;
det ′H = α1 det ′Hζ1 + α2 det ′Hζ2 ,
(4.56)
where the (implicit) map between {ui, vi} on the left-hand side and {uζr
i , vζr
i } on the right hand side
is determined by the polarized scattering equations.
Proposition 4.2 For ϵa
1 = α1ζa
1 + α2ζa
2 expand also va
1 = β1ζa
1 + β2ζa
2 so that ⟨ϵ1v1⟩= 1 gives
α1β2 −α2β1 = 1. Then we have that {ui, vi} and {uζr
i , vζr
i } are related by

Proof: First note that the punctures σi are unaﬀected so we omit the superscripts here. First write
ϵa
1 = (ζa
1 + α2va
1)/β2. Using this, the polarized scattering equations Ei can be written in the form

It is now simple to map this to the polarized scattering equations Eζ1

via the change of variables
(4.57a).
□
As an aside, although Proposition 3.3 implies that the measures are unchanged, it is easily
checked directly that dµpol
n
= dµpol,ζ1
n
: the rescaling (4.57a) gives an overall factor of β−4

com-
ing from the scattering equation δ(E1) = β−4
2 δ(Eζ1
1 ), which exactly compensates the factor from
d2u1d2v1 = β4
2 d2uζ1
1 d2vζ1
1 .
The remaining part of the measure is invariant under the linear shift
in α2β2, and thus the polarized measure is invariant under the choice of polarization data.
Theorem 2 With the above deﬁnitions
det ′H = α1 det ′Hζ1 + α2 det ′Hζ2 .
(4.59)
Proof: For each solution to the scattering equations, the above correspondence (4.57) maps the
reduced determinant by
det ′H =
1
⟨u1ui⟩[˜u1˜ui] det H[1i]
[1i] = 1
β2
det ′Hζ1 .
(4.60)
Here, we have reduced on particle 1 for convenience, and used the fact that the diagonal entries Hii
for i ̸= 1 are independent of the polarization ϵ1 by (4.3). Similarly, the map from {ui, vi} to {uζ2
i , vζ2
i }
induced by the polarized scattering equations gives
det ′H = −1
β1
det ′Hζ2 .
(4.61)
Note that β1,2 depend on the solutions to the polarized scattering equations, so the relations (4.60) and
(4.61) between the reduced determinants only hold on individual solutions to the scattering equations,
and do not lead to an analogous relation for the amplitudes. However, by combining the two expression
we get the following linearity relation
det ′H = (α1β2 −α2β1) det ′H = α1 det ′Hζ1 + α2 det ′Hζ2 ,
(4.62)
as required. This is now independent of the solutions to the scattering equations, and thus lifts to the
full amplitudes, conﬁrming (4.54).
□
Superamplitudes.
The above analysis extends straightforwardly to superamplitudes to give checks
on the supersymmetry factors. As before, we take particle 1 to be a gluon, though we do not restrict
its position in the multiplet in the supersymmetric case. In the top state, its polarization is ϵ1 =
α1ζ1 + α2ζ2 as above, and in the bottom state we choose the polarization
ξ1 = αξ
1ζ1 + αξ
2ζ2 ,
(4.63)
– 32 –

with constant αξ
1,2 such that α1αξ
2 −α2αξ
1 = 1 due to the normalization condition ⟨ϵ1ξ1⟩= 1.
As indicated above, in the supersymmetric case it will be helpful to treat the basis spinors (ζ1, ζ2) as
the new basis for the multiplet of particle 1. In the explicit change of variables given in proposition 4.2,
ζ1 plays the rˆole of the original ϵ1, and ζ2 provides the additional polarization spinor to parametrize
the full mutiplet, i.e. ξζ1
1 = ζ2.15 Using this choice, we can verify by expanding out both sides and
using the relation between {ui, vi} and {uζ1
i , vζ1
i } from proposition 4.2 that

The superscript ζ1 again indicates that the supersymmetry factor is deﬁned with the multiplet parametrized
by the polarization ζ1, as well as the variables uζ1
i . Similarly, for gluon states at the bottom of the
multiplet, we ﬁnd

and similarly for the gluon at the bottom of the multiplet with polarization ξ1. The simplicity of this
relation is due to our choice of ξζ1
1 = ζ2: using this, as well as the results from §4.4, the second term
on the right gives indeed the amplitude for a gluon with polarization ζ2 with a proportionality factor
of α2. As in the bosonic case, the ﬁnal linearity relation (4.66) is independent of the solution to the
polarized scattering equations, and thus lifts to the full superamplitude,
Aϵ1 = α1 Aζ1 + α2 Aζ2 ,
Aξ1 = αξ

The three and four-point amplitudes
In this section, we discuss the three-particle and four-particle amplitudes in our polarized scattering
equations formalism (2.58), and compare them to previous results available in the literature, e.g. [19].
We ﬁrst focus on the three-particle amplitudes that will serve as the seed amplitudes for the BCFW
recursion relation of section 7. Since the conﬁguration of three momenta is highly degenerate, we
include a treatment of the four-particle case for further illustration.
For the calculations below, two general observations will be helpful. First, for low numbers of
external particles, the most useful formulation of the scattering equations arise from (2.30), obtained
by skew-symmetrizing the ith polarized scattering equation with ϵiA to give
X
j
⟨uiuj⟩ϵj[AϵB]i
σij
= KiAB .
(5.1)
This can be skewed with further polarization spinors to obtain formulae for uij := ⟨uiuj⟩/σij. We will
use this below to construct explicit solutions to the polarized scattering equations, both for three and
four particles.
15Of course, we are free to reverse the roles of ζ1 and ζ2 in this discussion, at the expense of a minus sign due to our
normalization conventions.
– 33 –

After solving the polarized scattering equations and simplifying the integrands on these solutions,
amplitudes are expressed in the form Aϵ1˜ϵ1...ϵn˜ϵn, with all little group indices contracted linearly into
the polarization spinors ϵa
i and ˜ϵ˙a
i . To compare our results to the formulae obtained in e.g. [19],
we thus have to convert between our polarized formalism and the standard, little-group covariant
spinor-helicity formalism, where amplitudes Aa1 ˙a1...an ˙an
n
carry the little group indices of the scattered
particles. Using that the amplitudes (2.58) are linear in the polarization spinors ϵa
i and ˜ϵ˙a
i as shown
in §4.5, the two formalisms are related via
Aϵ1˜ϵ1...ϵn˜ϵn =
Y

ϵiai˜ϵi˙ai . . . Aa1 ˙a1...an ˙an

(5.2)
5.1
Three-point amplitudes
We now compute the three particle case to compare to the Yang-Mills result given in [19].
This
case is somewhat degenerate as momentum conservation implies that the three null momenta are also
mutually orthogonal. In Lorentz signature they would of necessity be proportional, which would be too
degenerate to calculate with. We therefore allow complex momenta so that they span a null two-plane.
This can be expressed by the non-vanishing 2−form that is given in spinors by
κBκA := (k1 ∧k2)A
B = −(k1 ∧k3)A
B = (k2 ∧k3)A
B .
(5.3)
The spinors κA and κA are deﬁned up to an overall scale and its inverse and are orthogonal to each
momentum.
We can represent each momentum kiAB as a line in the projective spin space CP3 through the two
spinors κiaA for a = 1, 2. That each line contains κA means that they are concurrent and that they
are orthogonal to κA means that they are co-planar as in the diagram 5.1.
To compare to the results of [19], we introduce little group spinors ma
i , ˜m˙a
i for each i
κA = ,
κA = ˜m˙a
i κA
i˙a .
(5.4)
These are deﬁned in [19] equivalently by
κiAaκA
j˙b = mia ˜mj˙b .
(5.5)
As in [19], we further introduce spinors wi, ˜wi normalized against mi, ˜mi such that
miawa
i = 1 ,
˜mi˙a ˜w ˙a
i = 1 .
(5.6)
This normalization does not fully ﬁx wi, ˜wi, since we have the further freedom to add on terms
proportional to mi, ˜mi. We can partially ﬁx this redundancy wia →wia + cimia by the condition
wa
1κ1Aa + wa
2κ2Aa + wa
3κ3Aa = 0 ,
(5.7)
which imposes co-linearity of the three points ⟨wiκiA⟩on the lines ki and reduces the redundancy to
shifts satisfying c1 + c2 + c3 = 0.
In what follows we will compute the three gluon amplitude from the general formula (2.50) in
Yang Mills theory. For three particles the σi can be ﬁxed to (0, 1, ∞) and the formula reduces to
A3 = det′H|∗=

evaluated on the solution to the polarized scattering equations, as indicated by the star. Note that
the Jacobian from solving the polarized scattering equations is trivial due to proposition 3.3. Having
gauge ﬁxed three of the u variables as in §3.2, we only need to solve the polarized scattering equations
for the three Uij := U (1,0)
ij
= ⟨uiuj⟩/σij, with Uij = Uji for i ̸= j,
U12ϵ2A + U13ϵ3A = ⟨v1κ1A⟩,
and cyclic,
(5.9)
together with the normalization conditions ⟨viϵi⟩= 1. These three scattering equations equations de-
ﬁne lines in the plane spanned by the three momenta in the projective spin space as in the diagram 5.1.

Figure 1. Each ki corresponds to a line in the projective spin space spanned by κiaA. The lines lie in a
common two-plane orthogonal to κA and are concurrent meeting at κA deﬁned by (5.4). Thus the line k1 joins
ϵ1A and κA and so on. The polarized scattering equations give 3 further lines, e.g. with E1A giving the line
joining ϵ2A and ϵ3A and intersecting k1 at ⟨v1κ1A⟩.
In order to solve the polarized scattering equations we use the ϵiA as a basis of the plane in the
projective spin space orthogonal to κA to write
κA =
X

aiϵiA
(5.10)
Using the normalization ⟨viϵi⟩= 1, we can further expand vi in the polarization basis ϵi, mi;

⟨miϵi⟩(⟨mivi⟩ϵia + mia) ,
and solve the system (2.2) to obtain
Uij =

⟨mjϵj⟩=

⟨mivi⟩= ai .

To compare to [19], we can similarly decompose

⟨ϵimi⟩mi,
(5.12)
and impose the condition (5.7) to obtain:
ai =

⟨ϵ1m1⟩⟨ϵ2m2⟩⟨ϵ3w3⟩+ cyc.
(5.13)
The scattering equations for spinors in the antifundamental representation are solved entirely analo-
gously and together we obtain from (5.8) the three point amplitude as
A3 =

⟨ϵ1m1⟩⟨ϵ2m2⟩⟨ϵ3w3⟩+ cyc.

(5.14)
where we have used that ϵ1AϵA
2 = ⟨ϵ1m1⟩[ϵ2 ˜m2] from (5.5). This is precisely the result in [19], contracted
into the polarization spinors as discussed around (5.2).
5.2
Four-point Yang-Mills amplitudes
To illustrate these techniques in a slightly more generic setting, consider next the four-gluon amplitude
in Yang-Mills theory. As before, we can ﬁx three of the marked points on the sphere, e.g. σ1, σ2 and
σ4, so that the solution to the scattering equation in homogeneous coordinates is
σ1 = [(1, 0)] σ2 = [(1, 1)] σ3 = [(1, −s13
s12
)] σ4 = [(0, 1)] .
(5.15)
From the measure, we thus pick up the CHY Jacobian |Φ|
[j1j2j3]
[i1i2i3] := |∂Ei/∂σj|
[j1j2j3]
[i1i2i3] as well as the usual
Fadeev-Popov factors (σi1i2σi2i3σi3i1) and (σj1j2σj2j3σj3j1) due to the equality between the polarized
measure and the usual CHY measure established in proposition 3.3. Combining this with the four-
particle Yang-Mills integrand (2.58a) gives

In order to solve for U34 we contract this for i = 3 with εABCDϵ1Cϵ2D to obtain
U34 = −⟨k312⟩
⟨1234⟩,
(5.20)
where we deﬁne
⟨1234⟩= εABCDϵ1Aϵ2Bϵ3Cϵ4D ,
⟨k312⟩= εABCDk3ABϵ1Cϵ2D .
(5.21)
Similarly we obtain, using square brackets for 4-brackets of upper-indexed quantities,
˜U12 = −[k134]
[1234].
(5.22)
Using these we can solve for the via to give
v1a = ⟨κ1a234⟩
⟨1234⟩,
(5.23)
and so on.
The resulting expression for A4 can be simpliﬁed by expanding the product of upper and lower ε

(5.27)
upon the usual identiﬁcation (5.2).
As discussed in section 2.4, the supersymmetry representation we use breaks little group symmetry
so that little group multiplets are spread in diﬀerent degrees in the superﬁeld expansion (2.46) in terms
of supermomenta. All above expressions are for gluons in the top state gϵ˜ϵ, but the calculations extend
directly to other amplitudes as well. As we have seen in section 4.4, amplitudes for gluons appearing
at order q2 in the multiplet can be calculated either from the supersymmetry representation, or by
replacing ϵi →ξi in the integrand.
At four points, this can be seen explicitly: consider ﬁrst the
amplitude A4(gϵ1˜ϵ1gϵ2˜ϵ2gξ3˜ϵ3gξ4˜ϵ4) obtained from the supersymmetry representation,
A4(gϵ1˜ϵ1gϵ2˜ϵ2gξ3˜ϵ3gξ4˜ϵ4) = Aϵ1˜ϵ1...ϵ4˜ϵ4

Here we have used ki AB = ξi[Aϵi|B] in the ﬁrst equality, as well as the notation ξiA := ⟨ξiκiA⟩, and the
last equality follows from a Schouten identity in the two-dimensional space deﬁned by εABCDϵ1Cϵ2D.
Using the result (5.27) for the amplitude where all gluons are in the top state, we thus ﬁnd
A4(gϵ1˜ϵ1gϵ2˜ϵ2gξ3˜ϵ3gξ4˜ϵ4) = ⟨12 ξ3ξ4⟩[1234]
s12s14
.
(5.30)
This clearly agrees with the result from the integrand det ′HI for I = {3, 4}, i.e. by replacing ϵia
by ξia for i = 3, 4 in (5.27). Similar conjugate formulae apply for amplitudes with a pair of external
particles in the gϵ˜ξ states.
5.3
Other theories
The Yang-Mills calculations extend directly to the other theories expressed as integrals over the po-
larized scattering equations. For any theory that admits the representation (2.50), the four point
amplitude for the top states of the supersymmetry multiplet has the form:

where the ∗indicates that the formula is evaluated on the solutions to the polarized scattering equa-

to evaluate the amplitude for other theories than Yang-Mills (2.58). We have already discussed the
Jacobian,

(5.33c)
It is then straightforward to calculate all four-particle amplitudes for the theories we have discussed.
In (2, 2) supergravity, for all particles in the top state, we obtain:
M grav

(5.34)

we have

(5.35)
AM5

agreeing with [15]. As expected these give the same result on reducing to four or ﬁve dimensions where
fundamental and anti-fundamental spinors are identiﬁed, see section 6.
The more exotic and controversial formulae in table 1, obtained by double-copying the above
integrands. When combining the M5 half integrand with a Parke Taylor factor, we get
A(2,0)−PT
4
= ⟨1234⟩2
s12s14
.
(5.37)
As expected, the formula is chiral, and has the same reduction to 5d as the Yang-Mills amplitude. We
can also look at the formulae for other ‘double copied’ theories in table 1:
A(3,1)

= ⟨1234⟩3[1234]
s12s13s14
(5.38)
A(4,0)

.
(5.39)
We note that (5.38)-(5.39) give the same result as the gravity amplitudes (5.34) upon reduction to
four and ﬁve dimensions. However, in six dimensions, as remarked in [16, 20], the formulae are more
problematic as soft limits (or factorization) to three-point amplitudes are not obviously well-deﬁned.
This is because the three-particle kinematics κA = ma
i κiaA and κA = ˜m˙a
i κA

scaling ambiguity

that cancels in κAκB. In our discussion of the Yang-Mills three-particle amplitudes, this was reﬂected
in the the two factors
 ⟨ϵ1m1⟩⟨ϵ2m2⟩⟨ϵ3w3⟩+cyc.

× (its tilded version) not being individually invariant
under the scaling (5.40), although of course this ambiguity cancels in the full amplitude (5.14). In the
chiral double-copied amplitudes (5.37) - (5.39) however, this scaling ambiguity cannot cancel anymore,
so there are no invariant three-point amplitudes for gerbe theories. On reduction to 5d, there is an
identiﬁcation between the chiral and anti-chiral spinors so the scaling in (5.40) is ﬁxed up to sign. This
is also reﬂected in the factorization discussion of the related formulae in [16], where it was shown that
the resulting three-particle formulae are non-local. As discussed there, the non-locality can be made
manifest in two diﬀerent ways. To factorize the four-particle formula into the product of two three-
particle objects summed over internal states, we have to either ﬁx a scale α or ﬁx the shift redundancy
wia →wia + cimia of the dual variables. In both cases, the required ‘frame choice’ depends on the
kinematics of all four particles, and the three-particle objects are not invariant under the a rescaling
of α (in the ﬁrst case) or a shift in ci (in the latter case).
Thus it seems unlikely that the formulae (5.37) - (5.39) can be interpreted as tree-level S-matrices
in the normal sense.
5.4
Fermionic amplitudes
We can also evaluate amplitudes involving the fermionic sector. We will show here how this works for
the scattering of two gluons with two gluini in (1, 1) super Yang-Mills, but the results can be adapted
easily to supergravity and the brane theories.

This agrees with our result (5.42) after contraction into the external polarization states.

Dimensional reduction
As an additional check on our formulae, we examine their behaviour under dimensional reduction.
When we reduce D5 and M5 amplitudes to 5d, both expressions are expected to agree there. Similarly
when we reduce our (controversial) (0, 2) formula with the Parke-Taylor, the formulae agree with those
of the reduced (1, 1) super Yang-Mills formula. Similarly the reduced (3, 1) and (0, 4) formulae also
agree with the reduced (2, 2) supergravity formulae. When (1, 1) super Yang-Mills and (2, 2) super
gravity theories are reduced to 5d, we see that our supersymmetry representation naturally extends
the R-symmetry to Sp(2) and Sp(4) respectively.
We further reduce the super Yang-Mills and supergravity to the 4d massless case, where we recover
the 4d version of the polarized scattering equations reviewed in section 2.2. The main new feature
of the 4d massless case is the emergence of (MHV) sectors for the amplitude, whereas neither the
4d massive nor the higher dimensional amplitudes split into sectors.
We will see below that the
dimensional reduction gives rise to a uniﬁed formula for all sectors, with the separation into diﬀerent
MHV sectors appearing naturally from diﬀerent classes of solutions to the 6d polarized scattering
equations. The reduction to massive 4d kinematics, and in particular the Coulomb branch in super
Yang-Mills, has already been discussed in previous work [17], and we refer the interested reader to that
paper, as well as [16] for related topics in the little-group preserving supersymmetry representation.

6.1
Dimensional reduction to 5d
On reduction to 5d, the sixth direction is represented as a skew spinor that we will denote ΩAB so
that a ﬁve vector kAB must satisfy kABΩAB = 0. In 5d spinor indices can now be raised and lowered
with ΩAB and its inverse. This reduces the spin group from SL(4, C) to Spin(5) = Sp(2).
Starting with a theory in 6d with (N, ˜N)-supersymmetry, we can lower the supersymmetry gen-
erator spinor index ˜QA ˙I = ΩBAQB
˙I
so that now in 5d we can write QAI = (QAI, ˜QA ˙I) where
I = 1, . . . , 2N where N = N + ˜N. We can deﬁne the skew form ΩI,J = ΩIJ ⊕Ω˙I ˙J and with this the
R-symmetry has the possibility of extending from Sp(N) × Sp(˜N) to Sp(N + ˜N). Thus we see that
reduction of theories with (1, 1) and (0, 2)-supersymmetry in 6d can naturally reduce to theories with
identical supersymmetry in 5d if there is nothing in the spectrum to break the increased R-symmetry.
This is typically the case in the massless sectors of the reduced theories (although diﬀerences will
generally be seen in Kaluza-Klein massive modes).
5d spinor helicity and scattering equations from 6d.
In 5d, the massless little group will be
Spin(3, C) = Sl(2, C) rather then Spin(4) = Sl(2, C) × Sl(2, C). Given a 5d massless momentum kAB,
we can introduce the spinor helicity frame κa
A satisfying
kAB = κa
Aκb
Bεab ,
k · Ω= 0
(6.1)
But we can now raise the indices with ΩAB to obtain κAa providing also the κA˙a thus identifying the
dotted little group in 6d with the undotted one. Now κa
A transforms in the fundamental representation
of Spin(5, C) ∼= Sp(4, C), and a labels the little group for massless particles, Spin(3, C) ∼= SL(2, C).
Spin one polarization data are 2-forms given in 5d by symmetric spinors FAB = F(AB) satisfying
kABFBC = 0. Thus they arise from little group spinors ϵab = ϵ(ab) with FAB = κa
Aκb
Bϵab and we can
take ϵab = ϵaϵb. When reduced from 6d, we therefore identify both the 6d ϵ˙a and ϵa with the 5d ϵas.
This therefore becomes the same polarization data as one obtained from the symmetry reduction of
the 6d Gerbe ﬁeld.
The chiral polarized scattering equations reduce straightforwardly, with the u’s, ϵ’s and v’s now
all transforming in the 5d little group. However, the same is true for the anti-fundamental scattering
equations, where the ˜u’s etc now transform under the same SL(2, C), i.e. ˜u˙a
i →˜ua
i . Moreover, we
have seen that we should take ˜ϵi = ϵi after reduction. Thus the fundamental and anti-fundamental
scattering equations are identiﬁed
˜E5d A
i
= ΩABEi B
u→˜u
v→˜v
.
(6.2)
We therefore have the same equations for both (ui, vi) and (˜ui, ˜vi). By the uniqueness of the solution
ensured by proposition 3.2, we have
˜ua
i = ua
i ,
˜va
i = va
i .

We can implement the reduction from 6d amplitude formulae to 5d via a projection operator

The second product goes only up to n−1 so that the nth integral can absorb the sixth component of the
momentum-conserving delta-function. The resulting formula then has the correct count of variables
– 41 –

vs symmetries and delta-functions, and leading to the required δ5 for momentum conservation. We
therefore deﬁne
dµpol,5d
n

(6.5)
The polarized measure dµpol,5d
n
in 5d thus has none of the subtleties of the 6d case, and all constraints
are manifestly imposed via delta-functions.
Dimensional reduction of the integrands and formulae.
Upon reduction, the spin-one matrix

ij →H5d
ij becomes symmetric as ϵi = ˜ϵi gives

ij = ϵA

i ̸= j.
This is suﬃcient to give Yang-Mills with integrand det′ H5d PT and gravity with (det′ H5d)2.
The dimensional reduction of the supersymmetry factors proceeds along the same lines, driven
again by the equality (6.3). We ﬁnd

For N = (1, 1) supersymmetry, we can thus naturally combine the fermionic variables qiI = (qil, ˜qi˙l)
into N = 2 supermomenta, with the symplectic metric Ω= diag(Ω, ˜Ω) composed of the N = 1, ˜N = 1
metrics in 6d. This manifests that

(6.7)
Thus for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills we obtain the integrand eF 5d
2 det′ H5d PT.
Simi-
larly, the 6d (2, 2)-supersymmetry factor reduces to F 5d
4
giving the maximal supergravity integrand
eF 5d
4 det′(H5d)2.
Finally, for the brane integrands, we ﬁrst note that from ui = ˜ui, that U (a,b) reduces to U (m)
U (m)
ij
:= ⟨uiuj⟩m
σij
,
(6.8)
with a + b = m. Further, from (2.57), we ﬁnd
det ′H5d =
Pf ′A
Pf U (2) ,
(6.9)
On the other hand, the M5 integrand reduces to the same expression due to the equality between ui
and ˜ui,
Pf ′A
Pf U (2,0)
5d
=
Pf ′A
Pf U (2) = det ′H ,
(6.10)
This in particular gives a nontrivial meaning to the right hand side for odd particle number in 5d,
and the D5 and M5 integrands become the same. With both the integrands and the supersymmetry
factors agreeing among M5 and D5, we conclude that both theories give the same amplitudes when
reduced to 5d.
– 42 –

The above reductions imply that the integrands of the (0, 2)-PT theory reduced to 5d now makes
sense for both even and odd numbers of particles, and agrees with the reduction of maximal super
Yang-Mills. Similarly the 5d reductions of (1, 3) and (0, 4) theories make sense for both odd and even
numbers of particles and agree with the 5d maximal supergravity formulae.
6.2
Dimensional reduction to 4d
The 6d formalism similarly allows for a natural embedding of both 4d massive and massless kinematics.
On reduction, the 6d spin spaces each reduce to the sum of the dotted and undotted spin spaces so
ϵA = (ϵα, ϵ ˙α). The massive little group in 4d is Spin(3, C) = Sl(2, C) and we can choose the 6d little
group frames so that both SL(2, C)-factors align with the massive 4d little group,
κa
A =

(6.11)
Here, a = 0, 1 denote the 4d massive little group indices. Massive momenta, as well as the mass m,
are constructed via
kα ˙α = καa˜κ ˙αbϵab ,
καaκβbϵab = Mεαβ ,
˜κ ˙αa˜κ ˙βbεab = ˜
Mϵ ˙α ˙β .
(6.12)
with M = ˜
M and M 2 = m2. For more details of the reduction to the Coulomb branch, see [16, 17].
From hereon we focus on the reduction to massless kinematics. When M = ˜
M = 0, the two spinors
become proportional, and following already from the reduction to 5d, we can identify the dotted and
undotted little groups. We choose a little-group frame with κ0
α = ˜κ1
˙α = 0 so

With this, the polarization data and 2-forms reduce as

0˜κ ˙ακ ˙βεαβ .
(6.14)
We see that the two components of ϵia are naturally distinguished by helicity.
Scattering equations.
When reduced to the four-dimensional massless case as in (6.13), the po-
larized scattering equations become
Eiα =

ϵj 1κjα −vi 1κiα ,
˜Ei
˙α =

ϵj 0˜κj
˙α −vj 0˜κi
˙α .
(6.15)
At this stage, the scattering equations have a uniﬁed form valid for all MHV sectors simultaneously.
They can be reduced to the 4d polarized scattering equations (2.13) reﬁned by MHV sector by dividing
the external particles into two sets with k and n −k particles respectively, corresponding to positive
and negative helicities. This determines the ϵia up to scale from (6.14). With this we can embed the
massless 4d polarized scattering equations (2.13) into (6.15) with the following consequent choices for
the uia and via
ϵia = (0, ϵi)
ξia = via = −1
ϵi
(1, 0)
uia = (ui, 0)
i ∈−,
(6.16a)
ϵpa = (˜ϵp, 0)
ξpa = vpa = 1
˜ϵp
(0, 1)
upa = (0, up)
p ∈+ .
(6.16b)
– 43 –

This assignment automatically solves the scattering equations Eiα = 0 for i ∈−and ˜Ep ˙α = 0 for p ∈+.
Thus the remaining polarized scattering equations reduce to the reﬁned scattering equations for the
Nk−2MHV sector
Epα =

(6.17b)
where we have written
ϵiα = ϵi1κα,
for i ∈−,
and
˜ϵp ˙α = ˜ϵp0˜κp ˙α .
(6.18)
Thus the 4d reﬁned scattering equations are clearly a subset of the solutions to the dimensionally
reduced polarized scattering equations (6.15) for the given choice of polarization data. Conversely,
these are indeed all solutions, since the reﬁned scattering equations have A(n −3, k −2) solutions,
where A denotes the Eulerian number. Summing over all sectors, the ansatz (6.16) these give the full
(n −3)! solutions of the polarized scattering equations. We will also see below that any division not
lining up with the particle helicities has vanishing contribution.
The reduced determinants.
To study the reduction of det′ H in terms of the 4d data above, note
that ϵi ∼(0, 1) for negative helicity particles, and ϵp ∼(1, 0) for positive helicities. Thus the entries
in the H become Hk with
Hk
ij := ⟨ϵiϵj⟩
σij
,
Hk
pq := [˜ϵp˜ϵq]
σpq
,
Hip = Hpi = 0 .
(6.19)
for i, j ∈−and p, q ∈+. This agrees with the Hodges matrix (2.17) as reviewed in §2.2. In particular,
the relations among its entries become the row- and column relations described in [18]:
X
j∈−
ujHk
ij = 0 ,
X
q∈+
uqHk
pq = 0 .
(6.20)
We can now understand how the polarized scattering equations restrict to the correct MHV sector
for a given conﬁguration of particle helicities. To see this, we need to show that if the split in (6.16)
into −and + does not line up with the helicities of the respective particles, the contribution to the
amplitude vanishes. But since the integrand is always formulated for the correct MHV sector due to
our discussion above, this is just the familiar result of Ref. [28] that the reduced determinant vanishes
when evaluated on scattering equations reﬁned to a diﬀerent sector.
Measure.
To obtain the correct measure on reduction to 4d, we have to include the appropriate
delta-function restricting the kinematics to 4d. A convenient choice is
Π4d :=
Z
n
Y
i=1
dki,12 dki,34
n
Y
j,l=1
j̸=1, l̸=n
δ (kj,12) δ (kl,34) ,
(6.21)
since it reproduces the reduction to κ given in (6.13). Note that although we integrate over all n
momenta, only n −1 delta-functions are included, the remaining constraints follow from momentum
conservation.
It follows from general considerations that we should have
– 44 –

Lemma 6.1
dµ4d
n,k
Y
i,p
ϵi˜ϵp = det ′Hk Π4d dµpol
n
(6.22)
so that dµ4d
n gives det ′Hk as Jacobian relative to the dµpol = dµCHY on the solutions (6.16) reﬁned
to the given MHV sector. In particular det ′Hk vanishes on the other MHV sectors.
The general considerations arise from comparing the CHY gauge and gravity formulae of (2.9) to
the corresponding 4d ambitwistor string formulae of (2.21). The ﬁrst step to notice is that the the
gauge theory formulae of (2.9) and (2.21) are identiﬁed if we have
dµ4d
n,k = Pf′(M)dµCHY
n
.
(6.23)
Then the fact that the gauge and gravity formulae for CHY are related by exchanging the Parke-Taylor
factor for Pf′(M), whereas for the 4d ambitwistor-string one exchanges the Parke-Taylor for det ′Hk
suggests that in the kth MHV sector
Pf′(M) = det ′Hk.
(6.24)
This was shown explicitly in [28, 32]. Finally recall that the measure dµpol
n
was shown to be equivalent
to the CHY measure in §3.2 and putting this together suggests the lemma. We now prove this explicitly,
albeit via 6d.
Proof: We have seen above that the 6d polarized scattering equations reduce to the 4d version and
so have the correct support restricted to the given MHV sector. To calculate the Jacobian, consider
a ﬁxed MHV sector, corresponding to the solutions (6.16) to the polarized scattering equations. We
ﬁrst ﬁx part of the SL(2, C)u invariance by setting u1 1 = un 0 = 0 for 1 ∈−and n ∈+, giving a
contribution to the Jacobian of u1un. Similarly, we use the corresponding scattering equations E1 1
and ˜En
˙0 to solve for kn,12 and kn,34, introducing a Jacobian of ϵ1 0˜ϵ˙1
n. We used (6.16b) to solve the
polarized scattering equations that dont survive in the 4d measure or framework

p = 0 ,
(6.25b)
for the variables ui 1, up 0, vi 1 and vp 0 (using the normalization conditions to ﬁx the other components
of v). This gives a further Jacobian that we denote Jpol so that we have

on the solutions (6.16b), so we have Jpol = J−J+, with J−and J+ the determinants of the respective
block matrices. On the solutions (6.16), the entries of the matrix with determinant J−are given by

(6.28)
The Jacobian J−is the determinant of this (2k −1) × (2k −1) matrix (as we have already dealt
with u11). To simplify this, introduce the index notation E−
2i−1 ≡Ei,α=0 and E−
2i ≡Ei,α=1 so that the
Jacobian J−is given by

determinant with ∂E2i−1/∂vi1 must multiply some ∂E2i/∂ui1 and similarly ∂E2i/∂vi1 must multiply
some ∂E2i−1/∂ui1 with the opposite sign leading to a contraction on the spinor index. Thus the sum
collapses to one over half the indices, and after some re-ordering of the terms and relabelling of the
indices, we ﬁnd

In the second equality, we have used (6.28) to see that contraction into the respective κi reproduces
the entries of H−, and the last equality holds due to the reduction relations (6.20) for the reduced
determinant. Similarly,

(6.31)
The extra factors ϵ1 0˜ϵ˙1
n thus cancel against the Jacobian from integrating out k1,12 and kn,34, the
factors of u cancel against the measure and partial gauge ﬁxing, and we indeed are left with (6.22).□
As a corollary we brieﬂy mention that for momenta in four dimensions, the (n −3)! solutions to
the scattering equations can be reﬁned by MHV degree k with Eulerian number16 A(n −3, k −2) in
the kth sector [4, 44]. The above relation between measures gives
Corollary 6.1 The 4d measure dµ4d
n,k is supported on the A(n −3, k −2) solutions to the scattering
equations in the kth sector.
Proof: This follows from the fact that det ′Hk is supported on the kth sector. To see this, deﬁne the
matrices H± by
H+
ij = ⟨ϵiϵj⟩
σij
,
H−
ij = [ϵiϵj]
σij
,
i ̸= j ,
H±
ii = ei · P(σi) .
(6.32)
On the one hand, minors of these appear as the blocks in Hk. On the other hand, as explained in
[27], these are gauge ﬁxed versions of the n × n matrices appearing in the Cachazo-Skinner gravity
twistor-string-like formulae [6, 26]. In those papers it is shown that at degree k −1 in the twistor-
string, appropriate to MHV degree k −2, these matrices have ranks k −1 and n −k −1 respectively.
Thus det ′Hk will vanish because one or other block will have insuﬃcient rank when restricted to the
inappropriate MHV sector. □
16The Eulerian number A(p, q) is the number of permutations of 1 to p where q elements are larger than their preceding
element. They are deﬁned recursively by A(p, q) = (p −q)A(p −1, q −1) + (q + 1)A(p −1, q).

(6.34)
where qI = ΩIJqJ etc. The index placement is chosen to manifest the embedding of Sp(N) × Sp( ˜N)
into the bigger 4d SU(N) R-symmetry group. We can make this explicit by introducing qI = (qI, ˜q ˙I)
and ˜qI = (qI, ˜q ˙I), where I = 1, . . . , N = N + ˜N is the SU(N) R-symmetry index in 4d.
The

Here qI and ˜qI are conjugate supermomenta, related by a fermionic Fourier transform and ϵ ↔˜ϵ−1.
When implementing this reduction in the amplitude, only terms containing one particle of each
helicity survive in the exponential supersymmetry factors due to the form of the solutions (6.16) to
the 4d scattering equations,

this is one of the standard supersymmetry representations in 4d, sometimes referred to as the link

Combining the above results, we ﬁnd that the 6d amplitudes for super Yang-Mills and supergravity
reduce correctly to the 4d amplitudes (2.21).

Super-BCFW in 6d
In this section, we give a proof of the gravity and Yang-Mills formulae using BCFW recursion [46, 47],
c.f. theorem 1. This is a powerful on-shell tool that has been used to prove a variety of explicit
– 47 –

amplitude representations.
This technique has two main ingredients.
The ﬁrst is to introduce a
deformation of the formula for the amplitude depending on a complex parameter z, and to use complex
analysis to reconstruct the amplitude in terms of its residues at poles in z. The second key ingredient
in the argument is the factorization property of amplitudes. We know from the Feynman diagram
representation of amplitudes that they are multilinear in the polarization vectors and rational in the
momenta.
The only poles arise from propagators, so that they can only arise along factorization
channels, where partial sums of the momenta go on shell. At tree-level, factorization is the statement
that the residues at such poles are tree amplitudes on each side of the propagator. This then allows
us to identify the residues in z in terms of lower point amplitudes, setting up the recursion. In the
following we give more details of the generalities of this argument. In §7.1 we introduce the complex
shift adapted to our formulae. In §7.2 we prove that our formulae factorize correctly; this includes
also our brane formulae giving a key check on these also. In §7.3 we show that there is no pole as the
deformation parameter is taken to inﬁnity in our formulae, completing the BCFW recursion proof of
our supersymmetric gauge and gravity formulae (2.58).
BCFW shifts are generally based on the following one-parameter deformation of the external
momenta,
ˆk1µ = k1µ + z qµ ,
ˆknµ = knµ −z qµ ,
(7.1)
with q2 = q · k1 = q · kn = 0. Cauchy’s theorem applied to A/z then gives an equality between the
original undeformed amplitude at z = 0 and the sum over all other residues at the possible factorisation
channels of the amplitude and at ∞. If

we say that there are no boundary terms at z = ∞. The residue theorem then expresses the amplitude
at z = 0 as a sum over products of lower point amplitudes AnL+1 arising at and AnR+1, with nL + 1
and nR + 1 = (n −nL) + 1 particles respectively, but at shifted values of z

The sum runs over partitions of the n particles into two sets L and R, with one of the deformed
momenta in each subset, 1 ∈L and n ∈R. In the propagator, kL = P
i∈L ki denotes the (undeformed,
oﬀ-shell) momentum, whereas the amplitudes are evaluated on the on-shell deformed momentum
ˆkL = P
i∈L ki + zL q with zL = −k2
L/2q · kL. See also ﬁg. 2 for a diagrammatic represenation of the
recursion. For particles transforming in non-trivial representations of the little group, the BCFW shift
(7.1) has to be extended to the polarization vectors as well [48], and the boundary terms vanish if the
shift vector qµ is chosen to align with the polarization vector of one of the shifted particles, qµ = e1 µ.
In this case the sum over partitions in the BCFW recursion relation (7.3) also includes a sum over
a complete set of propagating states, labeled for example by their polarization data for gluons or
gravitons.
The recursion (7.3) has been a useful tool to prove novel amplitude representations. In particular,
it guarantees that any expression satisfying factorization17 and the boundary condition (7.2) is a
representation of the amplitude. In §7.1 we adapt the shift to our formulae, in §7.2, we show that our
amplitudes factorize correctly, and in §7.3 we verify that our boundary terms (7.2) vanish.

The BCFW shift for 6d spinors
The higher dimensional BCFW-shifts discussed in the literature (e.g. [19, 48, 49]) are ambidextrous,
and this makes it diﬃcult to verify that the boundary terms vanish. We need to adapt (7.1) to the
spinor-helicity formalism in 6d. Such shifts were introduced in Ref. [19], but, as discussed in appendix
A.2, this does not sit naturally within the framework of the chiral scattering equations. We therefore
introduce a novel BCFW shift to start the recursion in the 6d spinor-helicity formalism. Our shift
vector qµ does not coincide with the polarization vector e1 µ, but is instead related to the chiral
polarization data of both shifted particles 1 and n.
Fundamental spinors.
We choose instead the following chiral BCFW shift, dependent on the
(chiral) polarization data of the shifted particles:
ˆκa
1A = κa
1A + z ϵa
1 ϵnA ,
ˆκa
nA = κa
nA + z ϵa
n ϵ1A .
(7.4)
This shift evidently leaves the polarization spinors ϵA invariant, but shifts the spinors ⟨v1κ1 A⟩and
⟨vnκn A⟩featuring in the polarized scattering equations by a term proportional to the polarization
spinor of the other particle,
⟨v1ˆκ1 A⟩= ⟨v1κ1 A⟩+ zϵnA ,
ˆϵ1A = ϵ1A ,
(7.5a)
⟨vnˆκn A⟩= ⟨vnκn A⟩+ zϵ1A ,
ˆϵnA = ϵnA .
(7.5b)
The invariance of the polarization spinors ϵ1,n ensures that the shift is well-deﬁned, in the sense that
the ‘shift-spinors’ δκa
1A ≡ϵa
1 ϵnA and δκa
nA ≡ϵa
n ϵ1A are themselves unaﬀected. This mirrors the usual
BCFW shift, where the vector qµ does not transform. It is easily seen that the spinorial deformation
(7.4) is indeed a valid vectorial BCFW shift (7.1). However, in contrast to the usual construction the
shift vector qAB is composed of the polarization spinors of both particles 1 and n,
qAB = 2ϵn [Aϵ1 B] .
(7.6)
It is clear that the shift preserves momentum conservation from the vector representation (7.1), and
it preserves Maxwell’s equations by construction. Since the shift vector qAB is constructed from the
polarization spinors of both particles, it is not only orthogonal to the momenta of the shifted particles,
q2 = q · k1 = q · kn = 0, but also to their polarization vectors e1 and en, q · e1 = q · en = 0. We will
verify in §7.3 that this deﬁnes a ‘good’ BCFW shift, in the sense that the boundary terms vanish for
Yang-Mills theory and gravity. We discuss the comparison with shifts of other authors in appendix A.2.

Anti-fundamental spinors.
We will see that the chiral BCFW shift (7.4) ties in well with
the polarized scattering equations. However, for ambidextrous theories such as super Yang-Mills or
supergravity however, the shift for spinors in the anti-fundamental representation plays an equally
important role. The anti-fundamental shift
ˆkAB

ˆkAB

(7.7)
is of course related to the chiral one via qAB = εABCDqCD, but this does not fully determine the shift of
the anti-chiral spinors ˆκA
˙a. We will use this freedom to choose a BCFW shift where both deformations
δκA

The ﬁrst term corresponds to the canonical choice for ˜ϵA
1, constructed in complete analogy to (A.13),
where we have chosen the reference spinor κ∗= κn. The second term is similarly the canonical choice
for ˜ϵA
n with reference spinor κ∗= κ1.
Due to this choice of reference spinor, the second term is
proportional to κA
1 ˙a, and is thus pure gauge for particle 1. An analogous argument shows that the ﬁrst
term is pure gauge for particle n. Thus we can choose ˜ϵA
1 = ˜ϵA and ˜ϵA
n = ˜ϵA, and we have the useful
relations
˜ϵA κa
1A = ϵa
1 ,
˜ϵA κa
nA = ϵa
n .
(7.10)
The anti-fundamental BCFW deformation then leads to the standard shift (7.7) for the momenta, but
where the shift vector q is again determined by the chiral polarization spinors of both shifted particles,
qAB = 2˜ϵ[Ak
B]C
1
ϵn C = −2˜ϵ[AkB]C
n ϵ1 C .
(7.11)
The latter equality follows from the deﬁnition of ˜ϵA and the relations (7.10).19 Using the same identi-
ties, it is also readily veriﬁed that qAB indeed satisﬁes qABεABCD = qCD as claimed above.
While not manifest in (7.8), the ‘shift-spinors’ (deﬁned by ˆκ1,n

are themselves invariant under the BCFW deformation. To see this, let us focus on δκ1
A
˙a, and recall
that ϵnB is unaﬀected by the shift. Then (ϵn Bκ1
B
˙a) does not transform because ˜ϵA is orthogonal to ϵnA
as we have seen in (7.10), so the only deformation can come from ˜ϵA itself. To see how ˜ϵA behaves
under BCFW, it is useful to rewrite its deﬁnition (7.9) as
˜ϵA = −
1

(7.13)
18The choice of ˜ϵA in the anti-fundamental shift will turn out to be crucial in proving that the boundary terms vanish.
However, it is also the key distinction from previously deﬁned shifts like the covariant shift of [19]. We discuss this in
more detail in appendix A.2.

In this form, the relations (7.10) are manifest, and it is clear that it transforms at most linearly in z
because the denominator is invariant due to q · k1 = q · kn = 0. However, neither of the polarization
spinors ϵ1B and ϵnB transform, and
qABϵ1B = ˜ϵ[Ak

ϵnCϵ1B = 0 .
(7.14)
Therefore ˜ϵA as well as the shift-spinors δκ1
A
˙a and δκn

˙a are invariant under the BCFW deformation,
and the shift (7.8) is well-deﬁned.
Shifting the supermomenta.
In the R-symmetry preserving supersymmetry representation, the
supershift is not implemented via a linear shift in the fermionic variables, but rather by a multiplicative
exponential factor
In →ˆIn exp
 −z q1IqnJΩIJ
.
(7.15)
This is clearly the fermionic Fourier transform of the standard linear super-BCFW shift in the little-
group preserving representation, see e.g. Ref. [49]. As expected, the Fourier Transform interchanges
linear shifts of the variables in z with a multiplication by an exponential factor.
To see this explicitly, consider the amplitude in the little-group preserving representation of
eq. (2.50), obtained from the R-symmetry representation via a fermionic half-Fourier transform as
discussed in section 4.2,

On the right, we have grouped the fermionic variables into a little-group spinor ηl
a, with ηl
iϵ = ⟨ϵiηl

and ηl
ξi = ⟨ξiηl

ˆηla

(7.17)
Our discussion from the polarized scattering equations is then directly applicable to the fermionic case:
only ⟨v1,nˆη1,n⟩are shifted, while ⟨ϵ1,nˆη1,n⟩remain invariant. In particular, all z-dependence resides in
the delta-functions

(7.18)
We can then transform back to the R-symmetry preserving representation, where the z-dependent
terms combine to give the exponential of (7.15), while the other terms give back the usual supersym-
metry factor eF . 20 We thus conclude that the BCFW shift amounts to the insertion of an exponential
20It is of course suﬃcient to only transform the fermionic variables in 1 and n to see this. Alternatively, we can also
choose to perform a full fermionic Fourier transform on only one of the particles, e.g. n,

This clearly comes at the expense of having to treat the two shifted particles diﬀerently. In this case, we choose the
following BCFW shift for the new fermionic variables ηn:
ˆηI
n = ηI

(7.20)
After transforming back to the R-symmetry breaking representation, this leads to the same exponential factor.

the chiral nature of the spinorial shift, it is only necessary to shift the chiral supermomenta, so no
corresponding factor exp

appears in the integrand.
Reduction to 4d.
Under dimensional reduction, the 6d shift (7.4) reduces to the well-known BCFW
shift in four dimensions. To see this, consider the case where the particles 1 and n have negative and
positive helicity respectively. In the conventions of section 6.2, this can be embedded into 6d via
ϵ1a = (0, ϵ1) ,
ϵna = (˜ϵn, 0) .
(7.21)
The six-dimensional shift (7.4) for fundamental spinors then reduces straightforwardly to the usual
BCFW shift in four dimensions,

up to the manifest scale ϵ1˜ϵn in the polarization data, which could be absorbed into z. The shift vector
qα ˙α = ϵ1α˜ϵn ˙α again agrees with the usual choice up to the polarization-dependent scale ϵ1˜ϵn. Proving
that the shift of the anti-fundamental spinors gives the same results is a little more involved due to
δκA
1,n ∼˜ϵA (rather than δκA
1 ∼˜ϵA
1 and δκA
n ∼˜ϵA
n respectively). Using the deﬁnition (7.13) for ˜ϵA, we

(7.23)
Inserting this into (7.8) then leads to the following shift for the anti-fundamental spinors;

To see that this gives the same four-dimensional shift, note that the oﬀ-diagonal entries are proportional
to κα

of κA

Moreover, since one of the oﬀ-diagonal terms always vanishes, this little group
transformation leaves the diagonal entries unaﬀected, and we get21

in agreement with our result from the chiral spinors (7.24). Above, we have used ≃to indicate that the

group rotation to bring ˆκA

7.2
Factorization
For scattering-equations-based amplitude representations, it is well-known that factorization of the
momenta arises from factorization of the of the moduli-space M0,n of n-points on the Riemann-sphere
modulo Mobius transformations [50]. The boundary ∂M0,n of M0,n consists of loci where a collection
of points σi for i ∈L come together at a point. This is understood geometrically as a limit where the
Riemann surface Σ = CP1 decomposes into two CP1s, ΣL and ΣR joined at a node, with the σi, i ∈L
on ΣL and the rest on ΣR. We denote by c
M0,n the Deligne-Mumford compactiﬁcation of the moduli
space of marked Riemann surfaces [51], obtained by including such nodal surfaces of genus zero, with
arbitrarily many components and nodes, but with at least 3 marked points/nodes on each component.
Singularities in the integrand In for any theory only depend on the kinematic data via polynomials.
All poles in the formula stem from those in the σij and ⟨uiuj⟩which come from the boundary of the
moduli space ∂Mpol
0,n. Here the moduli space Mpol
0,n encodes the locations of the punctures σi as well
as the values for ui, vi, modulo the symmetry group SL(2, C)σ × SL(2, C)u. However, the additional
boundary components in Mpol
0,n correspond to spurious singularities involving the polarization data
as seen for example in (5.20) and other formulae in §5. But, for super Yang-Mills and supergravity
theories, we have proven linearity of det ′H in the polarization data in §4.5. Thus, all poles of the
integrand originate from boundaries of the moduli space of the Riemann sphere ∂c
M0,n ⊂∂Mpol
0,n.
At tree level, ∂c
M0,n is the union of components ∂L,Rc
M0,n that correspond to separating degener-
ations that split the sphere Σ into two components, ΣL and ΣR partitioning the punctures into L ∪R,
with R the complement of L so n = nL + nR,
∂L,Rc
M0,n ≃c
M0,nL+1 × c
M0,nR+1 .
(7.27)
The component ∂L,Rc
M0,n can be parametrized by gluing two Riemann spheres ΣL and ΣR as follows.
Choose a marked point on each sphere, σR ∈ΣR and xL ∈ΣL, and remove the disks |σ −σR| < ε1/2
and |x −xL| < ε1/2, where ε is the parameter governing the degeneration. Then we can form a single
Riemann surface by identifying,
(x −xL) (σ −σR) = ε .
(7.28)
The component ∂L,Rc
M0,n corresponds to the limiting case ε →0. Often we simplify this degeneration
by choosing xL = ∞, where (7.28) becomes
σ = σR + ε˜x, ,
with ˜x = x−1 .
(7.29)
Let us brieﬂy review how factorization works in the CHY formalism.
Lemma 7.1 Suppose that the marked points σi satisfy the scattering equations
Ei :=
X
j̸=i

σij

(7.30)
then {σi} ∈∂L,Rc
M0,n implies k2
L = 0 where kL = −P
i∈L ki.
Proof: This follows by inserting (7.28) into the following combination of the scattering equations

where the second equality holds to order O(ε) as the denominator is O(1) for j ∈R. □

Thus, in the degeneration limit kL is null, and the propagator goes on-shell.
The scattering
equations further ensure that the CHY measure dµCHY

mirrors the behaviour of the moduli space at
the boundary [50, 52],

Each ‘half integrand’ In for Yang-Mills theory and gravity – either a Pfaﬃan or a Parke-Taylor factor

Combining the measure and the integrand, we see that gravity and Yang-Mills amplitudes in the
CHY-representation factorize correctly, in accordance with (7.3).
In the rest of this section, we will follow a similar strategy to the one outlined above for the CHY
formalism, and ﬁrst establish the map between the polarized scattering equations and factorization
channels. Based on this, we determine how the measure dµpol
n
behaves on the boundary of the moduli
space. In line with the equivalence between the polarized measure and the CHY measure established
in section 3.2, we ﬁnd

The formulae based on the polarized scattering equations thus factorize as expected for super Yang-
Mills and supergravity amplitudes.

Factorisation of the polarized scattering equations.

Again, the second equality holds to order O(ϵ) in the degeneration parameter, and in the last equality,
we have introduced the spinor ϵa
RA := P
i∈L ua
i ϵiA. The relation (7.38) tells us that ⟨ϵR[AϵRB]⟩= O(ε),
so to leading order in ε, ϵa
RA factorizes into an SL(4) spinor and a little group spinor, ϵa
RA = ua
RϵRA for
some ua
R, ϵRA as desired. □
Corollary 7.1 In the degeneration limit, the original worldsheet spinor λ(σ) thus induces a spinor
λ(R)(σ) on the sphere ΣR, with

By an extension of the same argument, λ(σ) also induces a spinor λ(L)(σ) on the sphere ΣL, which
can be seen as follows. Since λ(σ) is a worldsheet spinor, the combination λ(σ)

In the CHY amplitude representation, the relation (7.31) makes it clear that the scattering equa-
tions map the boundary of the moduli space to a factorization channel of the amplitude. To see this
from (7.38), note that momentum conservation on each subsphere (encoded in the polarized scattering
equations) gives
kR AB = −
X
p∈R
kp AB = ϵR[A
X
p∈R
⟨upuR⟩
σpR

(7.43)
where we have used the form (7.37) of the polarized scattering equations on ΣR,
ϵp[AE(R)

q∈R
⟨upuq⟩
σpq
ϵp[AϵqB] + ⟨upuR⟩
σpR
ϵR[AϵpB] −kp AB = 0 ,
(7.44)
and the ﬁrst term does not contribute due to the antisymmetry in the SL(4) spinor index. The relations
(7.43) guarantees that to leading order in the degeneration parameter ε, the internal momentum kR
is on-shell, k2
R = O(ε), and the boundary of the moduli space indeed corresponds to a factorization
channel of the amplitude. The same reasoning can also be applied to the momentum kL on the sphere
ΣL,
kL AB = −

ϵp[AϵiB] = −kR AB ,
(7.45)
so kL goes on-shell as ε →0 and kL = −kR, as expected for a factorization channel. Here, the second
identity follows again from the polarized scattering equations on ΣL, the third from the degeneration
relations (7.41) for up and wi, and the last from the deﬁnition of ϵR and the relation (7.43) for kR.

The scaling weights in ε.
Before proceeding further, it is helpful to take a closer look at the scaling
in the parameter ε in the degeneration limit ε ≪1. Near the boundary of the moduli space, a marked
point i lies on the sphere ΣL if xiL ∼1 is of order one, and similarly a point p lies on ΣR if σpR ∼1.
Using the parametrization (7.28) of the degeneration, this gives immediately
i ∈L :
xiL ∼1 ,
σiR ∼ε ,
(7.46a)
p ∈R :
xpL ∼ε ,
σpR ∼1 .
(7.46b)
As a direct consequence, the separation xij ∼1 of two marked points i, j that lie on ΣL is of order one
in the degeneration limit (and σpq ∼1 for p, q on ΣL). Using proposition 3.2 on the spheres ΣL and ΣR,
we can also infer the scaling of little-group invariants constructed from u’s and w’s. Proposition 3.2
implies that there only exist solutions to the polarized scattering equations if all terms in ⟨wiλ(L)
A (xi)⟩
and ⟨upλ(R)
A (σp)⟩remain of order one. For points i, j ∈L and p, q ∈R, this means
i, j ∈L :
⟨wiwL⟩∼1 ,
⟨wiwj⟩∼1 ,
(7.47a)
p, q ∈R :
⟨upuR⟩∼1 ,
⟨upuq⟩∼1 ,
(7.47b)
and the order of all other contractions follows from the relation (7.41) between u and w and (7.46).22
We can further use the deﬁnitions of uR and wL to derive the order of the remaining spinor brackets:
from the dominant balance in ⟨uiuR⟩ϵRA, ⟨wpwL⟩ϵLA, ⟨upuR⟩ϵRA and ⟨wLuR⟩ϵRA, we ﬁnd respectively
i ∈L , p ∈R :
⟨uiuR⟩∼ε ,
⟨wpwL⟩∼ε ,
⟨uiup⟩∼1 ,
⟨uRwL⟩∼ε1/2 .
(7.48)
Summarizing the above discussion, we have seen that both the worldsheet spinor λ(σ)

We stress that in contrast to the CHY formalism, the polarized scattering equations do not contribute
powers of the degeneration parameter ε to the measure. As we will see below, the factor of ϵ2(nL−1)−1
instead comes entirely from the integration over the variables (σi, ui).
Factorization of the measure.
Armed with the insights on how the polarized scattering equations
behave on the boundary of the moduli space, let us now take a closer look at the measure. The
degeneration of the measure dn−3σ on the sphere is entirely analogous to the CHY case, but it
provides a good introduction and we will review it here for completeness.
For any values of the degeneration parameter, M¨obius invariance on the sphere allows us to ﬁx
three marked points, two of which we choose to lie on one subsphere in the limit ε ≪1, σp1, σp2 ∈ΣR,
22So, for example, ⟨uiwL⟩∼ε1/2 and ⟨uiwj⟩∼ε1/2.
– 56 –

and one on the other, xi1 ∈ΣL.23 At the boundary of the moduli space, we have the further freedom
to ﬁx the junction points σR, xL of the two spheres, as well as one additional point σi2 on ΣL. To
leading order in ε, the Jacobian Jm¨ob for this gauge ﬁxing becomes the Jacobian Jm¨ob
R
for gauging
{σp1, σp2, σR} ⊂ΣR, 24
Jm¨ob = σi1p1σp1p2σp2i1 = σRp1σp1p2σp2R = Jm¨ob
R
.
(7.51)
Together with the diﬀerentials Q
p∈R dσp, which descend directly to ΣR, this Jacobian gives the usual
M¨obius invariant measure on ΣR. For the punctures σi with i ∈L on the other hand, we ﬁnd from
(7.28)
dσi = −ε
x2

dxi ,
dσi2 =

(7.52)
Combining these factors gives both the correct diﬀerentials and the Jacobian Jm¨ob

for the measure
on ΣL after gauge-ﬁxing {xi1, xi2, xL}. Putting this all together, the measure on the moduli space of
marked Riemann spheres factorizes as

Consider next the part of the measure dependent on v. By the same argument as above, proposi-
tion 3.2 ensures that all vi for i = 1, . . . , n remain of order one throughout the degeneration. The part
of the measure involving v’s, including the delta-functions encoding the normalization, thus factorize
directly into the contributions on each subsphere,

(7.55)
In contrast to the measure dn−3σ for the punctures however, the right hand side of (7.55) does not yet
give the full v-dependence of the measure on ΣL and ΣR, because we are missing the contributions vL
and vR from the junction points. We will see later how these extra variables are deﬁned and in what
form they appear in the amplitude.
For the u-dependent part of the measure, it will again be convenient to ﬁrst work with a gauge-ﬁxed
measure, and restore gauge invariance on each sphere ΣL,R after factorization. In the same manner as
for the punctures σi, we gauge the SL(2, C)u by ﬁxing two moduli on ΣR and one on ΣL (c.f. (3.28))
up1a = (1 , 0) ,
⟨ui1u∗⟩= 0 ,
for p1 ∈R , i1 ∈L ,
(7.56)
23In the ambitwistor string, this has a particularly elegant interpretation in terms of picture changing operators. We
start out on the Riemann sphere with n vertex operators and n−3 picture changing operators. In the degeneration limit,
the only non-trivial assignment of these onto the two subspheres correlates the number of picture changing operators
with the number of vertex operators as described above. All other possibilities give zero after integration over the ghost
zero modes.
24While the degeneration appears to treat ΣL and ΣR diﬀerently, their roles can be interchanged by starting from a
parametrization of the sphere in x-coordinates instead of σ.

where u∗is an arbitrarily chosen reference spinor. For convenience, let us also introduce u⊥
∗, normalized
such that ⟨u∗u⊥
∗⟩= 1. The usual Faddeev-Popov procedure gives the Jacobian Ju = ⟨ui1up1⟩⟨up1u∗⟩,
and thus the u-part of the measure becomes

where we used that the ui transform as worldsheet spinors of the local bundles at σi, see (7.41). As
was the case for the marked points σi, this does not fully ﬁx the SL(2, C) gauge on each component
sphere at the boundary of the moduli space, and we have the further freedom to ﬁx both of the
‘junction moduli’ wL on ΣL, as well as one component of uR ∈ΣR. As above, the right side is not
yet in a recognizably factorized form, but misses components of the Jacobians for gauge-ﬁxing on the
subspheres, as well as the measure for one of the junction moduli d⟨uR u⊥
∗⟩.
For a full factorization of the measure, we are also still missing the delta-functions enforcing
the polarized scattering equations on the junction points, as well as an integral over the internal
momentum in the propagator, d6kL = d8κa
LA/vol SL(2, C). We introduce these, as well as all missing
factors discussed above, by inserting a conveniently chosen factor of 1, 25

(7.62)
25This is quickly checked: First note that a quick weight count in the spinors κL shows that the right hand side is
weightless in κL, and indeed the Faddeev-Popov Jacobian from ﬁxing the SL(2, C) freedom cancels against (part of) the
Jacobian from solving the scattering equations. We can make this explicit e.g. by ﬁxing κa
L0, as well as ϵL1. Then
JSL(2)κ = kL 01ϵL0 ,
J−1
pol = ε−1 ⟨uLwR⟩⟨wRu∗⟩kL 01ϵL0 ,
(7.58)
and thus the integral indeed gives one.
26We have chosen a little-group frame where κR = iκL to simplify the expression.
– 58 –

so that the nodal scattering equations are indeed consistent with our previous deﬁnitions. Note that
despite the factors of ε−1/2, the right side is of order one due to ⟨uLwR⟩∼ε1/2. The nodal scattering
equations thus imply that the variables (ϵL, vL) and (ϵR, vR) are related by
va
L = ε−1/2⟨uRwL⟩ϵa
R ,
va
R = −ε−1/2⟨uRwL⟩ϵa
L ,
(7.63)
and so the integration over vL and vR should be understood as an integration over the polarization
choices of the particle running through the cut propagator.
We can now combine the elaborate factor of 1 in (7.59) with the remaining part of the measure
as follows. It evidently provides the missing factors for the v-dependent part of the measure and the
polarized scattering equations to factorize correctly, as well as the missing measure d⟨uLu⊥
∗⟩for the
u-dependent part. Using a Schouten identity and dropping terms of subleading order in ε, we can
further combine the factors ⟨wi1up1⟩⟨up1u∗⟩from the measure and ⟨uRwL⟩⟨wLu∗⟩from (7.59) to give
the missing Jacobians for gauge-ﬁxing the u’s and w’s on ΣL,R,
⟨wi1wL⟩⟨up1uR⟩⟨up1u∗⟩⟨wLu∗⟩= Ju

(7.64)

Factorization of the integrands
Parke-Taylor factors and the reduced determinants.
The Parke-Taylor factors factorize as
usual; when all punctures i ∈L are consecutive in the colour-ordering α, then
PT(α) = ε−(nL−1) Y
i∈L
x2
iL PT(αL)PT(αR) ,
(7.67)
where PT(αL) denotes the Parke-Taylor factor on the ΣL, with the ordering αL = α

L ∪xL. If the
marked points i ∈L do not appear in a consecutive order in α, the pole is of lower order of ε, and
there is no factorization in this channel.
The factorization of the reduced determinant is similarly straightforward. On the boundary of the
moduli space, its components are given by
Hij = xiLxjL

ϵiAϵA

Hip = ϵiAϵA

Hpi = ϵpAϵA

Hpq = ϵpAϵA

(7.68)
Due to the permutation invariance of the reduced determinant, we can make a convenient choice and
remove one row and column from each side, i1, i2 ∈L and p1, p2 ∈R,
det ′H =
det H[i1p1]

(7.69)
– 59 –

In the last step, we have identiﬁed the leading term in ε as determinants of HL and HR respectively, with
the rows and columns associated to xL and σR removed. Using the Schouten identity ⟨wi1up1⟩⟨uRwL⟩=
⟨wi1wL⟩⟨up1uR⟩(to leading order in ε), as well as the relations (7.63), the reduced determinant becomes

(7.70)
To see that this is the correct factorization behaviour for the bosonic case, let us compare (7.70) to
the sum over states. To implement this sum in our framework, we introduce again a global basis for
the little group space of the internal particle. With ϵa
L and ϵa
R as deﬁned above, it is natural to choose
the other basis elements (on each component sphere)

L =

L
⟨ϵLϵR⟩,
(7.71)
i.e. we choose the same basis (ϵL, ξL) (up to normalization constants) for both the left and the right
component sphere. Consider now the amplitude An := Aϵ1˜ϵ1...
n
with all external particles in states at
the top of the multiplet.27 Then the sum over states reads
X

AnL+1AnR+1 = εabε˙a˙b Aa˙a

[˜ϵL˜ϵR] AξL ˜ξL
nL+1AξR ˜ξR
nR+1 .
In the second equality, we have used the deﬁnition (7.71) of the little group basis choice for the in-
ternal particle, and contracted the polarization data back into the amplitudes. While this does not
yet look reminiscent of the factorization property (7.70), let us take a closer look at the amplitudes
AξL˜ϵL
nL+1 etc., arising from contracting ξL or ξR in the respective subamplitudes. Using either the super-
symmetry representation or the results of §4.4, the (half-) integrand of these amplitudes is given by28
det ′H ⟨ξLvL⟩. However, due to (7.63), va
L = ξa
L, and so all of these amplitudes vanish,
AξL˜ϵL
nL+1 = AϵL ˜ξL
nL+1 = AξL ˜ξL
nL+1 = 0 ,
(7.73)
and similarly for AnR+1.
The sum over states thus simpliﬁes drastically, and only the ﬁrst term
contributes,

AnL+1AnR+1 =

(7.74)
Thus the reduced determinant indeed factorizes as expected for gluon amplitudes, c.f. (7.70).
The sum over states in the supersymmetry representation.
Before discussing factorization
of the full supersymmetric amplitudes, let us ﬁrst derive an expression for the sum over states as an
integral over the fermionic variables of propagating particle. For readability, we focus on the chiral
case below, all statements extend straightforwardly to N = (N, ˜N) supersymmetry. In general, these
fermionic integrals take the form
An = 1
k2
L
Z
d2NqLd2NqR AnL+1AnR+1 G(qL, qR)
(7.75)
27For readability, we suppress the ϵ- indices for external particles below.
28The other integrands are Ih = det ′H [˜ξL˜vL] for AϵL ˜ξL
nL+1 and Ih = det ′H ⟨ξLvL⟩[˜ξL˜vL] for AξL ˜ξL
nL+1 respectively.
– 60 –

where G(qL, qR) is a ‘gluing factor’ for the internal propagator that depends on the choice of super-
symmetry representation, and is determined – up to an overall normalization– by supersymmetric
invariance. This can be seen as follows. The left hand side of (7.75) vanishes under the full supersym-
metry generator QAI. Using further that
QAIAnL+1 = −QL AIAnL+1 ,
QAIAnR+1 = −QR AIAnR+1 ,
QAI G(qL, qR) = 0 ,
(7.76)
due to the supersymmetric invariance of the amplitudes on the right, we ﬁnd that G has to satisfy

Factorization of the supersymmetry factors.
Given that the measure and the integrands fac-
torize correctly, we can isolate the supersymmetry factors in the relation (7.81). To prove that the
superamplitudes factorize correctly, we thus need to show that at the boundary of the moduli space

Z
d2NqLd2NqR eFL+FR ei⟨ϵLϵR⟩−1 qLIqRJ ΩIJ ,
(7.82)
29We can see this as follows.
Using the explicit form of the supersymmetry representation, the condition (7.77)
contains two terms proportional to ϵL and ϵR respectively, CL + CR = 0, with
CL =

Then we can straightforwardly integrate out qR in CL (and qL in CR) using the ansatz (7.78) for G and the vanishing of
the local terms in the supersymmetry factors at the node ⟨ξLvL⟩= ⟨ξRvR⟩= 0, and conﬁrm that indeed CL = CR = 0.
30As discussed above, these terms vanish if all external particles are in the top state of the multiplet.

where, we have used that exp(⟨ξRvR⟩q2

we use a Schouten identity and the relations (7.63) for the polarization spinors of the propagating
particle to obtain to leading order

(7.85)
The exponent thus agrees with (7.83), and so our formulae (2.50) factorize as expected of amplitudes
in super Yang-Mills theory and supergravity.
As an aside, we give an alternative way of deriving the factorization of the supersymmetry factors
that mirrors the bosonic discussion of the polarized scattering equations more closely. First, note that
the delta-functions in the ﬁrst line of (7.84) can be solved in analogy to the bosonic case (7.38) by
ua

(7.86a)

wa
p qpI + θa
LI ,
⟨uRθLI⟩= 0 .
(7.86b)
Here the 2N conditions imposed by the delta-functions have been replaced by 4N constraints, but
supplemented by 2N degrees of freedom encoded in θL and θR. We can now solve the constraints
⟨wLθRI⟩= 0 by taking θa
RI = αR wa
LθRI, and similarly for θL. For convenience, we have deﬁned θR to be
of order one, and kept a normalization factor αR explicit. Contracting the resulting relations into ui
(or wp respectively) gives the dominant balance αR = ε1/2, and so we are left with
ua
R qRI =

(7.87)
on support of the delta-functions. The exponent then directly gives the correct factorization (7.82).
31The ‘hat’-notation is intended as a reminder that these are not yet the factors FL and FR for the subamplitudes
since they do not include the contributions from the junction point.

Factorization of Pf ′A and the M5 half-integrand Ih
M5.
While the brane theories are not known
to satisfy a BCFW recursion, the above treatment of the intergands can be extended easily to prove
that the M5 and D5 amplitudes factorize correctly. It would be interesting to extend this to a full soft
recursion as introduced in [53], but this is beyond the scope of this paper.
Let us ﬁrst consider the Pfaﬃan Pf ′A. On a boundary ∂L,RM0,n, the matrix entries become
Aij = xiLxjL
ε
ki · kj
xij
,
Aip = ki · kp
σRp
,
Aip = kp · kq
σpq
.
(7.88)
If nL, nR are odd (so the subamplitudes AnL+1 and AnR+1 have an even number of particles), it is
convenient to deﬁne Pf ′A by reducing on i ∈L, p ∈R. Since the block-matrix proportional to ε−1 is
of even rank nL −1, the reduced Pfaﬃan then factorizes as
Pf ′A = (−1)i+p
σip
Pf A[ip] = ε−1
2 (nL−1) Y
j∈L
xjL Pf ′AL Pf ′AR .
(7.89)
Here, the powercounting of ε is due to the removed row and column i ∈L.
On the other hand, if nL, nR are even, i.e. we are studying factorization channels into subam-
plitudes with an odd number of particles, it is still convenient to reduce on i ∈L, p ∈R to avoid
leading-order cancellations. In contrast to the odd case however, the factorization now involves a sum
over states as shown in [50], and the leading order term gives Pf ′A ∼ε−(
nL
2 −1). For amplitudes with
half-integrand Ih
n = det ′A, there are thus no factorization channels with odd-point subamplitudes,
and for nL even, we indeed ﬁnd
det ′A = ε−(nL−1) Y
j∈L
x2
jL det ′AL det ′AR ,
(7.90)
as expected for half-integrands.
The calculation of the factorization of Pf U (2,0) featuring in the M5 half-integrand is more involved
due to the structure of its entries, and we have delegated the discussion to appendix appendix A.3.
The ﬁnal property for odd nL however is very compact,
Pf U (2,0) = ε
nL−1
2
⟨ϵLϵR⟩2
Q
j∈L xjL
Pf U (2,0)
L

(7.91)
and gives the following factorization of the M5 half-integrand,
Ih
M5 = ε−(nL−1)
Q
j∈L x2
jL
⟨ϵLϵR⟩2
Ih
M5,L Ih
M5,R .
(7.92)
Repeating the arguments used in the factorization of the reduced determinant det ′H, the only non-
vanishing contribution to sum over states comes from the top of the multiplet, in agreement with
(7.92). We thus conclude that the brane amplitudes also factorize correctly.
As discussed above, for the brane theories factorization into odd-point subamplitudes is ruled out
by the presence of det ′A in the integrand. On the other hand, the novel formulae in the web of theories
in table 1 are composed of Ih
M5 with another half-integrand that supports factorization channels with
odd-particle subamplitudes (such as the Parke-Taylor factor for the (2, 0)−PT formulae). From this
– 63 –

perspective, we would also like to study the factorization of Ih
M5 for even nL. A straightforward counting
shows that in that case Pf U (2,0) ∼ε
nL
2 , so Ih
M5 does give a non-zero contribution to factorization
channels with even nL. While it would be interesting to pursue this further to gain some insights into
the (2, 0)−PT formulae, or construct odd-particle versions, this is beyond the scope of this paper.
7.3
Boundary terms
As we have seen in §7.2 and §5.1, the formulae (2.50) based on the polarized scattering equations
factorize correctly, and reproduce the correct three-particle Yang-Mills and gravity amplitudes. To
demonstrate that they satisfy the BCFW recursion relation – and are thus representations of the
tree-level amplitude – we still need to show that the boundary terms in the BCFW recursion relation
vanish,
lim
z→∞A(z) = 0 .
(7.93)
We will follow a similar strategy to the one employed in the discussion of factorization, and discuss
ﬁrst how the polarized scattering equations and the measure behave under the BCFW deformation
(7.4) and (7.8),

(7.94b)
As expected from the equivalence of the polarized measure dµpol

and the CHY-measure dµCHY
n
, we
ﬁnd that the measure scales as z−2,
lim
z→∞dµpol
n
= z−2d˜µpol
n
,
(7.95)
and thus only integrands scaling at most as In ∼z as z →∞can give vanishing boundary terms. In
the case of super Yang-Mills theory and supergravity, we ﬁnd that eF + ˜
F ∼z0, and det′ H ∼z0 while
PT(α) ∼z for colour-ordered partial amplitudes where the shifted particles 1 and n are adjacent, and
PT(α) ∼z0 otherwise. Putting this together, the supergravity and super Yang-Mills expressions scale
as
M(z) ∼z−2 ,
A(z) ∼z−1 ,
(7.96)
in the large-z limit, so the boundary terms vanish in both cases. We conclude that the formulae based
on the polarized scattering equations satisfy the BCFW recursion relation, and thus give representa-
tions of the respective tree-level amplitudes.
7.3.1
The polarized scattering equations
Polarized scattering equations and measure.
A crucial feature of the BCFW deformation of
the fundamental spinors is that it leaves the polarization spinors ϵ1,n of the shifted particles invariant.
The polarized scattering equations are thus unaﬀected for all particles i ̸= 1, n, and become
ˆEi =
X
j
⟨uiuj⟩
σij
ϵjA −⟨viκiA⟩,
(7.97a)

(7.97c)
– 64 –

In the large-z limit, the scattering equations E1 and En require that σ1n ∼z−1 while ⟨u1un⟩∼1
remains of order one. We can reﬁne this dominant balance by explicitly solving for the diﬀerence
σn1 = z−1⟨unu1⟩to leading order, which suggests the following change of variables:
σn = σ1 + z−1⟨unu1⟩+ z−2yn ,
(7.98)
The shifted polarized scattering equations are indeed manifestly independent of z when expressed in
terms of the variables σ1 and yn,32

(7.99c)
Let us deﬁne a new polarized measure d˜µpol
n
in analogy to (2.32), but now using the z-independent
scattering equations (7.99) as well as the new variable yn specifying the marked point σn. Then the
shifted measure dˆµpol
n
obeys
lim
z→∞dˆµpol
n
= z−2d˜µpol
n
,
(7.100)
due to dσn = z−2 dyn. This makes is clear that only theories with integrands scaling at most as In ∼z
for large z will have vanishing boundary terms in the BCFW recursion relation.
Anti-chiral scattering equations.
While the anti-chiral equivalent to the polarized scattering
equations does not play a prominent role in the amplitude expressions, we will need the behaviour
of the variables ˜u˙a
i to determine the scaling behaviour of the integrands. On support of the chiral
polarized scattering equations, the marked points σ1 and σn factorize in the large-z limit,
σn = σ1 + z−1⟨unu1⟩+ z−2yn .
(7.101)
Using this, the anti-chiral scattering equations are given to order O(z) by

˜ϵA .
Due to the terms proportional to z2 as well as the diﬀerent spinors in ˆE1 and ˆEn, the only dominant
balance for this set of equations is [˜u1˜un] ∼z−1. We will parametrize this balance by
˜u˙a
n = [ ˜wn˜un]
[ ˜wn˜u1] ˜u˙a
1 + z−1 ˜w ˙a
n .
(7.102)
32We have omitted higher order terms in z−1 in ˆEi and ˆEn.

Together with the normalization condition [v1ϵ1] = 1, the leading order of ˆE1 determines v1 to order
one; in other words we can set v1 = v∗
1 + z−1˜v1 where E1

O(z)(v∗
1) = 0, and similarly for vn. All
remaining scattering equations ˆEi are solved to leading order by
˜u˙a
n = −(ϵnB ϵ1

(ϵ1C ϵnC) ˜u˙a
1 + z−1 ˜w ˙a

(7.104)
Changing variables to {σi, ˜u˙a

i } for i ̸= 1, n and {σ1, ˜u˙a
1, ˜v ˙a
1} and {yn, ˜w ˙a
n, ˜v ˙a
n} thus renders the
anti-chiral scattering equations manifestly independent of z as z ≫1.
7.3.2
Supersymmetry
As discussed in section 7.1, in the R-symmetry preserving supersymmetry representation the supershift
is implemented via multiplication by an exponential factor
eF + ˜
F →e
ˆ
F + ˜
F = eF −z q1IqnJ ΩIJ e

(7.105)
rather than a linear shift in the fermionic variables.
From the solutions to the antifundamental
polarized scattering equations (7.104), it is easily checked that ˜F remains of order one in the limit
z →∞, so the only z-dependent term is proportional to ⟨u1un⟩/σ1n −z. On the support of the
polarized scattering equations (7.98), this combination remains of order one, and as a consequence, so
does ˆF;
ˆF = 1

⟨u1un⟩2 q1IqnJΩIJ .
(7.106)
The supersymmetry factors are thus of order one in the large-z-limit, eF + ˜
F ∼z0.
Alternatively,
this can be seen from the little-group preserving representation, where the fermionic-delta functions
(2.49) and the shift (7.17) manifestly mirror the polarized scattering equations. As z →∞, the same
argument as for the polarized scattering equations thus guarantees that the delta-functions remain of
order one.
7.3.3
The integrand
The Parke-Taylor factor.
The large-z limit for the colour half-integrand PT(α) is familiar from
the original d-dimensional CHY amplitude representation. Since the Parke-Taylor factor only depend
on the moduli of the marked Riemann sphere, its behaviour as z →∞is determined by (7.98).
σn = σ1 + z−1⟨unu1⟩+ z−2yn .
(7.107)
For colour-ordered Parke-Taylor factors, we thus ﬁnd
c
PT(α) ≡

so the colour half-integrands are of order z if the legs 1 and n are adjacent in the colour-ordering α
and of order z0 otherwise.
The reduced determinant.
In contrast to the Parke-Taylor factor, the reduced determinant det ′ ˆH
depends on z not only via the marked points σ1n ∼z−1, but also via the anti-chiral spinors ˆϵA
1 and
ˆϵA
n. There is however no chiral contribution of order z since ˆϵ1 A = ϵ1 A and ˆϵn A = ϵn A, and so all
z-dependence stems from the columns 1 and n,

(7.110b)
which uniquely determines ˆH11 and ˆHnn from linearity relations (2.53) among the columns of ˆH. We
remark that all remaining diagonal entries ˆHii are independent33 of z, as can be seen from the (row)
linearity relation
⟨uiun⟩ˆHii = −
X
j̸=n,i
⟨ujun⟩ˆHji = −
X
j̸=n,i
⟨ujun⟩Hji ,
(7.111)
which is manifestly of order one. All z-dependence of ˆH is thus conﬁned to the columns 1 and n,
suggesting that we deﬁne the reduced determinant by removing these columns. Naively this would
imply det ′ ˆH ∼z because of the denominator factor [˜u1˜un] = z−1[˜u1 ˜wn], but its coeﬃcient vanishes,
as can be seen from a judicious choice of row and column operations on ˆH.34 In practice, however,
it is easier to extract the large-z behaviour by using row- and column operations to remove the z-
dependence from one of the two columns, say column 1, and reduce on a diﬀerent column.
To make this explicit, let us construct a new matrix ˆH′ whose column 1 is independent of z (apart
from ˆH′
11 and ˆH′
n1, which will still be removed),
ˆH′

˜w′ ˙a
n = ˜u˙a

(7.112)
Due to lemma 4.2, the reduced determinants agree, det ′H′ = det ′H, and in particular so do their
large-z-limits. But by construction, H′ only depends on z via the n-th column and the entries H1n
and Hnn, so we can manifestly remove all dependence on z by reducing on the rows 1 and n and the
columns i ̸= 1 and n,
det ′ ˆH = det ′ ˆH′ =

(7.113)
The expression on the right hand side is now manifestly of order O(z0).
33Here and below, independence of z refers to the large-z limit, and thus only entails independence to order z0, with
possible contributions of order z−1 that vanish as z →∞.
34Recall from lemma 4.2 that the reduced determinant is invariant under row and column operations.

Yang-Mills theory and gravity.
Over the last section, we derived that
eF + ˜
F ∼z0 ,
X
α∈Sn/Zn
PT(α) ∼z ,
det ′H ∼z0 ,
(7.114)
in the large-z limit. Combining this with the behaviour of the measure, we ﬁnd that the boundary
terms in supergravity and super Yang-Mills both vanish as expected,
M(z) ∼z−2 ,
A(z) ∼z−1 .
(7.115)
This completes the BCFW-recursion proof of our formulae.
As a brief aside, we mention here the curious observation that our brane formulae also do not re-
ceive boundary contributions in the BCFW recursion, despite their poor behaviour for large momenta.
Though we are not aware of a discussion of this in the literature, this is also true for the D-brane
amplitudes in the usual CHY–framework, and just relies on the additional observation that Pf ′A ∼z0
in the large-z limit, which in turn follows from similar row- and column operations on A as are used
on M to show that Pf ′M ∼z0. It would be interesting to investigate this cancellation from the ﬁeld
theory perspective.

Discussion
In this article we have argued that the polarized scattering equations provide a natural generalization
of the twistor and ambitwistor supersymmetric formulae from four dimensions. They lead to formulae
for a full spectrum of supersymmetric gauge, gravity and brane theories in six-dimensions. These
formulae are furthermore shown to factorize properly as a consequence of properties of the polarized
scattering equations themselves, as described in §7.2.1. This led to a proof of the main formulae by
BCFW recursion.
There remain issues that are not optimally resolved in our framework. Because the solutions to
the polarized scattering equations themselves depend on the polarization data, it is no longer obvious
that the formulae we obtain are linear in each polarization vector as they need to be, although the
proof is relatively straightforward. As shown in §3, there is an n + 2 dimensional vector space of
potential solutions to the polarized scattering equations whose dimensionality is then then reduced by
choice of polarization spinors. It should be possible to develop this further to produce formulae that
are manifestly linear in the polarization data, or alternatively with free little-group indices as is more
usually in higher-dimensional spinor-helicity frameworks.
There remain many avenues for further development and investigation. One is the treatment of
massive amplitudes in four and perhaps ﬁve dimensions. Here there is ongoing work both by the
authors of this paper and [54], who further apply these to construct formulae for loop amplitudes for
brane and other theories in four dimensions. Further avenues are as follows.
Grassmannians, polyhedra, and equivalence with other formulations.
In four dimensions,
twistor-string formulae for amplitudes, and indeed general BCFW terms, can be embedded as 2n −4-
dimensional cycles in the Grassmannian G(k, n) for amplitudes with k negative helicity particles,
[55, 56].
In [16] it was similarly shown that their 6d formulae could be embedded into a Lagrangian Grass-
mannian, i.e., the Grassmannian LG(n, 2n) of Lagrangian n-spaces in a symplectic 2n-dimensional
vector space. Ref. [21] further discussed how the polarized scattering equation formulation of [17]
– 68 –

and this paper can also be embedded in the same Grassmannian, allowing one to see that the two
formulations are essentially gauge equivalent representations. In the formulation in this paper, an
element of the Grassmannian can be represented as an n×2n matrix Cia
l
with a being the little group
index for ki and l being also a particle index.35 The symplectic form is given by Ωiajb = εabδij and
the condition that Cia
l
deﬁnes an element of the Lagrangian Grassmannian is that
Cia
l Cjb
mΩiajb = 0 .
(8.1)
This skew form is natural in the sense that it arises from momentum conservation in the form
κa
iAκb
jBΩiajb = 0 .
(8.2)
The Grassmannian integral formula then takes the form
Z
Γ
dµ I
Z Y
j
δ4(Cia
j κiaA) .
(8.3)
Here I is a theory dependent integrand, Γ a cycle in the Grassmannian of dimension 4n −6, and dµ
a measure on Γ. Our data embeds into the Grassmannian by
Cai
j = ⟨uiuj⟩
σij
ϵa
i −δi
jva
i ,
(8.4)
with Γ parametrized by (σi, ui, vi) subject to the constraints ⟨viϵi⟩= 1 and modulo the M¨obius
transformations on the σi, and SL(2) on the ui. A diﬀerent parametrization36 for Γ is given in [16],
and in [21] it was argued that the two representations are gauge equivalent in LG(n, 2n).
In this paper in §4.5, the argument for linearity of the reduced determinants in the polarization
data relies on a map between solutions to the polarized scattering equations that have diﬀerent po-
larization data. This map should therefore similarly arise from an analogous gauge transformation in
the Grassmannian LG(n, 2n).
Polyhedra such as the amplituhedron [57] emerge when BCFW cycles in a Grassmannian are
united into one geometric object whose combinatorics are determined by a certain positive geometry.
The original amplituhedron was adapted to momentum twistor or Wilson-loop descriptions of N = 4
super Yang-Mills amplitudes [58–60], but there is, at least as yet, no analogue of this in six dimensions.
The version of the 4d amplituhedron ideas that are most natural in the context of the Grassmannian
descriptions here is that described in [22], a 2n −4-dimensional space. It follows from the above that
the analogue in 6d should therefore be a 4n −6 dimensional space. In our context this space will then
be naturally embedded in R4n (perhaps projected onto some quotient) as the image of the positive
Lagrangian Grassmannian LG+(n, 2n) under the map
YlA = Cia
l κiaA .
(8.5)
There is of course an anti-chiral version also. It remains to explore these frameworks.
35For [16, 21] this l-index is replaced by ak where a is the global little group index, and k = 0, . . . , (n −2)/2 indexes
a basis in the space of polynomials on C of degree (n −2)/2.
36In the notation of those references, the 4n −6-cycles are parametrized by (σi, wb
ia) subject to a normalization of the
determinants of the W b
ia in terms of the σi.

Worldsheet models in 6d.
Another gap in our description is to identify ambitwistor string mod-
els that underly the formulae.
Ambitwistor-string models that admit vertex operators that yield
the polarized scattering equations and supersymmetry factors were introduced in [17], together with
worldsheet matter that provides the reduced determinants. However, these were chiral, and combining
both chiralities to produce the gauge and gravity formulae has so far proved problematic: there are
constraints needed to identify the two otherwise independent chiral halves. However, as seen here
such constraints dont seem to matter too much at the level of the formulae. The chiral models would
seem to be a better bet for the various (N, 0) theories, but for these the worldsheet matter required
to provide the integrands has yet to be identiﬁed. The issues facing the 6d worldsheet models are
resolved on reduction and we plan to write about this elsewhere.
Higher dimensions.
Representations of ambitwistor space, in terms of twistor coordinates with
little-group indices exist in higher dimensions also. Furthermore, naive ambitwistor models in those
coordinates lead to higher-dimensional analogues of the polarized scattering equations. A discussion
of such models was given in [61]. Again one can obtain supersymmetric ampltude formulae without
worrying too much about the detailed implementation of the models. In particular, there are many
more constraints required to restrict the representation to ambitwistor space as in the space of null
geodesics, and again these were not implemented in any systematic way. Indeed closely related models
were proposed over the years by Bandos and coworkers [30, 62–66]. Bandos takes the attitude that the
additional constraints should not be imposed, and instead that it should be possible to ﬁnd genuine
M-theory physics in these extra degrees of freedom [62, 67, 68].
Gerbe amplitudes.
In addition to the well understood gauge, gravity and brane formulae, we also
obtain more controversial formulae with (2, 0), (3, 1) and (4, 0) supersymmetry. The linear super-
multiplets are Gerbe-like analogues of YM and gravity theories in the sense that Gerbes, self-dual
closed 3-forms, appear in the multiplets. In particular in the (2, 0) case with the Parke-Taylor factor
in the integrand, there is an important and much studied theory with (2, 0) supersymmetry that one
might hope to say something about. This theory is expected to reduce to super-Yang-Mills in ﬁve
dimensions as indeed our (2, 0) formulae with a Parke-Taylor does for even numbers of particles. In
six dimensions however, this is thought to be a strongly coupled theory and so shouldnt give rise
to meaningful amplitudes. It has furthermore been argued that there are no invariant three point
amplitudes for such models in 6d [20].
On the other hand, the four point formulae has s and t
singularities (5.37), so that soft limits should give a nontrivial limit involving the 3-point amplitude.
Thus such soft limits are likely to be ambiguous and not make sense. Similar issues arise for the other
Gerbe-like theories with (3, 1) and (4, 0) supersymmetry. See §5.3 for more discussion and [16] where
for more detail in the context of the little-group preserving representation.
The amplitude formulae we obtain are problematic for odd particle number.
Being ratios of
Pfaﬃans of matrices whose size depends on the particle number n, one obtains zero divided by zero
for odd n and like the 3-particle case, might not have a sensible meaning. For the (N, N)-theories,
analogous formulae can also be obtained, but identities such as (2.57) allow us to obtain a well-deﬁned
non-zero formula when n is odd. Such relations also hold for the Gerbe theories reduced to 5d because
they coincide with the reductions of (N, N) theories. However, we have not been able to ﬁnd such
relations in 6d. Thus the prognosis for some physical interpretation of these formulae is not clear. Some
reasonable deﬁnition must be found for odd n that is compatible with factorization, see the discussion
after (7.92) for additional details. If so, a further test will be to investigate massive modes on reduction
to 5d as the R-symmetry of reduced (0, 2) massive modes is distinct from that of (1, 1) massive modes.
– 70 –

For massive modes the little group in 5d is still SO(4) with spin group SL(2)×SL(2). Thus the dotted
and undotted scattering equations remain distinct and there is no longer an identiﬁcation between the
U (a,b) for ﬁxed a + b. There is therefore no clear analogue of (6.10) so analogues of the odd-point
formulae for 5d massive modes reduced from 6d massless modes remain problematic.
There are speculations that such theories might play an important role in M-theory [34–37] so
despite all these issues, these formulae perhaps deserve further study as one of the few handles we
have on the possible interactions in such theories.

Direct proof of permutation invariance of H
As an alternative to the abstract proof in lemma 4.1, we can show directly that the reduced determinant
det ′H is permutation invariant by using row and column operations, as well as the constraints
X

i Hij = 0 ,
X
i
˜u˙a
i Hji = 0 .
(A.1)
Recall the deﬁnition (2.54) of the reduced determinant;
det ′(H) := (−1)i1+i2+j1+j2 det

H[i1i2]
[j1j2]

⟨ui1ui2⟩[uj1uj2] ,
(A.2)
where H[i1i2]
[j1j2] denotes the matrix H with rows i1 and i2 and columns j1 and j2 removed,
det

H[i1i2]
[j1j2]

=
∂2
∂Hi1j1∂Hi2j2
det(H) .
(A.3)
By deﬁnition, det ′(H) is s invariant under exchanging two particle labels i, j ̸= i1,2, j1,2, since the
determinant picks up a sign under each exchange of rows or columns. To prove permutation invariance,
we thus only need to show that the reduced determinants obtained from removing diﬀerent rows or
columns are identical. Moreover, it is clearly suﬃcient to consider the case of diﬀerent choices for
the row i2, all other cases are straightforward extensions. To be speciﬁc, consider det(H[1 2]
[n−1 n]) and
det(H[1 3]
[n−1 n]), and let us suppress the subscript [n−1 n] for the removed columns to keep the expressions
readable. Then the reduced determinant (A.2) is permutation invariant if
⟨u1u3⟩det

H[1 2]
= −⟨u1u3⟩det

H[1 2]
.
(A.4)
– 71 –

First, multiply the row in H[1 2] associated to particle 3 by ⟨u1u3⟩(and similarly for H[1 3]),
bH[1 2]
3i
= ⟨u1u3⟩H3i ,
bH[1 3]
2i
= ⟨u1u2⟩H2i .
(A.5)
The determinants of the hatted matrices are then related to the original determinants via
det

bH[1 2]
= ⟨u1u3⟩det

H[1 2]
,
det

bH[1 3]
= ⟨u1u2⟩det

H[1 3]
.
(A.6)
To compare the two determinants det bH[1 2] and det bH[1 3], proceed as follows: Multiply each row bH[1 2]
ji
associated to particle j ̸= 3 by ⟨u1uj⟩, and add it to the row bH[1 2]
3i
,
bH[1 2]
3i
=
X
j̸=1,2
⟨u1uj⟩Hji = −⟨u1u2⟩H2i = −bH[1 3]
2i
.
(A.7)
In the second equality, we have used the constraint (A.1), and the last identity follows from our
deﬁnitions above.
In particular, note that (A.7) holds for i = 2 as well, so there is no subtlety
associated to the diagonal entries. Since row and column operations leave the determinant invariant,
we can thus conclude that
det

bH[1 2]
= −det

bH[1 3]
,
(A.8)
and permutation invariance follows by using (A.6).
Note that we can easily use the same idea to show that det(H) = 0. In this case, we follow the
same steps as above, but now for the unreduced matrix H. Again, we deﬁne
bH2i = ⟨u∗u2⟩H2i ,
(A.9)
for any reference spinor u∗in the little group.
The determinants are again related by det bH =
⟨u∗u2⟩det (H). As before, we can use the constraint equations, together with convenient row opera-
tions on the matrix (adding ⟨u∗uj⟩Hji to bH2i). However, since no rows have been removed from the
matrix, this time we ﬁnd
bH2i =
X
j
⟨u∗uj⟩Hji = 0 ,
(A.10)
and so the determinant vanishes.
We can also extend this proof to the determinant with only one row and column removed, H[1]
[n] =
∂
∂H1n det(H) = 0: Proceed as above, but choose u∗= u1 to coincide with the removed row. Then
again
bH[1]
2i =
X
j̸=1
⟨u1uj⟩Hji = 0 ,
(A.11)
since the term from the omitted row does not contribute to the constraint when u∗= u1, and we
conclude H[1]
[n] =
∂
∂H1n det(H) = 0.
A.2
Comparison to other BCFW shifts in higher dimensions
For generic polarization data of the particles 1 and n, the BCFW shift (7.6) diﬀers from the BCFW
shift for Yang-Mills theory and gravity of [48], as well as the 6d spinorial shift of [19]. In these, for
gluons and gravitons, the shift vector is chosen to align with the polarization of one of the shifted
– 72 –

particles, qµ = e1 µ, to ensure that the boundary terms vanish.37 In the 6d spinor-helicity formalism,
the polarization vector e1 is given by (c.f. §4.1)
e1 AB = ϵ1 [A˜ϵ1 B] ,
with ϵ1 A = ϵ1 aκa
1 A and ϵA
1 = ˜ϵ˙a
1κA
1 ˙a = ˜ϵ1 B kAB
1 .
(A.12)
Due to the gauge freedom eµ ∼eµ + kµ, the spinor ˜ϵ1 A is only deﬁned up to terms proportional to
κa
1 A. Up to this freedom, a canonical choice [19] is given by
˜ϵ1 A = ˜ϵ1 ˙aκ∗
b
A
 κ∗
b
B κ1
B
˙a
−1 ,
(A.13)
where κ∗b
A is a reference spinor satisfying κ∗b
B κ1
B
˙a ̸= 0, and the inverse is deﬁned as the matrix inverse
in the little group spaces of the particles 1 and n. This choice for ˜ϵ1 A clearly satisﬁes ˜ϵ˙a
1 = ˜ϵ1 A κA
1 ˙a,
and thus reproduces F B
A =
 γµν
B
A F µν = ϵAϵB.
The spinorial BCFW shift qAB = ϵn [Aϵ1 B] is thus only equivalent to the standard BCFW shift
qAB = e1 AB if we can choose a little group spinor v∗
1a such that
ϵn A = −˜ϵ1 A + v∗
1a κa
1 A .
(A.14)
However, for generic momenta and polarization, no such v∗
1a exists: upon choosing the reference spinor
κ∗b
A = κnb
A in (A.13), we see that q = e1 only if the polarization spinors for particles 1 and n satisfy ˜ϵ˙a
1 =
−ϵn A κA ˙a
1 . Thus, the BCFW shift qAB = ϵn [Aϵ1 B] generically diﬀers from those discussed previously in
the literature [19, 48]). Note however that since q is constructed from the chiral polarization spinors
of both shifted particles, it does lie in the space of possible polarization vector for both particles.
Comparison to the 6d BCFW shift of Cheung & O’Connell
In the bosonic case, the super-
BCFW shift discussed in section 7 is strongly remininscent of the shift used in the work [19] of Cheung
and O’Connell on the 6d spinor-helicity formalism to derive higher point gluon amplitudes. Here we
compare our shift to that of [19], and comment on the similarities and diﬀerences in the resulting
recursion relations.
Let us brieﬂy review the work of [19].38
For bosonic Yang-Mills theory, it is advantageous to
keep the little-group symmetry manifest, see also section 2.4 for a discussion on the trade-oﬀbetween
the little-group and R-symmetry for super Yang-Mills.
Amplitudes are thus of the form ALG
a ˙a :=
ALG
a1 ˙a1...an ˙an, which relates to our representation (due to the linearity in the polarization spinors proven
in section 4.5) via
Aϵ˜ϵ = ϵa1
1 ˜ϵ˙a1
1 . . . ϵan
n ˜ϵ˙an
n ALG
a1 ˙a1...an ˙an ,
Aϵ˜ϵ := Aϵ1˜ϵ1...ϵn˜ϵn .
(A.15)
The BCFW-shift of Cheung and O’Connell is then designed to keep this little-group symmetry of the
amplitude representations manifest. Note that the standard d-dimension BCFW recursion relation
does not interact well with the little-group preserving amplitude representation, because the shift
vector has to be chosen to align with the polarization of one of the particles, qµ = eµ
1, see [48]. In the
spinor-helicity formalism however, there is no natural candidate for q = e1, essentially by construction.
Cheung and O’Connell avoid this complication by studying partially contracted amplitudes of the form
Xa1 ˙a1 ALG
a1 ˙a1...an ˙an ,
(A.16)
where X is a little group vector for particle 1.
For these amplitudes, they can use the standard
BCFW construction and choose the deformation vector to be qµ = Xa˙a eµ
1a˙a, where e1a˙a is a basis of
37In addition, we also have to work in a gauge where qµ = e1 µ does not transform under the shift.
38See also [49] for related work in higher dimensions.

polarization vectors for particle 1. Requiring that the shift leaves the external momenta on-shell is
equivalent to q2 = det X = 0, and thus Xa˙a = xa˜x˙a factorizes, where we can identify
xa = ϵa
1 ,
˜x˙a = ˜ϵ˙a
1 .
(A.17)
This construction leaves the direction of the deformation free (parametrized by X), but still aligns
it with the polarization vector of particle 1, since for any X we have qµ = ϵa
1˜ϵ˙a
1 eµ
1a˙a = eµ
1. Since
linearity in Xa˙a = ϵa
1˜ϵ˙a
1 is guaranteed, the full little-group-preserving ALG
a ˙a can still be extracted this
way. Having deﬁned this covariantized, but vectorial BCFW shift39

(A.19b)
Here, ˜ϵ1A and ˜ϵA
1 are deﬁned as in (A.13), such that e1AB = ϵ1[A˜ϵ1B], and similarly for the antichiral
case. Moreover, y and ˜y are little group spinors of particle n, and are determined by the spinors κ1,

The shift of Cheung & O’Connell and the polarized scattering equations.
Naively, this
recursion relation seems quite suitable to the framework based on the polarized scattering equations –
contracting both sides into the remaining ϵ’s and ˜ϵ’s leads directly to the recursion relation of section 7.
This however is not true for the BCFW shift (A.19), which is inherently ambidextrous, and does not
seem natural from the point of view of the (chiral) polarized scattering equations. It is diﬃcult to verify
that the boundary terms are absent,40 and it thus doesn’t seem feasible to apply the original recursion
in our framework. Note that the ambidextrous nature of the shift can be traced back to the choice of
the deformation vector q = e1, and thus seems to be an intrinsic feature of any BCFW-relation closely
related to the general-d recursion of [48].
Comparison.
To illustrate how the our chiral BCFW shift relates to the ambidextrous Cheung and
O’Connell shift, it is helpful to recast (A.19) in terms of some still-to-be-speciﬁed variables x and y,
related as before via
ya = ˜x˙a  κa

−1 ,
˜y˙a = xa  κa

(A.23)
39We use the notation ˇk1,n here to facilitate the comparison to the chiral shift denoted by ˆk1,n.
40To illustrate this diﬃculty, note that the scattering equations for i ̸= 1, n contain a single term of order z,

(A.22)

We stress that at this point these are the only constraints on the variables {x, ˜x, y, ˜y}, and that x and
˜x may not align with the polarization of particle 1. The shift (A.19) is then given by 41

(A.24b)
We note that this is the 6d-version of the super BCFW-shift of [49], using a slightly modiﬁed notation
to keep it more in line with [19]. As above, we use the notation ˇκ1,n for the shifted variables to make
it easier to compare this ambidextrous shift to the chiral one of section 7. The shift (A.24) can then
be chosen to partially agree with the chiral BCFW shift (7.4) and (7.8) by setting
xa = ϵa
1 ,
ya = ϵa
n ,
(A.25)
which leads to the same shift for fundamental spinors, ˆκ1,n = ˇκ1,n.
To see what happens to the
antifundamental spinors, we ﬁrst observe that the relations (A.23) become
˜x˙a = ϵnAκA

˜y˙a = ϵa

 κ1AκA
n
−1
a˙a = ϵ1AκA

(A.26)
In comparison to (7.8), this shift is missing the ‘pure gauge’ terms of ˜ϵA, and so the two shifts do
not agree for the antifundamental spinors. While the shift (A.25) may be interesting in its own right,
the proportionality of the antifundamental shift to ˜ϵA was crucial in proving that the boundary terms
vanish.
More generally, we can show that the antifundamental shift ˇκA
1˙a never agrees with ˆκA
1˙a for any
choice of {x, ˜x, y, ˜y}. To see this, contract both shifted spinors ˆκA
1˙a and ˇκA
1˙a into κa
1A (and equivalently
for n). This vanishes for the chiral shift, ˆκA
1˙a κa
1A = 0, but is generically non-zero for the little-group
preserving shift, ˇκA
1˙aκa
1A ̸= 0, and we conclude that ˆκA
1˙a ̸= ˇκA
1˙a.
A more general shift.
(A.24) is not the most general spinor deformation giving rise to the vecorial
shift ˇk1 = k1 + zq, ˇkn = kn −zq. In fact, it is easily checked that we have the freedom to add terms
proportional to xa⟨x κ1A⟩to ˇκa

(A.27b)
From the point of view of this more general shift, we can ﬁnally understand both the shift of Cheung
and O’Connell (A.19) and our chiral shift (7.4), (7.8) as special choices of the free variables.
As
discussed above, Cheung and O’Connell pick
xa = ϵa
1 ,
˜x˙a = ˜ϵ˙a
1 ,
α1 = αn = ˜α1 = ˜αn = 0 ,
(A.28)
whereas our chiral shift corresponds to

1 ,
ya = ϵa

˜α−1

= ˜αn = k1 · kn ,
α1 = αn = 0 .
(A.29)
Note that despite the six degrees of freedom in resolving the vectorial shift, most of the choices for
{x, ˜x, y, ˜y} will not give rise to a ‘good’ BCFW shift for any α1,n, ˜α1,n. To our knowledge, the only
two options to be found in the literature are the two discussed above: q = e1 (the ambidextrous shift
of [48] and [19]), or q · e1 = q · en = 0 (the chiral shift of this paper).42
41This is in fact the original notation for the BCFW shift given in [19], though with the interpretation of x = ϵ and
˜x = ˜ϵ as in (A.17) and (A.19).
42The latter is of course only possible in d ≥6.

in terms of det XY and det UY , since these readily factorize. Restricting again to odd nL and nR odd,

(A.34)
where the subscript det ˆXYL∪{p} indicates the (nL + 1)/2 square matrix constructed from ˆXYL and the
additional row p of XR|YR. As usual, we use square brackets to denote the removal of the respective
rows and columns. We may now expand this determinant along the row p,
det ˆXYL∪{p} [L] =

(A.35)
Here, we used X
R|YR
ip
=

σRp = σ−1
Rp , and the additional factor of x−1
¯iL
originates from factoring out
the product Q
j∈L xjL. In the last equality, we noted that the factors conspire to let us recover the
full determinant det XYL. Inserting this identity back into (A.34), we get the following factorization
property for det XY ;
det XY = −ε−nL−1
2
Y
j∈L
xjL det XYL det XYR .
(A.36)
One observation worth mentioning is that the factorization of XY is solely responsible for the power-
counting in the degeneration parameter ε. This is in line with what we expect, since U (1,0) (and also
– 76 –

U (0,1)) remaining of order one throughout the degeneration.
On the other hand, it is precisely this property that naively obscures the factorization properties
of det UY : since all components remain of order one, we do not expect to ﬁnd a natural factorization
corresponding to the two subspheres. However, the combination
UipUjq −UiqUjp = ⟨uiuj⟩⟨upuq⟩
σRpσRq
∼ε ,
(A.37)
is actually of subleading order in ε. Here, we have used that the denominators become independent
of i and j, as well as a Schouten identity in the u’s. This in turn ensures with Y chosen as above,
UY =

(A.38)
the leading order term in det UY can have at most one entry from the oﬀ-diagonal blocks, i.e. the
determinant factorizes similarly to det XY ,
det UY =
X
p∈YR
(−1)1+p det UYL∪{p} [L] det U
[R]
YR [p] .
(A.39)
Here the subscripts are deﬁned in complete analogy to the X above. We can thus follow the same
strategy as before, and expand det UYL∪{p} [L] in the additional row p,
det UYL∪{p} [L] =
X
¯i∈Y L
(−1)1+¯i ⟨u¯iup⟩
σRp
det U
[¯i]
YL [L] .
(A.40)
As before, this expression can actually be resummed to give the full det UYL, which relies on the
Schouten identity
⟨u¯iwL⟩⟨upuR⟩= ⟨u¯iup⟩⟨wLuR⟩+ O
 ε3/2
= ε1/2 ⟨u¯iup⟩
⟨ϵLϵR⟩+ O
 ε3/2
.
(A.41)
Using this, we recover the full determinant det UYL,
det UYL∪{p} [L] = i ⟨ϵLϵR⟩⟨upuR⟩
σpR
X
¯i∈Y L
(−1)1+¯i ⟨w¯iwL⟩
x¯iL
det U
[¯i]
YL [L] = i ⟨ϵLϵR⟩⟨upuR⟩
σpR
det UYL ,
(A.42)
which in turn gives the following factorization property for det UY ;
det UY = i ⟨ϵLϵR⟩det UYL det UYR .
(A.43)
Combining the factorization properties (A.36) and (A.43) for det XY and det UY with the independence
of the choice of YL and YR ensured by (4.39) (and proven in [32]) then gives the factorization property
of lemma A.1.

A.4
Recursion 3 to 4 points
We show here how the BCFW shift deﬁned in (7.4) allows us to construct the four point amplitude
from the three point in N = (1, 1) super Yang-Mills. Having shown in section 7.3 that the boundary
terms vanish, the standard recursion procedure gives:
A4(1234) = A3(ˆ1, 2, P)a˙a
1
s12
A3(K, 3, ˆ4)a˙a ,
(A.44)
with kP = −kK = ˆk1 + k2. We have shifted here particles 1 and 4. The contraction between the little
group indices of particles P and K comes from summing over the polarization states of the propagating
particle, as prescribed by the BCFW procedure, to yield the numerator of the propagator. Taking the
result we obtained for the three point amplitude we can write this expression as:
A4(1234) =
1
s12
(⟨ϵ1m1⟩⟨ϵ2m2⟩wP a + cyc.)(⟨ϵ3m3⟩⟨ϵ4m4⟩wa
K + cyc.) × (antifundamental) ,
(A.45)
where the contribution of antifundamental spinors is analogous to the two factors in parenthesis, only
with tilded variables.
All the variables m and w are deﬁned with respect to shifted spinors, i.e.
m1 = mˆ1 but we omit the hats to make the expressions more readable. (A.45) can be expanded into:
A4(1234) =
1
s12
 ˆ1m2m3mˆ4m⟨wP wK⟩+ (ˆ1m2w3mˆ4w + ˆ1m2w3wˆ4m + ˆ1w2m3wˆ4m + ˆ1w2m3mˆ4w)⟨mP mK⟩
+ (ˆ1m2m3mˆ4w + ˆ1m2m3wˆ4m)⟨wP mK⟩+ (ˆ1w2m3mˆ4m + ˆ1m2w3mˆ4m)⟨mP wK⟩

× (antifundamental) .
We have used a shorthand notation: im = ⟨ϵimi⟩and iw = ⟨ϵiwi⟩.
The computation of this amplitude is carried out in [19]. One needs to specify the little group objects
m and w for the internal particles P, K. Since kP = −kK, we can ﬁx κpA = iκkA and κA
p = iκA
k . Then
mP , ˜mP are deﬁned by (5.4) and w, ˜w are their inverses. We can then write:
(k1 ∧k2)B
A = mP a ˜mP ˙aκa
P AκB ˙a
P
= −mP a ˜mP ˙aκa
KAκB ˙a
K .
Contracting with ˆκA
i ˙cˆκBjc ˜wi ˙dwjdϵ ˙c ˙dϵcd, where i, j = 3 or 4:
mP a ˜mP ˙ama
K ˜m˙a
K = −(k1 ∧k2)B
AˆκA
i ˙cˆκBjc ˜wi ˙dwjdϵ ˙c ˙dϵcd = −s14 .
(A.46)
Exploiting this property one can impose
⟨mP wK⟩= 0 ,
(A.47)
and choose normalizations so that:
wK =
mP
√−s14
˜wK =
˜mP
√−s14
(A.48)
The four point amplitude above then becomes:
A4(1234) =
1
s12
1
⟨mP mK⟩
 ˆ1m2m3mˆ4m −s14(ˆ1m2w3mˆ4w + ˆ1m2w3wˆ4m + ˆ1w2m3wˆ4m
+ ˆ1w2m3mˆ4w) × (antifundamental) .
(A.49)
– 78 –

One can then check that:
ˆ1m2m3mˆ4m −s14(ˆ1m2w3mˆ4w + ˆ1m2w3wˆ4m + ˆ1w2m3wˆ4m + ˆ1w2m3mˆ4w) = ⟨ˆ123ˆ4⟩,
(A.50)
by projecting it on the base mi, wi. This gives:
A4(1234) =
1
s12s14
⟨ˆ123ˆ4⟩[ˆ123ˆ4] = ⟨1234⟩[1234]
s12s14
,
(A.51)
where the second equality follows from the invariance of the polarization spinors under the shift.
