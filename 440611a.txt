Quantum

Does
 the
 enormous
 computing
 power
 of
 neurons
 mean
 consciousness
 can
 be
 explained
 within
 
a
 purely
 neurobiological
 framework,
 or
 is
 there
 scope
 for
 quantum
 computation
 in
 the

The
 relation
 between
 quantum
 mechanics
and
 higher
 brain
 functions,
 including
 con-
sciousness,
 is
 often
 discussed
,
 but
 is
 far
 from
being understood. Physicists, ignorant of
modern neurobiology
, are tempted to
assume a formal or even dualistic view of
the
 mind–brain
 problem.
 Meanwhile,
 cog-
nitive
 neuroscientists
 and
 neurobiologists
consider
 the
 quantum
 world
 to
 be
 irrelevant
to their concerns and therefore do not
attempt to understand its concepts. What
can
 we
 confidently
 state
 about
 the
 current
relationship between these two fields of 
scientific
 inquiry?
All biological organisms must obey the
laws
 of
 physics,
 both
 classical
 and
 quantum.
In contrast to classical physics, quantum
mechanics
 is
 fundamentally
 indeterminis-
tic. It explains a range of phenomena that
cannot be understood within a classical
context:
 the
 fact
 that
 light
 or
 any
 small
 par-
ticle can behave like a wave or particle
depending on the experimental setup
(wave–particle duality); the inability to
simultaneously determine, with perfect
accuracy
,
 both
 the
 position
 and
 momentum
of
 an
 object
 (Heisenberg
’s
 uncertainty
 prin-
ciple);
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 quantum
 states
of multiple objects, such as two coupled
electrons, may be highly correlated even
though
 the objects are spatially separated,
thus
 violating
 our
 intuitions
 about
 locality
(entanglement). 
Major philosophical and conceptual
problems
 surround
 the
 process
 of
 making
measurements
 in
 quantum
 mechanics.
 To
illuminate
 the
 paradoxical
 nature
 of
 super-
position
 —
 that
 is,
 the
 fact
 that
 particles
 or
quantum
 bits
 (qubits)
 are
 allowed
 to
 exist
in
 a
 superposition
 of
 states
 —
 Schrödinger
proposed a celebrated thought experi-
ment: a sealed box containing the quan-
tum superposition of both a dead and a
live
 cat.
 When
 an
 observer
 peers
 inside
 the
box,
 measuring
 its
 content,
 the
 wave
 func-
tion,
 which
 describes
 the
 probability
 that
the
 system
 will
 be
 found
 in
 any
 one
 partic-
ular state, is said to collapse, and the sys-
tem
 will
 be
 found
 in
 one
 or
 the
 other
 state
with
 known
 probability
.
 
The
 role
 of
 the
 conscious
 observer
 in
 this
measuring
 process
 has
 been
 hotly
 debated
since
 the
 early
 days
 of
 quantum
 mechanics.
It is fair to say
, however
, that consciousness
has been only a place holder in a chain of
mathematical
 formulae,
 without
 much
 rel-
evance to the study of neural circuits in
intact
 organisms.
 Most
 quantum
 physicists
view
 the
 brain
 as
 a
 classical
 instrument.
 
The critical question we are concerned
with
 here
 is
 whether
 any
 components
 of
 the
nervous
 system
 —
 a
 300-degrees
 Kelvin
 tis-
sue
 strongly
 coupled
 to
 its
 environment
 —
display
 macroscopic
 quantum
 behaviours,
such
 as
 quantum
 entanglement,
 that
 are
 key
to
 the
 brain
’s
 function.
 
Specific molecular machines and pro-
teins have been proposed to implement
quantum
 computations.
 The
 best
 known
 of
such proposals
 is
 Penrose
 and
 Hameroff 
’s
hypothesis
 that
 the
 tubulin
 components
 of
microtubules, filamentous protein poly-
mers that form the cytoskeleton of cells,
implement
 quantum
 computations.
 
Lessons
 from
 quantum
 computers
When
 kings
 build,
 their
 followers
 team
 up
in
 international
 journals
 and
 conferences,
confusing
 the
 general
 public
 about
 the
 dis-
tinction between science and poetry
. But
large
 quantum
 systems
 are
 notoriously
 dif-
ficult
 to
 analyse
 rigorously
,
 except
 in
 highly
idealized
 models
 or
 limits.
 Estimates
 based
on
 the
 same
 unrealistic
 one-particle
 model,
applied
 to
 trillions
 of
 interacting
 particles,
show
 discrepancies
 of
 ten
 orders
 of
 magni-
tude in the work of different authors. It is
therefore
 better
 to
 turn
 to
 hard
 experimen-
tal realities and abstract computational 
theory to find the neural correlates of
quantum
 processes
 in
 the
 brain.
Quantum computations are difficult to
implement.
 In
 its
 simplest
 version,
 a
 quan-
tum computer transforms the state of
many two-dimensional qubits using a
reversible, linear
, probability-conserving
mapping
 via
 a
 sequence
 of
 externally
 con-
trollable quantum gates into a final state
with a probabilistic outcome. Quantum
computation seeks to exploit the
parallelism inherent in entangle-
ment by assuring that the system is
very likely to converge on the computa-
tionally
 desirable
 result.
 
This
 requires
 that
 the
 qubits
 are
 well
 iso-
lated
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 system.
 Coupling
the
 system
 to
 the
 external
 world
 is
 necessary
for the preparation of the initial state (the
input);
 for
 the
 control
 of
 its
 evolution;
 and
for the actual measurement (the output).
However
, all these operations introduce
‘noise
’
 into
 the
 computation
 (decoherence).
Although some decoherence can be com-
pensated
 for
 by
 redundancy
 and
 other
 fault-
tolerant
 techniques,
 too
 much
 is
 fatal.
 
In spite of an intensive search by many
laboratories, no scalable large quantum
computers
 are
 known.
 The
 record
 for
 quan-
tum computation is the factoring of the
number
 15
 by
 liquid-state
 nuclear
 magnetic
resonance
 (NMR)
 techniques.
 Qubits
 and
 a
set of universal quantum gates have been
proposed in many different implementa-
tions, but all solutions have serious draw-
backs: photons interact only weakly with
one another; nuclear spins in individual
molecules are few in number in current
devices,
 as
 are
 trapped
 atoms
 or
 ions.
 This
paints
 a
 desolate
 picture
 for
 quantum
 com-
putation
 inside
 the
 wet
 and
 warm
 brain.
Although brains obey quantum mech-
anics,
 they
 do
 not
 seem
 to
 exploit
 any
 of
 its
special
 features.
 Molecular
 machines,
 such
as
 the
 light-amplifying
 components of
 pho-
toreceptors, pre- and post-synaptic recep-
tors and the voltage- and ligand-gated
channel proteins that span cellular mem-
branes
 and

 excitability
,
are
 so
 large
 that
 they
 can
 be
 treated
 as
 classi-
cal
 objects.

Two
 key
 biophysical
 operations
 underlie
information
 processing
 in
 the
 brain:
 chem-
ical
 transmission
 across
 the
 synaptic
 cleft,
and the generation of action potentials.
These both involve
thousands
 of
 ions
 and
neurotransmitter
molecules,
 coupled
 by
diffusion or by the
membrane potential
that extends across
tens of micrometres. Both processes will
destroy
 any
 coherent
 quantum
 states.
 Thus,
spiking
 neurons
 can
 only
 receive
 and
 send
classical, rather than quantum, informa-
tion. It follows that a neuron either spikes at
a
 particular
 point
 in
 time
 or
 it
 does
 not,
 but
is
 not
 in
 a
 superposition
 of
 spike
 and
 non-
spike
 states.
 
The power of quantum mechanics is
often
 invoked
 for
 problems
 that
 brains
 solve
efficiently
.
 Computational
 neuroscience
 is
a young field and theories of complex
neural
 systems,
 with
 all
 the
 variability
 of
 liv-
ing
 matter
,
 will
 never
 reach
 the
 precision
 of
physical laws of well-isolated simple sys-
tems. It has already been demonstrated,
however
,
 that
 many
 previously
 mysterious
aspects of perception and action are
explainable in terms of conventional neu-
ronal
 processing.
 
Two examples are models for the rapid
recognition
 of
 objects
 (for
 example,
 animals
or faces) in natural scenes, with perfor-
mance approaching that of human
observers, and the attentional selection of
objects in cluttered images. The necessary
mathematical
 operations
 —
 such
 as
 changes
in synaptic weights, evaluating the inner
product between presynaptic activity and
synaptic
 weight,
 multiplication
 and
 station-
ary nonlinearities — are available to neu-
rons.
 Indeed
,
 there
 is
 an
 embarras
 de
 richesse
of computational primitives implemented
by
 synapses,
 dendrites
 and
 neurons.
 That
 is
not to suggest that we understand how
brains
 compute
.
 But
 so
 far
,
 there
 seems
 to
 be
no
 need
 for
 quantum
 skyhooks.
 
The
 reason
 for
 the
 unprecedented
 com-
putational power of nervous systems is
their high degree of parallelism. For
instance,
 filter-like
 operations
 in
 retinal
 or
cortical
 cells
 in
 the
 visual
 stream
 are
 per-
formed
 simultaneously
 on
 an
 entire
 image
and
 thus
 are
 not
 limited
 by
 the
 tyranny
 of
a
 single
 processor
.
 Furthermore,
 unlike
 the
von Neumann architecture of the pro-
grammable digital computer
, the brain
intermixes
 memory
 elements
 in
 the
 form
of
 modifiable
 interconnections
 within
 the
computational substrate, the neuronal
membrane. Thus, no separate memory
‘fetch
’
 and
 ‘store
’
 cycles
 are
 necessary
.
Much
 of
 the
 hope
 that
 quantum
 mechan-
ics
 works
 in
 the
 brain
 is
 pinned
 to
 the
 sup-
position that quantum algorithms, which
are
 much
 more
 powerful
 than
 conventional
algorithms
 (based
 on
 classical
 physics),
 are
implemented in the nervous system. The
most
 famous
 of
 these
 is
 Shor
’s
 procedure
 for
factoring
 large
 integers
 for
 data
 encryption.
However
, in the 
past decade no
quantum
 algorithm
of similar power
and applicability to
Shor’s has been
found. And factor-
ing large numbers is not something for
which
 the
 brain
 has
 much
 use.
Why should evolution have turned to
quantum
 computation,
 so
 fickle
 and
 capri-
cious,
 
 if
 classical
 neural-network
 computa-
tions
 are
 evidently
 entirely
 sufficient
 to
 deal
with
 the
 problems
 encountered
 by
 nervous
systems? 
Food
 for
 thought
At
 this
 point,
 intrepid
 students
 of
 the
 mind
point
 to
 qualia,
 the
 constitutive
 elements
 of
consciousness.
 The
 subjective
 feelings
 asso-
ciated
 with
 the
 redness
 of
 red
 or
 the
 painful-
ness
 of
 a
 toothache
 are
 two
 distinct
 qualia.
As long as it remains mysterious how the
physical
 world
 gives
 rise
 to
 such
 sensations,
could
 one
 of
 the
 more
 flamboyant
 interpre-
tations
 of
 quantum
 mechanics
 explain
 con-
sciousness? Most provocatively
, Roger
Penrose
 has
 claimed
 that
 brains
 can
 evalu-
ate
 noncomputable
 functions;
 that
 this
 abil-
ity
 is
 related
 to
 consciousness;
 that
 both
 this
ability
 and
 consciousness
 require
 a
 yet-to-
be-discovered theory of quantum gravity
and that microtubules are the sites of the
associated
 quantum
 gates.
 
The problem of consciousness and its
neuronal correlates is beginning to emerge
in
 outlines.
 The
 content
 of
 consciousness
 is
rich and highly differentiated. It is associ-
ated with the firing activity of a very large
number
 of
 neurons
 spread
 all
 over
 the
 cor-
tex and associated satellites, such as the
thalamus.
 Thus,
 any
 one
 conscious
 percept
or thought must be expressed in a wide-
flung coalition of neurons firing together
.
Even
 if
 quantum
 gates
 exist
 within
 the
 con-
fines
 of
 neurons,
 it
 remains
 totally
 nebulous
how
 information
 of
 relevance
 to
 the
 organ-
ism would get to these quantum gates.
Moreover
, how would it be kept coherent
across
 the
 milli-
 and
 centimetres
 separating
individual
 neurons
 when
 synaptic
 and
 spik-
ing processes, the primary means of neu-
ronal communication on the perceptual
timescale,
 destroy
 quantum
 information?
 
It
 is
 far
 more
 likely
 that
 the
 material
 basis
of
 consciousness
 can
 be
 understood
 within
a
 purely
 neurobiological
 framework,
 with-
out invoking any quantum-mechanical
deus
 ex
 machina.
We
 challenge
 those
 who
 call
 upon
 con-
sciousness
 to
 carry
 the
 burden
 of
 the
 mea-
surement process in quantum mechanics
with the following thought experiment.
V
isual psychology has caught up with
magicians
 and
 has
 devised
 numerous
 tech-
niques for making things disappear
. For
instance, if one eye of a subject receives a
stream
 of
 highly
 salient
 images,
 a
 constant
image projected into the other eye is only
seen infrequently
. Such perceptual sup-
pression
 can
 be
 exploited
 to
 study
 whether
consciousness is strictly necessary to the
collapse
 of
 the
 wave
 function.
 
Say an observer is looking at a super-
imposed quantum system, such as
Schrödinger’s
 box
 with
 the
 live
 and
 dead
cat,
 with
 one
 eye
 while
 his
 other
 eye
 sees
 a
succession
 of
 faces
 (see
 figure).
 Under
 the
appropriate
 circumstances,
 the
 subject
 is
only conscious of the rapidly changing
faces, while the cat in the box remains
invisible
 to
 him.
 What
 happens
 to
 the
 cat?
The conventional prediction would be
that as soon as the photons from this
quantum system encounter a classical
object,
 such
 as
 the
 retina
 of
 the
 observer
,
quantum
 superposition
 is
 lost
 and
 the
 cat
is
 either
 dead
 or
 alive.
 
This is true no matter whether the
observer
 consciously
 saw
 the
 cat
 in
 the
 box
or not. If, however
, consciousness is truly
necessary to resolve the measurement
problem, the animal
’s fate would remain
undecided
 until
 that
 point
 in
 time
 when
 the
cat
 in
 the
 box
 becomes
 perceptually
 domi-
nant to the observer
. This seems unlikely
but could, at least in principle, be empiri-
cally
 verified.
The empirical demonstration of slowly
decoherent
 and
 controllable
 quantum
 bits
in
 neurons
 connected
 by
 electrical
 or
 chem-
ical
 synapses,
 or
 the
 discovery
 of
 an
 efficient
quantum
 algorithm
 for
 computations
 per-
formed by the brain, would do much to
bring
 these
 speculations
 from
 the
 ‘far-out
’
to the mere ‘very unlikely’
. Until such
progress
 has
 been
 made,
 there
 is
 little
 rea-
son to appeal to quantum mechanics to
explain higher brain functions, including
consciousness.
