Preface 
This book 'COmes from a course I gave in Strasbourg in 1988-89. In the audience were 
in particular Julien Duval, Santiago Lopez de Medrano and Marcus Slupinski who 
helped me by their questions to understand many of the points I was supposed to be 
explaining. There were genuine students as well who, refusing to understand what 
I was badly explaining, suggested many improvements. I am thinking in particular 
of J. Fougeront, P. Gaucher, Li Jie and J.-M. llinkel. 
I learned a lot in discussions with Michel Brion, mainly about "Duistermaat-
Heckman with singularities" and Jean-Yves Merindol, who taught me in particular 
the Inoue surfaces. The reader will probably think that I said almost nothing about 
Lie groups and algebras, she or he must know that without Nicole Bopp and Hubert 
Rubenthaler I would have said even less. I thank them all. 
The original version of this book was published in French by the Institut de 
Recherche MatMmatique A vancee. The English version the reader has in hand is 
not very different: I corrected some of the misprints in the mathematics, I updated 
the bibliographical references, I made the presence of the exercises more evident by 
numbering them (thanks to the automatic system of cross references in L\TE]X), I 
tried to suppress those of the bad jokes which were untranslatable, and I replaced 
a short discussion about "Duistermaat-Heckman with singularities" with a whole 
section in chapter V. I thank all the people who pointed out mistakes in the French 
version. 
I thank also the Editors, who kindly accepted the book in this series and gave 
me good advice on the language problem, then I must thank again Marcus Slupinski 
who had the very difficult job of making my English readable. If there are still some 
gallicisms, I am the only responsible (sic)... and after all there are anglicisms in 
almost any French mathematical text! 
In addition to the fact that I had to understand all the proofs and to write them 
down, I also typed both the French and English versions myself. I obviously cannot 
thank me, but I want to thank J.-M. Bony and G. Sabbah who made my work easier 
by their help in the use of L\TEX.

Introduction 
At least since the Felix Kleinl Erlangen program, everybody knows that it is useful 
to make groups act on sets, thus providing information both on the group acting and 
on the set acted on. 
In this book, we shall be interested in "differentiable" (i. e. locally linear) ob-
jects: the set will be a smooth manifold and the group a Lie group, acting by 
diffeomorphisms. 
The group action allows one then to decompose the manifold into pieces (strata) 
corresponding to the various orbit types. When the manifold is not too complicated, 
it is possible to recover "everything" from this stratification: it is the case for ex-
ample when the group is the circle SI and the manifold a surface . .. but there are 
rather few examples of such a simple situation. 
The two principal motivations to investigate group actions on symplectic mani-
folds might be: 
1. It is a natural (?) framework for Hamilton mechanics: ever since Lagrange, we 
are able to consider the phase space of any mechanical system as a symplectic 
manifold, the group then represents the more or less hidden symmetries of the 
system2 • 
2. From the point of view of the group itself, what is called the "orbits method" 
(invented by B. Kostant, etc ... ) and which is a tool to construct represen-
tations of the group, uses symplectic geometry in an essential way. The fun-
damental objects in the theory are the coadjoint orbits, which are naturally 
symplectic manifolds. 
There is another good reason to investigate symplectic actions: it is easier! Ac-
tually the so-called hamiltonian actions are, by the very definition, those for which 
there is one (or many) functions on the manifold, the critical points of which cor-
respond to the fixed points of the group action. It is thus possible to use the well-
understood methods (invented by Morse, Thorn, and many others) called Morse 
theory to study the group action. 
For example, the central theorem in the first part of this book is the following 
statement (that any neophyte is allowed to find abstruse) due to Frankel [36] and 
Atiyah [18): 
1 Always begin by citing a great mathematician. 
2 A good reference for this point of view is the book by J .-M. Souriau [12).

Introduction 
Theorem 111-3.2.1 
Let X be an almost periodic vector field on a connected sym-
plectic manifold (W,w). Suppose H is a function W _ R such that ixw = dH, 
then all the levels H-l(t) are (empty or) connected. 
For those who felt the statement actually was abstruse, here are two applications 
which should be clear. 
In the former we enumerate the solutions of a particular system of algebraic 
equations. Consider a finite subset S C zn of multi-exponents, and the system of n 
equations and n unknowns: 
(1) 
Lc:.z<r=O 
<reS 
where 1 5 j 5 n, the parameters cf. being complex and the unknown z an element 
of the complex torus (c*)n. 
For example, 
• If S = {ell"" en} is the set of the vectors in the canonical basis of zn, then 
(1) is a homogeneous linear system and has in general no solution (in (c*)n) . 
• If we add 0 (then S = {ell' .. , en, O}), it is a linear system and has in general 
one solution. 
Figure 1 
The following theorem, due to A. G. Kushnirenko [51], generalises the two pre-
vious examples: 
The number of solutions of (1) for geneml enough coefficients 
Theorem 111-4.4.1 
cf. is 
N(S) = nlV 01(8) 
where 8 is the convex hull of S in Rn. 
The latter application3 of 111-3.2.1 looks rather different: 
31 learned this theorem in V. A. Ginsburg's paper [37] where it is attributed to Hausdorff. 

Introduction 
9 
Theorem 1II-4.1.1 Let A = (Al,"" An) ERn and let 'H>. be the set of all order 
n complex hermitian matrices whose spectrum is A. Then the image of 
--+ 
C 
1----+ tr (AX) 
(where A is any order n matrix) is a convex subset of C. 
For instance, 
• If A itself is hermitian, tr (AX) is real and the image is an interval in R C C. 
• If n = 2, A = (1,0) and A = (~ ~), the image is a disc in C. 
Although I did my best to present two rather different applications of 1II-3.2.1, 
I cannot hide that they have two important common points: 
• in their hypotheses: the manifolds (c*)n and 'H>. are both endowed with an 
action of the torus Tn. 
• in their conclusions: both contain the word "convex": actually, theorem III-
3.2.1 is the essential step in the proof of the so-called Atiyah, Guillemin and 
Sternberg convexity theorem. 
Our abstruse statement, in addition to giving unified proofs of previously differ-
ent theorems, allows us to classify certain group actions on symplectic manifolds. A 
rather important part of this book will be devoted to show that we know essentially 
all the compact symplectic 4-manifolds on which a Lie group is acting, preserving 
the symplectic form. 
As its title says, the object of this book is the study of some of the topological 
methods we use in symplectic geometry, but it is not a course in symplectic geometry, 
the market in this domain being full (see the references at the end). 
As the reader may have understood, the theorems in chapter III are Morse the-
oretical results. Morse theory will also be used in an essential and rather nice way 
(fono~ing an idea of Dusa McDuff) in chapter IV together with the classical tech-
niques of 3 and 4 dimensional topology (Seifert manifolds, investigated in chapter I, 
plumbing). 
Up to this point, algebraic topology is used only occasionally. In chapter V, it 
will take up more room: it happens that the language of equivariant cohomology 
fits very well with the study of hamiltonian actions. Actually the existence of a 
moment map for the G-action on the manifold W is equivalent to the existence of 
an extension of the symplectic form to the Borel construction Wo. This remark 
allowed N. Berline and M. Vergne [22] to give a lucid proof of a rather spectacular 
theorem of Duistermaat and Heckman [34]. 
I shall not resist presenting this perfect example of a theorem which becomes 
practically tautological once the right language to state it in is found. 

10 
Introduction 
Chapter VI is a kind of appendix: I shall present a rather topological construction 
of the complex toric varieties which we shall see is what we were flirting with in the 
previous chapters. I understood this construction while reading the book [46] by F. 
Kirwan and the thesis of T. Delzant [31] and comparing with what I was able to 
understand in the reference paper by Danilov [30]. 
Before this, chapters I and II will have been devoted to laying the foundations 
and to introducing the necessary tools: generalities and examples about smooth 
actions with mainly the slice theorem and the classification of Seifert manifolds in 
the former, and (even!) some symplectic geometry in the latter. 
A few remarks on prerequisites and on the material organisation of the book: 
1. Prerequisites: 
• Smooth manifolds, definition, first examples, tangent spaces, bundles and 
maps, vector fields. I recommend Spivak's book [1] and, as a good general 
reference for all these notes, paragraph 5 in the (less heavy) book by 
Kirillov [10]. 
• Classification of surfaces: there are a lot of good books, among which 
[5] and (4); to stay in the spirit of the present book, I recommend that 
of Gramain [3], as it might also be used as an introduction to Morse 
theoretical methods. 
• Very little about Lie groups and algebras, essentially the paragraph 6 in 
[10]. 
• As to algebraic topology: the reader is supposed to learn a few elementary 
notions as she or he goes along, being assumed to know nothing at the 
beginning (for instance in the proof of 2.2.4 in the first chapter I did not 
even use the words "exact homotopy sequence of the fibration" when I 
used that exact sequence) and a little more at the end. There will always 
be a reference or a hint of proof for what I shall use, but not always a 
complete proof. 
2. Material organisation: 
• Exercises: some of the most interesting examples are presented in exer-
cises, as are some easy, very classical or straightforward results. These 
results are then used in the text and it therefore goes without saying that 
the reader is supposed to solve them (or to make sure that she or he can 
solve them!). 
• Cross-references: references of type I?] refer (!) to the bibliography. 
Those of type (11) to an equation with a number in the same chapter. 
Figures, paragraphs and statements are numbered in each chapter with 
arabic digits and (sometimes) latin capitals. On the contrary, chapters 
are numbered with roman digits, any reference of the same type as above 
but beginning with a roman digit thus refering to the chapter in question.

Examples. 
- In chapter I, reference 2.2.4 denotes the proposition with this number 
in this chapter.

In the very same chapter I, reference IV-A would refer to appendix 
A of chapter IV, which appendix, mentioned in chapter IV, will only 
be called A. 

Chapter I 
Smooth Lie group actions on 
manifolds 
1 
Generalities 
There is no question of our rewriting here in great detail things that can be found in 
many excellent books (I am thinking in particular of [7] and [6]), but we shall make 
a list of the basic results we want to use in the text, with bibliographical hints. 
1.1 
Notation 
Let G denote a Lie group the unit element of which is 1 and Lie algebra g, W 
a smooth (i.e. COO) manifold on which G acts by diffeomorphisms. The action is 
written 
GxW --+ 
W 
(g, x) 
t---+ g. X 
(it is a left action). 
We shall sometimes say that W is a G-manifold. Similarly, we shall call G-vector 
bundle over a G-manifold W any vector bundle E --+ W endowed with a G-action 
which is linear in the fibres and such that the projection is an equivariant map ... 
where: if G acts in Wand V, and if r.p is a smooth map 
we say that r.p is an equivariant map if 
Vx E W, Vg E G,r.p(g· x) = g. r.p(x). 
If x is a point in W, its orbit will be denoted G·x, and its stabilizer G",. Stabilizers 
of points in the same orbit are conjugate (and all possible conjugates appear). With 
each orbit is associated a conjugation class of subgroups of G, called the type of the 
orbit. The conjugation class of H is denoted by (H). Thus the type of G· x is (G,,). 
13 

14 
Smooth actions 
1.2 Orbits and fundamental vector fields 
For each x E W, 
G ~ W 
I,. 
g 
1---+ g·x 
is a smooth map, the orbit map. Its differential at 1 is a map: 
With each X E g, is associated a vector Td",(X) =}L, E T",W tangent to W at x. 
When x varies in W, we get a vector field, the fundamental field associated with X, 
denoted by W X, X, or X when there is no risk of confusion. By definition, the flow 
of X is exp(tX) . x. Notice that the Lie bracket is related to the bracket of vector 
fields by the simple formula 
(1) 
[X, Y] = [X, Y]. 
The image of f", is the orbit of x, the stabilizer of x is a closed subgroup of G, 
the quotient is thus a smooth manifold and one shows 
Theorem 1.2.1 The orbit map 
f",:GJG", ~W 
is an injective immersion. 
To prove this, evaluate the kernel of 
By invariance, it is sufficient to study the case where g = 1. Thus look at the kernel 
of T d"" that is {X E 9 I}L, = OJ. It is easily checked that this set is the Lie algebra 
g", ofG",. 0 
Thus orbits are images of manifolds by injective immersions. It does not follow 
that they are submanifolds. 
Exercise 1.2.2 Fix a real number a and let R act on the torus T2 = R2/Z2 by 
t· (x,y) = (x + t,y + at). 
Find the orbits and show that these are submanifolds of T2 if (and only if) a is 
rational (hint: if a is irrational, orbits are dense). 
Recall that a proper injective immersion is an embedding, in particular the above 
problems do not occur when the group is compact. 
Corollary 1.2.3 If G is a compact Lie group, its orbits are submanifolds of W. 0 

Generalities

1.3 Examples 
Example O. 
GL(n,R) acts on Rn. 
In general the groups under consideration in the present text will be compact 
(from time to time, we shall nevertheless need to use C*). Very often, the group 
will even be commutative. 
Example 1. 
The circle Sl acts on cn by complex multiplication 
The point 0 is fixed; other orbits are circles. The spheres 
are stabilised by this action. This apparently trivial example is the fundamental one 
in the book! 
Example 2. 
Sl also acts on S3 C C 2 (for instance) in a more sophisticated way 
Exercise 1.3.1 Find the orbits (they depend on ml and m 2 ). 
Exercise 1.3.2 Imagine "analogous"(?) actions of the torus T" in cn. 
Example 3. The unitary group U(n) acts on hermitian n x n-matrices by conjuga-
tion 
Exercise 1.3.3 The orbits of this action are the manifolds 1{). mentioned in the 
introduction. Given a vector>' E Rn what is the stabilizer of 1{).? (hint: if

Smooth actions 
Any action may be replaced by an effective one: 
Proposition 1.4.2 nG., is a closed normal subgroup in G, and the G-action in W 
induces an effective action ofGlnG., in W. 
The proof is left as an exercise. 0 
Example 1. Let 51 act in 0 by t . w = t2w. This is not an effective action, the 
subgroup {±1} fixing all points. The quotient 51 / {±1} acts effectively. 
Example 2. 
The SI-action on 53 by 
is effective if and only if ml and m2 are relatively prime (exercise). 
Example 3. If G is simple, the action is either effective or trivial. This is the case 
for instance for G = 50(3). 
Here are Borne more definitions: 
Definition 1.4.3 The action is transitive if it has only one orbit, free if all orbits 
have {1} as stabilizer, semifree if they have G or {1} as stabilizer (in other words 
if it is free outside jizedpoints). 
Exercise 1.4.4 The SI-action on 0 2 is semifree. When is the SI-action on S3 by

The last notion in this paragraph is that of orbit space: it is the quotient space 
WIG endowed with the quotient topology. In general, it is not even Hausdorff (cf 
the example of the irrational flow on the torus T2). Anyway: 
Proposition 1.5.2 If G is compact, WIG is a Hausdorff space and the projection 
W ---+ WIG is proper and closed.

Equivariant tubular neighborhoods and orbit types decomposition 
2.1 
The slice theorem (equivariant tubular neighborhood) 
Although it is not the most general possible hypothesis, assume that G is com-
pact. In this case, its orbits are submanifolds of W. We now describe W in the 
neighborhood of an orbit. 
Let x E W. Denote V" the vector space T"WIT,,(G· x). If 9 E G", the tangent 
map: 
T"g: T"W --+ Tg."W = T"W 
is an isomorphism, sending the tangent space of the orbit into itself (by the identity 
map), and in particular it induces a linear isomorphism from v., to itself. Thus, 
with each point x in W, is associated a linear representation of its stabilizer, i.e. a 
group homomorphism: 
G" ---+ GL(V,,). 
Theorem 2.1.1 (the "slice theorem"[50]) There exists an equivariant diffeom-
orphism from an equivariant open neighborhood of the zero section in G xGs V" to 
an open neighborhood of G· x in W, which sends the zero section GIG" on the orbit 
G . x by the natural map f".

Smooth actions 
Explanation of notations. G x v.: is acted on by G., (by multiplication on G and 
by the linear representation just described on Vr ). More generally, if H is a closed 
subgroup of G, and if V is a vector space endowed with an H-linear action, there is 
a free action of H on G x V by: 
h . (g, v) = (gh-t, h . v). 
The quotient is denoted G XH V, and [g,v] represents the equivalence class of (g,v). 
This is a vector bundle on G I H with fiber V.

and it is endowed with a G-action by 
---t

---t GIH 
g' . [g, v] = [g' g, v]. 
We may consider G/ H as a submanifold in G XH V, the zero section of the vector 
bundle, {[g, 0]1 9 E G}. 
Theorem 2.1.1 says that there exists an extension /., of the orbit map: 
at least to a neighborhood of the zero section. 
Sketch of a proof of theorem 2.1.1. In the non equivariant case, to prove the ex-
istence of a tubular neighborhood of a compact submanifold YeW, one uses the 
exponential map of a riemannian metricl on W which induces a diffeomorphism 
from a suitable neighborhood of the zero section in the normal bundle of Y onto a 
neighborhood of Yin W (see [1] for instance). 
To adapt this proof in the equivariant case, it suffices to choose the riemannian 
metric in such a way that it is G-invariant (i.e. G acts on W by isometries), thus 
making it possible to identify v.: to the orthogonal complement of T.,( G . x). 
To be convinced of the existence of an invariant metric: 
1. G has a Haar measure (i. e. one invariant by left translations). As it is a 
Lie group, the proof of this fact is very easy: choose an n-linear alternating 
form2 W E A"(g)* on 9 = TlG. Define an invariant differential form on G by 
Wg = 9 . w. In particular it is a measure, it is moreover possible to normalise 
it, thanks to the compacity of G, multiplying W by an ad hoc scalar such that 
JaWg = 1. 
IThe reader is invited to have a look at her or his favourite differential geometry textbook to 
find a proof of the existence of such a metric; it goes without saying that here all manifolds are 
implicitely assumed to be paracompact (and Hausdorff)!

2. Given a G-vector bundle E ~ 
W, we have a G-action on the sections of E 
by: 
(g. s)(x) = gs(g-tx). 
Given a section s, associate to it an equivariant section s by: 
s(x) = !ags(g-tx)wg • 
If E is the bundle of symmetric bilinear forms on the tangent bundle TW and 
if s is a riemannian metric, it is easily checked that the invariant section s is 
still a riemannian metric. 
2.2 
Applications 
Proposition 2.2.1 The union of all orbits of a given type is a submanifold of W. 
Proof. 
Fix a type, i.e. a conjugation class (H) of subgroups of G. Let x E W(H) = 
{x E W I Gx E (H)}. Let us prove that W(H) is a submanifold (local property!) 
in the neighborhood of the orbit of x. For this, look at the orbits of type (H) in 
GXHV, 
If g' E G[g,v], we have: 
gh- t 
h·v 
thus G[g,v] = gHvg-t is in the conjugation class of Hv and all conjugates do appear 
when 9 varies (and v is fixed). 
The orbit of [g, v] is of type (H), if and only if Hv = H, that is if and only if v 
is a fixed point of the H-action in V. 
Let F = {v E V I h . v = v, Vh E H} be the set of these fixed points. It is a 
vector subspace of V and 
(G XH V)nW(H) = {[g,v] E G XH V I G[g,v) E (H)} = G XH F 
is a subbundle of G XH V and in particular a submanifold. 0 
The simplest example is that of type (G) orbits: 
Corollary 2.2.2 The set of fixed points of G is a submanifold of W. 0 
Of course these submanifolds are not connected in general, and their components 
do not all have the same dimension. 
Anyway the orbit types give a decomposition of W in submanifolds. This de-
composition is locally finite: 
Proposition 2.2.3 If W is compact, there is only a finite number of orbit types. 

20 
Smooth actions 
Proof. Let n = dim W. If n = 0, the proposition is obviously true: W itself is a 
finite number of points. Suppose that the proposition is proved for G-manifolds of 
dimension ~ n -1. Thanks to the compacity of W, it is sufficient to show that each 
tube N = G XH V contains only a finite number of orbit types. 
Choose an H-invariant metric on the H-vector space V, call SV the unit sphere 
for that metric and write SN = G XH SV (it is the sphere bundle of N). It is a 
G-manifold of dimension n -1, we can apply the induction hypothesis: in SN, there 
is only a finite number of orbit types. 
Compare now the types in SN and in N: I claim that, as the H-action on V 
is linear, V>' f:. 0, the orbit type of [g, >.v] E N is the same as that of [g, v] E SN 
(exercise). Thus the types in N are: those in SN on the one hand, and that of the 
central orbit in GI H on the other hand. 0 
It is not only true that there are few orbit types, but that there is one which 
takes almost all the place: 
Proposition 2.2.4 If WIG is connected, there is an orbit type (H) in W for which 
W(H) is a dense open subset of W. Moreover, W(H)IG is a connected manifold. 
Definition 2.2.5 Such orbits are called principal orbits. 
Proof. 
Assume G is connected and prove the result by induction on n = dim W. If 
n = 0 and WIG is connected, there is only one orbit and the proposition is obvious. 
As previously, assume the result proved for G-manifolds of dimension ~ n - 1 and 
consider N = G XH V. 
In order to apply the induction hypothesis to SN we would have to know that 
S N I G is connected. Nearly always, S N itself is connected (and thus a fortiori its 
quotient SNIG is): call 11" the projection of the vector bundle N --+ GI Hj to 
connect two points a and b of SN by a path, choose a path from 1I"(a) to 1I"(b) in the 
connected orbit G I H and lift it to a path beginning at a in the boundary S N of 
the tube. The end b' of the lift is in the same fiber as b and to be able to connect it 
to 1/ (thus to a), it is sufficient that this fiber, which is a sphere in V, is connected. 
The only possible problem appears in the Case where the unit sphere in V has 
dimension O. In this case dim V = 1 and S N --+ G I H is a twofold covering. If 
it not trivial, it is connected and we are donej if it is trivial, it means that H acts 
trivially on the "slice" V = R . .. in which case all orbits contained in N are the 
same and we do not need the induction hypothesis to conclude that the proposition 
is true in N. In the other cases, the induction hypothesis applies to SN and there 
exists an orbit type (H) such that (SN)(H) is open and dense in SN. As in the 
proof of 2.2.3, it is easily seen that the same happens in N. 
Thus the proposition is proved in each equivariant tube. Choose a locally fi-
nite covering of W by such tubes and conclude, with the help of the orbit space 
connectivity, that the type (H) is the same in all tubes. 0 

Equivariant tubular neighborhoods and orbit types decomposition 
21 
Example. If G is commutative, let (H) = {H} be the type of the principal orbits. 
The subgroup H fixes all the points of an open dense subset of W, and thus fixes 
all the points of W. If the action is effective, principal orbits have type (1). 
Definition 2.2.6 If all orbits are principal, the action is called principal. 
Remarks. 
• An orbit is principal if and only if the representation in V of its stabilizer is 
trivial. 
• In this case, the quotient is a manifold.

8mooth actions 
3 
Examples: 2 and 3-dimensional 8 1-manifolds 
In this part, we shall give examples of classification theorems. The most inter-
esting one is that of fixed point free 8 1-actions on orient able 3-manifolds (Seifert 
manifolds), which will be used in the sequel to understand periodic hamiltonians 
on 4-manifolds. Both as an introduction and a preliminary exercise, consider first 
8 1-actions on surfaces. 
3.1 
8 1-actions on surfaces 
Begin with a. list of examples. 
1. We have already seen 8 1 acting on the torus T2 = 8 1 X 8 1 by multiplication on 
one summand: it is the unique principal 8 1-action on a surface, as we alrea.dy 
know. 
2. 8 1 also acts on the unit sphere 8 2 of R3 as the group of rotations around a 
fixed axis. All orbits are principal, except for the two fixed points where the 
axis meets the sphere. The orbit space is a closed interval. 
Figure 3 
3. It also acts on the projective plane p2(R). Here are three possible (but nev-
ertheless equivalent) descriptions of that action: 
• If P2(R) is the quotient of the sphere 8 2 by the antipodic map (x f-t -x), 
the action previously defined on the sphere descends to the quotient. 
• If P2(R} is the "projective completion" of R2 (to which a line at infinity 
is added), then the linear 8 1 = 80(2}-action on R2 may be extended to 
P2(R}. 
• If P2(R) is the set of lines in R3 and is described by homogeneous coor-
dinates [x,y,z), then 8 1 = 80(2} acts by A· [x,y,z) = [A. (x,y},z). 

Examples: 2 and 3-dimensional 8 1-manifolds 
23 
Figure 4 
Exercise 3.1.1 Check that these three actions are the same. 
In each of the given three descriptions3 it is clear that all orbits are principal 
except for two of them. One is a fixed point and the other has a Z/2 as 
stabilizer (it corresponds to the equatorial circle of 8 2 for example). The orbit 
space is a closed interval, each of its ends corresponding to a non principal 
orbit. 
4. 8 1 also acts on the Klein bottle K. Write K as the quotient of R2 by the 
group of affine transformations generated by 
(x,y) ~ (x + l,y) 
(x,y) .; (-x,y+l) 
and make R act on R2 by (x, y) 1-+ (x, y+a). It induces an action of R/Z = 8 1 
on K. The quotient map is identified with 
K 
~ R/(x '" x + l,x '" -x) 
[x, y] 
1---+ 
[x] 
and this identifies the orbit space with [0,1/2]. 
All orbits are principal, except those corresponding to 0 and 1/2 which have 
a Z/2 as stabilizer. 
Here is now a complete study, whose aim is of course to show that this list 
exhausts all possible examples. Assume W is a closed (i.e. compact and without 
boundary) connected surface. 
The closed subgroups (and thus the possible orbit types) of 8 1 are: {I} ,Z/m, 
and 8 1 • 
3The reader wanting to know more about the projective plane is kindly requested to have a 
look at the nice book [21 by F. Apery.

As 8 1 is commutative and the action is assumed to be effective, the principal 
orbits must have type {I}. In the neighborhood of a principal orbit, according to 
the slice theorem 2.1.1, the action is the product over 8 1 x R of the multiplication 
and the trivial action. A neighborhood of such an orbit in the quotient space is thus 
homeomorphic to R. 
The type Z/m (m ;::: 2) orbits are exceptional. That group must have an effective 
action on the normal space to the orbit, the dimension of which is 1. This can happen 
only if m = 2 the action being x 1-+ -x. In the neighborhood of such an orbit, a 
tube looks like: 
81 XZ/2 R = (81 X R)/(z, u) rv (-z, -u). 
It is a Mobius strip, thus the existence of an exceptional orbit forces W to be 
nonorientable. In the neighborhood of the orbit, the quotient map is [z, t] 1-+1 t 1 
and the quotient space is a half line. 
Singular orbits have type 8 1: they are fixed points. Near such a point, the action 
linearises as the standard 8 1 = 80(2)-action on R2. 
We thus proved that the orbit space is a dimension 1 manifold with boundary, 
of COllrse compact and connected as W is. It suffices now to investigate all possible 
cases. 
1. If WI81 is a circle, the action is principal, and we saw that W is a torus, with 
the usual action. 
2. If not, WI81 is a closed interval; over the open interval, we see 8 1 X Rand 
each of the ends is the image, either of a fixed point, or of an exceptional orbit, 
with Z/2 as stabilizer (see figure 6). 
• If there are two fixed points, W is obtained by adding two points to 
8 1 x R, and is a sphere. 

Examples: 2 and 3-dimensional SI-manifolds

coO) 
Figure 6 
• If there is only one fixed point, and one exceptional orbit, we must glue 
a disc to a Mobius strip along the boundary (which is a principal orbit). 
We thus get a projective plane . 
• If both ends correspond to exceptional orbits, we must glue two Mobius 
strips along their common boundary, thus getting a Klein bottle. 
Exercise 3.1.2 Which surfaces may be endowed with (non trival!) SO(3)-actions? 
Hint: any subgroup of SO(3) is conjugate either to SO(2) or to 0(2) or is finite. 
3.2 
3-manifolds; the principal case 
The study of 3-manifolds with fixed point free SI-action was initiated by Seifert 
during the thirties [63]. The classification of these SI-actions is due to F. Raymond 
[60]. He actually classified topological actions. Of course we shall restrict ourselves 
to the differentiable classification ... but both are the same! 
Le us start with principal actions. The quotient space is then a closed surface B 
and 11" : W ~ 
B is a "principal SI-bundle" over B, the local triviality of which is 
asserted by the slice theorem. 
In addition to the diffeomorphism type of B, we shall exhibit another invariant, 
a number called the "Euler class". It is an integer when B is orient able (and an 
integer modulo 2 otherwise). 
Assume the surface is orientable. Here is a description of the Euler class e. 
Choose a point in B and a disc Do around this point. The complement of the point 
has a wedge of 29 circles as deformation retract (see [5]). 
Exercise 3.2.1 Show that, if the orbit space of a principal SI-action is either 
a wedge of circles, or the complement of a point in a surface or a disc, then the 
fi brat ion is trivialisable.

This allows to choose a section u : B - Do --+ W - Vo. When restricted to Do 
the bundle is trivialisable as well, thus Vo = lI'-I(Do) is a solid torus 
Vo = Do X SI 
and W = (W - Do) Ua Vo.

Figure 8 
On the boundary avo we see two natural curves: 
1. The meridian a. By definition, it is a closed simple curve which bounds a disc 
in Vo. Its homotopy class is (up to sign) well defined by this property: a is a 
generator of the kernel of 
we can choose for a the boundary of a section of 1I'1Do' 
2. Any orbit b of the SI-action. It is also a simple closed curve; with a chosen as 
above, the two curves meet at exactly one point. 

Examples: 2 and 3-dimensional 8 1-manifolds 
27 
As the surface B was supposed orient able and the action principal, the manifold 
W is orient able as well (exercise). Choose an orientation of W, the induced orien-
tation on Vo, the boundary orientation4 on 8Vo. Orient b by the orientation of 8 1 
and choose the orientation of a in such a way that a . b = + 1. 
If 8(7 is oriented oppositely to the boundary orientation, it meets b in one point 
and positively and we may write 
8(7 '" a - eb 
for some e e Z. This integer is the Euler class of the principal 81-action on W (or 
of the principal 8 1-bundle W --+ B). 
Proposition 3.2.2 The so defined integer e is independant of all choices. Together 
with the diffeomorphism type of B J it determines the equivariant diffeomorphism 
type of W. For any orientable surface B and any integer e, there exists a manifold 
W endowed with a principal 8 1-action whose orbit space is B and whose Euler class 
is e. 
Proof. One constructs, given Band e, a manifold W with an 81-action whose 
invariants are Band W: 
Choose a disc Do in B. Write Wo = (B - Do) x 81, endow it with the product 
action, thus (7( x) = (x, 1) is a section. Consider also a solid torus D2 x 81 with the 
product action, and define an equivariant diffeomorphism 
reversing orientations. Make the choice of '() precise by prescribing which curve in 
8Wo is sent to a meridian (i. e. is homotopic to a constant in the solid torus). Take 
8(70 + eb, where b denotes the homotopy class of any orbit. 
The constructed manifold has the right invariants. Conversely, if W is endowed 
with a principal 8 1-action with these invariants, it is easy to write down a diffeo-
morphism of W with the above model. 0 
Remark. The Euler class e vanishes if and only if the fibration W --+ B has a 
section, in other words is trivialisable. 
Example. The 8 1-action on 8 3 by t·(zt, Z2) = (tzt, tz2 ) is principal and the quotient 
is a sphere 8 2 which we may consider here as the complex projective line Pl(C), 
the quotient mapping being the Hopf fibration: 
8 3 
--+ Pl(C) 
(ZI, Z2) 
1----+ 
[ZI, Z2] 
which associates with each unit vector the complex line it generates. The sphere de-
composes into two solid tori (see figure 9) above which the fibration is trivialisable. 
4The convention we use to orient boundaries is the one in which the outward normal followed 
by the orientation of the boundary gives the orientation of the whole manifold.

Exercise 3.2.3 Prove that the Euler class of the action giving the Hopf fibration 
is -1. 
3.3 
Seifert manifolds 
We want now to generalise the previous study to the case of closed 3-manifolds 
endowed with an 8 1-action, still without fixed points but with possibly exceptional 
orbits. I shall make restrictions on orientation later on. The proof we shall give of 
the classification theorem can be found in [59], another useful reference is [23]. 
There are principal orbits, of type {I}, and exceptional orbits, of type Z/m (for 
m ~ 2). As in the case of surfaces, we try to understand the local structure of the 
orbit space near an exceptional orbit with the help of the slice theorem 2.1.1. 
3.3.1 Type Z/m orbits. The slice has dimension 2 and 8 1 acts on V == R2 
as a subgroup of 0(2). If m ~ 3, Z/m sits in 80(2) as the subgroup of order 
m rotations, but if m = 2, there are two different ways to embed Z/2: it can be 
generated by a reflection or by a rotation. Written with the help of a well-chosen 
complex coordinate in R2, with e = e2ifr/ m : 
e·v = ev 
and possibly, if m=2: 
In that last case, the equivariant tube is 
81 xC /(z, v) '" (-z, v) 
if one writes v = x + iy, one sees it is the product of a Mobius strip and an R. This 
can only happen if W is non orientable. 
From now on, assume W is an oriented manifold. Thus all orbits have tubular 
neighborhoods of the form 81 XZ/m C where Z/m acts on C by order m rotations. 

Examples: 2 and 3-dimensional Sl-manifolds 
29 
Remarks. 
1. Exceptional orbits are isolated in W: in Sl XZ/m C all orbits are principal, 
except for the central (v = 0) one. In particular, as W is compact, there are 
only finitely many. 
2. Near a type Z/m orbit, the orbit map is identified with 
Figure 10 
C/(Z/m) 
[v] 
In particular, the quotient space is a closed topological surface B, with an addi-
tional structure inherited from the differentiable structure of W: the structure 
of a differentiable manifold except at a finite number of points, where B has 
a conical "singularity". One says that B is an orbifold5 (see 11-3.6.6). The 
additional structure is included in the Sl-action on W, in this chapter we shall 
therefore concentrate on the topological surface B. 
We shall only need to consider the case where B is an orientable surface: when 
it will appear again in chapter IV, it will be symplectic. 
In the sequel of this chapter, W is thus an oriented manifold and the quotient 
surface B is assumed to be orient able as well. The projection 
W--+B 
is a Seifert fibration and the manifold W a Seifert manifold. 
3.3.2 Seifert invariants of an exceptional orbit. Thanks to the slice theorem, 
a tubular neighborhood of an exceptional orbit looks like: 
(2) 
5previously called a V-manifold. 

30 
Smooth actions 
where Z/m acts as a subgroup on SI and acts in a linear fashion on the disc D2 C 
R2 = C. This action is by order m rotations, thus the quotient in (2) is given by 
(z, v) '" (e-2i1rfJ/m . z, e2i'lf/m • v) 
{3 being an integer prime to m (and defined only modulo m). 
Definition 3.3.3 The two rdatively prime integers (m,{3) with 0 < {3 < m are 
called the Seifert invariants of the exceptional orbit. 
Exercise 3.3.4 Let /I be an integer such that {3/1 = -1 mod m. Check that 
81 X D2 _ 
8 1 X D2

to the 8 1-actions given by 
• on the left hand side by t . [z, v] = [tz, v] 
• on the right hand side by t . (Z, V) = (tm Z, t-"V) 
In particular the tube V is indeed a solid torus.

We thus see that any principal orbit turns m times around the exceptional orbit 
and thus meets any "meridian" at m points (see figure 11 in which m = 5 and /I = 2, 
where the principal orbit is b;, composed of m segments in the figure, and where a; 
is a meridian). 
3.3.5 
Before giving the classification, let us investigate some examples. 

Examples: 2 and 3-dimensional 8 1-manifolds

Examples. 
1. If ml and m2 are relatively prime, we saw that the 8 1-action on 8 3 by 
(3) 
is effective. The orbits (Zl' 0) and (0, Z2) are exceptional (if ml and m2 are at 
least 2), with respective types Z/ml and Z/m2' 
A tubular neighborhood of the orbit (zt, 0) is a solid torus 81 X D2 on which 
81 acts by (3). 
If a are 13 are chosen both by Bezout and by equation 
(4) 
with 0 < 13 < mb 0 < a < m2, then the orbit invariants are (mbf3) and 
(mz,mz -a). 
2. Let ZIp act on 8 3 by 
e . (zt, Z2) = (ezt, eq zz) 
where e = e2jtr'r> and q is prime to p. 
It is a free action of a finite group on a compact manifold. The quotient is a 
3-manifold, denoted L(p,q) and called type (p,q) lens space6 • Then the circle 
acts on L(p, q) by projecting any action on the sphere. For instance, from the 
principal action we get an action with one exceptional type Z/q orbit if q ~ 2. 
Exercise 3.3.6 Find the quotient and Seifert invariants of the exceptional orbit 
in the previous example. Give a description of L(p, q) by gluing of two solid tori. 
3.3.7 
Coming back to the classification problem: we have a finite number r of 
exceptional orbits in W, having Z/mll"" Z/mr as stabilizers and respective Seifert 
invariants (mt, 131), •.• , (mr, f3r). On the other hand, we have an orient able quotient 
surface B. 
Remove r discs D1, ••• , Dr from B around r points corresponding to exceptional 
orbits and also a disc Do (around a point corresponding to any principal orbit). This 
removes r + 1 solid tori Vo, Vt, ... , Vr from W. 
Thus when restricted to W - (Vo U ... U Vr) the action is principal and has a 
section (even if r = 0). Choose one 
Its boundary fJu has a component over each fJDj, call it fJiu. Consider the curve 
fJiu. We know it meets bi at exactly one point: thus (fJiu,bi) is a basis of 'lr1(fJVi). 
Choose a meridian aj as above and a "parallel" Ii in such a way that (ai, Ii) is a basis 
of 'lrl(fJVi) oriented as (fJju, bi) (see figure 11). 
6This is an example of a manifold whose fundamental group is Zip. 

32 
We have aj . bj = mj et Ij • bj = Vj, and thus 
that is 
{ OjO' = 
xaj

-Viaj + 
ylj 
mi/i 
(OjO',bi ) = (ai,/i) (; -;:'j) 
where xmi + VjY = 1. Invert the matrix to get 
(a;, I;) = (OjO', bi) ( mi 
Vx;) 
-y 
Hence 
aj = mjOjO' - ybj 
with yVj = 1 - xmj that is -y == (3j mod mj. 
The meridian aj is thus written: 
(5) 
aj = mjojO' + njbj 
8mooth actions 
where mj is actually the order of the central orbit stabilizer in Vj and nj is congruent 
to (3j mod mj. 
We can now modify the section 0' in such a way that nj is exactly (3j: any map 
C(J: (B - UD j ) -t 8 1 can be used to modify 0' just by mUltiplication 
O'.,.(x) = C(J(x) ·O'(x). 
If the degree of C(J18Di is dj, then OjO'.,. '" OjO' + djbj and 
aj = mjojO'.,. + (nj - djmj)bj. 
To replace nj by (3j in (5) it is thus sufficient to find a map C(J : B - UDj -t 81, such 
that deg C(J18Di = dj and 0 < nj - djmj < mj. Now use the lemma: 
Lemma 3.3.8 Let V be a connected surface whose boundary has r + 1 (circle) com-
ponents oV = Ui=o Cj. Let t/J: oV -t 8 1 be a continuous map and let dj = deg(t/JloJ. 
There exists an extension of t/J to V, if and only if E dj = o. 
Proof. 
Stokes formula for instance shows the necessity of the condition: assume t/J 
is differentiable and there exists a smooth extension ;j; : V -t SI. If dO denotes the 
volume form on SI, 
t dj = r t/J* dO = r d(;j;* dO) = o. 
j=O 
J8V 
Jv 
Prove the reciprocal by induction on r. If r = 0 (the case where the boundary is 
connected) and do = 0, then t/J is homotopic to the constant map. Use the homotopy 
to construct the extension ;j;: take it to be constant outside a collar (see figure 12). 
Proceed from r to r + 1 in the same way, using the other part of the figure, 
details being left as an exercise. 0 

Examples: 2 and 3-dimensional Sl-manifolds

Figure 12 
Using the lemma, one can find a map cp which can be used to modify the n;'s 
over all the 8D;'s for 1 ~ i ~ r. This forces degCPl8Do = -(d1 + ... + dr ) and at the 
same time forces an invariant 13 such that 80 0' + 13110 is the meridian in Vo to appear 
and explains why we needed the "extra" tube Vo. 
We thus determined a list of (normalised) invariants: 
Just as in 3.2.2: 
Theorem 3.3.9 If W is a fixed point free oriented Sl-manifold whose base space is 
a genus g oriented surface, then its diffeomorphism type is determined by the list: 
where r is the number of exceptional orbits, f3i is prime to mi and is chosen such 
that 0 < f3i < mi and (mi,f3i) are the Seifert invariant of the orbit numbered i. 
Reciprocally, given such a list one can find an SI-manifold with these invariants. 0 
Up to order, the list is unique once we require the Seifert invariants to be nor-
malised. Previous remarks (how to get normalised invariants) show moreover that 
the gluing data 
or 
(g 10, (1, -13), (mb 131)' .•. ' (m., f3r» 
or even 
define the same Seifert manifold. 

34 
Smooth actions 
3.4 
Associated principal actions and Euler class 
If W is a Seifert manifold, then for any integer n, one can make Z/n act on W as a 
subgroup of S1. 
Proposition 3.4.1 lfn is a common multiple of the orders of the exceptional orbits, 
then the manifold W' quotient ofW by the Z/n-action is endowed with an effective 
and principal action of B1/(Z/n) 9!! B1. 
Prool Look at the neighborhood of an orbit (principal or exceptional), the method 
will proove at the same time that W' is a manifold. 
Consider a tube V, neighborhood of an orbit whose stabilizer is Z/m (m might 
be 1), and write n = mk. On V 9!! B1 X D2, B1 acts by 
t· (z,u) = (trnz,rVu). 
Take the quotient of the tube by Z/n C B1: 
The quotient V'is a solid torus as well and the quotient map an n-fold branched 
covering ramified along the central orbit when it is exceptional, that is when m ~ 2. 
Looking at each tube, we see that the quotient W' of W by Z/n is a manifold. 
Look now at the B1-action. The diagram 
V

V

V' 
(tmz, t-Vu) 
1--+ (tmk zk, rvmkumk) = (tnz,t-vnU) 
shows that the B1-action on V (resp. W) induces an action of B1/(Z/n) on V' 
(resp. W') which obviously is effective and principal: after identification of B1 and 
B1/(Z/n) by t ...... tn it can be written on tubes (tZ, t-VU). 0 
The quotient of W' by this principal action is the same surface B that was the 
quotient of W: each orbit of the action on W gives one and only one orbit in W'. 
3.4.2 
To define an Euler class for the B1-action on W, one can try to divide by 
n the Euler class of the principal action just defined on W'. We need then to verify 
that the rational number obtained in this way does not depend on the choice of n. It 
is of course sufficient to understand what happens when a multiple n' of n is chosen: 
Proposition 3.4.3 Let (t, x) ...... t . x be a principal B1-action on a 3-manifold W, 
and let W' be the quotient by the subgroup Z/k of B1. Make 8 1 9!! Bl/(Z/k) act on 
W'. The Euler class e' of the new action is e' = ke. 

Examples: 2 and 3-dimensional Sl-manifolds 
35 
Figure 13 
Proof. 
Use the same notations as in 3.2. Let p be the projection of W on W'. If u 
is a section of W - Vo ...... B - Do, then po u is a section of W' - Vb ...... B - Do. 
In figure 13, a and b represent meridian and orbit in oVo and a' and b' represent 
analogous objects in oVb. Now, p* : 1I"lOVO ...... 1I"loVb sends a on a' and bon kli and 
of course it sends the class of ou onto that of o(p 0 u). Thus: 
a' - e'b' = [ou'] = [o(p 0 u)] = p.(a - eb) = a' - keb'. 
o 
Thus we get a well defined Euler class e E Q for all (oriented, with oriented base 
space) Seifert fibrations.

/3, (m., /3.), ... , (mr, /3r)) is

Hint: both sides are the same in the case of a principal action. 
Exercise 3.4.5 Show that the SI-action on S3 by 
(where ml and m2 are relatively prime) has invariants: (0 11, (m., /3)(m2' m2 - a)) 
with /3m2 - ami = 1. Hint: the orbit invariants having been calculated in 3.3.5, it is 
easy to compute the Euler class, then everything follows from the previous exercise. 
There exist other definitions of the Euler class of Seifert fibrations. We shall 
have the opportunity to meet one more. The interested reader may consult [23] for 
a rather complete list of definitions. .. and references. 

Chapter II 
Symplectic geometry 
Before defining symplectic manifolds, recall a family of examples we shall use as a 
guide in this chapter. 1 am speaking of the 1f.>.'s we have already met: 1f.>. is the 
set of all n x n hermitian matrices with given spectrum A = (AI, ... , An) ERn. We 
already know that 1f.>. is indeed a manifold, as an orbit of the compact group U(n) 
(see 1-1.3) acting by conjugation on the vector space 1f. of all hermitian matrices. 
Moreover the 1f.>.'s are symplectic manifolds. 
1 
Symplectic manifolds 
1.1 
Symplectic vector spaces 
These are real vector spaces endowed with non degenerate alternating bilinear forms. 
Example. Consider en as a real 2n-dimensional vector space, and the form 
w(X, Y) = Im(X, Y) 
where the brackets denote the standard hermitian form. 
This example is in fact the only example: recall the 
Proposition 1.1.1 II w is a nondegenerate alternating bilinear lorm on a finite 
dimensional vector space E, there exists a symplectic basis (el, ... , en, ft, ... , In), 
i.e. such that w( ei, Ii) = Si,;, and w( ei, ej) = w(fi,/j) = O. 
The proof is left as an exercise. 0 
In particular the dimension of E is even and is the only invariant of the isomor-
phism type of (E,w). 
Example of a symplectic basis. If (el, ... , en) is a unitary basis in en, and if we 
write Ii = -iej, then 
Im(ej, fA,) = -Im(ej, ie,,) = -Im( -i(ej, ek» = (ej, e,,) = Sj,,, 
and, analogously, w(ej,e,,) = w(fi>IIo) = 0, thus (el, ... ,en,-iel, ... ,-ien ) is a 
symplectic basis. 
37 

38 
Symplectic geometry 
1.2 
Symplectic manifolds, definition 
We try now to understand what could be the definition of symplectic manifolds. 
One would first ask that each tangent space is endowed with the linear structure 
defined above: the manifold W would thus have a differential 2-form w, in other 
words for each x an alternating bilinear form w'" on T",W. One asks moreover that 
w'" is nondegenerate, which can be expressed by writing, if the dimension (obviously 
even) is denoted 2n 
n 
2n 
1\ w'" i 0 E 1\ T;W 
for all x, that is to say that the 2n-form wAn is a volume form on W. Note that, in 
particular, W must have a volume form and thus be orientable. 
In fact this will not be sufficient: we ask moreover that the calculus wallows on 
W is locally the same as that on en using the "constant" form. Let us write that 
form as a differential form: if each complex number is denoted by Zj = qj + iPh 
vectors in en are written X =q + ip, Y = q' + ip' (q,p ERn), then 
(X, Y) = 
(q + ip, q' + ip') 
w(X, Y) = -(q,p') + (p,q'). 
In other words 
n 
n 
W = L dpi 1\ dqi = d(LP,dq,) 
,=1 
;=1 
in particular, w is an exact form. 
One possible property to ask of a symplectic form is that it be exact. . . un-
fortunately, this will prevent the manifold W from being compact, which is a little 
embarrassing if one wants the 1t>. 's to be symplectic manifolds, because of: 
Proposition 1.2.1 If W is compact, there exists no 2-form which is both nonde-
generate and exact on W. 
Proof. We saw that w is nondegenerate if and only if wAn is a volume form. As 
W is compact, we know that volume forms cannot be exact1. But, if w was exact, 
w = do, then wAn = d(o 1\ wA(n-1». 0 
In fact, it was not a very good idea, in order to be able to calculate locally as in 
en, to use a. .. global property such as of exactness of a differential form. The right 
"local exactness" condition is that of closedness ... and now we are at the definitive 
Definition 1.2.2 A symplectic manifold is a pair (w,w) where W is a manifold 
and w a closed non degenerate 2-form. 
Of course we shall very often call W a symplectic manifold (where no ambiguity 
is possible). 
lIt is now time for the beginners to learn a little de Rham cohomology in chapter VIII of [11. 

Symplectic manifolds 
39 
Examples. 
1. Of course, c n with the constant form E dPi II dqi, is a symplectic manifold. 
2. If W is a manifold, consider the total space of its cotangent bundle, with the 
projection: 
7r : T*W ---+ W. 
On T*W, there is a canonical differential I-form, the Liouville form, 0, defined 
by: 
O(x,<p)(X) = !p(T x7r(X» 
where x E W,!p E T:W and X E T(x,<p)(T*W). It is easy to check that W = do 
is nondegenerate (and it is even easier to show it is closed)! If (ql>"" qn) are 
local coordinates on W, and if (Ph' .. , Pn) are the "dual" coordinates, then 
(p}, ... , Pn, q}, ... , qn) is a system of local coordinates in which 0 = E Pidqi 
et W = E dPi II dqi. We shall often refer to w as the symplectic form on 
the cotangent bundle2 • The example of c n above may be considered as the 
special case where W = R n, the imaginary coordinates playing the role of the 
cotangent ones. 
3. If W is a surface, then the notion of symplectic form coincides with that of 
volume form: all orient able surfaces may thus be potentially considered as 
symplectic manifolds. 
1.3 The Darboux theorem 
Let us check that it is indeed possible to calculate locally in symplectic manifolds 
as in c n • First of all, a theorem which asserts that, locally, all symplectic forms are 
isomorphic. 
Theorem 1.3.1 ([57][13]) Let Wo et WI be two symplectic forms on W which co-
incide at the point x. Then there exists a neighborhood Uo of x in Wand a map 
tjJ: (Uo,x) -+ (W,x) 
with .,p*WI = Woo 
Remark. The map tjJ necessarily is a local diffeomorphism because w~n = tjJ*wfn 
and because these two 2n-forms are volume forms. 
Corollary 1.3.2 (the Darboux theorem) Let x be a point in a symplectic mani-
fold (W,w). There exists a system of local coordinates (p},,,, ,Pn,qI, ... ,qn) centerd 
at x in which w = Edpi II dqi. 
20ne more example of an exact symplectic form, on a noncompact manifold. 

40 
Symplectic geometry 
Proof of corollary. Compare W with the (constant) form on T z W. The theorem 
does not allow this, the two formS not being defined on the same space. We must 
first use a local diffeomorphism T z W -+ Wand for instance the exponential of any 
riemannian metric will do. 
Thus let <p = exp", : Yo -+ Uo, where Yo C T z W and Yo C W are open subsets, 
so small that <p is a diffeomorphism. Define Wo = (<p-l)*W.,. Now Wo and ware two 
symplectic forms on Uo, which coincide at $ by definition. We can now apply the 
theorem: if necessary by restricting Uo, there exists a diffeomorphism t/J such that 
t/J*w = Woo If (Ph' .. ,Pn, qll' •• ,qn) are coordinates with respect to a symplectic 
basis of the vector space T z W, the local chart t/J 0 <p transforms them into a system 
of local coordinates in which W = E dp, "dq,. 0 
Proof of theorem. 
Apply the path method due to J. Moser (see [57]). This means 
that we consider the form We = Wo + t(WI - wo). It is closed, and, as Wo and WI 
coincide at $, it is symplectic (nondegenerate) at $ and thus on a neighborhood of 
$. 
As Wo and WI are closed, 80 is Wo -
WI and it is thus possible to find, on a 
neighborhood of $, a i-form <p such that dIP = Wo -
WI' One may assume that 
<p", = 0 
The 2-form w, being symplectic, it defines a pairing between tangent and cotan-
gent spaces, we thus get, for all t, a vector field X, dual to <po Consider now X, as 
a vector field depending on time, vanishing at $ for all t. Its flow It keeps $ fixed, 
thus one can find a neighborhood U of z where It is defined and which I, embeds 
in itself. 
We thus get: 
because £X,Wt = dix,w, + ix,dw, = dIP by Cart an and from the definition of <po The 
form Itwt does not depend on t, it equals Wo for t = 0, we deduce the result with 
t/J = It. 0 
1.3.3 
In case we need them later, notice both proofs become easily "equivariant 
proofs" if there is a Lie group G acting on W with Wo and WI invariant and z fixed; 
this is the reason why we used <p = exp", in the above proof instead of any local chart: 
it sufficef:1 now to choose an invariant metric to get equivariant local coordinates. 
Remark. A statement analogous to 1.3.1 for riemannian metrics would be defi-
nitely false: in the riemannian case, there is a local invariant which distinguishes 
between the neighborhood of a point and the tangent space at that point, namely 
the curvature. We have just proved that there exist no local invariants in symplectic 
geometry. 

Symplectic manifolds 
41 
1.3.4 
A more general result can be obtained by essentially the same method 
[13]. It describes tubular neighborhoods of isotropic submanifolds (these on which 
W vanishes) of W. It asserts in particular that if L is an isotropic submanifold of 
maximal dimension (then dim L = t dim Wand L is said to be lagrangian), a tubular 
neighborhood of L in W is (in a symplectic fashion) isomorphic to a neighborhood 
of the zero section in T* L (with the canonical symplectic form). 
1.4 Examples: U(n)-orbits in hermitian matrices 
Consider once again the group U{n) acting by conjugation on the vector space 1£ of 
hermitian matrices. We shall now check what was announced at the very beginning 
of this chapter: the 1£>.'8 are symplectic manifolds. Begin by a little (bi)linear 
algebra in the space of all hermitian matrices. 
Exercise 1.4.1 Show that 
1. On 1£, (X, Y) 1-+ tr(XY) is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form. 
2. For h E 1£ define an alternating bilinear form Wh on u(n) = TIU(n) = i1£ 
(space of skew-hermitian matrices) by 
Wh(X, Y) = tr([X, Y]h). 
Also Wh{X, Y) = tr{X{Yh - hY» and Yh - hY E 1£. 
3. The kernel of Wh is Kh = {Y E u(n) I [Y, h] = o}. 
4. Kh is the Lie algebra of the stabilizer of h (hint: differentiate the relation 
ghg-I = h). 
5. the Wh'S induce nondegenerate 2-forms on the orbits 1£>.. 
6. These 2-forms are closed. 
Thus all the orbits 1£>. under consideration are compact symplectic manifolds. 
Examples. 
• If all the eigenvalues AI" .• , An are distinct, put them in increasing (for exam-
pie) order. Any element in 'H.>. defines a family of pairwise orthogonal lines in 
en: its eigenspaces. One thus defines a bijection from 'H.>. onto the manifold 
of complete flags in en: 
associating to h the subspaces Pi = 11 $ ... EB Ii where Ii is the eigenspace 
corresponding to Ai. 
• On the other hand, if all eigenvalues are equal, there is only one point in the 
orbit. There is not much to say here. 

42 
Symplectic geometry 
• Suppose now that ~1 ::f ~2 = ... = ~n' Then the eigenspace associated 
with ~1 is a line and the one associated with ~2 is the orthogonal hyperplane. 
The map: ~.\ : 'H..\ _ pn-1(C) which associates the ~1-eigenspace with h is a 
diffeomorphism. We have thus exhibited a lot of symplectic forms on pn-1(C), 
one for each pair of distinct real numbers. 
1.5 Calibrated almost complex structures 
Recall we decided to call cn the unique example of a symplectic (real) vector space, 
and recall that all the manifolds we just studied are in fact complex manifolds. This 
is not accidental: on any symplectic manifold, there are almost complex structures. 
Recall that a complex structure on a real vector space E is an endomorphism 
J of E such that J2 = -1, and analogously, that an almost complex structure on 
a manifold W is a section J of the associated bundle End (TW) such that, at each 
point J: = -1. 
An almost complex structure J on a symplectic manifold (W, w) will be said 
calibratecP if J is an "isometry" of wand if the symmetric bilinear form w(JX, Y) 
is positive-definite at each point. 
Let us now show that calibrated complex structures exist on any symplectic 
vector space (E, w). First choose a euclidean scalar product (X, Y). As ( , ) and w are 
nondegenerate, the relation (X, AY) = w(X, Y) defines an isomorphism A : E _ E. 
Write the polar decomposition of A : A = BJ, were B is symmetric positive 
definite, A and B commute and J is isometric. 
Lemma 1.5.1 A is skew-symmetric, J is an isometry for w, J2 = -1 and JB = 
BJ. 
Proof. 
(X, AY) = w(X, Y) = -w(Y, X) = -(AX, Y) 
thus A is skew-symmetric. If one writes J = B-1 A, 
tJ = tAtB-1 = _AB-1 = _B-1 A = -J 
as J is an isometry one gets tJJ = 1, and thus J is indeed a complex structure. 
Moreover 
t(BJ) = trB = tJB = -BJ 
hence B and J commute thus A and J as well, and we are done: 
w(JX,JY) = (JX,AJY) = (JX,JAY) = (X,AY) = w(X,Y) 
o 
Consider now the scalar product defined by B: «X, Y» = (BX, Y) which is also 
w(JX, Y) ... this shows the existence, on every symplectic vector spece, of calibrated 
complex structures. 
3impIicitely: "by the symplectic form" . 

Hamiltonian vector fields and Poisson manifolds 
43 
Remark. The form « , » + iw( ,) is hermitian. 
Exercise 1.5.2 The very same proof, starting with a symplectic manifold (W,w) 
endowed with a riemannian metric, produces a calibrated almost complex structure 
J on W. Hint: use the fact that the map A ....... B of the polar decomposition is 
smooth (use B = JAtA). 
As usual, there is an equivariant version of all this. 
Remark. The symplectic form w induces a symplectic form on any submanifold of 
W which is preserved by a calibrated almost complex structure. Indeed, if Z I:. W 
is such a submanifold, j*w is nondegenerate: 
v X E TzZ - {O}, 3Y E TzZ such that w(X, Y) =f: 0 
because Y = J X works. 
1.5.3 
Assume now that W is a complex manifold. That is to say that we have 
found an integrable complex structure J (changes of coordinates are J-holomorphic). 
Suppose that (, ) is a hermitian metric on W. Its imaginary part is a (type (1,1» 
nondegenerate 2-form w. If it is symplectic, that is to say, if it is closed, one says 
that the metric is Kahler. The manifold W endowed with this metric and with 
the form w is also called Kahler. By its very definition, the complex structure is 
calibrated by the Kahler form. 
2 
Hamiltonian vector fields and Poisson manifolds 
2.1 
Hamiltonian vector fields 
Being nondegenerate, the symplectic form w defines a pairing between the tangent 
and cotangent spaces of W (already used in the proof of 1.3.1). In particular, for 
any function f : W -+ R, there is a symplectic analogue of the gradient, namely a 
vector field X I defined by 
(1) 
ix,w = df. 
We shall call XI the symplectic gradient of f or the hamiltonian vector field asso-
ciated with f. 
If X is the hamiltonian vector field associated with J, we shall also say that J is 
a hamiltonian for X. 
Remark. 
As w is non degenerate, the zeros of the vector field X I are precisely the 
critical points of the function J.

as symplectic gradient. 
Remark. If J is a calibrated almost complex structure, and if grad denotes the 
gradient for the riemannian metric w(JX, Y), then XI = Jgradf. 
Definition 2.1.2 A vector field X on W is hamiltonian if ixw is exact, locally 
hamiltonian if it is closed. 
One writes 1i(W) and 1i/oc(W) respectively for the 
spaces of hamiltonian and locally hamiltonian vector fields on W. 
Exercise 2.1.3 With the help of the map X 1-4 ixw, define an exact sequence of 
real vector spaces: 
Exercise 2.1.4 If a is a differential form and X, Yare two vector fields on W, 
show that 
(2) 
.cxiya - iy.cxa = i[x,y)a. 
One can check the formula when a is a I-form\ then by induction for decomposed 
k-formes 0'1 1\ 0'2 where 0'2 is a I-form. 
Suppose now w is a symplectic form and X and Y two locally hamiltonian vector 
fields. Then 
(3) i[x,y]w = .cxiyw - iy.cxw = (dix + ixd)iyw - iy(dix + ixd)w = dixiyw

vector field associated with X E u(n) on 1t (for the U(n)-action by conjugation) is

Hamiltonian vector fields and Poisson manifolds 
2.2 
The Poisson bracket on a symplectic manifold 
We have just defined a map 
(4) 
COO(W) __ X(W) 
f 
~ Xl 
45 
On the space X(W) of vector fields on W, there is a Lie algebra structure given 
by the bracket of vector fields. On a symplectic manifold, one can also define a Lie 
algebra structure on COO(W). 
Definition 2.2.1 If (W,w) is a symplectic manifold, the Poisson bracket6 of two 
functions f and g is defined by 
Thus {I, g} = ix/w(Xg) = df(Xg) = Xg . f and {I,.} is a derivation. 
Exercise 2.2.2 Using (3), show that 
Proposition 2.2.3 The Poisson bracket defines a Lie algebra SMlcture on COO(W). 
Proof. The only thing to do is to check the Jacobi identity. Writing that w is 
closed: 
(5) 
Suppose X; is the symplectic gradient of the function f; (i = 1,2,3) then: 
X I 'W(X2,X3 ) = Xl' {h,la} 
{{h,la} ,fd 
= w(X{h,I3},Xd 
= W(Xh [X2,X3)) 
from which it is easy to deduce that the relation (5) may also be written: 
which is precisely the Jacobi identity. 0 
In particular the map (4) is (up to sign) a morphism of Lie algebras. 
6Tronslator's Note: In French, Poisson=fish and the word for brackets means hook, which is 
the source of a lot of (unavoidable but) untranslatable jokes. 

46 
Symplectic geometry 
Exercise 2.2.4 For any nondegenerate (but not necessarly closed) 2-form won a 
manifold W one can define in the same way hamiltonian vector fields and a bracket 
{ ,} on functions. Show that w is closed if and only if {,} satisfies the Jacobi 
identity1. 
2.2.5 Poisson manifolds. More generally, we will call Poisson manifold any man-
ifold whose space of smooth functions has a Lie algebra structure { , } such that {I, .} 
is a derivation (i. e. satisfies the Leibniz rule) is defined. 
This notion was investigated by A. Lichnerowicz ([52]) and then by A. Weinstein 
([65]). 
It is strictly larger than the notion of symplectic manifold. Here is a family of 
examples of Poisson manifolds which are not symplectic. 
2.2.6 The dual vector space to a Lie algebra. Let 9 be a Lie algebra and let 
g* be the dual vector space. It is only a vector space: the Lie algebra structure of 9 
defines no canonical Lie algebra structure on g*; what it does define is a canonical 
Poisson structure, investigated mainly by A. A. Kirillov [10], B. Kostant [48] and 
J.-M. Souriau [12]: 
For I,g E C""(g*) and e E g* one writes: 
{I,g}(e) = (e,[d/e,dgd) 
where dIe: Teg* = g* -t R is identified to an element of 9 by the joys of biduality. 
The Jacobi identity for {, } is easily deduced from that of [,] in g. 
There is no reason why g* should be a symplectic manifold: nothing prevents its 
dimension from being odd for example. 
The perspicaceous reader will already have realised that there is a relationship 
between this general construction and that of the symplectic form on 1i>. in 1.4. We 
considered there G = U(n), 9 = u(n), the dual being identified to 1i = iu(n) by 
the scalar product tr(XY). Modulo these identifications, the formal analogy with 
the definition of { , } is only a particular case of a forthcoming result (3.3.5): when 
restricted to any orbit, the Poisson bracket is the one defined by the symplectic form 
of the orbit. 
3 
Symplectic and hamiltonian actions 
3.1 
Symplectic actions 
One says that a G-action on the symplectic manifold (W, w) is symplectic if any 
element g of G defines a diffeomorphism which preserves w: 
(6) 
g*w=w 
Let us write the infinitesimal version of (6): let X E 9 and let X be the associated 
fundamental vector field. Let 9t be the flow of X. If one differentiates (with respect 
7This is one more good reason to insist that only closed 2-forms are symplectic. 

Symplectic and hamiltonian actions 
47 
to time) the equation gtw = w, one gets: 
d 
Cx.w = dtgtwlt=o = o. 
Thus the infinitesimal versions of (6) is: VX e 9, Cx.w = O. Use now hoth the 
Cartan formula 
Cx = dix +ixd 
and the fact that w is closed, to get: 
dix.w = O. 
Proposition 3.1.1 If the G-action preserves the symplectic fonn w then all the 
fundamental vector fields of the action are locally hamiltonian. 0 
3.2 
Hamiltonian actions 
Consider now the following diagram 
COO(W) 
! 
1{(W) 
9 
! 
<-+ 1{/oc(W) -
Ht(WjR) -
0 
Definition 3.2.1 One says that the symplectic G-action on W is hamiltonian if 
there exists a morphism j'l of Lie algebms 9 _ COO(W) making the diagmm commute. 
In particular, it follows that fundamental vector fields are hamiltonian. 
Remarks. 
[9]. 
1. If the group is connected, each of its elements is a product of exponentials 
9 = expXt expX2 ••• expXn 
and thus the existence of 1', which always implies the infi~itesimal "symplectic-
ity" of the action, implies that here the action is actually symplectic. It is thus 
unuseful to require that the action is symplectic: this will he a consequence of 
the existence of the map p. 
2. Some authors, among them some of the best ones (for instance J.-M. Souriau, 
who was one of the inventors of hamiltonian actions [12), see also [11]), call 
hamiltonian an action for which there exists a map j'l making the diagram 
commute, without requiring that it is a Lie algebra morphism. Suppose that 
X 
1-+ j'lx is only a map from 9 to COO(W). Then j'lx is a function whose 
symplectic gradient field is X, in particular {j'lx, j'ly} is a hamiltonian for 
[X, Y). Thus it is always true that {ilx, ilY} - il[x,Y] is (locally) constant on 
W. We are just assuming here that the constant vanishes. 
8For all the calculus used in this chapter, it may be convenient to read J. J. Duistermaat's book 

48 
Symplectic geometry 
3. To finish with remarks, note that if G is commutative and W compact (the 
case we are mainly interested in), any lift il is automatically a Lie algebra 
morphism: the Lie bracket in g is trivial thus {il x, ily} is locally constant. 
The function ilx must have a critical point on W, which we assumed to be 
compact, thus there exists a point at which {ilx, ily} vanishes, and so it is 
zero everywhere. 
3.2.2 The moment map. Associated to ;;. is its moment map: 
1': W 
---+ g* = Hom(g,R) 
x 
t-+ 
(X""'ilx(x» 
Then the fundamental vector field X is the hamiltonian vector field of the function 
x ..... (1'(x),X), and it is easily seen that il is a Lie algebra morphism if and only if 
I' is a morphism of Poisson manifolds. Definition 3.2.1 can be reformulated in terms 
of I' instead of ;;.. 
Example. If H: W -+ R is any function and if the hamiltonian vector field X H is 
complete, its flow defines a hamiltonian R-action whose moment map is H. 
Exercise 3.2.3 If G is a Lie group acting on a manifold W, one defines a G-action 
on the cotangent bundle T*W by 
g(x,cp) = (g(x),cp 0 Tg(zo)g-l) 
where x E W, cp E T;W is a linear form TzoW -+ R. Check it is indeed a (left) 
action. Show that the Liouville form 0: is invariant9 (g*o: = 0:) and conclude that 
the action is hamiltonian, with ilx = -ixo:. 
3.2.4 Commutative groups. Suppose W is compact and the group is a torus T. 
Choose a basis Xl, ... ,X" of t. The existence of the moment map is equivalent to 
that of a primitive ilx, of ix,w for any i. It is thus sufficient, in order to define il, 
to write fl.x = E~=l ).iilx, if X = E~=l ).jXj. 
A special case: if Hl(Wj R) = 0 (for example if W is simply connected), any 
symplectic T-action is hamiltonian. The moment I' is then well-defined up to the 
addition of a constant vector of t*. 
Example. T" = {(t., ... ,tn ) E cn I ltd = I} acts on Cn by 
(tl , ... , tn) . (Z., . .. , zn) = (tIf., ... , tnzn ). 
This is a hamiltonian action with moment 
I'(Z., ... , zn) = ~(lzlI2 , ... , IZnI2) + cste E R n Q! (tn)*. 
One should notice that the image of I' is the "first quadrant" (Xl;::: 0, ... ; Xn ;::: 0) of 
R n, which is not unrelated to the convex polyhedra we shall encounter in the next 
chapter. 
91 found this example in V. I. Arnold's book [8], which 1 take this opportunity to recommend. 

Symplectic and hamiltonian actions 
49 
Exercise 3.2.5 Which surfaces admit symplectic (resp. hamiltonian) SI-actions? 
(Use the results of 1-3.1.) 
3.2.6 Semisimple groups. If 9 = [g, g], symplectic G-actions are hamiltonianlo• 
Actually we saw in 2.2 that if X and Yare locally hamiltonian, then [X, Y] is 
globally hamiltonian. But, if 9 = [g, gl, any element of 9 may be writen as a sum of 
brackets, and thus defines a fundamental vector field which is globally hamiltonian. 
This is the case, for example, for G = 80(3) or 8U(2). 
3.2.7 
The moment Jl was defined by a map {t : 9 -+ C""(W) such that {tx is 
a primitive of ixw. Thus it is not a priori unique. One can add locally constant 
functions ex such that 
{t[X,Y) + C[X,Y) = {{tx + cx, {ty + cy} = {{tx, {ty } = {t[X,Y) 
(that is c vanishes on [g, gD to {tx. 
Thus I-' is defined up to the addition of a constant linear form in the annihilator 
[g, g]O of [g, gl and in particular of any constant if G is commutative; however if G 
is semisimple it is unique. 
Before giving a list of examples, notice there is a simple procedure to construct 
examples: 
Proposition 3.2.8 If I-' is the moment map for a hamiltonian action of a Lie group 
G on a symplectic manifold W, then for any Lie subgroup H of G, the composition 
of I-' and the canonical projection: 
W ~ g* -+ ~* 
is a moment map for the induced action. 0

Any Lie group G acts on itself by conju-

is a map Adg : 9 -+ g. Letting g vary, one checks this defines a (left) action of G on 
its Lie algebra g, which is called the adjoint representation or action of G. It is the 
action which makes it possible to define the Lie bracket: 
lOCompact Lie groups whose Lie algebra satisfy 9 = [g, 91 are semisimple . 

50 
Symplectic geometry 
Exercise 3.3.2 The fundamental vector field 9 X associated with X E 9 by the 
adjoint representation is 
9 Xy = [X, Y]. 
To define the coadjoint action we merely have to transpose the adjoint G-action 
on g*: 
(Ad;e, X) = (e,Adg-IX) 
where greek letters denote elements in g*, latin ones those in 9 and brackets duality. 
Thus Ad* is a (left) G-action on g*. 
Exercise 3.3.3 The fundamental vector field on g* associated with X E 9 by the 
coadjoint action is defined by 
(7) 
A result which will be of great interest for us is the following proposition: 
Proposition 3.3.4 If G is a compact connected Lie group, the principal orbits of 
the coadjoint representation have a maximal torus of G as stabilizer. 
Sketch of the proof. 
IT G is compact, it is easy to define an invariant scalar product 
on its Lie algebra g, and this allows us to identify 9 with its dual. The proposition 
is then equivalent to: 
The stabilizer of any X E 9 for the adjoint representation contains a maximal 
torus. 
The infinitesimal analogue of this assertion, that is-the centralizer of any ele-
ment in 9 contains the Lie algebra of a maximal torus-is an easy consequence of 
the fact that all adjoint orbits meet the Lie algebra of any maximal torus (see [24]) : 
if X E t, its centralizer contains t. 0 
Remark. 
M. Duflo and M. Vergne ([33)) have shown that the principal stabilizer 
for the coadjoint representation is always a commutative subgroup (even if G is not 
compact). 
3.3.5 The symplectic form on the orbits. Just rewriting what we did for 1t>. 
in 1.4, one defines for any e E g* an alternating bilinear form on g: 
W(X, Y) = (e, [X, Y]). 
Lemma 3.3.6 The kernel of w( is the Lie algebra g( of the stabilizer of e E g* for 
the coadjoint representation. 

Symplectic and hamiltonian actions 
51 
Proof. Let X, Y E g. By the very definition of Ad*, we have: 
Differentiating at 0 with respect to t: 
= (e, [X, Y]) 
= we(X,Y) 
thus the kernel of We is {Ie. 0 
In particular, we defines a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form on {II ge which 
we know from 1-1.2 is identified with T e (G . e) c g*. We only need now to solve the 
following exercise to show that there exists a canonical symplectic structure on each 
coadjoint orbit, induced by the canonical Poisson structure of g*. 
Exercise 3.3.7 Show that We defines a closed 2-form on the orbit of e in g*. Hint: 
the tangent space to the orbit being generated by fundamental vector fields, it is a 
straightforward consequence of the Jacobi identity in g. 
3.3.8 Canonical moment map. Let G . e be an orbit in g*. We thus have a 
Lie group G acting on a symplectic manifold G . e and (obviously!) preserving the 
symplectic form and everything is so canonical that the following exercise is almost 
tautological: 
Exercise 3.3.9 The inclusion G . e c g* is a moment map for the G-action on its 
orbit. 
This construction generates a lot of examples, using 3.2.8. For instance we saw 
(3.3.4) that the principal coadjoint orbits have as type the conjugation class of any 
maximal torus. It is thus especially interesting to study the action of a fixed maximal 
torus T C G on these orbitsll . We deduce a lot of examples of torus actions on 
symplectic manifolds ... thus even if one is only interested in commutative groups, 
this excursion into noncommutativity was not unuseful. 
3.3.10 The U(n) case. Let us make the torus of diagonal unitary matrices act 
on the orbits 1{).. 
Exercise 3.3.11 The map 1{). ~ Rn, which aSsociates with any hermitian matrix 
its diagonal entries, is a moment map for the T-action. 
11 For instance, fixed points will be the points in the orbit whose stabilizer is precisely T and not 
one of its conjugates. 

52 
Symplectic geometry 
Example. Put ~ = (~1. ~2 •...• ~2)' We saw in 1.4 that 1i). was a complex projective 
space pn-1(C). We thus exhibited a hamiltonian Tn-action on pn-1(C). 
Exercise 3.3.12 Show that the composite map 
pn-1(c) ~ 
1i). ~ 
t* = R n 
(that is the moment map for the T-action on pn-1(C) endowed with the canonical 
symplectic form of 1i).) is 
[Zl ••.•• Zn]t-+ (.xl - .x2)(lztl2 •...• IZnI2) + (~2 •...• .x2) 
where (Zl ..... Zn) is of unit length. Describe its image in Rn. 
3.3.13 The 80(3) case. The Lie algebra .60(3) is that of 3 x 3 skew-symmetric 
matrices. Identify it with R3 in such a way that the Lie bracket becomes the vector 
cross product and with its dual .60(3)* with help of the euclidean scalar product of 
R3. 
Exercise 3.3.14 The adjoint and coadjoint actions are then identified to the usual 
80(3)-action on R3 (by rotations). 
The coadjoint orbits are thus the point 0 and the concentric 8 2's (with 80(2) 
stabilizer). 
3.4 
Some properties of moment maps 
With p. we have a map from W into a vector space which will allow us to inves-
tigate the group action. 
Example. In the case of an 8 1-action with fundamental vector field X (for X a 
basis of the Lie algebra .1 !il!! R), the map p : W -+ R is a primitive of ix..w. 
Thus the fixed points of the 8 1-action are the critical points of a function ... which 
makes life easier: we already know for example that if W is compact (and the 
action is nontrivial) there will be at least two components in the fixed point set12 
(corresponding to extrema of p.). 
3.4.1 
The tangent map 
TzW~g* 
is by definition the transpose of 
12This is not necessarly the case for a general SI-action as the reader may check by making SI 
act on S4 as an ad hoc subgroup of SO(5). 

Symplectic and hamiltonian actions 
53 
In particular, 1m T,.I' is the annihilator in g* of Ker fT.,1' that is the annihilator 
of 
{x E g I (ixw)., = o} = {X E g I x., = O} = g,. 
Thus the rank of T.,I' is the dimension of the orbit of x and in particular 
Proposition 3.4.2 I' is a submersion at x if and only if G., is discrete. 
This property is indeed equivalent to the nullity of g.,. 0 
Corollary 3.4.3 If G is a commutative group acting in an effective way on the 
symplectic manifold W with moment map I' : W -+ g* then I' is a submersion on 
the open dense subset of principal orbits in W. 
Proof. We already know that the principal orbits' stabilizer is the discrete subgroup 
{I} C G. 0 
If G is not commutative, it may happen that I' is nowhere submersive, even if 
the action is effective: 
Example. SO(3) acts on S2 x W by the usual (effective) action on S2 and by the 
trivial action on W. It preserves the "product" symplectic form WI ffi W2, and the 
moment map 
has a sphere S2 as image (and in particular contains no open dense subset of 90(3)*) 
and I' is nowhere submersive. 
Exercise 3.4.4 Show that Ker T.,I' is the orthogonal (for W.,) of the tangent space 
to the orbit. 
3.4.5 Equivariant moment map. The moment map I' sends a G-manifold W 
into another G-manifold g*, it is thus natural to ask whether it is equivariant. 
Let us consider any X E g and let us show: 
(8) 
Thanks to relation (7), on the one hand: 
(g* X ,,(.,) , Y) = 
(I'( x), [Y, Xl) 
= 
-j'i[X,Yl(x) 

54 
and on the other hand: 
= (W x." (iw.r.w)$) 
W.,(wY,WX) 
= - {px, py} (x) 
= 
-P[X,Y] 
0 
We have thus proved the infinitesimal version of: 
Symplectic geometry 
Proposition 3.4.6 Let I' be the moment map for the hamiltonian action of the 
connected group G on the symplectic manifold W. Then I' is an equivariant map. 
o 
This will endow hamiltonian actions with very specific properties, for example 
because 3.4.6 forces G", C G,,(z). Here is an example: 
Proposition 3.4.7 Let W be a symplectic manifold endowed with a nontrivial sym-
plectic action of G = SO(3) or SU(2). Then the stabilizer of the principal orbits is 
a commutative subgroup of G. 
Prool We saw in 3.2.6 that because G is semisimple, the action is hamiltonian. 
Let I' : W -+ g* be the (unique) moment map for this action. 
Let x be a point in W. Then Gz C G"(,,,) and the orbit stabilizers in g* are G or 
the circle 80(2) C 80(3) or SU(2) (see 3.3.13). 
If G", is not contained in SO(2), we have G"(,,,) = G, or p.(x) = o. If this was the 
case for all points of principal orbits, I' would vanish on an open dense subset of W, 
thus everywhere. But the operation would then be trivial. 0 
In the same way, one can show more generally (using 3.3.4) that, if I' is a submer-
sion at at least one point, then "the" stabilizer of the principal orbits is commutative 
and discrete. 
Exercise 3.4.8 Let x E W, then I' sends the orbit G . x into G . p.(x) C g*. Let 
W be the symplectic form of the orbit G . 1'( x). What can be said of the 2-form p.*w 
on G· x? 
3.5 Noether type theorems 
Consider now the "levels" of the moment map13 I' : W -+ g* of a hamiltonian G-
action on the symplectic manifold (W,w). The most classical form of E. Noether's 
theorem seems to be stated nowadays as: 
131 shall call level ( the inverse image p-l «() even if ( is not a number. 

Symplectic and hamiltonian actions 
55 
Theorem 3.5.1 Let H be a function on W which is invariant by the G-action. 
Then p is constant on the trajectories of the hamiltonian vector field X H • 
Proof. Indeed, if ")'(t) is a trajectory of X H , one can write, for any X e (I : 
1t < p o ")'(t),X > = < T-y(t)p(XHh(t))),X > 
< XHh(t», tT ..,(t)p(X) > 
= < XHh(t», (ixw)..,(t) > 
= W(X,XH)..,(t) 
= -dH..,(t)(X) 
But H is invariant and X a fundamental vector field of the action, and thus: 
H(exp(sX) . ")'(t» = Hh(t» 
which, when differentiated at s = 0, is: 
dH(Xh(t))) = o. 
o 
The field XH is thus tangent to the levels p-l({). 
3.5.2 Periodic hamiltonians. Begin by noticing that even the most trivial ex-
amples are akeady interesting: 
Example. G = SI and H = ,,: then the fundamental vector field is tangent to the 
hypersurfaces of constant "energy" H. 
Such a function is called a periodic hamiltonian. We see that all regular levels 
of a periodic hamiltonian are oriented submanifols endowed with a fixed points free 
Sl-action. For example in dimension 4, the regular levels are Seifert manifolds. 
We shall see later how it is possible to use the constructions of chapter I to study 
periodic hamiltonians. 
3.5.3 
Let us return to the general case. For { e (1* a regular value of p, call 
Ve = ,,-1({). As" is equivariant, the subgroup Ge C G keeps the set Ve invariant: 
if x e Ve and 9 e Ge, then ,,(g. x) = g. p(x) = g. {= e. 
Look now at what is happening to the symplectic form when we restrict it by 
the inclusion map je : Ve '-+ W : 
Lemma 3.5.4 j{w is a form whose kernel at x is T .,(Ge . x), its rank is constant 
(i.e. does not depend on x) and equals 2dim Ve + dim(G· {) - dim W. 

56 
Symplectic geometry 
Proof. 
By definition, Ker (jew)., = T., ~ n (T., lie )0; on the other hand, T., ~ = 
Ker T.,I' and we saw in 3.4.1 that Ker T.,I' = (T.,( G . x»O, thus 
Ker (jtw)., = Ker T.,I' n T .,(G . x). 
The tangent space T.,( G . x) to the orbit is generated by the fundamental vector 
fields W X. According to (8) 
W X E Ker T.,I' # g*x"(,,,) = 0 # X E g"(,,,) 
thus Ker (jew)., is generated by the fundamental vector fields coming from ge. Hence 
Ker (jew)", = T.,( G( . x) and its dimension is: 
dimGe - dimG., = dimG( 
(because { is a regular value so that G., is discrete) and its rank: 
rg(jew)., = dim lie - (dimGe - dimG.,) 
= dim lie -dimGe + dimG -dim W + dim lie 
.. 
, 
... 
dimG.( 
= 2 dim lie - dim W + dim G . { 
is constant on ~. 0 
Exercise 3.5.5 Show that this equality remains true if one merely assumes that 
lie is a submanifold whose tangent space is Ker T.,I' instead of { being a regular 
value. Hint: show that in this case dim G., = dim G - dim W + dim lie. 
These results allow to characterise the hamiltonian actions of abelian groups: 
Proposition 3.5.6 If G is connected and the action is effective, the three following 
properties are equivalent: 
1. G-orbits are isotropic 
2. I' is constant on any orbit 
3. G is commutative. 
In this case, dim W ;::: 2 dim G 
Proof. G· x is isotropic if and only if T",(G· x) c T.,(G· x)O = KerT",I'. In this 
case, for any X, Y E g, the map x 1-+ -W.,(K.."l::.,) is identically zero. But we saw 
(relation (3» that its differential is ilX..rJw. Thus ilX..rJw = 0, from which it follows 
that IX, Y] = 0 and, thanks to 1-(1), that IX, Y] = 0 for any X, Y E G, and so G is 
commutative. 
Reciprocally, if G is commutative, Ge = G for all { in g* and thus Ker j(w is the 
whole tangent space to the orbit which is thus isotropic. 0 

Symplectic and hamiltonian actions 
57 
The inequality in 3.5.6 is easily generalised: 
Proposition 3.S.7 Let W be a symplectic manifold endowed with a hamiltonian 
action of a compact connected Lie group G, with moment map I' : W --. g*. Let T 
be a maximal torus in G. If I' is submersive in at least one point in W, then 
(9) 
dimG + dimT :5 dim W. 
Proof. 
It is sufficient to observe that the rank of (few)", is a nonnegative integer, 
and to compute: 
rgj(w = 2 dim Ve -dim W + dimG· e 
= 2( dim W - dim G) - dim W + dim G . e 
= dim W - 2 dim G + dim G - dim Ge 
thus dim W ~ dim G + dim Ge ~ dim G + dim T, thanks to 3.3.4. 0 
For example a manifold endowed with a symplectic SO(3)-action whose moment 
map is submersive at one point has dimension at least 4. The hypothesis "submer-
sion at one point" is necessary: for example the 80(3)-action on the unit sphere 8 2 
by isometries preserves the volume form and is thus symplectic. 
3.6 
Symplectic reduction, examples 
3.6.1 
The essence of what is called symplectic reduction is. contained in a rather 
obvious algebraic lemma. Recall that we call coisotropic any vector subspace (resp. 
submanifold) of a symplectic vector space (resp. manifold) whose symplectic or-
thogonal is isotropic: FeE is coisotroic if and only if Fa C F. 
Lemma 3.6.2 (Symplectic reduction) Let E be a vector space endowed with a 
(constant) symplectic form w. Let F be a coisotropic subspace. Then: 
1. the form w induces a symplectic form on F / Fa. 
2. ifG is any isotropic subspace transverse to F, then the composite map GnF c 
F --. F / Fa is the inclusion of an isotropic subspace. 
The proof is easy enough to be left as an exercise. 0 
3.6.3 
Straightaway, we have an application. Consider a torus T acting effectively 
on a compact symplectic manifold (W,w) with moment map I' : W --. t*. We know 
that in this case there must exist regular values. Let e such a value. For x E Ve, we 
have: 
T",Ve = KerT",1' = (T",(T· xW. 
Moreover, the tangent space to the orbit, being generated by fundamental vector 
fields, is isotropic since T is commutative (3.5.6). Thus T", Ve is coisotropic and its 

58 
Symplectic geometry 
orthogonal is the tangent space to the orbit. Hence w", induces a nondegenerate 
alternating bilinear form on T",\'efT",(T. x). 
The T-action on W defines by restriction a T-action on the level \'e, of which we 
know that all its stabilizers are finite: T",1l is surjective thus l* is the annihilator of 
lz. 
H moreover all these stabilizers are trivial, in other words if the T-action on the 
regular level Ve is free, then the quotient \'efT is a manifold BE (with dimension 
dim W - 2 dim T) and T", \'efT ",(T. x) may be identified to its tangent space at point 
[x] = T . x. Thus: 
Proposition 3.6.4 If the torus T acts freely on the regular level Ve of the moment 
map Il : W -+ l*, then the orbit space \'efT is a manifold naturally endowed with a 
symplectic form 0'( called the reduced symplectic lorm. 
Prool. The form defined by w", sur T", \'efT ",(T . x) does not depend on the point x 
we chose in the orbit T . x, thanks to the invariance of w. In the diagram 
0'( is defined by 
(10) 
P(O'E = itw 
from which it follows that p(dO'( = 0 and that O'E is closed. 0 
Exercise 3.6.5 Consider the Sl-action on en by multiplication 
Show that it is hamiltonian with moment map 
Check that all non-zero real numbers are regular values of Il. What are the reduced 
symplectic manifolds obtained by symplectic reduction of the regular levels? 
3.6.6 Symplectic orbifolds. In general, the torus action may well have excep-
tional (i. e. with finite stabilizer) orbits in regular levels. It is then no longer ab-
solutely correct that the orbit space B( is a symplectic manifold. We have already 
met this kind of problem in 1-3.3.1 where the topological structure of the quotient 
B( happened to be enough for what we needed. Now we have to look carefully at 
what is preserved of the differentiable structure near singular points in order to be 
able to speak of a symplectic form on the quotient. 

Symplectic and hamiltonian actions 
59 
The right notion here is that of orbifold, invented by Satake [611 under the name 
of V -manifold. The idea of a symplectic form on an orbifold was made precise by 
A. Weinstein in [641. 
Locally, orbifolds are the open subsets of the quotient spaces Rn Ir, where r is 
a finite group equipped with a representation p in GL(n,R) whose fixed point set 
has codimension at least two. The local isomorphisms U1 -t U2 are the pairs (<p, 1'), 
where l' : r 1 -t r 2 is a group homomorphism and <p : 61 -t 62 is a diffeomorphism 
of the saturated open subsets of Rn, over U1 et U2 , and all the diagrams: 
are commutative. 
Definition 3.6.7 An orbifold is a topological space modeled on the local structure 
just described. 
A differential form on an orbifold is of course given by the prescription, on each 
open local chart U, of a differential form (that is a r -invariant differential form on 
fJ). 
A symplectic form is a 2-form, which, in each local chart, is closed (local notion!) 
and non degenerate. 
Example. r = Z/m acts by rotations on R2. Then R2/r is an orbifold. The 
surfaces B, quotients of Seifert manifolds we discussed in 1-3.3.1 are orbifolds. 
Proposition 3.6.8 If Ve is a regular level of the map p. : W -t t*, then the orbit 
space Be = VeIT is an orbifold, natumlly endowed with a reduced symplectic form 
/Te· 
Proof. 
We saw that for any point x, w'" induces a nondegenerate alternating bilinear 
form on T", VeIT ",(T . x) = E", which is a slice at x for the T-action on Ve. A 
neighborhood of T . x in Ve has the form T XT% E"" and thus a neighborhood of x 
in Be has the form E",IT",. Now T", is a finite group of isomorphisms of E"" and we 
may assume that it preserves a complex structure (calibrated by the form induced 
from w"'). The dimension of its fixed point set is both even and positive, thus is ~ 2. 
o 
Example. If H is a periodic hamiltonian on a compact 4-dimensional symplectic 
manifold, its regular levels are Seifert manifolds, with oriented topological surfaces as 
base spaces (one should check that symplectic orbifolds are oriented). We shall see in 
chapter IV that all the Seifert manifolds we met in 1-3.3 appear in this framework. 

Chapter III 
Morse theory for hamiltonians 
The most famous and spectacular theorem we shall prove in this chapter is the 
convexity theorem of Atiyah [18] and Guillemin-Sternberg [38] which asserts that 
the image of a compact symplectic manifold under the moment map of a hamiltonian 
torus action is a convex polyhedron (see 4.2.1). 
In the case of the hamiltonian action of a torus, the fixed points are the critical 
points of a function. This is why the study of hamiltonian actions is in some sense 
easy: one can use Morse theory. We shall not avoid it here, so we shall begin by 
proving that the functions under consideration have very convenient properties from 
that point of view (Frankel's theorem [36], here 2.2.1, from which we shall derive, like 
Atiyah, the basic theorem 3.2.1 announced in the introduction, then the convexity 
theorem itself and some applications). 
Morse theory will also be used, in a rather nice way, in chapter IV. It also plays 
a role in more difficult problems, for instance in the results analogous to 4.2.1 for 
noncommutative groups, which for a rather long period were not completely solved. 
Then F. Kirwan succeeded in [47] with the help of the function 111'112 , which is rather 
degenerate, but has nevertheless enough of the properties of Morse functions to be 
handled and give results [46]1. 
In this chapter, we thus consider a symplectic manifold endowed with the hamil-
tonian action of a torus T, with moment map I' : W -+ t*.

Critical points of almost periodic hamiltonians 
1.1 
Almost periodic hamiltonians 
We know that the fixed points of T correspond to certain critical points of 1'. It 
would be more convenient to have a single function (with values in R) allowing to 
study the whole T-action. It is not very difficult to find: choose any X E t which 
generates T in the sense that the one parameter subgroup exp(tX) is dense in T. 
The associated hamiltonian 
W ~

--~--------------------
1 It seems that there is an alternative way to prove this theorem (29). 
61 

62 
Morse theory for hamiltonians 
has the fixed points of T as critical points. 
This leads us to the 
Definition 1.1.1 A function H : W -+ R is an almost periodic hamiltonian if the 
flow of its symplectic gradient X H generates a subgroup of the group of all diffeo-
morphisms of W the closure of which is a torus. 
Remark. The closure of the subgroup generated by any vector is a commutative 
subgrouPi it is thus equivalent to require that the subgroup generated by XH is 
compact. 
1.2 Critical points 
Let us now investigate the fixed points of an almost periodic hamiltonian H. Call 
T the torus "generated by H". The critical points of H are the zeros of X H , or the 
fixed points of T. We saw (1-2.2.2) that this set Z is a submanifold in W. 
The symplectic form w is preserved by T and by definition2• With the help of 
an invariant riemannian metric, one derives a calibrated almost complex structure 
J and a hermitian metric (see 11-1.5). 
Let z E Z. Then the torus T acts on the complex vector space T .. W preserving 
J and the hermitian form, that is to say, as a subgroup of U(n). Notice first that all 
these transformations are diagonalisable: the exponential map t -+ T is onto and 
the elements of t, sitting in u(n) (the skew-hermitian matrices) cannot avoid being 
diagonalisable. As T moreover is commutative, there is a basis of T .. W in which all 
the elements of T are diagonal. We can thus write: 
(1) 
where Va is the subspace of fixed points of T, in other words T .. Z c T .. W, and each 
Vj is T-invariant. 
Let us look at how expXH acts on this decomposition: on each Vj, it acts as 
multiplication by some scalar exp( i~i) where ~i is real (XH Etc u( n)), and nonzero 
if j ::f:. 0 as XH generates the whole torus T. Remark by the way: 
Proposition 1.2.1 Each component of the set Z of zeros of the almost periodic 
vector field X H is a symplectic sub manifold. 
Actually we just saw that it is almost complex for a structure calibrated by w. 
o 
At each fixed point z, the above gives the second derivative of H: 
Proposition 1.2.2 The second derivative of H at the critical point z, is, in the 
above notations, the hermitian form

or

and in these coordinates

Also remark that the second derivative is nondegenerate in the direction trans-
verse to the fixed submanifold. This leads us to the next notion. 
2 
Morse functions (in the sense of Bott) 
2.1 
Definitions 
A function f on a manifold W is called a Morse function if its critical set is a 
submanifold of W, and if its second derivative is a nondegenerate quadratic form in 
the transverse directions. 
Example. If the critical points are isolated, it means that the second derivative is 
non degenerate and f is a Morse function (in the sense of Morse!) 
One uses a Morse lemma "with parameter": 
Proposition 2.1.1 There exist local coordinates (x, y) in the neighborhood of the 
point z of the critical sub manifold Z in which 
1. The submanifold Z is described by y = O. 
2. The function f may be written 
f(x,y) = f(z) + q",(y) 
where q", is a quadratic form, nondegenerate in the y variables (transverse to 
Z). 
Proof. All the constructions in the classical proofs of Morse lemma (see [14] for 
example) can be parametrised without any difficulty. 0 

64 
Morse theory for hamiltonians 
The index of the second derivative (number of "negative squares") is locally 
constant along the critical submanifold. Its value on a connected component Zi will 
be called the index of the critical submanifold Zi and denoted by ~(Zi)' 
Thanks to the Morse lemma, one can construct subbundles (all isomorphic) of 
rank ~(Zi) of the normal bundle to Zi on which the second derivative is negative. 
Such a subbundle is called "the" negative normal bundle. 
2.2 
Frankel's theorem 
The previous section may be resumed in 
Theorem 2.2.1 ([36]) Let H be an almost periodic hamiltonian on a symplectic 
manifold (W,w). Then H is a Morse function, all critical submanifolds of which 
have an even index. 0 
2.3 
Perestroika 
In the case of isolated critical points, one can reconstruct3 the manifold with the 
help of the critical points and their indices (see [14]). When he introduced these 
more general Morse functions, Bott proved that that was also the case for them. 
Let, for a E R, WI> = {x E Wlf(x) ::; a} and v.. = {x E Wlf(x) = a} the level a. 
The two main results of the theory are 
Theorem 2.3.1 If W is compact and if the inteMJal [a, b] c R contains no critical 
value of f, then Wb is diffeomorphic to W".

Hence the topology does not change if we are not going through a criticallevelj 
here is what happens when we cross one: 
Theorem 2.3.2 If c E [a, b] is the unique critical value of f in this interval, the 
homotopy type ofWb is described by the addition to W" of the negative normal bundle 
of the critical submanifold at level c. 
In figure 1, the critical submanifold is a point, and its negative normal bundle 
an interval.

Sketch of a proof of theorem 2.3.1 (see (14)). 
Choose a riemannian metric on W, 
thus getting a gradient vector field grad f, which does not vanish on f- 1(a, b1. Modify 
it with the help of a differentiable function p on W which takes the value 
IIgr~/n' on f- 1[a, b1 
and which vanishes outside a neighborhood, as follows: 
x = pgradf. 
Calling CPt the flow of X, it is easily checked that CPb-,. sends Wb onto W,.. 0 
Proof of theorem 2.3.2. 
Let Z be the critical submanifold corresponding to c and 
U. be a small enough tubular neighborhood of Z in W. Let us now describe the 
homotopy type of the pair 
o 
(We, We) nu. 
Let furthermore N be the normal bundle to Z in Wand E the negative normal 
bundle along Z. Identify U. to a part of N, thus getting a projection p : U. -+ Z, 
and call A. the image of E : 
and A; the complement of Z in A. (see figure 2).

Connectivity of the fibers of the moment map 
Let us begin by stating and proving the key result of [19]. 
3.1 
Connectivity of levels 
Theorem 3.1.1 If f is a nondegenerate function (in the sense of Bott) which has 
no index 1 or n - 1 critical submanifold, then it has a unique local minimum and a 
unique local maximum. Moreover, all of its non empty levels are connected. 
Proof. Use theorem 2.3.2: the homotopy type of W" can change only by crossing a 
critical level, in which case it changes by adding to W" the negative normal bundle of 
the critical submanifold. IT it has index zero, that is if it is a local minimum, we add 
a connected component. To connect all pieces later on, as W is connected, we must 
go through a new critical level, for which the sphere bundle of the negative bundle 
must be connected ... but this is impossible except if the index of the submanifold 
is 1. Thus it is seen that there can be only one local minimum, and, applying the 
result to - f, only one local maximum 
Moreover W", and for the same reasons W - W" = {xlf(x) ~ a} are connected. 
Assume v;, = f-l(c) is a nonconnected level. Any component of v;, thus defines a 
nontrivial element in H .. -1(We) (any coefficients). But this group is zero: indeed, 
if c is strictly contained between the minimum and the maximum of f, the criti-
cal sublmanifolds of critical levels lower than c all have negative normal bundle of 
dimension :5 n - 2 which cannot create H .. - 1• 0 
3.2 
Case of almost periodic hamiltonians 
From theorems 2.2.1 et 3.1.1, one easily deduces: 
Corollary 3.2.1 Let (W,w) be a compact connected symplectic manifold and let 
H : W -+ R be an almost periodic hamiltonian. All levels H-1(t) of H are empty 
or connected. 0

Application to convexity theorems

Theorem 4.1.1 Let A be any n X n complex matrix, and let A E Rn. The image of

C 
1--+ tr(AX) 
is a convex set in C. 
Begin by proving a direct application of 3.2.1: 

Application to convexity theorems 
67 
Lemma 4.1.2 If (W,w) is a symplectic manifold and if hand h are two func-
tions, whose hamiltonian vector fields generate a relatively compact subgroup in the 
diffeomorphism group of W, then the image of fl X h is convex in R2. 
Proof of the lemma. Let H : W -4 R be any projection of fl x h. Its hamiltonian 
vector field generates a relatively compact subgroup, thus H is almost periodic. Its 
fibers are connected ... but all these fibers, when H varies, are all the intersections 
of the image of h x h with the straight lines in R2. Hence this image meets any 
straight line in an interval, thus it is convex. 0 
Proof of the theorem. Apply the lemma to 
The only thing we need to check is that the hamiltonian fields of fl and h generate 
a relatively compact subgroup in the whole diffeomorphism group of 1i>,... it is 
true because they are fundamental vector fields for the action of U(n) on 1i>" the 
generated subgroup then being a subgroup of the compact group U(n): indeed if one 
writes A = U + iV with U and V hermitian, then h(h) = tr(Uh), h(h) = tr(Vh), 
and fl is a hamiltonian for the vector field iQ, h a hamiltonian for the vector field 
iV, as we saw in 11-2.1.5. 0 
4.2 
Convexity of the image of the moment map 
Imitating the proof of lemma 4.1.2, we get Atiyah's proof of the Atiyah [19] and 
Guillemin-Sternberg [38] convexity theorem. 
Theorem 4.2.1 Let (W,w) be a compact connected symplectic manifold, and con-
sider n functions fl,'" ,fn on W. Assume the flows of their hamiltonian vector 
fields generate a subgroup in the whole diffeomorphism group of W whose closure 
is a torus. Then the image of W by f = (h, ... , fn) is a convex subset of Rn. 
Moreover if Zl,"" ZN are the connected components of the set of common critical 
points of the I; 's, then f(Zj) is a point Cj and f(W) is the convex hull of the points 
Cj. 
Remark. In particular, if I-' is the moment map for a hamiltonian action of the 
torus Tn on W, the choice of a basis of Tn identifies t* to Rn and the components 
of I-' to n functions h, ... .Jn satisfying the hypothesis of the theorem. The image 
of I-' cannot avoid satisfying its conclusion as well: it is a convex polyhedron in t*, 
the convex hull of the images of the fixed points of Tn. 
Proof of the theorem. Following Atiyah, call respectively An et Bn the statements: 
• f-l(t) is empty or connected for all tERn 
• f(W) is convex 

68 
Morse theory for hamiltonians 
in which n is the number of components functions of I. 
First consider the diagram: 
W 
J=(lt.:::::!,,+I) Rn+1 
1" 
Rn 
where 1( is any linear projection. The hypothesis applies to 9 = 1( 0 I: any connected 
closed subgroup of a torus is a torus. As in the proof of 4.1.2, all I(W) n 1(-I(t) = 
l(g-l(t» describe, when 1f and t vary, the intersections of I(W) with all straight 
lines in Rn+1. By An, g-I(t) is empty or connected, likewise its image by I, thus 
I(W) is convex. 
Let us now show by induction on n that An holds. Theorem 3.2.1 is exactly AI. 
Thus assume An to be true. Let ft, ... ,In+1 : W -+ R be n + 1 functions satisfying 
the hypothesis and let e = (el,'" ,en+1) E Rn+1. We want to show that 
r1(e) = 1;:I(el) n ... n 1;;~I(en+1) 
is empty or connected. By continuity, we may assume e is a regular value of I: if I 
has no regular value, one of the d/i is a linear combination of the others·, we may 
forget it and apply An. 
Then N = KI(el) n ... n 1;;1 (en) is a submanifold of W. By An, we know it is 
connected. 
Let us now check that In+1IN satisfies the hypothesis of theorem 3.1.1. Thus 
consider its critical points on N, in other words the points of W where (on W) dfn+1 
is a linear combination of the dl.'s: 
. 
n 
dln+1 = 'E >'idl.· 
.=1 
Let x E N be such a critical point. The >';'s are constants near x. Put F = 
In+1 - E >'d. and let Z be the component of critical points of F (on W) which 
contains x. The function F is an almost periodic hamiltonian on W as well, to 
which we cannot refrain from applying Frankel's theorem (2.2.1). 
Lemma 4.2.2 Z and N are transversal at x. 
Assuming the lemma to hold, then FIN has Z n N as a critical submanifold with 
even index; but, restricted to N, F = In+1 - E >,.ei, (and thus In+1) has the same 
property. We may then apply 3.1.1 to In+1IN, from which it follows that 
is connected, hence An+1 holds. 
4 Any linear relation E )'JdlJ = 0 is the translation of a relation E).J Xj = 0 in the Lie algebra 
of the torus generated by the I; 's: the ).J's are constMts. 

Application to convexity theorems 
69 
Proof of the lemma. We must show that dfl ( x ), ... , df n (x) are still independant 
when restricted to Z. Let Xt, ... , Xn be the hamiltonian vector fields associated 
to ft, ... , fn. They are tangent to Z because the Poisson brackets {Ii, F} van-
ish, but Z is symplectic, thus for all (at. ... ,an), there exists Y E T.,Z such that 
w(E aiX;, Y) t 0, which may be equally well written E aidfi(Y) t O. 0 
To finish with the proof of the convexity theorem, we have only to prove the last 
assertion. Let Zj be a connected component of the fixed points of the torus T gen-
erated by the hamiltonian vector fields Xt, ... , Xn. On Zj, all the Xi'S vanish, thus 
all fi'S are constant, this explaining why f(Zj) is a point Cj in Rn. Consider real 
numbers ~b .•. '~n generic enough in order that the one parameter subgroup gener-
ated by X = E ~iXi is dense in T and let <p = E ~di be an associated hamiltonian. 
Then Z is the critical set of <p, in particular the maximum of <p occurs on Z: hence 
the restriction of the linear form E ~iei on Rn to f(W) reaches its maximum at one 
of the c;'s ... and this true for almost any ~i, thus the image of W is contained in 
the convex hull of points Cj. We already know that it is convex and it contains Cj 
by definition, so we are done. 0 
Remark. Hence the vector fields Xl,'" ,Xn have common zeros (in other words 
the torus action does have fixed points): it follows from the theorem that Z is not 
empty, moreover, there may be a lot of those fixed points, as the following corollary 
shows. 
Corollary 4.2.3 Let T be an n-dimensional torus acting in an effective and hamil-
tonian way on a compact symplectic manifold (W,w). The action has at least n + 1 
fixed points. 
Actually, we noticed in 11-3.4.3, as the action is effective, that there exists at 
least one point at which the moment map ", is submersive, and thus open. Hence 
the image ",(W) is a convex polyhedron with non empty interior in Rn, thus has at 
least n + 1 vertices, which cannot avoid being the images of at least as many fixed 
points. 0 
This corollary generalises the remark we made for n = 1 at the beginning of 
11-3.4. 
4.2.4 Orbits, stabilizers and the image of the moment map. The polyhedra 
we get as images of moment maps are rather special ones. Applying the equivariant 
version of Darboux's theorem, we shall now investigate them and especially look at 
the "equations" of their faces. 
Let z be a fixed point of the hamiltonian action of torus Tn on the symplectic 
manifold W. The group Tn acts in a linear way on T.W as in (1) : 
T z W = Vi (9 ... (9 Vm 
where each V; is a complex line on which Tn acts by multiplication:

Call moreover a; the element of t* defined by 
(a;, ei) = a~ 
where (ell' .. , en) is the basis of t defined by the above decomposition. 
More intrinsically, the T -action on V; is defined by its character a; : T -+ 8 1 j 
differentiate, transpose, thus getting a map R -+ t*, and a; is the image of 1, the 
weight of the representation. 
Proposition 4.2.5 Let p = p(z) E t*. There exists a neighborhood U 0/ z in W 
and a neighborhood V 0/ p in t* such that 
p(U) = V n Op( all' .. , an) 
where Op( a., ... , an) denotes the convex cone with vertex p generated by (a., ... , an) 
in t*. 
Proof. 
Apply first Darboux theorem in its equivariantform (11-1.3.3) near the fixed 
point z: the exponential of any invariant riemannian metric 
exp: T%W --+ W 
conjugates the T-action on Wand the linear action on T % W described above. More-
over it sends a neighborhood Uo of 0 in T z W on a neighborhood U of z in W: If Uo . 
is small enough, one finds a T-equivariant map 
t/J : (Uo,O) --+ (T z W, 0) 
such that t/J* exp* w = woo 
We now have two moment maps: 
p' : T .. W :) Uo ~ 
U ~ 
t* 
on the one hand, and Po : T % W -+ t* associated to the linear action on the other 
hand. They differ only by a constant vector, we may thus fix po(O) = p'(O) = p(z) = 
p in order that they agree everywhere. 
Of course we have: 
and hence the image of U by p (as that of Uo by Po) is the cone p+ E~1 Uiai (Ui 2! 0). 
D 
Assume the action to be effective, thus the interior of the polyhedron P under 
consideration is non-empty (p being a submersion at some point).

Corollary 4.2.6 The hyperplanes which delimit the polyhedron P in l* have integral 
equations. 0 
This statement may be understood, either in coordinates, or, in a more intrinsic 
way, as follows: any hyperplane equation in l* may be writen as (X,e) = a for some 
X E t and a E Rj and in our case we can assume that X generates a circle S x in T 
(expX = 1). 
Choose one of these hyperplanes, say H, and such an "integral" vector X. The 
vector field X is periodic and is the symplectic gradient of the function 
x I-t (X,I'(x» = ilx(x). 
Let F C H be the face of P which is contained in H. Consider I'-I(F). By the 
very definition, ilx is constant on I'-I(F), that is to say that the circle Sx fixes all 
points of ,.cI(F), which is thus included in the union of the fixed submanifolds of 
Sx, and hence is a symplectic submanifold of W. 
As the T-action on W is effective, TfSx is a torus with an effective action on 
p-I(F). The open set consisting of principal orbits corresponds to those points x of 
p-I(F) for which 1m T.,I' = H (it is always included in H). In this case, (1m T .,1')0 = 
1Jx is indeed the Lie algebra of the stabilizer and in particular diml'-I(F) = dimH-
1. The moment map of the T/Sx-action on p-I(F) is obtained from 
• the exact sequence of groups 
Sx <-+ T -. TfSx 
• which may be differentiated, giving the exact sequence of Lie algebras 
0-+ 1Jx -. t -. tfsx -+ 0 
• and then transposed to 
0-+ (tfsx)* -. g* -. Sx -+ 0 
which exhibits (t/sx)* as a hyperplane of g* (parallel to H!). The moment map p, 
which takes its values in this hyperplane (up to translation), is the moment map for 
the action of the quotient group.

Application: a theorem of Schur on hermitian matrices 
We shall apply the convexity theorem to the action by conjugation of the torus of 
diagonal unitary matrices on hermitian matrices. Thanks to 11-3.3.10, we already 
know that the moment map of this action is: 
1{>. -. R" 
h ~ (hl.I!"" h ..... ) 
and the convexity theorem says: 
Corollary 4.3.1 ([62], and also [49,18,38]) Let h be a hermitian matrix with 
spectrum.\ = (.\1."".\") E R" and let S = {(.\u(I), ... ,.\u{,,»luE5,,}. Then 
the diagonal of h is in the convex hull S of S. Reciprocally, any point of S is the 
diagonal of a hermitian matrix with spectrum .\.

Morse theory for hamiltonians 
Proof. The only thing we have to check is that the points in S are the fixed points 
of T on 1t>.. It is thus enough to prove that an element h of 1t>. is fixed by T if and 
only if it is diagonal, but this is dear. 0 
Figure 3 
Remark. We have ht,t + ... + hn,n = tr h = >'1 + ... + >'n constant on 1t>., in 
particular, its image is included in a hyperplane and the action is not effective. 
In the case n = 3, figure 3 shows some examples. 
In the first picture, the three eigenvalues are distinct, 1t>. is the manifold of 
complete flags in C 3 and the image is a hexagon. In the second one, there are only 
two distinct eigenvalues, 1t>. is a complex projective plane and the image a triangle.

by Atiyah in [19].

Let N = card S, and let al,"" aN be the elements of S. The complex torus

Consider the orbit Xs of the point [1, ... ,1] of pN-l(C). It is parametrised by 
Zl = tOIl, ... ,ZN = tOlN t E (c*)n. 
Its closure Xs is a complex algebraic (in particular symplectic) submanifold of 
pN-l(C). 
The (real) torus 1'" c (c*)n acts on Xs with moment map

is the moment map for the linear (diagonal) TN -action and proj the (integral) projec-
tion RN -+ Rn defined by the transposition of the inclusion Tn C TN (see poposition 
II-3.2.8): the matrix of proj is the matrix of the N column vectors (at, ... , aN) of 
S. In particular the points at. ... , an of zn C Rn are the images of the points 
[1,0, ... ,0], ... , [0, ... ,0,1] of pN-l(C) by proj 0 Po. 
In the case of pN-l(C) and more generally on any Kahler manifold, Atiyah's 
paper [18] contains a theorem more precise than 4.2.1, which says here that the 
N points under consideration are in Xs and are exactly the fixed points of the 
Tn-action on Xs. It is not very hard to check it directly in our case (exercise). 
Thus I-'(Xs) = S, the convex hull of these points. 
Consider in the same framework the system (2). Its solutions are the intersection 
points of Xs and of the projective subspace V with equations 
N 
Ed..,z; = ° 
(1 ~ j ~ n).

If the c!.'s are generic, the subspace V has co dimension n, is transverse to Xs, 
and does not meet Xs - Xs (which has dimension < n). Thus (2) has a finite 
number of solutions, and this number is the intersection number of V and Xs (at 
least if the (a - (3)oJ3es generate the lattice zn), which is also the degree of the 
algebraic submanifold Xs. 
If w is the standard symplectic form of pN-l(C), it is both classical and easily 
checked that

But the moment map p : Xs -+ 8 is a fibration, with fiber T" having volume 1, 
thus Vol (Xs) = Vol (8) and we get the desired result. 
In order to make this proof correct without using Atiyah's theorem which we did 
not prove, we must be able to reduce to the case where 
1. X s is smooth, 
2. the a - p generate Z", 
both conditions which we implicitely assumed. Note first that if the a - P's generate 
a lattice of dimension < n, the two sides of the equality we want to prove vanish. On 
the other hand, if they generate a finite index lattice in Z", we may reduce to the 
case where they actually generate Z" by using a finite branched covering of Xs ... 
the same branched covering making Xs smooths. 
5Actually Xs is the toric variety associated with the polyhedron S (see chapter VI). 

Chapter IV 
About manifolds of this 
dimension 
My aim in this chapter is to present some of the many recently proven results about 
4-dimensional manifolds. 
The first classification theorem is due to P. Iglesias [43], who made a list of all the 
compact symplectic manifolds of dimension 4 which have an SO(3)-action which is 
symplecticl . The SU(2) case is handled in almost the same way (and is even easier, 
see appendix A). Then, T. Delzant [31] worked out the case of hamiltonian T2_ 
actions, as a special case of a rather general result which we shall come back to in 
chapter VI. In both cases, the inequality in 11-(9) is an equality: the dimension of 
the manifold is as small as possible. 
The case of Sl-actions is somewhat different. All Sl-actions on 4-manifolds were 
classified by Fintushel [35] a long time ago. Of course the symplectic (and even more: 
hamiltonian) character of the actions under consideration here changes the lanscape, 
mainly because, as we have already said, one can use Morse theory to study the fixed 
points. Free (principal) actions were investigated in detail by A. Bouyakoub [25]. It 
is reasonable to think that fixed point free actions may be handled in grosso modo 
the same pattern. Of course these actions do not have the ghost of a chance to 
be hamiltonian (all manifolds under consideration are compact). Actually, a very 
beautiful application of the fiber connectivity theorem (111-3.2.1) and of other tricks 
was given recently by D. McDuff [55]: in dimension 4, an Sl-action is hamiltonian 
if and only if it has fixed points. These methods allowed the author to easily give a 
classification of those 4-manifolds which may be given a symplectic form invariant 
by an Sl-action with at least one fixed point [21]2. 
I shall begin by explaining the proof of the theorem of D. McDuff [55], then I 
shall explain some of the results just mentionned. 
All the Sl-manifolds under consideration are endowed with invariant metrics and 
calibrated almost complex structures. 
lIt is necessarily hamiltonian according to 11-3.2.6. 
2 A longer and less geometrical proof of some of the results in [21] has since written down in a 
preprint [17].

Characterisation of those circle actions which are hamiltonian 
1.1 
Statement of the theorem 
In the paper [36] which we already met in chapter III, Frankel also showed, using 
Hodge theory, that, on a Ki.hIer manifold3 , a circle action preserving the Kahler 
form is hamiltonian if and only if it has a fixed point. Here is the very beautiful 
theorem of D. McDuff proven in [55]: 
Theorem 1.1.1 Let (W,w) be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 4, en-
dowed with an 8 1-action which preserves the symplectic form. 
Then, either the 
action has no fixed points and W is the total space of a bundle over 8 1, or it has at 
least one and it is hamiltonian. 
Remark. A. Bouyakoub had shown, in the case where the action is free and in [25], 
that the manifold is a bundle over the circle. 
1.2 Proof 
8ketch of the proof. 
1. It suffices to investigate the case where the cohomology class of the form [w] 
is integral. 
2. In this case, there exists a map h, taking values in 8 1, which generalises the 
moment map and has all the properties of a periodic hamiltonian (from the 
Morse theoretical viewpoint). 
3. Assuming the action not to be hamiltonian, one deduces, by an argument 
similar to 111-3.2.1, that h has no local extrema. 
4. By a nice argument using Euler classes of Seifert manifolds (1-3.4), one shows 
that there are no critical points at all. 
Proof. 
Proof of 1. The set of all invariant symplectic forms TJ such that iXTJ is exact is 
a closed subset in the set of all invariant symplectic forms. On the other hand, as 
close to w as one wants, there is an invariant symplectic form whose cohomology 
class is rational. Hence we get the existence of an invariant rational symplectic form 
w', such that, if ixw is not exact, then ixw' is not either. As w' is rational, multiply 
it by a large enough integer N making it integral (it stays symplectic). Of course 
ix(Nw') is as exact as ixw' is. Hence there exists a hamiltonian for w if and only if 
there exists one for Nw'. Rename Nw', giving it the sweet name of w. 0 
3Bee the definition in 11-1.5.3. 

Hamiltonian circle actions 
77 
Proof of 2. 
As w is integral, the closed I-form ixw is integral as well: if G is any 
I-cycle, then 'fiG, got by pushing G with the SI-action is a 2-cycle, and 
f ixw = 1 w. 
Jc 
'PC 
For any Xo (fixed) in W, the function h(x) = J:o ixw is thus well defined modulo Z 
and defines a map h : W --t 8 1 with h*d9 = ixw. 
The map h has the very same properties as a periodic hamiltonian: restricted 
to any W - h-l(9), it is a periodic hamiltonian. In particular, Frankel's theorem 
(III-2.2.I) applies in this (slightly more general) situation. 0 
Proof of 3. 
Suppose that the action is not hamiltonian, in particular that h is 
surjective. From Frankel's theorem, one derives, similarly to the proof of III-3.2.I, 
that the number of connected components of the fibers of h is constant: it may only 
change by critical submanifolds of index 1 or n - 1. ., which do not appear here, 
because all have even indices. If h is surjective, there is no local extremum. 0 
Proof of 4. 
Let us now use the dimension hypothesis, enumerating possibilities for 
the critical submanifolds, their dimensions and indices. They are either surfaces or 
isolated points. The index of any critical surface, being even, may only be 0 or 2, so 
the critical surfaces are extrema, but we just exclued that case. We still have only 
isolated critical points, the indices of which cannot be 0 nor 4. " in short: the map 
h has, at most, isolated index 2 critical points. 
Near such a point, the action may be linearised as usual: 
(1) 
t· (x, y) = (t"x, rqy) 
where t E 81, (x, y) E C 2, and p and q are nonnegative integers which we shall 
assume to be relatively prime (reducing to the case of an effective action). 
Consider two regular values a and b of h between which there is only one critical 
value c. The fibers V .. and Vb are 3-dimensional submanifolds of W, to which the 
vector field X is tangent without vanishing, so they are Seifert manifolds, exactly 
as in the case of a genuine hamiltonian. 
The trick to end the proof is the following: one shows that the Euler class of Vb 
is strictly larger than that of Va, hence, if some critical points actually appear, we 
get a nondecieasing function ... defined on the circle, which is absurd: after a while, 
one has to come back to V... 0 
It suffices thus to prove the 
Lemma 1.2.1 With notations as in (1), we have: 
1 
e(V .. ) - e(Vb) = --

78 
4-manifolds 
Proof of the lemma. We study the surgery which allows us to go from VII to Vb. 
Consider D~ X D; C 0 2• 
VII n (D; X D~) '" D; X S! 
using notations I hope to be clear, where one can see a type Z/q fiber (which I shall 
consider as exceptional even if q = 1). Also 
Vb n (D; X D~) '" S! X D~ 
where now y = 0 is the exceptional (at least if p ;:::: 2) type Z/p fiber. 
Hence, for any critical point at the level c, described by (1), surgery replaces an 
exceptional type Z/q orbit by a type Z/p orbit. 
Let u and v be the smallest positive integers such that 
(2) 
pv - qu = 1. 
Then by definition, (see 1-3.3.1), the Seifert invariants of the orbit x = 0 in VII are 
(q, v), those of y = 0 in Vb are (p, u). The other possibly exceptional orbits are the 
same in Vb and Va, and, calculating as in 1-3.4.4:

Symplectic reduction of the regular levels for a periodic hamiltonian 
Let H be a periodic hamiltonian on a 4-manifold. We know that the regular levels of 
H are Seifert manifolds VII and that enough is kept over from the smooth structure of 
VII after forming the quotient to enable us to say that the quotient B" is a symplectic 
orbifold (see II-3.6.6). 
The previous section gave us a hint of what was happening to Va when going 
through a critical value of H and we shall now concentrate on the adventures of B" 
during the same operation. 
2.1 
What happens near an extremum 
2.1.1 Near an extremum reached on a surface B. Call L the normal bundle 
of B in W, considered as a complex line bundle over B. Near each point z of B, 
both the action and the symplectic form are conjugate to the linear ones 
TzW 
= 
t·(u,v) = 
where m equals ±1 because of effectiveness (the sign depending on the kind of 
extremum we are dealing with). The v..'s (for a close to the critical value) are the 
circle bundles of L, the action is principal, and the quotient is identified with B. 

Symplectic reduction of the regular levels for a periodic hamiltonian 
79 
2.1.2 Near an extremum reached at an isolated point. With the very same 
method, we find ourselves in 0 2, with 
t· (U, v) = (tmu, t"V) 
where m and n have the same sign and are relatively prime. The hamiltonian 
may be written H = Hm lul2 + n lvl2). The levels close to the critical one are 
ellipsoids (topologically S3). If m or n ~ 2, there are one or two exceptional orbits. 
Considering 
v.. 
__ PI(O) 
(u,v) 
f--+ [u",vm ) 
one sees that the quotient surface of these regular levels is a sphere S2. 
2.2 What happens when going through a critical value 
As we are able to say that we are going through it, it follows that the critical level 
corresponds to some index 2 critical point. 
One more very beautiful remark due to Dusa McDuff is that the topology of the 
quotient surface does not change: 
Lemma 2.2.1 ([55]) Let a and b be two regular values of H. There exists a smooth 
map 
such that 
1. 1rWb : v" -t Bb is the quotient map. 
2. For any regular value t of H, there exists a homeomorphism 'f't making the 
following diagram 
commute. 
Proof. The lemma is obviously true when there is no critical value between a and 
b, because we merely need to push using the gradient flow of H to get 
H-I([a,b)) ~ 
v" ~ 
Bb 
with the desired properties. 
Then, it is enough to prove the lemma in the case where there is only one critical 
value between a and b. For this, we shall try to show, as above, that the topology 
of v.. does not change (!) and to understand where we are wrong. 
Let us thus try to prove that it is possible to retract H-1 ([a, b)) on v" by pushing 
along the gradient flow. 
If we push by the gradient up to the level b, any point of H-I([a, b)) has an 
image 'f'(m) which is well defined in v,,'" 
except those which fell into the hole, 

80

more precisely those of the stable manifold of a critical point at the level under 
consideration. 
If the action is written (tl'x, r
9y) in the neighborhood of a critical point we 
identified with C 2, the points of the y-axis are those which are forced to stay on 
the critical level. Associate with them the "points of the x-axis which are on Vb". 
Of course, this does not define a map into Vb. .. but notice that all these points lie 
in the same Sl-orbit in Vb, so that we have a perfectly well defined map into the 
quotient Bb, which is easily checked to have the required properties. 0 
Exercise 2.2.2 Let H be a periodic hamiltonian on a compact symplectic manifold 
W. Consider a neighborhood of a critical submanifold Z with signature (2, 2n), that 
is, such that, in the directions transverse to Z, the action may be linearised as 
t . (x, Yt. ... , Yn) = (t"x, C 91yt. ..• , C9n yn).

2.3 First applications 
If the maximum of H is reached on a surface Bm ,,,,,, nothing prevents us, in the 
previous proof, from following the gradient until the end. 
2.3.1 
If the minimum and the maximum of H are both reached on a surface, we 
get in the very same way a smooth map 
and homeomorphisms

commute. In particular, Bmin and Bm,.., are two copies of the same surface. 
81 
2.3.2 
If one of the extrema is reached at an isolated fixed point, then the other 
one is reached either on a sphere, or at an isolated critical point. 
2.3.3 A consequence of a previous lemma. If the action is semifree (i.e. 
without any exceptional orbit) it has at least four fixed points. 
This result is actually obvious if the minimum is reached on a surface. Suppose it 
is reached at an isolated point. As the action is semifree, it may be written near this 
point: t· (x, y) = (tx, ty). In particular, the Euler class is -1 (it is the Hopf fibration 
see 1-3.2.3). There must be an index 2 critical point, otherwise, with an isolated 
maximum, W would be a sphere S", which would prevent it from being symplectic. 
At the first index 2 critical point, and again because the action is semifree, the 
integers p and q both equal 1. According to lemma 1.2.1, the Euler class is zero, but 
it is then impossible that the maximum is the only critical point left, as there is no 
action of S1 on S3 with a zero Euler class. We have shown more precisely that if 
both extrema are isolated, the action has exactly 4 fixed points (see more generally 
V-3.2.3). 
2.4 What happens when there are only two critical values 
2.4.1 
One possibility is that one is reached at an isolated point, and then the 
other one is reached on a sphere (and not at a point, as S" is still not symplectic). 
Then all the regular levels are S3's, with, when looked at from the isolated critical 
point, an action as (tmx, tRy) ... but on the other side they are principal bundles 
over S2, thus m = n = ±1, and each bundle over S2 is the Hopf one. 
In this case the manifold W is P2(C) and the action that of S1 by t· (x,y) = 
[tx, y, z]. This is a special case of a result due to T. Delzant [31]. 
2.4.2 
The other possibility is that the two critical values are reached on two copies 
of the same surface B. Each regular level is the circle bundle of the normal bundle 
L of Bmin in W. 
The manifold W is obtained by compactifying the vector bundle L, that is by 
adding a section at infinity, Bma.,. 
Look more carefully at this example to be convinced that there actually exists 
a symplectic manifold with a hamiltonian S1-action, and which looks like what we 
have just described. 
In order to add a hyperplane at infinity to a vector space E, the easiest thing 
we can do is to projectify E ffi C. Here we do this in each fiber, which means that

where 1 denotes the trivial complex line bundle over B, and, for any z E B, L" is 
the fiber of L at z. 
The map (z, I) H z defines a projection onto B, which fiber is pI (e), moreover 
there are two inclusions (sections) of Bin P(L EB 1): 
• the "zero section" z H (z,O EB e), 
• and the "section at infinity" z H (z, L" EB 0). 
There is also a natural SI-action on P(L EB 1): 
t . (z, (v, u)) = (z, (tv, u)) 
(in "homogeneous coordinates") which admits both sections v = 0 and u = 0 as 
fixed points submanifolds. We must still construct a symplectic form. There are a 
lot of different possible ways to do this but the one I shall give was suggested to me 
by P. Iglesias (and is analogous to a classical construction we shall meet again in 
V-3.1.1). 
If L is trivialisable, P(L EB 1) S!! B X pI (e) and one can take a product symplectic 
form. Suppose then that L is not trivialisable. Endow it with a hermitian metric, 
which will allow us to consider its unit circle bundle "Ir : S(L) -+ B with the circle 
acting by rotations in the fibers as an Sl-principal bundle. Let e E Z be its Euler 
class. Fix a volume form '1 on the oriented surface B. One can find a unique real 
number'\ such that e = ,\ fB TI, in such a way that ,\ is zero exactly when the bundles 
L and S(L) are trivialisable: we thus assume that ,\ =I- o. 
We shall see in chapter V (exercise 2.4.3) that it is then possible to find an 
invariant I-form a on S(L) such that 
• if X is the fundamental vector field of the Sl-action, ixa == 1. 

Symplectic reduction of the regular levels for a periodic hamiltonian

Consider now Pl(C) with the Sl-action t· [a, bI = [a, tbI and the usual symplectic 
form woo Choose a moment map H for this action and put: 
w = d(Ha) + woo 
This is a closed 2-form on S(L) X pi (C). 
I~ook at the kernel of w. Consider a point (u, v) E S(L) XPI(C), and two tangent 
vectors 
(U, V), (U', V') E TuS(L) X Tl1pl(C). 
Then (U, V) is in the kernel if and only if 
But 
V(U', V'), (d(H a) + wo)«U, V), (U', V'» = o.

Hence (U, V) is in Kerw if and only if

dH(V)a + H(v)iuda = 0 
That is: ivwo = i",(u)xwO calling X the fundamental vector field on PI(C) as 
well, for the first equation, which is equivalent to V = a(U)X; while the second 
equation in (3) gives, as dH(X) = 0, H(v)iuda = o. 
If we were careful enough to have chosen a function H which does not vanish on 
pI (C), the second equation gives iuda = O. 
From the definition of a (where TJ is a volume form, in particular nondegenerate), 
we know that the kernel of da is generated by the vector field X hence U = p.X and 
V = a(U)X = p.X for some real number p.. 
We are thus led to consider the diagonal SI-action on S(L) X PI(C), the funda-

Consider the space one gets by replacing, in C2, the point 0 by the set of all straight 
lines through it.

In other words consider

If v =f 0, 1r-I (v) contains only one point: v defines one line; but if v = 0, there

The space C2 is a complex manifold: it may be described by the algebraic 
equation

It has symplectic forms, induced by those of C' x Pl(C). It is moreover possible 
to construct symplectic forms inducing the standard form of C' outside any given 
disc centered at 0 (more generally see [54]). 
This allows, via Darboux, to blow up any point in any 4-dimensional symplectic 
manifold and to obtain new symplectic manifolds. 
The following exercise gives a way to construct such a symplectic form. 
Exercise 3.1.1 Let WI be the standard form on C2 , W2 that on Pl(C). Consider 
and define, for any r > 0, Or = j*(Wl + rw,). Check that it is a symplectic form on 
C2, which gives volume r to the exceptional divisor.

Here is now, in the spirit of 2.2, an other way to describe the blow-up. Let us 
come back to the situation of exercise 2.2.2 and suppose W = C 3 , Z = 0, n = 2, 
and p = ql = q2 = 1; in other words, we want to study the 8 1-action on C 3 by 
t· (x,y,z) = (tx,ty,tz). 
Choose the hamiltonian H such that H(O) = o.

2. Consider the reduced symplectic form on Bt = H-l(t)/Sl (with t < 0 in such 
a way that Bt = C2). What is the volume of the exceptional divisor? 
When t varies staying < 0, we thus get a one parameter family of copies of C2 
with an exceptional divisor having smaller and smaller volume. .. until it disappears 
for t 20 where C2 becomes a C2. This remark together with the results of exercises 
2.2.2, 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 are particular cases of results to be discussed in V-4. 
3.2 
Extension of an Sl-action 
Consider the circle action near a fixed point, as linearised by Frankel, that is: 
t· (x,y) = (tPx,r9 y) 
for some relatively prime integers p, q to be made precise. Blow up the fixed point 
(0,0) E C2. It is clear that the Sl-action can be extended to (:2 by 
t . «x, y), [a, b)) = «t"x, r
9y), [t"a, r
9b)). 
Remarks: 
• Outside the exceptional divisor (x = y = 0), nothing new happens. 
• In the case where the blown up fixed point lay on a fixed surface, assuming 
that p = 1 et q = 0 (so the hamiltonian action is effective), the strict trans-
form of the fixed points surface x = 0 is a fixed points surface as well (the 
«0, y), [0, 1])). 
We added the new fixed point «0,0), [1, 0]), near which, in local coordinates 
(x, v) (where v = b/a and y = tlx), the action is written 
t· (x,v) = (tx,lv) 
where we see that it is an index 2 fixed point.

• If p > 0 and q > 0, the blown up fixed point is an isolated index 2 critical 
point for H, which we shall call critical point or type (p, q) fixed point. The 
blow-up replaces it with two fixed points: ((0,0), [0,1]) of type (p + q, q) and 
((0,0), [1,0]) of type (p, p + q) (as is easily seen writing the action in standard 
local coordinates) connected by a gradient manifold4 (the exceptional divisor) . 
• If p and q have opposite signs, then the blown up fixed point was an isolated 
extremum of the hamiltonian. Changing signs if necessary, the action may be 
written: 
t. (x,y) = (tmx, tny) 
where m and n are> 0 and relatively prime (the fixed point is a minimum 
with these signs). The action on (;2 is: 
- When m = n = 1, the whole exceptional divisor consists of fixed points; 
we replaced an isolated fixed point with a fixed pl. 
- Otherwise, one may assume that m > n > O. Then the point ((0,0), [0,1]) 
is a minimum, near which the hamiltonian action is written (tm-nu, tny), 
and the point ((0,0), [1,0]) is an isolated index 2 critical point of type 
(n,m-n). 
3.3 Gradient manifolds and exceptional divisors 
The blowing up of an index 2 critical point gives us the following situation: 
• Before blowing up (figure 5) the gradient manifolds are the y-axis, stable 
manifold of the fixed point, the points of which have stabilizer Zlq, and the 
x-axis, unstable manifold of the fixed point, the points of which have stabilizer 
Zip·

• After having blown up (figure 6) we have two critical points, the u-axis (on 
the x side) and the v-axis (on the y side) are the two discs which form the 
exceptional divisor. The latter is actually the gradient manifold connecting 
the two fixed points. 
This is of course a general fact: 
Proposition 3.3.1 The gradient manifolds of H joining an index 2 critical point 
to another index 2 critical point or to a point of a critical surface are all symplectic 
(actually almost complex with tangent space generated by X and JX) smooth spheres

4-manifolds with periodic hamiltonians 
We now have introduced all we need in order to understand the topology of the 
manifolds under consideration: they will be organised (reconstructed) around the 
S2 spheres which are the gradient manifolds. 
4.1 
Description 

4-manifolds with periodic hamiltonians 
89 
4.1.1 
In 2.4, we constructed examples of compact symplectic manifolds endowed 
with periodic hamiltonians: all the P(L Ef) 1) (with two surfaces as the set of fixed 
points), and P2(C) with an isolated fixed point and a fixed sphere. 
On P2(C), there are plenty of other periodic hamiltonians, for example the most 
famous Morse function in the world (because it is investigated at the beginning of 
[14]) is one of them. This is the function 
it is a hamiltonian for the Sl-action 
which is effective as soon as m and n are relatively prime, and which has three fixed 
points when m and n are distinct and nonzero. 
Similarly, when the base space B of the bundle L is a sphere, we may combine 
an Sl-action on B and the action in the fibers to get more complicated actions on 
P(L Ef) 1). Consider the "Hirzebruch surfaces" 
W = {([a, b), [x,y,z]) E pI(C) x p 2(C)\a"y = b"x} 
with the induced symplectic form and the Sl-action 
Exercise 4.1.2 
1. The projection Pl(C) x P2(C) -+ Pl(C) actually makes W a pI (C)-bundle 
on PI(C) (from chapter V (appendix B), it will be clear that W may be called 
P(O(k) Ef) 1». 
2. Show that in general the action just described has four isolated fixed points; 
the case where m = 0 and n = ±1 is a special case of 2.4.2. 
Now that we have got all these examples, which we shall call the basic examples, 
we are able to state the results we want to prove. 
Theorem 4.1.3 Let W be a closed 4-manifold, endowed with an SI-action whose 
fundamental vector field is denoted X and on which there exists a symplectic form 
wand a function H satisfying ixw = dH (in other words such that the action is 
hamiltonian for some symplectic form). Then there exists a finite sequence 
where each Wi is a manifold having the same properties, each 1I'i is the blow-up of a 
fixed point of the SI-action on Wi-I, and Wo is one of the basic examples. 

90 
4-manifolds 
From the method of the proof, one can also derive the two following amusing 
results: 
Theorem 4.1.4 Any (oriented) Seifert manifold (with oriented basis) is a level of 
some periodic hamiltonian on a compact 4-dimensional symplectic manifold. 
Theorem 4.1.5 Let W be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 4 endowed 
with a hamiltonian SI-action. Then there exists a hamiltonian T2-action extending 
the given action (for some way of embedding SI as a subgroup in T2) if and only if 
both following conditions hold: 
1. one of the regular levels has a sphere S2 as symplectic reduction 
2. no level of H meets more than two gradient manifolds. 
The T2-action is then unique. 
Remark. Both conditions are necessary as soon as the image of W under the mo-
ment map of the T2-action is a convex polyhedron (see 111-4.2.1). 
In the sequel ofthis chapter, 1 shall prove theorems 4.1.3 and 4.1.5 in the special 
case where the SI-action has two surfaces of fixed points, and theorem 4.1.4. With 
a little care, the very same method makes possible to prove the results in complete 
generality, as the reader may convince herself or himself by looking at [21]. 
The fundamental construction is that of plumbing. 
5 
Plumbing 
The submanifolds on which the extrema are reached, and the gradient manifolds 
as well, are (almost complex) surfaces with normal bundles which describe their 
neighborhoods in W. Plumbing was created precisely to handle this kind of situation 
(see for example [59,42]). 
5.1 
Plumbing of disc bundles 
Let El -+ Bl and E2 -+ B2 be the disc bundles of two complex line bundles on 
surfaces. Choose two discs Dl and D2 resp. in Bl and B2. We know that the 
bundles El and E2 are trivialisable, over Dl (resp. D2) as well as over Bl - Dl 
(resp. B2 - D2). Choose trivialisations 
EIIDJ

9! B2 X B2 
E21D2 
9! D2 X B2 
9! B2 X B2 
using which it is possible to glue ... inverting factors. 
There is a small problem in defining the structure of a smooth manifold on the 
space we get this way: one has to smooth corners, but this is not very difficult (see 
[42)). 

Plumbing 
91 
Figure 7 
We thus get an almost complex 4-manifold with boundary, which contains the 
two surfaces Bl and B 2, with normal bundles El and E 2 , the diffeomorphism type 
of which is well defined by that of Bt, B2 and by the bundles. 
Nothing prevents us from iterating, even reiterating the processus. For example, 
any graph defines a manifold said to be plumbed along the graph: the vertices 
correspond to the bundles to be plumbed and one has to plumb two such bundles 
when there is an edge connecting the two corresponding vertices. 
5.2 
Equivariant plumbing along star-shaped graphs 
When the graph has the shape of a star, it is possible to endow the manifold plumbed 
along it with an Sl-action. 
5.2.1 Sl-action on pieces. H the basis B of the disc bundle E is not a sphere, 
endow it with the trivial Sl-action, then the circle acts by rotation in each fiber of 
E. 
Otherwise, if B is an S2, write 
where 
S! = {z E Clizi ~ 1}, 
S~ = {z E C u oollzl ~ I} ~ {z E Clizi ~ I} 
and 
with 

92 
4-manifolds 
where SI = S! n S~ and f.('z E SO(2) for all z. The isomorphism class of the bundle 
is well defined by the homotopy class of 
Z 
H 
f.('z 
SI -t SO(2) 
which we may assume to have the form f.('z(u) = zku for some integer k. The bundle 
obtained this way will be denoted E(k). 
Exercise 5.2.2 Define in an analogous way a bundle E(k) on any surface B. The 
boundary is endowed with a principal SI-action (rotation in the fibers) the quotient 
space of which is B. Show that the Euler class ofthis action (in the sense5 of chapter 
I) is k. 
Let SI act on each piece by 
t . (z, u) = (tm! z, t"!u) 
on S! x B2 and by 
on S~ x B2. 
Both actions must agree via the gluing map f.(', that is: m2 = -ml and n2 = 
-kml + nl. 
In conclusion: 
1. The bundle E(k) is defined by the gluing map f.(' : SI X SI -t SI X St, the 
matrix of which (on '11'1) is: 
( -1 0) 
f.('* = 
-k 1 
2. If the SI-action is given, on the S! side by the integers (mb nl), it will be

5.2.3 Weighted star-shaped graphs. We shall actually describe stars as if they 
were comets; this might be silly from the astronomical viewpoint, but it will never-
theless be very convenient (figure 8). 
1. The head of the comet represents a bundle E( -b) over a genus 9 surface B. 
2. The other vertices represent bundles E( -bi,i) over spheres. 
5We shall meet other versions of Euler classes in the next chapter.

3. If two vertices are connected by an edge, we plumb the corresponding bundles. 
The weighted graph r = (glb, (bl ,1I' •• , bl"I),' .. , (br,I," • , br, •• }) thus describes 
an almost complex manifold with boundary W(r). It is endowed with an Bl-action 
which is perfectly well defined once we prescribe it to be trivial on the surface 
associated to the head, and to be the complex multiplication in the fibers of the 
corresponding bundle: it is determined on all pieces by the above method. 
The boundary aW(r) is thus endowed with a fixed point free Bl-action, in other 
words it is a Seifert manifold, and we shall begin with its identification: 
Theorem 5.2.4 Ifr = (glb,(bl ,1I ••• ,bl "I), ... ,(br ,I, ••• ,br , •• » and if all the re-

have a non-zero rational value, then 
Remarks. 
1. The invariants so obtained are not necessarily normalised. 
2. The determination of {3 in terms of band bi,i is left as an exercise. 
3. A good general reference on continued fractions is the book by Hardy and 
Wright [40]. The fact that we have signs does not make things very different. 
If we require that all bi'S are ~ 2, any rational number ~ > 1 can be written 
[bt , ••• , b.l as one can easily show using a slight modification of the usual 
Euclidean algorithm. The reduced fractions we get here are nonincreasing, 
and with self-evident notations (I hope), we have 
NnDn+t - Nn+tDn = 1 
for any n, which one is allowed to find more convenient than the analogous 
relation for continued fractions with "plus" signs.

The proof of the theorem will use the following lemma: 
Lemma 5.2.5 Ifr = (bt, ... , 6.), then the manifold oW(r) is the lens space L(p, q) 
where p/q = [6l) ... , b.]. 
Remark. This is an assertion about the manifold oW(r) and not about any 8 1-
action. 
Proof. We must glue the bundles E( -b1), ... , E( -b.). One checks by an easy 
induction on's that this is the same as gluing the two solid tori 81+ X 81 (where 
81+ is the first hemisphere in the first sphere 81) and 8._ X 81 by the map

We know, as the action is trivial at the "head", that we have to glue the lens 
space L(p,q) with the trivial action in the fibers over 81+: the action on 81+ x B2 
is 
t· (a,z) = (ta,z). 
At the end of this branch, we know that the 8 1-action is

The exceptional orbit is the central (a = 0) one, the order of its stabilizer is n~ = 
N. = p. To get the Seifert invariants (p, (3) it is enough, up to normalisation, to 
find some (3 such that m~(3 = +1 mod n~. But m~ = -N.-1 = -u, we thus have 
to solve -u(3 = 1 mod p. As we have pu - qv = 1, (3 = p - q works. 0

5.3 Periodic hamiltonians and plumbing 
Proposition 5.3.1 If the minimum of H is attained on a surface and if a is a 
regular level, then W" is obtained by plumbing along a star-shaped graph. 
The "head" of the comet represents the minimum surface, it is weighted by 
the Euler class of its normal bundle; the other surfaces plumbed are the gradient 
manifolds (spheres S2), the edges thus corresponding to the index 2 critical points. 
o 
5.3.2 Relations between the weights of the fixed points and those of the 
plumbing. Consider a branch of the graph, with vertices weighted by (bt, ... , b.). 
The edge connecting the two vertices weighted bi and biH corresponds to a type 
(p,q) fixed point. Thus, from the proof of lemma 1.2.1 and from theorem 5.2.4, we 
know that 
[bt, ... , bil 
= 
..!L-
[bt, ... ,bi+ll = 
q-v 
..L 
I'-u 
where pv-qu = 1, (q,v) are the Seifert invariants ofthe levels just before the critical 
point and (p, u) those just after. 
To simplify put v' = q - v, u' = p - u, hence qu' - pv' = 1. If we subtract this 
relation from 
Ni_tV' - qDi - t = 1 
we see that biH = P+~i-l (= U'+~i_l) 
5.3.3 Specific properties of the weights in these graphs. 
• a priori, branches have weights in Z. As here all the regular levels are Seifert 
manifolds, all the reduced fractions of the continued fraction associated with 
any branch are in Q - O. 
It follows for instance that we never have two consecutive 1 's nor a sequence 
2,1,2, etc ... 
• The weights on the branches are nonnegative: this is easily seen by induction 
looking at the construction of biH above. 
5.4 
Description of W up to the maximum: finishing graphs 
Consider now a regular level a very close to the maximum (in the sense that there 
is no critical value of H between a and the maximum). If we assume that the 
maximum is reached on the surface, say B, we know that Va is a principal bundle 
over B (2.1). In other words, there is no exceptional orbit in Va and W" is obtained 
by plumbing along a weighted graph 
r = (g\b, ... , (bi,1I'''' bi,.;), ... 1 :5 i :5 r) 

Plumbing 
where 
1 
[b •• t. ... , b ••• ;] = ,. 
is the inverse of some integer for all i. 
97 
We say that such a weighted graph r is finishing. One derives, from the associ-
ated plumbed manifold, a closed 4-manifold by simply gluing the disc bundle of a 
complex line bundle over B (the one with Euler class b - Ef3. as one may check). 
Example. If r = (glb), W" is a disc bundle of the line bundle with Euler class -b 
on the genus 9 surface B. Glue a disc bundle of the line bundle with Euler class b 
to get the manifold P(L EEl 1) (with e(L) = ±b). 
Proof of theorem 4.1.3. 
Let us begin with the investigation of the relationship 
between plumbing and blowing up. We saw that to blow up a type (t"x, t-qy) fixed 
point was to replace it with two fixed points, of types (tp+qx, t-qy) and (tPx, r(p+q)y). 
The effect on the continued fraction is

Contract in the graph all the vertices which are weighted by 1. By the remarks 
in 5.3.3, after a finite number of such operations, all branches will be weighted by 
integers ~ 2 ... or will have disappeared. Now the following exercise is easy 
Exercise 5.4.1 b1, ••• , bn ~ 2 *> [b1, ••• , bnl > 1. 
Thus, the branches which are weighted by integers ~ 2 can only give inverses of 
integers, and so all branches disappear ... that is to say that the graph obtained by 
contraction represents a manifold (glb) and that the manifold W is obtained from 
it by blowing up points. 0 
This proof is in some sense algorithmic. The algorithm is especially obvious in 
the semifree case, in which there are no levels containing exceptional orbits. Thus: 
Vi,; [b ....... , b •• i ] = _1_ 
/'.i 
It is easy to solve the equation "[b ..... , bj ] inverse of an integer for all j": one finds 
of course first that b1 = 1, then

4-manifolds 
thus any branch can be contracted to give a branch having the same weights, but 
being shorter, in other words, all blow-ups are done at points of the minimum: 
Theorem 5.4.2 In the case of a semi free action, each 'lfi is the blow-up at some 
points of the surface on which the minimum is reached in Wi-I. 
o 
Using these methods, it is not harder to deduce a proof of theorem 4.1.4: 
Proof. We write the Seifert invariants as a continued fraction as theorem 5.2.4 al-
lows us to do and we express all these manifolds as boundaries of manifolds plumbed 
along graphs which are weighted by integers which we may even assume to be ~ 2. 
The only thing we must check is that such a graph may be extended as a finishing 
graph. This verification is done in each branch. From the arithmetical viewpoint, 
we have to show: 
for some integer a. 
Thus fix an integer a ~ 1 and write:

Developping u/v as a continued fraction [b,.+), •. . , b,.+m] is then sufficient to give a 
solution. 0 
We still have to prove theorem 4.1.5, but we shall only do it here in the case 
where the extrema are reached along surfaces, for then it can be written: 
Proposition 5.4.3 Let 
r = (g I b, (b1,1,'''' b1,.),···, (br,l,"" b1,.)) 
a finishing graph. The compact symplectic manifold W(r} may be given a hamilto-
nian T2-action extending the SI-action if and only if g = 0 and r ~ 2. 

Appendix: compact symplectic SU(2)-manifolds of dimension 4 
99 
Proof. Let us first prove that the condition is sufficient. If the number r of branches 
ofr is 0, W is some P(LEDI) -+ Pl(C) and it is easy to extend the given hamiltonian 
action. Otherwise we saw that W is the result of a sequence of blow-ups beginning 
with some P(L ED 1) (4.1.3). As the star has at most two branches, we began by 
blowing up (at most) two points in Bmin ••• but the latter is a Pl(C) with the 
standard action: there are actually two fixed points (for T2) which we may blow up 
in such a way that the action may be extended. We can then proceed. Note that 
the SI-action determines the T2-action. 0 
As regular levels for a hamiltonian in this situation, we thus find all oriented 
Seifert manifolds with basis S2 and at most two exceptional orbits. It is well known 
(see [59]) that these are exactly the lens spaces. 
Corollary 5.4.4 A 3-manifold is a regular level of a periodic hamiltonian induced 
by a hamiltonian T2-action on a compact symplectic 4-manifold if and only if it is 
a lens space. 0 
Remark. The SI-manifolds which are plumbed along the finishing graphs we con-
sider do have invariant symplectic forms, as they are obtained by blowing up sym-
plectic manifolds. Thus, theorem 4.1.3 is actually a classification theorem for the 
SI-equivariant diffeomorphism type of compact 4-manifolds having invariant sym-
plectic forms (with hamiltonian) ... but it is not a classification theorem for compact 
symplectic manifolds etc. .. as we did not take care of the invariant symplectic forms 
on these manifolds. 
A 
Appendix: compact symplectic SU(2)-manifolds of dimension 4 
In this appendix, we shall give a classification of the compact symplectic 4-manifolds 
with an action of SU(2). It is, in essence, due to P. Iglesias [43] who actually 
considerd SO(3) but the SU(2) case is a little easier and a little less technical, that 
is why we chose it (and decided to present it with a lot of exercises). As in the SI 
case, we shall not worry about of the symplectic forms, but we shall concentrate 
instead on the manifolds with action. 
We consider SU(2) as the group of matrices 
SU(2) = { (: ~fi) IIxl2 + lyl2 = I} 
from which description it is easy to recognise that SU(2) is S3. 
A.I 
A list of examples 
A.I.I SU(2)-actions on complex line bundles over Pl(C). Consider E(m) = 
S3 XSl C where SI acts on S3 x C by 
t . «x, y), u) = «tx, ty), tmu). 

100 
4-manifolds 
This is a complex line bundle over P1(C) by the projection 
[(x, y), u]1---+ [x, y]. 
Exercise A.I.2 Show that the bundle E(m) is actually the same we defined in 
5.2.1 (in particular, its Euler class is m, see V-B). 
The group SU(2) acts in a natural way on S3 x C with the help of its linear 
action on C2 by 
g. «x,y),u) = (g. (x,y),u). 
Exercise A.I.3 Show that 
1. this action descends to quotient, thus defining an SU(2)-action on E(m), 
2. the type of the points in the zero section is Sl, that of the other points is Z/m, 
3. the action is effective if and only if m is odd. If m is even, it defines an effective 
SO(3)-action. 
A.1.4 Compactification. We compactify the fibers of E(m) and get P(E(m)$I) 
(see 2.4.2). 
Exercise A.1.5 Make Sl act on S3 x P1(C) by 
t· «x,y), [u, v]) = «tx, ty), [tmu, v]). 
1. Show that the quotient may be identified with P(E(m) $ I). 
2. Endow P(E(m)$I) with an SU(2)-action extending the one defined on E(m) 
above. Describe its orbit types. 
3. Imitating the construction in 2.4.2, construct an SU(2)-invariant symplectic 
form on P(E(m) $ I). 
For any odd m, we thus have an effective action on P(E(m)$I) and an invariant 
symplectic form. Actually the diffeomorphism type of P(E(m) $ 1) depends only 
on m being odd or even (the action really depends on Iml as those who solved the 
exercises know: it is the order of the principal stablizer). The diffeomorphism type 
is rather simple: 

Appendix: compact symplectic 5U(2)-manifolds of dimension 4 
101 
Exercise A.1.6 
1. Show that the algebraic submanifold (Hirzebruch surface, see 4.1.1) 
may be identified with P(E(m) EB 1). Deduce, for example, that P(E(l) EB 1) 
is P2(C) blown up at one point. 
2. In the local chart b t- 0 in pi (C), put u = alb (e C) and J(t) = t+!-m. Show 
that 
<p: C X Pl(C) -+ 
Xm 
(u,[v,w)) 
1-+ ([u,l],[J(luDumv,J(luDv,w]) 
defines a trivialisation of Xm _ pi (C) in this local chart. Similarly write a 
trivialisation t/J in "the other" local chart (a t- 0), in such a way that 
t/J-l 0 <pC u, [v, w]) = (u, [Iu~:m v, w]) . 
Thus Xm is obtained by gluing two copies of D2 x Pl(C) by 
g: Sl x Pl(C) 
(z, [v, w]) 
-+ Sl X Pl(C) 
1-+ (z, [zmv, w]). 
3. Show that z 1-+ ([v, w]1-+ [zmv, w]) defines a loop in SO(3), homotopic to the 
constant loop when m is odd. 
4. Applying the result to m - n, show that Xm is diffeomorphic to Xn if m == 
n mod 2. Deduce that the manifold P( E( m) EB 1) is diffeomorphic to 52 x 52 
when m is even and to P2(C) blown up at one point when m is odd. 
In addition to this list, we are able to make SU(2) act linearly on P2(C), as 
a subgroup of U(3). We shall now prove that (up to a small hypothesis), the list 
exhausts all symplectic SU(2)-actions on compact symplectic 4-manifolds. 
A.2 
Classification 
Suppose thus that W is compact, symplectic, 4-dimensional, and endowed with 
a symplectic and effective SU(2)-action. The latter is hamiltonian, SU(2) being 
,semisimple (see II-3.2.6), hence we have a moment map 
p : W -+ Gu(2)* 
which we assume to be submersive at at least one point in W. 

102 
4-manifolds 
A.2.1 Orbit types. From 11-3.4.7, we know that the principal stabilizer is both 
discrete and a subgroup of the maximal torus 
Hence it is a cyclic group Z/m. Principal orbits have dimension 3. 
Exercise A.2.2 
1. Show that I' is submersive at any point of an exceptional orbit and that the 
image of any dimension 3 orbit both has dimension 2 and is contained in a 
coadjoint orbit in .6u(2)*. 
2. Deduce that the stabilizer of any dimension 3 orbit is a Z/q. Using the slice 
theorem, deduce that q = m and that there is no exceptional orbit. 
Let us now investigate the singular orbits. 
Exercise A.2.3 Considering a subgroup 8 1 of 8U(2), show that, as W is compact, 
there always exist singular orbits. 
As there is no dimension 2 closed subgroup in 8U(2), singular orbits must have 
dimension 0 or 2, and stabilizer 8U(2), 81 or 0(2). 
Exercise A.2.4 If the stabilizer of a point x contains a circle as a proper subgroup, 
then p(x) = o. 
Now, we show that 0(2) cannot appear as a stabilizer, and more generally that 
there is no dimension 2 orbit sent to 0 by 1" 
Consider a dimension 2 orbit. Its stabilizer is a subgroup of 8U(2), has dimension 
1 and contains a circle. According to the slice theorem, a neighborhood of such an 
orbit has the form: 
8U(2) XSO(2) R2 
where 80(2) acts linearly on R2. As we noticed above when looking at examples, 
for the action to be effective on W, it is necessary that 80(2) acts on R2 by v 1-+ tmv 
with m odd. 
Suppose now that the orbit under consideration is sent to O. In particular, Tel' 
vanishes on the tangent space to the orbit and 
T.,(8U(2)· x) C KerT.,p = {T",(8U(2)· x)}O 
for this reason the orbit is isotropic (in fact lagrangian: its dimension is half that 
of W). In particular, according to 11-1.3.4, it has a tubular neighborhood of the 
form T*82 (up to a covering map). The next exercise might be easier after reading 
chapter V: 

Appendix: compact symplectic SU(2)-manifolds of dimension 4 
103 
Exercise A.2.5 The bundle T*S2 -+ S2 cannot be written S3 XSI R2 with SI 
acting on R2 with an odd weight m (m is actually the Euler class of the bundle over 
S2 and that of T*S2 is ±2). 
Thus, there is no lagrangian orbit. 
Remark. On the contrary, this situation does occur in the SO(3) case. For example 
if SO(3) acts as a subgroup (the real part) of SU(3) C U(3) on P2(C), the real 
part P2(R) is a lagrangian orbit (43]. It is this small difference which makes the 
investigation of SU(2)-actions a little easier than that of SO(3)-actions. 
In short: 
Proposition A.2.6 Let W be a compact symplectic 4-manilold endowed with an 
effective symplectic action 01 SU(2). Let I' : W -+ au(2)* be the moment map 01 
this action. Suppose that I' is submersive at least at one point. Then: 
1. the principal stabilizer is a Z/m and there are no exceptional orbits, 
2. ill'(x) = 0 then x is an isolated fixed point, 
3. there must be singular orbits, which are either isolated points, or symplectic 
spheres S2 (with stabilizer SI). 
The only thing left to check is that the dimension 2 orbits are actually symplectic. 
The image by I' of such an orbit is the sphere containing I'(x) (its coadjoint orbit), 
and T ",I' is injective when restricted to the orbit. Thus I'IOrbit is a diffeomorphism, 
and we know that it must be symplectic (see 11-3.4). 0 
A.2.7 Classification. Remark now: 
Lemma A.2.8 1= t 111'112 : W -+ [0, +oo[ is a quotient map jor the SU(2)-action 
on W. 
Proof. We know, thanks to the slice theorem and to the study of stabilizers above 
that the quotient will be a dimension 1 manifold with boundary, the ends corre-
sponding to the singular orbits. It is thus a compact interval if we assume W to be 
connected and there are exactly two singular orbits. 
The function j descends to the quotient as 
g: W/SU(2) --+ [O,+oo[ 
a smooth function from one interval to another. Computing its derivative: 
T",j(Y) = I'(x). T",I'(Y)' 
If x is a fixed point with I'(x) =J. 0, then 
Y E KerT",j # T",I'(Y) E I'(x)l. = TI'{",)S2 
where S2 is the coadjoint orbit of I'(x). Hence T ",I vanishes exactly when x is on 
a singular orbit, and g is strictly monotone, which shows that I may be identified 
with the quotient map. 0

4-rnanifolds 
Let [a,b] = feW) and let c e]a,b[. Then f-1(b) is a symplectic sphere 8 2, 
f- 1([c, b]) is a tubular neighborhood of this sphere, given by the slice theorem and 
so it is an E(m) (lml, odd, being the order of the principal stabilizer). There are 
only two possibilities 
• Either a > 0, then f- 1([a,c}) is an E(n) as well, necessarily Iml = Inl and 
actually m = -n in order to be able to glue, so that W is a P(E(m) $1) . 
• Or a = 0, then f-1(a) is an isolated fixed point near which the 8U(2)-action 
is the usual one on C2. In particular, Iml = 1 and W is obtained by gluing a 
disc to E(±1) so that W is a copy of P2(C).

Appendix: 4-dimensional 8 1-manifolds with no invariant symplectic 
form (examples) 
There are a lot of 4-manifolds with 8 1-action which do not fit into the framework 
considered in the present chapter; to be convinced of this, the reader just need have 
a look at the "list" of 8 1-manifolds of dimension 4 given by Fintushel [35]. 
In this appendix, I shall use the very same methods as in the rest of the chapter 
(in particular plumbing) to construct some of these examples. The manifolds con-
structed will be compact, oriented, and endowed with 8 1-actions with as manifold 
of fixed points: some isolated points, possibly a sphere 8 2 on the one hand and a 
connected oriented genus 2:: 1 surface on the other hand. It is certain that no 8 1_ 
manifold with these properties can have an invariant symplectic form: having fixed 
points, the action would be hamiltonian (because of 1.1.1), the hamiltonian would 
have as extrema an isolated point or a sphere 8 2 and a genus 2:: 1 surface, but this 
is forbidden by 2.3.2. 
B.1 
Equivariant plumbing on non-simply connected graphs, examples 
Nothing obliges us to use only star-shaped graphs to construct 4-manifolds with 
boundary. Actually, it is obvious that the existence of cycles in the graph will make 
it more difficult to construct 8 1-actions. 
B.1.1 Examples with polygonal graphs. We shall only consider here the case 
where all plumbed surfaces are spheres (the reader will easily generalise these ex-
amples following her or his taste). Assume that, over the hemisphere 81+, and with 
the notations of 5.2.1, the action is given by 
t. (z,a) = (tm1z,tn1a) 
and that over 8._ it is given by 
t· (z,a) = (tm~a,tn~z) 
where

In particular, B. must have 1 as eigenvalue (in other words, this element of 
SL(2, Z) is parabolic). 
Reciprocally, let B = (: ~) be a parabolic matrix (a, b, c, d E Z, ad - be = 1, 
and a + d = 2). We can always find integers s, bl> ... , b. such that [bt, ... , b.-ll = 
( -c) / ( -d) and [bl , ••• ,b.l = a / b: look first for a development as a continued fraction 
of (-c)/( -d) and extend it by b. = "+~'-2 = b+~'-2 (no hypothesis is made on the 
integers bi ). We then have 
Let ( ~ ) be a non-zero vector, fixed by B, and suppose m and n are relatively 
prime. The manifold which we get by plumbing along the graph in figure 11 may 
be endowed with an (effective) Sl-action, determined by m and n on the sphere 
number 1. 
Remark. If B. = ±Id, there are enough fixed vectors to define a T2-action.

• The case where 8 = 1. The method works for 8 = 1 as soon as the matrix 
(~11 ~) is parabolic, that is if bl = 2. The central sphere in the strip has 
a double point in the plumbed manifold (in figure 12, is shown a real picture 
of the plumbing and the central sphere with its double point as well). 
• The case where 8 = 2. The trace of B2 is bl ~ - 2 and we then have to solve 
bI b2 = 4. Up to a change in the numbering, we find ht = b2 = ±2 and also 
b1 = ±4 and ~ = ±1.

is parabolic, with fixed vector ( ~ ). We see that for m = 1 the plumbed 
manifold even has a T2-action, but this is not very surprising, as the plumbed 
manifold may then be identified to a neighborhood of the union of the three 
coordinate lines x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0 in P2(C): the tubular neighborhood 
of any projective line in P2(C) is an E(I) (exercise) . 
• The case where s = 4. We find analogously that all quadrilaterals weighted 
by (0, a, 0, b) are solutions as the matrix 
is parabolic, with fixed vector ( ~ ). If b = -a, there is again a T2-action 
and notice that the plumbed manifold can be identified with a neighborhood 
of the union of two fibers and of the two sections in P(E(a) EB 1) -+ pI (C), 
thus the T2-action. These two remarks about torus actions will be made more 
precise in chapter VI.

• We may of course blow up points, for example the triangle (-m, -1, -1) gives 
a quadrilateral (-m, 0,1,0) once we blow up the point corresponding to the 
edge connecting the two -1 vertices (see figure 13). 
B.1.2 Fixed surfaces. Consider a polygonal weighted graph (bt, ... , b.) defining 
a parabolic matrix, and the effective Sl-action on the plumbed manifold associated 
with the choice of a primitive fixed vector. 

108 
4-manifolds 
Fixed sudaces may only appear as cores of certain plumbed strips. Suppose that 
such a fixed sphere actually exists. Up to a shift (mod s) in the numbering of the 
bj's, we may assume that it is the sphere number 1. 
There the action is written (t:l:1X,Y)i in particular, in this notation, the vector 
( ~ ) is fixed by H., which must be of the form (~ ;) for some a E Z (this is 
the case for all triangles and quadrilaterals studied above). 
B.I.3 The boundary. The boundaries of the 8 1-manifolds of dimension 4 we 
obtained are endowed with a fixed point free 8 1-action. In contrast to what could 
happen at a free end of the graph in 5.2, there cannot exist any exceptional orbit. 
The boundary is thus a 3-manifold with a principal 8 1-action. Let us now determine 
this manifold. 
First, the quotient is a torus T2. 
Exercise B.I.4 If m and n are relatively prime, the map 
D2 x 81 
---+ 
D2 
(a,z) 
t--+ anz-m 
is the quotient map for the 8 1-action: t· (a,z) = (tma,ynz). 
Begin now to plumb along the linear graph (bl!" ., b.) as in 5.2.5. We saw there 
that we were gluing 81+ x 81 and 8._ X 81 using the map V' defined by the matrix 
A.. If the circle acts on 81+ x 81 by t . (a, u) = (tmt a, tnt u) and on 8._ x 81 by 
t . (b, v) = (tm~b, tn~v) we know that

thus, forming the quotient as the preceding exercise allows, we see that the manifold 
we obtain (lens space) is fibered over D2 U,p D2 where precisely t/J(z) = z. The 
quotient is indeed a sphere 8 2 • 
We still must plumb the bundles numbered 1 and s using small discs in 81+ and 
8._ (figure 14). Passing to the quotient, we shall have to glue the boundaries of the 
small discs which are the images in the sphere: the quotient is a torus. 
We still have to compute the Euler class of the bundle under consideration. 
Proposition B.I.S Let (ell e2) be an integral basis of Z2 such that el = ( : ) 
is the integral vector fixed by H. which defines the 8 1-action we are dealing with. 
In this basis, the matrix H. is written (~ ~) and the integer e so defined is the 
Euler class of the bundle.

Remark. The absolute value lei depends only on B.: the form (~ ~) is the 
Jordan form of B •. The sign of e, on the other hand, is determined by the choice of 
the eigenvector el, that is the way the Sl-action makes the fiber turn. It is the case 
for the sign of the Euler class as well.

To obtain the whole bundle we still have to glue, using .,p, or in other words using 
the matrix B •. .. which in these coordinates (b, v) is in Jordan form.

The bundle is hence isomorphic to

We must now be convinced that this way of constructing the bundle by gluing 
actually gives the Euler class. This is the content of the following lemma, the proof 
of which we shall postpone until the next chapter (V-B). 0 
Lemma B.1.6 Let V --+ T2 be a principal S·-bundle. Then V is isomorphic to the 
bundle defined by the gluing data 
[0,1] X S· X S·/(O,b,v) '" (O,b,b'v) 
where the integer e denotes the Euler class. 
B.1.7 Compactification. The boundary of the manifolds we are considering be-
ing principal S·-bundles over the torus T2, it is easy to complete them to get closed 
manifolds: glue the total space of the disc bundle E( -e) --+ T2, thus getting an 
oriented compact manifold of dimension 4, endowed with an S·-action with fixed 
points. These are the points of the torus T2 we have just added, isolated fixed points 
and possibly fixed spheres S2 coming from the cores of the strips we plumbed: the 
Sl-manifolds we get have no invariant symplectic [arm. 
Call U the result of plumbing, V the disc bundle which we glued to it, oV the 
principal Sl-bundle which is their common boundary and W the resulting closed 
manifold. 
Exercise B.1.8 
1. Show that 7rl(U) ~ Z, that 7rl(OV) ~ 7rl(V) is onto and that the generator 
of KertfJ vanishes in 7r.(U). Using van Kampen's theorem, deduce that the 
natural map 7rl(U) --+ 7r.(W) is an isomorphism and in particular that the 
first Betti number b1 (W) equals 1. 
2. Show that dimH2(U) = s (the number of bundles we used for plumbing). 
Using the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence, deduce that b2(W) = s. 
Remark. In the case where oV --+ T2 is the trivial bundle (i.e. e = ° 
and the 
plumbed manifold actually has a T2-action) there may be other ways to glue the 
bundle T2 X D2. For example, for a plumbing !llong the triangle (-1, -1, -1) it is 
possible to glue T2 X D2 in such a way that we get P2(C) with an Sl-action without 
fixed point on the piece we added. The results of the previous exercise show just how 
much the manifold we get here is different (for P2(C) we have b1 = ° 
and ~ = 1). 
A systematic construction of this kind of examples will be discussed in chapter VI. 

Appendix: 4-manifolds with no invariant symplectic form

B.1.9 Parabolic Inoue surfaces. We investigate here the case where the polygon 
is weighted by 2 (all the bundles have Euler class -2). The matrix B. is, as we have 
already seen 
( S+l 
S ) (IS) 
-s -( s - 1) 
"-J 
0 1 
and so the bundle we glue has Euler class -s. The Sl-action has s isolated fixed 
points and a fixed surface (the torus T2). 
There exists an analytic complex surface, endowed with a C*-action with these 
properties. The spheres we used to plumb constitute a cycle of rational curves, and 
the t.orus T2 is an elliptic curve. This surface (parabolic Inoue surface) has remark-
able properties, but has no nonconstant meromorphic functions (see for example [53] 
and [58]). For instance, it has no symplectic form defining the orientation we con-
sider (a fortiori calibrating the complex structure). In fact the intersection pairing 
is negative definite (the proof of this fact is easy and thus left as an exercise). 
B.2 
Generalisations 
Consider now a weighted connected graph, and let 9 be the dimension of its HI. 
Assume the weights are such that one can define an Sl-action on the plumbed 
manifold: for example, any vertex which is the end of three or more edges must 
correspond to a fixed sphere, and it determines the operation (if any) on the cycles 
containing this vertex. The matrix associated with each of the cycles as above must 
have the form (~ ;) . 
If the graph has no free (i. e. which is the origin of a unique edge) vertex, the 
action is principal on the boundary, and the quotient is a genus 9 surface, which 
allows us to compactify as above to obtain a lot of Sl-manifolds of dimension 4 with 
no invariant symplectic form. 

Chapter V 
Equivariant cohomology and the 
Duistermaat-Heckman theorems 
Another group of famous and spectacular theorems in the theory of hamiltonian 
torus actions is due to Duistermaat and Heckman1[34]. The two theorems in their 
paper assert once again the importance of linear phenomena in the theory. 
In the first theorem (here 3.2.2), the authors consider the reduced symplectic 
forms we and WT/ on the quotients of two regular levels 1'-1(0 and 1'-1(71) which 
correspond to values e and 71 located in the same component of the set of regular 
values of the moment map 1'. One may then identify the quotients Be and BT/ and 
consider the difference fwd - [WT/] E H2(Be). The theorem asserts that it is a linear 
function of e - 71. 
The other statement (here 6.1.1) is usually shortened to: a periodic hamiltonian 
satisfies the exact stationary phase formula. 
It was N. Berline and M. Vergne (22) who first explained that this statement is a 
special case of a "localisation theorem" in equivariant cohomology. This was a very 
good idea: actually the language of equivariant cohomology fits very well with the 
investigation of hamiltonian actions, as one might be readily convinced by looking 
at 3.1.1. 
Later came two "survey" papers on the subject, one by Atiyah and Bott [20] in 
1984 and one by Ginsburg [37] in 1987. From these come the methods and results 
I shall discuss in the present chapter. 
As I have already said, the language of equivariant cohomology fits so well here 
that we shall see that the first of the Duistermaat-Heckman theorems becomes prac-
tically tautological (this will not detract from its beauty) ... Of course we will have 
to pay for this, namely we will have to define equivariant cohomology, the Borel 
11 just learn (december 1990) from A. Weinstein that similar results were proved by Karasev 
[45] in 1981.

construction and classifying spaces. .. Thus we shall begin by recalling the classical 
results and constructions of Milnor and Dold, recommending the reader to consult 
these authors and Husemoller's book [15] for details.

Principal and universal bundles 
1.1 Principal bundles 
A principal G-bundle is a space E endowed with a free G-action such that the orbit 
map E -+ B is a locally trivial fibration. 
When the slice theorem is true, the last condition is automatically satisfied. We 
shall only consider compact groups here, but we cannot restrict to the case where E 
and B are manifolds, mainly because we shall need some infinite dimensionalspaces. 
Examples. 
1. In chapter I, we investigated principal Sl-bundles ove~ Sl and over surfaces. 
2. Of course S2n+! -+ pn(c) is a principal Sl-bundle as well. 
3. Consider now slightly more complicated groups and to this end look at the 
complex Stiefel manifold V,,(CnH) of unitary k-frames in Cn+". The unitary 
group U(k) acts naturally on V,,(CnH), it is a free action and the quotient is 
the complex Grassmann manifold G,,(CnH) of all k-dimensional vector sub-
spaces in CnH. The projection 
It,,(CnH) -+ G,,(CnH) 
is a principal U(k)-bundle (for k = 1, it is S2n+l -+ pn(c». 
4. If the group G is discrete, a principal G-bundle is a Galois covering. 
The notion of isomorphism of principal G-bundles is clear. 
I shall very often take the liberty of denoting with the same letter the bundle 
and its total space. 
1.2 
Universal bundles 
1.2.1 
We shall consider numerable coverings, that is locally finite coverings (Ui)iel 
such that there exists a partition of unity (Ui)iel with: 
Ui l(]O, 1]) CUi, Vi E I 
Example. If B is paracompact, it has a numerable covering. 
A principal bundle over B is said to be numerable if there exists a numerable 
covering of B which makes it locally trivial. 

Principal and universal bundles 
115 
1.2.2 Induced bundles. H p : E -+ B is a principal G-bundle, and I : B' -+ B 
a continuous map, 
rE = ((e,b')lp(e) = I(b')} 
is a principal G-bundle as well, and one shows2 without too much difficulty: 
Theorem 1.2.3 II II: B' -+ B is a homotopy, then ItE and HE are isomorphic. 
o 
1.2.4 The universal bundle problem. We try to construct a principal G-bundle 
which is universal, in other words a bundle £: -+ B such that any principal G-bundle 
is induced by a map B -+ B, and more precisely: 
Definition 1.2.5 A numerable principal G-bundle £: -+ B is universal il 
1. For any numerable principal G-bundle E -+ B, one can find a map I : B -+ B 
such that E is isomorphic to r £:. 
2. Two maps I,g : B -+ B induce isomorphic bundles il and only if they are 
homotopic. 
Milnor [56] gave a very beautiful, and furthermore explicit construction of uni-
versal bundles. 
1.2.6 The Milnor join. Let 
EG = G*G* ···*G*··· 
be the "infinite join", or more explicitely: 
EG = limEG(n) 
where EG(n) is the quotient of 
by 
Vi 
=} Xi = x~ 
We shall write (xo, to; ... ; X n , tn ) for the equivalence class of the element under con-
sideration. 
2see for example the book by Husemoller [15]. 

116 
Equivariant cohomology 
Examples. 
1. G = Z/2 = {±1}. Then EG(n) is identified with sn by: 
EG(n) 
-+ 
sn 
(xo,to; ... ;xn,tn) ~ (~xo, ... ,~xn) 
2. G = SI. The very same formulas identify EG(n) with SZn+1. 
The limit EG is defined by the inclusion maps 
EG(n) 
C 
EG(n + 1) 
(xo, to; ... ; xn, tn) 
1-+ (xo, to; ... ; xn, tn; xn+!, 0) 
Any element in EG will thus be written 
or for brevity (x, t). 
Endow this space with the least expensive topology suclt that all the maps 
EG 
-+ [O,IJ 
(xo, to; ... ; xn, tn) 
~ tj 
and 
t;-I(]O,I]) 
-+ G 
(xo,to; ... ;xn,tn) ~ 
Xj 
are continuous. 
The group G acts on EG(n) and EG by 
g. (x, t) = (gx, t). 
It is clear that these actions are free and the quotients will be denoted respectively 
BG(n) and BG. 
Example. 
1. We saw, for G = Z/2 that EG(n) = sn (and EG = SOO). The group acts by 
the antipodal map, BG(n) = pn(R) and BG = POO(R). 
2. In the same way, for G = SI, BG(n) = pn(c), and BG = POO(C). 
We shall now explain (without too much proof) that these spaces are actually 
made to be universal: 
One begins by showing that all numerable bundles have a numerable partition 
of unity which makes them locally trivial. 
Granted this, consider the tj'S on EG as a universal partition of unity (E tj = 1), 
to show: 
Proposition 1.2.7 For any numerable principal G-bundle, Eover B, there exists a 
map f: B -+ BG such t-hat f*EG ~ E. 

Principal and universal bundles 
Proof. 
Construct two maps f et 9 making the diagram 
E ~ EG 
~ 
~ 
B ...L. BG 
117 
commute. That for, consider a partition of unity (u .. ) .. ~o on B such that E1u;1(]O,l)) 
is trivial. Let U .. = U;;l(]O, 1]) and let 
U. 
G 
Ion 
E 
.. X 
--+ 
IUn 
lqn 
G 
be a local trivialisation. Simply define 9 by: 
This is better defined than one might think: h;;l(Z) is defined only if z E p-l(U .. ), 
but, otherwise, un(p(z» = O. 
The map 9 is necessarily an isomorphism and more generally: 
Lemma 1.2.8 Let Ej -+ B j (i = 1,2) both be principal G-bundles. Any morphism: 
induces an isomorphism E2 ~ f* E1 • 
Proof of the lemma. 
and g' : E2 -+ f*Et. defined by g'(e2) = (g(e2),p(e2» is a morphism of principal 
G-bundles over B 2• It is easy to check that g' is injective: g'(e) = g'(e') =? p(e) = 
p(e') =? e' = x . e for some x E G, applying g' again, one sees that x = 1. Moreover 
g' is surjective as well: let e E f* Et, and let e' be a point in the same fiber as the 
image of e in E2. One can find an x E G such that g'(xe') = e. 0 0 
It is a little more technical, but not much more difficult, to prove that the Milnor 
join is indeed universal. From this universality, some kind of unicity follows: if 
El -+ Bl and E2 -+ B2 are two universal principal G-bundles, writing explicitely 
this property for the former gives a morphism: 
E2 
--+ El 
~ 
~ 
B2 ...L. Bl 

118 
Equivariant cohomology 
and similarly, writing that E2 -+ B2 is universal gives a morphism g : Bl -+ B2. As 
fog : Bl -+ Bl induces an isomorphism, it is homotopic to the identity, and the 
same is true for go f: thus the homotopy type of the universal space BG is well 
defined. As we shall use these spaces only in algebraic topology calculations, the 
unicity of their homotopy type will be sufficient for our purposes. 
One proves (see [32]) that 
Proposition 1.2.9 If E -+ B is any principal G-bundle the total space E 0/ which 
is contractible, then it is a universal principal G-bundle. 0 
In [56], Milnor proved that his spaces are weakly contractible (this means that 
their homotopy groups are zero), but in the mentioned paper, Dold showed that 
Milnor joins are actually contractible (as it is a little technical, we shall admit this 
result here). 
Examples of applications. 
1. If H is a subgroup of G, it acts on EG, and EG/ H is a model for BH. 
2. If G and H are two groups, the product G X H acts on EG x EH in the way 
you imagine and the quotient is BG x BH which is a model for B(G X H}. 
3. If / : G -+ H is a group morphism, it induces a continuous map BG -+ BH: 
it is easy to construct on the "Milnor join" models. 
Examples. 
1. From Z/m C SI, we deduce that the quotient of S2n+1 by the equivalence 
relation: 
(m = 1 => (zo, ... , zn) '" «(zo, ... , (zn) 
is a finite approximation to BZ/m, the latter then being Soo /Z/m, the "infinite 
lens space". 
2. In the same way Tm = SI X ••• X SI acts diagonally on S2n+1 X ••• X S2n+l 
which is thus found to be an approximation to ETm and BSI x .,. X BSI 
becomes therefore a model for BTm. 
3. Consider the join EU(k)(n) = {(Ao,toj ... jAn,tn)IAj E U(k)} and the map 
into the Stiefel manifold v,,(c"(n+1») which, with any (A, t) associates the k 
column vectors in the k(n + 1) rows matrix 

The Borel construction and equivariant cohomology 
Taking limits and passing to quotients, this induces a morphism 
EU(k) 
.\. 
BU(k) 
119 
In order to conclude that the infinite Grassmann manifold Gk(COO) is a model 
for BU(k) it is thus enough to be convinced that Vi,(COO) is contractible. 
2 
The Borel construction and equivariant cohomology 
2.1 
The Borel construction 
1£ W is a space acted on by the group G, we know very well that the orbit space 
WIG may be rather complicated. The idea in the Borel construction is to try to get 
a reasonable substitute for this quotient. 
Make G act on EG x W by 
g . (e, x) = (g . e, g . x). 
This is a free action, as it is free on the first factor. 
Definition 2.1.1 The quotient Wa = EG Xa W is called the Borel construction on 
W. 
Remark. In this way we have only defined the homotopy type of this space. 
Consider the two projection maps from the product EG x W : 
• 
EG x W 
--+ EG 
Wa 
--+ BG 
induces a fibration with fiber W . 
• The second projection induces a map u 
Wa -+ WIG ... which is not a 
fibration in general, but for which we have: 
Proposition 2.1.2 If G is a compact Lie group acting smoothly and freely on a 
manifold W, then 
u: WG --+ WIG 
is a fibration with contractible fibers, and in particular is a homotopy equivalence. 

120 
Equivariant cohomology 
Proof. 
Let us investigate first the fibers of u in the general case. Let x E Wand 
let [x] E WIG be its orbit. 
u- 1([x]) = {[e, y] E EG xo Wlproj[e, y] = [xl} 
Let us find the classes [e, xl for e E EG: 
[e',x] '" [e,x] {:> 3g E Gle' = g. e,x = g. x 
that is: 9 E G." and u-1([x)) = EGIG., '" BG.,. 
When the G-action is free, all the fibers are thus spaces EG, in particular they are 
contractible. The local triviality is left as an exercise (of course!)-it is a consequence 
of that of W -+ WIG (with the hypothesis made, it is the slice theorem). 0 
It is in this sense that one may say that Wo is the homotopy quotient of W: 
when the genuine quotient is "good", it has the same homotopy type, and Wo is a 
"good" quotient in general. 
On the contrary, if the G-action on W is trivial, then Wo = BG x Wj this is the 
case when W is a point, in which case Wo = BG. 
2.2 
Equivariant cohomology 
Definition 2.2.1 I/W is a topological space acted on by a group G, the equivariant 
cohomology 0/ W, written BMW), is the cohomology 0/ Wo. 
There will be therefore as many possible theories as there are cohomology theo-
ries. Here we shall mainly use de Rham cohomology. That is to say that we shall 
assume W to be a smooth manifold, with a G-action which is smooth as well. Un-
fortunately, neither EG nor a/orteon Wo are manifolds, which causes some trouble: 
what could be a differentiable form on Wo? All the groups we shall be interested in 
are subgroups of some U(n), and this allows us to use the "infinite Stiefel manifold" 
Vn(COO) = UIcVn(Cn+k) or any other union of manifolds that would fit as a model 
for EG, a differentiable form then being a family of differentiable forms, that agree 
via the inclusions3 • 
Remark. The reader may ask why we are doing such complicated things: a simpler 
way to define an "equivariant cohomology" would seem to be to consider the coho-
mology of G-invariant forms on W. Actually, when G is compact, this is nothing 
else than the usual de Rham cohomology of W, as the next (easy) exercise shows. 
Exercise 2.2.2 Show that, if a is an invariant k-form (a E {l1c(W)O), dais an 
invariant (k + I)-form, in other words that there is a commutative diagram: 
{l1c(W)O ~ {l1c+l(W)O 
Ii 
Ii 
{l1c(W) 
~ {lk+l(W) 
SIn general, we shall content ourselves with a finite approximation of EG or Wa. 

The Borel construction and equivariant cohomology 
121 
If G is compact, show that the inclusion j of invariant forms in the space of all forms 
is a "quasi-isomorphism" (i.e. induces an isomorphism at the cohomology level). 
This fake "equivariant cohomology" has nothing more to say than the cohomology 
of W. On the contrary, we ha.ve very good reasons to think that the cohomology of 
Wa says more: for exa.mple, if W is a. point, then Wa = BG and HtJ(pt) = H*(BG), 
which is never zero. 
On the other hand, HtJ(W), being the cohomology of a space Wa, is, in particular, 
a ring. It is even more: using the projection map Wa ..2:':..tBG, it receives the structure 
of an Hb(pt)-module. We shall mainly concentrate on this structure, which has a. 
lot to say about the action: for instance if it is free, Hb(W) e:! H*(W/G) is a torsion 
Hb(pt)-module. 
The first thing to do is to understand what kind of a ring Hb(pt) is. We limit 
ourselves to the case where G is a torus, and we begin of course by the G = Sl case. 
Theorem 2.2.3 H*(BS1) is a polynomial ring, on a degree 2 genemtor u. 
Remark. This is true over Z and therefore over any ring of coefficients, as will be 
the case for all statements in this chapter which are not given with more precision. 
We have to calculate the cohomology of POO(C). We have more precisely: 
Proposition 2.2.4 
H*(pn(C)j Z) e:! Z[ul/un+1 
and the inclusion j : pn(c) <-+ pn+1(C) induces 
Z[u]/un+2 L 
Z[u]/un+t 
u 
u 
from which the theorem is easily deduced, and of which the proof will be given in 
appendix A. Merely recall here that 'U is the Euler class of the complex line bundle 
0(1), the canonical bundle over POO(C), for more details we refer the reader to the 
mentioned appendix. 
Write 
to derive: 
Corollary 2.2.5 Let T be a dimension n torus, then H*(BT) is a polynomial ring 
on n degree 2 variables. 
2.3 
Generators for de Rham cohomology 
2.3.1 Cohomology of BSI. Using the previous results, we shall now exhibit 
"the" generator of H2(BSlj R) and take this opportunity to introduce the notion 
of a connection.

Equivariant cohomology 
Let 8 2n- 1 C C n be the unit sphere E IZil2 = 1. Make 8 1 act diagonally (t .

Let a be the I-form (on cn, or on 8 2n- 1) 
1 n 
0'= 2 E (-pjdqj + qjdp;) , 
;=1 
By definition, ixO' == 1. On the other hand, 
dO' = H - E dpj 1\ dq; + E dq; 1\ dp;) 
= -w 
where w = E dp; 1\ dq; is the canonical symplectic form on c n • Remark once again 
that ixw = dH for H = t E Iz;12 and thus, that on 8 2n- 1 
ixO' _ 
1 
CxO' = dixO' + ixdO' = 0 - dH = 0 
as H is constant on 8 2n- 1• 
In other words, a is invariant (second condition) and moreover it is a connection 
form on the 8 1-principal bundle 11" : 8 2n- 1 -t pn-l(C) (see definition 2.4.4). 
Consider now the 2-form dO' on 8 2n- 1• It satisfies ixdO' = 0 and CxdO' = 
dixdO' = O. We see that we can thus find a 2-form (7 on pn-l(C) such that 11"*(7 = dO' 
(for this reason, dais called a basic form)", Moreover (7 is closed because dais. 
Actually, it is, up to sign, the reduced symplectic form on projective space, in 
particular, for n ~ 2, it cannot be exact, and thus represents a nonzero element in 
H2(pn-l(C); R). 
All these definitions are compatible via the inclusion maps C n C C n+! and we 
have thus actually defined a nonzero element (7 in H2(B8l ; R). We still have to 
compare it with u, which is characterised by the fact that (u, IPl(C)]) = 1.

Thus -u /21r = U. 
2.3.3 The cohomology of BT. Once a basis (Xl,'" ,Xm) of t ~ Rm in chosen, 
we saw that we get an isomorphism

a homotopy equivalence

BT 
and a ring isomorphism 
4>*: H*BT _

(using de Rham cohomology). 
Make T act on e mn by 
(tt, ... , tm) . (Zt, ... , Zm) = (t1Z1,"" tmZm) 
where Zi E en. 
We can thus use s2n-1 X ••• X s2n-l as a finite approximation to ET. We have

m forms 0t, ... , Om with iX,Oi = oi,i and the isomorphism 
H2(BT) _ 
t* 
which sends (U1,"" um) on the basis dual to (Xl> ... ,Xm). 
Exercise 2.3.4 This isomorphism does not depend on the choice of the basis 
(Xt, ... ,Xm ). 
Hence we can identify H2(BT; R) with t* and the polynomial ring R[ut, ... , uml 
becomes the algebra S( t*) of multilinear symmetric forms5 on t. 
2.4 
Euler classes for fixed point free T-actions 
Using equivariant cohomology, we shall define the Euler class for an Sl-bundle or a 
T-bundle, thus generalising the definition of chapter I. 
Begin by considering a principal Sl-action on a manifold W, and the quotient 
B. We saw in 2.1.2 that the natural map 
u* : H*(B) -t HSl(W) 
is an isomorphism. 
Definition 2.4.1 The unique element in H2(B; Z) whose image by u* is -u is 
called the Euler class of the principal Sl-bundle W -t B. 
5The reader may find that it is not very elegant to choose a basis, then use it to define an 
isomorphism and then prove the latter does not depend on the basis. There exists of course an 
intrinsic method, namely Chern-Weil theory. 

124 
Equivariant cohomology 
Example. The Euler class of the principal Sl-bundle S2n+l -+ pn(c) is -u (one 
can either use this example as an exercise or look for a proof in appendix B). 
By universality of the principal Sl-bundle S2n+l -+ pn(c) (n large enough), we 
deduce the existence of connections on principal Sl-bundles: 
Proposition 2.4.2 Let 1f' : V -+ B be a principal Sl-bundle. Then there exists an 
invariant I-form a on V, satisfying furthermore ixa == 1 {and called connection 
form}. Moreover, da = 1f'*" where" is a 2-form over B, the curvature form, such 
that ['1] is the Euler class of the bundle on H'l(B; R). 0 
It is even easy to be more precise: 
Exercise 2.4.3 Let 1f' : V -+ B be a principal Sl-bundle, and let '1 be a 2-form on 
B such that ['1] is the Euler class of the bundle. Show that there exists a connection 
form a on V such that da = 1f'*'1' 
In the case of a torus T of dimension m, we may also consider (at, ... ,am) as a 
connection; let us state more generally the following definition: 
Definition 2.4.4 Let E -+ B be a principal G-bundle. A connection on E is a 
differentiable I-form (J on E taking values in g, and which satisfies the two properties 
1. VX E g, we have ix.(J = X 
2. (J is invariant, in the sense Vg E G, g*(J = Adg • (J. 
Example. If G is the torus T, consider (at, ... , am) (on the universal T-bundle) as 
a I-form with values in Rm 9! t*. Of course, it satisfies the above two properties. 
We have the existence of a connection on any principal G-bundle as soon as 
we are able to construct one on a universal principal G-bundle. We shall use only 
the cases G = S1 or T, for which have already actually proved the existence of 
connections. 
The definition (2.4.1) is extended to all fixed point free S1-actions by the very 
same method as in 1-3.4: choose a common multiple n of all orders of exceptional 
orbit stabilizers, and consider W' with the Sl/Z/n 9! Sl-action and the projection 
map p : W -+ W'. 
We may apply the previous definition to W'. Look at the diagram 
H2(B) ~ H~l/Z/n(W') 
1,* 
H~l(W) 
Let e' be the Euler class of the principal Sl-bundle W' -+ B: it is the unique 
element in H2(B) which satisfies u'*e' = -u'. But p*u' = nu. This assertion may be 

Equivariant cohomology and hamiltonian actions 
125 
checked at the classifying space level, where we must show that the n-fold covering 
map 
Sl~Sl 
induces multiplication by n in H2(BSl). But the induced map from BSI onto itself 
is precisely the one which classifies the bundle O(n) as we shall see in appendix B. 
IT the ring of coefficients we are using allows division by n, we thus have a unique 
class e E H2(B) (namely e'/n) such that u*e = -u. We call it the Euler class of 
the Sl-action on W. We still have to prove (having used the same name) 'that if 
dim W = 3, it is the same Euler class as in chapter I. This will be done in the 
mentioned appendix, which will be specially devoted to the study of Euler classes. 
In the same way, dealing with a principal (resp. without singular orbits) torus 
T-action (dimT = m) on the manifold W with quotient B, one can define an Euler 
class e E H2(B)m (resp. with coefficients in a ring containing the inverses of the 
orders of the stabilizers). 
IT we do not want to be intrinsic, it is the unique element e = (el,"" em) E 
(H2( B»m such that 
IT we do, then using de Rham cohomology, e E H2(Bj R) 0 t is the unique class 
such that, in the diagram 
we have u*(e,e} = e (where (e,e) is the element of H2(B) we get using duality in t 
in an obvious way). 
For example, any regular level of the moment map p. : W -+ t* of a hamiltonian 
T -action on the manifold W (assumed to be symplectic!) defines a Euler class e 
in the cohomology of the symplectic reduced orbifold (see II-3.6.6), at least with 
rational coefficients.

Equivariant cohomology and hamiltonian actions 
3.1 
Relationships between hamiltonian actions and equivariant coho-
mology 
As we have already had the opportunity to mention, equivariant cohomology is a 
very convenient language in which to speak of hamiltonian group actions. This is 
clear in the statement of the easily proven: 

126 
Equivariant cohomology 
Proposition 3.1.1 Let (W,w) be a symplectic manifold endowed with a symplectic 
action of the Lie group G. The action is hamiltonian if and only if there exists a 
closed 2-form wK on the Borel construction Wo whose restriction to each fiber of 
Wo -
BG isw. 
Proof. Let ° 
be a connection form6 on EG. Asume the G-action is hamiltonian, 
let I' : W -
g* be its moment map. Then ° 
® I' is a I-form taking values in 9 ® g*, 
and may be contracted to give a I-form taking values in R, and denoted (0,1')' 
Consider now the 2-form w = w + d(O,I') on EG x W. It is G-invariant by 
definition and moreover: 
VX Eg ixw = iXw + iXd(O, Il) 
= ixw - dix..(O, Il) 
= iXw - d(iXO, Il) 
= iXw - d(X, Il) 
= ixw - dilx = o. 
Hence w satisfies Cxw = 0 and ixw = 0, moreover it is obvious that it is closed, it 
thus comes from a closed 2-form ~D on Wo. 0 
Exercise 3.1.2 Prove the converse (you need to use the acyclicity of EG: closed 
forms are exact). 
Remark. The construction of the symplectic form in IV-2.4.2 is completely analo-
gous. 
3.2 
Variation of the reduced symplectic forms 
Consider now a torus T acting on a symplectic manifold (w,w) with moment map 
Il : W -
t*. Let e be a regular value of Il and ie : Ve c W the inclusion of the 
corresponding level. As ie is T -equivariant, there is a map 
lXTi( 
ET XT Ve 
'-+ ET XT W 
and w: = (1 x Tie)*wD is the unique closed form on ET XT Ve which can be lifted 
to ET x Ve as i;w + (dO, e) because we actually have 
w = w + d(O,I') 
= w + (dO, Il) - (0, dll) 
(1) 
61 agree that I have only proved the existence of such a form in the case where G is a torus, 
but it is the only case where we shall need the present result. The reader may read the statement 
and proof assuming G is a torus, but it is true in a more general set up.

From (2) we deduce immediatly the inverse image of the class [w~l by the morphism

Let now U be a convex open subset of t*, all points of which are regular values

There is thus a unique (i.e. independent of e E U) class

Consider for example the case of a circle action on a 4-manifold. The 
theorem asserts that the function

It is perfectly completed by lemma IV-1.2.1 which expresses the variation of the 
slope at each critical value. For example the discussion in IV-2.3.3 is shortened in a 
very simple way by the graph of the "volume function" (figure 1). 
4 Duistermmat-Heckman with singularities 
In this section, we describe a construction, independently due to M. Brion and C. 
Procesi [27] on the one hand and to V. Guillemin and S. Sternberg [39] on the other, 
and which generalises the previous remarks. 
For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume throughout that all actions are semifree 
(see nevertheless the remark below). 
4.1 
The "simple" situation 
Let us come back to the situation of the exercises 2.2.2, 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 in chapter 
IV. We begin with a solution of these exercises. Let H be a periodic hamiltonian on 
a symplectic manifold Wand consider a critical submanifold Z of H with signature 
(2,2p). That is to say that, transversally to Z, W = C X CI' with 
t . (x, Yt, . .. , YI') = (tx, tYI!'" ,tyl') 
and H = Ix 12 -IYII2 -
••• -Iyl' 12. Transversally to Z we thus have the same situation 
as in IV-figure 1. Following the gradient flow, we get a map

(x, YI, ... , Yp) 
1--+ (xYI!'''' xYp) 

Duistermmat-Heckman witb singularities 
129 
which we may restrict to each level of H and quotient. It is easily seen that this 
map is the quotient map when restricted to any positive level. When p ~ 2 it is no 
longer true at negative levels: the gradient manifold (Yl, ... , y,,) is contracted to a 
point. In any case, we get a diagram 
where

v_ = {(x,y) IIxl2 -lyl2 = -e}

and the quotient B_ is the total space of the tautological line bundle O( -1) over 
the quotient P,,-l(C) of 8 2,,-1, in other words the blow-up C" of C" at o. The map 
B_ -+ C" contracts [Yb ... ,y,,] and is precisely the blow up. 
We thus remark that the surgery upstairs (from V_ to V+) corresponds downstairs 
to the blow up of a point B_ -+ B+ (transversally to Z). 
Remarks. 
1. On reduced symplectic forms: a straightforward computation shows that at the 
-c level the reduced symplectic form on B_ integrates to e on the generator 
of the second cohomology group of the exceptionnal divisor. We thus see, 
using the hamiltonian H, a (real) 1-parameter family of symplectic manifolds 
which, for negative values of the parameter care CP's such that the volume 
of their exceptional divisor decreases to 0 as c -+ o. For nonnegative values 
of the parameter the exceptional divisor has disappeared and the symplectic 
manifolds are C"'s. 
2. On weights: once we accept working with orbifolds as quotients, there is no 
essential difference with non semifree actions. .. in particular with actions of 
the form (tx, r Yb ... , r y,,) which will appear in the following, even after 
having started with semifree actions. 
4.2 
General case of a fixed submaniCold of signature (2p,2q) 
Transversally to Z we have now W = Cp+q, Z = 0, and 
t . (YI, ... , Yp, Zt, . .. , Zq) = (tyt. ... , ty", tzI, • •• ,tZq) 
and the trick is to blow up W along Z in order to be in the previous simple situation. 
Thus look at 
C"'P+q = {(['1, (], y, z) with incidence relation} 
wit.h the 8 1-action extended linearly as usually: 
t . (['1, (], y, z) = ([t'1, tel, tv, tz). 

130 
Equjvariant cohomology 
The "point" Z = 0 becomes two fixed submanifolds included in the exceptional 
divisor y = z = 0: a pq-l(C) (" = 0) and a Pp-I(C) «( = 0). Note that all points 
of the exceptional divisor now have a Z/2 as stabilizer. Let Ii be a hamiltonian 
for the Sl-action (with respect to some invariant symplectic form on the blown up 
manifold). Look now at the normal bundles and indices of critical submanifolds: 
pq-I(C) CpC(-1) PP+q-I(C) CO(-l) Cp+q 
the normal bundle thus beingpO( -1)E90(-1) -+ pq-I(C) where the first summand 
corresponds to the coordinate" and the second one to an incidence coordinate ,\ 
(sum that z = '\(). The Sl-action on those is given by t· (",,\) = (t", I'\). Similarly 
for PP-I(C) C PP+q-l(C) C cli+" where we get (I(,tll)' 
We can conclude as in [39] that we now have two copies of the preceeding simple 
situation. But let us continue and look at the following picture (figure 2). Call V'

as in [27] where B' was defined as a fiber product, a definition whim could seem 
rather artificial from the topological viewpoint (if not from the algebraic one). 
Remark. Recall that Va was a critical level, thus Bo is not smooth in general. 
Let us now describe more precisely the topology of V' and B' (and the map 
B' -+ Bo). The regular level V' = H-t(O) meets the exceptional divisor pp+q-I(C) 

Duistermmat-Heckman with singularities

along 1'112 = 1(12. This submanifold of pp+q-l(C) is the quotient of S2p-l x S2q-l C 
S2P+2q-l by the diagonal Sl-action. Being the common boundary of tubular neigh-
borhoods of PP-l(C) and pq-l(C) in pp+q-l(C), it is a sphere bundle over pq-l(C) 
(S(pO(-l)) -+ pq-l(C)) as well as over PP-l(C) (S(qO(-l» -+ Pp-l(C». Look 
Figure 3 
now at quotients: to construct B', we removed the singular point and replaced it 
with V' n exc/ Sl. This is the same as the quotient of S(pO( 1)) -+ pq-l (C) by 
['1, (] "" [t'1,t(] '" [t2'1, (] and thus is nothing other than the projectivised bundle 
P(pO(l)) -+ pq-l(C). Of course the projectivised bundle is trivial and the quotient 
is a Pp-l(C) X pq-l(C). 
Remark. If q (or p) equals 1, we get the blowing up of a point (or a smooth 
submanifold) of Bo which in this case is smooth as we have already remarked. In 
general the map B' -+ Bo is a blow-up in the algebraic sense.

Application: The Duistermaat-Heckman problem at critical values 
Why are we looking for a diagram like (4)? In the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem 
3.2.2 all the regular quotients of H-l(±e) were identified with the same manifold B± 
and this allowed us to compare the classes [O'e] E H2(B+) (resp. [O'_e] E H2(B_» 
and to prove that in each case, staying in the same component of the set of regular 
values, [O'e] was an affine function of e. 

132 
Equivariant cohomology 
The diagram (4) will be used to compare [O'e] and [O'-e]' 
Recall first the 4-dimensional case (see IV-2.2) in which B+, Eo, B_ are the 
same surface B and thus it is very easy to compare O'e and O'-e just by looking at 
the function 
t 1--+ Is qt· 
Over each component of the regular set, the graph is a straight line (with integral 
slope in the semi free case we are considering). We have already studied the surgery 
when crossing the critical level Va: the slope decreases by 1. In this situation, the 
change in the topology of the quotient is by ... blowing up a point in C (i.e. no 
change at all). This apparently trivial action is nontrivial at the level of reduced 
symplectic forms where the -1 corresponds to a blow-up. 
In the general case of an 81-action: look at the diagram H2(diagram (4)) in 
which we see 
which enables us to compare the classes of the reduced symplectic forms in H2(B'}. 
Consider the curve t 1-+ [O'tl - [0';] defined, for all t > 0, as follows: 
• [O't] is the class of the reduced symplectic form at level t considered as an 
element in H 2(B') via the inclusion . 
• [O'tl for t < 0, being an affine function of t, is easy to extend as an affine 
function for all t, [0':1 denotes its value for the positive values of t (once again 
the inclusion is omitted). 
Theorem 4.3.1 ([27]) The CUMJe t 1-+ [O't1-10':1 is a half-line, directed by the class 
of the exceptional divisor of the map B' -
Bo. 
Proof. 
The exceptional divisor of the map B' _ Bo is the sum of the two excep-
tional divisors of B' _ B±. Since everything is affine it is thus sufficient to prove 
the theorem in the "simple" case where it is an obvious consequence of the remark 
on reduced symplectic forms in 4.1. 0 
Another remark in the Guillemin and Sternberg paper is that everything we did, 
we could have done in an equivariant way for any group action which commutes 
with the 8 1-action. Consider for instance a hamiltonian torus action with moment 
map Jl : W -
t* and try to compare the reduced symplectic forms when crossing a 
codimension 1 wall between two polytopes of regular values of ,.,.. It is sufficient to 
be able to cross it orthogonally and thus to consider a 8 1 X T n- 1 situation which 
can be studied as before.

5.1 
The support of a H*BT-module 
Once again, H* denotes de Rham cohomology. Identify 
H* BT £!! S( t*) £!! R[Ub ... , un) 
(the last isomorphism depending on the choise of a basis in t) in particular, consider 
elements of H* BT as functions on t or as polynomials in (Ub ... , un). 
Let M be a H* BT-module. Its support is 
Supp M = n VJ c t 
{JIJ·M=O} 
where, for f E H* BT ~ S(t*), VJ = {X E tlf(X) = o}. 
Examples. 
1. If M is free, then f . M = 0 ::} f = 0 ::} VJ = t ::} Supp M = t: modules 
having a proper support does have torsion. 
2. If T = S1, the ring H* BT is a principal ideal domain (polynomials in one 
variable). If f is a generator of the ideal annihilating M, then Supp M consists 
of the zeros of f. In this example, one can imagine why it might be more 
convenient to use complex coefficientsj it suffices for that to replace H* BT by 
H* BT ® C £!! H*(BTj C) and t by t ® C thus, when M does have torsion, 
there is a (proper) support. We shall see that in the hamiltonian case there 
is no problem and we can "stay real": the supports we shall have to consider 
will be unions of vector subspaces. 
3. The module {o} has empty support. 
Lemma 5.1.1 If M'~M--.!!....M" is an exact sequence of H*BT-modules, then 
SuppM C SuppM'USuppM". 
Proof. 
Put S = SuppM, S' = SuppM' and S" = SuppM". Let x f/. s' uS". 
Then, as x f/. S', there exists a polynomial f such that f(x) =1= 0 and f ·M' = O. For 
the same reasons, there exists a polynomial g annihilating Mil but not x. But 
b(g . M) = g . b(M) C 9 . Mil = 0 
thus g·M C a(M') and f ·(g.M) C a(f .M') = 0 hence (fg).M = 0 ... f(x)g(x) =1= 0 
and so x f/. s. 0 
Similarly: 

134 
Equivariant cohomology 
Exercise 5.1.2 If 0 -+ M' -+ M -+ M" -+ 0 is an exact sequence of H*BT-
modules, then 
Supp M = Supp M' U Supp M". 
and also: 
Lemma 5.1.3 II M et M' are H* BT -algebras7 and il a : M' -+ M is a morphism 
01 algebras, then Supp M C Supp M'. 
Proof. If x ¢ SuppM', there is a polynomial I annihilating M' but not x. The 
unit 1M' is killed by I, a(f . 1M') = I ·lM = 0 so I kills M and x ¢ SuppM. 0 
5.2 Supports of Hf(U), examples 
Let us now begin to investigate the H* BT-module structure of the equivariant 
cohomology of T-manifolds. 
Lemma 5.2.1 Let H be a closed subgroup olT. Then 
SuppHT(TIH) = ~ C 1. 
Proof. 
Remark first that ET XT TIH '" ETIH '" BH, whence we deduce that 
Hf(T I H) is simply H* BH with the H* BT-module structure given by the restriction 
H* BT --+ H*BH. 
On the other hand, H is a closed subgroup of the torus T, and so, up to the fact 
that it might not be connected, it is a torus. More precisely, it is the product of a 
torus Ho by some finite group that de Rham cohomology will not even notice and 
hence we suppose that H is a torus. 
The structure of H* BH as an H* BT-module is rather easy to understand. The 
inclusion of the Lie algebra 
i:~--+t 
induces the restriction of polynomials 
SCi) : S(t*) --+ S(~*). 
The torsion elements of H* BH are thus all the polynomials on t whose restriction 
to ~ vanishes. Thus 
SuppHT(TIH) =. n VI = ~ 
11~=o 
o 
Corollary 5.2.2 Let X be a T-manilold. Assume there exists an equivariant map 
X -4 TIH. Then SuppHf(X) c~. 
7 with units, of course. 

Localisation at fixed points 
Proof. 
r: HT(T/H) ---+ HT(X) 
is a ring morphism. Applying lemma 5.1.3 we find that 
SuppHHT/H) ::> HHX) 
o 
135 
The corollary may be applied in particular when X is an equivariant tubular 
neighborhood of any orbit of the smooth T-action on a manifold W (thanks to the 
slice theorem) and gives: 
Corollary 5.2.3 If X is an equivariant tubular neighborhood of a type (H) orbit in 
the T-manifold W, then SuppHi-{X) c ~. 0 
and in the same way 
Corollary 5.2.4 1fT acts freely on W, then Supp HHW) = O. 0 
Considering now the union of all orbits in W whose stabilizer is a proper subgroup 
of T i.e. the complement of the fixed point set F, we are going to prove: 
Proposition 5.2.5 Let F be the fixed point set of a T -action on a compact manifold 
W. Then 
SuppHT(W - F) c U ~ 
H 
where H describes the (finite) set of all the (proper) stabilizers of points in W. 
Remark. In particular, this support is a proper subspace of t, contained in a finite 
union of vector subspaces, thus Hi-{W - F) is a torsion H* BT-module. 
Proof. The space W - F has the same (equivariant) homotopy type as the comple-
ment of a small equivariant neighborhood of F. The compiement may be covered 
by open subsets U1, •• • ,Uh which are equivariant tubular neighborhoods of orbits 
(with proper subgroups of T as stabilizers). 
We may apply corollary 5.2.3 to each U;, and this will allow us to prove by 
induction on h : 
Supp HHU1 u ... UUh) C ~l U ... U ~h. 
Start the induction by applying 5.2.3 to U1• Now suppose the result to hold up to 
order h, put Vh = U1 U ... UUh and thus VhH = Vh UUhH' 
We have Supp HHVh) C U~=l ~; by the induction hypothesis, and hence we can 
use the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence: 
Hi-{Vh nUh+d

This gives the result for Supp V"+1 and for Supp M it follows from lemma 5.1.1 and 
the proposition. 0 
5.3 The localisation theorem 
Our goal in this investigation is to prove rather precise versions of the fact that, 
forgetting torsion, the H* BT-module HT(W) looks very much like the free H* BT-
module HT(F). 
Theorem 5.3.1 Let i : F '-+ W be the inclusion 0/ fixed points. Then both the 
kernel and cokernel 0/ 
i* : HT(W) -t HT( F) 
have support included in UH stabilizer ';'T ~. 
Proof. Let U be an equivariant tubular neighborhood of the fixed point set F. We 
know that 
SuppHT(W -U) C U ~ 
H';'T 
and that the same is true of Supp HT( O(W - U». Using the long (equivariant) 
cohomology exact sequence of the pair (W -U,o(W -U», the same is true for the 
support of Hf(W -U,o(W -U». 
Let V be another equivariant tubular neighborhood, a little larger than U, such 
that V - U '" o(W - U) = au. Thus: 
exclsion 
HT(W,F) ~ HT(W, V) 
~ HT(W -U, V -U) ~ HT(W -U,o(W -U» 
and in particular, SuppHf(W,F) C u~. 
The exact sequence of the pair (W, F) 
HT(W,F) -t HT(W)~HT(F) -t HT(W,F) 
alows us to conclude. 0 
The rank of the H* BT -module HHW) is thus the same as the rank of the free 
module Hf(F). It is possible to give an even more precise statement, using the 
notion of localisation. 
If / E H* BT is a nonzero element, consider the localised subring (H* BT)J of 
the ring of fractions H*BT, consisting of all the fractions which have a power of / 
as denominator. In the same way, for any module M, consider 
MJ = M ® (H*BT)J 
H*BT 
the localised (H* BT)rmodule obtained by extension of scalars. 

Localisation at fixed points 
137 
Let f be a polynomial which vanishes on all the ~'s. Consider the induced 
morphism 
i* : (HT(W))J ~ 
(HT(F))J 
It is an isomorphism because of 
Lemma 5.3.2 Let M'~M...!.....M" be an exact sequence of modules. Then the 
sequence 
M' G'M b'M" 
J~ J~ J 
is exact. 
In other words, (H* BT) J is flat. 
Proof. 
b' 0 a' = 0 as boa, hence 1m a' C Ker b'. Reciprocally, let x E Ker b'. By 
the definition of Mj, we can find an integer m such that fm x E M and as we have 
b'(x) = 0, b(fmx ) = fmb'(x) = 0 so that fm x E Kerb = Ima. We can thus write 
fm x = a(y) and 
x = a(y) = a' (.JL) E Ima'.

According to the lemma, the kernel and cokernel of the (localised) morphism i* 
are the localisations of the kernel (N) and cokernel (C). On the other hand, we 
know that Supp N C VJ and Supp C C VJ by the definition of f. Thus NJ and CJ 
are zero and i* is actually an isomorphism. 
Because of formula (8) (see appendix A) relating i* and the Gysin morphism i*: 
i*i*1 = eT(II), 
we suspect that i* is more or less the inverse isomorphism, up to the inversion of 
some Euler classes. This is what we shall make precise now. 
Let us begin with two properties of i* analogous to 5.3.1 for i*: 
Proposition 5.3.3 The kernel and cokernel of 
i*: HT(F) ~ 
HT(W) 
both have support in the union u~ of the Lie algebms of the stabilizers =f T of points

Equivariant cohomology 
Let us now invert Euler classes. Any polynomial' I vanishing on the support is 
suitable to define a localisation. We are going to construct a minimal such I. 
Let Z be a component of the fixed point set F of the T-action on W. Consider 
its equivariant Euler class eT(vz) e HT(Z) (see A.2.2). As the T-action on Z is 
trivial, H;j.( Z) 9! H*( Z) ® H* BT and we may decompose 
eT(vZ) = Eat ® 14m-i e H*(Z) ® H*BT 
iJ 
where the lower index denotes the degree of the cohomology class under considera-
tion, and 2m is the codimension of the submanifold Z in W. 
Of course, all degree> 0 elements in H*(Z) are nilpotent, and thus: 
Lemma 5.3.4 With these notations, eT(vZ) is invertible in Hf(Z) il and only if 
1:i a~ ® 14m is invertible. 0 
Let z e Z be a fixed point. The sum 1: a~ ® f4m may be interpreted as the 
restriction of eT(vz) in HO(z) ® H 2m BT 9! HT(z). Let us compute this restriction. 
Write 
TzW = TzZ ffi Ll ffi ... ffi Lm 
where T acts on Li by the morphism 0i : T -+ 81, and denote also by 0i : t -+ R 
the linear form which is the derivative of 0i at 1. Then the restriction of eT(vz) is 
(up to sign) the product of the linear forms 0i (considered as a polynomial on t)8. 
Remark. It is clear that the kernel of 0i is one of the ~ 's in the support of Hf(W -
F). Indeed, H = Keroi C T fixes vectors in the subspace Li , but the T-action on 
Li is nothing other than the derivative at z of that on W. 
Let us put fz = n 0i (it is eT(vz ) for some z in Z) and f = nZCF fz. Then all 
the classes eT(vz) are invertible in (Hf(F»J and the map 
Q=E~ 
ZcF eT(vz) 
(where each iz is the inclusion of the component Z) defines a homomorphism 
inverse to i*, in other words:

5.3.6 
Actually, in the hamiltonian case, using a well chosen projection of the 
moment map and the ideas of [36], one shows that the H* BT-module HfW is the 
free module generated by H*W. The restriction to the fiber Hf W -+ H*W is 
surjective and the restriction to the fixed points i* : Hi-W -+ Hi-F is injective.

The Duistermaat-Heckman formula 
6.1 The Duistermaat-Heckman formula 
Theorem 6.1.1 ([34]) Let (W,w) be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 
2n and let H be a periodic hamiltonian on W with only isolated fixed points. Then 
Remarks. 
• It is not absolutely necessary to assume that the fixed points are isolated. 
There is a more general statement in [34]. 
• Similarly, it is not necessary to consider only circle actions, analogous results 
hold with higher dimensional tori. 
• The formula must be read as an equality of formal series in the variables u 
and u-1 • We shall come back to this remark later on. 
• If the formal variable u is replaced by it where t is a real parameter, this 
formula is an exact (i. e. without rest) "stationary phase formula" . 
• Reading again it instead of u, and up to Fourier transform, the formula ex-
presses the fact that the image measure on R (or on t* if we are dealing with a 
higher dimensional torus) of the symplectic volume wl\n / n! under the moment 
map has a piecewise polynomial density (with respect to Lebesgue measure), 
Proof. 
As H is a periodic hamiltonian, we know that the symplectic form w may 
be "extended" to WSI (3.1.1) as a closed 2-form wI, Consider the latter and all 
its powers. In order to deal with all of them at the same time, we use formally 
° = exp[wU] as if this was an element of H~, (W). Apply first the localisation 
theorem 5.3.5: 
·z·* 
(5) 
0= E '* 'zo . 
ZCF eSI(vz) 
Then "integrate in the fibers" (see A.6.1) of the fibration 11" : WSI -+ BSt, in other 
words apply 11"*. The right hand side of (5) becomes (as 1I"*i* = 1, see A.6.4 applied 
to the section BT = ET XT Z "--+ ET XT W = WT ): 
E izo 
ZeF eSI (vz)'

Equivariant cohomology 
We therefore calculate i~o = exp i~wl. The "form" wi is the projection of w+d(OH), 
so i~wl is the projection of i~(w + dOH - 0 1\ dH). As Z is a point, this is simply 
the projection of dOH(Z) that is -uH(Z). 
The right hand side of (5) is thus 
e-uH(Z) 
~esl(Vzr 
Look now at the left hand side: 11"*0 = 1£'* expwl . We thus have to consider 
exp(w + dOH - 01\ dH) on E81 X W, to integrate over Wand to project. During 
the integration process over W, all the terms in the exponential of degree different 
from 2n vanish. There remains only wAnjn! and (dH)2nj(2n)!, the latter form being 
exact, it also integrates to zero. The form dO still projects onto -u. The left hand 
side in (5) is thus

Examples of applications 
In this paragraph, we make formula 6.1.1 talk. The left hand side is a formal series 
in u, but not a priori the right hand side: if 8 1 acts near the fixed point Z by 
then ±a1'" anun = eSI(vz) appears in the denominator. The Duistermaat-Heck-
man formula implies therefore that certain elements must vanish. 
Here are some examples of these cancellations. Assume for simplicity that H is 
the hamiltonian of a semifree action (i.e. ai = ±1). Let '\(Z) be the number of 
minus signs (the index of Z as a critical point of H is 2'\(Z». The formula is then: 
Put "u = 0" in this formula.

in other words 
Vol W = H(max) - H(min) 
as we know (111-3.2.1) that there are only one local minimum and one local 
maximum (see figure 4).

The degree 0, 1 and 2 terms in the brackets give respectively 
• Po - PI + P2 = 0 but we know that Po = PI = 1 and thus there are exactly 
two index 2 points. Call them a and b. 
• H(min) - (H(a) + H(b)) + H(max) = 0, in other words the two intervals 
[min, max] and [a, b] have the same rniddle. We already noticed these 
two properties in IV-2.3.3 and in the discussion following 3.2.2 (see figure 
1). 
• The third term computes the volume: 
Vol W = ~ [H(min? - (H(a? + H(W) + H(max)2] 
It is the surface of the trapezium in figure I! in other words this is the 
integral of the volume function t ~ Vol Bt• Actually in this case, using 
the methods of chapter IV, it is rather easily seen that W = S2 X S2, and 
that the SI-action extends to a T2-action ... of course the trapezium is 
the image of the moment map. 
3. The case where n = 3. With the same notations, and the same hypotheses, 
the same method gives for example 
PO-PI+P2-P3=0 
This, added to the fact that Po = P3 = 1 gives PI = P2. More generally, 
notice we allways have Pi = Pn-i in dimension 2n when the fixed points are 
isolated: this is Poincare duality, as H is a "perfect" Morse function and so 
Pk = dimH2k(W). 

142 
Equivariant cohomology 
Remark. In dimension 6 (n = 3) and with the hypotheses above, it can be shown 
that PI = P2 = 3. .. using essentially the same method, a localisation formula near 
fixed points analogous to a. 5.3.5, but in equivariant K-theory. In some sense it is 
even easier: the group KT(W) is defined (starting with T-vector bundles over W) 
much more simply than H;.(W) for which we had to use classifying spaces and the 
Borel construction. 
The functor KT has properties analogous to that of Hf, which allows us to prove 
a localisation theorem. From this theorem, Hattori remarked in [41] that it was 
possible to deduce, among other things, with our hypotheses (periodic hamiltonian, 
isolated critical points, semifree action) that Pi = ( 7 ). For n = 2, we have already 
explained this several timesj for n = 3 remark that the method, even if analogous, 
is nevertheless more powerful, as we are not able to deduce PI = P2 = 3 from 5.3.5 
ou 6.1.1. 
It is also with the help of the localisation formula in equivariant K-theory, for 
hamiltonian torus actions on toric varieties (see chapter VI) that M. Brion gave very 
elegant proofs of some results about convex polyhedra (see [26]). 
Exercise 6.2.1 Let (W,w) be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 2n 
endowed with a hamiltonian action of a torus Tn (of half the dimension). Let P be 
the polyhedron which is the image of W under the moment map 1'.

Appendix: some algebraic topology 
We shall give here some hints of proofs and references for the main notions of 
algebraic topology used in this chapter. There are a lot of good books. We already 
mentioned the one by Husemoller [15] when we used it at the beginning of the 
chapter. I like very much and used a lot the one by Milnor [16] especially for this 
appendix. 
A.1 
The Thorn class of an oriented vector bundle 
Let E -+ B be an oriented (for example, complex) vector bundle of (real) rank n. 
Denote Eo the complement of the zero section in E, F a fiber and Fo the intersection 
F n Eo. F is the vector space Rn and we have 
Hn(F,FojZ) = Hn(Rn,Rn - {O}jZ) e! H n- 1(Rn - {O}jZ) e! Hn-I(sn-IjZ)!:l!! Z 
so that the chosen orientation (which specifies the last isomorphism) gives, for each 
fiber F an element UF which generates the infinite cyclic group Hn(F, Fo; Z). The 

Appendix: some algebraic topology 
143 
Thom isomorphim theorem asserts the existence of a class on E the restriction of 
which to each fiber is UF : 
Theorem A.I.1 (Thorn isomorphism) There exists a unique cohomology class 
U E Hn(E, Eo; Z) whose restriction to Hn(F, Fo; Z) is UF (for any fiber F). More-
over the map: 
H*(E) -+ H*(E,Eo;Z) 
y 
1---+ 
y~U 
is an isomorphism. 
For the proof, first look at the case of the trivial bundle, which is rather easy, 
then cover the base space by open subsets which trivialise the bundle, and (at least if 
the base space B is compact) deduce the result by induction on the number of open 
subsets, with the help of Mayer-Vietoris and the five lemma (see [16] for details). 0 
The class U is called the Thom class of the oriented bundle E, it is clear that a 
change in orientation will change the sign of U. It is also clear that U is natural: if 
f : B' ~ B is a continuous map, U(J*E) = J*U(E). 
The isomorphism y 1-+ Y ~ U is the Thom isomorphism. 
A.2 
The Euler class of an oriented bundle, equivariant Euler class 
Definition A.2.1 The unique class e E Hn(B; Z) such that 1r*e = j*U where U is 
the Thom class and the maps are the natuml ones 
Hn(E, Eo; z)LHn(E; Z)?-H"(B; Z) 
is called the Euler class of the oriented bundle 1r : E ~ B. 
Remark. Changing the orientation of E changes the sign of e. On the other hand, 
e is natural as is the Thom class we used to define it. 
A.2.2 The equivariant Euler class. Recall that E ~ B is a G-vector bundle 
if it is a vector bundle, endowed with a G-action which is linear in the fibers and 
compatible with some G-action on the base space. This is what we need to form 
the vector bundle EG Xa E ~ EG Xa B. 
As such, it has an Euler class (if E is oriented) which we shall denote 
ea(E) E H;;(B) 
as we intend to call it the equivariant Euler class of the bundle E ~ B. 
A G-vector bundle may be trivial as a vector bundle without being trivial as a 
G-vector bundle, as the following example shows. 
Example. If B is a point, a G-vector bundle over B is nothing other than a linear 
representation of the group G. Such a representation has an Euler class in H*BG. 
For instance if G = SI and if E = C with the action t . v = tmv then ESt XSI E is 
the bundle O(-m) over BSI (see appendix B).

A.4 The cohomology of projective space 
To prove proposition 2.2.4, we use the Gysin exact sequence for the "tautological" 
line bundle: 
E = 0(-1) = {(l,v)11 C Cn+1,v E I} C pn(c) X C n+1 
Eo is the set of all pairs (I, v) where v ::f: 0, it is easily identified with C n+1 - {O} and 
its homotopy type is that of the sphere S2n+1. Let v be the Euler class of the bundle 
E (u in the statement 2.2.4 is just -v). We may write the Gysin exact sequence: 
-+ H"+1(S2n+1) -+ H"(pn(C»~Hk+2(pn(C»~Hk+2(S2n+1) -+ 
from which we immediately deduce that all the H2k+1(pn(c» vanish, and that 
'-' v: H2k(pn(c» -+ H21c+2(p"(C» 
is an isomorphism for 0 :5 2k :5 2n - 2. 0 
A.5 The Gysin homomorphism (case of an embedding) 
Let Z ~ W be a codimension m submanifold, with normal bundle v (assumed to 
be oriented). We define a Gysin homomorphism 
(which goes the wrong way and which does not preserve the graduation) by the 
composition: 
H"(Z)~Hlc+m(v, vol exc~on Hlc+m(w, W _ Z) .... ~onHlc+m(W) 
where of course, c) denotes the Thorn isomorphism for the bundle v.

By the very definition of the Euler class, we have the fundamental property

A.S.l The equivariant case. Suppose G acts on Wand Z, the embedding i 
being equivariant. Up to finite approximations, we may assume that 
• 
EG XG Z '-+ EG XG W 
is the embedding of a submanifold. Therefore we have a Gysin homomorphism 
i* : Hb(Z) ~ Hb(W). Computing i*i*1 gives the Euler class of the normal bundle 
of EG XG Z that is, the equivariant Euler class of v: 
A.6 The Gysin homomorphism: integration in the fibers 
A.6.l 
Let 11' : E ~ B be a locally trivial bundle with compact fibre F. Assume 
that B, E and F are manifolds and moreover that F is oriented and has dimension 
m. 
Let W be a k-form on E. We can associate to it a (k - m)-form on B, denoted 
1I'*W and defined thus: if k < m, 1I'*W = 0, otherwise 
where a is the m-form on 1I'-1(b) ~ F such that 
ax (Vb"" Vm) = Wz (Xl (X), ... , Xk-m(X), Vb"" Vm) 
in which formula X.(x) is any vector in TzE such that T.1I'(X.(x» = Xi E TbE 
(it is clear that the result of this process is well defined). 
We thus get a map

The diagram

Equivariant cohomology 
We thus get a morphism, still denoted 'If'* : HIc(E) -+ HIc-m(B), of which it is 
not hard to make a relative version which will appear in the following example (of 
course, in this paragraph, we are dealing with de Rham cohomology). 
Example. 
'If': S.,. -+ pt may be considered as a fibration with fiber sm. The 
homomorphism 
'If'*: Hm(sm) _ 
HO(pt)

1---+ 
Ism W 
sends the generator to 1. From the definition of the Thorn class U, we deduce that if 
E is an oriented rank n vector bundle over B, then 'If'* : HR(E, Eo) -+ HD(B) sends 
U to 1. 
A.6.S 
The reader may be frightened by the present terminology and ask (with 
some reason) what relationship exists between the * considered here (case of fibra-
tions) and the * of A.4 (case of embeddings). She or he may keep quiet 'If'* and 
i* are two aspects of a single Gysin homomorphism f* defined for any proper map 
f : V -+ W from one manifold into another. One possible way to define f* is pre-
cisely to decompose f as an embedding i : V -+ W X SR (n large) and a fibration 
'If' : W X SR -+ Wand to put f* = 'If'* 0 i* (it is not very hard to prove that it does 
not depend on the choices). 
A.6.4 
Consider for instance the case of the inclusion of a section i : B '-+ E of the 
bundle. We then have, for any y E H*(B), 'If'*i*y = y. In fact, i* is the composition 
of the horizontal maps in

Appendix: various notions of Euler classes 
We have already met two notions of Euler classes for fixed point free Sl-actions: 
in chapter I for 3-manifolds, where we got a number, and in 2.4 where a degree 2 
cohomology class was constructed. On the other hand, we have also used the Euler 
class of a (real) oriented vector bundle. In this appendix, we shall investigate the 
relations between these various notions. 

Appendix: various notions of Euler classes 
147 
B.l The case of 8 1-bundles 
Because all relevant definitions can be ultimately expressed in terms of principal 
bundles or actions, it is enough to study this latter case. We shall thus prove: 
Theorem B.l.l Let V be an oriented compact 3-manifold endowed with an 8 1 _ 
action. Let B be the oriented surface which is the quotient. If e E H2(B) is the 
Euler class of the 8 1-bundle V -+ B (in the sense of chapter V), then (e, [BD E Z 
is the Euler number in the sense of chapter I. 
Proof. 
1. It suffices to prove this in the case where B is a sphere: indeed, write B = 
B - Do u Do and the bundle is trivialised over each piece. Define a map 
f : B -+ 8 2 by collapsing the complement of a collar B - Do onto a point 
(figure 5). 
Figure 5 
The map f* : H2(82) -+ H2(B) is an isomorphism. Moreover, by the definition 
of f, the bundle V -+ B is exactly the pull-back by f of the bundle over the 
sphere which is trivial over each hemisphere and described by the same gluing 
data as V -+ B along the equatorial circle. 
We thus assume that B is a sphere 8 2• 
2. It suffices to consider the case where V -+ 8 2 is the Hopf bundle: in fact, if 
9 : 8 2 -+ 8 2 is a degree m map, it multiplies Euler classes (in the sense V) 
by m, but in the sense I as well: we may assume it induces Z 1-+ zm on the 
equatorial circle aDo

With obvious notations a' 1-+ ma and similarly au' 1-+ mau, but b'l-+ b as it 
is an orbit. We deduce that e = me' (in the sense of chapter I). 
3. For the Hopf bundle 8 3 -+ pI (e), the statement is clear, as we have e = -1 
in the sense of I and in the sense of V as well by definition of u.

Remark. We have just checked by explicit computation, and used the fact that the 
Hopfbundle S3 _ Pl(C) is universal among the principal Sl-bundles over surfaces. 
B.2 
Complex line bundles 
To any principal Sl-bundle V _ B we associate9 a rank 1 complex vector bundle 
E _ B using the usual linear SI-action over C : 
E= V XSI C 
where SI acts on V X C by t· (v,z) = (tv,lz). 
Examples. 
• Take V = S2n+t with the action defining the Hopf fibration. The map 
S2n+t xC 
--+ 
pn(c) 
(zo, ... , Zn; z) 
1--+ [zo, ... , znl 
becomes, taking quotients, the vector bundle 
Using the injection 
S2n+t XSI C 
'--+ 
pn(c) X cn+t 
[Zo, ... ,zn;zl 
1-+ ([ZO"",zn],ZOz"",znz) 
we may identify the vector bundle obtained with the tautological bundle 
O( -1) . 
• For any mE Z we also know how to define a bundle called O(m) over pn(c): 
O(m) = S2n+t X C/(Zo, ... , Zn; z) IV (tzo, ... , tzn; tmz). 
Thus the bundle E(m) we considered over pl(C) in IV-A is O(m). Consider ( 
a primitive m-th root of 1, and the lens space L2n+t(m) which is the quotient 
of S2n+1 by v IV (u. Making SI(= Sl/Z/m) act on L2n+1(m), we still get a 
principal bundle over pn(c). 
Exercise B.2.1 Show that in the last example the associated complex line bundle 
is O( -m). 
9This is actually what is called an associated bundle. 

Appendix: various notions of Euler classes 
149 
Conversely, given a complex line bundle E over a manifold B, the choice of a 
hermitian metric on E allows us to consider its circle bundle SeE), which is then 
a principal Sl-bundle over B (thanks to the linear Sl-action by rotations in the 
fibers). Of course we may recover E from SeE) as above. 
We now have to compare the Euler class of E as an oriented vector bundle and 
the Euler class of SeE) as a principal Sl-bundle. But we actually defined the class 
u E H2(pn(c);z) in such a way that e(O(-l» = -u (see A.4). By universality, 
we deduce that they coincide. 
Exercise B.2.2 Comparing 0(1) and 0(-1), check that u = e(O(l». 
B.2.3 
As a conclusion to this appendix, let us now check the assertion about 
multiplication by n which we ,!sed to define the Euler class in the nonprincipal case 
and in 2.4: 
The map z 1-+ zn induces multiplication by n on H2(BSl). 
Coming back to the previous examples, we see that we have to prove that the 
Euler class of O( n) is nu. On the other hand, as this only concerns H2, the assertion 
needs only be checked on PI(C). Consider thus the map 
C{): PI(C) -+ pi (C) 
[x,y] 
I---t [xn,yn] 
It has degree n, which means that it induces multiplication by n in the group H2. 
Moreover it is (almost) obvious that it satisfies C{)*0(1) ~ O(n). By naturality we 
thus have 
e(O(n» = C{)*e(O(l» = ne(O(l» = nu.

Chapter VI 
Torie manifolds 
This chapter is a kind of appendix to the rest of these notes: its goal is to present 
a very beautiful family of symplectic manifolds endowed with hamiltonian torus 
actions. 
These are the toric varietiesl introduced by Demazure and investigated since 
then by numerous authors2. These are algebraic varieties which can be defined over 
any field (of course we shall restrict to the field of complex numbers). The prototype 
is the closure of any orbit of a (complex) torus acting in a linear way on a projective 
space which we already met in III-4.4.1, but we shall present here an alternative 
description. 
The manifolds under consideration have properties which coincide a priori with 
those which we are interested in: 
• They are endowed with the action of a "big" torus (of maximal dimension: 
half that of the manifold) and with symplectic structures for which this action 
is hamiltonian. 
• They are constructed from something very close to a convex polyhedron, 
namely a [an (this is something allowing us to recover the combinatorics of the 
faces of a convex polyhedron, but not the size of the faces, see 2.1). Moreover, 
given an invariant line bundle, one can actually associate with these manifolds 
a convex polyhedron with integral vertices. 
• In the dimension 4 (complex 2) case they are described by graphs which look 
very much like some of the ones which appeared in chapter IV ... which is 
not surprising since we exhibited there all the 4-manifolds endowed with a 
hamiltonian action of the circle, a fortiori these endowed with hamiltonian 
T2-actions. 
After the publication of the convexity theorem (111-4.2.1), various authors hurried 
to remark that, in the case where the cohomology class of the symplectic form is 
1 It is to insist on the fact that we are mainly interested in the complex and smooth case that 
we used the word "manifold" in the title of the chapter. 
2There is a rather complete, but already a little out of date bibliography in [30) and a more 
recent one in [58). 
151 

152 
Toric manifolds 
the Euler class of a complex line bundle, the polyhedron image by the moment 
map was actually the one that was classically associated with the line bundle under 
consideration (see [44] and the proof by Khovanski and Arnold of 111-4.4.1 in [19] 
we already used). 
Here, we shall describe a complex toric varietr as the "quotient" of some CN by 
a complex subtorus of (C*)N. It is not necessary here to make precise the sense of 
the word "quotient", it will be the honest topological quotient of a big open subset 
of CN. According to a rather general idea of F. Kirwan, this quotient is identified 
to the symplectic reduction of some regular level of a moment map on CN. We thus 
meet a description due to T. Delzant, from which we deduce, as in [31] that with 
each (integral or not) convex polyhedron satisfying the necessary conditions implied 
by 111-4.2.5, we are able to associate a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 
double that of the polyhedron, the latter being the image of the moment map. 
This construction gives, in a very natural way, many of the classical results on the 
topology of these manifolds (simple connectivity, cohomology, invariant line bundles 
and symplectic forms). 
To stay in the spirit of chapter IV of these notes, we shall investigate more 
precisely the case of dimension 4, where it is almost obvious, using the results of 
the submentioned chapter, that given the image of the moment map, we are able to 
recover the whole diffeomorphism type of the manifold: in other words, a compact 
symplectic manifold of dimension 4 is endowed with a hamiltonian T2-action if and 
only if it is diffeomorphic to a complex toric surface. This is a special case of a result 
in [31] where the analogous statement for hamiltonian Tn-actions in dimension 2n 
is proven. 
It goes thus without saying that 1 claim no originality in this chapter4: there 
are ideas from [46] and [31], which 1 have chosen to describe here mainly because 
1 wanted to relate the topological aspects of the theory 1 enjoyed learning in the 
very beautiful paper by Danilov [30]. I enjoyed reading [28] as well, so I used it, 
especially in the description of fibrations and of surfaces.

and make these two groups act on CN:

the definition of Kc being left to the reader ... all these groups are now acting on 
eN as subgroups of Tg. Call k = N - n the dimension of K. 
Proposition 1.2.1 The points in the singular orbits of Kc in eN are the points 
in the el such that K ® en e7 =f O. 
Proof. 
We know that Z lies in a nonprincipal orbit of Kc if and only if there exists 
a (proper) subset I of indices in {I, ... , N} such that Z E el and Kc n Tl =f 1. 
Linearising the latter condition, we find that K ® e n fJ =f O •.• but this gives no 
information for exceptional orbits (case where Kc n T7 is a finite group). 0 
Example. Put N = n = 2 (and k = 0), and let 11" : Z2 -+ Z2 be the map with matrix 
(~ ~) in the canonical basis, in such a way that 11" itself is injective (K = 0) but its 
avatar T2 -+ T2 has nevertheless a nontrivial kernel K e!! {( e, e) Ie = ±1} C T2. In 
this case, Kc acts on e 2 without singular orbit, but the point (0,0) is an exceptional 
one. 
6Trying to economise on notation which is already very heavy we shall denote in the same way 
both the complex and real torus. No confusion is to be feared.

This is the biggest open subset in CN on which Kc acts without singular orbits. 
Remark. dimK = N - n = Ie, and if #7> n, K ® C n el =I- O. In U" there is 
therefore no coordinate subspace er such that #1 < Ie. 
Example. Let"": zn+l -+ zn be the map which sends the n first vectors ell' .. , en 
of the canonical basis on the vectors having the same names, representing the canon-
ical basis of zn and sending en+! on -( el + ... + en). K is the line generated by 
el + ... + en + en+! and K the diagonal torus (t, ... , t). Here U ... is Cn+1 - O. 
1.3 Real and imaginary parts 
If Tc is a complex torus and T the real torus which is its compact component, then 
tc = t ffi it, and we shall simply write the element g of Tc as g = Ie exp iX where 
Ie e T and X e 1. For example, if Tc = C*, then T = 8 1, t = iR and any element 
z e C* may be written z = ue"' where x e Rand u e 8 1•

Fans and toric varieties 
2.1 
Fans 
The idea one must have in mind is that a fan is what is left from a convex polyhedron 
when the "sizes" of its faces are forgotten. 
Figure 1 
Consider a convex polyhedron P in a vector space which we shall call E* because 
we actually want to work in the dual1 E. 
7 All the convex polyhedra we already met were indeed living in "dual spaces". 

Fans and toric varieties 
155 
With any face r we may associate its tangent cone: fix a point m in the (rela.tive) 
o 
interior of r (notation: mEr) a.nd define 
0'1' = U r· (P - m). 
r~O 
(see the picture in the middle of figure 1). The associated fan is the family I;(P) = 
{ ur } of the convex dual cones: 
u = {X E Elep(X) ~ 0 Vep E O'} 
Definition 2.1.1 A {an in Rn is a family I; of convex polyhedral cones in Rn having 
vertex 0, generated by integral vectors and such that 
1. any face of a cone in I; is a cone in I; 
2. the intersection of two cones in I; is a face in each of them. 
Remark. One may replace Rn by Qn in this definition: the important things are 
the vector space structure, allowing us to define cones, and (last but not least) the 
lattice zn. 
Exercise 2.1.2 The family of the convex dual cones associated with a convex 
polyhedron is indeed a fan. 
Example. 
Figure 1 shows (on the right) the fan associated with the simplex on 
the left (in the middle are the tangent convex cones). The dimension 1 cones are 
generated by the vectors Xl = e17 X2 = e2, and X3 = -(el + e2)' The fan contains 
the dimension 2 convex cones generated by (X17 X2), (X2, X3) and (X3, xt) as well. 
The union E(k) of all dimension k cones is the k-skeleton. The I-skeleton E(l) 
may (and actually will) be considered as the set of the N (primitive) vectors in zn 
which generate the half-lines which are the cones in E(l). 
In the example in figure 1, notice that the family of the dual convex cones, that 
is the fan defined by the polyhedron, covers the whole space. Remark also that this 
was not the case for the family of the tangent convex cones. We shall prove that 
this property is related with the compacity of the polyhedron, which will thus be 
read on the fan in a very convenient way. It is one of the reasons why people usually 
prefer to work with the fan instead using the family of tangent convex cones. 
Call support of the fan E the union lEI of all the cones. We say that a fan is 
complete if its support is the whole space Rn. 
Proposition 2.1.3 The convex polyhedron P is compact if and only if the fan I;(P) 
is complete. 

156 
Toric manifolds 
Proof The convex polyhedron P is compact if and only if its projection on any 
line is compact, and in particular if and only if for any X E E the map 
E* --+ 
R 
'(J 
1--+ '(J( X) 
sends P onto a compact interval. 
Considering - X as well, we thus see that P is compact if and only if 
"IX E E, 3a E R such that V'(J E P, '(J(X) ~ a. 
As P is a convex polyedron, a may be considered as the value at X of a linear form 
m on the (relative) interior of some face of P. Thus P is compact if and only if 
o 
"IX E E, 3r face of P and mEr such that V'(J E P, '(J(X) - m(X) ~ O. 
The last condition is equivalent to the existence for any X of a face r such that X 
is in the dual convex cone: the fan covers the whole space. 0 
2.2 
Closing a fan, open subsets in CN, toric varieties 
Given the fan E, choose a numbering of the primitive vectors generating E(l) 
E(l) = (Xl",.,XN) 
and consider the unique linear map 
11": ZN --+ Z" 
which sends the vectors (ell"" eN) of the canonical basis respectively onto the 
vectors (Xli"" X N) and assume that 11" ® Q is surjective (this will be the case for 
instance if E contains a dimension n cone). 
Denote (XI the cone generated by the vectors Xi (i E I): 
(XI = {alxi! + ... + arXirlaj ~ 0, I = {it, ... , ir }}. 
To the projection 11", we know how to associate an open subset U" in CN. Just 
as 11", the latter depends only on the I-skeleton of E. We now want to construct a 
sub-open subset UE of U" which will really depend on E. To this end, we make a 
restriction on the fans E we shall use: 
(1) 
(XI E E => el n K ® C = {OJ 
(there might perfectly well be cones (XI on some vectors in the I-skeleton which are 
not in E but satisfy the condition in (1». 
We can now define 
UE = C N -
U 
e/· 
{/1("'IttE} 
Condition (1) implies that UE C U", in particular that the complex subtorus Kc 
asociated with 11" acts on UE without singular orbits. 

Fans and toric varieties 
157 
Exercise 2.2.1 Show that the Kc-orbits in UE are closed and deduce that XE is 
Hausdorff. 
The quotient is then a space (actually a complex analytic space) XE whose 
singularities are not too complicated: at worst it is an orbifold and it has a finite 
branched covering which is smooth. Of course, without condition (1) singularities 
are more complicated. 
Definition 2.2.2 The space XE is the tork variety associated with ~. 
Remarks on condition (1). 
1. By definition, #1:::; 1 => (Xl E ~ and thus (xI rt ~ => dimel :::; N -2: in order 
to obtain UE, we removed from eN only some codimension ~ 2 subspaces. 
2. If ~' C ~ and if ~ satisfies (I), then ~' satifies it as well. 
3. As we assumed that 1r ® Q was surjective, then 
el n K ® e = {O} => #1 :::; n 
and therefore condition (1) implies that all the dimension n cones in E are 
simplicial, that is generated by n vectors. 
4. Condition (1) is implied by the condition 
(2) 
Each cone in E is generated by a part of some Z-basis. 
In fact let (Xl be a dimension h cone. Up to renumbering in E(1), we may 
assume that 1 = {I, ... , h}. Then 
= {Et=! oie;!1r(E Oiei) = 0 } 
= {Ei=! oie;!Eoixi = O} 
= o. 
Hence (XI E ~ => eI n K ® e = O. Condition (2) is actually equivalent to the 
smoothness of XE as the following proposition shows. 
Proposition 2.2.3 XE is smooth if and only if all dimension n cones in ~ are 
generated by a Z-basis of Z". 
Such a fan will be said smooth: hence a fan is smooth if and only if it satifies 
condition (2). 

158 
Tork manifolds 
Proof. XI; is smooth if and only if Kc has no finite stabilizer in UI;, in other words 
if and only if 
(Xr E E =* K n Tr = {I} 
but, as we assumed 'II" ® Q to be surjective, this is equivalent to 
(xrEEet#I=n=*KnTr={I} 
as well. But the torus K is the kernel of'll": RN /ZN -+ R"/Z". In other words, if 
K contains a nontrivial element, this means that there exists a nonintegral vector in 
QN the image of which lies in Z". Renumbering the xi's if necessary, assume that 
I = {I, ... , n}. Then K n Tr is a nontrivial finite group if and only if there exist 
relatively prime integers all ... ,an and m ;::: 2 such that . 
'II" (t ai e i) E zn. 
i=1 m 
This says that we have found a vector L aiXi de zn the "coordinates" of which 
are relatively prime and which is divisible: thus it is not written in a Z-basis. 0 
Exercise 2.2.4 Using 111-4.2.5, show that, in order that a dimension n convex 
polyhedron be the image under the moment map (of an effective Tn-action) of a 
2n-manifold, it is necessary that the associated fan is smooth. 
A convenient way to present UI; from the point of view of the Kc-bundle UI; -+ 
X I; might be the following: 
Lemma 2.2.5 Let UI = {z E C N I Zj = 0 =* j E I}. It is the product oJ#1 copies 
oj C* and oj #1 copies oj C and we have 
Proof. We may writeUI = eI X er' For any Z E CN, call I(z) C {I, ... ,N} the set 
of the indices of those coordinates which are zero (thus Z E UI(z»' We have 
and 
Z E el <=> 1 c I(z) 
z E UI; 
<=> (z E el =* (xJ E E) 
<=> (I c I(z) =* (XI E E) 
<=> 
(XI(z) E E 
so z E Ur, <=> (XI(z) E E <=> UI(z) CUI;. 0 
In the case of a smooth fan, and thus of a principal Kc-bundle UI; -+ XI;, the 
open subsets Ur of UE give local trivialisations of the bundle. 
Proposition 2.2.6 With each cone (Xl oj the smooth Jan E is associated an open 
subset XI oj the toric variety XI;, over which the principal Kc-bundle UI; -+ XI; is 
trivialised.

159 
Proof. Choose a basis of K. Let A be the matrix (with k columns and N rows) 
giving this basis in the canonical basis of C N • The torus K e acts on C N by 
(Ut, ••• , Uk) • (Zl> •.. , ZN) = (um1 Zl> ••• , Um"ZN) 
where um , is the monomial in the u;'s given by the multiexponent mi E Z" which is 
the i-th line of A. 
Consider this action on one of the open subsets UI we are interested in. Re-
mark first that the #I = n case is actually sufficient; as the fan is complete, 
any cone (xJ E E with #J < n is a face of a cone (XI E E with #I = nand 
then UJ CUI. Furthermore, we merely have to change the numbering of the 
vectors in the I-skeleton of E to be able to assume that I = {I, ... , n}. Then 
UI = {(ZI, ... , ZN) I Z,,+1 =I- 0, ... , ZN =I- O}. The fact that Ke then acts freely on UI 
corresponds to the fact that the k last rows8 of the matrix A give an invertible (over 
the integers) matrix. In other words, we can change the parmetrisation of ](e in 
such a way that the action is written: 
Denote (c/. homogeneous coordinates in the projective space) [Zb •.. , ZN] the 
element in XI: which represents the class of (Zl> ••• , ZN) E UI: modulo ](e. We can 
define a section 0'1 : Xl ~ UI to the projection UI ~ XI by 
(jI[Zt, . .• , ZN] = (~, ... ,..:i:., 1, ... ,1) 
ZI'I 
zl'" 
where Zl'i denotes the monomial in Z"H, ... ,Z"+,, associated with Pi E Z". A trivi-
alisation of the principal Ke-bundle over Xl is easily deduced:

The Tll' -action descends to quotients as a Tll' and even a Tll' / K e-action on 
XI:: the toric variety XI: is endowed with the action of a complex torus we shall 
denote Qe, the real torus it contains being denoted Q. A quick calculation gives 
dime XI: = dime Qe = n. 
Each cone (Xl in E thus defines an open subset XI in XI:. For example, the cone 
{O} = (xe defines U. = (C*)N = Tll' and X. = Tll' / Ke = Qe, which thus appears 
as an open dense subset in XI:. 
Examples. 
1. Take for (XI, ... , xn) the canonical basis of zn and let E be the set of all 
the cones (of the first octant). Then N = n, 7r = Id, K = 0, K = 1 and 
U" = UI: = UI:/ K = cn: the toric variety associated with the first octant fan 
is cn. 
8Recall that N = n + k. 

160 
Toric manifolds 
Figure 2 
2. With the same I-skeleton as in the previous example, define now 'E as the set 
of all the cones in the first octant except the n-dimensional one. Nothing has 
changed except UE from which we must take off e. = O. Hence XE = UE = 
0"-0. 
Figure 3 
3. Consider the fan on figure 3, that is the vectors Xi = ei (1 ~ i ~ n) and 
xn+! = -(Xl + ... + xn) and the fan in Rn consisting of all dimension ~ n 
cones on these vectors (at least if n = 2 we already saw that it is the fan 
associated with the standard simplex). Here UE = Cn+! - 0 and K is the 
diagonal Z i. e. the set (m, ... , m) E Z"+! and therefore K is the diagonal C* 
and XE is the complex projective space P"(C) (once again). 
4. As in figure 4, consider the fan in R2 the I-skeleton of which is (el, e2, -el, -e2) 
and the 2-skeleton of which consists of all cones {Xi,i+! (considering the num-
bering mod 4). Looking for the 1's such that {Xl ¢ 'E we find that 
UE = 0 4 -
({ Zl = Z3 = O} U {Z2 = Z4 = O}) 
and thus we actually get that UE = (C2 - 0) X (C2 - 0). The group K is 
0* x C* acting diagonally. The toric variety is the product Pl(C) X pI (C).

Figure 4 
5. UE depends only on the combinatorics of the fan. For instance, all the fans in 
R2 the I-skeleton of which consists of four vectors Xli X2, X3, X" and whose 2-
skeleton contains all the cones {Xi,i+! give the same UE = (C2 - 0) X (C2 - 0). 
In fact the torus Kc changes. Consider the case where Xl = el, X2 = e2, 
X3 = -et, X" = -el -
ae2 for some integer a (figure 4). The torus Kc acts 
this time by 
(U, v) . (ZII Z2, Z3, Z4) = (U"VZlI UZ2, VZ3, UZ4)' 
The toric variety XE we get this way is again a Hirzebruch surface (already 
met in chapter IV) as we shall prove in paragraph 5. 
6. Here is an example of a nonsmooth fan (figure 5). Working in Z2, the 1-
skeleton is Xl = ell X2 = el + 2e2' As the determinant of (Xli X2) equals 2, this 
is not a Z-basis.

Add now the cone generated by Xl and X2' Then UE = U" = C 2, and K = O.

The open set UE itself is a toric variety of dimension N, associated with the fan 
E obtained when "closing" E: E(l) = (el, ... , eN) and {eJ E E {:} {x J E E. In figure 
3, the reader can imagine the fan pictured on the right as being (in relief) in R3. 
By definition, E contains only cones of the first octant, moreover, as soon as 
N > n (which will allways be the case if E is complete), it contains no dimension 
N cone. In other words we then have Ur; C ON - O.

Fans, symplectic reduction, convex polyhedra 
In the penultimate example we considered above, we saw a new avatar of pn(o) 
written as the quotient of on+l - 0 by the action of 0* with the help of a fan. For 
this particular toric variety, we make the following observations: 
1. on+1 can be replaced by SZn+1 noticing that S2n+l xjO, +00[E! on+1 - O. 
2. The previous decomposition is compatible with that of 0* as the product 
SI xjO, +00[, and thus pn(o) is the quotient of S2n+1 by SI. 
3. Moreover, all this can be done in the hamiltonian framework: the sphere is 
a level manifold of a moment map and the projective space is its symplectic 
reduction. 
4. Of the action of the torus Tn+1 on on+1, there remains a (hamiltonian) Tn_ 
action on the projective space, for which the image of the moment map is the 
standard simplex in R n. •• polyhedron the associated fan of which is precisely 
the one we used to construct9 pn(o) as a toric variety! 
Of course, the aim of this section is to generalise the above remarks to all toric 
varieties.

taking values in t* = (RN)*. In the same way as t denotes the Lie algebra of the 
torus T, t denotes thatlO of the subtorus K. Dual to the inclusion J( C T, we shall 
use the projection p : t* -+ t*. 
The composed map 
is the moment map for the K-action on UE' 
The image of Jl is the first octant in t*, all the interior points are regular values. 
As p is linear and surjective, all the points in the image of the interior are regular 
values for Il' (and are actually values of Jl': to obtain UE we only removed some 
coordinates subs paces, hence all points in the interior of the first octant are in 
Jl(UE)). 
Actually, as the K-action on UE has no singular orbit, Jl'(UE) consists of regular 
values of Jl', it is an open subset in t*: the one which plays the analogous role to 
]0, +oo[ in the projective space example. 
The following proposition is a special case of a result of F. Kirwan ([46, theorem 
7.4]). The present proof is not very different from her proof of the general case. 
Proposition 3.1.1 Let", E Jl'(UE). Then the inclusion Jlt-1(",) C UE induces a 
homeomorphism Jlt-1(",)/K -+UdKc = XE. 
Thus, with each '1 in the open convex cone Jl'(UE) C t*, we associate, by sym-
plectic reduction of eN, a symplectic form w,., on the manifold XE • 
Proof of the proposition. Choose a metric on t* and consider the function f : 
eN -+ R which to z associates the real number IIJl' (z) - '1112. It is nonnegative and 
minimal on Jl'-l('1). Its derivative is given by T.f(X) = 2(Jl'(z) -",). T.,Jl'(X). 
In particular, as ", was chosen among the regular values of p.', the only critical 
points of f are those in p.'-I(",). Hence for any z E UE, the gradient trajectory 
descending from z will reach a point in Jl,-l('1)' 
Let us calculate this gradient: 
(grad.f, X) = 2 «Jl'(z) - '1),T .Jl'(X» 
= 2 (tT.Jl'(Jl'(z) - '1),X) 
lOU is actually a gothic k. 
2 (i",(z)_,.,. w, X) 
= 2w.(Jl'(z) - '1.' X) 
= -2i(p.'(z) -", ,X) 
• 

164 
Toric manifolds 
hence grad"f = -2i,,'(z) - fl., where of course we have used the metric to identify 
,,'(z) - fI with an element of t and underlinuing denotes as usual the fundamental 
associated vector field. Thus the gradient flow consists of exponentials of elements 
of it: this is the "imaginary part" ofthe torus Kc (the analogue of ]0, +001 in C*). 
In particular, any gradient trajectory is included in a Kc-orbit. From what 
we said before, we derive that each Kc-orbit meets ,,'-1('1). Let us now show 
that they meet along a unique K-orbit, that is to say that if z E 11'-1('1), then 
Kc . z n ,,'-1('1) = K . z. 
Assuming that 1I'(g . z) = " for some 9 E Kc we shall show that we then have 
9 . z = k . z for some k E K. As 11,-1(,,) is K-invariant, we may assume that 
9 = exp iX for some X E to We thus want to check that 9 . z = z. 
Consider the function h : R -+ R defined by h(t) = ,,'«expitX) . z) . X. We 
have h(O) = h(l) = '1.X and therefore h' must vanish between 0 and 1: 3to E [0,1] 
such that h'(to) = O. But 
h'(t) = T~I"(iK,)· X 
= 
w~(iX~,Xy) = ± IIX,f 
putting y = exp itX to save notations. For Yo = exp itoX, we thus have X I/O = 0 
and therefore exp itX fixes Yo and z. 0 
3.2 What is left from the Tg-action 
Fix any '1 as above in such a way that XI: is endowed with the symplectic form w". 
The action of the real torus Q is hamiltonian and the image of the moment map 
is the intersection P" of ,,(UI:) with the subspace parallel to q* whose image11 by 
p : t* -+ t* is fl. 
Using the fan E of Rn, we constructed a manifold XI:. Choosing an '1 gave us a 
convex polyhedron in (Rn)* = q*. Of course, we shall now prove: 
Proposition 3.2.1 E is the fan associated to any of the polyhedra P". 
Proof. Consider the exact sequences

with 71 E t*. Choose eo E t* such that p(eo) = 71, in order to consider P-l(71) as the 
subspace parallel to q* through eo. 
As 
1mI' = {Y': t -+ RIY'(ei) ;::: OVi} 
we find that 
P" = P-l(71) n 1m I' = {! E t*IY'(ei) ;::: OVi, Y'lt = eOI!}' 
To say that the restriction of 11' - eo to t vanishes is equivalent to saying that the 
(11' - eo, ei) depend only on the Xi = 1r(ei). In other words: 
P" = {t/J E q*It/J(Xi) ;::: eO(Xi)} 
and in particular the Xi E q are the directions of the dimension n - 1 faces of P" as 
they were the generators of the I-skeleton of~. The cones of P" are the intersections 
of P-l(71) with the coordinates cones (el in I'(UI:), in other words with the el such 
that (XI E~. 0

t* of P", the compacity of the curve will follow as we shall see in 4.1. As it is endowed 
with an action of the torus Qc, it is a Pl(C). This is the sphere which is sent onto 
the edge of P" under consideration as in exercise V-6.2.1. Its stabilizer in Qc 
corresponds to the orthogonal (in q) of the edge we are dealing with in q*. 
Similarly, the dimension n cones of ~ correspond to the fixed points of the Qc-
action on XI:.

Properties of the toric manifolds XI: 
We shall describe in terms of ~ some of the properties of the manifolds we have 
constructed. 
4.1 
Compacity of XI; 
We expressed XI; = 1"-l(71)/K where K was a compact group. For XI; to be 
compact, it is thus necessary (and sufficient) that 1"-1(71) is. 
On the other hand, 1"-1(71) = 1'-I(p-l(71» and it is clear that I' is proper. 
We need thus only know when p-I (71) n 1m (I') is compact, but it is precisely the 
polyhedron under consideration. We have therefore proved: 
Proposition 4.1.1 XI; is compact if and only if one of the polyhedra P" is compact.

If E is smooth and complete, we have thus constructed a (smooth and) compact 
manifold XI:, of (real) dimension 2n, endowed with an action of a torus Q of dimen-
sion n and a family of invariant symplectic forms giving moment maps and convex 
polyhedra. 
Conversely, notice that any dimension n convex polyhedron P the fan of which 
is smooth and complete (that is to say that P is compact and that its dimension 
n cones are generated by Z-bases), allows us to construct such a manifold with, 
moreover, an invariant symplectic form: write P as the intersection of the;;:: 0 cone 
in RN (N is the number of codimension 1 faces in P) with a suitable affine subspace, 
giving a value of TJ using which we can make the symplectic reduction as above. 
We shall now prove that all the de Rham cohomology classes containing invariant 
symplectic forms may be obtained this way. Once again it is very easy. We first 
have 
Proposition 4.2.1 The toric variety XI: is simply connected and the principal Kc-
bundle UI: -+ XI: defines a map 
H2(BK; Z) --+ H2(XI:; Z) 
which is an isomorphism. 
In other words, the Euler class of this principal Kc-bundle (which lives in 
H2(XI:; Z)k where k = dim K, see V-2.4) is a Z-basis of H2(XI:; Z). 
Proof. 
In order to construct UI:, we removed from cn some vector subspaces, but 
no hyperplane. Thus, UI: is 2-connected, and UI: -+ XI: may be used as a principal 
K-bundle, universal up to dimension 2 (see [15]). 0 
Corollary 4.2.2 ([31]) The map from the convex open cone /-I'(UI:) of t* to the 
vector space H2(XI:; R), which associates with" the cohomology class of W,,' may be 
extended as an affine isomorphism 
t* --+ H2(XI:; R) 
Proof. 
The convex open cone p.'(UI:) generates t* by definition. Moreover, the map 
" t-+ [w,,] is affine according to the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem (see V-3.2.2), thus 
there is no difficulty to extend it as an affine map 
t* --+ H2(XI:iR). 
It suffices now to apply the previous proposition together with V-3.2.2 to see that 
the "slope" of this map is given by a Z-basis of H2(XI:; Z). It therefore cannot avoid 
being a diffeomorphism. 0

4.3 Integral polyhedra and invariant line bundles 
Classically, algebraic geometers are able to associate a convex polyhedron with the 
toric variety XI:, endowed with an invariant (complex) line bundlel2 The polyhedron 
is integral, namely its vertices lie in the integral lattice of q*. 
We did just something similar, associating a convex (but not necessarily integral) 
polyhedron with each invariant symplectic form, in particular with any element of 
a convex open cone in H2(XI:; R). 
Let us now investigate the relationship between these two constructions, showing 
that the "real" one is an interpolation of the integral one. To this end, we begin by 
understanding the invariant complex line bundles. 
Let 9 : Rn --4 R be a map satisfying the two properties: 
1. It is the restriction of a linear map on each of the cones in E. 
2. It takes integral values on IE I n zn. 
Remark. This is equivalent to requiring that 9 is the projection of a linear map, 
still denoted 9 : ZN --4 Z. We shall consider 9 sometimes as one and sometimes as 
the other. 
With such a map, we associate a fan Eg in Rn+1 = Rn x R which is more or less 
the graph of 9 on E: 
1. Put x~ = (x"g(x,» for 1:5 i:5 Nand xN+1 = (0,1), this defining E~l) from 
E(l). 
2. More generally, we accept a cone {xI as a member of Eg when (and only when) 
{ 
N+lf/.I 
I=JU{N+l} 
and 
and 
Proposition 4.3.1 The toric variety XI:g is smooth if and only if XI: is. It is 
endowed with a natural map 
XI:g --4 XI: 
which makes it a complex line bundle over XI:' 
Proof. The former assertion is obvious, taking into account the characterisation of 
smooth toric varieties by their fans in 2.2.3. 
To prove the latter, consider carefully the open subset UI:g of eN+!: 
UI:. = eN+! -

Let us now construct the complex torus K' associated with the situation of Eg: 
o ~ 
K' ~ 
ZN X z~zn X Z 
where 1r'(a, b) = (1r(a),g(a) + b), that is K' = {(a, b) 11r(a) = Oet b = -g(a)} and 
the map

K'

image of Kc by the restriction of 
T~ --
T~xC* 
t 
1--+ (t,9'(t)-1) 
where 9' is the multiplicative avatar of the linear map g. In other words, the Kb-
action on UE g may be identified with that of Kc on UE x C by 
t· (x,y) = (t. x,g(t)-1y). 
Taking quotients of both sides gives the announced line bundle. 
UE g =UE xC

Example. In the case where E is the fan describing pn(c), if we define 9 : Zn+I -+ 
Z by g(ei) = 0 for 1 5 i 5 nand g(en+1) = m, we get the bundle O( -m) (see V-B). 
For n = 1, figure 6 shows the bundle O( -1) over pI (C).

Remark. If 9 is already a linear map onZ", the bundle obtained is trivial. Indeed, 
notice first that the bundle associated with 9 = 0 is (the torus I<b does not act on 
the factor C in this case). Then, for 9 E (Z")*, define 9 : Z" x Z -4 zn X Z by 
(a, b) I-t (a, b + g( a» and remark that the map 9 defines an isomorphism from Eo 
onto Eg and thus an isomorphism from XI:o onto XI:. over XI:. 
We may thus consider that we have defined a map 9 I-t XI;. from the set of all 
linear maps ZN -4 Z (modulo those zn -4 Z) into the set of isomorphism classes of 
Q-invariant complex line bundles over XI;. 
The former is (ZN)*/(Z")* ... in other words K*. As to the latter, and although 
we did not require any analyticity, we might call it PicQ(Xr:). 
The map in question is a morphism of groups; if g1, g2 E (ZN)*, the group J(c 
acts on UI: xC 
• using g1 by t '1 (x, y) = (t. X,g1(t)-1 y), 
• using g2 by t'2 (x,y) = (t. x,g2(t)-1 y), 
• and using g1 +g2 by t .(x,y) = (t 'X,(g1(t)g2(t»-1 y), which corespond to the 
tensor product of line bundles (this is where the group structure on PicQ(XI;) 
comes from). 
Composing with the Euler class, we get a group morphism 
Proposition 4.3.2 The morphism K* -4 H2(XI;i Z) is an isomorphism and may 
be extended as the isomorphism t* -4 H2(XI;; R) of 4.2.2 (given by symplectic re-
duction). 
Remark. Because XI; is simply connected, we have H2(XI;i Z) C H2(XI;; Z) ®R ~ 
H2(XI;; R), and we consider of course K* as the integral lattice in !* (this gives the 
meaning of the word "extend" in the statement). 

170 
Toric manifolds 
Proof. 
We already have a Z-basis of H2(XI:;Z) (see 4.2.1). Once a basis of K is 
chosen, we may write the torus Kc as a product of k factors C* and it is easily 
shown that K* .... H2(XI:; Z) is an isomorphism, making the nice 
Exercise 4.3.3 Let (ft, ... , fll) be a basis of K and (gt. ... , gil) be the dual basis 
in K*. For any i e [1, k], define a fan E; in Rn+1 by decomposing the projection 
11' : ZN ~ Zn+I .... zn 
in such a way that Ker1l'; = K/(Z. f;) and that E; has the same combinatorics as 
-
N 
E and E, thus UI:; = UI: C C . 
Show that the projection zn+1 .... zn induces a principal C*-bundle XI:; .... XI:. 
Comparing UI:; and UI:.; C CN+1, show that XI:; . is the complement of the zero 
section in XI:.;' 
Thus the element g. in the basis of K* we consider is sent to. the Euler class of 
the i-th principal C*-bundle forming the principal Kc-bundle UI: .... XI: and the 
homomorphism in question is actually an isomorphism over Z. 
Let us come now to our main subject of interest, namely the interpolation 
statement. The most important tool in the proof is our old friend, the I-form 
a = t E(Pidqi - qidp.) on C N • In addition to being a primitive of the symplectk 
form of C N , it satisfies: 
If 9 e t* and X e t, then, on 1-'-I(g), we have ix.a = g(X) 
from which we immediately deduce that if I] e t* and Yet, then, on 1-"-1(1]), 
ira = I](Y). 
Let 9 be an integral element in t* and I] = glt e t* be its projection, such 
that I] e I-"(UE ). Call u (= dz/z) the volume form on 8 1• Consider the principal 
8 1-bundle which is the circle bundle of XI: ..... X E: 
(the vertical arrows are the quotients by the dimension k compact tori K', K). 
On 1-"-1 (I]) x 81, a ffi u is a connection I-form for the trivial bundle represented 
by the upper horizontal arrow. The torus K' acts on 1-"-1(1]) X 8 1 with fundamental 
vector fields (Y, -I](Y)); in particular, 
and therefore affiu descends to the quotient and gives a I-form of connection on X Eg • 
Its curvature form, the cohomology class of which is the Euler class of XE ..... XE, 
is the reduced symplectic form w". 0

Corollary 4.3.4 Assume E is smooth and complete. Let Ui be the Euler class of 
the complex line bundle over XI; which is associated with et E (ZN)*. The group

4.4 
The cohomology of XI; 
Let us begin with an exercise: 
Exercise 4.4.1 Using a well chosen Morse function on XI;, show that the ring 
H*(XI;; Z) is generated by its degree 2 elements (see [30)). If XI; is simplicial, but 
not smooth, this is still true with rational cohomology. 
The ring Z[U}, ... , UN] (with the same notations as in corollary 4.3.4) may be 
interpreted as the ring H*(BT; Z). The linear forms 2:~1 g( ei)ui (for g E (Z")*) 
in question in this statement thus describe a system of generators for the ideal I, 
kernel of the restriction H*BT -t H*BK. 
From this exercise and the previous statements we deduce: 
Corollary 4.4.2 If:E is smooth and complete, the composition 
H*(BT; Z) --+ H*(BK; Z) --+ H*(XI;; Z) 
is a surjective ring homomorphism. 0 
Thus when the variety XI: is smooth and compact, H*(XI;; Z) is a ring of poly-
nomials. More precisely: 
Theorem 4.4.3 H*(XI:; Z) ~ Z[Ub ... , UN]/(I + J), where I is the ideal generated 
by the linear relations (2: g( ei)ui = O)ge(z,,)* and J that generated by the monomials 
uI such that (XI ¢ :E. 
There is a proof of this theorem in [30]. In 5.2, we shall give a complete proof 
in the case of surfaces (n = 2). In the next exercise, we give some hints for a proof 
having the two following advantages: 
1. It shows the respective roles of the two ideals I and J. 
2. It uses the construction UI: -t XI; and computes the equivRriant cohomology 
of XI: with respect to the action of its big torus. 
Assuming :E smooth and complete, the cohomology is with integral coefficients.

{xJ ¢ E. Check that the torsion H* BT-module H* BT / J has the same support 
as H1UI;. 
4. We-said in V-5.3.6 that HQXI; is the free H*BQ-module generated by H*XI;. 
On the other hand, it is easy to check, using the spectral sequence of the fibra-
tion ET XT UI; -+ BT, that H* BT -+ H1UI; is a surjective homomorphism. 
Using these two results, show that H* BT -+ HQXI; is actually the quotient 
H* BT -+ H* BT / J and deduce the theorem.

Complex toric surfaces 
5.1 
Graphs associated with dimension 2 fans 
In dimension 2, a fan is well defined once we know its I-skeleton, and thus is given 
by a family of N primitive vectors (Xl, .•. , X N) of Z2 (indices are considered as if 
in Z/N) such that all the (Xi-I, Xi) are Z-bases with the same orientation. The 
dimension 2 cones are then the {Xi-l,i. 
Writing the direct basis (Xi+!' Xi) in terms of the direct basis (Xi, xi-d, notice 
that 
Xi+! = -Xi-l + miXi 
for some integer mi. To give a fan is thus equivalent to give the integers (ml! ..• ,mN)' 
The graph consisting of the polygon with N vertices weighted by ml, •.• , mN in the 
same order gives the fan back. In order that such a graph defines a fan, the integers 
in question must satisfy two conditions 
• On the one hand, the equality 
( mIl) (m2 1) ... (mN 1) = (1 0) 
-1 0 
-1 0 
-1 0 
0 1 
in order that the fan closes up, that is that (x N, Xl) is a direct Z-basis.

• On the other hand, during this operation, we are not allowed to turn around 
twice (or more). 
In the graph, any vertex now represents some PI(C) and any edge corresponds 
to a fixed point of the action of the big torus Qc, intersection of two such pi (C).

Figure 7 shows the weighted graphs associated respectively to P2(C), pi (C) X

point as the reader will see when solving the next exercise.

show that Kb = Kc X C* acts on CN+! by 
and deduce that q induces a map 
which is the blow-up of the fixed point of Qc associated with the cone (XN,l in ~. 
Remark. It is possible to show (see [58]) that all the smooth compact complex 
toric surfaces are obtained by a finite sequence of blow-ups, starting with P2(C) or 
with a Hirzebruch surface. 
5.2 Interpretation of the mi 
Let ~i be the fan consisting of all the cones in ~ generated by Xi-l! Xi and Xi+!. 
According to the study of the line bundles in 4.3, we know that the manifold XE, is 
the total space of a complex line bundle over Pl(C), the one which has Euler class 
-mi· 
Figure 8 
The inclusion e: n UE.! Kc CUE.! Kc c XE thus presents XE, as a tubular 
neighborhood of the curve in XE which is associated with the cone (Xi. This complex 
curve carries a homology class dual to Ui (notation of 4.3.4). 
For example, the fan on figure 4 represents the toric surface obtained by gluing 
the total spaces of the line bundles O(a) and O( -a) over Pl(C). It is the Hirzebruch 
surface P(O(a) ESl). 

Complex toric surfaces 
175 
So the formal analogy between the plumbing diagrams in IV-B and the graph 
associated with a fan here is not accidental: 
Proposition 5.2.1 The manifold plumbed along the weighted graph r is an open 
subset of the toric surface associated with the same graph. 0 
We noticed in IV-B that the polygonal graphs we consider here also represent 
plumbed manifolds which can be endowed with actions of dimension 2 tori. It 
is nevertheless recommended to be careful with identifying the closed manifolds 
obtained: they are all obtained by gluing a T2 x R2 to the same manifold with 
boundary in both cases, but not with the same gluing map. The manifold in chapter 
IV allways has a nontrivial fundamental group, its second Betti number is Nand 
it has no invariant symplectic form, on the contrary the toric manifold we consider 
here is simply connected, its second Betti number is N - 2 and it has plenty of 
invariant symplectic forms. 
Investigating the multiplicative structure of H*(XE; Z), taking corollary 4.3.4 
and the above remarks into account, we easily obtain a proof of 4.4.3 in the case of 
surfaces, namely: 
Proposition 5.2.2 H*(XE; Z) Sl! Z[Uh'" ,uNl/(I + J), where I is the ideal gen-
erated by the linear relations (Eg(ei)ui = O)ge(Z2)* and J the one generated by the 
monomials uI such that (XI f/. E. 
Remark. 
J is generated here by the degree> 4 monomials and the UiUj where i 
and j are not consecutive mod N. 
Proof. 
Taking into account the structure of H2(XE; Z) and the obvious incidence 
relations between the curves dual to the Ui, we have a surjective morphism 
In order to be sure that this is an isomorphism, it suffices to calculate the degree 
4 parts of both rings. On the right, we know that H4(XE; Z) Sl! Z and that any 
of the products UiUi+1 may be chosen as a generator (the curves associated with Ui 
and Ui+! meet at +1 point). Let us thus show that, in the ring on the left, we have 
Ui-IUi = UjUi+1 for any i. Fix i E [1, Nj, then (Xi-b Xi) is a basis of Z2 and the 
projection ZN --+ Z2 has matrix 
(where Xj = ajXi_1 + bjXi) and therefore 
{ fl = 
alei + ... + ai-2et_2 + eLl -

form a basis of (Z2)* C (ZN)*. The ideal I is thus generated by the two elements

V2 = 
bl til + ... + bj_ 2t1j_2 + tlj + mjtlj+1 + bj+2t1i+2 + ... + bNtlN 
in particular tljVl = 0 that is tlj_ltlj -
tljtlj+1 = 0, and this is what we wanted to 
prove. Moreover tljV2 = 0 gives us tl1 = -mitlitli+1' this means that -mi is actually 
the self-intersection number of the curve corresponding to the cone (Xi, as we must 
find, as it is the Euler class13 of the normal bundle of this curve. 0 
5.3 4-manifolds with hamiltonian T2-actions 
Proposition 5.3.1 ([31]) A compact symplectic 4-manifold W may be endowed 
with a hamiltonian T2-action if and only if its T2-eqtlivariant diffeomorphism type 
is that of a complex toric surface. 
More generally in [31] dimension 2n symplectic manifolds endowed with hamil-
tonian Tn-actions are considered. The proof of this special case is very easy and in 
the "low dimensions" spirit of chapter IV. 
Proof. 
As always callp the moment map and consider the image polyhedron p(W). 
Choose a rational direction of projection which is orthogonal to some edge (to make 
things simpler). In other words, choose a circle 8 1 C T2 with a fixed sphere. The 
associated hamiltonian H is the function (p, X), where X generates the Lie algebra 
of the circle under consideration. Replacing X be -X if need be, we may assume 
that the fixed sphere is the minimum of H. 
The complement of an equivariant tubular neighborhood of the maximum of H 
is then the manifold plumbed along a star-shaped graph with two branches. We may 
easily reconstruct a T2-action on this plumbing: the circle 8 1 we are dealing with 
is a direct summand in T2 and we require that some supplement fixes the sphere 
Emin , this being enough to define the action everywhere. We still must compactify, 
which is done by addition of either a vertex if the maximum is reached on a sphere 
or an edge otherwise. The graph thus obtained is actually the one associated with a 
fan as it comes from the convex polyhedron which is the image of the moment map 
p. 0
