Density Matrix
Leslie Ballentine
A matrix representation of the  state operator. So named because in the posi-
tion basis its diagonal elements are equal to the position probability density. This
name is older than the modern term state operator, and is still frequently used in
its place, especially in many-electron theory and  quantum chemistry. The name
density matrix is not entirely accurate, since in the position basis it is not really
a matrix, but rather a function of two continuous variables. If a discrete basis is
chosen (such as the spin basis), then it becomes a genuine matrix, but its diagonal
elements are probabilities rather than densities.  States, pure and mixed, and their
representation.
Density Operator
Werner Stulpe
Density operator, an operator used to describe (mixed) quantum states. A density
operator [1–6], also called statistical operator or – somehow misleading – density
matrix, is a positive trace-class  operator ρ of trace 1 acting in some separable
complex  Hilbert space H; i.e., ρ is a linear operator deﬁned on H with values in
H that satisﬁes ρ = ρ∗, ⟨φ|ρφ⟩⩾0 for all φ ∈H, and tr ρ = 
i⟨φi|ρφi⟩= 1,
φ1, φ2, . . . being a complete orthonormal system in H. In particular, ρ is a com-
pact self-adjoint  operator; in consequence, a density operator has the spectral
decomposition ρ = 
i λiPχi ( self-adjoint operator) where λ1, λ2, . . . are the
nonzero eigenvalues of ρ, counted according to their multiplicity and arranged
according to λ1 ⩾λ2 ⩾. . . > 0, 
i λi = 1, χ1, χ2, . . . is an orthonormal system
