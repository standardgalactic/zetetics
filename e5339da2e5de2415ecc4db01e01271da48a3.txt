Simple formulation of the bias
torque on the balance in E-W position is due to gx North component
gx must be integrated over sample volume to get the total force
and torque
linear vertical variation gx(z) = gxzz ensures constant force for cylinders
nonlinear vertical variation gx(z) = gxzz + gxzzz2 breaks constancy
easy calculation shows sample height H dependence of arm rotation v:

Magnitude of the gravity gradient bias
bias in the equivalence parameter η depends on both
sample shape (H) and gradient nonlinearity (gxzz):
ηbias = −
gxzz
12G sin ϵ(H2 −H′2)
more accurate calculation gives radius R dependence as
well: H2/12 −R2/4
sample geometry is known in the EPF experiment
gravity ﬁeld or its time variation is unknown

Guessing the gravity gradient bias
ηbias = −
gxzz
12G sin ϵ(H2 −H′2)
gxzz can be guessed from mass modeling
G sin ϵ is 1.69 mGal
H2 differences are known - e.g. Pt-Magnalium: 106 cm2

the EPF measurement:

gxzz may easily reach

What else can be said on this possible bias?
Nobody knows precisely neither gravity nor its spatial and
temporal variations at the EPF measurement site(s)
Unfortunately this hypothesis does not explain the
correlation found by Fischbach et al., but...
..but we can make a very interesting observation knowing
the details of the different experimental protocols followed
by EPF
Tóth, Gy., Szondy, Gy., Ván, P., Völgyesi, L. et al.
Remeasurement of the Eötvös experiment

Experimental protocols of EPF
their published results were obtained initially with Method 2
and later with their reﬁned Method 3
Method 2: one balance only, sample pairs were measured
subsequently
Method 3: two balances of a double balance, sample pairs
were measured simultaneously
Principal difference: temporal gravity ﬁeld variation may
have signiﬁcantly biased Method 2, but not Method 3
Observation: Temporal gravity ﬁeld variation can make the
sample geometry effect invisible in Method 2 but this is not
the case for Method 3
Conclusion: If our hypothesis is true, we must see the
sample geometry effect in Method 3 results but we may not
see this effect in Method 2 results
Question: Do we actually see this difference in the EPF
results?

Source multipole moments vs. EPF results
qlm multipole moments of the balance were calculated
main shape effect is linearly dependent on the ∆q31/q31
moment ratio between the samples
there is no dependence for Method 2 results, but we can see
linear ﬁt between error bars for Method 3 results
details are in arXiv:1803.04720 and paper under review in EPJC

Consequences for the EPF remeasurement
shape bias can be controlled by keeping the difference
H2/12 −R2/4 constant
we use masses in our tests which obey this rule
shape bias can be checked by breaking the above rule
we plan to use masses which break this rule to see the
effect
any remeasurement must keep gravity gradient bias under
control

Challenges
even if we do not aim "record precision" with our balance,
we face the following challenges:
jump-like rotation changes by the load of torsion wire
sensitivity of the balance to vibrations
atmospheric air pressure inﬂuence
high accuracy determination of balance beam orientation
Tóth, Gy., Szondy, Gy., Ván, P., Völgyesi, L. et al.

Wire drift and puzzling correlation
Initial quadratic drift is 0.01 div/h but becomes almost linear after
1 day and decreases to 0.005 div/h (2 µrad/h) and below
drift corrected residuals show marked (anti)correlation that
puzzled us for a long time

Sensitivity of the balance to vibrations of the
suspension point

paper by Karagioz et al. (1975)
"dumb-bell effect": simple pendulum oscillation can apply
torques to the torsion mode of the pendulum
physical mechanism: reduction of the kinetic energy by the lining
up of the dumb-bell with the axis of rotation

Torsion balances for operational earthquake
forecasting
The effect of the reaction of a gravitational variometer (GV)
on vibrations due to seismic activity was discovered at the
end of 1970’s practically by chance at Russia (Volfson et
al. 2010)
The GV’s response was observed in case of an extremely
remote signal source, as a rule, several tens of hours
before a cataclysm (Kalinnikov et al., 1992)
The balance tends to the maximally possible energy
absorption during resonant reciprocating horizontal motion
of the top of the suspension (Kalinnikov, 1990).
At the end of the 1980’s, 18 pairs of GVs were mounted at
7 seismic stations of Kazakhstan and their records were
ﬁxed on a continuous basis for the past 15 years
(Khaidarov et al., 2003)
