SUMMARY
1. Estimating accurate age-speciﬁc survival probabilities and understanding the processes (density
dependent or independent) that regulate this demographic parameter are fundamental to propose
sustainable management options for the endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla).
2. In the present study, we used extensive mark-recapture data sets (13 and 17 years) on eel
>150 mm to estimate accurate natural survival probabilities of two eel sub-populations, from the Oir
and Fremur rivers, western France, and then we analysed survival probabilities in relation to
density-independent (temperature) and density-dependent factors to identify those causing survival
variability.
3. The Fremur and Oir rivers are two small (<100 km2) river systems in close proximity (65 km
apart). The Fremur River is a small river obstructed by dams with medium water quality, high eel
recruitment and density (0.37 eel m2), and a male dominant population; whereas, in the Oir River,
low densities of eels were observed (0.04 eel m2) and the sex ratio was skewed towards females.
Furthermore, previous research suggested that the lotic habitats of the Fremur River have reached
carrying capacity, whereas habitats in the Oir River are below habitat saturation.
4. In the Fremur River, there were signiﬁcant spatial and temporal variations in the survival
probabilities. However, survival probabilities observed in the Oir River were stable over time and
space. The results highlight that the differences in the characteristics of the two systems and the two
sub-populations prompt different responses to regulatory processes.
5. The contrasting pressures applied on these two sub-populations impact survival, which possibly
lead to different life history strategies such as sex differentiation.

Introduction
Estimates of accurate demographic parameters such as
age-speciﬁc survival are fundamental to propose suitable
sustainable environmental management methods, espe-
cially for endangered species (Caswell, 2000). The esti-
mation of demographic parameters and identiﬁcation of
the processes that inﬂuence these parameters may help
predict the future dynamics of populations in the face of
environmental changes and anthropogenic pressures.
The factors inﬂuencing demographic parameters can be
classiﬁed into two groups: density-independent (water
ﬂow, temperature, pollutants, dams, etc.) and density-
dependent (essentially competition) factors. For the lat-

ter, the effects on the size or growth of a population
vary with the density of the population itself (Williams,
Nichols & Conroy, 2002).
In ﬁsh populations, density-independent factors could
act through direct or indirect effects. For example, some
studies highlighted that temperature causes both an
increase (by hastening body growth and reducing the
duration of the freshwater phase at the optimum tem-
perature; Vøllestad, 1992; Angilletta & Dunham, 2003)
and a decrease (directly from the critical thermal tem-
perature at which the ﬁsh dies) of survival. The effect of
density dependence on demographic parameters could
strongly regulate a population by decreasing survival,
fecundity, and growth rates and; therefore, understand-
ing density-dependent processes is crucial for practical
applications such as conservation and harvest regula-
tions (Hanski, Foley & Hassell, 1996; Sinclair & Pech,
1996; Drake, 2005). These processes are particularly
important for populations when the system is near car-
rying capacity (deﬁned as the maximum density or bio-
mass that a habitat can sustain; Van Gils et al., 2004) as
limited resources (habitat or/and food) could result in
enhanced
intra-speciﬁc
competition
reducing
growth
and survival. However, these processes are often difﬁ-
cult to highlight as long-term data sets are required.
European eels (Anguilla anguilla) are catadromous,
semelparous ﬁsh reproducing in the open ocean and
spending most of their life in continental waters from
recruits (glass eels or elvers) that colonise water courses
until sub-adult silver eels that migrate back to the repro-
ductive grounds in the Sargasso Sea (Tesch, 2003). In
recent
decades,
the
European
eel
population
has
declined drastically and the current glass eel recruitment
has reached only 10% of the reference 1960–1979 period
(ICES WGEEL, 2013). As a result, this species was listed
as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List (Jacoby &
Gollock, 2014). The European Commission has initiated
an Eel Recovery Plan (Council Regulation no. 1100/
2007) in an attempt to reduce anthropogenic mortality
and maximise silver eel output from catchments. Stock-
ing of juvenile eels to under-stock waterways has been
identiﬁed as a method to increase spawning stock bio-
mass (Josset et al., 2015). However, identifying areas
where stocking will be most successful and have the
highest net beneﬁt requires a comprehensive under-
standing of the factors inﬂuencing eel survival rates dur-
ing the successive eel life stages.
Natural survival of eels is a major, but relatively
unknown, factor in the population dynamics of eels. In a
recent study, Bevacqua et al. (2010) applied principles of
metabolic theory, which linked natural survival to body
mass and temperature, to estimate natural survival of
the European eel. They ﬁrst highlighted that eels inhab-
iting warm waters are potentially subject to a markedly
lower survival as temperature accelerates all metabolic
processes, therefore shortening the lifespan. Secondly, at
a given temperature, the survival of a high-density eel
stock is about three times lower than that of a low-
density one (Bevacqua et al., 2010), which is consistent
with others local studies (e.g., Vollestad and Jonsson,
1988; De Leo & Gatto, 1996; Lobon-Cervia & Iglesias,
2008). Thus, eel survival can be inﬂuenced in complex
ways by both density-dependent and -independent pro-
cesses (Noth, Francis & Jellyman, 2008; Bevacqua et al.,
2010, 2011) but further studies are still needed to disentan-
gle the factors inﬂuencing eel survival in different envi-
ronments (Knights, 2003). Furthermore, the regulation
processes (density-independent or -dependent) could be
different depending on the age and/or size of the
individuals. For example, the diet of European eels shifts
with increasing ﬁsh proportion as their size increases
(Cucherousset et al., 2011), suggesting that intra-speciﬁc
competition for food could be size speciﬁc. It is therefore
necessary to estimate age/size-speciﬁc survival to deter-
mine at which stage these processes regulate the popula-
tion. Some studies highlighted that survival increases
with age (De Leo & Gatto, 1995, 1996: age-speciﬁc annual
mortality [1–15 years]; Lobon-Cervia & Iglesias, 2008:
cohort mortality and from age 2 to 4 mortality). However,
when age-data were unavailable or unreliable, studies
demonstrated that mortality also varied with size (Nai-
smith & Knights, 1990; Bisgaard & Pedersen, 1991).
In the current study, we analysed spatio-temporal
variations in natural survival probabilities of two eel
sub-populations in relation to density-independent (tem-
perature, water ﬂow) and -dependent factors. We used
an extensive mark-recapture data set (13 and 17 years),
on eels >150 mm, from sub-populations of the European
eel in two small (<100 km2) river systems of Western
France: Fremur (Brittany) and Oir (Normandy) rivers. In
both sites, there was no commercial eel ﬁshery, anglers
did not target European eels, and, there were few cor-
morants and herons. Therefore, ﬁshing pressure and
predation mortality were negligible, and survival pro-
vided hereafter consisted of natural survival. Multistate
capture recapture models were developed to estimate
annual survival probabilities of ﬁve different stages (de-
pending on sexual maturation and size: yellow eels with
a size >300 mm, yellow eels between 301 and 450 mm,
yellow eels with a size >451 mm, and resident and
migratory silver eels) in each system. Both sites are in
close proximity (65 km apart) and are affected by similar

regional environmental conditions (water temperature,
hydrology, etc.). However, they differ in water quality,
ﬁsh population, and eel population structure (density,
recruitment, and sex ratio). In addition to these differ-
ences, differences in the inherent habitat carrying capac-
ity of each system are suspected. Previous research
suggested that the lotic habitats of the Fremur River
have
reached
carrying
capacity
(Acou
et al.,
2011)
whereas the Oir River is possibly below habitat satura-
tion. Considering the close proximity of the two systems
and the important difference in population structure
(density, recruitment, sex ratio), we expected higher eel
survival in the low-density Oir River than in the higher-
density Fremur River linked to density-dependent pro-
cesses.
Methods
Study areas
The Fremur and Oir rivers are typical of the numerous
small river systems in Western Europe. The Fremur is a
small and low-gradient coastal river in Northern Brittany,
which discharges into the English Channel near Saint
Malo (2°060W, 48°340N; Fig. 1). The catchment area is
approximately 60 km2, and the distance from source to
mouth is 46 km, with a 17 km main stem. The gradient
ranges from 2% at the source (100 m altitude) to 0.1% near
the mouth. Overall, the Fremur River provides a wide
range of shallow (mean  SD = 0.5  0.2 m) and narrow
(2.2  0.9 m) habitats, from turbulent headwater streams
with trout to lowland reaches downstream characteristic
of bream habitats, together with lentic reservoirs. At
roughly the same latitude (1°160W, 48°370N), 60 km east-
ward, the Oir is a small river tributary of the Selune, and
ﬂows into Mont Saint Michel Bay (Fig. 1). The catchment
area is 87 km2, and the main stem is approximately 25 km
long. The mean gradient is 1.1%.
In the Fremur, despite a medium water quality, high
recruitment and density levels (0.37 eel m2) of eels
could be observed. In this system, the European eel is
the most common species in terms of biomass and in
the shallow (<1 m) habitats, males are dominant (>80%;
study period: 1996–2013). By contrast, the Oir River is a
tributary of the Selune River and is known as a salmo-
nid river (Bagliniere, Marchand & Vauclin, 2005; Rivot
et al., 2008). In this system, low densities of eels were
observed (0.04 eel m2) and the sex ratio was skewed
towards females (>90%; 2000–2013).
The Oir River is obstructed by only one weir, and the
Fremur River is obstructed by two major dams (Pont es
Omnes and Bois Joli) that were previously impassable
until the construction of ﬁsh passes (Feunteun et al.,
1998). The highest Dam, at Bois Joli, is 14 m high and
holds a 3 9 106 m3 reservoir. A lift for the upstream
migration of eels was built in 1996. Upstream, three
minor works, including a culvert under a road, a ﬂow-
gauging device, and a sill (step) beneath a bridge, have
created temporary obstacles for eel migration, but are
passable during periods of high ﬂow (Feunteun et al.,
(a)

1998). These three obstacles lead to an accumulation of
eels downstream of the hydraulic works and very low
densities immediately upstream of the obstacle (Feun-
teun et al., 1998).
Sampling
Annually (between 1996 and 2012 in the Fremur, and
between 2000 and 2012 in the Oir), two methods were
used to sample eels in each river. Firstly, between
September and October, growing and sub-adult eels
were captured using electroﬁshing with a ‘Heron’ appa-
ratus (Dream Electronique, Pessac, France) set at DC
300 V and 3 A, in different sampling sites along the lon-
gitudinal gradient of the rivers (between 15 and 32, and
between 15 and 39 sampling sites per year for the
Fremur and Oir rivers respectively). Most sites were
sampled with a minimum of two successive removals.
Additional removals (three or four) were made if neces-
sary, until the catch per pass decreased by 75% or more
between successive passes (Acou et al., 2011). For our
analyses,
in
both
catchments,
sampling
sites
were
regrouped into river sections, to take into account the
distance to the sea and the downstream–upstream pro-
ductivity
of each
system.
Four
river
sections
were
deﬁned in the Fremur River by using temporary obsta-
cles to migrating eels (Fig. 1; Feunteun et al., 1998; Acou
et al., 2011). The three river sections of the Oir River
were chosen based on the location of the principal tribu-
taries of the river (Fig. 1).
Secondly, between September and February (depend-
ing on the rise in the level of the rivers), growing and
sub-adult eels that leave the system were caught with a
downstream trap placed at the Pont es Omnes Dam in
the Fremur River and at the Cerisel water-mill in the Oir
River (Fig. 1).
All captured eels were anaesthetised with clove oil
(Walsh & Pease, 2002) and measured (total length, TL,
to the nearest mm), weighed (total weight, TW, to the
nearest g) and their stage (yellow or silver eel) deter-
mined. Silver eels were identiﬁed by three criteria (Acou
et al., 2005; Acou, Poizat & Crivelli, 2006): the colour of
the back and belly, the presence of a well-deﬁned lateral
line, and an ocular index (OI) ≥6.5, according to Pan-
khurst’s silvering threshold value (Pankhurst, 1982). If
only two of the criteria (most often the lateral line and
OI value) were met, the eel was considered a silver eel.
If only one (generally the OI value) or none were met,
the eel was regarded as yellow.
Eels caught during sampling with a length >150 mm,
were
individually
marked
with
passive
integrated
transponder tags (Prentice, Flagg & McCutcheon, 1990;
Table 1). For the newly marked and recaptured eels,
individual information was recorded (TL, TW, stage,
site, and date). After handling, the ﬁsh recovered for
more than 15 min before being released at the site of
capture.
Survival and transition probability estimates
For each system, multistate capture-recapture models
with an annual time step were used to analyse the data
(Lebreton et al., 2009) and estimate annual survival (Φ),
transition (w), and detection (P) probabilities. For the
eels individually marked (1367 and 2356 marked eels in
Fremur and Oir rivers, respectively), six different stages
were created considering different ecological and beha-
vioural characteristics (Baisez, 2001; Laffaille et al., 2004;
Acou et al., 2011): Stage 1 (S1) consisted of recently
recruited elvers that colonised the river and sedentary
growing yellow eels (yellow eels with a size <300 mm),
stage 2 (S2) (yellow eels between 301 and 450 mm) and
stage 3 (S3) (yellow eels with a size >451 mm) repre-
sented the potential reproductive status of future male
or female silver eels, respectively). The resident and the
migratory silver eels (individuals caught as silver eel in
the sampling sites and in the downstream trap respec-
tively) represented stage 4 (S4) and 5 (S5), respectively.

Individuals can enter in the population at any of these
stages. Finally, D represented the dead eels.
The annual temporal dynamics of stages was deter-
mined by transition probabilities (w). The possible tran-
sition from a stage to another were ﬁxed considering the
growth rates observed in the Oir and Fremur rivers
(mean: 19.1 mm year1, max: 93 mm year1, and mean:
20.9 mm year1,
max:
134 mm year1,
respectively.
Then, eels from S1 could stay in S1 or change to S2, S4,
or S5, eels from S2 could stay in S2 or change to S3, S4, or
S5, eels from S3 could stay in S3 or change to S4 or S5,
eels from S4 could stay in S4 or change to S5. Migratory
silver eels could only stay in the migratory silver eel
stage (as they left the system), then the transition proba-
bility from S5 to S5 was ﬁxed to 1. Transition probability
from a stage to a smaller stage was ﬁxed to 0. Similarly,
as a silver eel could not return to a yellow eel stage, the
transition probabilities from S4 to S1, S2, or S3 were ﬁxed
to 0. The full transition matrix was presented in Table 2.
These transitions were conditional on survival probabil-
ity (Φ) and stages were related to observations through
detection probabilities (P). The survival matrix is pre-
sented in Table 3. We deﬁned a set of candidate models,
for each system, incorporating biologically relevant com-
binations of year, stages, and river section effects on sur-
vival, transition, and detection probabilities. Regarding
temporal effects on survival and transition, we consid-
ered continuous effects to test for the inﬂuence of envi-
ronmental conditions. We incorporated a river section
effect to assess whether the localisation of eels inﬂu-
enced their survival and transition probabilities. Studies
have shown that growth and body conditions near the
estuary are often higher than in the upper reaches of a
river catchment (Daverat et al., 2006; Lasne et al., 2008).
Regarding recapture probabilities, we considered tempo-
ral effects, and because silver eels were supposed to be
less sedentary than other stages due to their need to
migrate downstream to the sea, we tested for the inﬂu-
ence of stage. We incorporated these effects in each
parameter (P, Φ and w) sequentially while constraints on
remaining parameters were held constant. To develop
the most suitable model, we ﬁrstly selected the most
appropriate structure for P testing from the different
effects individually. Once the main effect was deter-
mined, the remaining effects were included in an addi-
tive and interactive way to assess if one of these
combinations was relevant and this process continued
until no more effective model was selected. Secondly,
we repeated the same procedure for Φ using the previ-
ously selected structure for P and ﬁnally for w using the
structures for P and Φ selected in the previous steps.
The most parsimonious model was selected, using the
Akaike information Criterion (AIC; Burnham & Ander-
son, 2002). These analyses were performed using the
software program E-SURGE (Choquet et al., 2009a), and
the quality of ﬁt of the models (Pradel, Wintrebert &
Gimenez, 2003), using the software program U-CARE
(Choquet, Rouan & Pradel, 2009b). If time-dependent
survival was identiﬁed, the effect of different parameters
on time variation was investigated by performing an
analysis of deviance (ANODEV) as described by Gros-
bois et al. (2008), using the statistics Ftestcst/co/t:

test issue. For the signiﬁcant covariates, the proportion
of variance explained by the covariate using the R2
statistic (Grosbois et al., 2008).
Factors used to explain temporal survival variability
To explain temporal survival variability, different factors
were tested. This analysis was only focused on the three
yellow eel stages (S1, S2, and S3).
Temperature.
Sadler (1979) determined both upper and
lower lethal temperatures for eels. They highlighted that
the critical thermal maximum varied from 33 to 39 °C
and that eels enter a state of torpor at temperatures
varying from 1 to 3 °C. In the Oir River, water tempera-
tures were recorded using a probe located downstream
in the river. In the Fremur, daily river temperature (°C)
was recorded with a data logger set at 1 m depth near
the downstream trap. During our study period, water
temperatures ranged from 0.95 to 25.8 °C with an aver-
age temperature of 13.05 °C in the Fremur River and
from 1.8 to 21.7 °C with an average temperature of
11.9 °C in the Oir River, so eels never encountered the
critical thermal maximum, but they could be affected by
low temperatures. Therefore, we calculated the number
of days when the water temperature was below 3 °C
(ND 3) between two sampling sessions to determine the
possible effect of these low temperatures on eel survival.
Furthermore, water temperature could be used as a
proxy of the primary productivity of the system (Morin,
Lamoureux & Busnarda, 1999), then productivity and
associated potential prey for eels should decrease with
decreasing water temperatures, which could lead to
decreased survival. To understand this possible effect,
the mean water temperature between two sampling ses-
sions was calculated (Tmean).
Density.
As highlighted by previous studies, density
could have a strong impact on survival (Lobon-Cervia &
Iglesias, 2008; Bevacqua et al., 2010). For each sample site
with more than two consecutive passes (between 25 and
31 sites and between 6 and 14 sites every year in Fremur
and Oir rivers, respectively) using all individuals sam-
pled, thanks to the depletion method used for the sam-
plings, eel abundance was calculated using a weighted
maximum likelihood model (Carle & Strub, 1978) and
density (eels m2) was calculated by dividing the esti-
mated abundance by the surface area of the sampled
site. Thus, the total density (regrouping all the stages)
was estimated for each sampled site every year and the
speciﬁc densities of the three yellow eel stages were esti-
mated as the competition for food is size speciﬁc with
their diets evolve with increasing proportions of ﬁsh as
their size increases (Schulze et al., 2004; Cucherousset
et al., 2011). The mean of all sampled site densities was
used as the proxy of the total density of the system.
Then, four variables were created: dtt,tot representing the
total density (regrouping all the stages) of the system in
the year t, and dtt,S1, dtt,S2, dtt,S3 representing the total
densities of S1, S2, and S3, respectively, of the Fremur
and Oir rivers for year t.
Recruitment.
In small catchments such as the Fremur,
major concentrations of glass eels recruited from the
ocean are still found, presumably because of different
currents, which are the principal vector for eel recruit-
ment in Europe
(Dekker, 2003; Bonhommeau et al.,
2010). Moreover, in such small rivers, young recruits
may colonise the whole river in a single wave of
upstream migration (Feunteun et al., 2003). It is likely
that such massive colonisation of rivers by recruits could
induce important pressure on individuals already estab-
lished and lead to decreasing inter- and intra-cohort sur-
vival. A ﬁsh-lift installed at the Bois Joli dam in the
Fremur River enabled the passage and count of the total
number of recruits entering the system (between 381
and 26765 recruits, coefﬁcient of variation: 0.82) and
their characteristics (size and stage). We tested if this
highly variable number of recruits (Fig. 2) could explain
the temporal survival variability of the in-stream eel
population of the Fremur River. Such data are unavail-
able for the Oir River.
Results
Considering the model selected for each system, the

adequately (for the Fremur: v² = 45.445, d.f. = 85, P = 1;
for the Oir: v² = 97.243, d.f. = 98, P = 0.503).
For both systems, the most suitable models predicted
that detection probabilities varied according to stage and
time. However, regarding the survival and transition
probabilities, the main effects on these parameters dif-
fered (Tables 4 and 5).
In the Oir River, survival probabilities varied accord-
ing to stage with an increase of survival with size
(S1 = 0.60, S2 = 0.85, S3 = 0.80; Fig. 3), but were constant
in time and space (absence of river section effect). In the
Fremur River, survival probabilities between the yellow
eel stages were slightly different (on average S1 = 0.77,
S2 = 0.72 and S3 = 0.81; Fig. 4), but varied with marked
ﬂuctuation over the study period (between 0.29 and
0.99; Fig. 4). A decrease in survival probability was
observed in 1998 (0.46), 2000 (0.55), and 2006 (0.46)
(Fig. 4). Furthermore, survival probabilities varied spa-
tially (on average in the downstream river section A:
0.71, B: 0.78, C: 0.68, and in the upstream river section
D: 0.73; Fig. 4). Because the survival probabilities (for all
the stages and all the river section) were estimated as 1
in 1999, a boundary of the domain of a probability, the
estimates are unreliable for this particular year. Mean
annual survival probability was lower in the Oir than in
the Fremur River for S1 (z-test (Lebreton et al., 1992),
z = 2.032, P < 0.05), whereas the mean annual survival
probability was higher in the Oir than in the Fremur
River for S2 (z = 6.780, P < 0.05). No signiﬁcant differ-
ence of S3 mean annual survival was observed between
the two systems (z = 0.257, P = 0.80).
In the Oir River, transition probabilities were inﬂu-
enced by time and stage (Fig. 5). whereas in the Fremur
River, transition from one stage to another varied with
stages but was constant in time (Fig. 6). The mean
annual transition probabilities from S1 to stage S2 and
stage S2 to S3 were equivalent in the Oir and Fremur
River
(z = 1.019,
P = 0.308;
z = 1.409,
P = 0.159,
respectively). Furthermore, in the Oir River, few individ-
uals from S2 changed to a silver eel stage (average tran-
sition probabilities from S2 to S4 and S5: 0.02), whereas
in the Fremur River, transition probability from S2 to S4
and S5 was 0.20 (from S2 to S4: z = 2.934, P < 0.05; from
S2 to S5: z = 4.920, P < 0.05).
For the Fremur data set, ANODEV revealed that no
single covariate explained the temporal variability of
survival
signiﬁcantly (Table 6, P > 0.05). In the Oir
River, the most suitable model predicted that survival

probabilities varied according to stage, but were con-
stant in time and space. However, as results highlighted
that there are still relatively large conﬁdence intervals in
the Oir River survival estimates (S1: 0.47–0.73, S2: 0.80–
0.89, S3: 0.66–0.90), analyses were carried out to test if a
model with a temporal covariate would outperform the
constant model. Four reference time-dependent models
were selected: Ft,tot where survival probabilities of the
three yellow eel stages (S1, S2, S3) varied with time, Ft,S1
where only the survival probabilities of S1 varied with
time, Ft,S2 where only the survival probabilities of S2 var-
ied with time, Ft,S3 where only the survival probabilities
of S3 varied with time. Then, different covariates were
incorporated into the selected time-dependent models
(Ft,tot, Ft,S1, Ft,S2, Ft,S3).Using the ANODEV and then the
Bonferroni procedure for multiple tests, no single covari-
ate explained a signiﬁcant part of the survival consider-
ing the reference models Ft,tot, Ft,S2, and Ft,S3. For the
model Ft,S1, dtt,tot and dtt,S1 explained a signiﬁcant part
of the survival (P < 0.05, Table 7). However, individu-
ally those covariates explained less than 0.01% of the
deviance in the temporal variance of survival probabili-
ties (Table 7). Therefore, no ecological relevant conclu-
sions could be made on the impact of the different
covariates on survival due to the low explained vari-
ance.
The time-dependent reference model for the Fremur
River was ﬁnally selected. In the Oir River, the results
highlighted that the covariates explained a very small
part of the temporal survival variability, but also that a
model with a temporal covariate did not outperform the
constant model (AIC difference, Table 5). Therefore, the
most suitable model found for the Oir River was the
constant model. Using those two models, we evaluated
the mean annual natural survival probabilities observed
for yellow eel stages in the Fremur and Oir river sys-
tems and found these to be 0.76  0.18 and 0.75  0.13
respectively.
Discussion
The survival estimates observed in the two systems are
in the range of others values for European catchments
such as the Imsa River in Norway (mean survival:
0.833 y1; Vollestad & Jonsson, 1988) or the Esva River
in Spain (0.621 y1; Lobon-Cervia & Iglesias, 2008).
However, our major results show that their population
dynamics differ to some extent, suggesting different
responses to regulatory processes.
In the Fremur River, survival probabilities varied sig-
niﬁcantly along the water course. Previous studies on yel-
low European eels in river systems show that distance
from the sea (Ibbotson et al., 2002) and/or the presence of

barriers to upstream migrations (Feunteun et al., 1998) are
the most important determinant factors for density and
size structure of the population (Feunteun et al., 2003). In
addition, eel growth, sex determination, and size/age at
maturity usually co-vary with this spatial pattern (Krue-
ger & Oliveira, 1999; Acou et al., 2003; Feunteun et al.,
2003) because most of the environmental factors (salinity,
productivity, etc.) are structured along the downstream–
upstream gradient (Amoros & Petts, 1993). In the present
study, survival probabilities did not seem to be affected
by this gradient as no speciﬁc downstream–upstream pat-
tern was observed. However, the presence of obstacles
between each river section could explain this spatial vari-
ability. Indeed, as shown by Feunteun et al. (1998), the
partition of the Fremur creates a partially enclosed envi-
ronment with speciﬁc characteristics (available food and
space, and density of conspeciﬁcs). Furthermore, they
demonstrated that most of the obstacles are impassable
for eels that exceed 180–200 mm, and then even if the
local conditions are unfavourable these eels could not
migrate to other parts of the system, which could induce
site-speciﬁc mortality. Temporal variation could have
been caused by environmental effects; however, eels have
high plasticity. Therefore, it is possible that in this tem-
perate region, even very high water temperatures did not
affect survival.
As highlighted in previous studies, density depen-
dence could strongly regulate eel populations and may
explain the survival variability (De Leo & Gatto, 1996;
Vollestad & Jonsson, 1988; Lobon-Cervia & Iglesias,

2008; Bevacqua et al., 2010). Furthermore, the negative
feedback of the population size could be particularly
important when populations approach their maximum
size (Gaillard, Festa-Bianchet & Yoccoz, 1998; Eberhardt,
2002). Previous studies in the Fremur River, suggested
that eel populations reach such a level in lotic habitats
(Acou et al., 2011). However, no signiﬁcant relationship
between eel density and survival was observed in the
present study. This is unexpected as the Fremur should
be saturated, and therefore increased density should
lead to a decrease of survival. Non-mutually exclusive
hypotheses could explain this discrepancy. Firstly, ignor-
ing measurement error for density estimates may lead to
an underestimation of the density–dependent relation-
ship (Barker, Fletcher & Scoﬁeld, 2002; Carroll et al.,
2006). Secondly, the scale at which we studied density
dependence could be inappropriate. As shown by vari-
ous studies, density dependence is only meaningful if
the study area is ﬁne enough to capture the wide range
of density of conspeciﬁcs experienced by the population
in the study system and large enough to prevent indi-
viduals migrating in the search for food from unit to
another during the studied year (Hassell, 1987; Stewart-
Oaten, Murdoch & Walde, 1995; Ray & Hastings, 1996;
Jenkins et al., 1999). In the present study, we estimated
density and survival at the scale of the river section.
However, Ovidio et al. (2013) showed a longitudinal
home range between 33 and 341 m in a small stream in
Belgium. Therefore, to determine the effect of competi-
tion, we should have focused our study on density-

dependent survival at an intermediate scale, between
sampling sites (30–60 m) and river section (2–4 km).
However, the use of this intermediate scale necessitates
sufﬁcient marked individuals in each speciﬁc area which
was not the case in our study. Finally, our study focused
on individuals with a size >150 mm representing >2-
year-old individuals (Acou et al., 2009). However, den-
sity-dependent processes in ﬁsh may decline with age
(Cushing, 1975), so density-dependent processes on sur-
vival could only be applied to individuals smaller than
those studied here. Some studies supported that density
dependence is usually restricted to early life stages
(Elliott, 1989; Persson & Greenberg, 1990; Dawson, 1991;
Jenkins, Young & Davis, 1991). The important variability
of recruitment, the instream density stability, and the
absence
of
density
dependence
on
survival
of
the
marked individuals (>150 mm) in the Fremur suggest
that important density-dependent processes, especially
on survival should be applied on the smallest individu-
als, i.e., the recruits (90–150 mm). However, to conﬁrm
this hypothesis, further studies are needed.
The
important
decrease
in
survival
probabilities
observed in the Fremur River in 1998, 2000, and 2006
are probably due to exceptional events than to the sys-
tematic effects of temperature or density. Despite no
density-dependent effects on survival on our yellow eel
stages, an exceptional recruitment may affect the sur-
vival of instream populations. According to a general
hypothesis, density-dependent mortality caused by lim-
ited spatial resources, occurs when the colonisation of
glass eels is sufﬁciently large and upstream migrants
face an overcrowded river habitat (Moriarty, 1986; Vol-
lestad & Jonsson, 1988; Feunteun et al., 2003). Therefore,
the low annual survival observed in 1998 in the resident
population
could
be
explained
by
the
exceptional
recruitment observed during this particular year. In
1998, recruitment was four times higher than the overall
mean representing an increase of 0.36 eel m2 in the
whole system, effectively doubling the population. The
large number of recruits observed this year might have
induced
intra-
and
inter-cohorts
competition
for
resources and decreased survival of the recruits and the
resident population (Feunteun et al., 2003). However, in
terms of biomass, the increase was more limited (in-
crease of 1.1 g m2 in the whole system). To conﬁrm the
potential correlation between the number of recruits and
low survival more years with critical recruitments is nec-
essary. Another event that may have played a role in
explaining the annual decrease in eel survival is the
draining of the Bois Joli reservoir that occurred between
June 2006 and February 2007. The effect of this draining

Survival in two unexploited populations of European eels
11

on the eel population upstream is unknown; however,
changes in the water level may have decreased food and
habitat availability, and increased predation and migra-
tion, which could have led to the low eel survival in this
year.
Unlike the Fremur River, annual survival probabilities
observed were stable over time and space in the Oir
River. Several hypotheses can be postulated. Firstly,
upstream and downstream migrations are not disrupted
by any obstacles, so when the local conditions are unfa-
vourable for eels, individuals may move to another part
of the system. Secondly, recruitment is remarkably lower
and densities are ﬁvefold lower than those of the
Fremur, suggesting that the impact of density-dependent
processes on survival might slacken. Moreover, as in the
Fremur River, the water temperatures should not affect
survival. Finally, the contrasting survival observed in
the two systems possibly result from differences in the
characteristics of the two systems and the two sub-popu-
lations.
The contrasting pressures on those two sub-popula-
tions and their impact on annual survival and transition
probabilities could lead to different life history strategies
as suggested by the difference in sex ratio observed
between the lotic habitats of the two rivers (predomi-
nantly females and males in the Oir and Fremur rivers
respectively). The sexes of eels were hypothesised to
develop and mature according to different life history

strategies, males using a time-minimising strategy and
females using a size-maximising strategy which is con-
sistent with our results (Helfman et al., 1987; Vøllestad,
1992; Oliveira, 1999; Oliveira & McCleave, 2002). In the
Oir River, annual survival probabilities increase with
size classes but were constant in time and space. There-
fore, the main advantage for eels in the Oir is to rapidly
maximise their size (i.e., fecundity) to minimise mortal-
ity, thereby maximising their ﬁtness. In the Fremur
River, annual survival probabilities were slightly differ-
ent between the yellow eel stages, but varied greatly
within the study period. In this situation, the best strat-
egy was to maintain sub-maximum growth rates to
enhance survival and reach the minimum size necessary
to achieve the spawning migration. Considering transi-
tion probabilities, it is likely that individuals from the
Oir River continued to grow to reach the highest size at
maturity and increased fecundity. On the contrary, eels
from the Fremur River metamorphosed to the migratory
silver phase at smaller sizes and younger ages and may
have shifted resources away from somatic growth for
gonadal development.
Finally, our results highlight that the extrinsic and/or
intrinsic pressures on eel populations will determine the
strategy developed by individuals to reach maturity. In
the Fremur River, the time-minimising strategy of male
eels
that
maintains
sub-maximum
growth
rates
to
enhance
survival,
with
limited
variability
between
stages, to the size necessary to achieve a spawning
migration,
seems
adapted
to
the
system
conditions
(dams, high density, highly variable recruitment, etc.).
On the contrary, in the system where the pressure is
low and stable over time and space, a more risky strat-
egy during the earlier years of an individual (survival
lower in the younger stages) could be developed so they
could enter a subsequent niche that achieve a higher ﬁt-
ness. If regulation processes exist at a size <150 mm in
the Fremur and not in the Oir River, this could conﬁrm
that the determination of sex is strongly correlated with
density pressure on young individuals (Krueger & Oli-
veira, 1999).
For conservation, demographic models were devel-
oped for assessing the escapement of silver eels (i.e.,
Aprahamian et al., 2007; Lambert & Rochard, 2007).
However, such modelling over the whole life cycle is
very complex and realistic demographic parameters
such as survival rate need to be collated in different sys-
tems. Our study provides evidences that those models
need to take into account size-speciﬁc survival but also
a between-year variability in survival of >150 mm yel-
low eels to estimate reliable escapement of silver eels.
However, more studies are needed to understand the
factors inﬂuencing survival variability.
