PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
How does a human mind emerge within a human brain 
as it navigates within an uncertain world while attempt-
ing to efficiently regulate its body within hard biologi-
cal constraints? Recently, a hypothesis has emerged that 
offers a possible answer: Actions, and their accompany-
ing mental events, begin as top-down representations 
in the brain, fashioned from past experiences that are 
tested against the state of the world (see Table 1). This 
is not a new idea (see the Appendix), but increasingly, 
research in a variety of different psychological domains 
is testing this core hypothesis, largely along parallel 
trajectories.
In this article, we suggest that their integration offers 
a counterintuitive but coherent, neurobiologically plau-
sible scientific paradigm that has implications for guid-
ing psychological research. This family of research 
approaches is deeply rooted in various forms of predic-
tive coding (e.g., A. Clark, 2013; Rao & Ballard, 1999; 
Spratling, 2017), in which prediction signals, as repre-
sentations constructed from past experiences, are com-
pared with incoming sensory information to form 
prediction errors; prediction errors can be encoded 
and learned to update stored experience, which is 
then available for use in future predictions. Such 
approaches also include the Bayesian-brain approach 
(e.g., Vilares & Kording, 2011), which assumes that the 
brain performs (approximate) Bayesian inferences 
when computing predictions and prediction errors; 
belief propagation (e.g., Lochmann & Deneve, 2011), 
which proposes that predictions are anticipatory-cause 
explanations for sensations that are mapped, inversely, 
to those sensations; and active inference (e.g., Friston, 
FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2017), 
which hypothesizes that the brain’s model of how sen-
sations are caused is constrained by the need to mini-
mize the cost of prediction error.
Here, we first consider key elements of this overarch-
ing “predictive-processing” research program, discussing 
several examples of its utility for psychological science. 
We then discuss its potential to improve the robustness 
and replicability of psychological research, as well as its 
potential to offer unintuitive but powerful hypotheses 
that explain cognitions, emotions, perceptions, and 
actions as emerging from a smaller set of common com-
putational ingredients.

Abstract
In the last two decades, neuroscience studies have suggested that various psychological phenomena are produced by 
predictive processes in the brain. When considered together, these studies form a coherent, neurobiologically inspired 
program for guiding psychological research about the mind and behavior. In this article, we consider the common 
assumptions and hypotheses that unify an emerging framework and discuss the ramifications of such a framework, 
both for improving the replicability and robustness of psychological research and for renewing psychological theory 
by suggesting an alternative ontology of the human mind.

Predictive Processing: Some Core 
Hypotheses
A variety of research findings that seem counterintuitive 
within psychology’s traditional framework (Fig. 1a) are 
plausibly explained by predictive-processing accounts 
of the human mind and brain (Fig. 1b), as discussed in 
a growing literature (e.g., Barrett, 2009, 2017a, 2017b; 
A. Clark, 2013, 2016; Friston et al., 2017; Hohwy, 2013; 
Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Koster-Hale & Saxe, 2013). 
This research program is united by a core computa-
tional hypothesis: A brain is continually running an 
internal model of an animal’s world. The model is gen-
erative, meaning that past experiences can be recom-
bined in novel ways as they are remembered. Unlike 
psychology’s traditional framework, in which percep-
tion and action are separate processes with one causing 
the other, the predictive-processing approach suggests 
that perception and action are united by the brain’s 
internal model in its effort to efficiently navigate its 
body in the world. Efficient navigation entails predic-
tively controlling the autonomic nervous system, the 
endocrine system, and other internal systems to antici-
pate the needs of the body in the service of upcoming 
motor actions (Sterling, 2012; Sterling & Laughlin, 
2015). Consequently, the model predicts, or infers, the 
sensory inputs that are expected to derive from those 
movements, from which perceptions emerge (e.g., A. 
Clark, 2013; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018).
According to this account, neural predictions are a 
continuously changing filter through which sensory 
inputs are processed, influencing the relevance of those 
inputs and effectively deciding which sensory features 
warrant further processing. This filtering is thought to 
be experienced as effortless, without a sense of per-
sonal agency or deliberation and without a specific 
mechanism for appraising self-relevance per se (as sug-
gested by Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003). Furthermore, the 
brain’s internal model is refined on the basis of com-
parisons with incoming sensory information from the 
body and the world; that is, its intrinsic activity can be 
either confirmed or modified by comparison with sen-
sory input from the world and in the body (Raichle, 
2015). In effect, by registering deviations from its inter-
nal model, the brain establishes whether and how to 
spend energy resources to act, and correspondingly, 
learn any unanticipated sensory inputs to improve the 
internal model.
This emerging predictive-processing research pro-
gram offers innovative and important hypotheses for 
psychological science, many of which are scattered 
throughout diverse literatures and growing number 
of summaries and reviews. Here, to illustrate the 
program’s scientific utility, we focus on two hypoth-
eses: (a) Single mental events do not arise in a vac-
uum but are temporally dependent on prior events, 
and (b) energy regulation, plus its affective conse-
quences, are core features of all psychological phe-
nomena, not just those that are emotional or involve 
fight or flight.
Temporal dependence of mental events
Psychologists and neuroscientists have known for some 
time that the brain processes information in a tempo-
rally dependent fashion, such that responses to incom-
ing sensory inputs are conditional on current activity. 
For example, numerous findings suggest that perceptual 
processing on a current experimental trial depends on 
an internal state from a previous trial or is otherwise 
informed by the past (e.g., Fischer & Whitney, 2014; 
Kok, Mostert, & de Lange, 2017; St. John-Saaltink, Kok, 
Lau, & de Lange, 2016; Van de Cruys, Vanmarcke, Van 
de Put, & Wagemans, 2017). This dependence on mem-
ory occurs even when experimental tasks do not require 
participants to explicitly “remember” past events, sug-
gesting that such an internal model can influence per-
ceptual processing implicitly.
Studies such as these suggest specific hypotheses for 
understanding how perceptions are formed. One such 
hypothesis is that, in certain circumstances, perceptual 
reports will resemble a combination of a perceiver’s

The Power of Predictions

Fig. 1.  Psychology’s representational framework compared with the emerging predictive processing framework. Since emerging in the mid-
1800s, psychological science has been guided by what is called a representational framework (Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018), in which sensory 
neurons are thought to create a representation of features in the world (i.e., the perception of a stimulus), which is then passed, like a baton 
in a relay race, to other parts of the brain that appraise it (i.e., cognition or emotion) and then respond. In the representational framework (a), 
internal representations and their outputs—the mental events you experience (thoughts, feelings) and the actions you take (behaviors)—are 
the result of sensory inputs (i.e., stimuli) from the world. Past experiences modulate these stimulus-response links. The colors of the boxes 
denote correspondence between proposed mental faculties and their mapping to the brain (green corresponds to sensation and perception, 
light blue to cognition, red to emotion, and dark blue to action). The emerging predictive-processing research paradigm (b) offers a coun-
terintuitive correction, turning the implied causality on its head. Your experience of the world and your action in that world derive from an 
active, constructive process driven by your brain’s internal model. Your brain starts with current conditions and “remembers” trajectories of 
prior experiences, projecting itself forward in time, assembling multiple competing prediction signals that prepare the body to move (green 
arrows; e.g., what muscles did I move the last time I was in a situation that is similar to this one?). Copies of these motor commands are thought 
to modulate the ongoing firing of sensory neurons, inferring the sensory consequences of those movements, thereby simulating some future 
state of the body and the world (green arrows; e.g., the last time I was in a similar situation and I prepared to move my body in a similar way, 
what did I see next?). If a brain’s internal model are hypotheses about the future state of things, then incoming sensory inputs are the data 
used to test those hypotheses (purple arrows). The key structural hypothesis is that internal representations (prediction signals) and learning 
signals (prediction errors) are propagated by neurons arranged in a loose hierarchy (discussed in more detail in Fig. 2). It is hypothesized 
that when there is a mismatch between a prediction signal at a given level in the hierarchy and information being passed from a lower level, 
the neurons in question have the opportunity to change their pattern of firing to capture the unexpected input; this is how prediction error 
is thought to propagate up the processing hierarchy to modify the internal model in the moment and to optimize future predictions. When 
there is no mismatch, the prediction signal at a given level in the hierarchy is already firing in a way that represents incoming information. 
Once prediction errors are sufficiently minimized, these “inferences” become the brain’s causal account of what caused the sensations in the 
first place, effectively categorizing the sensations so that they are meaningful.
internal model (i.e., the prediction) and a stimulus, 
rather than just the stimulus per se. For example, a 
number of studies show that people are experientially 
blind when presented with an apparently random selec-
tion of black and white blobs (Mooney images) that are 
actually visually degraded versions of regular images. 
These images are then perceived as coherent after 
exposure to the natural source images that were used 
to make them (e.g., Van de Cruys et al., 2017). Such 
findings suggest that perceptual experience is sculpted 
by an internal model after, but not before, exposure to 
the source images (also see Kanizsa illusions; Kok, 
Bains, van Mourik, Norris, & de Lange, 2016). In another 
example of combination, when participants are asked 
to adjust the color of a well-known object such as a 
banana to be gray, they tend to overadjust (i.e., they 
adjust it to be more bluish-gray, which combined with 
the predicted yellow produces a subjective judgment 
of gray; Hansen, Olkkonen, Walter, & Gegenfurtner, 
2006). Consistent with these findings, research has 
shown that perception is also facilitated (e.g., breaking 
through visual suppression) when features of the inter-
nal model anticipate incoming stimulus features, creat-
ing perceptual fluency (Chanes, Wormwood, Betz, & 
Barrett, 2018).
The role of energy regulation in 
mental events
One important development within the predictive-
processing framework comes from several recent studies 
in which computational hypotheses about predictive 
dynamics have been integrated with anatomical models 
of information flow in the cerebral cortex (e.g., Barrett, 
2017a; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Chanes & Barrett, 2016; 
Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018), the hippocampus and 
medial temporal lobe (e.g., Gravina & Sederberg, 2017), 
the cerebellum (Schlerf, Ivry, & Diedrichsen, 2012), and 
the striatum and other subcortical regions comprising 
the dopaminergic reward system (Schultz, 2016). One 
attempt offers hypotheses about the flow of predictions 
and prediction-error signals within the brain using archi-
tectural models of cortical connections (Barrett & 
Simmons, 2015; Chanes & Barrett, 2016; Friston et al., 
2017; see Fig. 2). A central implication arising from this 
approach is that the brain’s internal model is centrally 
concerned with energy regulation, making energetics 
relevant for all mental events, not just those involving 
emotion or fight-or-flight responses. This hypothesis is 
consistent with the suggestion that predictive processing 
is ideal for minimizing free energy (Friston et al., 2017) 
or uncertainty, so that information in the brain is being 
represented as efficiently as possible.
A key structural hypothesis of predictive-processing 
accounts is that internal representations (prediction 
signals) and learning signals (prediction errors) are 
propagated by neurons arranged in a loose hierarchy 
(Barbas, 2015; Mesulam, 1998). For more than 30 years, 
research has used anatomical features describing the 
arrangement and connectivity of neurons to predict infor-
mation flow across a loose cortical hierarchy (Barbas, 
2015). This hierarchy suggests how a generative internal 
model built and constrained by sensory events in the 
periphery might be implemented in the brain. Specifi-
cally, neurons within cortical areas that are higher in 
this predictive hierarchy send prediction signals to neu-
rons in regions that are lower in the hierarchy, with 
prediction errors flowing “upward” (see Fig. 2). An

Fig. 2.  Predictive processing from computation to whole-brain dynamics. In the original predictive coding model (a; Rao & 
Ballard, 1999), sensory input drives feed-forward error signals, which are processed by predictive estimators (PEs). PE modules 
consist of neurons whose activity (r) is compared with top-down activity from higher levels (i.e., prediction, rtd) and the difference 
of which is propagated forward to the next level as error (r – rtd). The flow of prediction and prediction-error signals between 
cortical columns based on cortical lamination gradients is shown in (b). Using anterograde and retrograde tracers, Barbas and 
colleagues (see Barbas, 2015, for a review) showed that the relative difference in laminar structure between two communicating 
cortical columns predicts whether the information flow is a feedback (prediction) or a feed-forward (prediction-error) signal. 
Prediction signals (green) originate in the deep layers (Layers V and VI) of less differentiated cortical areas (such as agranular 
cortex with undifferentiated Layers II and III and without a Layer IV, as depicted in the red column) and terminate in superficial 
layers of areas with a more developed laminar structure (such as dysgranular cortices with differentiated Layers II and III and a 
rudimentary Layer IV or granular cortices with differentiated Layers II and III and a well-defined Layer IV, depicted in the yellow 
column). Prediction-error signals (in purple) flow in the other direction, originating in the superficial layers (II and III) with more 
laminar differentiation and terminating in middle deep layers (V and VI) of areas with less differentiated laminar architecture. 
This structural model successfully predicts the flow of information in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices in experiments 
with monkeys and cats (see Barbas, 2015, for a review). The estimates of flow of prediction and prediction-error signals (c) are 
based on whole-brain cortical granularity data (von Economo, 2009; von Economo & Koskinas, 2008). Predictions flow from 
cortical regions with less laminar differentiation to regions with increasing laminar differentiation (e.g., from limbic cortices to 
motor, interoceptive, and primary somatosensory, auditory, and visual cortices). Researchers are still investigating many of the 
anatomical and computational details, such as whether each individual neuron is capable of coding for internal representations 
(i.e., predictions) and comparing those predictions with incoming inputs from lower in the hierarchy (i.e., prediction errors) or 
whether predictions and prediction errors are coded by different neurons in the cortex.

The Power of Predictions

important implication of this hypothesis is that limbic 
cortices, such as portions of the cingulate cortex, orbi-
tofrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and anterior insula, 
along with the hippocampus, have anatomical features 
that place them at the top of this predictive architecture 
(Barbas, 2015) and consequently provide the initial rep-
resentations of prediction signals that propagate 
throughout the cortex (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Chanes 
& Barrett, 2016).
This limbic ensemble, via a series of connections to 
the hypothalamus and throughout the brain stem, is 
also responsible for regulating the body’s global energy 
budget via control of the autonomic nervous system, 
the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems, and the 
other systems of the body’s internal milieu (for a review 
of connectivity and evidence of intrinsic functional con-
nectivity, see Kleckner et al., 2017). These limbic cor-
tices are thought to regulate the body by anticipating 
its needs and attempting to meet those needs before 
they arise (Ganzel, Morris, & Wethington, 2010), a pro-
cess called allostasis (Sterling, 2012), placing efficient 
energy regulation and metabolism at the core of the 
brain’s internal model. Because learning new informa-
tion has an energy cost, energetics may effectively 
determine the value of prediction errors that update 
the model (Theriault, Young, & Barret 2019). Limbic 
regions are still considered by many psychologists to 
be the most reactive parts of the brain, as home to 
emotions and therefore in need of control. But in this 
predictive-processing framework, limbic cortices, plus 
the hippocampus, are the source of prediction signals, 
driving action and perception in an inferential way 
concerned with energetics, not just during episodes of 
emotion, but during all mental events.
Several lines of research are broadly consistent with 
the hypothesis that metabolism and energetics are core 
concerns in the construction of action and mental 
events in the brain. The principles of neural design 
indicate that anticipatory regulation of the body is 
advantageous for energy efficiency (Sterling & Laughlin, 
2015), consistent with evidence that this efficiency is a 
major constraint on brain evolution. As energetics 
determine an animal’s internal state, they can influence 
contexts for learning (Yu & Dayan, 2005) and memory 
(Bouton, 2019). Energetics might play an underappreci-
ated role in sensory processing, because there are long-
range connections between limbic cortices (e.g., 
anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC) and primary sensory 
regions (e.g., primary visual cortex/V1; Zhang et al., 
2014), as well as evidence that the ACC sends predic-
tion signals to V1 (Leinweber, Ward, Sobczak, Attinger, 
& Keller, 2017). These prediction signals appear to be 
the source of neural firing in V1 after retinal lesions 
and subsequent visual deprivation (Keck et al., 2013). 
Such evidence is consistent with other findings that a 
substantial fraction of activity in the visual cortex is not 
related to visual input per se (see references in Keck 
et al., 2013) but instead may be due to prediction sig-
nals (Liang, Mouraux, Hu, & Iannetti, 2013). Indeed, 
consistent with such predictive influence, research sug-
gests that the majority of synapses in primary visual 
cortex originate from top-down sources (e.g., Sillito & 
Jones, 2002).
Furthermore, both structural- and functional-connectivity 
data provide additional evidence that limbic cortices are 
contained in two core intrinsic brain networks—the default 
mode and salience networks—that are implicated in vari-
ous psychological phenomena, including memory, percep-
tion, attention, social affiliation, pain, empathy, reward, 
addiction, stress, emotion, and decision making (reviewed 
in Kleckner et al., 2017). These findings suggest that allo-
stasis, in the service of efficient energy regulation, is a 
fundamental feature of the brain’s internal model as sup-
ported by these two networks. Such findings suggest a 
provocative hypothesis for future research: While support-
ing a given psychological function in a given moment, 
these networks are simultaneously maintaining or attempt-
ing to restore allostasis.
Practical Implications: The Robustness 
and Replicability of Psychological 
Research
Both hypotheses we discussed—the temporal depen-
dence of mental events and the importance of energet-
ics in mental life—have important implications for the 
robustness and replicability of psychological studies. 
Some of these observations have been made before, 
but a predictive-processing framework helps to further 
unify and motivate them. The approach also suggests 
points for enhancing robustness and replicability when 
designing future experiments.
Temporal dependence of mental events
The predictive-processing framework suggests that the 
brain is constantly attempting to impose predictability 
over multiple time scales. Interestingly, this tendency 
is at odds with traditional laboratory experiments 
designed using unpredictable sequences of events, 
potentially limiting the generalizability of stimulus-
response experiments, particularly when moving from 
the laboratory to the real world. That is, traditional 
laboratory experiments are typically constructed as ran-
dom sequences of stimuli to minimize influence across 
trials. This allows adjacent trials to be treated as 

286

independent, making them suitable for aggregation and 
traditional statistical analysis. In principle, many scien-
tists would not defend the assumption that the mind 
works in similarly independent and discrete chunks in 
time. In practice, however, a participant’s response on 
any given trial is some combination of the participant’s 
internal model and a given stimulus, and ideally both 
should be modeled to maximize the robustness of sci-
entific findings. Recent research has highlighted the 
utility of an experimental framework that moves beyond 
discrete individual events toward attempting to under-
stand brain and behavior in terms of continuous, tem-
porally dependent processes (Huk, Bonnen, & He, 
2018).
The role of energy regulation in 
mental events
Psychological science routinely makes reference to 
“affective stimuli” and “rewards” or “threats” as if such 
qualities are embedded in objects and events in the 
world rather than features that arise from transactions 
between a person’s current state and those objects and 
events. This is more than a trivial distinction: The fea-
tures of an experimental stimulus that are deemed 
salient by an experimenter may not be experienced 
thus by a participant, and other features that are deemed 
psychologically impotent by an experimenter may be 
salient to participants (or to certain participants). If the 
brain runs an internal model that is concerned with 
efficient energy regulation, and if the processing of 
stimuli are conditioned on that model, then the state 
of a person’s energy balance, and all the factors that 
can influence that balance (such as amount of sleep; 
ingestion of caffeine, sugar, or nicotine; and degree of 
hydration) can influence how the brain processes infor-
mation and, correspondingly, task performance. For 
example, people perform better on a variety of cogni-
tive tasks when they are tested at an optimal moment 
in their circadian cycle than they do at nonoptimal 
times (Yoon, May, & Hasher, 2012). If you schedule 
participants at a time of day that takes their circadian 
rhythm into account, then you will reduce what appears 
to be random variation which should increase 
replicability.
Even if any individual source of energetic influence 
is small, the overall impact on the robustness and rep-
licability can be substantial, particularly with small sam-
ple sizes (Benjamin et al., 2018). These factors, when 
not measured, can add variance in an experiment that 
will appear as noise in the measurements, increasing 
the likelihood of Type I and Type II errors. That is, only 
the most potent effects will replicate, compounding the 
impact of any Type II errors. Statistically controlling for 
such influences may remove meaningful variance that 
is better examined, again enhancing the likelihood of 
Type II errors. Additionally, when analyses do not con-
trol for such sources of variance, Type I errors may be 
inflated. When sample sizes are low, statistical power 
suffers, and any observed effect may be proportionally 
driven more by these factors (as power is reduced, so 
is the proportion of any observed effect that is due to 
reproducible variance). Thus, observed effects will be 
less likely to replicate as a consequence (Szucs & 
Ioannidis, 2017).
Conceptual Implications for 
Psychological Theory
The predictive-processing framework provides a prin-
cipled approach for unifying psychological phenomena 
into a common explanatory framework with a shared 
vocabulary for theory building, offering several novel 
conceptual implications. One implication is that phe-
nomena that we think of as separate processes arising 
from separate brain systems, such as automatic and 
controlled processing, could be conceptualized as dif-
ferent modes of whole-brain function (prediction based 
and prediction-error based).
According to this interpretation, the ubiquity of dual-
process theories in psychology (e.g., Evans & Stanovich, 
2013) may reflect a single underlying distinction 
between modes of prediction and prediction-error pro-
cessing in the brain. For example, in the context of 
controlled versus automatic processing, on a given 
experimental trial, a participant’s brain will launch a 
set of prediction signals, which scientists interpret as 
evidence for a rapid, automatic, and effortless process. 
If the stimulus is unexpected (such as when trials are 
randomized so stimuli remain unpredicted) or when a 
nonprepotent response is required, then participants 
will appear to correct the automatic process with a 
more deliberate, controlled, and effortful process. 
Learning and practice effects during the course of an 
experiment might be understood as the consequence 
of a brain successfully updating its internal model, just 
as inhibiting a prepotent response may reflect an updat-
ing of the model with prediction error. Participants thus 
appear to behave on the basis of rapid, automatic 
responses (predictions) followed by a more effortful 
choice that corrects them (updating with prediction 
error). What appears to be separate automatic and 
controlled processes in the mind may actually be dif-
ferent modes of operation for the brain: one emphasiz-
ing a participant’s internal model (prediction) and the 
other emphasizing correction and learning (prediction 
error).

287
One consequence of this two-mode perspective is 
that traditional experiments, designed as independent 
sequences of stimulus and response, effectively sever 
the contingencies between one moment and the next. 
That is, the brain’s predictions will almost certainly be 
wrong on many trials, forcing it into a mode that favors 
processing prediction error (e.g., driven by the stimuli), 
when in the real world the dynamics may frequently 
favor prediction (e.g., people with neurotypical brains 
are not continually in state of high prediction error). 
Thus, standard randomized designs encourage overs-
ampling of what might be an unnatural state of error 
processing. Instead, psychological causation might be 
better measured and modeled as temporally extended, 
probabilistic sequences of brain states (Barrett, 2009). 
Indeed, a relatively unexplored, but potentially rich line 
of research would be to explore traditional psychologi-
cal phenomena in predictable versus unpredictable 
experimental contexts (e.g., repeating vs. randomly 
generated sequences of trials).
In addition, a predictive-processing framework has 
the conceptual implication that certain psychological 
phenomena, such as memory, are actually ingredients 
in all psychological events, even those that do not 
appear to strictly involve memory. For example, atten-
tion has long been operationalized in terms of its influ-
ence on perceptual processing; however, a growing 
amount of evidence suggests that attention appears to 
be meaningfully guided by what one has encountered 
in the past (e.g., Hutchinson & Turk-Browne, 2012). 
Furthermore, neural signals in brain regions historically 
associated with memory, such as hippocampal activity, 
are also systematically observed during tasks of percep-
tion and attention (Aly, Ranganath, & Yonelinas, 2013; 
Aly & Turk-Browne, 2016). Predictions based on past 
experience influence relatively low-level perceptual 
processes and activity in primary visual cortex (den 
Ouden, Kok, & de Lange, 2012; O’Callaghan, Kveraga, 
Shine, Adams, & Bar, 2017; Rao & Ballard, 1999). Here, 
we suggest that such processes are pervasive and similar 
dynamics take place across a distributed cortical hier-
archy where the interplay between an internal model 
and feedback from the external world, as well as the 
interoceptive state of the body, guide learning at multiple 
time scales (e.g., Honey, Newman, & Schapiro, 2017).
The prediction framework also leads us to speculate 
that affect is part of every psychological phenomenon, 
even those that are not explicitly emotional. If allostasis 
and energetics are key features of the brain’s internal 
model, then so too are the predicted sensory conse-
quences of those processes, referred to as interoception 
(Craig, 2014). Interoception is usually experienced in 
a low-dimensional form as the affective properties of 
valence and arousal (Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009), 
suggesting that all psychological events exist in affec-
tive space. Valence and arousal might be better thought 
of as properties of consciousness, rather than properties 
of emotional episodes per se, as suggested by a number 
of philosophers. Consistent with this speculation, 
research shows that all words have affective connota-
tions (Osgood, May, & Mirron, 1975) and even puta-
tively “neutral” objects are experienced with subtle 
affective features (Lebrecht, Bar, Barrett, & Tarr, 2012). 
This insight, if correct, calls into question all hypotheses 
that cast cognition and emotion in a battle for the con-
trol of behavior, or as two separate processes that inter-
act to produce behavior, and suggests that the concept 
of “rationality” must be redefined as something other 
than the absence of affect.
When taken together, these implications suggest sev-
eral highly speculative ideas. First, many phenomena 
that go by different psychological names and up to now 
have been assumed to arise from distinct processes—
such as memory, perception, and emotion—may actu-
ally be better understood as arising from a smaller set 
of common computational building blocks, with 
prediction-related processing at the core. Speculating 
even further, we surmise that predictive optimization 
may even be implemented at the level of species-wide 
neural development. Recently, it has been proposed 
that many brains within the animal kingdom are struc-
tured to function via prediction and correction (Sterling 
& Laughlin, 2015). Consistent with the notion of 
“experience-expectant” processes (i.e., information 
storage in anticipation of particular life periods of expe-
rience rather than in response to them; Greenough, 
Black, & Wallace, 1987), efficiency based on temporal 
regularities in the environment might even be built into 
the evolution of the brain itself.
Conclusions
The scientific story of predictive processing is still 
evolving, but many researchers believe this approach 
has ignited a paradigm shift in neuroscience. Here, we 
have proposed that this paradigm shift has important 
implications for psychological science, both in theory 
and in practice. The mind is a computational moment 
in a brain that creates a temporally continuous trajec-
tory of neural activity, tasked with regulating a body in 
the world. Appreciating this perspective may improve 
the quality of our scientific findings and also offer 
opportunities for new discoveries about the nature of 
the human mind.

Appendix
Standing on the shoulders of giants: 
the rich history of internal models
Since psychology’s emergence as an empirical science 
in the mid-1800s, research has largely relied on a stimu-
lus (S) → organism (O) → response (R) model of the 
mind (Danziger, 1997). Yet this model has consistently 
been questioned through the ages (Barrett, 2009). Kant 
(1781/1929) proposed that we experience the world 
through a web of our own concepts, as did the seventh 
century Buddhist philosopher Dharmakı¯rti and the 11th 
century Islamic philosopher Ibn al-Haytham. At the dawn 
of psychological science, von Helmholtz’s (1860/1924) 
idea of unconscious inference and Dewey’s (1896) criti-
cism of the reflex-arc concept cautioned against an SOR 
model of the mind. Decades later, Craik’s (1943) and 
Johnson-Laird’s (1983) internal models, and Tolman’s 
cognitive maps (1948) all proposed, in different ways, 
that internal mental representations such as beliefs and 
knowledge influence subsequent perception and action 
at least as much, if not more than, the other way around. 
Early studies on attention posited that the degree to 
which a stimulus elicited an orienting response was 
related to how different it was from a “nervous model” of 
that stimulus based on past experience (Sokolov, 1963). 
The hypothesis that internal representations are hypoth-
eses that play a key role in perception and action formed 
the basis of the cognitive revolution (e.g., Gregory, 1980; 
Neisser, 1967), and within social psychology, implicit atti-
tudes, stereotyping, and prejudice are predicated on the 
idea that information inside the head shapes experience 
of and action in the world. A major benefit of predictive-
processing-related accounts of psychological phenomena 
is that they are usually embedded within an anatomi-
cal or a computational framework, allowing, for the first 
time, a more direct assessment of their common (or dis-
tinct) implementations and consequences.
