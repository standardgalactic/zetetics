Abstract 
 
Early Childhood Education is a field experiencing rapid growth in professionalism and research. 
This growth places pressure upon schools and teachers to meet state standards and to use the 
criteria of Quality Rating Systems to evaluate teachers. This study offers expanded resources for 
the art of teaching through an examination of learning dispositions (also known as approaches to 
learning) to support teachers as they broaden their practice and relationship with students. It 
offers teaching strategies to influence the development of learning dispositions, tendencies or 
habits of thinking that influence behaving or speaking in a manner that satisfies or moves a 
person toward a learning goal (Katz, 1988, 1993b). This study specifically examines curiosity 
and new dispositions of risk-taking and voice. Strategies for influencing learning dispositions in 
teacher-child interactions are revealed through discourse analysis of a highly rated teacher of 
young children. An argument is made for the inclusion of risk-taking and voice. Risk-taking is a 
foundation for problem-solving.  Voice, the right to be heard, contribute and have influence, is 
the foundation for expressing opinions and identity. The study suggests further research for risk-
taking and voice as learning dispositions that empower frequently marginalized cultural, 
linguistic, and racial groups. Children who are supported in acquiring affective learning 
dispositions can experience enhanced learning trajectories.

Chapter One: Introduction 
 
What was it about that preschool teacher? There was learning occurring beyond the skills 
of painting, asking questions, and interacting. The teacher’s proximity and attentive listening 
affirmed students’ experimentation and discovery of print transfer and promoted creativity and 
curiosity. I observed as she moved around the classroom and how she talked with the children 
about the process of painting, encouraged the children’s creativity, motivation, independence and 
curiosity. She affirmed persistence when she returned to a child for an engaging conversation 
regarding her painting. I witnessed powerful learning in action. It happened like this: 
“Teacher Look!” “We were just playing with paint, and look, it makes a double!” 
shouted two excited four-year olds about their paint transfer discovery. When they laid a second 
paper over their tempera painting and pressed, it transferred to a second paper. Near these two 
girls was another girl, who, rather than announce her pleasure at this event, tucked her chin 
down and continued to focus on the paint transfer discovery. This quieter preschooler finished 
two paintings, hung both pieces of art on the drying rack, and created another. After she 
completed the third, she looked toward the teacher, then stood quietly beside the teacher seeming 
to wait for the teacher to notice her. The teacher’s attention was directed toward louder children 
who were either requesting attention or requiring attention for a disagreement or problem, but 
she did not ignore the quiet child beside her. After attending to the loud children, this teacher 
quietly turned to the girl and softly asked her about her art. At that moment, the little girl 
chattered away about her discovery of paint transfer and showed the teacher all the color 
combinations she had created.  
Through what she said and did, this teacher demonstrated support of learning dispositions, 
creativity and curiosity, and independence and persistence.

I have observed hundreds of teachers in my thirty years as director, principal, preservice 
supervisor, and research consultant. There were many preschool teachers with whom children 
developed skills and increased in knowledge. Then there were teachers who seemed to increase a 
child’s ability to learn. What were those teachers doing and how did they do it? 
Problem Statement 
As I explored the possibilities of how preschool teachers’ practices may increase a child’s 
ability to learn, I thought about other teachers whose work inspired learning dispositions. 
Teachers told me, “I listen deeply” (S. Lazaroff, personal communication, 2018) or “I really hear 
them” (M. Z. Cortina, personal communication, 2016). 
When I was a research consultant, I visited over 40 preschool classrooms in Arizona and 
administered the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) (Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 
2008). This assessment tool focuses on interactions between teachers and students and what 
teachers do with the materials they have. It evaluates how teachers provide emotional and 
instructional support through positive climate, sensitivity, concept development, quality of 
feedback and language modeling (Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008). But it did not answer my 
question of how teachers influence learning dispositions. I wanted to better understand how the 
teacher-child interactions in early childhood education influence the development of learning 
dispositions. Through observation and close analysis of a single teacher, this study builds an 
understanding of how teacher discourse as seen and heard through the moment-by-moment 
interactions influences children’s learning dispositions.  
Learning dispositions. Learning dispositions (or the parallel term - approaches to 
learning) are a recognized domain in early childhood education (Barbu, Yaden Jr., Levine-
Donnerstein, Marx, 2015; Kagan, 2002; McClellan & Katz, 2001). They are defined as the 

 
14
tendencies or habits of thinking that influence behaving or speaking in a manner that satisfies or 
moves a person toward a learning goal (Katz, 1988, 1993b). Learning dispositions such as 
curiosity, persistence, independence, and resilience are indicative of an effective learner 
(Bertram & Pascal, 2002). They enable the enactment of knowledge and skill and act as an 
affective and cultural filter for learning trajectories (Carr, Jones, Lee, Smith, Marshal, & Duncan, 
2010, p. 15). They are environmentally sensitive and acquired, supported, or weakened by 
interactive experiences in an environment with significant adults and peers (Bertram & Pascal, 
2002). Experiences in early childhood education (ECE) programs can influence the development 
of learning dispositions whether by “intention or by default” (Katz, 1977, p. 66). Not to be 
confused with teaching dispositions, I define learning dispositions as observable behavior(s) or 
expressions of moving toward a learning goal. Learning dispositions describe how a child learns, 
as opposed to what a child learns. For young children, birth through age eight, learning to learn 
serves as a solid foundation for a lifetime of discovery, building knowledge and comprehension.  
Research indicates the importance of both learning dispositions and qualities of teacher-
child interactions to future academic success (Burchinal, Peisner-Feinberg, Pianta, & Howes, 
2002; Katz, 1988; 2002; Pianta, 1997). Research also suggests that learning dispositions are 
potentially alterable via the teacher through either modeling or direct instruction (Fantuzzo, 
Perry, & McDermott, 2004). The communication system, or teacher discourse (Cazden, 2001), 
appeared as the place to examine the influence of the teacher on learning dispositions. I needed 
to look at both verbal and nonverbal communication in early childhood education. Peter Johnston 
(1991) says teacher discourse can ignite the spark to learn and I wondered if teacher discourse 
could also ignite learning dispositions. The purpose of this study is to better understand how 

 
15
teacher-child interactions in early childhood education influence the development of learning 
dispositions. 
Early childhood education and learning dispositions. The development of learning 
dispositions is important in ECE because birth to age five is viewed as a critical period for 
developing the foundations for thinking, behaving, and emotional well-being (Trawick-Smith, 
2014; Woolfolk & Perry, 2012). By age five, a child’s brain size is approximately 90% of adult 
size (Dekaban and Sadowsky, 1978) and 95% of maximum size by age 6 (Lenroot & Giedd, 
2006). Learning dispositions developed in early education, in this period of rapid brain growth, 
can affect a child's lifetime learning trajectory (Hamre & Pianta, 2001; Daniels, 2013). Because 
learning dispositions are potentially alterable via the teacher through either modeling or direct 
instruction (Fantuzzo, Perry, & McDermott, 2004), teachers of young children are uniquely 
positioned to positively affect the development of learning dispositions. This study builds our 
understanding of how the teacher-child interactions in ECE are linked to learning dispositions. 
Learning dispositions are named as an essential component of early childhood education 
(Kagan, 2000; Katz, 1998). Many in the field call for an increased emphasis on learning 
dispositions and diminishing the “focus on curriculum frameworks which view education as the 
injection of facts, subjects and disciplines of knowledge alone” (Bertram & Pascal, 2002. p 56). 
For example, the learning disposition of curiosity can be as important as the single task of 
learning the names of animals. Naming animals is a learning task in ECE; curiosity is a learning 
disposition generalizable to all learning tasks. Learning dispositions enable learning tasks 
(Bertram & Pascal, 2002). In this way, developing a behavior that supports learning (a learning 
disposition) is arguably more important than single task learning. Learning dispositions have 
been linked to motivation and engagement (Buchanan, McDermott, & Schaefer, 1998), and 

 
16
improvements in academic and interpersonal skills, and therefore are foundational to all future 
learning and make a child ‘ready’ for their academic career. 
Readiness. Research also reveals that learning dispositions strongly impact kindergarten 
readiness (Hamre & Pianta, 2001; Marx, 2011). Readiness is a commonly used educational term 
generally defined as the skillsets a child needs to attain to be ready for kindergarten – the official 
entry into formal education (grades K -12) and is defined independently by each U.S. state. 
Studies claim kindergarten readiness as an important reason for funding early childhood 
education because children’s experiences prior to kindergarten influence future educational 
experiences and attitudes (Heckman & Rubinstein, 2001, Marx, 2011).  
Research includes learning dispositions as an important component of readiness (Biggs, 
1987; Carr, 2001b). A child who is ready for kindergarten has not simply mastered skills of 
literacy, mathematical knowledge, social ability, and impulse-control (Claxton & Carr, 2002), 
but is fully exercising their learning dispositions and is ready, willing and able to learn (Carr et 
al., 2010). Readiness for kindergarten includes strategies for learning, basic early literacy skills, 
cognitive abilities, and learning dispositions, and research in kindergarten shows a link between 
early learning behaviors in kindergarten and improvements in annual grade transitions and long-
term academic achievement (Li-Grining, Votruba-Drzal, Maldonado-Carrefio, & Haas, 2010; 
Matthews, Kizzie, Rowley, & Cortina, 2010; McDermott, Rikoon, & Fantuzzo, 2014; von 
Suchodoletz, Trommsdorff, Heikamp, Wieber, & Gollwitzer, 2009). In this way, learning 
dispositions established in early education can affect the learning trajectory.

Early Childhood Education versus Kindergarten-12 Education 
This section of the introduction describes the unique position of ECE in a lifetime of 
learning and builds the argument for the support of learning dispositions in the first five years of 
life. 
Overview of ECE versus K-12. In the continuum of lifetime learning, ECE’s most 
critical years are from birth to age five. From birth, a child is continuously learning from their 
parents and caregivers both implicitly and explicitly. In the United States, according to the 2000 
census, 67% of children from birth until kindergarten experience care outside of the home 
environment. Care outside the home also occurs along a continuum, from small group home care 
to ECE centers with 20 or more classrooms of 15 or more children. These settings can range 
from places where a child is safe and fed to educational settings that are licensed and staffed with 
teachers expressly educated to teach young children. When a child is five years old, many 
options exist, and formal or explicit learning continues in the structure of a publicly or privately 
funded school from kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12). After 12th grade, formal education 
continues by choice in the form of higher education (Community College or University) or in the 
form of career/job/skill/art training. Throughout life, learning continues either implicitly or 
explicitly, formally or informally. This study focuses on early learning in an educational setting 
from birth to age five when learning is both explicit and implicit. Children develop learning 
dispositions in all stages of education, but the research cited above supports an emphasis on 
learning dispositions rather than skill and knowledge learning in the first five years of life. 
ECE and K-12 education are specifically different and variably the same. ECE and K-12 
are both conducted in age-based peer groups (with some exceptions), include a leader of 
education, and have a named curriculum or course of study. ECE diverges around philosophy of 

 
18
education, assessment, teacher qualifications, funding, and group size. This discussion focuses 
on ECE philosophies grounded in developmentally oriented practices that attend to the whole 
child, and support the physical, social, and emotional development of young children (Copple & 
Bredekamp, 2008). In ECE, a child-centered approach focuses on the empowerment of the child, 
including developing skills for success by enabling children to be active and independent 
learners, helping parents to support the development of their children, and relying on effective 
teachers (Schweinhart & Weikart, 1995). The early childhood years are particularly positioned 
for the development of learning dispositions because at this age a child’s brain is in a stage of 
rapid development and their drive toward learning dispositions may outpace their physical 
ability. Thus, they may be unable to complete tasks that involve certain skill types, such small 
motor ability for handwriting, ocular control for reading, and impulse control for the table work 
and rote assimilation of curriculum that is a hallmark of K-12 learning. Thus, this stage of early 
development is prime time for the development of tendencies or habits of thinking that influence 
behaving or speaking in a manner that satisfies or moves a person toward a learning goal – 
learning dispositions (Katz, 1988). 
Assessment. Young children’s learning and development is assessed through surveys 
(e.g., Ages and Stages, Teaching Strategies Gold, the Devereaux ECE assessment, and others), 
but there are no standardized tests as found in school and post-secondary school that answer to 
entities such as local and state school boards. These K-12 standardized tests are often high-stakes 
tests allowing the student to progress to the next level, gain entrance to another program, or 
influence funding for the school or salaries for the teachers. ECE programs keep anecdotal 
documentation of their children, checklists of developmental stages and skills, and coach social 
and emotional development, but these data are generally for internal use only. Through 

 
19
observation and documentation, teachers can influence a child’s motivation toward learning. 
Active documentation and the absence of high-stakes standardized testing is a trademark of early 
childhood education. 
Evaluation of centers and schools. Rating systems exist for early childhood education, 
but they differ from K-12 schooling systems ECE programs have external rating systems that 
evaluate the whole program, including items such as: sustainable business model, fitness of 
facility, quality of interactive materials, and quality and education level of the teachers. Highly 
rated ECE programs are similar yet different from highly rated elementary and secondary 
education programs. Each are rated, but each examines different data sets. Elementary and 
secondary schools measure the academic abilities of the students based on a standardized test, 
and these scores rank the teacher. ECE is measured on resources available to the child and the 
quality of the teacher is measured by observing the teacher in the act of teaching. The ECE 
ratings are designed to increase high quality education by measuring data that a teacher or school 
can possibly control and this includes child-teacher engagement influencing learning 
dispositions. Scoring teachers by the achievement of their students as found in K-12 education 
does not account for class size differentials, the effect of poverty and trauma on the students’ 
mental fitness, or for educative resources available to the teacher. ECE documents growth of the 
child and fitness of the teacher; K-12 education assesses the academic output of each child. 
Teacher qualifications. One glaring difference between ECE and elementary and 
secondary education is the required qualifications for teachers. Early education currently does 
not require that teachers be certificated to teach in a childcare center, as does K-12 education. 
Early educators who teach in a public-school setting must have state certification, but the entry-
level requirement for basic childcare is a high school diploma, a fingerprint clearance card, and 

 
20
18 hours documented experience with young children. Head Start provides professional 
development for their teachers and recently has required the attainment of an Associate of Art or 
Associate of Science degree in Early Childhood Education. Some ECE teachers intuitively 
influence children’s learning dispositions by wondering aloud with children about their interests 
and promoting children’s motivation to manage uncertain moments and develop curiosity, 
resilience, and voice. It is likely that a teacher with a specialized college degree is better able to 
influence learning dispositions than a high school graduate because they have greater knowledge 
and specialized teaching preparation. ECE teachers earn 60% less than K-12 teachers with fewer 
options for benefits. There is a movement in ECE to professionalize the field, require advanced 
degrees, and increase compensation. 
School funding. Also missing in ECE is universal public funding. K-12 education is 
government-funded, but only a small sector of ECE receives government support. For example, 
the federally funded program, Head Start, provides free ECE to children whose families live 
below 200% of the poverty level (Office of Head Start, 2020). Highly competitive Federal 
Preschool Development Block Grants are issued to about 12 economically needy states every 
three year (First Five Years Fund, 2020). Additionally, there is governmental support for 
preschools in public schools to provide mandated early education for children with identified 
developmental delays including speech, cognitive, and physical delays (Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act, 2020). Typically, the families of these children pay tuition at these 
public-school settings. In many states, the Department of Economic Security provides preschool 
subsidies for families who meet specific economic criteria. However, outside these economic 
supports for low income families and children needing developmental support, the funding does 
not meet the needs of all families who need or want to work outside the home, and thus need 

 
21
childcare but can’t afford quality care. The lack of governmental funding may contribute to the 
range in quality in early education. ECE centers which are in economic stress may be teaching at 
a level of safety and control and are less equipped to enter into children’s discourse and engage 
their learning dispositions. Equitable funding is an issue in both ECE and K-12 education, but 
the variability in accessibility is greater in ECE. 
Curriculum choices. Curriculum choices differ between K-12 education and ECE. K-12 
curriculum is generally selected by a school board or superintendent for classroom use. ECE 
centers select their own curriculum and may adopt a commercial peer-reviewed curriculum.  K-
12 education tends to be designed for large blocks of students (generally state by state, district by 
district or school by school), and uniformity is also seen when a single textbook serves blocks of 
states or even the whole nation. Conversely, ECE is local education, with each learning site 
individualizing curriculum to meet the needs of their students. Preschools can select a curriculum 
and pedagogical style that meets their vision for the specific school. Some schools adopt 
philosophies such as Waldorf, Montessori or the Reggio Emilia Approach. Generally, each 
school (or Head Start grantee) can select their own philosophic framework and pedagogy.  
Classroom lessons. ECE teachers tend to set the day-to-day curriculum to meet the needs 
of their specific children within a framework of early learning standards. These standards in 
Arizona name objectives for teachers to work toward (AZELS, 2018). ECE focuses on social and 
emotional development as a child learns to engage with peers and adults other than family 
members. Children engage in math concepts as they build with blocks and count groups of toys 
or objects. They engage in early literacy through conversations, using writing tools (crayons, 
pens, pencils) to communicate through symbols, shapes, or drawings. Some children begin 
writing their ideas in preschool, and most learn to write their name. Children learn to express 

 
22
themselves through art experiences, singing, dancing, dramatic play, and communicating with 
the people in their school. Science is learned through noticing life in plants and animals, and 
noticing characteristics of various natural objects such as rocks, leaves, and formations in the 
sky. Physics learning begins with play at the water table, balancing blocks, using rope to pull, 
and testing their strength to leverage themselves onto climbing equipment. Story is included 
every day, including oral stories, read-aloud from books, and narrations of drawings. Throughout 
this broad array of curricular choices, the teacher can influence learning dispositions through 
careful observation for learning goals and engaging discourse to move them toward their 
learning goal.  
Group size. Group size is also different along the continuum of education. Class size is 
determined by the number of children enrolled in each specific school district resulting in some 
districts with class sizes of fewer than 25 students, and other districts with class size swelling at 
over 32 per class. Early childhood education, however, benefits from state health department 
requirements for group size, and many choose even lower group sizes because research shows 
smaller group size and larger square footage per child positively effects learning (NAEYC, 
2019). The lower the teacher-child ratio, the better situated the teacher is to engage in 
influencing learning dispositions. Each school site or care facility determines its own class size 
based on their resources. Because ECE is a business as well as a service, many centers must 
choose between making a profit or quality care with smaller class sizes.  
Philosophies of education. While ECE remains independent from center to center, and 
often from teacher to teacher, the focus on the whole development of each child remains 
constant. This study focused on one teacher whose teaching philosophy was grounded in 
constructivism. Constructivism refers to the thinking of Piaget, Vygotsky, Dewey, and Bruner in 

 
23
which learning is continuous, social, active and reflective.  In constructivism, students transfer 
key concepts to new situations built upon prior knowledge. It is the foundation for the Reggio 
Emilia Approach, which is the one studied by the teacher I observed. This approach holds that 
the 
 
learner possesses rights, is an active constructor of knowledge, and is a social being; the 
instructor is a collaborator and co-learner along with the child, a guide and facilitator, and 
a researcher; and knowledge is viewed as being socially constructed, encompassing 
multiple forms of knowing, and comprised of meaningful wholes (Hewett, 2001, p. 95) .  
As a teacher in an early learning classroom, the subject of my study is uniquely positioned to 
influence children’s construction of learning dispositions.  
An Overview of this Study  
This study examined how a teacher influenced learning dispositions. A single case, 
qualitative analysis of a preschool teacher identified the words and actions that connected to the 
development of children’s learning dispositions. Using grounded theory and open coding this 
discourse analysis investigated teacher discourse strategies for influencing learning dispositions. 
This study observed an early educator in a classroom of 4-year olds over seven days. 
Video and audio recording across the school day included whole group direct teaching, small 
group instruction, and 1-1 interactions. Recordings were transcribed, coded and analyzed. 
Teacher discourse was gathered in direct observation (field notes), video transcripts, and two 
teacher interviews. The analysis utilized grounded theory to understand the relationship between 
teacher discourse and learning dispositions.

Overview of the Dissertation 
This dissertation is broken into three parts. The first part (Chapters 2-3) introduces the 
conceptual (analytic) framework and methods, the second part (Chapters 4 - 6) presents data 
analysis and findings, and Chapter 7 includes discussion and conclusion. References and 
appendixes (including complete coding tables) conclude the document.  
 
Specifically, Chapter 2 reviews relevant literature surrounding many aspects of learning 
dispositions and more specifically curiosity, risk-taking, and voice. This chapter concludes with 
an explanation of the theoretical framework and research question. Drawing on socio-cognitive 
theory (Vygotsky, 1978), I argue that learning dispositions can be influenced in the relationship 
and engagement between the teacher and child. I draw specifically on Vygotsky’s zone of 
proximal development and scaffolded learning (Vygotsky, 1978). Chapter 3 outlines my research 
process. First, I explain my study design and then describe the setting for the study, including the 
school setting, case study subject, and study group. Next, I provide my methods for collecting 
and analyzing data. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 present my findings focused on the learning dispositions 
of curiosity, risk-taking, and voice. Each chapter includes a brief introduction to the specific 
learning disposition followed by series of data excerpts in the form of tabled transcripts related to 
that learning disposition with analysis of the data. The analysis includes the discourse strategies 
the teacher utilized to influence that particular learning disposition. I conclude each chapter with 
a discussion of the gaps in the literature and arguments for the inclusion of this research. Finally, 
in Chapter 7, I discuss the addition of risk-taking and voice to the corpus of learning dispositions. 
This argument for two new learning dispositions is followed by my response to my research 
question, naming and describing teacher influences on the development of learning dispositions. 

 
25
Multiple teacher strategies for supporting learning dispositions are revealed in this study. The 
chapter concludes with ideas for further research and limitations of this study.

Chapter 2: Literature Review 
 
This literature review establishes the relevance and critical importance of learning 
dispositions (LD) in early childhood education (ECE). The research suggests that teachers may 
be able to influence LDs through either modeling or direct instruction (Fantuzzo, Perry, & 
McDermott, 2004). However, what has not yet been explored is how teacher-child interactions 
are linked to learning dispositions. This review defines the purpose of this study – to examine the 
ways in which early educators can influence and develop, or conversely, diminish learning 
dispositions in ECE. 
Literature Sources 
Studies, articles, and books for this review were identified though Google Scholar and the 
University of Arizona (UA) library searches of learning dispositions (commonly used in 
international research) and the related term approaches to learning (more commonly used in the 
U.S.). However, I did not reference habits of the mind (Costa & Kallick, 2008) because its 
definition did not fit my working definition of learning dispositions. I also searched specific 
dispositions including curiosity, persistence, independence, and resilience. These words were 
selected due to their prominence in the literature related to ECE. The UA research librarians and 
my advisors supported my search as well. The database ERIC.ed.gov produced some related 
topics. Additionally, a search of citations in selected articles yielded studies on effective 
learning, learning behaviors, task behaviors, and approaches to learning. Some research exists 
referencing the need for teacher-child relationships to motivate learning dispositions. The need 
for my study is demonstrated in the many articles that call for further research on learning 
dispositions in ECE and how teacher-child interactions relate to learning dispositions (Marx, 

 
27
2001; Barbu, Yaden Jr., Levine-Donnerstein, & Marx, 2015; Claxton & Carr, 2004; Hyson, 
2008; Kagan, Moore, & Bredekamp, 1998). 
Learning Dispositions Definition 
Learning dispositions are observable behaviors, such as curiosity, persistence, creativity, 
or initiative, that display purposeful expression of movement toward a learning goal (Katz, 
1988). These behaviors are the manifestations of personalized patterns of thinking that influence 
behavior and/or speech (McDermott, Rikoon, & Fantuzzo, 2014). Katz and Raths (1985) clarify 
the term ‘disposition’ by distinguishing it from other personal characteristics such as traits, skills, 
attitudes, and habits. Learning dispositions can describe children’s strategies for mastering skills 
and behaviors that indicate ways children become engaged in learning. They are observed when 
a child can recognize, express, use, or master behaviors that explicitly demonstrate movement 
toward learning goals they are developing as part of their learning dispositions.  
Observable behaviors. Observable behaviors are children’s actions that can be noticed 
by careful observation of children engaged in work or play with their peers, materials, or 
learning engagements (group reading, assigned writing, teacher directed experiments, etc.). 
These behaviors include not only physical actions, such as painting a picture or arranging dolls, 
but also any verbal or nonverbal communication such as talk, pointing, or other gestures 
(Fantuzzo, Perry, & McDermott, 2014). For example, when a child says, “I’m going to see what 
happens when I place a piece of paper on my wet painting,” the child is engaging in the 
observable behavior of curiosity. This behavior and speech are an expression of curiosity 
because the words ‘going to see what happens’ indicate that the child is wondering or curious 
about what the effect of her action will be. The observable behaviors documented in this study 
are those that represent a purposeful expression of movement toward a learning goal. 

 
28
Purposeful expression. Purposeful expression is an intentional communication or 
display of thinking. Purposeful expression can be observed directly when a child’s spoken words 
indicate the child’s intent toward a learning disposition. However, when the expression is an 
action or behavior, the intent of a child’s behavior may not be explicitly known. At such times, it 
is essential to observe the child more carefully, noticing details such as eye gaze, non-verbal 
communication (Johnston, 2004), preceding statements or the results of behavior, or gaining 
information from multiple perspectives to understand the purpose of the action (Carr, et al. 
2010). An observer can infer purposeful expression by noticing the strategies the child uses as 
well as the choices of words and actions that signal the child’s intent of moving toward a 
learning goal (Carr, et al. 2010). 
Learning goal. A learning goal is a skill, action, understanding, or idea that a child seeks 
to acquire or master (Carr, et al. 2010). The learning goals of young children are found in 
domains such as social learning, physical skills, auditory skills, verbal skills, and academic 
learning. Children’s learning goals can include skills such as balancing on a beam, negotiating 
turn-taking with a peer, cutting with scissors, and pre-literacy skills such as identifying symbols, 
deciphering sounds, drawing or writing, and early math skills such as sorting by attribute, 
counting, ordering by scale, and manipulating geometric shapes (blocks). Learning goals are 
determined by the child, but teachers and policymakers also play a part in setting them for 
children. Teachers create learning objectives, and policymakers create learning standards. 
Children can move toward learning goals determined by anyone, but it is through the act of 
choosing a learning goal that a child makes it their own.  
 
Learning goals are not performance goals. A learning goal differs from a performance 
goal. A learning goal as defined above is an internally motivated task (skill, action, 

 
29
understanding, or idea) that a child seeks to acquire or master. How a teacher ignites a child’s 
internal motivation toward a learning goal supports the development of learning dispositions. In 
contrast, according to Dweck (1985), a performance goal, which is externally motivated, is 
concerned with how the task is accomplished and involves seeking to do the task well. A child’s 
motivation often is seated in accomplishing the task with the goal of an external reward. Dweck 
argued that an individual’s behavior in a particular situation displays their orientation toward a 
performance goal or a specific learning goal. This study examines how a teacher influences a 
child toward a learning goal. 
Sample Learning Dispositions  
There is no one universally accepted group of learning dispositions. In fact, in the U.S., 
learning dispositions are often referred to as approaches to learning. Examples of various sources 
of learning dispositions are shown in Table 1.

‘Learning Disposition’ Qualified 
 
The table above demonstrates the range and variety of learning dispositions. These 
variables are related to the purpose of the author or agency in specifying these learning 
dispositions and the intent for their use. Numerous studies (AZ Early Learning Standards, 2018; 
Kagan, 2002; Copple & Bredekamp, 2009) naming learning dispositions as key components to 
success name dispositions that are more easily measured. For example, independence can be 
measured more objectively by the number of times and duration of time a child takes an 
independent action as opposed to imagination, which is an elusive and more subjective 
disposition to measure. There are also some dispositions seemingly agreed upon, such as 
independence, resilience, and creativity. Table 1 provides an understanding of the current fluidity 
in both understanding and research of learning dispositions. 
Note that some sources refer to learning dispositions as approaches to learning; however, 
the two terms are not interchangeable because they vary some in their definitions and use. 
Approaches to learning are defined as distinct sets of behaviors that indicate ways that children 

 
31
become engaged in classroom learning activities (Fantuzzo, Perry, & McDermott, 2004). The 
term ‘approaches to learning’ is frequently found in policy and teaching textbooks, especially in 
the U.S. (e.g., see Arizona Early Learning Standards [AzELS, 2013]). Research embracing 
approaches to learning observes the end product instead of the process of a child working toward 
a learning goal. Approaches to learning have a more quantitative viewpoint on children’s 
learning and tend to focus on a wide age range of students in a context of subject and clinician 
(McDermott, Rikoon, & Fantuzzo, 2014; Mokrova, Brien, Calkins, Leerkes, & Marcovitch, 
2013). In contrast, the term learning dispositions (Carr, 2001; Fantuzzo, 2005; Katz, 1999) 
appears more frequently in ECE classroom qualitative research and focuses on the lived 
experience, “the result of any transaction between people and the world, emphasizing the 
subjective significance of the situation on the person” (Esteban-Guitart & Moll, 2014, p. 33). In 
other words, research on learning dispositions looks at children in the context of the totality of 
the confluence of their classroom experience and their social, cultural, and experiential world 
(DaRos-Voseles & Moss, 2007). The more qualitative view of learning dispositions makes it 
more appropriate for ECE research, for it enables a more holistic view of young children’s 
learning (Hamre & Pianta, 2001) and is an expression of a child’s thinking. Thus, in this study, I 
have elected to use the term learning dispositions in order to capture the process of learning as 
expressed in learning dispositions. 
Specific Learning Dispositions 
Examples of some specific learning dispositions are described below: 
● Curiosity – a view of self as interested, with the expectation that people, places, and 
things can be interesting; it demonstrates motivation to understand (Engel, 2011; Claxton 
& Carr, 2004; Katz, 1998). 

 
32
● Independence – a view of self as competent to work toward a task with limited support – 
to self-manage (Claxton & Carr, 2004; Katz, 1998). 
● Persistence – a view of self as someone who persists or continues working with a task 
past the expected time of completion or in spite of opposition (Claxton & Carr, 2004; 
Katz, 1998). 
● Creativity – the view of self as a communicator (expressing ideas) or innovator in a wide 
range of contexts (speaking, painting, constructing, drawing, singing, dancing, etc.). This 
learning disposition is cross listed as imagination (Bertram & Pascal, 2002; New Zealand 
Ministry of Education, 1996).  
● Resilience – a view of self as someone able to return to or persist with a problem despite 
setbacks. Similar yet different than persistence because resilience is an ability to recover 
from or adjust easily to misfortune or change (Claxton & Carr, 2002). 
● Engagement – a view of self as someone who is attentive and gets involved and remains 
engrossed or focused. It is often linked with persistence when a child demonstrates the 
ability to attend to relevant stimuli and persevere with difficult tasks (New Zealand 
Ministry of Education, 1996).  
● Problem-solving - the view of self as strategic with flexible approaches to a task or 
problem (Marx, 2011; McDermott, Green, Francis, & Stott, 1999). 
● Responsibility – a view of self and others as people with rights; to take another point of 
view beyond self (Bertram & Pascal, 2002; Carr, 2001; DaRos-Voseles & Fowler-
Haughey, 2007). 
● Decision maker – a view of self as able to measure choices and make a decision (Claxton 
& Carr, 2004). 

 
33
Other dispositions appearing in the literature are not included in this review as learning 
dispositions because these do not explicitly move a young child toward a learning goal. For 
example, social dispositions such as acceptance, friendliness, empathy, generosity or 
cooperativeness (Katz & McClellan, 1997) describe social behavior and are important 
dispositions for socialization but do not represent explicit movement toward a learning goal.  
Three Learning Dispositions 
Three learning dispositions emerged from the analysis of this data: curiosity, risk-taking, and 
voice. A brief review of the literature associated with these learning dispositions follows. 
 
Curiosity. Curiosity may be the most obvious learning disposition, and it is frequently 
associated with uncertainty. Jirout and Klahr (2012) specifically defined “curiosity as the 
preferred level of uncertainty – or the amount of uncertainty that will lead to question asking or 
exploratory behavior” (p. 5). They also reported that the child’s amount of uncertainty or 
cognitive conflict leads to question asking or exploratory behavior. Uncertainty is one of the 
factors that prompts curiosity (Berlyner, 1979; French & Woodring, 2013; Meta, 2016), but 
uncertainty alone does not prompt curiosity. Other studies indicated the degree or amount of 
uncertainty that prompts curiosity is also important (Shah, Weeks, Richards, & Kaciroti, 2018), 
while few have investigated how to apply the idea of the quantity of uncertainty to promote 
curiosity in early education. 
Curiosity begins in infancy, when children test their theories about how things work by 
collecting data— trying out different actions on the world and watching to see what happens 
(Gopnik, Meltzoff, & Kuhl, 2000). Not only are they curious about people, but their curiosity is 
influenced by those around them (Engel, 2014). Toddlers with secure attachments (Bowlby, 
1969) exhibit more curiosity as they get older (Saxe & Stollock, 1971), and the importance of 

 
34
attachment or relationship continues as children develop. Pre-kindergarten children studied in 
home settings who asked questions for factual information better remembered information 
received as a result of a question and continued seeking explanations as they grew older 
(Chouinard, Harris, & Maratsos, 2007). Perhaps this time of intense curiosity is due to a 90% 
increase in brain development occurring in the first five years, but that is a topic for another 
study. 
 
Known influences on curiosity. In a study of preschool and elementary school students, a 
direct link was found between how much the teacher smiled and talked in an encouraging 
manner and the expressed level of curiosity of the children (Hackman & Engel, 2002). Another 
study found smiling and making approving comments also positively influenced curiosity 
(Moore & Bulbulian, 1976). These friendly and approving ways of interacting influenced 
curiosity. In fact, Engle and Hackman (2002) used the terms ‘active interest cognition’ or 
‘focusing condition’ to describe an experimenter who is extremely attentive and encouraging of 
the student’s behavior with smiles, eye contact, and occasional interjections (p. 634). Cues from 
preschool teachers therefore definitively influence curiosity, and when children go to school, 
their impulse to explore and inquire remains subject to subtle cues from adults about what is 
appropriate (Bassok & Engle, 2014). This research specifically illustrates the effect that teachers 
can have on curiosity. 
Adult modeling of curiosity is critical in encouraging children to follow their hunches 
and questions in a productive manner (Bassok & Engle, 2014). Adults can encourage children’s 
curiosity, but preschool teachers often do not modify their questions to the ability level of the 
child and mainly ask low-level questions (Hestenes, Cassidy, & Niemeyer, 2004). When the 
quality of the questions is low, curiosity is minimally influenced. In a study of the teacher 

 
35
questioning and feedback in 3,000 preschool classrooms, it was found that the interactive 
feedback lacked conceptual focus (Pianta, Howes, Burchinal, Bryant, Clifford, Early, & 
Barbarin, 2005). Clearly, teachers need strategies for creating classroom discourse and feedback, 
including question construction, that focus children on ideas and concepts they may be curious 
about. One can conclude that in these preschools with low-level questioning, curiosity is not 
being enhanced. Strategies for modifying questions to meet the ability level of young children 
needs further study. 
The teacher’s interest can become a figurative bridge of curiosity between uncertainty 
and knowing. In fact, according to Bar-Anan, Wilson, & Gilbert (2009), “Events that are either 
too familiar and easily understood, or too novel and difficult to understand, may not spark 
people’s interest. A moderate degree of novelty and incomprehensibility may be most likely to 
induce curiosity” (p. 126). When a teacher wonders aloud with children, explores their questions 
and comments, and listens deeply, she induces a level of cognitive curiosity, that is, of children 
being curious about their own ideas.  
With young children, cognitive conflict, or the noting of contradictions and process of 
equilibration (Resnick, 2017), is often induced by teachers’ open-ended questions. This can then 
lead into activities addressing those questions, and modeling question-asking behavior can help 
children recognize uncertainty and ask questions themselves (Zimmerman & Pike, 1972). This 
strategy of not giving direct answers to questions is common in early education. Open-ended 
questions can lead to curiosity. The types of questions that prompt curiosity are studied in early 
education, but there is a gap in the literature regarding the role the teacher plays, actually being 
the question herself, positioning herself as uncertain, and spontaneously asking questions to 
prompt curiosity.  

 
36
Curiosity is also influenced by the space and time for children to ‘mess around with’ 
materials (Claxton, Edwards, & Scale-Constantinou, 2006; Wasserman, 2009) or play with 
‘loose parts’ (Maxwell, Mitchell, & Evans, 2008; Sutton, 2011). The types of objects a teacher 
selects to present or offer students can also influence curiosity. Similar to the findings related to 
novelty mentioned above by Bar-Anan et al. (2009), Renninger (1992) found that certain objects 
invited more exploration than others, concluding that interest and curiosity are closely related. 
Presenting an object, materials, or ideas that are uncertain can also influence curiosity. For 
example, in the Reggio Emilia Approach, a provocation (Rinaldi, 1998) is the presentation of a 
problem (object, materials, or task) that is big enough and hard enough to interest and challenge 
a child (Edwards, Gandini, & Forman, 1998). As found in the work of Dewey (1923, 1938) and 
Piaget (1976), knowledge is formed through direct experience, and experience requires time. 
This literature tells us a great deal about increasing children’s development of curiosity through 
open-ended, provocative materials and providing sufficient time to be curious. Few have 
investigated strategies for developing curiosity in a preschool teacher’s discourse.  
 
Risk-taking. Risk-taking is an action or expression in which the child considers the 
outcome. Carr (2002) described risk-taking as “engaging with uncertainty, being prepared to be 
wrong, risking making a mistake—going on learning” (as cited in Stephenson, 2003, p. 41). Risk 
involves concern about the process or outcome. Risk-taking can also include cognitive and social 
risks in the form of expression. In other words, a child could perceive a cognitive risk of failing, 
of not succeeding, of making a mistake, or as not being seen as smart. They could also be 
concerned about feeling embarrassed in front of the class or making a mess. In this way, 
cognitive or social risks involve negotiating concern, uncertainty, or worry about the outcome 
and taking the risk regardless of perceived consequences. 

 
37
Risk-taking appears in the literature of outdoor and nature play (Harper, 2017; Rivkin, 
1995; Stephenson, 2003). In a traditional sense, the idea of ‘minimizing risk’ is an insurance and 
liability issue for schools, and it also invokes health and safety policy issues. Incorporating risk-
taking as a learning disposition requires a positive understanding of risk. Stephenson stated that 
“undertaking ‘risky’ activities is an integral part of children’s drive to extend their physical 
prowess and so their independence,” and that children “hunger for physical challenge” (2003, p. 
38). Malone & Ruder (2017) stated that taking risks is fundamental to independence; in fact, 
building independence may require mastering risk-taking experiences. Can that risk-taking be 
encouraged in classroom and playground engagements to enable children to experience the 
challenge and mastery that comes with risk-taking experiences? These researchers argued for the 
importance of undertaking ‘risky’ activities, but the literature does not focus on specific teacher 
strategies in school settings that influence risk-taking. 
 
Voice. The word ‘voice’ has multiple meanings. Merriam-Webster (2019) defined it as 
communication, the sound or sounds uttered through the mouth of living creatures, especially 
human beings when speaking, shouting, singing, etc. The second dictionary definition of voice is 
a universal right that utilizes communication and facilitates the exchange of knowledge between 
individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behaviors (Merriam-Webster, 2019). 
A simple example of voice in an early education classroom is when a teacher gives children the 
opportunity to voice their opinion about which book to read through voting or tally making. The 
children are offered a system for expressing their opinion. This form of voice as an expression of 
opinion, will, choice, desire, or right is used in this study. It is foundational to participation, 
expression of ideas, and sense-making. In fact, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of 

 
38
the Child names freedom of expression as a fundamental right in Article 131, stating that children 
have the right to communicate, express their ideas, and be heard (Assembly, U.G., 1989). The 
development of voice is essential if we are to view children as citizens of the world and not view 
“children’s identity as citizens in waiting” (Malone & Rudner, 2016, p. 5). Young children who 
learn to voice their opinions and concerns 
 become citizens of their classroom. 
 
Voice as learning disposition. Voice can be named as a learning disposition because it 
enables the enactment of knowledge and skill. Voice can reside with commonly named learning 
dispositions such as curiosity, persistence, independence, and resilience (Bertram & Pascal, 
2002; Katz, 1988) as well as confidence, courage and curiosity, trust and playfulness, 
perseverance, and responsibility (Carr, 1998). Voice can be incorporated in the pantheon of 
learning dispositions because it is an observable behavior that displays purposeful expression of 
movement toward a learning goal (Katz, 1988), and through voice, a child can make their 
knowledge or skill understood. 
In this way, voice can serve as an affective and cultural filter for learning trajectories 
(Carr et al., 2010, p. 15) because expressions of opinion, will, choice, desire, or right are 
grounded in a child’s lived experience (Esteban-Guitart & Moll, 2014). Just as voice can be 
supported by interactive experiences in an environment with important adults, such as parents 
and educators, and peers, it can also be weakened by these same influences (Bertram & Pascal, 
2002).  
Couldry (2010) emphasized that voice is an ongoing social process of exchanging 
narratives that always involve speaking and listening. In this manner, voice can be understood as 
 
1 Article 13: The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing 
or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice 

 
39
socially grounded, performed through exchange, and subject to power struggles and social roles 
(Noppari, Uusitalo, & Kupiainen, 2017). These social or intellectual exchanges are often 
observed as the purposeful expression of movement toward a learning goal (Katz, 1988). 
Similarly, the enactment of social roles incorporates voice, and voice can resolve power 
struggles. 
Voice also gives children the ability to influence and make decisions about what and how 
something is learned in order to expand their capabilities. Adair (2014) defined this ability to 
influence as agency, noting that young children can use their voice and agency to increase or 
diminish their capacity to make autonomous choices that help them determine unit topics; 
experiment and engage in open-ended exploration and conversation; plan projects or help their 
friends with ideas; explore materials, text, and other resources to generate content; and use their 
curiosity as motivation and inspiration for inventing, planning, designing, and problem-solving. 
Voice precedes agency, and their further development is entwined.  
One issue to consider is whether or not children have real choices in preschool. The 
Danish researcher Gulløv (2003) formulated the ambiguity in preschool as the coexistence of 
both surveillance over children and acknowledgement of the notion of children’s self-
management (Markström & Halldén, 2008). These Scandinavian researchers focused on the 
agency of children and how they try to take control. The researchers not only observed how 
children appropriate power, but also how they are allowed the space and initiative to do so. The 
preschool is their space, but the time they spend there is regulated by decisions made by their 
parents and the staff. In what ways are children viewed as competent to negotiate activities and 
also to negotiate having some time and space of their own? As Corsaro (2017) and Danby and 
Baker (1998) showed, negotiation is a part of a child’s daily interactions in preschool, between 

 
40
children and between children and adults. The development of voice helps support the 
development of agency and the ability to negotiate. Once a child finds her voice, agency can 
emerge, and from her voice is the identity of agency. This literature skillfully illuminated the 
importance of agency; however, the significance of finding voice to enable agency has yet to be 
revealed. 
 
Communication as a socially situated activity motivates voice as a child’s social 
expression. Communication in preschool classrooms requires mutual participation (Sfard, 2015) 
between child and teacher or child and child. A study by Daniels (2013) described the child’s 
learning as expressed in a book of photographs and narratives. This book served as a tool for 
communication and child-parent mutual participation, while reflecting on the book was an 
expression of voice. Related to Carr’s (1989) concept of shared focus, when two or more people 
are focused and in dialogue about the same subject, the mutual participation facilitates learning 
as a socially mediated process. Through interactions and communication with the people in their 
classroom, young children develop the learning disposition of voice. This leads to 
communication that shares focus or encourages mutual participation, which engages children 
with ideas and tools that enable their voice and the social process of learning (Sfard, 2015; 
Vygotsky, 1978). Voice as the expression of ideas, opinions, and desires is the enactment of 
thinking, and it influences learning. 
Having established that communication can be activated by voice, and communication is 
socially motivated and linked to learning, voice is therefore linked to learning. This connection is 
supported by Vygotsky’s socio-cultural theory that cognition occurs through participation in 
culturally specific, tool-mediated, historically established ways of executing various life tasks 
(Vygotsky, 1978). Vygotsky focused on what people say and do together while participating in 

 
41
daily activities. The saying and doing found in preschool classrooms through mutual 
participation in activities as observed in the teacher-student relationship is communication. Thus, 
by participating in communication, thinking and voice are developed. Forming opinions, 
expressing choices and rights, and having will are essential learning dispositions. 
Policy Gap 
 
Learning dispositions have policy, socio-emotional, and academic implications. In policy, 
they are referenced in teacher preparation literature and early learning standards. The National 
Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) requires documentation of how 
preservice teachers use, nurture, and assess children’s dispositions (NCATE, 2006). As 
previously established, The Arizona Early Learning Standards and the New Zealand National 
early education curriculum, Te Whāriki (Carr, 2001), named the approaches to learning in their 
policy. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) identified 
approaches to learning (learning dispositions) as one of the five aspects of school readiness that 
“focused on the how rather than the what of learning” (Copple & Bredekamp, 2009, p 15).  
While this literature clearly values learning dispositions, it reveals little about how to 
develop learning dispositions. They are called for (or named) in policy, but little guidance for 
teachers is offered. For example, the Arizona Early Learning Standards (AzELS) call for the 
development of learning dispositions in the form of approaches to learning. These standards 
state, “curiosity is a prerequisite of the scientist, and problem- solving is as necessary for social 
relationships as they are for mathematics” (AzELS, 2013, np). They stated that learning 
dispositions allow children to acquire “new knowledge, learn new skills, and set and achieve 
goals for themselves,” and that they are “one of the most important domains of early childhood 
development” (AzELS, 2018, np). Nevertheless, in this 233-page document, there are only 25 

 
42
pages describing them, while there are 41 detailed pages dedicated to Language and Literacy 
complete with teacher strategies for promoting Literacy. It does offer concise indicators and 
examples of approaches to learning, but no teaching strategies similar to those found in Literacy. 
NAEYC promotes 12 principles of developmentally appropriate practice. Number 12 
explains that “children’s experiences shape their motivation and approaches to learning … 
[which]… affect their learning and development” (Copple & Bredekamp, 2009, p. 15), but this 
document fails to offer strategies to develop learning dispositions. Policy standards call for the 
inclusion of learning dispositions in early education, but they are weakly described and there is 
little offered in the way of guidance or strategies regarding enactment of LD’s. 
Learning Dispositions’ Connection to Outcomes 
 
Academic success. A substantial body of research links learning dispositions to future 
student academic success. More specifically, a positive link has been shown between approaches 
to learning in kindergarten and individual trajectories of reading and math performance in first, 
third, and fifth grades (Li-Grining, Votruba-Drzal, Maldonado-Carreño, & Haas, 2010). For 
example, independence was found to be related to school success in a study of 70 longitudinal 
studies (Pianta & McCoy, 1997). Persistence was a driving factor in the development of early 
cognitive-linguistic skills in three-year olds’ academic skills two years later, over and above 
demographic factors (Mokrova, O’Brien, Calkins, Leerkes, & Marcovitch, 2013). Learning 
dispositions developed in early childhood are linked to future academic success.  
The effects of learning dispositions on socio-emotional development are also linked to 
academic success. Children’s cooperation, independence, and classroom participation are 
important predictors of early school achievement (Ladd, Birch, & Buhs, 1999). The development 
of learning dispositions, such as assertiveness, leadership, and independence, influences socio-

 
43
emotional growth and impacts children’s ability to participate in peer engagement in learning 
(Morrison, 2017). Independence, persistence, and focus or engagement influence the 
development of social-cognitive skills linked to social emotional development and set the 
trajectory to future academic success (Daniels, 2003).  
Thijis and Koomen (2008) also positively linked learning dispositions with academic 
success through socio-emotional growth. For example, a child will often make use of persistence 
in pursuing a friendship instead of giving up after the first try. In a similar manner, a child who is 
independent of their parent can be curious about the world or engage in learning beyond their 
emotional needs. Young children whose teachers provide support in times of stress develop more 
emotional security and show more task persistence and independence (Davis & Peters, 2012; 
Klem & Connell, 2004; Thijis & Koomen, 2008). The importance of learning dispositions to 
socio-emotional development is foundational to both a child’s social development and their 
academic achievement. 
 
Mitigating socio-economic factors. Another study found that children’s attention (the 
learning disposition of engagement or focus) in preschool partially mediated the link between 
specific family characteristics (family income as related to family size, maternal educational 
level, and child gender) and children’s achievement (NICHD ECCRN, 2006). This research 
suggests that the learning dispositions of engagement and focus can support a child’s learning 
and mitigate socio-economic factors such as low income and low education level of mother. 
Recent research suggests a plausible connection between the learning disposition of engagement 
and executive function, a predictor of academic success (Lawson, Hook, & Farah, 2018). 
 
 

 
44
Development of Learning Dispositions 
 
Non-teaching strategies. As established earlier, learning dispositions are well defined, 
and policy calls for their enactment; however, teaching strategies for the development of LD’s 
are few. The examples that follow demonstrate currently available research regarding the 
development of LDs in learning environments, classroom communities, and classroom materials. 
The learning environment influences the development of learning dispositions through the 
materials, the arrangement of physical space or classroom for learning, the choices of 
engagements (activities) the teacher establishes, and the types of access children have to the 
learning environment (Ellis, 2005; Edwards, Gandini, & Foreman, 1998; Strong-Wilson & Ellis, 
2007). Within the learning environment, classroom communities (children, family, and teachers) 
stretch learning dispositions whenever multiple viewpoints of a child’s learning dispositions are 
documented and shared with children and offer learning opportunities within relationships (Carr 
& Claxton, 2002). 
In children’s classrooms, research on learning dispositions in ECE reveals their presence 
in play (Claxton, 2008) and their enactment in peer relationships (McDermott, Rikoon, & 
Fantuzzo, 2014; Roorda, 2012; Thijs & Koomen, 2008). These environmental, physical, and 
social contributions to learning dispositions are available to teachers, but they fail to provide 
guidance on teacher discourse. 
 
Role of the teacher. The early educator can support the enactment of learning 
dispositions. Not simply a conveyor of content and manager of children, the teacher’s role is to 
value children’s ideas, efforts, spaces, and work to maintain the child’s enthusiasm toward their 
own learning (Futomo, 2002). Thus, teachers can influence the development of learning 
dispositions by making them visible to the community of learners (including the children 

 
45
themselves) and by developing specific strategies and materials that influence learning 
dispositions. 
According to Fantuzzo, Perry, & McDermott (2004), a teacher’s discourse can be a 
significant influence in the development of learning dispositions. Additionally, teachers can 
influence learning dispositions by shaping the learning context to include interactive experiences, 
such as dyadic events that occur between teacher and child, and fully integrated learning in a 
peer pair or group. The teacher can explicitly influence learning dispositions through their 
actions and organization of the learning environment (both physical and social), and their can 
implicitly influence learning dispositions through their classroom discourse (Li-Grining et al., 
2010; Thijs, Koomen, Roorda, & Hagen, 2011). In other words, a teacher can influence learning 
dispositions overtly by labeling the actions and ideas with the names of learning dispositions, or 
they can enact a learning disposition, thus modeling the disposition for children. 
 
A specific study. An example of learning dispositions made visible is found in Daniels 
(2013) photographic project, ‘Learning Journeys’. In this project, she created personalized books 
for each child, which were equally accessible to teachers, families, and children. Each book or 
journal featured photographs and narratives of the child engaged in learning (e.g., problem-
solving a block building, exploring a bee in a flower with a magnifying glass, or persevering at 
hammering a nail). The Learning Journey documented evidence of a child’s learning 
dispositions, and it created a context for the child and family to jointly reflect on the child as a 
learner – a communal act supportive of the child’s thinking and self-esteem. When the child 
understood their learning disposition expressed in the journal, the parents and child could then 
jointly reflect (Bush, 2006) on the disposition through the journal. The Learning Journeys served 
as a tool for meta-cognition of learning through which families, teachers, and children discussed 

 
46
the child’s learning dispositions. Daniels (2013) showed the power of shared focus (joint 
viewpoint) to develop learning dispositions and demonstrated the empowering action of actively 
engaging children and families in discussions of learning dispositions. In this way, the role of the 
learning environment, classroom communities, and classroom materials influencing learning 
disposition development becomes visible. Through Learning Journeys, a classroom teacher 
conducted the orchestration and manifestation of environment, communities, and materials to 
make learning dispositions visible.  
 
The need to be intentional. Cooper, Hedges, and Dixon (2014) intended to replicate 
Daniel’s finding that teacher-parent interactions supported the development of learning 
dispositions. Cooper et al. (2014) set out to examine the teacher’s role in learning disposition 
development as a visible component of New Zealand’s early childhood education curriculum of 
Te Whāriki. The childcare center in this study implemented curricular guidance through both the 
Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE) (Gerber, 1979) and Te Whāriki (NZ Ministry of Education, 
1996). Cooper et al. (2014) found a contrast between teachers’ roles in these two curricular 
approaches. The RIE approach, founded on the belief that every child has a right to be respected 
as a capable and competent individual (Gerber, 1979), emphasizes uninterrupted play without 
unnecessary interference from adults, while Te Whāriki informs teachers to view all children as 
competent, confident learners and to support and guide their learning through warm interactions 
(NZME, 1996). In short, Te Whāriki values community interactions, whereas RIE values 
independence. 
In their study, the teachers supported the children’s independent learning and in 
accordance with RIE, did not explicitly encourage curiosity, persistence, exploration, and 
autonomy. These learning dispositions were only stated in interviews and in children’s 

 
47
portfolios. In other words, the ‘Don’t interrupt” philosophy of RIE led to limited dispositional 
learning through interactions with teachers. The teachers only communicated with parents about 
childcare related information (number of bottles, diapering, and temperament report for the day) 
with little evidence of parents’ reflection on, or participation in, dispositional development. The 
care providers wrote about the learning dispositions but did not work to enact them with 
children, nor did they talk with parents or offer shared reflections on learning dispositions. 
The study by Cooper et al. (2014) raised the tension between naturally developing 
learning dispositions as stated in RIE, and teachers’ and parents’ interactional and relational 
experiences. There was little evidence of how the teachers were reflecting and shaping children’s 
orientations toward learning or learning dispositions as stated in Te Whāriki, or how teachers 
were sharing the children’s learning dispositions with parents. This limited sharing of learning 
between the teacher–family was a hindrance to the enactment of Te Whāriki and a barrier to 
nurturing learning dispositions. In this ECE center, the non-interrupting teacher, though 
following her interpretation of the assigned RIE curriculum, did not implicitly or explicitly 
influence learning dispositions. This study demonstrates the effect of minimal interactive 
relationships with children and their families. When these relationships are weak, learning 
dispositions are inhibited. The teacher-child interaction, engagement, and use of materials are all 
contexts for the development of learning dispositions. 
 
Theorized teacher strategies. In addition to the empirical work cited above, Claxton and 
Carr (2004) theorize strategies early educators use in developing learning dispositions. They 
describe how teachers influence learning dispositions through expanded use of stories, 
interviews, video clips, photographs, and pedagogical documentation. Teachers in Claxton and 
Carr’s study clearly explained and made explicit the learning curriculum; they orchestrated the 

 
48
resources and activities of the classroom creating an inviting and engaging environment; they 
commented on the learning process and the outcomes, which direct the child’s attention toward a 
reflection of their learning; and, finally, they modeled the responses of an effective learner. In 
short, the teachers (Claxton and Carr, 2004) created learning opportunities for the meta-cognition 
of learning dispositions when they made the learning explicit, focused the children on their 
learning dispositions, and created opportunities for a shared view of learning dispositions with 
family, teacher, and child. These studies point to strategies teachers can use to develop learning 
dispositions, but these are big picture strategies not found at the level of teacher discourse. There 
is a gap in the literature regarding teacher behavior influencing or affecting learning dispositions. 
Further research is needed describing what teacher moves are best for particular dispositions. To 
my knowledge, there is no examination of how teacher discourse may affect learning discourse. 
My dissertation looks at how teacher discourse influences children’s learning 
dispositions. Teacher’s words and actions can influence, affirm, nurture or diminish learning 
dispositions in early childhood education. That teachers can encourage student’s learning 
dispositions is not disputed (Hamre et al., 2012), but research is limited regarding how teachers 
encourage, affirm, or possibly diminish children’s learning dispositions.  
Theoretical Framework 
 
 
Socio-cultural theory of cognitive development. Vygotsky’s socio-cultural theory 
provides the theoretical framework for this dissertation because of the connection between social 
interaction and culture and cognitive growth in young children (Vygotsky, 1978). The theoretical 
framework for this study follows theoretical threads from various developments in socio-cultural 
theory and carries them to organizational learning processes and a socio-cultural perspective of 
cognitive development. This framework begins with Vygotsky, moves on to Luria’s (1976) work 

 
49
on semiotic mediation, to Bernstein’s theory (2000) on the structuring of pedagogic discourse, to 
Wertsch’s ideas (2010) about the juncture of cognitive processes shaped by social engagement 
and leading to higher level thinking. The framework ends with defining socio-cognition in the 
context of organizational theory. This is defined as similar but different from Bandura’s (2001) 
socio-cognitive theory. 
Socio-cultural theory affirms that the early years of ontogenesis involve the interaction of 
natural or biological development and the culture or context in which development occurs 
(Vygotsky, 1978). Considering the various ecological systems (Bronfenbrenner, 1977) or 
contexts in which children live, they experience a variety of social and cultural interactions. 
These include family (primarily in the early years), peers, neighbors, school, and social groups 
(religious practices, clubs, associations, etc.). In each context, children engage with the social 
and cultural experience of that context. The early education classroom is the context for this 
study. Children engage with the social and cultural experience of schooling as they are 
developing and growing cognitively. This study examines how learning dispositions are 
influenced in the subjective zone of children’s experience and teacher discourse. 
Luria took up Vygotsky’s theory work on semiotic mediation (the use of signs and 
symbols as mediation tools for language) and advanced the idea of visible semiotic mediation. 
This was defined as conscious discourse aimed at a specific line of thinking related to classifying 
and categorizing within the context of the social experiences of the mediator and the mediate 
(Luria, 1976). These mediation tools could be writing, semaphores, objects, or images. Visible 
mediation stands in contrast to invisible mediation (Bernstein, 1990) which attended to “how the 
unself-conscious everyday discourse mediates mental dispositions” (Hassan, 2002, p. 12). 
Invisible mediation is mediation that occurs in discourse embedded in everyday ordinary 

 
50
activities of a person’s life and references language, body language, and other non-verbal 
systems or tools of communication. Discourse implies communication that is socially situated 
and that sustains social "positionings" or relations between participants in face-to-face 
interaction. Bernstein states that this code-regulated discourse is a regulator of cognitive 
functions and it is “also central to the shaping of dispositions, identities and practices” 
(Bernstein, 1990, p. 3). However, the analysis of social and class-regulated coding (Hassan, 
2002) is not the focus of this study which uses discourse in terms of a ‘small d’ (Gee, 2010). This 
study examines the teacher discourse of words, actions and semiotic mediation, and how they 
influence learning. Central to the shaping of dispositions, visible and invisible mediation is 
foundational to the idea that the interactions and communication of a teacher with children 
influence learning dispositions. What a teacher says and does impacts children, and how and why 
they speak and act influences learning dispositions. Theoretically, a teacher’s affect and 
discourse contribute to the shaping of a child’s learning dispositions. 
A teacher influences children’s cognitive development as it occurs internally (invisibly) 
and in relationship with external influences (visibly). In the context of social relationships, or 
socio-cultural perspective, learning is a process of apprenticeship into social practices (Moll & 
Greenberg, 1990; Rogoff, 1990; VanDijik, 2001; Wertsch, Del Rio, & Alvarez, 1995). 
According to Wertsch (2010), when a cognitive process originates in social action and is shaped 
by semiotic mediation, the thinking is transferred to the individual plane and contributes to 
shaping higher mental processes. Looking at language use as an important semiotic system, 
Vygotsky emphasized human communication as critical to the development of cognitive 
processes (Wertsch, 2010). This study examines human communication as found in the 

 
51
interactions of a teacher with her students, specifically how children participate in, and 
appropriate language and social processes.  
The socio-cognitive perspective (Akgün, Lynn, & Byrne, 2003), developed within 
organizational learning, defines a process developed by, and manifested in, the web of individual 
interactions and cultural structures in the organization (Allard-Poesi, 1998). Social cognition 
investigates the cognitive mediators of social interaction to analyze the learning processes of 
people (Martin & Clark, 1990; Tory Higgins, 2000). The framework for this study is inclusive of 
socio-cultural theory of cognitive development, emphasizing visible and invisible mediation, 
adds social engagement as a mediator of cognitive development, and acknowledges the cognitive 
mediators of social engagement as contributors to the learning process.  
In the social and physical context of ECE classrooms, the students, teacher, learning 
materials, and experiences provide the context for learning. These classroom engagements and 
interactions occur non-verbally, verbally, and socially. Focusing on the social and cognitive 
engagements between the teacher and child in the context of the classroom as zone for learning, 
this study examines teacher discourse and how it influences the development of learning 
dispositions in the socio-cognitive context of an ECE classroom.  
The idea of social-cultural theory of cognitive development should not be confused with 
Bandura’s (1986) social cognitive learning theory emphasizing an idea that learning occurs 
through watching other people (social) and is processed in the mind (cognitive). These theories 
are similar in how they both involve a learner and another person; however, Bandura’s theory 
relies on observation and imitation, whereas Vygotsky’s involves two people in relationship with 
one another. In 2009, Bandura said biology is not the only influence, and he emphasized that the 
pressures of social and technological innovation must not be ignored as influences shaping 

 
52
human development and evolution. However, Bandura’s behaviorist tendency does not fit in the 
constructivist framework of this study. 
 
Zone of proximal development. Within socio-cultural theory, Vygotsky (1978) coined 
the term “zone of proximal development” to explain the relationship between learning and 
development. Commonly referred to as the ZPD, it is the area between what a child knows and 
can do alone and the area a child does not know but can reach with the assistance of a trusted 
other (Bodrova & Leong, 2007). The assistance given to a child may be in the form of clues and 
hints, rephrasing questions, or asking what they understand. The ZPD is not static and shifts as a 
child’s thinking and knowledge increases. The framework of the ZPD works well for this study, 
which examines the influence of a teacher on the development of learning dispositions. This 
dissertation analyzes what a teacher, as a trusted other, says and does while interacting with 
children both inside and outside of the classroom. The teacher is the trusted other supporting the 
child’s growth. 
 
Scaffolding. Scaffolding is an appropriate concept to employ in this study to analyze the 
engagement between teacher and child. A trusted other or expert can offer scaffolding within a 
child’s ZPD to assist the child in learning (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976). According to this 
theory, as the teacher and child engage, the teacher physically structures the activity for the child 
or provides explicit verbal directions to direct the child. The child’s understandings are shaped, 
and learning occurs through repeated joint participation in an activity, which is often mediated 
by discourse (Hicks, 1995).  Additionally, the adult gradually does what Cazden (1983) terms 
upping the ante, (or increasing the amount of engagement). The teacher ups the ante or builds 
upon previous knowledge in a hierarchal manner adding more as the child learns. A key to 
scaffolding is enlisting the child’s interest (Bodrova & Leong, 2007). Wood et al. (1976) also 

 
53
suggested a teacher’s provision of scaffolding may vary. The literature cited in this paragraph 
supports the use of the term scaffolding to analyze teacher discourse when considering how a 
teacher influences learning dispositions. 
Research Question 
Socio-cultural theory of cognitive development, including the concepts of ZPD and 
scaffolding, focuses on how people learn through interactions and engagements. This dissertation 
examines how children’s learning dispositions are influenced through social engagement. 
Numerous studies (Baker, 2006; Bertram & Pascal, 2002; Cooper et al., 2012; Downer, Sabol, & 
Hamre, 2010; Cooper, Hedges, & Dixon, 2014) showed that teachers can encourage student’s 
learning dispositions, but research is limited regarding how teachers accomplish this. This study 
will use a form of discourse analysis to examine how teacher discourse influences learning 
dispositions. Specifically, it asks the following: “In what ways do teachers of young children 
nurture and support learning dispositions?”

Chapter 3: Methods 
 
 
In this study, my data were the videos and transcripts of teacher discourse in an ECE 
classroom and playground for three and four-year olds in Arizona. I analyzed these data using 
thematic analysis (Glesne, 2011), looking for themes and patterns to create theories about ways 
in which this teacher influenced learning dispositions. 
Overview 
This chapter describes my sequence of work exploring my research question. I begin by 
explaining my study design and then describe the research site, participants, data collection 
procedures, and data analysis. The chapter concludes with researcher perspective and limitations. 
Study Design 
In this study, I observed a single preschool teacher and analyzed how her teaching 
discourse relates to children’s learning dispositions. Specifically, I examined what she did and 
said in her role as teacher that supported or diminished learning dispositions. This examination 
of teacher discourse through direct observation, video, interviews, and thematic analysis (Glesne, 
2011) seeks to understand how a teacher’s interactions as well as direct and indirect 
communications are connected to children’s learning dispositions. 
Context. This study required a location where I was likely to observe learning 
dispositions being developed. My first criterion was to select a preschool teacher, followed by 
choosing a site with cultural diversity and low SES. Cultural diversity would minimize the 
chance that learning dispositions could be culturally specific. Observing a population with low 
SES would minimize the possibility of this study positioning learning dispositions as concurrent 
with economic privilege. 

 
55
Case study participant. The teacher, MC (pseudonym) was selected because of the 
quality of her interactions and relationship with children. MC has a BA in psychology and a 
minor in education, with K-8 certification. She was awarded Outstanding Teacher of Young 
Children 2015 by the local affiliate of the National Association for the Education of Young 
Children. I noticed her engagements with students were based on the children’s interests, and the 
teacher-child relationship appeared strong. I chose MC because of her indications of teaching in 
support of the development of learning dispositions. 
Site. This study examined teacher-child relationships in a preschool classroom. This 
natural setting (Creswell, 2014) was a place where the interactions related to learning 
dispositions were observed as they occurred. The site was an early childhood education 
classroom located in an elementary school within a public-school district. The school is set 
within a demographic region in proximity to a major Southwestern University within 200 miles 
of the US/Mexico border. This school had a diverse student population.  The school was 50% 
Hispanic, 19% White, 17% Black, 4% two or more races, 4% Hawaiian Native/Pacific Islander, 
and 1% Native American; 88% of the school was eligible for free or reduced lunch (Great 
Schools).  
Classroom. The preschool classroom was licensed by the state and was participating in 
this state’s Quality Improvement Rating System2 (QIRS). This classification assures alignment to 
a set of state standards for curriculum and teacher qualifications. The year of my study, the class 
had 18 four-year-old children who spoke the following languages as L1: Farsi (2), Spanish (2), 
Nepali (2), Burmese (2), Mandarin (1), English (8), and Arabic (1) (teacher communication, 
2018). MC, the lead teacher, was my primary subject, and she also had an assistant, both of

56
whom spoke English as a first language, and some Spanish. The class had a 1:9 teacher to 
student ratio. 
Schedule of the day. This preschool day started at 8:00 a.m. and ended at 11:00 a.m. 
Parents brought their children to the classroom, or the students arrived by bus. The first 15 
minutes of arrival activities were followed by large group time (morning circle), when the 
teacher read to the group or taught. Next, the children went outside to a preschool playground for 
30 to 40 minutes, then went back inside for snack time. The next part of the morning was called 
‘investigations’, a small group time when the teacher interacted with groups of two to four 
children in a learning center (block area, painting easel, drawing, etc.) and there were occasional 
moments of one-to-one interactions. MC was observed both in the classroom and on the 
playground. The open classroom setting allowed many opportunities to observe her in teacher-
child interactions. 
Data Sources 
I collected or created five main sources of data: field notes, interviews, video recordings 
of the school day, video transcripts, and transcript tables. Additional information from the school 
webpage about the students in this school included race/ethnicity and the number of children 
who bought full price lunch; the latter allowed approximating those who receive free/reduced fee 
lunch. The teacher gave me anecdotal information about the children’s home language and 
educational support provided at school. 
Data was collected from an ‘observer as participant’ perspective (Glesne, 2011). As an 
observer, I had some interaction with the study participants (the teacher and the students) and 
reacted and responded as appropriate in answering simple questions, helping hold a door, or 
smiling to a child who was watching me. By minimizing the observer effect (Ary, Jacobs, & 

 
57
Sorensen, 2010), I could assume the role of authentic-observer-participant. It was my goal to 
enable the teacher-child interactions to proceed naturally. 
Field notes. The first day of classroom observation only contained field entries 
documenting behavior and activities (Creswell, 2014). These notes were open-ended and helped 
me fine tune video and audio recording procedures. On filming days, the field entries were 
written in the same notebook and reviewed as needed for confirmation of engagements or 
sequence. 
Interviews. Two semi-structured interviews (Creswell, 2014) were conducted with the 
teacher. The initial semi-structured interview, which took place before the first video, gathered 
background information and elicited views and opinions (Creswell, 2014). The closing interview, 
conducted at the conclusion of the filming, further expanded on MC’s initial views and opinions. 
Both occurred in the familiar space of the teacher’s classroom to establish a conversational 
atmosphere. These interviews established familiarity and provided direct and indirect 
information (Prokos & Fontana, 2007). The pre-interview structure gave me the opportunity to 
better understand MC’s background, philosophy of education, and sense of her view on this 
group’s strengths and challenges (See Appendix A, Pre-Interview). The post interview was an 
opportunity for further insights and understandings about early education. (See Appendix B, 
post-interview). 
On-site data collection schedule. Data collection began with meeting the parents, 
explaining the study, and obtaining consent (Appendix C). MC welcomed me into the class and 
introduced me to the parents as a trusted colleague. I introduced myself, explained the research 
project, and distributed consent forms in English, Spanish, and Arabic. Two days later, I visited 
the classroom, collected the forms, and observed the group for the remainder of the day without 

 
58
filming. This day of observing allowed me to chat with parents and children to develop a basic 
level of rapport. 
 
Simultaneous video and audio recording occurred on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and 
Friday (teacher planning day occurred every Wednesday) for two weeks during the preschool 
day from 8:30 -11:00 a.m. for a total of seven days. The entire morning was recorded to capture 
the directed teaching and the moments of informal learning. Events during the school day 
included the following: arrival when the teacher-child relationship begins for that day, direct 
teaching or ‘circle time’, investigations (a time of free choice of engagements), snack time, 
outdoor play, and formal and informal one-to-one conversations. 
All video content was reviewed on the day it was recorded to check the accuracy of the 
recording and inform decision-making about future filming locations, lighting issues, and voice 
recording issues. All teacher-child interactions and engagements were considered for 
transcription. The interactions I did not transcribe were those that were directive during a 
transition, had voice quality too poor to be understood, or were private. Examples of private 
conversations had to do with a child’s anxiety at home, the loss of yet the third pair of glasses, 
and the scheduling of special services. Conversations between MC and other adults were not 
transcribed, and conversations with a person without consent were not included in the data.  
The camera ran for specific sections or events of the day and not continuously for the 
whole time. I turned the camera off to avoid filming during the moving transitions between 
activities or location (inside or outside) when video quality would be poor. For example, I filmed 
whole engagements around spin art, the whole morning circle, and specific events on the 
playground. In this manner, the continuous flow of each engagement was recorded. These 
sections became the transcripts that then became the position coding Tables. 

 
59
Video recordings of the school day. The visual recording documented verbal and non-
verbal communication (Neill, 1991) as well as proxemics, or how people use the space around 
others (Glesne, 2011, p. 69). The video and audio data recorded classroom interactions using a 
Bluetooth microphone on the teacher and a video camera. The Bluetooth lapel microphone 
allowed the teacher a full range of motion because there is no cord. It also recorded ambient 
voices in specific situations, such as one-to-one interactions with a child or in a small group. In 
small group situations, it was important to pick up the children’s words that were part of the 
dialogue. I moved with the camera when the teacher was moving and placed the camera on a 
tripod when she was stationary. I viewed the videos the evening they were recorded in case I had 
follow-up questions. There was a total of 549.64 minutes of video. 
Video transcripts. The largest body of data consisted of the transcripts generated by the 
video and audio recordings of the teacher in the course of the school day. I transcribed the early 
recordings then created audio files that were sent to REV (www.REV.com) for transcription to 
expedite the process. I reviewed the transcripts, added action or non-verbal data, and changed all 
the names to pseudonyms. I also revised REV’s transcriptions for accuracy regarding children’s 
language they missed or misunderstood, to assure accuracy of the transcripts. 
The transcriptions of the verbal communication along with non-verbal communication 
became the corpus for the theme analysis. Additional communication with the teacher in the 
form of member checking occurred through email or in person to determine the accuracy of the 
data and findings (Creswell, 2014). This data set was designed to provide the opportunity for 
close analysis of the teacher-child interactions that influenced learning dispositions. 
 
 

 
60
Analysis  
Overview. This research study used coded theory method (Creswell, 2014; Marshall & 
Rossman, 2006). From an inductive analysis of the data, I constructed concepts around the 
development of learning dispositions (Ary, Jacobs, & Sorensen, 2010). The overall sequence 
included: data analysis beginning with organizing the transcripts, creating tables for coding each 
transcript (Appendix D), reading and writing about the data, coding, data reduction through 
connecting the themes, and interpretation. Each chapter in this study focuses on a different theme 
or learning disposition. The data is represented in Tables with closely inserted analysis followed 
by an analysis discussion of the theme represented by each specific set of data. 
Data analysis. Data analysis occurred in six major steps: transcript transfer to a table for 
coding, memo writing for underlying meaning, open coding for learning dispositions, chunking 
themes, cross-checking themes, identifying three significant themes, and interpretation of these 
themes.  
First, I transferred each transcription to a table to better identify learning dispositions. 
This table included: 
● who was speaking; 
● what they said, what happened, and other descriptors such as facial expressions, voice 
tone, and body position; 
● learning disposition possibly being developed at this moment; 
● notes, other details, or thoughts about this event or subtle actions. 
 
The tables for coding each transcript are found in Appendix D. The initial open coding 
occurred after tabling each transcript using a systematic approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). 
Using the definitions for each learning disposition as listed on page 21, I reviewed each tabled 

 
61
transcript, coded, labeled and categorized chunks of transcript whenever that specific chunk 
indicated an enactment or encouragement of a learning disposition. Using this format, I 
identified chunks when the teacher influenced or affirmed the learning dispositions of:  
● Creativity – the view of self as a communicator (expressing ideas) or innovator in a 
wide range of contexts (speaking, painting, constructing, drawing, singing, dancing, 
etc.). This learning disposition is cross-listed as imagination (Bertram & Pascal, 2002; 
Te Whāriki, 2001).  
● Independence – a view of self as competent to work toward a task with limited 
support – to self-manage (Claxton & Carr, 2004; Katz, 1998). 
● Curiosity - a view of self as interested, with the expectation that people, places, and 
things can be interesting; it demonstrates motivation to understand (Claxton & Carr, 
2004; Katz, 1998). 
● Persistence – a view of self as someone who persists or continues working with a task 
past the expected time of completion or in spite of opposition (Claxton & Carr, 2004; 
Katz, 1998). 
The themes of curiosity, independence, persistence, and creativity were based on the learning 
dispositions I had identified in the outset of this study because they appeared most frequently in 
the literature. The coding table used in this study enabled me to not only identify the explicit 
words and delivery the teacher used, but also the teacher’s overt and subtle actions and their 
possible implied meanings. Below is a sample of a transcript and its corresponding coding table

In step two, I also wrote memos on sections of the transcript to familiarize myself with 
the data and significant teaching events. This writing process occurred simultaneously with the 
transcript transfer and served to focus my analysis on learning dispositions. Next, I reduced the 
data (Guest, MacQueen, & Namey, 2012) by grouping chunks from all the Tables into the major 
themes (Marshall & Rossman, 2006) of curiosity, independence, persistence, and creativity. In 
step four, these chunks of transcripts were hand-coded (Creswell, 2014) against the definition of 
each of these four learning dispositions by placing each chunk with its matching theme according 
to my code definitions (Appendix D). This step provided particular as opposed to generalizable 
analysis (Greene & Caracelli, 1997) of each chunk. A written definition of each learning 
disposition physically posted to my computer helped avoid code drift (Creswell, 2014). Finally, I 
cross-checked the coding (Creswell, 2014) with experienced researchers to assure agreement on 
the codes associated with each transcript chunk. At this point, I assumed the findings would be 
interpretations of the data supporting each of these four learning dispositions; however, except 

 
64
for curiosity, the data did not fit these learning dispositions. Curiosity remained as a theme for 
analysis, but through my analysis the learning dispositions of risk-taking and voice emerged. 
Three learning dispositions analyzed for findings.  Ultimately three learning 
dispositions were selected for analyzation and interpretation with the goal of determining how 
the teacher was influencing the development of learning dispositions. The selection process for 
these three learning dispositions is explained in the following three sections. Future research 
could examine the influence of other learning dispositions, but I selected curiosity, risk-taking, 
and voice. 
Curiosity. Curiosity was the disposition with the most data. I cross-checked the evidence 
against the code observation for curiosity - when a child seeks to increase their knowledge about 
a novel or uncertain object (French & Woodring, 2013; Tea, 2016; Berlyner, 1979). The data 
revealed evidence of curiosity as a view of self as interested, with the expectation that people, 
places, and things can be interesting, which demonstrates motivation to understand (Claxton & 
Carr, 2004; Katz, 1998). Data showing MC’s support of children’s interests were selected for 
interpretation in the findings.  
Close examination of the text identified markers for curiosity as both the use of 
questioning words, and identification of silent moments (4-10 seconds) when MC and a child 
considered an idea. Events that were excluded for curiosity included question-asking for 
guidance or information moving toward completing a task rather than building understanding, 
exchanges of only 2-3 utterances demonstrating minimal interest, and questioning by MC to 
elicit an action such as, “Why don’t you come along now with the class?”. In the selection of 
data for curiosity, it was important to examine the level of interest and the duration of the 
engagement. 

 
65
 
Risk-taking. Risk-taking emerged through the process of cross-checking (Creswell, 
2014) coding tables with fellow researchers at my university as we raised questions concerning 
the learning dispositions of independence and persistence. The data did not exactly fit either 
independence or persistence. Claxton and Carr (2004) offered independence as a view of self as 
competent to work toward a task with limited support or to self-manage. They describe 
persistence as a view of self as someone able to return to or persist with a problem despite 
setbacks. Furthermore, the data was not a good fit with resilience, defined as the ability to 
recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. These three learning dispositions are 
important for learning, yet there was something occurring between MC and her students that did 
not fit these dispositions. She was doing and saying things before independence, persistence, or 
resilience could occur. Before a child could demonstrate independence, persistence, or resilience, 
the child had to be courageous and take a risk. These three associated dispositions could only 
occur after a child had taken a risk. Therefore, I considered risk-taking as a learning disposition.  
 
The data that resulted in independence, persistence, or resilience were grounded in risk-
taking. These data chunks for risk-taking were identified by language use and/or nonverbal 
communication when the child expressed fear or concern about the unknown or in response to 
uncertainty. Data was sorted for risk-taking when MC supported or assisted a child from a place 
of fear or concern to a place of knowing and comfort or contentment. Risk-taking was defined as 
engaging in act with an uncertain outcome that could be perceived as dangerous or embodying 
some level of fear for the child (Stephenson, 2003).  
Examples of risk-taking include children saying they are scared of a task such as jumping 
from a high place or playing in a large box. But it is not risk-taking when they are concerned a 
friend is taking a toy and they hit, or when they are scared of a loud sound and shout out. These 

 
66
actions do not take the child to a place of comfort. Equally, an enactment that they have been 
asked not to do such as take an extra turn on the swing does contain an element of risk (the 
teacher may be angry), but it does not achieve a level of contentment for the child. Risk-taking 
was identified when the child was concerned, scared or worried about the act, MC influenced 
them to take the risk, and the child was pleased with the results. 
Voice. Similar sorting problems as found in risk-taking were encountered with creativity. 
Defined by Bertram and Pascal (2002) as the view of self as a communicator (expressing ideas) 
or innovator in a wide range of contexts (speaking, painting, constructing, drawing, singing, 
dancing, etc.), this learning disposition is cross listed as imagination (New Zealand Ministry of 
Education,1996). Therefore, identifying it in the transcripts would require knowledge of the 
child’s imaginative or cognitive intent. How did they view themselves? Were they simply 
creating, or were they being creative? From this consideration of creativity as a self-view as a 
communicator, I cross-checked the evidence in the data coded as creative and sorted out creative 
acts that demonstrated communication.  Experienced researches reviewed my work for 
reliability. There were many chunks in which MC supported children’s communication, but 
‘communication’ and ‘communicator’ were not learning dispositions because these terms did not 
motivate a child toward a learning goal. Communication is a specific act or action.  It is a task or 
act loaded with meaning. I struggled to identify the expression of creativity and examined it 
through the lens of communication. In the process of reconciling the prominence of 
communication with the characteristics of learning dispositions, the idea of voice emerged.  
Voice is defined in this dissertation as the child’s expression of an idea, question, or 
opinion. It is a term that represents a behavior a child can exhibit. The data demonstrated how 
MC supported the development of voice in her teaching engagements. Voice was observed as a 

 
67
child considered an act that might be considered creative. In the chapter on voice, when Sarah 
repositioned her finger-painting hands to create a spider and named it, her voice was expressed in 
this novel creation. When a child was resilient, they were using their voice to express their need 
or opinion. When, in the same chapter, Carrie said she couldn’t sit down when her socks were 
wet, she was expressing a specific need. MC supported her voice by responding with language 
directed toward a solution. Likewise, the expression of independence was verbal or physical as 
seen when Irene used voice to share her drawing and writing with the class. Voice is not simply 
asking for permission, stating a routine need, or talking among peers. Voice is a specific form of 
expression of a child’s desires – of their learning goals. 
This analysis process worked not to count the data, but to break apart the data and 
rearrange it into categories that facilitate comparisons within and between data chunks and to 
develop concepts about ways a teacher may influence learning dispositions. Information emerged 
that I expected to find, as well as information I did not expect to find. This led me to name two 
new categories for learning dispositions — risk-taking and voice. 
Researcher’s Position 
 
I believe in the power of early childhood education to empower thinking in young 
children and create equity in education. Learning to be social and developing learning 
dispositions are the essential elements of early childhood education. These are the conduits for 
academic learning. When I am with young children, I look for the totality of the child – their 
interests and strengths. I believe that they can actively construct their knowledge through direct 
sensory and intellectual experience and be empowered by their knowledge and skill. 
Entering a teacher’s classroom to examine her teaching is an act of trust. I am grateful to 
MC for allowing me to look closely at her teaching, especially since we first met when I was 

 
68
assessing her with the CLASS instrument. Immediately following that assessment, we had a rich 
conversation about teacher assessment, early education, and the qualities of an outstanding 
teacher. Shared ideas, including our view of children as capable human beings, helped build our 
mutual trust. The initial interview further bonded us as teachers who want to learn more about 
teaching and learning. We are both women about the same age with over 30 years of experience 
in the field of elementary and early childhood education. The shared experience of migrating to 
the Southwest from New England also connected us. Establishing this relationship before I met 
the children enabled me to be introduced to the children and parents as a trusted colleague. 
From another viewpoint, there were a number of reasons I could be viewed as an expert 
in the room with those whom MC wanted to impress. I have held leadership positions in this city 
in early education, and at that time, I was an appointed professor. I have also served as a former 
school director, CLASS assessor, and student teacher supervisor. In these roles, where a critical 
eye for improvement is helpful, subjectivity has been useful. The CLASS assessment was a tool 
used by this state’s quality improvement rating system (QRIS) and was a powerful source of 
recognition and funding. The role of CLASS assessor placed me initially in a position of power. 
MC and I have mutual professional colleagues, and we both were invested in creating a positive 
research experience. As a researcher, I had to set aside subjectivity and be as objective as 
possible. I had to minimize my expert effect with MC. The assessor role was eliminated before 
research began to diminish my position of power. I worked to establish and maintain a colleague 
relationship through frequent friendly conversations, dressing casually yet respectfully, helping 
prepare the classroom for the afternoon class, and returning to the room after the last day of 
school for ‘end of year clean-up.’ 

 
69
How my position as researcher relates to the children is impossible to know fully. I am a 
White, monolingual English-speaking woman of middle income and a homeowner, which sets 
me apart from these multilingual children of color who live in an area with many apartments and 
rental homes. I worked to exhibit humility and kindness. Having lived in the Southwest for 40 
years, I have come to understand the richness of multiple cultures coexisting. When I failed to 
understand the children’s expression of culture and Funds of Knowledge (González, Moll, and 
Amanti, 2006), I asked the teacher to explain any references I did not understand. For example, 
some girls were more reserved, so I sought clarity for understanding their responses to MC’s 
discourse. However, the children mainly ignored me because they are accustomed to unfamiliar 
adults in the room as therapists, QRIS evaluators and coaches, and parents. I strove to be friendly 
and helpful.  
My job in this research was to be reflective about my role in the data collection and 
analysis. As an interpretivist researcher (Geertz, 1973), I worked to make sense of teacher-child 
interactions. As a former director of an early learning center, conference presenter, student 
teacher supervisor, and advocate for the rights of young children, my research interest focuses on 
teachers of young children and how they affirm the developing child. I seek to understand issues 
of social justice embedded in teacher discourse. This data gave me the opportunity to closely 
analyze a teacher whose educational philosophy is grounded in social justice and constructivism. 
Her affirmation of children opened viewpoints beyond simply observing interactions and enabled 
me to see multiple meanings and interpretations of teacher- child relationships. 
Protection of Human Subjects 
This study included 18 children under the age of five. I maintained the anonymity of all 
the subjects. I was a friendly ‘fly on the wall’, maintaining a pleasant and friendly appearance at 

 
70
all times. I have a state-issued fingerprint card and was never alone in a room with the children 
or a child.

Chapter 4: Curiosity 
Introduction 
 
Curiosity as a learning disposition can be defined as the intense desire to know or 
understand. It is defined by Jirout and Klahr (2012) “as the preferred level of uncertainty – or the 
amount of uncertainty that will lead to question asking or exploratory behavior” (p. 5). Using this 
definition, curiosity is viewed in this study as inquisitiveness, or the desire to learn or know 
about anything. In early education, curiosity conveys interest, eagerness, inquisitiveness, 
questioning, investigation, and marveling. Curiosity seeks to increase knowledge and is 
frequently associated with uncertainty (Berlyner,1979; French & Woodring, 2013; Meta, 2016). 
Other scholars define it as the motivational construct (Vidler, 1977) underlying “exploratory 
behaviors applied to novel objects, situations, or events that function to acquire information” 
(Weisler & McCall, 1976, p. 493). Exploratory behaviors motivate or influence a child’s 
movement toward a learning goal. Therefore, curiosity can be defined as a learning disposition 
(Katz, 1988; AZ Early Learning Standards, 2018).  
This chapter analyzes three vignettes from this study. They were video recorded, 
transcribed, and coded. The analysis discusses the strategies this teacher of young children used 
to influence children’s curiosity. The chapter concludes with a discussion arguing for the use of 
these strategies to influence curiosity in early education. 
In this chapter and the two that follow, the data is represented in tables with five columns. 
The first column is for the line in the transcript from the video. The next column identifies who 
is speaking or doing (agent), followed by what they are saying (utterance) in the third column, 
then what they are doing (nonverbal) in the fourth column, and what learning disposition is being 
influenced in that line in the fifth column. The scripts in tables are presented sequentially in 

 
72
order to align their ideas to the LD of the section, but some scripts have lines removed for 
efficiency. Therefore, there are occasional gaps in the line numbers. The learning disposition 
may not be yet evident in the children’s words or actions, but the lines indicated signify a 
strategy used by the teacher to influence a learning disposition. 
Curiosity Developed with Novel Materials 
MC presented novel materials for exploration, and these materials often influenced 
curiosity or sought to increase the children’s knowledge about a novel or uncertain object 
(Berlyner, 1979; French & Woodring, 2013; Meta, 2016;). The following examples demonstrate 
two strategies of cultivating curiosity through presenting novel materials to explore and directing 
attention to the novel object, and introducing the material without explanation. The focus of the 
first example is an item made by Lakeshore® called a Hide & Seek Discovery Ball (see Figure 
1), and the second example is new playground equipment.

Scaffolded exploration of novel materials. MC rolled a large storage cart of play 
materials into the playground for the children to access each day. From this cart, they took balls, 
buckets and shovels for sand, superhero capes, or other materials or tools for outdoor play. One 
day, MC brought a new object, the Discovery Ball, to the playground. The ten-inch ball’s open

engage their curiosity, and started a throwing circle.

This vignette began when MC noticed the children pulling on the new ball she had placed on the 
playground cart. The children were clearly interested in this new object and were wanting to hold 
the novel Discovery Ball. Their curiosity was observed as they sought to increase their 
knowledge about a novel or uncertain object (Berlyner, 1979; French & Woodring, 2013; Meta, 
2016). The act of squatting down to be face-to-face with the children in a position of equity and 
understanding drew in the children’s interest as MC wondered aloud, expressing uncertainty with 
them about the ball. She gently described the ball to the children and asked them to think about 
the spaces and their possible use. The children were reaching for the ball to gain first-hand 
knowledge about the ball.

In lines 29-37, MC further engaged curious thinking with questions about how to use the ball and 
how the holes could be used. The children had been grabbing the ball, so she was meeting that 
exploratory behavior with questions and experience. In both Tables 4.1 and 4.2, she called upon 
the children’s interest to evoke curiosity when she asked them to notice details about the ball. 
MC pointed out the spaces and holes in the ball – novel features of the ball. This strategy for 
asking open-ended questions about the features worked to create an invitation for curiosity. She 
was not asking these questions to check the children’s knowledge but asking using a strategy that 
made space for the children to wonder about the ball and make sense of it. The children tested 

 
75
their ideas about the ball, and in line 28, Kyle put his hand in the ball, and then Alfred stated his 
theory that things put in the holes will fall out. 
MC’s questioning strategy encourages curiosity. When MC asked, “What do you think is 
going in the hole?” in line 31 and prompted “your?” in line 33, she extracted Alfred’s comment 
about using your hands to throw the ball. This illustrated a moment of tension between the 
children’s genuine curiosity and MC guiding them toward her predetermined response. A 
moment of genuine curiosity occurred when Kyle demonstrated that he could put his arm 
through the hole. The children were engaged with exploring the ball, an act of curiosity, and they 
were responding to her teaching about the ball. She was leading them to learning about throwing. 
Moments of tension occurred in these lines between strategies for curiosity and the teacher’s 
agenda, as shown by Kyle putting his arm through the ball and MC’s tension expressed as 
wanting the children to learn to hold and throw this novel ball. At this point, MC guided the 
children to hold the ball with their hands and make a circle.

Table 4.3 demonstrated using an excited and interested tone to elicit curiosity about a group 
event. In line 46, Jesus, Alex, and Castro left where they were previously playing and came 
running to MC, Kyle, and Alfred when they heard her excited voice. They were exhibiting an 
intense desire to know or understand something about this new object. Their attention was drawn 
by the teacher’s voice tone and volume, and she focused them toward the ball. This is the 
definition of curiosity. MC’s discourse elicited curiosity.

In line 50, MC included children in the group by verbally acknowledging them as they joined the 
throwing circle. Here, the focus on the uncertainty of the throwing game elicited the curiosity of 
Jesus, Alex, and Castro, who joined the game with interest about both how to throw and how to 
throw with the goal of throwing to a peer. MC’s discourse of supportive words, excited reaction 
with each successful catch, and energy focused on maintaining the circle attracted the children to 
the Discovery Ball and this catching game. They worked on throwing and catching the ball. 
Alfred exhibited curiosity when he tested a new theory, experimenting with rolling the ball. 
 
In Table 4.4, MC influences the children’s interest in the ball toward an uncertain social 
engagement with the ball. After initially gathering the children’s interests (Table 4.1), she 
focused their attention on the properties of the ball (Table 4.2). She then expanded their 
knowledge of the ball (Table 4.3) to an action with the ball (Table 4.4). Learning to engage in 
group games is frequently teacher-guided because of the uncertainty of the task and skills 
needed. This excerpt demonstrates MC guiding children’s uncertainty with specific statements, 
including spatial relationships (see Table 4.4, lines 53 and 61), awareness of gaze (see Table 4.4, 
lines 52, 54, 60), and timing (see Table 4.4, lines 50, 51, 55, 58, 59). Her exuberant comments 
such as “yeah” and “Hoo, hoo” matched her cheerful voice tone, smiling face, proximity, and 
high energy level. She influenced physical and social curiosity with a novel object, developing 
the situation into a social-physical engagement. 
 
Discussion surrounding the introduction of novel materials. In the vignette above, MC 
placed materials – the Discovery Ball – within a child’s access. This action is a form of 
nonverbal questioning and these examples with both the Discovery Ball and the upcoming 

 
78
Magnet Wall created an unspoken question or provocation (Rinaldi, 1998). The presence of 
these novel materials created uncertainty. What is this? What should we do with it? How should 
we engage with it? The question is not asked verbally, but the novel materials provoked the child 
and the teacher’s engaged presence encouraged the child to be curious. Initially, the children’s 
engagement with the novel object was disagreeable and they were tugging with each other for 
possession of the ball. MC entered the dialogue with the children, adding focus and uncertainty 
about how to use the ball. The non-verbal question of the provocation was responded to with 
interest, and MC focused the interest with questions about the ball. 
 
In this vignette, MC is observed noticing children’s interest in a novel object and she 
influences their curiosity.  She noticed the interest and tugging on the novel object – the ball – 
and interjected information about the ball in the form of questions and answers. She first focused 
the children’s attention on the properties of the ball and away from possession of the ball. 
Through questions, she guided them to noticing uncertain or unusual features of the ball. These 
questions elicited curious thinking, as seen in their comments about the ball. When she moved 
the children to a throwing game, the children moved with her to the uncertainty of a task with the 
ball. Scaffolding upon their curiosity about the ball, she moved them to the social uncertainty of 
throwing the ball to each other. The questions about the ball were introduced and motivated the 
children to participate in a throwing circle. This vignette sets an example of providing an 
uncertain object, noticing interest, and scaffolding information and guidance to create a social 
engagement.

Introducing Novel Materials without Explanation. This second example used a 
different novel object to influence children’s curiosity on the playground.  MC had a planned a 
new object for the playground for this day.  She had an unopened, large, long cardboard box on 
the cart. It was a box containing 4- and 2-foot half tubes and rings with magnetized attachments 
designed to stick to a metal surface. The school had mounted a 5’ x 7’ white metal panel 
“Magnet Wall” on an exterior wall in the playground, and MC planned to use the half tubes 
against this wall. MC had obtained this interactive Outdoor Magnet Wall Kit through a grant, 
and she told me her plan was to put the materials out on this first day with no explanation. After 
she helped a few children find their chosen toys, tools, and capes from the cart, she took the box 
down and carried it to the Magnet Wall. 
 
MC opened the box of magnetized tubes and rings and 1½-inch balls. She attached a few 
magnetized half tubes called “ramps” to the Magnet Wall. Andres rode a tricycle close to her and 
watched her for 25 seconds. At this point, the excerpt begins.

MC noticed Andres’ curiosity about the opened box and how to fix it. She responded with open-
ended questions about how the box would be put together. Andres’ question-asking or 
exploratory behavior, observed in his long gaze at the box, reflected an amount of uncertainty 
signaling his curiosity (Jirout & Klahr, 2012). His voice tone conveyed interest and curiosity, not 
worry. She elicited his ideas in lines 27 and 31, and asked ‘how’ in line 26, 28, and 29. In line 
25, Andres asked, “How are you gonna put it back together?” MC changed the pronoun to “we” 
in line 26, then asked for his specific ideas in line 27. This shift of pronoun in line 27 shifted 
responsibility to include Andres in creating an idea about how it would be fixed. This shift of 
pronoun also indicates a tension regarding teacher control. She was inclusive of his ideas but did 
not give him complete responsibility for putting the box together again. He was interested in the 

 
81
box, not in the tubes and rings. MC made a teaching decision to stick with her plan of working 
with the Magnet Wall, not rebuilding the box. MC was planning on children being curious about 
the contents of the box, but Andres’ curiosity was not dismissed. He was concerned about the 
box being opened and how to fix it. MC met his thinking with questions and welcomed his 
solution. She did not act on his solution, and she also did not say, “That’s not what we’re doing 
right now.” She noticed and commented about his interest, even though fixing the box was not 
her goal for opening the box. His idea about fixing the box was heard, and his curiosity 
diminished because he rode away. Even though she did not actively engage in his curious 
question about the box because her goal was exploring the tubes and rings, it was significant that 
she did not discourage him from asking questions to satisfy his uncertainty about the box. This 
represents a teacher tension between children’s curiosity and teacher intent.

The excerpt above (see Table 4.6) featured two children lifting the half pipes, tubes, and rings 
and placing them on the wall. Line 34 is the first time MC used the word “magnet” associated 
with the word “stick” in lines 34 and 35. It is unclear if her intent was to further explore the idea 
of magnetism as the force making the pipes stick to the wall. They continued to explore the 
materials and lifted and placed various sized pieces, demonstrating curiosity about manipulating 
the pipes and rings in positions on the wall. MC coached the children in line 37 to move around 
each other without bumping. Castro tested his strength in line 39 when he lifted a long half tube 
and refused help. In line 40 MC affirmed his strength. The learning disposition observed here is 
curiosity because the children explored new materials and tested their abilities to lift, maneuver, 
to stick the pipes to the wall. MC elicited curiosity by introducing a provocation of novel 
materials. She supported the children’s exploration (as seen below in Table 4.7).

MC maintained the conversation about the work with the magnetic ball wall in the excerpt 
above. She asked, “What’s your idea?” in line 41, embodying the thought that the children have 
ideas. This open-ended question is broader than a question such as, “what are you building?” or 
“what are you doing?”. MC’s choice of words states that they have an idea and she seemed to 
urge them to explain their thinking. She influenced curiosity by supporting their statements, 
rephrasing their comments, and offering open suggestions. She engaged them by asking them to 
explain their explorations.  
MC influenced curiosity when she noticed ideas and offered statements, questions, or 
additional materials. Castro had an idea about size in line 42, and MC responded by repeating his 
statement and offered an uncertain statement, “this might help hold that,” in line 44. She stated a 
ring could support a tube toward the goal of making it bigger. The strategy of supplying 
uncertain statements such as “what’s your idea?” and “this might help hold that” supports a 
child’s thinking but doesn’t supply the answer. The move of adding the ring near Castro made 
space for his curiosity to answer the question. Implied in her statement is, “do you think this will 

 
84
work?” She supported his learning goal of building the ring and pipe structure bigger through 
supporting his curiosity about how to do it. Teachers influence curiosity with well-worded 
questions and information pertinent to a child’s interest or curiosity.

Table 4.8 shows MC’s continued use of open-ended questions and modeling experimentation. 
Line 46 is an example of MC eliciting curiosity through open-ended questions, and modeling 
experimentation as she placed the rings and tried them in various positions. As she explored 
features of the Ball Wall materials, she talked about them and used them in a manner that caused 
the children to intensely explore the materials, try new ways of placing the rings and tubes, and 
in the excerpt below (see Table 4.9), try a solution MC said would not work. The children’s 
exploration of the Ball Wall materials occurred following her questions and comments, 
suggesting that MC’s discourse influenced their curiosity. 
The excerpt below (see Table 4.9) includes the learning disposition of problem solving 
defined earlier (see Chapter 2, Specific Learning Dispositions) as the view of self as strategic 

 
85
with flexible approaches to a task or problem (Marx, 2011; McDermott, Green, Francis, & Stott, 
1999). As seen in this vignette, a child’s curiosity led them to exploration, and exploration led to 
problems that needed solutions.

Table 4.9 has been included in this study because it demonstrated a moment when the teacher 
illustratively deviated from influencing curiosity in her comments and questions.  MC’s 
comments were suggestive (line 58). The questions in lines 57 and 59 were directive. The 
learning disposition in this Table 4.9 was reasoning and problem-solving, not curiosity, because 
the questions are not open-ended. MC gave specific observations and solutions to Steven. She 
offered flexible approaches and solutions to her problem of the ball just dropping through the 
pipe and not traveling horizontally. It is unclear if Steven saw this as a problem needing a 
solution. Jesus followed up on the idea of how to work with the balls and the ramps. It seems that 
MC had pictured balls rolling horizontally through the half pipes across the wall. This is a 

 
86
moment when the teacher’s ideas superseded a child’s experimentations and serves as a counter 
example for influencing curiosity.

Curiosity  
 
The excerpt above (see Table 4.10) featured a broad range of interactions. MC evoked curiosity 
in line 60 when she asked about the rings. This interaction was interrupted when a colleague 
entered the scene for 23 seconds to discuss a plan for the following week. During this 

 
87
conversation another child walked up to the new apparatus (the magnet wall). The children 
maintained their engagement with the magnet wall and did not seem distracted by the 
conversation. As MC rejoined the group, she interrupted herself in lines 62 and 63 with two 
incomplete sentences. By line 64 she had observed the children’s work and had identified 
Castro’s action as a topic of conversation. MC described Castro’s approach to a learning goal 
when she described his work of putting the balls through the circles (rings) to Casey. Thus, the 
learning disposition in line 64 is problem-solving because she talked about specific observations 
and solutions. She returned to influencing curiosity with open-ended questions, like “What do 
you think?” in lines 65 and 66.  
As MC maintained interest in the children’s work, she continued to influence their 
curiosity. She was no longer focused on the solutions she envisioned but was instead focused on 
the children’s solutions. The excerpt ends when her focus shifted to an injured child and she had 
to direct her attention away from the Magnet Wall and to the injured child. 
 
Discussion of exploration of novel materials. The vignette above features effective and 
ineffective moves made by MC to influence curiosity. First, she introduced the materials in an 
open-ended fashion, and gave no instructions. She set the box of materials on the ground by the 
Magnet Wall, opened the box, and started placing the tubes on the board. Children saw her 
working and investigated this unknown phenomenon of white ramps sticking to the Magnet 
Wall. Steven and Castro ran over and picked up the half tubes and imitated MC’s actions of 
attaching them to the magnetic wall in line 33. Then Jesus and Casey joined them. There was no 
verbal explanation of how to use the materials. MC was interested in the Magnet Wall and she 
modeled curiosity or invention as she attached the ramps and rings to the magnetic wall. 

 
88
Throughout the learning environment, both indoors and outdoors, MC invited the 
children’s curiosity by providing access to open-ended materials with minimal instruction. 
Materials were always accessible from the cart, and indoors during ‘investigations’, children 
used legos, building blocks, and dramatic play and art materials according to their interest and 
intent. Open-ended access seemed to influence curiosity because of the choice and options it 
afforded to explore the unknown.  
In this vignette, the novel Magnet Wall caused two waves of children to run over: first 
Steven and Castro, then Jesus and Casey. MC never said, “Come over and see this new toy”, nor 
did she say to the group before outside time, “I have a surprise for you to play with outside 
today.” Not introducing the ball wall contributed an amount of uncertainty that lead to question-
asking or exploratory behavior (Jirout & Klahr, 2012). She also used open-access language. In 
both lines 27 and 41, she said, “What is your idea”? Children responded to this question based on 
their interest. Andres said, “Tape it”, as his interest was in putting the box back together, and 
Castro responded, “we can make it bigger”, indicating an interest in building. She did give them 
some information in line 34, “Should we try and see if the magnets work?”, informing them of 
the presence of magnets. Up to this point, the children were randomly experimenting with 
various attempts to attach the ramps to the wall. Steven observed MC sticking a ring to the wall 
using the magnetic contact, and then he placed the magnet side of his ramp against the wall. 
Castro noticed how to stick a ring or pipe to the wall and stuck his ramp to the wall as well. The 
children watched MC and each other’s work to attach the ramps. Children were observing and 
experimenting with this novel material because MC had ignited their curiosity.  

 
89
 
Figure 3. MC verbally responsive and proximate 
 
Teacher focus. Teacher focus is a strategy that influences curiosity because it motivates 
or enhances children’s engagement with materials. MC focused on the children’s interest and 
was responsive to the children’s ideas verbally and physically. Responding to children’s ideas 
with supportive language, smiling, and making approving comments influences curiosity 
(Hackman & Engle, 2002). For example, she said, “what is your idea?” in lines 27 and 41. This 
language was open and encouraging, as was her enthusiastic interest and proximity to the activity 
(See Figure 3). MC worked to maintain focus on the Magnet Wall rather than other possibilities 
on the playground, thus sustaining curiosity in this engagement.  
 
Shared interest. Shared interest influences curiosity and signals enthusiasm (Hackman & 
Engle, 2001). In fact, as MC was opening the box, Andres sat on a tricycle and asked how she 
was going to put it together again. It was a question about the box, not a question about her 
intended subject, the Magnet Wall. In lines 26- 32, MC asked Andres, “How are we going to do 
it?”, “What’s your idea?”.  She then said, “I think we need your help”, pointed to the box and the 
wall, and said, “How are we gonna do it?” He responded with, “How are you going to fix it?” 
[my emphasis]. From his position of wondering about the box, the wall was MC’s problem, and 

 
90
she responded, “I don’t know.” She did not dismiss Andres’ curiosity (or worry) when she 
engaged him in conversation about the box, but she did not take up his interest. She held her 
focus and continued to work with the ramps. A key component of developing curiosity is 
sustained focus or interest rather than scattershot thinking about multiple items (Engel, 2015; 
Hackman & Engel, 2002). She valued his idea by listening but refocused her interest on the 
Magnet Wall when she made a choice to continue pursuing the engagement with the tubes and 
the Magnet Wall.  
This teacher action represents the tension at the intersection of the child’s interest with 
the teacher’s interest. In this moment, MC maintained focus on the task at hand and did not take 
up Andres’ curiosity about box reconstruction. She shared interest with the children who were 
curious about the Magnet Wall. Taking up the questions from the interested children and 
dismissing Andres’ questions demonstrated an intentional choice of focus. It is not uncommon in 
any classroom for a teacher to make choices about which interests to take up. In this vignette, 
MC met the children at the intersection of interests, and did not take Andres’ interest, but chose 
the interest that connected with her intent. 
Teachers are making decisions constantly and don’t take up every moment of curiosity.  
How does a teacher choose to stay with a question or move on with a child? Children, students, 
and all people need space to think and figure out whether to follow their curiosity or give it up. A 
teacher must decide whether to follow a tangent or stay with her intended lesson. When a teacher 
supports the exploration, the child’s interest is reinforced and liable to reoccur. 
In the vignette in Table 4.6, MC established the children as building assistants with their 
own ideas about how to arrange ramps in formations for rolling balls. She made various 
comments demonstrating their shared interest in ideas about the magnet wall. They were invited 

 
91
in line 34: “Should we try and see if the magnets work?” The emphasis on ‘we’ positioned the 
children as experts, which empowered them and motivated their curiosity. They were offered 
support in line 36, and their strength and competence are noted in line 40. MC asked them about 
their ideas, and she supported their thinking with technical assistance (line 44), not advice. In 
line 41, MC asked, “What’s your idea?” This approach signaled to the children the value of their 
ideas, which seemed to motivate their curious investigation of the ramps and balls. When they 
tried an attachment, she noticed their actions and commented on their ideas. This demonstrated 
shared interest, and in this case, how valuing children’s curiosity and emerging expertise can 
encourage their explorations. 
 
Expanding or limiting curiosity. This open-ended time with materials privileged the 
children as experts and influenced curiosity, but after 2 minutes, MC’s language with the 
children shifted to statements that influenced problem-solving. She offered unsolicited 
(unwanted) information. When she said, “what about this one that doesn’t have a magnet?” in 
line 46, she offered information about a hoop that didn’t have a magnet and removed the 
possibility of discovery. In lines 57 and 58, she said, “So, Steven, how is the ball going to go 
down it vertically? I think it has to be horizontal” seemed to critique Steven’s vertical placement 
of a tube. He then picked up a watering can and went away. In line 66, she asked, “Where do you 
think those would connect?” which brought in the idea of connecting the ramps when the 
children were still working on figuring out how to attach them to the wall and investigating all 
the various pieces. There were other lines that suggested what to do with the materials that could 
actually limit their curiosity, such as line 59: “You got 3 balls, do you want to put up another 
ramp?” and line 65, “What do you think Aldo? Where do you want to put those? Where do you 
think those would connect?” This ‘add on’ language may have had the intent of expanding their 

 
92
curiosity, but it may have a limiting effect on their curiosity. These lines seem to be conflicts 
between the learning dispositions of curiosity and problem-solving. These were her questions, 
not the children’s. These questions may have moved children’s thinking about the materials 
away from curiosity with unsolicited information related to problem-solving. The questions did 
seem to diminish the children’s sense of being an expert. 
If children learn best from their own questions (Chouinard, 2007), then too many teacher 
questions or unsolicited information may dampen curiosity. Conversely, when MC moved away 
from the Magnet Wall and was not commenting to Jesus about his ramp, he independently 
figured out how to place a ramp so a ball would roll down it (see Figure 4). He also seemed to 
flourish when allowed to express his ideas about the materials without the limitations of close 
direction from the teacher. So, while the placement of the materials was open-ended, MC’s 
questions may have become limiting. Some of those questions offered judgement and suggested 
what to do with the tubes. While she did not do the work for them, it seemed the teacher’s ideas 
may have crowded out the children’s thinking. 
 
Figure 4. Jesus (on the right) rolling a ball on his own timeline, without MC. 
These novel materials, the Discovery Ball and Magnet Wall, sparked children’s curiosity, 
supported their question-asking, and contained resources to explore. Children need to satisfy 

 
93
curiosity about new materials first before being asked to solve problems with the materials. Once 
their curiosity is satisfied, they can move to problem-solving. In addition to allowing time for the 
children, this teacher added focusing language to the provocative nature of this novel material. In 
these two vignettes, the open presentation of novel materials of the Magnet Wall and the 
explained presentation of the Discovery Ball focused the children’s interest to spark and 
maintain curiosity.  
MC noticed children’s curiosity and enhanced it with ideas and interest through questions 
or comments. This teacher was a close observer of children, which she used to expand children’s 
thinking about expressed curiosity. MC noticed curiosity with great acuity. Her verbal exchanges 
often expanded a child’s knowledge or thinking about a subject, and in this way, she built upon 
their expressed curiosity. 
Noticing Children’s Interest 
In addition to presenting novel materials designed to provoke curiosity, MC also was 
interested in children’s curiosity when it arose in other circumstances. In the following vignette, 
MC noticed a child’s exploratory behavior during an art activity and encouraged him to extend it. 
This next vignette features a group of five children at a water Table, a 2 x4 foot raised tub 
typically used for water play. Today, MC was working with children to create spin art. They put 
on smocks to prepare themselves for painting, and, one at a time, each child placed a small paper 
plate in a salad spinner, squirted paint on the plate, placed the lid on the spinner, and spun the 
salad spinner to create an image of blended paint. Steven (see Figure 5, the child on the right) 
was one of these children waiting for a turn to spin paint in the salad spinner. MC noticed his 
intense interest in the spinner mechanism in the lid of the salad spinner and she encouraged his 
exploration with her interest and language.

The learning disposition of curiosity defined earlier in this chapter by Jirout and Klahr (2012) as 
“the preferred level of uncertainty – or the amount of uncertainty that will lead to question asking 
or exploratory behavior” (p. 5) is found in this vignette (see Table 4.11) of children creating spin 
art. Steven’s curiosity about the mechanism that makes the salad spinner spin is most prominent. 
In line 7, Steven picked up the lid of the salad spinner and looked at the moving parts of the lid, 
the handle on the top side and the gears on the underside that engage with the container.

MC’s discourse influenced curiosity in the excerpt above when she noticed Steven’s 
initial interest in the lid. Steven continued to have her support investigating the mechanics of the 
lid, even when he dropped it and picked it up. Dropping it was observed when MC said, 
“Whoopsie!”, and it signaled to Steven that the lid was an uncertainty worth following. His 
curiosity was not interrupted with instructions from MC about being careful, or ‘don’t drop’. She 
supported his curiosity by giving him space to pick up the lid and explore it. This support of his 
interest in the lid influenced the response in the following Table, Table 4.13.

Line 21 was a moment when the lid was needed for Casey to spin his paint. Steven had had 
access to the spinner in lines 3-21, and now gave it up to MC. Steven released the lid to MC 
when she put her hand on it. This is another moment when the teacher’s agenda (making spin art) 
superseded curiosity, yet she wanted Steven to remain curious and stay at the water Table. MC 
had influenced curiosity in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 and now when the spinner was needed to actually 
spin paint, the curiosity Steven had developed maintained his interest even when the spinner was 
not in his hands. When Steven put his hands in the residual water in the water Table MC had an 
unsure look on her face about what he was going to do with his hands in the water, but she did 
not give him any directives. MC and Casey put the lid on the container and spun the paper inside 
the container to create his art. Steven watched.

The excerpt above showed MC keeping Steven interested in the lid through conversation. She 
was bridging the time while Casey used the spinner to maintain Steven’s curiosity while he did 
not have the spinner. Steven stayed at the water Table, watching Casey painting, and looked 
intently at Casey use the spinner. Even though he could not actively explore the spinning 
mechanism, she brought attention to the fact he was waiting and watching the spinning lid work. 
Then Steven shouted out an exuberant “ahhh” in line 41 below (see Table 4.15) when the spinner 
was spinning rapidly.

Curiosity 
 
The child who was painting shifted in lines 43 – 65 (described here in text but not represented in 
the tables) and Steven wanted his turn, but it was Castro’s turn next. When Casey’s painting was 
taken out of the spinner, Steven made excited noises and moved to grab paint containers. MC 
moved the containers out of his reach in what seemed to be an act of control, so Steven could not 
touch the paints. She attempted to influence curiosity when she asked, “Ahh, what is it” in line 
42. When she moved the lid away from him and Castro started his painting, Steven grabbed the 
lid quickly and strongly. They both held the lid. They were not tugging against each other but 
holding it firmly and looking at each other face to face. The possession of the lid was unclear. 
There was tension as both MC and Steven held the lid. Then MC paused for five seconds. She 
maneuvered the lid and held it so Steven could spin it as she held it and talked with Castro. She 
did not say, “Give me the lid, Steven”, or some other authoritarian statement. The pause in line 
gave Steven a moment to relax his grip and as MC held the lid, he began exploring the spinning 
mechanism with his fingers again.  
Steven did not give up his curiosity; instead, it was encouraged with the opportunity for 
further exploration. MC’s choice to hold the lid so Steven could touch it represents a moment of 

 
99
understanding with Steven. The pause possibly reminded Steven of his curiosity and encouraged 
him to explore the spinning mechanism. In this moment in which the teacher seemed to be 
considering taking control of the moment by gathering all the materials, she instead chose to let 
Steven continue his exploration of the spinner lid rather than taking it from him. This moment 
highlights another teacher move for supporting curiosity: allowing exploration to continue even 
when it is inconvenient.

In the excerpt above (see Table 4.16), while Castro was painting, MC continued to hold 
the lid with Steven as he explored the mechanism on the underside with his fingers. She held it in 
such a way that he could run his fingers along the bottom and could use the handle to engage the 

 
100
spinning mechanism. He could spin the lid and feel the gears work. When the spinner stopped 
spinning, she asked him why. She actively engaged Steven’s curiosity in the spinner with her 
words and actions.

The excerpt above in line 83 (see Table 4.17) shows MC’s guidance to Steven to enable the 
mechanism to keep spinning. As he explored the mechanism, he caught his fingers in the plastic 
gears. She noticed his dilemma and suggested holding the spinner on the side so his fingers 
would not be stuck in the gears. He was engaged in exploring the spinning mechanism, and her 
words enabled the spinning to continue. 
MC seemed to be keenly aware of Steven’s frustration threshold. MC anticipated Steven 
reaching his threshold quickly and was quick to give him answers to his problems. Alternatively, 
she may have given another child more time to figure, try, or perhaps struggle and find the 
answer on their own. In this way with Steven, she influenced curiosity by assisting him with 
information before he became disinterested.

In the excerpt above, MC acknowledged Steven’s interest when she asked if he still felt 
the mechanism with his fingers. She enabled his use of the spinner, holding it for him so he could 
spin it independently of the salad spinner container. During the filming of this event, it appeared 
to me initially that MC was constraining Steven’s actions by holding the lid, but she was actually 
supporting his exploration, guiding his fingers, and asking how it felt. He looked inquisitively 
down at the spinning handle and under the lid with intense interest (curiosity) about the 
relationship of his action and the gears that engaged with the salad spinner. She let him explore 
the lid for a full two minutes as Castro was working on painting.  
In this sensitive manner, MC transformed what could have been an annoying interest 
(Steven grabbing the spinning lid) to an extension of his curiosity. At this time, she had dual 
focus on both Castro creating spin art, and Steven exploring the spinner. Her questions were 
consistent with what he was actually exploring, as seen in line 81 (see Table 4.16) “Why doesn’t 

 
102
it go?”, line 84 (see Table 4.17) “Put your hands on the side”, and line 96 (see Table 4.18), “Do 
you feel it on your fingers?” As she guided him in thinking about his ideas about the mechanics 
of a salad spinner, she influenced his curiosity in a positive direction. 
It is unclear why she then directed Steven’s attention toward painting with the question, 
“Steven, what color is Castro going to….?” She was engaging curiosity about the spinner, and 
perhaps wanted to keep him engaged with the idea of using the spinner to create a spin-art 
painting.

In Table 4.19, Steven was spinning the lid and then began to explore the puddle of water in the

behavior shifted from the lid to the puddle of water in the water. He dipped his hands in and 
splashed. MC acknowledged his use of water to splash with a narrative tone. MC’s discourse 
shifted with him and she talked about splashing. He held his hands up and observed the water 
dripping from his fingers. MC did not dissuade his curiosity. He was given unspoken permission 
to splash, drip, and then (in the excerpt below, See Table 4.20) turn and print wet handprints on 
the wall behind him. His curiosity about the spinner had shifted to curiosity about water, and MC 
moved with him in full support of his curiosity.

MC acknowledged spinning and splashing in the ten-line excerpt above. She added sound 
elements to Steven’s exploration of the water when she emphasized the ‘S’ sound, and then 
generalized the ‘S’ sound to Steven and Sarah. This move helped Steven and Sarah stay engaged 
with the painting as they waited for their turn. She chose a task Steven was curious about, 
splashing, and expanded the discourse by adding phonological elements (hearing the ‘s’ sound). 
She added a literacy moment of emphasizing “s” as the initial consonant and she maintained 
Steven’s attention influencing his curiosity. She injected sound elements that continued his time 
exploring the spinner. Following this direct attention from MC, Steven picked up the spinning lid 
once again.

The excerpt above (see Table 4.21) is a busy moment. Steven caught his fingers in the plastic 
mechanism of the salad spinner, and it seemed to hurt. This visceral moment seemed to 
emphasize Steven’s engagement with the spinning mechanism and is punctuated by Steven 
saying, “Wash out [sic]”, meaning “watch out, this thing hurt me.” MC talked with him about the 
injury as she moved the lid to spin Castro’s art. MC noticed how Steven’s curiosity caused a 
pinch, and when the lid was “stuck” reminded him to take his fingers away so it could spin. 
Throughout this vignette, her multi-tasking she maintained Steven’s curiosity in the spinning lid 
and engaged the children in spin-art. 
 
Discussion of noticing a child’s interest. This excerpt demonstrates MC noticing 
curiosity and using discourse to influence and expand it. In line 24 (see Table 4.13), she held the 
lid so Steven could spin the handle and watch the gears mesh on the underside of the lid. She 
acknowledged his ‘good spinning’ in line 79 (see Table 4.16), and he subsequently explored the 
gears. She returned back to his exploration of the gears in line 96 (see Table 4.18) when she 
acknowledged and focused on his curiosity. Her acknowledgement of curiosity seemed to 

 
106
expand its expression. And while she maintained a supervisory role with the paint, she also 
supported Steven’s exploration of the spinner top. It is interesting to note that several days later 
when the spin art was used indoors, he resumed his quiet exploration of the spinning mechanism. 
The next day when the spin art came out, Steven further explored the spinner and this 
time he and MC took a deeper look at how it worked, turning over the lid and examining the 
gears. This repeat of the previous day seemed to demonstrate that initially noticing a curious 
moment resulted in further exploration. Had she said, “No, wait your turn,” the day before, 
would he have been curious the next day? Noticing Steven’s curiosity about gears on one day 
created what I am calling a zone of proximal interest in which this trusted adult supported 
Steven’s curiosity (Vygotsky, 1978), and it continued into the next day. Therefore, not only does 
noticing curiosity support its development, in this example, it creates opportunities for the 
expansion of curiosity over multiple days.                                                                               
General Discussion of Curiosity 
 
Curiosity across the curriculum. Curiosity is a learning disposition which can be 
influenced in all aspects of education, as seen above with art, physics (magnet wall), and 
physical activity (discovery ball). Unfortunately, it is most frequently related to science 
curriculum. Literature discussing curiosity often centers on topics associated with science, as it is 
easy to observe children’s curiosity about the natural world, how things work, and how to make 
things move (Chaille & Britain, 2003; DeVries & Sales, 2011). The unknown or uncertain can 
appear more obvious in the natural world; however, cognitive curiosity - the ways we wonder - 
can be influenced in areas beyond scientific investigation (Engle & Hackman, 2002). While the 
examples in this study of the magnet wall and the spinner mechanism are science-oriented, 

 
107
education – especially early childhood education -- should consider ways of influencing curiosity 
with language and social relationships. 
 
The current emphasis on STEM4 or STEAM5 is important to children’s learning 
experiences, but we should not limit curiosity to these fields alone because curiosity can be 
developed beyond complex science investigation. Not all children are interested in science, but 
all children can further develop their curiosity. This can be done through a physical environment 
that facilitates children’s experimentation with the placement of books, images, creative tools, 
and materials accompanied by supported time to explore them. Additionally, a teacher can create 
a social environment that ignites curiosity by presenting novel experiences with relationship 
building as well as pose curiosity-provoking questions in the context of those experiences. In 
literature, a teacher could wonder about and discuss words, authors, art, etc. to influence 
curiosity about words, reading, and the power of expression. We should consider further 
exploration of cognitive curiosity in the preschool setting - wondering about ideas and the ways 
we wonder. Curiosity should be engaged across the curriculum to explore written and oral 
language, literature, social relationships, and worlds of engagement with relationships. 
 
Timing and use of time. Timing and the use of time also influences curiosity. MC noticed 
children’s ideas, allowing their curiosity to lead them. She planned each day with open times for 
thinking and exploring. Children arrived at school and worked with their parents on various 
tasks, and she used this time to talk with children and parents. “Investigations” was a time of 30 - 
45 minutes after snack for exploring the materials in the classroom. During this time, she moved 
to where children were working and discussed and wondered with them about their work, 
 
4 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 
5 Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics 

 
108
continuously engaged with the children and providing appropriate guidance. Children were 
constantly puzzling, testing, and probing ideas, and this classroom gave them both a physical and 
social environment conducive to developing curiosity. At Circle Time, she probed individual 
interests and wondered aloud with children. For the most part, MC rarely enabled time or 
procedural details to set boundaries on curiosity and learning. Throughout the day she recognized 
or created opportunities to influence curiosity. 
 
There were times of the school day that had time and space limitations such as 
handwashing, using the toilet, or transitioning from outside to inside, and in those times, MC was 
frequently conversing and wondering with children. However, there were also moments of 
tension between a child’s idea and her intention, as seen at the Magnet Wall when MC wanted 
children to move ahead with rolling the balls and they were still exploring the properties of 
magnets. There were other times when a child’s curiosity was possibly not safe or was simply 
too messy, such as later in spin art when Steven wanted to print paint on the wall instead of 
water. The tension between a teachers’ plan or learning goal and a child’s curiosity sometimes 
thwarts the child’s curiosity. It is a balance that teachers must continually evaluate. 
 
Noticing and supporting children’s interests. In these findings, teacher actions that 
influenced curiosity included noticing and expanding a child’s interest and a sense of timing that 
neither hurries nor disinterests a child. Maintaining a respectful and genuine teaching 
temperament also engages curiosity. The adult’s or teacher’s discourse are important components 
influencing curiosity. For this reason, early education teacher development should include what 
Hackman & Engel (2002) call “active interest cognition or focusing condition” (p. 634), in which 
the teacher is extremely attentive and encourages student behavior with smiles, eye contact, and 
occasional interjections. CLASS research names teacher-child relationship as critical toward a 

 
109
positive classroom climate (Pianta, LaParo, Hamre, 2008) but it should include how this 
relationship influences learning dispositions such as curiosity. Lillian Katz (1998) wrote the 
following: 
In the United States, we are not as likely as we could be to help children sense 
that their intellectual quest is of deep interest and importance to us… I suspect 
that because, on the whole, we overestimate children academically and 
underestimate them intellectually, we miss moments when our attention could 
convey to children that their ideas are important. (p. 38) 
Genuine interest is essential because young children can be masters at detecting false interest and 
will disengage. Questions must be asked respectfully and honestly with intent for the child to 
respond. If we do not respect young children’s intelligence, we could hinder them to wonder 
with us. A teacher has to convey that they truly care about the child’s interests. Then, without 
interrupting their thinking, such as when a child pauses or appears to be about to leave, the 
teacher poses questions that encourage the child to probe at a more complex level. For example, 
when Steven reached out and grabbed the lid to the spinner, MC respected his curiosity. At this 
moment, she posed questions in an atmosphere of mutual respect by holding the spinner to 
facilitate his exploration of it. Similarly, at the magnet wall, MC asked context-appropriate 
questions without making direct suggestions that alleviated Steven’s frustration and offered him 
some ideas, which encouraged him to continue exploring. However, a minute later, after some 
direct comments Steven walked away possibly in reaction to these comments. The literature 
needs to discuss the finesse (the practice) of active interest cognition more deeply. As curiosity is 
often a venture into uncertainty, a child seems more likely to enter an uncertain place if 

 
110
accompanied by a respectful, deeply interested teacher. Noticing and reifying children’s interests 
are teaching skills that influence curiosity. 
 
Additionally, teacher development programs need teach how to engage with children to 
influence curiosity. Pre-service teachers learn how to observe a child’s interest, but they need to 
learn how to reflect that interest to influence a child’s developing curiosity. All teachers can 
engage in active interest cognition to influence curiosity. 
 
Novel materials as a provocation. Provocations can be both attention-grabbing events 
with novel material and subtle events in the course of the school day. The Reggio Emilia 
Approach (Edward, Gandini & Forman, 1998; Malaguzzi, 1998; Rinaldi, 2004) frequently 
references provocations as curiosity inducing events when a teacher places novel material in the 
classroom without explanation. The material is present for the children to explore. The Magnet 
Wall in this chapter gives an example of a classic provocation; however, provocations can be 
subtler. Questions such as: “What is the green shoot in the garden?”, or “what did the birds use to 
build their nest?” can serve as provocations. These simple questions name an object (green shoot 
or materials used by birds) to influence curiosity. These discrete provocations are as valuable as 
the flashy novel material of a Magnet Wall and equally as important. Curiosity is developed in 
the obvious engaging provocations carefully planned by a teacher, and a curiosity inducing 
provocation can also occur in a short interaction in the course of the day. Question eliciting 
provocations can be planned and they can be spontaneous. 
 
The asking of open-ended questions. This study emphasizes teacher discourse, 
specifically language use and non-verbal communication. How MC asked open-ended questions 
with, not to, these preschool children influenced curiosity. Open-ended questions are the 
opposite of closed questions, and require complex responses instead of one-word answers like 

 
111
yes, no, a number, a color, etc. (Pianta, LaParo & Hamre, 2008). Instead, the use of open-ended 
questions encourages problem-solving, perspective taking, and/or consideration of feelings. 
Questions such as “Can you think of a way to…”, “What would happen if ….?”, and “How do 
you feel about…?” expand curiosity and cognitive development. However, the literature does not 
discuss teacher discourse in the asking of open-ended questions to young children. The value of 
open-ended questioning is discussed (Burchinal et al., 2002; French & Woodring, 2013; Pianta, 
LaParo, & Hamre, 2008) and teacher discourse is discussed (Engel & Randall, 2009; Johnston, 
2004). Teacher discourse related to asking open-ended questions is not, however; this research 
adds to the literature about teacher discourse and the asking of open-ended questions. 
Uncertainty can be induced with open-ended questions. The use of open-ended questions 
in early education is not unusual, but I observe that the manner in which the questions are asked 
is significant. MC is notable in how she asked open-ended questions. MC’s use of language and 
non-verbal communication through body position, facial expression, voice tone and volume, and 
proximity demonstrated a use of open-ended questions that may need further research. She did 
not ask a question in passing without the appearance of genuine intent. She was proximate, 
leaned in, and she paused to wait for a response. Her actions, her smiling face, and up-tone 
phrasing of her question reflected a positive interaction and a genuine interest. These 
observations place importance on more than simply asking open-ended questions, but also on 
how the question is asked and how it is supported. 
This study demonstrates the importance of how open-ended questions are asked. The 
literature discusses the importance of open-ended questions, but more information/instruction is 
needed about how to pose them. First, the question must be of interest to the child. A teacher 
must be an observant and careful listener to know the interests of each child. Additionally, a 

 
112
teacher should be proximate to the child, leaning in, and when appropriate, pause to wait for a 
response. These actions, and a positive and energetic tone of voice, serve to reflect a genuine 
interest in the child’s exploration.  
 
Questioning within the zone of proximal interest. Teachers’ questions must be within 
the child’s interest. Using my own phrase, zone of proximal interest (derived from Vygotsky’s 
1978 ‘zone of proximal development’), a teacher’s questions must be within the child’s interest, 
neither beyond their interest, nor below or something they have already worked out. Zone of 
proximal interest (ZPI) is observed when a teacher notices a child’s interest and adds either focus 
or challenging questions expanding their interest, without moving the child beyond the ZPI. ZPI 
includes creating space for a child’s curiosity through responding to questions, but not 
summarily supplying the answer. A teacher operating with a child’s ZPI is non-judgmental. As 
observed with the Magnet Wall, when Jesus was told his vertical ramp would not work, he 
walked away. I suggest teachers of young children work to place importance on how the question 
is asked and how it is supported. When teachers ensure they are staying within or gently pushing 
the child’s ZPI, children will be more likely to be engaged and stay engaged with learning. 
Teaching through a children’s ZPI creates space for children to decide what they hold as 
important. It allows them to be active participates in the learning process when their interests are 
the focus. This requires teachers to be curious themselves and learn about children’s interests. 
They also need to be creative in considering how to use the platform of a child’s interest as a 
content area for skill development. 
Differentiated engagement. A teacher generally engages with children according to the 
children’s knowledge and skill level. Many teachers in early childhood education also embrace 
developmentally appropriate practice (Copple & Bredekamp, 2009), which refers to designing 

 
113
the curriculum according to the developmental level of the children. I also see the need for 
differentiated engagement according the development of a specific learning disposition within 
the child’s ZPI. Differentiated engagement involves the teacher and student in a dialogic process 
of learning in which the teacher is considering the expressed learning disposition and the child’s 
interest and is engaging at the intersection of these two areas. Teaching through a child’s existing 
interests holds meaning for the child and demonstrates respect for their existing knowledge. 
This chapter argues that the learning disposition of curiosity can be developed or 
enhanced through and teacher discourse (actions and language). Children’s motivations toward 
curiosity were found in this teacher’s presented provocations, through her actions and words, and 
how she modeled curiosity by asking questions and wondering aloud with children. She 
presented novel materials, connected new ideas with known ideas, noticed children’s curiosity, 
and wondered with them. Her strategy of question asking throughout the school day piqued 
curiosity as she engaged with the children. Curiosity was developed through the learning 
environment created by this teacher. 
 
Curiosity throughout the school day. A teacher can influence curiosity during the ‘in-
between times’ in a school day and throughout the day with intentional interest, enthusiasm for 
the questions, and wait time during in direct instruction, small group time, 1-1 instruction, and 
during the casual time between these ‘official’ teaching blocks. The teacher in this study 
influenced the development of curiosity throughout the school day with a strategy of question-
asking that piqued curiosity. During the transitional times when children were waiting for a turn 
to wash hands, use the restroom, or receive snack, they were engaged in conversations that 
developed curiosity. These transitional times are important to teachers enrolled in a Quality 
Rating System because in many states the CLASS tool is used to rate teachers on how learning 

 
114
or engagement occurs throughout all segments of the school day. Many teachers demonstrate 
strategies similar to the ones MC used, such as singing with children in transition or repeating an 
engaging rhyme. The examples in this chapter illustrate a deep, meaningful engagement with 
children that followed and expanded their interests and curiosity, conveying a level of teacher 
discourse with three and four-year-olds warranting further research. As Katz (1998) said, 
relationships have to have “content of mutual interest or concern that can provide pretexts and 
texts for the interaction between them and not be dominated by information about the child's 
conduct and level of performance” (p. 36). Early educators can be intent on listening closely to 
the children's suggestions and questions, probing their thinking, making suggestions, and 
encouraging children to respond to each other’s ideas. These actions can occur throughout the 
day, and not simply in times of direct teaching or guided engagement. 
MC noticed curious moments as they occurred. She chose which moments to pursue 
because these moments are not always convenient, and she had to balance her agenda with the 
children’s curiosity. In the Magnet Wall, MC noticed and acknowledged Andres’ curiosity about 
putting the box back together but moved forward with her agenda. The Magnet Wall differed 
from the Spin Art vignette because she noticed Steven’s curiosity about the spinner and pursued 
his agenda and the painting with the other children simultaneously, positioning him as an 
explorer and herself as guide and paint supervisor. MC anticipated curiosity when she presented 
the Magnet Wall as an intentional provocation. Curiousness does not only come at times when it 
is convenient for the teacher to notice. The teacher must notice the curiosity when it happens for 
the children, and decide whether to expand it or not, and if so, how. The teacher’s strategies or 
moves can expand (or diminish) curiosity.

Chapter 5: Risk-Taking 
 
This chapter discusses how a teacher influences the learning disposition of risk-taking. 
For this study, risk-taking is identified as an act with an uncertain outcome that could be 
perceived as dangerous or embodying some level of fear (Stephenson, 2003). While some define 
risk as an exposure to danger, I wish to emphasize that a teacher would never intentionally 
expose a child to actual physical or psychological danger. Instead, what potentially feels 
dangerous to a child is the uncertainty in the outcome. What a teacher says and does can 
influence productive risk-taking in children. 
The elements of physical experiences that seem ‘risky’ to a 4-year-old are identified by 
Stephenson (2003) as attempting something never done before or feeling on the borderline of 
‘out of control’ often because of height, speed, or overcoming fear. Common in early education 
are acts that include height or speed, such as climbing, balancing, bike riding, swings, and slides. 
Risk-taking includes a feeling of fear, novelty, or being on the edge of control. This study 
examines productive ways of managing the learning disposition of risk-taking. 
 
The vignettes presented in this chapter illustrate ways in which this teacher enables and 
supports risk-taking. For coding purposes, risk-taking was defined as an action or expression in 
which the child considers the outcome. Risk-taking has been described as “engaging with 
uncertainty, being prepared to be wrong, risking making a mistake—going on learning” 
(Stephenson, 2003, p. 41). Risk involves concern about the process or outcome. 
Teacher Discourse Influencing Risk-Taking 
 
Three primary strategies influencing risk-taking. MC, the teacher in this study, 
influenced the learning disposition of risk-taking with three primary strategies: giving attention 
verbally and through proximity, guiding the children’s safety (or sense of safety), and affirming 

 
116
their actions with a voice of confidence. MC varied her discourse (her moves and verbal 
engagement) to match the needs of each child.

This first vignette (see Table 5.1) took place outdoors at the school playground on a commercial 
playground climber. Tasneem, a four-year-old girl, was hanging from the horizontal ladder 
section of the climbing structure. MC was standing and watching. 
In the vignette above, MC influenced the learning disposition of risk-taking using three 
primary verbal and non-verbal communication strategies. She gave attention verbally and 
through proximity, guided Tasneem’s safety, and affirmed her actions with a voice of 
confidence. MC’s observed goal was for Tasneem to successfully complete the child’s chosen 

 
117
goal of hanging and letting go. For Tasneem, success was hanging from the bar, letting go, and 
landing on the ground without hurting herself. She had chosen to use the climber, and we know it 
was a risk for her because she said that she was scared. MC positioned herself to support 
Tasneem’s plan on the climber and work through her sense of risk. Tasneem jumped from the 
platform and took a risk. MC customized her discourse to this child’s level of risk-taking. 
Attention and proximity. Tasneem did not verbally engage the teacher for attention. She 
stood on the platform, gazed at the teacher, and then looked down. As she held the bar in line 5, 
MC moved closer, noticed a pause in Tasneem’s action, and encouragingly asked if she wanted 
to jump. When she stood beside Tasneem, MC held out her arms and almost held her body. 
MC’s proximity supported Tasneem’s risk-taking because it reinforced their relationship, and the 
proximity signaled safety through the presence of an adult. MC moved physically closer to her 
when Tasneem said, “I’m scared.” MC did not affirm her fear but instead gave her guidance on 
landing safely saying, “Put your feet straight.” MC’s affirmation and gentle voice were attention-
giving moves that seemed to influence Tasneem to take this risk. In this vignette, Tasneem 
received and responded to physical proximity, verbal attention, and affirmation of her risk-taking 
act.  
Establishing a sense of safety. A teacher is responsible for maintaining safety for all 
children. Another type of discursive move supporting risk-taking was guiding safety and 
establishing emotional security. MC influences risk-taking through encouraging and guiding 
children. This responsible and authoritative style is the opposite of an authoritarian teaching 
style, in which children are so fearful of the possibility of getting hurt (or getting reprimanded) 
that they risk nothing. Tasneem felt uncertain and looked to MC with anticipation as she 

 
118
prepared to jump. MC gave specific safety guidance in line 7, “Put your feet straight.” Through 
MC’s words and actions, Tasneem felt a sense of safety. 
Vocally affirming their actions. Throughout the day, MC guided safety and security, for 
example, when she gently moved a child out from under the bars and said, “Thank you. This way 
she can go on the monkey bars and you don't get hurt,” or when she moved the ‘pretend ice 
cream sand’ away saying, “Oops. It looks like we're going to have ice cream spilling. Here's 
some ice cream. Here's your ice cream.” This line acknowledged the value of pretend play and 
maintained safety by moving away a pile of sand on the climber. MC was also observed 
supportively moving a child pretending to be a crab out of the climbing/jumping zone, while 
simultaneously giving attention to the children on the monkey bars. These examples demonstrate 
teacher discourse that encouraged risk-taking through discourse, or her voice and actions. When 
the children looked to MC before trying a new move, she did not embed caution or fear in her 
language, voice tone, or moves. She was instructive, engaging, and encouraged risk-taking while 
maintaining safety.  
Extending tone of voice, safety, proximity. Three discursive moves – confident tone of 
voice, assurance of safety, and proximity—are used again in a prolonged manner in the next two 
sequential vignettes, ‘Box as a Car’ and ‘Aldo in the Box’. These vignettes feature the children 
pretending a four-by-four by three-foot cardboard box was a car on two different days. In the 
first vignette (beginning with table 5.2), the box is introduced to Aldo, and in the second 
(beginning with table 5.20), he enters the box. ‘Box as a Car’ began when MC found Aldo 
disengaged on the playground. He rejected ball play, watering the garden, or riding trikes, but he 
was interested in the large box in the playground storage area. MC had an idea about the box she 
had placed in storage with a console that had been salvaged from a car. She knew Aldo was 

 
119
interested in cars. Together they went in the storage area to find these items. They ultimately 
took the console and the cardboard box out of storage, worked together to move the box onto the 
playground, and made a pretend car. This was an idea developed by MC based on her knowledge 
of the children, specifically Aldo.

The pause in line 117 was intentional to give Aldo time and space to look at the console, hold it

Perhaps he was wondering about the console. He stood still with straight posture. His gaze was 
held on the console as she continued.

agree to build a car with MC.

exclaimed, “NO?” but MC accepted his decision with “ok”. This instance signified the 
opportunity to refuse risk without repercussion. MC immediately moved to another possible risk 
- getting the box out of storage. She offered this uncertain choice coupled with a trusting 
relationship marked by her proximity, his willingness to stay present, and his interest in her 
questions.

This excerpt (see Table 5.7) engaged Aldo in decision making about where to build the 
car. MC asked him questions and read his face and gestures for responses. MC used the pronoun 
we throughout this excerpt, signifying their collaboration and her support of him. At line 149, he 
had taken the risk of moving the box off the sidewalk and onto the sAndie play area. I wonder if 
she knew something of this family’s funds of knowledge (Gonzalez, Moll, Amanti, 1985) that 
caused her to reference Aldo as an auto mechanic.

box off the sidewalk. 
 
 
 
In lines 152 – 154 (see Table 5.8), MC was still standing two feet from the box (from line 
146a, see Table 5.7), and Aldo is taking on all the risk of moving the box by himself. When she 
noticed Aldo struggling to move the box off the sidewalk, she modeled tipping it over, then lifted 
the box onto the sand beside the sidewalk. She seemed to be balancing his risk-taking with 

 
124
sustainability of his risk-taking disposition. How much risk is Aldo willing to take on before he 
walks away?

The box was on the sand with the open side facing toward the sky. The box had to be tipped over 
to make use of it as a car. MC continuously encouraged Aldo to do something with the box (see 
Table 5.9): drive it (line157), what to do (lines 160 and 161), and tip it over (line 163). With all 
this encouragement, Aldo trusted that tipping the box over was an acceptable or safe risk. MC 
tipped it over far enough so that with a little exertion, Aldo could tip the box over completely. At 
this moment, she made the risk-taking task less difficult by simplifying the task. Aldo managed 
this risk-taking because the task was not too big for him.

to the risk of taking the items out of the box. MC supported Aldo as he took the small risk of 
looking in the box.

In this excerpt (see Table 5.11), MC began taking items out of the box. Aldo did not participate. 
He only watched her pull items out (see Figure 6). MC noticed his reluctance and reminded him 
that he was safe. At this moment, reaching in the box was too big a risk for Aldo.

acknowledged that he did not want to do it but repeated the statement that if he didn’t want them 
in his car, he would have to get them out. She influenced risk-taking by connecting to Aldo’s 
desire to have an empty box so he could create a car.

Aldo began to accept the risk-taking invitation from MC (see Table 5.13). She was in the box 
and handing items to him. This approximation of risk helped Aldo be successful. Aldo was not 
going in the box as MC asked, but he did move material out of the box. His nervousness about 
this action was evident in how he darted in and out without making a commitment to going in 
the box. He was taking on risk, but at his comfort level.

moved the foam and piece of packing paper to the mouth of the box. He bent over, picked it up, 
and moved it out of the way.

were doing together. Aldo watched these children fluidly go in and out of the box. MC asked 
Alice for her ideas and invited Kyle to help as well. Aldo was cautious, but MC influenced 
Aldo’s risk-taking by inviting other children to participate in the act of entering the box.

the console stays at school.

Table 5.18 shows the culmination of the vignette. While the other children were conversing with 
MC, Aldo decided to take a risk. He stepped in the box, reached in, and pulled out a piece of 
foam. MC was genuinely delighted. Aldo seemed pleased with himself. The various steps of 

 
132
simplifying and approximating risk culminated with Aldo taking a risk on his own. He reached in 
the box and removed a piece of foam.  
 
The vignette in Table 5.20 took place the next day. Interest in the box as a car remained 
high. Children were going in the box pretending it was a car. Aldo was waiting his turn.

doing in there Aldo? 
 
She opens one flap so he

MC intentionally set the situation for Aldo. She knew he had watched other children go in and 
out of the box, now the pretend car, many times. Aldo had noticed the timer ringing for turns in 
the box and knew his turn was next. MC pointed to exactly the spot where Aldo could sit, so he 
would not have to make a choice about where to sit. She identified the staple in the box as a good 
reason for the box flaps to stay open for Aldo. He might be scared if a child said, “close the 
doors.” MC influenced risk-taking by making this grand risk of going in the car as achievable as 
possible for Aldo.

MC stood close to the box and monitored the other children’s interactions with Aldo in 
the box (see Table 5.21). Andres, Castro, and Alice were all at the door of the box waiting for a 
turn. She reminded Andres to use a soft voice by modeling a soft voice in line 167, and in line 
168 she gently asked Andres to be gentle with the box. Then she used ‘car driving language’ 
with Aldo to make his experience in the box similar to the other children’s. Moving Andres and 
Castro to the side of the box moved them away from the flaps because they were flapping the 
box shut when Aldo wanted the door flaps open. This redirecting of other children helped keep 
Aldo’s risk-taking experience safe and at a level of risk he could manage.

the amount of ambient noise. She also asked additional questions about using the controls (the 
console) or if he wanted a ball to use as a steering wheel. In this way, she gave him control of the 
risk he was taking in entering the box. He could take on more stimuli or just be in the box. He 
chose to just be in the box with the balls beside him.

In Table 5.23, MC responded to children wanting the next turn. Aldo may have felt 
threatened by Andres wanting his turn. MC maintained the turn taking and safety when she 
reminded Andres that she had promised Carrie the next turn. In lines 179 – 186 (not included in a 
Table in-text), MC was chatting with Aldo and giving guidance to children waiting their turn. At 
one moment, she lifted a box flap to talk with him directly and found him sitting and smiling. At 
no point did he feel abandoned or lonely. 
 
Andres was pressuring MC for a turn as Castro ran off to find Carrie. MC managed 
children’s impatience with two strategies. First, she reminded Andres of the process, and second, 
she gave Castro a task to make the time pass more quickly.

These last few seconds of Aldo’s turn, seen in Table 5.24, were spent asking if he wanted 
to extend the risk by pretending with a console. While he did not choose his own challenge, he 
smiled when MC said peek-a -boo at the front door and then the peep holes. This cheerful peek-
a-boo that could be surprising extended Aldo’s perception of risk by the teacher pretending with 
him. When Andres said peek-a-boo at the front door, the timer went off and Aldo’s turn was 
over. 
 
Discussion of teacher discourse and risk-taking. In Tables 5.2 – 5.24, the box was an 
easy environment for independent play for some children, but for Aldo, it was a source of 
curiosity and uncertainty. MC’s teacher discourse -- her confident voice, assurance of safety, and 
proximity -- created a safe setting for Aldo to risk engaging in pretend play with the box. First, 
MC emptied the packing material piece-by-piece out of the box with frequent invitations for 

 
137
Aldo to reach into the box, but he rejected her. With much prompting from MC, they ultimately 
moved the box together. She maintained a voice that conveyed confidence in Aldo’s ability and 
assured him each task was safe. Together they moved the box, tipped it over, and emptied it of 
foam, tape, and other packaging items. 
Statements such as “Do you want to help carry this?” and “Can you reach in?” were small 
challenges or risks for Aldo. In fact, she asked 35 questions in this vignette encouraging his 
engagement with the box. At times, these questions were in response to his curiosity about the 
box becoming a car, while at other times, the questions served to maintain his engagement. There 
were 15 statements of clarification that narrated what she or Aldo were doing. These included 
“We have a box over here” (125), “Let’s take these out” (172), and “And there’s another box” 
(195). In addition, there were 15 challenge statements that were more direct moves to stimulate 
his engagement such as “Come on over here and push” (137), “Come on and help me tip it over” 
(163), “Go back and get those things” (said in a humorous tone of voice), and “What are they 
doing in there?” (192). There was a balance in her challenges between pushing his risk-taking 
and maintaining an emotionally safe climate, such as when she injects, “It’s ok. You’re safe” in 
line 177. MC’s actions, statements of clarification, and challenge statements influenced Aldo’s 
risk-taking disposition. First, she provided strong encouragement to help move the box. And she 
created space for Aldo to watch MC and other children pull packing materials out of the box. 
Then she placed strips of paper within his reach for him to pull out. And finally, he bent his body 
into the box and pulled out a piece of foam in line 221. 
Making micro-risks helps Aldo manage risk. MC incrementally minimized risk-taking 
for Aldo using a strategy I call micro-risks. In138 lines of transcript, Tables 5.2 – 5.19, MC made 
micro-risk statements – a series of baby steps that divided the risk into smaller segments. Micro-

 
138
risks precede and build up to the risk-taking task or event. The sequence of statements from MC 
represents micro-risks. The importance of these measured micro-risks was found in how they 
kept this child motivated and engaged. While he was simultaneously interested in this uncertain 
task with the box, he was hesitant to accept the actions MC posed to him. Each time he said no or 
refused to remove an item on his own, she made the task smaller. She made these challenges 
small enough to be acceptable to Aldo, cutting his sense of risk-taking into bite size pieces to 
make risk digestible for Aldo. Her moves identified his interest, challenged and maintained his 
risk-taking with micro-risks, and created novel micro-risks to hold his attention. MC also knew 
when he had enough and facilitated the invitation with Alice to drive away on the school bus 
tricycle. The next day, they revisited the box. Micro-risks continue from Box as a car (Tables 5.2 
-5.19) to ‘Aldo in the Box’ (Table 5.20 -5.24) on the second day. 
Building upon previous risk-taking actions. In the entirety of Box as a Car, the box was 
an easy environment for independent play for some children, but for Aldo, it was a source of 
curiosity and uncertainty. The next day, they revisited the box. Micro-risks continue from Box as 
a car to Aldo in the Box on the second day. The next vignette, Aldo in the Box, began the next 
day, when many children took turns going in the box, pretending they were driving a car. MC 
was monitoring turns and encouraging Aldo to go in the box. Many children went in, and some 
chose loose materials or parts to use as steering wheels or seats. When Aldo finally went in the 
box, he went alone with no parts.  
MC conveyed confidence. Voice, safety, proximity, and micro-risks were used to support 
risk-taking. Throughout these two vignettes, MC’s voice was confident and assuring as she 
communicated with Aldo as he entered the box. “It's Aldo's turn and then Carrie’s” (line 155) 
and “Aldo can sit right there” (line 157) both communicated confidence to Aldo through the 

 
139
absence of a questioning tone in MC’s voice. Her tone was affirmative and steady, not 
questioning or reedy. She conveyed confidence in his ability to sit in the box and pretend it was a 
car. Then, she affirmed his pretending by asking a question she asked of all children ‘driving’ the 
box, “Where are you going? Can you go to the store and get us some oranges?” (line 169). The 
use of this assured, consistent, and affirming tone of voice influenced Aldo’s risk-taking. 
Creating emotional safety for Aldo. Discursive moves assuring safety are often moves 
that boost emotional safety in support of risk-taking, not necessarily a health and wellness 
concern. Each statement MC made about safety in this vignette also supported risk-taking. “That 
trunk will stay open because we have a staple through it” (line 162) communicated that she knew 
Aldo needed the box open to feel safe, yet the staple was the reason for it to remain open. MC 
did not say something like, “That trunk will stay open because Aldo is scared in the dark.” Her 
statement about keeping the trunk open affirmed the presence of light in the box without 
verbalizing Aldo’s possible fear of the dark or bringing attention to his concern about being in 
the box. Additionally, line 170, “Okay, let's move to the side so he can drive. You're standing in 
front of his car,” announced to all the children that Aldo was in the box and driving the car. The 
line appeared to be a reminder of safety, but it was also a directive to clear the space around the 
box. Consequently, the box did not get bumped while Aldo was inside. Then she made a direct 
statement about emotional safety, when she reminded Andres to be gentle when he was slapping 
the flap and making a big noise that might be scary. “Gentle, Gentle, gentle that's a big noise. 
That might be scary.” (line 171). With this move, she reminded Andres what to do, “be gentle”, 
and signaled to Aldo that she knew the big noise might be scary, and that he was taking a risk 
with the unknown area inside the box. This acknowledgement of Aldo’s concerns may have 
served to help him feel calmer. He could hear that MC was aware of the noise, and that she had it 

 
140
under control. Five statements following this line continued to bolster Aldo in the box and lend 
him control of his experience, such as, line 173, “Do you want controls?”, line 174, “No? Okay. 
There’s a ball you can use for the steering wheel if you want.”?”, a cheerful “Peek-a boo,” in 
lines 191,192,193. MC knew Aldo well and made overt and subtle moves and statements 
supportive of his emotional state (safety). Her discursive moves provided the necessary support 
for him to risk entering the box. 
MC supported micro-risks with proximity. MC used proximity along with micro-risks. 
The first micro-risk occurred when MC respected Aldo’s concern with entering the box. She kept 
him proximate to the box, inviting him to try driving the car nine times before he entered. These 
invitational moves or micro-risks held his interest and continued to challenge him. She answered 
his questions about the box and reminded him of when his turn would be. He stood quietly and 
watched intently as other children went in and out of the box. Later, she guided Aldo into the 
box, engaged him in pretend play, and sustained his calm demeanor.  
Approximating Risk 
This next vignette was set again on the playground climbing structure. MC was 
supporting Alice’s goal of hanging from the bar, letting go, and jumping to the sand (see Figure 
7). Jesus was in the tunnel behind the platform where Alice was standing. She was scared and 
MC negotiated an approximation of the hanging and letting go risk, to standing on the four-foot-
high platform and jumping.

MC guided Alice in a series of moves that moved her closer to her stated goal of jumping 
in Table 5.25. At the start, Alice reached out and hung from the monkey bar. MC addressed 
Alice in multiple ways in lines 39-41. First, she held Alice’s waist as she hung from her hands. 
Using an affirming question, MC said, “Okay. You’re going to jump down?!?” Next, in an 
ascending voice inferring a question asked, “Jump down?” However, Alice had placed her feet 
back on the platform.

Alice was not touching the bars, and in line 44, she said “I scareeed”. MC did not affirm Alice’s 
fear.

MC doubled her engagement with Alice in Table 5.27, presenting an approximation of 
the jump to be taken, and indicating that Alice could jump from the platform and not from the 
hanging position. She did not change the goal of jumping but offered an approximate solution 
instead. She said the word ‘Okay’ a fourth time in line 45, “Okay. Now what you can do is you 

 
143
can get on here (pointing to the platform) and you can jump to here (pointing to the ground). You 
want to jump from here?” Importantly, MC did not directly address or repeat Alice’s statement 
that she was scared; instead MC said, “Okay” to acknowledge Alice’s emotion.

These two lines in Table 5.28 were a period of recalculation. Alice was standing on the 
platform, and she pointed to the place she intended to land on with her toe. At the same time, MC 
noticed her shoe needed tying. This attention to safety was also an act of a person-to-person 
connection. The act of shoe tying gave Alice five seconds to pause and perhaps gather herself.

In Table 5.29, Jesus distracted Alice when he asked her to stand back. MC interpreted his 
request for Alice, so Alice understood that he wanted to roll the ball through the tunnel to her on 
the platform. She had the choice of two risks here. She could respond to Jesus (a risk due to his 
unpredictability) and accept the ball, or continue with her intent to jump. In line 51, MC 
maintained focus on the jump and asked her again if she wanted to jump. The pause may have 
relieved Alice of some anxiety she felt about jumping, and MC maintained focus and continued 
to encourage her risk taking.

encouraging facial expression of a smile. When Alice said, “I can’t,” MC did not argue with her 
or try to change her mind. Instead, she gave her a new option, stating, “Practice jumping” (line 
55). This approximation of the task encouraged Alice and kept her focused on the risk-taking 
task, not her fear of jumping.

Discussion of approximating risk. The teacher adapted her discourse to meet the risk-
taking levels of each child and additionally, she shaped risk-taking to meet the risk-taking goals 
and abilities of each child. Shaping risk-taking describes teacher moves made with the child, 
planning, guiding the child, or setting up the environment to create risk-taking opportunities 
appropriate to each child. For example, in Tables 5.2 – 5.19 when Aldo and MC were moving 
the box, MC divided a task into small steps or micro-risks, creating manageable risk-taking 
opportunities. In a similar manner, in Tables 5.25 – 5.31, she approximated risk when she guided 
Alice to jump rather than hang and let go. This created a smaller, more doable risk and helped 
her consider a larger risk. She helped the child plan, anticipate risk, and execute a doable task. 
Micro-risks break down the tasks toward the child’s risk-taking goal.   
Similar to micro-risks, approximation of risk involves subtly changing or approximating 
the risk-taking goal to accommodate the child’s risk-taking ability. Approximation of risk is 
different from micro-risks. With approximation of risk the teacher described variations of what 
the child was doing and made small approximations of the end goal, rather than how micro-risk 

 
147
used language to expand or hold their interest – not changing or approximating the end goal, but 
adapting the path or process to attain the end goal.  
In the vignette represented in Tables 5.25-5.31, MC approximated risk to help move 
Alice toward a larger risk. She changed the risk-taking goal from jumping from hanging to 
jumping from the platform. MC added approximation of risk to the strategies of voice tone, 
safety, and proximity and adapted the risk to fit the child. 
In this vignette of coaching Alice’s jump, the teacher utilized the strategy of 
approximating risk and additionally she inserted a discursive move of assigning the risk-taking 
task. First, MC approximated Alice’s intended risk. She presented risks that were not jumping 
from hanging but jumping from the platform, which was an approximation of the hang and jump 
risk. As she moved Alice toward her stated goal of jumping, she did not scaffold in the 
traditional educational sense of giving temporary supports that are incrementally removed. 
Instead, MC approximated the jumping task to build Alice up toward the task of hanging and 
jumping by modifying the initial goal.  
Second, MC assigned the risk-taking task to Alice. She was not jumping “because you 
are brave,” or “your brother will be so proud”. Instead, she was jumping because it was a risk she 
had established, and MC reflected Alice’s ownership of the risk using the pronoun ‘you’ four 
times. It was always Alice’s risk. MC remained focused on Alice completing this risk-taking task 
and kept Alice focused on the task, not the distractions or the fear. MC influenced Alice’s 
motivation for risk-taking by approximating the task when it appeared uncertain and maintained 
Alice’s focus on the task.  Additionally, MC gave Alice ownership of the risk which conveys the 
power of risk-taking to the child. 
 

 
148
Planning for Risk-Taking 
Planning with a child to influence risk-taking is an additional strategy used in this study 
to influence the learning disposition of risk-taking. In the following description, the child named 
Irene, was guided toward the risk of sharing her work with the whole class. This was labeled as a 
risk because of the level of encouragement Irene needed to share with the group after she had 
shared easily with the teacher. MC supported Irene’s sharing of a drawing through a series of 
verbal exchanges that planned Irene’s sharing with the class at circle time.  
Morning Circle was the time of day about 15 minutes after arrival when all the children 
and adults (teacher, assistant, speech therapist) in the room sat on the rug in a circle to start the 
day. They sang a few group songs, shared ideas, and discussed the plan for the school day. This 
vignette began at arrival time when parents were entering the classroom with their children. This 
vignette was too expansive for a Table, but the transcript can be found in Appendix F. The 
children put away their backpacks, washed their hands, and sat down with their parent to write in 
their paperback journal. This day, Irene drew a picture and wrote words with her mother in the 
form of a joke. MC was working with three other children when Irene brought her journal to 
MC, who held the journal, smiled, and pointed to the words. In line 97, Irene read, “I am you. 
Ha, ha, ha.” MC said, “‘I am you, ha, ha, ha’. You put words in your picture. This is beautiful. It 
looks a joke picture. Do you want to share this with the class? It’s a nice joke. Let’s mark this 
spot. If you go to my computer, you will see the star post-it notes, and you can mark the spot, so 
we know where it is.” (lines 98-100). 
In these three lines above, MC positioned Irene as a writer of a joke that would be of 
interest to the class. MC also gave Irene the authority to retrieve the post-it notes from the 
teacher’s desk. Irene returned to MC, who said, “Yeah, that’s it. You can take it off and mark 

 
149
your book” (line 105). Irene placed the post-it in the journal page. MC greeted a few more 
children and then said, “So that will be your marker. … Would you please put this [the post-its] 
back, so I know where it is?” (line 112). Irene put the post-it notes back on MC’s desk. As 
children continued to enter the room, Irene held her journal for the next eight minutes. She 
placed it on the chalkboard ledge for sharing during Morning Circle. The children sat down in a 
circle, sang songs, and after five minutes, MC said, “So Irene, you had something you wanted to 
share” (line 346). Irene looked up with hesitation on her face. MC “If I look up at the board and I 
see Irene’s journal…” Irene slowly stands, picks her way around a few children, and gets her 
journal with the marked page. She walks back to her place with a very neutral expression on her 
face looking down. She returns to her place and sits down. MC then cues her in lines 349 and 
350, “Alright Irene. So, she’s got her journal, and she marked it, so she knows right where it is, 
what she wants to share. OK.” MC planned Irene’s risk-taking when she narrated Irene’s plan to 
share (marking the place in the journal), committed to share (placing the journal on the ledge), 
and cued Irene to share with the class. This was the first time Irene shared her writing and 
drawing at circle, and this was the first time she had written words with her picture, so she was 
venturing into an unknown and uncertain experience. MC continued to support Irene as she 
nodded to her and cued her to read. “I am you, Ha, Ha, Ha.” Irene read the words with her face 
down, appearing very shy, and snapped the journal shut. It seemed that she wanted to be done 
sharing. Then, MC pushed her risk-taking a bit more and said in lines 352 -355: “So, so, so …. 
show the picture.” Irene turned the journal toward the class. Then MC said, “Can you walk 
around so everyone can see the picture?” Irene slowly stood up and as she was slowing walking 
around the circle (see Figure 8), MC finished with “So, it’s a joke. Irene wrote a joke.” And MC 

 
150
empowered Irene when she continuously acknowledged her ownership of the work and the risk-
taking task. 
  
Figure 8. Irene is showing the class her journal. 
 
Discussion of planning for risk-taking. Together MC and Irene planned for risk-taking. 
MC gave her responsibility for preparation. MC asked Irene to ‘enter’ the private area of her 
desk and directed her to complete teacher tasks (marking the page, returning the post-its, and 
preparing for circle). This move of shared responsibility with the teacher empowered Irene. 
Although Irene felt uncertainty about sharing her work, MC facilitated Irene’s plan for sharing, 
reminded Irene of her risky plan to share, asked her to share, and asked her to walk the picture 
around the circle.  
Irene’s emotional risk was observed in her hesitancy about taking action. She risked her 
creation being found silly. With MC’s encouragement and security through planned risk-taking, 
Irene took the risk of sharing even though the outcome was uncertain. In this way, planned risk-
taking is another form of scaffolding risk (along with micro-risks and approximating risk). 
Planned risk-taking is a form of teacher attention similar to descriptive attention, except the 
attention giver describes the act or creation before the child does it. Planned risk-taking can give 

 
151
value or empowerment to the child’s expressed thought process and give the child space to 
correct or adjust the plan.  
Teacher’s Management of her own Sense of Risk-Taking 
A teacher’s attitude toward risk can influence a child’s attitude toward risk-taking. The 
teacher in this study made discursive moves with confidence that seemed to communicate an 
acceptance or plan for risk-taking. She also made choices for her classroom that had uncertain 
(or risky) outcomes, including hanging and jumping and entering a box. The following vignettes 
demonstrate an attitude toward risk-taking that is calm. The teacher never projects an uncertainly 
or concern about risk. MC manages her own sense of risk, so children try things they might not 
consider with another teacher. 
Risk-taking with Speech and Self-help. The following two vignettes, represented by 
Tables 5.32 – 5.36 and a narrative of pouring water, in which children have the option to pour 
their own water, communicate the teacher’s acceptance of risk-taking and comfort with creating 
space for children to take risks.  
 
MC kept a gallon jug of water on the play yard on a table or bench, so children could 
pour water for themselves. One day, while on the playground, MC was sitting on the bench 
pouring water for children or helping them pour.

chose to ask Andres to try holding the heavy jug and putting on the top. While this may not be a 
risk-taking task for an adult, it could be daunting for a young child.

attention to the risk of the “full” and “heavy” jug, narrating his pouring with a confident voice. 
Line 45 draws attention to Andres’ ability with the phrase “Oh, you got it,” instead of a teacher-
directed phrase such as “I’m so proud of you,” or deficient praise such as “And you didn’t spill a 
drop.”

building on Andres’ possible act of practicing at home. This child receives speech support, so 
engaging in conversation is a risk for him. Andres struggled to speak in line 47 and looked into 
MC’s face for support. Her steady gaze and gentle smile lent support.

MC’s continuous attention to and support of Andres’ communication encouraged talking 
in Table 5.36. In line 49, she ignored Irene waving her cup to be filled and gently waited for 
Andres to compose and speak his words. When a child struggles to be understood, talking can be 
a risk. MC supportively rephrased his comment in line 53, drawing attention to Andres’ ability to 
get water from the refrigerator on his own.  
 
In the vignette above, MC did not communicate concern about getting wet while sharing 
the bench with Andres, spilling water, or taking this risk with children. She set aside any concern 
she might have about spilled water and handed Andres the jug to let him pour. Ignoring other 
children, she gave Andres her full attention. Using a voice of confidence, she made conversation 
supportive of his ability.  
 
Another day in the playground, MC had planned to pour water into paper cups for 
Andres, but she asked Ms. Andie to help him instead. When Ms. Andie looked at the table, 
Andres had already started to pour. As he poured, MC said, “Oh, I think he could get it. Can you 

 
156
pour me a glass, too?” Ms. Andie said, “Hey Andres, how's it going? Look for the opening, yup. 
Here ya [sic] go.” This gave him the opportunity to say, “I want to pour it myself.” He poured 
one for himself and one for MC, and Ms. Andie said, “This is MC's? Oh, that's very nice of you. 
And this one is yours? Nice job”. The teacher dialogue communicated confidence about Andres 
pouring independently, and their language acknowledged his ability with positive and 
informative comments. Both MC and Ms. Andie were aware of the possibility of unknown 
outcome such as spilled water but did not express concern. MC encouraged this potentially 
messy action by making it accessible to all children. She supported the action with her positive 
language and actions. 
Risk-Taking throughout the Day 
 
Opportunities for risk-taking occurred in the indoor classroom as well in the outdoor 
classroom (as shown above). Morning Circle often included opportunities for children to name a 
novel motion or movement to go with a song. When children pretended to fly like dragons with 
large arm motions, MC guided and reminded them to keep their hands safely away from a friend 
as they flew around the circle area. The permission of big arm motions supported risk-taking 
because children were trusted to keep each other safe. Furthermore, when they were ‘jumping 
their sillies out’ in one song, she paused the song to remind children to stay on the edge of the 
rug and a safe distance between one another. During the study, MC never refused a move 
because it was too dangerous. One time, three children were tugging on a stuffed animal toy (a 
snake named Snakey) in the middle of the circle. In this case, the risk of a negative outcome was 
too high, so MC calmly focused on “keeping Snakey safe” and moved the children out of the 
circle to resolve the struggle by conveying calm as she talked privately with the children. MC 
exercised classroom management balancing risk-taking and creativity with group safety. She 

 
157
gave instruction before the action and trusted children to maintain safety or managed the action 
before it resulted in a negative consequence, allowing children to try a movement with an 
uncertain outcome that could be perceived as dangerous. 
During the school day, after snack and before the final group, there was a period        of 
30 – 40 minutes called ‘Investigations’. During this block of time, the class of 4 and 5-year-old 
children had opportunities to make activity choices on their own. Options included working at 
the Legos table, playing in the dramatic play area, block building, painting, using manipulatives, 
reading, or investigating the science area. While not an uncommon practice in early education, 
MC’s period of ‘investigations’ was unique because of her ability to risk an unknown outcome 
among the children. She had established external controls such as be kind, walk, and use 
resources wisely. Within these parameters, she risked children creating an unknown outcome 
such as constructing a very tall block building, painting at the easel with both hands, or creating 
a fiesta in dramatic play. On various days, she even had two live rabbits hop around loose in the 
classroom. She trusted the children to be kind to the rabbits. She created risk-taking opportunities 
in the classroom and created rules and norms with the children, trusting the children to honor the 
established controls. MC demonstrated comfort with ambiguity, a diminished need for absolute 
control, and trust in the children to make productive or creative choices. MC demonstrated a 
comfort with risk as a learning disposition. 
Discussion 
Discursive moves for risk-taking. This research suggests discursive moves teachers can 
make to increase risk-taking as a learning disposition in early childhood education. Risk-taking 
appears most frequently in the early education literature in work supporting outdoor play 
(Cooper, 2015; Harper, 2017; Maynard, Waters, & Clement, 2013; Rivkin, 1995), rough and 

 
158
tumble play (Smith, 2017; Storli & Sandseter, 2015) and policy (Harper 2017; Little, 2006), but 
only one article (Nolan, Taket, & Stagnitti, 2014) described teacher affect. Nolan, Taket, & 
Stagnitti (2014), focused on the role of the teacher in supporting children’s resilience whose 
families are experiencing the presence of at least two challenges such as poverty, unemployment, 
insecure employment, insecure housing, divorce, separation, bereavement, family violence, and 
chronic health problems within the family. They described resilience as a human capacity that 
can be developed and strengthened in all people. The studies mentioned above highlight the 
importance of risk-taking, and Nolan, Take & Stagnitti (2014) describe the role of the teacher. 
However, I did not find a study that linked the role of the teacher to the support of risk-taking.  
 
I argue that deeper attention to teacher discourse can further develop risk-taking in young 
children. I specifically name three discursive teaching moves that influence risk-taking: the 
manner in which attention is given, the manner in which safety and confidence is established and 
maintained, and the scaffolding of risk-taking. These additions to the literature will clarify ways 
in which a teacher can support risk-taking to help build resilience, problem-solving, and 
independence; it will also add to understanding how risk-taking can be incorporated in a 
preschool classroom (Little, 2006; Nolan, Taket, & Stagnitti, 2014; Smith, 2017; Storli & 
Sandseter, 2015). 
 
Attention. This study adds to the research on risk-taking by arguing that the attention 
given a child through detailed words and actions of a teacher are critical. Previous studies of the 
effect of the teacher in the development of resilience related to risk-taking focused on 
environment, relationships, and practices. These studies highlighted aspects such as building 
relationships (Carver, Timperio, & Crawford, 2008; Mackett et al., 2007a), developing self-
regulation, promoting social-emotional learning (Nolan, Taket & Stagnitti, 2014), and providing 

 
159
positive reinforcement and consistency (Rissotto & Tonucci, 2002). However, they did not 
consider the complex space and discourse in teacher and child interactions. These prior studies 
describe what to do but not how to do it. In contrast, my study describes the quality and type of 
attention MC provides as found in the verbal context of descriptive attention, verbal attention, 
and non-proximity. 
Descriptive attention. Descriptive attention can be observed when a teacher describes the 
child’s actions and words and implies the child’s ownership of the action. When MC said, “Good 
job” in line 8 of Table 5.1, she was describing Tasneem’s act. Her utterance would have been 
more descriptive if she had said, “Good job jumping, Tasneem.” MC did not deliver a form of 
praise attention, which is attention given to a child containing verbal superlatives dependent 
upon the attention giver, such as if MC said, “I really like how you jump.” Instead, descriptive 
attention describes the action, empowers the child, and positively influences risk-taking by 
giving positive feedback specifically about the child’s idea or action. In Table 5.1, MC described 
to Tasneem what she had accomplished and was pleased by her actions but did not use reflexive 
words such as “I am so proud of you.” This method of describing the action helps the act belong 
to the child, and their ability to try an uncertain act is their accomplishment. 
Non-verbal attention. Non-verbal attention is found in facial expressions such as an 
accepting smile, an open body position with both arms relaxed at the teacher’s side, and gentle 
touch. It is a form of communication that begins early in life. A baby first learns non-verbal 
communication when they recognize the pleased faces of caregivers. This learning precedes 
language learning and remains an important communicative tool throughout early childhood 
(Brazelton & Sparrow, 2003). The teacher in this study used non-verbal communication 
specifically with early language learners and second language learners and also with all children. 

 
160
Throughout the study, MC was nodding her head in agreement, smiling at children as she 
listened, and being relaxed whenever a child was processing uncertainty, for example, when 
Alice was attempting to jump. Positive, affirming non-verbal attention was used to encourage 
risk-taking dispositions. 
Physical proximity. The third effective mode of giving attention to risk-taking is through 
physical proximity. When a teacher stands near a child taking a risk, the proximity can create a 
form of physical attention and convey a sense of safety or security (Neill, 1991). Examples of 
this behavior include MC being near Alice, touching Tasneem when they jumped, and remaining 
close to the box as Aldo was placing himself in a very uncertain space. MC determined the 
appropriate proximity to a risk-taking child according to the level of risk or uncertainty she felt 
the child was expressing.  
 
Safety and confidence. In these excerpts, MC created physical safety and emotional 
safety through conveying confidence to the children. Her voice tone was positive when she told 
Andres to “look for the opening”, instead of a phrase such as, “look out!” or “be careful not to 
spill it all over the table.” She kept a neutral (not anxious) tone and was never loud or abrupt. 
Voice tone is important for emotional safety because a child could associate a loud or abrupt tone 
with a problem or mistake the child had created. As with Aldo and the box, her tone was neither 
overly concerned, dismissive, or anxious. She never used a negative or uncertain tone of voice 
that could undermine a child’s confidence. Her tone of voice was one of the factors that enabled 
children to work with uncertainty. Through her voice, she conveyed her belief in their ability to 
achieve their learning goal. 
Maintaining a constant field of safety was also important in influencing risk-taking. 
Children who trust the environment are more willing to test uncertainty (Jirout & Klahr, 2012). 

 
161
She kept Aldo feeling safe by controlling the sound level in the box and assuring some box flaps 
would be open for him to have light. When Tasneem was jumping, she kept the area below her 
cleared of children to avoid collisions, as well as guided Tasneem’s foot position, so she would 
land safely. The general maintenance of a sense of safety gives children less fear of uncertainty 
(Briggs‐Gowan, Pollak, Grasso, Voss, Mian, & Zobel, 2015). Thus, MC’s assurance of safety 
supported and influenced children’s willingness to take up a known risk. 
 
Scaffolding. The idea of micro-risks, approximation of risk, and planning for risk adds 
nuance to literature about scaffolded learning. Described as an instructional technique, 
scaffolded learning moves children from one level of understanding toward a stronger 
understanding in which the teacher, named by Vygotsky as the trusted other, provides 
appropriate levels of temporary support; this helps students reach higher levels of understanding 
that they would not be able to achieve without assistance (Vygotsky, 1978; Moll, 2013). In the 
context of this study, scaffolding is not only an academic learning concept. Scaffolding can also 
be used to develop learning dispositions. Therefore, I argue to expand the concept of scaffolded 
learning to include scaffolding a risk-taking goal. 
Scaffolding risk-taking involves invitational moves in which the teacher adapts the tasks 
toward a goal, approximates the goal, or plans for the goal and thereby establishing, shaping, and 
supporting the risk-taking task and scaffolding a child toward a risk-taking goal. In this way, 
risk-taking can be a scaffolded learning disposition. The trusted other can approximate the risk 
through descriptive analysis of the goal, make statements of clarification narrating what the child 
is doing, or make challenge statements to stimulate engagement. In this study, risk was 
scaffolded through three strategies: micro-risks, approximation of risk, and planned risk-taking. 
These three strategies are all forms of shaping scaffolding, similar but different. 

 
162
Micro-risks. Micro-risks involve dividing the process of meeting the risk-taking goal into 
smaller, more manageable pieces, but not changing the goal.  This was seen in Tables 5.2 – 5.19 
where MC worked with Aldo by understanding his comfort zone (which parallels Vygotsky’s 
(1978) zone of proximal development) and calculated the next risk-taking move with the support 
of the trusted other. In her interactions with Aldo, MC calculated each move from removing 
items from the box, to watching other children go in the box, and scaffolded Aldo toward the 
goal of sitting in the box. MC placed him in a position of greater comfort, thus removing the 
level of uncertainty he was experiencing, without changing the end goal of going in the box. He 
was interested in transforming the box into a car. First, he held the box and helped move it in 
small steps. Then, when he was unwilling to reach in the box, and MC kept pulling items out of 
the box, moving pieces close to him, until finally he pulled a piece of packing twine out of the 
box. The next day he watched others go in the box as a car and went in himself when his turn 
arrived. 
Micro-risks can be seen in a classroom setting. For example, when a child appears 
uncertain to finger paint, the teacher can give the child a peg to move the paint, and then let them 
shift to using their fingers to move the paint once they are comfortable using the peg. The teacher 
has changed the process of the risk-taking task, but the end goal of finger-painting on the paper 
using fingers (not a brush or a peg) has been maintained.  The teacher added the micro-risk of 
using a peg thus adding a step to the process of the ultimate goal of painting with fingers. 
Approximation of risk. Approximation of risk is adjusting the risk-taking goal, so it is 
doable. This concept is similar to micro-risks but different because approximation of risk 
involves changing the risk-taking goal, not simply adapting the process of achieving the goal. 
This was best observed when MC noticed that Alice was too uncertain to hang from the bar and 

 
163
drop to the ground. Instead of encouraging her to try an overwhelming risk or telling her to try 
later, she changed the risk to jumping from the platform.  MC approximated the risk-taking goal. 
This placed Alice in a position of greater comfort, thus removing the level of uncertainty she was 
experiencing. 
Planned risk-taking. Planned risk-taking is a type of scaffolding that involves moving 
from a known risk in planned stages to a greater challenge with the help of a trusted other. As 
seen with Irene planning to share her journal, MC moved Irene from marking the place in her 
journal, to placing the journal near the reading circle, to showing it to the class, and ultimately 
walking the journal around the circle to show her classmates. Each act was planned and built (or 
scaffolded) upon the other. These children learned to take risks through the scaffolding of the 
trusted other. The planning through the use of demonstrative statements act to scaffold the risk. 
These findings demonstrate how risk-taking can be identified as an act with an uncertain 
outcome that could be perceived as dangerous or embodying some level of fear. In other words, 
when a child learns to face uncertainty by taking on risk, they learn to work with uncertainty. 
This learning enables them to take on related learning dispositions and other types of risk. For 
example, curiosity relies on the ability to consider the unknown – an unknown physical entity or 
an unknown idea. Without comfort with risk, children would be less willing to explore the 
unknown, and the unknown includes problem-solving. Learning includes engaging with 
problems that involve a set of circumstances without a solution. Therefore, learning can be 
facilitated when a child is willing to risk entering an uncertain experience. When children learn 
to risk, they learn to explore the unknown. For this reason, risk-taking is an important learning 
disposition to be added to ECE literature. 

 
164
Resilience and persistence are included in chapter 2 among lists of learning dispositions.  
They are commonly understood and the terms are more palatable than risk-taking, and I agree 
that they are important. However, I argue that risk-taking is misunderstood. Risk-taking can be 
viewed as a negative behavior of trying something dangerous or ill-advised, but when risk-taking 
is viewed as the ability to respond to uncertainty, it has a positive image. Persistence is the 
ability to return to or persist with a problem despite setbacks, and resilience is seen when 
someone persists or continues working with a task past the expected time of completion or in 
spite of opposition (Claxton & Carr, 2004; Katz, 1998). Resilience is similar yet different than 
persistence because resilience is an ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or 
change (Claxton & Carr, 2002, p 14). Both resilience and persistence describe how a person 
approaches a problem or challenge, whereas risk-taking is the action taken to meet a problem or 
challenge. I argue that a child must first take action toward a problem before they can be resilient 
with the setbacks or persist toward a solution. Risk-taking is an essential learning disposition 
because it enables or prepares a child for many other learning dispositions. In addition, risk-
taking involves moving from a place of less knowledge or skill, a position of uncertainty, to a 
place of knowing. Managing uncertainty is an important aspect of learning, so risk-taking must 
be added as a learning disposition.

Chapter 6: Voice 
Introduction 
Voice is more than the sounds uttered or sung by a person. In this study, voice was 
named as a learning disposition because it enables the enactment of knowledge and skill. Voice 
includes the right to be heard, contribute, and have influence. When a child has voice, their 
thinking and ideas are taken into consideration by others, including peers, teachers, parents, and 
also less influential people, such as school volunteers or store clerks. Voice motivates a child 
toward the learning goal of being understood. In this way, I argue for voice to be viewed as a 
learning disposition because motivation toward a learning goal is supported when a child is heard 
or has influence (Katz, 1988, 1993b). It is about a child figuring out how to be heard, as well as 
how to negotiate for a place in a conversation or social/play engagement.  
The literature on learning dispositions includes communication (Carr, 2006) as a learning 
disposition, expressing ideas and feelings. Voice is expression and enables the enactment of 
knowledge and skills to be understood by others. In this way, voice can serve as an “affective 
and cultural filter for learning trajectories” (Carr et al., 2010, p. 15) because expressions of 
opinion, will, choice, desire, or right are grounded in a child’s lived experience (Esteban-Guitart 
& Moll, 2014). Just as voice can be supported by interactive experiences in an environment with 
important adults, such as parents and educators, and peers, it can also be weakened by these 
same influences (Bertram & Pascal, 2002). This literature on communication relates to the 
importance of voice. 
Voice can reside with commonly named learning dispositions such as curiosity, 
persistence, independence, and resilience (Bertram & Pascal, 2002; Katz, 1988) as well as 
confidence, courage and curiosity, trust and playfulness, perseverance, and responsibility (Carr, 
1998) because voice too enables the enactment of knowledge and skills. The Arizona Early 

 
166
Learning Standards (2018) list curiosity, creativity, attentiveness and persistence, and reasoning 
and problem-solving as approaches to learning (pp.41- 65), a parallel term for learning 
dispositions. Katz (1988, 1993b) connects approaches to learning to the definition of learning 
dispositions as tendencies or habits of thinking that influence behaving or speaking in a manner 
that satisfies or moves a person toward a learning goal. Voice as a learning disposition follows 
this definition because it is an environmentally sensitive behavior and be supported or weakened 
through engagements with significant adults or peers (Bertram & Pascal, 2002). Voice, defined 
as the expression of knowledge, ideas, and sense-making, is essential in moving a person toward 
a learning goal. Voice can be a single expression or an exchange or dialogue with another or 
group of people. Although voice is not commonly named as a learning disposition, this study 
argues for its inclusion. 
 
In this chapter, I examine the ways MC influenced the development of voice through the 
use of voice with the children in her classroom. I coded voice as expression that enables the 
enactment of knowledge and skills to be understood by others. It is seen when children’s ideas 
are taken into consideration by others including peers, teachers, and parents. Included in this 
chapter are examples of children communicating their right to be heard and engage, their sense-
making, and their right to be understood. Communication that develops voice is a dialogic 
engagement, a mediation, not a one-way engagement. This teacher demonstrated and valued 
children’s emergent linguistic ability when she supported children as they made bids for 
participation instead of being silenced. The focal point of this chapter demonstrates the ways a 
teacher can influence voice as a learning disposition by making space for emergent linguistic 
ability, articulation, acceptance of alternative identities, and the expression of opinion, will, 
choice, desire, or rights. 
 

 
167
 
Throughout this classroom research, children were heard expressing opinions, making 
choices, and expressing needs. Filming occurred at the end of the school year, and the dialogic 
practices were apparent as children expressed their opinions with the expectation of being heard 
and communicating with MC. There were six languages represented in the class: Spanish, 
Nepalese, Yoruba, Chinese, English, and Farsi. MC spoke English, rudimentary Spanish, and 
gave much effort to understanding all children’s spoken and signed language, used elements of 
other languages, and gave time to understand those with enunciation delays. The following 
vignettes demonstrate how MC supported the voices of children. 
Voice Expressed in Emergent Abilities 
 
In the next two vignettes, Tables 6.1 – 6.8, MC influenced voice through her engagement 
with children whose spoken language was emerging. In Voice in Speech Delays, MC listened and 
responded to Castro, a four-year-old child with speech delays (Table 6.1 – 6.4).  She also listened 
and responded to Sarah whose primary language was Spanish in Tables 6.4 - 6.8 in Voice in a 
Second Language. Sarah combined Spanish, English and a form of sign language she used with 
her father.  
 
Voice in speech delays. During a spin art session, six children were waiting for a turn. 
Castro was standing near MC, waiting his turn and looking at the colors as Alice squeezed paint 
from a bottle onto the plate to be spun. Alice put cyan (blue) and yellow in the spinner, and MC 
was struggling to make the spinner lid work (see Table 6.1).

Castro was looking on at Alice spinning yellow and blue together. Castro made an energetic 
comment that he wanted to see it, “It gonna do it like bue [sic]!” He had an idea and is 
expressing his idea, but MC was working with Alice and did not ask Castro to be quiet. It can be 
assumed she heard him, but she did not respond.

At this moment, in line 312 (see Table 6.4), MC provided space for Castro’s voice by 
listening carefully to him and then pausing for eight seconds to make sense of his utterance. 
Castro was watching the blue and yellow blend in the spinner and connecting this visual image 
with Little Blue and Little Yellow (Lionni, 2011), a book they had read as a class. In this book, 
the little blue blob and his friend little yellow blob hugged and made green. Mommy and Daddy 

 
170
blue blob were worried about little blue when he came home with little green. Castro was 
connecting the ideas of color blending from the book to what he was seeing, but he struggled to 
make himself understood because he was learning to enunciate certain consonants (l, f, d, k, n, r). 
MC reported that it took time to repeat in her head what he said and understand it. In this 
vignette, she amplified and clarified Castro’s voice. This event is notable because she attended to 
a side comment while working with six children. MC could have ignored him; instead, she took 
the time to honor his effort at communicating and having a voice in this activity. MC had created 
a learning environment where voice was valued. This is evident in Castro’s facial expression. He 
had an idea and his language was difficult to understand, but that did not stop him from 
expressing himself. He knew his voice was valued when MC paused in her engagement with 
Alice to fully understand him. MC influenced the learning disposition of voice with intentional 
listening and listening for children’s meaning. 
 
Voice in a second language. The next vignette occurred during spin art on another day. 
MC used this frequently requested small group activity as an opportunity for conversations with 
children, as seen previously in chapter four with Steven and the spinner. During this small group 
time, MC could repeat difficult sounds like ‘s’ with children or talk about the bird sounds as 
children were working. She gave space for children to share stories that they might not share in a 
large group time. This small group engagement offered a more intimate setting for relationship 
building through conversation. In this vignette, Sarah, a quieter child who communicates in sign 
language and Spanish at home, shared a connection she makes with ‘spinning’.

In Table 6.5, Sarah is listening to the conversation among the children and MC. When 
MC said the word spinning (repeated by Castro), Sarah made a connection to another form of 
spinning, and most importantly, she expressed her idea below in line 168. The expression was 
audible, but MC did not understand its meaning. It is unclear why Sarah is expressive at this 
moment, but it is obvious that MC has created a learning environment where verbal expression is 
encouraged and honored. Understanding followed Sarah’s utterance.

MC directly asks for clarity, “It’s like a what?” responsively and kindly with a soft voice and 
gentle smile. Then, she repeats what she heard Sarah say in line 169. Sarah responds with spoken 
language and uses her hands to illustrate her meaning by showing how one holds what they 
called a widget spinner (commonly known as a fidget spinner) in one hand and spins it with the 
other. She used oral and visual expression to communicate her meaning.

In line 172, MC pauses to think after saying ‘Oh’ and then expresses her understanding of

Sarah about the widget spinner (see Table 6.7). MC not only affirmed Sarah’s utterance, she 
valued it by adding detail. MC had focused on and valued Sarah’s connection of the paint 
spinner to the widget spinner. This acknowledgement of voice and shared understanding caused 
Sarah to further expand her expression as seen in Table 6.8.

In line 174 in Table 6.8, Sarah says simply, “like” but makes the motion of spinning tops

opportunities for Sarah to verbally communicate in English is an established educational goal 
(set by MC) because her home languages are Spanish and a form of sign language which I had 
observed her using with her father. In Tables 6.5 – 6.8, MC used Sarah’s interest and curiosity as 
an effective medium of communication. Sarah made the statement in line 167, “It’s like a 
witches’ spinna.” (see Table 6.5). MC did not know what she was saying, but she did not laugh it 
off, ignore, or dismiss Sarah’s comment; she repeated to Sarah what she had heard with a 
wondering look on her face. Her body language of leaning forward, smiling, and tilting her head 

 
175
communicated a message of, I care what you are saying and want to understand you. Sarah used 
her hands to demonstrate the widget spinner and MC understood immediately. Sarah had made a 
mental connection between the spinning of the salad spinner and a spinning toy from her home 
experience. With MC’s response of delight, Sarah further connected spinners with spinning tops 
(a Mexican spinning top or trompo) she had used with her grandmother at her home. The act of 
watching Sarah’s motions and listening to her words enabled MC to understand her meaning, 
and then Sarah followed up with the widget spinner, another connection to her grandmother’s 
spinning tops. The intentional effort on the teacher’s part to understand the child demonstrates to 
the child that their ideas as expressed in their utterances are important, and the teacher’s interest 
in voice expanded the dialogue. The effect of this responsive listening is a strategy for 
influencing the development of voice. 
 
Listening Deeply to Emergent Voice. As MC’s class of children transitioned from 
outdoor learning on the playground to indoors, they routinely sat on the school patio and sang 
and talked while waiting for their turn to go inside for snack. This day they were talking about 
spiders because Sarah had just finger-painted a spider. In Tables 6.9 – 6.15, MC discussed with 
the group the content of her conversation with Sarah about spiders, their legs, eyes, abdomen, 
and the size of their heads. Castro raised his hand frequently to contribute. MC and Ms. Laura, 
the speech therapist (who worked with children in the context of the classroom) were both 
familiar with his difficult-to-understand speech patterns. When Castro wanted to add a comment, 
they first ignored him, but his tenacious attitude insisted on being heard. They then took a 
moment to listen deeply and understand his statement.

repeated three times. Because children had been calling out names of songs to sing, she tried to 
place Castro’s utterance of “angs” in the context of a song. She did not yet realize he was adding 
to the subject of spiders.

Table 6.15 was a climax moment for Castro’s expression – for his use of voice. Castro 
was emphatically working to be understood, repeating the word ‘angs’ three times. At that 
moment, his physical voice was present, but before line 33, the most important component of 
Castro’s voice, his ideas, had not been heard. As a result, Castro’s voice was not yet contributing 
to the conversation, which was clearly frustrating for him and for MC, who was being 
interrupted. Young children whose speech is not yet clear are at considerable risk of being left 
out of meaning-making and conversations, which provides them with fewer opportunities to try 
out their ideas on others and establish a meaningful position in the class. Thus, one truly 
important way that EC teachers can support young children is by helping them find and 
effectively use their voice to express their meaning, opinions, and rights. 

 
181
The satisfaction of successful communication influences the development of voice. When 
I suggested ‘fangs’ and MC understood, it was a moment of relief for everyone (see Table 6.15). 
In Tables 6.9 and 6.15 when Castro was understood, his face conveyed a look of satisfaction, or 
he smiled. In this way, he was further encouraged to make his voice heard. This teacher 
intentionally worked to understand all children. This was observed when she amplified and 
clarified Castro’s meaning, giving voice to his ideas through intentional interpretation of his 
meaning.  
 
Discussion of influencing voice in emergent language. These three vignettes (Little 
Blue, Widget Spinners, and Spiders have Fangs) demonstrate a child expressing an idea, being 
heard, and the satisfaction of a child whose speech is understood. MC mediated her 
conversations with children to support their meaning-making. In each example, she is observed 
pausing her own line of thinking and participating with the child in their expression. When 
Castro talked about Little Blue, she paused while working with five children and listened to his 
approximation of language, truly hearing his meaning and understanding his connection of the 
art event with a familiar story. The child’s voice was empowered, as seen in the look of 
confidence on Castro’s face. She demonstrated that Castro’s linguistic ability mattered here, and 
he took up space and participated instead of being silenced.  
In the second vignette, quiet Sarah, whose first language is Spanish, had an idea related to 
spinning that she expressed with the support of both a form of Sign Language and English. MC 
watched, listened, and paused to grasp her meaning. In fact, the first connection to widgets lead 
to a second connection to trompos. These small moments of mutual participation when the 
teacher paused, listened, repeated what she heard, and continued to participate until an 

 
182
understanding was reached communicated to children that their thinking, expression, and 
meaning have value.  
The last vignette, in which Castro strove to communicate that spiders have fangs, 
demonstrated a strategy of deep listening. Castro was persistent in his communication as he tried 
four times to be recognized and understood, but MC was not understanding the word “angs.” 
Finally, MC paused the group conversation and repeated his utterance to herself and the speech 
therapist. She wondered if he was suggesting a song to sing. There was 10 seconds of 
anticipatory silence. When I spontaneously interjected “fangs”, MC’s understanding of Castro’s 
meaning became clear. Castro’s voice was empowered when MC paused and gave full attention 
to understanding his meaning. Without that pause, I could not have been helpful. Pausing to 
listen deeply to gain understanding of a child’s meaning is an effective strategy for developing 
voice. 
Voice Developed in Imaginary/pretend Play 
The following vignettes demonstrate ways MC supported children’s bids for participation 
when they were pretending another identity. Children express the identities of butterflies, 
superheroes, a crab, and a daddy astronaut in this section. 
 
Imaginary play as identity shift. In the context of developing voice, a child sometimes 
stated they were something other than the person known as Irene, Casey, or Castro. When the 
teacher accepted their pretend status instead of being silenced, these bids for participation as 
another identity were honored. Access to alternative identities was easily accomplished through 
the use of capes and costumes. In a simple manner, when Irene attached the Velcro strips on the 
butterfly cape around her neck and slipped her fingers into the wings, she became the butterfly. 
When MC said, “Does butterfly want some water,” Irene replied, “oh, just a sip.” Casey and 

 
183
Alfred were asked, “Who do you want to be today?”, referring to a cape choice of Hulk, 
Superman, Spiderman, or Batman. They chose the Hulk and Batman and were transformed to 
other beings. Pretend play is an important activity for young children, and when the teacher 
enters that pretend play, she is valuing the voice of young children by honoring their pretend 
identity. 
Castro as crab was enacted over multiple days in a variety of contexts. When Castro was 
a crab, he was fully a crab in every way. His arms were curved like claws, his hands became 
pinchers, he walked sideways in a squat position, imitating not only the appearance of a crab, but 
also the movement of a crab. MC engaged with Crab and mediated Crab’s relationships with 
children. In the following vignette, Castro pretended to be a crab and MC was moving Crab out 
from under the climbing bars.

MC stands with her hands 
out, softly blocking the 
‘scurrying crab’ from 
scooting in the way of the 
‘flying boat.’  
 
 
In Table 6.16, MC highlighted Castro’s bid for participation. This child who struggled to 
make himself understood verbally was being heard through the voice of pretend. In this example, 
voice was expressed physically, without speaking. He was engaging with MC through the 
identity of Crab. MC was helping Castro express his voice by engaging with his physical actions. 
His voice was heard as he enacted Crab, and she allowed his actions as a crab to influence the 
activity of the moment, enabling him to be part of the shared negotiated meaning. Crab was 
recognized by the teacher by name, and she expanded his identity in line 18 when she said. 
“Crab’s here in the water, we’re watching the flying boat.” She entered his pretend world in this 
phrase using the pronoun “we” when she stated, “We’re watching the flying boat.” These two 
statements conveyed the understanding that MC was watching with Crab. Other days, she asked 
him to hold a plate “in his pinchers,” or directed “Crab” to move over to make room for a friend 
at circle time. This strategy of recognizing pretend worlds influences voice by making space for 

 
185
alternative identities to make decisions and appropriate power. MC allows children the space and 
initiative to speak through pretend play. 
 
More complex imaginary play. This next vignette occurred during ‘investigations’, the 
class time when children have free choice among the play and creative centers in the room 
(blocks, dramatic play, costume area, puppets, Legos, manipulatives, books, a science area, easel 
painting, a creative or construction activity at a table, or writing). MC and Ms. Andie, the 
teaching assistant, were working with small groups of children and other children were working 
independently in the dramatic play area or using blocks or Legos.  
The excerpt began when the children were concerned about the two-foot-wide pile of 30-
40 twigs on the floor in the dramatic play area. Beside MC’s foot was the handle of what 
appeared to be the remains of a handmade hand broom that had all the twigs broken off (see 
Figure 9). In line 43 (see Appendix F), when MC asked, “What happened here?”, the four 
children looking on were completely quiet waiting for MC’s response. In line 44, MC said, 
“What happened here? Was there a bird? Did a bird come in here and try to build a nest?” She 
then invited “astronaut Casey” to help and invited Castro. Next, she walked away to find a 
container to hold the twigs, returned with the container, and left the children to pick up the twigs. 
MC then gathered the children to take the twigs outside for the birds to use for a nest. Castro 
carried the container, Kyle and Irene accompanied him, and Casey also joined the group as an 
astronaut pushing a baby doll in a stroller (Figure 10).

down the ramp, so your baby doesn't bump out of the carriage? Here's your ramp over here. 
Casey, let’s go over by the tree.” Casey chose to go down the stairs to the lawn instead of the 
ramp, so she said, “Casey got it? Okay.” In Table 6.21 there was discussion of where to put the 
twigs for the birds to find. A large tree was selected by Kyle, and the twigs were dumped out.

MC engaged Casey’s complex identity of an astronaut daddy when she gave support to 
the struggle of navigating a baby in a stroller down the stairs in Table 6.20, line 48, and when she 
helped him through the picnic tables in Table 6.21. She not only verbally acknowledged his 
pretend identity, she entered it as a helper. This act of engaging children’s pretend worlds is 
evident in line 61 (see Table 6.21) as she talked with the children about the birds talking to them 
and thanking them for the nesting material. This vignette demonstrates MC engaging verbally 
and nonverbally with Casey’s pretend identity and acknowledging the pretend world of 
conversing with the birds. Through her engagements, she influenced the voice of complex 
imaginary play. 
 
Discussion of engaging with complex imaginary identities. This vignette also 
demonstrates a subtle form of voice development by acknowledging choice to have an 
alternative identity. In this way, voice can be influenced when a child expresses a make-believe 
identity. Casey was a complex identity of an astronaut with a baby: an elaborate combination of 
space explorer and caregiver. MC spoke to both these pretend identities, while mediating the pile 
of twigs. He was making a choice about who he wanted to be. This choice was not just 
acceptable; it became part of the dialogue. She addressed him as “Astronaut Casey” and inquired 
about the safety of his baby in line 47 (see Table 6.21). In this way, his pretend expression was 
heard. His expressed pretend play role was given space and was taken up by the teacher 
supporting his voice.    
 

 
191
When Voice Disagrees 
A child’s use of voice is truly honored when it expresses a difference of opinion. In the two 
vignettes that follow, Tables 6.22 – 6. 26 and 6.27 – 6.37) MC listened to children who actively 
disagreed with her. 
 
Voice in divergent opinions. The day Sarah finger painted a spider with MC (as 
referenced in Tables 6.9 - 6.15) they were both sitting on the ground with a sheet of finger paint 
paper between them and some paint. MC intentionally positioned herself on the ground to be 
able to talk with Sarah face-to-face. After making a handprint that transformed into a spider, they 
counted eight fingerprints for legs and put the thumbs together for a head. The collaborative 
nature of this event was established when Sarah made one handprint and said it looked like a 
spider. She placed another handprint beside it. Imitating her technique, MC printed with one 
hand and then printed with the other so both thumbs were pointed in the same direction. MC self-
narrated, “You put your hand one way and then the other way. Spider legs! So how many legs 
does the spider have?” Then Sarah imitated MC’s use of the fingers on each hand and counted 
the legs. The following dialogue ensued in Tables 6.22- 6.26.

MC and Sarah were engaged in a conversation about legs on the spider Sarah had finger

the spider’s big head. Sarah’s interruption indicated a relationship that is fluid and makes space 
for children’s original ideas and comments.

Sarah’s ideas for meaning and understanding about having a big head and being smart. This 
listening strategy influenced the development of voice. MC taught the children that their ideas 
were worthy of expression regardless of sentence structure or grammar. If she were to focus 
children’s comments being grammatically correct, children might reduce their conversation to 
avoid grammatical corrections. In MC’s classroom, ideas took precedence over grammar, and 
children developed voice. 
 
In lines 39-40 MC and Sarah were interrupted by a child wanting water. MC started to 
get up but sat back down again to finish her conversation with Sarah, as documented in Table 
6.25. MC initially gave the other child’s need for water priority, but she returned to the subject of 
head size with Sarah. MC remained seated on the ground, in position that signaled equity to 
Sarah while they talked. MC did not stand up, which could have been a power move. Instead, she 

 
194
remained on the ground and leaned forward toward Sarah, a move signifying importance or deep 
interest, as if to say, this is an important topic for us to discuss.

Sarah continued to state that a big head means you are smart and ended with the comment 
“small head means you dumb.” MC made space in the conversation for Sarah’s opinion. Sarah 
frequently looked down, but she did not waver in her opinion that a big head means you are 
smart. Importantly, the children had learned that their ideas were worthy of expression even 
when MC did not agree with their ideas. If MC had insisted that all children’s comments be an 
opinion she agreed with, children might not have shared as freely. In MC’s classroom, ideas took 
precedence over correctness or agreement, and children developed voice. Throughout dialogue 
and discussion, the learning disposition of voice was supported.

This vignette ended with MC having the last word. Perhaps she wanted to leave a lasting 
impression that head size does not determine a person’s intelligence. Sarah was sure that big 
heads indicate a smart person, and conversely, “small head means you dumb.” This subject was 
not resolved, but Sarah clearly was given space to disagree with the teacher. It is remarkable that 
she expressed her opinion strongly enough to say to MC that if MC had a small head, then she 
was dumb. This expression of voice was not suppressed. MC did not agree, but she respected 
Sarah’s right to her opinion four times. MC clearly influenced children’s right to express 
themselves by giving space for dialogue and respecting opinions different than her own. 

 
196
This verbal exchange demonstrated influencing the development of voice through the 
safe expression of opinions. Sarah told her teacher that if she had a small head, she was dumb. 
That type of statement would not occur without Sarah trusting that her voice would be heard, and 
her expression would be honored. The dialogue demonstrated a disagreement about the 
relationship between small or large heads and intelligence, but that disagreement is grounded in 
voice. Sarah expressed an idea, and MC expressed support of her voice. MC rephrased Sarah’s 
statement and offered a dialogue with Sarah. They had six exchanges about head size. In this 
way, Sarah was explicitly heard and valued within her linguistic ability. 
Defiance as an alternative opinion. This next vignette is divided into two tables. Each 
table focuses on a different child. In this vignette, the children were transitioning from outdoor 
play and going inside for their snack. Some children waited on the patio in the school’s interior 
courtyard with MC, while Ms. Andie helped other children wash their hands for snack indoors in 
groups of four. The observed group with MC sat against the school wall and sang songs as they 
waited for their turn to wash their hands and the last few children came in from the playground. 
Table 6.27 is the first line from this vignette, followed by an analysis. Table 6.28 continues the 
vignette and focuses on Carrie. Carrie had been watering the garden with a friend and creating 
water puddles in the sand. This sand puddle became the ‘shoeshine shop’ because their shoes 
became shiny when they were wet. In the vignette that follows Table 6.27, her shoes were 
soaked.

of MC but is at least 20-
75 feet away at any 
moment for two minutes. 
He returns toward the 
end of the next vignette 
in Table 6.35. 
 
 
As children were coming to the group gathering on the patio for singing, a few children had 
alternative needs. A few had wet shoes, and Jesus did not want to sit down. As researcher, I was 
curious about Jesus, who left the group and went into the grassy courtyard to run.  
His choice and permission to run was a non-verbal expression of voice. It was a subtle 
event that signaled Jesus’ right to have his needs met. Jesus’ need to move was honored. In line 
1, Jesus left the group and started running in the grassy area of the courtyard. He was expressing 
his right to move. By line 7, MC responded to the concerned look on my face and said, “It's 
alright, he kinda does a lap, and then he comes back.” In two minutes, he walked to the patio and 
took a seat among his classmates. Later, MC told me that he sometimes needs to move, and “We 
have an agreement that he can run a lap and then sit down with the group.” The need to move is a 
physical expression of will, choice, and right. This is a non-verbal expression of choice. At the 
time, Jesus was being evaluated for learning delays; he had limited abilities to verbally 

 
198
communicate, but he did communicate with his body. He and his teacher had a plan for him to 
express his needs, and he was empowered with choice. When he felt the need to move, he could 
act on that need and productively run a lap. After running, he walked onto the patio and gently 
sat down with the other children. He was giving voice to his choice to move and through this 
participation in communication, his voice could be heard, or more accurately, seen. His teacher 
was influencing his ability to recognize his needs and voice them physically.

This transition from outside play to handwashing and snack was procedural. Children 
were expected to clean-up where they were playing, sit and wait, and then wait in small groups 
to wash their hands. MC kept the waiting interesting by singing songs with the children, and 
small group hand washing meant they did not have to wait very long in line to wash. In Table 
6.28, when wet shoes were inserted in the routine, it made it all more complicated. MC’s voice 
initially sounded frustrated when Carrie came to the group with defiance about her wet shoes.

As MC increased her commanding teacher voice in line 5 (see Table 6.30), she stopped 
talking mid-sentence, and abruptly changed her tone of voice to conciliatory. This shift in voice 
tone acknowledged Carrie’s opinion and extended power to Carrie. In line 6 (see Table 6.31), 
MC released her position of power and said, “It's a great point, if your shoes are wet, you might 
want to take them off so that we can put them in the sun to dry them. So, Carrie, you're going to 
need to sit down.” Line 6 acknowledged Carrie’s voice with “That’s a great point,” and shifted 
the power to Carrie. Figuratively, MC was saying, you are right, you can’t sit down now, and 
here is an idea to fix the problem you have expressed. This interaction did not change the fact 
that Carrie was being asked to sit down and take off her shoes; however, her opinion about her 
shoes was honored. She was given responsibility for taking them off and putting them in the sun 
to dry.

chose to sit and take off her own shoes. It could be that being heard engages a child in dialogue

heard and then I can consider their request.”

Voice 
Carrie narrated her knowledge and power to care for her own shoes in Table 6.36. Her 
complaints about wet shoes were heard, and then MC asked Carrie to be the expert on wet shoes 
as she showed the other children where to place their shoes (see Table 6.37). This represents 
voice through assigning Carrie a leadership voice. 
In this vignette, MC not only heard Carrie’s voice when she complained about her wet 
shoes, but she also adapted her voice to mediate Carrie’s needs when she went from frustrated to 
understanding the problem and presenting a solution in line 6 (see Table 6.31). At this moment, 
she acknowledged Carrie’s opinion with “That’s a great point,” and shifted the power to Carrie. 

 
204
This discursive shift empowered Carrie with ownership of both the problem and the solution. 
Carrie took ownership and responsibility for care of her shoes, and, Carrie’s opinion about her 
shoes was honored. Carrie’s persona was not marginalized; instead, she was given the right to 
speak her opinion about her wet shoes and dirty socks. She was not placed in a deficit position 
because her shoes were wet. On the contrary, her problem was recognized, and a solution was 
named. The teacher’s narrative of speaking and listening, then letting go of a power struggle, 
gave Carrie agency. She was given time to take her shoes and socks off and then was positioned 
as the expert on shoes drying in the sun. Later, when Carrie was questioned by another student 
about her bare feet, MC helped Carrie save face, by saying, “They got wet in their shoeshine 
shop and now they are drying in the sun.” The teacher not only heard Carrie’s voice, but she also 
adapted her voice to mediate Carrie’s needs. The child’s right to be heard was respected, and she 
was not silenced.  
Discussion 
In this chapter, voice is defined as communications that belong to a child as the 
expression of opinions, rights, and desires. In this preschool classroom, when these expressions 
of voice were engaged, heard, and given space, children began to learn that their 
communications or forms of sense-making were understood. The more the children’s 
communication are understood, the more they expect to be understood. As they grow in this 
expectation, their sense of agency, and ultimately their voice, is developed. 
 
Voice and emergent language. This teacher demonstrated support of children’s 
linguistic ability empowering children to take up space and make bids for participation instead of 
being silenced. This was clear when MC fully understood Sarah as she made a connection 
between the paint spinner and the Widget Spinner, and went further to connect to her 

 
205
grandmother’s trompos, her spinning tops. When a teacher pauses in a busy moment and listens 
carefully to a child’s expression, the child learns their ideas are valued in this act of mutual 
participation. The teacher paused, listened, repeated what she heard, and continued to participate 
until an understanding was reached. MC communicated to children that their thinking, 
expression, and meaning has value. Acts of mutual participation influenced voice, especially 
when MC honored all linguistic abilities in the communication process. The literature, as 
described in the following section, focuses on identifying children’s voices, but it overlooks a 
more foundational aspect of voice development – the understanding of emergent language as 
found with children who are learning to speak, learning to speak a second language, or who are 
working to be understood due to a speech delay. 
 
Young children’s non-verbal voice in pretend play. In the early years of verbal 
development, children express their voice in pretend and alternative roles. Non-verbal physical 
expressions can be viewed as voice in pretend play when children’s pretend roles are recognized. 
Voice in young children has been researched from various angles. Children’s voice in home 
environments and with families (Noppari, Uusitalo, & Kupiainen, 2017), examined power 
relations as they become visible in the context where they occur. These Finnish researchers 
entered home environments, yet their presence created shifted the trust dynamic and created a 
dilemma for qualitative research. Schnoor (2012) examined voice in the crèche or care facility 
for young children in France, comparing voice in “the sense of participation [and] agency” (p. 
462) with “linguistic utterances” recognized as children’s voices. He found voice to “emerge and 
change in the relations, interactions and performances among and between children and adults” 
(p.469). Schnoor’s study examined utterances, not the non-verbal communication in pretend 
play. The absence of voice, or silence as examined by Spyrou, 2011, argues that children’s 

 
206
silences have meaning in “interactional, institutional and discursive contexts” (p. 7). And Moss, 
Clark and Kjørholt (2005) refer to children’s voices and perspectives as “multifaceted, changing 
and conceptualized” (p. 178) and “spoken from within an intricate web of relationships with 
others” (p. 178). However, these research studies fail to recognize non-verbal physical 
expressions as influencing the development of voice. While non-verbal expression may be 
without vocalization, it is not silent. In this dissertation, the teacher was in dialogue with 
children’s pretend or make-believe expressions, which represented a child’s choice and opinion 
of how their specific pretend character or creature should act and what sounds it should make. 
The teacher’s dialogue supported the children’s expression, such as Castro’s crab, Casey’s 
astronaut, and Irene’s butterfly. They were engaged in dialogue with their teacher based on an 
expression of choice of pretend character. Their bids for participation, even imaginary 
participation, were given space in the classroom. When children are believed for who they 
pretend to be, the voice of who they are also emerges. A teacher can support children’s 
development of voice through a discourse that recognizes all forms of expression including 
pretend play. 
 
Valuing children’s expressions. The literature cited in the previous section examines the 
dialogic development of voice in a home setting (Noppari, Uusitalo, & Kupiainen, 2017), and 
research in schools looks at voice and children’s expression (Adair, 2014; Moss, Clark, & 
Kjørholt, 2005). However, what the teacher is doing to encourage the development of voice is 
missing. The dialogic relationship between children and their teacher is an area needing further 
investigation. How the teacher engages with and develops children’s expressions could be better 
understood. This teacher paused to listen, struggled to understand meaning, and at times, set 
aside her agenda to honor a child’s expression of opinion, rights, or desires. She exercised an 

 
207
ability to carefully listen to her students. She encouraged their ‘sense-making’, their right to be 
heard and engage, and their right to be understood. Sometimes, children’s ‘sense-making’ 
involved mediations that were often about opinions regarding where to be or what to do. The 
most powerful example of mediation was MC’s encouragement of Carrie’s opinion about her 
shoes. Carrie spoke up, so MC changed her tone of voice mid-sentence to give voice to Carrie’s 
opinion. Both Carrie’s right to an opinion and her opinion were honored. She was making sense 
of the world, and it included her opinion.  
The learning disposition of voice in ECE can be a group learning disposition in which 
everyone learns to value the voice of others. The small group times, such as spin art and taking 
the twigs to the birds, were moments when children responded to each other. MC occasionally 
asked, “Did you hear what (child’s name) said?” In this way, voice was influenced as children 
listened to one another in a dialogic participation. Voice is influenced not only when the teacher 
listens deeply to a child’s meaning but is also developed as children learn to listen deeply to each 
other.  
Voice was developed in this study when the dialogic engagement between a teacher and 
young children occurs as a mediation, a conversation, or deep listening. A child’s mutual 
participation with another in their world is essential. Voice is developed in the social engagement 
of the classroom (Vygotsky, 1978). In this way, voice can be understood as socially grounded, 
performed through exchange, and subject to power struggles as well as social roles (Noppari, 
Uusitalo, & Kupiainen, 2017). This idea of learning through mutual participation and didactic 
communication is foundational in the preschool classroom.  
There is a deeper effect of voice. When a person is heard, the action of really listening 
validates their existence. Honoring the emergent voice of all children supports their cultural 

 
208
resources, heritage, linguistic ability, racial expression, and can be gender neutral. “The soul is 
kind of contained in the human voice” (Dave Isay, May 25, 2020). When all children are really 
heard, then all children will feel empowered to have voice.

Chapter 7: Discussion 
 
This study asks the question: What does a teacher of young children do or say to 
influence learning dispositions? It investigates what one early childhood teacher did to support 
young children’s development of specific learning dispositions. This chapter begins with a 
section describing how this discussion of learning dispositions is critical specifically to early 
childhood education, followed by a defense of the contribution of two previously unconsidered 
learning dispositions. The next section names teacher strategies for supporting learning 
dispositions. The chapter concludes with ideas for further research and implications for teacher 
education. 
Learning Dispositions are Critical Elements of Early Childhood Education 
Learning dispositions, as defined in chapter one, are the tendencies or habits of thinking 
that influence behaving or speaking in a manner that satisfies or moves a person toward a 
learning goal (Katz, 1988, 1993b) throughout life. These observed behaviors begin early and 
continue to develop (or not) throughout formal education. Learning dispositions such as curiosity 
and the ability to communicate needs, wants, and thoughts are said to be essential for 
Kindergarten readiness, whereas academic skills and abilities, such as knowing the letters of the 
alphabet or how to count to 20, have been considered of secondary importance ( Lewit & Baker, 
1995). These academic skills are a component of Kindergarten Readiness and because they 
dominate Readiness policy, the need to highlight learning dispositions is more acute (Hustedt, 
Buell, Hallam, & Pinder; 2018). The 2011 Arizona Kindergarten Readiness Study (Marx, 2011) 
also confirmed the importance of learning dispositions (or the term, approaches to learning). 
Skill and knowledge development are important life-long academic processes; however, learning 
dispositions are essential foundations to life-long learning. 

 
210
Two New Learning Dispositions: Risk-taking and Voice 
This current study identifies two new learning dispositions, risk-taking and voice. There 
are many sources identifying a wide variety of learning dispositions, however, risk-taking and 
voice do not appear as learning dispositions in the literature. Arizona Early Learning Standards 
include curiosity, creativity, attentiveness and persistence, and reasoning and problem-solving as 
Approaches to Learning. Other studies name persistence, emotion regulation, attentiveness, 
flexibility, and organization (Fantuzzo, Bulotsky-Sherarer, McDermott, McWayne, Frye, & 
Pearlman, 2007; Fantuzzo, et al., 2004). Independence, creativity, and engagement are three 
dispositions put forth by Bertram and Pascal (2002), while engagement, resilience, and 
imagination are dispositions in New Zealand’s national ECE curriculum, Te Whāriki: He whāriki 
mātauranga mō ngā mokopuna o Aotearoa Early childhood curriculum (Carr, 2002). Some of 
these dispositions overlap across sources, while others are unique to the source. Learning 
dispositions are critical to learning, and the addition of risk-taking and voice adds dimension to 
our understanding of learning dispositions because risk-taking predicates problem-solving when 
a child takes a risk to ponder an unknown or uncertain phenomenon.  Voice adds the dimension 
of expression of knowledge, identity, rights, and the expression of uncertainty or wondering. 
 
Risk-taking. Risk-taking is an act whose outcome, from the child’s perspective, is 
uncertain and could be perceived as dangerous or embodying some level of fear. It moves a child 
toward a learning goal because it indicates a tendency to take on uncertainty. Risk-taking 
empowers a child to move toward a learning goal. In this study, MC was observed encouraging 
risk-taking as she supported children managing uncertainty. MC used a variety of strategies or 
techniques to do this. For example, MC’s voice tone, presence, and approximation of risk 
encouraged a girl who was hanging from the bars to jump. At another point, MC used micro-

 
211
risks to motivate Aldo when he was uncertain about entering a box. These important teacher 
moves enabled children to learn to accept uncertainty. And managing uncertainty is an essential 
element of the process of learning – moving from a place of unknowing to a place of knowledge.  
While previous literature did not include risk-taking as a learning disposition for 
classroom settings, other studies have focused on the closely related learning dispositions of 
resilience and persistence. This study extends these two dispositions by adding risk-taking as a 
precursor to the valued learning dispositions of resilience and persistence. Claxton and Carr 
(2002) argued that resilience is a factor in taking on a learning challenge whose “outcome is 
uncertain” (p. 14). They wrote that resilience is “indicated when a child sticks with a difficult 
learning task; has a relatively high tolerance for frustration without getting upset; and is able to 
recover from setback or disappointment relatively quickly” (p. 14). Resilience differs from risk-
taking. In risk-taking the process and the outcome are uncertain and embody some level of fear, 
and persistence the child demonstrates determination or stamina to achieve the learning goal.  
Fantuzzo, McWayne, Perry, and Childs (2004) argued that persistence involves attending to 
relevant stimuli and persevering with difficult tasks. Persistence, or sticking with a problem, is 
important, but it does not yet show how a child initiates an uncertain process and the fear 
associated with the process. Both resilience and persistence are learning dispositions that come 
into play after a child has taken on a risk. By adding risk-taking to the corpus of learning 
dispositions, we can better see how a child gathers the courage to initiate various learning 
processes. 
 
Risk taking has been studied somewhat in early childhood education. Stephenson (2003) 
names risk-taking in its physical attributes of a child experiencing height, speed, and bordering 
on fear. Venturing into nature is the key feature of Rifkin’s (1995) study of outdoor play. Harper 

 
212
(2017) discussed nature and risk-taking with young children in an argument for Forest and 
Nature Schools. These studies discuss the value of risk-taking to human development. This study 
adds to these ideas and shows the ways a teacher influences risk-taking in school. In this study, 
the teacher went beyond the risk-taking literature of outdoor and nature play and incorporated 
risk-taking in her engagements with children and in play. Researchers argue that undertaking 
‘risky’ activities is important toward extending children’s physical prowess and independence 
(Duberry, 2001; Harper, 2017), but simply undertaking risk does not focus on specific teacher 
strategies in school settings that influence risk-taking. While work on the benefits of risk-taking 
related to outdoor play is important, what a teacher does to influence risk-taking in school is 
equally important. This study shows multiple strategies MC used to support the learning 
disposition of risk taking. In a variety of situations, she selected forms of attention, establishing 
safety or confidence, or scaffolding of risk-taking. By adding specific strategies to what we know 
about risk-taking in the classroom, we can better see how to support risk-taking in the classroom. 
 
Forms of attention. Chapter 5 Risk-taking, described the quality and type of attention 
MC provided to influence risk-taking in the context of non-verbal attention, proximity, and 
descriptive attention.  Non-verbal attention as found in facial expressions such as an accepting 
smile, an open body position with both arms relaxed at the teacher’s side, and gentle touch are 
known supportive teaching strategies.  Proximity conveys a sense of safety or security (Neill, 
1991) and is significant toward influencing risk-taking, but is not a new concept to human 
engagement.  But descriptive attention that supports risk-taking warrants inclusion in this final 
discussion because of how it supports the development of agency through risk-taking.   
Descriptive attention and risk-taking. Teachers can use descriptive attention to influence 
risk-taking and support a child’s developing sense of agency. Oswell describes children’s agency 

 
213
as the capacity to make a difference and be involved in “emergent innovative, experimental and 
substantive forms of solidarity and coexistence.” (Oswell, 2013, p 6). Previous studies examined 
teachers’ effect on the development of resilience (related to risk-taking) focused on environment, 
relationships, and practices, highlighting aspects such as building relationships, developing self-
regulation, promoting social-emotional learning, and providing positive reinforcement and 
consistency. While these studies suggest what needs to be done to develop resilience, they do not 
say how to do it. For example, Nolan, Taket, and Stagnitti (2014) used terms focused on 
persistence building to support social-emotional development, providing feedback on emotions 
and positive solutions to participation with peers. They recognized the important role a teacher 
can play in fostering the development of resilience but did not describe teaching strategies. 
Malone and Rudner (2011) noticed the negative impact of parental anxiety of risk on children’s 
autonomy. Morrongiello and Hogg (2004) noticed differentiated responses to risk-taking 
according to gender differences, implying that adult affect impacts children’s risk-taking 
behavior. Their work specifically noticed parents’ expectation that they could influence girls 
risk-taking behavior yet have no influence over boys’ behavior. While this work is important, it 
does not address what a classroom teacher can do to influence risk-taking as a learning 
disposition. This study of MC’s behavior shows how descriptive attention is an important teacher 
strategy for risk-taking. 
Descriptive attention is a term I use to describe how a teacher narrates a child’s actions 
and words. In the study, MC described Alice’s and Tasneem’s actions to them. She described to 
Irene the steps she was taking to show her journal to her classmates. Descriptive attention is 
observed as the narration of the act to the child and implies the child’s ownership of the action. 
Through verbal description, it adds to the child’s capacity and cognitive involvement in the 

 
214
action. It is not a form of praise attention (attention given to a child containing verbal 
superlatives dependent upon the judgement of the attention giver) or providing feedback on 
emotions (Nolan, Taket & Stagnitti, 2014). Instead, descriptive attention empowers the child and 
positively influences risk-taking by giving the child specific positive feedback (in descriptive 
form) about the child’s ideas or actions. Not only is their process of taking on risk described, as 
well as the risky act, their ability to try an uncertain act is also described. Because positive 
feedback encourages action, this method of describing the child’s experimental or risk-taking 
action increases the child’s capacity to be experimental or innovative. This increased ability to 
try something experimental, innovative or different aligns with Oswell’s definition of agency.  
Therefore, descriptive attention supports a child’s risk-taking, and consequently supports a 
child’s emerging sense of agency. 
Confident voice tone, safety and risk-taking. Other studies have established the value of 
teacher confidence in the act of teaching (Graven, 2004; Nolan & Molla, 2017). This study 
builds on this by showing how a teacher’s confidence, when conveyed through voice tone, can 
have a positive effect on children’s risk-taking disposition. Neil (1991) discussed the importance 
of confidence communicated in voice tone in classroom management. He finds that positive 
voice tone increases students’ level of confidence and creates a climate of security.  Gobl and 
Chasaide (2003) argued that voice quality signaled emotions and added affective overtones to a 
message. Noddings (1996) pointed to the connection between teacher affect and student affect. I 
build on her thinking to suggest that a risk-embracing teacher could influence children to be less 
risk averse. While this work on teacher confidence and teacher affect is important, it does not yet 
describe how a teacher’s confident voice conveys confidence to her students and influences risk-
taking. 

 
215
This study, focused on MC, reveals how voice tone is important for influencing risk 
taking. She kept a neutral (not anxious) tone, was never loud or abrupt (which could be 
associated with a problem) and was positive.  She also refrained from using a negative, 
concerned, or uncertain tone of voice that could undermine a child’s confidence. Her voice was 
one of the factors that enabled children to work with uncertainty through conveying confidence. 
Studies demonstrate the positive affect of teachers’ use of a confident voice. This study 
demonstrated confident voice tone as a support for risk-taking.  
Scaffolding risk-taking. Other studies have established scaffolded instruction as 
interactive dialogues that focus on both content and strategy learning. Moll and Diaz (1987) 
described scaffolding as a dialogue between the teacher and learners that provided language 
models and tools guiding a child’s inner talk about learning. The use of the metaphor of a 
scaffold implies an adjustable, temporary support that can be removed when no longer necessary. 
This study builds on scaffolded instruction by showing that risk-taking can be scaffolded as well. 
This study suggests adding the nuances of micro-risks, approximation of risk, and planned risk-
taking to literature about scaffolded learning.  
 
Micro-risks. MC demonstrated both building upon the lower level supports or leaving 
supports in place supported Aldo’s risk-taking. These supports were micro-risks, or large more 
formidable risks divided into smaller more manageable risks. Risk-taking through micro-risks 
involved a multi-step process of invitational moves. First, MC noticed a child considering taking 
a risk. Next, she intentionally adapted the risk into incremental steps according to the child’s will 
and ability. In these steps, or micro-risks, she approximated the risk, or divided the larger, ‘scary’ 
risk into smaller, manageable chunks, which became the ‘lattice’ of the scaffold for the risk-
taking event. This was observed when she guided Aldo through working with the box, which 

 
216
ultimately led to him entering the box. This scaffolding of support can be seen in Tables 5.2-5.19 
when MC scaffolded Aldo’s comfort with the box until he could finally enter the box by noticing 
moments of discomfort with a task and changing the task into a task he was willing to try. Then 
she left the supports of her voice and Aldo’s visual connection with the world outside the box in 
place in support of his risk-taking act of entering the box.   
Approximation of risk. When MC noticed her students’ goals and presented a lesser and 
attainable goal as a scaffold to meet the desired objective, the children attained their goals. As 
seen when MC modified Alice’s risk-taking goal of jumping from the climber while hanging and 
letting go, to standing on the platform and jumping. MC approximated the initial risk-taking goal 
of hanging and letting go, into standing while holding the bar and jumping down. This was a 
scaffolding of risk-taking that supported Alice to attain her goal of jumping from the climber. 
Planned risk-taking. Planned risk-taking is a type of scaffolding most aligned with 
social-cultural literature. It involves moving from a known risk in planned stages to a greater 
challenge with the help of a trusted other. As seen with Irene planning to share her journal, MC 
supported Irene as she completed various steps toward the learning goal of showing her work to 
the entire class. Demonstrative statements acted to scaffold the risk. Each act was planned and 
built (or scaffolded) upon the other. This small example demonstrates children learning to take 
risks through the scaffolded support of the trusted other. Planned risk-taking parallel’s 
Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal development when a trusted other supports a child’s ability to 
move from a point of knowledge to a new understanding.  Planned risk-taking successfully 
moves a child from an area of certainty to a place of uncertainty. By adding the scaffolding of 
risk taking to what we know about socio-cultural learning, we can better identify strategies that 
support young children. 

 
217
 
Voice. Voice is an added learning disposition in which a child’s thoughts, ideas, and 
opinions are heard, have influence, and contribute to the group discourse. When a child has 
voice, their thinking and ideas are taken up for consideration by others (peers, teachers, adults, 
parents, etc.). Voice in education literature is a topic associated with autonomy, children’s rights, 
and reconceptualizing early childhood education (Cannella, 2002; Dahlberg & Moss, 2004; 
McNaughton, 2003; Soto & Swadener, 2005). These studies argue for children’s voices to be 
heard and name strategies for documenting and hearing voice, but this study names voice as a 
learning disposition essential for learning. Similar to agency as defined by Adair (2014), “in the 
context of schooling as being able to influence and make decisions about what and how 
something is learned in order to expand capabilities”, voice is the learning disposition related to 
expression that precedes having agency. The learning disposition of voice supports a child’s 
development of agency. 
In this study, voice as a learning disposition belongs to the child and is not essentially 
dependent on response of the listener. The listener may not agree, as when MC did not agree 
with Sarah’s opinion that big heads mean you are smart and conversely, small heads mean you 
are dumb (Table 6.26, line 42). Especially in early education, when children are learning to 
speak, the discursive moves, including non-verbal actions, of a teacher’s careful listening to 
emergent language and developmental language signals to a child that their ideas and opinions 
are valued, which encourages them to develop voice. 
This study found multiple strategies for influencing voice including: dialogic 
engagement, interpretive listening, non-verbal communication in pretend play 
Dialogic engagement. Voice is developed in dialogic engagement, which is found in the 
back and forth dialogue of ‘sense-making.’ An example of this was observed when MC focused 

 
218
on understanding Castro as he worked to have his idea of ‘fangs’ understood, or when she spoke 
back and forth with Sarah to gain deeper understanding of the ‘widgets’ similarity to the paint 
spinner and her grandmothers trompas. Dialogic engagement also appeared as mediation when 
Sarah and MC talked about the relationship between the size of heads and being ‘smart’. MC 
worked to develop voice through understanding children’s thoughts, opinions, and ideas. The 
learning disposition of voice assures expression for all children through the context of dialogue. 
Voice is particularly important as our schools become increasingly inclusive of world cultures 
because voice enables agency. With the learning disposition of voice, children can be 
empowered to be expressive. Voice is related to cultural inclusivity because when children have 
voice, they express their thoughts, opinions and ideas, and expect to be heard, including when 
their perspective differs from their teacher’s. 
Interpretative listening. Other studies have established strategies for developing voice. 
Methodologies for listening to children and hearing their voice are used with young children. 
Observation (Elfer & Selleck, 1999; Owokie & Goodman, 2002) as seen in ECE as focused 
observation of children with field notes, or participant observation (Clark & Moss, 2001) a type 
of in situate dialogic observation inclusive of the child. Interviews as a methodology with young 
children is more research directed because the researcher formulates the questions often prior to 
observing the child (Brooker, 2001; Gollop, 2000; Langsted,1994). Methodologies utilizing 
structured activities such as puppets (Carr, 2000; Measelle, Ablow, Cowan, & Cowan,1998) and 
persona dolls (Hall, Hughes, & Jarrett, 2002; Vandenbroek & Van Keulen, 2002) engage the 
child through play or role-playing, but this too is typically guided by the researcher.  These 
methodologies are either disengaged from the child as in observation or are engaged with the 
child in a manner guided by the researcher’s agenda. 

 
219
Multi-sensory approaches include photos of children and ask their interpretation (Clark & 
Moss, 2005; Gadd & Cable, 2000). This method asks a child to remember the moment the photo 
was taken and remember what they were thinking and feeling. Voice recording (Cousins, 1999; 
Evans & Fuller, 1996) capture the moment but understanding of the moment without the child is 
subject to researcher interpretation. Child-guided walks or tours (Clark & Moss, 2001) brings in 
the child’s voice and opinion about what is seen but can also be skewed due to the researcher’s 
agenda. Role play as a dramatic tool (Cousins, 1999; Finch, 1998; Miller, 1997) also relies on a 
situation set-up by the researcher to investigate the children’s interpretation of the dramatic 
situation. These methodologies are of importance, but they do not include the quality of listening 
for understanding or interpretation in the moment, which is what MC employed to encourage the 
children’s development of voice.  A methodology for listening that moves beyond technique and 
focuses on listening as a relationship, which Rinaldi (2006) described as “competent listening 
[which] creates a deep opening and predisposition toward change” (p. 130). I propose adding 
interpretive listening in the moment as an additional methodology for influencing voice. 
The strategy of listening for understanding or interpretation builds upon the studies 
involving non-verbal communication cited in the previous paragraphs and adds, especially with 
emergent English Language Learners (ELL) as well as children with speech delays, strategies for 
developing voice. This study shows how pausing, careful listening, repeating what is heard, and 
continuing to participate with the child are all strategies for developing voice. By adding 
interpretative listening to what we know about voice, we can better see how a teacher can 
support ELLs and children with speech delays to develop voice. The dialogues of sense-making 
with children whose spoken language may be challenging to understand involved mediation, 
care, and attention. This attention to the details of communication with all children helps to 

 
220
assure that no child feels marginalized due to an inability to make themselves understood. The 
teacher in this study, MC, responds to the process of children’s expression or work rather than 
the results. In this way, she communicates that the children’s thinking is valued. She does not 
judge their ideas or statements. They know their ideas will not be dismissed, and their teacher 
will work with them until they are understood. Attention to children’s voice teaches children that 
their thinking, expression, and meaning has value.  
Voice and the non-verbal communication of pretend play. In this study, we also see how 
the non-verbal communication of pretend play is important for the development of voice. In 
contrast to previous studies, this study shows that non-verbal pretend play is an important 
dialogic context for the expression of voice. Previous studies argued that many non-verbal 
strategies for ‘hearing’ voice exist. The Reggio Emilia approach calls for listening to the “100 
voices of children,” meaning children have multiple modes of expression (as cited in Edwards, 
Gandini, & Foreman, 1998), but this type of voice produces permanent evidence in contrast to 
pretend play, where voice is ephemeral, existing for the moment yet effecting the child’s learning 
disposition. Tay-Lim and Lim (2013) and Dockett and Perry (2005) suggested using drawings as 
a context for listening to children’s voices. The visual images and verbal exchanges around the 
child’s art can give expression to a child’s voice. Their work is important. Additionally, this 
study adds the non-verbal communication of pretend play as an additional context for dialogical 
engagement. This study of MC shows how a teacher in dialogue with children’s pretend or 
make-believe expressions engages with the child’s non-verbal expression of voice. These 
expressions represent a child’s choice and opinion of how their specific pretend character or 
creature should act and the sounds it should make. Whether it is an expression of a crab, an 
astronaut with a baby in a stroller, or a child ‘floating’ around the playground as a butterfly, 

 
221
these expressions are emergent forms of voice. Focused on an expression of choice of what to 
pretend and how to pretend, the teacher and children were engaged in dialogue regarding that 
choice. Children’s bids for participation, even imaginary participation, were given space in this 
classroom.  When children are heard in their pretending context, the voice of who they are has 
space to emerge. In this way, voice is represented in pretend play as an expression of the child’s 
thinking, and for non-verbal or emergent speakers, non-verbal communication is an essential 
teaching strategy for supporting learning dispositions. 
Teacher Strategies for Supporting Learning Dispositions 
This study asks and answers the following question: What does a teacher of young 
children do or say to influence learning dispositions? The section below identifies multiple 
strategies MC used to influence learning dispositions: intellectual inquiry, non-verbal attention, 
the Zone of Proximal Interest, and differentiated engagement.                                                                                  
 
Intellectual inquiry. Connecting with or engaging a child’s intellect to influence 
curiosity, has been established in the following studies, but how a teacher actively engages with 
students is named in this study as an addition to the literature.  Engle and Hackman (2002) called 
teacher engagement “active interest cognition or focusing condition” (p. 634), where the teacher 
is extremely attentive and encourages student behavior with smiles, eye contact, and occasional 
interjections. CLASS (La Paro, Pianta, & Hamre, 2008) named teacher-child relationship as 
critical to engaging with students through a positive classroom climate. While this work is 
important, it does not yet address how to connect with a child’s intellect. If we are to help 
children “sense that their intellectual question is of deep interest and importance to us” (Katz, 
1998, p. 38), then we need tools for deeper engagement. As observed with Steven and the 
spinner, MC identified uncertainty, followed it with intentionally placed questions, and 

 
222
wondered aloud with him to prompt curiosity. With Alice jumping and Aldo and the box, MC 
focused on their condition of risk-taking with interest, intentional questions, and statements 
spoken with focus on the child. This study builds upon the adult cues named by active interest 
cognition Engle and Hackman (2002) and meaningful relationships of CLASS (La Paro, Pianta, 
& Hamre, 2008). Beyond adult non-verbal cues and meaningful relationships, sincere and 
intentional questions model and inspire intellectual inquiry. Intellectual inquiry in the context of 
a positive classroom climate (Engle & Hackman, 2002; La Paro, Pianta, & Hamre, 2008) 
supports the development of curiosity and other learning dispositions in young children. 
 
Non-verbal attention. Non-verbal attention is another strategy used to connect with a 
child’s intellect in support of learning dispositions.  It is found in facial expressions such as an 
accepting smile, a focused gaze, an open body position with both arms relaxed at the teacher’s 
side, and a gentle touch. Non-verbal communication precedes language learning and remains an 
important communicative tool throughout early childhood. The teacher in this study used non-
verbal communication with early language learners and second language learners by nodding her 
head yes, smiling at children as she listened, and being relaxed as children were processing their 
uncertainty. MC connected with Castro with direct gaze, touching his hand as he made 
connections about spiders.  She smiled and warmly hugged him when he formulated ideas about 
paint blending and connected those ideas with a book they had read. Her work with Steven and 
the spinner truly invited his exploration with the mechanism without him saying a word by 
gazing at his actions and smiling. In this way, she connected with the intellect of a child who 
may not yet have the ability to communicate verbally. Using non-verbal supports, she connected 
with children’s intellect and influenced the learning disposition of voice. 

 
223
 
Zone of proximal interest. Another strategy for developing learning dispositions is 
noticing children’s interests through a type of response to their interests which I call the Zone of 
Proximal Interest (ZPI). First stated on page 118, this term describes the zone of a child’s 
interest, what they are interested in, and more importantly, where the teacher could support the 
children with that interest or could expand that interest. This idea was observed in action when 
MC expressed interest in Irene’s writing, and expanded her interest in writing by marking the 
spot and then asking her to share with the class. ZPI calls upon the teacher to notice a child’s 
interest or curiosity, be the trusted other, and add to that interest. Similar to Vygotsky’s Zone of 
Proximal Development, in which a trusted other responded neither beyond the child’s interest 
nor in too simplified a manner, the teacher’s response is significant. The teacher noticed, added 
either a focal or challenging question that expanded their interest, and pushed their zone of 
interest without moving the child beyond the ZPI.  
 
Differentiated engagement. Throughout this study, MC observed and responded 
differently to different children and different circumstances. Similar to differentiated instruction, 
which offers a framework for addressing learning variance as a critical component of 
instructional planning (Tomlinson & McTighe, 2006), differentiated engagement offers 
strategies for interacting with children according to the development of their learning 
dispositions. For example, while developing curiosity about the box with Aldo, MC considered 
the aforementioned ‘zone of interest’ as she placed her questions and comments within a context 
the child could easily comprehend. Her comments about the possibility of pulling items out of 
the box were not beyond the child’s interest or too simplified. These comments were also 
essential to the goal of using the box to make a car. In this example, the comments were varied 
by this trusted other in response to the child’s interest level. Differentiated engagement offers a 

 
224
framework for engaging with children based on teacher observations of their interests or learning 
dispositions. 
This study introduces differentiated engagement in contrast to previous studies on 
differentiated learning. Differentiated learning as argued by many (Hall, 2002; Subban, 2006; 
Tomlinson & McTighe, 2006) stated that students have multiple options for “taking in 
information and making sense of ideas” and requires teachers to be “flexible in their approach to 
teaching and adjusting curriculum and presentation of material” (Hall, 2002, p 1). However, 
differentiated engagement involves the teacher and student in a reciprocating process of learning. 
A metaphor for this idea follows. Differentiated learning views the teacher as a chef in the 
kitchen adjusting the flavoring of a dish for her guests according to their taste and diet, whereas 
differentiated engagement calls for the teacher to enter the children’s kitchen, where teacher and 
child flavor and adapt the dish together. By adding the framework of differentiated engagement, 
the role of the teacher is extended to observer, co-creator, and expander. With this framework, 
we can increase our understanding of didactic engagement and better see how to develop 
learning dispositions. By adding differentiated engagement to what we know about differentiated 
instruction, we can more clearly understand how children learn when we engage in and 
customize learning engagement to meet their learning interests. 
Conclusion: Ideas for Further Research 
Small scale interventions. This study demonstrates the need for small scale interventions 
targeting learning dispositions. A study by Li-Grining, Votruba-Drzal, Maldonado-Carreño, and 
Haas (2010) identified a strong link between approaches to learning or learning dispositions and 
achievement and named the Chicago School Readiness Project, Tools of the Mind and Head 
Start REDI (Research-based, Developmentally Informed) as interventions targeting specific 

 
225
dimensions of approaches to learning. This important work identified large scale interventions to 
develop aspects of learning dispositions, but it did not name small-scale interventions. Cities and 
counties are working on increasing quality in early education, and they have created bold 
policies and creative systems, but at times, classroom teachers feel abandoned. Though the large 
scale is important, small scale interventions are easier for the classroom teacher to study and 
enact. Li-Grining et al. (2010) also implied that further developing approaches to learning could 
provide equity across both “economic disparities and gender gaps, fostering science, technology, 
engineering and math for girls, and reading for pleasure among boys” (p. 1074). The self-
regulatory aspects of improved approaches to learning may help ethnic minority children cope 
with stereotype threat and test anxiety, which undermine achievement performance (McKown & 
Weinstein, 2002; Schutz & Davis, 2000). These studies, combined with the work of Pianta, La 
Paro and Hamre (2008), stressed the importance of teacher-student relationships but fail to 
describe how teacher-student relationships influence learning dispositions. This study of MC 
shows a possible link between learning dispositions and the teacher-child relationship. Within 
each classroom, learning dispositions can be influenced within the teacher-child relationship, and 
this study shows how that trusted other (Vygotsky, 1978) influences learning dispositions. This 
study also reveals important interventions or strategies for developing learning dispositions. By 
adding to our knowledge regarding the complex space of the teacher-student relationship and the 
words and actions within that space, we can better see how learning dispositions can be 
developed with preschool children. These relationships are found in small scale, classroom 
interventions and strategies. Local, small scale interventions that support development of trusting 
teacher-student relationships that can move the field of ECE to realize the important goal of 
influencing learning dispositions. 

 
226
 
Studies of learning dispositions. Currently assessments for learning dispositions with 
young children do not exist.  A number of questionnaires for adolescents and college students 
were identified by Ridley (2007). She cites “the Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ: Biggs, 
1987b) and the Learning Process Questionnaire for secondary (high) school children (LPQ: 
Biggs, 1987a). The Approaches to Study Inventory (ASI) and Revised Approaches to Study 
inventories (RASI) were developed by Entwistle and his colleagues (Entwistle & Ramsden, 
1983; Tait & Entwistle, 1995)”. Tait, Entwistle and McCune (1998) went on to develop the 
Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST). Fantuzzo, Perry, & McDermott 
(2004) assessed the validity of the Preschool Learning Behavior Scale (PLBS; McDermott, 
Green, Francis, & Stott, 2000) for low income, urban preschool children. Their study revealed a 
three-factor congruence between the PLBS and Competence Motivation, Attention/Persistence, 
and Attitude Toward Learning. This study connects with learning dispositions tangentially, 
however, this is not a direct assessment of children’s learning dispositions or assessment of the 
teacher’s influence on the development of learning dispositions. Despite the consensus that 
learning dispositions are vital to children’s learning, effective assessment tools are not apparent. 
This study calls for an assessment tool for learning dispositions (or approaches to 
learning). Over 133 educational and developmental assessments for children under age six exist 
in the domains of language, literacy, numeracy, and social-emotional development (Dockrell, 
Laurado, Hurry, Cowan, Flouri, & Dawson, 2017). One developed by Carr and Claxton (2002) 
that assesses learning dispositions in young children is somewhat misleading and conveys a 
romanticized view of children’s learning (Katz, 2002). Carr and Claxton (2002) discussed the 
use of learning stories, student portfolios, and a learning disposition grid to inclusively track the 
development of playfulness, resilience, and reciprocity, and while these tools yield insightful 

 
227
data about learning dispositions, I agree with Katz (1993), who stated, “Educational goals should 
include dispositions that strike an optimal balance between generality and specificity” (p. 20). 
We need a tool that is of practical utility and guides teachers toward intentionally including 
opportunities for influencing learning dispositions. This assessment tool for learning dispositions 
is important, but for early educators to influence learning dispositions, they need to know more 
about them and how to notice or identify them and observe their development.  
Although there are some assessments that relate to some learning dispositions, curiosity 
most frequently, none of those are classroom based. The learning disposition of curiosity has 
been assessed in adult curiosity scales (Mussel, Spengler, Littman, & Schuler, 2012) and the 
Curiosity and Exploration Inventory for adults (Kashman, Rose, & Fincham, 2004). A 
longitudinal study correlated infant attachment to toddler resiliency and curiosity (Arend, Gove, 
& Sroufe, 1979), and two types of evaluations measuring curiosity (Banta, 1970; Henderson & 
Moore, 1979) were used with young children. A 2018 study comparing parental reporting of 
curiosity to Kindergarten Math and Reading achievement using the Early Childhood 
Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ESLS-B) stated theirs was the first study to associate curiosity 
with kindergarten achievement. Interestingly, this study had to extract measures of curiosity from 
the parent questionnaire at nine months because the ESLS-B did not contain a measure of 
curiosity (Shah, Weeks, Richards, & Kaciroti, 2018). These studies demonstrate that there is 
research exploring curiosity but not an assessment available in the classroom. 
A closer examination of learning dispositions will enable teachers to know more about 
them and enhance them in teacher-student relationships. This study does not add to the 
knowledge about assessing learning dispositions, but it does point to the need for an assessment 
tool for learning dispositions, including a more robust definition of learning dispositions and how 

 
228
to develop them. With an assessment tool for learning dispositions, we can support learning 
dispositions in all students to reduce achievement gaps related to school readiness. 
Limitations 
This study is an examination of teacher discourse through direct observation, video, 
interviews, and thematic analysis (Glesne, 2011). It seeks to understand how a teacher’s 
interactions as well as direct and indirect communications are connected to children’s learning 
dispositions. Videos were transcribed, the transcripts were coded for learning dispositions, and 
teacher discourse was analyzed against the established learning disposition definitions. The 
limitations of this study include small sample size, novice videography, and external events 
outside of my control.  
 
Small sample size. The most obvious limitation of this study is its very small scale. It is 
a study of one teacher over seven days. This small sample size is similar to another single subject 
study by Busso and Narayanan (2007) who researched the minute details of facial gestures. 
These initial studies of details of discourse, including non-verbal communication, reveal 
potential for future studies with more subjects, which will be useful to validate and expand the 
strategies presented here. My initial use of one highly rated teacher validates my hypothesis that 
a teacher can influence learning dispositions and implies learning dispositions as a domain for 
further research. 
 
Novice filming. An additional limitation was my novice filming of MC. The study would 
have been better with full day filming without battery changes, microphone problems, and a 
novice videographer. With improved filming, I could have had more footage during the 
investigations time indoors and better filming of circle time. Outside, I could have placed myself 
closer to MC and captured more teacher-student engagements up-close. 

 
229
 
External events and filming schedule. My initial plan was to conduct initial 
observations of the teacher’s interactions with her class for two days without the camera to 
establish a relationship with the teacher and children and dampen the observer effect (Ary, 
Jacobs, & Sorensen, 2010). I had also planned to film for more days. However, the days were 
diminished because a teacher strike eliminated five possible days of recording. This schedule 
pushed up against the end of the school year, limiting the amount of data I could gather by 
videotaping. 
Implications for Teacher Education 
The study of learning dispositions offers opportunities for change in teacher education.  
Institutions preparing teachers should consider including the study of learning dispositions and 
how to influence learning dispositions in teacher preparation programs. Observing and 
responding to learning dispositions can be included in learning about student observation, 
teacher-student relationships, and emergent curriculum. Programs can teach risk-taking and 
voice as necessary for development rather than dispositions to fear in young children. Because 
learning dispositions are foundational to learning, they need to be taught especially in 
preparation for teaching young children. 
 
Immerse learning dispositions in emergent curriculum. Further study in early 
childhood education is needed to add learning dispositions to curriculum. Specifically, in 
Emergent Curriculum, where a teacher observes for children’s interests, and uses these 
observations to inform curriculum, the integration of learning dispositions or how children 
approach learning would be most beneficial. In the course of child observations, the teacher 
would also observe for emergent learning dispositions. She could then infuse opportunities for 
the development of learning dispositions in the lesson plans for the curriculum. 

 
230
Emergent Curriculum is a concept parallel to the Reggio Emilia Approach, which calls 
for careful observation and expansion of interests, providing materials for children to express 
themselves through art and other expressive materials and art forms.  Notable with the Reggio 
Emilia approach is the teacher’s documentation of children’s expression with photos, portfolios, 
and narrative. Immersing learning dispositions in emergent curriculum suggests astute 
observation of children accompanied by a refining of the teacher’s actions and conversation in 
response to the children.  The teacher would then respond to children’s interests and emerging 
learning dispositions with documentation of the child’s expression and their movement toward 
their learning goal. The Reggio Emilia Approach is profoundly sensitive in its observations, 
engagements, and documentation of children’s work. Adding intentional and illustrative 
documentation of children’s thinking to emergent curriculum would document the child’s 
learning disposition (s) and the thinking that moved them toward that learning goal(s).  
 
Teacher preparation programs. My seven-year emic experience working with one 
early education teacher preparation program and this research has caused me to call for better 
preparation in engagements with children for pre-service teachers. Pre-service teachers are 
philosophically and methodologically well-prepared, but they need to be better prepared in 
observing children and engaging in those observations. They need to learn more about how a 
teacher expands the children’s ideas, wonders aloud, and gives cues to influence the 
development of learning dispositions. They need to learn how to consider what the children are 
doing and observe for children’s interests.  These observations can inform learning opportunities.  
Pre-service teachers need to learn how a teacher notices learning dispositions. 
 
Viewing risk-taking as an opportunity. Risk-taking is often misinterpreted or 
misunderstood as a danger instead of being seen as a learning opportunity. Stine (1997) 

 
231
acknowledges the importance of challenge in developing competence but describes the balance 
that needs to be maintained between providing challenge/risk and repetition/security in 
playgrounds. This can be interpreted as risk-taking with prescribed limits. Scott et al. (2001) 
suggests concerns about risk sit within an even wider framework of risk anxiety which she views 
as a pervasive feature of contemporary society. Sansetter (2016) found increasing focus on safety 
in Norwegian society and a move away from a previous permissive attitude toward children’s 
outdoor play.  In Arizona’s pre-school licensing policy, (Arizona Department of Health Services 
Office of Child Care Licensing, 2020) there are 63 pages of requirements regarding the facility, 
safety and recordkeeping of which only 3 pages are related to teacher qualifications.  This heavy 
focus on safety could be interpreted as a greater concern for eliminating risk than for learning 
and quality of teaching in the early years. 
As stated earlier, risk-taking is moving from a place of less knowledge or skill, a position 
of uncertainty, to a place of knowing. In this way, children would benefit from developing risk-
taking as a learning disposition. Creating opportunities for children to learn to manage risk is an 
opportunity early education should consider as an important element in every classroom. 
Managing uncertainty is an important motivation toward learning, so risk-taking must be added 
as a learning disposition. The idea of risk-taking and actual risk-taking can give children 
opportunities to determine the difference between risk-taking and dangerous actions.  
This study also recommends exploring the connection between risk-taking and acting 
upon curiosity. As stated in chapter 4, curiosity conveys interest, eagerness, inquisitiveness, 
questioning, investigation, and marveling. Curiosity seeks to increase knowledge and is 
frequently associated with uncertainty (Berlyner,1979; French & Woodring, 2013; Meta, 2016). 
Hence, curiosity can be associated with risk-taking or learning to move from uncertainty to a 

 
232
place of knowing. This means that a child who is curious and questioning or seeking to 
investigate a problem or uncertainty could call on the learning disposition of risk-taking to enact 
their curiosity and move toward resolving the problem or investigation. Additionally, a child 
developing voice still needs a measure of comfort with risk-taking to express their ideas and 
opinions in an uncertain environment. Risk-taking is often misinterpreted or misunderstood as 
children enacting dangerous behavior, but I propose moving risk-taking to a position of 
importance in the collective of learning dispositions. 
Conclusion: Learning Dispositions Matter in Early Childhood Education 
It is my intent for this dissertation to provide teaching strategies to influence learning 
dispositions for teachers of young children. I also present a justification for including learning 
dispositions as part of the general concept of high-quality learning. Lilian Katz (1993) said, 
“dispositions are seldom included [as Educational Goals], although they are often implied by the 
inclusion of attitudes (e.g., attitudes toward learning) as goals (p. 2). She defined “a disposition 
as a pattern of behavior exhibited frequently ... in the absence of coercion ... constituting a habit 
of mind under some conscious and voluntary control ... intentional and oriented to broad goals” 
(Katz, 1993b, p. 16). Bertram and Pascal (2002) identified three core elements of effective 
learners: “dispositions to learn, social competence and self-concept, and social and emotional 
well-being” (p. 246). The researchers argue that a primary focus “on subject knowledge, 
particularly language and mathematics competency” (p. 241) is insufficient, and they urge 
teachers to focus on wider outcomes to sustain the development of young minds. Head Start links 
learning dispositions to children’s effective learning, and classroom practices/environments that 
support them (Head Start, 2019). This research supports the inclusion of learning dispositions as 
a component of school readiness can best prepare children to be life-long learners. 

 
233
 
The importance of including learning dispositions in ECE pedagogy may most 
profoundly impact children raised in poverty. Low income can affect access to basic resources 
such as food, clothing, housing, familial stability, and medical and health support, as well as 
enriching resources such as cultural experiences, literacy events, community events, and access 
to high quality early education (Madill, Builin, Friese, Paschall, 2018). Haberman’s (2010) 
pedagogy of poverty describes “youngsters [who] achieve neither minimum levels of life skills 
nor what they are capable of learning (p. 53). These life skills that could break the cycle of 
poverty can be understood as learning dispositions such as curiosity, risk-taking, voice, 
perseverance, resilience, and creativity. Twenty years ago, the National Education Goals Panel 
2000 named approaches to learning (or learning dispositions) as "the inclinations, dispositions, 
or styles … that reflect the myriad ways that children become involved in learning and develop 
their inclinations to pursue it" (NEGP, 2000, p. 18). This panel further stated that approaches to 
learning (learning dispositions) vary between cultures, and children can be successful in school 
in many ways, provided teachers and families engage children in learning in a manner 
appropriate to each child. In this way, with the intent of developing learning dispositions, we can 
shift from the pedagogy of poverty to a pedagogy of good teaching that includes learning 
dispositions. 
 
Education begins in the early years, and I argue for an intentional inclusion of learning 
dispositions in ECE pedagogy. Learning dispositions can be “triggered, obstructed, enhanced, 
and retarded by conditions external to the person” (Riveros, Norris, Hayward, & Phillips, 2012, 
p. 37). Children can be more engaged learners when learning dispositions are activated early in 
life. Higher quality early childhood education is associated with a wide variety of better 
cognitive and socioemotional outcomes for children from diverse backgrounds, including 

 
234
differences in gender, ethnic background, and level of maternal education (Peisner-Feinberg, 
Burchinal, Clifford, Culkin, Howes, & Kagan, 2001). The positive effects of higher quality care 
have been shown to be even stronger and longer lasting for children at greater risk (ibid). It is 
clear that higher quality childcare is associated with better outcomes for all groups of children 
(Peisner-Feinberg, Burchinal, Clifford, Culkin, Howes, Kagan, 2001). If learning dispositions 
support the idea of “working smart rather than working hard” (Kirby & Lawson, 2012, p 1) then 
we can improve learning outcomes for all children with active development of learning 
dispositions in early childhood education.

Education Classroom 
 
The semi-structured interviews with the teacher conducted before the first video and at the 
conclusion of the research will gather background information and elicit views and opinions 
(Creswell, 2014).  It will occur in the familiar space of the teacher’s classroom to establish a 
conversational atmosphere. This interview will establish familiarity and provide direct and 
indirect information (Fontana & Prokos, 2007).  The questions include: 
I. Initial Interview protocol: 
o Name, educational background, teaching experience 
o Why did you choose to teach young children? 
o Describe this year’s class. 
o What are their strengths and challenges? 
o What do you think are the most important things you teach children in this classroom? 
o How do you teach these things? (pick something (XXX) mentioned in her previous response 
that is closely aligned with learning dispositions, for example, focus, curiosity, independence) 
o The AZ early learning standards name initiative and curiosity, attentiveness and persistence, 
confidence, creativity, and reasoning and problem-solving as important approaches to learning. 
o How do you foster initiative and curiosity, attentiveness and persistence, confidence, creativity, 
and reasoning and problem-solving with your students.

Study Title:  Learning Dispositions: How Teachers Position Young Children in the Early 
Education Classroom  
Principal Investigator: Diana Hill  
  
A research study is planned for your child’s preschool class at Wright Elementary School. 
This document contains important information about this study and what to expect if you consent 
to your child’s participation.  Please consider the information carefully. Feel free to ask questions 
before making your decision whether to consent to your child’s participation. This project has 
been reviewed by the Tucson Unified School District and has been approved.  
  
This study examines interactions between your child and his or her teacher.  I will video and 
audio record the teacher’s interactions with children during the school day for up to 12 days. 
Specific interactions between your child and the teacher and between the teacher and the whole 
group will be recorded or noted as they are the focus of this study. This form includes a consent 
for me to include incidental conversations with you as recorded in my field notes or in recording. 
The classroom conversations and interactions will be transcribed and analyzed to better 
understand how a teacher’s words and actions support the learning dispositions of curiosity, 
perseverance, independence, and creativity.  I will assign your child a pseudonym so that your 
child’s name will not appear in the transcript or my notes.   
  
The videos may be used for research presentations or for future research papers without 
additional consent. Because of the nature of the data, it may be possible to deduce your child’s 
identity; however, there will be no attempt to do so and the data will be reported in a way that 
will keep the identity of your child as confidential as possible.  
  
Nothing outside of regular participation in the school day is required of families or children.  
There is no cost to you. There is no risk to your child, however they may benefit from having an 
additional adult in the classroom.  They may also benefit as the teacher becomes more aware of 
how to support children’s curiosity, perseverance, independence, and creativity.  
  
If you do not consent to your child’s participation in this study, they will not be recorded. Also, I 
will not include any interactions they have with the teacher in my data, dissertation, or any 
presentations. You may withdraw your consent from this study at any time.

APPENDIX D: CODE DEFINITIONS 
 
Learning Disposition 
Definition 
Observed when: 
Curiosity 
a view of self as interested, 
with expectation that 
people, places, and things 
can be interesting, which 
demonstrates motivation to 
understand (Claxton & 
Carr, 2004; Katz, 1998). 
 
 
 
A child or children seek to 
increase their knowledge 
about a novel or uncertain 
object (French & 
Woodring, 2013; Meta, 
2016; Berlyner,1979). 
 
Risk-taking 
Engaging in act with an 
uncertain outcome that 
could be perceived as 
dangerous or embodying 
some level of fear for the 
child (Stephenson (2003). 
A child or children uses 
language and/or nonverbal 
communication expressing 
fear or concern about the 
unknown or in response to 
uncertainty 
Voice 
Voice is the child’s 
expression of an idea, 
question, or opinion. It is a 
term a child can exhibit. 
A child or children express 
or enact knowledge and/or 
skill. It includes the 
expression of the right to be 
heard, contribute, and have 
influence. When a child has 
voice, their thinking and 
ideas are taken into 
consideration by others 
including peers, teachers, 
parents, and also less 
significant people such as 
school volunteers or store 
clerks.
