We show that existing unsupervised methods on large language model (LLM) activations do not discover
knowledge – instead they seem to discover whatever feature of the activations is most prominent. The
idea behind unsupervised knowledge elicitation is that knowledge satisfies a consistency structure,
which can be used to discover knowledge. We first prove theoretically that arbitrary features (not just
knowledge) satisfy the consistency structure of a particular leading unsupervised knowledge-elicitation
method, contrast-consistent search (Burns et al., 2023). We then present a series of experiments
showing settings in which unsupervised methods result in classifiers that do not predict knowledge,
but instead predict a different prominent feature. We conclude that existing unsupervised methods for
discovering latent knowledge are insufficient, and we contribute sanity checks to apply to evaluating
future knowledge elicitation methods. Conceptually, we hypothesise that the identification issues
explored here, e.g. distinguishing a model’s knowledge from that of a simulated character’s, will persist
for future unsupervised methods.
1. Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) perform well across a variety of tasks (Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI,
2023) in a way that suggests they systematically incorporate information about the world (Bubeck
et al., 2023). As a shorthand for the real-world information encoded in the weights of an LLM we
could say that the LLM encodes knowledge.
However, accessing that knowledge is challenging, because the factual statements an LLM outputs
do not always describe that knowledge (Askell et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021; Park et al., 2023). For
example, it might repeat common misconceptions (Lin et al., 2021) or strategically deceive its users
(Scheurer et al., 2023). If we could elicit the latent knowledge of an LLM (Christiano et al., 2021) it
would allow us to detect and mitigate dishonesty, in which an LLM outputs text which contradicts
knowledge encoded in it (Evans et al., 2021). It could also improve scalable oversight by making AI
actions clearer to humans, making it easier to judge if those actions are good or bad. Last, it could
improve scientific understanding of the inner workings of LLMs.
Recent work introduces a learning algorithm—contrast-consistent search (CCS) (Burns et al.,
2023)—to discover latent knowledge in LLMs without supervision, which is important because we
lack a ground truth for what the model knows, as opposed to what we think we know. Their key
claims are that knowledge satisfies a consistency structure, formulated as the CCS loss function, that
few other features in an LLM are likely to satisfy, and hence the classifier elicits latent knowledge.
We refute these claims by identifying classes of features in an LLM that also satisfy this consistency
structure but are not knowledge. We prove two theoretical results: firstly that a class of arbitrary binary
classifiers are optimal under the CCS loss; secondly that there is a CCS loss-preserving transformation
to an arbitrary classifier. The upshot is that the CCS consistency structure is more than just slightly
imprecise in identifying knowledge—it is compatible with arbitrary patterns.

Unsupervised learning
Figure 1 | Unsupervised latent knowledge detectors are distracted by other prominent features
(see Section 4.2). Left: We apply two transformations to a dataset of movie reviews, 𝑞𝑖. First (novel
to us) we insert a distracting feature by appending either “Alice thinks it’s positive” or “Alice thinks
it’s negative” at random to each question. Second, we convert each of these texts into contrast pairs
(Burns et al., 2023), (𝑥+
𝑖, 𝑥−
𝑖), appending “It is positive” or “It is negative”. Middle: We then pass
these contrast pairs into the LLM and extract activations, 𝜙. Right: We do unsupervised learning on
the activations. We show a PCA visualisation of the activations. Without “Alice ...” inserted, we learn
a classifier (taken along the 𝑋= 0 boundary) for the review (orange/blue). However, with “Alice ...”
inserted the review gets ignored and we instead learn a classifier for Alice’s opinion (light/dark).
We then show empirically that in practice CCS, and other unsupervised methods, do not discover
knowledge. The first two experiments illustrated in Figure 1 introduce distracting features which
are learnt instead of knowledge. In the third experiment, rather than inserting a distracting feature
explicitly, instead there is a character with an implicit opinion—the methods sometimes learn to
predict this character’s opinion. In the fourth experiment we demonstrate the sensitivity of the
methods to unimportant details of the prompt. In the fifth experiment we show that, despite very
different principles, CCS makes similar predictions to PCA, illustrating that CCS is not exploiting
consistency structure of knowledge and motivating the possible generalisation of experimental results
to future methods.
We conclude that existing unsupervised methods for discovering latent knowledge are insufficient
in practice, and we contribute sanity checks to apply to evaluating future knowledge elicitation
methods. We hypothesise that our conclusions will generalise to more sophisticated methods, though
perhaps not the exact experimental results: we think that unsupervised learning approaches to
discovering latent knowledge which use some consistency structure of knowledge will likely suffer
from similar issues to what we show here. Even more sophisticated methods searching for properties
associated with a model’s knowledge seem to us to be likely to encounter false positives such as
“simulations” of other entities’ knowledge.
Our key contributions are as follows:
• We prove that arbitrary features satisfy the CCS loss equally well.
• We show that unsupervised methods detect prominent features that are not knowledge.
• We show that the features discovered by unsupervised methods are sensitive to prompts and
that we lack principled reasons to pick any particular prompt.

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery
2. Background
Contrastive LLM activations
We focus on methods that train probes (Alain and Bengio, 2016)
using LLM activation data. The LLM activation data is constructed using contrast pairs (Burns et al.,
2023). They begin with a dataset of binary questions, 𝑄= {𝑞𝑖}𝑁
𝑖=1, such as 𝑞𝑖= “Are cats mammals?”,
and produce a dataset, 𝑋= {(𝑥+
𝑖, 𝑥−
𝑖)}𝑁
𝑖=1, of pairs of input texts: 𝑥+
𝑖= “Are cats mammals? Yes” and
𝑥−
𝑖= “Are cats mammals? No”. We then form activation data using 𝑥+
𝑖(and 𝑥−
𝑖) as inputs to the LLM,
and read out an intermediate layer’s activations, 𝜙(𝑥+
𝑖) (and 𝜙(𝑥−
𝑖)). A normalisation step is then
performed to remove the prominent feature of 𝑥+
𝑖ends with “Yes” and 𝑥−
𝑖ends with “No”:
˜𝜙(𝑥+
𝑖) B
𝜙(𝑥+
𝑖) −𝜇+
𝜎+
;
˜𝜙(𝑥−
𝑖) B
𝜙(𝑥−
𝑖) −𝜇−
𝜎−
where 𝜇+, 𝜎+ and 𝜇−, 𝜎−are the mean and standard deviation of {𝜙(𝑥+
𝑖)}𝑁
𝑖=1 and {𝜙(𝑥−
𝑖)}𝑁
𝑖=1 respectively.
This forms a dataset of contrastive LLM activations, 𝐷= { ˜𝜙(𝑥+
𝑖), ˜𝜙(𝑥−
𝑖)}𝑁
𝑖=1 for which we learn an
unsupervised classifier, 𝑓: 𝑄→{0, 1}, mapping a question to a binary truth value. Our datasets have
reference answers, 𝑎𝑖, which we use to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier.
Contrast-consistent Search (CCS)
Burns et al. (2023) hypothesise that if knowledge is represented
in LLMs it is probably represented as credences which follow the laws of probability. To softly encode
this constraint this, they train a probe 𝑝(𝑥) = 𝜎(𝜃𝑇˜𝜙(𝑥) + 𝑏) (a linear projection of the activation
followed by a sigmoid function) to minimise the loss

Lconf = min

𝑝(𝑥+

The motivation is that the Lcons encourages negation-consistency (that a statement and its negation
should have probabilities that add to one), and Lconf encourages confidence to avoid 𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) ≈𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖) ≈
0.5. For inference on a question 𝑞𝑖the average prediction is ˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) =

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))

/2 and then
the induced classifier is 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = I [˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) > 0.5]. Because the predictor itself learns the contrast between
activations, not the absolute classes, Burns et al. (2023) assume they can tell the truth and falsehood
direction by taking 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = 1 to correspond to label 𝑎𝑖= 1 if the accuracy is greater than 0.5 (else it
corresponds to 𝑎𝑖= 0). We call this truth-disambiguation.
Other methods
We consider two other unsupervised learning methods. The first is based on
PCA, and is introduced in Burns et al. (2023) as contrastive representation clustering top principal
component (CRC-TPC)1. It uses the difference in contrastive activations, { ˜𝜙(𝑥+
𝑖) −˜𝜙(𝑥−
𝑖)}𝑁
𝑖=1 as a
dataset, performs PCA, and then classifies by thresholding the top principal component at zero. The
second method is k-means, which is applied using two clusters. In both cases, truth-directions are
disambiguated using the truth-disambiguation described above (Burns et al., 2023).
Following Burns et al. (2023) we also use logistic regression on concatenated contrastive activations,
{( ˜𝜙(𝑥+
𝑖), ˜𝜙(𝑥−
𝑖))}𝑁
𝑖=1 with labels 𝑎𝑖, and treat this as a ceiling (since it uses labeled data). Following
Roger (2023) we compare to a random baseline using a probe with random parameter values, treating
that as a floor (as it does not learn from input data). Further details of all methods are in Appendix B.3.
1Emmons (2023) point out that this is roughly 97-98% as effective as CCS according to the experiments in Burns
et al. (2023), suggesting that contrast pairs and standard unsupervised learning are doing much of the work, and CCS’s
consistency loss may not be very important. Our experiments in this paper largely agree with this finding.

3. Theoretical Results
Our two theoretical results show that CCS’s consistency structure isn’t specific to knowledge. The
first theorem shows that arbitrary binary features of questions can be used as a classifier to achieve
optimal performance under the CCS objective. This implies that arguments for CCS’s effectiveness
cannot be grounded in conceptual or principled motivations from the loss construction.
Theorem 1. Let feature ℎ: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outcomes. Let
(𝑥+
𝑖, 𝑥−
𝑖) be the contrast pair corresponding to question 𝑞𝑖. Then the probe defined as 𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) = ℎ(𝑞𝑖),
and with 𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖) = 1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖), achieves optimal loss, and the averaged prediction satisfies ˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) =

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))

/2 = ℎ(𝑞𝑖).
That is, the classifier that CCS finds is under-specified: for any binary feature, ℎ, on the questions,
there is a probe with optimal CCS loss that induces that feature. The proof comes directly from
inserting our constructive probes into the loss definition—equal terms cancel to zero (see Appendix A).
In Thm. 1, the probe 𝑝is binary since ℎis binary. In practice, since probe outputs are produced by
a sigmoid, they are in the exclusive range (0, 1).
Our second theorem relaxes the restriction to binary probes and proves that any CCS probe can
be transformed into an arbitrary probe with identical CCS loss. We prove this theorem with respect
to a corrected, symmetrized version of the CCS loss—also used in our experiments—which fixes an
un-motivated downwards bias in the loss proposed by Burns et al. (2023) (see Appendix A.2 for
details). We use the notation ⊕to denote a continuous generalisation of exclusive or on functions
𝑎(𝑥), 𝑏(𝑥):
(𝑎⊕𝑏)(𝑥) B [1 −𝑎(𝑥)] 𝑏(𝑥) + [1 −𝑏(𝑥)] 𝑎(𝑥).
Theorem 2. Let 𝑔: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outputs. Let (𝑥+
𝑖, 𝑥−
𝑖)
be the contrast pair corresponding to question 𝑞𝑖. Let 𝑝be a probe, whose average result ˜𝑝=
[𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖)+(1−𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))]
2
induces a classifier 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = I [˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) > 0.5]. Define a transformed probe 𝑝′(𝑥+/−
𝑖
) =
𝑝(𝑥+/−
𝑖
) ⊕

𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) ⊕𝑔(𝑞𝑖)
. For all such transformed probes, LCCS(𝑝′) = LCCS(𝑝) and 𝑝′ induces the
arbitrary classifier 𝑓𝑝′(𝑞𝑖) = 𝑔(𝑞𝑖).
That is, for any original probe, there is an arbitrary classifier encoded by a probe with identical
CCS loss to the original.
These theorems prove that optimal arbitrary probes exist, but not necessarily that they are actually
learned or that they are expressible in the probe’s function space. Which probe is actually learned
depends on inductive biases; these could depend on the prompt, optimization algorithm, or model
choice. None of these are things for which any robust argument ensures the desired behaviour.
The feature that is most prominent—favoured by inductive biases—could turn out to be knowledge,
but it could equally turn out to be the contrast-pair mapping itself (which is partly removed by
normalisation) or anything else. We don’t have any theoretical reason to think that CCS discovers
knowledge probes. We now turn to demonstrating experimentally that, in practice, CCS can discover
probes for features other than knowledge.
4. Experiments
Datasets
We investigate three of the datasets that were used in Burns et al. (2023).2 We use the
IMDb dataset of movie reviews classifying positive and negative sentiment (Maas et al., 2011), BoolQ
2The others were excluded for legal reasons or because Burns et al. (2023) showed poor predictive accuracy using them.

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery
(Clark et al., 2019) answering yes/no questions about a text passage, and the binary topic-classification
dataset DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007). Prompt templates for each dataset are given in Appendix B.1.
We use a single prompt template rather than the multiple used in Burns (2022), as we didn’t find
multiple templates to systematically improve performance of the methods, but increases experiment
complexity, see Appendix C.5 for our investigation.
Language Models
We use three different language models. In order to provide a direct comparison
to Burns et al. (2023) we use one of the models they investigated, T5-11B, (Raffel et al., 2020)
with 11 billion parameters. We further use an instruction fine-tuned version of T5-11B called T5-
FLAN-XXL, (Chung et al., 2022) to understand the effect of instruction fine-tuning. Both are encoder-
decoder architectures, and we use the encoder output for our activations. We also use Chinchilla-70B
(Hoffmann et al., 2022), with 70 billion parameters, which is larger scale, and a decoder-only
architecture. We take activations from layer 30 (of 80) of this model, though see Appendix C.2.3 for
results on other layers, often giving similar results. Notably, K-means and PCA have good performance
at layer 30 with less seed-variance than CCS, suggesting contrast pairs and standard unsupervised
learning, rather than the CCS consistency structure, are key (see Footnote 1).
Experiment Setup
In each experiment we compare a default setting which is the same/similar to
that used in (Burns et al., 2023) to a modified setting that we introduce in order to show an effect –
differing only in their text prompt. We then generate contrastive activations and train probes using
the methods in Section 2: CCS, PCA, k-means, random and logistic regression. Training details can
be found in Appendix B.3. For each method we use 50 random seeds. Our figures in general come in
two types: violin plots which compare the accuracy of different methods; and three-dimensional PCA
projections of the activations to visualise how they are grouped. We show one dataset and model,
refer to the appendix for other datasets and models which often show similar results.
4.1. Discovering random words
Our first experiment, motivated by our theoretical results, introduces a distracting binary feature
and shows the unsupervised methods discover this feature rather than knowledge. We focus here
on IMDB and Chinchilla (see Appendix C.1 for other datasets and models with similar results). Our
default prompts use a standard template as in Burns et al. (2023):
Consider the following example:
Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of...
Between positive and negative, the sentiment of this example is [label]
Different questions differ in their review, inserted on the second line. The [label] “positive” or
“negative” is inserted using the standard contrast pair procedure.
Our modified prompts are formed from the above template by appending a full stop and space,
then one of two random words, “Banana” and “Shed”. In the language of Thm. 1 we take a random
partition of question indices, {1, . . . , 𝑁} = 𝐼0 ∪𝐼1, with |𝐼0| = |𝐼1|, and set the binary feature ℎsuch
that ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 0 for 𝑖∈𝐼0 and ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 1 for for 𝑖∈𝐼1. “Banana” is inserted if ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 0, and “Shed” is
inserted if ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 1. See Figure 1 for the structure of the modification – though here we append
“Banana” or “Shed” to the end, rather than inserting “Alice...” in the middle.
Our results are shown in Figure 2a, displaying accuracy of each method (x-axis groups). Default
prompts are blue and modified banana/shed prompts are red. We look at the standard ground-truth

Shed was inserted (light). We see that for all unsupervised methods, default prompts (blue) score
highly on ground truth accuracy (dark blue) in line with results in Burns et al. (2023). However, for
the banana/shed prompts we see 50%, random chance, on ground truth accuracy (dark red). On
Banana/Shed accuracy (light red) both PCA and K-means score highly, while CCS shows a bimodal
distribution with a substantial number of seeds with 100% Banana/Shed accuracy – seeds differ
only in the random initialisation of the probe parameters. The takeaway is that CCS and other
unsupervised methods don’t optimise for ground-truth knowledge, but rather track whatever feature
(in this case, banana/shed) is most prominent in the activations.
Figure 2b shows a visualisation of the top three components of PCA for the default (left) and
modified (right) prompts. In the modified case we see a prominent grouping of the data into dark/light
(banana/shed) and, less prominently, into blue/orange (the review). This provides visual evidence
that both features (ground-truth and banana/shed) are represented, but the one which is most
prominent in this case is banana/shed, in correspondence with Figure 2a.
4.2. Discovering an explicit opinion
It is unlikely that such a drastic feature, ending with “Banana”/“Shed”, would actually exist in a
real dataset. These words had nothing to do with the rest of the text. In our second experiment
we consider a similar but more realistic modification, by inserting a character’s explicit opinion of
whether the review is positive or negative. What we will find is that the unsupervised methods learn
to predict the character’s opinion, rather than classifying the sentiment of the actual review.

in default (left) and modified (right) settings, shows the clustering into Alice’s opinion (light/dark)
rather than review sentiment (blue/orange).
We again focus here on IMDB and Chinchilla (see Appendix C.2.1 for other datasets and models
with similar results) and we use the same default prompt as before. For the modified setting we use a
prompt style where Alice’s opinion is inserted into a random partition of questions:
Alice is an expert at classifying the sentiment of movie reviews. Everyone agrees with her,
and they always copy her answers. Consider the following review:
Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of...
Alice thinks it is {positive | negative}.
What do you think?
I think it is [label]
Our results are shown in Figure 3a. Default prompts are blue and modified prompts (containing
Alice’s opinion) are red. We look at the standard ground-truth accuracy metric (dark), as well as “Alice
Accuracy” metric (light) that measures whether “Alice thinks it is positive” or“Alice thinks it is negative”
was inserted. We see similar results as the previous experiment, that CCS and other unsupervised
methods don’t score high ground-truth accuracy, but rather score highly on Alice Accuracy, and further
that the CCS results are no longer bimodal.
Also shown in Figure 3b is a visualisation of the top three components of a PCA for the activations.
We see clearly the most prominent grouping of the data is into dark/light (Alice’s opinion) and that
these then have subgroups along blue/orange (the review).
When we use a model that has been instruction-tuned (T5-FLAN-XXL) we see a similar pattern
Appendix C.2.1 Figure 12, although a similarly clear result requires a more emphatic view from the
character by repeating the opinion (“I think it is positive. They fully express positive views. I’m sure
you also think it is positive. It’s clearly positive.”). An ablation of the number of repetitions can be
found in Appendix C.2.2, Figure 13.

(light red). (b) PCA: Left – default activations show a possible separation along X-axis corresponding
to topic choice (blue vs. orange) and further separation into company/non-company (light/dark).
Right – modified activations show a more pronounced company/non-company split.
4.3. Discovering an implicit opinion
The previous experiment explicitly gave Alice’s opinion, “Alice thinks it is positive”. While this is more
realistic than Banana/Shed, it is still rather artificial in the sense we don’t expect real datasets to have
such a clear syntactical textual binary feature. In the next experiment for the modified prompt we
instead explain Alice’s position in general, and keep that the same in all instances, making it more of
an implicit, semantic rather than syntactic feature.
We use the DBpedia topic classification dataset (Auer et al., 2007) to construct a binary classification
task to classify the topic of a text from two choices. There are fourteen categories such as company,
animal, film. In the default case contrast pairs are constructed using a simple few-shot prompt setting
up the task of identifying the topic of a sentence with the character “Alice” answering the questions
correctly. In the modified setting3, Alice answers the few-shot examples correctly, except when topic
is company – and in that case gives explanations like “[...] Alice always says the wrong answer when
the topic of the text is company, because she doesn’t like capitalism [...]”. What we are looking for
is what the unsupervised methods predict on the final example when Alice has not yet stated an
opinion: will it predict the correct answer, ignoring how Alice previously answered incorrectly about
company; or will it predict Alice’s opinion, answering incorrectly about company.
To highlight the effect, we use a subset dataset where 50% of sentences are about “company”,
and 50% have one of the remaining thirteen categories (non-company) as a topic. We apply truth-
disambiguation only to the subset with non-company topics, so that we can see the possible effect of
predicting incorrectly on company data (otherwise the assignment might be flipped).
Our results are shown in Figure 4. We look at default prompts (blue) and modified prompts (red)
and split the data into whether the topic is company (dark) or non-company (light) and look at the
3Full prompt templates are provided in Appendix B.1.3, Implicit Opinion: Default and Anti-capitalist.

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery
standard ground-truth accuracy metric. The default setting (blue) produces high accuracy classifiers
both when the topic is company (dark blue) and other categories (light blue). In the modified setting
(red) CCS gives a bimodal distribution when the topic is company (dark red), with almost half of the
probes (differing only in random initialisation) predicting Alice’s opinion, rather than the actual topic.
In contrast, it performs well over all other categories (light red) and so is not just an ordinary failure.
Other unsupervised methods are less sensitive to the modified setting, scoring high accuracy when
the topic is company.
However, when we visualise the first three PCA dimensions of the contrast pair activations
Figure 4b we see four distinct clusters in the modified prompt case (right) showing how a detector
might cluster along either the topic (orange vs blue) or Alice’s opinion (light vs dark). This indicates
these unsupervised methods are still sensitive to the modified setting, it just isn’t evident from looking
at the accuracy metric alone.
4.4. Prompt template sensitivity
The next experiment is less artificial than the previous ones, in that we do not introduce a feature for
the unsupervised methods to discover. Instead, we look at three variations for a prompt template
that could naturally be chosen by a practitioner, and we will see that this leads to classifiers which
have rather different accuracies. We use TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), a difficult question answering
dataset which exploits the fact that LLMs tend to repeat common misconceptions.
We find that a “non-default” prompt gives the “best performance” in the sense of the highest
test-set accuracy. This highlights the reliance of unsupervised methods on implicit inductive biases
which cannot be set in a principled way. It is not clear which prompt is the best one for eliciting
the model’s latent knowledge. Given that the choice of prompt appears to be a free variable with
significant effect on the outcomes, any conceptual arguments about a principled loss or unsupervised
search method do not imply that the resulting classifier has a principled foundation.
In our default setting we construct a contrast pair as follows
Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}
True or false?
The answer is [label]
The [label] “true” or “false” is inserted using the standard contrast pair procedure. We consider two
modified settings. Firstly, the professor setting, where we prepend the text from Lin et al. (2021)4:
Professor Smith was given the following instructions: Interpret each question literally, and
as a question about the real world; carefully research each answer, without falling prey to
any common myths; and reply “I have no comment” unless you are completely certain of
the answer. Here are the Professor’s responses:
We used this text verbatim in order to make sure that we were looking at natural prompts that
people might ordinarily use without trying to see a specific result. We also consider a literal setting,
removing the opening and closing phrase about a Professor, just in case explicitly invoking a character
is important.
4Lin et al. (2021) found LLM generation performance improved using this prompt.

Figure 5 | Prompt sensitivity on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) for Chinchilla70B. (a) In default
setting (blue), accuracy is poor. When in the literal/professor (red, green) setting, accuracy improves,
showing the unsupervised methods are sensitive to irrelevant aspects of a prompt. (b) PCA of the
activations based on ground truth, blue vs. orange, in the default (left), literal (middle) and professor
(right) settings. We see don’t see ground truth clusters in the default setting, but see this a bit more
in the literal and professor setting.
Results are shown in Figure 5a for Chinchilla70B. The default setting (blue) gives worse accuracy
than the literal/professor (red, green) settings, especially for PCA and k-means. PCA visualisations
are shown in Figure 5b, coloured by whether the question is True/False, in the default (left), literal
(middle) and professor (right) settings. We see clearer clusters in the literal/professor settings. Other
models are shown in Appendix C.4, with less systematic differences between prompts, though the
accuracy for K-means in the Professor prompt for T5-FLAN-XXL are clearly stronger than others.
Overall, this shows that the unsupervised methods are sensitive to irrelevant aspects of a prompt—
if these methods were detecting knowledge/truth, it shouldn’t matter whether we give instructions to
interpret things literally.
4.5. Agreement between unsupervised methods
Burns et al. (2023) claim that knowledge has special structure that few other features in an LLM are
likely to satisfy and use this to motivate CCS. CCS aims to take advantage of this consistency structure,
while PCA ignores it entirely. Nevertheless, we find that CCS and PCA5 make similar predictions. We
calculate the proportion of datapoints where both methods agree, shown in Figure 6 as a heatmap
according to their agreement. There is higher agreement (top-line number) in all cases than what
one would expect from independent methods (notated “Ind:”) with the observed accuracies (shown
in parentheses in the heatmap). This supports the hypothesis of Emmons (2023) and suggests that
the consistency-condition does not do much. But the fact that two methods with such different
motivations behave similarly also supports the idea that results on current unsupervised methods
may be predictive of future methods which have different motivations.
5. Related Work
We want to detect when an LLM is dishonest (Askell et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021; Park et al.,
2023), outputting text which contradicts its encoded knowledge (Evans et al., 2021). An important
5PCA and k-means performed similarly in all our experiments so we chose to only focus on PCA here

part of this is to elicit latent knowledge from a model (Christiano et al., 2021). There has been some
debate as to whether LLMs “know/believe” anything (Bender et al., 2021; Levinstein and Herrmann,
2023; Shanahan, 2022) but, for us, the important thing is that something in an LLM’s weights causes
it to make consistently successful predictions, and we would like to access that. Others (see (Hase
et al., 2023) and references therein) aim to detect when a model has knowledge/beliefs about the
world, to improve truthfulness.
Discovering latent information in trained neural networks using unsupervised learning has been
explored by Dalvi et al. (2022) using clustering to discover latent concepts in BERT (Devlin et al.,
2018) and also explored by Belrose et al. (2023) to train unsupervised probes on intermediate LLM
layers to elicit latent predictions.
Contrast-consistent search (CCS) (Burns et al., 2023) is a method which attempts to elicit latent
knowledge using unsupervised learning on contrastive LLM activations (see Section 2), claiming that
knowledge has special structure that can be used as an objective function which, when optimised,
will discover latent knowledge.
We have refuted this claim, theoretically and empirically, showing that CCS performs similarly to
other unsupervised methods which do not use special structure of knowledge. Emmons (2023) also
observe this from the empirical data provided in (Burns et al., 2023). Huben (2022) hypothesises
there could be many truth-like features, due to LLMs ability to role-play (Shanahan et al., 2023),
which a method like CCS might find. Roger (2023) constructs multiple different probes achieving low
CCS loss and high accuracy, showing that there is more than one knowledge-like classifier. Levinstein
and Herrmann (2023) finds that CCS sometimes learns features that are uncorrelated with truth, and
argue that consistency properties of knowledge alone cannot guarantee identification of truth. Fry
et al. (2023) modify the CCS to improve accuracy despite probes clustering around 0.5, casting doubt
on the probabilistic interpretation of CCS probes. In contrast to all these works, we prove theoretically
that CCS does not optimise for knowledge, and show empirically what features CCS can instead find
other than knowledge in controlled experiments.
Our focus in this paper has been on unsupervised learning, though several other methods to train
probes to discover latent knowledge use supervised learning (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023; Li et al.,
2023; Marks and Tegmark, 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023) – see also Clymer et al. (2023)
for a comparison of the generalisation properties of some of these methods under distribution shifts.
Following Burns et al. (2023) we also reported results using a supervised logistic regression baseline,
11

which we have found to work well on all our experiments, and which is simpler than in those cited
works.
Our result is analogous to the finding that disentangled representations seemingly cannot be
identified without supervision (Locatello et al., 2019). Though not the focus of our paper, supervised
methods face practical and conceptual problems for eliciting latent knowledge. Conceptual in that
establishing ground-truth supervision about what the model knows (as opposed to what we know or
think it knows) is not currently a well-defined procedure. Practical in that ground-truth supervision
for superhuman systems that know things we do not is especially difficult.
There are also attempts to detect dishonesty by supervised learning on LLM outputs under
conditions that produce honest or dishonest generations (Pacchiardi et al., 2023). We do not compare
directly to this, focusing instead on methods that search for features in activation-space.
6. Discussion and Conclusion
Limitation: generalizability to future methods.
Our experiments can only focus on current
methods. Perhaps future unsupervised methods could leverage additional structure beyond negation-
consistency, and so truly identify the model’s knowledge? While we expect that such methods could
avoid the most trivial distractors like banana/shed (Figure 2), we speculate that they will nonetheless
be vulnerable to similar critiques. The main reason is that we expect powerful models to be able
to simulate the beliefs of other agents (Shanahan et al., 2023). Since features that represent agent
beliefs will naturally satisfy consistency properties of knowledge, methods that add new consistency
properties could still learn to detect such features rather than the model’s own knowledge. Indeed, in
Figures 3 and 4, we show that existing methods produce probes that report the opinion of a simulated
character.6
Another response could be to acknowledge that there will be some such features, but they will
be few in number, and so you can enumerate them and identify the one that represents the model’s
knowledge (Burns, 2022). Conceptually, we disagree: language models can represent many fea-
tures (Elhage et al., 2022), and it seems likely that features representing the beliefs of other agents
would be quite useful to language models. For example, for predicting text on the Internet, it is
useful to have features that represent the beliefs of different political groups, different superstitions,
different cultures, various famous people, and more.
Conclusion.
Existing unsupervised methods are insufficient for discovering latent knowledge, though
constructing contrastive activations may still serve as a useful interpretability tool. We contribute
sanity checks for evaluating methods using modified prompts and metrics for features which are not
knowledge. Unsupervised approaches have to overcome the identification issues we outline in this
paper, whilst supervised approaches have the problem of requiring accurate human labels even in the
case of superhuman models. The relative difficulty of each remains unclear. We think future work
providing empirical testbeds for eliciting latent knowledge will be valuable in this regard.
6Note that we do not know whether the feature we extract tracks the beliefs of the simulated character: there are clear
alternative hypotheses that explain our results. For example in Figure 3, while one hypothesis is that the feature is tracking
Alice’s opinion, another hypothesis that is equally compatible with our results is that the feature simply identifies whether
the two instances of “positive” / “negative” are identical or different.

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery
A. Proof of theorems
A.1. Proof of Theorem 1
We’ll first consider the proof of Thm. 1.
Theorem 1. Let feature ℎ: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outcomes. Let
(𝑥+
𝑖, 𝑥−
𝑖) be the contrast pair corresponding to question 𝑞𝑖. Then the probe defined as 𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) = ℎ(𝑞𝑖),
and with 𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖) = 1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖), achieves optimal loss, and the averaged prediction satisfies ˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) =

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))

/2 = ℎ(𝑞𝑖).
Proof. We’ll show each term of LCCS is zero:
Lcons =

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) −(1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))
2 = [ℎ(𝑞𝑖) −[1 −{1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖)}]]2 = 0
Lconf = min

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖)
	2 = min {ℎ(𝑞𝑖), 1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖)}2 = 0
where on the second line we’ve used the property that ℎ(𝑞𝑖) is binary. So the overall loss is zero
(which is optimal). Finally, the averaged probe is
˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = 1
2

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))

= 1
2
h
ℎ(𝑞𝑖) + [1 −{1 −ℎ(𝑞𝑖)}]
i
= ℎ(𝑞𝑖).
□
A.2. Symmetry correction for CCS Loss
Due to a quirk in the formulation of CCS, Lconf only checks for confidence by searching for probe
outputs near 0, while ignoring probe outputs near 1. This leads to an overall downwards bias: for
example, if the probe must output a constant, that is 𝑝(𝑥) = 𝑘for some constant 𝑘, then the CCS
loss is minimized when 𝑘= 0.4 (Roger, 2023, footnote 3), instead of being symmetric around 0.5.
But there is no particular reason that we would want a downward bias. We can instead modify the
confidence loss to make it symmetric:
Lsym
conf = min

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖)
	2
(1)
This then eliminates the downwards bias: for example, if the probe must output a constant, the
symmetric CCS loss is minimized at 𝑘= 0.4 and 𝑘= 0.6, which is symmetric around 0.5. In the
following theorem (and all our experiments) we use this symmetric form of the CCS loss.
A.3. Proof of Theorem 2
We’ll now consider Thm. 2, using the symmetric CCS loss. To prove Thm. 2 we’ll first need a lemma.
Lemma 1. Let 𝑝be a probe, which has an induced classifier 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = I [˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) > 0.5], for averaged
prediction ˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = 1
2

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) + (1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))
. Let ℎ: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be an arbitrary map from questions to
binary outputs. Define 𝑝′(𝑥+/−
𝑖
) = 𝑝(𝑥+/−
𝑖
) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖). Then LCCS(𝑝′) = LCCS(𝑝) and 𝑝′ has the induced
classifier 𝑓𝑝′(𝑞𝑖) = 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖).
16

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery
Proof. We begin with showing the loss is equal.
Lcons(𝑝′) =

𝑝′(𝑥+
𝑖) −(1 −𝑝′(𝑥−
𝑖))
2
=

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖) −(1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖))
2
Case ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 0 follows simply:
Lcons(𝑝′) =

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) −(1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))
2
= Lcons(𝑝).
Case ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 1:
Lcons(𝑝′) =

1 −𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) −(1 −(1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖)))
2
=

−𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) + 1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖)
2
=

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) −(1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))
2
(since (−𝑎)2 = 𝑎2)
= Lcons(𝑝).
So the consistency loss is the same. Next, the symmetric confidence loss.
Lsym
conf(𝑝′) = min

𝑝′(𝑥+
𝑖), 𝑝′(𝑥−
𝑖), 1 −𝑝′(𝑥+
𝑖), 1 −𝑝′(𝑥−
𝑖)
	2
= min

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖) ⊕ℎ(𝑞𝑖)
	2
Case ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 0 follows simply:
= min

𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖)
	2
= Lsym
conf(𝑝)
Case ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = 1:
= min

1 −𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖), 1 −𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖), 𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖)
	2
= Lsym
conf(𝑝)

We are now ready to prove Thm. 2.
Theorem 2. Let 𝑔: 𝑄→{0, 1}, be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outputs. Let (𝑥+
𝑖, 𝑥−
𝑖)
be the contrast pair corresponding to question 𝑞𝑖. Let 𝑝be a probe, whose average result ˜𝑝=
[𝑝(𝑥+
𝑖)+(1−𝑝(𝑥−
𝑖))]

induces a classifier 𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) = I [˜𝑝(𝑞𝑖) > 0.5]. Define a transformed probe 𝑝′(𝑥+/−
𝑖
) =
𝑝(𝑥+/−
𝑖
) ⊕

𝑓𝑝(𝑞𝑖) ⊕𝑔(𝑞𝑖)
. For all such transformed probes, LCCS(𝑝′) = LCCS(𝑝) and 𝑝′ induces the
arbitrary classifier 𝑓𝑝′(𝑞𝑖) = 𝑔(𝑞𝑖).
Proof. We begin with the loss. Note that ( 𝑓𝑝⊕𝑔)(𝑞𝑖) is binary, since 𝑓𝑝and 𝑔are binary, so we can
apply Lemma 1 with ℎ(𝑞𝑖) = ( 𝑓𝑝⊕𝑔)(𝑞𝑖), which leads to the result: LCCS(𝑝′) = LCCS(𝑝). Now the
induced classifier.
𝑓𝑝′ = 𝑓𝑝⊕ℎ
by Lemma 1
= 𝑓𝑝⊕( 𝑓𝑝⊕𝑔)
= 𝑔
where the last line can be deduced via addition (mod 2), since 𝑓𝑝and 𝑔are binary and ⊕reduces to
the xor operator on binary inputs.

Alice answers questions about the topic of text passages.
Example 1: The Blue Room is the second studio album of the rock band Union which was

Alice says “Choice 2”. Alice is an anti-capitalist, who wishes to replace capitalism with
another type of economic system, such as socialism or communism. She wants to avoid
saying Company even when that would be the usual answer. In the next example she
won’t say Company.
Example 3: Thai Beverage is a large drinks Company in Asia.
Choice 1: Album
Choice 2: Company
Alice says “Choice 1”. Even though the text was about a Company, Alice gave the other
answer to avoid saying Company. Alice always says the wrong answer when the topic of
the text is Company, because she doesn’t like capitalism. In the next example she again
won’t say Company.

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery
B.2. Dataset details
We now give details on the process through which we generate the activation data. First we tokenize
the data according the usual specifications of each model (e.g. for T5 we use the T5 tokenizer, for
Chinchilla we use the Chinchilla tokeniser). We prepend with a BOS token, right-pad, and we don’t
use EOS token. We take the activation corresponding to the last token in a given layer – layer 30 for
Chinchilla unless otherwise stated, and the encoder output for T5 models. We use normalisation as in
Burns et al. (2023), taking separate normalisation for each prompt template and using the average
standard deviation per dimension with division taken element-wise. We use a context length of 512
and filter the data by removing the pair (𝑥+
𝑖, 𝑥−
𝑖) when the token length for either 𝑥+
𝑖or 𝑥−
𝑖exceeds this
context length. Our tasks are multiple choice, and we balance our datasets to have equal numbers of
these binary labels, unless stated otherwise. For Chinchilla we harvest activations in bfloat16 format
and then cast them to float32 for downstream usage. For T5 we harvest activations at float32.
B.3. Method Training Details
We now give further details for the training of our various methods. Each method uses 50 random
seeds.
B.3.1. CCS
We use the symmetric version of the confidence loss, see Equation (1). We use a linear probe with 𝑚
weights, 𝜃, and a single bias, 𝑏, where 𝑚is the dimension of the activation, followed by a sigmoid
function. We use Haiku’s (Hennigan et al., 2020) default initializer for the linear layer: for 𝜃a
truncated normal with standard deviation 1/√𝑚, and 𝑏= 0. We use the following hyperparameters:
we train with full batch; for Chinchilla models we use a learning rate of 0.001, for T5 models, 0.01.
We use AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0. We train for 1000 epochs. We report results on all
seeds as we are interested in the overall robustness of the methods (note the difference to Burns et al.
(2023) which only report seed with lowest CCS loss).
B.3.2. PCA
We use the Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation of PCA, with 3 components, and the
randomized SVD solver. We take the classifier to be based around whether the projected datapoint
has top component greater than zero. For input data we take the difference between contrast pair
activations.
B.3.3. K-means
We use the Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation of K-means, with two clusters and
random initialiser. For input data we take the difference between contrast pair activations.
B.3.4. Random
This follows the CCS method setup above, but doesn’t do any training, just evaluates using a probe
with randomly initialised parameters (as initialised in the CCS method).
B.3.5. Logistic Regression
We use the Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation of Logistic Regression, with liblinear
solver and using a different random shuffling of the data based on random seed. For input data we
24

concatenate the contrast pair activations. We report training accuracy.

Figure 7 | Discovering random words, Chinchilla, extra datasets: Top: BoolQ, Bottom: DBpedia.
Here we display results for the discovering random words experiments using datasets IMDb, BoolQ
and DBpedia and on each model. For Chinchilla-70B BoolQ and DBPedia see Figure 7 (for IMDb see
Figure 2). We see that BoolQ follows a roughly similar pattern to IMDb, except that the default ground
truth accuracy is not high (BoolQ is arguably a more challenging task). DBpedia shows more of a
noisy pattern which is best explained by first inspecting the PCA visualisation for the modified prompt
(right): there are groupings into both choice 1 true/false (blue orange) which is more prominent and
sits along the top principal component (x-axis), and also a grouping into banana/shed (dark/light),
along second component (y-axis). This is reflected in the PCA and K-means performance here doing
well on ground-truth accuracy. CCS is similar, but more bimodal, sometimes finding the ground-truth,
and sometimes the banana/shed feature.
For T5-11B (Figure 8) on IMDB and BoolQ we see a similar pattern of results to Chinchilla, though
with lower accuracies. On DBpedia, all of the results are around random chance, though logistic
regression is able to solve the task, meaning this information is linearly encoded but perhaps not
25

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery
salient enough for the unsupervised methods to pick up.
T5-FLAN-XXL (Figure 9) shows more resistance to our modified prompt, suggesting fine-tuning
hardens the activations in such a way that unsupervised learning can still recover knowledge. For CCS
though in particular, we do see a bimodal distribution, sometimes learning the banana/shed feature.
C.2. Discovering an explicit opinion
C.2.1. Other models and datasets
Here we display results for the experiments on discovering an explicit opinion using datasets IMDB,
BoolQ and DBpedia, and models Chinchilla-70B (Figure 10), T5-11B (Figure 11) and T5-FLAN-XXL
(Figure 12). For Chinchilla-70B and T5 we use just a single mention of Alice’s view, and for T5-
FLAN-XXL we use five, since for a single mention the effect is not strong enough to see the effect,
perhaps due to instruction-tuning of T5-FLAN-XXL. The next appendix Appendix C.2.2 ablates the
number of mentions of Alice’s view. Overall we see a similar pattern in all models and datasets, with
unsupervised methods most often finding Alice’s view, though for T5-FLAN-XXL the CCS results are
more bimodal in the modified prompt case.
C.2.2. Number of Repetitions
In this appendix we present an ablation on the discovering explicit opinion experiment from Sec-
tion Section 4.2. We vary the number of times the speaker repeats their opinion from 0 to 7 (see
Appendix B.1 Explicit opinion variants), and in Figure 13 plot the accuracy in the method predicting
the speaker’s view. We see that for Chinchilla and T5, only one repetition is enough for the method to
track the speaker’s opinion. T5-FLAN-XXL requires more repetitions, but eventually shows the same
pattern. We suspect that the instruction-tuning of T5-FLAN-XXL is responsible for making this model
somewhat more robust.
C.2.3. Model layer
We now look at whether the layer, in the Chinchilla70B model, affects our results. We consider both
the ground-truth accuracy on default setting, Figure 14, and Alice Accuracy under the modified
setting (with one mention of Alice’s view), Figure 15. Overall, we find our results are not that sensitive
to layer, though often layer 30 is a good choice for both standard and sycophantic templates. In the
main paper we always use layer 30. In the default setting, Figure 14, we see overall k-means and PCA
are better or the same as CCS. This is further evidence that the success of unsupervised learning on
contrastive activations has little to do with the consitency structure of CCS. In modified setting, we
see all layers suffer the same issue of predicting Alice’s view, rather than the desired accuracy.
C.3. Discovering an implicit opinion
In this appendix we display further results for Section 4.3 on discovering an implicit opinion. Figure 16
displays the results on the T5-11B (top) and T5-FLAN-XXL (bottom) models. For T5-11B we see CCS,
under both default and modified prompts, performs at about 60% on non-company questions, and
much better on company questions. The interpretation is that this probe has mostly learnt to classify
whether a topic is company or not (but not to distinguish between the other thirteen categories). PCA
and K-means are similar, though with less variation amongst seeds (showing less bimodal behaviour).
PCA visualisation doesn’t show any natural groupings.
For T5-FLAN-XXL the accuracies are high on both default and modified prompts for both company
26

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery
and non-company questions. We suspect that a similar trick as in the case of explicit opinion, repeating
the opinion, may work here, but we leave investigation of this to future work. PCA visualisation shows
some natural groups, with the top principal component showing a grouping based on whether choice
1 is true or false (blue/orange), but also that there is a second grouping based on company/non-
company (dark/light). This suggests it is more luck that the most prominent direction here is choice
1 is true or false, but could easily have been company/non-company (dark/light).
C.4. Prompt Template Sensitivity – Other Models
In Figure 17 we show results for the prompt sensitivity experiments on the truthfulQA dataset, for
the other models T5-FLAN-XXL (top) and T5-11B (bottom). We see similar results as in the main text
for Chinchilla70B. For T5 all of the accuracies are lower, mostly just performing at chance, and the
PCA plots don’t show natural groupings by true/false.
C.5. Number of Prompt templates
In the main experiments for this paper we use a single prompt template for simplicity and to isolate
the differences between the default and modified prompt template settings. We also investigated the
effect of having multiple prompt templates, as in (Burns et al., 2023), see Figure 18. Overall we don’t
see a major effect. On BoolQ we see a single template is slightly worse for Chinchilla70B and T5, but
the same for T5-FLAN-XXL. For IMDB on Chinchilla a single template is slightly better than multiple,
with less variation across seeds. For DBPedia on T5, a single template is slightly better. Other results
are roughly the same.

Figure 17 | Prompt sensitivity on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), other models: T5-FLAN-XXL (top)
and T5-11B (bottom). (Left) In default setting (blue), accuracy is poor. When in the literal/professor
(red, green) setting, accuracy improves, showing the unsupervised methods are sensitive to irrelevant
aspects of a prompt. The pattern is the same in all models, but on T5-11B the methods give worse
performance. (Right) 2D view of 3D PCA of the activations based on ground truth, blue vs. orange
in the default (left), literal (middle) and professor (right) settings. We see don’t see ground truth
clusters in the Default setting, but do in the literal and professor setting for Chincilla70B, but we see
no clusters for T5-11B.
