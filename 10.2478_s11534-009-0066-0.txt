Abstract:
On the basis of statistical mechanics of the Q-Ising model, we formulate the Bayesian inference to the
problem of inverse halftoning, which is the inverse process of representing gray-scales in images by means
of black and white dots. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate statistical properties of the inverse
process, especially, we reveal the condition of the Bayes-optimal solution for which the mean-square error
takes its minimum. The numerical result is qualitatively conﬁrmed by analysis of the inﬁnite-range model.
As demonstrations of our approach, we apply the method to retrieve a grayscale image, such as standard
image Lena, from the halftoned version. We ﬁnd that the Bayes-optimal solution gives a ﬁne restored
grayscale image which is very close to the original. In addition, based on statistical mechanics of the Q-
Ising model, we are sucessful in constructing a practically useful method of inverse halftoning using the
Bethe approximation.

Introduction
For many years, a lot of researchers have investigated var-
ious problems in information sciences, such as image anal-
ysis based on the Markov random ﬁelds [1–3]. In recent
two or three decades, a considerable number of theoret-

ical physicists [4–6] have studied various problems, such
as image restoration and error-correcting codes, based on
the analogy between statistical mechanics and informa-
tion processing. For instance, the mean-ﬁeld theory es-
tablished in statistical mechanics have been applied to
image restoration [7, 8] to approximate the optimal so-
lution.
Then, Pryce and Bruce [9] have proposed the
threshold posterior marginal (TPM) estimate for image
restoration based on statistical mechanics of the Q-Ising

model.
In recent years, Nishimori and Wong [10] have
constructed an uniﬁed framework based on statistical me-
chanics of the Ising spin glass model for the problems of
image restoration and error-correcting codes. They evalu-
ated the statistical performance via the Monte Carlo sim-
ulation and the replica theory established in the theory
of spin glasses. Since their study, statistical mechanical
techniques have been applied to various problems in im-
age processing, such as the segmentation [11]. From these
facts, we ﬁnd that the research ﬁeld, the so-called Sta-
tistical Mechanics of Information is now an established
important subject in statistical mechanics.
In the ﬁeld of the print technologies, many techniques
of information processing have also developed. Particu-
larly, the digital halftoning [12–16] is regarded as a key
information processing to convert a digital grayscale im-
age to black and white dots which represents the original
grayscale levels appropriately. On the other hand, the in-
verse process of the digital halftoning is referred to as in-
verse halftoning. The inverse halftoning is also important
for us to make scanner machines to retrieve the original
grayscale image by making use of much less informative
materials, such as the halftoned binary dots. The inverse
halftoning is ‘ill-posed’ in the sense that one lacks infor-
mation to retrieve the original image because the material
one can utilize is just only the halftoned black and white
binary dots instead of the grayscale one.
To overcome
this diﬃculty, the Bayesian approach becomes a powerful
tool which is clariﬁed to have close relation to statistical
mechanics. Under the direction of this approach, Steven-
son [17] attempted to apply the maximum of a Posteri-
ori (MAP for short) estimation to the problem of inverse
halftoning for a given halftone binary dots obtained by
the threshold mask and the so-called error diﬀusion meth-
ods. However, from the theoretical point of view, there are
few theoretical papers to deal with the inverse-halftoning
based on the Bayesian inference and statistical mechanics
of information. Besides the Bayesian approach, we usu-
ally introduce the ‘regularization term’ which compensates
the lack of the information and regard the inverse problem
as a combinatorial optimization [18, 19]. For this problem,
the optimization is then achieved to ﬁnd the lowest energy
state via, for example, simulated annealing [20, 21].
In this study, based on the framework of statistical me-
chanics of the Q-Ising model [22] which is regarded as
the Bayesian inference, we formulate the problem of in-
verse halftoning to estimate the original grayscale levels
by using the information both on the halftoned binary dots
and the threshold mask. Here, we reconstruct the origi-
nal grayscale revels from a given halftoned binary image
and the threshold mask so as to maximize the posterior
marginal probability. Then, using the Monte Carlo simu-
lation for a set of the snapshots generated with the Gibbs
distribution of the Q-Ising model, we investigate statis-
tical properties of the inverse process, especially, we re-
veal the condition of the Bayes-optimal solution for which
the mean-square error takes its minimum. We clarify that
the optimal performance is achieved around the Bayes-
optimal condition that the model prior is assumed to be
completely same as the true prior. Then, from the statis-
tical mechanical point of view, we show that the present
method is carried out by constructing the equilibrium state
of the Q-Ising model under the constraints coming from
the halftone process, and further that the optimal per-
formance is realized, if we appropriately set the hyper-
paramter corresponding to the absolute temperature. In
addition, we show that the performance under the Bayes-
optimal condition is superior to that of the MAP esti-
mate, if the thresholds are not set appropriately in the
halftone process. Then, in order to investigate to what
extent the Bayesian approach is eﬀective for realistic im-
ages, we apply the method to retrieve the grayscale lev-
els of the 256-levels standard image Lena from the binary
dots. We ﬁnd that the Bayes-optimal solution gives a ﬁne
restored grayscale image which is very close to the origi-
nal one. Next, from the theoretical point of view, we clarify
without the statistical uncertainty that the analytical es-
timate of the inﬁnite-range model supports the result of
the Monte Carlo simulation for the set of the snapshots
of the Q-Ising model, although the inﬁnite-range interac-
tions are introduced into the present model to realize the
analyitical estimate. Moreover, we here construct a practi-
cally useful technique based on the Bayes inference using
the Bethe approximation for inverse halftoning. Here the
Bethe approximation is established in statistical mechan-
ics to clarify thermodynamic properties of magnetic spin
systems approximately. Then, the Bayes inference using
the Bethe approximation is clariﬁed to be regarded as the
Belief propagation method in the ﬁeld of information sci-
ences. In this study, we indicate that the present method
is eﬀectively works for the set of the snapshots of the Q-
Ising model by solving the self-consistent equations of the
Bethe approximation.
The contents of this paper are organized as follows. In the
next section, we formulate the problem of inverse halfton-
ing based on statistical mechanics of the Q-Ising model.
Here we mention the relationship between statistical me-
chanics of the Q-Ising model and Bayesian inference of
the inverse halftoning. In the following section, we inves-
tigate statistical properties of the statistical mechanical
inverse halftoning by Monte Carlo simulations. We also
show that the Bayes-optimal inverse halftoning is useful
even for realistic images, such as the 256-level standard
image Lena. Then, analysis of the inﬁnite-range model

The model
In this section, based on statistical mechanics of the Q-
Ising model on the square lattice, we construct a Bayesian
inference for the problem of inverse halftoning.
First, we consider an original grayscale image which is
expressed as a snapshot from a Gibbs distribution of the
ferromagnetic Q-Ising model having the spin variables
{ξ} ≡{ξx,y = 0, · · · , Q −1|x, y = 0, · · · , L −1}. Then,
each image {ξ} follows the Gibbs distribution

of the Gibbs distribution, namely,

Then, the summation P
n.n.(· · · ) runs over the sets of the
nearest neighboring pixels located on the square lattice
in two dimension. The ratio of strength of spin-pair inter-
action Js and temperature Ts, namely, Js/Ts controls the
smoothness of our original image {ξ}. In Fig. 1 (left), we
show a typical example of the snapshots from the distribu-
tion (1) for the case of Q = 4, Js = 1 and Ts = 1. The right
panel of the Fig. 1 shows the 256-levels grayscale stan-
dard image Lena with 400 × 400 pixels. We shall use the
standard image to check the eﬃciency of our approach. In
order to convert the original grayscale images to the the
black and white binary dots, we make use of the threshold
array {M}. Each component Mk,l of the array {M} takes

arranged on the Lm × Lm squares as shown in Fig. 2 for
Lm = 2 (left) and for Lm = 4 (right). For general case of

We should keep in mind that the deﬁnition (3) is reduced
to {M} = {Mk,l = 0, 1, · · · , Q−1|k, l = 0, 1, · · · ,

and the domain of each component of the threshold array
becomes the same as that of the original image {ξ} for
L2
m = Q. In the dither method, we ﬁrst make a pixel-to-
pixel map between each element of the threshold array
Mk,l and the original grayscale ξx,y at the (x, y)-th pixel
considering the relations x = pLm + k and y = qLm + l.
Here p and q are the integers from 0 to L/Lm−1. As shown
in Fig. 3, we can see that this map is achieved by arrang-
ing (L/Lm)2 threshold arrays on the original grayscale im-
age {ξ}. Next, we convert each original pixel ξx,y into the
binary dot τx,y by
τx,y = θ

.

Here Mx,y which denotes the threshold corresponding to
the (x, y)-th pixel of the original image {ξ}. Then, θ(· · · )
denotes the unit-step function. Halftone images generated
by the dither method via (4) are shown in Fig. 4. We ﬁnd
that the left panel obtained by the uniform threshold mask
Mx,y = 1.5 (∀x,y) is hard to be recognized as an original
grayscale image, whereas, the center panel obtained by
the 2×2 Bayer-type threshold array might be recognized
as just like an original image through our human vision
systems (due to a kind of optical illusion). Obviously, the
inverse process of the above halftoning is regarded as an
ill-posed problem. This is because from (4), one can not

determine the original image ξx,y (∀x,y) completely from a
given set of τx,y (∀x,y) and Mx,y (∀x,y).
In this manuscript, in the procedure of the Bayesian in-
verse digital halftoning, we attempt to restore the orig-
inal grayscale image from a given halftone image by
means of the so-called maximizer of posterior marginal
(MPM for short) estimate.
In this method, we deﬁne
{z} = {zx,y = 0, · · · , Q −1|x, y = 0, · · · , L −1} as an
estimate of the original image {ξ} which is arranged on
the square lattice and reconstruct the grayscale image on
the basis of maximizing the following posterior marginal
probability:

where the summation P
zx,y̸={z}(· · · ) runs over all pixels
except for the (x, y)-th pixel and the posterior probability
P({z}|{τ}) is estimated by the Bayes formula:
Pr ({z}|{τ}) =
Pr ({z}) Pr ({τ}|{z})
P

In this study, following Stevenson [17], we assume that
the likelihood might have the same form as the halftone

construct the Bayes-optimal solution if we assume that the
model prior has the same form as the true prior, namely,
J = Js and Tm = Ts (what we call, Nishimori line in the
research ﬁeld of spin glasses [4]).
From the viewpoint of statistical mechanics, the posterior

Obviously, the number of possible spin conﬁgurations
that satisfy the above constraints (10) is evaluated as
Q
(x,y) |Qτx,y −Mx,y| and this quantity is exponential or-
der such as ∼αL2 (α: a positive constant). Therefore, the
solution {z} to satisfy the constraints (10) is not unique
and this fact makes the problem very hard.
To reduce
the diﬃculties, we consider the equilibrium state gener-
ated by a Gibbs distribution of the ferromagnetic Q-Ising
model with the constraints (10) and increase the parame-
ter J gradually from J = 0. Then, we naturally expect that
the system stabilizes the ferromagnetic Q-Ising conﬁgu-
rations due to a kind of the regularization term (9). Thus,
we might choose the best possible solution among a lot of
candidates satisfying (10).
From the view point of statistical mechanics, the MPM

Average case performance measure
To investigate the performance of the inverse halftoning,
we evaluate the mean square error which represents the
pixel-wise similarity between the original and restored
images.
Especially, we evaluate the average case per-
formance of the inverse halftoning through the following
averaged mean square error

Results
In this section, we ﬁrst investigate the statistical proper-
ties of our approach to the inverse halftoning for a set of
snapshots from a Gibbs distribution of the ferromagnetic
Q-Ising model via computer simulations. Then, we check
the usefulness of our approach for the realistic images,
namely, the 256-levels standard image Lena. We next an-
alytically evaluate the performance for the inﬁnite-range
model. Moreover, in order to construct a practically useful
method, we propose a Bayesian inference using the Bethe
approximation.
3.1.
Monte Carlo simulation
We ﬁrst carry out Monte Carlo simulations for a set of
halftone images, which are obtained from the snapshots of
the Q = 4 Ising model with 100×100 pixels by the dither
method using the uniform thresholds Mx,y = 3/2 (∀x,y),
Mx,y = 1/2 (∀x,y) and the 2×2 Bayer-type threshold array
as shown in Fig. 2. In order to clarify the statistical per-
formance of our method, we reveal the hyper-parameters
J and Tm dependence of the averaged mean square error
σ. For this purpose, we use 10 snapshots of the ferro-
magnetic Q = 4 Ising model {ξx,y} with 100 × 100 pixels
on the square lattice. These images are generated by the
Monte Carlo simulation based on the Metropolis algo-
rithm with 20000 Monte Carlo steps (MCS, for short) from
a random pattern at Ts = 1. Then, when we restore the
grayscale image, we carry out the Monte Carlo simulation
based on the Metropolis algorithm with 20000 MCS at
assumed temperature Tm, starting from the halftone image

the uniform threshold M = 3/2 and 2×2 Bayer-type arrays.

{τ}. Here the halftone image {τ} is obviously satisﬁed
with the constraint δ(θ(ξx,y −Mx,y), θ(zx,y −Mx,y)) = 1 at
each pixel. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), we ﬁrst investigate the
hyperparameter Tm dependence of the mean square error
when the threshold are set to M = 3/2 under the condi-
tions, Q = 4, Ts = 1, Js = 1, J = 1. This ﬁgure shows
that the present method achieves the best possible perfor-
mance under the Bayes-optimal condition, that is, J = Js
and Tm = Ts, and that the limit Tm →∞leading up to
the MAP estimate gives almost the same performance as
the Bayes-optimal MPM estimate. This fact means that it
is not necessary for us to take the Tm →0 limit when we
carry out the inverse halftoning via simulated annealing.
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5 (b), we show the
Tm dependence of the mean square error for the case that
the threshold is set to Mx,y = 1/2 at each pixel. Here we
set other parameters as Q = 4, Ts = 1, Js = 1 and J = 1.
In this case, as is same as the Mx,y = 3/2, we also con-
ﬁrm that the optimal performance is achieved under the
Bayes-optimal condition. However, this ﬁgure indicates
that the performance under the Bayes-optimal condition
is superior to that of the Tm →0 limit of the present
method.
From the statistical mechanical point of view,
this result suggests that the thermal ﬂuctuations enable
us to improve the performance of the present method by
tuning the absolute temperature Tm to the Bayes-optimal
condition. These results indicate that the performance of
the present method under the Bayes-optimal condition is
at least superior to the MAP estimate.
From the restored images in the left and center panels of
Fig. 6, it is actually conﬁrmed that the present method
eﬀectively works for the snapshot of the ferromagnetic Q-
Ising model. It should be noted that the mean square error
evaluated for the 2 × 2 Bayer-type array is larger than
that for the M = 2 uniform threshold.
Figure 6. The left panel shows a Q = 4 grayscale image restored by the MPM estimate from the halftone image shown in Fig. 4 (left). The center
panel shows a Q = 4 grayscale image restored by the MPM estimate from the halftone image shown in Fig. 4 (center). The right panel
shows a Q = 256 grayscale image restored by the MPM estimate from the halftone image shown in Fig. 4 (right).

Bayes-optimal solution to inverse halftoning based on statistical mechanics of the Q-Ising model
This result seems to be somewhat counter-intuitive be-
cause the halftone image shown in the center panel of
Fig. 4 seems to be much closer to the original image, in
other words, is much informative to retrieve the original
image than the halftone image shown in the left panel of
the same ﬁgure. However, it could be understood as fol-
lows. The shape of each ‘cluster’ appearing in the original
image (see the left panel of Fig. 1) remains in the halftone
version (the left panel of Fig. 4), whereas, in the halftone
image (the center panel of Fig. 4), such structure is de-
stroyed by the halftoning process via the 2×2 Bayer-type
array. As we found, in a snapshot of the ferromagnetic
Q-Ising model at the inverse temperature Js/Ts = 1, the
large size clusters are much more dominant components
than the small isolated pixels. Therefore, the averaged
mean square error is sensitive to the change of the clus-
ter size or the shape, and if we use the constant threshold
mask to create the halftone image, the shape of the cluster
does not change, whereas the high-frequency components
vanish. These properties are desirable for us to suppress
the increase of the averaged mean square error. This fact
implies us that the averaged mean square error for the
2×2 Bayer-type is larger than that for the constant mask
array and the performance is much worse than expected.
Moreover, the above evaluations might be helpful for us to
deal with the inverse halftoning from the halftoned image
of the standard image with conﬁdence. In fact, we are also
conﬁrmed that our method is practically useful from the
resulting image shown in Fig. 6 (right) having the mean
square error σ = 0.002005.
3.2.
Analysis of the inﬁnite-range model
In this subsection, we check the validity of our Monte
Carlo simulations, namely, we analytically evaluate the
statistical performance of the present method for a given
set of the snapshots from a Gibbs distribution of the fer-
romagnetic Q-Ising model in which each spin variable is
located on the vertices of the complete graph. For sim-
plicity, we ﬁrst transform the index from (x, y) to i so as
to satisfy i = x + Ly + 1. Then, the new index i runs from
i = 1 to L2 −1 = N. For this new index of each spin vari-
able, we consider the inﬁnite-range version of true prior
and the model as
Pr ({ξ}) = e−βs

i<j(ξi−ξj)2
Zs

Pr ({z}) = e−βm

Zm

(14)
where the scaling factors 1/N appearing in front of the
sums P
i<j(· · · ) are needed to take a proper thermody-
namic limit. We also set βs ≡Js/Ts and βm ≡J/Tm for
simplicity. Obviously, Zs and Zm in (13) are the normal-
ization factors of the inﬁnite-range versions of model and
true priors.
In order to investigate the statistical performance of
present method, we here estimate the thermodynamic
properties of the system {z} in terms of the free energy
as

Here [⟨· · · ⟩]ξ means thermal average of some physical
quantities (· · · ) averaged over the inﬁnite-range version
of the true prior P({ξ}) as quenched disorders. The ther-
modynamic properties of the system {z} are clariﬁed from
the saddle-point conditions of the free energy both on the
magnetization m0 of the original image {ξ} and the mag-

Solving these self-consistent equations with respect to m0 in Eq. (17) and m in Eq. (18), we evaluate the statistical
performance of the present method through the quantity σ (19) analytically.
As we have mentioned using the Monte Carlo simulation, we estimate how the mean square error depends on the hyper-
parameter Tm for the inﬁnite-range version of our model when we set to Q = 8, Js = 1, Ts = 1, M = 3.5 (= (Q−1)/2), 4.5
and J = 1. We ﬁnd from Figs. 7 (a) and (b) that the mean square error takes its minimum in the wide range on Tm
including the Bayes-optimal condition Tm = Ts (= 1). Here, we note that m = m0 (= 3.5) holds under the Bayes-optimal
condition, Tm = Ts for both cases of M = 3.5 and M = 4.5, which is shown in Fig. 8. From this fact, we might evaluate
the gap ∆between the lowest value of the mean square error and the second lowest value obtained at the higher
temperature than Ts as follows

(20)
For example, for Q = 8, we evaluate the gap as ∆= (8)−2 = 0.00156 and this value agree with the result shown in
Fig. 7.
From Figs. 7 and 8, we also ﬁnd that the range of Tm in which the mean square error takes the lowest value coincides
with the range of temperature Tm for which the magnetization satisﬁes m(Tm) = m(Ts = 1) ± 1 = 3.5 ± 1 as shown in
Fig. 8. This robustness for the hyper-parameter selecting is one of the desirable properties from the view point of the
practical use of our approach. Further, in order to clarify the validity of thermal ﬂuctuations, we observe the gray-level
distribution shown in Fig. 9.
This means that thermal ﬂuctuations due to the appropriate temperature Tm generates the appropriate gray-level distri-
bution shown in Fig. 9(a). Then, as shown in Fig. 9 (b), if Tm is set to be smaller than the optimal value (Tm = 0.1), the
gray-level distribution of the restored image is similar to the initial state. On the contrary, as shown in 9 (b), if Tm is set
to be larger than the optimal value (Tm = 5.0), the gray-level distribution becomes broad due to thermal ﬂuctuations.

Bethe approximation
In this section, we construct a practically useful method to inverse halftoning by making use of the Bethe approximation
which is established in statistical mechanics to approximate the thermodynamic properties of magnetic spin systems.
Then, we investigate the statistical performance of the Bethe approximation to inverse halftoning based on the mean
square error. For convenience, we denote the marginal probability distributions Pr

Bayes-optimal solution to inverse halftoning based on statistical mechanics of the Q-Ising model
{µ(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)} and the derivation of the deterministic equations on {µ(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)} are similar to those of the conven-
tional Bethe approximation which is shown in [5], we merely show the results of the variational calculation in the Bethe
approximation. The obtained deterministic equations on the set of the messages {µ(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)} (z = 0, · · · , Q −1) are
given by
µ(x′,y′)→(x,y) (z) =

(31)
Here D(x, y) is the set of the lattice points of the nearest neighbors to the (x, y)-th pixel, namely, {(x + 1, y), (x −
1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y −1)} and D(x′, y′)\(x, y) is the set of the lattice points of the nearest neighbors to the (x′, y′)-th
pixel exept for the (x, y)-th pixel. Then, using the solution of the set of the messages {ˆµ(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)}, we can estimate
the marginal probability distribution ˆρx,y (z) and the thermal average of the local magnetization ⟨zx,y⟩at the (x, y)-th
pixel by
ˆρx,y (z) =
ψx,y (z) Q

(33)
When we approximate the marginal posterior probability Pr(zx,y|{τ}) in (5) and the local magnetization ⟨zx,y⟩in (11)
using the Bethe approximation, we may set ψx,y(zx,y) = δ(τx,y, θ(zx,y −Mx,y)) and φx′,y′
x,y (zx,y, zx′,y′) = exp[−J(zx,y −zx′,y′)2]
in (31), (32) and (33).
Then, when we actually carry out the Bethe approximation, we derive the solution of the set of the messages
{µ(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)} using the following procedure.
Algorithm
Step 1: First set the initial condition of the set of the messages {µ(0)
(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)} appropriately.
Step 2: Then, by making use of the set of the messages {µ(k)
(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)} (k = 0, 1, 2, · · · ), calculate the set of the
messages µ(k+1)
(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z) in terms of the deterministic equations:
µ(k+1)
(x′,y′)→(x,y) (z) =

x,y (z, ζ) ψx′,y′ (ζ) Q

.
(34)
Here k is the number of the iteration for the deterministic equations on {µ(k)
(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)}.

is satisﬁed, we regard {µ(k+1)
(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)} as the solution of the equations, {ˆµ(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)} and go to Step 4. Otherwise, go
to Step 2 and then repeat the procedure in Step 2. In this study, we set to ε = 1.0 × 10−5.

shown in Fig. 4 (left). The right panel shows a Q = 4 grayscale image restored by the MPM estimate using the Bethe approximation

by making use of the set of the solutions {ˆµ(x′,y′)→(x,y)(z)}
for the deterministic equations.
Then, in order to clarify the eﬃciency of the Bethe ap-
proximation to inverse halftoning, we investigate statisti-
cal properties for the set of the snapshots of the Q-Ising
model with 100 × 100 pixels. As shown in Figs. 10 (a)
and (b), we ﬁnd that the Bethe approximation accurately
restores the grayscale images under the Bayes-optimal
condition Tm = Ts = 1 and J = Js = 1. We also ﬁnd
that the optimal performance of the Bethe approxima-
tion (ˆσ = 0.004421 ± 0.000075 for M = (Q −1)/2 and
ˆσ = 0.015123 ± 0.000025 for the 2 × 2 Bayer’s threshold
array case) is slightly inferior to that of the Monte Carlo
simulatons (ˆσ = 0.004426 ± 0.000157 for M = (Q −1)/2
and ˆσ = 0.014861±0.000091 for the 2×2 Bayer’s thresh-
old array case).

Summary
In this paper, we investigated the condition to achieve the
Bayes-optimal performance of inverse halftoning based on
statistical mechancs of the Q-Ising model by making use of
computer simulations, analysis of the inﬁnite range model
and the Bethe approximation. Especially, from the statis-
tical mechanical point of view, we clarify that the present
method achieves the optimal performance for the set of
the snapshots of the Q-Ising model, when we appropri-
ately tune the hyperparameter which is regarded as the
absolute temperature. We were also conﬁrmed that our
Bayesian approach is useful even for the inverse halfton-
ing from the binary dots obtained from standard images,
in the wide range on Tm including the Bayes-optimal con-
dition, Tm = Ts. Moreover, we are sucessful in construct-
ing the practically useful technique for inverse halftoning
based on the MPM estimate using the Bethe approxima-
tion.
We hope that some modiﬁcations of the prior distribution
might make the quality of the inverse halftoning much bet-
ter. It will be our future work.
