A Linear Chain Approximation to the Ising Model 
with Alternate Next-Nearest-Neighbor Interactions2^ 
By 
F.W.O. DA SILVA and A.S.T. PIRES 
In this note, we obtain an explicit expression for the wave-vector dependent 
susceptibility %(q) and numerical results for the transition temperature T c 
for the quasi-one-dimensional Ising model with alternate next-nearest-neighbor 
interactions. We use a linear chain approximation where the interactions J j and 
J2 along the modulated chain are treated exactly and the interchain interaction 
J1 is included via an effective field approximation / l / . The case where both nnn 
interactions are present has been extensively studied in the literature /2/. 
Before studying the three-dimensional model, let us consider the one-
dimensional model which has been solved exactly by Stephenson /3/, and is re-
presented by the Hamiltonian 
H = - Y

,s. , +j1cr.s. , n-j-cis. ,) .

certain value q m which can be obtained from d %^(q)/dq = 0. We find

Relaxation of Magnons in a Ferromagnetic Metal

is the s-d exchange 
parameter, 
are Fourier transforms of spin densities of d and s 
electrons. In that model d electrons are assumed to be completely localized 
and are described by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian 
where J+ is the s-d exchange integral. 
Within the framework of the model the contribution of s electrons to the
