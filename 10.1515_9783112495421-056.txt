Random-Field Ising Model with a Zero Temperature 
Multicritical Point 
By 
L.R. EVANGELIST A and V.K. SAXENA 
The existence of atricritical point in the phase diagram of a random-field 
Ising model has been a point of much discussion /I to 4/. Aharony / l / sug-
gested that at low temperature the associated phase transition should be of 
first order (second order) when the symmetric distribution function of the 
random fields P(H) has a minimum (maximum) at zero field. Andelman / 3 / 
extended the discussion of Aharony to the case of distributions with a maximum 
at zero field and argued that the low temperature phase transition in such a 
case can be of second order as well as of first order depending on the form of 
the distribution function. Recently /4/, the question of the existence of a low 
temperature first-order phase transition and consequently a tricritical point 
was further discussed for the case of the distribution with a maximum at zero 
field. It has been shown /4/ that for such a distribution there may exist a low 
temperature first-order phase transition depending on certain inequalities 
satisfied by the higher derivatives of the distribution at zero field. 
In the present note we present the study of a random-field Ising model, 
with a distribution for which the system has a second-order phase transition 
at non-zero finite temperatures (T) arid exhibits an infinite order multicritical 
point at zero temperature. 
We consider the following model: 
where S^ = +1 are the Ising spins. J is the nearest-neighbour interaction. H^ are 
the random local fields having a distribution

As is usual for such models / l , 2/ we use the mean-field approximation and 
write the mean-field Hamiltonian as 
*MFA 
= \ N J z M 2 "SI < J z M + H i * i 
' 
i 
N being the number of spins, 
z is the number of nearest neighbours and M is 
the averaged order parameter (magnetization). Within the mean-field approx-
imation the averaged free energy F can be written as

In order to investigate the second-order phase transition, the transition line 
can be obtained in the usual way simply by linearizing (5), which gives 
T c = 2 h o / m { ( l + h o ) / ( l - h o ) } , 
(6) 
where T c = kT/Jz and hQ = HQ/JZ. Analysing (6) we find that the system under-
goes a second-order phase transition at temperatures 0 < T c =1, given by the 
solution of (6) for the values 1 > hQ = 0. As can be seen, the point hQ = 1 is a 
singular point of (6) and therefore the point hQ = 1, T c = 0 is not a second-order 
transition point of the model considered. 
Analyzing (4) and (5) at T = 0, we find that at T = 0 and for hQ< 1, M =1 
is a stable phase of the system whereas for hQ = 1, M = 0 is the only stable 
phase. Therefore, at T = 0 there is a strong jump in the value of M from M = 1 
to M = 0, while for T * 0 but T * 0 the transition is continuous. In order to in-
vestigate the behaviour of the system at T = 0, making the Landau expansion 
F = aM2 + bM 4 •+ cM6 + dM8 4 
(7) 
of the free energy, (4), for T = 0, we observe that all the higher order coef-
ficients, b, c, d, 
are zero. Thus, in terms of the Landau theory of phase 
transitions, the point T = 0, hQ = 1 can be looked at as a kind of infinite order 
multicritical point.

As is obvious, this result is completely different from the other theoretical 
results involving other types of random-field distribution functions where a 
simple trier itical point has been indicated at some temperatures generally different 
than zero. In conclusion, we feel that the existence of a first-order phase tran-
sition, a tricritical point or a multicritical point is strongly dependent on the 
type of the random-field distribution function considered and the behaviour of a 
system observed with a particular distribution may not be considered as 
universal.
