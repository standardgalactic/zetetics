Degradation mechanisms associated
with metal pipes and the effective
impact of LDMs and LLMs in water
transport and distribution

and Andrew Starr
Abstract
The effective operation of water management systems is contingent upon leak localization and detection – a common
problem that is more acute in large networks. This paper reviews the salient literature in this context and
demonstrates the effectiveness of leakage location methods (LLMs) and leakage detection methods (LDMs). Although
there is a significant amount of literature that discusses leakage localization and detection technologies, an academic
lacuna still exists concerning the linkage between degradation mechanisms and LDMs and do not cover or connect past
efforts from the start of a degradation mechanism that leads to changes in the mechanical strength (such as a reduction
in fracture toughness) of pipes and results in crack propagation and leakage. This review focuses on these issues in the
context of degradation mechanisms and common detection methods.

Introduction
Underground pipe networks can be found all over the
world. However, significant challenges persist. For
example, metal pipes are prone to corrosion, which
has a negative impact on networks. In addition to the
increased costs to service providers and reduced net-
work longevity, customers also experience a negative
impact. This underlines why research at the micro
and macro levels needs to be undertaken to enhance
pipeline integrity.1 According to Nykyforchyn et al.2
ruptures occurring in steel pipes are typically caused
by stress cracking. Moreover, there are significant
impacts upon steel pipe properties over extended peri-
ods of time and usage,3 resulting in reduced plasticity,
strength, toughness,
and fracture resistance and
increased fatigue, resulting in crack propagation.2
Elements such as hydrogen have a significant impact
on pipe networks because they accelerate fracture
mechanisms.3 This means that quantifying and under-
standing the deterioration of pipes is imperative for
pipe network design, implementation, and mainte-
nance. Figure 1 below provides examples of types of
corrosion in metal pipelines, which is typically classed
as the primary cause of metal pipe degradation.
Degradation can be defined as being the loss of metal
that occurs on the interior and exterior surfaces of a
pipe.
The impact of pipe corrosion is a common theme
researched over the previous decades. Proponents
such as Yamamoto et al.5 analyzed residual strength
from corroded cast iron pipes and conducted tests
that involved measuring corrosion based on the per-
centile graphitization area over a pipe cross-section.
Other researchers undertook tests on corroded pipes
that were approximately 100 years old and concluded
that corrosion had reduced pipe strength.6 Tensile
strength tests carried out on corroded pipes by other
researchers found that there was a link between resi-
dual tensile strength and the average pit depth of a
pipe wall thickness.7 On the other hand, proponents
such as Benjamin et al.8 concluded that the loss of
mass caused by corrosion is linked to the loss of
strength of the steel and results in leakage. Identifying
the relationship between these parameters and the

processes associated with degradation is important
when attempting to comprehend the evolution of
leakage detection.
Some of the literature8,9 indicates that the testing
of steel pipe sections with artificial corrosion defects
is common. It should be noted that the failure
mechanisms associated with artificial defects, such as
blunt and flat-bottomed defects, differ from those
that occur naturally.10 Cracks can be initiated by
corrosion-induced pitting, especially in cast iron,
because a natural corrosion-induced pit typically has
a rough surface.6 Clark et al.11 categorized pipe leak-
age into circumferential, longitudinal, and split bell
breakages, which are caused by longitudinal stresses,
transverse stresses (hoop stress) and transverse stres-
ses on the pipe joint, respectively. Soil moisture con-
tent
and
pH
values
can
also
have
negative
repercussions for pipe properties. For example, by
reducing fracture toughness, which will eventually
lead to catastrophic failure in cast iron pipes.12
Nykyforchyn et al.2 and Zago´ rski et al.13 found
that crack propagation significantly reduced resis-
tance to corrosion fatigue and hydrogen-induced
cracking, which are common features of the failure
mode for steel pipes used for carrying natural gas,
especially in wet environments. Recently, the litera-
ture has focused more on the concept of mechanical
stability when discussing steel material degradation.
Shyyan, for example, assessed how the level of resi-
dual mechanical stability and embrittlement could
significantly reduce structural plasticity. A reduction
in steel plasticity is typically associated with charac-
teristics such as corrosion and the brittle nature of
the material. However, these characteristics are signif-
icantly more noticeable. Hence, an assessment based
on plasticity features, such as those presented in ten-
sile strain diagrams, can be inaccurate in their predic-
tion of the long-term operation of steel pipes.14
Pipe degradation is representative of typical exter-
nal damage to both cast and ductile iron pipelines. In
the case of gray cast iron pipelines, this damage may
be obscured because of ‘‘graphitization,’’ which refers
to the network of graphite flakes that persist within
an iron pipe following leaching due to corrosion.
These forms of metal loss grow with time and in
water mains, resulting in leakage when left unat-
tended.15 The environment in which a pipeline is
embedded significantly affects the rate of deteriora-
tion and factors associated with soil, such as aeration,
oxidation-reduction (redox) potential, moisture con-
tent, and microbiological and chemical content, all
play a role.15 However, the fluid medium may also
have a negative impact on the pipe interior through
the chemical composition of water, temperature, alka-
linity, chlorine residuals, the amount of dissolved
oxygen (DO), etc. Moreover, the pipe interior may
also be reduced because of erosion, crevice corrosion,
or tuberculation. The culmination of these factors
may be that the pipe’s structural integrity is compro-
mised, such as by a reduction in mechanical proper-
ties. One of the prominent mechanical properties that
are significant in being responsible for pipe leakage is
fracture toughness, as this has a direct influence on
crack propagation within pipes and the resultant
leakage. However, only a very modest number of arti-
cles have reported establishing a relationship between
a degradation mechanism, its influence on fracture
toughness and the resultant crack propagation and
leakage. Without establishing this relationship, the
development of a leakage detection method (LDM) is
always challenging and its suitability for a specific
degradation cannot be justified.
Localization and leaks in water distribution net-
works (WDNs) pose significant challenges and are
only mitigated through robust leakage localization
methods (LLMs) and LDMs. The latter consist of
two
categories:
continuous
and
non-continuous.
Continuous LDMs also contain two categories: direct
leakage detection systems, which are external, and
inferential systems, which use computer systems for
monitoring pipes.16,17 Inferential systems require the
monitoring of flow, temperature, fluid, and pressure
to monitor internal pipeline characteristics. Non-
continuous LDMs can involve inspections carried out
using helicopters and trained dogs and pigs. LDMs
are summarized in Table 1.
A leak can be inferred by using the pipeline para-
meters above. The leakage detection method chosen
for a pipeline depends on several factors, including

product characteristics, pipeline properties, instru-
mentation, communication, and economics. Pipelines
differ considerably in their operational functions and
physical attributes, which means there is no single
internal or external method that can be applied
universally.18
A chosen LDM must employ performance criteria
and demonstrate sensitivity, reliability, accuracy, and
robustness. Nonetheless, any performance criterion is
contingent upon detailed knowledge of degradation
in respect of the mechanical properties of pipes and
their correlation with damage propagation and ulti-
mate failure. Traditional LDMs, such as monitoring
changes in flow and pressure, cannot be applied to
detecting WDN background leaks and are incapable
of adequately satisfying the leakage detection require-
ments in water distribution pipelines that are geogra-
phically dispersed.
Greater effort should be allocated to this type of
leak because it accounts for a greater percentage of
water loss than other types of leakage. In one of the
earliest review papers on this topic, Morris16 provided
an introduction to factors that may cause leakage in
water pipes, and a summary of several leakage control
methods was published by De Paola et al.17 The prin-
cipal characteristics of the different leakage detection
methods were compared by Cist and Schutz19 and
another categorization of LDMs was carried out by
Liou et al.20 Datta and Sarkar21 also reviewed meth-
ods of calibrating water lines (including leaks). Other
review papers focused on leakage methods, causes of
leaks, mechanisms of pipe failure, and the role of sta-
tistics and modeling in pipe failure detection and leak-
age localization in a very comprehensive manner.16,18
However, when these reviews are assessed with a criti-
cal eye, it seems that a comprehensive review study is
still required to evaluate how effective current LDMs
and
LLMs
are
against
prominent
degradation
mechanisms.
To differentiate this research from others, which
typically focus on leakage, a detailed analysis of
LLMs and LDMs was undertaken to outline their
advantages and disadvantages in the context of degra-
dation in joints and pipes. Focus was allotted to these
issues when selecting resources22,23 and an in-depth
categorization of performance variables and their sig-
nificance in network degradation was used to deter-
mine detection method feasibility. Moreover, through
the use of simulation models and calibration factors,
it has been possible to determine the fracture tough-
ness of metal pipes and how they degrade.24,25 The
next section provides the key principles associated
with the degradation of pipes and which are thus fun-
damental to developing effective LLM and LDM
strategies.
Following this introduction, a classification of pipe
performance parameters is provided in section 2. This
is followed by a discussion of fluid flow and piping
network parameters in section 3. A critical analysis is
provided of the material properties of pipes and their
degradation during their working life in section 4.
The effectiveness of fracture toughness reduction for
quantifying leakage is presented in section 5. A dis-
cussion on the effectiveness of LDMs and LLMs in
degradation mechanisms is discussed in section 6 and
the outcomes are discussed in the last section 7.
Similarities and differences in the
deterioration mechanisms of cast iron
and steel pipes
The literature demonstrates that corrosion is among
the primary causes of failure in underground steel
and iron pipes, which makes it a significant concern
for pipe network stakeholders, including asset manag-
ers and engineers.26–28 Pipes used in underground net-
works installed prior to the 1980s were typically made
of cast iron and steel,29 of which gray cast iron and
carbon steel were the most common.30 This historical
phenomenon underlines why these two material types
are used for the purpose of corrosion investigation.
More specifically, HT200 gray cast iron and Q235
plain carbon steel have been selected for investigation
because of their availability and their widespread
usage in the pipe industry, especially in China. The
properties of these specimens are provided in Table 2.
Although the function of cast iron and steel pipes is
the same, these materials exhibit different mechanical
attributes; for example, they are brittle and ductile,
respectively. The use of cast iron preceded that of steel,
mainly because of its low cost. However, the former
has come to be replaced by steel because of the greater
ductility and strength of the latter. The mechanical
properties of metals play a significant role in their
microstructure, morphology and chemical composi-
tion, which all have an impact on pipe longevity.

Classification of performance
parameters
Prior to developing an effective leak strategy, it is nec-
essary to comprehend the metal pipeline variables that
are linked to external and operational factors. For
example, in the case of a municipal water system, sev-
eral materials make up the network that are contin-
gent upon design details and positioning. External
and internal operational practices and geometric and
environmental factors are typically blamed for failures
in metal pipelines,31 the most important of which are
discussed in the following sections.
Geometric parameters and material properties
Length. Metal pipelines involve two forms of length: a
node length between manholes and a section length
between joints. As the pipe length in a section
increases, this can result in additional stresses because
of differential ground movement transverse to the
axis of the pipe.
When a pipeline is not adequately supported, the
length can cause an increase in beam stresses that can
result in pipe degradation, such as circumferential
cracking. When a pipeline consists of a node with a
length in excess of 500 m, it becomes difficult to
maintain.31
Diameter
The dimension parameter, or tube hole–diameter
ratio, affects pipe leakage even though the pipe hole
is the same size. This parameter can be utilized to
determine the discharge flow, as in equation (1).

The link between the diameter of the hole and the
diameter of the pipeline (or the curvature of the pipe
wall) affects the leakage rate, with a large variation in
the discharge coefficient (Cd). As the pipe aperture–
diameter ratio decreases, Cd values fall consistently.
Overall, Cd values also decrease with b (the relation
between the pressure head differential at the orifice
with respect to wall thickness). Small diameter values
can cause ‘‘bell splitting’’ in pipes under varied tem-
perature conditions.12 In cast iron pipes, molten lead
is used to seal joints. However, each parameter has a
different coefficient of expansion and thermal expan-
sion will lead to cracks appearing below the bell of
the pipeline.
Wall thickness
The thickness of the wall of a metal pipe typically has
an impact on operational pressure and depends on the
diameter and material of the pipeline. The magnitude
of potential pipe stresses is also contingent upon the
pipe depth and loading and may also be a function of
pipe wall thickness. Wall thickness must be considered
when assessing potential degradation, since it has an
impact on the time needed for corrosion pitting and
hence influences the life cycle of the pipe. Moreover,
this parameter has ubiquitous salience for all pipe
materials.31
Pipe age
The age of the pipeline generally corresponds to the
difference between the year it was installed and the
date it was inspected. Aging is a key factor in pipe
degradation.32 A bathtub curve is a graphic that
shows the pipe failure rate by age.33 The bathtub
curve is divided into three different phases, as shown
in Figure 2. During the primary phase (early life),
defects can occur due to human error and damage to
a pipe can be caused by inappropriate materials,
installation, and construction. The secondary phase
demonstrates the service lifetime of the pipe, when
the failure frequency is very low and almost constant.
Several random phenomena, such as extremely
heavy loads, ground movements, offsets, or third-
party interference, can cause failures at the secondary
stage. At the tertiary stage (wear and tear of life), fail-
ure frequency is highest because of the aging pro-
cess.33 The majority of predictive condition models
developed in previous studies indicate that the age of
a pipe is significantly related to the degradation of
the metal pipe.
Pipe depth
Many features, including pipe material and diameter,
the water table, soil type, and regulations, should be
considered when determining the appropriate depth
of metal pipelines. The outcomes of studies on the
impact of depth on pipe degradation are contradic-
tory in respect of various predictive models. For

pipe.34

example, Khan et al.35 demonstrated using their fore-
cast model that pipe depth is an important parameter
which, when increased, negatively affects the condi-
tion of the metal pipeline. This can be explained by
deeper pipes having greater dead loads on them and
an increased likelihood of coming across the water
table and, as the soil cover increases, the load pressure
decreases. In general, metal pipes are subject to more
defects and a higher rate of deterioration because of
surface loading, tree root intrusion, and illegal con-
nections. However, a greater depth of cover over the
pipes reduces the effect of surface factors, including
construction activities, vehicular traffic, and road
maintenance.36
Operational parameters for fluid flow
Cast iron pipes formed the backbone of water pipe-
lines in the early-mid last century. However, since that
period, engineering requirements have evolved and
pipe networks are now required to be able to resist
surges in traffic loads and earth pressures. In this con-
text, studies have investigated historic pipeline failures
to determine the environmental and physical factors
involved.37 Several investigations found, for example,
that failures were more likely to have occurred when
long droughts were followed by extended periods of
significant rainfall.38
Operational loads on buried water pipes
An investigation carried out by Robert et al. focused
on the impact of operational loads on underground
cast iron water pipes located in Sydney in Australia.
Several tests were undertaken to consider traffic and
water pressure loads on 660 mm diameter cast iron
pipe samples located in natural clay soil buried under
a roadway. Ground pressure cells and strain gages
were investigated to determine the impact of loading
on soil stress and pipe deformation.39
The field data results from Robert et al.39 indi-
cated that changes in ground pressure and hoop
strain caused by traffic loading had a marginal
impact on the pipes. Although greater pipe strain was
reflected in internal pressure tests, this was still signif-
icantly below the expected failure strain for cast iron
pipes. This suggests that internal pressure and traffic
loading are not existential factors when considering
pipe failure prediction, except when coupled with pipe
corrosion that results in high pipe stress intensities.
Nonetheless, there is a need to examine in greater
detail the impact of other factors on pipe stress failure
prediction.
Lin et al. developed an innovative technique that
used mathematical models, numerical simulation, and
in-situ water stagnation experiments to determine the
release of iron caused by a switch in water source.
This experimental procedure consisted of determining
iron release and the accumulation of in-situ water
stagnation on sections of Beijing’s cast iron water
pipe network following a switch of water to the
Danjiangkou Reservoir. Quantitative analysis was
carried out to determine the correlation between the
iron release rate and other key quality parameters.
The methods and resultant data were said to be useful
to those involved in switching water sources when try-
ing to prevent ‘‘red water.’’40
Water quality and alkalinity effects
Degradation is also caused by water attributes,
including buffer intensity and alkaline and pH levels.
In the case of the last example, when the pH range
falls between 7 and 9, this can result in tubercula-
tion.16 There is, however, a decrease in the release of
by-products at higher pH levels. The literature also
states that both iron concentration and weight loss
fall as the pH increases from 8.5 to 9.2.41 Lower levels
of alkalinity are typically associated with reduced
corrosion and weight loss rates. Moreover, when
alkalinity levels have been held at levels higher than
60 mg/L as calcium carbonate (CaCO3), customers
were found to complain less about red water.41
Dissolved oxygen
Iron degradation can occur because of dissolved oxy-
gen concentration; that is, as DO increases, so does
the rate of degradation.42 However, the impact of
tuberculation and iron concentration may differ
depending on the type of scaling. The literature indi-
cates that lower oxygen saturation levels result in
higher turbidity (an iron concentration surrogate);
however, there are also reports that show DO-free
water will not tuberculate.32 DO can also reduce cor-
rosion through phosphates, which can buffer ions.
For instance, in water with DO \ 1 mg/L, four phos-
phate solutions exhibited a greater corrosion rate in
comparison with non-phosphate water; in water with
126 mg/L DO, the observation was reversed.32
Fluid velocity
Fluid velocity plays a significant role in pipe corro-
sion. It is commonly assumed that greater levels of
corrosion will be caused by increased flow because of
higher oxygen levels. This can result in the protective
layer being subject to precipitation, resulting in degra-
dation. The literature shows that in the case of mild
steel, there was a decrease in weight loss as water flow
rates increased when the DO was saturated,33,42 in
addition to scouring of the protective scale. However,
there is also evidence that suggests denser protective
layers at higher water velocities.

Operational pressure
The pressure of a system can be maintained using
pumps and valves, which results in hoop or tensile
stress acting on pipes. This stress can be described
according to operational pressure and the thickness
and diameter of the pipeline. When tensile stress
passes a given threshold, this results in longitudinal
cracks appearing on the pipe wall. Pipes, valves, and
joints are also subjected to operational pressures that
cause axial stress, which can lead to circumferential
cracking.31
Temperature
The literature indicates little focus has been given to
temperature and its impact on pipe degradation.43
Moreover, as reflected by the Pilling–Bedworth ratio,
the heterogeneous scales of the iron formed on pipes
can make significant differences to physical proper-
ties, including scale density and thermal expansion
coefficients. When exposed to cycling or temperature
gradients, this causes stresses in the scale and cracks
that can result in leakages. The literature indicates
that only a few studies have evaluated the impact of
temperature on the degradation of a distribution sys-
tem.
For
example,
an
investigation
revealed
a
decrease in weight for iron samples held at 13C as
opposed to 20C.44 Additional investigations indi-
cated fewer complaints concerning red water and
lower
iron
concentrations
during
cold
seasons.
Lastly, two pilot studies indicated changes in tem-
perature were coupled with high levels of metal con-
centration and turbidity.44
Free CO2
Studies have emphasized the salience of ‘‘free CO2,’’
the sum of dissolved carbon dioxide and carbon diox-
ide. A study has shown that free carbon dioxide forms
surface complexes over iron oxide, which increases
the solubility of ferrous iron and causes an increase in
iron concentration and the degradation of iron pipe-
lines.45 The same thing happens with dissolved H2S
which also passes through two dissociation steps and
acetic acid which dissociates into one step. Table 3
provides a list of the most common chemical reactions
that must be considered in brine chemistry. Different
salts may precipitate if their solubility is exceeded, the
most significant being iron carbonate FeCO3, and
different types of scales that are typically calcium rich
(CaCO3, CaSO4, etc.).46
Manufacturing flaws
Several methods are used in cast iron pipe produc-
tion, two of the most important being centrifugal and
pit casting. Centrifugal casting produces better tube
results because of more robust microstructures when
compared with pit casting.47 Proponents, including
have highlighted manufacturing flaws associated with
gray cast iron pipe production. Others, such as Maker
et al. have noted that spin casting can be used for duc-
tile iron pipelines. However, organizations such as the
Canadian National Research Council have not inves-
tigated ductile iron failures.12
Impact of porosity. In pit-cast iron pipes, porosity is the
most common manufacturing defect and is produced
by air that rises in the pipe before it has solidified.
This phenomenon is less acute in gray iron pipes, in
which air can more readily escape through the inner
wall of the pipe. Nonetheless, this still results in mate-
rial loss in metal pipes and leads to degradation.12
Impact of inclusions. Inclusions are unintended addi-
tions that find their way into materials. These materi-
als then cause stress concentrations, decrease the
cross-sectional area of the pipe, and result in crack
formations.12
The above performance parameters and material
properties play an important role in pipe degradation
mechanisms. In the next section, the above terms and
their explanations are used to describe the relation-
ship
between
them
and
prominent
degradation
phenomena.
Correlation between degradation
mechanisms and performance
parameters
Although a comprehensive understanding of pipeline
failure could not be found in the literature, three fea-
tures are proposed. First, the installation procedure
and materials utilized, the interaction of the soil with
the pipe, and the properties of the pipe. Second,
operational pressures, resulting in external and inter-
nal loads due to site interference from unknown

entities, such as vehicles, extreme weather, and soil
overburden. Third, factors leading to operational
pressure caused by the external and internal biochem-
ical, electrochemical, and chemical environments. The
manner in which underground pipelines behave is
structurally understood; however, there are also
unknowns, including the impact of material damage
and frost loads on structural performance. This real-
ity explains why great efforts have been undertaken
to comprehend the physical processes linked to the
breakdown of buried pipes. In metallic pipes, there
are two primary degradation mechanisms: corrosion
and embrittlement. The following subsections explain
how these two mechanisms result in degradation.
Hydrogen embrittlement
A common cause of pipeline failure is associated with
atomic hydrogen seepage into interstitial spaces,
which involves the migration of hydrogen through
metal pipes, as follows:

Atmospheric absorption of molecular hydrogen
(H2) from the immediate environment into the
metal lattice of the pipeline.

The manufacturing process of pipes introduces
hydrogen into the metal lattice of the pipeline.

Precipitation of hydrides and the presence of
hydrogen-generating species and/or electrochemi-
cal reactions, such as corrosion.
Environments rich in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) increase
the likelihood of pipeline cracking, as this raises the
potential to poison the hydrogen recombination pro-
cess. The subsequent hydrogen attack results in pipe
leakages or complete failure, which causes significant
economic loss to operators in addition to environ-
mental damage.48 This, in addition to the aforemen-
tioned problems, underlines why pipeline metals must
be engineered with high levels of robustness.
In the case of high-strength pipeline metals, crack-
ing occurs prior to sulfide corrosion,49 indicating a
direct correlation between the mechanisms and differ-
ent types of hydrogen degradation. Nonetheless, the
fabrication and welding methods of metal pipes need
to minimize microscopic defects to ensure hydrogen
atoms do not cause problems after a pipe enters ser-
vice.50 Several common forms of hydrogen degrada-
tion are provided below.
The damage caused by hydrogen depends on vari-
ous parameters, such as the type of metal and its
microstructure, as these determine the hydrogen-
trapping potential. As shown in Figure 3, hydrogen is
typically trapped along the interface, defects, disloca-
tions, and grain limitations. Moreover, crystalline
imperfections, such as those mentioned, attract hydro-
gen atoms. This phenomenon has attracted a signifi-
cant amount of research recently, leading to extensive
research on hydrogen and its isotopes.45
As noted earlier, the mechanisms associated with
hydrogen degradation are complex, which underlines
why it is necessary to understand how hydrogen is
accumulated and transported, resulting in molecular
defects. Locations in the network of crystals where
hydrogen atoms are less likely to pass without being
rigidly trapped, such as inclusion interfaces,52 are
potential high energy barriers to those sites that need
to be overcome in order for hydrogen atoms to
escape.
Wu et al.53 and Roquefere et al.54 assumed that
hydrogen atoms that are permanently trapped are not
included with those that diffuse through metal. In
contrast, sites rich in trapped hydrogen, which needs
a low energy potential to escape, may be described as
reversible sites. However, methods such as neutron
diffraction may be suitable for hydrogen interaction
with
metal
compounds.
Hydrogen
embrittlement
(HE) can result in material cracking caused by a com-
bination of critical stress levels and specific amounts
of hydrogen. Although this idea is accepted in princi-
ple, there is no consensus concerning how this
mechanism occurs. Nonetheless, examination using
advanced techniques associated with fractographic
analysis has revealed the role of hydrogen in disloca-
tions based on specific principles.55
Hydrogen-induced decay between metal bonds
that results in decohesion (but not slipping) is termed
hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and results
in metals exhibiting little plasticity and a smooth brit-
tle fracture surface. HEDE is typically associated with
steel HE mechanisms. Decohesion as an HE factor
links material failure to reduced atomic bond strength
due to hydrogen segregation to defined interfaces,
such as the grain limit. When the cohesive force (scoh)
is lower than the applied stress
sapp


at the inter-
face, degradation is caused by impurities reducing the
overall cohesive strength.
Proponents such as Birnbaum56 have stated that
atomic hydrogen decohesion can occur (i) as an
absorbed species at cracked tips, (ii) in front of cracks
at particle matrix pivots, and (iii) at locations subject
to
high
hydrostatic
stress.

hydrogen flexibility suggests increased deformation in
specific regions caused by certain temperatures and
deformation rates. Atomic hydrogen within the mate-
rial composition reduces displacement movement
stresses.57 Since these sites are in close fracture sur-
face proximity, the damage procedure is described as
a localized plastic-type fracture, not embrittlement.52
In their study, Okonkwo et al.58 carried out a
detailed examination of localized plasticity and noted
the impact of hydrogen on the speed of screw disloca-
tion in a-Fe. Nonetheless, several questions are still
unanswered in the context of hydrogen-induced
cracking enlargement in relation to (i) increased crack
formation rate relative to hydrogen diffusion rate at
the tips, and (ii) the contribution of hydrogen to
improving plasticity as well as the likelihood of frac-
ture. Nazarova et al.59 demonstrated that temperature
increases in proximity to a pipe result in decreased
SCC susceptibility. For pipes operating in an H2S
environment, optimum temperatures were defined as
being between 20C and 50C due to a protective
mackinawite (FeS) film.58 When this upper limit is
exceeded, spalling occurs in the passivation film,
resulting in hydrogen infiltration and damage such as
cracking.
Within the temperature range referred to above,
passivation film may be subject to spalling, resulting
in hydrogen infiltration and cracking. Biezma60 com-
prehensively assessed the impact of hydrogen in
microbiologically influenced corrosion, SCC, and the
decatalysing of hydrogen recombination reactions on
metal surfaces. Crack conditions are altered by H2,
causing embrittlement and tensile stresses, problems
that are compounded when H2 is trapped in locations
under different forces. The impact of bacterial activi-
ties on a biologically active environment (BAE) was
also investigated on metallic surfaces. The author
concluded that BAE supports hydrogen diffusion into
metals when conditions are anaerobic. Nonetheless,
to comprehend hydrogen concentration profiles in
complex
systems
fully,
a
significant
amount
of
research needs to be undertaken.
Corrosion
Corrosion refers to the adverse effects of the environ-
ment that ultimately lead to material failure, as shown
in Figure 4. Moreover, with regard to metal pipe net-
works, corrosion refers to electron release due to
anode site dissolution and electron transfer from
cathodic sites, whereby hydrogen peroxide is reduced
to hydroxyl ions (OH-). Moreover, chemically trans-
formed hydrogen can also produce hydrogen gas.61
The redox process forms part of the corrosion process
and can be mathematically represented in two half
cells and in overall responses, as per equation (2).
Fe + 2H+ ! Fe2 + H2
ð2Þ
Figure 5 shows the anode and cathode electrons
typically found on a pipe exterior; however, for corro-
sion to be successful, an electrolyte is needed for ion
transportation. Pipelines used to transport oil and gas
often carry corrosive fluids, such as microbes, CO2,
sand, and H2S, in addition to organic compounds.
The literature and industrial data suggest that
metal corrosion in steel and iron is the most salient
cause of degradation in pipes.63 Since corrosion is a
worldwide issue, it can be considered a global issue
for stakeholders, especially for investors and engi-
neers who manage underground pipe networks.28
This phenomenon has spurred a significant amount
of research in the previous decades, including studies
by Dean and Grab64 and Camarinopoulos et al.65
Corrosion mechanisms differ depending on environ-
mental factors. For example, internal corrosion may
be caused by microbial effects, and external corrosion
is typically linked to the immediate soil containing
corrosive chemicals. The latter form of corrosion
depends on how the pipe interacts with its environ-
ment, which may contain an adverse or excessive
amount or level of mineral salt, sulfides, organic mat-
ter, moisture, pH, precipitates, temperature, and
other factors.66 Depending on the soil chemistry and

physical properties, the aforementioned variables will
have a specific type of impact on a pipe.
Most recent analysis has focused on corrosion
velocity,
progression,
and
mechanisms
and
has
approached these problems from a materials perspec-
tive. However, relatively few investigations have been
undertaken to assess the impact of mechanical prop-
erties leading to a change in pipe material. Moreover,
even fewer data are available on the way in which
corrosion has an impact on pipe fracture toughness.
The materials used also have an impact on the
potential for pipe failure, which means it is necessary
to assess how mechanical properties are affected by
metal corrosion since action could then be taken to
mitigate such failings. Pipe failure can be categorized
in a dual manner: rupture and fracture modes,
whereby wall thickness is compromised and stress is
concentrated at the tips of cracks, respectively. These
types of failure are contingent upon the tensile
strength and fracture toughness of the pipe matrix.
The majority of the recent literature in this area, such
as work by Hou et al. suggests that most researchers
have focused on the loss of strength, as opposed to
toughness. Inspections carried out on cast iron trunk
sections indicate failures are caused by crack propa-
gation leading to pipe collapse.61 This underlines the
salience of investigations associated with fracture
toughness and tensile strength to better predict pipe
failure.
Rajani and Kleiner15 carried out an experimental
study that tested iron pipes and pits in the absence and
presence of corrosion. Mechanical test results were used
to determine the impact of the geometry and dimensions
of the corroded pits on the residual strength of gray cast
iron water pipelines and it was concluded that the nom-
inal tensile stress (sn) where the fractures occurred
depended upon the size of the coupon and the corrosion
pit, as shown in equation (3)

Equation (3) can be likened to the principal equa-
tion of fracture mechanics. Wan and Zhang used an
experimental setup that made use of two thick pipes
with a 100 mm diameter and one long thin pipe with
a diameter of 10 mm. One of the thick pipes had a cir-
cumferential crack. Pressure sensors were attached to
the long thin pipeline with a partial crack model.
After inducing a leak in the system, it could be seen
in the form of a stripped circumferential crack in the
thick pipe. In a steady-state scenario, the pressure
applied to the side of the crack was less than the resi-
dual strength, which did not result in degradation or
lead to leakage. With an increase in pressure, the dis-
charge increased, resulting in a leakage jet that sub-
sided after pressure loss, followed by intermittent
leaks. Iterations of high and low water pressure
resulted in a phenomenon known as water hammer.67
An experimental study performed by Greyvenstein
and van Zyl68 measured leakage exponents of several
different leak opening types, such as circumferential
and longitudinal cracks and corrosion holes. Figure 6
shows a network with two removable end sections:
one end is linked to a municipal network using a com-
bination turbine flow meter and the other is linked
downstream using a pressure transducer that acquires
flow data.
When flow and pressure were low, fluctuations
were also smaller. Experimental data were acquired
from stable sections of the network and averaging the
data when the values acquired significantly differed
from this average allowed the leakage exponent to be
pinpointed.68
Below-grade concrete structure leakages are fre-
quently fixed using different grout-injection materials.
However, the choice of material is not conducted
based on factors which lead to environmental degra-
dation. In one study, samples were placed in a water
flow for 48 h, subjected to test cycles and then put in
a desiccator until samples reached a constant mass,
which was then measured. The grout-injection mate-
rial loss ratio was measured based on the results from
the washout resistance,69 as shown in equation (4).

The mass lost must not exceed 15%, as, according to
the KS F 4935 standard, if there is a loss of mass of
more than 15%, it would lead to degradation of the
sample and produce leakage.
The above analysis shows that deterioration in
pipe material is linked to changes in the composition
of the components. There is also an indication that
these changes are the main reason for degradation in
mechanical properties. Therefore, understanding the
link between the variables and a degradation mechan-
ism is a significant step toward better comprehension
of leakage detection. Moreover, the literature indi-
cates there is a need for further research into the
mechanical properties of steel pipes, including frac-
ture toughness and the impact on leaks.
Circumferential cracks
Longitudinal stress placed on a pipe will typically
result in circumferential cracks that are caused by pipe
bending Talbot,70 and/or by temperature changes that
result in axial tension.71 Bending may be the result of
environmental factors, which include changes in water
temperature, expansive soils, differential settlement,
ground movement, bedding loss, and rock impinge-
ment. Pipes that have a diameter of less than 200 mm
are more susceptible to circumferential cracks, which
are the cause of 80% of all failures.26 Circumferential
cracks may also occur due to graphitization and cor-
rosion pits. Maker et al.72 have reported that up to
90% of circumferential failures occur when corrosion
pits are present.
Longitudinal cracks
Longitudinal cracks are typically caused when exces-
sive circumferential stress occurs, leading to internal
pipe pressure, along with geostatic stress, a phenom-
enon that is more acute in pipes with a large dia-
meter.60 However, longitudinal cracks can also be
accelerated because of external loads, such as traffic
and snow.
Human factors
The literature indicates that human intervention is
also a cause of corrosion in water main networks
made of cast iron. Several causes have been identified,
including network negligence, third-party damage
from excavation, installation methods, and poor
design.73
Reduction in fracture toughness
effectiveness during leakage
quantification
Since the 1960s, engineers have been developing reli-
able fracture toughness test methods that are now
considered crucial. This led organizations such as the
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
to develop comprehensive testing standards and
review techniques, of which ASTM E1820 and E399
are the most common.74,75 ASTM E1820 is used to
assess the deformation of elastic plastic strain fre-
quency, JIc or dIc, and J-R curves or crack tip open-
ing
displacement
(CTOD)-R
curves
for
ducted
materials. ASTM E399 was the first fracture test stan-
dard designed to measure the toughness of deforma-
tion in the elastic plane (KLc) of sensitive materials.
Other standards include E2472, which is relatively
new and is used to the measure the opening angle of a
low-stress crack tip. Other organizations have also
developed their own standards, and these include
international and British bodies. For example, the
former includes a combined toughness test standard
known as ISO 12135 ASTM E1820, and the British
Standards Institution developed BS 7448, which stan-
dardizes the toughness testing operation.75
Investigations of circumferential surface cracks
indicate that the fracture curves at the surface of a
cracked pipeline are generally located on top of the
through wall of the cracked pipeline curve. However,
this means it is not possible to predict load-controlled
leak behavior. The load-controlled leakage of axial
and circumferential surface-flawed pipes could be
understood
through
the
relationship
between
a
decrease in toughness and increasing flaw depth.
Wilkowski et al.76 carried out an empirical analysis
that considered the axial surface crack bulging factor
and found an inherent link between a change in
toughness and flaw depth and noted the minor
impact of bulging to determine leakage.
It should be noted that it is not possible to predict
load-controlled leakage using net-section-collapse (NSC)
limit-load analysis for circumferential surface cracks;
nonetheless, leakage has occurred in surface-cracked pipe
experiments. This can be attributed to the failure mode,
as this transforms from a load-limit mode to a plastic-
elastic fracture mechanics failure mode as a/t increases,
even in the case of wrought TP304.76
In other work, Monte Carlo simulations were
undertaken with samples of crack 106 and fracture
toughness and yield strength and ultimate value dis-
tributions were first calculated. Failure assessment
diagram analysis was conducted under typical opera-
tional conditions and critical lengths for circumferen-
tial and axial cracks were determined in an iterative
manner, as shown in equation (5).

Displacement and crack opening angles were also
calculated, in addition to estimating leak rates using
the Henry–Fauske (though modified) model for dif-
ferent types of cracks. As shown in Figure 7, crack
morphology had a significant impact on the results
scatter, and even more so relative to the mechanical
properties scatter. Using the statistical data, the prob-
ability of leakage failure could be determined.
In Figure 8, the ultimate yield strength has less
influence when compared with fracture toughness,
which is in line with Dubyk’s results.78
This failure probability can be considered the
acquisition of critical cracks in piping, and the leak
rate would be undetectable. The outcomes of the
analysis can be seen in Table 4. The critical crack
length is aligned with a typical normal distribution;
however, the Weibull distribution is more suitable for
leak rates.78 A leakage rate model should be devel-
oped in future work, as the Henry–Fauske model has
a drawback for two-phase physics, since leakage rate
characteristics should be treated precisely for nuclear
safety.
A study by Nyhus et al. identified pipe information
and single-edge notch tension (SENT) three-Test data
with varying a/t (a/w for SENT) ratios (the same
orientation
as
the
crack)
and
demonstrated
a
correlation between decreased toughness and an
increased depth of crack. Notably, in this study, the
SENT results provided lower toughness values in
relation to a circumferential surface-cracked pipeline,
as shown in Figure 9. A commonly held opinion was
that SENT test subjects would demonstrate a greater
consistency with surface-flawed pipes79 from previous
studies using SENT with H/w = 10 and a/w = 0.3.

A discrepancy in toughness may be attributed to
the curvature of the pipe. In particular, tests on cir-
cumferential surface-cracking pipes may limit liga-
ment rotation, whereas SENT experiments with H/
w = 10 enabled this rotation. However, in typical
conditions, tension should provide greater toughness,

(right) cracks.77

whereas bending results in lower toughness. In order
to understand the discrepancy and align the results
with supporting literature,81,82 lower toughness with
greater flaw depth can be used to explain why
‘‘Apparent net-section-collapse (NSC) analysis’’ was
required to predict overload controlled leakage beha-
vior for pipes with circumferential surface cracks.
Studies available in the literature suggest various
flow maps (Fauske, 1962; Moody, 1965, 1966, 1975).
Fauske (1962) put forward a method for predicting
critical flow rates in the context of a choked condi-
tion; that is, choke quality and pressure. The model
introduced a slip ratio that is described by minimizing
the
energy
of
a
two-phase
mixture.
However,
Fauske’s map (1962) provided an instructive meaning
only
when
the
choke
conditions
were
known.
Typically, choking situations are contingent upon
upstream
conditions
that
include
pressure
and
enthalpy. The method Fauske (1962) provided was
developed further by others, including Henry (1968),
and included theoretical upstream conditions; how-
ever, no map was suggested.83
Rahman et al.84 also employed the Henry–Fauske
flow model, albeit following modification. Their
approach assumed surface roughness in addition to
the length of the flow path and number of turns to be
functions of COD at the center of the crack. For
example,
surface
roughness
is
mathematically
explained in terms of COD function, as follows in
equations (6)–(8).

Where ml and mc are the local and overall surface
roughness, respectively, and d is the COD in the cen-
ter of the crack.
The Henry–Fauske two-phase flow model can be
used when the wall thickness–hydraulic diameter
ratio has a value greater than 30. In this scenario, the
length of the flow path, number of turns and the sur-
face roughness of the pipe were also considered to be
COD functions. A similar leakage ratio to the modi-
fied Henry–Fauske model was exhibited when there
was a short crack length. However, there was a larger
leak rate since there was an increased length of crack
when utilizing crack morphology parameters for pri-
mary water SCC weld and SCC fatigue, and cumula-
tive density function was acquired for the leak rate.85
There also appears to be a gap in the literature
concerning the impact of corrosion on pipe fracture
resistance in simulated soil solutions. Chatzidouros
et al.77 simulated a soil solution (NS4) when exposed
to hydrogen, and others, such as Wenman and Dim,86
assessed the short-term impact of corrosion on the
fracture toughness of metal pipes when exposed to
different pH levels. These studies typically have inher-
ent weaknesses associated with them. For example,
the latter used manufactured soils with properties not
found naturally. Moreover, although data on hydro-
gen corrosion were provided, no toughness testing
was performed.

Effectiveness of LDMs and LLMs against
possible leakage
The literature contains several proposals for pipeline
LDMs.80,87,88
Existing
leak
detection
techniques
involve hardware and software methods. Adegboye
et al.89 classified these technologies based on their
technical attributes, which resulted in a tri classifica-
tion schema of external, visual, and internal methods.
External technologies are used on the exterior of a
pipe and check for leaks using sensing devices. Visual-
based methods detect pipeline leakages using drones,
personnel, and trained animals, such as dogs and pigs.
Currently, these solutions appear to be the best
answer to leak detection and localization. However,
these methods require operational time, which has an
impact on inspection frequency. Internal-based leak-
age detection techniques can also be used for leakage
localization and detection. These techniques typically
use computer algorithms alongside sensors to form
monitoring parameters that quantitatively describe
the flow of fluid within a pipeline, and include meth-
ods such as dynamic modeling,90 state estimators,91
pressure point analysis,92 and mass–volume balance.80
In other research, acoustic detection methods were
applied to 300 mm diameter ductile iron pipes. Open
taps were used to mimic leaks and associated sounds
were captured through acoustic loggers from leak and
non-leak specimens.93 The data acquired from the
fixed sensors are reproduced in Figure 10, which
demonstrates an attenuation trend as per an increase
in leakage point distance.
An ensemble transfer learning one-dimension con-
volutional neural network (TL1DCNN) formed the
basis of a pipeline leak detection and localization
technique, which was further enhanced by integrating
it into a 1DCNN. The TL1DCNN base learners and
associated weights were optimized through particle
swarm optimization (PSO). Leakage localization and
detection were then acquired through an ensemble
TL1DCNN. This method is advantageous since data
can be extracted automatically as opposed to manu-
ally
when
using
typical
data
drive
methods.
Moreover, the ensemble model approach also results
in performance advantages due to optimal parameter
selection using various combination strategies, batch
sizes, epochs, learning rates, etc.94
The TL1DCNN model proposed by Wang et al.
was trained on a small data set, resulting in high-
performance pipeline leak localization and detection.
The system utilized a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sen-
sor that monitored internal corrosion and pipeline
leakage. Following calibration and testing, the results
demonstrated that the FBG pipe-fixture sensor could
mitigate the large discrepancy between the theoretical
and test values and eliminate the limitation of mea-
surement range. Sensor data were further corrobo-
rated through internal pipe corrosion monitoring and
a leak detection test on pipe samples with differing
degrees of corrosion and leaks. concluded it was pos-
sible to use the FBG pipe-fixture sensor to detect pipe
leakage and decrease the localization error of the
leakage point to within 1 m.95
Leakage detection can also be employed based on
artificial neural networks with back propagation
algorithms using acoustic signals. This system com-
prises three layers: a hidden layer and an input and
output layer. This solution provided an estimation
accuracy of 97.2% and 96.9% using the feature set
{Peak, Mean, Peak Frequency, Kurtosis} and {Mean,
Peak Frequency}. The results indicate that the use of
frequency and time domains significantly reduced
false alarms.96
Proponents such as Aljuboury and Rizvi attempted
to assess impacts on leaks by using a novel metallic
bolted flange point and 3D finite element analysis
(FEA) and ANSYS software. A model was made of
fluid leakage propagation between the flange and the
gasket based on the pressure-penetration criterion
(PPCN) in ANSYS using element real constants. Bolt
loads of 10 and 17 KN were applied to the system
alongside internal pressure, resulting in a leak. The
results indicated that the PPNC and FE approach to
leakage study was an efficient and more cost-effective
method than experimental testing.97 Other research
forwarded a novel vision-based algorithm that located
loose bolts on flange connections,98 and Park et al.99
proposed a solution that specifically focused on
detecting loose bolt joints on wind turbines but could
also be applied to leak detection applications.
Monitoring gas and oil pipe networks can be done
remotely using wireless sensor network (WSN) tech-
nology, an advantageous method because it offers
fast responses, low cost, and leakage localization cap-
abilities. However, to acquire comprehensive bench-
mark performance, further research is required into
leak localization, sensing coverage, and sensing mod-
ality. Several sensors are currently available for
detecting pipe leaks using a variety of sensing modal-
ities. Typically, sensory hardware is installed on pipes
Figure 10. Acoustic detection performance using a multi-
sensor in high sensitivity mode.93

in
which
steady-state
conditions
are
expected.
Anomalies such as changes in pressure, temperature,
vibration, etc. are then made known. One of the main
disadvantages of using sensors is their effective scope
of detection, which means that leaks can be difficult
to detect accurately and additional sensors may be
required. In other words, one of the main challenges
associated with sensory solutions is optimal place-
ment and the relaying of data. Adegboye et al. identi-
fied several of the most common design challenges
associated with WSNs that result in suboptimal
design. Problems are typically associated with energy
harvesting, energy-saving routing, sensor coverage,
optimal sensor node location, fault tolerance, and
self-organization.89
According to Liu et al.100 real-time or dynamic
modeling is the most sensitive of the techniques. It
makes use of preservation equations for the energy,
momentum, and fluid mass of the movement within a
pipe and assesses the expected and measured values
to determine and describe leaks. The key parameters
assessed in this technique include pressure, flow rate,
and other fluid-flow variables. The literature com-
monly discusses pipe leak detection by means of an
approach based on transient leaks,101–103 a method
that has successfully demonstrated its applicability in
locating and detecting the position of a pipeline leak.
De Sousa and Romero studied the impact of oil leak-
age on flow and pressure characteristics using the
ANSYS Fluent basic flow simulation software. The
results showed the impact of flow rate and pressure
within the leak area. Others, such as Molina et al.104
undertook numerical modeling supported with data
from experiments that mimicked leaks in pipes.
Specifically, they reported the transitional modeling
of incompressible flow in short pipelines with lea-
kages. Experimental and simulation results proved to
be complementary, especially for the pressure drop at
the point of leakage.
Most of the research available tends to focus on
single-phase flow, with little attention given to multi-
phase pipeline leakages. This is perplexing, given the
widespread use of multiphase flow systems in indus-
tries that include the chemical, oil, and gas sectors.
Rapid detection methods are needed due to the criti-
cal nature of these pipeline networks. Kam105 devel-
oped a simulation which attempted to detect pipe
leakage, focusing on the positioning, size, and impact
of leaks on flow parameters. However, investigations
such as this typically have inherent weaknesses. For
example, Kam105 used a single-dimensional pipeline
made up of small networks, wherein one network was
used
to
model
flow
behavior.
In
other
work,
Figuerido et al.106 investigated the dual-phase flow
impact of the behavior of leaks in horizontally
oriented networks and considered longitudinal leak
localization in stratified flows. Figuerido et al.106
determined that stratified flow systems could adopt
typical pressure profiles utilized in monophase leaks.
However, similar to other studies, this research simu-
lated single-dimensional pipelines, which are inade-
quate for gaining a holistic comprehension of the
dynamic nature of multiphase flow networks. These
drawbacks prevent the conclusions of these works
being applied to 3D pipeline networks.
Fortunately, there are solutions to this shortcom-
ing in the form of 3D computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) modeling, which has the potential to assess
problems associated with complex multiphase flow
systems.107 This approach uses empirical models that
are realistic for multiphase pipeline leakages. CFD
modeling provides operators with an opportunity to
utilize specific pipeline configurations and offers high
levels of information on multiphase workflow systems
that could be hard to acquire using physical experi-
mentation or analytical models. 3D CFD modeling is
particularly useful for assessing the impact of the
radial location of a leak along a pipe circumference in
relation to the interface of gaseous liquids.
In their study, Arau´ jo et al.108 assessed the impact
of leakages in a horizontal pipeline using the hydro-
dynamics of the two phases of oil–water flux.
Simulations were carried out using the Eulerian–
Eulerian model in ANSYS CFX analysis, assuming
water and oil as a dispersed and continuous phase,
respectively. Part of the experimentation involved
changing the oil volume fraction at the pipeline inlet.
The researchers found the oil released at the leakage
site reached a steady value of approximately 0.4 s in
all simulations. However, the study was limited
because it focuses on the impact of a leak prior to the
flow stability time and, moreover, no flow pattern
was specified, which limits the applicability of the
findings more widely. In addition to the impact of
longitudinal and radial leak positioning, multiple
leaks and leak sizes largely remain uninvestigated. To
comprehend more fully the behavior of fluid flow
induced by leaks, some studies considered leaks in a
multiphase pipeline prior to and after the flow stabi-
lity state. The motivation behind one research study97
was the lack of literature in respect of pipeline lea-
kages that have more than a single phase at a time.
Although several research efforts have investigated
monophase pipeline leakages, significantly fewer data
are available on multiphase pipeline systems. This has
been reiterated by proponents such as Behari et al.109
who noted that leak detection methods failed to
address multiphase pipeline leakages. This is proble-
matic, since single pipeline leak issues do not necessa-
rily apply to multiphase pipeline systems.
Leakage locations have typically been measured
using the shortest distance with D(x,Xi), where x is
the shortest distance in meters to the leakage and i is
the leakage number, which gives XI. After considering
1868

the empirical data, a hyperbolic tangent was used to
determine the distance between function d x

equation (9).

Where x is the evaluation location, and a, b, and c
are constants used to correct scaling form function.
The leak function can be used to determine a confi-
dence value for leaks around the source of a flow
measurement. Once a leak has been detected, this
function can be applied as a kernel, and utilizing the
confidence, product, and distance functions it is possi-
ble to model leakages effectively using flow data and
a leak function.110 The salient feature of the investiga-
tion was the use of the gradient of soil temperature as
a prospective indicator of leaks. Another study pro-
posed a successful small leak detection procedure
based on doubling the magnitude of the gradient.
Using the temperature of the outer wall of a supply
line, it was possible to obtain the temperature of the
interior insulation. A volumetric leakage flow volume
of 500 L/h was acquired following a preliminary mea-
surement of the volume of filtered water at a given
time.111
In one study using acoustic detection tests, leaks
were simulated with open valves and simulated leak-
age sounds were acquired using acoustic recorders.
Measures were acquired for non-leak and leak condi-
tions to monitor environmental and active leaks.
After analyzing the noise intensity prior to and after
the leakage, the data showed an attenuation trend as
the leakage point increased in distance.93 Hu et al.112

works (MFCN), the DBSCAN–MFCN model, to

the

problem
through
the
simulation of pipe pressure. The data were normal-
ized according to equation (10).

Where xi is the initial data and xi represents the nor-
malized data, respectively, and mdata and sdata repre-
sent
the

and
variance
of
the
data,
respectively. In the event of a leak, there is a residual
pressure change in the pipeline in the opposite node
against time, which also allows changes in demand to
be forecast. The impact of a leak in another pipeline
with a leakage amount of 18 L = s provides different
pressure monitoring nodes. In short, this includes
nodes having different flow rates and different leak-
age impacts and the MFCN trends become stable
over an oscillation period, which shows that leaks are
correctly
classified.112
This
study,
according
to
Rajeswaran et al.113 used a repeated water balance
method for leakage detection by dividing a network
into two suitable subsections and monitoring them.
Figure 11(b) to (d) shows the network divided into
two partitions, with sensors placed on pipes 6 and 4,
which are shown with pseudo nodes M4 and M3,
respectively.
The flow through pipes 4 and 6 were 120 and
650 units, respectively. In Figure 12, the flow shows a
20-unit imbalance, which means the leak is located at
node 5 or 4. The water balance of node 4 points to a
leak in node 4.113 An inverse model was made by Ren
et al.114 mainly for the detection of leaks in WDNs.
Several corrosion levels were simulated using a local
corrosion model. Figure 12 presents results that dis-
play linear variation in the circumferential medial
strain at the angle of corrosion with a linear coeffi-
cient of 0.9796 and 0.9993.
This result demonstrates that when a wall thickness
is constant, the typical circumferential strain is rela-
tive to the corrosion angle of the pipeline. The

experimental results demonstrated the suitability of
using FBG hoop-strain sensors when attempting to
monitor pipeline corrosion.116 Considerable work has
been done to date to develop model-based leakage
detection methods. Although this improvement will
continue, it is apparent that these are techniques that
are only applicable to simple systems. Transitory
methodologies are one example, as, due to their weak-
nesses when utilized with network systems, transient-
based method development for leak control will be
restricted solely to pipelines.
In previous decades, traditional detection methods
associated with pinpointing leaks used an acoustic
recorder117 and staged tests. Most of these technolo-
gies reacted slowly when leaks occurred and required
intensive labor. Other investigations utilized tethered
acoustic systems,113 pig-mounted acoustic sensing,111
leak noise correlators,118 and camera inspection sys-
tems, the majority having been utilized in district
meter areas of WDNs and were obtainable commer-
cially. In recent times, a leak location algorithm that
reduces
human
involvement
was
proposed
by
Geiger119 and categorized as a wave propagation
method and a gradient intersection method. The first
is possible since leaks modify the pressure gradient
along a pipe in a typical way. A conventional pressure
drop in a pipeline with no leakage is typically linear.
If a leak is present, the pressure causes a defect at the
leakage point.119 The site of the leakage is determined
by calculating the position at which the pressure pro-
files cross upstream or downstream of the leakage, as
shown in Figure 13.
The cross-correlation algorithm has several prob-
lems associated with it, including the means of select-
ing the correct time window to allow the cross-
correlation function to have an obvious peak value.
During a leak, changes in flow rates occur that can be
detected using flow meters, and ultrasound scans
reflect changes in the pressure wave because of altera-
tions in sound velocity.115 Noise loggers used for pin-
pointing leaks are not always economically and
technically viable. A correlation function was used to
assess a leak and provide data concerning the delay
between two signals. Using LeakFinderRT, the time
delay (t max) was used to find the peak cross-
correlation automatically, and the time delay between
two noise signals was related to the leakage site using
equation (11).
tmax = L2  L1
C
ð11Þ
The leak position relative to point 1 was deter-
mined using equation (12).
L1 = D  C:t max
2
ð12Þ
Where L1 and L2 are the locations of sensors 1 and 2
relative to the leak, respectively; c is the velocity at
which leakage interference is propagated in the pipe-
line; and D is the difference between the sensors. By
substituting L2 = D 2 L1, it was found that using the
enhanced correlation function was useful for narrow
band leakage signals relative to the traditional corre-
lation function in the context of plastic pipes, multi-
ple leaks, and closely spaced-out sensors.115 For the
leaks assessed as part of the study by utilizing the
cross-correlation technique, the impact of the signal
source was greater than the cross-correlation tech-
nique. The velocity calculations were 482m/s for
input and 466m/s for external sources; however, the
cross-correlation of continuous signals was slightly
lower. Nonetheless, subtle differences in the calcu-
lated velocities emerged as having a minimal impact
on leak location detection. When measuring leak sig-
nals using hydrophones below 50 Hz, the higher sig-
nal amplitudes were miniscule. Comparatively higher
frequencies using higher levels were acquired using
accelerometer-measured leak signals.117
In their study, Gao et al. investigated leaks by mea-
suring vibration and acoustic signals acquired using
hydrophones and accelerometers at two access points
of a suspected leak. A leak noise correlator was used
to process sensor information for determining the

cross-correlation function of the signal to an opera-
tor. Figure 14 shows a conventional method of mea-
suring a water leak in a buried water pipe and access
points where sensors can be attached to detect dis-
tances (d1 and d2).120
Eddy current techniques are typical methods for
inspecting steam generator tubes. In one study, inter-
granular SCC was detected in the expanded tube con-
nection area of the top of the tube sheet and tube
support plate. Both axial and circumferential defects
were detected using the eddy current array probe. To
detect circumferential defects, the transmitter coils
were S1 and S2 and the receiver spools have been
replaced with R4 and R5. To continue measurement,
the transmitters and receivers were switched. Axial
defects required two other measurements: the trans-
mission of the signal with the coil T1 and the signal
received with coils R1 and R2. Calculations required
for determining the critical crack size were provided
and the existing failure stresses were based on the
hoop and flow stresses.114
It was found in one study that factors such as leak-
age values, air consumption, and compressed air sys-
tem characteristics could be determined based on
indirect flow rate measurements. Depending on the
time intervals, pressure drop ratios helped indirectly
to determine compressed air leakage. Temperature
must also be considered when the internal pressure
rapidly decreases and this solution is best applied in
industrial compressed air piping systems.121 This
research analyzed the primary phases of leak detec-
tion and localization systems and noted the complex
nature of having reliable leak detection tools. The
next stage involves developing a real-time monitoring
system capable of detecting large and small leaks.
The proposed methods are based on identifying blind
systems. Nonetheless, it should be recognized that the
implementation
of
methods
in
large
WDNs
is
extremely challenging.
Research challenges in the existing
literature
The main contribution would be determining leakage
quantification using an empirical relationship based
on fracture toughness versus initiation crack versus
leakage. Moreover, the overall methodology will also
consider fracture toughness reduction due to environ-
mental conditions and corrosion conditions.
Conclusion
The nature of pipe degradation within a system is
multifaceted because of the various chemical and
physical variables. Nonetheless, this research has
attempted to highlight the most salient variables
capable of having an adverse impact on network
longevity and fluid delivery. Network deterioration
can be attributed to a range of physical mechanisms,
including external and internal variables that have an
impact on pressure and alter the structural properties
of pipes. Nonetheless, the data show that hydrogen
embrittlement and corrosion are the key degradation
routes for metal pipes.
The data acquired for two-phase gas–liquid fluids
operating under different circumstances were also use-
ful when trying to understand leakages found in water
pipe networks. In addition, when modeling and spe-
cific site data are synergized, this should prove useful
to stakeholders, such as maintenance crews, others
developing risk assessments, and those involved in
CFD-based approaches, by reducing leaks through
early detection.
This research highlights the need for a leak man-
agement strategy that accounts for pipeline attributes
such as network location, design requirements, opera-
tional variables, and internal and external pipe fea-
tures. For example, design requirements and pipeline
locations are salient features for municipal water net-
works because network failure is linked with opera-
tional
features,
environmental
conditions,
and
geometric variables. Pipe degradation is more likely
to occur when these factors are neglected, resulting in
network degradation.
Pipe integrity is significantly affected when exposed
to hydrogen because of sulfide stress cracking and
stress-oriented-induced cracking, which can eventu-
ally lead to failure. Degradation of this nature
becomes more likely when factors linked to tempera-
ture, material attributes, and a combination of
HEDE require networks of pipes to operate outside
their design specifications.
This research has investigated the key factors
linked to pipeline leakages and provided a review of
LLMs and LDMs, as well as their advantages and dis-
advantages. Moreover, this research focused on pipes
and joints and the impact of degradation on their per-
formance. Although this research has responded to
the academic gap it set out to fill, future works could
place a greater emphasis on variables such as pressure
flow, the fracture volume of intel gas, and tempera-
ture. Moreover, emerging technologies could also be
used for detection purposes, including the Internet of

Things,
digital
twins,
and
artificial
intelligence.
Emerging technologies have the potential to play a
significant role alongside existing methods when mon-
itoring in real time and providing leak data, which
would facilitate more rapid decision making.
The empirical data show that fracture toughness is
lowered as flaw depth increases – a correlation also
reiterated in a SENT test using CTOD. However,
there are considerably fewer data available on simu-
lated pH solutions and how they affect networks of
metal pipes. Moreover, at times, the available litera-
ture proved to be of very limited use because research-
ers used artificial soils which did not reflect the
properties of soils found naturally. Although the
effects of hydrogen and corrosion were documented,
these studies did not perform toughness testing.
Data were used to generate statistical trends for
leaks and critical crack lengths before applying a dis-
tribution
for
crack
morphology
variables
that
described defects with multiple orientations. Using
the Monte Carlo simulation technique, the failure
probability was determined in the presence and
absence of a safety factor. After synergizing the data,
the results were aligned using a Weibull distribution
for the critical crack size and leakage rate. The main
benefit of this computation was the ability to deter-
mine several crack types for these distributions.
Based on the results, it is possible to conclude that
the crack morphology parameter affected the leakage
rate in a highly scattered way. Moreover, in terms of
mechanical attributes, the ultimate yield strength was
not as useful when compared with fracture toughness.
However, since the results were based on the Henry–
Fauske model, they have a weakness in terms of two-
phase physics, indicating that the leak rate model
could be improved further.
The available literature tends to emphasize corro-
sion velocity, crack progression, and mechanisms
from a material context. However, there are many
fewer data available on the effect of the fracture
toughness of pipe materials. This suggests there are
no data that link crack depth, toughness, and rates of
leakage. This research has attempted to fill this aca-
demic gap by highlighting salient investigations and
assessing LLMs and LDMs and their advantages and
disadvantages. Moreover, it has provided data on the
effects of corrosion on the fracture toughness of cast
iron and the link between surface crack depth, tough-
ness, and possible leakage amounts.
