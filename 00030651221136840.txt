What does Neuroscience Offer 
Psychoanalysis? Commentary  
on Solms’s “Revision of Drive 
Theory”
T
his ambitious paper (Solms 2021) by one of the leading psycho-
analytic researchers and most prominent modern-day neuropsy-
choanalysts offers a heuristic opportunity to consider the relationship 
between neuroscience and psychoanalysis. Although focusing on the 
concept of drives, the paper is also a manifesto designed to demonstrate 
the broader psychoanalytic relevance of neuroscience. Given the vast 
amount of research data he brings to the task, as well as his prodigious 
knowledge of Freud, Solms provides a useful template to use in evaluat-
ing what neuroscience can and cannot offer psychoanalysis.
Considering what I understand to be his two aims, I will address both 
his ideas about the concept of drive and the broader contribution of neu-
roscience to psychoanalytic theory and practice. Toward those ends, it is 
useful to review what psychoanalysis is. After all, one finds fierce polem-
ics, both on the APsaA Listserv and in the literature, about whether it is 
simply a clinical technique, many techniques, a theory, many theories, or 
a body of knowledge with many applications (see, e.g., Eagle 2021; Jaffe 
2021; Sugarman 2021, in press). Nonetheless, many of us of a certain 
generation were drawn to psychoanalysis because it seemed to offer the 
most elegant model of human mental functioning, one that could help us 
understand our patients and guide us in our efforts to treat them. In short, 
psychoanalysis, first and foremost, consists of a model of the mind. To be

sure, there are currently many competing theories of mind as psycho-
analysis embraces the notion of pluralism while we work to integrate and 
prioritize them. Meanwhile, every school of psychoanalysis in our plural-
istic world has an articulated theory of mind.
Subsumed under this model of mind are three other models: (1) a 
model of development; (2) a model of pathogenesis; and (3) a model of 
mutative action. From its beginnings, psychoanalysis has been a develop-
mental psychology, as Freud strove to show how current mental function-
ing develops gradually out of an interaction between internalized 
childhood phenomena and external interactions with the environment. 
This developmental process is complex and was later elaborated by his 
daughter Anna and subsequent generations of child analysts and research-
ers. Another reason making development such a crucial element in a psy-
choanalytic model of the mind is the role it plays in pathogenesis. Unlike 
descriptive or phenomenological nosological models in psychiatry, the 
psychoanalytic model is holistic. Most of the psychopathology with 
which it concerns itself is understood as being on a continuum with every-
day mental functioning. That is, we do not see our patients’ problems as 
discrete symptoms unrelated to the way their minds work. Rather, we 
believe that they involve distortions or biases in mental functioning due 
to various experiences and phenomena during development having 
impaired these functions as the developing mind struggled to manage 
them in ways promoting subsequent development. From an ego psycho-
logical perspective, this process promotes adaptation. Flowing from this 
model is the psychoanalytic model of mutative action, which prioritizes 
helping our patients find more successful ways to manage these develop-
mental difficulties and their sequelae. Each psychoanalytic school empha-
sizes different mutative approaches based on its understanding of the 
developmental processes that have gone awry. But all schools, regardless 
of whether they emphasize the ego psychological notion of adaptation, do 
consider the mind’s development and its miscarriages when arriving at 
their mutative strategies.
The Problem with Reductionism in Solms’s 
Neuropsychoanalytic Approach
Unfortunately, the iteration of drive theory and neuropsychoanalysis that 
Solms presents in his paper says almost nothing about a model of mind or

development, let alone models of pathogenesis and mutative action (which 
he promises will come in future papers on clinical applications). This 
absence of a model of mind and its development is surprising in that he 
seems as committed to psychoanalysis being a general psychology as were 
the original generation of ego psychologists (e.g., Hartmann 1964; 
Hartmann, Kris, and Loewenstein 1964; Rapaport 1951, 1960) and others 
who were quite explicit about this goal (Loewenstein et al. 1966; Rosenblatt 
and Thickstun 1977). His earlier discussions of neuropsychoanalysis 
(Solms 2000, 2014) suggest that he and his colleagues view it as a compre-
hensive or general psychology. Fisher and Kessler (2018), for example, 
are clear about neuropsychoanalysis being a basic science of psychoanaly-
sis. They believe that neuroscience research can both demonstrate the 
validity of psychoanalysis and help it regain prestige and a place in aca-
demia. Many (though not all) of us aspire to the same goals and maintain 
the belief that psychoanalysis must become a general psychology able to 
integrate its unique insights with those of related sciences.
Surprisingly, however, Solms leaps over cognitive and developmental 
psychology as a means to this end in his emphasis on neuroscience. Much 
of the thinking in this paper goes from neurobiology and chemistry directly 
to mental experience, while bypassing all that developmental psycholo-
gists, and child analysts influenced by Anna Freud, know and are learning 
about the mind’s development and functioning. It is puzzling that he does 
so, given the criteria he insists psychoanalysis must meet if it is to be 
regarded as a natural science (Solms 2020). These are that it recognize (1) 
that the human infant is born with a set of innate needs and is not a blank 
slate; (2) that mental development involves creating the capacities to meet 
these needs in the world; and (3) that most of the ways humans learn to 
meet their needs are implemented unconsciously. A corollary to these cri-
teria is that pathogenesis involves failure to find successful ways to meet 
these needs. My impression from his earlier papers is that Solms would 
agree that each of these statements can be studied and proven correct or 
incorrect using the natural science methodology provided by cognitive and 
developmental psychology. I think he would agree that both of these aca-
demic fields have already contributed much useful information to psycho-
analysis. Yet they are virtually ignored in this paper.
Instead, he appears to believe, in this paper at least, that subjective, 
mental functioning can be comprehensively understood at the neurological 

Alan Suga r ma n
1142
level. Thus, I would argue, the model he presents here reads as reduction-
istic. Human functioning certainly can be studied at various levels: socio-
logical, psychological, neurobiological, and so on. Each of these levels is 
important to understanding some area of human functioning. According to 
many philosophers of science, however, each level can be understood only 
with concepts and methodologies relevant to that level. To be sure, others 
think that a holistic causal model should not be logically foreclosed. But I 
do not find evidence in this paper that neuroscientific concepts can be used 
to explain psychological meaning or phenomena. Blass and Carmeli 
(2015) make the similar point that neuroscientific concepts are relevant 
only in explaining brain functioning, not mental functioning. “It depends,” 
they write, “rather on what the person who comes to understand is seeking; 
for instance, whether he is seeking to understand how the other is thinking 
or what brain functions are being activated” (p. 1563). Yet Solms leaps 
across levels of explanation by using terms from mathematics and physics 
like entropy, attractors, and Markov blankets. At best, these terms can be 
understood only as metaphors, but it is not clear if that is what Solms 
intends. They are perhaps intended to make his theory sound scientific 
without acknowledging that they are relevant only to phenomena other 
than those dealt with by psychoanalysis. It is important that he make clear 
whether he intends the math and physics constructs he invokes to be taken 
as metaphorical or not.
Certainly neuroscience can inform us on what underlying brain func-
tions, processes, and structures allow the psychological phenomena we 
analysts study to occur. But it remains difficult to see how, at this stage of 
development in either discipline, they will ever expand our understanding 
of the subjective how’s and why’s of mental functioning, the so-called 
qualia (the “what does it feel like”). Neuroscience provides only a paral-
lelism that demonstrates the correlation between brain functioning and 
subjective mental experience (Grossman and Simon 1969). But no super-
ordinate model of human functioning has yet been discovered that can 
encompass and integrate the neurological and psychological spheres of 
human experience. Even if one agrees to define drive as arising from 
neurobiological sources, it “becomes motivational only when it is cogni-
tively represented. Without such a mediating structuring process, external 
and internal stimulation have activating but not directional effects” (Klein 
1967, p. 87). That is, drives cannot be motivating unless they are struc-
tured cognitive-affective-motor events (Klein 1976). For example, dream 

Commentary on Solms
1143
research finds a strong correlation between rapid eye movements and 
dreaming. But this correlation does not provide any understanding into 
the meaning of dreams (Grossman and Simon 1969).
The Absence of the Concept of Mental Representation
Interestingly, Solms’s description of emotions as elements of drives that 
motivate human functioning ignores the essential developmental and cogni-
tive concept of mental representation, the likely innate capacity that allows 
subjective experience to be encoded so that memory and learning can occur. 
Everyone’s mind can make meaning because it can represent internal and 
external reality and amalgamate them into conscious and unconscious fanta-
sies, which are a subset of the mental representations that constitute mind 
(Erreich 2015). There is a vast amount of research on the development of 
these representations, their developmental sequence, and their stability, as 
well as their impact on pathogenesis and mutative action. Developmental 
and cognitive research support clinical experience that emotions are com-
mon components of self- and object representations. Yet Solms writes as 
though representations are not part of the psychological amalgam that makes 
each individual’s cognitive/emotional mind unique.
The Conceptual Problem of Psychic Energy
A similar reductionism can be seen with his emphasis on psychic 
energy. The economic model, with its reliance on the vicissitudes of psy-
chic energy, is possibly the most criticized metapsychological model in 
psychoanalysis. Most contemporary ego psychological, relational, and 
self psychological analysts (as well as some others) would agree that mental 
events cannot be explained in terms of psychic energy. Instead, such con-
cepts as bound and unbound energy, or cathexis and countercathexis, 
originally served as metaphors to make our emphasis on subjective phe-
nomena seem more scientific. “It is hard to avoid the conclusion that 
Freud’s theory of bound and mobile energy has little to do with a concept 
of energy as used by the ‘other natural sciences,’ but that it is really a 
theory of MEANING in disguise” (Rycroft 1968, p. 43). Yet Solms intro-
duces the “free energy principle” to buttress his insistence that energy is 
required for systems to function, even psychological systems. “The revo-
lution I am referring to is the insight that the entire nervous system func-
tions according to a single principle, the free energy principle, derived 
from statistical mechanics. . . . Somatic and mental events are therefore 

Alan Suga r ma n
1144
explicable in terms of a single unifying principle” (pp. 1056–1057). There 
seems little difference between his concepts of free and bound energy and 
ego psychology’s long repudiated concepts of mobile and bound energy. 
In fact, he believes that his research achieves Freud’s desire (1895) to 
“represent psychical processes as quantitatively determinate states of 
specifiable material particles” (p. 295) and that “now we can measure it” 
(Solms, p. 1057), a claim that seems unlikely to be substantiated. These 
assertions appear as questionable as the similar, long repudiated ones 
from ego psychology (e.g., Holt 1965; Kubie 1947; Rubenstein 1965; 
Rosenblatt and Thickstun 1970). After all, mental events involve mean-
ing, not energy, because they occur in the mind of an individual, not in a 
nervous system. A psychoanalytic model of mind should explain human 
subjectivity, not just redescribe it using neuroscientific terms and ideas 
(Sugarman 1977).
Most criticisms of the concept of psychic energy coming from ego 
psychology argue either that it is based on Freud’s outdated understand-
ing of physics or that it is not necessary or adequate to explain the mental 
phenomena to which it has been applied (Rosenblatt and Thickstun 1970; 
Rubenstein 1967). Gill (1967) and Holt (1967), for example, demon-
strated that it is unnecessary for explaining the phenomena of primary and 
secondary process, while Klein (1967) provided a conceptual model to 
explain the activating impact of motivation that does not need a concept 
of energy, particularly a theoretically inaccurate one. Likewise, concepts 
have been developed to explain mental/emotional intensity or quantita-
tive variations in subjective experience without relying on an energic con-
cept (Rosenblatt and Thickstun 1970). The same can be said for psychic 
structure and symbol formation (Wolff 1967), learning (Rosenblatt and 
Thickstun 1970), and memory (Loewald 1976; Paul 1967). Most impor-
tant, these alternative formulations use data from related academic disci-
plines at the same level of explanation, primarily cognitive and 
developmental psychology. They thus allow the possibility for psycho-
analysis to become the general psychology desired by Solms without 
using the neuroscientific concepts he espouses.
The Problem of Anthropomorphism
This current rendition of Solms’s neuropsychoanalytic revision 
leaves the concept of drive open to the same criticism that Schafer (1973) 
levied against the idea of autonomous ego functions almost half a century 

Commentary on Solms
1145
ago: “In being represented as self-activating and self-regulating, autono-
mous ego functions are being implicitly portrayed as independent,  
symbol-utilizing minds that can make themselves up” (p. 166). Just as 
ego functions could not be minds, drives cannot be either. This conceptual 
problem highlights the ways in which Solms’s neuropsychoanalytic 
model evinces many of the same problems with anthropomorphism that 
were noted with ego psychology’s constructs fifty years ago (see Gill and 
Holzman 1976; Grossman and Simon 1969; Holt 1972; Klein 1967, 1976; 
Mayman 1976; Rosenblatt and Thickstun 1970; Schafer 1976a,b; 
Sugarman 1977; Yankelovich and Barrett 1970) and even earlier by 
Brierley (1944, 1951). “Psycho-analytic personology is a psychology, not 
an anatomy or physiology, of personality; it is concerned with subjective 
experience and the motivation of behaviour” (Brierley 1951, p. 125). 
Using neuroscientific constructs to organize and explain internal human 
experience inevitably leads to anthropomorphism along with a mechanis-
tic, marionette model of the person. The term marionette suggests the 
tendency inherent in nonpsychological models to characterize the indi-
vidual as directed by forces or agencies according to principles inherent 
in those forces or agencies (Shapiro 1970).
Such models “become anthropomorphic by virtue of introducing into 
the mind different parts that have different interests, claims, and wishes, 
just as does the person himself” (Grossman and Simon 1969, p. 91). For 
example, Freud applied the notions of intention and interest to the con-
cept of instinct despite instincts being unable to have intentions or inter-
ests; only human beings can. Solms’s model demonstrates similar 
tendencies. He introduces the idea of biological self-organizing systems 
to bridge the boundary between nonliving systems like crystals, living 
ones like cells, and sentient ones like the mind. He then goes a step further 
and asserts that all have aims and purposes (pp. 1057–1058). Finally, he 
suggests that all such systems form a “Markov blanket” separating the 
system from the nonsystem, thereby providing the origins of “selfhood” 
and “subjectivity.” It is as though brain cells, neuroanatomical structures, 
and neurochemical processes are capable of aims, purposes, subjectivity, 
and a sense of self. This poses the same theoretical difficulties as the 
anthropomorphic use by early ego psychologists of structural constructs 
and energic vicissitudes to explain pathogenesis and mental functioning 
(see, e.g., Fenichel 1945; Hartmann, Kris, and Loewenstein 1964).

The Absence of Subjective Experience and 
Meaning in a Neuropsychoanalytic Model
In his paper, Solms writes as though mind were a biological entity, with 
neurobiologically based drives and biochemically based psychic energy 
the phenomena that make it work. Because of Solms’s explicit commit-
ment to Freud’s goal of a scientific psychology grounded in biology 
(1895), his paper and neuropsychoanalysis more generally minimize the 
importance of subjectivity in both theory and clinical psychoanalytic 
practice. Today most psychoanalytic schools emphasize the importance 
of subjectivity and its contribution to both everyday mental functioning 
and the problems for which patients seek treatment. Different schools 
emphasize different subjective factors involved in the mind’s continuous 
making of meaning out of various internal and external experiences and 
phenomena; but all of them emphasize the importance of the mind’s 
meaning-making function in contributing to symptoms, character traits, 
and behavioral difficulties. Clinically we work to help patients become 
aware of their mind—its contents and processes—and to see how it is 
both affected by and affects inner and outer reality. Becoming aware of 
one’s subjective meanings instantiated in conscious and unconscious fan-
tasies is what helps our patients change (Erreich 2015, 2017). Such self-
knowing is a psychological phenomenon and can be emphasized to place 
psychoanalysis well within the domain of scientific psychology.
For this reason, Pulver (2003) is adamant that neuroscience has no rel-
evance for the practice of clinical psychoanalysis. “If there is a single over-
arching principle that governs our behavior in the analytic situation, it is 
that we attempt to understand our patient’s individual, specific motivations, 
particularly as they are manifested in the analytic relationship, and to help 
the patient understand them. We deal, that is, with the specific contents of 
the patient’s mind and the specific processes he or she uses to regulate 
them. Neuroscience clarifies the anatomical and physiological substrates 
from which these motivations arise. It may also say something about the 
general functioning of these motivations, but by its very nature it can say 
little about the meaning they have for an individual” (p. 762).
Blass and Carmeli (2015) use a clinical example provided by Solms 
and his colleagues to emphasize the seeming unawareness of the central-
ity of subjective experience by neuropsychoanalysis. This lack of aware-
ness, they argue, is dangerous for psychoanalysis. The work they critique 

Commentary on Solms
1147
was offered by Solms and his colleagues (Yovell, Solms, and Fotopoulou 
2015) to support the clinical utility of neuropsychoanalysis. Although 
Solms promises to demonstrate in future work the clinical implications of 
his neuroscientific theory of drives, the earlier paper with his colleagues 
seems to support the complaint that he does not emphasize the essential 
role of subjectivity and meaning-making in clinical psychoanalytic prac-
tice. The clinical example of Ms. A. involves a woman who reveals early 
in treatment the strong hope that analytic psychotherapy will allow her to 
regain her memory of childhood sexual abuse and so lay to rest her 
chronic uncertainty and ambivalent feelings about important figures who 
refuse to believe it occurred. From her perspective, treatment should lift 
repression of the abuse, presumably enveloping her memory, and prove 
her belief correct. If she does not regain the memory during the treatment, 
she will be proven wrong and to have created a false memory. After two 
years of failing to gain any definitive memory either way, the therapist 
tells her that neuroscientific research demonstrates that events occurring 
during great stress may not be encoded in declarative memory. That is, 
her failure to regain the memory of the presumed abuse would not conclu-
sively mean that it had not occurred. Learning this data significantly 
attenuated her anxiety, guilt, and shame.
The fact that this information was “therapeutic” is certainly worthy of 
study, as one could easily imagine it making the patient even more rigidly 
anxious. But, as Blass and Carmeli point out, this sort of supportive inter-
vention simply reduced the patient’s anxiety by providing external infor-
mation rather than analyzing the plethora of motives, anxieties, and 
conflicts making the question so important to her. To use Pulver’s terms, it 
sidestepped the opportunity to help the patient understand the deeper, 
developmentally based meaning of her preoccupation. Given that Solms 
and his colleagues offered the vignette as an example of the role neurosci-
ence can play in clinical technique, some might conclude instead that it 
illustrates the truth of Pulver’s title: “the astonishing clinical irrelevance of 
neuroscience.” It gives the impression that Solms and his colleagues see 
analytically oriented treatment as helping the patient know her historical 
reality using logic and manifest content. They demonstrate no attempt to 
understand or address the unconscious logic and meaning of the patient’s 
belief, particularly why knowing the “truth” was so important. Instead 
they conceptualized their task as helping her realize that she might never 
remember because of how the brain encodes traumatic memories. By not 

Alan Suga r ma n

considering development or the complex ways that minds function, neuro-
psychoanalysis cannot make sense of the kind of beliefs/fantasies that are 
perfectly logical to a child who does not understand how the world works 
or why certain fantasies are maintained and transformed throughout the 
developmental process. This aspect of unconscious fantasies can be under-
stood as involving naive misinterpretations of events due to the child’s 
limited knowledge of the world (Erreich 2003).
Solms’s Revision of Drive Theory
I will now turn to Solms’s concept of drives to consider whether his revi-
sion adds to our psychoanalytic theory of the mind, including its clinical 
utility. Despite the length of his paper, he leaves the reader unsure of the 
place he sees for drives in broader mental functioning. Our traditional use 
of the concept is to see it as a motivational construct (Klein 1976) and as 
playing a role in intrapsychic conflict. In the United States, most contem-
porary ego psychologists and conflict theorists rarely use the actual con-
cept of drive these days; instead we use the term wish, a psychological 
concept that involves a mental representation. Wish is not an abstract, 
biological, or mechanistic concept based on dubious ideas about eroge-
nous zones and psychic energy. This equation of drive with wish has been 
with us for some time (Holt 1976). “On the basis of psychoanalytic data 
one can say the following about the drives: They are generalizations 
drawn from the psychoanalytic study of wishes” (Brenner 1982, p. 38). 
Further, there are myriad wishes that contemporary analysts deal with and 
discuss in their practices, not just the limited number of drives enumer-
ated by Solms. Contemporary analysts of many persuasions beyond ego 
psychology and conflict theory (e.g., relational, self psychological, inter-
subjective) do not limit the concept to oral, anal, phallic, or oedipal drive 
derivatives or any other biologically based phenomena. To restrict the 
concept to phenomena rising from the body (brain) leaves out psycho-
logical constructs like object relations, safety, holding, fantasy, mirroring, 
idealization, and so on that current models have deemed important.
In addition, the importance of internal conflict, even in theories that 
do not use that terminology, has been demonstrated by Smith (2003, 
2005). Thus, for most analysts, the interactions among and conflicts 
between subjective phenomena like wishes, anxieties, ideals, prohibi-
tions, and coping strategies are how we understand mental functioning. 

Commentary on Solms
1149
Wish as a concept has little use in our theory outside its interactions with 
the other mental constructs that we call structures or functions. Overall 
mental functioning involves interactions of the drive/wish with all these 
other mental phenomena, as well as the other mental functions tradition-
ally subsumed under the concept of ego functions (cognition, affect toler-
ance and regulation, etc.).
Solms’s decision not to explain the place of drives in overall mental 
functioning in this paper reduces their seeming importance. David 
Rapaport is reported to have said that definitions are matters of strategy. 
From that perspective, the question of whether Solms’s concept of drives 
improves psychoanalytic theory rests on whether his strategy of a neuro-
scientific definition and understanding of drives improves our model of 
mental functioning. But there is nothing in the paper that demonstrates 
any conceptual advantage to defining drives as he does. He states that 
drives push the human organism (I would say human mind) to reduce 
uncertainty and make environmental events more predictable. There is 
nothing wrong with this psychological role for drives on the face of it. But 
what strategic advantage does it offer the psychoanalytic model of mind 
in understanding mental functioning? Making the environment more pre-
dictable is part of what traditional ego psychology has called adaptation 
(Hartmann 1958), which includes conflict, defense, and compromise 
solutions. And adaptation is traditionally seen as involving primarily the 
ego, not the drives. Conceptualizing adaptation as the province of an ego 
that then interacts, or conflicts, with the phenomena we usually subsume 
under the concept of drives has provided a psychoanalytic way to account 
for both interpersonal and intrapsychic functioning, development and 
maturation, and pathogenesis. Unless Solms can demonstrate that his 
neurobiological definition of drives provides broader, deeper, or more 
accurate elaborations of adaptation, there is no strategic reason to adopt 
it. His choice not to do so in this paper makes it seem prudent to wait until 
he does, before we consider adopting it.
Another aspect of Solms’s definition of drives that bears further 
examination is his emphasis on drives seeking homeostasis. This view is 
quite different from most contemporary psychoanalytic models of mind. 
Traditionally, the mind is the psychoanalytic construct usually charged 
with creating and maintaining homeostasis between the competing and 
interacting contents, functions, and structures hypothesized to constitute 
internal reality. In fact, it is by making meaning that the mind creates and 

Alan Suga r ma n
1150
maintains equilibrium between these facets of mental functioning. 
Traditional ego psychology replaced the term mind with the construct 
ego, while self stands in for mind in self psychology, many relational 
theories, and others (Klein 1976; Sugarman and Jaffe 1990). Regardless 
of terminology, most contemporary theories see the mind as organized 
hierarchically with certain psychological structures/functions regulating 
subordinate ones. Maintaining homeostasis between all these functions 
and input/output with the external world is complex and requires synthe-
sis. Relegating the maintenance of homeostasis to a hierarchically ele-
vated, self-regulating psychological construct makes drive a subordinate 
concept that contributes to the unconscious internal conflicts lying at the 
motivational heart of the modern theories in our field. Organizing our 
clinical and observational data this way has developed over many decades. 
Important psychological concepts like selfobjects, compromise forma-
tions, alpha and beta functions, paranoid and depressive positions, all 
based on a mind that seeks homeostatic equilibrium, cannot be accounted 
for by Solms’s proposal to make such work a drive function. Instead, 
Solms’s revision of the drive construct, making it a neurobiological con-
cept, strips psychoanalysis of important conceptual moorings involving 
psychological, not biological, phenomena. He offers no conceptually 
strategic advantage to doing so at this stage of theory building.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it seems premature to turn to neuroscience to bolster the 
scientific status of psychoanalytic technique or theory. Trying to do so only 
repeats the efforts of traditional ego psychology many decades ago to make 
psychoanalysis a general psychology by using constructs and methodolo-
gies that were not psychological (e.g., psychic energy, cathexes, etc.). I 
doubt that a nonmechanistic superordinate model integrating neurobio-
logical and psychological levels of mental functioning is possible, but it 
should not be ruled out. Until one is developed, however, it is important 
that psychoanalysis rely on data arising from psychology to claim its place 
in the world of science. Cognitive and developmental psychology have 
contributed a great deal of information directly relevant to psychoanalytic 
practice and theory building. And they will continue to do so.
Moreover, using neuroscience as Solms does in this paper eliminates 
many of the concepts that psychoanalysis has found useful in understanding 

Commentary on Solms
1151
mental functioning, development, pathogenesis, and mutative action. To 
date, neuropsychoanalysis has not offered concepts or models that will serve 
our field better or make it more scientific. Solms is one of many who are 
attempting to study psychoanalysis using various types of natural science 
methodologies and concepts (see, e.g., Leuzinger-Bohleber, Solms, and 
Arnold 2020). Such research indeed strengthens the scientific base of our 
field. But I do not see his neuroscientific research as one of those contribu-
tions. In saying this, it is important to differentiate the relevance of neurosci-
ence for psychoanalysis from the ability to study psychoanalysis using 
natural science concepts and methodology. The latter is not a focus of this 
commentary. In fact, it is important to acknowledge that Solms (2020) has 
recently provided an example of how to use concepts from cognitive psy-
chology (i.e., nondeclarative memory) to study the clinical phenomenon of 
psychoanalytic process. Others (Jiminez and Altimir 2020; Leuzinger-
Bohleber, Kallenbach, and Schoett 2016) also agree that psychoanalytic pro-
cess can be examined within a natural science model. And Jaffe (2021) has 
shown that the importance of working through in clinical analysis can be 
understood using the cognitive concept of procedural memory. Like these 
authors, I believe that clinical psychoanalytic technique can be studied from 
a natural science perspective, while maintaining that neuroscience is not the 
appropriate source of natural science data or methodology for doing so. One 
can respect Solms’s many contributions to psychoanalytic research while 
questioning whether neuroscience can help us understand or improve our 
clinical work.
It is interesting, of course, to know what brain structures and pro-
cesses allow the subjective phenomena that concern psychoanalysis to 
occur. But it remains impossible to see how that knowledge will help our 
field understand the subjective meanings and motivations we study and 
treat. One can acknowledge, for example, that certain problems that we 
treat psychoanalytically have some basis in brain functioning (i.e., 
ADHD, autism) while also remaining aware that the developing mind of 
a patient with such a brain will always make subjective meaning of the 
symptoms through the development of unconscious fantasies (Sugarman 
2019). New neuropsychoanalytic data about such disorders will not 
change our psychoanalytic emphasis on analyzing the meanings the 
patient’s mind has made of coping with such impairments. Ultimately, 
psychoanalysis as a theory of mind, development, and technique seems 
most likely to evolve based on psychological research, not neuroscience

research. After all, meaning-making is a psychological, not a neurological
