Abstract
A random ﬁeld that is empirically equivalent to the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld is con-
structed. A mapping between the creation and annihilation operator algebras of a random ﬁeld
and of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld provides a functor between the algebras and the Hilbert
spaces generated by the vacuum states over those algebras. The functor inevitably does not ex-
tend to a functorial relationship between the local algebras generated by the random ﬁeld and by
the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, but the empirical content provided by the vacuum state re-
stores an empirical equivalence through the Hilbert spaces. The isomorphism from one creation
and annihilation algebra to the other is not translation invariant because it depends on mapping
positive frequency modes of one helicity to equivalent negative frequency modes, but the two
theories taken independently are presented in equally well-deﬁned and manifestly Lorentz and
translation covariant ways.

1. Introduction
The construction of a random ﬁeld that is empirically equivalent to the quantized complex
Klein-Gordon ﬁeld that was given in [1] depended on the geometrically unmotivated complex
structure of the complex Klein-Gordon ﬁeld. The extension of that approach to the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld uses the action of the Hodge dual on the electromagnetic ﬁeld as a complex
structure in a comparable way. The mathematics is quite elementary, so, after a brief presentation
of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld in Section 2, it will be presented with relatively little
motivation in Section 3, then the more delicate question of how to interpret the mathematics will
be discussed in Section 4. The interpretation of the mathematics that is suggested here diﬀers
from the interpretation given in [1].
There has been discussion of the similarities and diﬀerences between “random electrody-
namics” and quantum electrodynamics at least since the 1960s[2, 3], however the algebraic for-
malism used here makes the comparison, and the establishment of empirical equivalence, much
more direct. The negative frequencies that appear explicitly in the algebraic approach here appear

implicitly in random electrodynamics (which has come to be called “Stochastic Electrodynam-
ics” or “SED”[4]) as a factor cos (⃗k ·⃗r −ωt) in the 2-point correlation functions of the random
electromagnetic ﬁeld, [2, Eqs. (10), (13), and (14)], instead of ei(⃗k·⃗r−ωt) for the quantized elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, [2, Eqs. (15), (16), and (17)]. A broader analogy with SED is inappropriate,
however, because SED’s non-ﬁeld approach to electrons and positrons as particles rules out any
very direct functorial relationship to quantum electrodynamics.
The relationship between random ﬁeld and quantum ﬁeld test functions is comparable to the
relationship between the electric and magnetic test functions in [5, §V].
2. The quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld
The quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, which is properly speaking an operator-valued distri-
bution, can be constructed more eﬀectively using test functions (or, as they are called in signal
processing, window functions) than is possible using standard textbook methods. We use a
Schwartz space of test functions S to smear the operator-valued distributions of the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld, the 2-form ˆφµν(x), to give a complex linear map of test functions into an
algebra of unbounded operators A,
ˆφ : S →A; f 7→ˆφ f =
Z
ˆφµν(x)f µν(x)d4x.
(1)
To generate the c-number expectation values associated with operators constructed using ˆφ f in
the vacuum state, we write ˆφ f as the sum of abstract creation and annihilation operators, ˆφ f =
a f ∗+a†
f, where a f ∗and a†
f are engineered both to be complex linear by introducing the local real-
space complex conjugation f ∗(x) = f(x)∗, and write the positive semi-deﬁnite commutator
[a f, a†
g] as
[a f, a†
g] = (f, g) = −ℏ
Z
kα ˜f ∗
αµ(k)kβ˜gβµ(k)2πδ(kνkν)θ(k0) d4k
(2π)4,
(2)
then we introduce a vacuum vector |0⟩, on which annihilation operators have a trivial action
a f |0⟩= 0, which allows us to deﬁne a complex linear vacuum state ω0 : A →C; ω0( ˆA) =
⟨0| ˆA |0⟩, and hence to use the GNS-construction of a Hilbert space [6, §III.2.2]. The commutator
[ˆφ f, ˆφg] = [a f ∗, a†
g] −[ag∗, a†
f] is trivial if the test functions f and g have space-like separated
supports, but it is nontrivial in general.
The algebraic structure and the trivial action of the annihilation operators on the vacuum state
generates the c-number expectation value associated with operators that are constructed as sums
and products of creation and annihilation operators. The same algebraic structure, [a f, a†
g] =
(f, g), works for any free quantum ﬁeld, with diﬀerent space-time properties encoded in diﬀerent
forms of the (positive semi-deﬁnite) inner product (f, g). The form given above for the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld is derived, for example, in [7, Eq. (3.27)].
2.1. The electromagnetic potential
In terms of test functions, an account that uses the electromagnetic potential is largely equiv-
alent to the above. For the electromagnetic potential operator-valued distribution smeared by
a test function uρ(x), ˆAu =
R
M ˆAρ(x)uρ∗(x)d4x, to be an observable that is invariant under U(1)
gauge transformations ˆAρ(x) →ˆAρ(x) −∂ρα(x), we require that
R
M ∂ρα(x)uρ∗(x)d4x must be zero
2

for all scalar functions α(x). Integrating by parts over a region Ωin Minkowski space, we obtain,
in terms of diﬀerential forms,
Z
Ω
dα ∧(⋆u∗) =
Z
∂Ω
α ∧(⋆u∗) −
Z
Ω
α ∧(d⋆u∗),
which will be zero for large enough Ω, and hence for the whole of Minkowski space, for any
smooth test function uρ(x) that has compact support and is divergence-free, d ⋆u = 0. If we
constrain the gauge transformation function α(x) not to increase faster than polynomially with
increasing distance in any direction, it will be enough for the test function uρ(x) to be Schwartz
and divergence-free.
The divergence-free condition on uρ(x) ensures that the commutator for creation and annihi-
lation operators associated with the electromagnetic potential ˆAu = au∗+ a†
u,
[au, a†
v] = −ℏ
Z
˜u∗
ρ(k)˜vρ(k)2πδ(kνkν)θ(k0) d4k
(2π)4,
is positive semi-deﬁnite (which is required for us to be able to construct a vacuum sector Hilbert
space), and that because δu = δv = 0 we can construct, on Minkowski space, u = δU, v = δV,
where U and V are bivector potentials for the electromagnetic potential test functions u and v.
In terms of U and V, we can write aU = aδU, a†
V = a†
δV, which satisfy the commutator (2).
Consequently, turning around the usual relationship because we are working with test functions
instead of directly with quantum ﬁelds, we can regard test functions for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
as potentials for test functions for the electromagnetic potential.
The restriction that electromagnetic potential test functions must have compact support (or
that gauge transformations must be constrained if the electromagnetic potential test functions
are taken to be Schwartz) means that electromagnetic potential observables are less general than
electromagnetic ﬁeld observables if electromagnetic ﬁeld test functions are taken to be Schwartz
(as is most commonly assumed), or equivalent if electromagnetic ﬁeld test functions are taken to
be smooth and to have compact support.
3. A random ﬁeld equivalent
The construction of a Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld that is empirically equivalent to the com-
plex Klein-Gordon ﬁeld [1] depended on the Lorentz invariant projection to positive and negative
frequency components and the Poincar´e invariant projection to real and imaginary components.
For the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld we use the Poincar´e invariant projection to positive and
negative helicity components, instead of the projection to real and imaginary components, to
construct an involution
• : S →S; f 7→f •,
ef •(k) = 1
2(1 + i⋆) ˜f(k) + 1
2(1 −i⋆) ˜f (−k),
f •• = f,
(3)
where for the Hodge dual ⋆, (⋆f)µν = 1
2ǫµναβ fαβ, ⋆⋆f = −f, and we have omitted indices from
the above equation. In terms of f •, we can deﬁne modiﬁed annihilation operators, a f = a f •, for
which, with the corresponding creation operator, we can compute the commutator

which is symmetric in f and g, so that [ˆχ f, ˆχg] = [a f ∗, a†
g] −[ag∗, a†
f] = 0 for any test functions
f and g, not only when they have space-like separated supports. The universal commutativity of
ˆχ f for all test functions depends on the fact that f ∗• , f •∗.
There is a similar freedom of description in quantum ﬁeld theory that is only occasionally
noted, which can be presented using the relatively trivial map f 7→f ◦= eiα f, ˚a f = a f ◦. This
gives us an alternative quantum ﬁeld,
ˆφ′
f = ˚a f ∗+ ˚a†
f = aeiα(f ∗) + a†
eiα f = e−iαa f ∗+ eiαa†
f
, ˆφeiα f = eiα ˆφ f,
(6)
which satisﬁes microcausality in the same way as ˆφ f, [ˆφ′
f, ˆφ′
g] = [ˆφ f, ˆφg]. Weinberg notes, for
example, that we cannot have both ˆφ f and ˆφ′
f in the same theory [8, p203], so we have to make
a conventional choice of phase. Equally, to transform to a random ﬁeld formalism we have to
make a conventional choice of phases and use only that choice.
4. Discussion
We have shown that there exist equally eﬀective alternative presentations of the Hilbert space
of states, either in terms of random electromagnetic ﬁeld observables or in terms of quantized
4

electromagnetic ﬁeld observables. Exactly the same Hilbert space is generated by the action
of the creation operators a†
f on the vacuum vector as is generated by the action of the creation
operators a†
f on the vacuum vector, even though the algebra of local observables that is generated
by a f ∗+ a†
f is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the algebra of local observables that is generated by
a f ∗+ a†
f. The algebra of observables that is used in quantum optics and in other Physics is
routinely extended, however, by the nonlocal vacuum projection operator ˆV = |0⟩⟨0|, because
this or an equivalent extension of the algebra of creation and annihilation operators is necessary
to allow the elementary construction of observables that have discrete eigenvalues that can be
used to model the statistics of discrete measurement events. For example, a transition event
observable between a normalized vector state |Ψ⟩= ˆΨ† |0⟩(where ˆΨ† is, in the elementary case,
a multinomial in some set of ﬁeld operators) and a normalized vector state |Ψ′⟩can be presented
as the squared modulus of an amplitude
⟨Ψ|Ψ′2 = ⟨Ψ| ˆV ˆΨ′ |Ψ⟩,
which can be understood as a measurement of the observable ˆV ˆΨ′ = ˆΨ′† ˆV ˆΨ′ in the state ω ˆΨ( ˆA) =
⟨Ψ| ˆA |Ψ⟩. ˆV ˆΨ′ is nonlocal because of the presence of the vacuum projection operator, insofar
as the commutator [ ˆVˆφf , ˆVˆφg] is generally nonzero when the functions f(x) and g(x) have space-
like separated supports. With the introduction of the vacuum projection operator, the space of
noncommuting, nonlocal observables generated by ˆφ f and at least one ˆV is the same as the space
of noncommuting, nonlocal observables generated by ˆχ f and at least one ˆV. It is notable that
it is only with the introduction of the vacuum projection operator that the algebra generated by
{ˆχ f , ˆV} becomes noncommutative, but then everything is the same as the algebra generated by
{ˆφ f , ˆV}.
At a higher mathematical level than that of the rest of this article, the mapping a f = a f •
provides us with a category-theoretic functor between the algebras of creation and annihilation
operators and the Hilbert spaces that the vacuum state allows us to construct, that does not extend,
however, to a functor between the algebras of local observables that are generated by ˆχ f and ˆφ f .
The functorial relationship also does not extend straightforwardly to the less invariant algebraic
structures that are associated with phase spaces on space-like hypersurfaces.
It is usual in Physics to keep an apparatus as isolated as possible from all known interference,
but any interference that cannot be removed is, as far as possible, measured and corrected for.
In experimental reports, details are given of all the interference that was eliminated or that was
measured and corrected for, however measurement and correction is generally taken not to be
possible for the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations. This is justiﬁed because of the apparent uni-
versality of quantum ﬂuctuations, in particular extending to all measurement apparatus, however
the elementary mathematics given in [1] for the quantized complex Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, and here
for the physically more relevant quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, allows quantum ﬂuctuations to
be corrected for by reporting what experimental results would be observed by ideal local mea-
surements represented by a random ﬁeld. At the same time as we can report what measurement
results would be if they were not deeply inﬂuenced by quantum ﬂuctuations, however, the reality
of experiments is that there are incompatibilities between real measurements, which we typi-
cally model using nonlocal projection operators, and which typically are statistics of engineered
thermodynamic transition events, making quantized electromagnetism often more natural.
When the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations on measurements can be ignored, we can work
with the expected values of the observable ˆφµν(x) as if it is the classical electromagnetic ﬁeld,
5

as an eﬀective mean ﬁeld theory. When signiﬁcant eﬀects are caused by quantum ﬂuctuations,
however, so that a mean ﬁeld theory is not accurate enough, we have to accommodate the conse-
quences for measurement results in some way. In the quantum ﬁeld theory that is generated by
ˆφµν(x), the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations are modeled by the commutator (2), with the real part
of the commutator determining a minimum level of ﬂuctuations associated with the elementary
observable ˆφ f in the vacuum state and with the imaginary part of the commutator determining
a minimum level of incompatibility between time-like separated measurements. In the equiva-
lent random ﬁeld theory, using ˆχµν(x), by taking the positive and negative helicity components
to be of opposite frequency the incompatibility between time-like separated measurements is
eliminated, while preserving the same level of ﬂuctuations of the equivalent components.
