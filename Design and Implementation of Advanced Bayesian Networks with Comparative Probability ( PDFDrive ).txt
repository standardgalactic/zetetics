Abstract 
Design and Implementation of Advanced Bayesian Networks with

The main purpose of this research is to enhance the current procedures of 
designing decision support systems (DSSs) used by decision-makers to 
comprehend the current situation better in cases where the available amount 
of information required to make an informed decision is limited. It has been 
suggested that the highest level of situation awareness can be achieved by a 
thorough grasp of particular key elements that, if put together, will synthesize 
the current status of an environment. However, there are many cases where a 
decision-maker needs to make a decision when no information is available, 
the source of information is questionable, or the information has yet to arrive. 
On the other hand, in timely critical decision-making, the availability of 
information might become a curse rather than a blessing, as the more 
information is available the more time is required to process it. In time critical 
situations, time is an expensive commodity not always affordable. For 
instance, consider a surgeon performing cardiac surgery. With all the new 
advances in monitoring equipment and medical laboratory tests, there would 
be too much information to account for before the surgeon could decide on his

next “cut”. A DSS could help reduce the amount of information by converting it 
into the bigger picture through summarizing. 
The research resulted in a new innovated theory that combines the 
philosophical comparative approach to probability, the frequency interpretation 
of probability, dynamic Bayesian networks and the expected utility theory. It 
enables engineers to write self-learning algorithms that use example of 
behaviours to model situations, evaluate and make decisions, diagnose 
problems, and/or find the most probable consequences in real-time.  The new 
theory was particularly applied to the problems of validating equipment 
readings in an aircraft, flight data analysis, prediction of passengers 
behaviours, and real-time monitoring and prediction of patients’ states in 
intensive care units (ICU). The algorithm was able to pinpoint the faulty 
equipment from between a group of equipment giving false fault indications, 
an important improvement over the current fault detection procedures. In 
addition, the network was able to give to the aircraft pilot recommendations 
about the optimal speed and altitude that will result in reducing fuel 
consumptions and thereby saving costs and extending equipment lives.  On 
the ICU application side, the algorithm was able to predict those patients with 
high mortality risk about 24 hours before they actually deceased. In addition, 
the network can guide nurses to best practices, and to summarize patients’ 
current state in terms of an overall index.  Furthermore, it can use data 
collected by hospitals to improve its accuracy and to diagnose patients in real-
time and predict their state well-ahead to the future.

Declaration 
I hereby declare that the research contained in this thesis is my original 
ideas and work. However, the application of the comparative probability and 
dynamic Bayesian networks to ICUs was the result of thorough discussions 
between myself, my supervisor (professor Garik Markarian) and Stuart Grant 
of Manchester University.  Nonetheless, I have taken extra care to properly 
reference any work conducted by others in order to distinguish my 
accomplishments from theirs. 
The materials and work described in this thesis have not been previously 
submitted for the same degree in the current or any other form.

1.   Introduction 
 
We live in an ever-changing world where our convictions about the state of 
it update with time as we discover new information about our surroundings. As 
we acknowledge the imperfections of our knowledge repositories regarding 
the state of the world, we often need to make decisions despite all the missing 
details and the uncertainty of where our decisions might lead us to. A robot 
might use its sensory system, for instance, a sonar based sensor, to retrieve 
cues about its surroundings. Then it might use these cues to decide on which 
direction is best to turn to. Since the world behind the range of the robot’s 
sensors is unknown, the robot may take a turn that leads to a dead end. 
Hence, the robot needs to make a decision in an environment where the only 
available information is that of its immediate surroundings. Even if the robot 
was in an exceptionally charted environment, its sensors might malfunction or 
degrade. In this case, the uncertainty arises not from the environment but 
rather from a lack of trustworthiness of the robot’s sensors. In addition, the 
robot programming may contain bugs, the robot might trip and fall, or its 
battery may run out of power or be stolen. The list of events that the robot 
could possibly face in an environment grows infinitely as we consider more 
details. The problem of specifying all the exceptions a designer needs to 
consider is called the qualification problem [1, p. 268].    

 
Introduction 
2 
 
 
 
Uncertainty can arise due to external factors, such as noise. In statistics, 
noise refers to unexpected (or unexplained) variations in the observations of a 
process, as opposed to the explained variation where the mathematical model 
of the process can be estimated [2]. In digital communications, information 
may be sent as pulses with varying amplitudes that each represents a state. 
After random noise is added to the amplitude of the pulses throughout the 
transmission channel, the receiver has to estimate what state was sent given 
the random variations in the received signal due to the added noise [3].  
In general, uncertainty might arise due to theoretical ignorance, as is the 
case when scientists have an incomplete understanding of phenomena; 
laziness because listing all the causes that orchestrate the observed 
behaviour of a phenomenon might be too much work; or practical ignorance 
when we are required to decide based on partial evidence, for instance, a 
physician trying to diagnose a patient without performing all the necessary 
laboratory tests [1, p 481].  
Finally, in quantum physics, uncertainty is an objective property of reality. 
Certain pairs of particles’ properties are constrained together in a precise 
inequality, such that the more that is known about the first of the pair, the less 
that is knowable about the second [4]. Consequently, a part of our world is 
always going to be fuzzier even as we gain more knowledge about the other 
part.   
Probability theory is the main tool used to represent uncertainty arising 
from laziness and ignorance [1, p 482]. If we consider probability as a 
measure of how likely an event would be observed in an experiment repeated 

 
Introduction 
3 
 
 
 
a certain amount of times, then it could be used as a quantitative 
representation of our certainty of how likely that event might occur from 
among all other possible events. In this context, probability is interpreted as a 
degree of belief rather than a frequency of occurrence. It provides a 
quantifiable interface to an agent epistemological state regarding the world. 
For example, if 1 robot out of 100 suffered power problems then we could say 
that our belief that this robot would suffer power problems is 0.01.    
Probability can also be used in decision-making where it is treated as the 
expression of an agent’s judgement of how possible an event is. Probability in 
this context represents a decision not an estimate of errors [5]. Combined with 
utility, probability can be used to construct decision networks where various 
decision paths are plotted and assigned preferences that describe their 
usefulness to the decision-maker, and where the likelihood of each path is 
expressed in terms of probability. Thereby, the decision-maker can find the 
path that results in the maximum utility [6]. In addition, probability is used to 
model noise and random processes in digital communication systems to 
minimize the rate at which the receiver wrongly guesses which state the 
transmitter has actually sent. The likelihood of an outcome with respect to the 
sample mapped into a function of time represents the random nature of a 
process [3, p. 303].  
An extensive amount of research and literature is available on the 
statistical modelling of noise and the probabilistic representation of 
uncertainty. Moreover, researchers have suggested various approaches on 
how to quantify uncertainty. The purpose of this thesis is to find an optimal 

 
Introduction 
4 
 
 
 
approach of dealing with decision-making under uncertainty when little 
information is available to the decision-maker at the time of making the 
decision. We will look into the objective of this thesis in the next section. 
1.1 
Motivations and aims 
 
The main purpose of this research is to enhance the current procedures of 
designing decision support systems (DSSs) used by decision-makers to 
comprehend the current situation better in cases where the available amount 
of information required to make an informed decision is limited. It has been 
suggested that the highest level of situation awareness can be achieved by a 
thorough grasp of particular key elements that, if put together, will synthesize 
the current status of an environment [7]. However, there are many cases 
where a decision-maker needs to make a decision when no information is 
available, the source of information is questionable, or the information has yet 
to arrive. For example, consider a nurse in a public health centre who is 
responsible for admitting and assigning patients to be seen either by a doctor 
or a nurse. The assignment to a doctor should be based on a higher severity 
condition of the patient’s symptoms relative to that of an assignment to a 
nurse. Since some patients might overstate their symptoms to be admitted to 
a doctor and thereby a better service, or conversely, they may understate their 
symptoms out of fear. Therefore, the nurse cannot be certain about the 
severity of those patients’ illnesses. 

 
Introduction 
5 
 
 
 
In timely critical decision-making, the availability of information might 
become a curse rather than a blessing, as the more information is available 
the more time is required to process it. In time critical situations, time is an 
expensive commodity not always affordable. For instance, consider a surgeon 
performing cardiac surgery. With all the new advances in monitoring 
equipment and medical laboratory tests, there would too much information to 
account for before the surgeon could decide on his next “cut”. A DSS could 
help reduce the amount of information by converting it into the bigger picture 
through summarizing.  
In the aviation industry, large aircraft often contain redundant measuring 
equipment. The accuracy of the navigation system can be verified by 
comparing the readings from two different equipment groups. For instance, an 
accurate altitude can be assumed when the altimeter reading of the pilot’s 
panel is identical to that on the flight officer’s panel. Otherwise, a search for a 
defective component is initialized, which, in turn, might involve manual 
procedures, such as switching to alternative air data, or observing the status 
of the altimeter for visual defection cues, such as a fluctuating pointer [8]. 
However, manual observations require the pilots to be in a high state of 
situational awareness where they would be able to comprehend the states of 
the aircraft, and in turn, make reasonable decisions. This would defeat the 
purpose of a DSS (or redundant measuring equipment), as they are supposed 
to raise pilot’s situational awareness instead of the other way around. 
The work in this thesis was particularly applied to the problem of validating 
equipment readings in an aircraft, flight data analysis, and real-time monitoring

and prediction of patients’ states in intensive care units (ICU). Each 
application will be discussed further in the upcoming chapters. However, the 
author feels it is necessary to introduce some basic notations and background 
topics before the main theory is introduced. 
1.2 
Decision Support Systems 
DSSs is an umbrella term applied to any computerized system used in 
aiding making decisions in an organization [9, p 14]. One of the earliest 
definitions of DSSs comes from Keen and Morton in 1978, where [9, p. 12]: 
Decision support systems couple the intellectual 
resources of individuals with the capabilities of the 
computer to improve the quality of decisions. It is a 
computer-based 
support 
system 
for 
management 
decision makers who deal with semi-structured 
problems. 
Classically, the process of designing a DSS was classified into three 
categories: structured, unstructured, and semi-structured [9, p. 11]. Structured 
DSSs are those that involve a straightforward decision-making process where 
standard procedures exist to make the required decision; for example, 
processing a new order in an online store. Unstructured DSS is where the 
problem of coming up with a decision is often complex, fuzzy, or has no 
standard solutions, for example, buying new software for processing 
documents in a firm. Finally, semi-structured DSSs are in-between cases, 

 
Introduction 
7 
 
 
 
where part of the decision-making process can be structured but others 
cannot. An example is selecting the best car insurance.  
With respect to the application that has driven the design of a DSS, DSSs 
are 
classified 
into 
model-driven, 
data-driven, 
communication-driven, 
document-driven, and knowledge-driven [10]. Model-driven DSSs are those 
that simulate, optimize, and/or manipulate a process. They use parameters 
and/or rules provided by experts to aid decision-makers in the process of 
analyzing a situation and thereby come up with a more optimized decision/s. 
As the capabilities of computers dramatically grew, model-based DSSs grew 
in complexity and started to provide wider ranges of options, optimisability, 
and decision routes. Conversely, data-driven DSSs are designed to support 
better access and manipulation of a company’s internal (or even external) 
data. They could be as elementary as a web-based query tool or as complex 
as real-time access and analysis of a huge data warehouse. Communication-
driven DSSs use state-of-the-art communication technologies as a media to 
facilitate better collaboration and communicational-based decisions. Some of 
the commonly used communication technologies are video conferences, 
internet newsletters, and computer based bulletin boards. Document-based 
DSSs emphasize the accessibility and/or manipulation of documents from 
normally huge databases. As the World Wide Web grew in size and more 
documents became available, document-based DSSs became the main 
platform for usage in document searching and retrieval. Knowledge-based 
DSSs (Kb-DSSs) have the capability of recommending an action to a 
decision-maker rather than a passive analysis and/or accessibility, as with

previous types of DSSs. They usually use expert knowledge or artificial 
intelligence optimized to solve problems within a specific domain. One 
example is computer-based medical diagnosis tools. The overall aim of this 
thesis falls within the domain of Kb-DSSs.

To approximate the ways experts make a decision, several frameworks 
have been suggested to model human information processing. Simon’s three-
phase paradigm of intelligence [11] is one of the earliest. Simon’s model is a 
conceptual model that, software-wise, can easily be implemented [12]. The 
model consists of three phases: intelligence, design, and choice (Figure 1) 
[11]. The first phase is a reconnaissance phase, where a decision-maker 
starts by collecting various cues from a situation, and then collects 
FIGURE 1. The three-phase paradigm of intelligence 

 
Introduction

information, detects opportunity, and comprehends the main drives behind 
them. The second phase is where the intelligence collected previously is used 
to model the problem/opportunity. The decision-maker would develop 
relationships between events motives and/or drives behind the situation at 
hand and in turn set up criteria that links his systematic model to expected 
results and their desired utilities and possible alternatives to an action. Finally, 
the decision-maker would apply his model along with the collected intelligence 
to produce an action or a list of actions summarizing the next course of 
action/s. An extra step would be a reflection phase, where the decision-
makers evaluate the effectiveness of their model and come up with 
suggestions for the next cycle of decision-making, where they develop 
confidence and expertise in the process of decision-making and start the 
actual implementation plan [11]. In the next section, we briefly present the 
process of making choices under uncertainty, which characterizes the second 
step of the Simon’s three phases of intelligence.   
1.3 
Choice under Uncertainty 
When a decision-maker decides on which type of computer to buy for an 
office, the output of his choice is always certain and determined in the sense 
that if computer type A is bought, then computer type A is what the decision-
maker will get. This is because the choice of the decision-maker mainly 
influences the outcome of the decision. However, there are many cases where 
unforeseen events that the decision-maker cannot be sure of influence the 
outcome of a decision. For example, imagine that a gambler would gain £100 

 
Introduction 
11 
 
 
 
if the outcome of a dice roll is 6 and £75 if the outcome is 5 or 4, but would 
lose £100 if the outcome is 3, 2 or 1. The gambler cannot be certain of the 
output of the dice roll because many factors affect, and thereby determine 
which face of the dice is going to face up, and these factors are out of his 
hands. In such a situation, the gambler needs to make his bet while remaining 
uncertain of the output of his dice roll. It is evident to assume that the gambler 
would have different preferences to each possible outcome of the dice roll. For 
instance, he would not want to roll 3, 2, or 1 since he would lose £100 but 
would prefer to roll 4, 5, or 6. As mentioned in the Introduction, combining 
preferences (or utility) with probability is the basis of our modern 
understanding of decision theory.  
The earliest recorded attempt to combine probability with preferential value 
to make a choice was that of Blaise Pascal in the seventieth century in his 
famous Pascal wager [13]. Pascal argued that the expected value of making a 
choice giving n possible choices with values {v1, v2,….,vn} and probabilities 
{p1,p2,…pn} is given by:  
   ∑    
 
 
 
(1) 
In 1728, Nicholas Bernoulli challenged this notation that a decision-maker 
needs only to consider expected value in what is now known as the St. 
Petersburg paradox [14]: 

 
Introduction 
12 
 
 
 
Suppose someone offers to toss a fair coin 
repeatedly until it comes up heads, and to pay you 
$1 if this happens on the first toss, $2 if it takes two 
tosses to land a head, $4 if it takes three tosses, 
$8 if it takes four tosses, etc. What is the largest 
sure gain you would be willing to forgo in order to 
undertake a single play of this game? 
Since the probability of getting heads on the first toss is ½, the probability 
of getting heads on the second toss is ¼, and the probability of getting heads 
on the nth toss is  1/2n, the expected value can be estimated using Equation 1 
as: 
    
      
        
          
   
     
     
(2) 
The results of Equation 2 suggest that a gambler should accept the bet no 
matter what entry price is set for that game as the expected payoff is always 
higher, in fact, it is infinite. However, it is obvious that only few, if any, rational 
decision-makers would consider paying any amount of money to enter such a 
game. Gabriel Cramer and Daniel Bernoulli proposed the solution to this 
paradox by noting that a gain of $2 is not necessarily twice as useful as a gain 
of $1 [14]. They introduced the notion of expected utility function U(.) and used 
it to access a gambling situation rather than the expected value. In this 
context, the utility of a choice becomes the multiplication of its odds by its 
utility. The utility of a choice considers many factors other than the financial 
outcome of it. For example, the amount of wealth and resources that the 
decision-maker currently possesses and is willing to risk, the concept of the 

 
Introduction 
13 
 
 
 
diminishing marginal utility of money, i.e., U($2n) < 2U($n), and whether there 
a casino willing to offer such a gamble exists. With the expected utility 
principle in mind, we can rewrite Equation 1 as: 
   ∑      
 
 
 
(3) 
where U(n) is the utility of choice n. Assuming that the current wealth of 
the gambler is W, the sure gain ζ of the gamble of the previous example is 
[14]: 
     ζ   
           
             
      
        
(4) 
For example, if we assume a natural logarithmic utility function and that the 
gambler’s wealth is about $1,000, then the sure gain will only be about $5.94. 
Despite the fact that the utility function has solved one of the classical 
paradoxes in decision theory, it does not tell us much about how to model 
preferences of a decision-maker. In economics, the utility function of 
consumers is modelled under the assumption that their preferences are 
consequentialist, that is, that consumers are indifferent to two compound 
gambles if they can be reduced to the same simple gamble; and continuity, 
that is, the utility of gamble A is higher than gamble B even when the 
probability of a new gamble C is added to gamble A [15]. However, research 
into the expected utility modelling is much more involved than the scope of

this thesis and is sometimes controversial [16]. In addition, the expected utility 
principle would only work if the probability distribution of choices is known. 
This is also one of the main criticisms of Bayesian probability [17].

Overview of thesis structure 
 
This thesis is organized into six chapters. It started with a brief introduction 
to the aims, motivations of the thesis and DSS outlined in chapter 1. Chapter 2 
is an introduction to the theory of probability which overviews the 
combinatorial calculus, probability theory and its results, Bayesian networks 
and decision-making within the framework of Bayesian Networks.   
Chapter 3 details the analysis of various interpretations of probability. It 
sets the objectives for the wining interpretation and finally presents the 
proposed approach to comparative probability which will be used in the 
following chapters. 
Chapter 4 is the first application of the developed algorithms. It starts with 
brief introduction to aviation safety. It gives two applications of the proposed 
algorithms to aviation safety. Chapter 5 is the second application of 
comparative probability. The application will be to ICU patients. Once more, 
we will show two applications of comparative probability to monitoring and 
analyzing patients states in ICU.

Finally, chapter 6 concludes the thesis with reminder of the objectives of 
the thesis and how they have been met. In addition, it outlines potential 
opportunities and future work which made possible following the results of the 
research in this thesis.

2.  Bayesian Artificial 
Intelligence  
The main objective of this thesis is to establish a framework for making 
decisions when little information is available to the decision-maker without 
resorting to the common mistake of extracting knowledge from ignorance. We 
have already seen in Chapter 1 that probability is the basic foundation of 
representing and quantifying uncertainty. In this context, we could think of 
probability as an intermediate domain between events and actions. In 
addition, the importance of probability to scientists and engineers is so 
obvious that it requires no further explanation or listing of examples. Finally, 
we saw that probability is an aspect of reality in the realm of quantum physics. 
However, many references, be it books, journal papers, or lecture notes, 
devise their own abbreviations, symbols, and nomenclature to represent 
various quantities and terms in probability theory. Therefore, it would only be 
reasonable to introduce a common notation that we will consistently refer to 
throughout the course of thesis. However, as probability theory is far more 
detailed than being summed up in one chapter of a thesis, referring to the 
references mentioned throughout the context of this chapter is recommended.  
This chapter will walk through the basic concept of counting to advanced 
concepts in probability to Bayesian networks and their applications. It starts by 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
17 
 
 
 
discussing the principle of counting and the basic notations of combinations 
and possible outcomes of experiments. Then it moves to probability theory 
from unconditional to conditional and joint probability distributions for both 
discrete and continuous variables. Having introduced probability theory, 
Bayesian network is discussed along with their importance as probabilistic 
graphical model of joint probability distribution and their role in decision-
making. Finally, chapter two concludes by brief discussion of learning 
Bayesian networks structures from examples.  
2.1 
The principle of counting 
In combinatorial analysis, counting refers to the way of finding the number 
of possible outcomes of an experiment or a series of experiments that 
somehow are related together. One formulation of the principle of counting is: 
“Suppose that two experiments are to be 
performed. Then if experiment 1 can result in any 
one of m possible outcomes and if for each 
outcome of experiment 1 there are n possible 
outcomes of experiment 2, then together there are 
m×n possible outcomes of the two experiments 
[18, p. 2]” 
For instance, suppose that ice cream either comes in a cup or a cone and 
the available flavours are chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Since the shape 
of the ice cream can be regarded as experiment 1 with 2 possible outcomes 
and the flavour of it can be noted as experiment 2 with 3 possible outcomes, 
the overall number of outcomes of both experiment 1 and 2 is: 2×3=6. One 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
18 
 
 
 
could express the relationship between experiment 1 and 2 in terms of a tree 
diagram. The tree diagram helps understand the relationship between the two 
experiments. See figure 2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The principle of counting can be generalized to more than two 
experiments. If an amount of r experiments are performed and the possible 
outcomes of experiment 1 were n1, the possible outcomes of experiment 2 
were n2….and the possible outcomes of experiment r were nr, then the overall 
number of possible outcomes is: n1×n2×…×nr [18, p. 3]. Each possible 
outcome in counting is referred to as a permutation. Although the principle of 
counting is very powerful, every so often we require a quick way of calculating 
the number of possible groups of r objects that can be arranged from a total of 
n objects. For example, a player in a word game may be interested in knowing 
how many permutations of 3 letters are possible out of the 10 letters he is 
holding. Since the first letter holder can contain any of the available 10 letters 
and the second letter holder can have any of the remaining 9 letters while the 
third one can hold any of the lasting 8 letters, it follows that the overall number

of permutation is: 10×9×8=720.  However, this result assumes that the order 
of arrangement is relevant, that is permutations like ABC, BCA, BAC are 
accounted for. When the order of arrangement is irrelevant, then the overall 
number of permutation should be divided by the number of times the same 
letters are repeatedly re-arranged. In this case, it amounts to 3×2×1. In 
general, the number of possible combinations of r objects out of n objects 
where the order of permutations is not relevant can be expressed as [18, p. 6]: 
( 
 )  
  
         
(5) 
Equation 5 is also referred to as the binomial coefficient because it plays 
an important role in binomial theorem [18,p. 15]. However, what if we are to 
divide the n objects into r distinct and non-overlapping groups? Since the 
groups are distinct and non-overlapping, and using the principle of counting, 
we can find [18,p. 11]: 
(
 
     …   
)  
  
      …     …

2.2 
Basic concepts in probability 
In this section, we will explore probability theory from its basic concepts to its 
greatest results such as the central limit theorem and the strong law of large 
numbers. However, probability theory is far more detailed and complex 
subject to be fit in a section of a thesis. Hence, most of the concepts 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
20 
 
 
 
introduced here are as brief and abstracted as they could be. The main 
purpose of this section is not to introduce concepts that can be found in every 
first course book about probability but to establish consistent notation and 
reference basis upon which the main theory of this thesis can be build.   
2.2.1 Events, sample space and their relationships 
The word probability comes from Latin probabilis which means to that may 
be proved.  It was also used in Shakespeare’s Histories to mean worthy of 
acceptance or belief  and having an appearance of truth [19]. However in 
modern everyday usage, it is used to refer to the degree of certainty that an 
event will occur [20,p. 15]. For example, the weather cast may indicate that 
there is a low probability the weather will be sunny during the next week in the 
North West of England. On the other hand, the theory of probability deals with 
quantifying and weighing of evidences and the likelihood of events. The 
probability calculus was proposed in the 17th century by Fermat and Pascal to 
tackle the problem of uncertainty in the outcome of gambling games [21,p. 6]. 
Later on, it was realized that probability calculus can also be applied to 
characterize ignorance. Probability became the very corner stone of science 
and weighing scientific observation that Bishop Butler considered it “the very 
guide to life” [21,p. 6].  
If the output of an experiment cannot be deterministically estimated 
beforehand, then we might overcome that by deterministically estimating all 
the possible outcomes of the experiment. This is often referred to as the 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
21 
 
 
 
sample space and denoted by the Greek uppercase letter Omega (Ω) 
whereas an outcome or subset of outcomes of the experiment is called an 
event and usually denoted by the Greek lowercase letter Omega (ω) [1,p. 
484]. For example consider the case of dice toss. Since an ordinary dice has 
six faces labelled 1 to 6, the possible outcomes, or sample space, of the 
experiment will be: 
    , , , , ,   
(7) 
If the dice landed with side labelled 6 facing up then the event is 
represented as ω = 6. As previously discussed in the principle of counting 
section, we are sometimes interested in calculating the likelihood of an event 
when more than one experiment is performed. For instance, consider if we 
have two dices rather than one and they were tossed simultaneously. In this 
case the sample space of events is [18,p. 25]: 
     ,     ,    , , , , ,   
(8) 
Where i denotes the side label of the first dice and j denotes the side label 
of the second dice. Hence (i,j) denotes one event from the sample space Ω. 
Let the experiments of tossing two dices separately be regarded as E1 and E2 
and event in experiment E1 and E2 is denoted as ω1 and ω2, then we define 
the new event ω1   ω2 is the event that either ω1 or  ω2 has occurred. This 
new event is referred to as the union of ω1 and ω2. Furthermore, the event 
that both ω1 and ω2 has occurred is denoted as ω1   ω2 and referred to as the 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
22 
 
 
 
intersection of events ω1 and ω2. The union and intersection of two events can 
be generalized to any number of events such as n to: 
      ⋃  
 
   
 
(9) 
for the union of events ω1 to ωn and to: 
      ⋂  
 
   
 
(10) 
for the intersection of events ω1 to ωn. The compliment of an event ω is 
defined as all the events over the sample space Ω where ω will not occur and 
is denoted by ωc. If the subset of events described by ω1 is also included in ω2 
then we say that  ω1 is contained in ω2 which is usually denoted as ω1    ω2 
[18,p. 26]. When a subset of events such as ω1 is contained within another ω2 
then the occurrence of ω2 implies the occurrence of ω1. Such consequential 
relationship plays an important role in reasoning and thereby in decision-
making. On the other hand, if the subset of events in ω1 is exactly that of ω2, 
then the two events are equal and denoted as ω1 = ω2.  The various 
relationships between events are usually expressed graphically by the so 
called Venn diagrams [21,p. 6]. In Venn diagram, a subset of events is 
represented in terms of closed shapes and the logical relationships between 
them are represented by symbolic intersections among these shapes. Figure 
3 shows some of the previous relationships represented in Venn diagrams.

2.2.2  Unconditional Probability 
 
Consider an experiment in which a fair 6 faced dice is tossed. Since the 
dice hasn’t been tampered with as to land on one of its edge, the dice should 
land on any one of its faces. We can express that in more abstract way by 
saying the outcome of a fair dice toss experiment should be any event from 
within the sample space defined as {1,2,3,4,5,6}. No matter how many times 
the same experiment is repeated, it’s only intuitive that the result is always 
some value from within that sample space and that it is impossible to have an 
outcome that is 7, 9 or any other value that is not part of the sample space. 
Since we often express such intuitive in terms of probability, we might say that 
we are 100% sure that the experiment will result in any value of the sample 
space and 0% sure that it will result in any value outside that. If we normalize 
the percentage of our confidence and express the two mentioned intuitive 
expectations, we will get:

(11) 
and 
         
(12) 
If the dice were biased in a way as to land with its side labelled 6 facing up, 
then, on average, we expect the event ω = 6 to take place more than the 
others. But as the dice is assumed fair, it is again intuitive to assume that each 
event within the sample space is as likely as the others. If we label the 
probability of occurrence of event ω as P(ω), then: 
                                   
(13) 
Let us use the mathematical + sign to denote the probability of a union of two 
events such as ω1 and ω2, and using equation (11), we can write: 
                                      
(14) 
Since every event in (14) has the same probability, then: 
                                        
(15) 
Although equations (1) to (6) were derived intuitively, they are part of our 
modern understanding of probability which is build upon the basic three 
axioms of probability hence called axiomatic probability [18,p. 26]. The three 
axioms of probability, also known as Kolmogorov axioms state that [21,p. 6]: 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
Usually, the probability of an event  is defined from a relative frequency of 
occurrence [18,p. 29]. In an experiment with a sample space of     which is 
repeated for n number of times under the same conditions, if an event like   
occurred      times during the course of performing the previously mentioned 
experiments, then we define      as: 
         
   
    
  
(17) 
Therefore, the probability of an event is the converging limit of occurrence 
of the event as the reptilian of the experiment approaches infinity. The 
assumption that the probability of an event should converge to some value 
can be considered as another axiom of probability or as a result of the 
previously mentioned axioms  [18,p. 29]. Nonetheless, the axioms of 
probability can be used to derive other relationships such as the following: 
 
Axioms of probability (16) 
Axiom 1: 
 𝑃 Ω     …    .      
Axiom 2:

𝑃 𝜔    …     .

However, if our everyday world is deterministic, that is similar causes will 
result in similar effects, then shouldn’t an experiment performed with the same 
conditions always lead to the same results? Where would the uncertainty in 
estimating the outcomes come from? Unquestionably, we would be uncertain 
about the output of an experiment if its initial condition cannot be guaranteed 
to be the same or if the slightest change in the initial condition will result in a 
butterfly chain of effects. On the contrary, this is not the assumption of the 
relative frequency definition of probability. One way to answer this paradox is 
to note that the previous definition of probability doesn’t convey a proposition 
about reality but rather about logical possibilities.  An experiment assumed to 
be carried out under the same condition is to assume that it favours no one

outcome over the others. Hence, a probability proposition asserts how 
logically possible an event would be if no other prior information is known. 
This type of probabilistic assertion is called unconditional, or prior, probability. 
The estimation of the conditional probability of an event require no more than 
knowledge of the sample space and no knowledge about the outer world is 
necessary.  As soon as information about the actual world has arrived, 
conditional probability becomes invalid. Therefore, the likelihood of an event 
needs to be reassessed in light of the new information. The likelihood of an 
event in the presence of prior knowledge of the experiment is called 
conditional probability.  
2.2.3 Conditional Probability 
In philosophy, Kant distinguished between two types of judgements: 
analytical and synthetic judgement [22]. Analytical judgement deals with the 
way concepts and ideas are connected but it tells us nothing about the state of 
affairs in the actual world. Its truth requires nothing more than knowing the 
actual meaning of a concept or an idea, whereas synthetic judgements are 
those that their truths cannot be inferred without information about the actual 
world [23]. Hence, unconditional probability doesn’t tell us anything about the 
actual world for it requires no knowledge about it other than the breadth of the 
sample space. If the unconditional probability of having a head in a coin flip is 
0.5 then that shouldn’t be considered what will happen in real coin flip 
experiment. Unconditional probability is an analytical judgement about 
possibilities not actualities.  

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
28 
 
 
 
Therefore, if the likelihood of an event in an experiment is to be estimated, 
information about the state of affairs surrounding that event should be 
gathered. When a condition of an experiment is known, then unconditional 
probability becomes void and a way to incorporate the new condition into the 
calculation of the event probability needs to be implemented.  
Suppose that two ordinarily dices are to be tossed sequentially. If we know 
that the output of the first toss is 6, then how we are to incorporate this 
information into the estimation of how likely it will be to get an outcome that 
both adds up to 8 when the second die is tossed.  We reason as follows: since 
the first dice roll is known, then there are only six possible outcomes out of the 
second experiments (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6). In addition, there 
is only one way of getting an outcome of 8 namely (6,2), therefore,  the 
conditional probability of the outcome 8 giving that 6 have occurred from the 
first dice roll is  1/6. In general, we define the conditional probability of event ω 
giving that evidence (or condition) e has occurred as [21,p. 7]: 
   |          
    
 
(16) 
where    |  is called the conditional probability of ω giving that e has 
occurred. Equation 16 is also known as the product rule of probability written 
usually as [1,p. 486]: 
           |

It is of value to note that conditional probability satisfies all the three 
axioms of probability given in equations 16 [18,p. 102]. Some important 
theorems of conditional probability are given below [21,p. 8]:

2.2.4 Independence and conditional independence 
In the previous section, we saw how the introduction of new information could 
affect the likelihood of an even in an experiment. However, not every change 
in state of affairs will result in a consequential update of the probability of an 
outcome. For example, the likelihood of obtaining a head when a fair coin is 
flipped doesn’t change if we knew that the previous flipped resulted in a head 
or tail because the output of the first experiment doesn’t change the number of 
combinations which the second experiment can result in. When the outcome 
of an event like ω1 has no affect on the estimation of the likelihood of another 
event like ω2, we say that ω1 and ω2 are independent (also marginal 
independent or absolutely independent) [1,p. 494]. The independent of two 
variables can be expressed as: 
    ,                 
(21) 
and for any number of events such as ω1 to ωn:  
    ,   ,  3, …                …       
(22) 
On the other hand, two events may seem to be dependent on a third event but 
the conditional probability of them does not seem to change when the 
likelihood of the third event is altered. For example, the likelihood of cloudy 
sky will increase dramatically if the sky is raining. Similarly, the likelihood of 
low temperature would increase if the sky is raining as well. Both the events 
cloudy sky and low temperature depends on the presence of rain. If we have 
no information about the condition of the sky, then looking at the thermometer 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
31 
 
 
 
will alter our belief about the possibilities of the current weather. On the other 
hand, if we already know that it is raining, then looking at the thermometer 
wouldn’t make more certain about the presence of clouds. That means that 
the two events: cloudy sky and low temperature are independent giving the 
event rainy sky. If we represent the event cloudy sky as ωcloud, low 
temperature as ωtemp, and rainy sky as ωrain, then [1,p. 498]: 
                               |

and: 
                               |       
(24) 
2.2.5 Bayes Theorem 
Bayes theorem is an extension of the product rule of probability giving in 
equation 18 [1, p. 495]. It connects together the conditional probability 
between two events with its inverse. Despite its intuitive and simple nature, it 
has massive consequences on the interpretation of probability, approach to 
epistemology, hypothesis testing, and inductive logic [24]. It also forms the 
cornerstone of modern probabilistic reasoning in artificial intelligence, it is 
given by [1, p. 495]: 
    |         |         
     
 
(25) 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
32 
 
 
 
Bayes rule comes in handy in cases where we have information about the 
probability of an effect giving some cause and we would like to estimate the 
likelihood of the cause when the effect at presence. This is particularly useful 
in diagnosis-wise flow of inference where we have symptoms and the most 
likely causes are to be inferred.   But the real value of Bayes rule is that it 
shows how the likelihood of an event is updated as new evidences becomes 
available which is useful in inferring the likelihood of a hypothesis over 
another. It tells us that the likelihood of hypothesis y giving evidence x is equal 
to its likelihood times its prior probability before evidence x became available 
conditioned by the likelihood of evidence x itself. This process is referred to as 
conditionaliztion [21,p. 12].  
Another application of Bayes rule is the subjective process of learning. In this 
context, learning is viewed as the a continuous process of updating believes 
about the likelihood of a state of affairs as new information is acquired [24].  
For example, experience can alter our certainty about the truthful of previously 
held proposition. Bayes rule can also help eliminate irrational favourism such 
as the case with the principle of the weak evidence. It states that if an 
evidence like e with probability of P(e) does not increase the likelihood of a 
hypothesis (like h) over another (like h*) and h was more believable than h* 
then any new information that serve to strengthen P(e) will maintain a higher 
likelihood of  h over  h* [24]. 
Although Byes rule is used widely in different disciplines ranging from 
philosophy to statistics to artificial intelligence, the concept of probability as a 
subjective belief is a controversial one [21,p. 12] that gets many philosophical 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence

and research framework going in past years and years to come.  We will 
introduce the application of Bayes rule in artificial intelligence in the next 
section.   
2.2.6 Random Variables 
Often, a gambler is not interested in the mere outcome of the two dice roll but 
rather the numerical sum of the number rolled, or in case of coin flip, the 
number of times of obtaining a head out of three repeated experiment. In 
process quality control, we are more interested in quantifying the number of 
times  the output is above or within a certain range [25,p. 115]. In all these 
cases, the interest is on a certain function defined over the sample space of 
an experiment. Such function is often referred to as a random variable or a 
stochastic variable [18,p. 132]. The value of a random variable can be 
evaluated using the combinatorial calculus discussed earlier. For instance, the 
probability that sum of two dice rolls will be 10 can be calculated by counting 
the number of combinations where the sum of the two dice numbers is 8, 
namely: (6, 4), (4, 6), and (5, 5). Since there are 36 possible outcomes from a 
two dice roll, the probability of obtaining a sum of 10 is: 
            
     
   
(26) 
A variable described by function over the sample space can be classified as 
either discrete or continues. A discrete random variable is that in which the 
function that defines it results in a finite number of possibilities such as the 
sum of two dice rolls which can be any of the group {1,2,3….12}, or an infinite 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
34 
 
 
 
series of separate values such as the group of integer numbers.  On the other 
hand, a continues random variable is that where its function can assume any 
possible value within a certain range or multi ranges of values [26].  
Random variables obey the three axioms of probability and there 
values should sums up to 1. Usually an uppercase letter is used to denote a 
random variable and lowercase to denote a generic value of a random 
variable such that for the random variable X which has k discrete values [20,p. 
20]: 
∑          
 
   
 
(27) 
where xi is the i-th value of the random variable X. Usually the probability 
function of a random variable, also known as the Probability Mass Function 
(PMF) , is presented in terms of a two dimensional graph. The x-axis of the 
graph is usually used to denote the range of values of the random variable 
whereas the y-axis is preserved for the corresponding probability value of that 
variable [18,p. 138]. Figure 4 shows the probability mass function of the sum 
of a pair of dice [27,p. 61]. 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
35 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4. P(x+y) is the mass probability function of a pair of dice 
 
Another way of representing a random variable function over a space sample 
is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) which describes the probability 
that a random variable falls below a given value or simply the sum of all 
probabilities of the mass distribution function where it is less than or equal to 
some value like x [28]: 
          ≤     ∑    
    
 
(28) 
where        is the cumulative distribution function of the random variable X 
when x = xi. Since a CDF is essentially a sum of probabilities lying under a 
certain value, it is a cumulatively increasing function which starts always with 
a value of zero and ends with 1, and                     [29,p. 5]. Figure 5 
shows the   cumulative distribution function of probability mass function of a 
pair of dice rolls.

  One important and central concept in probability theory is the expected value 
of a random variable [30,p. 148]. The expected value of a random variable is 
defined as the weighted average of all the possible values in the sample 
space. Usually denoted by uppercase U, the expected value of random 
variable (X) is defined as [31,p. 127]: 
      ∑    
 
   
    
(29) 
For example the expected value of fair dice roll is: 
            
     
     
     
     
     
   
  
(30) 
The expected value represents another idealized concept in the frequency 
interpretation of probability just like the definition of probability itself [31,p. 
127]. Therefore, the expected value of a random variable doesn’t have to be a

directly measurable or even possible quantity that exists in the sample space. 
For example, the expected value of a dice rolls fond earlier as: 7/2 is 
impossible. From the point of view of the frequency interpretation of 
probability, it represents the ultimate average of the samples that the 
experiment should converge to when the observation is infinitely repeated. 
Since the ratio of observing an event such as ω from the sample space Ω 
would converge to P(ω) and that is true for all ω, then it follows that the 
average of observing  ω is [18,p. 141]: 
∑    
 
   
           
(31) 
The expected value of a function of random variable can also be calculated by 
noting that that function has a mass distribution function as the random 
variable has. If we designate that function as g(X) then the expected value of 
g(X) is [18,p. 145]: 
         ∑       
 
   
    
(32) 
Although the importance of the expected value of a random variable, it does 
not some up all the properties of it. For example, we may be interested in 
knowing how wide the variable spread around the average.  The spread of the 
probability distribution function, commonly denoted as the variance, is 
important in process control as it gives indication on whether the process is 
still under control or becoming uncontrolled [25]. The variance of a random 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
38 
 
 
 
variable can also help measure the representation power of the average. If the 
variance is high then the average doesn’t quite represent the data because it 
would imply that there are wide gaps between observed events [32]. If the 
variance is small then it means that the events are similar to each other. The 
variance of a random variable is given by [18,p. 149]: 
               ∑           
 
 
              
(33) 
where      is the variance of X and   is the variable mean. For example the 
variance of a fair dice roll is: 
                              
    
    
   
(34) 
The square root of the variance is commonly known as the standard deviation 
(designated by the Greek letter σ). Not all random variables are discrete but 
there exists many examples that are continuous, for example, the 
measurement of a resistor value or the lifetime of a light bulb. Both are 
examples of measurements that result in uncertainty as to what the real value 
would be. In this case, we define the probability density function of the random 
continuous variable X over the sample space       ,    as f(x) and the 
probability that the random variable X will be within the set of real numbers B 
as [18,p. 205]: 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
39 
 
 
 
       ∫      
 
 
(35) 
The continues probability counterpart to the discrete one should also abide the 
three axioms of probability. Therefore, the area under f(x) should always add 
up to 1, that is:  
       ,     ∫
      
 
  
   
(36) 
Hence the cumulative distribution function of the continuous random variable 
X is:  
      ∫
      
 
  
 
(37) 
Using equation 29, the expected value of the continuous random variable X 
can written us: 
     ∫
       
 
  
 
(38) 
 In addition, if g(x) is a function defined over the continuous random variable 
whose probability distribution function is given by f(x), then the expected value 
of g(x) is given by: 
        ∫
          
 
  
 
(39) 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
40 
 
 
 
Finally, the variance of the continuous random variable whose probability 
distribution function is given by f(x) is given by equation 33. 
One of the most important probability distribution functions is the normal 
distribution function (also known as Gaussian distribution[20,p. 28]) pioneered 
by the French mathematician Abraham DeMoivre in 1733 to estimate the 
probability of binomial random variables and was later extended by Laplace 
and others [18,p. 218]. The normal distribution function is a one having a 
mean of μ and a standard deviation of σ is: 
     
 
√    
           
⁄
 
(40) 
The Gaussian distribution function is a bell shaped curve with a peak at μ. 
Figure 6 shows a typical Gaussian distribution function. The importance of the 
normal distribution function is that it gives a theoretical support to the practical 
notation of the behaviour of some continuous random variables such as the 
height of a person and it is considered one of the two greatest results of 
probability theory1 [18,p. 218].

2.2.7 Joint probability distribution 
In many scientific experiments which involves statistical measures, there are 
more than one random variable to be measured over the same sample space 
[34,p. 49] , for example, the pressure and volume of a gas, the resistance and 
temperature of a resistor, or the height and weight of a person.  So far we 
have only introduces probabilistic concepts with regards to only one variable. 
In this section, we will briefly introduce basic concepts of bivariate 
distributions. 
Let X and Y be two random variables from sample space Ω, we define the 
cumulate joint probability of X and Y by [18,p. 258]: 
   ,        ≤ ,  ≤                 ,     
(41) 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
42 
 
 
 
The distribution of both of X and Y can be derived from the joint probability of 
them which, in addition, could be used to answer all statistical enquiries about 
the joint probability of X and Y [18,p. 259].  Equation 42 gives the distribution 
of X and Y in terms of their joint probability [34, p. 50]. 
          ≤       ,         …     
          ≤       ,          …     
(42) 
If X and Y are both continuous and their joint probability distribution (or 
density) function is f(x,y), then the joint probability of X and Y, written as 
P(X,Y) is [18,p. 261]: 
   ,    ∬   ,          
(43) 
hence the joint cumulative probability distribution function f(x,y) is [18,p. 262]: 
   ,    ∫∫   ,        
 
  
 
  
 
(44) 
Therefore, the joint probability density function is the second derivate of 
equation 44 given by: 
   ,    
  
         ,    
(45) 
 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
43 
 
 
 
  Previously, we have discussed the independence of two events and their 
corresponding conditional probability. It will be only natural to make the same 
inquiry regarding the independence of random variable. Let X and Y be two 
random variables. If x and y are any two sets of real valued numbers, then X 
and Y are independent when [35,p. 305]: 
   ,                
(46) 
The cumulative joint probability distribution function of X and Y follows by 
appealing to the three axioms of probability [18,p. 267] which will yield [35, 
p.307]: 
   ,                
(47) 
Using equation 46, the conditional distribution of X given Y and Y given X can 
be derived as [35, p.308]:  
    
⁄           …     
    
⁄           …     
(48) 
Equation 39 which gives the expectation of a single continuous random 
variable can be extended to the case of a function such g defined over the two 
joint random variables X and Y as [36,p. 141]:  
     ,      ∫∫
   ,      ,

2.2.8 Central limit theorem 
The term central limit theorem traces back to a paper published by George 
Pólya back in the 1920s titled “Central Limit theorem in probability theory” and 
has been used since then [37, p. 1]. However, it was the result of the 
successive work of three of the most brilliant mathematicians of the eighteenth 
century: Abraham de Moivre, Simon Laplace, and Carl Gauss [38,p. 29]. 
Nowadays, the central limit theorem refers to an umbrella of statements that 
describe the convergence of some probability distribution functions of single or 
many random variables [37, p. 1].  The importance of the central limit theorem 
in probability theory comes from its diverse application and its ability to explain 
some of the widely used distributions such as the normal distribution  [38,p. 
29].  
The first and the simplest limit theorem is the Markov inequality which tells us 
how likely a sample deviates from the mean. In addition, it applies to any 
random variable even those whose their distribution is unknown [39,p. 187]. If 
X is a random variable that can only take positive values then for any x larger 
than 0 [18,p. 430]: 
   ≥  ≤     
 
 
(50) 
However, Markov inequality is not always useful because if         then all 
it tells us is that    ≥   is less than a number larger than 1 which is an 
obvious statement as all probabilities are less than or equal to 1[39,p. 187]. 
Markov inequality is a generalization of Chebyshev’s inequality which works 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
45 
 
 
 
for both positive and negative numbers. It is one of the most famous 
inequalities in probability theory and Chebyshev’s best work [40,p. 75]. 
Equation 51 gives a mathematical formation of Chebyshev’s inequality for 
random variable X which has a mean of μ and variance σ2 for any value of 
k>1 [18,p. 431]: 
  |   | ≥  ≤   
   
(51) 
Another importance of Markov’s and Chebyshev’s inequalities comes from the 
fact that when it is not always possible to know the distribution of the variable 
but rather its mean and variance, they can be used to set bounds on 
probabilities around the mean  [18,p. 431].  
The most important generalization drawn from Chebyshev’s inequality is the 
weak law of large numbers [18,p. 433]: 
 
 
   
    
 
The weak law of large numbers shows how the practically calculated 
probability through experiment is more likely to diverge from the theoretical 
one proposed by the frequency interpretation of probability [38,p. 19].  
The weak law of large numbers (52) 
If X1, X2, … are random variables each with identical probability distribution function

P (|
X1+X + +Xn
 
 μ| ≥ε)    as      

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
46 
 
 
 
As previously mentioned, the most important result of probability theory is 
the central limit theorem [18,p. 434]. It simply tells us that averages (or sums) 
of n independent and identically distributed random variables each with mean 
of μ and variance of σ2 tend to come close to a Gaussian distribution as n 
becomes boundlessly large [41,p. 47]. Hence, providing a theoretical 
framework to explain why many natural statistical phenomena have a bell 
shaped distribution. It also gives theoretical framework that deals with 
measurement errors by proposing that they should have normal distribution, in 
fact the central limit theorem was used to refer to as the law of frequency of 
errors in the seventieth and eightieth centuries [18,p. 442]. The central limit 
theorem in a very simplistic mathematical form, that is: for a single random 
variable only) is given by [18,p. 434]: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, there are examples of superimposed independent effect that 
lead to non-normal processes [42,p. 28].  Although the existence of such 
process seem at first glance to invalidate the central limit theorem, careful

Bayesian Artificial Intelligence

analysis of such processes shows that they posses infinite variance  which 
places them outside the applicability of the central limit theorem [42,p. 28].   
The strong law of large numbers states that, with perfect certainty, the 
averages of a sequence of random variables each with similar distribution will 
converge to the mean of the distribution [18,p. 443]. 
 
 
 
 
 
The strong law of large numbers shows that the averages of repeated 
experiments should converge to their expected value. For example, if a game 
of coin head or tail is repeated infinitely, then the proportion of heads or tails 
will be ½ with undutiful likelihood. Jacob Bernoulli was the earliest 
mathematician to prove the law of large numbers [43,p. 79].  Bernoulli was 
interested in developing mathematical tools to help make good decisions in 
civil, economic, and moral issues. He thought that by proving the strong law of 
large numbers, the relative frequency of observation can be a corner stone on 
which such decisions can be established [43,p. 79].  
There are many other famous inequalities in the inventory of probability 
theory that deals with various situations or help simplify others such as the 
one-sided Chebyshev inequality [44,p. 70], Jensen’s inequality, and Chernoff 
bounds. These are beyond the scope of this section which was mainly to

provide consistent mathematical background to establish the discussion of 
Bayesian networks in the next section and in chapter 3.  Reference [44] gives 
quick introduction to them.  
2.3 
Bayesian Networks 
 
We have seen in the previous section that all it takes to answer any 
statistical query about a random variable is knowing its probability distribution 
function or the joint probability for more than one random variable. However, it 
is not always possible, or practical, to obtain the full joint probability of some 
random variables. In addition, the size of the joint probability table in the case 
of discrete variables will increase dramatically as the number of random 
variables increases not to mention the required computation power for 
processing. For example, if a sample space has n variables each with only 
two possible outcomes, then the joint probability table will have 2n entries [1,p. 
493]. If a process requires 20 variables in order to be fully described and, for 
simplicity, each can have either of a binary state, then the joint probability 
table size is 220=1,048,576 entries. Processing such table size could be 
impractical assuming it was possible to calculate each entry in it. We have 
also seen that with independence and conditional independence, we can 
simplify some probabilistic queries by careful analysis of the relationship 
between the variables.  It will be of great value if we could exploit this fact as 
to reduce the amount of calculation required to produce a joint probability 
distribution or to produce a more compact version of it. 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
49 
 
 
 
Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent joint 
probabilities in way that emphasize statistical relationships between the 
random variables of a sample space [20,p. 51].  Bayesian Networks allow us 
to re-present probabilistic queries in a manner that flexibly reduce the amount 
of calculation and prior knowledge required to obtain the answer.  
In this section, we will introduce key concepts and principles of Bayesian 
Networks and their role in statistical inference, making decision under 
uncertainty, learning and representation of knowledge, and dynamic update of 
belief with time. 
2.3.1 Basic Bayesian Network Structure 
A Bayesian network graph consists of nodes and arrows. Nodes are usually 
oval shapes that designate a variable whereas the arrows show the 
relationships between the variables. In order for the Bayesian Network 
representation to become superior to joint probability representation, the 
number of arrows has to be as minimum as possible. Otherwise, if the arrows 
were drawn such as to connect every variable to all the others, then the graph 
will become equivalent to a joint probability table. The usual way of drawing 
the arrows is to think of the casual relationship between the variables. In this 
context, an arrow is drawn from variable X to variable Y if the presences of X 
leads to Y. Casual relationships between the parameters are not to be strictly 
understood as real causal relationships but rather as implications or also 
known as statistical causality [45]. For example, suppose that a doctor has 
noticed that one of his patients is suffering symptoms of short breath (also 
known as Dyspnoea). The doctor knows that short breath can be the result of

lung cancer which, in turn, can be the result of pollution or smoking. She also 
knows that cancer can be identified with an X-ray. If the X-ray turns out 
positive result then Cancer is the cause of the patients symptoms but if turns 
out negative then it might be the result of some other causes such as 
bronchitis or tuberculosis [21,p. 30]. She also knows that the X-ray imagery 
result is not 100% trustworthy and that smoking is one contributor to lung 
cancer among others. Hence, she assigned prior probabilities to the 
trustworthiness of an X-ray machine, pollution, and smoking.  In addition, she 
estimated the conditional probability of developing cancer giving that a patient 
is a smoker and having cancer when the patient is a polluted environment. 
With this information in mind, the Bayesian Network graph would look like the 
one in figure 7 [21,p. 31].

The advantage of Bayesian Network over joint probability table is clear 
from figure 7. The directions of the arrows tell us about the way evidences and 
observations flow throughout the graph and in turn how probabilities should be 
updated accordingly.  Since there are no direct arrows between the node: 
Smoking and X-ray unless through the node: Cancer, then Smoking and X-ray 
are conditionally independent giving Cancer. This result makes sense when 
we recall the definition of conditional independence discussed in the last 
section. If the patient has been already diagnosed with cancer, then knowing 
that he is a smoker would not affect our confidence level with regards to the 
result of X-ray imagery. Similarly, Dyspnoea and X-ray are conditionally 
independent giving Cancer. In general, two variable are conditionally 
dependent if they are connected through a converging node and their 
probability would change if new evidences are added to the descendent node 
or either one of them [45,p. 8]. The requirement that no hidden connections 
between variables exist apart from those shown in the graph is called the 
Markov property [21,p. 33]. It is not necessary for Bayesian Network to adhere 
to Markov property but then the graph won’t be optimal that is there will be 
redundant arrows that connect independent variables together. When the 
number of connections between the variables are so compact that no further 
reduction is possible, the graph is called an I-map (short for independent map) 
[21,p. 33], otherwise it is a D-map (short for dependent map). Graphs that are 
both an I-map and a D-map are called the perfect graphs [21,p. 33]. With all 
these little inferences regarding the statistical relationships between the 
variable, the estimation of any probabilistic query will be much simplified.  

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
52 
 
 
 
It is normal to describe Bayesian Network graphs with the aid of 
metaphors. For example, the node which results from another is called a child 
and the latter node is called a parent [21,p. 32]. A node is an ancestor of 
another if it appears before that other and the latter is called its descendent. 
The top node which is a child of none is called root whereas a node with no 
children is called a leaf.  Markov Blanket is defined as the current node 
parents and children and the parents of its children [21,p. 32]. For example, 
Cancer is a parent of X-ray which is a leaf. Pollution and Smoking are roots 
and parents of Cancer. Markov blanket of Cancer is Pollution, Smoking, X-ray, 
and Dyspnoea.  
2.3.2 Types of reasoning 
Since a Bayesian network graph is essentially a simplified alternative way 
of developing the joint probability distribution of some random variables, it can 
also used to answer all statistical queries as the case with an ordinary joint 
probability table. Usually, we refer to that process as reasoning and classify 
them into four types [21,p. 34]. 
Figure 8 shows the four types of reasoning with application to the 
example shown in figure 7. For drawing clarification reasons, nodes names of 
figure 7 are reduced in figure to only their first letter so that the node Cancer is 
now only C. Figure 8(a) shows the first type of reasoning available through 
Bayesian network. The direction of reasoning for this mode is from results or 
effects to causes. Thus, it is referred to as diagnostic reasoning [21,p. 34]. For 
example, If the patients X_ray turns out to be positive, then the probability that 
the patient has lung cancer will increase because lung cancer has an effect on 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
53 
 
 
 
the expected details of an X-ray image. Figure 8(b) shows the case where we 
have evidences that the patient is a smoker. Since there is colouration 
between smoking and lung cancer, we may infer that the patient will develop 
symptoms of lung cancer. The direction of inference in this case is predictive 
as it is project the state of thing into the future. In figure 8(c), the patient is 
assumed to have diagnosed with lung cancer. In such case, the likelihood that 
the patient is a smoker or lives in a polluted environment will increase. If we 
acquire evidence that the patient was a smoker, then that would explain his 
disease and in turn reduce the likelihood that he have developed it due to 
pollution. This form of reasoning is known as explaining away or intercasual 
[21,p. 35]. Not all queries can be fit in a diagnostic, predictive or intercasual 
fashion as the network can be queried at any node with any type of available 
evidences. Such type of reasoning is called combined reasoning [21,p. 35] 
and example of it is shown in figure 8(d). 
Evidences are another term for the arrival of new information which 
could in turn be uncertain. For example, new evidences on the Polluted node 
can be an unconditional probability of how likely the patient has been exposed 
to pollution. Similarly, new information could arrive in terms of the conditional 
probability of detecting cancer in an X-ray image giving that the patient has 
developed a cancer. This kind of uncertain evidence is referred to as virtual 
evidence or likelihood evidence [21,p. 35].

2.3.3 Inference in Bayesian Networks 
The aim of any probabilistic network is to calculate the resultant, or 
posterior, probability on a given node(s) when evidences are available on 
other(s) [21,p. 53]. Usually, inference in Bayesian networks is either exact or 
approximate [21,p. 53]. The criteria for choosing which type of reasoning to 
adopt depends on the number of nodes in the network and the complexity of 
its interconnection [21,p. 53]. This section will briefly introduce key concepts of 
both reasoning types with application to the lung cancer example of figure 7. 
To unify the notation of queried nodes, evidences, and others, Uppercase

letters will be used to designate queried node such as X,P, or S, and 
lowercase letters to designate a specific evidence at a node such as x,p, or s. 
Since a Bayesian network (BN) is a representation of joint probability 
table. Each node in a BN is represented by a conditional probability with 
regards to its parents and the multiplication of these together gives the joint 
probability table of the network as shown in equation 55 [1,p. 513] 
    ,   , … ,     ∏                 
 
   
 
(55) 
 
 If a node is a root, that is, it has no parent, then the unconditional 
probability is used instead of the conditional probability in equation 55. Hence, 
the joint probability of the lung cancer patient of figure 7 is given in equation 
56.  
   ,  ,  ,  ,       |     |     | ,            
(56) 
Exact methods or algorithms use the joint probability representation of 
equation 55 and probabilistic relationships to compute posterior probability 
giving the availability of evidences on some nodes [1,p. 523].  For example, if 
the probability that the patient of figure 7 has cancer giving the availability of 
X-ray image and smoking status is to be calculated, then a procedure such as 
the following can be used: 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
56 
 
 
 
   | ,       ,  ,   
   ,    
(57) 
Equations 57 make use of the product rule given in equation 18. Let 
       ,    be a normalization factor, equation 57 can be rewritten as: 
   | ,        ,  ,    
(58) 
The joint probability table of the nodes C,X, and S can be obtained by 
summing terms from the full probability table of all the nodes [1,p. 523]. 
Hence: 
   ,  ,    ∑∑   ,  ,  ,  ,   
 
 
 
(59) 
Where  ,   is the sample space range of P and D respectively. 
Substituting equation 59 in 58, we get: 
   | ,     ∑∑   ,  ,  ,  ,   
 
 
 
(60) 
Finally using the full joint probability representation that we obtained 
through the Bayesian network graph in equation 56, we can rewrite equation 
60 as: 
   | ,     ∑∑   |  
 
 
   |     | ,            
(61) 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
57 
 
 
 
Equation 61 can be enhanced further by noting that some terms are 
constant with regard to one or the two summations. The term      is constant 
with regard to both summations can be moved towards the far left end and the 
term      is constant in regards of the second summation over d. Hence, 
equation 61 becomes: 
   | ,          ∑    ∑   |     |     | ,   
 
 
 
(62) 
Such simple reducing observations can minimize the amount of 
computation power required to calculate the required query which can in turn 
be evaluated by looping through the two summations and multiplying the 
corresponding conditional probability tables entries on the go [1,p. 523]. Such 
tables need to be given prior to making any queries along with the 
unconditional probabilities of the root nodes. This approach is known as 
inference by enumeration. For a network with Boolean  nodes, the complexity 
of calculation can be as high as        [1,p. 523].  
Researchers have proposed several methods to reduce the amount of 
calculations required to answer queries from a Bayesian network. For 
instance, Kim and Pearl’s message passing algorithm works by performing a 
query in three steps: firstly the probability, or belief, of any node that its 
parents or children have received new evidence is updated, secondly the 
node calculates messages about the new evidence and send them to its 
parent in a bottom up propagation, thirdly the node computes a predictive 
factor and send it to its children  [21,pp 57-59]. The attractive feature of the 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
58 
 
 
 
Kim and Pearl’s message passing algorithm is that everything is performed 
locally using the idea of estimating messages that reflects the availability of 
new evidences and their impact on the neighbouring nodes. As the number of 
parents connected to a node increases, the computation requirement of 
messages passages increases, in turn, as more cycles are required to update 
the status of the network [21,p. 61]. Alternatively, the variable elimination 
algorithm aims at reducing the amount of repeated calculations by saving 
them for later use [1,p. 524]. It starts by evaluating terms in a bottom up 
fashion, or in the case of equation 62, from right to left order, then as each 
term in equation 62 is a function of some variable and constant parameters, 
the portion of calculations that is variable independent is computed first and 
stored as cache complete further computations that are variable dependent 
[1,p. 524].  Once again, the amount of computation requirement of the variable 
elimination algorithm depends on the structure of the network and the amount 
of queries it is required to answer [1,p. 529]. It works best in networks where 
there is only one path connecting any two nodes which are known as singly-
connected, polytree or forest networks [21,p. 56]. The upper half of the lung 
cancer patient shown in figure 7 is an example of a polytree network. If the 
network has more than one path between any two nodes then it is referred to 
as multiply-connected [1,p. 528]. 
The clustering algorithm belongs to the family of exact Bayesian 
network inference [1,p. 528]. It aims at reducing the complexity of multiply-
connected networks by joining nodes together in order to transform a multiply-
connected network to a singly-connected one. Figure 9 shows how that can 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
59 
 
 
 
be achieved. Figure 9(a) is a multiply-connected network which can be 
simplified into singly-connected network if nodes B and C are merged together 
to form node B&C shown in figure 9(b). Then the belief updating or the 
variable elimination algorithm can be applied to the result [21,p. 67].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, the transformation step might be greatly involved if the network 
is highly interconnected. Consequently, the amount of memory requirement 
for the transformation will also increase [21,p. 67].  
An improved algorithm over the clustering approach is called the junction 
trees [21,p. 68]. It aims at increasing the efficiency of clustering through a 
methodological approach that starts by connecting all the parents together 
and removing their arrows pointers which produces the so called moral graph, 
then adding arcs to every groups of nodes larger than 3 which will result in a 
triangulated graph, then identifying the new merged nodes from the 
triangulated graph so as to produce a junction tree, and finally creating 
separators from the arcs that results from the intersection of adjacent nodes 
[21,p. 68]. As soon as the network is simplified, the algorithm proceeds to

calculate the new probability tables for the new combined nodes and then 
update the probabilities across the network by the message updating 
algorithm [21,p. 68]. Once more, the junction tree algorithm adds a substantial 
overhead to making queries through the transformation phase although it only 
needs to be done once. In addition, the new probability tables may have many 
entries that are simply zeros and thus takes occupy unnecessary memory 
[21,p. 69].  
In general, the exact inference approach in BN reduces the task of 
evaluating an exponentially increasing joint probability tables by dynamic 
programming or transformation. However, exact inference is still bound by the 
worst case scenario of an exponential performance such as the case with 
some Bayesian networks build to model pixels in an image [20,p. 336]. In 
addition, new challenges will be introduced to the exact inference approach if 
the network variables were continuous rather than discrete [20,p. 337]. 
Particularly, when the new joint probability tables are calculated.   
 The exact approach to inference in Bayesian network is usually used for 
small to medium sized network in which the number of nodes is up to about 
three dozen [21,p. 72]. For networks with higher amount of nodes or multiply-
connected network with high density of connection, an approximate inference 
should be followed [21,p. 72]. There are several approaches to approximate 
the inference process in Bayesian networks however the most common ones 
are those which depends on performing stochastic simulation such as the 
logic sampling methods [21,p. 72] also referred to as the direct sampling 
methods [1,p. 530]. In these methods, the network is used to generate cases 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
61 
 
 
 
based on random initiation of evidences, then the posterior probabilities of the 
child nodes are estimated from the direction of roots to leaves, finally the 
procedure are repeated while the estimated probability of the queried 
conditional probability, like P(X/E) is updated. In order to estimate the value of 
P(X/E), the number of cases where both X and E are true are counted and 
divided by the number of cases where only E is true. According the law of 
large numbers, the updated probability estimate should converge to the exact 
value [21,p. 72]. Equation 63 gives the mathematical formulation of how the 
approximate posterior probability is calculated [21,p. 72]: 
      |             ,     
           
(63) 
 
Hence the sampling methods become mathematically inefficient when  the 
chosen evidence is unlikely as some of the cases which do not contribute to 
the count of equation 63 will be discarded [21,p. 74].  In addition, the process 
of inference is directed, its power can mostly be observed in directed networks 
[20,p. 540].  
The performance of the direct sampling methods can be enhanced by giving 
more attention to cases that are more consistent with the evidences [1,p. 532]. 
One example of such approach is the likelihood weighting algorithm which 
arises from the importance sampling technique in statistics but modified for 
Bayesian inference [1,p. 532]. If the posterior probability P(X/E) is queried, 
then the evidence nodes E values are set as constant while the other nodes 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
62 
 
 
 
are samples as to generate cases, then each case is weighted by the 
likelihood of that evidence combinations [21,p. 74]. Although the weighting 
likelihood is more efficient than the direct sampling method, its performance 
will start to degrade as the number of evidences increase.  
Another simulation based algorithms is the Markov chain Monte Carlo 
simulation methods (MCMC). MCMC works not by randomly initializing every 
case and manually working out the posterior probabilities but rather by making 
some random changes to the current case so as to obtain the next case [1,p. 
535]. For example, the Gibbs sampling method works by an arbitrarily 
initialization of a case where the evidences are fixed at their observed values 
then the next case is obtained by applying random changes to one of the 
unobserved variables such as Xi which is then conditioned on the Markov 
blanket Xi [1,p. 536].  
There are many other approximate inference methods that don’t use the 
random case generation approach. For example, the search methods that 
instead of generated cases randomly, they try to pay more attention to cases 
with high likelihood. Therefore they don’t generate an unbiased posterior 
probability estimate but a good upper and lower bound [20,p. 540].  Although, 
sampling methods are widely used to make good approximate to posterior 
probability in many Bayesian networks configurations, their performance is not 
easy to expect. In particular with complex probability distribution where the 
estimate obtained from generating cases is considerably inaccurate [20,p. 
541].  

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
63 
 
 
 
In summary, although Bayesian networks provide simplified graphical 
representation of the joint probability table of some random variables, there 
are many instances where even the resulting joint probability is 
computationally expensive to query. Thus a need for better inference 
algorithms is justified and reflected by ever-active research efforts to reduce 
the time and computation power required to query a Bayesian network. In 
general, inference can be classified as exact and approximate. In the exact 
inference, the complex structure of the network is often reduced so as to 
obtain a new structure that is known to be more computationally efficient. 
Approximate inference relies on simulating cases so as to generate a large 
amount of samples that would converge to the value of the posterior 
probability resulted from exact inference. Exact and approximate methods can 
be combined together to obtain an algorithm  that mosaic-wise combine the 
features of the two [20,p. 541]. Finally, the performance of the two approaches 
is bounded by factors like the complexity of network, the amount of 
connections between nodes, the complexity of distribution and the likelihood 
of evidences. 
2.3.4 Dynamic Bayesian Networks 
The previous section has shown the advantages of Bayesian networks as a 
simplified graphical representation of the joint probability of some random 
variables defined over a given process. The resulting network can then be 
used to answer any probabilistic query given the availability of some 
evidences. For example, the BN of the lung cancer patient shown in figure 7 
can be used to estimate the likelihood of a patient having lung cancer giving 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
64 
 
 
 
that he/she is a smoker. However, the network assumes that all patients’ 
cases can be represented by the same variables connected together in a fixed 
structure fashion. This type of modelling is referred to as variable-based 
modelling [20,p. 199]. There are many applications where the process 
changes over time and we are more interested in capturing the dynamic 
behaviour of it. For example, in the case of inferring patients’ states in an ICU, 
the states of the patients change over time in a way that the next state 
depends on the current one and some observed variables that are samples at 
some time intervals such as heart rate, blood pressure and urine output. While 
an ordinary BN can model the relationship of current patient state in terms of 
some observed variables, it fails to capture the dynamic nature of how that 
state evolves over time and, in turn, fails to represent the distribution of the 
patient’s state over time. In addition, there are other classes of problem where 
the structure changes with every case. Consider, for example, the modelling 
of a genetic inheritance.  In this case, each family has its own members which 
in turn have their own variables [20,p. 199].  Nonetheless, the way in which 
genes are inherited is the same for every family [20,p. 199]. This calls for a 
better way of representing dynamic processes then a mere variable-based 
fashion such as Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). DBNs are models that 
work as templates to represents the temporal dynamics of an entire class of 
distribution in a compact way [20,p. 199]. The basic assumption of a DBN is 
that the world consists of successive temporal snapshots where each one has 
some random variables which are either observed or hidden [1,p. 567], and 
that the way the system evolves over time, called transition model, depends 
on a fixed number of previous states so as to prevent the transition probability 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
65 
 
 
 
between the current and next state from becoming infinitely unbound [1,p. 
568]. This assumption is known as the Markov assumption and the process 
that satisfies it is known as Markov chain [1,p. 568]. If the next state in a 
temporal transition model depends only on the previous state, then it is called 
a first order Markov chain whereas if it depends on the previous two states 
then it is called second order Markov chain [1,p. 568].  The set of system 
states at a given time instant like t is often designated as Xt and the set of 
evidences as Et [1,p. 567]. Thus the transition model of a first order Markov 
chain can be expressed as [1,p. 568]: 
    |            |      
(64) 
Whereas the transition model of a second order Markov chain can be 
expressed as [1,p. 568]: 
    |            |    ,       
(65) 
 
In addition, the transition model is assumed to be fixed over time. That is to 
say the temporal-based conditional probability is constant regardless of the 
current time. Using the chain rule of probability, the temporal joint probability 
distribution of a Markovian process can be expressed as [20,p. 201]: 
             ∏    + |     
   
   
 
(66) 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
66 
 
 
 
The Markov assumption can be further extended to the case of evidences. 
Evidences, or observed variables, may also depend on previous variables as 
well as the process states. However, careful modelling of the process states 
would make it suffice to generate the observed variables entirely so that the 
Markov assumption of the evidence, known as the sensory model, can be 
written as [1,p. 568]: 
    |    ,             |    
(67) 
Combining equation 67 with 66 yields the general template temporal model of 
DBN that satisfies the Markov property given in equation 68 [1,p. 569]: 
      ,            ∏    |     
 
   
    |    
(68) 
Equation 68 assumes that the evidences, or observations, start to arrive from 
time slice 1. Hence at time slice 0, there are no evidences to have a 
conditional probability and the only information available about the process is 
its unconditional probability which is an intuitive conclusion giving that the 
unconditional probability of a variable is its likelihood in the event of no 
available evidences. In addition, equation 68 shows that a DBN can be 
represented by three sub-models: the transition model     |      which 
structures the evolution of the process variables between the current and next 
time slice, the sensor model     |    that connects the current process states 
with the observed sensors, and the unconditional probability distribution of the 
process variables       [1,p. 591]. Hence, it is more convenient to only plot 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
67 
 
 
 
one slice of the DBN that shows the prior unconditional variables, the 
transition model, and the sensory model [1,p. 591]. Figure 10 shows a DBN 
representation of patient monitoring in ICU. 
 
 The state variables are shown as oval shapes whereas evidences are shown 
as circles. For simplicity, the state of the patient (denotes as S) can either be 
true or false. A true state indicates that the patient is a live whereas false 
indicates that the patient is deteriorating. The sensory model consists of three 
variables: heart rate (H), blood pressure (B) and oxygen saturation (O). The 
probability tables are filled with arbitrary values to serve as a demonstrating 
example of how it would look like. Although, figure 10 only specifies the 
sensor probability table of the heart rate sensor, the remaining tables follows 
the same structure of the heart rate probability table. As similar to the sate 
variable, the sensor conditional probability table can assume any of two 
states: beating or non-beating. The event of patient deteriorating while the 
heart rate sensor is still showing beating is assigned a probability of 0.1 to 
emphasize the likelihood of sensor failure. It represents the simplest modelling 
of a sensor  failure commonly known as the transient failure model [1,p. 593].

It makes it possible to distinguish between nonsensical sensor reading due to 
sensor failure and reliable readings. If the predicted likelihood of non-beating  
heart rate sensor state giving all the past patient states is much less than the 
probability of transient sensor failure then the best explanation of the previous 
event is that the sensor has failed [1,p. 593]. Equation 69 gives a 
mathematical criterion of detecting the event of heart rate sensor failure at 
time slice t: 
               |                       |         
(69) 
While the transient model helps smooth out the recorded history of sensor 
readings by removing the less probable ones according to equation 69, it still 
fails in cases where the failure is persistent [1,p. 593]. For example, if the 
heart rate sensor lead attached to the patient is disconnected. In order for the 
DBN to accommodate persistent failure, a persistent sensor model needs to

be developed where the sensor itself will have a hidden state that would be 
interpreted using the available evidences. If the state of a sensor is 
designated with a prefix of (Is), the DBN of figure 10 can be expanded to that 
of figure 11 which introduces three new states describing the conditions of the 
sensors.  
Inference in DBN can also be classified as exact or approximate and the 
same techniques used to query an ordinary BN can also be used with a DBN 
[1,p. 595]. However, the basic models of figures 10 or 11 need to be 
replicated, or unrolled, until it fits the present amount of observations [1,p. 
595]. Figure 12 shows the unrolling of figure 10 to time slice 3 where the three 
observations nodes are combined into one node for simplicity of drawing. 
There are many inference techniques proposed by researcher to reduce the 
amount of computations required to accomplish the task of probabilistic 
querying. Reference [20] discusses some of them in more details.

2.3.5 Decision networks 
In order to make good decision under uncertainty, two factors need to be 
known; i) the likelihood of every possible outcome, and ii) the preferences of 
the decision-maker with regard to each of the outcomes. Bayesian networks 
provide a sound methodology to obtain the probability of outcomes as 
discussed in the previous sections. Combining Bayesian networks with 
preferences will give a powerful foundation of making decisions under 
uncertainty [21,p. 89]. As discussed in section 1.3, preferences are better 
expressed in terms of a utility function the maps an outcome to a numerical 
value that conveys a useful aspect of the outcome to the decision-maker. 
Once the utility function is defined, the expected utility of each decision is 
calculated by [21,p. 89]:  
    |   ∑    | ,   
 
    |   
(70) 
where     is i-th the possible outcome, A is the actions  for outcome  , 
    |   is the expected utility of each outcome when action A is made and 
    | ,    is the conditional probability of the i-th outcome giving the current 
evidences E and action A is made. The action with the highest utility is often 
selected if the principle of maximum expected utility is followed [21,p. 90]. The 
principle of maximum expected utility states that rational agents have a 
tendency to prefer the action that results in the maximum possible utility [21,p. 
90]. Decision networks may be expressed graphically by extending BN graph 
with decisions and utility nodes [21,p. 91]. Decisions, or actions, are often 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
71 
 
 
 
represented with a rectangular shape and the utility nodes with diamond 
shapes.  
For example, the BN for monitoring an ICU patient given in figure 10 can 
be extended by considering what decisions a nurse would make for every 
possible state of the patient and the utility of each decision. Since there are 
only two possible states for the patient: alive and deteriorating then the nurse 
may only make one decision which is to contact the doctor in case the patient 
is deteriorating and to continue monitoring otherwise. The expected utility of 
contacting the doctor has an effect on the next state of the patient so a second 
node should be added to simulate temporal relationship between the current 
state of the patient, next state and the undertaken action. The utility function 
itself is used to map the decision of contacting the doctor to a numerical value 
that reflects whether the decision led to the recovery of the patient or further 
deterioration, see figure 13.

The decision block A belongs to the class of actions known as 
intervening actions [21,p. 97]. Intervening actions are those actions that have 
an effect on the probability of the outcome of the network. In the case of figure 
13, making a decision to call the doctor would change the likelihood of the 
current state of the patient. Non-intervening actions are those which do not 
affect the probability of the system for example, betting in a gambling game 
[21,p. 97]. Although the decision network of figure 13 is very simple, it can be 
extended to include more than one decision in a sequential decision-making 
fashion such as to approximate what decision-maker would do in a course of 
actions. For example, the nurse may decide to make some test before 
deciding to contact the doctor to further confirm that the patient is really 
deteriorating. Such type of actions are referred to as test nodes [21,p. 98]. 
However, by the time the test is performed, it may be too late for the patient so 
a test node should be accompanied by a cost node. Similarly to the expected 
utility node, the cost node maps a cost-wise aspect of performing a test into a 
numerical value [21,p. 98]. A test has an effect on making further decision and 
can be regarded as evidences but it has no effect on the states of the process. 
Figure 14 shows a simple addition of a test node (T) with cost (C) that a nurse 
can undertake to confirm the readings of the ICU monitors. 
The dashed arrow between the test node (T) and the action node (A) 
shows which one should be performed first and is known as the precedence 
link [21,p. 98]. In order to evaluate the utility of each decision, the decision 
network is transferred into a decision tree model [21,p. 101]. Each possible 
outcome of an action or test is represented by a branch starting with the 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
73 
 
 
 
action/test that has the highest precedence and continue to divide each 
branch according to the possible actions/tests in the sequence of 
actions/tests, then the tree is further branched based on the possible 
outcomes of the states nodes and finally each ending leaf is weighted by its 
expected utility. Once the decision tree diagram is plotted, the calculation of 
the expected utility of actions follows from the bottom leaves where the utility 
nodes reside to the action/test node of the highest precedence by multiplying 
the value of the expected utility by its likelihood and then summing over the 
next branch until the root is reached [21,p. 103]. Once the utility of each 
decision is estimated, the one with the highest utility is selected if the principle 
of maximum expected utility is followed. Although analyzing the decision 
network through a decision tree seems appealing from simplicity point of view, 
it is computationally inefficient as it involves repetition of similar mathematical 
terms. It can be improved using the same techniques introduced in the

previous section for Bayesian network inference such as structure 
transformation and variable elimination [21,p. 104]. Decision nodes can also 
be added to a DBN so as to model the temporal evolution of actions through 
time and thereby creating a dynamic decision network (DDN). Figure 15 
shows how the decision network for monitoring an ICU patient of figure 13 can 
be combined with the DBN of figure 12.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The DDN of figure 15 assumes that the sequence of actions (shown as A1, 
A2 and An) starts after the arrival of the first evidence and that they have 
precedence from left to right as indicated by the dashed arrow. In addition, it 
assumes that the decision-maker is interested in the utility of making the first 
(n) sequence of evidences which is modelled by the inclusion of only one 
utility node after unrolling the DDN for (n) times. If a utility node is added to

each slice, then the measured utility will be the change in utility from between 
the previous and the current action [21,p. 110].  
2.3.6 Learning Bayesian Network 
Up until now, we have seen several approaches to answer probabilistic 
queries over some random variables and how, in turn, the results can be used 
to make decisions or even further queries. In addition, we have seen how to 
computationally reduce the requirements of performing a query through 
structure and variable transformations.  However, the availability of a model 
that fully describes the variables is assumed a priori. Such a model is not 
always available in the domain where a process is to be modelled [20,p. 697]. 
Firstly, it may be too much work to construct a model that describes a very 
complex process with hundreds of underlying variables or there can be no 
expert who fully understands the process to come up with a causal model that 
describes the interconnection between the inputs, system states, and the 
outputs. Secondly, the more the model becomes detailed and involved the 
more inflexible it gets because the model would need to be modified in order 
to fit another process within the same domain. Hence, an expert is needed to 
update the model every time the process changes or upgraded in some sort 
[20,p. 697]. Finally, the resultant model needs to be thoroughly tested with 
examples for the results are known but the accuracy of the model under 
circumstances where it was not fully tested would be unknown. However, 
there are many cases where we have an extensive amount of data that shows 
input-output or situations-results pairing that could work as examples derived 
from the distribution to be modelled [20,p. 697]. For example, a flight data 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
76 
 
 
 
analysis program normally has access to an extensive set of flight data 
recorded during the flight time of an aircraft, known as flight data recorder 
(FDR). If an anomaly occurred during the flight time of an aircraft, then an 
investigation will be initiated and the causes of the anomaly will be identified. 
In such case, the flight data analysis program has access to both situations 
and labels of the data that can be used to construct the probability distribution 
that describes the relationship between the FDR recorded variables at a given 
time instance and the normality/abnormality. Similarly, hospitals often have 
periodic tables that list the conditions of patients throughout their admittance 
to the hospital. A patient data may include several key variables that can be 
used to model the relationship between the current symptoms and the 
diagnostic suggested by a doctor.   
In this section, we will briefly introduce a common technique to learn the 
distribution of a process from sets of examples. This approach is generally 
performed to learn either the model underlying the variables or the probability 
distribution over them. In addition, a goal or a set of goals are defined to 
describe the end result of the learning process so as to measure the 
convergence of the learnt model to the data from the actual process [20,p. 
698]. 
Sewall Wright pioneered the work on using graphical models to make 
probabilistic inference in early twentieth century [21,p. 153]. His work was 
mainly focused on using linear models to represent casual representation to 
estimate the coefficients of such models in an approach that later became to 
be known as path modelling and gained extensive popularity in social science 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
77 
 
 
 
[21,p. 153]. In essence, the relationship between three variables such as X, Y, 
and Z in a linear model can be expressed as [21,p. 153]:  
          
(71) 
where a and b are coefficients that  determine the contribution of X and Y to Z 
and U is the amount of Z that could not be approximated by the linear model. 
Hence, equation 71 shows that X and Y are statistical causes of Z. This fact 
can, in turn, be used to construct casual models. A typical procedure to 
accomplish that would be to search for correlations among the variables, 
inventing a casual model that would explain the correlations between them, 
then use Wright’s decomposition rules to estimate the coefficients of the linear 
model and, finally, to test the model using some examples and measure the 
model accuracy [21,p. 160].  Wright’s decomposition rules are guidelines that 
relate the observation of correlation to the way the weights of the linear model 
coefficients can be estimated [21,p. 155]. However, in order to use Wright’s 
approach within the artificial intelligence realm, a computerized approach to 
inventing the casual models need to be developed. One realization of such 
approach is to observe conditional independence within the data. Conditional 
independence is the cornerstone that BN uses to reduce the amount of 
calculations needed to construct the joint probability tables of random 
variables. Thus, knowing that X is independent of Y giving Z would give us an 
idea of how to graphically represent the relationship between X, Y, and Z. The 
conditional independence learner algorithm is one example of such an 
approach [21,p. 161]. However, this leaves the question of how to know the 

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence 
78 
 
 
 
actual conditional independence between variables unanswered. The PC 
algorithm answers that question by the introduction of statistical significance 
test for conditional independence where independence is represented by the 
remaining correlation between two variables when a third is held constant,  
also known as vanishing partial correlation [21,p. 167]. Although these 
methods are developed for linear systems, they can be further extended to 
non-linear system by non-linear to linear transformation functions [21,p. 153]. 
Another approach to constructing casual network for discrete process is the 
Bayesian Metric (BM) [21,p. 197]. Rather than using statistical test and 
relationships, BM searches the casual model space using a metric conditional 
function like P(∙/e) or an approximation to it and looks for the best model that 
maximizes that function [21,p. 197]. There are many algorithms within the 
family of BM and reference [21, ch 8] lists and discusses them in a 
chronological order. 
2.4 
Summary 
 
This chapter serves as an introductory stage to the main theory of this 
thesis that will be discussed in chapter 3. Probability calculus is usually build 
upon the principle of counting and how to theoretically estimate the number of 
possible combinations of an experiment or a series of experiments. The 
probability of an event is the proportion of outcomes where the event occurs to 
the total number of outcomes.  The most important conclusions of our modern 
theory of probability are the central limit theorem and the strong law of large 
numbers.  

 
Bayesian Artificial Intelligence

All is needed to answer any probabilistic query in a process is the joint 
probability table, or distribution, over the process variables. However, 
construction of such a table is often not practical with processes that have 
hundreds of variables.  Bayesian networks are graphical representations of 
the joint probability table that greatly simplifies the computations required to 
make probabilistic queries. BN network can be integrated with preferences to 
construct decision network that helps simplify the process of probabilistic 
decision-making. DBN are template based representation of a process with 
emphasis on the dynamic evolution of variables over time. Finally, BN models 
can be achieved through data mining approach by using examples to 
construct the relationship underlying some variables or to estimate the 
probability distribution of the variables.

3.  Theory of Comparative 
Probability 
 
In chapter 2, we have seen how probability can be used to represent 
uncertainty and how, in turn, this can be combined with preferences to make 
decisions under uncertainty. In addition, chapter 2 briefly introduced the 
theoretical foundation of the frequency interpretation of probability and its 
relation to combinatorial analysis and well-known distributions such as the 
Gaussian or normal distribution.  It serves as an entry point to emphasise the 
importance of the joint probability distribution/table in answering probabilistic 
queries. More importantly, it contains a discussion of the use of BN to simplify 
the creation of a joint probability table and the construction of these networks 
in the light of the information age, where an extensive set of examples is more 
likely to exist for use in constructing a BN or estimating the probability density. 
However, the availability of examples may turn into a curse rather than 
a blessing because the amount of computational power and time required to 
process terabytes of information becomes impractical. In addition, the 
representation power of a probability density estimator for a process that has 
thousands of variables cannot be easily measured because there might not be 
enough examples to adequately profile the sample space. Moreover, many 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
81 
 
 
 
processes have extensive sets of examples that show one mode or a few 
possible modes of operation. For example, a web server access log would 
have many examples of normal behaviour for users connected and browsing 
throughout the sites hosted by that server, but the behaviour of a hacker trying 
to exploit the server is rarely covered by a typical sample from it. As another 
example, consider typical data extracted from the flight data recorder of a 
commercial 
aircraft 
during 
a 
normal 
flight 
between 
two 
airports. 
Unquestionably, these examples do not fully represent the normal behaviour 
of the aircraft equipment during normal conditions because there are many 
variables that would drastically change if the weather or the flight route 
changes. 
One way to tackle the problem of extensivity of information and save 
memory is to process the set of examples recursively on-the-fly. In such a 
scenario, the network would not have an offline period where it works out its 
internal structure while processing the given examples, but rather it will be 
available as soon as it is initialized and the first examples start rolling in. Some 
of these techniques can even evolve in the sense of being able to change 
their structure to better represent the data.  However, this approach leaves the 
issue of the representation power of the network during the transient 
initialization period unanswered because the amount of information available 
to the network may be sparse.  
The purpose of this thesis is to investigate similar conditions when an 
online system initialises and there is insufficient information to make a good 
decision. Furthermore, it examines the optimum initialisation values of the 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
82 
 
 
 
unconditional probabilities values without resorting to ad hoc assumptions or 
ignorance. If the assumptions made during initialising an online system are to 
be analysed, it is only logical to study the various meanings of probability and 
the relation of each to the availability of information. Therefore, a few 
background discussion points the need this to be made before we address the 
main theme of the thesis. 
Chapter 3 will introduce more focused probability topics and an 
interesting approach to representing knowledge. It first introduces various 
interpretations of probability and sets the requirement for the best 
interpretation to solve the main question of the thesis.  Then we will walk 
through the proposed interpretation, from its axioms to its advanced results. 
The chapter will conclude by introducing an innovative way to represent 
probabilistic knowledge, which combines the strong points and results of 
various probability interpretations and theories.   
3.1 
Interpretation of probability 
 
Consider a factory that produces cubes each having a side length of 
one unit. What will be the probability that a cube made by the factory has a 
side length less than or equal to ½? The answer to this question should be 
obvious from the principles of probability introduced in chapter 2. If the 
manufacturing process has a uniform probability distribution of cubes with side 
lengths between 0 and 1, then the answer is ½ [46]. If we change the 
description of the problem to finding the probability of a cube with a side area 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
83 
 
 
 
of less than or equal to ¼, then the answer would be ¼, assuming the same 
uniform distribution again. Surprisingly, both problems describe the same 
event because a cube with a side length ≤ ½ has a side area of ≤ ¼, yet the 
probability of the former is twice that of the latter. It becomes even worse if the 
same problem is described in terms of the volume, as the probability of a cube 
with a volume ≤ 1/8 is 1/8! The inconsistency described in this example is 
known as the Bertrand paradox [47,p. 77]. It highlights issues with the 
classical interpretation of probability. If the description of the random variables 
in a process is so vague as to lead us to assign different probability values to 
each possible way of describing them, then a decision-maker trying to assess 
a situation where the available evidence, or data, is not enough to clearly 
define its variables may fall into the same situation, resulting in different 
probability values for each different definition of the same situation. Therefore, 
the theory of probability needs to be re-investigated in hopes of finding an 
interpretation that better suits the situation of online learning or decision-
making based on sparse evidence.   
Interpretation of probability is the task of providing analysis of the basic 
concepts of probability or the transformation of informal concepts used during 
everyday use to formal ones suitable for scientific theorizing [46]. There are 
many interpretations of probability in the literature of philosophy and science, 
but they generally fall into one of the three categories: the objective 
interpretation of probability, the subjective interpretation of probability and the 
logical interpretation of probability [48].  Before any candidate from within 
these categories is analysed, a framework of assessment needs to be 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
84 
 
 
 
defined. The criteria help determine the adequacy of the interpretation to a set 
of standards.  The Kolmogorov axioms of probability may provide criteria for 
assessing a candidate, but these axioms can satisfy not only a probability 
system but a non-probabilistic system, as well, such as the volume of a 
sphere. In addition, the Kolmogorov axioms of probability do not tell us much 
about how to assign a probability to an event outside the boundary cases, 
where the probability of all possible events should be 1 and the probability of a 
void event is 0. Salmon proposed three criteria to investigate various 
interpretations of probability [49,p. 63]. Although they are intuitively simple, 
Salmon noted that it is surprisingly difficult to find a candidate that satisfies 
them all. His criteria are: 
a) Admissibility. This criterion ensures that a proposed interpretation 
adheres to the theory of probability and mathematics in general. It 
requires that the terms of an interpretation resolve the formal axioms of 
probability theory into true statements [49,p. 63].  
b) Ascertainability. This criterion requires the availability of methods to 
assess the value of a probability, because the probability theory would 
be useless without the ability to calculate probabilities of events [49,p. 
64]. 
c) Applicability. The interpretation of probability should be useful in the 
sense of being able to predict or to be used to assess some situation 
and have some bearing on which conclusions could be drawn. Its 
driving force is the famous Bishop Butler quote, “Probability is the very 
guide to life” [49,p. 64]. 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
85 
 
 
 
As stated earlier, there are non-probabilistic systems that satisfy the 
axioms of probability. For example, a cube of unit volume divided into several 
smaller cubes will satisfy the axioms of probability because the sum of all of 
these little cubes’ volumes is 1, the volume of the void cube (no cube) is zero 
and all cubes’ volumes are non-negative. In addition, the formal system of 
logic can satisfy the second criteria of ascertainability because the probability 
of a true statement can be regarded as 1 and the probability of a false 
statement as 0 [46], yet we do not consider formal logic as an interpretation of 
probability, although it is admissible, ascertainable and applicable.  
A better approach, at least for scientific-oriented minds, is to focus on 
applicability, the power of the interpretation in explaining common probabilistic 
observation, [46] and its prediction power. After all, the purpose of choosing a 
specific interpretation is to make good predictions in terms of rational choices 
and modelling the behaviour of a process.  
The classical interpretation of probability was championed by Laplace 
but can also be found in the work of Pascal, Bernoulli, Huygens, and Leibniz 
[46]. Estimating the probability of an event proceeds by breaking down events 
of the same kind into simpler events until they become equally possible; then 
the probability of the event is the ratio of the number of times it occurs to the 
number of all possibilities [49,p. 65]. Although chapter 2 referred to such 
probability as unconditional probability, it should be noted that the two are 
fundamentally different. Laplace does not use the frequency of appearance to 
estimate his probability calculation, but rather the sample space of events. 
That means the odds of heads in a coin toss and that of a yes answer in a 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
86 
 
 
 
wedding proposal are fundamentally the same, which seems absurd. If 
probability is to be the guide for life, then it must be estimated from life a 
posterior; not a priori. Furthermore, Laplace’s interpretation seems to draw its 
conclusion from ignorance, because in the absence of evidence to favour one 
event over the other, which he refers to as equally possible, then how we are 
to conclude that all events are equally possible and, in turn, what use is it as 
predictive tool? In addition, in a deterministic world, we would presume that a 
coin’s side would be determined by the initial conditions under which the coin 
was tossed. Therefore, how would two events be equally possible? Even if we 
artificially set up initial conditions that would favour no side of the coin over the 
other, would it not be more preferable to presume that the coin would land on 
its edge?  Finally, since the outcome: edge is a valid possibility, then there 
should be three possible outcomes, each with a probability of 1/3. It would turn 
out that we need to assign a highly absurd outcome the same probability as a 
normal or expected outcome. Clearly, we can conclude that the Laplace 
assumption—that during initial conditions and with no prior knowledge of the 
likelihood of outcomes, they should be assigned equal probability—will not be 
useful to answer the core question of this thesis.  
3.1.1 Objective interpretations of probability 
One important interpretation of probability that generalises the 
assumptions of the classical interpretation [46] is logical probability or 
probabilistic logic. The importance of the logical interpretation of probability 
comes from the fact that it can be used in science as a deductive tool to 
quantify the supporting power of evidence for a given hypothesis [50]. Hence, 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
87 
 
 
 
it is applicable to the field of artificial intelligence through the automation of the 
process of updating the likelihood of the truthfulness of a hypothesis in the 
light of new evidence. As opposed to the classical interpretation of probability, 
the logical view can assign different weights to different probabilistic outcomes 
and can accommodate evidence [46]. In order for the logical interpretation to 
be useful, the number of hypotheses should be limited and known, which is 
not always possible. Moreover, the probability of each hypothesis is initially 
assigned equal weight [49,p. 73], which seems as if it is utilizing the principle 
of indifference, but certainly not every possible hypothesis should be assigned 
equal probability because ignorance as probability is a measure of possibility, 
not ignorance [50]. Finally, the logical interpretation lacks the ability to adapt to 
new changes in evidence and hypotheses. For example, if the number of 
hypotheses increase or new features or outcomes are discovered then the 
degree of confirmation becomes void and needs to be re-initialized [46]. But, if 
the learning process needs to reinitialize every time we discover something 
new, then we are not updating our confirmation degree regarding the 
truthfulness of a hypothesis but rather measuring its likelihood using a fancier 
term than the mere classical interpretation of probability offers. 
As opposed to the analytical approach of the classical and logical 
interpretations of probability, there is a class of interpretation that regards 
probability as an objective property of things in reality. The frequency 
interpretation of probability introduced in chapter 2 is one example. From the 
frequency interpretation point of view, the probability of an event like A in 
sample space B should be estimated from its relative frequency of occurrence 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
88 
 
 
 
within B. The frequency of occurrence is estimated from experience, where an 
experiment is set up so as to randomly output events from the sample space 
B and the number of times that A occurs is recorded as the experiment is 
repeated indefinitely. The frequency interpretation is de facto in science 
because it can be estimated from empirical observations of some experiments 
and because it can express less frequent events in terms of lower numerical 
probability value. However, the very definition of the frequency interpretation 
of probability raises more issues regarding its suitability for this thesis. A major 
issue is the so-called problem of the single case [46]: what would be the 
probability of an event in an experiment repeated once or a few times? 
Consider, for example, a coin flipped once: The probability of heads will be 
either 1 or 0, depending on which side the coin lands on by mere chance. 
Moreover, if the experiment of flipping a coin is repeated a thousand times, we 
can still consider the one thousand flips as a single case [46], albeit a 
synthetic one, and we will be back to the problem of the single case again. 
Even if we assume the availability of an infinite series of experiments where a 
coin is flipped and the outcome is recorded, we will still arrive at different 
probability values as the order of outcomes is rearranged. In fact, the 
probability of heads could be made to converge to any value from 0 to 1 [46]. 
Finally, how should we deal with imperfections in the collected data? The 
frequency approach seems to assume that the data are a perfect replication of 
reality, which is a very crude assumption. In many cases, the gathered data 
are noisy, incomplete, or even nonsensical. Hence the estimated probability of 
an observation is by itself probable. It will be highly absurd and less useful to 
express the likelihood of an A as the probability of the probability of A. If 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
89 
 
 
 
probability is to be estimated in an objective fashion from a few examples, 
then we should not completely rely on an interpretation that does not work well 
under such circumstances.  
The other “horn” of the objective approach to probability is the 
propensity interpretation proposed by Carl Popper in 1959 [51]. Rather than 
considering the frequency of occurrence as the objective realization of 
probability, the propensity interpretation considers probability as a sort of 
disposition [52], that is, the coin has a tendency to land heads half of the time. 
That tendency is a natural property of the coin, even if it has not been flipped 
yet. Likelihood and chance are viewed as real properties of things that cannot 
be reduced to other properties or systematic set-ups [52]. All philosophical 
issues with the propensity interpretation put aside, it is unclear how to 
estimate the probability of an event and why would it be this value and not any 
other. For example, why does a fair coin land heads half the time? Why does 
this not occur one third of the time? Without a well-defined math for the 
propensity interpretation, it would be of less application to the field of artificial 
intelligence and, in turn, this thesis, although it may serve well to explain some 
mind-boggling observations in quantum mechanics.  
3.1.2 Subjective interpretations of probability 
Subjective interpretations of probability refer to the class of probability 
analysis that aims at rationalizing everyday notations of probabilistic 
statements. For the subjectivists, probability is an epistemic statement about 
reality that expresses a belief in the trustworthiness of statements rather than 
about properties of reality itself, as is the case with the objective prospective.

Hence, probability can be applied to single events. In addition, subjective 
probability can be applied even to deterministic outcomes because its 
statement does not convey chances in real world, but rather how much an 
agent believes a particular outcome will result [53,p. 2]. The main difference 
between subjective and objective probability interpretations is the attitude 
toward knowledge extracted from events. For example, the objectivist will 
describe the likelihood outcome of a biased coin flip as P(outcome) ≠  ½, 
whereas the subjectivist would continue to consider the outcome as  
P(outcome) = ½ because the subjectivist does not know the direction of the 
bias so as to favour one outcome over the other [53,p. 2]. In addition, the 
subjectivist would revise the probability assigned to a belief as more evidence 
is discovered about it, whereas the objectivist will assign a constant probability 
that does not change as long as the probability of the evidence stays the 
same. 
Bayesian probability is the well-established member of the subjective 
family of interpretations. Bayesian probability and its application were 
introduced in chapter 2.  Despite being subjective, Bayesian probability often 
relies on the frequency approach to estimate the likelihood of events [45]. That 
is because the quantification of an agent’s belief has to be rationalized in 
some way in order to be admissible and practical. Un-rational agents may 
believe in contradictory statements or assign high probability to impossible 
events or appeal to emotions or authority in their assessment of the truthiness 
of statements. Hence, the Bayesian probability calculus is not purely a 
subjective one, as the frequency counterpart is not a pure objective. An 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
91 
 
 
 
intensively loyal Bayesian would defend his position by emphasizing that 
rational agents should base their beliefs about the truthiness of a statement on 
the relative frequency of times it turns out to be true. But the requirement of 
having enough data to make rational beliefs about their likelihood leads us 
back to square one, as the purpose of this thesis is decisions based on little 
evidence.  
Terrance Fine in his magnum opus “Theories of Probability” gave 
another analysis of subjective probability based on the so-called comparative 
probability (CP) [54]. Comparative probability is a type of weak subjective 
interpretation of probability that rationalizes informal statements like A is at 
least as probable as B [54,p. 15]. This effort is by no means a new one 
because it was also proposed and defended by de Finetti [55], Savage [56] 
and Koopman [57]. However, for de Finetti, Savage, and Koopman, CP was 
the foundation from which the axioms of probability are derived [58]. Thereby, 
it serves as a more primitive entry point on which the modern theory of 
probability is built. On the other hand, Fine [54], Fishburn [59] and Keynes [60] 
proposed CP as an independent interpretation of probability, with its own 
axioms and calculus.  Although CP received less interest from scientists, 
statisticians, and engineers, Fine highlights the following benefits of the CP 
framework [54,p. 15]: 
1- CP results in a more pragmatic approach to random variables when the 
amount of information and data available are not enough to estimate 
the random variables quantatively.   

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
92 
 
 
 
2- There is more than one model to represent the probability in, as 
opposed to the strict one-model approach of the quantitative probability 
estimation.  
3- As is the case with de Finetti approach, CP has the benefit of 
supporting the Kolmogorov axioms of probability. 
4- CP naturally supports decision-making between other applications, as it 
describes probabilities in a qualitative way. 
The justification for 1 comes from the fact that CP offers more relaxed 
claims than the strict numerical values that the other interpretations have to 
come up with. For example, suppose a coin is flipped 10 times, which results 
in 7 heads and 3 tails. A frequentist has to assign the value 0.7 to the 
probability of heads and deals with the critics who may find the drift in results 
from the ideal case of ½, as if the coin was tampered with or more “flips” 
should have been carried out. A comparativist, on the other hand, may 
describe the event as heads are more probable than tails [54,p. 16]. As a 
result, CP seems more suitable to the situations this thesis aims at solving 
than any method discussed so far.  However, CP statements are qualitative in 
nature, which leaves the question of abstracting CP statements in a manner 
compatible with computers. A computer cannot directly deal with qualities like 
(is A > B?) unless A and B have numerical values. A computer should be 
equipped with an intermediate layer to transfer between the higher level 
qualitative description that CP offers and the quantative nature of computers.  
The ability of CP to describe the same event in more than one way gives us 
flexibility that many other methods can not. For example, we can describe the 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
93 
 
 
 
result of the coin flip given previously as heads are at least as probable as 
tails, which would be closer to the frequency interpretation. Point 3 would 
enable us to define formulas to transfer between the space of comparative 
probability and frequency-based probability. The benefit of having such 
transformation is that an algorithm that deals with extracting knowledge online 
should be versatile. For instance, it should be able to present the knowledge 
collected so far in a fashion understandable by frequency-based algorithms. 
CP does not need to replace the current model of probability but rather to help 
represent knowledge when little data is known and to continue to do so until 
enough data is available. This is when CP gets its queue signal to pass the 
control to the frequency-based probability calculations.   
This section discussed two approaches to the analysis of probability: 
objective and subjective. While the objective interpretation of probability is the 
de facto in science and even the subjective approach relies in its realisation 
on objective approach like the frequency interpretation, its performance is 
doubtful when little information is known about a situation. The comparative 
interpretation of probability seems appealing within the context of this thesis 
and will be discussed further in the next section. However, it should be noted 
that CP is a subjective probability approach and, therefore, it does not 
contradict the frequency interpretation of probability, because CP gives 
epistemological statements about reality that describe beliefs rather than a 
quantitative/qualitative representation of reality.

3.2 
Axiomatic Comparative Probability 
 
 
      
The task of analysing probability aims at formalizing everyday usage of 
probabilistic statements. In the context of comparative probability, there are 
usually binary statements that compare and contrast the likelihood of two 
events, like team A is more likely to win than team B, event C is at least as 
likely as D, or E is as likely as F. In everyday usage, a person may believe in 
statements that contradict one another or appear to be absurd in some 
situations.  The task of axiomising probability is the task of finding the very 
fundamental statements of probability that look as intuitive as possible, so that 
they do not raise any objections or contradict each other. Thereafter, all other 
probabilistic assertions should be built upon these statements.  For CP, the 
pursuit of axiomization should consider other important factors, such as the 
relationship to quantitative probability—in particular, the Kolmogorov axioms—
the usefulness of the axioms to generate predictable results that can be 
observed empirically, and the applicability to decision making and DBN [54].  
      
The notations for CP that will be used throughout this thesis 
follow those of both Fine and Fishburn [54, 59] but will also adhere to 
the notations of chapter 2. Let Ω be a sample space of finite outcomes 
labelled {ω1, ω2,…, ωn}, where ωn is the nth possible outcome, or 
subset of outcomes, from within the sample space  Ω, we denote the 
comparative relationship ω1 is at least as probable than ω2 as[54]: 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
95 
 
 
 
      
(72) 
the comparative relationship ω1 is as probable as ω2 as [54]: 
      
(73) 
and the comparative relationship ω2 is not as probable as event ω1 as [54]: 
      
(74) 
Fishburn [61] used a radically different notation to the intuitive notations 
presented in 72 to 74. He used real-valued function representations rather 
than inequalities, for example: 
             ,       
(75) 
Since   is real-valued, it enables us to establish a bridge to the quantitative 
counterpart of probability, since under the assumption of simple linearity, 75 
can be re-written as: 
                      
(76) 
However, what would be the assumptions of CP that can be set as axioms for 
their simplicity and intuitively? First, the axioms should not point out trivial 
facts or non-probabilistic assertions. In order to achieve that, possible events 
should have a probabilistic value such that the comparative probability of the 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
96 
 
 
 
sample space—that is, all possible events—is more probable than the 
impossible events: 
                          
(77) 
where   is the empty set or the set of impossible to occur outcomes from the 
sample space   [54]. Consequently, an event like ω is not more certain or 
impossible than it is probable, or in CP terminology:  ω is more probable than 
the impossible, which is the null or empty set [62]: 
                     ℎ                         
(78) 
Second, two comparative probability statements should not contradict each 
other. If ω1 and ω2 are both possible outcomes from the sample space  , 
then the two statements, ω1 is at least as probable as ω2 and ω2 is at least as 
probable as ω1, cannot be both true, that is [54], 
                                 
(79) 
Third, another candidate for the axiom of CP comes from the property of 
transitivity in the mathematics of inequalities [63]: 
                             3        3 
(80) 
       
However, the axiom of transitivity did not go unchallenged, as May [64], 
Tversky [65] and Fishburn [59] showed that in multidimensional events, cyclic 
patterns can arise, which would violate the implication of 80. Fishburn’s [59] 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
97 
 
 
 
example of  a cyclic pattern assumes a hypothetical situation where an agent 
named Sue is supposed to meet a famous author named Mike. She has not 
met him before but has the following expectations about his attributes: 
Height (ht): 6'.0"    6'.1"   6'.2", 
Age (ag): 40   50   60, 
Hair Colour (hc): brunette    red   blonde. 
Based on these three attributes, Mike may be any of the following 
composites: 
A = 6'.0" 60-year-old redhead;  
B = 6'.1" 40-year-old blonde;  
C = 6'.2" 50-year-old brunette 
Sue would consider one of these composites more probable than the others if 
at least two of its attributes are more probable than the others. Hence A   B, 
B   C, but C   A. As plausible as the objection to the axiom transitivity 
appears to be, it received less attention from other researchers, who continue 
to consider it as an axiom [58, 66, 67], albeit with caution [54]. It is worth 
noting that Sue’s decision regarding the probability of how Mike will look is un-
formalized and rather breaches the some of the basic rules of calculus. One 
central requirement of this thesis is for the interpretation and usage of 
probability to be admissible, that is, to comply with the theory of calculus.  
      
More rationalised and more formalised analysis of the previous 
situation requires us to notice that the composite event of how Mike would 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
98 
 
 
 
look is the joint probability of height, age and hair colour P(ht, ag, hc). It 
seems reasonable to assume that the three attributes are independent, hence: 
  ℎ ,   , ℎ     ℎ         ℎ   
(81) 
 
If   ℎ    .       ℎ    .    ,            ℎ      and   ℎ  
    e  e    ℎ      ,  then:  
  ℎ    .   ,      ,          e 
   ℎ    .   ,      ,     ed  
(82) 
But one cannot infer that B   C because on one hand, we have: 
   ℎ    .   ,           ℎ    .   ,        
(83) 
and on the other: 
   ℎ             ℎ            
(84) 
       
So, a rational agent will be indifferent to the likelihood of B and C 
because 83 and 84 cannot mathematically be combined together to yield 
either B   C or B   C. Since the rational agent has no way to favour one over 
the other, he/she will assume they are equiprobable. A classical frequentist 
may approach the problem by applying the principles of counting: There are 
3×3×3= 27 possible “looks” for Mike and there is only one way to count each 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
99 
 
 
 
of A, B or C. Therefore, they are all equiprobable, which agrees with the 
results of personal subjective analysis.  Consequently, we can intuitively set 
as an axiom the claim that if ω1 is not more probable than ω2 and ω2 is not 
more probable than ω1, then ω1 is as probable as ω2: 
                3  
      3 
(85) 
 
Based on the previous five axioms, one can easily conclude the following 
consequences [54]: 
                
(86) 
      
Equation 86 states that if an event like   is a subset from the sample 
space  , then it will make perfect sense to assume that the probability of 
every possible event or set of events is higher than the probability of a single 
event or set of events. Consequently, 86 can be generalized to: 
               
(87) 
Since CP is a binary and linear relationship, if one event is more probable 
than another, the negation of that event is less probable than the negation of 
the other [68]: 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
100 
 
 
 
          
    
  
(88) 
If we hold true the definitions of joint and union of events from chapter 2, then 
if the joint of two events is null, and [54]: 
          3            3          3         
(89) 
Further conclusions are possible and were discussed in [63]. Generally 
speaking, the axiomization of CP starts by selecting either       as the very 
basic foundation of CP or       [59]. However, we have followed a mixed 
approach to that, where we started with the latter and then used the former to 
strengthen the weaker assumptions of CP that often generate controversy. As 
CP is still an infant concept as compared to other well-established probability 
interpretations, the axioms discussed so far are by no mean presented as 
complete or unchallengeable. They can be regarded as a guide to formalize 
everyday pseudo-rational statements regarding probabilities of events, but 
more importantly, they present how the quantitative probability can be 
deducted from the qualitative probability. The latter is the subject of the next 
section.   
 
3.2.1 Compatibility with quantative probability 
 
At first glance, CP seems to be compatible with quantative probability 
and its axioms, put forward by Kolmogorov.  It seems plausible that every 
probability axiom of the Kolmogorov probability (KP) is compatible with the five 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
101 
 
 
 
CP axioms developed earlier. Unfortunately, this is not the case because CP 
is defined on lexicographical order sample space, whereas KP is defined over 
numerical order sample space. A numerical set like [0,1] can have an infinite 
number of subsets but a lexicographical set like [a,b,c,d] can have only limited 
sets. Therefore, it is perfectly possible to think of a situation where the infinite 
becomes contradictorily finite [54,p. 18]. Consider, for the sake of the 
argument, that CP is defined over a topological space (Rn) like Ω = [0,1], 
having subsets that adhere to the Borel field of Ω. This choice is not 
coincidental but rather represents the best candidate for space that could 
become the bridge between the quantities and qualities of probabilistic 
statements.  In addition, let λ(A) be the Lebesgue measure of subset A 
defined in Ω. Furthermore, let φ(A) be another measure of A dominated by 
λ(A),  such as the triangular density.  If the comparative relationship     is 
defined as: 
                                     ≥     
(90) 
then the definition satisfies all the axioms of CP presented in the previous 
section and thereby represents a compatible one-to-one relationship between 
CP and KP. This is evident because if A is the set (1-x,1) and B is the set (0,x) 
where 0 < x < 1, then              and            ≥        
[54,p. 18] satisfies equations 77,78,79,80,85 and 90.  However, this results in 
a contradiction, because x can be any value out of infinitely many values in 
the range [0, 1], whereas the lexicographical order space has only finite sets. 
Thereby it would contradict the existence of a one-to-one relationship. To 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
102 
 
 
 
alleviate the possibility of contradiction, a new axiom should be added to the 
inventory of CP axioms, so that it guarantees the compatibility between the 
collation of lexicographical and numerical.  
       
One way to define such an axiom is to imagine a topological space like 
R having a collection of subsets τ such that (R, τ) has a countable base or (R, 
τ) has an accountable order dense set [69, 70]. However, the axiom of 
countable base does not admit, or guarantee, a unique probability value for an 
event; rather, we can define as many functions as we like that satisfy the 
axioms of CP and are compatible with quantitative probability. Fortunately, if 
CP is to be compatible with KP, then we can simply choose the probability 
function that satisfies P(Ω) = 1 [54,p. 19].  
      
In order for CP to be fully compatible with KP, it should be compatible 
with the finite additivity and in turn with the third axiom of KP, that is to say, if a 
comparative relationship satisfies the six axioms of CP, then there should 
exist a function like G of two variables, such that [54,p. 22] 
                     ,       
(91) 
and it should also be symmetric, strictly increasing, and associative. However, 
Kraft [71] proved that such a function cannot exist, challenging the previous 
six axioms. An example of situation where 91 is not satisfied is evident when 
Ω={a,b,c,d,e} and τ is all the subsets of the following order [54,p. 22]: 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
103 
 
 
 
                                 
                             
                                
   
(92) 
        Equation 92 satisfies the six axioms of CP; however, there is no such G 
to satisfy 91. To see that, let P(a) = A,  P(b) = B, P(c) = C, P(d) = D and P9e) 
= E; then from 92, it follows A + C < D, A + D < B + C and C + D < A + E, 
which can be simplified to: A + C + D < B + E, hence acd   be, which 
contradicts 92 [54,p. 22].  One way around this contradiction is to introduce a 
condition that CP should satisfy in order to become fully compatible with finite 
additivity. Luce [72] introduced such sufficient a condition. Although others 
have proposed different approaches [56], Luce’s seems more appealing [54,p. 
25]. Luce used results from the theory of extensive measurement to prove his 
theorem by proposing the criterion [72]: 
        
      
         ,   ,          
       ,  ,     ,            
(93) 
        Equation 93 is appealing because it does not require the sample space 
to be strictly infinite, as Savage and Kraft’s proposals do [54,p. 25]. Since CP 
is now compatible to an acceptable extent with finite additivity, the next step is 
to look at countable additivity. If CP is compatible with countable additivity, 
then it will be compatible with KP.   

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
104 
 
 
 
       
In the measure and probability theory, countable additivity becomes 
equal to finite additivity if the following condition holds true [73]: 
       3              
           
(94) 
The condition given in 94 is also known as the continuity condition, which was 
adopted by Kolmogorov as an axiom for the KP [74]. Hence, 93 can be 
relaxed to accommodate for continuity condition: 
             ⋂   
 
   
            
(95) 
However, having CP compatible with countable additivity is not always 
desirable. De Finetti [54, 74] argued against such an approach, as it would 
result in absurd situations, for example, the experiment of picking a positive 
integer number at random. In this experiment, the sample space Ω can be 
thought of as being Ω = {1,2,3,….}, which is clearly an infinite space.  The 
power set of all positive integers is also infinite and the probability of each 
element within the power set is 0. Hence the probability of Ω, which is a 
member of the power set as well, is 0! But KP requires P(Ω) = 1. In addition, 
how are we to rationally justify that the probability of picking the number 1 is 
equal to the probability of picking a number from within the range (1,109) = 0? 
Shouldn’t the latter weigh more than the former? Bertrand Russell viewed a 
set that has itself as a member as paradoxical [75] and required that no set be 
a member of itself. However, the strongest and most traditional argument 
against a subjective approach to probability comes from Ellsberg’s analysis of 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
105 
 
 
 
Savage’s axioms [76], where he showed two examples of subjective 
judgements leading to absurd results.  Ellsberg’s first example is a traditional 
betting situation, where a gambler is asked to bet on the label of a randomly 
selected ball from an urn of 100 balls. The urn contains 25 balls labelled R1, 
25 labelled B1, and the remaining 50 balls are labelled either R2 or B2, but 
their proportion is known to the gambler. The betting versus winning options 
are: 
r1: wins $1000 if the chosen ball is R1, but nothing otherwise. 
b1: wins $1000 if the chosen ball is B1, but nothing otherwise. 
r2: wins $1000 if the chosen ball is R2, but nothing otherwise. 
b2: wins $1000 if the chosen ball is B2, but nothing otherwise. 
       
Presumably, the gambler would think the odds for r1 and b1 are the 
same and since r2 and b2 proportions are known, the gambler would be 
indifferent to any of them. In addition, the gambler would prefer r1 over r2 and 
b1 over b2 because, once again, the quantities of r1 and b1 are known, 
whereas those of r2 and b2 are unknown. Using CP terminology, we can 
specify the gambler’s preferences as follows: 
     ,      ,      ,       
(96) 
 
Now, let us assume the game is updated with two further compound 
bets, as follows: 
c1: wins $1000 if the chosen ball is R1 or B1, but nothing otherwise. 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
106 
 
 
 
c2: wins $1000 if the chosen ball is R2 or B2, but nothing otherwise. 
The new bets would seem less ambiguous in the eyes of the gambler because 
the R1+B1 ball count is known, as is R2 + B2. In fact, they both add up to 50. 
Once more, the gambler would give the same odds for each of them. 
                  
(97) 
        But if the additive axioms are to hold true and since      ,      , 
then      ,      , which clearly contradicts 96 [61, 76, 77]. One way to 
resolve this contradiction is to involve rational subjective judgements. If a 
rational agent prefers      , then it implies that the number of balls labelled 
R1 is higher than or equal to R2; hence, the number of B2 balls is higher than 
or equal to B1, therefore       a d        cannot be both true at the same 
time because       implies      . Ellsberg’s analysis is just another 
example of why drawing knowledge from ignorance leads to contradictions. 
That is because Ellsberg presumed that because we do not know the 
proportion of R2 and B2, we should be indifferent to their probabilities. It is 
similar to the Laplacian approach to probability we discussed earlier.  
       
A more rational standpoint to the Ellsberg example is:  
                           
(98) 
Now our gambler can either prefer that       or       but not both. In 
turn, the contradictions that resulted from 97 cease to hold. Fishburn’s 
approach is to add another axiom to CP that requires [61]: 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
107 
 
 
 
           ,       ,        ,       ,    
(99) 
and if   is normalized against Ω: 
   ,       
(100) 
then Fishburn proved [61] that if A1, A2…,An are disjoint pairwise events and 
similarly forB1, B2,…,Bn, then: 
  
 (⋃
  
 
   
, ⋃
  
 
   
) 
  ∑

    ,    
 
   
      ∑
    ,   
 
   
   
 
   
   ∑
    ,   
 
   
 
(101) 
 
The advantage of 101 is that it only needs values for   to be specified at the 
most elementary pairs of events, that is, A and B, but Fishburn did not provide 
a systematic way of estimating the values he chose for   apart from an ad hoc 
table with values already there. It is assumed that the values can be chosen 
arbitrarily but within the constraints of not violating his axioms of CP.  
     
In conclusion, CP is still an infant approach to the analysis of 
probability. Its main playground is philosophical and logical formalisation of its 
axioms. This section has presented a brief bridge that transposes qualitative 
statements to quantitative statements. The debate about the axioms of CP 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability

and its relation to KP is far from conclusive and there are many active 
researchers formalising and criticising the work already done for CP.  
However, the main objective of this thesis is not the minor dilemmas that 
always exist in any formation of axioms in existence. There are as many 
paradoxes for KP as there are for CP and the important lesson to learn, in the 
context of science, is the usefulness of a method in answering a scientific 
inquiry.  
3.2.2 Conditional comparative probability 
So far, we have only been concerned with elementary probability 
representation and relationship. This section expands on the axioms of CP 
developed in the previous sections and the analysis and limitations of CP as 
compared to KP.  
        The derivation of conditional comparative probability (CCP)  follows 
either a ternary or a quaternary approach. In a ternary approach, CCP is  
assumed to be a ternary relationship over the space      , where   is a 
field of events and   is a set defined over   [54,p. 28]. In other words, CCP 
defines a comparative relationship between two variables conditioned over a 
third, read as given by a third. If  ,      and    , then a ternary CCP 
relationship is defined as [54,p. 28]: 
   ,       |   |  
(102) 
As is the case with the theory of KP in chapter 2, CCP also satisfies the 
axioms of CP, as well as [54,p. 28]:

   ,            |   |     |     |   
(103) 
       
The importance of TCCP comes from the fact that it can be used to 
calculate posterior probability given some evidence, albeit in a weaker form. 
This is important in situations where a decision must be made in the light of 
some evidence or for estimating the probability of a variable recursively. The 
latter is of higher interest for this thesis, as its intention is to develop a 
theoretical background that deals with knowledge representation under lack of 
data and/or ambiguity.  
       
For the quaternary CCP (QCCP) approach, the axioms are direct 
counterparts of the ones developed earlier. In his magnum opus paper, Luce 
introduced seven axioms for QCCP [78]. First, if Ω is the sample space of 
events where   is a subset of it, then: 
     |   |   |   |  
(104) 
     |      |  
(105) 
                 |    |     |    |      | 
      |  
(106)

                   |    |  
(107) 
The beauty of QCCP comes from the fact that it can be used to derive 
a weak form of Bayes’ theorem [54]. Assume that A,C is in field   and 
 ,       but does not include the null set, and that   satisfies L1-L4. Then 
there exists P agreeing with CP axioms and two real-valued functions F and G 
that if   |   |  , then [54]: 
   |    (     |  ,    |   ,    |  ) 
(108) 
       
Equation 108 will enable us to infer the characteristics of  |  from 
 | , |  and  | . Furthermore, Luce’s axioms will enable us to make QCCP 
compatible with KP because axioms L1-L4 can be used to show that there 
exists a P agreeing with L1 to L4, such that [78]: 
     |       |       |   
(109) 
       
Equation 109 is the CP equivalent of the product rule conditioned on C. 
However, the theory of comparative probability would not be complete without 
the notion of independence. Since CP formally represents a relationship 
between events in a qualitative fashion, the notion of independence would 
only make sense if it was event-wise rather than experiment-wise, as is the 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
111 
 
 
 
case with KP  [54,p 33]. The difference between the two is important in the 
light of subjective probability. Independent experiments refer to experiment 
outcomes being statistically unrelated to each other, which is justified by the 
combinatorial calculus, whereas independent events are those where the 
occurrence of one does not change our expectations about the occurrence of 
the other, which is justified by axiomisation.  If A and B are both events from 
the sample space Ω, then the simplest axiom that can be drawn from the 
independence of A and B is that if A is unrelated to B, then the same goes for 
B and A [54,p 33]: 
            
(110) 
where   exemplifies independence, or unrelatedness, between two events. 
Furthermore, an event is a subset of Ω, so the occurrence of one is unrelated 
to the other, as it does not change one’s belief about the likelihood of the 
other. Using the same justification, we can intuitively see the validity of the 
following axioms [54,p 33]: 
        
(111) 
             
(112) 
         ,             
(113)

Further intuitive axioms are also possible, and a weaker experiment-wise 
independence could also be driven, but they are not essential to the purpose 
of this thesis. For convenience, this section will conclude with a box of all the 
axioms of CP, which will be easier to refer to later on.

3.2.3 Comparative probability: Decision-making prospective 
 
So far, we have only been concerned with CP from mathematical, 
logical and philosophical standpoints. Philosophy is an arena of debate, 
whereas science is one of research, analysis of empirical observations and 
application of theories to yield useful products. Therefore, it will be of value to 
know whether CP has managed to escape the “ballrooms” of philosophical 
debates 
and 
mathematical 
theorising 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
practical 
implementation.  In section 3.1, we looked at the criteria of a good 
interpretation of probability, and CP should not be an exception to them. The 
emphasis of a good probability theory should be on its applicability as a 
framework is simply useless to science if it cannot be utilized in any way.  
        There are many frameworks in the literature regarding the formalisation 
of CP axioms and sometimes for developing some guidelines as to how it 
would be used for decision-making and inference. As much as these 
frameworks are packed with long mathematical formalizations, they are short 
on comparison to their quantative probability counterpart. Without justification 
for preferring CP over the de facto interpretation of probability in science, 
which withstood the test of time and was there during all of our scientific 
endeavours, why would anyone choose CP? In this section, we will be looking 
at some of the interesting frameworks in CP, their applications, and limitations. 
        Peter Fishburn is one of the well-known names in decision-making and 
the axiomisation of CP as an independent interpretation of probability [59, 61, 
70, 79, 80]. The previous section has already presented some of his 
contributions to CP. The main framework of Fishburn was answering de 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
115 
 
 
 
Finnite’s question on the existence of an order-wise relationship that is 
sufficient for the existence of order-preserving probability measure [80]. The 
answer to the question was to introduce more basic but constraining limits on 
CP in order to preserve the order-wise nature of CP while solving any 
paradoxical objection to it [61]. Fishburn showed an example of how his 
version of CP can solve Ellsberg paradoxical examples of subjective 
probability through the introduction of the skew-symmetric function   [61]. As 
mentioned earlier, there was no discussion on how the performance of CP 
compares to KP. Such a comparison, if it was in favour of CP, would prove the 
case of CP as an interesting alternative to KP that scientists should start to 
use, rather than shelve it along with the other mathematical constructs with 
internal inconsistencies. In addition, Fishburn did not provide us with a clear 
algorithm that explains in a step-by-step fashion how to use his framework to 
solve problems in decision-making beyond some isolated examples and more 
mathematical constraints.  
        Terrence Fine is another example of the independent interpretation 
approach to CP [54, 69, 81]. However, Fine’s approach seems relaxed and 
less constrained than Fishburn’s or Luce’s, as examples [54]. Fine developed 
five axioms that characterize a rational decision-making process and 
expectations, all in terms of comparative-like inequalities [54]. However, all of 
these axioms were incomplete in showing a single example of how to use 
them to come up with a rational decision within any context, not even a game 
of chance.  Fine admitted the existence of the problem of measuring 
subjective probability or preferences and even the psychological factors 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
116 
 
 
 
leading to constraining the process of extracting those from decision-makers 
[54,p. 233].  Along with Walley, the framework seemed to be shifted toward 
establishing a unified framework of upper and lower probability, or imprecise 
probability [82, 83].   Imprecise probability refers to classes of mathematical 
models that deal with uncertainty and the availability of partial information [82]. 
Walley tried to unify many of the proposed models of imprecise probabilities, 
including CP itself, using the subjective framework of Bayesian networks [82].  
When there is not enough data to infer a descriptive probability distribution, 
then upper and lower bounds are defined and the gap between the upper and 
lower limit is supposed to decrease as data is gathered, until the gap is closed 
and what was imprecise is now precise [84]. Walley’s focus was on the 
mathematical level of generality that will be needed to achieve such unification  
[82]. His framework was further applied to graphical models’ [85] belief 
functions [86], among others. Walley’s framework seems interesting within the 
context of this thesis; however, it still has the drawback we mentioned earlier, 
namely, no step-by-step algorithm was specified that could aid a decision-
maker in making the decision and no comparison with KP was attempted.  
        The third example of CP framework is Andrea Capotorti, who proposed 
some interesting CP axioms that can be described algorithmically and 
implemented on computers [66, 87]. For Capotorti, the reason a decision-
maker would prefer CP over the other interpretations of probability is that they 
are not compatible with the psychology of human preferences and sometimes 
even violate the axioms of KP [66], not to mention the “where are all the 
numbers coming from?” argument [66]. However, the same argument goes 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
117 
 
 
 
against CP because if it was valid for us to wonder where the frequentists take 
their quantities from, then by the same logic it is valid to wonder where the 
comparativists get their qualities from.  The Capotorti algorithm works by 
constructing qualities and constraints that describe a situation [66]. For 
example, if heads was more probable than tails, then we can describe it as 
             ℎ       . The algorithm continues to use constraints and 
new information to update the qualities until a decision, or inference, is 
possible [66], although it was not clearly specified how such an update is 
made. In addition, it seems like interfacing with such DSS, if ever 
implemented, will be extremely difficult because it does not provide a 
quantified output, nor does it have an objective procedure for converting 
sensor measures into qualities. Finally, it relies heavily on expert knowledge to 
come up with the qualities that represent a situation. 
        In conclusion, this section tried to summarize the most important 
frameworks of CP as a tool for inference and decision-making. We have seen 
how CP frameworks were shifted when faced with different challenges in 
regard to measuring personal preferences, restricting their flexibility by the 
addition of more axioms and pitching for unification with other frequency-
based probabilistic theories. We have also seen that the closest framework to 
the objectives of this thesis was that of Peter Walley, which aimed at unifying 
CP with the upper and lower probability model of imprecise probability. What 
steps are required in order to improve Walley’s axioms? Will it be possible to 
propose an algorithm that automates the process of inference in a way that 
proves more beneficial than the current conventional methods? If so, how do 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
118 
 
 
 
they compare? We will explore the answers to these questions in the next 
section. 
3.3 
Proposing a new approach to CP 
 
Up to this point, we have discussed various concepts in probability 
theory, from the basics to some of its advanced concepts and results. 
Moreover, we took a step back to understand where probability comes from 
and how we should interpret it. Our aim was to search for a better 
representation of knowledge in situations when little information is available. 
From within the discussion, a candidate emerged that seemed to be up to the 
task of answering the question, which we referred to as CP.  But CP is still far 
from complete, both as a theory and as a practice.  It is more a philosophical 
concept than a scientific method. However, this is not to say that CP literature 
is sparse but rather to emphasize the fact that, apart from making very simple 
decisions, it has not been used for much. Therefore, if we want to keep 
thinking that CP is the promising answer to our questions, then what 
modifications, if any, are necessary to make it work? The answer to the 
question requires us to specify the concepts of probability theory that we 
would like to keep and what sort of utility we would like CP to work with.

119 
 
 
 
3.3.1 Requirements, assumptions and aims 
First, CP should not replace KP or provide a standalone interpretation 
of probability that works completely parallel to KP or even contradicts KP. The 
reason behind this requirement is that KP is well established and has been 
used in almost every scientific discipline. It would not make sense to throw 
away a very successful theory such as KP, given how widely it is used and 
how successful it is as a scientific tool. In addition, we would like to utilize the 
greatest results of the modern theory of probability without worrying about 
them not being compatible with CP’s axioms.  Results such as the central limit 
theory and the strong law of large numbers are so much appealing to any 
researcher that it would be desirable to have them in scientific endeavours. 
Hence, the first requirement simply states that KP and its results are true a 
priori. 
Second, we assume that probability exists as an objective property of 
things in reality and that it can be determined through experiments and 
empirical observations.  This assumption is backed by both scientific and 
philosophical justifications. The scientific justification is based on the fact that 
empirical observations are the essence of the scientific method. Therefore, the 
quantification of the properties of an observable phenomenon in reality should 
reflect the objectivity of the property itself. The philosophical justification 
comes from our conceptualizing of probability as being the guide to life. If 
probability is to guide life, then it should not be mere analytical statements, for 
analytical statements do not describe reality nor provide a guide for it. 
Probability should be inferred from reality in order for it to become the guide 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
120 
 
 
 
for life. In other words, probability should be estimated from data posterior, not 
from the space of possibilities, as is the case with the Laplacian probability. If 
no data is available, then probability still exists but it is unknown. 
Third, when the number of experiments is high enough, then the 
probability of an outcome should be quantified using the relative frequency 
interpretation of probability. This requirement is important because without a 
way to objectively quantify a probability it will be useless, for an unknown 
quantity that can never be measured is worth nothing in the context of 
science. The third requirement is also essential because we want to use CP to 
write algorithms that are integrable with others. Hence it should “speak” the 
same language that the state-of-the-art algorithms speak. What is essential to 
our CP theory is to be able to give a hand to probability estimations in an 
online scenario, up to the point where the algorithms are ready enough to do it 
on their own.   
Finally, we accept the relative frequency position that if an experiment 
is repeated often enough, then the probability of an outcome approaches its 
relative frequency of occurrence. Consequently, CP becomes a background 
tool, while KP is the foreground methodology for estimating probability. This 
assumption sets the new approach apart from that of Savage, Fine, Fishburn, 
and others because CP was either considered a standalone interpretation for 
some of them or an approach to the frequency interpretation for the others.  
Since the process of scientific theorizing revolves around usefulness 
and utility, the new approach should prove useful in terms of its results when 
compared to other similar tools in inference and decision-making. But proving 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
121 
 
 
 
the usefulness of a tool in making decisions or inference is not by itself 
enough to make a good case, because making good decisions under 
uncertainty only works on average. A process of decision-making may 
sometimes lead to a very bad decision but if it was compensated by other 
decisions that will overall produce positive utility, then we would still consider 
the process of making the decision a valid one. Instead, the benchmark 
should prove to be useful as a predictive tool; after all, scientific theories 
should be able to predict some measurable observations upon which the 
theory can be validated. Since the central aim of the thesis is to produce a 
theory to better represent knowledge in terms of probabilistic statements, then 
in order to prove the case of this thesis, the resulting theory should be better 
in estimating and representing probability than all the known competitors.  
In conclusion, in order to propose a good approach to CP that proves 
useful as a scientific tool, some assumptions and compromises need to be 
made in order to ensure that the end results are on target. We require that CP 
should be fully compatible with KP, that CP is a way of representing 
probabilistic knowledge about reality where probability exists objectively, and 
that the probability of an event is its relative frequency of occurrence only 
when the number of experiments over the space where the event belongs is 
high enough. The proposed theory should prove useful in terms of 
probabilistic predictivity.  
3.3.2 Axioms and theories of the proposed approach 
The previous section sets the requirements of a good solution to have 
in this thesis. It is clear that the requirements favour the relative frequency 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
122 
 
 
 
interpretation but use the comparative probability interpretation as a way of 
describing knowledge that may be subjective. How can we incorporate all of 
these ingredients to produce an online, real-time, dynamic probability 
estimator? 
First of all, we presume the probability of an outcome or a set of 
outcomes defined over a sample space to exist and to have a single value like 
       ,  . The exact value of       may be unknown, but we can 
subjectively suspect that it lies within a region of doubt like ε, such that the 
subjective upper and lower limits of      within which      should exist are: 
           
   …       .   
           
   …       .   
(115) 
where      is   the  subjective probabilistic upper bound of     ,      is the 
corresponding lower bound and   denotes an “as probable as” CP 
relationship. The reason for using comparative relationship here is to allow for 
unsymmetrical upper and lower bounds; otherwise,      will be simply the 
mathematical average of      and     . In addition, we are using the term 
subjective in an epistemological fashion to convey the fact that the upper and 
lower bounds are not “real” probabilities but rather a belief about probability. 
From equation 114 we can infer that: 
               
(116) 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
123 
 
 
 
Since the estimation of      should be available in real-time while the data, or 
the experiment’s outcomes, roll in, we will define  ̃     to be the approximate 
value of      at experiment number (n), which should eventually converge to 
     as the number of  experiments increases indefinitely. As is the case with 
    ,  ̃     should also be within the upper and lower bound of the region of 
doubt: 
 ̃           ̃          
(117) 
and: 
   
   ( ̃    ,     ,     )       
(118) 
In chapter 2, we saw how an estimate of probability can be achieved 
using Markov and Chebyshev inequalities and how they can be used to prove 
that the average of a random variable converges to its expected value as the 
number of experiments increases in the well-known strong law of large 
numbers. But, these two inequalities, although very useful, are not enough to 
provide us with a powerful way to update our probability estimates as new 
experiments become available. For that end, Chernoff bounds provide a better 
and more restricted estimate [18, 88, 89].  For Bernoulli variables, the 
Chernoff bound is given by [90]: 
  (        ̃       
 )    
    
  
(119) 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
124 
 
 
 
Equation 114 defines the upper bound, or tail, of     . Since our goal is to 
better estimate       given  ̃    , we want to decrease the size of the 
uncertainty region as more data starts rolling in. Therefore: 
    (          ̃            
 )    (        ̃        
 ) 
(120) 
Using equation 87, equation 120 implies that 
(          ̃            
 )  (        ̃        
 ) 
(121) 
Since: 
    
 
≥  
  
(122) 
then: 
          ̃                ̃      
(123) 
and: 
  
         1
 
 
≥  
     
  
(124) 
Since the lower limit of         ̃      is 
 
 , using equations 115 and 124, we 
can solve for       :

              √
 
   (               )

Similarly:

where 
        
 ∑  
 
 
 
(127) 
is the mathematical average of  . Since   is a binary variable, its average is 
also its probability when the number of experiments is approaches infinity. 
Notice that 125 and 126 do not give the upper and lower tail of Chernoff 
bounds but rather a mirrored upper tail and a mathematically mirrored tail. In 
order to show how the above two equations can be used to estimate 
epistemologically stricter bounds for the upper and lower probability, we will 
use a coin flipping example. Let us assume a decision-maker is asked to 
predict the upper and lower probability bounds of heads in an experiment of 
coin flipping. The coin may be biased to heads or tails, but that is unknown to 
the decision-maker. Since the decision-maker is indifferent to whether the coin 
is biased or unbiased, he would assume an initial probability of ½ for the 
probability of heads, making the upper and lower probability as probable as 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
126 
 
 
 
heads itself. The decision-maker is hoping to update the bounds as more 
experiments are performed. She/he decided to use equations 125 and 126. 
Let us imagine the experiment of tossing a coin was repeated 1,000 
times. The decision-maker would like to calculate the accuracy of equations 
125 and 126. Using Matlab, we can generate pseudo-coin flips with uniform 
probability distribution. Figure 16 shows a plot of the upper bound (in green), 
the lower bound (in black) and the average probability calculated over the 
course of the 1,000 experiments. 
 
Figure 16. The upper (in green) and lower (in black) bounds of probability 
Notice how the uncertainty gap between the upper and lower bounds starts to 
close with the increase in experiments. Let the error of representation be 
defined as the mathematical average of deviation of the current calculated 
probability from the ideal probability, which in this case is ½. The lower bound 
value will be in error if it was higher than ½, whereas the upper bound value 
will be in error if it was lower than ½. With that in mind and using figure 16, the 
average error in representing the lower probability is 0.03, the average error in 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
127 
 
 
 
representing the upper probability is 0.0013 and the average error in using the 
relative frequency interpretation, equation 127, is 0.057. This clearly proves 
CP’s upper and lower bounds as a better representation of probability. But it 
may seem ad hoc to assume the initial probability to be ½ and then prove that 
it is the case; after all, not every coin is a fair coin. In order to prove that the 
upper and lower bound method would still work in any other situation, let us 
imagine two situations where the decision-maker suspects the coin to be 
biased but it is not and where the decision-maker does not suspect any bias 
but the coin is biased. Figure 17 shows the first situation, where a decision-
maker assigned P(heads) = 0.3 to the upper and lower probability values. 
Nonetheless, his/her belief starts to update towards the correct end pretty 
quickly. 
 
Figure 17. The upper (in green) and lower (in black) bounds when changing the initial 
probability to 0.3 rather than 0.5. 
For the second case, the simulation of coin flipping was set so as to 
produce more heads than tails, with a ratio of 7:3, but as the decision-maker is

128 
 
 
 
indifferent to that, he/she initially assigned P(heads) = ½ . Figure 18 shows the 
results. Notice how the upper and lower bounds almost always represent the 
ideal probability correctly, as it always lies within the region of uncertainty. 
This result is intuitive, given the power of Chernoff bounds and CP.

Finally, because the thesis advocates better knowledge representation on 
less data, it will be of value to focus the lens on the performance of the upper 
and lower bounds on the first few experiments. Figure 19 shows 100 coin 
flipping experiments simulated with Matlab. Once more, the upper and lower 
bounds, although wider, came closer to the ideal probability of ½.

Table 1 shows a summary of the previous four experiments. The 
results should not be surprising at all, as the upper and lower bounds provide 
a more relaxed way of describing what the probability is. What is important 
here is that although the relative frequency of heads moves above and below 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
130 
 
 
 
the actual probability, the bounds stay on target, widening up when the 
number of experiments is low and narrowing down as the number of 
experiments increases. Equations 125 and 126 provided us with a way to 
change the representation of knowledge dynamically and online. To 
emphasize this point more, the four experiments show that we can use 125 
and 126 to make decisions right from the beginning of the process, system, or 
observations. No period of offline time is needed to calculate the probability of 
an outcome; it will be computed dynamically online and in real-time. This very 
simple result in concept was not possible without CP to represent knowledge 
and KP to quantify the knowledge. Finally, we can summarize the algorithm 
used to estimate the probability of heads in the previous four experiments as 
follows: 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
Algorithm 1: Probability update of a Bernoulli variable 
1- Start with n=1 and let  𝑃 𝜔  𝑃 𝜔  𝑃 where P is a subjective 
belief or an unconditional probability of a similar variable. 
2- Calculate the average occurrence of the variable using equation 
127.  
3- Calculate 𝑃 𝜔 , 𝑃 𝜔  using equations 125 and 126 
4-  Get the next experiment outcome and increment n. 
5- Repeat 2,3, and 4 until the difference between 𝑃 𝜔 , 𝑃 𝜔 , 𝑃 𝜔  is 
less than a predefined threshold like 0.05. 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
131 
 
 
 
Step number 5 defines the stop criteria for the algorithm, which we 
have not touched on yet. Since the purpose of the algorithm is to help 
represent knowledge only when little data is available, then the algorithm 
should pass control to the KP representation when enough data are available. 
How do we quantify that? One way is to measure the uncertainty gap or 
difference between the upper and lower bounds to see how close they are to 
the numerical value of relative frequency probability. Another way is to 
calculate the confidence in the value of the current probability using the 
Chernoff bound: 
    ≥  
     
  
(128) 
Hence, the algorithm stops if the confidence (Conf) is more than 0.95. 
However, there are instances where the algorithm might fail, for example, if 
the decision-maker decided to start with a probability of 1 or 0, and it 
happened that the first experiment resulted in heads. This scenario is an 
example of an extreme case where a decision-maker is choosing inrational 
value, for if the probability of an outcome is believed to be 1 then there is no 
need for probability in the first place, because 1 denotes a deterministic 
outcome rather than a probabilistic outcome. However, the decision-maker 
can still use a value very close to 1, such as 0.99, to avoid such a situation.  
In addition, we can use the same method to estimate conditional 
probability since conditional probability is also a probability, that is, it obeys 
the KP axioms. In such case, we can estimate P(Xn+1/Xn) and thereby provide 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
132 
 
 
 
a dynamic,  online and real-time predictor of the next outcome based on the 
current one, with accuracy that increases with the availability of more data. 
3.3.3  Other types of distributions 
All the discussion and results of the previous section were under the 
assumption of Bernoulli variables applied to the very basic problem in 
probability, which is that of flipping a coin. Therefore, the algorithm developed 
so far would not be of much help to solve any scientific problem. How do we 
modify it in order to make it applicable to a wider range of random variable 
types? 
For that end, two approaches are proposed. First, we can derive a new 
Chernoff bound for whatever variable type is in question, or we can modify our 
algorithm to make it applicable to the variable type. The second approach 
appears to be easier than the first are, although, literature is full of examples 
of Chernoff bound for various trails like the Poisson one [91]. Consider a 
random variable like X with outcomes (a,b,c and d). Clearly, X is not a 
Bernoulli variable, but we can make it look like a Bernoulli variable if we let 
P(success) = p = P(a), and P(failure) = q = 1 – p = P(b)+P(c)+P(d). Then we 
can use algorithm 1 to estimate p = P(a) and q, and we can repeat for the 
other variables and normalize them to 1 (see algorithm 2). 
 
 
 
 

 
Theory of Comparative Probability 
133 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
However, algorithms 1 and 2 assume independent trials, which is an 
assumption not always valid. If the trials are dependent then we can map 
them into a sum of variables that are not.  One way to do so is detailed in 
reference [88]. 
3.4 
Summary 
The theory of probability is filled with rich concepts and results, from the 
philosophical debate on the nature and meaning of probability to the practices 
and theories of quantifying it in a given context. A good grasp of both ends is 
of great value in analyzing the needs and requirements for an adequate 
solution to a problem. 
Although there are many interpretations of probability in the literature of 
philosophy, probabilistic logic and mathematics, CP stands out from the crowd 
as a relaxed approach to represent probabilistic statements when little or no

information is available about some situations. In this chapter, we have seen 
how CP can be made compatible with the quantative interpretation of 
probability and how it can be combined with KP to produce a simple formula to 
update the upper and lower probability bounds in real-time. Although the 
assumptions upon which the formula was built are simplistic, the resulting 
algorithm can be taken steps further to make it applicable to more complex 
and interesting problems. Such problems are introduced in chapters 4 and 5, 
where we will attempt to apply the CP approach to probability to two 
interesting problems: aviation safety and patient monitoring in ICU.

4.  Application to aviation safety 
 
Having introduced the proposed approach of using comparative probability 
to make sense of data as they evolve over time, it is time to apply the 
proposed approach to an active area of research and measure the benefits 
and drawback of the new algorithms. After all, a theory of probability is of no 
use if it cannot be applied to science in any constructive way. In this chapter, 
the CP approach to Bayesian networks will be applied to some interesting 
problems in aviation safety. Aviation is one of the highly active industry 
sectors, with millions of passengers transported every year. It is where safety 
is held at a high priority through state-of-the-art diagnosing equipment of 
potential faults and highly detailed procedures to ensure safe and comfortable 
journeys for the passengers. In such situations, high safety standards will be 
maintained through online and offline monitoring and analysis of aircraft 
equipment. In the online phase, the aircraft sub-systems are constantly swept 
for indications of faults. If a fault is detected, a diagnosis subroutine is initiated 
to identify the fault and isolate its source. The process of detecting, identifying 
and isolating a fault will ensure that the pilot is aware of the existence of the 
fault and that it is attended to before the situation worsens. On the hand, the 
offline phase is the process of analysing the flight data stored in the flight data 
recorders (FDRs) to look for abnormalities in equipment behaviours, to 
measure the pilot performance, and to categorize the type of flight to sets of 

 
Application to aviation safety 
136 
 
 
 
types. Such analysis of data, whether online or offline, presents researchers 
with unique problems that call for novel solutions. It would be safe to say that 
all of the techniques and algorithms used in analyzing data to detect 
anomalies involve a step in which the results have to be labelled either normal 
or abnormal. In other words, the algorithms have to make a decision regarding 
the normality of the data it is analysing. Researchers may use different terms 
to refer to such phases, such as if-then rules [92], threshold detection [93, 94], 
or classification [95], but such decision-making phases are the main theme of 
the thesis.  
The previous chapter introduced several approaches to CP and detailed a 
hybrid approach to it that tried to combine the benefits of CP and KP.  
However, it is still unclear how the proposed techniques can be applied to any 
real world scenario beyond the basic coin and dice rolling examples. The 
purpose of this chapter is to investigate the application of CP to some 
interesting problems in aviation safety. The first problem is the real-time fault 
detection and the diagnosing of equipment onboard. The main challenge of 
this problem is how to identify a fault in an environment in which every piece 
of information is doubtful. The second problem is a DSS design where many 
cues collected from various pieces of equipment are combined to present the 
pilots with the bigger picture and to help them make better decisions through 
recommendations.  
 
This chapter will start by establishing a context with current methodologies 
used in aviation safety’s fault detection and diagnosis through a literature

review. It will then discuss the requirement for an online equipment readings 
validator / fault detector. The result will be used to build a decision tree to 
come up with recommendations to the pilot in order to draw better navigation.  
4.1 
Literature review 
The current state of the art in data analysis methods can be loosely divided 
into two major categories:  
1) model-based, and 
2) data-driven (see Figure 20 [96]).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Model-based algorithms can be either physics-based or AI-based. Physics-
physics-based approach relies on first order depiction and/or modelling of the 
system, such as differential equations representation [97], whereas the AI-
based uses classic AI techniques such as expert systems, finite state 
machine, or classical decision making. For example, thresholds can be 
defined for each parameter recorded in an FDR and the instances when these 
parameters exceed those thresholds can be used to trigger IF-THEN rules to

instantiate a consequential action or a report [98]. On the other hand, data-
driven algorithms use historical records of data to model the process. They 
use either mathematical models or machine learning to achieve that goal. 
Some examples of these techniques are given in the following sections. 
 
4.1.1 Model-Driven Data Analysis Approach 
The model-based diagnosis approach is focused on finding relationships 
between system variables. These relationships can either be represented 
quantitatively, such as with mathematical equations, or qualitatively, such as 
with IF-THEN rules [94]. This approach dates back to the early 1970s and has 
been applied to jet engine diagnosis by Baskiotis and colleagues. They 
developed a general methodology for diagnosing a system in which one can 
mathematically represent the relationship between its internal mechanical 
state and its external performance [99]. Since then, various approaches have 
been implemented in this category. Reference [100] gives an introduction 
along with some examples of such approaches as applied to an actuator, a 
combustion engine, and a passenger car.  
In general, model-driven diagnosis systems follow a two-step procedure. 
Firstly, they monitor for discrepancies (also referred to as residuals) between 
the actual and expected status of some measured parameters. These 
discrepancies can either be identified by an added redundant hardware such 
as sensors or analytically through functional representation connecting the 
inputs, states, and the outputs of the system together. Residuals can be 
thought of as features that need, ideally, to be triggered by only one fault type. 

 
Application to aviation safety 
139 
 
 
 
Secondly, they transfer residuals to their matching fault type through, for 
instance, a decision tree of IF-THEN rules [95, 101].          
However, diagnosing systems are often hybrids of the above types. They 
may use quantitative and qualitative approaches to diagnose a residual. One 
recent approach in aviation safety is to verify the data obtained from an FDR 
with mathematically simulated data that is generated using, for instance, the 6 
DoF representation of that aircraft. The deviation between the recorded data 
and the checking data is used for prognosis of potential faults in the aircraft 
[102].  
In conclusion, the development of a prognostic algorithm requires the 
availability of high accuracy models of an aircraft. Such models are sometimes 
only available through the manufacturer. The greater the number of variables, 
states, and parameters to be modelled, the more complex the model becomes 
and the more it requires computational power. In addition, the growing 
complexity of avionics might put the modelling process beyond practical 
realization, let alone the increase in cost. Model-based diagnosis systems are 
generally limited to linear process, otherwise, they require the implementation 
of a piecewise linear approximation resulting in a possibility of poor 
performance. Model-based systems are also prone to errors due to 
uncertainties arising from parameter drift [95]. Finally, one obvious limitation is 
that they require all faults to be known beforehand. Otherwise, the system 
cannot detect residuals for labelling as unknown faults.

4.1.2 Data-Driven data analysis approach 
In contrast to the model-based approach, the data-driven method, also 
known as the process-history-based method, does not require prior 
knowledge of a process, either quantitatively (such as the mathematical 
relation between the process variables) or qualitatively (such as rule-based 
interaction between inputs, states, and outputs of the process), but rather 
relies on extracting knowledge from historical data [103]. The process of 
extracting knowledge can be loosely classified into  
a)  parametric, and  
b) non-parametric.  
In the parametric approach, historical data is used as training examples to 
model the process into a parameterised model. Once that has been done, the 
training examples can be discarded as they are now represented by the model 
structure and the parameters. The model is then used to predict the next 
example. In contrast to this, the non-parametric approach does not generate 
parameters or learn from examples but rather uses the whole data or a 
selected sub-set of it as instant training examples to substitute the real 
process and/or predict the next one. Some of the approaches of that class do 
not require a training phase, parameters being generated, or models being 
built on the data. The system would be available instantly upon the availability 
of data, and it is hence called instant-based learning or memory-based 
learning [1,p. 737].  

 
Application to aviation safety 
141 
 
 
 
An example of the non-parametric approach is the k-nearest neighbour, 
which was employed by the so-called ORCA algorithm. ORCA is a data-driven 
anomaly detection algorithm proposed by S. Bay and M. Schwabacher in 
2003. It was designed to overcome the requirement of high computational 
power for large high dimensional dataset and achieved near linear scaling 
performance [104]. C. Chiu and others proposed the use of the Case-Based 
Reasoning (CBR) to improve aircraft maintenance support [105]. CBR is a 
relatively new approach in machine learning, whereby similar past problems 
are used to solve the current problem on the basis of its similarity to the past 
ones. CBR has also been proposed for troubleshooting aircraft engines [106] 
and prediction of component replacement [107]. Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) is the most popular non-paramteric algorithm. It’s attractiveness is 
related to the optimality property, its ability to construct maximum margin 
separators in which the distance from the boundary decision to the training 
examples is maximized, its ability to map the training data to a higher 
dimensional space where linear separation is otherwise not possible, and the 
sparse representation (its need to retrain only small proportion of the training 
examples rather than the whole data which lead to less memory utilization and 
less computational power [1,p. 737]). S. Das and colleagues have proposed 
an improvement over the ORCA and other algorithms for flight data anomaly 
detection through the use of the multiple kernel learning method. Their 
algorithm is applicable to both continuous and discrete data streams. 
However, their analysis was limited to flight levels below 10,000 ft [108].  

 
Application to aviation safety 
142 
 
 
 
On the other hand, the parametric approach can also be sub-divided into 
qualitative or quantitative. In the qualitative approach, the historical data of a 
process is used to extract expert rules such as the case with expert systems 
or to predict the trend of the process, such as the case with qualitative trend 
analysis (QTA) method. The quantitative approach can be either non-
statistical or statistical. Neural Networks are examples of non-statistical 
methods whereas clustering and principle component analysis (PCA) are 
cases of statistical techniques [109] (see Figure 21 [109]). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In expert systems used to define normal behaviour and, based on this, to 
extract anomalous behaviour that can be associated with a fault using, IF-
THEN linguistic rules are usually used. Knowledge about the system can 
either be described as the state of a system, usually referred to as facts, or 
the relationship between these facts and the state of the equipment [110]. The 
diagnostic procedure can either use forward or backward reasoning.  In 
forward reasoning, an observation or a fact, such as a residual, would form 
the antecedent part of some if-then rule to trigger a production rule, or a

consequence, which can be an alarm, or another if-then rule, as it has now 
become a new fact. In backward reasoning, an observation represents a 
hypothesis that is used to search the entire consequent parts of the 
knowledgebase for matches. The antecedent parts of these matches are then 
used as new hypotheses for new searches, and the process continues 
recursively until one hypothesis proves to be false or the entire knowledge 
base is verified [110]. The main problem with the expert system approach is 
the so-called ‘curse of dimensionality’, which is related to the fact that one 
needs a huge number of rules in order to describe all possibilities. Another 
issue with traditional expert systems is the subjective element and the fact that 
they lack adaptability. These problems have been addressed successfully by 
fuzzy logic [111], which works in a manner similar to expert systems but 
allows partial degrees of fulfilment and overlap. In this way, a small number of 
much more powerful rules (which may be partially satisfied – the degree of 
their activation is inversely proportional to the distance to prototype) can cover 
the whole data space [112]. These are in general very specific to a process 
and very difficult to update [109]. 
In qualitative trend analysis, the evolution of historical data is abstracted 
into symbols called primitives. It approximates the time development of each 
parameter by linear segments and then it labels them as:  
a) increasing,  
b) decreasing, or  
c) steady.  

 
Application to aviation safety 
144 
 
 
 
Successive segments with similar primitives are aggregated together to 
form trends [113]. Trends are used to predict the future state of the system 
and consequently analytically to diagnose the system by comparing the 
analytical state of the system with the actual state. The power of QTA comes 
from its ability to represent development of a parameter in understandable 
terms, such as ‘steady’ or ‘increasing’, often used by experts in many fields, 
e.g. doctors monitoring patients’ conditions [113]. QTA has been applied to 
trend equipment malfunctioning in commercial aircraft using historical reports 
from the Service Difficulty Reporting (SDR) system [114]. The main problem 
with this approach is that the resulting model was too specific to one aircraft 
type and operator. No evidence was given as to how the resulting model can 
be used or even modified to become applicable on operators with mixed 
aircraft fleet. Additionally, the amount of computation power required to trend 
and analyze a process increases significantly as the number of parameters 
representing the process increases. However, PCA has been suggested to 
reduce the number of monitored parameters [115].  Finally, abstracting trends 
for non-linear time series requires a more complex segmentation method than 
a simple triangulation, if the number of resultant segments is to be reduced. 
Several approaches have been suggested, such as using neural network, or 
calculating the first and second derivative of the parameter changes over time 
[109].  
Under the non-statistical category, we find Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 
to be the most utilized approach to diagnosis. Artificial neural networks are 
attractive due to their rapid development speed and their ability to model 

 
Application to aviation safety 
145 
 
 
 
highly nonlinear processes. There is huge amount of literature that suggests 
ANN for fault detection and/or isolation. They have been used to detect 
aircraft sensor abrupt faults using the virtual sensor concept, in which ANN is 
used to reconstruct what the output of the system should be and, thereby, 
compare it with the actual output while monitoring for errors [116], self-
calibrating sensors [117]. ANN has also been proposed for real-time control 
surface fault detection and isolation (FDI) using the same virtual sensor 
concept mentioned earlier [118]. A slightly different approach has been 
proposed by Ali and Tarter. In their method, instead of modelling sensors 
input/output pairs, the aircraft engine noise level during the flight profile is 
modelled and used for comparison [119]. Additionally, Savanur and others 
used an adaptive neuro-fuzzy approach to diagnose aircraft actuator faults 
[120]. However, ANN might be prone to misclassification error near the class 
boundary where the training data is sparse [121]. As is the case with the 
previously mentioned approaches, ANN has been applied to only a fraction of 
what a modern flight data recorder stores, and is also unable to detect 
unknown anomalies where no classes where defined during the training 
phase. 
Whether a process is modelled through expert knowledge or by extracting 
knowledge from data, the resultant model is deterministic in a way that the 
future developments of parameters are uniquely and non-randomly dictated by 
their past states. This is not the case with every parameter recorder in an 
FDR. For instance, the sequence of pilot inputs involves elements of 
randomness. In such a case, the probabilistic/stochastic approach is more 

 
Application to aviation safety 
146 
 
 
 
reasonable when every observation is of a probabilistic nature and the 
majority of observations are assumed to be normal and a significant deviation 
from the normative is considered anomalous. Traditional quality control 
monitoring is one of the oldest users of statistical data-driven fault detection 
[109]. 
Samara and colleagues showed how to design a one-versus-one case 
statistical fault detector that was utilized for the angle of attack (AoA) sensor. 
Their statistical fault detector used a fixed-length sliding window to feed 
statistical calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the residual. 
However, it wasn’t clear why some of their thresholds were chosen the way 
they were, apart from an ad hoc justification of reducing the number of false 
alarms [122]. Chu and colleagues used a least square (LS) regression 
approach to detect performance anomalies in flight data. They considered 
anomalous those samples that deviate from the scatter as a result of 
turbulence and system errors. The model requires the availability of huge 
amounts of historical data, which were generated artificially using one of 
NASA’s medium fidelity flight simulators. Requiring thousands of flight 
examples of an aircraft type for training puts the method beyond practical 
consideration; in addition, the model has not been applied to real flight data 
[123]. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has also been proposed for fault 
detection [124]. EKF is the nonlinear counterpart of the widely distributed 
Kalman filter [125], which is a probabilistic state estimator that tries to estimate 
the states of a system when only noisy observations are presented. Since 

 
Application to aviation safety 
147 
 
 
 
data from FDR could contain both discrete and continuous parameters, it is 
unclear how accurate EKF can be when applied to continuous processes.    
Cluster Analysis is one of the most used tools in the statistical analysis 
toolbox. Its popularity is probably the result of its powerful ability to organise 
data into groups (called: clusters) based on similarity in an unsupervised 
manner. There are generally two types of clustering algorithms:   
a) on-line, and  
b) off-line. 
In hierarchical clustering, data are organized into nested groups of 
hierarchical fashion so that a data point is part of a sequence of nested 
partitions. The organization of data into hierarchical clusters can either follow 
a bottom-up (commonly known as: agglomerative) or a top-down (also known 
as divisive) approach [126]. On the other hand, partitional algorithms assign 
each data sample to a certain cluster. In fuzzy clustering [127], a data point 
can partially belong to more than one cluster. There are many approaches to 
achieving partitional clusters in the literature. They are usually divided into: 
centre-based, prototype-based, graph-based, and density-based, to name a 
few [126]. In the centre-based and prototype-based approaches, the clusters 
are represented in terms of centres (called: centeriods) and the data is 
assigned to that cluster where the distance to the centre is minimum. A 
centeriod of a cluster is the arithmetic mean of all data points within that 
cluster. The resultant shape of a cluster is of convex shape hyper-sphere (if 
Euclidean) and ellipsoid (if Mahalonobis) distances are used. The graph-
based approach begins with a graphical depiction where data points can be 

 
Application to aviation safety 
148 
 
 
 
connected together, based on similarity, to form hyper-graphs. The approach 
works best if the data points are well separated. The density-based approach 
assumes that clusters are those special regions where the data points are 
denser that the other regions [126]. It is quite tolerant to noise and is 
mathematically efficient. The model of the data density distribution is often 
incorporated into the algorithm in terms of constraints or geometric properties 
of the co-variance matrix [126].  
Clustering analysis has been widely used to detect anomalies. Only certain 
key-methods that have been applied to aviation safety, or that have the 
potential of being so, are mentioned. Thomas R. Chidester has applied the 
cluster-based approach to flight data collected from about 1300 flights. He 
used the resulting clusters to generate what he referred to as a ‘morning’ 
report, which measures the similarity of a flight data signature to the cluster 
obtained from the analysis. The similarity is then used as a score of how 
typical a flight is [128]. However, the analysis was limited to a given proportion 
of the flight data. Moreover, since the clustering method is centre-based, the 
resulting clusters are intolerant to noise. Finally, since the shape of the 
resulting clusters are hard determined by the algorithm and not by the 
distribution of the data itself, a flight signature could be misclassified into a 
wrong cluster, which may result in an increase in the number of false 
negatives (FN) or false positives (FP). Mark Ford reported an approach based 
on the use of clustering analysis that was conducted by the British Air 
Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), QinetiQ, and specialists from engine 
manufacturers to detect anomalous signatures in fuel flow to the engines of a 

 
Application to aviation safety 
149 
 
 
 
Boeing aircraft. They analysed 178,000 flight data and performed several 
experiments to understand the formation of ice and, thereby, augmenting the 
instances where the collected data is sparse. They started by cutting the 
recorded flight data into phases and then they focused on only two 
parameters: fuel flow and fuel temperature [129]. Although the report 
mentioned several tools for data mining, there was little discussion on which of 
them were actually used, what assumptions were made, and any other 
technical or mathematical processing of the parameters used. S. Budalakoti 
and colleagues developed what they called the SequenceMiner algorithm, 
which detects anomalous sequences of switch triggers inputted by a pilot in an 
aircraft’s cockpit. They used a modified version of the k-medoids clustering 
algorithm by finding medoids within randomly selected regions of the entire 
dataset. They then used the Bayesian decision tree to model the differences 
and similarities of sequences within the clusters as a way of characterising the 
detected anomaly [130]. While the SequenceMiner works very well when 
applied to discrete sequential data, this is not the case on continuous ones 
[108].      
There is also a growing research interest in using so-called artificial 
immune system to detect anomalies in flight data. Artificial Immune System 
(AIS) is a set of mathematical models that attempts to mimic the biological 
immune system (BIS) found in vertebrates. In recent years, there has been a 
rise of interest in AIS due to its adaptability, optimizability, and potential to 
detect anomalous behaviour. One important application of AIS are situations 
in which much information is known about the normal behaviour of a system 

 
Application to aviation safety 
150 
 
 
 
and a little or no information is known about the anomalous behaviour of a 
system. In computer security, for instance, the behaviour of a normal user 
connected to a server could be known through the analysis of raw access 
files, whereas the behaviour of a hacker trying to exploit the system is not 
always known, particularly with respect to the discovery of new vulnerabilities 
and methods to exploit a system. AIS are built on clustering, whereby one can 
use clustering to analyze the normal behaviour of a process. The resulting 
clusters space is referred to as the ‘self’ and one then uses the 
complementary space, known as the ‘non-self’, to generate detectors and 
apply them to the classification of new data as either the ‘self’ or ‘non-self’, i.e. 
an anomaly [131]. Jennifer N. Davis used an evolutionary algorithm to 
efficiently generate detectors that cover the complementary space where the 
clusters representing the normal behaviour of a system reside. The method 
was applied to data collected from flight data recorders [132, 133]. K. Krishna 
Kumar studied several potential models of AIS to be applied in aerospace 
applications and questioned the adequacy of these models to replicate the 
immune system metaphor [133]. In addition, there were further concerns 
regarding the representative power of the generated ‘self’ space over the 
normal behaviour of a system [134], and it has further been shown that the 
detectors generated over the Hamming-shape space are not well suited for 
online anomaly detection problems [135].     
All of the methods reviewed thus far, except kNN, require a stage of offline 
training so as to extract knowledge from available historical data, except for 
the non-parametric approach, in which the system is available instantly once 

 
Application to aviation safety 
151 
 
 
 
the historical data is available. However, the computational power required for 
implementing a pure non-parametric system is tremendous given the huge 
dimensionality of the data recorded by an FDR. However, a recently proposed 
approach that has attracted much interest in online knowledge extraction 
algorithms where the parameters of the system are estimated and re-
configured on the fly as the data is being passed to the algorithm. Some of 
these techniques can even “evolve” in the sense of introducing new clusters 
and rules to better describe the system [130]. One such evolving algorithm is 
based on the Takagi-Sugeno realization of fuzzy systems (commonly referred 
to as: eTS). eTS uses a density-based clustering algorithm called eClustering 
plus recursive LS (RLS). This results in a flexible structure rule-based model 
of the process that can be used to predict its next state. The structure of the 
system is able to evolve (add new rules or modify existing ones) according to 
the data density dynamic changes. Evolving systems have been used for 
anomaly detection, albeit in other industries such as detecting anomalies (or 
novelties) in video streams [136], machine health prognostic [137], and real-
time characterization of car driver behaviour [138]. As this approach has not 
been applied to the aviation industry, it would be one of the aims of the team 
to estimate its potential for flight data processing, which is specifically the case 
for this project. One could think of an anomaly from a statistical point of view 
as those samples that statistically deviate from the normative represented by 
the majority of other samples. Thus, the detection of novelties boils down to 
estimating the density and defining the deviation from the mean density. A 
sample can be considered anomalous if this deviation is larger than two or 
three times the variance of the data, known as sigma [139]. For the estimation 

 
Application to aviation safety 
152 
 
 
 
of pdf to be computationally efficient, a recursive approach should be 
undertaken, such as the case with recursive density estimation (RDE) 
approach. RDE has been used as a novelty detector in video streams as 
opposed to the traditional kernel density estimation (KDE) approach [140]. 
4.1.3 Types of anomalies 
An anomaly can be defined as a data-point, or a sequence of data-points, 
that does not conform to a well-defined perception of an expected behaviour 
[141]. Researchers use many terms to describe the task of detecting 
anomalous behaviour, often with different terminology. These include novelty 
detection, outliers detection, exception mining, or surprise detection [141]. In 
addition, the definition of anomalous behaviour is another area of debate, as 
research assumptions are often influenced by the availability of data, nature of 
application domain, and availability of validating model [142]. One of the 
earliest definitions of an anomaly comes from F. Grubbs, where it was defined 
as: 
An outlying observation, or outlier, is one that 
appears to deviate markedly from other members 
of the sample in which it occurs [143]. 
Hence, the random variations in observed values of a samples are assumed 
to be the result of a determined system of causes which, acting together, are 
considered normal, while anomalies are the result of another set of causes – 
such as human error or equipment malfunction – which cause the 
observations to further deviate from the normal distribution of the sample. If 
we assume a null hypothesis of: observation    conforms to the normal 

 
Application to aviation safety 
153 
 
 
 
Gaussian distribution of its belonging sample, then a simple way of testing that 
hypothesis is [143]: 
          ̅ 
 
 
(129) 
where  ̅ is the arithmetic mean of the sample and   is the standard deviation 
calculated with   –    degrees of freedom given by: 
   {∑
      ̅ 
 
   
   
}
  
⁄
 
(130) 
The value of    obtained from (129) is compared to a critical value that 
represents the likelihood of recording that observation by chance given the 
size of the sample. The likelihood is often referred to as: the significant level 
and common values of it are: 1%, 2.5%, and 5%. The critical value of T is 
often given in table format which lists a value of T for a given significance level 
and sample size (see reference [143] for an example). Once an anomaly is 
detected, it would be removed from the data-set and the mean and standard 
deviation values are re-calculated once again, and a search for anomalies is 
initiated again. The same procedure continues until no further anomalies can 
be detected [141]. However, if the number of anomalies is small compared to 
the size of the data-set, one could sacrifice the accuracy of the sample 
distribution for computation power efficiency [141]. Another approach is to use 
unsupervised classification, also known as clustering. Within the clustering 
approach, there are two types of anomalies: 

 
Application to aviation safety 
154 
 
 
 
1) An outlier can be thought of as a point in space lying outside those regions 
considered normal. Figure 22 shows a process represented by a space of 
two features. Points inside regions A and B belong to the class of normal 
behaviour. However, point X, which lies outside those regions, is 
considered anomalous. Hence the name: outlier. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2) A surprise is a point assigned to a cluster where it was expected to be 
assigned to a different one due to the current sequence of events. Figure 
23 shows that point X is assigned to cluster B where it should have been 
assigned to cluster C. An application for a surprise is removing 
misclassified nodes from a decision tree [144].

represented by A and B.

A statistical approach to anomaly detection has the benefit of not requiring any 
prior knowledge of the application but it requires the availability of an 
adequate number of sample observations in order to estimate the normal 
distribution of that sample. This approach is sometimes referred to as the 
Type I approach [141]. In contrast to the Type I approach, Type II deals with 
the anomaly detection as a supervised classification problem. Data should be 
pre-labelled as normal or abnormal, but there could be several subclasses 
under the class of normal or abnormal. The system uses these labelled data 
to construct a model that can be used to classify a new data-point. Finally, the 
Type III anomaly detection approach requires the availability of data from one 
class, which is usually the normal class. The system would then use the 
complementary space of the normal class region to construct an anomaly 
detector [141]. 
4.2 
Demonstrating a model-based diagnostic decision tree for 
validating aircraft navigation system accuracy 
 
This section will detail the steps involved in designing a novel model-based 
fault detector and isolator to help pilots validate the accuracy of their 
navigation system. The designed system will be packed by a CP based 
Bayesian network to improve the performance of the system at times of less 
available information. In addition to proving the versatility of CP, the 
introduced system proposes a novel solution to fault detection and equipment 

 
Application to aviation safety 
156 
 
 
 
monitoring in the aviation industry. The reasons behind the proposed solution 
will also be discussed in the following subsections. 
To assist the effort for aviation safety and increase navigation accuracy, 
large aircraft are required to use redundant measuring equipment. The 
accuracy of the navigation system can be verified by comparing the readings 
from two or more different equipment groups. For instance, an accurate 
altitude can be assumed when the altimeter reading of the pilot’s panel is 
identical to that of the flight officer’s panel. Otherwise, a search for the 
defective component is initiated which, in turn, might involve manual 
procedures such as switching to alternative air data or observing the status of 
the altimeter for visual defection cues such as a fluctuating pointer [8]. 
However, manual observations require the pilots to be in a high state of 
situational awareness where they would be able to comprehend the states of 
the aircraft and, in turn, make reasonable decisions [145]. This negates the 
purpose of a decision support system (or redundant measuring equipment) as 
they are supposed to raise  pilot’s situational awareness instead of the other 
way around. 
 
One fault detection and isolation method that has received much 
research interest is the detection filter proposed by Beard in the early 1970s, 
where a fault is associated with a subspace of error state space called the 
detection space [146].  In this context, Caliskan and Hajiyev have studied four 
algorithms used to verify the co-variance matrix in a Kalman filter (KF) from a 
performance point of view [147]. However, since all KF-based algorithms 
follow signal-based modelling methods in which only the output signals are 

 
Application to aviation safety 
157 
 
 
 
monitored, these algorithms can only detect deviations from assumed normal 
behaviors. The enhancement to fault diagnosis and detection (FDD) proceeds 
on a strictly ad hoc manner, without any solid foundation to enhance generic 
applicability [148]. Other methods used to enhance fault detection are 
discussed in [149], including both the Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation 
(MMAE) and the Interacting Multiple-Model (IMM) algorithms. 
 
Little attention has been given to establishing a framework to develop 
an FDD system that deals with navigation systems as a grid of mathematically 
and physically inter-related quantities in which the accuracy of a reading can 
be mathematically verified. Such verification could be worked out by a 6 
Degrees of Freedom aircraft mathematical model. When the sensor states 
and mathematical states of an aircraft do not resemble each other, a search 
for a fault is initiated that involves qualitative fault isolation. In this 
demonstration, we will use the Bayesian diagnostic tree method to point to the 
most probable culprit of mismatching. The Bayesian diagnostic tree also 
serves as recursive Bayesian estimators to evaluate the probability density 
function of a given fault. Implemented with CP, we will also demonstrate the 
beneficial value of the implementation.  
4.2.1 6 Degrees of Freedom Equations of Motion 
When it comes to building a simulation model for a flying body with high 
fidelity, the 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) is often the popular choice as it can 
be used to simulate displacement and rotation in three-dimensional space 
[150]. A rigid flying body (such as an aircraft) in free motion is able to move 
and rotate freely along any of the three perpendicular axes of a three-

 
Application to aviation safety 
158 
 
 
 
dimensional space, hence providing the six forms of motion. The 6DoF 
equation of motion follows from applying Newton’s second law of motion to a 
flying body subjected to aerodynamic and thrust forces f ,  and the earth’s 
gravitational field.  This can be written as [150]: 
       
  f ,      
(131) 
Where m is the body’s mass and    
  is the velocity of it with respect to the 
inertial frame (I). If the body to be modeled flies relatively close to the earth, 
the earth is often assumed to be the reference frame (E), and, for these 
purposes, assumed to be flat. To solve the previous equation, one needs to 
be able to access the forces applied to the body (B) with B taken as the 
reference frame. This change in reference frames is done through Euler 
transformation. Thus, equation (131) can be re-written as [150]: 
        
           
  f ,      
(132) 
 
The calculation is best carried out using software packages that facilitate 
state-vector variable integration and matrix manipulation [150]. In this 
feasibility study, MATLAB was chosen as the simulation environment. 
4.2.2 Aircraft Modelling 
 
The use of high fidelity models to simulate aircraft motion in space is 
required for accurate validation in a non-simulation environment. The 
development of such a model requires extensive resources and modelling 

 
Application to aviation safety 
159 
 
 
 
time. A high fidelity model of a specific aircraft would require the knowledge of 
complete aerodynamic and thrust tables, flight control design, mass 
parameters, and the logic of the navigation and sensor operations. Only then 
could such a developed model be tested and its reliability thoroughly validated 
[150]. Unfortunately, such detailed considerations in modeling all onboard 
equipment would greatly affect the robustness of the model, and limit its 
application to other aircraft types.  
 
As the focus of this demonstration is FDD/qualitative fault isolation, and 
given the time and resource constraints of this study, the decision was made 
to use a generic out-of-the-box model. The selection criteria for the model 
were primarily on their integration with academically-proven simulation 
environments, such as MATLAB, and trajectory visualizing software packages, 
such as FlightGear. AeroSim blocksets of MATLAB/Simulink block library 
developed by Unmanned Dynamics provide modules for rapid and fast aircraft 
modelling. A complete aircraft 6DoF model can be defined by generating a 
configuration script that specifies the aerodynamics and engine parameters for 
a specific aircraft type. It also provides a parser for importing FlightGear v. 
0.9.2 models such as CESSNA-310. In the development phase of this study, 
the North American Navion was chosen to carry out the simulation. The 
models of the Aerosim block library are limited to only conventional aircraft 
with single piston engine and fixed pitch propeller. Nevertheless, this limitation 
was not deemed to affect the validity of the proof of concept, as the design of 
the system is modular and can be ported to use other aircraft types given an 
accurate mathematical model.  

 
Application to aviation safety 
160 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 24 [151] shows a simplified block diagram of the internal 
structure used in Aerosim to simulate a complete aircraft. Controls from the 
pilot joystick are used by the aerodynamics, propulsion, and inertia models to 
calculate the total forces and moments applied to the aircraft giving the 
simulated atmospheric conditions and reference frame. These in turn are used 
to solve the equations of motion and obtain the aircraft position (altitude, 
latitude, and longitude), orientation (heading, roll, and pitch), and velocity. 
These vectors are used to update the atmospheric and earth model as a 
change in aircraft position might have an impact on the atmospheric 
conditions (e.g. pressure and gravitational forces). The sensor measurements 
are then derived directly from the calculated aircraft state. One drawback of

the Aerosim library is that there are no models developed to simulate 
appropriate aeronautical sensors [8], and generic analog and digital sensor 
blocks were thus used instead. This lack in specific modeling was also judged 
not to have a negative impact on the assumption and validity of this feasibility 
study as the sensors and vector states are treated as black boxes with 
variations artificially generated through the application of noise and scaling 
factors. 
4.2.3 Current Functional Procedures 
To compensate for sensor errors that equipment may encounter during 
operation, modern aircraft are fitted with redundant systems that work 
independently. The value of the measurements is then taken and the value 
displayed to the pilot is made through a majority rule or least square method. 
Since in most cases an aircraft in good condition might only experience a 
malfunction in a single piece of equipment, this error would be compensated 
for by the vote of the other redundant systems (assuming two or more 
redundant systems). 
 
However, majority rule might fail if the cause of the malfunction is 
systemic in such a way as to affect the other redundant systems that are 
concurrently working out the same measurement. For example, the 
measurement of airspeed involves sampling pressure from outside the aircraft 
using special probes, called pitot probes. If an environmental condition such 
as icing could affect one pitot probe, it is not unreasonable to also expect 
some impact on the other, identical redundant probes.  

 
Application to aviation safety 
162 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, it is of great interest to be able to calculate the conditional 
probability of a malfunctioning sensor, given that another sensor has 
malfunctioned using the same process for measurement. Figure 25 shows a 
simple Bayesian network representation of two sensors (labeled S1 and S2) 
working out the measurement of a quantity in an influential environment (E). In 
this case, it is safe to assume the conditional probability of having a wrong 
reading given that E has occurred identically for both sensors, i.e.: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P   |   P   |  …     
(133) 
We are most interested in calculating the probability that the second sensor 
might be malfunctioning given that S1 has malfunctioned and E has occurred, 
i.e., we want to calculate: P   | ,    . One way of calculating this is: 
P   | ,     P   |  ,   P   |  
P   |  
 P   |  P   |

Application to aviation safety 
163 
 
 
 
The result of equation 134 means that if there are evidences for the 
occurrence of environment E, then the probability of one sensor 
malfunctioning has no statistical influence on the other. Both sensors would be 
influenced by E to the same probabilistic degree, whereas if E is assumed not 
to have a global influence, then the probability of having two wrong readings 
out of three is: 
P        f    P   P   
(135) 
The probability of two wrong readings out of three for sensors that have 
independent “ways” of working out a reading is dramatically lower than the 
probability of two wrong readings for those sensor types with a similar way of 
calculating a measurement. Thus, it is desirable to have a validating system 
that uses, to the maximum extent possible, independent methods of 
calculating the current states of an aircraft. 
4.2.4 BADA and TEM 
BADA (Base of Aircraft Data) provides performance operation data and 
aerodynamics parameters for about 151 types of aircraft. These parameters 
are the results of developing a mathematical model for a given aircraft using 
the total energy model (TEM) [152]. Consequently, the parameters can be 
used to check if an aircraft is operating within a set of recommended speed, 
rate of climb or descent (ROCD), or fuel flow. This could, in turn, provide a 
way of validating a current on-board situation in case the data being logged for 
any of these parameters goes beyond safe, recommended, or normal range. 
In this section, this process will be labeled BADA check or “Is exceedance”. 

 
Application to aviation safety 
164 
 
 
 
This type of validation could detect exceedances in real time rather than by 
the end of the trip, as is the case with the one described in [153]. As a side 
benefit, since the checking is performed against recommended operational 
data, commercial airliners would greatly benefit from the resultant fuel saving 
and maintenance, as pilots would be more likely to comply with recommended 
speed, ROCD, and so on. We will expand further on BADA usage as a DSS in 
section 4.4.  
4.2.5 Assumptions and Proposed Design 
 
The diagnostic decision tree network developed in this feasibility study 
is based on two assumptions: 
1. The airplane is in good and airworthy condition such that the source of a 
problem could be traced back to one or two causes at most.  
2. Mathematical aircraft model (called Math Engine) has some impact on the 
calculated parameters of the airplane vector state. This is borne out in 
aerodynamic theory: 
 Wind speed affects ground speed, position, and Euler angles.  
 Control surfaces (for pitch, roll, and yaw) affect ground speed 
position and Euler angles. 
The reasoning of the proposed diagnostic decision tree is a natural extension 
from the two previous assumptions. If any sensor reading used as input to the 
Math Engine (ME) is affected by a malfunctioning, we would expect to find all 
the calculated parameters from the ME to differ from those of the onboard 
sensors (due to the second assumption). Since the probability that this 

 
Application to aviation safety 
165 
 
 
 
“disagreement” is due to malfunctioning of all equipment on-board is 
extremely low (due to the first assumption), the more logical explanation is 
that one of the ME input parameter is wrong. 
Figure 26 shows the proposed algorithm for diagnosing differences in 
readings of different equipment/sub-systems. It starts with a simple check of 
whether every sensor’s reading of the Primary System (PS) is similar to that of 
the Redundant System (RS) and that of the ME. Readings are considered 
similar if the error is within a tolerated value that can be set appropriately. If all 
readings are similar, the confidence that everything is working fine increases. 
Nevertheless, this could be a false negative, as the network might have failed 
to detect anomalies in an equipment reading. Therefore, a more expensive 
test is performed to check for false negative which was accomplished by 
adding “is exceedance” checks, in which the readings from equipment are 
compared with the recommended operation levels taken from BADA.  
 
However, if the readings differ, then the next observation that has to be 
noted is the proportion of disagreed cases that have been detected. If only 
one case of disagreement is detected, it is most likely that the ME output is 
true (this is evident by ME = PS = RS for the other parameters). The reading 
that is in disagreement with the calculated ME value is highly likely to be the 
culprit.  
 

 
Application to aviation safety 
166 
 
 
 
 
Figure 26. The proposed investigation engine 
 
However, all of the readings differing from each other leads to the conclusion 
that one (or two) of the inputs to the ME are incorrect. A check of all the input 
parameters of the ME is needed. It is possible to check the Control Surface 
(CS = pitch, roll, yaw) by comparing its values with those extracted from the 
pilot CS input. Checking the other parameters to make sure they follow the 
same procedure is not implemented in this study. For example, it is fairly easy 
to check if the wind speed is measured correctly by this simple equation:

Where GS is the ground speed, and TAS is the true air speed. Figure 27 
shows a block diagram of the proposed system. 
 
 
4.2.6 Mathematical formulation and analysis 
In this section, the Bayesian network equivalent of Figure 26 is developed. 
In addition, we will derive the mathematical formulation of it. Since Figure 26 
gives a diagnostic tree view of the network, all we need to do is convert it to its 
Bayesian network equivalent. However, it is much easier to think of the 
proposed design as an inference-type Bayesian network because constructing 
a Bayesian network from the point of view of cause-to-effect is easier and 
more straightforward than the other way around, from effect-to-cause.

Let the aircraft vector of states be denoted as   and an individual state 
number n from within the vector as   . Additionally, let   be the vector of 
input variables to the Math Engine and the simulated aircraft in Figure 27. 
There are four tests to perform, as shown in Figure 26, labelled T1 to T4 and 
shown with dashed oval shapes. T1 has four possible outputs depending on 
the similarity between the vectors of states from PS, RS and ME. These are 
summarized in equation 137.

where   is some function that outputs the number of similar states of PS, RS 
and ME. It can be as simple as a threshold detector or as complex as a 
clustering algorithm. In this demonstration, a threshold detector is used. The 
number of similar states can either be as high as n, which indicates that the 
vectors of states are identical, that all but one are identical, that some are 
identical and some are not, or that they may all differ. T2 and T3 have yes/no 
outputs, whereas T4 has three possibilities as in 138:

With these assumptions in mind, the Bayesian network can be plotted as in 
Figure 29.

The three circular nodes represent the output vectors of the primary 
system (PS), the redundant system (RS) and the math engine (ME). Their 
status can be either healthy or faulty and the way the status would be 
determined is through the four test nodes. Test nodes are action nodes, but 
since tests can have probabilistic results conveying the accuracy, or the error 
percentage, they could also be considered as probabilistic nodes. The 
Bayesian equation for Figure 28 is: 
P P ,   ,   ,   ,   ,  3,

systems. Taking a query for the status of the primary system as an example, 
we can write: 
    |  ,   ,   ,         ,   ,   ,   ,    
    ,   ,   ,

Substituting equation 139 into 140 yields:

(141) 
Equation 141 gives the exact inference formula to estimate the status of PS, 
giving the results of the four tests. The same procedure can be followed to 
infer the status of RS. Any of the approximate inference algorithms discussed 
in chapter 2 can also be used. However, the problem regarding the question 
as to where the numbers come from remains to be solved. The answer from a 
Bayesian point of view is to use subjective probability or, on the other end, to 
use statistical data to estimate the required probabilities. The approach 
adopted in this thesis is a hybrid of these two. It starts from a subjective 
degree of confidence to estimate an upper and lower bound that close down 
to the expected average of a variable as the amount of data increases. A 
decision-maker can initially assume that his/her tests are 100% accurate and 

 
Application to aviation safety 
171 
 
 
 
then revise the degree of confidence as collected data prove otherwise. In this 
demonstration, we follow the algorithms of determining the upper and lower 
bounds in chapter 3, algorithm 2 and that exact inference of equation 139 is 
used.   
4.2.7 Experiment Set-up 
 
The demonstration is conducted by setting up a simulation environment 
in MATLAB. The complete aircraft block from AerSim blockset is used to 
simulate an aircraft. The sensors and states outputs were labeled primary 
system (PS) and redundant system (RS), which represent a generalized way 
of identifying a reading from one of two independent sources, for example, a 
barometer or a GPS reading. Since the objectives of this study did not include 
investigating the systematic or environmental causes of malfunctioning 
equipment, but rather aimed to validate the readings, aircraft sub-systems 
(equipment) were treated as black boxes, and errors in equipment readings 
were simulated by the addition of random noise and/or by multiplying a 
reading by a scaling factor. The output of the investigation engine was 
monitored to determine if the faulty equipment in which the error was 
introduced was correctly detected. 
 
To test the operation of the network, scenarios have been created in 
which a malfunctioning equipment event was introduced while the output of 
the investigation engine was logged. The aim of these scenarios was to test 
the accuracy of the proposed investigation engine, and its ability to pin-point 
the faulty equipment whenever a fault was introduced. The first two 
simulations used a deterministic environment in which the investigation engine 

 
Application to aviation safety 
172 
 
 
 
operated at perfect (100%) accuracy and output was either 0 (for “no fault 
detected”), or 1 (for “fault detected”). The sampling frequency was 0.008 
seconds. The purpose of the first two scenarios was to show the improvement 
of the developed FDD over the current procedures, whereas that of the third is 
to show the advantages of CP in comparison to the approaches of scenario 1 
and 2.   
4.2.8 Scenarios 1: Fault in Primary System Pitch 
 
The first scenario run was meant to test the operation of the network 
when simulating a malfunction in the sensor equipment responsible for 
 (a). Pitch (in rad) calculated by the Mathematical Engine (ME). 
 (b). Pitch (in rad) from the Primary System (PS) sensor.  
 (c). Output of the investigation engine, port: Fault in PS Pitch

displaying the current pitch attitude. The simulation time was set to 50 
seconds, and throughout the simulation, the value of the aircraft pitch attitude 
was constantly changed by means of a pilot joystick. Figure 29 (a) shows the 
theoretically calculated pitch altitude, while (b) shows a graph of the pitch 
altitude sensor’s reading. During time 0 to 20.5 seconds, the two values 
resembled each other and the investigation engine’s port: Fault in PS Pitch 
was zero (figure 29 (c)). However, when a malfunction was introduced into the 
primary system’s pitch sensor at time t=20.5 seconds, the investigation engine 
was successful in pin-pointing the faulty equipment. The fault was held for 10 
seconds, during which the investigation engine’s output port “Fault in PS 
Pitch” stayed at 1, producing a positive result for the test scenario. 
4.2.9 Scenarios 2: Fault in Primary and Redundant Speed Sensors 
The second scenario demonstrates the superiority of the network over 
current systems when using two sensors to independently calculate the same 
physical quantity. Once again, the simulation was set up to run for 50 
seconds, and Figure 30 (a) shows the theoretically calculated airspeed values 
against time. Figure 30 (b) and (c) shows the airspeed’s sensor reading on the 
Primary System PS (e.g. the pilot panel) and Redundant System RS (e.g. the 
co-pilot panel) respectively. Before time t=20 second there was no malfunction 
simulated, so the three graphs of ME, PS, and RS airspeed readings were the 
same. After time t=20 second, a malfunction was simulated on both the PS 
and RS sensors so as to indicate the same incorrect reading. Routinely, such 
faults might be hard to detect as, for example, both the pilot and the co-pilot 
would each confirm the same reading ignorant of the presence of a 

 
Application to aviation safety 
174 
 
 
 
malfunction in both systems. Since the mathematical engine relies on 
equations to estimate the correct airspeed value, it will report a dissimilar 
airspeed value which, in turn, is supplied to the investigation engine to identify 
the source of the malfunction. Figure 30 (d) and (e) show output ports “fault in 
PS airspeed sensor” and “fault in RS airspeed sensor” as changing from 0 to 1 
during the time of the fault indicating a successful diagnosis.

4.2.10 
Scenario 3: Faults in more than single equipment 
 
The two previous scenarios demonstrated the performance of the FDD 
algorithm but under single sensor/equipment fault or more than a sensor 
measuring the same quantity. The performance of the system from a 
deterministic and probabilistic point of view can be considered identical if the 
degree of confidence in the test results is high. The conclusion of at most a 
single fault followed our assumption that the aircraft is in good condition. 
However, modern aircraft have many complex systems measuring many 
quantities concurrently and it may be absurd to assume a single fault at any 
given time. Hence, the aim of scenario 3 is to record the performance of the 
network under two or more faults from two or more different equipment. We 
have already demonstrated, in scenario 2, the advantages of using the math 
engine as a third independent source of information in triple checking the 
health of equipment. However, if we assume a deterministic diagnostic tree, 
then we may not be able to deterministically pinpoint the faulty equipment. To 
see this, assume that the registered speed from the primary sensors was 250 
m/s and from the secondary sensor was 250m/s, while the math engine 
indicated that it should have been 180m/s. In this case, we will be inclined to 
belief the data from the math engine. But suppose a second sensor group also 
registered the same phenomenon, where PS=RS≠ME. Once more, we may 
be inclined to consider the math engine’s calculated value as accurate, but if 
that continues then at a certain point we may start to realize that ME is the 
culprit and that PS=RS simply obtains because they are correctly measuring 

 
Application to aviation safety 
176 
 
 
 
what they are measuring. Hence, when we have two or more dissimilarities, 
we will not be absolutely sure about the source of the fault.  
An ordinary probabilistic approach may not perform well because it 
requires the conditional/unconditional probability tables for all of the tests in 
the network. Since the proposed design is essentially novel, such tables are 
not available. In addition, equipment performance data are not standardized in 
any known way for the use of a sample and the labelling of typical data. 
Hence, CP approach seems more suitable than any other.     
The simulation was carried out using the Bayes Net Toolbox for Matlab 
developed by Kevin Murphy [154] for its ability to make exact and approximate 
inferences. Firstly, the system was run for an hour without introducing any 
fault of any type to calibrate for any false positives that may result from 
processing discrepancies between Airsim, ME, and Bayes Net toolboxes. The 
run resulted in nine false positives from where the aircraft was at initialization 
and from times at which a manual hard roll was issued. The initialization 
phase resulted in false positives because the aircraft was initialized at a 
certain altitude, velocity and orientation, but the internal states, momentums, 
power settings, throttle, and control surface were not yet set to yield an aircraft 
in the initialization position, so the aircraft would oscillate for a short time until 
the simulation stabilized. The false positives were removed from the scenario 
results. Afterward, the aircraft was set to run in holding circulating above 
runaway for about four hours, during which faults were introduced and the 
degree of confidence in the reported fault location logged, as in Figure 26. Six 
pieces of equipment from each subsystem were monitored (speed, rate of

climb/ descend, altitude, pitch, roll and yaw). Table 2 shows a summary of the 
results.

The number of simulated faults increased from one to six at an interval of 1 
minutes starting after 15 minutes of the simulation start time. An accuracy of 
100% indicates that the FDD network has successfully pinpointed the source 
of the fault, whereas an accuracy of 66.67% when three faults were simulated 

 
Application to aviation safety 
178 
 
 
 
indicates that the FDD network managed to identify only two correct faults. It 
is quite clear that the network is weaker when the number of simulated faults 
is around three, which is half the total number of simulated sensors. However, 
the performance begins to increase slightly with time, as we see during the 
third and fourth hour, when the only focus of simulated faults was on the 
weaker case. Although scenario 3 provides a proof of concept for how CP 
behaves under a sparse amount of data, the result does not completely prove 
it. This is the case because the simulation was not run for days – or even 
weeks – to ensure that the system will still perform well, but, as the purpose of 
the proposed technique is short-term usage during the first initialization hours, 
the non-necessity of such a scenario is justified. However, due to the 
probabilistic nature of the proposed technique, the simulation should be re-run 
many times and the weighted average of the calculated probabilities should be 
recorded. Due to limitations of time and resources, however, this was left for a 
future extension of the demonstration.  
 
4.3 
Demonstrating an On-board Navigation Decision Support 
System using BADA 
 
 
The second demonstration of this chapter is aimed at creating an 
online, real-time and onboard DSS that can help pilots navigate better, 
understand the bigger picture and enhance the results of the FDD of the 

 
Application to aviation safety 
179 
 
 
 
previous demonstration, on which it is built. Once more, the aim of the 
demonstration is to show successful and meaningful recommendations in real 
time as soon as the system initializes. The underlying DSS utilizes BADA 
operation data as a navigation support system in the sense of estimating 
efficient ranges of operation for speed, rate of climb or descent (ROCD), and 
fuel flow in terms of flight level, current speed, mass, and flight profile. It 
estimates such ranges of operations and uses probabilistic reasoning to 
calculate the beneficial value of the estimated ranges based on the reliability 
of equipment readings. 
4.3.1 BADA Database Overview 
BADA is a collection of text files that lays down operation performance 
parameters, airline procedure parameters and performance summary tables 
for more than 300 aircraft types [97]. It was developed and is maintained by 
the 
European 
Organization 
for 
the 
Safety 
of 
Air 
Navigation 
(EUROCONTROL). The information contained in these files was obtained 
using the mass-varying kinetic approach to aircraft modelling. It models an 
aircraft as a point along with the underlying forces acting upon it which causes 
its motion. Figure 31 [155] shows the structure of the BADA Aircraft 
Performance Model (APM). 

 
Application to aviation safety 
180 
 
 
 
 
 
The model is organized into five sub-models, namely: characteristics, 
actions, motion, operation, and limitations. The arrows represent the 
dependencies between the sub-models. The actions sub-model is used to 
calculate various forces acting on the aircraft, whereas the motion sub-model 
accounts for geometrical, kinematics, and kinetic parts of motion using the 
Total Energy Model (TEM) method. The operations sub-model is used to 
simulate the different operation modes of an aircraft, such as flying with a 
constant Mach number. The limitation sub-model mimics the operational limit 
of the aircraft such as the maximum altitude, throttle limit, and maximum 
airspeed. Finally, the characteristics sub-model contains coefficients that 
characterize an aircraft such as the wing span [152]. Each modelled aircraft is 
parameterized into three text files. First, an Operations Procedure File (OPF) 
holds aerodynamic constants such as thrust, fuel, and drag coefficients.  
Second, an Airlines Procedures file (APF) contains parametric information 
about the recommended speed procedures during different flying phases, and 
third, a Procedure Table File (PTF) represents the recommended operation 
procedures in the form of look-up tables [152]. This demonstration utilizes the

Operations

look-up table of a specific aircraft that is contained within a PTF file as it gives 
the user direct access to performance data without the need to implement the 
complete TEM [97], which in turn reduces the complexity of the developed 
network. 
The PTF file contains the recommended operating producers for airspeed, 
rate of climb/descent (ROCD), and fuel flow at different flight levels of a 
specific aircraft. (An example of a PTF file can be found in [156].) The header 
section of the PTF file specifies general information about the type of the 
aircraft, creation date, speeds, temperature data, maximum altitude and mass 
levels. This is followed by the table of performance data, where the operation 
information is organized into three sections: cruise, climb and descent [152]. 
In this demonstration, a script was written to subtract the performance table of 
a PTF file of a specific aircraft and organize the data in a look-up table that is 
more suitable for analysis by MATLAB. In addition, the script verifies the 
validity of the PTF file by checking for the presence of some permanent text 
within the header section of the file. 
4.3.2 Assumptions and Proposed Design 
We propose a framework that facilitates the base of aircraft data (BADA) 
as a navigation planning decision support system for pilots to make informed 
decision about navigation planning. The decision support system is 
implemented as a software tool to extract performance data of an aircraft type 
from BADA database, integrate with other on-board fault detection and 
isolation 
systems, 
and 
estimate 
the 
beneficial 
value 
of 
these 
recommendations. The designed network presented in this section is an

extension of the diagnostic decision trees described in section 4.2. Figure 32 
shows the structure of the proposed design. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To ensure that the BADA unit receives navigation readings of high 
accuracy, a check for equipment faults is added to the network. The fault 
detection algorithm follows a model-based approach (see section 4.2) 
whereby the measured aircraft states are verified with a reading that has been 
calculated using a simulated aircraft running in parallel to the actual aircraft. 
The simulated aircraft uses the high-fidelity 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) 
model to simulate displacement and rotation of an aircraft in three-dimensional 
space. The 6DoF model is contained within the Math Engine Unit (MEU). The 
states from the aircraft and the math engine block are applied to the Fault 
Detection Unit (FDU), where a state of no fault is assumed if the two data 
sources are identical. Otherwise, the FDU will start a diagnostic procedure to 
isolate the malfunctioning equipment using Bayesian diagnostic decision 
trees. As a result, the BADA Unit (BU) can select the most reliable source of 
Figure 32. Structure of the proposed design 

 
Application to aviation safety 
183 
 
 
 
data to be compared to the recommended operation records, which were in 
turn obtained from the BADA database unit throughout the converter script.  
The BU recommendation algorithm begins by checking for sources of 
reliable readings and the utility associated with making the recommendation. If 
no reliable information could be obtained, the BU will display a warning 
message informing the pilot about the situation. Otherwise, the BU begins by 
detecting the flight phase of the aircraft (i.e. cruise, climb, or descent). BU 
uses the value of the angle of attack, landing gear position and ROCD to 
detect the flight phase. Low ROCD and low angle of attack along with landing 
gear at the up position would indicate cruising phase. Otherwise, the aircraft is 
either climbing or descending. In order to detect which of these the aircraft is 
in, BU uses the ROCD values of the climb and descent from the PTF file as a 
feature search space. The nearest five neighbours to the current ROCD of the 
aircraft is calculated using the k-nearest neighbour algorithm, then the flight 
phase is determined based on basic majority vote. To reduce the amount of 
calculation, BU can be programmed to treat negative ROCD as descending 
indicator and positive ROCD as climbing indicator, which might be beneficial 
in situations in which no PTF file is available. When the flight phase is known, 
the corresponding look-up table for that specific phase is selected to obtain 
the recommended procedure data. If the measured aircraft states are not 
within the tolerated limit of the values recommended by BADA,  the BU will 
inform the pilot about the situation and recommend changing his/her 
navigation parameters accordingly. 
 

 
Application to aviation safety 
184 
 
 
 
4.3.3 The Utility of the Recommendations 
Maintaining high accuracy navigation requires the pilot to be in a state of 
high situation awareness where he or she can evaluate the fidelity of the 
aircraft’s equipment readings and detect cases when an equipment reading is 
unreliable. It has been suggested that the highest level of situation awareness 
can be achieved by a thorough grasp of some key elements that, if put 
together, will synthesize the prevailing status of an environment [7]. Therefore, 
it is valuable to measure the benefit of giving some recommendations 
regarding operation procedures as the information used to derive the 
recommendation itself could be unreliable. The measured benefit would serve 
as a criterion to decide whether a specific recommendation would increase the 
pilot’s situation awareness about his/her environment and, in turn, display that 
recommendation, or that the measured readings are unreliable to the degree 
that no recommendation is possible. To decide which situations would not be 
beneficial with respect to increasing situation awareness, we have used the 
principle of maximum expected utility in probabilistic theory, where each 
decision is associated with a utility function that represents the cost or benefit 
of making some decision. Figure 33 shows the structure of the decision 
network.

Probabilistic variables are represented with the oval shapes labelled R and 
F. The variable R represents equipment reading whereas the variable F 
denotes the probability of detecting a faulty reading. Action (or decision) 
nodes are depicted in the rectangular shapes MEU and BU. The decision 
associated with each node is whether to go down the road of executing the 
block. Finally, the diamond shaped blocks U1 and U2 represent the expected 
utility associated with making decision MEU and BU respectively. Using 
equation 70 (from chapter 2), the expected utility of making the decision U1 is: 
       |    ∑P    |,           |    
 
 
(142) 
Similarly, the expected utility of making the decision U2 is 
       |    ∑P    |,           |    
 
 
(143) 
Using the product rule of probability calculus, equation 142 and 143 can be 
written as: 
       |    ∑P    |,     
P  ,           |    
 
 
(144) 
       |    ∑P    |,     
P  ,           |    
 
 
(145) 
Thus, the overall expected utility is 

 
Application to aviation safety

 ∑P    |,     
P  ,           |    
 
 ∑P    |,     
P  ,           |    
 
 
(146) 
Since reliable recommendation follows the presence of reliable 
equipment readings, the utility of executing the BU will depend on the 
presence of a reliable source of speed, flight altitude, etc. In other words, the 
probability of detecting faulty reading F should be low. Since airspeed in 
modern aircraft is obtained from one or more inertial navigation subsystems 
and one or more navigational reference subsystems, we can assume U2 to be 
0 if all airspeed data sources were unreliable and 1 otherwise. Furthermore, if 
there is (n) identical equipment (for instance: pitot probes), the subjective 
unconditional probability of faulty equipment (X) is: 
P X  fa       
  
(147) 
4.3.4 Experiments Simulations 
Once again, the demonstration is conducted through setting up a 
simulation environment in MATLAB. To test the operation of the network, 
scenarios have been created in which an event of equipment malfunctioning is 
introduced while the output of the BU is logged. Scenarios represent test data 
that can be used to validate system design requirements [157]. In the context 

 
Application to aviation safety 
187 
 
 
 
of aviation safety, the use of scenarios as test data has been widely proposed 
and well documented in the literature as a means of measuring the 
compliance of a design to the requirements of safety standards within civil 
aviation sector [158]. In order to generate a graphical presentation of the BU 
instead of a text-based recommendation, five output ports have been added to 
the BU representing the five possible state/recommendations that can be 
given by the unit. The first port states the detected flight phase represented in 
numeric format in which the numeric value 0 is used to represent the climbing 
phase, 1 to represent cruising, and 2 to represent descending. The second 
port states the availability of reliable airspeed reading, in which 0 represents 
that availability and 1 represents no reliable airspeed data. The following three 
ports are ROCD, True Airspeed (TAS), and fuel flow recommendations 
respectively. Each one of these ports can take the value 1 to represent 
information that is out of the BADA recommendation limit, 0 to indicate 
information that is within the recommended limit, or 2 to indicate that the 
information is not available yet. Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the 
experiment setup. All of the scenarios described below were for the Boeing 
737 aircraft with an initial flight level (FL) of 75 and TAS of 300 knots 
simulated by the JSBSim library of aircraft models. 
4.3.5 Scenario 1: Fuel Flow exceeding normal limit 
The first scenario that was set up in this demonstration was to simulate 
events when fuel flow exceeded the value recommended by BADA. The aim 
of this scenario was to validate the ability of the network to detect anomalous 
fuel flow rate. Anomalous fuel flow rate could be a sign of a much more 

 
Application to aviation safety 
188 
 
 
 
hazardous engine problem or simply an unnecessary added cost. The events 
of this scenario were obtained by changing the aircraft angle of attack as to 
change the flight phase from climbing to descending. Anomalies to the amount 
of fuel flow to an engine were constantly introduced during the scenario while 
the outputs of the BADA unit were recorded. The simulation time was set to 20 
seconds. Figure 34 shows the simulation results. Figure 34(a) shows the 
malfunctioning fuel flow graph of scenario 1. At FL of 75 and TAS of 300 
knots, the recommended fuel flow should be around 210 kg/min during 
climbing phase and about 32 kg/min while descending. Since both values 
were significantly deviated from those recommended values, BU output port 
signalled the value 1 to indicate that the information fell outside of the 
recommended operation limit. This verifies the principle of operation of the 
unit.

4.3.6 Scenario 2: No reliable Airspeed data 
 
The second scenario demonstrates the case in which the airspeed 
measuring equipment is unreliable. The scenario was designed to show the 
BU response to that worst case setup in which the airspeed readings received 
from both the inertial and navigation sub-systems are defective and the fault 
detection unit has identified both systems as malfunctioning.  Figure 35 shows 
the simulation results. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 35 (a) shows one of the malfunction airspeed equipment readings 
(the other equipment reading is identical). The value was dramatically higher 
than expected. Therefore, the BU indicated unreliable data to give a 
recommendation and halt operation. This result proves the validity of the 
decision-making network developed in this demonstration.

Summary 
 
Ensuring a safe journey for passengers is of a high priority in the aviation 
industry. It is an aim that continues to motivate researchers to build more and 
more complex systems and procedures to enhance safety. Early detection of 
faults is a must-have in aviation, not just to ensure passengers’ safety but also 
to decrease maintenance cost and to prevent faults from advancing to a stage 
where an intervention would be useless.  
Chapter 4 presented a novel approach to FDD in aviation, which 
introduces an independent source of measurement that works concurrently 
with the aircraft systems to double check the validity of their status. The 
approach treats every piece of information it collects as doubtful until it is 
double-checked. We showed, with synthetic scenarios, how the proposed 
FDD compare to the state of the art methods and how it can be further 
enhanced using CP approach to a Bayesian network.  
However, detecting faults is not all that is required for a safe flight. The 
pilot also needs to be aware of any problems, as well as their source and 
severity. In addition, too much information could overwhelm pilots and, in turn, 
slow down their responses. Hence, the information about faults and the status 
of equipment should be summarized and presented in an easily 
understandable form. Our second demonstration showed how a database 
developed for calculating trajectory could be modified to work as a DSS. Once

making.

5.  Application to Intensive 
Care Units 
 
 
In the previous chapter, we saw how CP could be applied to aviation 
safety to enhance the performance of a fault detection and determination 
system. In addition, we saw an application of CP to decision-making by 
utilizing BADA as a DSS to draw better navigation plans. The results 
illustrated the feasibility of the CP for both problems. In this chapter, we will 
expand the application of CP to the field of medical informatics, more 
specifically to the monitoring of patients in ICUs.   
 
Unlike the model-based approach of chapter 4, patients cannot easily 
be modelled. While it would be of great scientific value to model how the 
human body functions, this is often too complex to be feasibly accomplished. 
Not only do the functions and interconnections of organs need to be modelled, 
but also their interactions with foreign bodies such as germs. In addition, such 
requires modelling the response of an organ to a medicines, stimuli, or even 
surgical procedures. Moreover, the model should accommodate for all 
possible variations in the human genetic pool and racial traits. Consequently, 
a high fidelity model will be one that makes a suitable trade-off between 
representation power and flexibility. Experts will need to construct a model for 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
193 
 
 
 
each age group, race, sex, and medical condition. Undoubtedly, such 
requirements are too broad to be achievable not only within the scope of the 
thesis but even for big research centres. Researchers have often chosen to 
follow the route of simplifying the model and accepting the loss of generality. 
The approach adopted in this thesis is a data-driven approach. In chapter 2, 
we have seen that the major setback of the Bayesian network was the fact 
that it is model-based and we saw how we could use examples from data to 
come up with a model. However, this approach requires some offline period in 
which the network learns to model itself from the examples before it is ready 
to make inferences. Another phase of training is also required to estimate the 
probability density functions of the various nodes within the network. The goal 
of this chapter is to design a novel system that is available immediately as the 
first data from a patient arrives and is consequently able to make decisions 
regarding patient care and to predict the future evolution of the patient 
condition while still in the ICU.  
As with chapter 4, this chapter begins with a quick literature review of the 
available research in patient monitoring and patient state prediction. Then it 
will introduce the MIMIC II (the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in 
Intensive Care) database. This is followed by a discussion of the proposed 
design and its mathematical formulations. Finally, the experiment setup and 
results will be provided.

Literature Review 
 
 
The biomedical literature is full of research frameworks that adopted 
Bayesian networks to solve various problems. In fact, medicine is one of the 
most active application fields of  Bayesian networks [6]. Since Bayesian 
networks are casually interconnected graphical models, they can be used to 
simplify the modelling process and to incorporate the experience of medical 
experts into the model through cause-to-effect interconnections. In ICUs, BN 
have been used to diagnose the cause of observed symptoms, to make future 
prediction about the state of a patient, and to monitor the stability of  patients’ 
vital signs [6]. Classically, the BN research frameworks in biomedical 
engineering have been dominated by an expert knowledge approach where 
the expertise of medical practitioners are used to construct the model [6]. One 
example of such an approach is the ALARM (A Logical Alarm Reduction 
Mechanism) network [159]. The ALARM network is a diagnostic BN designed 
as a DSS that outputs messages to provide information about possible 
problems. It has 8 connected diagnoses, 16 findings and 13 hidden variables 
[159]. Despite the popularity of the ALARM network, it does not provide a 
means by which it can be generalized or adopted to other problems [6]. In 
addition, it is not quite known how the network would perform when only a 
portion of the parameters is known or if they have been measured irregularly. 
Finally, since the ALARM network is a static BN, it cannot display the temporal 
evolution of patients’ statuses over their staying period in ICU.   

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
195 
 
 
 
 
Newer approaches, such as the BN binary classifiers by Sierra and 
others, use data-driven or a hybrid model and data driven approaches [160]. 
They used a genetic searching algorithm to find the optimal structure of a 
Markov Blanquet BN that can classify ICU patients according to their 
survivability prognosis [160].  While the approach seems sound, the network 
would need an offline phase during which the training examples are batch 
applied to it until it converges to an optimal solution. This requirement sets this 
framework outside the objectives and aims of this thesis.  
 
Ramon and others have compared four data mining algorithms to 
predict the progress of patients mortality risk in ICUs [161]. The four methods 
were Decision Tree Learning (DTL), First Order Random Forests (FORF), 
Naive Bayesian networks (NB) and Tree Augmented Naive Bayesian 
networks (TAN)  [161]. Their approach was to use the change in a monitored 
parameter value rather than the absolute value at a given time [161]. As a 
result, it is not clear how any of the algorithms can distinguish between a 
normal steady value of a stable patient and an abnormal steady one. For 
example, a steady heart rate of 72 may indicate that a patient is in a good and 
stable condition whereas a steady heart rate of 50 may indicate a problem. 
Their results showed the superior performance of the BN [161]. In fact, NB 
scored an accuracy of 85% as compared to the risk level assigned by nurses 
and physicians [161], which makes sense as NB is naturally structured for 
prediction problems. Once again, however, the approach involves a phase of 
training in which the system is not able to make predictions.   

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
196 
 
 
 
Another example of using a Bayesian network for estimating the risk of 
mortality is provided by Mu, Jaglal and Nylon [162]. They used data collected 
from about 13,000 patients who underwent cardiac surgery in six surgery 
institutions in Ontario, Canada  [162]. They then used many potential risk-
indicating factors to construct the network, including age, sex, left ventricular 
function, type of surgery, urgency of surgery and repeat operation [162]. The 
novel aspect of the study may be the six risk factors with which the study 
concluded. However, the study is not of much help for the aim of the thesis 
because it does not provide a generalized algorithm that can be applied to 
other problems with the framework of BN in ICUs. 
Nonetheless, the DBN approach is not by any means a vacant one. Many 
research frameworks suggested DBN for patient monitoring and assessment 
in ICUs. Charitos and others have used DBN to construct a diagnostic network 
for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in ICU patients [163]. A DBN slice 
has 30 variables, of which 6 are input variables, 8 are observed and 16 are 
hidden [163]. Their DBN slice is actually an extension of a static BN 
developed by Lucas and others through expert knowledge [164]. They proved 
the validity of the network using Brier scoring of 20 patients only [164], which 
figure seems very low. In addition, the improvement of the DBN over the BN in 
terms of the averaged receiver operating characteristics, from which it was 
derived, did not seem significant enough.   
Other approaches include feature extraction and clustering into discrete 
risk levels [165], logistic regression [166], neural networks [167], and fuzzy 
logic [168]. Most of these approaches require a phase of training or modelling 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
197 
 
 
 
using expert knowledge. Since the structure is fixed once the training phase is 
over, the amount of data would be great to allow for training a network to 
predict the future state of patients from different age groups, sexes, medical 
backgrounds, race, and geographical regions. One way around this limitation 
is to allow the network to reconfigure itself in real time. The use CP can 
potentially solve the issue of data requirements because it needs less 
information to make decisions than any other method. In addition, due to the 
law of averages, CP could reach the correct estimation of the probability 
distribution function of a variable with time. In turn, CP provides real time 
learning from data as they arrive to the system. 
Overall, the purpose of this section was not to provide an extensive survey 
of algorithms and methods in analysing ICU data but rather to establish a 
context of the use CP as an approach to Bayesian Networks. The work 
presented in this chapter does not necessarily contradict the BN frameworks 
surveyed in this section, as all the CP does is support the decision-making 
and the quantification of probabilities when the amount of information is 
sparse. The import of the proposed system tends more towards the end of 
showing the versatility of the methods proposed in this thesis by mean of 
examples. However, this is not to say that there are no novel contributions in 
the DBN proposed in this chapter. In fact, the novelty comes from proposing 
an architecture that would work best in various situations, would adapt to 
solve various problems, and would present the results of analysis in the most 
meaningful way.

5.2 
The MIMIC II Database  
One of the main objectives of this thesis is to facilitate the making of 
decisions with little available information and the real time evolution of the 
process as more information becomes available. However, it is essential for 
any research to have as much data as possible to validate the predictions of a 
new proposal. In addition, data could be used to achieve a better estimation of 
the unconditional probability that would otherwise become the result of purely 
subjective speculation.  
Usually, biomedical research relies on data collected from hospitals during 
the study period or through a third party. The time limitations of this thesis 
restrict the feasibility of the first choice. The acquisition of clinical data is an 
involved process that requires ethical permission, anonymizing the data and 
cleaning the data. A better choice, from the time management point of view, is 
to use a third party database where most, if not all, of the ethical and technical 
procedures have been carried out. 
One of the widely used databases is the MIMIC (Multiparameter Intelligent 
Monitoring in Intensive Care) database [169]. It has records of more than 
31,000 admissions of more than 25,000 patients, of which around 20,000 are 
adults and 5,000 are neonates [169]. The data was collected in the Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Centre for about 7 years and is currently managed by MIT 
[169]. Typical researches conducted using the MIMIC database include 
predication of mortality rate in patients with kidney disease [170], retrospective 
comparative analysis [171]  and artificial vector modelling [172]. An extensive 
list of publications can be found at the physionet website [173].  

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
199 
 
 
 
 
Essentially, the MIMIC database is comprised of two types of data: 
clinical data that are stored in a relational database and waveforms data 
stored in flat files [169]. However, only 3,000 patients has waveform data and 
only about 2,500 patients have their waveform data associated with the 
clinical data [169].  In addition, many patients’ cases have missing data, noisy 
values and typo errors. Some researchers have developed algorithms to deal 
with the missing data issue, in particular, the waveform data [174]. Others 
suggested applying rules derived from medical experience [170]. While 
dealing with missing data is essential to increase the size of the sample of 
patients under study, it is not essential to this research. Instead, we chose to 
discard any patient if any of his/her records is missing.   
Once the system has calculated the conditional and unconditional 
probabilities of typical patients’ cases using as accurate and clean data as 
possible, they would be used in cleaning and replacing missing data using a 
linear Kalman filter, for instance. In an online scenario, the system can be 
used to distinguish between data that does not make sense, such as a 
disconnected monitor probe that could result in an apparent heart rate of zero. 
In this study, we will be using both the waveform and the clinical data to 
predict various aspects and parameters that are usually monitored in ICUs.

System Overview 
 
As is the case with chapter 4, the patients monitoring system uses 
Bayesian networks to predict, diagnose and analyse the clinical data collected 
during a patient’s stay in a hospital. However, since we are interested in the 
evolution of the patient’s state over time, DBN is used to accommodate for the 
dynamic nature of the problem. Since DBNs are recursive probability density 
estimators, the system can learn from past events to progressively enhance 
its own prediction representation ability of a patient case.  
The novelty of the system comes from several improvements to the state-
of the-art DBN. Firstly, it is available as soon as it is initiated and there is no 
need for prior knowledge, although prior knowledge can be used to enhance 
the performance and accelerate the learning process. Secondly, it does not 
require an offline phase during which the information is batch processed by 
the system to calculate its internal parameters. Lastly, the system is an open 
platform. By that, we mean new parameters can be plugged into the system 
without the need to redesign the system from scratch. This means that each 
parameter is modelled separately and assumed to be independent of the 
others. Since most collected clinical data, such as blood pressure, heart rate 
and temperature are independent, the assumption is valid and applicable in 
many situations. Figure 36 shows a block diagram of the proposed system. 
For clarity, each sub-block is labelled with a number. The following is an 
explanation of each sub-block:

1) The patient’s array of sensors consists of several sensors that gather a 
patient’s vital signs and/or other parameters into the system. Each sensor acts 
as an active listener tuned for a specific parameter. The sensors are to be 
seamlessly integrated into the current state of the art patients monitoring 
equipment, for example: heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure…etc. 
However, in simulations, the data from patients are sequentially retrieved from 
the MIMIC database. The actual acquisition of patients’ clinical data in 
realtime is left for future work in order to use the limited time of the study for 
building and refining the system itself rather than the acquisition of data. 
2) Data logger. A good experimental set-up requires the gathering of as much 
information as possible to be analysed once the experiment concludes. 
Nonetheless, a system running in a production environment would also benefit 
from the logging of events and/or data for debugging purposes.    
3)  State Predictor. The output of the sensors unit is fed to a Bayesian state 
predictor, which works to find the most likely explanation for extraordinary 
band readings, which in turn reduces the rate of false positives. For instance, 
if the heart rate is logged as zero, it would be of great value to be able to tell 
whether this is because the sensor lid has dropped or because the patient’s 
heart has stopped. The Bayesian state predictor uses a Dynamic Bayesian 
Network (DBN) algorithm to compare the current sequence of reading from a 
sensor with the most probable ones. If the readings do not match the most 
probable ones, then the sequence of readings is marked to be anomalous.   
 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
203 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 37 shows the detailed block diagram of the state predictor. It starts by 
calculating the next most probable parameter value to be received from the 
sensors. This is done by calculating the conditional probability of all possible 
next parameter values given that the current one has occurred and taking the 
maximum of them. The same procedure is repeated (n) number of times and 
the results are stored in a temporary storage. Then the calculated probabilities 
for the next state parameter values are compared with the actual ones coming 
from the sensors. If the distance between the predicted next state and the 
actual next state for a sequence of (n) inputs is higher than the tolerance 
threshold, the state predictor will assume an abnormal reading, report it to the 
users, and log the events for further analysis. Otherwise, normal conditions 
are assumed. 
4)  Patient Status Predictor. The data acquired from the physical world is 
now ready for analysis. The block labelled “patient status predictor” uses the 
raw collected data to work out the probability density function (PDF) of every 
monitored parameter using a Bayesian recursive estimator in order to 
calculate the projected future value of each parameter after an adjustable 
amount of time.   
5) Risk Prediction Algorithms. The system can automatically calculate the 
current and/or future score for different types of ICU scoring systems such as

IRIS, SAPS II, SAPS III, and APACHE II, although only the IRIS score is 
calculated during the simulations. The calculation of a score is conducted 
through two stages. A score predictor will calculate the most likely individual 
score of a parameter if the future score is required, and then these individual 
scores are combined in order to derive the overall score. The same procedure 
is carried out to predict other medical conditions such as renal failure, 
infection, or respiratory failure. Figure 38 shows a block diagram of the 
calculation of the IRIS score: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6) The Interpretation unit uses the individual and/or overall score to display 
some recommendations based on a customizable lookup tables stored in a 
knowledge base. It can also be configured to display a recommendation 
based on a diagnostic tree derived from a database of extensive recorded 
patients’ case studies. In addition, a user can define a set of 
recommendations on an individual patient basis, according to a medical class, 
or completely define custom messages from scratch. Finally, users can 
provide feedback from the feedback unit to better enhance the diagnostic tree 
accuracy in real-time.

7) Graphical User Interface. The patient’s status can be monitored through 
the graphical user interface unit. It also provides the user with easy access to 
the configuration of the system and customization of the knowledge base and 
diagnoses as well as viewing of the raw logged date. 
8) User Feedback allows users to provide feedback to the system. The 
feedback can be parametric, such as lab test results that could be needed to 
predict the future state of a patient, or nonparametric, such as the current 
diagnosis (or medical class) of a patient. All the information supplied by users 
is logged and used to enhance the operation of the network. 
9) Server. All the results of the system such as the recommendation and 
predicted values are sent to a server where the data is stored in a secure 
database. Access to the data within the database is provided through a 
server-side script running under a web server. A patient’s state can be 
accessed virtually from anywhere via the internet, if the user has the proper 
permission to do so. The results can be viewed on various types of devises 
including iPhones, iPads, tablets, PCs, and the like. 
 
As stated previously, in order to reduce the computation power, not all of the 
blocks are simulated simultaneously. In the next sections, we will show two 
simulation setups showing the predictors in action along with their accuracy of 
predictions. The network shown in Figure 36 represents the extent of what 
could be accomplished by using CP-equipped Bayesian network, although CP 
is not necessary for the implementation of the system in Figure 36. If one can 
collect enough information to estimate the conditional probability tables 
required for the Bayesian network to operate, then CP is not required. 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
206 
 
 
 
However, the very unavailability, or inadequacy, of such information justifies 
the use of CP. 
5.4 
Mathematical Analysis 
      
The heart of the ICU monitoring system shown in Figure 36 is the 
predictor block, which calls for a good prediction algorithm. A good prediction 
algorithm is one that keeps a record of the current system estimates and 
updates it as new evidence is received [1,p. 571]. In this way, the algorithm 
becomes mathematically efficient, as it does not have to go back through time 
and do the calculations from the start all over again every time new evidence 
is gathered. Such an algorithm is referred to as a recursive estimator [1,p. 
571]. DBNs can be used as recursive probability density estimators if a good 
temporal transition model is constructed. Let X be a hidden state variable that 
is to be estimated and let e be the available evidence on which X is to be 
estimated. Under the Markov assumption, it can be shown [1,p. 572] that X is 
given by: 
P X + |e   +     P e + |X +  ∑P X + |X  P X |e    
X 
 
(148) 
Equation 148 is of the most importance because it shows that the current 
estimate of a variable is the product of the conditional probability of the current 
evidence times the likelihood of X on the basis of all the past evidences. The 
likelihood of the current X is simply a one-step prediction. Therefore, Equation 
148 shows that the estimation of X involves updating its prediction by the 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
207 
 
 
 
newly acquired evidence. Hence, the state of X at time (t+k) can recursively 
be predicted using the following equation [1,p. 573]:  
P X + + |e     ∑P X + + |X +  P X + |e    
X + 
 
(149) 
Hence, the prediction of X at time (t+k) requires only the transition 
model of X [1,p. 573]. In addition, the arrival of new information will serve as a 
training hub that revises the current estimates of the model and keeps it up to 
date. This process is commonly known as filtering, which is the basis for 
estimating the likelihood of a sequence of evidence and for smoothing [1,p. 
571]. One way to compute the likelihood of a sequence of evidences, shown 
in Figure 36 as state predictors, is to use Equation 148 to estimate  Xt and 
then summing out Xt  [1,p. 573]. However, it becomes mathematically 
inefficient as time passes [1,p. 573] so we opted to use the method described 
in the previous section, albeit without mathematical formulation.   
Consider a monitoring system that utilizes four parameters and let the 
parameters be the heart rate (HR), the arterial blood pressure (ABP), the 
oxygen saturation (SO) and the respiration rate (RSP). These parameters will 
serve as the evidence on the basis of which the state of the patient (X) is 
inferred, which is represented by Markovian transition model. Figure 39 show 
how the DBN of such a system can be drawn. Assuming that E is the vector of 
evidence compromising HR, ABP, SO and RSP, the prediction of the state of 
the patient at time t+k can be found using Equation 149 as: 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
208 
 
 
 
P X + + |e     ∑P X + + |X +  P X + |e    
X + 
 
(150) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, such a system violates our requirement to have an open system 
because, if we are to add a new parameter, then the current estimate of states 
will become invalid and will need a considerable amount of time to recalculate 
the estimate in the light of the new parameter. We have also seen that an 
essential requirement of DBN is that its structure should stay fixed. To 
overcome this limitation, we note that under most circumstances the four 
parameters are independent. Therefore, it will prove easier if each parameter 
has its own DBN model, which may be used to predict the future projection of 
its current and past values. Consequently, the prediction estimates coming 
from the individual models are used for further analysis such as calculating the 
future IRIS score or the probability of developing a complication. Hence, the 
DBN will boil down to a simple sensor model where the evidence represents 
the apparent measurement that should be used to infer the real measurement.

The practical benefit of such a model is in cases where the measured data are 
noisy, doubtful and/or irregular. We will denote the apparent measurement 
with a lower-case letter like (e) and the real measurement by an upper-case 
letter like (X). Hence, a typical individual sensor model is shown in Figure 40.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.5 
Experiment Set-up 
 
Although all the data used in this study was real data obtained through the 
MIMIC database, the testing of the system operation and performance is 
conducted by simulation only. Two types of experiments have been carried 
out. The first is by using the MIMIC waveforms portion of the database to 
predict the evolution of patients’ vital signs throughout time. The second 
utilized the clinical data portion of the database to infer the mortality risk of a 
patient about 24 hours in advance.  
In each set-up, patients are randomly assigned into two groups. The first 
group is used to train the network. The training is the simple estimation of the 
conditional and unconditional probability tables of each variable. While this

step is not strictly necessary, as the network can initialize without prior 
knowledge, the result will become more accurate using probability tables that 
makes sense rather than starting from purely subjective speculations, as the 
researcher is not a trained physician. Once the training is done, the second 
group of patients is used to validate the accuracy of prediction. MATLAB is 
used as the simulation environment. The connection to the database is done 
locally through a JDBC driver. The MIMIC database itself is managed by 
postgreSQL. To reduce the latency resulting from database access time, a 
script is developed that retrieves all the required patients’ data and converts 
them to MATLAB binary data. The accuracy of the system is measured using 
various techniques, as will be discussed in the following sections. 
5.5.1 Predicating the IRIS Score 
IRIS (Intensive-care Risk Identification System) is a lookup table used to 
profile the seriousness of patients’ conditions in ICU [175]. It converts a 
physiological parameter to a score of, for example, between 0 and 3, with 0 
representing a stable condition and 3 representing a deteriorating condition. 
An example of an IRIS lookup table is shown below [175].

 The aim of the simulation is to predict the value of the overall IRIS score, 
which is simply the mathematical sum of the individual scores given by Table 
3. The prediction is simply done using equation 148 to predict the projected 
future value of the respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, pulse and oxygen 
saturation SpO2. A sample of 200 patients was used in the study. The 
patients were assigned randomly to training and testing groups. Each group 
comprised 100 patients. Then the system is run for a simulated period of 
10,000 seconds (about 2 hours and 46 minutes). At every second, a prediction 
of the monitored parameter after k seconds is estimated and then compared 
with the actual one. Then the simulation is repeated with a different value of k. 
In this study, we started the prediction period with k= 30 seconds and then we 
incremented the prediction time by 30 seconds until k= 600 seconds. The 
average accuracy of predicting the heart rate for each run is shown in Figure 
41. The average accuracy is calculated as: 
     a

Figure 41. The average accuracy of predicting the IRIS score versus time 
  The time axis of Figure 41 starts at k=30 where the average prediction of 
heart rate is 99.9%. However, the accuracy of prediction drops as the 
predication period increases but stabilizes at k= 8-10 minutes at about 83%. 
There are two reasons for the drop of accuracy. Firstly, as the algorithm 
continues to predict in the future, the next estimated value starts to saturate 
and would stay fixed at a given value during the upcoming prediction cycles. 
In fact, the developed algorithm will halt the prediction as soon as it detects 
that the predicted value is saturated, that is, when it continues to be the same 
for a given number of cycles. The saturation state that is reached by the 
algorithm is known as the stationary distribution [1,p. 573]. The stationary 
distribution reflects the fact that, as the predicated time increases, the odds for 
every possible outcome become equally likely. Secondly, not all the possible 
outcomes of a parameter are equally estimated during training because there 
are always more data in the stable regions than the deteriorating regions. This 
will cause the algorithm to fall back to CP and estimate the upper bound of 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
213 
 
 
 
probability of a parameter. For example, Figure 42 shows the predicted heart 
rate (in red) and the measured heart rate (in blue) versus time for a patient 
case when the prediction time is set to 30 seconds. The two curves coincide 
with each other almost everywhere except around t ≈0, where CP dominates. 
However, at k= 300, the effect of saturation becomes clearer (see Figure 43). 
Although the predicted heart rate diverges from the real measured one at 
these times when the patient heart rate starts changing rapidly, the effect on 
the calculated IRIS score is minimal because it only results in a ±1 error in 
IRIS calculation. An error of ±1 translates into an accuracy of 75%.

The same prediction accuracy is obtained for the other parameters. In 
addition, the results stay valid even if we add a new parameter like the arterial 
blood pressure (ABP). Figure 44 and 45 show the predication of ABP at k=30 
and k=300.

Using Matlab’s GUIDE (GUI Development Environment), a graphical user 
interface (GUI) was built to enable potential users to explore the features of

the demonstration and verify, in realtime, its accuracy. The GUI allows users 
to monitor up to four subjects simultaneously. Each subject can have his/her 
own predefinded IRIS score presets, monitoring time scale and the choice of 
which physiological parameter to plot.  Figure  46 shows a snapshot of the 
developed GUI.  
The versatility of the developed algorithm can be shown in different ways.

that requires users to login before they can use the system. Once logged in, 
they can choose which patient to monitor, switch a physiological parameter to 
the main axis plot, and estimate the IRIS score and the predicted IRIS score. 
Figure 47 show an example of such possibility. It also shows how the 
algorithm can be used to infer the probability of infection and the status of 
monitors. 
 
 
 
5.5.2 Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients with a History of Cardiac 
Surgery.  
 
The second scenario demonstrates the use of the clinical data portion 
of the MIMIC II database. As the clinical data is essentially data filled out 
manually by hospitals staff, it presents different challenges than the waveform 
data portion did. Firstly, clinical data are acquired less frequently than the 
bedside monitors are. While a bedside monitor may sample the data at a 
frequency of 125Hz, the clinical data may only be recorded once per an ICU 
admission, if at all. Secondly, the waveform data are acquired electronically 
whereas the clinical data is acquired from different sources, such as the 
hospital archives, lab test results, free text nursing notes and ECG reports 
[169]. While the challenges of processing electronically acquired data may be 
limited to dealing with noise and missing data due to equipment failure, 
disconnection, or synchronization, data acquired manually through archives 
and reports are more prone to typo errors, mistakes, irregular delay between 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
219 
 
 
 
measuring and recording, or ignorance. In addition, not all the physiological 
variables are samples at the same rate even for the same patients. In some 
cases, a patient’s blood pressure is measured every 15 minutes, and then the 
rate changes to every hour and so on. The way we dealt with irregularities is 
by neglecting patients’ cases where not enough information is recorded or 
where there are many missing or empty variables. Then we re-sampled the 
data at a rate of one sample per hour through linear interpolation. This 
approach may not be the best since linear interpolation assumes the data to 
adhere to linear transition model without any justification of such a model. 
However, the use of other modelling and/or techniques is left for future 
research work. 
The aim of the experiment is to estimate the mortality risk of a patient with 
a history of cardiac surgery about 24 hours before their date of the death. The 
MIMIC II version 2.5 has about 5,200 such patients, which we identified by 
running SQL queries that searched the nurses’ notes for traces that indicate 
the existence of cardiac surgery within the records of the patients. However, 
not all of these patients have enough data to work with. After screening the 
patients with not enough or unclean data and randomly dividing them into 
testing and training groups, we had 1,106 patients for testing the algorithm 
and 2,580 patients for training. The physiological parameters chosen for 
predicting the mortality risk are blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, 
temperature and creatinine level. Figures 48 through 52 show the amount of 
records collected for the sample of patients within the last 24 hours.

Figure 52. The number of records of oxygen saturation measurements of patients in the last 
24 hours of their admission 
It is evident from the five last figures that the number of records per patients or 
per parameters varies significantly. Creatinine levels are mostly measured 
once per admission. We have assumed that the creatinine level per patient did 
not change during the time of admission. Temperatures are measured 6 times 
per the last 24 hours in the patient stay in the ICU, whereas the heart rate, 
blood pressure and oxygen saturation are measured almost every hour. 
Hence, interpolation is not of high concern for the validity of the study since 
patients, on average, have already one record per hour for the potentially 
rapidly changing parameters.  The patients from the training set were used to 
develop the conditional/unconditional probability tables necessary for 
prediction the evolution of these parameters during the last 24 hours of their 
admissions. Since the values of these parameters should be associated with a 
classification space of either survived or died, we used the predicted value to 

 
Application to Intensive Care Units 
223 
 
 
 
search the space of the training sample for the classes of 10 nearest 
neighbours. If these classes are within the survived group, then the patient is 
considered a low risk. Otherwise, the patient is a high risk. The risk factor of a 
patient is calculated using the number of nearest neighbours to the class of 
deceased patients divided by the total Mahalanobis distance to them. Hence, 
the further away the predicted parameters are from the class of deceased 
patients, the smaller the risk will become, and vice versa. The algorithm is 
validated using the testing patients group and then the mathematical average 
of each prediction per the last 24 hours is calculated. Figures 53 and 54 show 
the results obtained during the validation of the algorithm.

Figure 53 shows only the portion of patients from the testing group who were 
discharged from the hospital. The time is displayed in reverse order, that is, 
time 0 means 24 hours before discharge. It is evident from Figure 53 that the 
average risk is below 0.27. In addition, the risk level decreases as the patients 
approach their discharge time. Figure 54 shows the portion of patients who 
have died. The mortality risk associated with them are 3 times higher than that 
of those in Figure 53, which shows a very good isolation of the portion of 
patients with higher risk from those of lower risk. In addition, the mortality risk 
increases as the time of reported death of patients becomes more near. 
Despite the change in the risk level throughout the 24 hours not being 
significant, the difference in the risk level between the two portions (figures) 
proves the validity of the algorithm.

Summary 
 
This chapter presented another application of the CP approach to BN. In 
contrast to chapter 4, which showed application to it using static BN, this 
chapter focused on dynamic BN. It presented a novel approach to the 
monitoring of patients in intensive care units. 
Many research frameworks use artificial intelligence to analyze patients’ 
vital signs in ICU and use these to predict their survivability, manage the 
admission of medicine or make other decisions. The extent of applications that 
researchers are currently proposing falls far beyond the scope of a single 
thesis chapter.  
The focus of chapter 5 was on building systems and algorithms that predict 
the evolution of patients’ physiological variables throughout their stay in an 
ICU, or hospital. The predictions can be utilized in several ways. They can be 
used to determine the likelihood of a sequence of measurements, to make 
decisions, or to estimate the stability of a patient.    
We have presented two experiments using the MIMIC II database. In the 
first experiment, we predicated the evolution of patients’ parameters up to 10 
minutes in advance with an accuracy of up to 99%. In the second experiment, 
we predicted the mortality risk of a group of patients and showed the average 
evolution and levels of risk within each group.

6.  Conclusion 
 
The core objective of this thesis was to enhance the current procedure of 
designing decisions support systems when the available amount of 
information is significantly limited. In addition, it aimed to facilitate a better 
representation of information without falling back on the fallacy of extracting 
knowledge from ignorance or presuming situations in an ad hoc fashion 
without sound justifications. Nonetheless, the thesis took a practical approach 
to the matter at hand by applying the proposed theory to two interesting and 
challenging research areas: aviation safety and patient monitoring in ICUs.  
In chapter 1, we showed that a decision-maker is, in essence, a gambler in 
the sense that every decision made involves an element of uncertainty. 
Unforeseen factors make the outputs of decisions uncertain. When dealing 
with uncertainty, decision-makers often need a method with which to quantify 
the likelihood of an outcome. The theory of probability provides a foundation 
for representing the doubt and trustworthiness of an outcome from both 
subjective and objective points of view. This has found a wide range of 
application in scientific research, from social science to engineering to 
quantum mechanics.  
However, the mere representation of information is not sufficient to make 
decisions because the more decisions that are available at the hands of 

 
Conclusion 
227 
 
 
 
decision-makers, the greater the chance of outcomes that are more 
favourable than the others are. Combining probability with preferences is the 
foundation for the modern theory of decision-making. Preferences are 
expressed in the form of utility functions. Utility is not a semantic equivocation 
of the notion of value but rather a transfer function that maps a decision to its 
relative usefulness. While deriving a good utility function for a given decision 
problem may be controversial and subjective to a certain extent, it is the 
analysis and estimation of probability that take most of the effort. From a 
Laplacian point of view, probability can be estimated objectively just by looking 
at the sample space of an event. However, an analytic approach to the event 
may not be the best way to infer matters of reality, as analytical judgements 
infer nothing more than the relationships between concepts, ideas, and 
meanings. Analytically, the odds of a coin toss landing on heads are the same 
a “yes” answer in an engagement proposal, while in reality we would consider 
such thinking absurd. The frequency interpretation of probability seems to us 
to provide the best answer, because it is objective and is estimated from the 
real world a posteriori. Nonetheless, estimating the probability of events in this 
way requires an extensive amount of data. Therefore, the theoretical 
framework of this thesis has sought to find the best interpretation of probability 
in the context of limited information. 
 
 
 
 

 
Conclusion 
228 
 
 
 
6.1 
Meeting the objectives 
In order to meet the objectives of this thesis, both theoretical and practical 
approaches were adopted. The main objective is to find a better framework 
that can fully hold the expectations of decision-makers in making better 
decisions under sparse knowledge or in time-critical situations where the 
availability of information begs for more time than a decision-maker has.  
Firstly, the common approach to decision-making, and in turn knowledge-
based decision support systems, is to use probability theory backed by the 
utility functions to come up with the expected utility of making a decision. This 
approach was necessary if the designed DSSs in this research were to remain 
compatible with the current state of the art DSS. In addition, the research 
result proposed in this thesis should integrate to the repositories of science in 
a way that other researchers can make use of it. Hence, the approach should 
not deviate much from the direction of the current arrow of designing DSS. 
Secondly, as the theory of probability is accepted as the main framework 
for 
representing 
knowledge 
with 
uncertainty, 
we 
analyzed 
many 
interpretations of probability in order to find the most suitable one that works 
with as little information available as possible without falling back on a strictly 
analytical approach or ignorance. A common criterion for assessing an 
interpretation of probability is given by Salmon (see chapter 3). It has three 
aspects, which emphasise the importance of usefulness, admissibility and 
ascertainability of an interpretation. We have analysed several candidates 
from many philosophical and mathematical approaches to the analysis of 
probability. These range from the Laplacian interpretation to the logical to the 

 
Conclusion 
229 
 
 
 
comparative probability. The choice made was to use the comparative 
probability approach because it offered the best way to represent knowledge 
in circumstances in which little information is available, it could be made 
compatible with the Kolmogorov axiomatic probability, and it has many 
modelling options from which one can choose. 
Thirdly, we surveyed the research done in the theory of comparative 
probability, its axioms, and application to computer science. We found that CP 
has been used for at least two purposes. The first purpose was as a 
standalone interpretation of probability that rivals all the quantitative probability 
theories. The second was a relaxed approach to quantitative probability and, 
to some extent, to provide a justification of the modern Kolmogorov axiomatic 
probability. The choice between the two approaches to CP was based on the 
requirements laid down in section 3.3.1. The requirements aimed at 
compatibility with other DSS and to utilize the strongest results of the 
Kolmogorov axiomatic probability, namely: the law of strong numbers and the 
central limit theorems. Hence, the second approach to CP proved more 
promising for the aims of the thesis. 
Fourth, we strengthen the requirements of the best-fit theory with 
assumptions that will secure a place for the proposed theory in the current 
frameworks of both CP and KP research and ensure that probability continues 
to be considered the very guide to life. We assumed probability to be 
objective, just as the frequency interpretation of probability is. Probability 
should be inferred from data a posteriori, not from the space of possibilities. If 
no data exists, probability still exists but its objective value is unknown. That 

 
Conclusion 
230 
 
 
 
means that CP is nothing more than a way of representing how much 
knowledge we attain about reality. This knowledge can be as high as an exact 
replica of reality or as low as a basic outline of it. As the amount of data 
acquired from an experiment increases, the probabilities of its outcomes are 
quantified using the frequency approach to probability. That will make the 
proposed theory compatible with the state of the art DSS as the probability 
calculated by it matches that of most frequently adopted approach.  
Fifth, we used the Chernoff bounds to come up with a novel approach to 
updating probability bounds between successive experiment results. Chernoff 
bounds were used as upper and lower estimates of probability at a given 
experiment while taking into account all the previous experiment results. As 
the number of experiments increases, the gap between the upper and lower 
bounds becomes smaller until it approaches the expectation of the outcome of 
the experiment. The expectation of an experiment is nothing other than its 
probability. Hence, a mathematical foundation between CP and KP was 
established with a dynamic nature that puts CP as a foreground methodology 
to evaluate KP. 
Sixth, we recognized that even with the availability of a simple approach to 
representing knowledge, the size of the joint probability tables may become 
too large to process, so we used a Bayesian network to simplify the 
processing of probabilistic queries and reduced the amount of mathematical 
backgrounds required to answer them.  
Seventh, as probabilistic decision support systems work on averages, it 
would be unfeasible to attempt to justify the principles of the proposed 

 
Conclusion 
231 
 
 
 
approach using an example or two. Instead, we adopted two approaches to 
tackle the issue. Firstly, we used scenario-based validation. Scenarios are 
ways of generating test data, which can be used to validate system design 
requirements. The second approach was the ability of the system to predict an 
output with high accuracy. We have shown examples of the first approach in 
chapter 4 and the second approach in chapter 5.  
Eighth, we suggested two new enhancements to the detection and 
isolation of faults in aviation and to the optimising the navigation planning (see 
chapter 4). In the first experiments, we proposed a new method for detecting 
faults that should overcome any limitations that result from using majority vote 
coming from primary and redundant systems. Whereas, in the second 
experiment, we proposed a novel application to the BADA database as a DSS 
for navigation planning. Both experiments where implemented with CP to 
show the usefulness, admissibility and ascertainability of CP. 
Ninth, an innovated ICU patient monitoring system was designed (see 
chapter 5). The novel system outperforms all current monitoring systems in 
terms of its versatility and prediction capabilities. We have shown how it can 
be used to predict the evolution of patients’ physiological parameters over 
time and how it can predict the mortality risk in patients with a history of 
cardiac surgery even 24 hours before patients’ date of death. 
These nine points show the development of the reasoning according to 
which this research was conducted, starting from defining the research 
question to documenting the results. The research method dictates that a 
good theory should be able to predict some observations that can be 

 
Conclusion 
232 
 
 
 
measured and compared to what the theory proposes. In the light of such 
requirements, it is the belief of the author that the thesis stands on very solid 
grounds with respect both to meeting the objectives and verifying the 
soundness of its theory. 
6.2 
Future Work 
 
While an extensive amount of work has been put into this thesis in terms of 
both theoretical analysis and practical implementation, there are still some 
research questions and opportunities waiting to be fulfilled.  The requirements 
and objectives of this thesis made it clear that the proposed theory should be 
integrable to science and that it should establish a context for the current 
frameworks of various areas in artificial intelligence, aviation and biomedicine. 
As such, it will become open to opportunities and criticism that extend far 
beyond the simple mean of two different applications and peer review process 
of all the papers published during the time of conducting this study.  
On the opportunity side, the monitoring system described in chapter 5 has 
been filed for a patent in the UK. This has made possible a collaboration 
between Manchester University and Rinicom Ltd. In addition, the fault 
detection and isolation method described in chapter 4, along with the 
utilization of BADA network, enabled the School of Computing and 
Communication Systems at Lancaster University to secure funded research in 
the SVETLANA project to enhance the current procedures and performance of 
flight analysis programs. It was originally conducted in a contract to RNC

233 
 
 
 
Avionics Ltd through the North West Development Agency Voucher Award. In 
addition, the work is continuing to apply CP to various methods in online 
clustering analysis, such as the Evolving Takagi Sugeno fuzzy model. In 
addition, it has been partially applied to noisy audio signal classification but 
the results are far away from complete.  
One the criticism side, the major limitation of the work is the assumption of 
independent variables while using Chernoff bounds. This is, in fact, a limitation 
of Chernoff bounds. Proposed future directions of work would be to convert 
the dependent variables to independent, but no work has been done towards 
that yet. It will be of great value to find a way to extend the results of this 
thesis to dependent variables as well as to other types of random variables. 
Moreover, it will be of value to bring the MIMIC II up to its full potential by first 
finding a better way to clean up the data and replace missing information, and 
second to extend the open platform architecture proposed in chapter 5 for fast 
prototyping and deployment.

6.3 
Final Remarks 
 
As the case with any novel proposal, the comparative probability approach 
proposed in this thesis is not yet complete. The best way to show the power of 
it is through applying it to a wider range of applications and engineering 
problems while ironing out any issues that arises along the way. While this 
thesis worked as proof of concept for CP application to DSS and artificial 
intelligence in general, it is the belief of the author that it has achieved its 
objectives and still maintaining the de facto interpretation of probability intact. 
After all, it would not be of benefit to the scientific community to propose the 
seizure of their very best guide to life.
