Foreword I
Uncertainty is all pervasive—whether it relates to everyday personal choices and
actions, or as background to business and policy decisions, or economic and climate
predictions. In recent times, few things have attracted as much attention as the
uncertainty surrounding the ﬁnal whereabouts of MH370.
How to deal scientiﬁcally with uncertainty? Put simply, on the one hand there
are events or outcomes of interest that we don’t know; on the other hand, pieces of
information that we judge relevant in some sense that we do know. We need to
assess what we believe about the unknowns, given the knowns.
Formalising our measure of uncertainty in terms of probabilities, the scientiﬁc
approach is encapsulated in the so-called Bayesian statistical paradigm, in which
beliefs about the unknowns are quantiﬁed by a probability measure conditional on
what we know.
But typically, our state of knowledge itself gets modiﬁed over time and a method
is therefore needed to reﬁne and update beliefs as new information is acquired and
assembled. The logical, mathematical rule for carrying out this updating is Bayes
theorem, hence the term Bayesian Methods to describe the analytic and computa-
tional toolkit that has been developed for updating beliefs as evidence changes or is
added to.
It is this toolkit that has been employed in the search for MH370 and this
fascinating book provides a blow-by-blow case account of how the various strands
of evidence have been brought together to give an overall probabilistic assessment
of the ﬁnal whereabouts of the plane.
This has been an extremely complex task and the authors are to be congratulated
on setting out systematically and coherently the science and mathematics driving
the evidential equations. But, in addition to the complex modelling there remains
the task of pulling out the Bayesian probability messages from the tangle of data
that has been assembled. The computational methods for achieving this are of
relatively recent origin and, on a personal note, I am delighted to have played a
small part, with Dr. Neil Gordon, in the signal processing revolution that is now the
particle ﬁlter method of analysis.
v

Dr. Gordon and his colleagues have employed these methods to provide a
marvellous case study demonstrating the power of mathematical modelling and
computation to attack one of the most intractable uncertain puzzles of recent times.

Foreword I

Foreword II
The disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines ﬂight MH370 from air trafﬁc control
radar on the evening of 8 March 2014 with 227 passengers and 12 crew on board
was a tragedy and remains a mystery until we are able to locate the ﬂight recorder or
the wreckage. Only then can we unravel what actually occurred.
Initially, the multinational search and recovery effort was focused on the Gulf of
Thailand and the South China Sea. However, following closer analysis of Inmarsat
data and ﬂight path projections the search shifted to the Indian Ocean.
The Malaysian government accepted the Australian government’s offer to take
the lead in the search and recovery operation in the southern Indian Ocean.
Australia, led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), took responsi-
bility for deﬁning the underwater search area in 28 April 2014.
The Defence Science and Technology (DST) Group, being the only Australian
government agency with the combined knowledge and experience in the scientiﬁc
disciplines to support the search for MH370, became involved from May 2014.
Defence scientists contributed a range of expertise across a spectrum of technolo-
gies to the search: underwater acoustics, satellite communication systems and sta-
tistical data processing.
DST Group’s position as a trusted government adviser with stewardship of the
full range of defence technologies has been critical to our ability to contribute to the
multi-agency—and multinational-search. Our ability to provide high quality,
internationally respected, rapid response is built on our deep foundational research
capability. Our support to the MH370 incident is an example of scientiﬁc research
feeding directly into an active operational search.
The quest for the MH370 demonstrates our ability to ‘work the full problem’
with a team of internationally-recognised experts contributing to the ATSB working
group. Indeed, DST Group is proud to have been able to contribute its
world-renowned expertise to the ATSB-led search. However, this book is not about
the search for MH370. Rather, it focuses on the work to deﬁne the search zone.
We are particularly fortunate to have Dr. Neil Gordon leading the DST Group
team. Dr. Gordon is recognised internationally as an expert in statistical data
vii

processing and, in particular, the dynamic Bayesian estimation methods deployed in
this activity.
Working alongside Dr. Gordon are other Defence scientists—Dr. Samuel Davey,
Dr. Mark Rutten and Dr. Jason Williams who are all experts in target tracking and
multi-sensor fusion, and Dr. Ian Holland who specialises in satellite and wireless
communications.
DST Group’s expertise and unique capabilities will continue to contribute to the
ongoing search for the MH370, led by the ATSB and in collaboration with other
Australian and international agencies.

Introduction
On 7 March 2014 at 16:42,1 Malaysian Airlines ﬂight MH370 departed from
Kuala Lumpur (KL) International Airport bound for Beijing. There was a total
of 239 persons on board (227 passengers and 12 crew). The aircraft was a
Boeing 777-200ER registered as 9M-MRO. The aircraft lost contact with Air
Trafﬁc Control (ATC) during a transition between Malaysian and Vietnamese
airspace. The last recorded radio transmission from MH370 was at 17:19. Over
the following days, an intensive air and sea rescue search was made around the
last reported position of the aircraft in the Gulf of Thailand without success. It
then became clear that satellite communication messages between the aircraft
and one member of Inmarsat’s constellation of geosynchronous satellites were
crucial to deﬁning the search zone for the aircraft. Satellite communication systems
involve transmissions between multiple terminals using a satellite. The aircraft
9M-MRO communicated with the Inmarsat ground station in Perth, Western
Australia, via the Indian Ocean Region satellite Inmarsat-3F1. The data available for
MH370 is mostly comprised of approximately hourly “handshake” transmissions
initiated by the ground station for aircraft that have not communicated in the
preceding hour. No explicit information relating to the aircraft terminal location is
contained in the messages; however, the messages contain metadata which can be
processed to produce estimates of the ﬂight path and ﬁnal location.
Inmarsat conducted a rapid and innovative analysis of the data which placed the
aircraft in the Australian search and rescue zone on an arc in the Southern part of the
Indian Ocean. On 17 March 2014, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority took
responsibility of the search and rescue operation. Subsequently the Joint Agency
Coordination Centre (JACC) was established on 30 March 2014 to coordinate the
Australian Government’s support for the search and over the following weeks an
intensive aerial and surface search was conducted by an international team.
1All times are given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in format hh:mm:ss. Local time in
Malaysia and Western Australia is 8h ahead of UTC and local time in West Indonesia is 7h ahead

Introduction
On 28 April 2014, the aerial search concluded and the search moved to an
underwater phase. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) took respon-
sibility for deﬁning the underwater search area. The ATSB convened a ﬂight path
prediction working group in order to bring together experts in satellite communi-
cation systems and statistical data processing and apply novel data analysis tech-
niques to estimate the most likely ﬁnal location of MH370. This working group
consisted of representatives from the following organisations: Air Accidents Inves-
tigation Branch (UK); Boeing (US); Inmarsat (UK); National Transportation Safety
Board (US); Thales (UK); and the Defence Science and Technology (DST) Group
(Australia). The working group developed new methods to analyse the Inmarsat data
and validated those methods. The ATSB released a report summarising the ﬁndings
of the working group in August 2014 [3] and have subsequently released updates in
October 2014 [4] and December 2015 [5].
In this book we detail the statistical approach adopted by the DST Group team
to analyse the available data and produce a probability density function (pdf) of
the accident aircraft’s ﬁnal location. In Chap.2, we start by detailing a summary of
the events and listing of the available data. In Chap.3, we describe the Bayesian
framework, upon which our method is formulated. This approach requires several
ingredients. The ﬁrst of these is a prior distribution; this is built on the primary
radar data described in Chap.4. The second ingredient consists of a set of likelihood
functions detailing how the available measurements are linked to the aircraft state;
the measurement models and error statistics are characterised in Chap.5. The ﬁnal
ingredient is a stochastic model describing the possible dynamic trajectories of the
aircraft. Chapters6 and 7 describe our models for aircraft dynamics during cruise and
manoeuvre respectively. The resulting set of (prior, likelihood, dynamics) enables
us to calculate the probability distribution of aircraft trajectories. However since the
models are nonlinear and non-Gaussian we are required to use numerical methods for
the calculation; our particle ﬁltering approach is described in Chap.8. The Bayesian
method that was developed has been validated against a number of earlier ﬂights of
the accident aircraft 9M-MRO, where accurate measurements of the aircraft loca-
tion were available from the aircraft’s logging system. These results are detailed in
Chap.9. The method has also been applied to the data available for the accident ﬂight;
the resulting probability distribution, which deﬁnes the search zone, is described in
Chap.10. The search zone is deﬁned by combining our pdf from the analysis of
the satellite data with a kernel describing the distribution of aircraft motion during
descent, which was deﬁned by expert accident investigators from the ATSB. Thus,
any adjustment to the assumptions made about the descent (and hence the kernel
describing its distribution) yields a change to the search region. Finally, in Chap.11,
we discuss on-going work including the impact of the ﬂaperon wreckage discovery
on Reunion Island.
Being statistical in nature, this book seeks to identify aircraft paths that are most
likely, given models which incorporate sensor measurements, commonly observed
commercial aircraft motion, and air transport safety investigator and manufacturer
expert advice and assessments. The goal is not to identify the complete and exhaus-
tive set of all possible aircraft paths, but rather the subset of those trajectories that
are most probable. The area covered by the set of end-points of all possible paths is

small probability. In determining how to allocate ﬁnite search resources, priority
is directed to the area containing the highest probability trajectories. The proposed
method incorporates a rich variety of possible paths, and calculates a probability
distribution based on the well-established, rigorous Bayesian toolkit, which auto-
matically trades the complexity of the model against the match to the observed
measurements.

indicates the likelihood, with red being most likely, and blue being least likely. The
black rectangle shows the indicative search area as at November 2015. Full details
can be found in Chap.10. In order to orient the scale of the search being undertaken,
the area of the indicative search region shown in Fig.1.1 is 100,000km2. In contrast,
the bounding region considered in the search for Air France ﬂight 4472 was a disc
with radius 40nm [40], corresponding to an area of 17,000km2.
The procedure used to generate the result in Fig.1.1 was validated by applying the
identical process to other ﬂights for which the location was known. The ﬂights exam-
ined included four ﬂights for the same aircraft (9M-MRO) involved in the accident, as
well as two others that were in ﬂight at the same time as the accident. The communi-
cations logs for these ﬂights were down-sampled to emulate the information available
on the accident ﬂight. An example of the result is shown in Fig.1.2. The white line
shows the true path taken by the aircraft, while other coloured lines show potential
trajectories, coloured by their probability, again with red indicating the most likely
paths and blue indicating the least likely. The probability distribution at the time of
the ﬁnal measurement is shown as a red line, with the likelihood encoded through
the height above the earth.
Ten different subsets of measurements were used from each of the six ﬂights
to make a total of 60 validation experiments. In all cases, the true ﬁnal aircraft
2Air France Flight 447 disappeared over the South Atlantic Ocean on 1 June 2009. The initial
underwater search consisted of three phases over approximately one year. After the third phase of
the search, US company Metron conducted a Bayesian analysis of the available data. Debris was
found in April 2011 close to the ﬁnal reported location of the aircraft.

location was contained within the 85% probability region. This indicates that the
probability distribution produced by the method is slightly conservative, otherwise
only around 50 of the 60 experiments should be in the 85% region. This is because
the dynamics model allows for a wider range of aircraft manoeuvres than are
actually experienced by typical commercial ﬂights. Such a model is appropriate
because the accident ﬂight was not a typical commercial ﬂight. Full details of the
validation experiments can be found in Chap.9.

Chapter 2
Factual Description of Accident
and Available Information
The detailed chronological factual statement of known information about ﬂight
MH370 is given at [35]. A brief summary is given here sufﬁcient to put the analysis
in the rest of the book in context.
On 7 March 2014 at 16:42, ﬂight MH370 departed from KL bound for Beijing;
this is marked as event 1 in Fig.2.1. Initially, everything about the ﬂight proceeded
as normal. The Mode S transponder system on-board the aircraft was responding as
expected to interrogation from the ATC Secondary Surveillance Radar up to the time
when it was lost on the ATC radar screen at 17:21:13, marked as event 4. No mes-
sage was received from the aircraft to report a system failure. Similarly the on-board
Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) reported as
expected at 17:07:29, this event is marked as 2 in Fig.2.1. This message contained a
collation of six reports generated at ﬁve minute intervals by the system from 16:41:43
until 17:06:43. These reports contained information about the aircraft position and
motion such as latitude, longitude, altitude, air temperature, air speed, wind direc-
tion, wind speed, and true heading. The ACARS position reports are scheduled to
be transmitted at thirty minute intervals during cruise. The next scheduled report at
17:37 was not received. The last recorded radio transmission with the crew of MH370
occurred at 17:19:30 as the aircraft was instructed to contact Vietnamese ATC on
leaving the Malaysian Flight Information Region. This communication is marked
as event 3. At 17:39:06 Vietnamese ATC contacted KL ATC to query the where-
abouts of MH370, who initiated the efforts of several countries’ ATC to establish the
location, without success. Malaysian military radars were subsequently able to show
primary radar returns associated with MH370 deviating from the ﬂight plan almost
immediately after the loss of Secondary Surveillance Radar at 17:21:13 by making
a left turn to end up travelling in a South Westerly direction. Radar returns show
the aircraft travelling back across Malaysia before turning near Penang Island and
travelling in a North Westerly direction up the Straits of Malacca. The ﬁnal primary
radar return was recorded at 18:22:12, which is marked as event 5 in Fig.2.1.

The ACARS system also provides message communication between the aircraft
and its ground base. At 18:03:23 Malaysian Airlines Operations Centre sent a mes-
sage asking the crew to contact Vietnamese ATC immediately. The downlink message
showed that this failed to reach the aircraft. The message was auto transmitted every
two minutes until 18:43:33 with no success [35]. The next communication on the
SATCOM system was a log-on request from the aircraft at 18:25. This communica-
tion contains no location information from the aircraft but it does however contain
timing and frequency metadata which turn out to be crucial in estimating where
MH370 went after the ﬁnal radar return at 18:22:12. The timing measurement is
called the Burst Timing Offset (BTO) and the frequency measurement the Burst
Frequency Offset (BFO). At 18:39:52 there was an unanswered attempt to call the
aircraft from ATC on the ground to air telephone link. The failed communication
data log contains frequency but not timing metadata.
If there has been no SATCOM activity for sixty minutes then the ground station
automatically initiates a handshake conﬁrming presence of the aircraft. If the air-
craft receives this query then an automatic response is sent indicating that it is still
logged on to the SATCOM network. These handshake responses contain both tim-
ing and frequency metadata. Handshake messages occurred at 19:41:00, 20:41:02,
21:41:24 and 22:41:19. At 23:15:58 there was a second unanswered attempt at
a satellite telephone call, again giving frequency metadata. There was a ground
station initiated handshake at 00:10:58 (timing and frequency metadata). Finally,
at 00:19:29 the aircraft SATCOM system initiated another log-on request and this
was the last SATCOM transmission received from the aircraft. Due to its timing,
this log-on request is believed to correspond to fuel exhaustion and subsequent

Measurements marked with an asterisk are available but cannot be used as discussed in the text
activation of the auxiliary power unit [5]. There was no response to the ground
station initiated handshake request at 01:15:56. The log-on messages at 18:25 and
00:19 contain BFO measurements but the equipment was not in steady state. The
values of the BFO measurements were deemed to be unreliable at these times and
cannot be used.
The key pieces of information available to us to estimate the MH370 ﬂight path
are the ﬁnal radar detection at 18:22:12 and the timing and frequency metadata
associated with the infrequent SATCOM messaging that subsequently occurred up
until 00:19. Table2.1 summarises the available measurement data. The messages at
18:25 and 00:19 occurred during transient phases of operation for the SATCOM
equipment so the BFO values reported for these times cannot be used. In the
next two chapters we describe the Bayesian approach, and then how the satellite
communication system works and how the timing and frequency metadata can
be related to aircraft location, allowing us to build a likelihood function for our
Bayesian analysis.

Chapter 3
The Bayesian Approach
Bayesian inference methods [9] provide a well-studied toolkit for calculating
a distribution of a quantity of interest given observed evidence (measurements).
As such, they are well-suited for calculating a probability distribution of the ﬁnal
location of the aircraft given the data available from the Inmarsat satellite
communication system. The resulting probability distribution is essential to
prioritise search efforts. In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to Bayesian
methods. We assume a reasonable background in probability theory; the interested
reader is referred to excellent resources such as [8, 9, 10, 18, 36, 39, 43] if further
detail is desired.
The required probability density function (pdf) is the probability of the aircraft
location given the available data. Bayes’ rule deﬁnes a method to calculate this pdf
using prior information, including knowledge of how aircraft move, and a model of
how the measured data relate to the aircraft location and velocity. Mathematically,
Bayes’ rule is
p(x|z) = p(x, z)
p(z)
(3.1)
= p(z|x) p(x)
p(z)
(3.2)
=
p(z|x) p(x)

p(z|x′) p(x′)dx′
(3.3)
where the elements are:
1. x is the random variable, or the state, which is the quantity of interest (e.g., the
position of the aircraft);
2. z is the measurement (e.g., the Inmarsat satellite communication data, which
provides some form of positional data);
3. p(x) is the prior pdf of the state (not incorporating the measurement, e.g., based
on historical data);

The Bayesian Approach
4. p(z|x) is the pdf of the measurement conditioned on the state (e.g., this may be
constructed by observing the distribution of measurements in cases where the
state is known);
5. p(x|z) is the conditional pdf of interest (the posterior pdf), describing the distribu-
tion of state (e.g., aircraft location) taking into account the observed measurement.
The posterior probability density is based on the accumulated Inmarsat satellite
communications data as well as all available contextual knowledge on the sensor
characteristics, aircraft dynamic behaviour and environmental conditions and con-
straints. The method is based on the state space approach to time series modelling.
Here, attention is focused on the state vector of a system. The state vector contains
all relevant information required to describe the system under investigation at a given
point in time. For example, in radar tracking problems this information would typi-
cally be related to the kinematic characteristics of the aircraft, such as position,
altitude, speed, and heading. The measurement vector represents noisy observations
that are related to the state vector. For example, the distance and bearing angle
between the sensor and the object being measured. The state-space approach is
convenient for handling multivariate data and nonlinear, non-Gaussian processes;
it provides a signiﬁcant advantage over traditional time series techniques for these
problems; and has been extensively used in many diverse applications over the last
50 years [7]. An excellent summary of Bayesian techniques for state space models
is given by [36].
In order to proceed, two models are required: ﬁrst, the measurement model relates
the noisy measurements to the state; and second, the system or dynamic model
describes the evolution of the state with time. The measurement model used for BTO
and BFO metadata is deﬁned in a probabilistic form in Chap.5. The dynamic model
used to deﬁne the behaviour of the aircraft is deﬁned in Chaps.6 and 7.
If the measurement model and the system model are both linear and Gaussian,
the optimal estimate can be calculated in closed form using the Kalman ﬁlter [25].
If either the system or measurement model is nonlinear or non-Gaussian, the pos-
terior pdf will be non-Gaussian and standard analysis with a Kalman ﬁlter will
be suboptimal. This results in the need for approximate computational strategies
and the approach adopted in this study is introduced in this chapter. The appli-
cation of the measurement and dynamics models to this approach is described in
Chap.8. The computational approach proceeds in essentially two stages: prediction
and update. The prediction stage uses the aircraft dynamic model to step from the
state pdf at one time to the pdf at the next time. The state is subject to unknown
disturbances, modeled as random noise, and also unknown control inputs, such as
turn commands, and so prediction generally translates, deforms, and broadens the
state pdf. The update operation uses the latest measurement to modify (typically to
tighten) the prediction pdf. This is achieved using Bayes theorem, (3.3), which is the
mechanism for updating knowledge about the state in the light of extra information
from new data.

3.1 The Problem and its Conceptual Solution
13
3.1
The Problem and its Conceptual Solution
To deﬁne the problem of nonlinear ﬁltering, let us introduce the state vector
x(t) ∈Rn, where n is the dimension of the state vector. Here t is continuous-valued
time. The state evolution is best described using a continuous-time stochastic differ-
ential equation, sometimes speciﬁcally referred to as an Itô differential equation [23].
However, it is often more convenient to sample this at discrete time instants, in which
case xk ≡x (tk) represents the state at the kth discrete sample time. The elapsed time
between samples k = tk −tk−1 is not necessarily constant. The state is assumed to
evolve according to a continuous-time stochastic model:
dx(t) = f (x(t), dv(t), t, dt) ,
(3.4)
where f(·) is a known, possibly nonlinear deterministic function of the state and v(t)
is referred to as a process noise sequence, which caters for random disturbances in
the aircraft motion.
A sensor collects measurements, which are a possibly nonlinear function of the
state. Measurements occur at times tk, for k = {1, 2, . . . K}. The kth measurement
is denoted zk ∈Rm where m is the dimension of the measurement vector. The mea-
surements are related to the state via the measurement equation:
zk = hk (xk, wk) ,
(3.5)
where hk(·) is a known, possibly nonlinear function and wk is a measurement noise
sequence. The noise sequences v(t) and wk will be assumed to be white, with known
probability density functions and mutually independent. The initial state is assumed
to have a known pdf p (x0) and also to be independent of noise sequences.
We seek estimates of xk based on the sequence of all available measurements up to
timetk,deﬁningthemeasurementhistoryZk ≜{z1, . . . zk}.FromaBayesianperspec-
tive, the problem is to recursively construct the posterior pdf p (xk|Zk). In principle,
the pdf p (xk|Zk) may be obtained recursively in two stages: prediction and update.
The prediction stage steps from the pdf of x at time tk−1, p (xk−1|Zk−1), to the pdf
at the next time, p (xk|Zk−1), not incorporating any new measurements. The update
stage takes the predicted pdf p (xk|Zk−1) and incorporates the new measurement zk
occurring at time tk to obtain the updated pdf p (xk|Zk). If there is a requirement
to evaluate the pdf at time t for which there is no measurement then this pdf is the
predicted pdf and no update step needs to be performed.
3.1.1
Prediction
The prediction stage involves using the system model (3.4) to obtain the prediction
density of the state at time step k via the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation:

The Bayesian Approach
p (xk|Zk−1) =

p (xk|xk−1, Zk−1) p (xk−1|Zk−1) dxk−1,
=

p (xk|xk−1) p (xk−1|Zk−1) dxk−1.
(3.6)
The ﬁrst line of (3.6) is a statement of the law of total probability. The sim-
pliﬁcation p (xk|xk−1, Zk−1) = p (xk|xk−1) used to progress from the ﬁrst line of
(3.6) to the second applies because (3.4) describes a Markov process of order one.
The probabilistic model of the state evolution, p (xk|xk−1), is deﬁned by the system
equation (3.4) and the known statistics of v(t).
3.1.2
Update
At time tk a measurement zk becomes available and the update stage is carried out.
This involves an update of the prediction (or prior) pdf via Bayes’ rule:
p (xk|Zk) = p (xk|zk, Zk−1)
= p (zk|xk, Zk−1) p (xk|Zk−1)
p (zk|Zk−1)
= p (zk|xk) p (xk|Zk−1)
p (zk|Zk−1)
,
(3.7)
where conditional independence has been used to write the likelihood function
p (zk|xk, Zk−1) = p (zk|xk), which is deﬁned by the measurement model (3.5) and
the known statistics of wk. The normalizing constant on the denominator can be
expanded as
p (zk|Zk−1) =

p (zk|xk) p (xk|Zk−1) dxk.
(3.8)
In the update stage (3.7), the measurement zk is used to modify the prior density to
obtain the required posterior density of the current state.
Note that there is no requirement for all of the measurements to have the same
statistical model or even contain the same type of information. For example, there
could be multiple sensors operating on different modalities. For simplicity, we have
not introduced explicit notation to change the measurement pdf for each k. For the
accident ﬂight three different types of measurement have been used. As discussed in
Chap.5, the satellite communications messages consist of R-channel and C-channel
messages that have differing information content. Another quite different form of
measurement is the areas of the ocean ﬂoor that have been searched without locating
the aircraft and the debris that has been recovered. This measurement and its potential
use to reﬁne the ongoing search are discussed in Chap.11.

3.1 The Problem and its Conceptual Solution
15
The recurrence relations (3.6) and (3.7) form the basis for the optimal Bayesian
solution. The recursive propagation of the posterior density, given by (3.6) and (3.7),
is only a conceptual solution in the sense that in general it cannot be determined
analytically. In most practical situations the analytic solution of (3.7) and (3.8) is
intractable and numerical approximations have to be used. This has been a topic of
signiﬁcant research effort over the past 20 years [1, 20, 33]; a general overview of
the method is presented next.
3.2
The Particle Filter
In the linear Gaussian case, the pdfs for p (v(t)), p (wk), p (x0) are all Gaussian and
the functions f(·) and h(·) are linear. It can then be easily shown that the posterior
p (xk|Zk) is also Gaussian and all of these pdfs can be summarised completely by
their means and covariances. The Kalman ﬁlter is an algorithm that deﬁnes recursions
for the mean and covariance of p (xk|Zk) in terms of the means and covariances of
the prior and noise processes. However, in general, the posterior does not take the
same functional form as the prior and indeed it is not possible to even write a closed
form expression for p (xk|Zk). In this case an approximate solution is required.
The solution used for the MH370 search deﬁnition is referred to as the particle ﬁlter
and is a numerical approximation based on random sampling.
The fundamental concept in the particle ﬁlter is to approximate the pdf p (xk|Zk)
as a weighted combination of sample points
p (xk|Zk) ≈
P

p=1
wp
k δ

xk −xp
k

,
(3.9)
where the wp
k are referred to as weights and sum to unity, and the xp
k are referred
to as particles. The convergence properties of this approximation in the limit as the
number of particles P increases have been well studied, for example [14, 21]. Given
this approximate pdf, it is simple to evaluate the expectation of any nonlinear function
of the state, such as
E

(3.10)
The approximation of an integral using sample points as above is referred to as
Monte Carlo integration and can be applied to both the Chapman–Kolmogorov pre-
diction (3.6) and the Bayesian update (3.7).
The particle ﬁlter is an algorithm that provides a mechanism to recursively create
a set of weighted particles approximating p (xk|Zk) starting from a previous set of
weighted particles approximating p (xk−1|Zk−1). It does this in two stages: ﬁrst it

The Bayesian Approach
moves the particle sample points xp
k−1 →xp
k to new locations using a pdf referred to
as a proposal distribution, which is a tractable approximation of the pdf of interest.
Second, it determines new particle weights to correct for the difference between the
proposal and the true pdf. This process is known as importance sampling [1, 33].
The proposal distribution is a critical component of the particle ﬁlter. It is a
function chosen by the designer subject to relatively loose constraints. Importantly,
the proposal distribution must cover all of the state space where the true distribution
is non-zero and its tails should be heavier than the tails of the true distribution. If the
proposal is chosen poorly then many of the particles xp
k will be assigned very low
weights and the ﬁlter efﬁciency will be low: a large number of particles will be
required for satisfactory performance. A common version of the particle ﬁlter is the
Sample-Importance-Resample (SIR) particle ﬁlter that uses the system dynamics as a
proposal distribution. The SIR is popular because it is often relatively straightforward
to sample from the dynamics and because the weight update equation is very simple
when the dynamics is used as the proposal. The ﬁlter used in this book is a form of
SIR particle ﬁlter.
For the SIR particle ﬁlter, for each particle xp
k−1 a new xp
k is drawn from the tran-
sition density p(xk|xp
k−1), and weights are updated by scaling the previous weights
by the current measurement likelihood and re-normalising,

(3.11)
where the normalising term is Wk = 	P

A key difﬁculty in particle ﬁlters is the issue of degeneracy, i.e., over time, many
weights tend toward zero, and the corresponding particles are of little use. Resam-
pling is used to combat this difﬁculty. The simplest approach is draw P new particles
from the approximate distribution (3.9), such that particles with very large weights
are likely to be replicated many times over, and those with very small weights
are unlikely to be sampled. A variety of methods are possible, and can be found
in [1, 33]. The sampling method used in this study is detailed in Chap.8.
3.3
Rao–Blackwellised Particle Filter
One of the challenges in implementing a particle ﬁlter is that the number of particles
required to make a good approximation to the desired posterior pdf can grow expo-
nentially with the dimension of the state space. In some circumstances, it is possible
to mitigate this by incorporating an analytic representation of the distribution of part
of the state given a sample of the remainder of the state. For example, suppose that
the measurement function can be decomposed into two parts
zk = h1
k

x1
k

+ h2
k

x2
k

+ wk,
(3.12)

3.3 Rao–Blackwellised Particle Filter
17
where x1
k and x2
k are disjoint sub-vectors of the state xk. In this case we can write


x1
k|zt, Zt−1

p

k, zt, Zt−1

.
(3.13)
The two densities above can be estimated using different ﬁlters. When the function
h2


x2
k

is linear and the noise is Gaussian, the second density p

x2
k|x1
k, zt, Zt−1

can be estimated using a Kalman ﬁlter, even if the ﬁrst function h1


is nonlinear.
The state vector that needs to be sampled is then x1
k not [x1
k, x2
k] and the sampling
process can use fewer samples for a given degree of accuracy.
When a particle ﬁlter is used for the nonlinear part of the measurement problem,
the conditioning of the second state density p

x2
k|x1
k, zt, Zt−1

leads to a separate
Kalman ﬁlter for each particle. Each Kalman ﬁlter uses the sampled value of

Rao–Blackwellised particle ﬁlter [15, 29, 38].

Chapter 4
Aircraft Prior Based on Primary
Radar Data
The Bayesian approach described in the previous chapter is a recursive method that
calculates the posterior state distribution at each measurement time from a distri-
bution at the previous measurement time. It fundamentally requires knowledge of
three probability density functions: the prior distribution of the state at initialisation,
p (x(0)); the state evolution p (xk|xk−1); and the measurement likelihood p (zk|xk).
Chapter5 addresses the measurement probability density and Chaps.6 and 7 discuss
the state transition model. This chapter discusses the prior state distribution and the
method used to deﬁne it. Intuitively, one might expect this prior to have a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the probability distribution at later times: a larger uncertainty in the
prior might be expected to lead to a greater spread of uncertainty in the ﬁnal pdf
compared to a prior pdf with smaller uncertainty.
In the MH370 search, there are two data sources that are available to construct
the prior. The aircraft reports its own location and other information to the ground
via a satellite link using the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting
System (ACARS). Data from ACARS is available for the accident ﬂight only up to
the point where communications were lost: the ﬁnal ACARS report was at 17:07:29.
In Chap.9, other ﬂights with known aircraft locations are used to validate the models
used for the accident ﬂight. For these, ACARS data is available and this data is used
to construct the prior.
The second source of prior information is radar. For the validation ﬂights this radar
data is not available and nor is it required given the presence of ACARS logs. For the
accident ﬂight, primary radar data provided by Malaysia is available from after the
loss of communications up until 18:22:12. The radar data contains regular estimates
of latitude, longitude and altitude at 10s intervals from 16:42:27 to 18:01:49. A single
additional latitude and longitude position was reported at 18:22:12. Figure4.1 shows
the radar data overlaid on a map. Under radar coverage, the aircraft turned sharply
at approximately 17:24, crossed over Malaysia, and then turned to the North-West
at 17:53.
The Bayes ﬁlter requires a prior over the full state space, not merely latitude and
longitude. The development to follow will lead to a state vector containing several
otherparameters.Wherepossibleitispreferabletospecifyapriorontheseparameters

Aircraft Prior Based on Primary Radar Data
Fig. 4.1 Primary and secondary radar data available for MH370
using radar data or ACARS rather than subjective belief. Where this is not possible,
the philosophy has been to use priors that are diffuse to avoid prejudicing the ﬁlter
output. It is possible to derive the angle and speed of the ground velocity from the
radar reports by assuming a simpliﬁed almost constant velocity model and applying
a Kalman ﬁlter. This assumption is acceptable for the primary radar data because the
reports are closely spaced in time. Figure4.2 shows the derived speed and direction
obtained from this ﬁlter.1 The speed estimates vary dramatically during the ﬁrst turn,
which is not an accurate representation of the aircraft speed at this time. It is likely
due to the mismatch between the assumed linear Kalman ﬁlter model and the high
acceleration manoeuvre performed by the aircraft. Since these artefacts are localised
to the time of the turn the inﬂuence on the state at the end of the sequence is negligible.
The ﬁnal reported position from radar was at very long range from the sensor and
there was a long time delay between it and the penultimate radar report. This report is
at long range and it is likely to have rather poor accuracy because the angular errors
translate to large location errors at long range. The radar report at 18:22 is closer to
the penultimate report at 18:02 than the ﬁlter speed predicts. Also, it was observed
that the range ring derived from the timing measurements at 18:25 and 18:28 are
closer to the 18:02 report than predictions based on either the 18:02 ﬁltered speed or
the 18:22 ﬁltered speed. Figure4.3 shows the relative positions of the 18:25 arc and
the ﬁlter predictions based on data up to 18:02. Collectively these data points suggest
that the aircraft may have slowed down at some point between 18:02 and 18:22. In
1The measurement error was assumed to have a standard deviation of 0.5nm and the process noise
variance was 3.5 × 10−4 nm2 s−3. The process noise was adjusted to minimise the mean squared
prediction error.

Fig. 4.2 Smoothed estimates of speed and direction derived from radar data. Dotted lines show
covariance of estimates, illustrated as mean plus and minus three-sigma value
addition, the ground speed observed by the radar prior to 18:02 is relatively high and
implies that the aircraft would have been at low altitude. This is likely to result in
poor fuel efﬁciency, and in order to maintain ﬂight for the duration indicated by the
satellite data, the aircraft would have had to slow and increase altitude at some stage
to conserve fuel. This is also consistent with a potential speed change between 18:02
and 18:22.
The 18:22 radar observation was not used quantitatively because the latitude and
longitude derived from it are likely to be less accurate at long range and the aircraft
may have manoeuvred prior to 18:22. The radar observation was deemed to indicate
that the aircraft did not turn between 18:02 and 18:22, but the numerical values were
not used. Instead, a prior was deﬁned at 18:01 at the penultimate radar point using the
output of the Kalman ﬁlter described above. The position standard deviations were
set to 0.5nm and the direction standard deviation to 1◦. Figure4.3 shows predictions
of the mean of this prior from 18:02 to 18:25, shown in yellow, and one-sigma lines at
±1◦. The 18:22 radar point, at the end of the radar track, is clearly within the azimuth
fan. As described above, the ﬁltered speed at the output of the Kalman ﬁlter is not
consistent with the 18:25 measurement and predictions based purely on this will have
a likelihood very close to zero. In addition, the model discussed in Chap.6 speciﬁes
airspeedintermsofMachnumber.ThemanoeuvremodeldescribedinChap.7allows
for speed changes and these will be randomly sampled by the proposal distribution.

in white, on the right. The near-vertical white line on the left corresponds to the 18:25 BTO arc
Rather than trying to specify when the speed change occurred, the ﬁlter was expected
to learn this information. This provides a richer description of the trajectory since the
timing of a speed change and the new speed selected are coupled together to arrive at
an appropriate position at 18:25. As will be seen, the ﬁlter had no difﬁculty ﬁnding
paths that agreed with the measurement data. An initial Mach number was selected
from a uniform prior between 0.73 and 0.84; this was chosen on the basis of expert
advice to ensure that the required ﬂight endurance is achievable.
It is possible to deﬁne a much earlier prior using only the ACARS data from early
in the ﬂight. In this case, the turns illustrated in the radar data become part of the
unknown aircraft ﬂight path to be estimated. Chapter10 illustrates that this approach
leads to a larger search zone, including the search zone resulting from the use of the
radar data, and extending further North. This broadening occurs because the ﬂight
path from the ﬁnal ACARS report to 18:25 is much less constrained.

Chapter 5
Measurement Model, Satellite
Communications
The Bayesian ﬁlter discussed in Chap.3 relies on knowledge of three probability
density functions: the state prior distribution, the state stochastic model, and the
measurement conditional probability density. The prior used for the analysis in this
book was discussed in Chap.4. This chapter addresses the measurement probability
density and Chaps.6 and 7 discuss the state dynamics model.
The most general measurement model was deﬁned in (3.5) and simply states
that the measurement is some function of the aircraft state and measurement noise.
In many systems it is not too restrictive to assume that the noise is additive, in which
case (3.5) becomes
zk = hk (xk) + wk.
(5.1)
Prescribing the nonlinear function hk (xk) and the statistical distribution of the mea-
surement noise provides a complete description of the measurement probability den-
sity. The measurements available for the accident ﬂight are timing and frequency
logs of communication messages between the aircraft and a ground station. Details
of the communication system software and hardware combine with the physics of the
communication geometry to determine the nonlinear measurement function. The sta-
tistics of the noise were determined empirically by analysing a population of real
measurements for known aircraft states.
This chapter gives a brief overview of the satellite communication system and then
describes the nonlinear measurement functions and empirical noise models for the
timing and frequency measurements. The majority of the communications messages
available were automated signalling messages, but there were also two telephone
calls made to the plane that remained unanswered. The ﬁrst of these is particularly
important because of when it occurred. The chapter concludes with a description of
the measurement model for telephony. Further details may be found in [2].

Measurement Model, Satellite Communications
5.1
Satellite Communications System
The accident aircraft was ﬁtted with a satellite communications terminal that used
the Inmarsat Classic Aero system [2]. This system uses a satellite to relay messages
between the aircraft and a ground station. In the accident ﬂight the messages were
passed between the aircraft and a ground receiving unit located in Perth, Australia, via
the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite. Figure5.1 illustrates the satellite communication system
in use during the accident ﬂight. The aircraft is referred to as the Aircraft Earth Station
(AES) and the ground receiving unit is referred to as the Ground Earth Station (GES).
Inmarsat-3F1 is a satellite in geosynchronous orbit with longitude 64.5◦East and was
used exclusively for the duration of the accident ﬂight.
An AES is equipped with a satellite data unit that comprises a satellite modem
and auxiliary hardware and software. Transmission of data over the satellite is via
bursts which are scheduled to arrive at the GES at a speciﬁed time and frequency.
Communications from multiple users are coordinated by the allocation of different
time and frequency slots to each user. Return channel (AES to GES) time slot bound-
aries are referenced to the forward channel (GES to AES) [2]. The duration of each
time slot is sufﬁcient to account for all possible positions of the aircraft with respect
to the satellite. The width of each frequency slot is determined by the data rate and a
guard width that accounts for possible variations in the satellite oscillator frequency
and other possible frequency offsets. Frequency compensations applied onboard the
aircraft (aircraft induced Doppler pre-compensation) and at the ground station serve
to reduce the possible difference between the expected and actual frequency of the
Fig. 5.1 System model of the satellite communication system

messages received from the aircraft. The on-ground compensation makes use of a
second ground station located in Burum, Netherlands that transmits a reference sig-
nal to the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite which is relayed to the Perth GES. Its purpose is
to enable the receive modem in the GES to compensate for the Doppler frequency
shift from the satellite to the Perth GES. This compensation process is referred to as
Enhanced Automatic Frequency Correction.
After the Enhanced Automatic Frequency Correction process, the expected time
of arrival of each communications burst is compared with the actual time of arrival
and the difference between the two is referred to as the Burst Timing Offset (BTO).
The BTO is minimised when the elevation angle to the satellite is 90◦and increases as
the aircraft moves away from the sub-satellite position. Hence, the BTO is a measure
of how far the aircraft is from the sub-satellite position. Similarly, the difference
betweentheexpectedfrequencyofeachcommunicationsburstandtheactualreceived
frequencyisreferredtoastheBurstFrequencyOffset(BFO).TheBFOisafunctionof
therelativespeedbetweentheaircraftandthesatellite.Giventhatthesatelliteposition
and speed are known, the BFO provides information about the aircraft velocity vector.
The BTO and BFO are logged by the ground station for every communications burst.
This logging was a relatively recent addition to the ground station following the
Air France 447 accident [2, 45] and was intended to assist in locating an aircraft.
Statistical models for these two measurement functions are now developed.
5.2
Burst Timing Offset
The Inmarsat Classic Aero system allocates a time slot for communications based
on a nominal propagation delay that assumes a nominal satellite position and a
nominal aircraft position. The nominal aircraft position is at zero altitude directly
below the satellite’s nominal orbital position of 64.5◦E longitude, zero latitude and
an altitude of 35788.122km. The round trip delay is proportional to the distance
from the ground station to the actual aircraft location via the actual satellite location.
The actual satellite position is different from the nominal satellite position because
Inmarsat-3F1 is not exactly motionless, but rather moves in a known way in a region
about its nominal location. The Burst Timing Offset is the additional delay after the
start of the allocated time slot at which the message is received [2]. The BTO is thus
the difference between the round trip message delay and the nominal delay used
for scheduling. In addition to the propagation delay the message delay includes the
latency of the satellite data processing unit. Denoting a BTO measurement at time tk
as zBTO

where
• T (xk, sk) is the round trip propagation delay from the ground station to the aircraft
via the satellite;
• sk is the state of the satellite at time tk, that is its position and velocity in three
dimensions, along with the satellite oscillator’s state;
• T nom is the nominal round trip delay;
• T channel is a channel dependent bias term due to processing in the satellite data
unit;
• T anomaly
k
is an anomaly correction term discussed below;
• wBTO
k
is a zero mean scalar noise process with statistics to be determined from
measurement data logs.
The function hBTO
k
(xk, sk) is assumed to be deterministic, so the measurement vari-
ance is the variance of the noise term wBTO
k
. The round trip delay can be expressed
in terms of the distances from the satellite to the ground station and the aircraft as
T (xk, sk) = 2

where c is the speed of light; g is the location of the ground station; Hs selects the
position elements of the satellite state; Hx selects the position elements of the aircraft
state; and the distance |·| is the three dimensional Cartesian distance, i.e. the l2 norm.
Combining the nominal locations of the satellite and aircraft with the known
location of the Perth ground station gives a value of T nom = 499,962 µs.
There are a number of different channel types used that carry different trafﬁc types
and have different baud rates. Communications from the aircraft to the ground are
typically over the R- and T-data channels with C-channel used for voice telephone
calls. Communications from the ground to the aircraft are over the P-channel. The
channel dependent calibration term T channel is assumed to be constant over a single
ﬂight but can vary between ﬂights. A ﬁxed value for each ﬂight assessed was empir-
ically derived by comparing the communications logs with known aircraft positions:
the calculated value of T channel was the mean difference between the measured BTO
and the expected BTO calculated using the known aircraft location. For the accident
ﬂight this calibration is only available for the time when the plane was at the tarmac
and for the ﬁrst half hour of ﬂight. As such, values from the previous ﬂight were also
used in the calculation of T channel. The majority of the messages available from the
accident ﬂight are R1200 messages for which T channel = −4,283 µs.
The anomaly correction term T anomaly
k
was empirically derived through analysis
of a collection of communications logs. For some communication messages, typi-
cally during initial log-on, there was a very large difference between the measured
BTO and the nominal delay. Analysis showed that rather than simple outliers, these
anomalous BTO measurements could be corrected by a factor of N × 7,820 µs
where N is a positive integer. The origin of these anomalous BTO measurements
has not been fully determined, but the empirical correction time is quite close to the

5.2 Burst Timing Offset
27
transmission interrupt clock period of 7,812.5 µs and the BTO collection process
contains quantisation.
The channel dependent calibration and anomaly correction terms result in a resid-
ual measurement error that is approximately Gaussian. For the R1200 messages, the
empirically derived standard deviation of the measurement noise wBTO
k
is 29 µs, and
for R600 messages, 62 µs. For anomalous R1200 messages a standard deviation of
43 µs was used. Figure5.2 shows a histogram of the residual BTO measurement
errors for R1200 messages referenced to the 7 March 2014 T channel value, and the
moment-matched Gaussian approximation. The data used to construct the histogram
and the empirical parameters were obtained from logs of the 20 ﬂights of 9M-MRO
prior to the accident ﬂight.
The histogram in Fig.5.2 has an underlying mean of 10 µs. This is due to the
channel dependent calibration term T channel not being stationary. Over the span of a

day it appears constant but in the context of the 20 ﬂights represented in Fig.5.2 there
is a slow variation. As discussed above, different values were ﬁtted for each ﬂight.
Figure5.3 shows a scatter plot of the BTO errors against time. The channel dependent
calibration term T channel was matched to the ﬁnal ﬂight before the accident ﬂight,
MH371 (and the beginning of the accident ﬂight) and the BTO errors from MH371
on 7 March 2014 are marked as red crosses. The variation in bias is sufﬁciently slow
that assuming it is the same for the accident ﬂight as the previous ﬂight is satisfactory.
5.3
Burst Frequency Offset
The Burst Frequency Offset is a function of the Doppler shifts imparted on the com-
munication signal due to the motion of the satellite and the aircraft. The relationship
is more complicated than a direct Doppler calculation because the aircraft software
contains Doppler compensation that offsets the Doppler shift due to the aircraft
motion. Although the aircraft attempts to compensate for its own motion, it does this
under the assumption that the communications satellite is in motionless geostationary
orbit and it does not include the vertical component of the aircraft velocity (which is
non-zero when it is ascending or descending) [2]. Since Inmarsat-3F1 is not exactly
geostationary, the compensation is unable to completely remove Doppler effects.
Empirical analysis of the BFO was conducted for the 20 ﬂights of 9M-MRO prior to
the accident ﬂight. This analysis used the same Doppler correction software as the
9M-MRO satellite data unit to determine the expected BFO given a known reported
aircraft position and velocity and compared this with the observed measurements.
Similar to the BTO, the BFO measurement function consists of a nonlinear func-
tion of the aircraft and satellite states and several bias terms [2]

chain;
• δ f bias

(xk, sk) is a slowly varying bias due to errors in the aircraft and satellite
oscillators and processing in the satellite data unit;
• wBFO
k
is a zero mean scalar noise process with statistics to be determined from
measurement data logs.

5.3 Burst Frequency Offset
29
This function was described in detail in [2], we review it brieﬂy and elaborate where
the analysis herein makes different modeling assumptions to those in [2]. Again,
the function hBFO
k
(xk, sk) is assumed to be deterministic, so the measurement vari-
ance is the variance of the noise term wBFO
k
. This is a less reliable assumption than
for BTO because the bias term δ f bias
k
(xk, sk) changes. To compensate for this, the
measurement variance was inﬂated from the empirically derived wBFO
k
variance.
The uplink Doppler shift can be expressed as a product of the uplink frequency
with the inner product of the relative velocity (normalised by the speed of light, c)
and a unit vector along the relative displacement between the aircraft and the satellite

where Fup is the uplink carrier frequency; Vs selects the velocity elements of the

where ¯s is the nominal satellite position assumed by the aircraft, and Fdown is down-
link carrier frequency. The aircraft frequency compensation term δ f comp
k
(xk) is deter-
mined using the aircraft’s own knowledge of its position and velocity but with an
assumed altitude of zero and an assumed vertical speed of zero. The modiﬁed posi-
tion matrix ¯Hx selects only the horizontal location variables and sets the altitude to
zero, and similarly for ¯Vx. The compensation also assumes a motionless satellite at
its nominal satellite location of 64.5◦E. The satellite altitude used in the correction
is 422km higher than the nominal 35788.12km value.
The satellite translates the frequency of messages using a local oscillator that
is maintained in a temperature-controlled enclosure to improve its stability. During
eclipse periods, when the satellite passes through the Earth’s shadow, the satellite
temperature drops, resulting in a small variation in translation frequency [2]. An
eclipse period occurred during the accident ﬂight and some of the validation ﬂights
were also affected by eclipses. The oscillator temperature also varies with time of
day as the satellite orientation to the sun changes and as the temperature control
system applies its controls. All of these thermal effects are included in the term
δ f sat
k
(sk). The speciﬁc details of the functions that deﬁne δ f sat
k
(sk) and δ f AFC
k
(sk)
are proprietary of Inmarsat.
The bias term δ f bias
k
(xk, sk) is time varying. In the BTO case the variations in bias
were slow enough to be ignored within a single ﬂight and we were able to assume
that T channel was constant for each ﬂight. This is not the case for the BFO bias term.

BFO Error (Hz)
Fig. 5.4 Results for the 2-Mar-2014 ﬂight from Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur
The mean bias is different between ﬂights and even within a single ﬂight there is
evidence of structured variation. Figure5.4 shows an example of the BFO measure-
ment errors for a ﬂight between Mumbai (BOM) and Kuala Lumpur (KUL) on 2
March 2014. The ﬁgure shows the difference between the measured BFO values and
predicted values (using the actual SDU software for determining δ f comp
k
(xk) in the
SATCOM system model) based on the known geometry and aircraft velocity vector
at the time. The bias used for the plot was obtained by analysing BFO measurements
while the aircraft was on the tarmac. The residual error is clearly not zero-mean, and
the mean varies with time. Substantial effort was made to characterise this structured
bias. It was found to have a geographic dependency but it has not been possible to
determine a quantitative function to compensate for this change in bias.
The variations in bias shown in Fig.5.4 happen over a timescale of minutes rather
than hours. In the accident ﬂight the available BFO values are generally at least an
hour apart. This is a relatively long time compared with the correlation structure of
the error, so the model does not use a coloured noise model for the BFO. However,
the drift of the BFO bias means that it is not sufﬁcient to assume that δ f bias
k
(xk, sk)
will be the same in ﬂight as on the tarmac before takeoff. The potential variations
were incorporated by modeling the BFO bias as an unknown constant with a prior
mean given by the tarmac value and a standard deviation of 25Hz. Since the BFO
measurement Eq.(5.6) is linear in the bias its distribution conditioned on the other
states can be estimated with a Kalman ﬁlter. This is the Rao-Blackwellised particle
ﬁlter described in Sect.3.3.
Empirical statistics of the residual measurement noise wBFO
k
were determined
using the previous 20 ﬂights of 9M-MRO. Data points corresponding to when the
aircraft was climbing or descending were excluded. Table5.1 shows the empirical
statistics of the BFO measurements for R1200 and R600 messages. The ‘in-ﬂight
only’ statistics show the combined effects of noise and bias variation without the
inﬂuence of ‘on-tarmac’ outliers (potentially due to taxiing). The ‘including tarmac’
statistics on the other hand are also inﬂuenced by the BFO bias value applied to
keep the BFO error at the source tarmac for R1200 messages close to zero. The
mean BFO error was close to zero in all cases, indicating appropriate δ f bias
k
(xk, sk)
values were chosen for each ﬂight. The statistics show that even when outliers are
discarded a standard deviation of about 4.3Hz is applicable. As discussed above,

illustrates the sensitivity of the BTO and BFO measurements to variations in the

Figure5.5 shows a histogram of the 3392 in-ﬂight BFO errors. On-tarmac BFO
errors were excluded due to the pre-biasing described above. A Gaussian ﬁt to the
distribution is shown as a black line. It can be seen that the distribution shows
some non-Gaussian features and the tails of the distribution for negative errors are
somewhat heavier than those for positive errors.

C-Channel Telephone Calls
There were two unanswered telephone calls from the ground to MH370 after the loss
of radar data. These communications use the C-channel and result in measurements
of BFO but not BTO. Initially the C-channel data was not included in the ﬂight
prediction but analysis from DST Group highlighted that the ﬁrst of these calls
provides critical information. The ﬁrst call occurred from 18:39:53 to 18:40:56 and
is important because the measured BFO is signiﬁcantly different from the BFO on

the R1200 measurement preceding it at 18:28:15. The R1200 BFO value is consistent
with the speed and direction of the aircraft while under radar coverage whereas the
later C-channel BFO value is not. Assuming that the change in BFO implies a turn,
the difference between the BFO predicted by using a MATLAB model of the SDU
software1 and the measured BFO on the C-channel was analysed as a function of
post-turn direction and for a range of aircraft speeds and turn times between 18:28:15
and 18:39:53. Figure5.6 shows the residual error and it clearly demonstrates that only
Southerly track angles are consistent with the C-channel measurements. The model
predicted BFO values of Northerly paths are more than 10 standard deviations away
from the measured BFO.
The BTO measurements from the R1200 messages at 18:28:15 and 19:41:03 are
not consistent with the velocity vector before 18:28:15. The only way to satisfy
these measurements and maintain a feasible air speed is for the aircraft to have
turned. However, the time window for this turn is more than an hour. The 18:39:53
C-channel measurement is critical because when combined with the 18:28:15 BFO
measurement it signiﬁcantly restricts this turning time window to a little over 11
minutes. Using the C-channel data restricts the aircraft trajectories much more tightly
than using only R-channel data.
1Note The difference between the MATLAB model output and the SDU software output was found
to be inconsequential to this analysis for determining δ f comp

The BFO diagram used an assumed aircraft position of 1◦S and 93.6◦E and a bias
of 150Hz, which is the tarmac value for the accident ﬂight. The BFO contour shape
varies slowly with aircraft position. The ﬁgure used the measurement error model
described earlier in this chapter, namely zero-mean Gaussian noises with standard
deviation 29 µs for BTO, and 7Hz for BFO.

The diagrams show that the BTO provides reasonable localisation along a circle
of a given range from the satellite. The information provided by the BFO is less pre-

Aircraft Cruise Dynamics
The ﬁnal piece of the Bayesian ﬁlter is the dynamics model. In object tracking, it is
common to model either the velocity or the acceleration of the object as a random
walk in two or three dimensions (e.g., [7]). Such a model has the advantage of
mathematical simplicity and can be adequate, particularly in applications where the
delay between measurements is low and the area of interest is small. However, an
integrated random walk is not adequate for prediction over long time periods, which
is required for applications where the delay between measurements is signiﬁcant. In
the case of MH370, the area of interest is vast and the measurements are extremely
sparse in time, occurring approximately hourly. The aircraft is believed to have turned
at least once after loss of radar contact, so the dynamics model needs to be adaptive
enough to accommodate realistic aircraft manoeuvres and yet not so loose as to
cause unrealistic spreading of the state posterior pdf over the whole BTO arc. This
is not possible with simple integrated random walk models, so more sophisticated
approaches are required.
The dynamics model that was adopted for this analysis consists of a random
sequence of deliberate manoeuvres interspersed with periods of cruise, in which
the speed and direction are almost constant. This model is motivated by [12, 16].
Commercial aircraft typically operate by setting a desired air speed in terms of a
Mach number, which is the ratio of the aircraft speed relative to the air mass around
it to the speed of sound. During cruise the aircraft autopilot system seeks to maintain
a constant Mach number, altitude and control angle (e.g., heading or track), though
random ﬂuctuations will occur in each of these.
Three types of manoeuvre were considered: coordinated turns, where the aircraft
maintains a constant speed and changes control angle; altitude changes that occur
under constant control angle and speed; and accelerations, where the aircraft main-
tains a constant control angle and altitude and changes speed (Mach number). Details
of the statistical models used for manoeuvres are presented in Chap.7, while details
about the cruise model are provided in this chapter.

Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Process
As discussed above, it would be inappropriate to assume a random walk in either
speed or direction because, over the long duration between measurements, such a
model would either apply signiﬁcant probability to speeds which are kinematically
infeasible (if the noise strength was signiﬁcant), or fail to model the statistical vari-
ability that ﬂight paths tend to exhibit (if the noise strength was very small). Instead an
Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process [41] was adopted to model the speed and direction
under control. Under this model, random perturbations are permitted, but the values
tend to revert back to a prescribed set point. Denoting the quantity being controlled
as x(t) and the prescribed set point as ¯x(t), the model is speciﬁed in continuous
time as
dx(t) = −β [x(t) −¯x(t)] dt + d ¯x(t) + dv(t).
(6.1)
The parameters of the model are the reversion rate β; the strength q of the Brownian
motionprocessv(t);andthesetpoint ¯x(t).Thesetpointisaccommodatedthroughthe
sampling procedure described in Chap.7, while the reversion rate and noise strength

For a linear, time invariant, continuous time stochastic differential equation of the
form
dx(t) = Ax(t)dt + dv(t),
(6.2)
the equivalent discrete process is
xk = Φkxk−1 + vk,
(6.3)
where Φk is the system matrix, calculated using the matrix exponential
Φk = exp[A(tk −tk−1)],
(6.4)
and the covariance of the noise vk is

consider a scalar state x and a scalar system matrix Φ
xk = ¯xk + Φk (xk−1 −¯xk−1) + wk,
(6.6)
where ¯xk = ¯x(tk) and
Φk = exp[−β(tk −tk−1)].

.
(6.8)
If the difference in time between two samples is large, then the new value of the OU
process is only weakly correlated with the previous value. This can be seen by taking
the limit of (6.7) and (6.8) as the difference in time increases: the expected value
converges to ¯xk, and the variance converges to a steady state value of
q
2β .
When an OU process is used to model velocity, the position that results from inte-
grating the velocity is an Integrated Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Analytic expres-
sions for the parameters of this process can also be determined in closed form. In
the present context, the overall velocity is constructed as a nonlinear composition
of several OU processes, as described below. Consequently, position is determined
through numerical integration of the velocity over small time steps.
6.1.1
Determining Process Parameters
Logged aircraft ﬂight data from several ﬂights were analysed in order to select the
parameters β and q of the OU processes for Mach number, wind, and angle. The log
data includes variables such as position, velocity, Mach number, heading, and local
wind velocity. In particular the log contains each quantity that is modelled using the
OU process, namely Mach number, wind, and direction. This means that a maximum
likelihood process can be applied directly (e.g., [37, 44]), rather than requiring more
complicated system identiﬁcation techniques (e.g., [27]).
In the ﬁrst step, the data was manually segmented into trajectory parts that do
not include manoeuvres (such as altitude, speed or direction changes). This yields
L sequences, where the lth sequence is (xl,1, . . . , xl,Kl), and the time of element
xl,k is tl,k. The unknown parameters are the reversion rate β, the noise strength q
and the nominal set point ¯xl for each sequence (which is treated as a non-random
nuisance parameter). Deﬁning θ = (β, q, ¯x1, . . . , ¯xL), the overall log likelihood of
the observed data is:

where Φl,k and Ql,k are given by (6.7) and (6.8) respectively, and C is a constant
that does not depend on the parameter vector θ. Given a value of β, it is possible to
maximise over (q, ¯x1, . . . , ¯xL) in closed form, thus parameter identiﬁcation can be
performed simply using a line search.

In reality, the data stored in the aircraft log ﬁles are not exact values, but rather
ﬁltered estimates provided by the on-board navigation system. Since the complete
information state of the estimators is not provided, the time correlation structure is
unknown. However, our interest in the present context is in predictions over sig-
niﬁcant periods of time, so log data was sub-sampled such that the time between
samples ranges between 60 and 300s. It is assumed that, over this period, the time
correlation of the estimates has decayed to such a point that it is dominated by the
natural variability of the process.
6.2
Mach Number
In the most common modes of operation, commercial aircraft maintain an approxi-
mately constant Mach number, i.e., the ratio between the true air speed of the aircraft,
and the speed of sound in the airmass around the aircraft. The speed of sound in an
ideal gas is dependent only on the air temperature:
csound(T ) =

γ RT
M
,
(6.11)
where γ ≈1.40 is the adiabatic index, R ≈8.314 J mol−1 K−1 is the molar gas
constant, M is the molar mass of the gas (≈0.02896 kg mol−1 for dry air), and T is
the absolute temperature (in Kelvins) [26].
Thus the true air speed of the aircraft is given by
vair = m × csound(T )
(6.12)
where T is the temperature at the aircraft location and m is the Mach number. The
consequence of the dependence of speed of sound on temperature is that changes in
temperature (including those due to changes in altitude) cause changes in air speed.
The air temperature data used in this study was provided by the Australian Bureau of
Meteorology, from the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator
(ACCESS) Global model, referred to as ACCESS-G, outlined in [6]. Further details
of this data source are discussed in Sect.6.4.
Even though the aircraft may seek to hold the Mach number constant, ﬂuctuations
can and do occur, e.g., due to turbulence and imperfect control. An OU model is used
to represent this variability. The parameters βmach = 1.058 × 10−2 and qmach =
2.05×10−7 s−1 were calculated using the procedure in Sect.6.1.1 based on historical
logged ﬂight data, and represent the combination of these sources of ﬂuctuations.
The steady state standard deviation under this model is 3.113×10−3. Note that Mach
number is dimensionless.

6.2 Mach Number

6.2.1
Cost Index
Another commonly used mode of speed control is Cost Index. In this mode, the air
speed is selected dynamically to optimise a combination of fuel consumption and
travel time [34]. The pilot speciﬁes a Cost Index value, which indicates the relative
importance of fuel and travel time. The autopilot system then dynamically selects a
Mach number based on the aircraft weight and altitude. This mode was simulated
by randomly sampling a Cost Index value and altitude, and then using lookup tables
based on proprietary data provided by Boeing.
The effect of the dynamic optimisation is that the air speed will tend to drop over
time if the altitude is held constant. The effect is more noticeable at lower altitudes.
During normal operation it is typical for the pilot to initiate climbs in altitude and
the effect is less noticeable. The effect is not evident in the validation ﬂights studied
in Chap.9 because in each of these ﬂights the aircraft altitude increases with time.
For this reason, the majority of the experiments presented in this book do not use
the Cost Index mode. Additional experiments were performed using the Cost Index
mode for the accident ﬂight. The result was a slight narrowing of the pdf as compared
to the Mach number model, as discussed in Sect.10.7.
6.3
Control Angle
The motion of an aircraft relative to the Earth is inﬂuenced by the weather in its
environment, particularly the wind. The aircraft heading (i.e., the direction in which
the nose points) and air speed determine its motion relative to the local air mass but
the motion relative to the Earth is a vector sum of the air velocity and wind velocity
vground = vair + vwind,
(6.13)
as shown in Fig.6.1. We refer to the bearing angle of the ground velocity as the
aircraft’s track; elsewhere the term course is also used. It is the track that determines
motion relative to locations on the Earth’s surface, not the direction in which the
aircraft’s nose points. Similarly, the ground speed is determined from the magnitude
of the vector sum in (6.13) and Fig.6.1. It is generally assumed in this book that the
aircraft can drive a control loop to inﬂuence Mach number and hence air speed but
that the resulting ground speed is somewhat at the mercy of the wind.
The control angle is assumed to follow an OU process as described above for the
Mach number. The model parameters for the control angle OU process (in units of
radians) are βangle = 9.792 × 10−3, and qangle = 4.074 × 10−8 rad2 s−1.

Aircraft Cruise Dynamics
Between aircraft manoeuvres, the aircraft motion is notionally straight and level.
Commercial aircraft are generally designed to operate under autopilot assistance and
it would be highly abnormal for a pilot to maintain direct control of this type of
aircraft for any extended period. There are ﬁve different modes in which the aircraft
autopilot can be programmed for steady ﬂight. The ﬁrst four of these correspond to
different deﬁnitions of the aircraft control angle θ(t). The last is used for navigation
to a speciﬁed location.
The different deﬁnitions of control angle enumerate the combinations of main-
taining a steady heading or track relative to a magnetic or geographic bearing; these
angles are deﬁned in Fig.6.1. The direction of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is not aligned
with the geographic poles and so angles measured with a magnetic compass are not
the same as angles measured with respect to the geographic poles. The difference
between the two angles is referred to as magnetic declination [11]. Angles measured
with respect to the poles are referred to as true angles whereas angles measured by
compass are referred to as magnetic angles. Magnetic declination varies with posi-
tion on the Earth’s surface, so a particular magnetic angle corresponds to different
true angles at different locations. Figure6.2 shows a map of magnetic declination for

the Indian Ocean region. There are signiﬁcant variations in magnetic declination in
the areas through which the accident ﬂight is thought to have ﬂown. If the aircraft
had been following a ﬁxed compass reading then it would appear to gradually turn.
Each of the different autopilot modes is now brieﬂy described.
6.3.1
Constant Magnetic Heading
In Constant Magnetic Heading mode, the aircraft aims to hold a steady air speed
and magnetic heading, so variations in ground velocity will occur due to variations
in wind, and magnetic declination. The bearing of the air velocity is determined by
adding the magnetic declination φ(x) to the control angle

6.3.2
Constant True Heading
In Constant True Heading mode, the aircraft aims to hold a steady air velocity,
i.e., air speed and true (non-magnetic) heading. This is the same as Constant Magnetic
Heading except that the magnetic declination is not applied to the control angle,
θair(t) = θ(t).
(6.16)
6.3.3
Constant Magnetic Track
In Constant Magnetic Track mode, the aircraft aims to hold the direction of the ground
velocity vector, relative to magnetic North, constant. The autopilot automatically
adjusts the aircraft heading to compensate for the wind so that the vector sum of the
air velocity and the wind velocity aligns with the desired track angle. The aircraft
measures the wind, so the direction and magnitude of the wind velocity vector (i.e.
θwind and vwind) are known. The air speed vair is controlled as is the ground velocity
angle θground. Once again the control angle is corrected by the magnetic declination
to give the true track angle

With reference to the triangle geometry in Fig.6.1, the lengths of two of the sides
are known and the angle between the track angle and the wind angle deﬁnes the
angle shown at the top of the triangle. The ground speed can be determined using
the cosine rule, resulting in:

(6.18)
6.3.4
Constant True Track
In Constant True Track mode, the aircraft aims to hold the true direction of the ground
velocity vector constant. In terms of the model this is the same as Constant Magnetic
Track except that the magnetic declination is not applied to the control angle,
θground(t) = θ(t).
(6.19)

6.3 Control Angle
43
6.3.5
Lateral Navigation
The ﬁfth mode is referred to as lateral navigation and implies that the aircraft follows
a great elliptical path to a prescribed destination. This is the type of navigation
typically used between way points. In this mode a ﬁxed latitude and longitude would
be deﬁned and the autopilot would determine the geodesic (shortest constant altitude
path) linking this destination with the current location. Under lateral navigation, the
aircraft heading and track angles will gradually change. In the present context, lateral
navigation is similar to Constant True Track, except that the control angle (i.e., the
track) varies as the aircraft moves.
The path travelled under lateral navigation can be determined using Vincenty’s
reckoning algorithm [46]. The ground velocity is calculated given the local track
angle as for Constant True Track, and Vincenty’s algorithm is used to calculate both
the new location and the updated track angle required to remain on the same great
elliptical path (given a small time step size).
Whereas other autopilot modes follow the same control angle indeﬁnitely until
the pilot modiﬁes settings, lateral navigation permits the pilot to program a sequence
of waypoints that can be either pre-deﬁned, named waypoints, or manually entered
coordinates. The autopilot constructs a route which passes through each in turn, fol-
lowing great elliptical paths between them. One way of simulating lateral navigation
would be to draw a random sequence of waypoints and this would be quite success-
ful for typical commercial ﬂights. However, custom waypoints can be entered and
on an atypical ﬂight could even be likely. In the present context, these deliberate
manoeuvres are modelled as changes in the control angle, as with other modes.
Expert advice indicates that if the autopilot system is operating in lateral nav-
igation mode and it reaches the ﬁnal programmed waypoint, then it reverts to the
previously selected heading hold mode, i.e., Constant Magnetic Heading or Constant
True Heading. This behaviour has been modelled by simulating a process which
switches from lateral navigation to either Constant Magnetic Heading or Constant
True Heading at a random time. This is effectively a special manoeuvre that can
only happen once. The probability that the switch occurs at time t is modelled as
exponentially distributed with a mean time of 6/ln(2) hours, which means that the
probability of switching in 6h is 0.5. The exponential model is discussed in detail in
the next chapter.
6.4
Wind
As described in the preceding sections, the aircraft controls air speed and either head-
ingortrackangle.InConstantMagnetic/TrueHeadingmodes,thewindwillinﬂuence
both the ground speed and the ground track angle. In Constant Magnetic/True Track
and lateral navigation modes, the wind will inﬂuence the ground speed. For this
reason, wind must be incorporated into the analysis.

are drawn every 5 kn. The zonal component of the wind is the component blowing toward the East,
while the meridional component is the component blowing toward the North
The wind data used in this study was provided by the Australian Bureau of Mete-
orology from the ACCESS-G model, outlined in [6]. The model provides estimates
of wind at air pressures from 150 to 300hPa in 25hPa steps and from 300 to 500hPa
in 50hPa steps. This corresponds to an altitude range from approximately 18,000 to
44,000ft. The model provides predictions every three hours at latitudes and longi-
tudes spaced by 0.375◦and 0.5625◦respectively. Linear interpolation is performed
in time, altitude, latitude and longitude. An example of the model output is shown
in Fig.6.3.
The predictions provided by the climate model are averages over time and space,
so even if they are very accurate they do not exactly provide the wind experienced
at a particular location and time. For this reason, two independent OU processes are
used to model the error in the Eastern and Northern components of the wind data.
Parameters of the model were determined using the process described in Sect.6.1.1
based on logged aircraft ﬂight data (i.e., using the predicted wind value as the nominal
set point). The OU process (in units of knots) parameter values were found to be
βwind = 0.001087, and qwind = 0.07021 kn2 s−1. This corresponds to a steady state
standard deviation of 5.684kn.
6.5
Altitude
The measurements available from the Inmarsat satellite are largely insensitive to the
aircraft altitude, but modelling of altitude is necessary due to the coupling of altitude,
air temperature and air speed (via the Mach number), and due to the variation of wind
with altitude. This is modeled by assuming that altitude is constant during cruise,
but permitting deliberate changes in altitude as described in Chap.7.

In summary, the process for simulating aircraft cruise dynamics follows these steps:
1. Simulate the Mach number using the OU process:
mk = ¯mk + Φk,mach(mk−1 −¯mk−1) + wk,mach
where wk,mach is a zero-mean, Gaussian random variable with variance Qk,mach,
and Φk,mach and Qk,mach are calculated with (6.7) and (6.8) using βmach and
qmach.
2. Simulate the control angle using the OU process:
θk = ¯θk + Φk,angle(θk−1 −¯θk−1) + wk,angle
where wk,angle is a zero-mean, Gaussian random variable with variance Qk,angle,
and Φk,angle and Qk,angle are calculated with (6.7) and (6.8) using βangle and
qangle.
3. Look up temperature in prediction table, store as Tk. Calculate true air speed as:
vk,air = mk

γ RTk
M
4. Look up wind in prediction table, store values as ¯vnorth
k,wind and ¯veast
k,wind. Simulate the
true wind using the OU process:
vnorth
k,wind = ¯vnorth
k,wind + Φk,wind(vnorth

Qk,wind, and Φk,wind and Qk,wind are calculated with (6.7) and (6.8) using βwind
and qwind.
5. Calculate ground velocity vground from air speed, control angle and wind velocity
based on mode in use, as described in Sect.6.3.
6. Using ground velocity, predict forward to calculate new position.
The lateral navigation autopilot model uses a time step of 60s. Although it is
possible to determine great elliptical paths with a very high degree of accuracy, the
wind is spatially varying and the model samples the residual wind error, so larger
steps are not appropriate. The other autopilot models use numerical approximations
to propagate the state so a shorter time step is appropriate: we used a time step of 10s.

Chapter 7
Aircraft Manoeuvre Dynamics
As discussed in the previous chapter, the dynamics model used for this analysis
consists of a sequence of deliberate manoeuvres interspersed with periods of cruise,
in which the speed and control angle are almost constant. This chapter provides
details of the statistical models used for manoeuvres. These models describe both
the frequency of the aircraft manoeuvres and how the aircraft state changes as a result
of each manoeuvre.
Three types of manoeuvre were incorporated into the model: turns, that result
in changes to the aircraft control angle; accelerations, that result in changes to the
aircraft Mach number; and vertical manoeuvres, that result in changes to the aircraft
altitude. Each type of manoeuvre was assumed to occur independently. In practice
it is common for multiple changes to occur together. The independent model does
not preclude this but it does not favour it either. Without data to build a correlated
model, independence is a pragmatic assumption.
7.1
Manoeuvre Frequency
Each of the aircraft manoeuvres can be described by three parameters: the start time
of the manoeuvre, the rate of manoeuvre (which will be assumed to be constant), and
the extent or duration of the manoeuvre. For example a turn can be deﬁned using its
start time, the rate of change of angle, and the angle turned through. We ﬁrst describe
the model for the start time of manoeuvres, which is the same for each manoeuvre
type.
The time between manoeuvres was modelled as an exponential distribution. The
exponential distribution has a single parameter, which can be interpreted as the
average time between events. The different types of manoeuvre are modelled with

a single average manoeuvre period denoted by τ. The use of a single time constant
implies an intuitive model where the aircraft can be thought to be either manoeuvring
or not, based on the level of pilot interaction. If each manoeuvre was instantaneous,
for example the speed changed from Mach 0.83 to Mach 0.81in zero seconds, then the
exponentialdistributiongivesrisetoaPoissonarrivalprocesswithanaveragenumber
of T/τ accelerations in T seconds. In practice, the model takes a ﬁnite time to change
from the pre-manoeuvre state to the post-manoeuvre state and the exponentially
distributed delay to the next manoeuvre is applied after the end of the previous
manoeuvre. The impact of this is to increase the effective average time between
manoeuvres by the average manoeuvre duration. It also imposes a maximum number
of manoeuvres in time T whereas the Poisson distribution has inﬁnite support. We
assume that each manoeuvre duration is short enough to omit it from the model
description below.

where t0 = 0 is not a turn time but makes the notation more convenient.
Similar expressions hold for the accelerations and vertical manoeuvres. Since
all three manoeuvres are assumed to occur independently, the probability of a
sequence of turns, accelerations and vertical manoeuvres is the product of the turn
sequence probability, the acceleration sequence probability and the vertical manoeu-
vre sequence probability.

7.2 Manoeuvre Extent

Manoeuvre Extent
The model requires a statistical description of how the aircraft manoeuvres as well
as when it manoeuvres. As stated above, we assume that all manoeuvres happen at
a constant rate; for example, the heading angle could change steadily at 0.5◦s−1.
For real aircraft manoeuvres, the precise value of this rate can be different but in
the context of the ﬂight prediction required for MH370, it is possible to assume
ﬁxed values without losing diversity of the sampled paths. Different rates of turn
and longitudinal accelerations were explored in earlier versions of the model but
these changes simply resulted in a negligible increase in position uncertainty after
the manoeuvre.
The aircraft turns were assumed to follow a simple bank model where the rela-
tionship between the bank angle and the angular velocity of a turn follows
ω = tan (θbank) g
v
,
(7.4)
where θbank is the aircraft bank angle and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Tight
turns with a high angular velocity require low speed or high bank angle. Varying
the bank angle was found to produce only minor variations in the overall aircraft
trajectory since turns were only a small portion of the trajectories, so a ﬁxed bank
angle of 15◦was chosen. This is nominally a steep bank for a commercial aircraft,
although well within its performance limits. At an air speed of 500kn, for example,
the turn rate would be approximately 0.6◦s−1 and a 90◦turn would take 2.5min to
perform.
The ﬁnal parameter required to characterise a turn is the duration of the turn, or
equivalently the total change in angle. The aircraft was assumed to not make turns of
more than 180◦and the change in angle was uniformly sampled from −180◦to 180◦.
It is possible for the model to sample two or more turns in very quick succession and
as such looping turns of more than 180◦are possible, though unlikely. The likelihood
of a quick succession of turns like this depends on the mean time τ.
The accelerations were also assumed to occur with a ﬁxed rate of change of
Mach. The assumed rate corresponds to a change of Mach of 0.1 in one minute.
This nominal number was not matched to aircraft performance standards but instead
simply acts to deﬁne a ﬁnite duration for each speed change. The Mach number after
an acceleration was uniformly sampled from 0.73 to 0.84; this range was chosen on
the basis of expert advice to ensure that the required ﬂight endurance is achievable.
The vertical manoeuvres were assumed to occur at a nominal rate of 4,000ft per
minute. Again this rate is not meant to model the actual typical behaviour of com-
mercial aircraft. Rather it provides a reasonable ﬁnite time extent to the manoeuvre.
The altitude after manoeuvre was uniformly selected in steps of 1,000ft between
25,000 and 43,000ft.

Aircraft Manoeuvre Dynamics
Using ﬁnite time to execute manoeuvres rather than making instantaneous changes
allows for the possibility that a measurement could have been collected during a
manoeuvre. The model retains the ground velocity vector but not the altitude rate,
so in principle it could describe measurements collected part way through a turn or
acceleration but not during climbs or descents. The vertical rate will affect a BFO
measurement but since the model only uses a nominal vertical rate it is unlikely to
match any actual vertical manoeuvre in detail. In practice, if a measurement was
collected during a turn or acceleration it would be very difﬁcult for the ﬁlter to infer
the trajectory since it would need to model the instantaneous ground speed at the
measurement time to match the measured BFO. For the C-channel data at 18:39 and
23:15 there are clusters of BFO measurements and these appear to be statistically
stationary, i.e., they do not support the premise that the aircraft is turning during
collection.
The three types of manoeuvre are independent and the distribution of manoeu-
vre extents is uniform for each type, the overall prior probability of a sequence of
turns [(tθ,1, θ1), . . . , (tθ,Nθ , θNθ )], accelerations [(ta,1, v1), . . . , (ta,Na, vNa)] and alti-
tude changes [(th,1, h1), . . . , (th,Nh, hNh)] is given by

Parameter Selection
The exponential delay model is parameterised by the average time between events,
τ. It is not clear what this value should be or even if it should be constant. In
particular one could argue that the behaviour of the aircraft during the accident ﬂight
did not match typical commercial aircraft. The average delay is therefore treated
as a constant hyperparameter that is potentially different for every hypothesised
ﬂight trajectory, but ﬁxed over time.1 A Jeffreys prior [24] was applied to the time
constant; this prior is a non-informative distribution in the sense that it is invariant
to the parameterisation used. For example, it yields the same result for the two
parameterisations of the exponential distribution, i.e., the rate parameterisation and

(well after the initial manoeuvre), but little change to the ﬁnal distribution was evident.

root of the determinant of the Fisher information; in the case of an exponential
distribution, it is given by

when manoeuvres occur every few minutes, to when manoeuvres are rare in the entire
ﬂight. A single, common parameter was drawn for all three types of manoeuvre.

common manoeuvre time constant. The aircraft state forms a Markov chain condi-
tioned on the manoeuvre parameters. The measurements (not illustrated) are condi-
tionally independent from each other given the state sequence.
7.3
Example Realisations
In order to illustrate the behaviour of the complete dynamics model, Fig.7.2 shows
example realisations of trajectories randomly sampled from the model. We emphasise
that these do not incorporate information from the SATCOM measurements, but
rather represent samples of the prior distribution over trajectories (e.g., p(x) in (3.3)).
Each trajectory starts with independent samples of the manoeuvre time constant and
initial location and velocity sampled from the accident ﬂight prior, and then draws
an independent set of sampled turns, and speed and altitude changes. The prior starts
the particles at 18:02 and the ﬁgure shows each trajectory through to 00:19, the time
of the ﬁnal SATCOM message. As the ﬁgure shows, some of the trajectories exhibit
many manoeuvres, while others do not turn or change speed at all.
The histogram of the number of turns and speed changes hypothesised by the prior
model is shown in Fig.7.3. The model is in effect a mixture of Poisson distributions,
consisting of a continuum of components ranging from very low times between
manoeuvre (six minutes) to very high times between manoeuvre (ten hours). The
distribution is the same for each type of manoeuvre since the prior distributions of
time constants are the same.

Fig. 7.3 Histograms of the number of manoeuvres selected by 200,000 independent realisations
of the model (i.e., not using any BTO/BFO measurements)
Although it is unlikely that any given trajectory will travel for more than six hours
with no manoeuvre, those that do all end up in roughly the same place. Figure7.4
shows a contour representation of the pdf of latitude and longitude at 00:19 that was
generated using 200,000 particle draws from the prior model with no measurements
and an isotropic kernel. The red diamond in the ﬁgure shows the mean of the prior.
There is a clear peak corresponding to paths that make no manoeuvre. This is smeared
around an arc corresponding to paths that turn once but maintain a steady speed and
also radially from the start point corresponding to paths that do not turn but do change
speed. The model samples a hyperparameter for the time between manoeuvres from
a prior that covers 0.1 to 10h. When a particle samples a very high value for the time
constant it is unlikely to choose to manoeuvre. Where manoeuvres were selected it
was again unlikely to choose to change speed and direction, leading to the contours
shown. The altitude behaviour of the model is not visualised in the ﬁgure. There
is an approximately circular region around the initialisation point where the pdf is
elevated. This corresponds to particles that have sampled a very small time between
manoeuvres: these turn so much that they circle back on themselves repeatedly and
are effectively trapped close to their starting location. Beyond this circle, the pdf is

Solution of the Bayesian estimation method described in Chap.3 requires one to
recursively integrate the aircraft dynamics pdf (3.6) and multiply it by the likelihood
(3.7). Since the measurement model is highly nonlinear and the dynamics model is
hybrid discrete-continuous, there is no way to produce a closed form posterior distri-
bution. An alternative is to approximate the distribution numerically. As introduced
in Sect.3.2, the Sample-Importance-Resample (SIR) particle ﬁlter draws random
samples from the dynamics model and weights them according to the measurement
likelihood. This amounts to approximating the posterior distribution as
p(xk|Zk) ≈

where the wp

to as particles. The convergence properties of this approximation in the limit as the
number of particles P increases have been well studied, e.g. [14, 21]. In the SIR
version of the particle ﬁlter, the particles are randomly generated from the dynamics
model and the weights are

A problem with sampling from the dynamics is that this can be a very diffuse
distribution. In the MH370 case, the model allows for turns and speed and altitude
changes, and potentially several of each can be sampled between measurements.
The proportion of particles that sample a trajectory close to the measurements will
be small and a very large number of samples will be required to capture the high
probability regions. This is a well known issue for ﬁltering in high dimensional state
spaces.

Resampling is one strategy that is used to improve the number of particles follow-
ing trajectories with relatively high likelihood. It does this in a sequential manner,
in which at each time step unlikely particles are replaced with copies of high likely
particles though a random sampling process. Initial approaches used these conven-
tional techniques, but it was found to be preferable to be able to process very high
particle counts and to adaptively increase the number of particles used until it was
possible to identify an adequate number of likely paths, rather than processing a
pre-speciﬁed number of particles for each time step sequentially. To achieve this par-
ticles were propagated and weighted individually; this also reduced the size of the
data structures required and allowed preliminary results to be extracted as the ﬁlter
was executing. The approach adopted was a form of branching mechanism which
repeatedly constructs full trajectories.
The method resampled each particle separately, branching a new set of particles
from each parent instead of resampling a ﬁxed number of particles across all of the
particles at a given time. The branching naturally leads to an exponential growth
in the number of particles with time and this was mitigated by pruning extremely
unlikely paths when their likelihood became too low. This approach is not necessarily
computationally efﬁcient, but in this particular application it was more important to
broadly explore the enormous state space than to minimise computational effort.
To motivate the approach, suppose that the distribution prior to resampling is
approximated by (8.1), such that integrals can be approximated as

Thus resampling can also be implemented through a randomised branching proce-
dure, recursively adapting the number of particles. This permits a form of depth-ﬁrst
search, which adaptively performs more branching when likely paths result, and
tends to prune paths which have low probability.

8 Particle Filter Implementation
57
For our experiments, we chose a procedure which branches quite aggressively
when likely paths are discovered, and prunes extremely unlikely paths. Likely paths
are duplicated to form ¯n branches. This is implemented by setting

parent particle p with wp
k < η, ˜w ˜p
k = 1, but most commonly the sub-tree will be
pruned.
8.1
BFO Bias
The BFO measurement has a bias term that was not able to be adequately calibrated,
as discussed in Sect.5.3. The model treats this bias as an random variable with a
given prior density. It is possible to sample the bias along with the aircraft states but
a more efﬁcient implementation is to use a Rao-Blackwellised particle ﬁlter [15, 29,
38]. Conditioned on the other states we can write a simpliﬁed BFO measurement
model
zBFO
k
= ˆzBFO
k
+ δf bias + wBFO
k
,
(8.7)
where ˆzBFO
k
is constant because all of the other states, such as aircraft location and
velocity, are known because of the conditioning. This conditional measurement equa-
tion is clearly linear in the bias and the noise is modelled as Gaussian, so the posterior
distribution of the bias can be determined using a Kalman ﬁlter update.
8.2
Algorithm
In practical terms, the algorithm proceeds by repeating the following process for
each particle:
1. Randomly sample an average time between manoeuvres τ.
2. Randomly sample a starting state x0 (position, Mach, control angle and altitude)
from the prior at t0 =18:01:49, which is described in Chap.4.
3. Initialise the BFO bias Kalman ﬁlter.
4. Perform the following recursion, starting with the sample at x0 and measurement
time index k = 1:
a. Draw a sample of the trajectory from xk−1 to xk using the hyperparameter τ
for selection of turns, speed changes and altitude changes.

58

Particle Filter Implementation
b. Calculate the measurement likelihood p (zk|xk) and use it to update the tra-
jectory weight wp
k = p (zk|xk) wp
k−1.
c. Use the sampled trajectory to update the BFO bias Kalman ﬁlter.
d. If we have reached the ﬁnal measurement k = K, store the trajectory and
weight.
e. Otherwise, if the accumulated weight is too low, i.e., wp
k < η then branch a
single time with probability wp
k and weight ˜w ˜p
k = 1, terminating the recur-
sion branch with probability (1 −wp
k ); otherwise, branch ¯n times to process
remaining time steps with weight ˜w ˜p
k = wp
k /¯n.
The particle weights constructed by the method are not normalised. A normalisa-
tion step is performed when the ﬁnal set of weights at the last time point is used to
construct the required pdf. The process in step 4a, namely sampling a trajectory, is
critical and is realised through a ﬁnite time difference implementation given by the
following steps:
1. Randomly sample times to make the next turn, speed change and altitude change
2. While the current sample time is before the next measurement time, tk

a. If the current sample time is the time of a manoeuvre (turn, speed change or
altitude change), then execute the manoeuvre and sample a new time to make
the next manoeuvre
b. Otherwise predict ahead 10s (or to the next manoeuvre or measurement,
whichever occurs ﬁrst)
A manoeuvre is executed by making a sequence of 1s steps. For each step the
angle, speed or altitude is incremented and the aircraft position is predicted ahead.
The increments continue until the new desired angle, speed or altitude is achieved.
The procedure for state prediction under cruise dynamics is summarised in Sect.6.6.
The state vector used for the model is given in Table8.1. There are a large number
of parameters involved with this model and the full description of these is provided
in Table8.2.

Assumptions
The key assumptions used by the ﬁlter are:
1. The radar data provides an accurate estimate of the aircraft trajectory up to
18:01:49. If, for example, the radar track used to build the prior were actually
from a different aircraft, the predicted pdf would be invalid. Discarding the radar
data leads to a signiﬁcant broadening of the search zone, and accident investiga-
tors believe the radar data to be correctly associated with MH370. Chapter10.6
considers an alternative analysis which ignores the radar data.
2. The measurement error characteristics are known. The pdf of BTO and BFO
measurements, in particular the standard deviation of each, is provided to the
algorithm as a known input. Extensive study of the statistics of these measure-
ments has been undertaken and the distributions assumed are well characterised,
subject to the caveats discussed in Chap.5. Incremental changes, such as minor
inﬂation of the assumed BTO variance would lead to incremental changes in the
ﬁlter output.
3. The aircraft cruises in one of ﬁve prescribed modes and does not change between
them (other than a single possible change from lateral navigation to constant
magnetic/true heading). It is possible that the whole ﬂight was continually under
manual control but it is highly unlikely. The use of typical autopilot modes is
reasonable.
4. Inﬁnite fuel: the fuel constraints on the aircraft can be applied to the pdf after-
wards. In the simplest case, maximum reachable ranges could be used to censor
impossible trajectories. However, analysis of candidate trajectories has indicated
that the majority are feasible. Broad information about the fuel consumption rate
of the aircraft has been used to inform the range of allowable Mach numbers.
5. The ﬂuctuations in speed, angle and the error in wind velocity are well-modelled
by the OU process. The parameters of the OU model were selected to model these
quantities based on recorded data from real ﬂights.
6. The random turn and speed change model is rich enough to describe the real
aircraft dynamics and the implicit preferred path for the model does not bias
prediction. Validation results in the next chapter show that the model successfully
produces pdfs containing the true aircraft location for the available instrumented
ﬂights that include air speed changes, altitude changes and angle changes.
7. The aircraft air speed is limited to the range Mach 0.73–0.84. Fuel consumption
becomes very inefﬁcient at speeds higher than this and at lower speeds the aircraft
is not able to match the measurements. In practice it is likely that the viable range
of speeds is actually much narrower than this.
8. In Chap.10, the pdf of the location of the aircraft at 00:19 is combined with
a distribution of aircraft translation during descent, to give a ﬁnal search zone.

8.3 Assumptions
61
This distribution was developed by ATSB [5] and largely determines the width of
the search area along the 00:19 arc. It is assumed that this distribution adequately
models the true descent scenario.

Chapter 9
Validation Experiments
The variable rate model developed for MH370 was validated by analysing data from
a collection of ﬂights where the true aircraft location was known; we refer to these
as validation ﬂights. A total of six validation ﬂights were used for testing. Data was
available from a larger number of ﬂights but the majority of these were in relatively
short segments of less than three hours. There were only a few that maintained
communications with the satellite Inmarsat-3F1 for longer periods and it was not
thought productive to examine the prediction performance over time segments shorter
than three hours. Of the six ﬂights, four are previous ﬂights of the accident aircraft,
9M-MRO, and the other two are ﬂights of different aircraft that occurred at the same
time as the accident ﬂight. Three of the ﬂights are relatively short and are between
locations inside Asia, and the other three are ﬂights from Asia to Europe.
The data available for the accident ﬂight consists of mostly R1200 communication
messages at approximately one hour intervals. In order to emulate the measurement
information content, measurement data sets were formed by randomly sub-sampling
R1200 communication messages from the validation ﬂights. Ten different subsets
were formed for each validation ﬂight, resulting in a total of sixty validation mea-
surement sets. Multiple sets were drawn from each ﬂight to increase the statistical
signiﬁcance of the testing data set. They also serve to illustrate the sensitivity of
the method to the precise measurement times and values. The measurement subsets
were selected using a randomised process that aimed to achieve an average time
between measurements of one hour. For the analysis we treat the measurement sub-
sets as independent Monte Carlo trials. However there are several variables that are
in common within the group of ten subsets of a single ﬂight: the aircraft geometry
is obviously the same for each subset since they are drawn from the same ﬂight; the
residual wind errors are the same; and the BFO is known to have a slowly varying
bias, so there can be correlation in the BFO measurements from different subsets if
those subsets choose measurements at similar times. Finally, some subsets may in
fact randomly choose the same measurement as another subset.

Validation Experiments
In each validation ﬂight, the true aircraft location was obtained from the Aircraft
Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) data logs. Sections
of the ﬂight immediately after take-off and prior to landing were not included in
the analysis since the aircraft dynamics are very different at these times and it is
unlikely that sparse satellite messages would be sufﬁcient to follow it. For the longer
ﬂights into Europe, the aircraft changed satellites part way through the ﬂight so
it was not possible to use the whole ﬂight: these were truncated near the end of
messaging via the Indian Ocean Region satellite. The ﬁlter was initialised using the
true aircraft location, speed and control angle with a Gaussian random error. The
standard deviation of the initialisation error was chosen to be the same as the prior
for the accident ﬂight, that is 0.4◦in latitude and longitude, 1◦in angle and Mach
0.03in air speed. For every subset the posterior pdf at the ﬁnal measurement was
predicted ahead to a common time, corresponding to an exact ACARS reporting
time. This predicted pdf is compared with the ACARS report.
This chapter ﬁrst explains the particular characteristics of each ﬂight and presents
an example output pdf for one of the measurement sets. This output is subjectively
compared with the ACARS truth. The statistical analysis is then presented using
an objective performance measure over the sixty validation subsets. Table9.1 lists
the six validation ﬂights used for the analysis and gives comments on some of the
characteristics of each. The ﬂights are ordered by time.

9.1
9M-MRO 26 February 2014 Kuala Lumpur
to Amsterdam
The ﬁrst validation ﬂight was from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam on 26 February
2014. This ﬂight was around 7.5h long but is relatively straight. Figure9.1 sum-
marises the features of the ﬂight: the upper plot shows a geographic plan; the lower
three plots show the aircraft altitude as a function of time, the aircraft heading as a
function of time, and the aircraft Mach number as a function of time. Vertical dotted
lines show the start and end of the time segment selected for the test. This ﬂight con-
tained an eclipse event so the validation also supports the Inmarsat eclipse correction
[2].
Figure9.2 shows the ﬁltered pdf for the Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam ﬂight visu-
alised using a three dimensional representation in Google Earth. The ﬁlter pdf is
deﬁned over a high dimensional space but for visualisation we examine the marginal
position distribution in latitude and longitude. Because the BTO measurement error
is relatively small the position distribution is centred on an arc of zero BTO error
and has a narrow off-arc width. For the visualisation we marginalise the distribu-
tion onto the zero BTO error arc and encode the probability density for each point
along the arc using altitude: points on the curve higher above the earth correspond
to higher probability. A white curve on the map marks the ACARS reported aircraft
location, a yellow marker denotes the location of the aircraft at each measurement
time. The ﬁgure also shows a representative selection of the paths sampled by the
ﬁlter. The selection shows the highest probability path arriving at each point around
the arc: the colour of the path shows the marginal probability at that location on the
arc (using a colour map similar to Fig.5.7, i.e., blue is least likely, red is most likely).
There are a number of paths that end in signiﬁcantly different locations to the
truth. These occur because in this ﬂight the aircraft travels in a direction that is
almost horizontally radial from the satellite. While the aircraft moves towards the
satellite its initial dynamics constrain the plausible paths but once it passes through
the point of closest approach and begins to move away then it is possible to make
turns that result in different near-radial paths. The support of these ambiguous paths is
disjoint because of the ﬁnite number of samples: the true underlying pdf has support
all the way around the arc. Without dynamic constraints the location of the peak of
the pdf is simply a function of measurement noise.
9.2
9M-MRO 2 March 2014 Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur
The ﬂight from Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur is the shortest validation ﬂight selected.
Figure9.3 summarises the features of the ﬂight: there is a single minor altitude change
and the Mach number remains relatively constant. The aircraft heading gradually
reduces for most of the ﬂight, turning the aircraft more to the North but a veer near
the end turns it back to the South-East. The BFO measurements for this ﬂight contain
several outliers that are more than 30Hz away from other measurements at similar
times.

Figure9.4 shows the pdf output from the ﬁlter; the true ACARS aircraft location
is again under the main peak of the pdf. The pdf might appear to be relatively spread
compared with some of the other ﬂights, but the scale is much smaller in this case
because the ﬂight is short.
9.3
9M-MRO 6 March 2014 Kuala Lumpur to Beijing
This ﬂight is the MH370 route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing that was ﬂown by
the accident aircraft 9M-MRO on 6 March 2014, i.e., the day prior to the accident
ﬂight. Figure9.5 summarises the features of the ﬂight: the ﬂight contained a single
altitude change and several turns. Observe that there are several times where the
heading changes for a short time before reverting back to the previous long-term
value. These course corrections have the impact of translating the ﬂight path and
then returning to the previous ground velocity vector: in effect they are a kind of
S-turn manoeuvre. If one or more of these corrections occurs between measurements
then the most likely paths can be biased because there are no measurements to hint
that the manoeuvres have occurred and the S-turn trajectory is less probable under
the dynamics model than a constant angle path.
Figure9.6 shows the pdf from the ﬁlter: the pdf is multi-modal with three main
peaks that are somewhat blurred together. There was a heading change just before the
last measurement and the lack of future data makes it impossible to resolve exactly
what manoeuvre led to the change in range rate. One of the peaks of the pdf is clearly
centred close to the true location.
9.4
9M-MRO 7 March 2014 Beijing to Kuala Lumpur
This ﬂight is the MH371 route that was ﬂown by the accident aircraft 9M-MRO on the
morning of 7 March 2014 and is the return ﬂight from Beijing back to Kuala Lumpur.
Figure9.7 summarises the features of the ﬂight: there were three altitude changes
and two main heading changes, the ﬁrst of which was almost immediately after the
start of the validation segment. This ﬂight does not contain the S-turn manoeuvres
that were present in the previous ﬂight. In addition to the altitude changes the Mach
number of the aircraft changed from 0.83 to 0.82. Each of these leads to a change
in air speed. This ﬂight contained several anomalous BTO measurements that were
corrected using the empirical adjustment described in Chap.5.
Figure9.8 shows the pdf output from the ﬁlter; the true ACARS aircraft location
is again under the main peak of the pdf. The peak is more spread because the altitude
changes and Mach change modify the radial speed between the aircraft and the
satellite. The resulting BFO measurements can also be explained by course changes:
the aircraft could change speed or it could turn slightly. The BFO measurement is not
informative enough to discriminate strongly between these and there is not enough
subsequent data to see which is more consistent with BTO progression.

7 March 2014 Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam
This ﬂight was from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam and is the same ﬂight path as the
ﬁrst validation ﬂight but with a different aircraft. Figure9.9 summarises the features
of the ﬂight: the aircraft climbs with a sequence of vertical manoeuvres and there is
a large S-turn manoeuvre near to the end of the analysed ﬂight segment.
Figure9.10 shows the pdf output from the ﬁlter. The true ACARS aircraft location
is under the main peak of the pdf but in this case the true location is lower in the
tails than in the other cases. The numerical results that follow in Sect.9.7 show that
this ﬂight had the worst overall performance of the validation ﬂights, although, as
discussed in the next section, for each subset of measurements, the ﬁnal location
is within the region containing 85% of the probability distribution, i.e., the highest
posterior density (HPD) interval, discussed further in Sect.9.7.2.
9.6
7 March 2014 Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt
The ﬁnal validation ﬂight was from Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt. Figure9.11 sum-
marises the features of the ﬂight. It shows the full ﬂight path, but the communica-
tions satellite changes part way through and the test section ﬁnishes where the box
is marked on the map. No Mach information was available for this ﬂight. There
was a large heading deviation mid-ﬂight, but the aircraft eventually reverted back
to the earlier heading: this kind of compound manoeuvre is difﬁcult for the ﬁlter to
characterise. This ﬂight also contained outlier BFO measurements.
Figure9.12 shows the pdf output from the ﬁlter. The performance on this ﬂight is
quite similar to the Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam ﬂights. The ﬁlter has again identiﬁed
ambiguous paths due to the relative geometry.
9.7
Quantitative Analysis
The examples above present a qualitative measure of performance but a more rig-
orous objective measure is required to provide a statistical assessment of the ﬁlter
output. So far we have been satisﬁed that the true location has been in an area of
reasonable support for the pdf, but is the spread of the pdf appropriate and is the
mode of the distribution biased? Answers to questions such as these require a much
larger ensemble of test data. However, it has not been feasible to collect the required
test measurements for dozens of different ﬂights. In order to increase our conﬁdence
in the performance for the relatively small set of ﬂights that is available, multi-
ple communication measurement sets were generated for each ﬂight by randomly
selecting individual R1200 messages from the communication logs of each ﬂight.

Validation Experiments
The selection process was repeated 10 times for each ﬂight and these 10 measure-
ment sets are treated as independent Monte Carlo random trials for a ﬁxed true air-
craft trajectory. As discussed in Chap.5, the BFO measurement errors are not truly
independent over short time periods, which somewhat compromises the assumed
independence. However, the common geometry of multiple sets from a single ﬂight
is the dominant source of correlation amongst single-ﬂight predictions.
We now brieﬂy review the method used to select individual messages and the
performance measure used for this analysis. The chapter concludes with numerical
results from these sixty measurement sets.
9.7.1
Measurement Selection
The start and end time for analysis was manually selected for each ﬂight. These times
were chosen to exclude ascent from take-off and descent to landing as well as to avoid
turns that were very close to either end point. Once these times were determined,
the individual measurements were selected using a heuristic randomised process.
The intent of this process was to avoid manual selection bias and to create measure-
ment sets that emulate the data available for the accident ﬂight. Measurements were
selected recursively.
Let tk−1 denote the measurement time for the previous measurement; t0 is the man-
ually selected starting time. Each measurement has a collection time labelled t j, for
j ∈{1, . . . , J}, where J is the total number of measurements in the communication
log. The ﬁrst measurement was selected by assigning a probability

Fig. 9.13 Example measurement timings for a single ﬂight
Measurement (i + 1) is again selected using a single draw on a multinomial distrib-
ution deﬁned by p j(i + 1). The process concludes when the measurement selected
occurs after the desired end time: this measurement is discarded.
Figure9.13 shows an example of the measurement times for the ten different sets
generated for the Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam ﬂight on 26 February 2014. Squares
are used to mark the initialisation time and the ﬁnal time point, neither of which
have measurements. The measurement times are marked with circles. Each row is
a realisation of the measurement selection process. Some measurements are used
by more than one of the sets. The number of measurements selected varies between
eight and ten, the duration of the ﬂight segment is approximately seven hours and
35min: seven one-hour spaces would lead to eight measurements in seven hours.

Performance Measure
In the object tracking literature it is common to use accuracy measures to quan-
tify tracking performance, for example [7]. Accuracy measures quantify how well
the estimates from the tracker match the truth. The most frequently used accuracy
measure is root-mean-square (RMS) error, which is typically the average geometric
distance between the true object position and the tracker estimated position. The
requirement for MH370 is a search region, not a point estimate, so RMS is not

applicable. The other common accuracy measure is the Normalised Estimation Error
Squared (NEES). This is deﬁned as the expectation of the inner product of the esti-
mation error with itself, normalised by the estimator covariance. For a scalar, this
is the mean squared error divided by the ﬁlter covariance estimate. Whereas RMS
quantiﬁes how accurately the ﬁlter ﬁnds the centre of mass of a distribution, NEES
quantiﬁes how accurately the ﬁlter estimates the spread of a distribution. NEES
inherently assumes a uni-modal distribution. Again, NEES is based on an assumed
Gaussian system with a point estimate and covariance estimate. It is not an appro-
priate measure for the multi-modal pdf produced by the ﬁlter in this application.
Instead, the statistical performance of the ﬁlter output was quantiﬁed by measuring
the highest posterior density (HPD) interval at the true aircraft location. The HPD
interval is deﬁned as the spatial region for which the ﬁlter output pdf is at least as high
as the value at the true location. Figure9.14 shows an example of this process for a
scalar random variable x with a Gaussian mixture pdf p(x). The two components
are equally weighted, one with mean 2 and variance 0.25 and the other with mean 5
and unit variance. Supposing that the truth in this case was x = 6, the HPD interval
is shaded in red and corresponds to the regions in x for which p(x) ≥p(6). Because
the distribution p(x) has two modes and the value of p(6) is between the lower peak
and the intermediate minimum, the HPD is composed of two intervals. If the truth
had been 2.5 instead then only one region around the higher peak at 2 would be in the
HPD and if the truth were 8 then almost all of the pdf would be in the HPD region.
The integral of the pdf over the HPD interval corresponds to the cumulative
probability that a random sample from the distribution is more likely than the truth
point. If the integral is close to unity, then the HPD interval contains most of the

support of the pdf, that is the truth point is at a very low part of the pdf. Alternatively,
if the integral under the HPD is close to zero then only a small portion of the event
space is more likely than the truth point.
Mathematically, the HPD integral is given by
h

=

(9.5)
where xtruth is the true aircraft location and p(x) is the ﬁlter output pdf. In the
discussion that follows, we abbreviate as h ≡h

xtruth; p(x)

the random variable
derived by transforming the random variable xtruth using (9.5).
If the truth values were indeed random samples from the ﬁlter output pdfs, then it
is relatively easy to show that the distribution of h would be uniform on the interval
[0, 1].1 If integrals tend to be clumped closer to zero then the pdfs being assessed are
pessimistic: the tails decay too slowly and the coverage of the pdf is too broad. If the
integrals tend to be clumped closer to unity then the truth is always in the tails and
the pdfs being assessed are overly optimistic. For the MH370 search deﬁnition we
prefer a conservative pdf that is a little pessimistic, in order to minimise the chance of
excluding the true aircraft location. Provided the search zone deﬁned can be feasibly
measured it is better to make this region a little too large and improve the likelihood
that the truth is contained.
For each ﬂight we have only ten different measurement sets so it is not feasible to
construct a sensible estimate of p(h). Instead we plot an estimate of its cumulative
distribution and compare it with the line y = x, which is the cumulative distribution
of a uniform random variable. If the h values are relatively small then the empirical
cumulative distribution function (cdf) will rise more quickly than the reference and
the curve will be above it. Conversely if the values are relatively large then the
empirical cdf will rise slowly and the curve will be below the reference.
9.7.3
Results
Figure9.15 shows the empirical cdf derived for each validation ﬂight separately. This
shows that the results within a single ﬂight are quite correlated because the ﬁlter
performance is dependent on geometry. For the Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala
Lumpur to Beijing and Beijing to Kuala Lumpur ﬂights the h values are generally
small but not close to zero. This indicates that the spread of the ﬁlter pdf is too high
1To see this, let Y = p(x), i.e., the random variable obtained by applying the random value x to
its pdf. Then the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of Y, FY (y) = P(Y ≤y) is one minus the
HPD value in (9.5). It is well-known that, assuming continuity and monotonicity of the cdf, the
random variable obtained by passing a random value through its cdf is uniform on the interval [0, 1]
(e.g., [13]), and if Y is uniform on [0, 1], then so is 1 −Y. The necessary assumptions are satisﬁed
if the pdf p(x) contains no non-zero ﬂat regions and no Dirac delta components.

and that the peak of the pdf is biased. The bias occurs because the ﬂights make small
manoeuvres that are unobservable by the ﬁlter. For example, Fig.9.5 shows that in the
Kuala Lumpur to Beijing ﬂight the aircraft made a number of heading changes that
lasted for only a short time before the heading reverted back to its previous value. The
minor course corrections result in a displacement in position. The ﬁlter will sample
these paths but their dynamics are less likely than paths without a manoeuvre. For
these ﬂights the mode is not a reliable indicator of the true aircraft location but a
fairly tight interval is.
In the longer Asia to Europe ﬂights the h values tend to spread between 0.25 and
0.8. Again there is bias due to the repeated geometry and very large values are not
observed because the model allows manoeuvres that are more dynamic than what
occurred in the actual ﬂights and this spreads the pdf.
Figure9.16 combines all of the trials into a single h cumulative distribution. In
this plot the two different groups of ﬂights are apparent: there is an initial very sharp
rise due to the contributions of the intra-Asia ﬂights and then a gradual climb from
the Asia to Europe ﬂights.
Overall the results show that for all of the ﬂights and measurement combina-
tions tested the true aircraft location was inside a 85% conﬁdence region of the
pdf. That is, the largest h value observed was approximately 0.85. This means that
the pdf estimates are conservative. The spread of the estimated pdf is wider than
the spread of true values. This occurs for two reasons: ﬁrstly, the aircraft dynamic

model provides more ﬂexibility than is typically used; for example, in most com-
mercial ﬂights, smaller turns are more likely than turns of 90◦or more. Secondly, the
assumed measurement variances were deliberately inﬂated to be pessimistic, as dis-
cussed in Sect.5.3. Given that the accident ﬂight was not a typical commercial ﬂight,
the dynamic model should not be exactly matched to typical commercial ﬂights. A
somewhat conservative pdf in this case is desirable so long as the pdf does not spread
over an area that is unreasonably large to search.

Chapter 10
Application to the MH370 Accident
The previous chapters have constructed a Bayesian method for estimating
commercial aircraft trajectories using models of the information contained in satel-
lite communications messages and of the aircraft dynamics. This chapter applies the
estimator to the accident ﬂight. We show the pdf at the ﬁnal message time 00:19 and
perform several tests that provide conﬁdence in the robustness to the model parame-
ters and measurement characterisation. Probable end of ﬂight dynamics are used to
convert the pdf in the air at 00:19 into an ocean search zone. As a further measure of
robustness, we show that the model can be initialised at the end of the initial ascent,
as was done in the validation ﬂights, and the output pdf remains in the same broad
geographic region, even without using the subsequent primary and secondary radar
data.
Table10.1 summarises the available measurement data and the BTO measurement
standard deviation, when applicable, since this depends on the message type. The two
anomalous R1200 messages and the R600 message occurred during transient phases
of operation for the SATCOM equipment so the BFO values reported for these times
cannot be used. The BTO measurement variance is also inﬂated to account for the
uncertainty in the correction term.

The Filter Applied to the Accident Flight
This section summarises the results of applying the variable rate particle ﬁlter to the
data available for the accident ﬂight. We consider two different treatments of the
measurements. Figure10.1 shows the Google Earth pdf representation for the case
where only BTO measurements were used. As with the validation ﬂights, the colour
coded paths show the most likely routes to each latitude. Clearly this distribution
is multimodal. Based on BTO data, it can be deduced that the aircraft must have
manoeuvred in some way between 18:28 and 19:41. However the BTO measurements

Fig. 10.1 Set of paths from 18:02 to 00:19 using only BTO measurement weighting (i.e., not using
any BFO measurements)
are consistent with two options: heading broadly North or broadly South. Many of
the paths turn very early, almost immediately after initialisation. This is because the
BTO arc at 18:25 is not consistent with the radial speed prescribed by the initial
speed and direction. The 18:22 radar point, while potentially inaccurate, implies that
no turn had occurred at that stage and that the speed may have changed. Due to
the questions surrounding its accuracy, the ﬁlter does not use this radar point, so it
postulates early direction changes as well as early speed changes to match the 18:25
BTO. A feature of most of the paths is that they do not choose to make subsequent
turns even though there is no BFO data to inﬂuence angle likelihood. The BTO data
itself from 19:41 onwards is consistent with straight and level ﬂight.

Fig. 10.2 Set of paths from 18:02 to 00:19 using BTO and BFO measurement weighting. Purple
box shows the November 2015 indicative search region
Figure10.2 shows how this path set is pruned by including BFO data. The crucial
BFO measurements are at 18:28 and 18:39. The ﬁrst of these is consistent with the
same heading as at initialisation, so it implies that the aircraft has not yet turned.
In contrast, as discussed in Sect.5.4, the 18:39 BFO measurement indicates that the
aircraft is moving roughly South at this time. Between the two, these measurements
restrict the time of the turn to a window between 18:28 and 18:39. This is reﬂected
in the set of surviving paths. Paths that went very far South had to turn earlier and
have been rejected as have all of the paths heading to the North towards Asia. The
plot also shows the indicative search region as at November 2015, displayed as a
purple box.
The main effect of including BFO data is to resolve the ambiguity about the
manoeuvre after 18:28. The BFO data does not signiﬁcantly change the shape of the
Southern mode of the pdf. To show this more clearly Fig.10.3 plots the two pdfs,
without and with BFO data, as one dimensional curves parameterised by latitude.
The latitude is a nonlinear function of the position around the BTO arc so these pdfs
are distorted slightly, but they clearly show the effect of the BFO data: it selects the
mode from a multimodal pdf but it does not signiﬁcantly change the mode shape.
Because of this, including only the C-channel BFO measurement has the same effect
and changing the assumed BFO noise standard deviation has no signiﬁcant effect
either unless it could be artiﬁcially reduced to less than 1Hz. We conducted several
experimentsthatvariedtheassumedBFOnoiseandwhichBFOvalueswereincluded.
The results are consistent with the curves in Fig.10.3.

Manoeuvre Statistics
An interesting question is whether the posterior pdf output from the ﬁlter provides
any strong estimate of the number and type of manoeuvres after the loss of primary
radar coverage. To address this we compare the probability mass of the number of
turns for the case of no measurements, i.e., the prior probability from predictions
used to create the enormous disc pdf in Fig.7.4, and the posterior probability after
applying the measurements. These are shown in Figs.7.3 and 10.4 respectively. The
posterior distribution does not count turns made between 00:11 and 00:19 because
the BFO data at 00:19 is not used (as it is believed to be unreliable); this permits
the ﬁlter to make superﬂuous manoeuvres. The histograms were created by counting
the number of manoeuvres performed by each particle and then scaling their con-
tribution to the histogram by the particle weight. In the prior probability there is a
signiﬁcant probability of making a very large number of manoeuvres. The particles
that contribute to this part of the histogram are those that have selected very short
mean manoeuvre times τ.
The histograms show that the posterior number of turns has reduced dramatically,
as has the number of speed changes. The likelihood of selecting a sequence of random

Fig. 10.4 Histogram of posterior number of turns and speed changes
speeds that average out to a suitable overall speed is relatively high. Since there
is usually at least an hour between BTO arcs, the ﬁlter has time to make several
speed changes. Only the average of these speeds inﬂuences the position and hence
the BTO. As discussed several times, the BFO is sufﬁciently uninformative that the
instantaneous velocity at the measurement time is only loosely constrained. However,
it is unlikelythat asequenceof randomturns will “cancel eachother out,”andtheﬁlter
ﬁnds very few paths that string together multiple turns when a straight path would
sufﬁce. The low support for turns leads to selection of longer mean manoeuvre times,
which in turn suppresses superﬂuous speed changes.
The turn histogram indicates that around half of the paths made more than a single
turn. This would appear to be of interest but is in fact misleading. Figure10.5 shows
the posterior distribution of angle as a function of time. The greyscale image shows
the probability density at each time slice; the darkest points are most likely. The solid
line shows the mean and one-sigma error bars indicate the standard deviation. Note
that the horizontal scale is measurement index, not time, but time values are used
to label the measurements to give perspective. The angle plot shows that there are
a number of particles that make a very small turn before 18:28 and then follow this
with a second turn between 18:28 and 18:39. The result is very similar to making a
single turn through the same total angle. Similarly, there are a number of particles that
make a turn before 18:39 and then a second very small turn immediately afterwards.
Again, this is approximately equivalent to a single turn through the same total angle.

The apparent large number of double turns is really just a single turn being broken
into two segments. There appears to be very few genuine turns later in the ﬂight.
Figure10.6 shows the marginal distribution of the Mach number between 18:02
and 00:19. The prior is uniform in Mach between 0.73 and 0.84 but the posterior
strongly prefers the higher speed part of this range. This is approximately consistent
with the most likely speeds for the aircraft over long durations.

measurement residual errors. If the estimates were exactly the truth then the residual

be uncorrelated, zero mean, and spread consistently with the measurement noise
variance. Figure10.7 shows the marginal distributions of the residual measurement
errors. The ﬁlter predicts the BTO and BFO at the measurement times based on
the estimated position and velocity and the residual is the difference between these

predictions and the measured values. Each sample is weighted according to its overall
likelihood and the combination gives the marginals in Fig.10.7. The horizontal axis
is again the measurement index and the vertical axis is residual error, dark points
have high probability, and the error bars show the one-sigma limits. The ﬁgure also
overlays the one-sigma lines for the assumed measurement noise. For BTO this varies
with the message type, for BFO it is a ﬁxed ±7Hz. There is no BTO measurement
for the C channel communications that occurred at 18:39 and 23:14. The BFO has
been discarded at 18:25 and 00:19 since these readings are thought to be unreliable.
The plots only show residuals when a valid measurement is available.
For the BTO residual there are two larger residuals on the ﬁnal two measurements.
These measurements are actually very close together in time: the ﬁrst is an R600
message at 00:19:29 and the second is an R1200 message at 00:19:37. The reason
why both of these measurements show large residuals is that they are not consistent
with each other: the residuals have opposite signs, reﬂecting that one measurement
is longer in range than the prediction and the other is shorter. In the absence of a
reason to prefer one over the other, we use both measurements and let the ﬁlter ﬁnd
paths that are the best statistical ﬁt. The BFO residuals are statistically consistent
with the empirical error model.
10.4
Posterior Distribution of Manoeuvre Time Constant
The inference procedure that has been developed samples the manoeuvre time con-
stant, which is a static parameter. In the case of conventional particle resampling, this
is not advisable, as subsequent resampling steps generally leave few distinct values
of the static parameter. The recursive resampling process described in Chap.8 is less
prone to this difﬁculty, as many independent sample paths are retained.
The sample support of the posterior distribution of the manoeuvre time constant
is demonstrated in Fig.10.8. The diagram clearly shows that the distribution is non-
degenerate. The ﬁgure compares the posterior distribution from the ﬁlter, which is
shown as bars, with the Jeffreys prior, which is shown as a red line. The Jeffreys
prior prefers lower mean manoeuvre times but the data does not support these. The
posterior is dominated by longer mean manoeuvre times, with 97% of the distribution
having a mean time between manoeuvres of more than one hour, and 83% having a
mean time more than two hours.
10.5
End of Flight
The output of the particle ﬁlter is an estimate of the pdf of the aircraft state at 00:19.
The aircraft was still in the air at this time and a model is required to describe the
distribution of how it may have descended. This has been primarily the responsibility
of the ATSB and the other members of the search team. A discussion of the different

methods used to model the potential motion is presented in [5]. The model for aircraft
motion after 00:19 leads to a prioritisation of the search along and around the ﬁnal
BTO arc.
Quantitatively, the model of descent deﬁnes a transition distribution p(xﬁnal|xK),
which describes the probability density of the ﬁnal state given the state at time 00:19.
In effect this acts as a kernel to spread the distribution at 00:19 via the expression

The analysis in [5] leads to a probable scenario where the aircraft ran out of fuel
at some time between 00:11 and 00:19. The ﬁnal satellite communications message
could be due to the modem rebooting under auxiliary power. Under this hypothesis,
the aircraft engines were already unpowered at 00:19. The spread of the kernel
function is then determined by the distance over which the aircraft could have moved,
which depends on whether or not the aircraft was under human control during this
period.
Flight simulator studies of uncontrolled descents have shown a high likelihood
of the aircraft reaching zero altitude within 15nm of the beginning of descent [5].
However, the beginning of descent is not known. It is possible for the aircraft to have
travelled farther, especially if a human was controlling the aircraft. As an indicative
kernel, and following advice from the ATSB, a uniform disc of radius 15nm with
a Gaussian drop off with standard deviation 30nm beyond this was chosen; this
represents the accident investigators’ assessment of the likely scenarios. Figure10.9
shows a radial slice through this kernel function. The kernel was convolved with the
particle locations at 00:19 to generate the heat map shown in Fig.10.10. The black
region overlaid on the heat-map shows an indicative bounding box on the geographic

Earlier Initialisation
Asafurtherlevelofvalidationonrobustness,aseparaterunoftheﬁlterwasperformed
initialising using the ﬁnal ACARS report. This run is not useful for deﬁning a search
region because it ignores important data from the primary and secondary radar.
However,theresultdoesillustratetheabilityofthemethodtoaddressﬂightpathswith
several large turns. Figure10.11 shows the pdf derived from the 17:01 initialisation.
The pdf is overlaid with the one that is presented earlier in this chapter that uses all
of the available information. Two versions of the 17:01 initialisation are presented.
The ﬁrst, which ignores the primary radar data, is shown in red in the upper diagram.
The second, shown in the lower diagram, re-weights the paths by treating the 18:02
radar point as a measurement with 1◦standard deviation in latitude and longitude.
This weighting is rather loose but the samples are limited and none of them are
sufﬁciently close to the radar point to permit a tighter match. The ﬁlter has given a
similar output even though the initialisation point was heading North and there are
two very signiﬁcant manoeuvres reported by the radar in the ﬁrst hour. This provides
further conﬁdence in the ability of the ﬁlter to characterise aircraft motion even in
complicated situations. The sequence of turns performed by MH370 between 17:01
and 18:02 is much more dynamic than any experienced in the validation ﬂights.
When the radar data was ignored the ﬁlter found a cluster of paths that travel a
signiﬁcant distance to the North before turning prior to 18:39. These paths conclude
at the Northern edge of the search region because they travel too far to the North early
on, in a manner which is inconsistent with the primary radar data. In contrast, the

expect that, given further computation, samples would be found between these two

Cost Index
Another autopilot mode for control of air speed is Cost Index, as discussed in
Sect.6.2.1. To recap, under this mode the autopilot dynamically selects a speed in
order to optimise a criterion which trades fuel consumption and travel time accord-
ing to the Cost Index value entered by the pilot [34]. An additional experiment was
performed in which the aircraft was permitted to enter into the Cost Index mode
at a random time, remaining in that mode from that time forward. The Cost Index
value was randomly sampled between 0 and 100, and lookup tables provided by
Boeing were used to determine a speed based on the sampled value of altitude, and
an estimate of the aircraft weight, which varies over time as fuel is expended.
The result of this experiment is shown in Fig.10.12. The white curve shows the
pdf calculated through the model using Mach number, as shown in Fig.10.2, while
the red curve shows the pdf calculated using the Cost Index model. The ﬁgure shows
that the use of Cost Index does not signiﬁcantly change the result; the distribution is
slightly more compact than in the case of the constant Mach number model. Since
either mode is possible, the broader result in Fig.10.2 is preferred for determining
the search region.

Other Variations
Theresultspresentedinthischapterareasummaryoftheanalysiswehaveundertaken
on the accident ﬂight data. They are far from an exhaustive set of the variations that
have been examined. Many other changes to the ﬁlter parameters and measurement
model were explored but none made a signiﬁcant impact on the search region. Exam-
ple changes to the ﬁlter include: modifying the Jeffreys prior; using ﬁxed average
manoeuvre times; changing the incremental time step; resampling the Jefferys prior
to emulate a change in aircraft behaviour; moving the initialisation point; modifying
the initialisation variances; forcing a prescribed angle after 18:39; and quantising
heading to integer degrees. Example changes to the measurement model include:
vetoing selected measurements; using only C-channel BFO measurements; increas-
ing and decreasing the BFO assumed noise variance; replacing the BFO with a
“true” BFO using known location for the validation ﬂights; including or excluding
particular BTO measurements and R600 messages; and cross validation where each
measurement is removed in turn to investigate output robustness.
In our earliest attempts at producing a pdf a much simpler aircraft model was
used. For example, under the assumption of a single turn, the parameter vector is
relatively short and more conventional estimation methods can be used. However,
such a model cannot be applied to any of the validation ﬂights and runs the risk of
constraining the estimated path with additional assumptions. The fact that the very
general model here chooses to make few turns provides information that would not
be available from a single turn geometric model.
The factors that do make a signiﬁcant difference to the output pdf are the assumed
spread of Mach number and the end of ﬂight model. The assumed Mach number
range covers the speeds feasible to achieve the required ﬂight endurance time. The
lower end of this speed range results in the Northern part of the pdf and the higher
end of the speed range results in the Southern part. Restricting the speed to only
Mach numbers above 0.8, for example, would contract the pdf to the South. The
consequence is that using a smaller speed range within the bounds already modelled
leads to a subset of the search zone. If a different end of ﬂight model is assumed
the general consequence is to spread the search zone over a larger area. Simulations
have predicted that the maximum distance that the aircraft could have glided under
human control is approximately 100nm after 00:19 [5]. The search zone that this
scenario would imply is very much larger.

Chapter 11
Ongoing Reﬁnement
The previous chapters of this book have built up models for the limited available
measurement data and for aircraft motion, and then used these models to produce
a pdf of the ﬁnal aircraft latitude and longitude. In principle, one could use this
pdf to direct a search and then the very act of searching would provide further
measurement data. This chapter describes how the Bayesian method can be used to
adapt the position pdf to account for data collected after the accident ﬂight. Two
data sources are discussed: the sonar imagery data collected in the search and the
discovery of the ﬂaperon on Reunion Island.
11.1
Updating the Distribution Using Search Results
The measurements collected as part of the search can be treated in the same mathe-
matical framework as the communications data. This was used, for example, in the
search for AF447 [40]. In this case the aircraft is no longer moving so the prediction
stage becomes degenerate and the predicted pdf is the same as the previous posterior
pdf. The result of the search can be summarised by the probability that the cumulative
search effort would have detected the aircraft at any particular location, PD(x). The
posterior pdf given the search effort (denoted S) then becomes:
p(xﬁnal|S, ZK) ∝[1 −PD(xﬁnal)]p (xﬁnal|ZK) ,
(11.1)
where the constant of proportionality is determined to ensure that the posterior inte-
grates to unity. If a particular area A is searched with a constant probability of
detection PD, the probability of ﬁnding the aircraft is
P(ﬁnd during search of A) = PD

Ongoing Reﬁnement
In the analysis used for prioritising the search for ﬂight AF447, the probability of
detection for areas searched using side-scan sonar was modelled as 0.9 [40]. This
type of analysis could be used, for example, to prioritise whether to revisit a more
likely area or to search a less likely area that has not yet been searched.
BasedonthequalityassuranceprocesswhichhasbeenimplementedintheMH370
search, which includes revisiting items that have been assessed as potential debris,
it is considered highly unlikely that the search would fail to detect the aircraft if
the correct location is searched. Due to sensor drop-out and terrain masking, there
will inevitably be small pockets which are not covered in a ﬁrst pass of the search,
and (11.1) can be used to determine the priority of returning to ensure that these are
examined.
11.2
Reunion Island Debris
The apparent lack of debris from the aircraft was a mystery which was resolved in
part when a ﬂaperon was discovered washed up on Reunion Island on 29 July 2015,
508 days after the accident, and later conﬁrmed to be from MH370. Two questions
arise from this ﬁnd:
1. What information does the discovery of the ﬂaperon on Reunion Island provide
about the ﬁnal location of the aircraft?
2. What information does the lack of any other debris to date provide about the ﬁnal
location of the aircraft?
Debris information was used to inform the search for AF447 [40], and was pro-
posed for MH370 in the white paper [19]. The most directly relevant source of
information on the likely drift of the ﬂaperon is from the Global Drifter Program
[32]. The program provides 30 years of data on buoys referred to as drifters, which
are regularly deployed in oceans worldwide. The primary goal of the program is to
measure ocean currents rather than surface effects. To ensure that the drifter motion
is dominated by the ocean current, the drifters are deployed with drogues, which are
sea anchors that sit around ﬁfteen metres beneath the ocean surface. If the drogue
is detached then there is an observable change in the motion of the drifter [28]. A
drifter without a drogue is referred to as an undrogued drifter and is more buoyant
than the drifters with an attached drogue. The buoyancy of the ﬂaperon has not been
characterised at this time but it is expected that the undrogued drifters better describe
its likely motion because the drogues by design cause drifters to move according to
deeper currents.
In this section, we derive an updated pdf of the ﬁnal location of the aircraft based
on an analysis of data from the Global Drifter Program. It should be noted that the
characteristics of the drifters are not accurately matched to the ﬂaperon, thus there
is some uncertainty in the applicability of the results, but it is believed to be the
most relevant data source available. The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. David
Grifﬁn (CSIRO, Australia) for providing specialist analysis and advice in support of

this effort, as well as the results illustrated in Fig.11.1. Further information may be
found at [17].
The ﬁrst question is answered by modifying the pdf provided in the previous
chapter. This is achieved by developing a likelihood function of the source location
of the ﬂaperon using the drifter data. The likelihood is used to calculate the posterior
pdf of the ﬁnal aircraft location given both the information provided by the Inmarsat
satellite data and the discovery of the debris.
The second question relates to the potential information provided by the lack of
other debris. We consider a statistical framework for quantifying this information
but the framework requires parameters that cannot be reliably determined. For this
reason we limit ourselves to qualitative conclusions about the lack of other debris.
11.2.1
Update of Final Location Distribution
We start with the form which results from the particle ﬁlter: (sampling to incorporate
the effect of the descent kernel of Sect.10.5)
p (xﬁnal|ZK) ≈
P

p=1
wpδ

xﬁnal −xp
,
(11.3)
For a single item of debris, we seek a model which permits us to update (11.3) using
the knowledge that the item arrived at a given location and time. For this, we require
a transition distribution for how the debris would move over 508 days. Denoting the
location after 508 days as y, this transition distribution is p(y|xﬁnal). Thus, assuming
a single item of debris, the kinematic distribution updated by the knowledge of the
debris ﬁnd at location y = y is:
p(xﬁnal|ZK, y = y) ∝p(y = y|xﬁnal)p(xﬁnal|ZK)
≈
P

p=1
wp p

y = y|xp

,
(11.4)
Equation (11.4) can be interpreted as re-weighting each particle xp by the likelihood
that an item of debris at that location would end up at location y = y.
A ﬁeld of debris can be modelled as a Poisson point process (e.g., [42]). Suppose
that the expected number of debris items is λ, that an item that is washed up on the
shore is identiﬁed with probability PI, and that no items are found while they remain
in the ocean. Then the likelihood of the ﬁrst item of debris being found at y = y
given that the end-of-ﬂight location was xﬁnal is:
l(debris|xﬁnal) = exp

−PIλ

p(y|xﬁnal)dy

where the integral is over the coastal region C, i.e., the region where debris would be
likely to have been found. This expression could be used to update the model as:
p(xﬁnal|ZK, debris) ∝l(debris|xﬁnal)p(xﬁnal|ZK)
≈
P

p=1

(11.6)
Similar to the case of a single debris item, this model re-weights each particle xp with
the likelihood that a debris ﬁeld starting from that location would not yield any identi-
ﬁed coastal debris within the time other than a single item at y = y. The model could
be easily reﬁned to incorporate thinning, i.e., the likelihood that over time, items of
debris might sink, as well as the temporal aspect that the debris did not arrive until
some 508 days later, by splitting the transition distribution p(y|x) into a number of
intermediate, smaller duration transition steps. However, the required model para-
meters, are very difﬁcult to quantify with any degree of conﬁdence. Speciﬁcally, the
expected number of debris items, and the probability that an item washed up would
be identiﬁed, are assumed to be known. Since these parameters cannot be adequately
speciﬁed, we rely on a qualitative approach for incorporating information provided
by the lack of debris, and use the quantitative approach of (11.4) for incorporating
the information on the debris item that was found.
11.2.2
Data from Global Drifter Program
The data available for undrogued drifters are summarised in Fig.11.1. Each diagram
shows drifter trajectories which pass through a region of interest in months between
February and April (i.e., the time of year of the accident). The middle ﬁgure centres
the region of interest on the search zone, while the top ﬁgure examines the region
to the North, and the bottom ﬁgure shows the region to the South. Coloured dots
are drawn along each drifter trajectory every 100 days to illustrate time along the
trajectory. Trajectory segments coloured in blue indicate water colder than 18 ◦C,
the temperature above which barnacle nauplii settlement and growth is accelerated;
evidence of accelerated growth was present on the ﬂaperon [17].
The following observations can be made from the ﬁgures:
1. In the top diagram (the region to the North of the search zone), many trajectories
head West at quite a fast rate, reaching Madagascar and Tanzania in 300 days or
less. The absence of debris being identiﬁed in the Western Indian Ocean many
months earlier than July 2015 would tend to indicate this region as being less
likely.
2. A signiﬁcant proportion of the trajectories in the middle diagram (the search zone)
arrive in the general vicinity of Reunion Island at around 500 days.

to 96 ◦E. Bottom diagram shows trajectories which pass through the box from 39 ◦S to 45 ◦S and
longitudes from 77 ◦E to 87 ◦E. Coloured dots show time, marking every 100 days. Blue trajectories
are in water colder than 18 ◦C, the temperature above which barnacle nauplii settlement and growth
is accelerated. Figure courtesy of Dr. David Grifﬁn, CSIRO; see also [17]

3. The majority of trajectories in the bottom diagram (the region to the South of the
search zone) head to the East, towards Australia and New Zealand. Very few head
toward the vicinity of Reunion Island.
Thus the discovery of the single ﬂaperon on Reunion Island after 508 days would
seem to be more consistent with the existing search region, and less consistent with
regions signiﬁcantly to the North or South.
11.2.3
Posterior Distribution Using Debris Data
Figure11.1 represents the total undrogued drifter data available passing through each
box at the relevant time of the year over the 30 year history of the Global Drifter
Program. It is insufﬁcient to construct a transition distribution, hence additional
processing was performed to enhance the data set. Speciﬁcally, pairs of trajectories
that passed close together (possibly in different years) were “joined,” i.e., used to
create additional synthetic trajectories comprised of the head of one with the tail of
the other. A synthetic data set was generated by joining four trajectory segments. In
each joining process, each previous trajectory creates around 30 new trajectories.
The joined trajectories provide a sampled representation of the distribution:
pdrifter(x, y) ≈1
P
P

p=1
δ(x −xp)δ(y −yp)
(11.7)
where x is the location of the drifter on 8 March 2014, and y is the location on
29 July 2015. As in (11.4), the distribution of interest is p(y|xﬁnal) evaluated for y
at Reunion Island, or, pragmatically, integrating over a small region R surrounding
Reunion Island:
l(xﬁnal) =

R
p(y|xﬁnal)dy
(11.8)
The conditional distribution p(y|x) requires normalisation by the prior distribution
pdrifter(x); this represents the overall mean density of drifters in the ocean, which is
neither spatially uniform nor time invariant. Applying a small kernel K(x) around
each sample, the likelihood is evaluated as:
l(xﬁnal) =

region R in the right time window, including those synthetically augmented using
the aforementioned joining process. {x1, . . . , ˜x ˜P} is the overall set of drifter locations
for the time interval from February to April. The ε terms are added for regularisation,

Reunion Island is almost completely explained by the variation in the overall starting
distribution, therefore the likelihood shows much less spatial variation. The lower

Figure11.3 shows the posterior distribution based on the Inmarsat data from
Fig.10.10, alongside the updated distribution, which incorporates the information
from the debris item located at Reunion Island. The updated distribution is shifted
very slightly to the North, but the effect is negligible. This result is not unexpected
given the long duration between the accident and the debris discovery.

Chapter 12
Conclusions
In this book we have described our Bayesian approach to deﬁning the MH370 search
zone. The three ingredients required for the Bayesian approach are
• a prior (deﬁned by the Malaysian military radar)
• a likelihood function describing the relationship between BTO and BFO measure-
ments and the aircraft state vector and
• a model of the aircraft dynamics.
All three are described in detail. To increase conﬁdence in the models and process
developed, validation has been performed using previous ﬂights of the accident air-
craft, and data from other ﬂights in the air at the same time as the accident ﬂight.
In all cases the true location aligns with that predicted by the Bayesian analysis.
All validation trajectories have signiﬁcant numbers of speed, heading and altitude
changes, which are successfully captured by the model. This is in stark contrast with
the accident ﬂight which results in a prediction of no signiﬁcant manoeuvre after
the Southerly turn near the Northern tip of Sumatra before continuing in a Southerly
direction until it ran out of fuel in the Southern Indian Ocean, West of Australia.
The search zone is dependent on the surface area covered by expected descent
scenarios from the time of the ﬁnal satellite log-on attempt at 00:19. This has been
deﬁned by expert accident investigators at the ATSB. If the actual descent scenario
was inconsistent with the distribution of possibilities considered then the search zone
may need to increase in area.
