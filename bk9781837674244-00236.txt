p Orbital
A p orbital is an atomic orbital with l ¼ 1. There are three p orbitals in
each subshell (ml ¼ 1, 0, þ1). Real linear combinations are denoted
px, py, pz according to their orientation with respect to the three
Cartesian axes, each one having one angular nodal plane per-
pendicular to its axis and passing through the nucleus (Figure P.1).
A p orbital has zero amplitude at r ¼ 0, and in a shell with quantum
number n has n – 2 radial nodes at r40.

p Orbital and p Bond
In molecular orbital theory, a p orbital is a molecular orbital with a
nodal plane lying along the internuclear distance (Figure P.2). When
occupied by one or two electrons it represents a p bond. In valence bond
theory a p bond consists of two paired electrons in overlapping
p orbitals, also with a nodal plane that contains the internuclear dis-
tance. In a linear molecule, degenerate p orbitals occur in pairs, with
angular momentum of magnitude h in opposite directions around the
internuclear axis. When occupied, the electron density of the pair of
orbitals has cylindrical symmetry. In nonlinear molecules, a p bond
supplies torsional rigidity to a double bond because rotation around the
bond decreases the overlap of the p orbitals and thereby weakens the
bond they form.
Paired Spins
Two electron spins are said to be paired if the total spin angular
momentum is zero. Paired spins are denoted mk. Specifically, the spin
wavefunction for two paired spins is (1/2)1/2{a(1)b(2)  b(1)a(2)} and is
antisymmetric under particle exchange. This combination corres-
ponds to S ¼ 0, MS ¼ 0 (see vector model). According to the Pauli ex-
clusion principle, two electrons must have paired spins if they occupy
the same orbital.
Parabolic Potential Energy
A parabolic potential energy is one that varies with distance as x2, where x
is the displacement from equilibrium. See harmonic oscillator.

Parallel Band
A parallel band in infrared spectroscopy is a series of lines that arise
from a vibrational transition in which the dipole moment of the
molecule changes parallel to the axis of symmetry, as in the anti-
symmetric stretch of CO2.
Paramagnetism
A paramagnetic material is one with a positive magnetic susceptibility
(see magnetic susceptibility); it tends to move into a magnetic field.
The magnetic flux density is greater inside a paramagnetic sample
than in a vacuum. Paramagnetism is normally due to the presence of
unpaired electron spins. In some instances it can arise from the
presence of low-lying excited orbital states and is due to orbital
magnetism. In the latter case it is known as temperature-independent
paramagnetism (TIP).
Parity
Parity is the behaviour of an entity under the operation of inversion.
See centre of inversion and g and u.
Partial Miscibility
Two liquids are classified as partially miscible if the temperature–
composition phase diagram possesses a region in which the system
forms two liquid phases (Figure P.3). The relative composition of the
phases in equilibrium is given by the lever rule.

Partial Molar Property
A partial molar property, XJ or XJ, is defined as
XJ ¼
@X
@nJ

T;p;n0
The constraint n0 implies that the abundances of all components of
the mixture other than J are held constant. The partial molar volumes
of water and ethanol are depicted in Figure P.4. The partial molar
Gibbs energy, GJ, is called the chemical potential and is denoted mJ.
Partial molar properties are found by fitting a polynomial to the
observed variation of a property X with composition and then dif-
ferentiating this function. A partial molar property can be inter-
preted as the contribution per mole of substance made by the
specified component to the total value of the property. The total
value of a property is the weighted sum of the related partial molar
properties of all the components:
X ¼

X ¼ n  X
Variations in partial molar properties obey the Gibbs–Duhem equation:

This relation implies that in a binary mixture when one partial molar
quantity increases the other must decrease.
Partial Pressure
The partial pressure of a gas (real or perfect), pJ, is defined as
pJ ¼ xJp
where xJ is the mole fraction of J in the mixture and p is the total
pressure (Figure P.5). If all the gases in the mixture are perfect, then
the partial pressure is the pressure that each gas would exert if it
occupied the container alone. According to Dalton’s law, the total
pressure of a gaseous mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of
the components of the mixture. This law is exact for the formal def-
inition of partial pressure given above but is a limiting law if partial
pressures are interpreted as contributing pressures.
Particle in a Box
The particle in a box (PIB) model consists of a particle of mass m in in
a one-dimensional region of space of length L in which the potential
energy is zero within the box and is infinite elsewhere. It is an
elementary problem in quantum mechanics often used to display how
the boundary conditions that a wavefunction must satisfy lead to the
quantization of energy. Thus, the boundary conditions c(0) ¼ 0 and

q ¼

temperature of interest; typically q ¼ 1 at T ¼ 0, when only the non-
degenerate ground state is accessible, and q rises towards the total
number of states in the molecule (which is typically infinite) as T rises
to infinity (Figure P.8).

Patterson Synthesis
A Patterson synthesis is a technique of data analysis in X-ray crystal-
lography in which the function P(r) is formed by calculating the
Fourier transform of the squares of the structure factors (which are
proportional to the diﬀraction intensities):
P(r) ¼ 1
V
X

jFhklj2e2pikr;
k  r ¼ hx þ ky þ lz
The outcome is a map of the separations of the atoms in the unit cell
of the crystal, as shown in Figure P.9. If some atoms are heavy, per-
haps because they have been introduced by isomorphous replacement,
they dominate P(r) and their locations can be deduced quite simply
and used in the determination of the location of lighter atoms.
Pauli Exclusion Principle
The Pauli exclusion principle states that no more than two electrons
can occupy a single orbital, and if two electrons do occupy it, then
their spins must be paired. The principle is a consequence of the
more general Pauli principle and is at the heart of the building-up
principle for the explanation of the electron configurations of atoms
(and molecules) and therefore of the periodic table.
Pauli Principle
The Pauli principle states that the overall wavefunction of a system
must change sign when the labels of any two identical fermions are

interchanged but must remain unchanged when any two identical
bosons are interchanged. Formally:
c(B; A) ¼  c(A; B)
where the negative sign applies if A and B are identical fermions and
the positive sign applies if they are identical bosons. There are nu-
merous important consequences of this principle. It implies, for in-
stance, the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions and for electrons in
particular. It also implies that there is no restriction on the number of
bosons that may in a given state, so allowing for the formation of rays
of intense (multiphoton) monochromatic light. Other consequences
include nuclear statistics. The repulsive interaction between closed-
shell molecules, and therefore the existence of bulk matter, is es-
sentially a consequence of the principle.
Penetration
Penetration is the ability of an outer electron to be found inside the
inner shells of atoms and hence to experience the full Coulombic
attraction of the nucleus. The most penetrating electrons are those in
s orbitals, which have nonzero probability density at the nucleus.
They penetrate more than other electrons of the same shell, which
due to their orbital angular momentum have amplitudes that vary as
rl close to the nucleus (Figure P.10); consequently they experience a
less shielded nuclear charge and therefore lie lower in energy than the
p and d electrons of the same shell. This lowering of the energy is
used in the building-up principle to account for the structure of the
periodic table.

Hydrogenic radial distribution functions close to the nucleus.

Perfect Gas
A perfect gas (or ideal gas) is a fluid that is described by the equation of
state
pV ¼ nRT
where p is the pressure, V the volume, T the temperature, n the
amount of substance, and R is the gas constant (R ¼ NAk). The iso-
therms are hyperbolas (Figure P.11).
The perfect gas equation is a limiting law in the sense that the
equations of state of all real gases approach it as p - 0. Perfect gas
behaviour stems from the absence of intermolecular forces, with the

collision frequency. Those parameters can be adapted to account for
the transport properties of the gas.
Permeability

density, B, to the strength, H , of an applied magnetic field:
m ¼ B

It is related to the magnetic susceptibility, w, by

pH
The formal definition of the pH of a solution is
pH ¼  log a(Hþ)
where a(H1) is the activity of hydrogen ions in the solution. The pH of
pure water is 7.0 at 25 8C, and this value corresponds to a neutral
solution at this temperature. A pH47 signifies a basic solution and a
pHo7 signifies an acidic solution. More generally, because

the most stable. The coexistence curves (or phase boundaries),
the lines separating the regions, show the conditions under
which the two phases separated by the line are in equilibrium. The
locations of the coexistence curves can be discussed in terms of the
Clapeyron equation and the related Clausius–Clapeyron equation.
A triple point is a point in a phase diagram showing the conditions
under which three phases are mutually in equilibrium. Three
examples of phase diagrams and their interpretation are shown in

it is necessary to know the sign of the structure factors Fhkl. However,
because the diﬀraction intensities are proportional to the square
modulus of the structure factors, |Fhkl|2, the intensities do not provide
information on the sign. For noncentrosymmetric crystals the struc-
ture factors may be complex and of the form |Fhkl|eia, with the phase a
indeterminate from the intensity data. The phase problem can be
evaded by the use of a Patterson synthesis or tackled directly by using
so-called direct methods of phase allocation.

Phase Rule
The (Gibbs) phase rule states that the number of phases, P, the
number of components, C, and the variance, F, of a system in equi-
librium are related by
F ¼ C  P þ 2
A phase is a form of matter that is uniform throughout in both
chemical composition and physical state. A component is a chemically
independent constituent of a system; a constituent is any species
present. The number of components is the number of constituents
that are necessary to define the composition of all the phases present
in the system, taking into account any necessary relations between
their concentrations (such as charge neutrality). The variance is the
number of intensive variables that can be changed independently
without disturbing the number of phases in equilibrium. A single
component system (C ¼ 1) for which F ¼ 0 and therefore P ¼ 3 with
three phases in mutual equilibrium is said to be invariant and is
represented on the phase diagram by a point, the triple point.
Phosphorescence
Empirically, phosphorescence is the emission of visible light when the
substance is illuminated with higher energy electromagnetic radi-
ation and which persists for at least short times after the source of
illumination is removed. Mechanistically, it is the emission of visible
light after excitation and steps that include intersystem crossing,
commonly from a singlet to a triplet state.
In more detail, the mechanism of phosphorescence is as follows
(Figure P.16). First, a molecule is excited electronically into a

vibrationally excited state of an upper electronic state. Then, as
radiationless decay of the vibrational excitation occurs, the excited
electronic state undergoes intersystem crossing under the influence
of spin–orbit coupling and turns into an excited state with a diﬀerent
multiplicity, commonly a triplet (S ¼ 1). Radiationless decay of the
vibrational excitation now continues in the new electronic state until
the molecule reaches the vibrational ground state of that state. There
is then a delay as the state undergoes a spin-forbidden emission
transition to the ground singlet state.
Intersystem crossing depends on the presence of spin–orbit coup-
ling, so the phosphorescence may be enhanced by the presence of
atoms of a heavy element (such as sulfur). Phosphorescent radiation
has a lower frequency than the incident radiation because vibrational
energy has been discarded and because the intersystem crossing
generally takes place to a lower lying electronic state than the initially
excited state.
Photoelectric Eﬀect
The photoelectric eﬀect is the ejection of electrons from a solid, usually
a metal, when it is illuminated with high energy electromagnetic ra-
diation, typically in the ultraviolet region. The following character-
istics are observed:
1. No electrons are ejected, regardless of the intensity of the radi-
ation, unless the frequency exceeds a threshold value charac-
teristic of the solid.
2. The kinetic energy of the ejected electrons varies linearly with
the frequency of the incident radiation but is independent of its
intensity.
3. Even at low light intensities electrons are rejected immediately if
the frequency is above threshold.
The eﬀect is explained in terms of the collision of a photon of
frequency n and energy hn with an electron that can be removed from
the solid only if it is supplied with at least an energy F, for the con-
servation of energy demands that the kinetic energy, Ek, of the ejected
electron will be
Ek ¼ hn  F
The quantity F is called the photoelectric work function of the solid.

Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Photoelectron spectroscopy (or photoemission spectroscopy, PES and PS)
is the observation of the kinetic energies of electrons ejected by the
absorption of high frequency monochromatic electromagnetic radi-
ation. The technique is designated UV-PES if the incident radiation is
in the ultraviolet region and XPS or ESCA (electron spectroscopy for
chemical analysis) if X-rays are used. The basis of the technique is the
conservation of energy and the fact that a photon of frequency n has
energy hn and the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is
Ek;i ¼ hn  Ii
where Ii is the ionization energy of the target in which the electron oc-
cupied the orbital i. According to Koopmans’ theorem, that ionization
energy is equal to the one-electron energy of the occupied orbital, Ii¼ ei.
The ultraviolet technique yields information about the valence
shells of molecules. The X-ray technique allows inner electrons to be
studied. These electrons are largely but not entirely independent of
the state of bonding of the atom, so the kinetic energy of the photo-
ejected electron can be used to identify the element present in the
sample (hence the name ESCA). The ultraviolet technique is enriched
by the observation of vibrational structure in the spectrum because
some of the energy of the incident photon is left in an excited state of
vibration of the cation formed by ionization.
Photon
A photon is a quantum of electromagnetic radiation. More generally, a
photon is a boson responsible for conveying the electromagnetic force
between electrically charged particles. A photon of radiation of fre-
quency n has an energy hn; it is massless and is a spin-1 boson. The
component of spin angular momentum around its direction of travel
is designated by its helicity, s, which may be 1, corresponding to left
and right circularly polarized radiation, respectively. In a vacuum,
photons travel at the speed of light, c, which has the exact, defined
value c ¼ 299 792 458 m s1.

Planck’s Constant
Planck’s constant, h, is the fundamental constant introduced at the in-
ception of quantum theory and occurs whenever quantum phenomena
are important. Its exact, defined value is h ¼ 6.626 070 15 1034 J s.
A closely related quantity, which is particularly useful for the discussion
of the of angular momenta and circular motion in general, is the reduced
Planck’s constant, h ¼ h/2p. Its value is h E 1.054 571 817 1034 J s.

Polar Molecule
A polar molecule is a molecule with a permanent electric dipole mo-
ment. For a molecule to be polar it must belong to one of the groups
Cn; in which case the dipole moment lies parallel to the symmetry
axis.
Polarizability
The polarizability, a, of a molecule is the constant of proportionality
between the strength of the applied field, E, and the magnitude of the
resulting induced electric dipole moment, m:
m ¼ aE
For a general orientation of a nonspherical molecule the induced
moment is not necessarily parallel to the direction of the applied
field, in which case this expression becomes
mq ¼
X
q0
aqq0Eq0;
l ¼ a  E
Polarizabilities are commonly reported as a polarizability volume, a0,
where
a0 ¼

4pe0
Polarizability volumes have the dimensions of volume and numerical
values comparable to the volume of the molecule. In general, a mol-
ecule has a high polarizability if it has many electrons, has low lying
excited states, and is large.
The polarizability of a molecule varies with frequency of the ap-
plied field (Figure P.18). At low frequencies and if the molecule is
polar, the polarizability includes a contribution from orientation
distortion, the alignment of the entire molecules in the applied field.
This contribution is lost when the frequency is greater than the
rotational frequency of the molecule. The next contribution to dis-
appear is the distortion polarization, the polarization that stems from
the distortion of the shape of the molecule. This contribution dis-
appears when the frequency exceeds the vibrational frequency of the
molecule. At optical frequencies, only the electronic polarization, the
polarization stemming from the shift in positions of electrons,
survives.

Polarization (of Electrode)
The polarization of an electrode is the change in its kinetic behaviour
due to modification of the composition of the electrolyte in its
vicinity. One source of polarization is the depletion of the electro-
active species as a result of a high current density. A higher over-
potential is then needed to produce a given current. This contribution
to the overpotential is called the polarization overpotential, Z0. If it is
supposed that there is a Nernst diﬀusion layer of thickness d at the
electrode, then the polarization overpotential when the current
density is j is
Z0 ¼ RT

where z is the charge number of the ions in solution at a molar
concentration c and D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The limiting current
density, jmax, the maximum current density for a given molar con-
centration and thickness of layer, is
jlim ¼ jzjFDc

Polarization Mechanism
The polarization mechanism is a means of coupling the magnetic
moments of nuclei and electrons through the bonds that link them. It
is responsible for aspects of the hyperfine structure of EPR spectra
and the fine structure of NMR spectra.
The mechanism of the interaction between the two protons in an
H–C–H group is as follows (Figure P.19). Suppose the spin of one

proton is a. There is a slight advantage, due to the Fermi contact
interaction, for the electron in the bond to it to be a too. Therefore,
the other electron in the bond must be b, and will be close to the
C atom. Hund’s rule favours parallel spins in orthogonal orbitals
on atoms, so there will be a slight advantage in the electron close to
the C atom in the second bond to be b too. Therefore, the second
electron of the second bond will be a and close to the second proton.
That proton interacts with it by another Fermi contact interaction, and
has a lower energy if it too is a and a higher energy if it is b. Thus, there
is a coupling between the two protons. A similar line of reasoning ap-
plies to the hyperfine coupling of a p electron in a C–H fragment as
expressed by the McConnell equation.
Polarized Light
Light is plane polarized if its electric field oscillates in a single plane
(and its magnetic component oscillates in a perpendicular plane). It is
circularly polarized when the electric vector rotates around the dir-
ection of propagation (Figure P.20). Left-circularly polarized light ro-
tates in a counterclockwise direction as perceived by a viewer facing

the oncoming ray (and consists of photons of helicity s ¼ þ1). Right-
circularly polarized light rotates in a clockwise direction from the
same viewpoint (and consists of photons of helicity s ¼ 1). Plane
polarized light can be regarded as a superposition of two counter-
rotating circularly polarized rays with the same amplitude. Elliptically
polarized light is obtained when the superimposed circular com-
ponents have diﬀerent amplitudes.
Polymerization Kinetics
There are two principal modes of polymerization. In chain polymer-
ization an activated monomer M attacks another monomer, links to it,
and then that unit attacks another monomer, and so on. High polymers
are formed rapidly and only the yield and not the molar mass of the
polymer is increased by allowing long reaction times. The rate of re-
action is proportional to the square root of the initiator concentration:
v ¼ kr[I]1=2[M]
In stepwise polymerization any two monomers present in the reaction
mixture can link together at any time and growth is not confined to
the chains that have already started. The molar mass of the product
grows with time:
n
h i ¼ 1 þ krt[A]0=c-
where [A]0 is the initial molar concentration of monomers and hni is
the average number of monomer units in a chain.
Positronium
Positronium, Ps, is a hydrogenic species consisting of an electron, e,
and its antiparticle, a positron, e1. The ground state is para-positronium
(p-Ps), with paired spins (S¼ 0, MS ¼ 0); its lifetime is 0.12 ns and decays
with the emission of two g-ray photons. ortho-Positronium (o-Ps), with
S¼ 1, MS ¼ 0, 1, lies 1 meV above the singlet, lives for 142 ns, and
decays into three g-ray photons.

lection of atoms as their relative coordinates are allowed to range over

all positions. It is common for visual portrayals to exhibit slices
through the full surface; the slices correspond to a variety of con-
straints applied to the atoms. Thus, in the discussion of a triatomic
system the three atoms may be constrained to be collinear
(Figure P.21). The trajectory of least potential energy through a
surface is identified with the reaction coordinate and the energy
requirements and optimum mode of motion, including the value of
the activation energy, are assessed on the basis of trajectories over
the surface. For a correct mechanistic portrayal of the behaviour of
a point on the surface, the axes are slanted (at 608 for a homo-
nuclear triatomic system), for otherwise the eﬀective mass of the
system would depend on the direction in which it was travelling.
For the classification of surfaces as attractive and repulsive, see
that entry.
Powder Method
The powder method of X-ray diﬀraction makes use of a mono-
chromatic beam of X-rays and a powder sample. The technique is
used to recognize the composition of samples from their character-
istic diﬀraction patterns and to determine the symmetry and di-
mensions of the unit cell.
Power
Power, P, is the rate at which energy is supplied. It is measured in
watts, W, with 1 W ¼ 1 J s1.

Precession
Precession is the migration of the axis of rotation of a body on a cone
around a fixed axis (Figure P.22). Classically, a magnetic dipole pre-
cesses around the direction of an applied magnetic field. In quantum
mechanics the concept of precession is preserved in the vector model
of angular momentum. In this model, an angular momentum is rep-
resented by a vector with a length proportional to the magnitude of the
momentum, { j( jþ 1)}1/2, and a component on the z-axis proportional to
the quantum number mj. In the absence of a magnetic field the vector
lies stationary at an unspecified angle on a cone. In the presence of a
magnetic field, it is supposed to process on this cone at its Larmor
frequency. The stronger the field, the faster is the procession.
Predissociation
In the phenomenon of predissociation it is found that the sharp
vibrational structure of an electronic transition gives way to a broad
featureless structure before the sharp structure resumes and the
continuum characteristic of dissociation is reached. The explan-
ation is that the upper electronic molecular potential energy curve

is crossed by a dissociative state (Figure P.23). An internal con-
version occurs at the intersection, and the upper state takes on a
dissociative character at energies that correspond to the crossing.
That dissociative character shortens the lifetime of vibrational
states, and as a result of lifetime broadening transitions to these
states become blurred.
Pre-equilibrium
A pre-equilibrium in a reaction mechanism is an elementary reaction and
its reverse that are assumed to occur so rapidly that the reactants and the
products of that step (which is an intermediate in the overall scheme) are
in dynamic equilibrium. The concentration of the intermediate can be
expressed in terms of an equilibrium constant for the step, as in

Pressure
Pressure, p, is force, F, divided by the area, A, to which the force is
applied: p ¼ F/A. It is normally reported in pascals, Pa, where
1 Pa¼ 1 N m2. Other common units are 1 bar¼ 105 Pa and 1 atm¼
101.325 kPa exactly. The pressure of a gas is detected by the impact of its
molecules on the walls of the vessel or some interior surface. The pres-
sure at the base of a column of incompressible fluid is due to the weight
of the overlying fluid. The following equations express the pressure in a

Principal Axis
The principal axis is the axis of symmetry of highest order; the Cn axis
with the highest value of n.
Principal Quantum Number
The principal quantum number, n, is the quantum number that spe-
cifies the (bound state) energy of electron in a hydrogenic atom

where m is the reduced mass. It is the label of the shells of an atom,
with n also the number of subshells of the shell and n2 the total
number of orbitals in the shell. A wavefunction of the atom has n1
nodes, of which nl1 are radial nodes and the remaining l are
angular nodes.
Promotion
Promotion is a concept employed in valence bond theory to account
for the number of bonds that an atom can form. It is supposed that
the overall lowering of energy on bond formation involves an invest-
ment in energy in which one or more electrons are transferred from
filled valence-shell orbitals into empty valence-shell orbitals, so
making more unpaired electrons available for bond formation. Thus,
the ground state configuration of carbon, which being [He]2s22p1

resonance due to their spin-coupling to protons is eﬀectively elim-
inated by irradiating the latter at their resonance frequencies so that
they undergo a rapid spin reorientation. As a result, the coupling to
them is averaged to zero.
pVT Surface
A pVT surface is a graphical depiction of the equation of state in
which one variable is plotted against the other two. The only states
in which the substance can exist correspond to points on the surface.
The surfaces shown in Figures P.24 and P.25 are for a perfect gas
and a van der Waals gas (the labels on the latter are reduced
temperatures).
