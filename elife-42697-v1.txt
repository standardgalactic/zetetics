Abstract Bacterial swarming and biofilm formation are collective multicellular phenomena
through which diverse microbial species colonize and spread over water-permeable tissue. During
both modes of surface translocation, fluid uptake and transport play a key role in shaping the
overall morphology and spreading dynamics. Here we develop a generalized two-phase thin-film
model that couples bacterial growth, extracellular matrix swelling, fluid flow, and nutrient transport
to describe the expansion of both highly motile bacterial swarms, and sessile bacterial biofilms. We
show that swarm expansion corresponds to steady-state solutions in a nutrient-rich, capillarity
dominated regime. In contrast, biofilm colony growth is described by transient solutions associated
with a nutrient-limited, extracellular polymer stress driven limit. We apply our unified framework to
explain a range of recent experimental observations of steady and unsteady expansion of microbial
swarms and biofilms. Our results demonstrate how the physics of flow and transport in slender
geometries serve to constrain biological organization in microbial communities.

Introduction
Bacteria employ sophisticated surface translocation machinery to actively swarm, twitch, glide or
slide over solid surfaces (Kearns, 2010; Mattick, 2002; Spormann, 1999; Ho¨lscher and Kova´cs,
2017). Collectively, they also aggregate into multicellular communities on hydrated surfaces and
exhibit large-scale coordinated movement (Verstraeten et al., 2008). Surface motility in macro-
scopic colonies on hydrated surfaces such as gels occurs primarily via two distinct modes: either by
rapid flagella-mediated swarming expansion (Harshey, 1994; Harshey, 2003), or alternatively by
slow biofilm expansion driven by extracellular polymer matrix production (Hall-Stoodley et al.,
2004). In both cases, an interplay between mechanical constraints and biological organization sets
limits on the overall colony morphology and expansion dynamics (Persat et al., 2015). The forces
driving colony expansion are generated by non-homogeneous patterns of biological activity, origi-
nating from spatial localizations in cell growth and division (Hamouche et al., 2017), extracellular
polymer matrix production (Seminara et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2017; Srinivasan et al., 2018), osmo-
lyte secretion (Ping et al., 2014) and active stresses (Farrell et al., 2013; Delarue et al., 2016). Con-
versely, the formation of localized biologically active zones is tightly coupled to the heterogeneity of
the environment, including the diffusion and transport of nutrients (Wang et al., 2017), accumulation
of metabolic by-products (Liu et al., 2015; Gozzi et al., 2017) and presence of quorum sensing and
signaling agents that regulate cell-differentiation and development.
Consequently, the dynamics of colony growth requires a mechanistic description that accounts
for spatiotemporal inhomogeneities in biological activity, emergent forces, and flows that transport
metabolic agents. In bacterial swarming, cells within the colony are actively propelled by the rotation

of flagella in a thin layer of fluid extracted from the underlying soft tissue or gel (Kearns, 2010). In
contrast, bacterial biofilms are surface aggregates of sessile bacteria embedded in a self-generated
extracellular polymer matrix (Flemming and Wingender, 2010). Despite marked differences in regu-
latory genetic pathways, morphology and cell function (Verstraeten et al., 2008), physical character-
istics such as the fluidization of the substrate/tissue, gradients in nutrient availability, the low-aspect-
ratio geometry and the existence of multiple phases (i.e. cells, biopolymer and fluid) are common to
both bacterial film and swarm colonies. Motivated by these similarities, we present a unified multi-
phase framework that couples mechanics, hydrodynamics and transport to explain the dynamics of
bacterial swarm and film expansion.
Experimental background
Bacterial swarms
Experiments on swarming colonies of E. coli (Darnton et al., 2010; Wu and Berg, 2012; Ping et al.,
2014), S. enterica (Harshey and Matsuyama, 1994; Butler et al., 2010; Kalai Chelvam et al.,
2014; Chen et al., 2007) and P. aeruginosa (Yang et al., 2017) reveal certain reproducible features
associated with this modality of collective behavior. For example, E. coli swarms on agarose gels
have a steady front shape that propagates radially at a uniform speed (Wu and Berg, 2012). In these
swarms, measurements of the osmotic pressure profiles were found to be consistent with the active
secretion of wetting agents in regions of high cell density that serve to fluidize the swarm by extract-
ing water from the underlying tissue, thus allowing it to spread (Ping et al., 2014). These observa-
tions are not unique to E. coli; indeed our experiments with B. subtilis swarms, following
(Kearns and Losick, 2003), indicate the same phenomena, that is a steady-state front shape and
eLife digest Bacteria can grow and thrive in many different environments. Although we usually
think of bacteria as single-celled organisms, they are not always solitary; they can also form groups
containing large numbers of individuals. These aggregates work together as one super-colony,
allowing the bacteria to feed and protect themselves more efficiently than they could as isolated
cells.
These colonies move and grow in characteristic patterns as they respond to their environment.
They can form swarms, like insects, or biofilms, which are thin, flat structures containing both cells
and a film-like substance that the cells secrete. Availability of food and water influences the way
colonies spread; however, since movement and growth are accompanied by mechanical forces,
physical constraints are also important. These include the ability of the bacteria to change the water
balance and their local mechanical environment, and the forces they create as they grow and move.
Previous research has used a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches to explain the
dynamics of bacterial swarms and biofilms as separate phenomena. However, while they do differ
biologically, they also share many physical characteristics.
Srinivasan et al. wanted to exploit these similarities, and use them to predict the growth and
shape of biofilms and bacterial swarms under different conditions. To do this, a unified mathematical
model for the growth of both swarms and biofilms was created. The model accounted for various
factors, such as the transport of nutrients into the colony, the movement of water between the
colony and the surface on which it grew, and mechanical changes in the environment (e.g. swelling/
softening). The theoretical results were then compared with results from experimental
measurements of different bacterial aggregates grown on a soft, hydrated gel. For both swarms and
biofilms, the model correctly predicted how fast the colony expanded overall, as well as the shape
and location of actively growing regions.
Biofilms and other bacterial aggregates can cause diseases and increase inflammation in tissues,
and also hinder industrial processes by damage to submerged surfaces, such as ships and
waterpipes. The results described here may open up new approaches to restrict the spreading of
bacterial aggregates by focusing on their physical constraints.

speed, as shown in Figure 1A–1E. Close to the spreading front, we observe a multilayer region of
width W = 195 mm ± 35 mm, indicated by the dashed white lines in Figure 1B and 1C. The multilayer
region correlates with increased colony thickness and local bacterial density (Wu and Berg, 2012).
At the edge, and in the interior, there is just a monolayer of cells. The swarm radial expansion veloc-
ity is constant at V = 2 mm/hr (see Figure 1D) and the swarm front maintains a steady-state profile
during expansion (see Figure 1E). These observations raise a number of natural questions associated
with the steady-state velocity and profile of the swarm colony. Given the observations of osmotic
gradient-driven flow in the vicinity of the growing front (Ping et al., 2014), coupled with variations in
the thickness and activity of bacteria, any framework to explain these requires a consideration of a
dynamic bacterial population interacting with ambient fluid, necessitating a multiphase description.
Bacterial films
In contrast with bacterial swarms, the spreading of bacterial biofilms is faciliated by the extracellular
polymeric substance (EPS) matrix that expands via osmotic fluid influx, for example in B. subtilis

(Seminara et al., 2012) and V. cholerae (Yan et al., 2017) biofilm colonies. However, EPS synthesis
is not homogeneous, and depends on the local nutrient concentration and environmental heteroge-
neities experienced by cells within the same biofilm (Vlamakis et al., 2008; Berk et al., 2012).
Recently, it was shown that the EPS matrix production is localized to cells in the propagating front of
B. subtilis biofilms (Srinivasan et al., 2018). In Figure 1F–1J, we show the results of repeating these
experiments, but now focusing on a peripheral region of a biofilm colony using a B. subtilis strain
(MTC832) that harbors the PtapA   cfp construct as a reporter for matrix production activity
(Wang et al., 2016; Srinivasan et al., 2018). This highlights a ~ 1 mm zone of matrix production
activity at the periphery, seen in Figure 1G and H; indeed plots of averaged matrix production
reporter intensity exhibit a distinct peak at the periphery, as shown in Figure 1J. The dynamics of
radial expansion shows the existence of an initial acceleration regime followed by a transition to a
second regime characterized by a monotonic decrease in expansion velocity, as plotted in Figure 1I.
This transient mode of biofilm spreading driven by EPS production and swelling is quite different
from that of bacterial swarming, and suggests that we might need a fundamentally different way to
address its origins. However, if we now consider the EPS matrix and fluid as distinct phases
(Cogan and Keener, 2004; Cogan and Keener, 2005; Winstanley et al., 2011; Seminara et al.,
2012), with the bacterial population being relatively small, we are again led to a multiphase descrip-
tion of the system, but with a different dominant balance relative to that seen in bacterial swarms,
which we now turn to.
Theoretical framework
Recent theoretical approaches have considered specific physical factors such as the wettability of
the biofilm (Trinschek et al., 2016; Trinschek et al., 2017), osmotic pressure in the EPS matrix
(Winstanley et al., 2011; Seminara et al., 2012), or Marangoni stresses associated with the swarm
fluid (Fauvart et al., 2012), as reviewed by Allen and Waclaw (2019). However, a description that
captures the experimental observations described in Figure 1 remains lacking. Here, given the simi-
larities between the bacterial swarming and biofilm systems, we provide a unified description of their
spreading dynamics by recognizing that in both cases we need to consider large slender microbial
colonies with H=R  1, where H is the colony thickness and R is the radius. This approximation
results in a quasi-2-dimensional, two-phase model (assuming axisymmetry) of a colony that spreads
along the x-axis, with a varying thickness, as shown in Figure 2. The subscript i = (1,2) denotes the
actively growing phase and passive phase, respectively. Within the swarm colonies, the highly motile
cells constitute the actively growing phase whereas the fluid comprises the passive phase. Similarly,
in biofilms, the EPS matrix constitutes the active phase, and the aqueous fluid is the passive phase.
In both cases, colony growth occurs over a semipermeable soft gel substrate, as shown in Fig-
ure 2. We develop a continuous description of colony expansion in terms of variables which are
coarse-grained depth integrated averages (Drew, 1983; Ishii and Hibiki, 2011), The averaged
height of the colony interface is hðx; tÞ, the volume fraction of the active phase (i.e., swarmer cells or
polymer matrix) is f1 ¼ fðx; tÞ and the volume fraction of the fluid phase is f2 ¼ 1   fðx; tÞ. The 1-D
substrate depth-averaged nutrient concentration field within the substrate is cðx; tÞ. As detailed in
Appendix 2, combining mass and momentum balances yields the following generalized set of partial
differential equations that governs the dynamics of both expanding swarms and biofilms,

terms listed in Table 1 reveals a number of structural similarities and differences.
Nutrient uptake
For both swarms and biofilms, the active phase (i.e., swarm cells or the EPS matrix) is generated
within the bacterial colony by converting nutrient in the underlying substrate to biomass. The rate of
change of nutrient concentration within the substrate depends on diffusion and nutrient uptake (see
Equation (3) and Equation (A2)), and is derived in Appendix 2. When the substrate concentration is
scaled by the initial concentration c0, the nutrient depletion rate depends on G=c0, the ratio of the
specific nutrient consumption rate to the initial concentration. Bacterial swarming is typically associ-
ated with nutrient rich conditions, where c0  G. As a result, the nutrient uptake term can be
neglected in bacterial swarming as g2 ! 0, and the concentration c » c0 throughout swarm expansion.
In contrast, biofilm growth occurs under nutrient limited conditions where G=c0 ~ Oð1Þ, resulting in a
corresponding uptake term shown in Table 1. Therefore, biofilm expansion is necessarily unsteady
and driven by the dynamics of the transient nutrient field.
Growth
In both swarms and biofilms, the generation of the active phase drives colony expansion and is
described by the growth term in Equation (1) using a logistic function g1 ¼ g0hfð1   hf=ðHf0ÞÞ to
model the active phase growth, where Hf0 is the limiting thickness, and g0 indicates a specific
growth rate. In bacterial swarms, g0 is independent of the nutrient concentration (as c » c0 during
swarm expansion). Therefore, the spreading swarm films have a steady-state structure that exhibits a
central spatial plateau about hf ¼ Hf0. In contrast, biofilm growth corresponds to a nutrient poor
environment. We model the biofilm growth dependence on nutrient concentration via a minimal
Michaelis-Menten form g0 ¼ Gc=ðK þ cÞ, . Unlike in nutrient rich conditions associated with swarms,
this implies that biofilm growth is fundamentally transient; once the nutrient field at the interior is
depleted as c ! 0, biofilm growth term in that region is arrested and g1 ! 0 independently of the
vertical thickness (i.e., even if hf 6¼ Hf0). As a result, the biofilm does not give form a central plateau
and the dynamics of the biofilm rim is fixed by the dynamics of nutrient depletion. Eventually the
effect of the finite-size of the system (the petri dish) also becomes important it determines the over-
all dynamics of nutrient depletion.
Active and passive fluxes
The terms Q1ðxÞ and Q2ðxÞ that represent the horizontal flux of the active and passive phases are
obtained by depth integrating the momentum balance equations in the thin-film lubrication limit, as
described in Appendix 2 (c.f. Equations (A9)-(A11)). Within bacterial swarms, the passive aqeuous
fluid phase is modeled as a Newtonian liquid with viscosity 2. The first term of Q1ðxÞ and Q2ðxÞ in
Table 1 for swarms is generated by viscous and capillary stresses within the swarm fluid. The active
swarmer cells are treated as inviscid and subjected to a hydrodynamic frictional drag force. Specifi-
cally, we assume that individual bacteria within the swarm are undergoing a random walk process with
zero net displacement (upon averaging over sufficiently large time-intervals). Even though there is no
overall displacement, there is a net time-averaged drift that arises from viscous stokes drag interaction
between the fluid and the active bacteria. The second term for Q1ðxÞ in Table 1 represents this time-
averaged drift arising from frictional drag interaction of the bacteria with the swarm fluid.
In biofilms, the EPS matrix phase constitutes an active viscous hydrogel network with viscosity 1,
whereas the passive aqueous fluid phase is treated as a solvent with viscosity 2. The dominant stress
within the EPS phase in the biofilm model arises from a Flory-Huggins swelling pressure in the polymer
chains (Cogan and Guy, 2010; Winstanley et al., 2011). In the fluid phase, the pressure pf is set by
surface tension and curvature of the swarm fluid. Both these stresses contribute to the effective EPS
phase pressure term PðxÞ, as described in Appendix 2. Consequently, the first term for Q1ðxÞ and Q2ðxÞ
in Table 1 for biofilms is related to the gradient of the effective pressure. Moreover, following
Winstanley et al. (2011), we assume that the capillary and viscous stresses in the swarm fluid are negli-
gible when compared to the frictional drag due to flow between water and the EPS polymer chain net-
work in the biofilm model. Therefore, the second term for Q2ðxÞ in Table 1 represents a Darcy-type
flow of the aqueous phase within the EPS matrix. The osmotic influx terms are considered separately
in the following sections when describing the equations governing swarm and biofilm expansion.

Bacterial swarms
Species of bacteria that swarm on hydrated surfaces are known to secrete distinct wetting agents. For
example, B. subtilis secretes the lipopeptide surfactin, whereas P. aeruginosa secrets rhamnolipids as
the wetting agent. Consequently, existing thin-film models to describe bacterial swarming assume
that gradients in wetting agent activity generate Marangoni stresses that drives swarming motility
(Fauvart et al., 2012; Trinschek et al., 2018). However, E. coli exhibits swarming behavior despite
the absence of lipopeptides or other agents that act as surfactants. Moreover, recent experiments
(Yang et al., 2017) demonstrates that P. aeruginosa swarms robustly even after exogenously eliminat-
ing gradients in surfactant concentration within the swarm fluid, eliminating Marangoni flows as the
principal mechanism that drives swarming. Here, we take a different approach based on experiments
that show that steady-state swarm colony expansion maybe mediated by secretion of agents that are
osmotically active (Wu and Berg, 2012). As we will see, this leads to fluid being extracted from the
substrate near the front, then driven into the colony by capillary and viscous stresses, and eventually
returns into the substrate in the interior of the swarm.
Within the bacterial swarms, the dominant phases are the swarmer cell phase, and the viscous
aqueous phase, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 2A. Fluid uptake from the substrate is regu-
lated by the secretion of osmotically active agents by the swarmer cells (Ping et al., 2014). We repre-
sent the osmotic agent in the fluid by a concentration field, cosmðfÞ that is proportional to the local
volume fraction of cells such that c / f=ð1   fÞ, and gives rise to an osmotic pressure described by
van’t Hoff’s law as (van’t Hoff, 1887), D	 ¼ 	0f=ð1   fÞ   	eq
 
, that drives the fluid intake. Here, 	0
is the osmotic pressure scale in the swarm fluid and 	eq is the equilibrium osmotic pressure within the
underlying tissue/gel substrate. Away from the front, in the interior of the swarm colony, there is no
net fluid influx (Ping et al., 2014). Therefore, the equilibirium volume fraction of the swarm cells at the
interior is, f0 ¼ 	eq=ð	0 þ 	eqÞ. At the front itself, the difference in osmotic pressure results in a net
Darcy-type fluid influx into the swarm, V0ðxÞ, expressed as,

where Q0 is a velocity scale associated with fluid inflow from the substrate. Measurements of cell rep-
lication within swarms reveals that growth is restricted to swarmer cells at the periphery
(Hamouche et al., 2017), which we model using a modified logistic growth term g1ðh;fÞ as listed in
Table 1, that localizes all cell division to the periphery. Here, Hf0 is the limiting thickness of the
swarmer-cell phase at the interior, and g0 is an effective specific growth rate, related to true specific
cell growth rate by a geometric factor (see discussion in Appendix. [2]).
Parameters and scaling laws for bacterial swarms
To make sense of the scales in the problem, we use the dimensionless variables ^x ¼ x=L, ^z ¼ z=H and
^t ¼ tg0 where H is the vertical length scale, L is a horizontal length scale and 1=g0 is the time-scale
associated with bacterial growth. The resultant horizontal velocity scale in the swarm colony is
U ¼ Lg0. Swarm expansion is fluid driven, and therefore balancing the viscous stresses generated in
the swarm fluid, with the curvature pressure due to surface tension (Levich and Landau, 1942)
results in 2U=H2 ~ gH=L3, where 2 is the viscosity and g is the surface tension of the aqueous
phase. As a result, the natural horizontal length scale is L ¼ HðCaÞ 1=3, where Ca ¼ ð2U=gÞ is a cap-
illary number associated with the microbial swarm fluid. Consequently, in our model the expansion
speed of the swarm colony, V ¼ dR=dt, is determined by the product of the horizontal length scale
and an effective growth rate, and is predicted to scale as,
V ¼ C1g0HCa 1=3:

whereas, the swarm front itself is analogous to a capillary ridge in thin fluid film with a width W that
is predicted to scale as,
W ¼ C2Ca 1=3:

discussed later. There are two important dimensionless parameters that describe swarm colony
expansion. The first dimensionless parameter, a1, relates the magnitude of capillary forces to the vis-
cous drag acting on cells within the swarm and is defined as a1 ¼ ðgH=L2Þ=ðzLUÞ. Here, z ¼ zc=Vc
where zc is the friction coefficient of a single swarmer cell and Vc is its volume. The second dimen-
sionless parameter a2 is defined as the ratio of a vertical fluid influx velocity Q0, to a thickness veloc-
ity scale Hg0 associated with bacterial growth as a2 ¼ Q0=ðHg0Þ.
The vertical length scale and equilibrium fluid volume fraction are estimated from the interior
monolayer region as H = 0.5 mm and f0 ¼ 0:5 (Wu and Berg, 2012). We assume values of 2 ¼ 10 3
Pa.s for the (aqeuous) swarm fluid viscosity, and g ¼ 10 2 N/m as its surface tension. The friction
coefficient of a single cell is estimated from Stokes law as zc ¼ 3p2a, and its volume is approxi-
mated as Vc ¼ pa3=6, where a = 1 mm is the cell diameter. Therefore, the friction coefficient is
z ¼ zc=Vc » 182=a2. As a result of substituting the values of known parameters above, the dimension-
less parameter a1 reduces to a constant geometric ratio, a1 » 2a2=H2 » 2=9 » 0:22.
The value of a2 depends on the ratio Q0=g0. Direct experimental measurements of the vertical
influx fluid velocity profile V0ðxÞ and the spatial profiles of cell division in swarm colonies remain
scarce (Hamouche et al., 2017). In order to make progress in validating our model with real experi-
mental data, the vertical fluid influx velocity scale is chosen as Q0 ¼ 10 2 m/s. Consequently, we
have chosen g0 as the only fitting parameter in our study, as detailed in Appendix 2. As an example,
in the following section we will show that a choice of g0 ¼ 0:013 s-1 in our model reproduces the
experimental swarm expansion speed shown in Figure 1D, and leads to a horizontal length scale of
L ¼ HðCaÞ 1=3 ¼ 100 m, velocity scale of U ¼ Lg0 ¼ 1:3 m s-1, Ca ¼ 1:3  10 7 and a value of
a2 » 1:5. A complete set of parameters for three experimental measurements of swarm expansion in
B. subtilis, and two existing measurements in E. coli previously reported by Darnton et al. (2010)
and Wu and Berg (2012) are summarized in Appendix 2.
Steady state swarms
With these assumptions, and assuming that the nutrient concentration is constant, Equations (1–3)
reduce to the following scaled equations in the swarming limit,

To complete the formulation of the problem, we need five boundary conditions which are
^h^xð0Þ ¼ ^h^xðRPÞ ¼ 0, ^h^x^x^xð0Þ ¼ ^h^x^x^xðRPÞ ¼ 0, and fð0Þ ¼ f0, where RP is the dimensionless size of the
petri-dish and is set much larger than the colony size (^R ¼ 150) in our simulations. The initial condition
corresponds to a circularly inoculated swarm colony, along with a thin pre-wetting film where no
bacterial growth occurs (see Appendix 3—figure 1).
Solving Equations (7) and (8) with the prescribed initial and boundary conditions numerically
results in a steady state solution that advances at a constant speed (see Figure 3). In Figure 3, we
plot a representative steady state solution in the frame of the advancing front for a1 ¼ 0:2, a2 ¼ 1:5
and f0 ¼ 0:5. At the interior of the swarm, the average cell volume fraction is f » f0. Near the lead-
ing edge of the swarm, there is a region of enhanced thickness as indicated by the red line in
Figure 3A. Immediately behind the leading edge, where the cell concentration is highest, so is the
osmolyte concentration leading to fluid extraction from the substrate, while further behind, fluid is
reabsorbed, as indicated by the arrows in Figure 3A. In Figure 3B, we show the steady-state
osmotic flow solution and see that it correlates well with the experimentally measured osmotic pres-
sure profile by Ping et al. (2014) in E. coli swarms. As shown in Appendix 3—figure 3, our numeri-
cal horizontal flow profiles are also consistent the scaled radial fluid velocity measurements of
Wu and Berg (2012). In Figure 3C, we see that the radial expansion velocity scales as Hg0 and
shows quantitative agreement with experiments and is insensitive to the fluid influx velocity scale
when Q0  g0H. Note that our model uses a coarse-graining procedure and represents the swarm
thickness field using a continuum approximation. As a consequence, we are not able to

quantitatively capture the decreasing height of the swarm (i.e., of the order of a few cells), that is
experimentally observed over hundreds of micron towards the interior (see Figure 1E).
Furthermore, we corroborate our scaling law in Equation (5) by fitting our model to five indepen-
dent experimental measurements of swarm expansion velocities for different systems, as shown in
Figure 3D. These include measurements in B. subtilis swarms in this work, and in E. coli swarms pre-
viously reported by Darnton et al. (2010) and Wu and Berg (2012) that are summarized in Table
A2 in Appendix 2. The expansion velocity follows the  1=3 exponent predicted by Equation (5) for
Ca varying from ~ 5  10-8 to 10-6. For each experiment, we have fit our theoretical model using the
effective growth rate g0 as the fitting parameter and find that the numerical prefactor C1 » 0:42. How-
ever, as shown in Appendix 3—figure 5 in the Appendix, the measured multi-layer width does not
follow the predicted scaling. From an experimental point of view, the width of the multi-layer region
is not sharply defined in Figure 1E, and will depend on the choice of threshold. However, our multi-

phase model is able to describe the zone of cellular and osmolyte activity near the leading edge that
drives the advancing swarm front. This leads to a picture wherein the combination of a fluid-filled
substrate and swarm front work together like a localized active circulatory system, quantitatively
rationalizing the experimental observations of Wu and Berg (2012) and Ping et al. (2014).
Bacterial films
In bacterial biofilms, the EPS matrix secreted by bacteria constitutes the active phase and undergoes
swelling, drawing in the fluid that acts as the passive phase. As shown in Figure 2B, the EPS is ini-
tially synthesized in a partially swollen, out-of-equilibrium state at the periphery. The polymer chains
gradually relax to an equilibrium fully-swollen configuration by the generation of a swelling pressure
	 within the biofilm, and via fluid uptake V0ðxÞ from the substrate. As discussed in Appendix 2, the
swelling pressure is 	ðfÞ ¼  ðfÞ=f, where  ðfÞ ¼  0  f3 is the osmotic pressure in the EPS matrix
using the Flory-Huggins model for a polymer network in a -solvent (Rubinstein and Colby, 2003),
where  0 ¼ kT=ðb3Þ is the osmotic pressure scale, kT is the product of the Boltzmann constant with
the temperature and b is the approximate size of the monomer unit. The net effective pressure term
driving biofilm expansion is, P ¼  0f3 þ pf , where pf is the capillary pressure, so that the water influx
across the substrate is
V0ðxÞ ¼ Q0ðf3   f3
0Þ:
(9)
where Q0 is the influx fluid velocity scale, f0 ¼ ð	eq=	0Þ1=3 is the fully-swollen EPS polymer volume
fraction and 	eq is the osmotic pressure of the substrate over which the colony grows. Finally, nutri-
ent uptake is modeled by a Monod growth law, while the synthesis of the EPS matrix is modeled by
a logistic term as listed in Table 1.
Parameters and scaling estimates for bacterial films
We consider dimensionless variables ^x ¼ x=L, ^z ¼ z=H, ^t ¼ tG, ^f ¼ f=f0 and ^c ¼ c=c0, where H is now
the maximum biofilm thickness, G is the rate of EPS production, and c0 is the initial nutrient concen-
tration in the substrate. As biofilm growth is nutrient limited (Liu et al., 2015), the dimensionless
length scale is determined from Equation (3) and is expected to scale as L ¼ ðD=GÞ1=2 and the corre-
sponding velocity scale is U ¼ ðDGÞ1=2.
Using these scales, we can define the ratio of osmotic stresses relative to viscous stress in the EPS
phase in terms of the dimensionless parameter, b1 ¼ ð	0=LÞ=ð1U=H2Þ, the ratio of capillary stresses
relative to the EPS viscous stress in terms of another parameter, b2 ¼ ðgH=L3Þ

ð1U=H2Þ, the ratio of
capillary stress to the interfacial drag in the aqueous fluid phase, b3 ¼ ðgH=L2Þ

ðzULÞ, and the ratio
of the fluid influx velocity to the EPS swelling velocity, b4 ¼ Q0=ðHGÞ. As shown in Appendix 2, the
effective nutrient uptake rate is S ¼ ðGHf0Þ=ðc0dÞ, where G is the nutrient consumption rate per unit
concentration and d is the substrate thickness. Consequently, we define b5 ¼ S=G as the ratio of the
effective nutrient uptake rate to the EPS production rate.
We set the EPS production time-scale as G ¼ 1=40 min 1, resulting in a horizontal length scale of
L ¼ ðD=GÞ1=2 ¼ 1:1 mm and velocity scale U ¼ ðDGÞ1=2 ¼ 0:5 m/s. The effective nutrient uptake rate
is estimated as S ¼ 1=25 min 1, where we have taken d ¼ 7 mm as the substrate thickness
(Srinivasan et al., 2018), G ¼ 10 2 mM/s as the nutrient uptake rate (Zhang et al., 2010), and
c0 ¼ 35 mM as the initial concentration of the carbon source. The friction coefficient is z ~ 2=2,
where the EPS mesh size is  ¼ 50 nm (Yan et al., 2017). Using measured estimates of the biofilm
viscosity 1 ¼ 105 Pa.s (Stoodley et al., 2002; Lau et al., 2009), fluid phase viscosity 2 ¼ 10 3 Pa.s,
surface tension g ¼ 10 2 N/m, an osmotic scale 	0 ¼ 2100 Pa (Yan et al., 2017) (i.e., f0 ¼ 0:04), bio-
film thickness H ¼ 400 m, and nutrient diffusivity in agarose gels of D ¼ 5  10 10/s (Zhang et al.,
2010) implies that b1 » 7, b2 » 0:01, b3 » 0:02, b4 » 1 and b5 » 2. Consequently, within the context of
our model, it is evident that osmotic stresses, fluid influx and biomass growth are the dominant
forces that drive colony expansion. Moreover, in the nutrient limited regime, our model predicts the
transient maximum biofilm expansion velocity to scale as,

^c^xð0Þ ¼ ^c^xðRPÞ ¼ 0, where the dimensionless petri-dish size is chosen as RP ¼ 16 to match the size of
typical 35 mm diameter petri dishes used in experiments (Srinivasan et al., 2018). In Figure 4A, we
plot the time evolution of the shape and nutrient concentration field for a biofilm colony of initial
radius ^R0 ¼ 0:5 and thickness ^hin ¼ 0:06.
Unlike in the case of swarms, the solutions to Equations (12)–(14) are transient, and exhibit two
distinct expansion regimes: initial acceleration phase until ^tc ¼ 5, followed by a decelerating phase
beyond. For ^t <^tc, colony expansion arises as the microbes rapidly consumes locally available nutrient
at the interior and synthesize fresh EPS matrix, generating spatial gradients in nutrient availability
(see Figure 4A). In Figure 4B, we show that the newly synthesized EPS generates a large osmotic
pressure differential between the biofilm and the substrate, and osmotic fluid influx gradually relaxes
the biofilm matrix to a swollen configuration. For t > tc, the localized zone of EPS production near
the film front propagates with a fixed shape as shown in Figure 4C, consistent with the observed
spatial localization in tapA gene activity (see Figure 1J and Srinivasan et al., 2018). Moreover, the
radial colony expansion profile in Figure 4D is also consistent with the non-monotonic front speed
observed experimentally (Srinivasan et al., 2018). For the specific experimental conditions we con-
sider, our detailed theory allows us to estimate the prefactors in the scaling laws Equations (10)–
(11) so that C3 » 0:2 and C4 » 1:8.
These results are hallmarks of a transition from a bulk to an edge biofilm growth mode, triggered
by nutrient limitation (Pirt, 1967). In the deceleration regime, diffusive transport of nutrients from a
region external to the colony continues to sustain EPS production at the biofilm periphery, analo-
gous to Stefan-like problems in solidification. Our generalized multiphase model is thus able to
quantitatively rationalize the expansion curves, transition time and localized biological activity
observed experimentally, and demonstrates that nutrient availability and diffusive transport governs
the dynamics of Bacillus subtilis macrocolonies grown on agar.

Discussion
Analysis of collective microbial expansion in thin film geometries often prioritizes biological mecha-
nisms, such as genetic regulation, developmental programs and cellular signaling/competition, over
the role of the heterogeneous physical micro-environments. Here we have presented a multi-phase
theory that quantitatively describes the expansion dynamics of microbial swarms and biofilms and
considers variations in the colony thickness, an aspect of colony expansion that has often been over-
looked in many theories (Korolev et al., 2012; Ghosh et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). The result-
ing unified description of both steady-state swarms and transient biofilm spreading leads to simple
estimates and scaling laws for the colony expansion rate that are validated via comparison with
experimental measurements for different systems. In swarms, exudation of water from the perme-
able substrate via bacterial osmolyte secretion facilitates steady state colony expansion. Numerical
solutions of our model demonstrate that the shape of the swarm front is determined by capillarity,
and its expansion speed by cell-division and growth, leading to scaling laws validated by comparison
with previous experiments. In contrast, transient biofilm macrocolony expansion on agar is driven by
osmotic polymer stresses generated via EPS matrix production in a spatially localized zone at the
periphery. Nutrient transport and depletion leads to the formation of these heterogenous zones,
and results in two regimes in biofilm expansion.
However our depth-integrated theory also has certain limitations. For example, we are unable to
capture discrete thickness variations of the order of a few cells, which might require an agent-based
approach. For bacterial swarms, our model is unable to quantitatively account for the region of
enhanced thickness (i.e., the multilayer region in Figure 1C and E), likely because the multilayer
width is difficult to experimentally ascertain, owing to the large tail distribution seen in the mean
intensity trace in Figure 1E, and the arbitrariness in the choice of threshold in Appendix 3—figure
5. Similarly, in the context of biofilm colony expansion, our model does not account for sliding and

frictional contact between the cells/EPS matrix and the substrate (Farrell et al., 2013). More gener-
ally, our mean-field picture neglects fluctuation-driven effects during colony expansion, such as the
formation multicellular raft structures (Kearns, 2010) and synchronized long-range interactions
(Chen et al., 2017).
Natural next steps of our approach include (i) adding three-dimensional effects by allowing for
spatial variations in the mechanical stresses, flows and nutrient fields in the vertical direction, (ii)
accounting for orientational order in the bacterial swarms and films, and (iii) accounting for interfacial
tension on the stability of the growing swarm/biofilm-fluid interface, especially in the context of fin-
gering instabilities in microbial colonies Trinschek et al. (2018).
A rigorous multi-phase approach may also be relevant in revisiting pattern formation phenomena
in microbial colony expansion (Matsushita et al., 1999), that so far been addressed primarily using
various non-linear diffusion models (Golding et al., 1998; Allen and Waclaw, 2019) that ignore the
third dimension. Finally, from an experimental and theoretical perspective, our results naturally raise
the question of controlling biofilm and swarm expansion by manipulating water and nutrient avail-
ability, complementing the better studied approaches of manipulating colonies by the genetic regu-
lation of EPS production, cell division, and chemical signaling in microbial colonies.

Experiment
Strains
In this study, we used two B. subtilis strains, MTC822 and MTC832, that were both previously
constructed from a wild-type NCIB 3610 B. subtilis strain using a standard transformation
protocol (Sinha, 2013). The MTC822 strain is used for fluorescence visualization in the
swarming experiment, where the mkate2 red fluorescent protein reports on the activity of the
constitutive hyperspank promotor via the amyE::Phyperspank-mkate2 construct. The MTC832
strain was used in the biofilm experiments in order to visualize localized matrix production
activity and harbors the amyE::PtapA-cfp construct. In the MTC832 strain, the cfp cyan
fluorescent protein reports on the activity of the tapA gene that is associated with
exopolysaccharide production activity.
Materials and methods
Swarm plates were prepared using 0.5 wt% agarose gel (A1296, Sigma) infused with 25 ml of
Luria-Bertani (Miller) medium (i.e. 10 g/L Tryptone 10 g/L NaCl 5 g/L Yeast Extract, Sigma) and
25 mg/ml Chloramphenicol. Biofilm plates were prepared using 1.5 wt% agarose gel (A1296,
Sigma) infused with the standard MSgg biofilm-inducing growth medium (Branda et al., 2001)
(i.e. 50 mM MnCl2, 5 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM ZnCl2, 50 mM FeCl3, 2 mM MgCl2, 700 mM CaCl2, 50
mg/ml threonine, 50 mg/ml tryptophan, 50 mg/ml phenylalanine, 0.5 wt% glutamate, 0.5 wt%
glycerol, 2 mM thiamine and 100 mM MOPS (pH 7)) and 50 mg/ml Spectinomycin. Note that all
plates underwent an identical drying protocol prior to use. Freshly poured plates were initially
dried with the lid open under a laminar flow hood for 15 min. Subsequently, the lid was closed
and the dish was cooled at 25 C overnight for a period of 10 hr. All strains were initially grown
in fresh Luria-Bertani (Miller) broth medium (Sigma) until mid-exponential phase in a shaker/
incubator at 37C. The cultures were diluted to OD650 ¼ 0:1 and ~ 1 l drop was deposited onto
the corresponding swarm (for MTC822) or biofilm (for MTC832) plates. The petri-plates were
transfered to a 30C incubator chamber during growth. Fluorescence imaging was performed
using a Zeiss Axiozoom.V16 microscope with a PlanNeoFluar Z 1.0x objective (NA 0.25), with a
Zeiss 63 HE filter to image the red mkate2 protein, and a Zeiss 47 HE filter to image the cyan
cfp protein. For swarm profile measurements, images of the advancing swarm front were
captured every 10 s over a period of 10 min. For biofilm colonies, expansion velocities were
measured every 10 min over a period of 72 hr following the protocol described in
Srinivasan et al. (2018).

Theory
Consider a quasi-2D expanding swarm or biofilm colony where, x denotes the horizontal
direction and z denotes the vertical (thickness) direction. The macroscopic colony is described
by (i) the thickness field hðx; tÞ, (ii) the volume fraction of the active phase (i.e. swarmer cells or
EPS matrix fðx; tÞ and (iii) the averaged concentration field in the substrate cðx; tÞ.
Nutrient transport
We assume that ~cðx; z; tÞ is the nutrient concentration in the substrate denoted by region
 d < z < 0, where z ¼ 0 is the substrate/colony interface and d is the substrate thickness. The
time evolution of ~cðx; z; tÞ is governed by the diffusion equation.
q~c
qt   Dr2~c ¼ 0

where D is the diffusivity of the nutrient in the agarose gel. Integrating the diffusion equation
through the substrate thickness results in,

ðK þ cÞ
(A2)
where cðx; tÞ ¼ ð1=dÞ
R 0
 d ~cdz is the mean depth-averaged nutrient concentration in the
substrate, G is the specific nutrient consumption rate, and K is the half velocity constant at
which the specific growth rate is one half the maximum value. In obtaining Equation (A2), we
have balanced nutrient efflux from the substrate with nutrient consumption within the colony
as D q~c=qz
ð
Þj d ¼  Ghfc=ðK þ cÞ. Equation (A2) describes nutrient transport within the
permeable tissue/gel substrate underneath the colony, and holds when the diffusion time
scale is much smaller than the flow time scale within the low-aspect-ratio substrate. Upon non-
dimensionalizing Equation (A2), the effective nutrient consumption rate S used in Table 1 in
the main text is given by S ¼ Ghfeq=ðc0dÞ, where h is the colony thickness scale, feq is the
active phase volume fraction scale and c0 is the initial nutrient concentration in the substrate.

Continuity

the fluid phase along the x (horizontal) and z (vertical) directions respectively. Integrating

where the no-flux condition is applied to active phase at z ¼ 0 : For the aqueous phase, at
z ¼ 0, there is a spatial fluid influx described by V0ðxÞ due to the osmotic pressure difference
between the substrate and the microbial colony. Both phases at the upper interface at z ¼ h
obey the kinematic boundary condition. In Equations (A2), (A5) and (A6), the five unknown
fields are h, f, c, u1 and u2. The remaining two equations for closure are obtained from an
averaged momentum balance.
Momentum balance
The averaged momentum balances for each phase can be expressed as (Ishii and Hibiki,
2011; Drew, 1983),

where s1 is the averaged stress tensor acting on a volume element of the swarm cell/EPS
matrix phase, s2 is the averaged stress tensor in a volume element of the fluid phase and M
denotes the total momentum transfer between the swarm cell/EPS matrix and the fluid
phase. The interfacial momentum transfer term is expressed as (Ishii and Hibiki, 2011;
Drew, 1983),
M ¼ pf rf   zfðu1   u2Þ:
(A11)
The first term in Equation (A11) denotes the force pf rf due to the averaged interfacial
pressure (Drew, 1983; Ishii and Hibiki, 2011) on the cells/EPS matrix by the surrounding
fluid. Note that the momentum transfer terms in Equations (A9)-(A10) balance each other as
the averaged pressures at the two-phase interface are equal, leading to a vanishing net
buoyancy. The second term corresponds to the net viscous stokes drag, where z is a friction
coefficient. While Equations (A9–A11) are generally applicable in describing both swarms
and films, particular expressions that describe s1; s2 and z are unique to swarming and
biofilm expansion and are discussed below for each case.
Bacterial swarms
Within microbial swarms, the fluid phase is modeled as a Newtonian liquid with viscosity 2
whereas the swarmer cells are treated as inviscid with an isotropic stress equal to the
surrounding fluid pressure pf . The averaged constitutive laws for the swarmer cell phase and
the fluid phase are expressed as,

Thin-film lubrication limit for swarms

Growth rate of bacterial swarms
We note that bacterial swarming is typically associated with nutrient rich environments,
where the initial concentration level c0  G, the specific nutrient consumption rate.
Paradoxically, although the rate of bacterial cell division and volume expansion are
exponential, the rate of swarm expansion is constant. Therefore, despite abundant nutrient
availability, cell division must be halted at the swarm interior through non-nutrient meditated
regulatory/signaling mechanisms, such that only a subpopulation of swarmer cells undergo
cell division. In our study, we account for this effect by considering a simple logistic model
for the growth term of the form,
g1ðh;f;cÞ ¼ g0f 1   hf
Hf0


;
(A20)
where H is the swarm colony thickness at the interior, and g0 is an effective growth rate that
accounts for spatial localization in cell division. More specifically, if LðxÞ describes the spatial
profile of cell growth within a swarm colony, then g0 ¼
R R
0 LðxÞdx=
R R
0 f½1   ðhf=ðHf0ÞÞdx,
where R is the radius of the swarm colony. Measurements of the spatial distribution of cell
growth rates within the colony during swarming remain lacking. Consequently, in our model,
we determine the value of g0 by fitting it to the experimental data. We use a nonlinear least-
squares solver to match steady-state expansion speeds obtained from solving
Equations (A21)-(A22) to the experimental data for steady-state B. subtilis swarms (see
Figure 1D in main text).

In our model, the EPS matrix constitutes an active viscous hydrogel network with a polymer

biofilm and swarm simulations respectively. We use quintic Lagrange basis functions with
element sizes below 0.04 and use the general form PDE solver. To handle the moving
contact line, we introduce a precursor film of thickness hp=H = 0.0125, where H is the vertical
length scale (see Appendix 3—figure 1). We follow the regularization described in
Trinschek et al. (2016) to introduce a minimum threshold for growth and a stable fixed point
in the precursor film. Specifically, the growth terms in (A2), (A20) and (A32) are multiplied by
