      God created the human being and distinguished 
him from other creatures by the brain which is the 
source of perception, comprehending, meditation 
and insight; to explain the various phenomena that 
the human understand from its significance the 
ability of the creator whom there is nothing like 
him. And one of the most notable of these 
phenomena is sciences with its various kinds and 
forms, whether the religious or the temporal, the 
exact sciences or the bioscience, the astronomy 
…etc, and we find mathematics as one of the exact 
sciences, this science that has been known by the 
human and has become based on calculations, 
equations, algebra and geometry, and mathematics 
is used in many other sciences in view of its 
importance. 
Numbers are one of the elements of mathematics. 
And there are some people who expand the gap 
between the digit and the number but with 
explanation we recognize that the digit and the 

addition numbers are the symbols that form the 
numbers, and numbers is the plural of number and 
the verb is count, so the term does not change the 
meaning, if it was global so the digits express all the 
numbers, and whenever we talk about digits the 
human being thinks that they have no end, and the 
intention of “digits have end” includes numbers too. 
Because the common mistake till now is believing 
that the digits have no end, and this idea isn’t of a 
scientific origin but the result of the disability of 
comprehending the reality of science. 
Because digits have an end and its end is inevitable, 
whereas the weird thing isn’t that the digits have an 
end but how do people believe that they don’t, and 
this because they are attached to the idea that: 
If x was the greatest number then x+1>x and can we 
deal without knowing none of its solutions? 
And if digits are known if the forms that we write 
then why do we write infinity as a linguistic term? 

And from a religious view: God is the one who has 
no beginning nor ending then why the digits have 
no end? 
And it’s really weird if the human believes that 
digits have no end while he’s living on earth! 
And isn’t infinity a digit and the human knows that 
mathematics is digits? What is weird about 
mathematics is infinity because this is incompatible 
with the digits because: 1,2,3… and so on increasing 
or decreasing there is a sequence of digits then why 
believing in infinity, this expression doesn’t worth 
to exist in mathematics which rely on proofs and 
laws because the mystery  especially in the end of 
numbers is a sign that mathematics didn’t succeed 
in its attempt of being based on axioms, that’s why 
it cannot be considered logically as a kind of science 
for it contains the argument of the digits that have 
no end and we don’t have to deal with the 
unknown in mathematics; the unknown that digits 
don’t end because the brain with positive thinking 

doesn’t accept that and makes the human thinks 
and wonders why am I dealing with digits and 
obligated to say that they don’t end, why don’t I 
liberate my mind and impose the logic and look for 
a real substitute that makes the idea of digits have 
no end just a trick and an illusion and I got rid of it. 
But although I will accept that the digits end the 
doubters will keep chasing my thinking with the 
question: what is the biggest number? But with my 
brain I’ll excel and succeed but how? 
With time that doesn’t stop nor come back, with 
the instantaneous moments that will pass and not 
be repeated, to prevent myself not be deceived 
unless by science and reality. If it was me who count 
from a time ago, from a part of a second; from a 
second, a minute, or even an hour, a day, a week, a 
month… a year or a century, but if there was a 
succession of counting from Adam peace be upon 
him wouldn’t the past be repeated ? 

And is x+1>x and x+2>x+1 and like that the time 
stops with proceeding the arithmetic operations? 
And if a human started counting from last night 
from 0, does his counting causes that the sun of 
today doesn’t rise?  
 
 
 
 

 
If the time stopped and the night were lasting by 
counting then the digits have no end; but sunrise is 
a proof that the time passes and the digits have an 
end, though keeping counting the time doesn’t stop 
but it keeps moving without stopping nor coming 
back. And in view of the expiration of a period then 
the absolute counting is a time and counting an 
existing thing cannot be unknown, for example 
counting sand grains in the beach, or counting the 
stars in the space takes a long time, and here is a 
merge of time with existence in the place, so the 
digits originally are time and time is an integral part 
of space and this one is related to existence, which 

means that digits are an existential branch with a 
start and an end, but may time ends to indicate that 
digits have end? 
Actually time ends and its ending is now and so its 
beginning, hence the digits end temporarily, means 
that no matter how the human adds 1 to any 
number, the time that goes without return imposes 
its end, and if you start counting from 0 from a 
minute ago and you reached a specific number, 
didn’t the previous counting go with the time which 
doesn’t return. A human starts counting: 0, 1, 2, 3… 
and so on; the moments that passed won’t return, 
means that the previous counting passed and won’t 
return as well. 

 
And from another view: since mathematics is an 
exact science, then why the digits have no end? 
The exact science is nothing more than a science 
controlled by facts. For example in Biology while 
studying a cell, there is no room for imagination for 

the cell is of a real origin whether it was vegetarian 
or animal. So mathematics doesn’t have to be based 
on illusions and imagination which is the source of 
science follies, and the idea of digits have no end is 
one of these follies because it’s far from the 
scientific truth which doesn’t accept unless a logical 
explanation for phenomena and characteristics. The 
digits have end and this is the reality but the 
humans still believe in the opposite, because 
mathematics is a science that doesn’t accept unless 
the truth without the slightest doubt. And it is a 
fallacy that we use the infinity in mathematics and 
in all science. Because the matter leads to a 
questioning that doesn’t accept a convincing 
answer for the science isn’t Metaphysics or 
Philosophy, it cannot be overwhelmed by conflict 
and dialectics, but science is by theories and proofs. 
And maybe the truth lies in the beginnings of 
mathematics in its old origins like Egypt and the 
Babel Civilization in Iraq and India and Greece. We 
observe that it came to be used in solving 

calculation problems that the human being couldn’t 
solve, like the construction of buildings and 
calculating areas, from that we recognize that the 
science of mathematics and since its first 
appearance wasn’t  meant to express naughtiness 
and emptiness. The use of arithmetic and digits was 
to indicate the findings. But how did mathematics 
become different as it is now out of scope of the 
truth and science. What leaded to the strangeness 
of mathematics is believing in the idea of the digits 
have no end, and that leaded to the argument of 
digits and its end and there for new equations that 
use this illusion was invented, and this is a novelty 
made mathematics in general and digits especially 
in conflict with science, and this idea was inherited 
from a generation to another till now. Mathematics 
that reached us is different from the original, 
because it contains what is not true and not logical 
that is the idea that we talked about, because the 
digits have an end and there are many proofs that 
confirm it logically, because the Man by nature love 

asking questions to reach to a convincing result. 
Whenever we talk about digits we find the human 
asking in his imagination: What is the end of digits? 
And he quickly gets rid of this idea and says that 
digits have no end though he’s the one who’s 
dealing with digits, but why don’t he rather say that 
they do have end, this is more logical and real, but 
how? It’s necessary that he understand the reality 
and then sees the idea that is incompatible with the 
reality inacceptable, and of the simplest beginnings 
that he asks positive questions like: since the 
human is the one who’s counting and there is a 
start to the counting then why there isn’t an end? 
Experiment: 
Let be three persons; 
The first one starts counting from 0 and stops at the 
number “x” and the second person continue 
counting to the number “y”. Then y>x, and the third 
one starts from “y” to “z”. Then z>y , and so on if 
there is another person who’ll keep counting from 

“z” to “w”, then w>z. But from 0 to w time didn’t 
stop. And if there was a machine that counts from 0 
to an unknown time, is time indicating an existing? 
No, the counting is absolute, but does the 
machine’s counting have significance? And, this 
machine, by continuing counting, does it change the 
time? Time didn’t stop with counting, even if a 
machine does that. Do digits and mathematics have 
laws for other creatures too? Or just in the Human 
universe? 
Mathematics was known by the Human, and there 
are some animals that distinguish its herd, and we 
don’t know if it knows the number or it does that 
with other ways. 
Are 0, 1 and other numbers related to the Humans’ 
existence? The Man is the one who invented 
numbers to help him in his daily life to count and 
calculate, and is it logical the Human believes that 
digits have no end? 

Of the proofs that confirm that digits are relates 
with the Humans’ existence: 
0: Before Adam PBUH, There was no existence for 
the human being. 
1: It’s Adam PBUH, the beginning of digits 
(+) 
The period from the existence of Adam PBUH, 
passing by the period of the Prophet Mohammed 
PBUH, to the current moment. 
(+)  
The world population currently. 
(+) 
24 hour(+) to the last day. 
From all these questions and their answers we can 
build proofs and arguments for our idea that states 
for the end of digits. But we have to transfer from 
imagination to reality, and the common question 
will be: do you know that digits have end? 

And before asking this question we have to prepare 
for the answer about how do they have end, and to 
answer the doubters we have to deal with the term 
of digits as a matter of reality, and from here starts 
the analysis of digits from a mathematic view. 
Mathematics is a science, and science shouldn’t be 
covered by ambiguity and mystery, there for from a 
mathematic side and by a logical explanation we 
can say that digits have an end, and if the opposite 
were right then 2-1=1 is false too, because the 
infinity cannot be decreasing, because it’s nonsense 
increasing and an absolute random, and if digits 
didn’t have end we wouldn’t know the countdown 
which is a regular and consecutive deduction 
operation, because the countdown is returning with 
digits and this is incompatible with the idea of 
infinity. Besides, the numeric symmetry, every 
positive number has a parallel negative number, 
and there are other things unless mathematics 
confirm that, for example the magnetic field of the 
earth and its gravity and the electron that has a 

negative electric charge, and these are all proofs 
from the universe of existence that confirm our 
idea. And when we look from the side of time which 
proves that digits have end too, there are photons 
that transport the suns’ light to the earth, the 
photon takes that whole time estimated in millions 
of years from the soles of the sun to the earth and 
the lights’ speed doesn’t separate from time for it 
is: 3.10^8 m/s. But although this enormous speed of 
light, it no longer exists in the black hole, and it’s 
impossible to pass through the black holes, and this 
is what shows that physics laws don’t change, and if 
we want to explain the sense by digits we say: if the 
light with it’s enormous speed cannot pass through 
the black hole and in view of the high temperature 
of the black hole which contributes to the existence 
of that great energy, why don’t other equations 
that can discover a way to reduce its temperature 
and its gravity, exist. Why don’t other equations, as 
beginnings to find a speed higher than the speed of 
light, beat the gravity of the black hole and realize 

the dream of humanity to travel through time, exist. 
The existence isn’t like the naughtiness, the laws of 
physics that we know is a product of finding like the 
gravity discovered by Newton. Besides the theory of 
Einstein about relativity, it was just a product of 
what is existed. Also the chemical compounds, it 
was discovered through the study of the 
components of matters, and so mathematics, it was 
derived from nature. And one other of the proofs 
that digits have end, the big-bang and the life of 
stars, because after the big-bag, the Spacetime was 
engendered, and these approaches that we know 
about the ages of the planets and the stars 
estimated in billions of years and the earth’s age 
estimated in 4.6 billion year, we observe the merge 
of time and digits, because without time the digits 
that we know wouldn’t exist, because although the 
Man discovered digits, actually they existed before, 
when time existed for the first time. And every 
findings’ life can be expressed in term of time, time 
isn’t just an illusion, the oxygen that we inhale is 

invisible and so time and digits. So the idea that 
digits don’t end is nothing but an illusion. What 
proves that is the mathematical paradoxes, for 
example Hilbert’s paradox: ther is a hotel with a 
countably infinite number of rooms, all of which are 
occupied, it can accommodate extra arriving 
guests even if their number was infinite, but can 
we embody this paradox in reality to understand 
it? 
The answer: 
No, and that Hilbert’s paradox is an imaginary, so 
the infinity is of a serial origin
 
And the digits have end is a truth and a reality, and 
the opposite is a naughtiness and an emptiness, you 
have as a human being not to believe in it. And this 

beginning of this idea is just a try, whether the 
researchers give it an interest or it will be rejected. 
And with this idea we can discover the mysterious 
secrets of the universe. 
And God know best.
