(Dated: February 26, 2019)
Noether’s theorem is an elegant and powerful tool of classical mechanics, but it is of little to no
consequence in discrete theories.
Here we deﬁne and explore a discrete approach to covariant
mechanics and show that within this framework a discrete version of Noether’s theorem, completely
analogous to the well-known continuum version with all its ramiﬁcations, remains valid. We also
discuss why more traditional approaches to discretized mechanics violate certain conservation laws
by construction.

INTRODUCTION
Discretization plays a major role in many areas of physics and engineering. On one hand, it constitutes the basis
for numerical algorithms aimed at solving complex problems in mechanics, ﬂuid dynamics, electrodynamics and
general relativity. On the other hand, discretization is also important in certain branches of theoretical physics.
Richard Feynman [1], for example, relied on discretization techniques to deﬁne and construct his path integral
which in the course of time lead to great advances in the understanding of QED and QCD [2]. Lattice QCD
can even be understood as a deﬁnition of the theory of strong interactions, rather than a mere discretization
of a continuum theory [3]. Similarly, the spin foam approach to quantum gravity uses simplicial discretizations
as a building block to deﬁne a theory of quantum gravity [4–7]. More recently, it has even been argued that
discrete theories provide a minimal yet complete description of elementary physics [8, 9].
Despite their many uses and applications, discretization techniques have their limitations. One of them is that
quantities which are conserved in the continuum theory may no longer be conserved in the discretized theory.
Occasionally, this failure of the discrete theory is falsely attributed to a breaking of continuous symmetry
induced by the process of discretization.
A lattice discretization of three dimensional Euclidean space, for
example, manifestly breaks SO(3) symmetry. However, despite this loss of symmetry, angular momentum is
conserved, as was ﬁrst shown by Baez and Gilliam in [10]. In fact, Baez and Gilliam, and later Bahr, Gambini,
and Pullin [11], succeeded in proving a special case of Noether’s theorem for discrete mechanical systems. Their
theorem is applicable to coordinate transformations which act on the conﬁguration space, while leaving the time
parameter unaﬀected. Consequently, their theorem links conservation of momentum and angular momentum
to the corresponding spatial symmetries in the discrete theory, but it makes no statements about systems with
time translation symmetry or about systems subjected to Galilean or Lorentzian boosts.
It was later observed by Rovelli [12] that the discretization of the covariant action for an harmonic oscillator
leads to conservation of energy in the discrete theory. In this paper, we will show that this observation can
be generalized to arbitrary (relativistic) mechanical systems, when expressed in a covariant language. We will
formulate and prove a discrete version of Noether’s theorem and thereby generalize the results of [10–12].
In section II we review the covariant formulation of classical mechanics and we compare it to the more familiar
Lagrangian formulation known from basic physics courses. In section III we then proceed to deﬁne and explore a
discrete version of covariant mechanics. The main result of this section is the formulation and proof of a discrete
version of Noether’s theorem, followed by an illustrating example. We then conclude the paper in section IV
with a few comments and outlooks.

COVARIANT MECHANICS
Mechanics is traditionally understood as the study of the dynamics of one or several bodies who’s conﬁguration
coordinates evolve in time t. The coordinate functions q(t) are thereby regarded as dynamical variables while t
is a mere parameter used to describe evolution. However, an alternative description of mechanics is available,
in which time is promoted to a dynamical variable [13]. Evolution is now described by an arbitrary, unphysical
parameter s. Position coordinates q(s) and time coordinates t(s) are treated on the same footing and, as we will
see shortly, mechanics becomes a gauge theory. If this covariant formulation of mechanics seems to be somewhat
artiﬁcial, it should be kept in mind that it arises naturally in the description of the relativistic point particle or
that Maupertuis’s principle is a covariant formulation of Newtonian mechanics in disguise (see Appendix A).

It may also seem that the covariant formulation is more complicated than the more traditional formalisms of
classical mechanics. However, it is the richer structure of the covariant theory which will allow us to formulate
a discrete version of Noether’s theorem.
A.
Reparametrization invariant Action and Equations of Motion
To describe a mechanical system in the more traditional Lagrangian formalism, one starts by introducing a
conﬁguration space C and a Lagrangian L = L(q(t), ˙q(t), t) deﬁned on the tangent bundle TC, where q(t) are
the spatial variables, ˙q(t) := dq(t)
dt , and t is the time parameter.
In order to promote t from a mere parameter to a genuine dynamical variable, we introduce the extended
conﬁguration space Cext := C × R, assumed to be an n + 1 dimensional manifold coordinatized by (q, t). By
deﬁning a space of trajectories, P := {(q, t) : [si, sf] →Cext (q, t) ∈C2(R), dt
ds ̸= 0}, we can proceed and
introduce the reparametrization invariant action functional S : P →R deﬁned by
S[q, t] :=
Z sf
si
L(q(s), ˙q(s)/˙t(s), t(s)) ˙t(s) ds,
(1)
where s parametrizes the trajectory (q, t) ∈P and the dot represents a total derivative with respect to s. Taking
the variation of this action with respect to q and t results in the following two equations1:

The usual assumption that the endpoints of the trajectory, i.e.
(qi, ti) := (q(si), t(si)) and (qf, tf) :=
(q(sf), t(sf)), are held ﬁxed under variation makes the boundary terms disappear. Simultaneously requiring
that the action is stationary with respect to variations in q and t results in the equations of motion

It is straightforward to show that the two equations of motion are not independent. More precisely, if (q, t)
satisﬁes the ﬁrst one of these equations, then the second one is automatically satisﬁed and this is purely a
consequence of the action’s reparametrization invariance. This can be seen as follows: Let σ : [si, sf] →I ⊆R
be a C2-map with s 7→σ(s) and dσ
ds ̸= 0 for all s ∈[si, sf]2. Since the action functional (1) is clearly invariant
under this reparametrization, it holds true that
δ

L (q(σ(s)), q′(σ(s))/t′(σ(s)), t(σ(s))) t′(σ(s)) ˙σ(s) ds = 0,
(4)
where the prime stands for a derivative with respect to σ and the dot for a derivative with respect to s. An
explicit computation of the variation leads to the identity

The integrand is obviously zero and the boundary term vanishes because the integration endpoints are ﬁxed.
However, assuming that (q, t) is a solution of the ﬁrst equation of motion (3) in the parametrization σ permits
one to rewrite the integral as

(6)
1 A comment on notation: Expressions like ∂L
∂q are to be understood as ∇qL, since q is a n-dimensional vector. The dot in a · b
indicates a Euclidean scalar product between the vectors a and b.
2 In concrete applications it might be more convenient to impose the stronger condition dσ
ds > 0 or dσ
ds < 0. The ﬁrst condition
preserves the orientation of the path while the second one reverses it, i.e. the trajectory (q, t) is traversed from (qf, tf) to (qi, ti)
which might be interpreted as a “backward propagation in time”.

3
which is equivalent to (q, t) satisfying the second equation of motion (3).
Hence we have shown that the
equations of motion are not independent due to the action’s reparametrization invariance.
An immediate consequence of this fact is that the dynamical system is underdetermined: There are n + 1
dynamical variables but only n independent equations. It follows that a solution (q, t) of (3) is not uniquely
determined by the boundary data, but rather one needs to provide a gauge ﬁxing condition. For instance, one
may impose the equation ˙t(s) = h(s) for some function h and subject this to the boundary condition t(si) = ti.
Then the ﬁrst equation of (3) and the boundary data can be used to determine q.
Evidently this procedure generates a particular solution (qh, th), which depends on the arbitrarily chosen gauge
h and which is therefore by no means unique. Any reparametrization3 of (qh, th) produces an equally valid
solution to the equations of motion for the same boundary data. This means that (q, t) are pure gauge variables
and the equations (3) really determine equivalence classes ([q], [t]) of solutions. A generic solution (q, t) of (3)
per se is therefore physically meaningless.
Notice however that all representatives (q, t) of a given equivalence class ([q], [t]) determine the same correlation
between q and t. That is to say that, at least locally, the arbitrary parameter s can be eliminated and one
obtains the gauge invariant function q(t). This quantity is physically meaningful and we therefore refer to it as
the physical solution.
To conclude this subsection we remark on an esthetic aspect: It would be more appropriate to re-deﬁne the
Lagrangian of the covariant theory to be
L(q(s), ˙q(s), t(s), ˙t(s)) := L(q(s), ˙q(s)/˙t(s), t(s)) ˙t(s).
(7)
This way, the equations of motion take on a more symmetrical form which manifestly treats q and t on the
same footing:
∂L
∂q −d
ds
∂L
∂˙q = 0
∂L
∂t −d
ds
∂L
∂˙t = 0.
(8)
Since the Euler-Lagrange equations are covariant under point transformations of the dynamical variables, this
justiﬁes the use of the term covariant mechanics.
B.
Symmetries and Noether’s Theorem in the covariant Theory
Consider a ﬂow on the extended conﬁguration space.
That is, a one-parameter family of diﬀeomorphisms
φλ : Cext →Cext with (q, t) 7→φλ(q, t) = (χλ(q, t), τ λ(q, t)) for all λ ∈R and the group properties φ0 = id and
φλ ◦φµ = φλ+µ for all λ, µ ∈R. Every ﬂow possesses a generating vector ﬁeld who’s components are given by
(u, v) :=
d
dλ(χλ(q, t), τ λ(q, t))

λ=0
.
(9)
Let (q, t) be a trajectory in P. Then a ﬂow φλ maps this trajectory to (qλ(s), tλ(s)) := φλ(q(s), t(s)). We call
the ﬂow φλ a continuous symmetry of the covariant Lagrangian L if
⇔
L(qλ, ˙qλ, tλ, ˙tλ) −d
dsF(λ, qλ, tλ) = L(q, ˙q, t, ˙t),
(10)
where F is some function of (λ, q, t) with the property F|λ=0 = 0. Notice that such a function can always be
added to the covariant Lagrangian L without altering the equations of motion, provided it does not depend on
the velocities ˙q and ˙t. At this point it is convenient to introduce the conjugate momenta
p := ∂L
∂˙q
and
pt := ∂L
∂˙t ,
(11)
which allow the following concise formulation of Noether’s theorem.
3 A reparametrization can be thought of as a “change of gauge”.

4
Covariant Version of Noether’s Theorem:
If φλ is a continuous symmetry of the covariant Lagrangian L and the trajectory (q, t) satisﬁes the
equations of motion (8), then the quantity
Q = p · u + pt v −d
dλF(λ, qλ, tλ)

λ=0
is conserved along the whole trajectory (q, t). That is to say, dQ
ds = 0 for all s ∈[si, sf].
The conventional form of Noether’s theorem follows from the covariant version stated above when one chooses
the gauge t(s) = s. Moreover, notice that p and pt are gauge invariant quantities and therefore always correspond
to the momentum and (the negative of) the energy of the physical solution.
Proof:
Taking the derivative of Q with respect to s results in

In the second line we made use of the equations of motion (8) expressed in terms of the conjugate
momenta (11) and in the last line we used the symmetry condition (10).

DISCRETE LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM FOR COVARIANT MECHANICS
There are many ways to discretize a continuum theory and some steps require the use of arbitrary prescriptions
which we will now ﬁx. This serves the purpose to have a well-deﬁned framework within which the discrete
version of Noether’s theorem holds.
Consider the ﬁnite set {s0, s1, . . . , sN} ⊂[si, sf] supplemented by the conditions s0 ≡si, sN ≡sf, and si < sj
for i < j. In particular, the elements of this set do not need to be equidistant. Based on this set, deﬁne the
space of discretized trajectories as
DP+ :=

(q, t) : {s0, s1, . . . , sN} →Cext | (q, t) ∈C1(R) and t(sk+1) −t(sk) > 0
	
.
(12)
Notice that to deﬁne the space of trajectories P in the continuum it was suﬃcient to require ˙t ̸= 0. That is
because this condition together with the initial data ti < tf implies forward propagation in t, i.e. ˙t > 0. One
may also choose the initial data such that ti > tf, which would imply ˙t < 0, i.e a backward propagation in t.
To achieve the same in the discrete theory and, more importantly, to exclude certain spurious solutions of
the discrete equations of motion, it is necessary to impose the condition t(sk+1) −t(sk) > 0. For discrete
paths with backward propagation in time one would instead deﬁne a space DP−where the last condition is
replaced by t(sk+1) −t(sk) < 0. In what follows, we do not want to commit ourselves to a particular choice of
“time propagation” and therefore simply write DP, tacitly assuming that either DP+ or DP−has been chosen.
Moreover, we will identify discretized trajectories (q, t) ∈DP with their image and write
(q, t) ≡({q(s0), q(s1), . . . , q(sN)}, {t(s0), t(s1), . . . , t(sN)})
=: ({q0, q1, . . . , qN}, {t0, t1, . . . , tN})
=: ({qk}, {tk}) .
(13)
The last line is a convenient shorthand notation which we will use from now on. We will sometimes visualize
a discretized path as being a collection of vertices in (q, t) space labeled by an integer k, which are connected
by line segments or edges [k, k + 1]. To reﬂect whether a variable is associated with a vertex or a line segment,
we write one index or two indices, respectively. A variable carrying two indices is for example the discretized
tangent vector ( ˙q, ˙t). As derivatives with respect to s are no longer deﬁned, we choose to replace them by ﬁnite
diﬀerence quotients which results in
( ˙q, ˙t)

∆xk−1,k := xk −xk−1.
(14)

The integration measure ds in (1) is not deﬁned either and we choose to replace it by ∆sk−1,k. Taking into
account the deﬁnitions given thus far, consider the discretized action functional SN : DP →R
SN[{qk}, {tk}] :=

(15)
Notice that the evolution parameter s does not appear in the discretized action, as had already been observed
in [12] for the harmonic oscillator and emphasized in [7] for general Lagrangians. This can be taken as a hint
that the discretization did not fully destroy reparametrization invariance. In fact, the continuum theory left
some imprints of gauge invariance which we will discuss in more detail in subsection III A.
As expected, the discretized action functional depends on the whole discretized path ({qk}, {tk}). From the
action we can then easily identify the discretized Lagrangian as
Lk−1,k := Lk−1,k ∆tk−1,k := L

qk−1, ∆qk−1,k
∆tk−1,k
, tk−1

∆tk−1,k.
(16)
Notice that in the continuum the Lagrangian is a function of s for a given choice of trajectory (q, t). As such,
it associates a number to every s ∈[si, sf]. In the discrete theory however, the Lagrangian associates a number
not to a single value sk but to an interval ∆sk−1,k. We may therefore say that the discretized Lagrangian is
associated to line segments [k −1, k] of the discretization.
A.
Discrete Euler-Lagrange Equations
The ﬁrst variation of the discretized action functional can be deﬁned exactly as in the continuum and a straight-
forward computation leads to

terms ∂L

conditions δq0 = δqN = 0 and δt0 = δtN = 0. However, these terms are interesting in their own right and we
will come back to them in the next subsection.
What remains after imposing the boundary conditions and δqSN = δtSN = 0 are the discretized equations of
motion

(18)
At ﬁrst sight these equations do not much resemble the continuum equations (3). This is merely due to our
choice of variables. A form which more closely resembles the continuum equations can be obtained by rewriting
the Lagrangian as
Lk−1,k(qk−1, vk−1,k, tk−1)
with
vk−1,k := ∆qk−1,k
∆tk−1,k
.
(19)

where we used ∂Lk−1,k
∂qk
= ∂Lk−1,k
∂tk
= 0, according to our discretization prescription (see (19)). This is a set of
(n + 1)(N −1) independent equations supplemented by the 2(n + 1) boundary conditions (q0, t0) = (qi, ti) and
(qN, tN) = (qf, tf). This means that, for suitable boundary conditions, the equations (20) completely determine
the (n+1)(N +1) variables ({qk}, {tk}). This is in stark contrast to the continuum where the dynamical system
is underdetermined.
Does this mean that reparametrization invariance is lost in the discrete theory? This depends on what one
means by reparametrization invariance. As we have already seen in equation (15), the discretized action is
independent of the arbitrary evolution parameter sk and does, in this sense, not depend on any particular
parametrization. As a consequence, the discrete equations of motion (20) do not depend on the unphysical
evolution parameter sk either. This means that a solution to these equations does not determine an arbitrarily
parametrized path in Cext. Rather, it directly determines a correlation between the dynamical variables qk and
tk and can therefore be regarded as the discretization of q(t). Hence, the discrete theory directly determines
(an approximation to) the physical solution.
The action’s invariance with respect to reparametrization and the direct construction of the physical solution
are key aspects which are retained in the discretized theory. In fact, the discrete theory does not require us to
specify an arbitrary gauge ﬁxing condition, the discrete equations of motion together with appropriate boundary
conditions are enough to ﬁnd the physical solution. Words like “gauge”, “equivalence classes”, and the like are
absent in the vocabulary of the discrete theory. This means there is a whole lot of mathematical structure which
is simply not needed to deﬁne and apply the discrete theory. In this sense, the discrete theory constitutes a
minimal mathematical model of classical mechanics, lending further support to the ideas of [8, 9].
B.
Conjugate Momenta and Boundary Terms
In the continuum theory the deﬁnition of the conjugate momenta p and pt involves derivatives with respect to ˙q
and ˙t, respectively. Since the dot refers to a total derivative with respect to the parameter s it is not completely
clear how to generalize this prescription to the discrete theory as there is no parameter sk and hence no obvious
discrete analogue of
∂
∂˙q and
∂
∂˙t. However, there is a simple alternative prescription.
Consider a trajectory (q, t) which solves the continuum Euler-Lagrange equations with boundary conditions
(qi, ti) and (qf, tf). It is well-known that for such a trajectory a variation of the Hamilton function with respect
to the end points is, up to a sign, equal to the conjugate momentum p and the energy E = −pt. More precisely
∂S(qi, ti; qf, tf)
∂qi
= −pi
∂S(qi, ti; qf, tf)
∂qf
= pf
∂S(qi, ti; qf, tf)
∂ti
= Ei
∂S(qi, ti; qf, tf)
∂tf
= −Ef,
(21)
where (pi, Ei), (pf, Ef) are the initial and ﬁnal momenta and energies expressed as functions of the initial and
ﬁnal data of the trajectory (q, t). By emulating these equations we can easily deﬁne initial and ﬁnal momenta
for a discretized path. To that end, we use the boundary terms appearing in the variations (17) to deﬁne

∆tN−1,N −LN−1,N.
(22)
Regarding every line segment [k −1, k] of the discretized path ({qk}, {tk}) as a path in its own right allows us
to generalize the above deﬁnition such that we can assign energies and momenta not only to the initial and ﬁnal
vertex, but to all vertices k along the discrete path:
pi
k−1,k := −dLk−1,k
dqk−1
∆tk−1,k

Ef
k−1,k := −dLk−1,k
dtk
∆tk−1,k −Lk−1,k
for k ∈{1, . . . , N}.
(23)
These prescriptions assign to every line segment two energies and two momenta. The line segment connecting
the (k −1)-th and the k-th vertex, for instance, possesses an initial momentum pi
k−1,k and a ﬁnal momentum
pf
k−1,k, see also Figure 1. Since neighboring line segments share a vertex, these prescriptions also associate two
momenta and two energies to each vertex. The k-th vertex, for example, possesses the momenta pf
k−1,k and
pi
k,k+1 and the energies Ef
k−1,k and Ei
k,k+1. At ﬁrst sight this seems to be inconsistent and indeed it might be
inconsistent for unphysical discrete trajectories. However, there is no problem for paths ({qk}, {tk}) which solve

(24)
Hence, on physical trajectories the deﬁnitions (23) unambiguously associate one momentum and one energy to
every vertex, see also Figure 2. Unphysical trajectories, on the other hand, are characterized by discontinuous
behavior of the discrete energies and momenta at the vertices. The simple form (24) of the equations of motion
is also exactly what we need to prove a discrete version of Noether’s theorem.
C.
Discrete Version of Noether’s Theorem
The same ﬂow φλ : Cext →Cext as in the continuum theory (see subsection II B) obeying the same group
properties and possessing the same generating vector ﬁeld can be applied in the discrete theory to transform
the conﬁguration space variables (q, t) to (χλ(q, t), τ λ(q, t)). The only diﬀerence is how we denote the ﬂow’s
action on trajectories:

We call φλ a continuous symmetry of Lk−1,k∆tk−1,k if, for all λ ∈R and for all vertices k, the transformed
Lagrangian satisﬁes the condition

The second line in (28) renders the proof of Noether’s theorem particularly simple which in the discrete covariant
theory can be stated as follows.
4 Notice that we can always add (Fk −Fk−1) to Lk−1,k∆tk−1,k without altering the discrete equations of motion as this only
produces boundary terms which vanish due to the boundary conditions.

Discrete Version of Noether’s Theorem:
If φλ is a continuous symmetry of Lk−1,k∆tk−1,k and the trajectory ({qk}, {tk}) satisﬁes the discrete
equations of motion (24), then the quantity
Qk−1,k = pf
k−1,k · uk −Ef
k−1,k vk −d
dλFk

λ=0
is conserved along the whole trajectory ({qk}, {tk}).
That is to say, Qk−1,k = Qk,k+1 for all k ∈
{1, . . . , N −1}.
Notice that the deﬁnition of Qk−1,k given above seems to depend on the choice of vertex. Energy, momentum,
the vector ﬁeld (u, v) and the function F are all evaluated at (qk, tk). Hence it seems that Qk−1,k is associated
to the vertex k and should, consistent with the notation used so far, carry a superscript f. However, Qk−1,k
is really associated to the whole line segment [k −1, k] and not to a particular vertex. To see this, rename the
above quantity Qf
k−1,k and deﬁne
Qi
k−1,k := pi
k−1,k · uk−1 −Ei
k−1,k vk−1 −d
dλFk−1

λ=0
,
(29)
which is seemingly associated to the vertex k −1. It is easy to show, using solely the symmetry condition (28),
that Qi
k−1,k = Qf
k−1,k and hence the deﬁnition of Qk−1,k does not depend on the choice of vertex. If on top of
the symmetry condition also the equations of motion are satisﬁed, then Qk−1,k has the same value on all line
segments of the discretized trajectory. This is the content of the theorem stated above which we will now prove.
Proof:
A straightforward computation yields
Qk−1,k = pf
k−1,k · uk −Ef
k−1,k vk −d

The ﬁrst line is just the deﬁnition of Qk−1,k. In the second line we used the equations of motion (24)
and in the third line we made use of the symmetry condition (28).
It follows by induction that
Qk−1,k = Qk,k+1 for all k ∈{1, . . . , N −1}.
■
It is interesting to remark that the theorem we just proved only holds in the discretized covariant theory. One
can try to prove the same theorem starting from a discretization of the more familiar non-covariant continuum
theory and indeed it has been shown in [10, 11] that it is possible to obtain a special case of Noether’s theorem
within this framework. However, the temporal variables are chosen such that tk+1 −tk = ϵ for all k and the
diﬀeomorphisms are only allowed to act on the spatial variables {qk}. Furthermore, any attempt to include ﬂows
acting on the {tk} variables is bound to fail. The reason is that while it is possible to formulate an appropriate
symmetry condition, it is not possible to relate energies between line segments sharing a vertex. In fact, the
best one can do is to prove that the energy at the vertex k computed from the left line segment is equal to the
energy computed from the right line segment up to an unknown integration “constant” which depends on some
of the qk and tk variables. Hence, in general there is a discontinuity between the energies and therefore energy
cannot be a conserved quantity.
This can ultimately be traced back to the fact that in the non-covariant approach the {tk} variables are chosen
by hand and they are also subjected to the condition5 tk+1 −tk = ϵ. It is easy to see that this choice does not
aﬀect the equations of motion (18) resulting from the qk variation and therefore momentum conservation can
be proven as it has been in [10, 11] . However, this choice invalidates the equations of motion (18) derived from
the tk variation because they depend on a correct “choice” of ∆tk−1,k and ∆tk,k+1. Hence, there is no hope for
energy to be conserved and this also explains why the methods of [10, 11] fail in the general case.
A diﬀerent situation presents itself in the discretized covariant theory. There, the spatial as well as the temporal
variables are dynamical entities which are completely determined by the equations of motion. The dynamics
is such that energies and momenta between shared vertices are related in the right way to make conserved
quantities emerge.
We illustrate this by applying the discrete Noether theorem to a few well-known examples.
5 Without this condition, conservation of momentum would also be violated.

Examples: Galilean Transformations
To illustrate the main result of this paper, we consider a covariant Lagrangian of the form
Lk−1,k = m
2
(∆qk−1,k)2
∆tk−1,k
−V ∆tk−1,k,
(30)
where qk ∈R3. The potential V is not further speciﬁed, but it is assumed to be invariant (on a case by case
basis) under the ﬂows considered below and it may not only depend on qk−1 but also on vk−1,k, as it does for
example for a particle in a magnetic ﬁeld. We can then show that Galilean transformations are symmetries of
this mechanical system and the conserved quantities are the discrete analogues of the quantities found in the
continuum theory.
Translations in space:
The ﬂow φλ acts only on the position variables as qk →χλ
k = qk + λa for some a ∈R3. The generating vector
ﬁeld is given by (uk, vk) = (a, 0) and the corresponding conserved quantity is, as had to be expected, the
conjugate momentum: Qk−1,k = pf
k−1,k · a = pi
k−1,k · a.
Translations in time:
Now the ﬂow acts only on the time variables as tk →τ λ
k = tk + λa, for some a ∈R. The generating vector ﬁeld
reads (uk, vk) = (0, a) and the conserved quantity is, of course, the energy: Qk−1,k = −Ef
k−1,k a = −Ei
k−1,k a.
Rotations:
Let φλ act on the spatial variables as qk →χλ
k = Re(λ)qk, where Re(λ) ∈SO(3) is a rotation around the axis
e by an angle λ. The corresponding generating vector ﬁeld is (uk, vk) = (e × qk, 0), which yields the conserved
quantity Qk−1,k = pf
k−1,k · (e × qk) = e · (pf
k−1,k × qk) = e · (pi
k−1,k × qk−1). This is just the discrete analogue of
angular momentum.
Galilean boosts:
A boost acts on the spatial variables as qk →χλ
k = qk + λvtk, where v ∈R3 is some constant velocity. This
transformation does not leave the Lagrangian (30) invariant. Instead it leads to
Lλ
k−1,k∆tk−1,k = m

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
Noether’s theorem plays undeniably an important role in the discussion of mechanical systems. Here we showed
that this powerful tool is also accessible for discretized mechanical systems, provided one starts from a covariant
formulation of mechanics. In such a formulation, spatial and temporal variables (q, t) are both dynamical and
they are treated on an equal footing. Unlike in the continuum theory, however, the discretized equations of
motion do not determine equivalence classes of solutions ([q], [t]), but rather they explicitly determine all the
variables ({qk}, {tk}) and thereby directly determine an approximation to the physical solution q(t). In the
discrete covariant theory there is no need to talk about gauges or introduce arbitrary gauge ﬁxing conditions.
The absence of this mathematical structure, which in the continuum is ultimately only needed to deal with
mathematical redundancy, can be taken as a sign that the discrete theory provides us with a minimal math-
ematical model of classical mechanics. This complements the ideas and observations of [8, 9] that the ﬁeld
theories of fundamental physics expressed in a discretized language need less structure for their deﬁnition than
their continuum counterparts.
We have also seen that the dynamical determination of (qk, tk) is also exactly what enables us to formulate a
discrete version of Noether’s theorem which is completely analogous to the well-known continuum version. More
traditional discretizations of mechanical systems, such as the ones used in [10, 11], only allow for special cases of
Noether’s theorem. In particular, as we showed here, the special cases discussed in [10, 11] exclude conservation
of energy because ﬁxing the tk variables by hand is tantamount to making the energy behave discontinuously
on vertices of the discretized path. That a dynamical determination of the tk variables can lead to conservation
of energy was ﬁrst observed by [12] in the study of the harmonic oscillator. The results presented here extend
and clarify this observation in a broader context.

What we omitted here is to show how the discrete Noether theorem can be used to develop an algorithm to solve
the discrete equations of motions in a way which renders transparent how the solutions depend on conserved
quantities. Such an algorithm would bring further theoretical applications of the discrete covariant theory into
reach. However, before that, important questions concerning the precise conditions under which solutions to
the discrete equations of motion exist need to be answered.

Appendix A: From Covariant Mechanics to Maupertuis’s Principle
Maupertuis’s principle dates back to the 18th century and in its modern formulation it states that the conﬁg-
uration space trajectory q(s) ⊂C of constant energy which connects qi to qf can be found as the stationary
point of the abbreviated action functional
S0[q] :=
Z sf
si
p · dq.
(A1)
The parameter s used to parametrize the trajectory q is arbitrary and the abbreviated action is in fact
reparametrization invariant. It is usually assumed that the system also admits a Lagrangian description and
that the Lagrangian has the form
L = 1
2gab(q) ˙qa ˙qb −V (q),
(A2)
where gab is a Riemannian metric which only depends on q and summation over repeated indices is implied.
The variational principle can then be reformulated as
δqS0[q] ≡δq
Z sf
si
p
2(E −V (q)) dl = 0,
(A3)
where E denotes the constant energy of the trajectory and
dl2 = 1
2gab(q) dqadqb
(A4)
is the line element associated with the Riemannian manifold (C, gab). This variational principle follows easily, in
a slightly more general form, from the covariant language used in section II. To see this, assume the Lagrangian
is given by (A2), with ˙q replaced by ˙q/˙t, and then take the variation of the covariant action functional (1)
with respect to t. As the Lagrangian is time-independent, the resulting equation of motion simply expresses
conservation of energy and it can be integrated to
1
2gab(q) ˙qa
˙t
˙qb
˙t + V (q) = E.
(A5)
Solving for ˙t and choosing the positive square root (the choice of sign does not really matter due to Newtonian
mechanic’s invariance under time inversion) yields
˙t =
s
gab(q) ˙qa ˙qb
2(E −V (q)).
(A6)
Substituting this expression back into the action functional results in
S[q] =
Z sf
si
p
2(E −V (q)) dl −(tf −ti)E.
(A7)
A variation of this action with respect to q yields exactly the same equations of motion as Maupertuis’s principle.
However, while Maupertuis’s principle only determines the shape of the trajectory, i.e. q(s), in our approach
we can also determine the correlation q(t). To that end, vary the action (A7) with respect to E and set the
variation to zero. This results in
t(s) = ti +
Z s
si
dl
p
2(E −V (q))
,
(A8)
with s ∈[si, sf]. This is simply equation (A6) in integral form and it allows us, in principle, to determine q(t).
