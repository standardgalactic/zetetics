Abstract
Cognitive and unnatural approaches to literature take very different stances
on the issue of fictionality. While cognitive approaches consider everyday nonfictional
and literary fictional narratives to highlight their similarities, unnatural approaches to
narrative stress the exceptionality of the fictional. This article investigates disagreements
and potential points of mutual interest in a dialogue between Henrik Skov Nielsen,
representing unnatural narratology, and Karin Kukkonen, representing second-
generation cognitive narratology. The dialogue develops through close readings of
Ian McEwan’s On Chesil Beach and Hilary Mantel’s Beyond Black. In a first step, Nielsen
defines fictionality for unnatural approaches to fiction as “invention.” Kukkonen
argues that there are many mental operations that qualify as invented, such as thought
experiments and flights of the imagination, but that do not yet amount to fiction. To
arrive at a cognitive definition of fictionality, she proposes to revisit Wolfgang Iser’s
notion of fiction as an “articulated gestalt” in the light of recent embodied and pre-
dictive approaches. In a second step, we discuss the so-called exceptionality thesis. The
issue at stake here is whether fictional texts are fundamentally dependent on our
general cognitive capacities (a position traditionally held by cognitive narratology) or
fundamentally depart from everyday modes of thinking. We revisit the debate in light
of the unnatural definition of fictionality as invention and the cognitive perspectives

Cognitive and unnatural narratology have approached issues of fictionality
largely independently of each other. For unnatural narratology, represented
in this essay by Henrik Skov Nielsen, fictionality has been something of a sine
qua non, while for cognitive narratology, represented here by Karin Kukko-
nen, the main interest lay in cognitive processes considered the same across
fictional and everyday narrative. In what follows, a debate unfolds around
two questions: (1) the different ways in which unnatural and cognitive nar-
ratology define fictionality and delimit its reach and (2) the degree to which
the fictional can be regarded as exceptional. The novels Beyond Black (2005) by
Hilary Mantel and On Chesil Beach (2008) by Ian McEwan serve as the basis for
a discussion from both perspectives.
1. What Is Fictionality?
The fundamental question of the nature of fictionality introduces the differ-
ent takes on the topic for unnatural and cognitive narratology.
1.1. Unnatural Narratology on Fictionality
From the perspective of Nielsen’s position within unnatural narratology, the
main point about fictional discourse is extremely simple: fictional discourse
invents and should not be treated as if it does not.1 In the article “Natural
1. There are many different positions among unnatural narratologists with different inclina-
tions and interests. The main positions are represented by Jan Alber, Stefan Iversen, Maria
Ma¨kela¨, and Brian Richardson, who have all used unnatural narratology as an umbrella term to
cover all sorts of responses to what was perceived as cognitive narratology’s move toward a
unified theory. A basic assumption of such a united theory would be that all narratives were
assumed to be natural narrative and adhere to the rules of face-to-face conversational story-
telling. Today the approaches associated with unnatural narratology are scattered across a
theoretical spectrum ranging from Richardson, explicitly and emphatically equating the unnat-
ural with the antimimetic, via Alber’s procognitive stance toward the unnatural (Alber 2014),
to Iversen’s (2016) and Nielsen’s (2013) attempt to align (without equating) theories about
unnatural narratives and fictionality. This latter approach to unnatural narratives contends
that fictionality has to do with invention and therefore does not necessarily result in but does
allow for transgression of the limitations of noninventive discourse. In this perspective the
naturalizing reading strategy is an active choice and often not a very appropriate one, and
not at all a necessary one. Moreover, from the same perspective, Richardson is seen to have
inherited an unfortunate dichotomy between (overt) fictionality and realism, when he states
that realist works mimic nonfictional discourse.

Authors, Unnatural Narratives” (2010), Nielsen argues that standard narra-
tological models of the relationship between narrator and author naturalize
the understanding of fictional narratives and of fictionality, in the sense that
fictional narratives are understood along the lines of everyday reports: a nar-
rator supposedly reports what he or she “knows.” This naturalizing assump-
tion neglects the huge difference between the constraints narratorial agents
are under when they are reporting and when they are inventing. From an
unnatural perspective, readers can more easily account for the undisguised
inventions and transgressions of reportive language that frequently occur
throughout literary history by acknowledging this difference. When tech-
niques of fictionality are employed (e.g., zero focalization in the era of the
realist novel), these phenomena cannot helpfully be explained by assuming
the existence of a narrator distinct from the author.2 Instead, they are tech-
niques at the disposal of an inventing author, not of a narrator modeled on
everyday noninventive, reporting language. This is an issue that concerns
contextual interpretation rather than the ontology of the alleged storyworld.
It makes a large difference for interpretation if readers allow themselves to
think of a narrative as overtly made up.3 Literary theorists should emphasize
rather than downplay or obliterate the difference between reading with the
assumption that the story is offered as invented (fiction) and reading with the
assumption that the story is offered as reported (nonfiction). This understand-
ing then logically leads to a choice between interpretations that is quite
consequential: if we assume that a story is reported, we will make inferences
about the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the assertions, including assertions
about minds, thoughts, events, and characters. By contrast, from an unna-
tural perspective reading a story as invented means that some questions
(about mnemonic overkill, access to knowledge, telepathy, and mind-reading
skills) do not and should not surface because they are pertinent only in non-
invented contexts, whereas others, such as the design and intention of inven-
tion acquire new importance. This becomes quite relevant in the reading and
discussion of On Chesil Beach below.
This strand of unnatural narratology, which insists on the differential
nature of invented narratives, is also quite explicitly and self-avowedly op-
posed to cognitive approaches’ neglect of, and indifference to, what is specif-
2. Such signposts are conceived of not as ontological but as culturally and historically variable.
Moreover, they do not determine a generic relationship but point to the communicative strat-
egy of invention.

intent entails an attitude toward the communicated information that is different from attitudes
toward nonfictive discourse.”

ically fictional about literary and fictional narratives—a neglect that seems to
a high degree to persist in second-generation approaches.
Kukkonenand Caracciolooutline the distinction betweenfirst- and second-
generation approaches:
“First-generation” theories in the cognitive sciences conceive of the mind as based
on abstract, propositional representations. Like a computer, the first-generation
mind would process information as largely independent from specific brains,
bodies, and sensory modalities. By contrast, “second-generation” approaches—
a term coined by Lakoff and Johnson (Philosophy 77– 78) — reject previous models
of the mind as unduly limited to information processing, placing mental pro-
cesses instead on a continuum with bioevolutionary phenomena and cultural prac-
tices. We treat “second-generation cognitive science” as interchangeable with
another, more technical-sounding label used by cognitive scientists — that of
“e-approaches” to cognition (Menary; Hutto). Here the e’s stand for theories
bringing to the fore the enactive, embedded, embodied, and extended qualities
of the mind. To this list we may add “experiential” and “emotional,” since this new
paradigm gives experience and emotional responses a much more important role
in cognition than first-wave, computational cognitivism. (2014: 261)
Second-generation approaches present a fundamentally different model
of the mind. Nevertheless, what the two generations’ approaches have in
common is that they are both above all theories about the mind, and not spe-
cifically about texts or art or fiction. The authors go on to say: “The second-
generation cognitive sciences have provoked a profound reorientation of
thinking about the mind, the body, and their relationship to natural and
cultural environments. We believe that they also have the potential to give
cognitive literary study a new direction. This collection of essays, then, is
intended as a starting point for building a coherent cognitive approach to
literature on the basis of the second-generation framework” (ibid. 268). What
has changed is the understanding of mind, not the assumption of a corre-
spondence between real and fictional minds. A new understanding of real
minds and real bodies is assumed to have new explanatory power because the
fictional minds and bodies are assumed to behave according to our (new)
knowledge about real ones.
This seems from an unnatural perspective to limit the value of the frame-
work specifically for the study of fiction in two respects. First, the assumption
that fictional minds are like real minds and can be understood and analyzed
accordingly is at work in both first-generation and second-generation
approaches, as is, more generally, the assumptions that fictional characters
are like real characters and, more general still, that fiction is like nonfiction.
Emily Troscianko’s 2014 article in the special issue of Style on second-gener-
ation approaches is paradigmatic in this respect. As her title—“First-Person

and Second Generation Perspectives on Starvation on Kafka’s ‘Ein Hunger-
ku¨nstler’”—already indicates, Troscianko is very concerned with half of
what Kafka’s own title denotes—starvation—and relatively little with the
other half: art. A passage like the following is telling: “So, if we ask whether
the story can be considered a cognitively realistic evocation of total star-
vation, what can we conclude? The absence of hunger is now explained,
but other absences arise to take its place” (355). Fiction is measured with
reality’s ruler, and it hardly makes any difference to the interpretation that
this is not a report about an actual, living, starving person but a piece of
fiction. This perspective is certainly not illegitimate, and Troscianko makes
valid points about not imposing values such as glory, purity and beauty on
starvation, yet the interpretation would arguably be strengthened if the
author considered the role and purpose of the invented as a whole rather
than being content with examining the degree to which it is “cognitively
realistic” (ibid.).
Second, the conclusions arrived at by means of these protocols for inter-
pretation often seem from an unnatural point of view unsurprising and
unspectacular (indeed, bordering on the trivial) because they often run the
risk of stating what is immediately clear to any even remotely competent
reader. Examples include Kukkonen and Caracciolo’s (2014) statements
that bodily signs of fear and disgust point to those feelings in a character in
the text, or that we understand emotions because we are familiar with them
through vicarious or lived experience. For example, I find it hard to see the
added analytical value of a passage like the following:
What happens here can be understood in terms of what Lawrence Barsalou calls
“situated conceptualization.” In Barsalou’s second-generation account, concepts
work as “instruction manuals”; we grasp their meaning by experiencing them —
vicariously — in concrete situations of action and interaction. The notion of
“benevolence,” for example, can activate experiential traces of someone being
benevolent to us, or it can bring forth instances of benevolence in cultural memory
(e.g., anecdotes of generous rulers), which also unfold through interactions that
situate and exemplify the concept. (ibid.: 266)
The passage, in my opinion, comes dangerously close to saying that we
understand the concept because we know what it means, which is not yet
interpretation.
1.2. Second-Generation Cognitive Approaches to Fictionality
Ellen Spolsky claims in Contracts of Fiction (2015: xv) that accounts that deal
with the ubiquity and power of fiction are “not in short supply” in cognitive
literary study, and she is quite right. However, even though cognitive narra-

tology discusses predominantly fictional texts, the approach usually does not
dwell on the specificity of fiction. Alan Palmer in Fictional Minds (2004) and
Lisa Zunshine in Why We Read Fiction (2006) offer no explicit theorization
about how the fictional quality of the texts they engage with affects cognitive
processes differently from nonfictional texts. Monika Fludernik in Toward a
“Natural” Narratology (1996: 43) discusses the issue of fictionality in some detail
but concludes that “the basic dichotomy for my model is that between the
narrative and the non-narrative” rather than between the fictional and the
nonfictional. Indeed, “within the frame of ‘natural narratology’ the term
fictional can be dispensed with” (ibid.). For her, fictionality and narrativity
amount to the same thing if one does not confine fictionality “to the tra-
ditional sense of the non-historical and the a-referential” but rather brings to
the fore its fundamentally constructed nature (ibid.: 42). In his introduction to
Storytelling and the Sciences of Mind (2013), David Herman insists that readers of
literary fiction do not use different sets of cognitive processes and interpre-
tational protocols from those used by participants in conversations or readers
of newspapers. All four of these narratologists underline the continuities
between everyday, conversational and literary, fictional uses of narrative,
as well as the degree to which narrative patterns of mind-reading (in the
case of Zunshine and Palmer), narrativization (in the case of Fludernik), and
canonicity and breach (in the case of Herman) correlate with what we are
likely to find in fiction.
This does not mean that cognitive approaches have no handle on the dif-
ference between fiction and nonfiction. Often, a distinction is made between
“on-line” and “off-line” processing when it comes to the difference between
the cognition of factual or fictional texts. Fiction is always processed off-line;
that is, it involves everyday cognitive capacities but uses them without any
feedback into our everyday cognition. Jean-Marie Schaeffer (2010) speaks of
a reader’s involvement with the “brakes” on, drawing on the capacities for
simulation that we use to make sense of real situations but without leading us
to act on them as if they were real. Zunshine refers to work by Tooby and
Cosmides, suggesting that fiction provides a “source tag” for the narratives
that we read that prevents us from integrating Little Red Riding Hood into
our understanding of the real world (2006: 66). However, it has also been
suggested that cognitive processes that work off-line in the context of fiction
might have very real effects; for instance, Kidd and Castano, in “Reading
Literary Fiction Improves Theory of Mind” (2013), propose that literary fic-
tion exercises our cognitive capacities. While the question of whether the
increased capacities that follow such workouts can be immediately applied in
the everyday needs to be approached with care (see Zunshine 2006: 125),

textual strategies associated with literary fiction, such as changes in perspec-
tive, are related cognitive capacities.
Cognitive literary narratology assumes a fundamental continuity between
cognitive processes in everyday contexts and cognitive processes in fictional
contexts. As illustrated by the online/offline model, this does not mean that it
would have nothing to say about fiction. We can begin to say even more once
we relinquish the traditional understanding of cognition as the processing of
propositional information. After all, what we imagine, simulate and project
already feeds into everyday cognition, and different modes of attentive and
mind-wandering thought feed into one another in complex ways while read-
ing fiction. Invention as a criterion for fictionality does not begin to cover the
complexities revealed once we take these cognitive aspects into account.
Recent research in psychology and the neurosciences places the made-up,
the imaginative and the virtual center stage in human cognition. Paul Harris,
in The Work of the Imagination (2000), stresses that games and encounters based
on mutual pretense are crucial for children’s social, intellectual, and emotion-
al development. The games of make-believe that underlie Kendall Walton’s
(1990) notion of artistic mimesis and Jean-Marie Schaeffer’s (2010) notion of
the “fictional competence” of literary readers are by no means tied exclu-
sively to literary narratives but serve vital developmental roles long before
children even learn to read. Lionel Naccache, in Le Nouvel Inconscient (2006),
proposes that human consciousness is kept coherent through inventiveness
that provides ad hoc explanations for our actions. Finally, research on the so-
called default mode network suggests that our minds spontaneously wander
into projection of the past and imagination of the future when they are not
forced to attend to a particular task (see Raichle 2015; Richardson 2011). The
human capacity to invent, to imagine, and to project past, present, and future
feeds into everyday cognition just as much as into fiction, and they are by
themselves not enough to distinguish fictionality.
Invention does not render any of my mental constructions, be they day-
dreams, imaginations, or thought experiments, fictional. Given the wealth of
material on these modes of cognition (which are often tagged fictional, fictive,
etc., in the scientific literature itself ), some conceptual clarification is called
for. Let us go back to a key work by one of the scholars who can be considered
a precursor of cognitive literary study: Wolfgang Iser’s The Fictive and the
Imaginary (1993). Instead of the binary opposition between the fictional and
the real, Iser proposes the triad of the real (what is given in the world), the
imaginary (what we can imagine, virtually, about it), and the fictional (what,
both real and imaginary, has been given a particular form in literature). The
fictional emerges from what Iser calls “acts of fictionalization” that release the
real from its referential constraints and that give coherence to the unformed

imaginary. Mantel’s novel Beyond Black might serve as an example for such an
act of fictionalization. Here historical events like the death of Princess Diana,
the domestic dreams of middle-class Britain, and ghostly voices from the
beyond merge into the narrative. The novel ends on the words, “This cake
we are having: could we have it iced?” (2005: 451). It is not clear at all whether
these words are uttered by a figment of the protagonist Alison’s imagina-
tion, her new-found spirit guide, or an actual elderly lady sitting in her car.
Throughout the novel, Mantel suspends readers in her “act of fictionaliza-
tion” between what corresponds to the real (Alison’s childhood as traumatic
or her mind as deranged) and what corresponds to the imaginative (Alison as
a psychic who truly interacts with the spirit world), so that “this cake we are
having: could we have it iced?” turns out to be the perfect expression of the
ambiguity that shapes the design of the novel.
With second-generation cognitive approaches, Mantel’s merging of the
real and the imaginary can be traced from the conceptual to the resonances
that underlie her embodied use of language (see Kukkonen and Caracciolo
2014). The boundaries of Alison’s body seem fluid throughout Beyond Black.
When her friend Colette shakes out her skirt at the beginning of the novel, “as
she turned it the right way out, she felt a tiny stir of disgust, as if flesh might be
clinging to the seams” (Mantel 2005: 3). Alison seems to expand into the world
with her corpulent self, her smell and the skin-colored “silk” that she has
draped around her promotional portrait. Her trauma is closely connected
to the scars that mark her thighs, and time and again she feels the need to
expand bodily in order to “house” the many voices and spirits that haunt
her. Colette’s attempt to control her expresses itself most clearly in her put-
ting Alison on a diet. While some of these embodied aspects of the novel are
clearly meant to be the case in the fictional world, others are a figment of the
characters’ imagination, and yet others hover somewhere in between. Man-
tel’s novel links these different modes of embodiment. The “extra synthetic
skin” of Alison’s silk scarf (ibid.: 175) on the studio portrait protects her from
the penetrating gaze of her patrons just as her skin protects her body, and it
envelops Alison’s fragile self just as much as the skin on which her brutal
upbringing left its mark.
The imaginary and the real are made to bleed into each other in subtle
ways in Beyond Black, demonstrating that acts of fictionalization can be easily
extended beyond the merging of historical and imagined events and char-
acters. The strange perception that “flesh might be clinging to the seams” of
Alison’s clothing may serve as an illustration. “Flesh” with its associations
of the sticky, bloody matter of the human body and of the biblical dimension
of temptations to be resisted, is what Colette wants to shake off from the cloth-
ing that works as a kind of protective gear for Alison. Even though there is no

actual flesh involved, this is a matter of embodied cognition. Readers might
catch a slight echo of Colette’s “tiny stir of disgust” thought their embodied
meaning-making of the text. Tracing these instances across different levels of
embodied language, metaphors, and cultural regimes of the body, reveals a
complex situated conceptualization.
If Nielsen’s discussion of “situated conceptualization” (see above) had
included the complete passage we wrote about how “benevolence” is concep-
tualized in the scene from Fielding’s Tom Jones we discussed, it would have
revealed similarly complex layers of embodied and cultural inferences and
interpretations. Here Henry Fielding integrates, in what would be an “act of
fictionalization,” Squire Allworthy’s character, his movements through the
well-managed estate, the rising sun, and its metaphorical “goodness.” Situ-
ated conceptualizations that arise from acts of fictionalization are intricate
environments of human thought, not trivialities. The situated conceptu-
alization of Alison’s suspension between reaching out into the world and
protecting herself from its aggressions extends across different aspects of
embodiment in the text. The conceptualization emerges from the embodied
textual details that become available through the analysis of the sticky quality
of flesh and skin that bleeds, through thematic instances of skin, silk, and scars
in Beyond Black, through the invitation to hesitate over whether what is
described can be understood as material or delusory, and eventually, through
the propositional implications of the final sentence of the novel. It would be
beside the point here, I argue, to look for the moment when Mantel asks
readers to switch between different protocols of interpretation connected to
the real or the imaginary. Instead, Mantel transforms elements that corre-
spond to the real world and elements that draw on virtual imaginings, nar-
rative configurations, and other cognitive processes into a piece of fiction that
transcends them. Invention is only a very small part of this process.
2. How Exceptional Is Fiction?
The point is well taken, from an unnatural perspective, that we should not
conflate the imagined and the constructed with the fictional and that we
should avoid the tendency to oppose the fictional to the real. Similarly, it
seems fruitful to consider the ways in which historical elements such as the
death of Princess Diana tie in with depiction of the domestic dreams of
middle-class Britain. It is quite true that “it would be beside the point . . . to
look for the moment at which Mantel asks readers to switch between different
protocols of interpretation connected to the real or the imaginary.” It would
not, however, be beside the point to distinguish between fact and fiction
because the novel as a whole is overtly invented. We are inside that recog-

nized invention, and our recognition of that fact shapes and contextualizes
our entire experience. So whether or not invention is considered a small or
large part of the process, it is its very governing principle. Interpretation
based on the assumption of invention does not apply at a specific moment
but overall. It is certainly true that readers cannot be content with stopping at
declaring that the novel is fictional and invented, but the fact that it is not
sufficient to do so should not lead to the conclusion that it is not necessary. It
verges on non sequitur to assume that “Mantel does not ask readers to switch
between different protocols of interpretation connected to the real or to the
imaginary.” True, we don’t switch back and forth, from line to line, and from
section to section in a futile attempt to distinguish, within the novel, between
the real and the imaginary. This, however, does not change the fact—but,
rather, is actually contingent upon it—that we read the novel as a whole as
globally invented, and that Mantel does ask us to do so. The rhetorical
approach to unnatural narratology, which Nielsen generally reflects, assumes
that readers and receivers inevitably make assumptions about the invented
or noninvented nature of narratives and that authors and senders strongly
expect them to. Testimonies are one case in which the absence of any inten-
tional invention is a strong default expectation. Discussions about hoaxes also
strongly attest to the fact that we do make such assumptions and feel guided
to do so.
A second-generation cognitive approach, which underlies Kukkonen’s
argument, would insist that Nielsen jumps too quickly from testimonies and
hoaxes to fiction here. From Kukkonen’s perspective, the engagement with
fiction depends on the particular textual design enabled by acts of fictional-
ization. Such textual design lends a global coherence to the text, but the
account of fiction that emerges from it cannot be satisfyingly defined through
“invention” and its (posited) interpretive protocols, since these also apply to
imaginary activities more generally. Fiction would then be a specific, text-
based transformation of the everyday thought processes connected to the real
(or noninvented) and the imaginary (or invented). At this point, it might be
worth reexamining the suggestion that unnatural narratology considers fic-
tional mind in texts as exceptional and that cognitive narratology considers
them as parallel to the everyday (see Herman 2011). After all, invention, as we
have seen, is an everyday cognitive process.
2.1. Unnatural Narratology on the Exceptionality Thesis
Invention, in the unnatural perspective outlined above, is essential to fiction
and to fictional discourse in general. This does not in and of itself make
fictional discourse unnatural, of course. Fictional discourse becomes unnat-
ural when it transgresses the limits naturally associated with nonfictional

discourse. This transgression does not happen in all fictional discourse, but
it is also not limited to overtly antimimetic narratives. In the following we
examine the consequences of this in the fairly realist, nonexperimental novel,
On Chesil Beach.
In the introduction to his Emergence of Mind (2011), David Herman develops
an extensive refutation of what he calls the exceptionality thesis. He directly
connects this thesis to the question of unnatural narratology and to theorists
like Jan Alber, Maria Ma¨kela¨, Brian Richardson, and Nielsen (2011: 11).
Herman goes as far as to enroll all the contributors to Emergence of Mind in the
quest for similarity between fiction and nonfiction when he states that “the
questioning of the Exceptionality Thesis is in a sense the starting point for all
the approaches to fictional minds outlined by the chapters in this volume”
(ibid.: 18). Herman refers to almost every contributor in the volume as “anti-
exceptionalist” (ibid.: 20, 21, 22). What, then, is the exceptionality thesis?
The exceptionality thesis posits that we approach fiction and nonfiction
by means of different protocols for reasoning and with different interpretive
strategies and that, for example, “readers’ experiences of fictional minds are
different in kind from their experiences of the minds they encounter outside
the domain of narrative fiction” (ibid.: 8). This is the “thesis against which I
think this volume militates,” writes Herman (ibid.: 32). He goes on: “Granted,
fictional narratives have the power to stipulate as true reports about char-
acters’ mind-contents. But the onus is on Exceptionalists to demonstrate that
readers have to use different interpretive protocols to make sense of such
stipulated mental states and dispositions, in comparison with the protocols
they use for construing actual minds” (ibid.: 33). The rest of this section is
about conflicting views on this issue and possible ways to mitigate them. In
fact the text Herman himself chooses, Ian McEwan’s On Chesil Beach (2008),
seems to Nielsen an excellent illustration of the degree to which it might be
profitable to use different interpretive protocols when the mind-content of
characters (other than that of a character narrator herself/himself) are
rendered.4
If parts of unnatural narratology build on an exceptionality thesis, it is
equally clear that Herman subscribes to a similarity thesis: “Encounters with
fictional minds are mediated by the same heuristics used to interpret every-
day minds” (2011: 18).5 Similarly, along the same lines of imposing natural-
ization as a necessary human reading strategy, which unnatural narratology
questions, Fludernik famously stated in her canonical cognitively oriented

text, “When readers read narrative texts, they project real-life parameters
into the reading process and, if at all possible, treat the text as a real-life
instance of narrating” (2011: 623). From an unnatural point of view, this is not
true at all. The main objection is that treating fictional texts as real-life
instances of narrating is a choice, not a necessity. Many readers will change
interpretational strategies when assuming that they are invited to read some-
thing as fictionalized. It is an available option to interpret the narrative as
inventing in the sense of being unrestricted by referentiality, indexicality,
or truth.
McEwan’s novel On Chesil Beach is one of three literary examples—the
other two are Middlemarch and Tom Jones—quoted and discussed by Herman
in order to roughly track some of the developments in the representation
of minds over the centuries. Herman himself summarizes his diachronic
findings: “To synopsize: passage A [from Tom Jones] reveals considerable
variation in the degree to which parts of the narration are grounded in
characters’ perceptions and evaluations; passage B [from Middlemarch ], less
variation on this score; and passage C [from On Chesil Beach ], even wider
variation than A when it comes to shifts in the degree to which reports are tied
to characters’ standpoints” (Herman 2011: 29). Curiously, there is no explicit,
or even implicit, correlation between the use to which these examples are put
and the findings and tentative conclusions drawn from them, here at the end
of Herman’s introduction, and the strong claims about fictional minds made
in the course of the introduction’s preceding eighteen pages. These claims
culminate in Herman’s identification of his “larger point”: “But my larger
point is that what I have termed the Exceptionality Thesis can be questioned
from two directions: on the one hand, by arguing that encounters with fic-
tional minds are mediated by the same heuristics used to interpret everyday
minds (call this the Mediation argument); on the other hand, by arguing that
everyday minds can be experienced in ways that the Cartesian premises of
commentators like [Ka¨te] Hamburger and [Dorrit] Cohn disallow (call this
the Accessibility argument)” (ibid.: 18). Now, this is spectacularly not true
about On Chesil Beach. The novel seems, as a whole, to be one long demon-
stration (1) that affective and emotional states do not become visible to others,
and (2) that encounters with fictional minds are not mediated by the same
heuristics used to interpret everyday minds. The very book chosen by Her-
man himself thus seems to confirm Cohn’s point in The Distinction of Fiction as
discussed by Herman about readers of fiction having access to fictional minds
in a way that goes beyond what is possible for access to real minds.6
6. Points 1 and 2 are different claims that do not follow from each other. However, they all
follow from the reading of the novel.

Dozens of pages of On Chesil Beach detail the two main characters’ thoughts
on their wedding night. Edward is brimming with desire and expectations,
while Florence dreads the physical intercourse they both imagine will have to
take place. The reader gets authoritative access to two separate minds that do
not have access to each other, and each of which perpetually grossly misread
each other. In the hotel room, about to go to the bed together, Florence is
thinking “anything but this” (McEwan 2008: 27) and “there was nothing she
could do, beyond fainting” (ibid.). Edward, however, represented here partly
in free indirect discourse is thinking about her “beautiful light brown eyes,
bright with undeniable passion, and the faint trembling in her lower lip, which
even now she wetted with her tongue” (ibid., emphasis added). The scene
goes on, and the irony gradually becomes excruciating, that is, when Florence
is on the verge of vomiting: “If she was sick into his mouth, was one wild
thought, their marriage would be instantly over” (ibid.: 29). The sound Flor-
ence then involuntarily makes is completely misinterpreted by Edward:
“When he heard her moan, Edward knew that his happiness was almost com-
plete” (ibid.: 30).
The reader’s reading of Edward’s mind is very different from Edward’s
reading of Florence’s mind because as readers we are not constrained by
the premises that so limit the characters’ readings of each other. Edward’s
thoughts come to us as authoritative and not as something to interpret or to
make educated guesses about. We know what he thinks because it is not
reported, not expressed in bodily gestures and actions, and not mediated
by the heuristics used to estimate the feelings and thoughts of real people
around us; rather, it is invented. We also know that it is wrong and that the
possibility of it being wrong hinges on the fact that Edward (unlike the reader)
has to rely on an interpretation of exactly such bodily gestures, which are open
to misreading.
The entire book revolves around the theme that the reader knows the
affective and emotional states of the characters and knows that they do not
become visible to others. We get this right because we read with the premise
that the book’s characters are fairly realistic and therefore often misinterpret
each other because their minds are anything but transparent to other char-
acters and their expressive phenomena anything but unambiguous. On the
other hand, the question never arises for readers whether we can know what
the characters think about these matters.7 We know that Edward thinks that
7. This does not mean that everything is laid out in the open and that we get the characters’
every thought. For example, it is a recurring motif and question in the text whether incest has
played a role in Florence’s current dispositions and emotions: “Here came the past anyway, the
indistinct past. . . . It was late in the evening, and her father was moving about the cramped
cabin, undressing, like Edward now. She remembered the rustle of clothes, the clink of a belt

Florence is full of desire, and we know that she is fearful and to some degree
repelled by the thought of the physical encounter. The reader uses, and has to
use, a completely different heuristics for encountering the characters’ minds
than for encountering everyday minds. The reader does not arrive at con-
clusions about Edward’s and Florence’s fears and desires by means of
interpretation, and certainly not by means of interpreting bodily gestures,
because they are directly stated. The characters, conversely, like real people,
have to rely on interpretation and expressive phenomena and, in their gross
and painful misinterpretations, vividly demonstrate that such phenomena
are ambiguous and such interpretations fallible.
The text gives us authoritative access to the thoughts of one character at
a time and authoritative access to the fact that this character does not have
access to the mind of another character. We get access to a mind that does not
have access to another mind. This has everything to do with the question of
fictionality.8 The understanding that readers can unambiguously know what
the characters are unable to know about each other and cannot misread how
these minds misread each other hinges on a conception of fiction where the
minds and their contents are communicated as invented and hence not sub-
ject to doubt and interpretation as far as the explicitly communicated parts
go. The kind of access to mind we have in the examples cannot be attributed
to a fact-reporting narrator or given in expressive phenomena but is inten-
tionally signaled as invented by the author: “The characters in this novel
are inventions and bear no resemblance to people living or dead . . . I.M.”
(ibid.: 169).9
unfastened or of keys or loose change. Her only task was to keep her eyes closed and to think of a
tune she liked. Or any tune. She remembered the sweet scent of almost rotten food in the closed
air of a boat after a rough trip. She was usually sick many times on the crossing, and of no use to
her father as a sailor, and that surely was the source of her shame” (McEwan 2008: 99 – 100).
There are so many signs here, but the fact that incest never becomes a manifest truth in the
narrative in no way invalidates the point that the reader often gets full, authoritative, indubi-
table access to Florence’s as well as Edward’s thoughts. On the contrary, it seems likely that
Florence herself does not have a full recollection and that, for her, this part of the past is, exactly,
“indistinct.”
8. Which is not to say, of course, that all invented stories involve internal or zero focalization;
fictional discourse is capable of presenting minds in unnatural ways but is not defined by this
property. When we perceive represented minds and thoughts as invented we have the inter-
pretational choice to interpret them as authoritative and unquestionable in a way that would be
very strange (and possibly even dangerous) to do with real minds.
9. Nielsen wishes to acknowledge his gratitude for Herman’s generosity and untiring willing-
ness to engage in dialogue and exchange. We hope in this and the following section to continue
this dialogue and thereby contribute to theory development.

2.2. Cognitive Narratology Revisits the “Exceptionality Thesis”
The understanding of other minds is often taken as the standard by which
we understand the fictional text. For example, Gregory Currie writes, “Inter-
preting a work of fiction is much like interpreting a person” (1990: 100), and
Lisa Zunshine applies “source tags” (of different nature) both to levels of
interpersonal social complexity and to the distinction of the fictional text
(2006: 65ff.; see also Palmer 2004). This is hardly a coincidence. The question
of minds and access to minds plays a crucial role in several of the most
canonical earlier studies of the distinction between fiction and nonfiction.
It figures prominently and explicitly in Cohn’s works Transparent Minds (1978)
and The Distinction of Fiction (1999); it is present in the idea of origo in Ham-
burger (1994), and even to some degree in the concept of reflector figure in
Stanzel (1985). It is remarkably decisive, albeit not at all immediately appar-
ent, in Genette’s hugely influential concept of focalization and the distinction
between the questions, who sees? and who speaks?, where “the different ways
in which narratives can give us access to minds are the very means by which
narratives are typologized” (Nielsen 2013: 75). It is not hard to understand,
therefore, why David Herman is especially interested not only in dealing
with the question of mind (as cognitive narratology always is) but also in
addressing that question simultaneously with the question about the dis-
tinction of fiction.10 Minds, thus, are not only at the very center of cognitive
approaches but also at the center of debates about the potential exception-
ality or distinction of fiction.
The conceptualization of the mind, however, is continually under devel-
opment in cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind, enabling cognitive
narratology to refine its models. Second-generation cognitive approaches, as
pursued by Kukkonen, have recently begun to integrate the predictive prob-
abilistic dimensions of thought into accounts of embodiment. In the scientific
literature, it has been proposed that the minds of others emerge as graspable
through synchronized predictions (Friston and Frith 2015). These synchro-
nized predictions derive from the gestures, movements, and utterances of
others, as well as narratives of the self that establish predictive structures.
Enactive takes on cognition (which traditionally assume a direct access to
other minds) have incorporated the predictive dimension (see Hutto 2017;
Gallagher and Allan 2016). The predictive, embodied mind constantly
assesses probable scenarios and revises them in light of prediction errors.
When readers encounter fictional minds in texts, these emerge from what
Kukkonen (2016) calls a “designed sensory flow” of prediction errors, which

aspects of storytelling practices.”

can render fictional minds transparent or opaque to readers’ predictive infer-
ences. The predictive dimension of everyday interaction allows for (usually)
fluid coordination in the flow of experience. In the designed sensory flow of
the fictional text, however, such coordination can be delayed, revisited, and
investigated to a degree well beyond the reach of everyday cognition. Such a
perspective allows second-generation cognitive approaches to conceptualize
the (potentially) exceptional cognitive work that fictional texts allow the
human mind to perform.
Herman constructs the exceptionality thesis as the mark of distinction
between cognitive approaches to narrative fiction, which would reject any
exceptionality, and unnatural approaches to narrative fiction, which would
insist on exceptionality and reject any notion that readers supply their real-
world cognitive processes when making sense of fictional minds. Herman
writes, “What I am disputing . . . is the further inference, based on this initial
claim on fiction-specific techniques, that only fictional narratives can give us
direct ‘inside’ view of characters’ minds, and that fictional minds are there-
fore sui generis, or different in kind from everyday minds” (2011: 8). Several
claims are collapsed here. First, the claim that only fictional narratives can
give us direct access to other minds is refuted by Herman on the basis of
general human cognitive capacities to simulate another’s thoughts and emo-
tional states in order to make sense of these states ourselves. I would agree
with Herman that such a general human cognitive capacity exists and that we
use what we could roughly call imitation to make sense of another’s behavior
through our own embodied experience. Such processes also contribute to our
understanding of the represented thought processes of fictional characters.
A second-generation cognitive approach would highlight in particular evi-
dence of how readers supply their own embodied resonances of movements,
bodily states, and directions to make sense of written language (see Bergen
2012) and how readers place their body at the disposal of the text, leading to
immersive experiences (see Caracciolo 2011).
This does not mean, however, that these cognitive, embodied capacities
give us an accurate “inside” view of another mind, as we have in fictional
narrative. In other words, Herman’s second claim, that fictional minds are
not fundamentally different from everyday minds, does not follow from the
first. According to the second-generation account that merges embodied
cognition and predictive processing, the act of fictionalization leads to a
designed sensory flow that for example shifts between first and third-person
stances embodied in language within the everyday process of predictions.
Nielsen observes in his discussion of On Chesil Beach above, “The reader gets
authoritative access to two separate minds [in On Chesil Beach ] that do not
have access to each other, and each of which perpetually grossly misreads the

other.” The “faint trembling of [Florence’s] lower lip” is perceived by
Edward as a sign of her desire, and I would argue that not only the character
but also readers pick up an embodied echo of the trembling, which helps
them make sense of this perception. Yet this by no means implies that Edward
is correct about Florence’s thoughts, and readers are well aware from other
parts of the narrative, where they do get access to her thoughts, that the
trembling is a physical sign of her fear of him.
The power of this passage lies, I would argue, exactly in the clash between
Edward’s perception and what readers know. The embodied resonance of
the trembling makes this clash more poignant, because readers can share
Edward’s perception while knowing that he is tragically mistaken. Also the
multiple levels of Alison’s “flesh” across the physical and the metaphorical
enhance each other. Such a duplicity of comprehension, I would argue, is an
essential component of fiction and difficult to achieve in a real-world linguis-
tic context (see Kukkonen 2016). It is, in other words, dependent on the
articulated gestalt of the fictional that combines and configures language
into something different from its everyday, nonfictional guise. The text, how-
ever, does not require readers to use “a completely different heuristics” from
their everyday cognition, as Nielsen has concluded in the case of On Chesil
Beach. Rather, we have a process that transforms and escalates everyday
cognition in exceptional ways, while at the same time depending on it for
the key realization of misreading. The act of fictionalization, and the atten-
dant articulated gestaltof thetext,isnotaquestion ofpiggybackingonordinary
cognition, as Herman would have it, but rather a phenomenon facilitated by
the designed sensory flow particular to fictional uses of language. It is excep-
tional, if you will, but not uncognitive.
3. Conclusions and Further Questions
This dialogue has brought us a long way from our starting point, where fic-
tionality appeared as a field over which unnatural and cognitive narratology
were profoundly at odds, to a recognition of points of convergence that could
be developed further. We agree that fiction neither reproduces the real nor
operates independently from it, but we also draw different conclusions from
that fact.
From the point of view of the rhetorical version of fictionality theory
presented here, fictionality as a concept is not limited only to fiction but
also differs from asserting and reporting language. In this conception fiction
is a generic notion encompassing genres such as novels, movies, short stories,
and other cultural products that have been conventionalized to such a degree
that audiences will recognize typical specimens as belonging to one of these

genres. Fictionality, from this perspective, is not a quality of fiction only.
Fictionality invites responses to what is given and taken as invented. This
rhetorical fictionality theory subscribes broadly to Richard Walsh’s frame-
work in The Rhetoric of Fictionality (2007) but aspires to more radically separate
the question of fictionality from the question of fiction as a generic notion.
Walsh still relies heavily, almost solely, on works paratextually designated as
or somehow presented as fiction: “The contextual assumption of fictionality
also informs the processing of [the first sentence in The Trial ] (because we
found the book in the fiction section of the bookshop, or we are reading it for a
course on the modern novel, or we have prior general knowledge of Kafka)”
(ibid.: 33). Even as Walsh carefully distinguishes fictionality from fiction and
aptly suggests that this might contribute to an ongoing paradigm shift, his
pragmatic approach means that he is constantly on the verge of collapsing
the question of fictionality back into the question of fiction. In the quote
above, he comes close to saying that because we know it is fiction, we read
it as fiction.
When fictionality is extricated from fiction in the generic sense, its over-
whelming prevalence in numerous areas of society is revealed. From the
unnatural perspective, fictionality often has a clear real-world scope. In elec-
tion campaigns and on home pages it is not infrequently used for outright
argumentative purposes. In commercials it is very clear that the fictive (say,
singing chocolates) is used to achieve very direct real-world effects (say, con-
sumers buying chocolate they would not otherwise). This does not mean,
though, that we can conflate it with, treat it as, or interpret it like noninventive
language. If we reflect on the famous narrative turn toward acknowledging
storytelling in different disciplines, it is strange to observe that until very
recently there has been almost no interest in describing the specific role of
invented narratives. Branches of unnatural narratology have pointed to the
distinctiveness of some overtly invented narratives and tried to point out that
it would be a mistake to treat all narratives according to the same scheme—
especially if that scheme itself it based on reportive, conversational, face-to-
face storytelling. This makes the question of fictionality one of the core ques-
tions in the dialogue between cognitive and unnatural narratology.
From a cognitively informed point of view, processes of imagining and
such are ubiquitous in our everyday world, but it would be a mistake to
categorize them as the same as fiction and fictionality. Mind wandering,
games of make believe, and mere inventions are not formed and structured
with the complex layering of meaning that becomes available through fic-
tional text. Acts of fictionalization lead to a clear distinction between fiction
and other forms of the imagination. Similarly, from an unnatural point of
view it is necessary but not sufficient merely to recognize that fiction is invent-

ed. The real task is to examine the consequences and the way such a recog-
nition affects interpretation, as well as the understanding of what fiction does.
Perhaps the most important question to arise from our dialogue—and the
one, possibly, where unnatural narratology and second-generation narratol-
ogy can mutually benefit the most from each other—is how it is possible that
fictional discourse so evidently affects our ideas about what is true and right
and real, if the very point of departure is that it is a discourse not limited to
describing reality as it is. Unnatural narratology can contribute to empha-
sizing the latter part of the question, and second-generation narratology, to
remembering as well as understanding the former.
We think that fictionality became a shibboleth of the discussion between
the approaches because of the different sets of distinctions it brought to the
fore and the seemingly obvious conclusion it led us to challenge: the exception
is not uncognitive. Overtly fictional narratives are neither unusual nor non-
prototypical. Fictionality is just as serious as nonfictionality. Fictionality is not
a negation of nonfictionality. Fictional narratives according to unnatural
narratology can utilize strategies that stories following the rules of reporting
and noninventive language cannot. Acts of fictionalization open new possi-
bilities for texts that nonfictional texts do not have, according to second-
generation cognitive narratology. Both perspectives support the view that
we should not unwarrantedly assume that the same limits and restrictions
apply to all narratives, nor should we think that the fact that the same limits
and restrictions may not apply is somehow uncognitive.
Areasof disagreement and debate will undoubtedly remain. Fromasecond-
generation perspective, fiction is one of the ways in which cognition extends
into the cultural and material environment of the embodied individual and
how the latter shapes its social communities. The scope of what we call
“fiction” might be different here. While Spolsky includes relics and journalist
photography in Contracts of Fiction as part of a homeostatic system creating
“communal stability in an ever-changing world” (2015: 8), one could point to
the specificity of “literary designer environments” created through the virtual
world of text and through the networks of intertextuality in what we more
generally call “literature” (see Kukkonen, forthcoming). The imaginary and
the constructed are common in the conglomerate of culture and cognition
and can be found in relics, political speeches, and TV ads, but their particular
overlap and transformation into fiction, we would argue, are a more par-
ticular kind of cognitive encounter that warrants further investigation. Here,
an alliance between unnatural and cognitive narratology could really come
into its own, exploring how exactly the sensory flow of literary, fictional
language is designed in innovative, inventive ways and how it enhances
embodiedness beyond the parameters of the real and the imaginary.
