Abstract
Are large language models (LLMs) like GPT-
3 psychologically safe? In this work, we de-
sign unbiased prompts to evaluate LLMs sys-
tematically from a psychological perspective.
Firstly, we test the personality traits of three
different LLMs with Short Dark Triad (SD-
3) and Big Five Inventory (BFI). We ﬁnd all
of them show higher scores on SD-3 than the
human average, indicating a relatively darker
personality. Furthermore, LLMs like Instruct-
GPT and FLAN-T5, which are ﬁne-tuned with
safety metrics, do not necessarily have more
positive personalities. They score higher on
Machiavellianism and Narcissism than GPT-
3. Secondly, we test the LLMs in GPT-3 se-
ries on well-being tests to study the impact
of ﬁne-tuning with more training data.
In-
terestingly, we observe a continuous increase
in well-being scores from GPT-3 to Instruct-
GPT. Following the observations, we show
that instruction-ﬁnetune FLAN-T5 with posi-
tive answers in BFI can effectively improve the
model from a psychological perspective. Fi-
nally, we call on the community to evaluate
and improve LLMs’ safety systematically in-
stead of at the sentence level only.

Introduction
In the 1960s, Joseph Weizenbaum at the MIT Ar-
tiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory wrote the ﬁrst Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot, ELIZA
(Weizenbaum, 1966), which demonstrated the su-
perﬁciality of communication between humans and
machines by using pattern matching and substi-
tution methodologies (Weizenbaum, 1976; Colby
et al., 1966; Wortzel, 2007). As one of the ﬁrst
programs capable of attempting the Turing test
(Christopher, 2006), ELIZA can even simulate a
Rogerian psychotherapist to parrot back at patients
what they had just said (Bassett, 2018). Though

capable of engaging in discourse, ELIZA could not
converse with true understanding.
With over 60 years of rapid development of
NLP techniques, Large Language Models (LLMs)
(Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung
et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) are now under the
spotlight of the stage. Pre-trained with a massive
amount of information from the internet, LLMs
are now capable of truly understanding the lan-
guage (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Goyal
et al., 2022), which revolutionizes many NLP ap-
plications such as chatbots, from rule-based to
generation-based. For example, ChatGPT has been
recently unveiled as a cutting-edge chatbot built
on InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), which is
capable of carrying out intelligent, context-aware
conversations with users in a generation and human-
like way. NLP techniques are now used in various
real-life applications, including customer service,
education, entertainment(Menick et al., 2022; Yuan
et al., 2022; Nichols et al., 2020), etc. As LLMs
become increasingly sophisticated and anthropo-
morphic (Salles et al., 2020), it is likely that they
will play an even bigger role in our daily lives.
Yet, LLMs are prone to generate potentially
harmful or inappropriate content, such as halluci-
nations, spam, or hate speech (Bender et al., 2021;
Bommasani et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020a;
Tamkin et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021), which
results from unavoidable toxic information in the
pre-training datasets.
Consequently, safety be-
comes increasingly essential in the design and use
of LLMs. There has been a long line of research
on safety measurements and quantifying biases in
NLP tasks such as text classiﬁcation (Röttger et al.,
2021; Vidgen et al., 2021) and coreference resolu-
tion (Uppunda et al., 2021). Various safety metrics
(Thoppilan et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022) have
been devised to evaluate and control the genera-
tion of LLMs. The most common ones can be
roughly grouped into three main categories: data
arXiv:2212.10529v1  [cs.CL]  20 Dec 2022

pre-processing, model ﬁne-tuning and result cali-
bration, which from bottom to up, operates on data
(Thoppilan et al., 2022; Levy et al., 2022), model
(Ouyang et al., 2022) and output (Ye and Durrett,
2022), respectively.
However, the above metrics and methods only
function on each sentence independently, which
is insufﬁcient to detect unsafety in more complex
scenarios. For example, psychopaths can be iden-
tiﬁed by analyzing their communication patterns:
(1) They use more past-tense verbs than others. (2)
They talk about their behavior in terms of cause
and effect. (3) They tell rich stories about them-
selves to gain trust and manipulate their listeners
(de Almeida Brites, 2016). When an LLMs-based
chatbot shows the above patterns, current safety
metrics are incapable of detecting such danger. As
such, more comprehensive measurements, such as
personality and well-being tests are required for
safely using LLMs. The study of personality is
a central focus in psychology, as it aims to un-
derstand the differences and similarities between
individuals and how various aspects of a person in-
tegrate as a whole. Personality is characterized by
relatively stable patterns in an individual’s thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors, and is often used in psy-
chological research to predict one’s behaviors and
explain individual differences (Larsen et al., 2001).
With the advancement of NLP, it is now possible for
state-of-the-art LLMs to answer questions in per-
sonality tests with reasonable explanations. This
raises the possibility that the personality of LLMs
may also predict their performance in other tasks,
such as generating toxic content.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to
address LLMs’ safety issues from a psychological
perspective. We conduct extensive and unbiased
experiments to study the personalities of current
state-of-the-art LLMs with two categories of psy-
chological tests. Furthermore, we design an easy
yet effective method to improve the personality of
FLAN-T5. In summary, our main ﬁndings are:
• LLMs show high scores on all traits of the
Short Dark Triad (SD-3) than the human average,
which indicates a relatively negative personality.
We observe that several trait scores of GPT-3 and
FLAN-T5 exceed the normal range.
• Though LLMs like InstructGPT and FLAN-T5
are ﬁne-tuned with safety metrics and demon-
strate less sentence-level toxicity, we ﬁnd they
do not necessarily have more positive personali-
ties.
• LLMs in GPT-3 series with more instruction-
ﬁnetuning interestingly score higher on well-
being tests. The score of text-davinci-002, which
is instruction-ﬁnetuned with the most data, even
falls in the extremely satisﬁed category.
• InstructGPT has relatively positive Big Five In-
ventory (BFI) results yet negative SD-3 results.
This is because the statements in BFI are de-
scribed in positive language. As such, this raises
the possibility that instruction-ﬁnetuned LLMs
may behave well superﬁcially and not include
explicitly harmful content, but still have a high
level of implicit dark personality.
• Various formats of prompts can possibly result
in bias in the answers given by LLMs for each
independent statement in the psychological test.
Yet the ﬁnal trait scores of the test are stable and
ﬁt a normal distribution.
• Instruction-ﬁning
FLAN-T5
with
positive
question-answer pairs of BFI can effectively
improve its personality, which results in better
scores on SD-3.

Related Work
Safety is a long-standing problem in Artiﬁcial Intel-
ligence (AI), especially for Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Generated Content (AIGC) created by large lan-
guage models, which has drawn signiﬁcant atten-
tion from the research communities (Weng, 2021).
For better generalization, LLMs are pre-trained on
a massive amount of information from the internet,
which unavoidably contains the toxic text. As such,
LLMs are prone to generate unsafe content. The
commonly used methods to address safety issues
can be grouped into three main categories: data
pre-processing, model instruction-ﬁnetuning, and
output calibration.
Crowdsourcing is the most common approach
for data pre-processing (Davidson et al., 2017;
Zampieri et al., 2019). Annotators with different
demographic backgrounds are normally recruited
to improve the data quality. Furthermore, a semi-
supervised dataset was proposed (Khatri et al.,
2018), which relies on a small annotated dataset
and a large unlabelled dataset.
Self-debiasing
(Schick et al., 2021) is a process for using the in-
ternal knowledge of the LLM to reduce the prob-
ability of toxic generation. Instruction-ﬁnetuning
has been applied in state-of-the-art LLMs, such
as InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and FLAN-

T5 (Chung et al., 2022). With non-toxic corpora
and instructions, LLMs are instruction-ﬁnetuned
to improve safety. For a more sophisticated safety
control, LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022) is ﬁne-
tuned with its own generation, where each sentence
is labeled with a safety score. The score is manu-
ally marked by hired annotators, following a safety
guideline derived from Google’s AI Principles 1.
Results calibration normally functions at model de-
coding time. Bad word ﬁltering (Weng, 2021) is
a simple yet effective way to avoid explicit toxic
words in the generation, which manually reduces
the probabilities of sampling blocked words. Vo-
cabulary shifting (Gehman et al., 2020b) boosts the
likelihood of non-toxic tokens at decoding time by
learning a 2-dimensional representation of toxicity
and non-toxicity for each token in the vocabulary
of the LLM.

Experiment Setup
In this section, we present the experiment setup.
We ﬁrst introduce the LLMs and the psychological
tests we evaluate on, followed by the evaluation
framework we design for a fair analysis.
3.1
Large Language Models
We choose a set of LLMs to perform a thorough
evaluation both vertically and horizontally.
GPT-3 (davinci)
GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is
an autoregressive language model with 175B pa-
rameters. Given a text prompt, it generates text
to complete the prompt. GPT-3 has shown strong
few-shot learning capability across various tasks
and benchmarks, including translation, question-
answering, as well as tasks that require reasoning,
such as natural language inference. We regard GPT-
3 as a human-like text generator, which makes it
the perfect candidate to take psychological tests.
InstructGPT
InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022)
is currently the most capable language model in the
GPT-3 series. It includes GPT-3-I1 (text-davinci-
001) and GPT-3-I2 (text-davinci-002), where GPT-
3-I2 is trained with more data but the same model
architecture. With the same amount of parameters
as GPT-3, InstructGPT is trained with humans in
the loop to generate more truthful and less toxic
text. As such, InstructGPT is considered as a safer
version of GPT-3. We aim to investigate its safety
from a psychological perspective.

FLAN-T5-XXL
FLAN-T5-XXL (Chung et al.,
2022) is an instruction-ﬁnetuned T5, which ad-
vances instruction ﬁnetuning in several ways:
(1) scaling the number of tasks (2) scaling the
model size, and (3) ﬁnetuning on chain-of-thought
data. With only 11B parameters, FLAN-T5-XXL
achieves better results than GPT-3 and compara-
ble results with InstructGPT on several bench-
marks. Furthermore, FLAN-T5-XXL improves
model safety in several ways, including toxic con-
tent and gender bias.
3.2
Psychological Tests
We experiment with two categories of psychologi-
cal tests. One is personality tests, which have rel-
atively consistent results for the same respondent,
including Short Dark Triad (Jones and Paulhus,
2013) and Big Five Inventory (John and Srivastava,
1999). The other one is well-being tests, which
may have different results for the same respondent
resulting from various circumstances and periods,
including Flourishing Scale (Diener et al., 2010),
Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985).
Each test consists of a set of statements that the
respondent is required to rate each statement from
Disagree to Agree.
Short Dark Triad (SD-3)
The dark triad person-
ality consists of three closely related yet indepen-
dent personality traits that all have a malevolent
connotation. The three traits are Machiavellian-
ism (a manipulative attitude), Narcissism (exces-
sive self-love), and Psychopathy (lack of empa-
thy), which capture the darker aspects of human
nature. These three traits share a common core
of callous manipulation, and are strong predictors
of a range of antisocial behaviors, including bul-
lying, cheating, and criminal behaviors (Furnham
et al., 2013). SD-3 (Jones and Paulhus, 2013) is
a uniform assessment for the three traits. And it
consists of 27 statements that must be rated on how
much the respondent agrees with them from 1 to
5. The ﬁnal scores of the three traits are the av-
erage scores of the corresponding statements for
each trait. More details can be found in §A.1. With
the results of SD-3, we can gain insights into the
potential risks of the LLMs that may not have been
adequately addressed so far.
Big Five Inventory (BFI)
The big ﬁve personal-
ity traits are the best accepted and most commonly
used model of personality in academic psychology.
It is based on factor analysis and consists of ﬁve

dimensions: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Con-
scientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness. BFI
(John and Srivastava, 1999) consists of 44 state-
ments that must be rated on how much the respon-
dent agrees with them from 1 to 5. The ﬁnal scores
of the ﬁve traits are the average scores of the cor-
responding statements for each trait. More details
can be found in §A.2. Agreeableness and Neuroti-
cism are closely related to the concept of model
safety. Research has shown that individuals with
high Agreeableness tend to avoid conﬂict and enjoy
helping others (Larsen et al., 2001). On the other
hand, the opposite side of Agreeableness is aggres-
siveness. (Wu and Clark, 2003) found that highly
aggressive individuals are more likely to be rude
and attack others. Neuroticism, or emotional insta-
bility, measures how people experience emotions.
Individuals high on Neuroticism are more anxious,
moody, and tend to feel insecure (Goldberg, 1990).
High Neuroticism is also associated with adverse
outcomes such as increased fatigue, depression,
and suicidal ideation (Larsen et al., 2001). There-
fore, models with lower Agreeableness and higher
Neuroticism may be more aggressive and harmful
when generating content.
Flourishing Scale (FS)
In psychology, personal-
ity is more of a dispositional concept that is rel-
atively stable across time that can be generalized
to different situations. On the other hand, well-
being reﬂects more situational or environmental
inﬂuences on one’s life. It is deﬁned as people’s
overall happiness or satisfaction with their life (Di-
ener et al., 2018). The FS (Diener et al., 2010)
adopts a eudaimonic approach that emphasizes the
state of human potential and positive human func-
tioning (e.g. competence, meaning, and purpose).
It consists of 8 statements that must be rated on
how much the subject agrees with them from 1
to 7. The ﬁnal score is the sum of all statement
scores. A high score signiﬁes that the respondent
is in positive terms. More details can be found in
§A.3.
Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)
The
SWLS (Diener et al., 1985) is an assessment of the
respondent’s global cognitive judgments of satisfac-
tion with the life, which measures as a cognitive-
judgmental process and asks individuals to rate
their satisfaction with life as a whole based on their
own criteria. In well-being literature, SWLS is con-
sidered to adopt a hedonic approach, relying on

following statement. Why?

positive emotions that a person currently experi-
ences. It consists of 5 statements that must be rated
on how much the respondent agrees with them from
1 to 7. The ﬁnal score is the sum of all statement
scores. Respondents who have high scores love
their lives and feel that things are going very well.
More details can be found in §A.4.
3.3
Evaluation Framework
The autoregressive nature of LLMs determines
their dependence on input prompts. Thus, it is
crucial to design unbiased prompts, especially
for psychological tests. We permute all available
options in the test’s instruction and take the
average score as the ﬁnal result to ensure that the
result is not biased from the prompt. Furthermore,
for each prompt and statement, we sample three
results from the LLM and take the average score.
We formally deﬁne the set of all statements in
test T as ST . And we deﬁne m traits in test T
as {t1, t2, ..., tm}. As such, we further deﬁne the
corresponding set of statements for trait ti as Sti,
where
St1 ∪St2 ∪... ∪Stm = ST
(1)
We deﬁne a set of prompts P j for each statement
sj ∈Sti. We deﬁne n available options in test T as
OT = {o1, o2, ..., on}. For example, OT in SD-3
test is {Disagree, Slightly disagree, Neither agree
nor disagree, Slightly agree, Agree}. We deﬁne
δ(OT ) as all the possible permutations of OT . As
such, Ik = {o′
k1, o′
k2, ..., o′
kn} ∈δ(OT ) is one of
the permutations. We design zero-shot prompt for
each pj
k ∈P j with Ik and sj, an example is shown
in Figure 1.
We obtain the answer aj
k as
aj
k ∼Mτ(pj
k)
(2)

where Mτ(·) is the LLM with τ temperature during
decoding process2. Furthermore, the score rj
k is
obtained by a parser f(·) as
rj
k = f(aj
k)
(3)
The parser is a rule-based function that identiﬁes
the selected option in the answer aj
k. We design
several rules for situations where the generated
answers do not contain an explicit option. For
example, we mark the answer as Agree when aj
k is
simply a repetition of sj. Hence, the average score
of three samplings for statement sj is given by,
rj =
1
3n!

τ(pj

(4)
Finally, we calculate the score for trait ti as
zti = g(rj), sj ∈Sti
(5)
where g(·) is either an average or summation func-
tion depending on test T.

Results and Analysis
We discuss our main ﬁndings regarding LLMs’ per-
formances on SD-3, BFI, and well-being tests. Fur-
thermore, we conduct cross-test analysis on the
personality proﬁle of the LLMs. Last but not least,
we show an effective way of instruction-ﬁnetuning
LLMs for a more positive personality.
4.1
Do LLMs have Dark Personalities?
We obtain the average human results of 7,863
samples from various studies (Jones and Paulhus,
2013; Persson et al., 2019; Baughman et al., 2012;
Papageorgiou et al., 2017; Jonason et al., 2015;
Hmieleski and Lerner, 2016; Egan et al., 2014; Kay
and Saucier, 2020; Butler, 2015; Adler, 2017). We
also compute the standard deviations of the human

results. And the abnormal score range is deﬁned
as one standard deviation higher than the average
result. As shown in Table 1, GPT-3, GPT-3-I2 and
FLAN-T5-XXL show higher scores for all traits in
SD-3 than the average human results. GPT-3 has
similar scores on Machiavellianism and Narcissism
as the human results. However, its Psychopathy
score exceeds the human result by 0.84, which lies
in the abnormal score range. The Machiavellian-
ism and Narcissism scores of GPT-3-I2 nearly enter
the abnormal zone. And its Psychopathy score is
relatively lower than the other two LLMs. FLAN-
T5-XXL has the highest Machiavellianism and Psy-
chopathy scores among all LLMs. And both scores
vastly exceed the abnormal thresholds.
With SD-3, we evaluate the safety of LLMs
from a psychological perspective instead of naive
sentence level. Our results suggest that having a
relatively negative personality is a common phe-
nomenon for current LLMs.
4.2
Do LLMs with Less Sentence-level
Toxicity Have Better Personalities?
InstructGPT (GPT-3-I2) is reported (Ouyang et al.,
2022) to generate less toxic content than GPT-3
when instructed to produce a safe and respectful
output. However, we observe that GPT-3-I2 shows
much higher scores of dark personality than GPT-3,
except for the Psychopathy score, where GPT-3-I2
reduces by 0.54 compared with GPT-3. Further-
more, FLAN-T5-XXL is also trained with instruc-
tions on toxic language detection (Chung et al.,
2022) to prevent generating harmful content. In
contrast to its lower sentence-level toxicity, FLAN-
T5-XXL fails to perform well on SD-3. It scores
higher than GPT-3 on all traits.
Apart from SD-3, we obtain the average human
results of 3,387,303 samples for BFI in the United
States (Ebert et al., 2021). As shown in Table 2, we
observe that instruction-ﬁnetuned LLMs (i.e., GPT-
3-I2, FLAN-T5-XXL) have higher Agreeableness
and lower Neuroticism scores than GPT-3, which
indicates more stable personalities for instruction-
ﬁnetuned LLMs.
From the above observations, we conclude that
reducing sentence-level toxicity does not neces-
sarily improve personality scores. As generative
LLMs are applied to more and more real-life scenar-
ios, it is crucial to design a systematic framework
for evaluating and improving LLMs.

4.3
Do LLMs Show Satisfaction in
Well-being Tests?
We’ve discussed LLMs results on personality tests
which are designed to give relatively consistent
scores for the same respondent. What about those
time-related tests?
Will LLMs score similarly
on well-being tests? We experiment with mod-
els from GPT-3 series (GPT-3, GPT-3-I1, GPT-3-
I2) on Flouring Scale and Satisfaction With Life
Scale. According to (Ouyang et al., 2022), Instruct-
GPT (GPT-3-I1, GPT-3-I2) is ﬁne-tuned on GPT-3
with human feedback. And GPT-3-I2 is ﬁne-tuned
with more data from prompts submitted by Ope-
nAI’s customers on GPT-3-I1. This indicates that
models in GPT-3 series share the same pretraining
datasets. As shown in Table 3, interestingly, we ob-
serve that ﬁne-tuning with more data consistently
helps LLMs score higher on both FS and SLWS.
However, the results on FS differ from SLWS. The
scores for FS indicate that LLMs are generally sat-
isﬁed. And GPT-3-I2 even falls into the highly
satisﬁed category. Whereas for SLWS, GPT-3 only
scores 9.97 which indicates its substantial dissatis-
faction. And GPT-3-I2 scores 23.27, which is at a
generally satisﬁed level.
4.4
Personality Proﬁle of the LLMs and
Cross-Test Analysis
Considering each LLM as a unique individual, we
can combine all the psychological tests to gain a
deeper understanding of each model’s psychologi-
cal proﬁle and potential risky aspects.
While GPT-3 has the lowest Machiavellianism
and Narcissism scores among the three models, it
has a high score in Psychopathy. In BFI results,
GPT-3 has lower Agreeableness and Conscientious-
ness, and higher Neuroticism than the other two
models. Previous research suggests that the above
correlations can be localized to little compassion
(for Agreeableness), limited orderliness (for Con-
scientiousness), and higher volatility (for Neuroti-
cism) (Jonason et al., 2013). Also, GPT-3 has the
lowest well-being score, which aligns with exist-
ing ﬁndings on the negative correlation between
Psychopathy and subjective well-being (Love and
Holder, 2014).
GPT-3-I2, as an InstructGPT model considered
with higher safety, does obtain higher Agreeable-
ness, Conscientiousness, Openness, and lower Neu-
roticism in the BFI. However, one potential prob-
lem of the Big Five is its limited ability to detect the
dark sides of people due to the positive language
description of the scales (Youli and Chao, 2015), so
the Dark Triad is an essential complement for cap-

turing one’s darker personality traits. Our results
demonstrate that GPT-3-I2 has higher Machiavel-
lianism and Narcissism than GPT-3. The results are
not contradictory because previous studies reported
similar results that high Machiavellianism and Nar-
cissism are not necessarily associated with low
Agreeableness or Conscientiousness (Ashton et al.,
2000). In fact, the most signiﬁcant predictor for
Machiavellianism and Narcissism is honesty (Lee
and Ashton, 2005). People with higher Machiavel-
lianism and Narcissism usually have lower honesty
or humility. This suggests that although GPT-3-I2
was instruction-ﬁnetuned and performed better in
the Big Five test, it may still suffer from insincerity,
unfairness, or pretentiousness.
Finally, FLAN-T5-XXL has a medium level of
Big Five personality traits compared to the two
GPT-3 models and the average results in the United
States. However, FLAN-T5-XXL has overall poor
results in the Dark Triad personality traits, with the
highest Machiavellianism and Psychopathy among
the three models. Similar to GPT-3-I2, these results
indicate that FLAN-T5-XXL may have a higher
level of deceiving and ﬂattering tendency due to
high Machiavellianism (Hren et al., 2006), so their
answers to the Big Five test may not be reliable
enough to reﬂect their true personality.
Therefore, an important ﬁnding in the cross-test
comparison for GPT-3-I2 and FLAN-T5-XXL is
that particular Dark Triad traits (i.e., Machiavel-
lianism and Narcissism) could not be detected in
the Big Five personality tests with positive lan-
guage. A similar situation may appear when we
test models directly for toxicity. Since Machiavel-
lianism and Narcissism are less overt and immi-
nently dangerous than Psychopathy (Gordon and
Platek, 2009), some instruction-ﬁnetuned models
may behave well and do not include any explicitly
harmful content in the output. However, they may
still have a high level of implicit bias and make
discriminatory decisions in particular tasks.

LLMs Have Stable Trait Scores
Though we design a set of prompts with a permu-
tation of options for each statement, we observe
that the order of options in the instructions may
still affect the answers. For example, in Table 4 we
prompt GPT-3-I2 with the same statement "I hate
being the center of attention." from SD-3 but dif-
ferent orders of options. The answer then changes

from slightly disagree to agree. Similarly in BFI,
we prompt the statement "I am not interested in
other people’s problems." with different orders of
options, and the answer changes from slightly dis-
agree to agree. We attribute this to the conditional
generative nature of LLMs. Throughout the exper-
iments, we observe that only 5% of the answers
have such conﬂicts.
For both SD-3 and BFI tests, we plot the dis-
tributions of the trait scores in Figure 2, includ-
ing all permutations of the instruction options for
each LLM. We observe that in almost all cases, the
scores are normally distributed. As such, though
LLMs may generate different answers resulting
from different orders of options in the prompt, the
ﬁnal trait scores are reliable.

Instruction-ﬁnetune FLAN-T5 with
Positive BFI Answers
FLAN-T5 is instruction-ﬁnetuned on 1,836 tasks.
Yet, there are no psychology-related tasks, and the
model is not ﬁne-tuned toward a positive person-
ality. In this section, we show that instruction-
ﬁnetuning FLAN-T5 with positive answers of BFI
can effectively improve its personality.
Firstly,
we collect BFI answers from our previous experi-
ments on all LLMs. Secondly, we keep the results
where the Agreeableness score is higher and the
Neuroticism score is lower than the human aver-
age. And we deﬁne these answers as positive an-
swers. As such, we construct a dataset containing
4,312 positive question-answer pairs. Furthermore,
we instruction-ﬁnetune FLAN-T5-Large with the
dataset. And we name the new model as P-FLAN-
T5-Large. As shown in Table 5, P-FLAN-T5-Large
has lower scores on all three traits, which indicates
a more positive and stable personality than the base
model FLAN-T5-Large.

Conclusions
In this work, we design an unbiased framework
to evaluate LLMs from a psychological perspec-
tive. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
three LLMs on both personality and well-being
tests, including Short Dark Triad, Big Five Inven-
tory, Flourishing Scale and Satisfaction With Life
Scale. Results show that LLMs do not necessarily
have positive personalities even with instruction-
ﬁnetuning with several safety metrics. Last but
not least, we instruction-ﬁnetune FLAN-T5 with
positive question-answer pairs from Big Five In-
ventory, which effectively improves the results on
Short Dark Triad. Most importantly, we call on the
community to evaluate and improve LLMs’ safety
systematically from a psychological perspective
instead of at the sentence level only.
