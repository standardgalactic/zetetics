Preface by Arne Næss
This introduction to The General Theory of Relativity and
its mathematics is written for all those, young and old,
who lack or have forgotten the necessary mathematical
knowledge to cope with already published introductions.
Some of these introductions seem, at the start to require
only moderately much mathematics.
Very soon, how-
ever, there are frightful ‘jumps’ in the exposition, or sud-
denly new concepts or notations appear as if nearly self
evident. The present text starts at a lower level than any
other, and leads the reader slowly and faithfully all the
way to the heart of relativity: Einstein’s ﬁeld equations.
Who are those who seriously desire to get acquainted
with General Relativity, but have practically no mathe-
matical knowledge? There are tens of thousands of them,
thanks to the great general interest in relativity, quan-
tum physics and cosmology of every profession, includ-
ing those with education only in the humanities.
Slowly many of these interested persons understand
the truth of what one of the last Century’s most brilliant
xv

Preface by Arne Næss
xvi
physicists and populariser, Sir Arthur Eddington, told us
already in the 1920s: that strictly speaking, mathemat-
ical physics cannot be understood through popularisa-
tions. Mathematics plays a role that is not merely instru-
mental, like cobalt chemicals for the paintings of Rem-
brandt. Mathematical concepts enter in an essential way,
and readers of popularisations are mislead. Their intel-
ligence is insulted and bulled when they ask intelligent
questions that their popular text cannot answer except
by absurdities. The honest readers may end up in a quag-
mire of paradoxes, and may get the usually false idea that
there is something wrong with their intelligence. What
they read they consider beyond their intellectual grasp.
It is a widespread expectation that a mathematical un-
derstanding of general relativity involves difﬁcult calcu-
lations. Actually, coping with the few somewhat lengthy
strings of symbols in this text may be felt as a relief from
abstract thinking. What takes time is the thorough under-
standing of the relations between a few basic concepts.
They require close, repeated attention and patient work.
This surprising feature to some degree justiﬁes that we
have not included exercises in the text.
To be honest,
some should have been included, but they would have
been of a rather strange kind: exercises in articulating
conceptual relations.
But what about the formidable calculations one may
read about in popularisations? They affect applications,

Preface by Arne Næss
xvii
for instance particular solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equa-
tions. Examples of such calculations are found in appen-
dices B and C. Even if the reader should not expect to
be an operator of relativistic physics, he or she should be
well acquainted with it having read this book. We ven-
ture to suggest that the understanding acquired by the
reader may be deeper than what is necessary for com-
pleting graduate courses intended to make the student
an expert in calculations involving general relativity, but
requiring only crude discussions of the all-important con-
ceptual framework.
The present text shows, we hope, that only patience is
needed—no special talent for mathematics. Personally I
have never shown any such talent, only a persistent won-
der at strange mathematical phenomena, like the endless
number 3.1415. . .with the very short name ‘pi’. (Caution:
the length of the circumference of a circle divided by the
diameter may have any value. Only in the special case
of a ﬂat space will you get the number 3.1415. . . . More
about that later!) Again and again I refused to comply
with the long streams of strange mathematical symbols
which Øyvind Grøn, my patient Guru of mathematics
and physics, rapidly wrote on our gigantic blackboard.
“Stop, stop! I don’t want that equation! How did you
jump from that one to the next?” To the astonishment of
both of us it was possible to break down the long deduc-
tions into small and easily understandable steps.

Preface by Arne Næss
xviii
A serious weakness of those courses, in my view as a
humanist, is the implicit appeal to make the student ac-
cept what is going on without wondering. Along the road
to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, feats of artistic conceptual
imagination abound. Also postulates and assumptions
of seemingly arbitrary kinds are made. Some of them are
seen to have a rational aspect when properly understood,
but far from all. Einstein did not ﬁnd all this wonder-
ful. What deeply moved him in his wonder was that the
concepts and equations he (and others, like Minkowski)
invented, could be tested in the real world and in part
conﬁrmed. Somehow there must be, wondered Einstein,
a kind of ‘pre-established harmony’ between inventive
conceptual imagination and aspects of reality itself.
The present text tries to keep wonder alive, a wonder
not due to misunderstandings.
Some people, as part of their religion, creep on their
knees all around the holy mountain Kailas in Tibet. The
present text would not have been produced if it had not
been clearly felt as a way of honouring Albert Einstein
not only as a persistent, fully committed truth seeker, but
as a person combining this, and the ‘egocentricity’ going
with it, with perfect generosity. He used his name and
his time to work for the persecuted, for emigrants, for the
hungry. And, in addition, feeling the absurdity of the po-
litical developments, he partook in depressing world af-
fairs, even compromising his deeply felt paciﬁsm. And,

last but not least, he retained a sense of humour, and even
as a superstar, was unaware of his outer appearance to
the extent of neglecting to keep his worn trousers prop-
erly shut when lecturing. He would perhaps laugh if he
got to know that this text is an expression of personal de-
votion.

Preface by Øyvind Grøn
One day, early in the Autumn 1985, the seventy three
year old philosopher Arne Næss appeared at my grad-
uate course on general relativity. He immediatly decided
that a new type of introduction to the general theory of
relativity is needed; an introduction designed to meet the
requirements of non-science educated people wanting to
get a thorough understanding of this, most remarkable,
theory.
The present text is the result of our efforts to provide
a useful book for these people. It is neither a popular
nor a semi-popular account of the theory. The book re-
quires a rather large amount of patience from the reader,
but nearly no previous knowledge of physics and mathe-
matics. Our intention is to give an introduction that leads
right up to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations and their most im-
portant consequences, starting at a lower level than what
is common. The mathematical deductions are made with
small steps so that the mathematically inexperienced
reader may follow what happens. The meaning of the
xx

concepts that appear are explained and illustrated. And
in some instances we mention points of a more philo-
sophical character.
We devote a whole chapter to each of the topics ‘vec-
tors’, ‘differentiation’, ‘curves’ and ‘curved coordinate
systems’. Tensors are indispensable tools in a formula-
tion of the general theory of relativity intended to give
the reader the possibility to apply the theory, at least to
some simple, but nonetheless non-trivial, problems. The
metric tensor is introduced in chapter 5, which also pro-
vides a most important discussion of the kinematic inter-
pretation of the spacetime line element.
Albert Einstein demanded from his theory that no co-
ordinate system is privileged. And in general curved co-
ordinate systems are needed to describe curved spaces.
In such coordinate systems the basis vectors vary with the
position. This is described by the Christoffel symbols. In
chapter 6 we give a thorough discussion, of a geometrical
character, showing how the basis vectors of plane polar
coordinates change with position, and relate this to the
Christoffel symbols.
Having worked yourself through
this chapter, it is our hope that you have obtained a high
degree of familiarity with the Christoffel symbols.
‘Covariant differentiation’, ‘geodesic curves’ and ‘cur-
vature’ are important topics forming a ‘package’ of pre-
requisites necessary in order to be able to appreciate fully
Einstein’s geometric conception of gravity. These topics

are treated in chapters 7, 8 and 9, respectively. The ex-
pression for the Riemann curvature tensor is deduced by
utilising Green’s theorem connecting circulation and curl.
Einstein’s law of gravitation is formulated mathemat-
ically in his ﬁeld equations. They tell how matter curves
spacetime.
The ﬁeld equations require an appropriate
tensor representation of some properties of matter, i.e. of
density, stress and motion. The usual representation of
these properties is motivated and explained in chapter
10, where the basic conservation laws of classical ﬂuid
mechanics are expressed in tensor form. In chapter 11 the
expression for Einstein’s divergence free curvature tensor
is deduced. With this chapter our preparation for a pre-
sentation of general relativity has been fulﬁlled.
Einstein’s general theory of relativity is presented in
chapter 12. Here we discuss the conceptual contents of
the general theory of relativity. We consider the New-
tonian limit of the theory, and we give an elementary
demonstration of the following theorem: From the gen-
eral theory of relativity and the assumption that it is im-
possible to measure velocity relative to vacuum, it fol-
lows that vacuum energy acts upon itself with repulsive
gravitation.
In chapters 13 and 14 we deduce some consequences
of the theory. In particular we discuss the gravitational
time dilation, the deﬂection of light, the relativistic con-
tribution to Mercury’s perihelion precession, and we give

Preface by Øyvind Grøn

a detailed explanation of how the theory predicts the pos-
sible existence of black holes. Finally the most important
relativistic universe models, including the so-called inﬂa-
tionary universe models, are discussed.
Detailed calculations of the form of the Laplacian dif-
ferential operator in spherical coordinates, needed in
chapter 12, and of the components of the Ricci curvature
tensor, needed to write down Einstein’s ﬁeld equations
for the applications in chapters 13 and 14, are presented
in appendices A, B, and C, respectively.
Looking at the stars with Einstein’s theory in mind,
you may feel it is like a wonder that Einstein managed
to reveal such deep secrets of cosmos to us. People do
in fact search for black holes now. And there are strong
indications that at least a few have been found. What
mysterious connection is there that makes nature ’obey’
Einstein’s great mental construction - the general theory
of relativity?

Chapter 1
Vectors
1.1
Introduction
Mathematically the general theory of relativity is a theory
of vectors and quantities that generalize vectors, namely
tensors. If one wants to master, or at least obtain some
familiarity, with the mathematical apparatus of this the-
ory, one should manage to have intercourse with vectors
as dear friends. It is wise from the very start to listen to
them with benevolence and patience. They have some
rather strange habits which we should be well aware of,
in order to be able to understand their message without a
misinterpretation.
In what follows we shall not assume that the reader
knows vectors. We shall give an heuristic introduction
that sufﬁces for our goal. More formal and general in-

troductions of the calculus of vectors are found in math-
ematics textbooks. We urge the interested reader to con-
sult such books.
The primary aim of this chapter is to introduce those
parts of the calculus of vectors which will be needed in
order to understand the mathematics used in general rel-
ativity. The secondary aim is to prepare the readers for
more advanced topics, mathematical, physical and philo-
sophical.
1.2
Vectors as arrows
Vectors can be imagined as arrows. Like an arrow a vec-
tor points in a certain direction. Which direction? It is
important to note that the answer can be given without
introducing a coordinate system.
We have arrows in a room or outdoors. The arrows
can point towards the roof, a door, one’s grandmother
and so forth. The direction of the arrow is given by con-
crete things.
Thinking of the theory of relativity it is wise immedi-
ately to note that the length and direction of an arrow can
be related to other arrows. They can be compared. We
may move one vector to another without changing its di-
rection, so that the starting points (roots) of the vectors
touch each other. If the vector-arrows then lie along the
same line, the vectors are said to have the same direction.

1.2
Vectors as arrows
26
If the vectors do not lie along the same line, we use the
geometry of ‘daily life’ (see Ch.. 4) to specify the differ-
ence of direction. In Fig. 1.1 is shown two vectors with
equal magnitude, but different directions.
Figure 1.1: Vectors with different directions
The difference of length between two vectors may be
given by making small arrows which we call ‘unit vec-
tors’, and have a magnitude or length equal to one. A
line with unit vectors, and two vectors with magnitude 3
and 5, respectively, are drawn in Fig. 1.2.
If we ﬁnd an arrow at one place and want to com-
pare its direction with that of an arrow at another place,

we must perform a difﬁcult operation. We must ‘paral-
lel transport’ to the one we want to compare it to (see
Fig. 1.3). In daily life this can be done for example by
means of straight threads along which we slide the ends
of the arrows. Such procedures work well on a ﬂat sur-
face. However, difﬁculties will appear when we try to
perform such parallel transport over great distances on
the Earth, as the curvature of the Earth’s spherical sur-
face will disturb the result (see Fig. 9.2).
1.3
Vector ﬁelds
From now on vectors are no longer material arrows, but
arrows in a purely abstract sense. In what follows a ‘vec-
tor’ is a geometric quantity with geometrically deﬁned
‘magnitude’ and ‘direction’. However, just as there is a
correspondence between ordinary numbers and certain
physical quantities, such as for example temperature
(number of degrees) and length (number of centimetres),
there is a correspondence between vectors and a special
class of physical quantities; namely, those having a direc-
tion.
When we are outdoors in the wind, the moving air
ﬁlls the region around us. There is a measurable velocity
of the air everywhere in the region. In Fig. 1.4 we have
shown, as an illustration, a weather map with the wind
velocity ﬁeld over Europe on February 3, 1988. The veloc-

1.3
Vector ﬁelds
29
ity has a magnitude and a direction. It is a vector. Thus
a velocity ﬁeld is linked conceptually with every point of
the region. These abstract vectors are everywhere. If one
can think of God as omnipresent, then one might also be
able to think of vectors as omnipresent. In such a region
there is said to be a vector ﬁeld.
In order to be able to calculate with vectors, we must
have a practical means of specifying their directions and
magnitudes. Let us consider vectors on a ﬂat surface, say
on the sheet of paper you are writing on. Then we place
unit vectors along the horizontal edge at the bottom and
along the vertical left-hand edge of the sheet. These are
reference vectors.
Drawing equidistant parallels with unit distance be-
tween each, we obtain a grid (see Fig. 1.5).
Each cor-
ner is given a number containing ﬁgures; the ﬁrst ﬁgure
gives the distance of the point from the left edge of the
sheet, and the second ﬁgure its distance from the down-
ward edge. Imagine that each square is divided into four
smaller squares. Again each corner is given a two-ﬁgured
number. (The ﬁgures are not generally integer numbers.)
If this division is proceeded indeﬁnitely, we can associate
a number with every point of our sheet. Note also that
each point have different numbers. Such a set of num-
bers, by which we may specify the positions of arbitrary
points in a region, is called a coordinate system. There is
no reference to the grid we introduced originally, in the

deﬁnition of a coordinate system. The grid which is usu-
ally drawn on maps, or a globe, for example, is only of
heuristic help, making it easier to read off the position of
a point in the coordinate system.
As is well known by users of atlases, one can map
a region by means of different sorts of coordinate sys-
tems. The particular coordinate system that we have de-
scribed above, with vertical and horizontal straight axes,
is called a Cartesian coordinate system, in honour of the
great mathematician René Descartes (1596–1650).
The
horizontal axis is usually called the x-axis, and the ver-
tical axis the y-axis. The position of a point is given by a
number (x, y) relative to a chosen origin, which has coor-
dinates (0, 0).
By means of our coordinate-system we can specify the
magnitudes of the vectors in our vector-ﬁeld. In order
to be able to write a vector as the sum of ‘vector com-
ponents’ (see below) along the coordinate lines we intro-
duce reference vectors (see above) along these lines. They
are called basis vectors. The basis vectors are introduced
at every point in the region of interest. Generally the basis
vectors may have unequal directions and magnitudes at
different positions (see for example section 4.1.1, where a
system of plane polar coordinates is considered). Only in
the special case of a Cartesian coordinate system (in a ﬂat
space) do they have the same magnitude and direction all
over space.

1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimensions
33
At every point of an n-dimensional space there are n
basis vectors. There are, for example, two basis vectors at
every point of a surface. Having a coordinate system and
the associated basis vector ﬁeld at our disposal, we can
specify the components of, for example, a velocity vector
ﬁeld at every point in a region. By this means we shall be
able to develop the calculus of vectors.
1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimen-
sions
As to notation, vectors shall be denoted by placing an ar-
row above the letter. Thus, ‘A-vector’ is denoted by ⃗A.
Basis vectors are denoted by a the letter ‘e’ with an ar-
row and a subscript, which tells which basis vector we
are talking about, for example ⃗ex.
Consider a vector ⃗A. In Fig. 1.6 this vector is placed
in a two-dimensional coordinate-system. The coordinate
axes are straight lines. The difference between their di-
rections amounts to 90◦. They are said to be orthogonal
to each other. (This term will be used frequently in the
present text.)
We have a Cartesian coordinate system.
The basis vectors along the x-axis and y-axis, are writ-
ten ⃗ex and ⃗ey, respectively. The magnitude of a vector ⃗A
is designated by |⃗A| . The basis vectors ⃗ex and ⃗ey have per
deﬁnition magnitude equal to 1, |⃗ex| = |⃗ey| = 1.

1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimensions
34
Figure 1.6: Basis vectors and vector components

1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimensions
35
The quantities Ax and Ay in Fig. 1.6 will be called the
components of the vector ⃗A. (Note that in the calculus
of vectors it is usual to use the upper right sufﬁx to se-
lect a component rather than to indicate the exponent of
a power. Even if this may seem confusing at the begin-
ning, this notation is indispensable when one calculates
with vector components, and after a while its use will be
a matter of routine.) The vector components are deﬁned
as follows. Let a vector ⃗A be situated with its initial point
at the origin, as shown in Fig. 1.7.
Figure 1.7: Vector components
Then the components Ax and Ay are the coordinates
of the terminal point of ⃗A. They are not vectors, but or-
dinary numbers. Such numbers are called scalars. We

1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimensions
36
might have called them ‘scalar components’. Note that
the scalar components of a vector might be negative (for
example Ax < 0, if the vector points in the negative x
direction).
The vector quantities ⃗Ax and ⃗Ay (as shown in Fig. 1.6)
are termed the component vectors of ⃗A. In order to de-
ﬁne these we must ﬁrst consider products of scalars and
vectors.
If the scalar is equal to a number k, the product k⃗A
is deﬁned as a vector with magnitude k|⃗A|, and with the
same direction as ⃗A. With, for example k = 2, the mag-
nitude of the vector is doubled. If the scalar is a negative
number, −k, the product −k⃗A is deﬁned as a vector with
magnitude k|⃗A|, and with opposite direction to that of ⃗A.
If k = 0, we write k⃗A = ⃗0 and call ⃗0 the null vector. The
magnitude of the null vector is zero.
If two vectors ⃗A and ⃗B are parallel, there exists a scalar
k so that ⃗B = k⃗A. Thus ⃗A = (1/k)⃗B. One might also be
tempted to put ⃗B/⃗A = k. But division by a vector is not
deﬁned within the calculus of vectors.
We now have the necessary tools for deﬁning the com-
ponent vectors of ⃗A. The deﬁnition may be stated as fol-
lows: the component vectors of ⃗A are the products of
the components of ⃗A and the basis vectors. In the spe-
cial case considered above, with the vector ⃗A placed in a

1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimensions
37
two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate-system, we have
⃗Ax = Ax ⃗ex,
⃗Ay = Ay ⃗ey.
(1.1)
These equations, together with ﬁgures 1.6 and 1.7, offer a
clear picture of the link between the component vectors
⃗Ax, ⃗Ay and the (scalar) components Ax, Ay of a vector ⃗A.
We will now deﬁne addition and subtraction of vec-
tors. Consider two vectors ⃗A and ⃗B. The vector-sum of
⃗A and ⃗B is a new vector, which we shall designate by ⃗C.
The sum of two vectors is written in a similar way as the
sum of two real numbers,
⃗C = ⃗A + ⃗B.
(1.2)
However, the meaning of ‘+’ is different. Vector-addition
is deﬁned as follows. Let the initial point of ⃗B be posi-
tioned at the terminal point of ⃗A. Then ⃗C is the vector
with initial point at ⃗A’s initial point and terminal point at
⃗B’s terminal point. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.8.
Subtraction of two vectors is deﬁned as follows: ⃗A−⃗B
is that vector ⃗C which gives ⃗A when it is added to ⃗B. This
is illustrated in Fig. 1.9.
Let us now turn to Fig. 1.6 again. The component vec-
tors of ⃗A may be parallel transported so that we obtain
the ﬁgure 1.10. (The coordinate system is not drawn, only
the vectors.)

Figure 1.10: Decomposition of a vector
The ﬁgure shows that
⃗A = ⃗Ax + ⃗Ay.
(1.3)
The vector ⃗A is equivalent to the vector sum of ⃗Ax and ⃗Ay.
This is expressed by saying that ⃗A can be decomposed
into the component vectors ⃗Ax and ⃗Ay . From eqs. (1.1)
and (1.3) follow
⃗A = Ax⃗ex + Ay⃗ey
(1.4)
Note that the sum of the (scalar) components, Ax + Ay, is
different from the magnitude of ⃗A: |⃗A| ̸= Ax + Ay.

1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimensions

Applying the well-known result of Pythagoras, and of
less well-known Indian and Chinese mathematicians, to
ﬁgure 1.7, we get
|⃗A|2 = |⃗Ax|2 + |⃗Ay|2 = (Ax)2 + (Ay)2
(1.5)
(here the superscripts x and y denote ‘which component’,
and the superscripts 2 are exponents). Taking the square
root of each side of Eq. (1.5), we get the magnitude of ⃗A
in terms of its components
|⃗A| =
q
(Ax)2 + (Ay)2
(1.6)
The addition of two vectors, ⃗A + ⃗B, may be done by
adding their components. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.11,
which looks complicated, but has a fairly simple mean-
ing.
In mathematical form
⃗C = ⃗A + ⃗B ⇐⇒Cx = Ax + Bx,
Cy = Ay + By,
(1.7)
where the symbol ⇐⇒means mutual implication (equiv-
alence), and the comma symbolizes ‘and’.
There exist several different ‘products’ of vectors. In
the following we will only need the so-called dot product
or scalar product of two vectors. (A generalized version
of the dot product is involved in the relativistic expres-
sion for distance, which we shall consider in great detail

in ch. 5.) The dot product of ⃗A and ⃗B is denoted by ⃗A · ⃗B
and deﬁned as the magnitude of ⃗A times the magnitude
of ⃗B’s projection onto ⃗A. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.12.
Figure 1.12: Vector projection
The magnitude of ⃗B’s projection onto ⃗A is denoted by
|⃗B∥|. The dot product of ⃗A and ⃗B may thus be written
⃗A · ⃗B = ±|⃗A| · |⃗B∥|
(1.8)
(See points 5 and 6 below as to whether + or −is to be
used.) Some properties of this product should be noted.
1. The product is a scalar quantity.
2. ⃗B · ⃗A = ⃗A · ⃗B.

1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimensions
43
3. For vectors of given magnitude, the product has a
maximal value, equal to the magnitude of ⃗A times
the magnitude of ⃗B, if the vectors have the same di-
rection.
4. The value of the dot product is zero if the vectors
are orthogonal.
5. The dot product is positive if the projection of ⃗B
onto ⃗A has the same direction as ⃗A.
6. The product is negative if the projection of ⃗B onto ⃗A
is oppositely directed to ⃗A.
7. ⃗D · (⃗A + ⃗B) = ⃗D · ⃗A + ⃗D · ⃗B.
Property 1 follows immediately from the expression (1.8).
Property 2 is shown by considering Fig. 1.13.
Figure 1.13: Commutation of the dot product

1.4
Calculus of vectors. Two dimensions
44
The triangles OP1P2 and OQ1Q2 have the same shape.
It follows that |⃗B∥|/|⃗B| = |⃗A∥|/|⃗A|. Hence |⃗B|·|⃗A∥| = |⃗A|·|⃗B∥|
or ⃗B · ⃗A = ⃗A · ⃗B.
Properties 3 and 4 follow immediatley from Eq. (1.8)
and Fig. 1.12. Properties 5 and 6 are deﬁnitions. Property
7 is shown by considering Fig. 1.14. From the ﬁgure is
Figure 1.14: Associative rule
seen that |(⃗A + ⃗B)∥| = |⃗A∥| + |⃗B∥|. Multiplying each term
by the number |⃗D| gives |⃗D|·|(⃗A+⃗B)∥| = |⃗D|·|⃗A∥|+|⃗D|·|⃗B∥|.
Hence ⃗D · (⃗A + ⃗B) = ⃗D · ⃗A + ⃗D · ⃗B. Due to the property 2
it also follows that (⃗A + ⃗B) · ⃗D = ⃗A · ⃗D + ⃗B · ⃗D.
Since ⃗ex and ⃗ey are unit vectors and orthogonal to each
other, it follows from properties 2, 3 and 4 that
⃗ex · ⃗ex = 1,
⃗ey · ⃗ey = 1,
⃗ex · ⃗ey = 0,
⃗ey · ⃗ex = 0 (1.9)
We can now express the dot product of ⃗A and ⃗B by the
components of ⃗A and ⃗B. From equations (1.4), (1.9), the

1.5
Three and more dimensions
45
rule 7, and the product rule (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad +
bc + bd which is valid for vectors as well as for scalars,
we get (substitute Ax⃗ex for a, Ay⃗ey for b, Bx⃗ex for c and
By⃗ey for d)
⃗A · ⃗B = (Ax⃗ex + Ay⃗ey) · (Bx⃗ex + By⃗ey)
= AxBx ⃗ex · ⃗ex + AxBy ⃗ex · ⃗ey
+ AyBx ⃗ey · ⃗ex + AyBy⃗ey · ⃗ey
= (AxBx) 1 + (AxBy) 0
+ (AyBx) 0 + (AyBy) 1.
(1.10)
Since a number, such as AyBx, times zero is equal to zero,
this leads to
⃗A · ⃗B = AxBx + AyBy.
(1.11)
The expression (1.11) is not valid in arbitrary coordinates.
It is speciﬁc of Cartesian coordinates. In general the dot
products of the basis vectors must be included in the
component expression for the dot product of two vectors
(see Eq. (1.26)).
1.5
Three and more dimensions
Let us consider a three-dimensional generalization of
Fig. 1.6.
The vector ⃗A is now placed in a three-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system, as shown in ﬁg 1.15. Here ⃗B

1.5

46

1.5

47
is the projection of ⃗A in the (x, y)-plane. It will be useful,
in order to see more easily the geometrical contents of the
deductions below, to draw a new ﬁgure with coordinate
axes parallel to the old ones, but now through the root of
the vector ⃗A.
Figure 1.16: Vector components in three dimensions
As in the two-dimensional case, the vector compo-
nents are the coordinates of the terminal point of ⃗A when
it is situated with its initial point at the origin (see

1.5
Three and more dimensions
48
Fig. 1.16).
The component vectors of ⃗A are
⃗Ax = Ax⃗ex,
⃗Ay = Ay⃗ey,
⃗Az = Az⃗ez.
(1.12)
From Fig. 1.15 is seen that
⃗B = ⃗Ax + ⃗Ay,
⃗A = ⃗B + ⃗Az.
(1.13)
Thus
⃗A = ⃗Ax + ⃗Ay + ⃗Az
(1.14)
Inserting the expression (1.12) we get the component
form of the vector ⃗A
⃗A = Ax⃗ex + Ay⃗ey + Az⃗ez.
(1.15)
Also from Fig. 1.15, and using the Pythagorean theorem
as we did in the two-dimensional case in Eq. (1.5), it is
seen that
|⃗B|2 = |⃗Ax|2 + |⃗Ay|2,
|⃗A|2 = |⃗B|2 + |⃗Az|2,
(1.16)
so that
|⃗A|2 = |⃗Ax|2 + |⃗Ay|2 + |⃗Az|2 = (Ax)2 + (Ay)2 + (Az)2 (1.17)
Taking the square root of both sides of Eq. (1.17), we get
the magnitude of ⃗A in terms of its components
|⃗A| =
q
(Ax)2 + (Ay)2 + (Az)2.
(1.18)

1.5
Three and more dimensions
49
If two vectors ⃗A and ⃗B in a three-dimensional space are
added to give a third vector ⃗C, we obtain a projection
onto the (x, y) plane just like Fig. 1.8. The projection onto
the (x, z) and (y, z) planes are similar, and we obtain
⃗C = ⃗A + ⃗B ⇐⇒



Cx = Ax + Bx,
Cy = Ay + By,
Cz = Az + Bz.
(1.19)
This rule is valid in general: two vectors may be added
by adding their components.
Applying the multiplication rule (a + b + c)(d + e +
f) = ad + ae + af + bd + be + bf + cd + ce + cf, we
ﬁnd the expression of the dot product of two vectors in
a three-dimensional space, in terms of their components
in a Cartesian coordinate system (compare the expression
for the two-dimensional case in Eq. (1.10)
⃗A · ⃗B = (Ax⃗ex + Ay⃗ey + Az⃗ez)
· (Bx⃗ex + By⃗ey + Bz⃗ez)
= AxBx⃗ex · ⃗ex + AxBy⃗ex · ⃗ey + AxBz⃗ex · ⃗ez
+ AyBx⃗ey · ⃗ex + AyBy⃗ey · ⃗ey + AyBz⃗ey · ⃗ez
+ AzBx⃗ez · ⃗ex + AzBy⃗ez · ⃗ey + AzBz⃗ez · ⃗ez
= AxBx1 + AxBy0 + AxBz0
+ AyBx0 + AyBy1 + AyBz0
+ AzBx0 + AzBy0 + AzBz1
= AxBx + AyBy + AzBz.
(1.20)

1.5
Three and more dimensions
50
It is easily seen that the form of the equations character-
istic of three-dimensional vector calculus is exactly equal
to those of two dimensions (see Eq. 1.10)).
The generalization from three to n dimensions is sim-
ple as far as the mathematical expressions are concerned.
But convenient ﬁgures like 1.8 and 1.15 cannot be drawn
for the higher-dimensional cases. Intuitive presentation
is problematic, except as intuition of algebraic forms,
where this kind of computation, leading to Eq. (1.20), is
easy also in four or ﬁve dimensions. Any error is read-
ily seen by looking at the formal sequences of letters and
signs. Goethe said: “The value of mathematics is nothing
but that of forms” (“[. . . ] nichts wert als die Form.”)
Looking at Eq. (1.20), with its eight lines full of sym-
bols, it will be reasonable if you get a slight feeling of ter-
ror. We would like to make a digression here, telling you
about the intention of this text. We wish to lay before you
a text where the mathematical deductions are presented
in such detail that you may see what has been done math-
ematically in each step of the calculations. What you see
depends upon what you know. And as the text proceeds,
you will often ﬁnd references to equations earlier in the
book, as a reminder of the particular mathematical rule
that has been applied in a certain step.

The vector product

1.6
The vector product
In chapter 9 we need the concept of the vector product.
Two arbitrary vectors ⃗A and ⃗B deﬁne a plane, that of
the parallelogram between them. Let us choose a three-
dimensional coordinate system so that the vectors are ly-
ing in the (x, y)-plane. This is drawn in perspective in
Fig. 1.17. The vector product of ⃗A and ⃗B is denoted by
Figure 1.17: The vector product of ⃗A and ⃗B
⃗A × ⃗B, and is deﬁned as a vector, the ‘vector product vec-
tor’, whose magnitude is |⃗A||⃗B⊥|, where ⃗B⊥is the com-
ponent of ⃗B perpendicular to ⃗A. The direction of ⃗A × ⃗B
is normal to the plane containing ⃗A and ⃗B, with positive
sense such that ⃗A, ⃗B and ⃗A × ⃗B is oriented, as shown in
Fig. 1.17. This product is antisymmetric, meaning that the
sign of the product changes if the succession of the vec-

1.6
The vector product
52
tors changes, ⃗B × ⃗A = −⃗A × ⃗B. If ⃗A and ⃗B are parallel,
⃗B has no component perpendicular to ⃗A, and ⃗A × ⃗B = ⃗0.
In particular it follows that the vector product of a vector
with itself is equal to the null vector. Also, there are no
vector products in a two-dimensional space.
Figure 1.18: Parallelogram extended by ⃗A and ⃗B
In Fig. 1.18 we have drawn the parallelogram deﬁned
by the vectors ⃗A and ⃗B. We have also drawn a dotted line
from the end-point of vector ⃗B and perpendicular to the
vector ⃗A. If the triangle OQB is moved to the other side
of the parallelogram, a rectangle QPRB is formed with
the same area as the triangle. The area of the rectangle,
and thus of the parallelogram, is the length of ⃗A times the
height QB. This height is just the component of ⃗B perpen-
dicular to ⃗A. It follows that the magnitude of the vector

The vector product

product ⃗A × ⃗B is equal to the area of the parallelogram
deﬁned by these vectors. The vector product ⃗A × ⃗B can
therefore be said to represent the area as a vector quantity.
From the deﬁnition of the vector product follows that
the non-vanishing vector products of the basis vectors in
a Cartesian coordinate system, are (see Fig. 1.19)
⃗ex × ⃗ey = −⃗ey × ⃗ex = ⃗ez,
⃗ey × ⃗ez = −⃗ez × ⃗ey = ⃗ex,
⃗ez × ⃗ex = −⃗ex × ⃗ez = ⃗ey.

Figure 1.19: Vector products of basis vectors in Cartesian
coordinates
Usually when we apply the calculus of vectors to
physical problems, we concentrate on one direction at a
time. We calculate with components. This will be the case

1.6
The vector product
54
for example in chapter 9 where we shall apply the vector
product in connection with the curvature of spacetime.
Therefore we shall need the component expression of the
vector product.
In our Cartesian coordinate system the component
forms of the vectors ⃗A and ⃗B are
⃗A = Ax⃗ex+Ay⃗ey+Az⃗ez,
⃗B = Bx⃗ex+By⃗ey+Bz⃗ez. (1.22)
Making a calculation similar to that in Eq. (1.20), but us-
ing now, Eq. (1.21) and the rule ⃗A×(⃗B+⃗C) = ⃗A×⃗B+⃗A×⃗C,
we arrive at
⃗A × ⃗B = (Ax⃗ex + Ay⃗ey + Az⃗ez)
× (Bx⃗ex + By⃗ey + Bz⃗ez)
or, after expanding the right-hand side,
⃗A × ⃗B = AxBx ⃗ex × ⃗ex + AxBy ⃗ex × ⃗ey
+ AxBz ⃗ex × ⃗ez + AyBx ⃗ey × ⃗ex
+ AyBy ⃗ey × ⃗ey + AyBz ⃗ey × ⃗ez

+ (AxBy −AyBx) ⃗ez.

Note that the components of the vector product are
antisymmetric in the indices, meaning that if the succes-
sion of the indices are reversed, the components change
sign (due to the minus signs in the expression). The same
happens if the components of ⃗A and ⃗B are exchanged.
The geometrical meaning of this is that ⃗B × ⃗A = −⃗A × ⃗B,
i.e. exchanging the succession of the vectors reverses the
direction of the vector product vector.
1.7
Space and metric
We shall anticipate a little, and give you a glimpse of top-
ics that will be treated at length later in this text. In order
to be able to use the mathematical machinery that have
been developed so far, we shall in this section assume
that space is ﬂat (as has been assumed also in the earlier
sectons). However we shall now permit the use of arbi-
trary coordinates. Concrete examples will be thoroughly
treated in chapters 4 and 6. The generalization to a math-
ematical structure which may be applied to curved space
will be given in ch. 5.
The general concept of space is such that we, with a
suitable metaphor, can put different kinds of coordinate
systems into a space. However, not any coordinate sys-
tem! For example you cannot cover the spherical sur-
face of the Earth by a two-dimensional Cartesian coor-

1.7
Space and metric
56
dinate system in which the coordinate curves are every-
where straight lines orthogonal or parallel to each other.
If you try to construct straight, parallel coordinate lines
on a sphere, you will ﬁnd that they will cross each other
at two points, for example at the poles. The conclusion is:
you need curved coordinate systems to cover curved surfaces.
In the general theory of relativity gravitation is de-
scribed in terms of curved four-dimensional spacetime.
So
in
this
theory
curved
coordinate
systems
are
inevitable.
It will be useful to introduce some notational conven-
tions. Coordinates of spacetime are written xµ, i.e. with
Greek indices, and spatial coordinates are written xi, i.e.
with Latin indices. Here µ and i are not exponents, but
labels indicating the coordinate in question. The three
spatial coordinates are indicated by xi,
i = 1, 2, 3. In a
Cartesian coordinate system this means x1 = x, x2 = y,
and x3 = z. The four coordinates of spacetime are indi-
cated by xµ,
µ = 1, 2, 3, 4. Again, in a Cartesian co-
ordinate system this means x1 = x, x2 = y, x3 = z, and
x4 = ct, where c is the velocity of light. Note that x4 is a
time coordinate representing time as measured in a unit
of length.
In Sect. 1.4 we introduced the basis vectors ⃗ex and ⃗ey
of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The
basis vectors of an arbitrary coordinate system, {xµ, µ =
0, 1, 2, . . .} or {xi, i = 1, 2, . . .}, are denoted by ⃗eµ or

1.7
Space and metric
57
⃗ei, i.e. the index of an arbitrary basis vector is just the
number of the coordinate and not the coordinate itself.
However, when we specialize to a certain basis vector in
a speciﬁed coordinate system, the coordinate is inserted
as index of the basis vector. For example, if we consider
⃗e2 with x2 = θ, we insert ⃗eθ for ⃗e2.
The basis vectors of an arbitrary coordinate system are
neither orthogonal to each other, nor are they unit vec-
tors. It follows that the dot products of the basis vectors
are arbitrary functions of position. The dot products of
basis vectors in spacetime are termed gµν and in space
gij. We may then write, for the dot products of any two
basis vectors ⃗eµ and ⃗eν in four-dimensional spacetime
gµν ≡⃗eµ · ⃗eν, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4
ν = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(1.24)
where the symbol ≡means ‘deﬁned as’. From the gener-
alization of Eq. (1.9) to three dimensions we understand
that a three-dimensional Cartesian system is character-
ized by
g11 = g22 = g33 = 1,
g12 = g13 = g23 = g21 = g31 = g32 = 0.
(1.25)
Hence, for all Cartesian coordinate systems gii = 1, which
means that the basis vectors have unit length, and gij = 0
for i ̸= j (where ̸= means ‘different from’), which says
that all the dot products of two different basis vectors
are zero, meaning that the vectors are orthogonal to each

1.7
Space and metric
58
other. In general gµν or gij characterizes the angles of all
pairs of basis vectors and their magnitudes in a coordi-
nate system of a space. The quantities gµν and gij are
said to tell us the metric of the spacetime and space, re-
spectively. So you hear professionals frequently ask each
other: “Well, but what is the metric of the spacetime you
now are talking about?”
The general expression of the dot product of two vec-
tors in three-dimensional space is
⃗A · ⃗B = Ai⃗ei · Bj⃗ej = ⃗ei · ⃗ejAiBj = gijAiBj,
(1.26)
where one is to summarize over the range of indices that
appear in products as a subscript in one factor and as
a superscript in the other. This is Einstein’s summation
convention.
The efﬁciency of Einstein’s summation convention
can be seen by applying it to calculate the dot product of
two vectors in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate
system, for instance,
⃗A · ⃗B =g11A1B1 + g12A1B2 + g13A1B3
+ g21A2B1 + g22A2B2 + g23A2B3
+ g31A3B1 + g32A3B2 + g33A3B3.
(1.27)
Using Eq. (1.27) and inserting 1 = x, 2 = y, and 3 = z,

1.7
Space and metric
59
for the indices, we get
⃗A · ⃗B = 1 (AxBx) + 0 (AxBy) + 0 (AxBz)
+ 0 (AyBx) + 1 (AyBy) + 0 (AyBz)
+ 0 (AzBx) + 0 (AzBy) + 1 (AzBz)
= AxBx + AyBy + AzBz
(1.28)
as in Eq. (1.20).
The distance vector between two points that are in-
ﬁnitesimally close to each other is denoted by ⃗dr. (Fur-
ther explanation of this notation is given in the next chap-
ter.) The components of ⃗dr are called coordinate differen-
tials and are written dxi. If i = 1, 2, 3 then
⃗dr = dxi⃗ei = dx1⃗e1 + dx2⃗e2 + dx3⃗e3.
(1.29)
(Note that here dx2 is not dx squared, but refers to the
second component of ⃗dr.) The squared distance between
the points is denoted by ds2. Using Eqs. (1.28) and (1.24)
we get
ds2 = ⃗dr · ⃗dr = dxi⃗ei · dxj⃗ej = ⃗ei · ⃗ejdxidxj
= gijdxidxj.
(1.30)
The corresponding expression for the squared ‘distance’
between two points in spacetime is
ds2 = gµνdxµdxν.
(1.31)

1.7
Space and metric
60
This is a highly condensed and very famous formula. If µ
and ν go from 1 to 4 the far right-hand side is the sum of
4×4 = 16 terms. Equations (1.30) and (1.31) show that the
general expression for distance in arbitrary coordinates
involves the components, gij or gµν, of the metric. That is
the main reason for the name ‘metrical’—it ‘measures’.
Equation (1.31) generalizes the Pythagorean theorem
to a form which is valid in an arbitrary coordinate system
in a space with an arbitrary number of dimensions. The
most simple application of this equation is to calculate
the distance of two nearby points on a (two-dimensional)
plane in terms of the coordinate differentials dx and dy
in a Cartesian coordinate system. In this case
g11 = g22 = 1,
g12 = g21 = 0.
(1.32)
From Eq. (1.30) we then get
ds2 = gijdxidxj
= g11dx1dx1 + g12dx1dx2
+ g21dx2dx1 + g22dx2dx2
= (dx1)2 + (dx2)2.
(1.33)
Using that dx1 = dx and dx2 = dy we get
ds2 = dx2 + dy2.
(1.34)
This, we see, is in fact the usual form of the Pythagorean
theorem!

1.7
Space and metric
61
In what is called a ‘ﬂat’ space one may deﬁne dis-
tance vectors ⃗r of ﬁnite magnitude.
This is not possi-
ble in a so-called curved space. The surface of a sphere
is a two-dimensional curved space in three-dimensional
Euclidean (ﬂat) space.
Let us jump from geometry to
physics and ‘apply’ the geometry of spheres to a phys-
ical object, for instance the Earth, with its physical sur-
face. Consider a distance vector from, say, the North Pole
to a point on the Equator. The vector-arrow, which is
straight in the usual Euclidean meaning of this word, will
go through the Earth, beneath the surface.
For two-
dimensional creatures, whose universe is the surface of
the sphere, this distance vector simply does not exist.
Therefore, in general there will exist only inﬁnitesimally
short distance vectors in a curved space.
Three points may be noted. Firstly, the picture of vec-
tors as straight arrows is a metaphor of great heuristic
help, but is not needed in the calculus of vectors. Sec-
ondly, in connection with curved spaces vectors are de-
ﬁned in tangent spaces (see ch. 3).
The tangent space
of the North Pole of the Earth, for example, is an Eu-
clidean plane touching the North Pole. And a vector rep-
resenting, say, the wind velocity at the North Pole may
be thought of as an arrow in this tangent plane. Thirdly,
ﬁnite distances can be deﬁned in curved spaces. They
are calculated by adding inﬁnitely many inﬁnitesimally
small distances along a curve between the point whose

1.7

62
distance we are going to ﬁnd. This is performed by inte-
gration, which will be introduced in section 3.5.

Chapter 2
Differential calculus
This chapter is written for those people who have the
courage to approach the mathematics of general relativ-
ity without being familiar with differential calculus. The
use of this fabulous creation by Newton and Leibniz is
essential and omnipresent on our way to Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations.
2.1
Differentiation
In Fig. 2.1 we have drawn Cartesian coordinates and a
curve.
Five lines lead from a point P on the curve to
points Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, also on the curve. If we con-
tinue plotting lines like that, the Q’s approach P indeﬁ-
nitely. They are said to approach the tangent line at P.
The lines PQ1, PQ2, PQ3, PQ4, and PQ5 have different
63

2.1
Differentiation
64
slopes in relation to the x-axis. The slope of the curve
at a point P is deﬁned as the slope of the tangent line at
P. Knowing the slope of a curve at any point, and the
Figure 2.1: A curve
value of the function at one point, we can plot the curve
(Fig. 2.2). If the the tangent lines are close enough the
curve ‘plots itself’. Could we ﬁnd simple expressions for
the slope of those lines, that is, for the slope of the curve
itself? The slope k of a line is quantitatively expressed by
what we shall call the ‘slope quotient’ deﬁned as ‘incre-
ment in y-direction divided by increment in x-direction’

In Fig. 2.2 the slope quotient at P is 1/5 = 0.20. The slopes
of the series of lines PQ1, PQ2, PQ3, . . . in Fig. 2.2 are ex-
pressed by the same sort of quotient as that of the line
pictured in Fig. 2.3. Their slope quotients approach that
of the tangent line, as Qn approaches P.
The slope quotient of the curve on Fig. 2.2 increases
continuously, from less than 1/5 to a fairly big number.
That of Fig. 2.3 seems to start from zero and remain there
for a while, like a straight line parallel to the x-axis.
A word of caution: not all curves have a tangent at ev-

2.1
Differentiation
67
ery point. If the curve has a sharp corner at a point it does
not have a tangent at that point. Also, if the curve has a
vertical step (the vertical interval is not reckoned as part
of the curve), then it is disconnected for a certain value of
x, say x = x1. This is called a discontinuity. If the curve
is the graph of a function, the function is said to have a
discontinuity at x = x1. A curve does not have a tangent
at a discontinuity. We shall assume that the functions we
need to consider, are such that their graphs have one def-
inite tangent line at every point, i.e. that the functions are
continuous and their graphs are without sharp corners or
discontinuous steps. If you inspect Fig. 2.4 you will see
that a new notation has been introduced. The ﬁgure sug-
gests that we move along a curve, called a parabola, with
equation y = x2, a short distance from P to Q. If P is an
arbitrary point on the curve, we denote the coordinates
of P by x and y, and Q has coordinates x+∆x and y+∆y,
where ∆x (‘delta x’) is a small increment added to x, and
∆y a corresponding (i.e. related to ∆x and the steepness
of the curve, see Fig. 2.4) small increment of y.
In the new notation we may now express in a gen-
eral way the slope quotient of the curve making use of
Eq. (2.1), one page 66:
(y + ∆y) −y
(x + ∆x) −x = ∆y
∆x.
(2.2)
However close the points P and Q on a curve may be,
there is a deﬁnite quotient ∆y/∆x. When points on the

2.1

2.1
Differentiation
69
fairly simple curves (graphs of continuous and singular-
ity free functions) we shall study are brought closer and
closer, the quotient approaches a deﬁnite limit, which
represents the slope of the curve at the point P. There
is a symbol for the approach towards this ‘limit’ which
some of us ﬁnd quite elegant:
lim
∆x→0
∆y
∆x.
(2.3)
Let us now consider the curve in Fig. 2.4 as the graph
of a function y = f(x). The limit (2.3) changes when x
varies except when the curve, in our wide sense of the
term, is a straight line. Therefore the limit is evidently a
function of x, and is called the derivative of f(x). Note that
f(x) and the derivative of f(x) are two different functions.
The process of ﬁnding the derivative is not called deriva-
tion but ‘differentiation’. As could be expected there are
many symbols expressing this crucial notion. The most
intuitively powerful is perhaps dy/dx. Since y = f(x) we
may also write df(x)/dx and df/dx. The shortest nota-
tion is f′(x) or y′.
It was the great Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz who ﬁrst
used this elegant notation:
f′(x) ≡dy
dx ≡lim
∆x→0
∆y
∆x = lim
∆x→0
f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
.
(2.4)
Note that the limit in Eq. (2.4) is well-deﬁned only if

2.1
Differentiation
70
the curve y = f(x) is continuous. Functions can only be
differentiated where they are continuous.
The material world is not continuous. At small dis-
tances the discontinuity of the atomic world appears.
Such discontinuities are neglected when we apply the dif-
ferential calculus to the description of the world, which
we do in the general theory of relativity. Then we idealize
the world as a continuum. This is, however, an eminently
adequate idealization for the purpose of describing most
macroscopic phenomena.
The derivative, as deﬁned in Eq (2.4), is simply an ex-
pression of the slope of a curve. Since this is identical to
the direction of the tangent at any point of a curve, the
derivative is an expression of the slope of the tangent line
at any point of the curve.
We shall now introduce a new concept called the dif-
ferential.
In Fig. 2.5 we have drawn the graph of a function
y = f(x) and a tangent line of the curve in the neigh-
bourhood of a point P with x-coordinate x0. The tangent,
which is called the linearization L(x) of f, has constant
slope quotient, k = ∆L/∆x. Then k = ∆L/∆x = f′(x0),
since the slope of the tangent is equal to the slope of the
curve at x0. It follows that the increment of the lineariza-
tion of f as x increases by ∆x is ∆L = f′(x0)∆x. The quan-
tity ∆L is called the differential of f and will be denoted

2.1
Differentiation
71
Figure 2.5: The tangent line at P
by Df. Hence
Df = f′(x0)∆x.
(2.5)
The increment ∆f of f as x increases by ∆x is ∆f = f(x0 +
∆x)−f(x0). Later (see Eq. 2.93) we shall show that if ∆x is
small, the difference between the differential Df and the
increment ∆f of f is given by a sum of terms proportional
to increasing powers of ∆x, starting by (∆x)2. This means
that when we calculate to ﬁrst order in ∆x, this difference
may be neglected.

2.2
Calculation of slopes of tangent
lines
Let us as a ﬁrst example consider the function
y ≡f(x) = x2.
(2.6)
Writing x1 for x + ∆x and y1 for y + ∆y the expression for
the slope quotient takes the form
∆y
∆x = y1 −y
x1 −x .
(2.7)
According to Eq. (2.6), y = x2, and y1 = x2
1. Hence we can
do a ﬁrst calculation, using the rule a2−b2 = (a−b)(a+b)
y1 −y
x1 −x = x12 −x2
x1 −x = (x1 −x)(x1 + x)
x1 −x
= x1 + x.
(2.8)
When x1 approaches x, the quantity x1 +x approaches 2x.
In symbols (with y = x2)
lim
∆x→0
∆y
∆x = lim

x1 −x = lim
x1→x (x1 + x) = 2x.
(2.9)
From Eq. (2.9) we conclude
if
y ≡f(x) = x2
then
dy
dx = 2x.
(2.10)

2.2
Calculation of slopes of tangent lines
73
The derivative of y = x2 is simply 2x. Geometrically this
means that at any point (x1, y1) the slope of the curve in-
creases proportionally to x1, as is illustrated in Fig. 2.6.
Note that the derivative of a function is itself a function.
Figure 2.6: The slope of the curve y = x2
When x changes, the derivative changes accordingly.
Our next example involves a little more calculation
with fractions, but will be needed below. We shall ﬁnd

(2.12)
As a third example let us take the derivative of the
derivative of f(x) = x2. This derivative is called a deriva-
tive of the second order with respect to x2, or the second
derivative of f(x), and is denoted by d2f/dx2. This time
we get
d2f
dx2 = lim

2 [(x + ∆x) −x]

∆x = 2.
(2.13)
The geometrical meaning of this result will be made clear
in section 2.5. Note, however, that a ‘constant function’,
f(x) = k, for instance where k = 2, corresponds geomet-
rically to a horizontal straight line. There is no slope; the
derivative of a constant function is zero. In the section
on series expansions we shall need the following conse-
quence of this: The third derivative of x2 is zero, and so
on for the fourth, the ﬁfth and sixth derivative and so on.

2.3
Geometry of second derivatives
75
We shall often use a couple of elementary rules:
1. The derivative of the sum of two or more functions
is equal to the sum of their derivatives.
2. The derivative of the product of a constant and a
function is equal to the constant times the derivative
of the function.
Example 2.1 Using the results that the derivative of x2 is 2x,
the derivative of x is 1, and the derivative of a constant is zero,
we obtain: if y = ax2 + bx + c, then dy/dx = 2ax + b.
2.3
Geometry of second derivatives
Each curve we talk about in this section is assumed to
be the graph of a function f(x). The function value f(x)
gives the height y above the x-axis of a point on the curve
y = f(x). The ﬁrst derivative gives the change of height
per unit distance in the x-direction. Consider the function
y = 2x. For x = 1 we then have y = 2, for x = 2 we have
y = 2 × 2 = 4, for x = 3 we have y = 2 × 3 = 6, and so
on. The change of y is the double of the change of x. The
rate of change is constant. The derivative is a constant,
namely 2. It determines the slope of the curve.
The second derivative gives the rate of change of the
slope with distance in the x-direction. The second deriva-
tive of y = 2x, that is, the ﬁrst derivative of 2, is zero, as

2.4
The product rule
76
it should be. But for y = x2, the second derivative is not
zero, but is a constant: y′ = 2x, y′′ = 2. The slope of the
curve changes with x, and the value ‘2’ is a measure of
the change.
A straight line, i.e. a line which is not curved, has a
constant slope. The more a curve curves, the faster its
slope changes, and the larger is the value of the second
derivative of the corresponding function f(x). There is a
close relation between the second derivative of a function
and the curvature of its graph. This will be discussed in
more detail in chapter 9.
2.4
The product rule
We shall now ﬁnd a formula showing how the slope
changes along the graph of a function which is the prod-
uct of two other functions. Let
y = f(x)g(x),
y + ∆y = f(x + ∆x)g(x + ∆x).
(2.14)
We can get an expression for ∆y by subtracting y from
(2.14) i.e. ∆y = (y + ∆y) −y
∆y = f(x + ∆x)g(x + ∆x) −f(x)g(x).
(2.15)
In order to arrive at a limit analogous to that of Eq. (2.4)
we use a trick, adding and subtracting in Eq. (2.15) the
same expression, that is since −f(x)g(x + ∆x) + f(x)g(x +

2.4
The product rule
77
∆x) = 0, the right-hand side of Eq. (2.15) can be written
as

g(x + ∆x)
+
5
f(x)
6
g(x + ∆x) −
7
f(x)
8
g(x).
(2.16)
From the terms marked 1, 2, 3, and 4 we form the expres-
sion g(x + ∆x)[f(x + ∆x) −f(x)], and from the functions
5, 6, 7, and 8 we form f(x)[g(x + ∆x) −g(x)]. Dividing by
∆x we get the formula
∆y
∆x = g(x + ∆x)f(x + ∆x) −f(x)
∆x
+ f(x)g(x + ∆x) −g(x)
∆x
.
(2.17)
From now on it is getting easier. We proceed to the limit
where ∆x →0. In the ﬁrst term at the right-hand side we
can then use the limiting value

The product rule

Consequently, looking at Eqs. (2.17) and (2.18), and then
at (2.17) together with (2.19) and (2.19), we ﬁnd
d [f(x)g(x)]
dx
= g(x)df(x)
dx
+ f(x)dg(x)
dx .
(2.21)
Perceptually clearer
[f(x) g(x)]′ = g(x)f′(x) + f(x)g′(x).
(2.22)
Perceptually? Visually? What is the relevance in math-
ematics? Ideally no relevance, in practice quite central.
A professional glances half a second at a formidable for-
mula with 1000 signs, calmly announcing: “There is a
mistake—here”. What a formidable intellect, what a deep
understanding, we are apt to think.
But the expert is
likely only to have activated his perceptual apparatus,
nothing more. (His ‘gestalt vision’ I (A.N.) would say,
as a philosopher.) The equation (2.21) has nearly half a
hundred separate meaningful signs, Eq. (2.22) has 28. We
are now offering a version of the product rule with only
12 signs. Let us pose
u ≡f(x),
v ≡g(x).
(2.23)
From this emerges supreme simplicity and surveyability:
(uv)′ = vu′ + uv′.
(2.24)

2.5
The chain rule
79
In words: The derivative of the product of two functions
is equal to the second function multiplied by the deriva-
tive of the ﬁrst function plus the ﬁrst function multiplied
by the derivative of the second.
Example 2.2 Find the derivative of y = x3.
Writing u for x2 and v for x, that is uv for x3, the use of
Eqs. (2.24) and (2.10) gives us
(x3)′ = (x2 × x)′ = x(x2)′ + x2 × x′ = x × 2x + x2 × 1 = 3x2.
2.5
The chain rule
What is the derivative of the more complicated function
y = (x2 + 3)3? Here, too, we can ﬁnd a simple rule which
is called ‘the chain rule’. What is inside the parenthesis
is itself a function of x, and we may easily perceive what
is to be done by denoting it by a letter of its own, say, u.
Accordingly, y = u3 with u = x2 + 3. The function y may
then be written
y(u) = y[u(x)].
(2.25)
We may think of this function in two ways; either as a
function y(u) of u, or as a composite function y[u(x)] of x,
i.e. a function of a function.

2.5
The chain rule
80
Let us now free ourselves of the particular example
y = (x2 + 3)3 and consider two arbitrary functions y(u)
and u(x). We shall deduce a formula for the derivative of
the composite function y[u(x)]. Here y is called the outer
function and u the inner function. According to Eq. (2.5)
the differential of y is
Dy = y′(u) × ∆u,
(2.26)
where ∆u is the increment of u as x increases by ∆x, and
the differential of the function u(x) is
Du = u′(x) × ∆x.
(2.27)
As noted above the difference between ∆u and Du is
given by a sum of terms proportional to increasing pow-
ers of ∆x, starting by (∆x)2. We shall take the limits ∆u →
0 and ∆x →0, so it will be sufﬁcient to calculate to ﬁrst
order in ∆u and ∆x. Hence it is sufﬁcient to use the ap-
proximations Dy ≈∆y and Du ≈∆u. From Eqs. (2.26)
and (2.27) we then get
∆y ≈y′(u) × u′(x)∆x.
(2.28)
The increments ∆y and ∆x are ﬁnite quantities. Hence
we may divide by ∆x, and get
∆y
∆x ≈y′(u) × u′(x).
(2.29)

2.5
The chain rule
81
Taking the limit ∆x →0 we get
lim
dx→0
dy
dx = lim
dx→0
∆y
dx = y′ = y′(u) × u′(x).
(2.30)
This is the chain rule for differentiation of a composite
function. It may be phrased as follows: The derivative
of a composite function is equal to the derivative of the
outer function with respect to the inner function multi-
plied by the derivative of the inner function.
Sometimes the notation with a quotient of two dif-
ferentials is convenient when we write the derivative of
a function. Using this notation the chain rule takes the
form
dy
dx = dy
du × du
dx = y′(u) × u′.
(2.31)
As a simple application of the chain rule we shall differ-
entiate y = (x2 + 3)3. Here y = u3 and u = x2 + 3. Using
the result of the example above with x replaced by u, we
may write
dy
du = 3u2
(2.32)
or
dy = 3u2du.
(2.33)
If we divide each of the differentials by dx we obtain
y′ = dy
dx = 3u2du
dx = 3u2u′.

(2.35)
2.6
The derivative of a power func-
tion
We can use the product rule and the chain rule to ﬁnd
the derivative of the function f(x) = xp, where p is a real
number.
Equation (2.10)) and Example 2.1 suggest that (xn)′ =
nxn−1 if n is an integer number. This can easily be proved
by so-called mathematical induction.
The formula is
clearly correct for n = 1, in which case (x1)′ = x0 ≡1.
If we now assume that the formula is valid for xn−1,
then (xn−1)′ = (n −1)xn−2. By means of the product rule
we get, by setting u = x and v = xn−1
(xn)′ = (x × xn−1)′ = x(n −1)xn−2 + 1 × xn−1
= [(n −1) + 1]xn−1 = nxn−1.
(2.36)
We now know
1. the rule is valid for x = 1, and

2.6
The derivative of a power function
83
2. if the rule is valid for xn−1, then it is also valid for
xn, with n as an integer number.
These are the two criteria for the proof by mathematical
induction. We have now proved the rule for the case that
p is an integer number, p = n.
Note that by inserting n = 3, we get the result of the
above example. Furthermore the rule is correct for n =
0, in which case it gives (x0)′ = 0, which is obviously
correct since x0 = 1 is a constant function. Its graph is a
horizontal line with vanishing slope, i.e. the derivative of
a constant is zero. From Eq. (2.12), noting that 1/x = x−1
and 1/x2 = x−2, follows that the rule is also valid for n =
−1, which will be used in the next section.
Is it possible to prove that the rule is valid also if p is
a fraction? Consider a function u = x1/n, where n is an
integer number. This function is deﬁned in the following
way

x1/nn
= x.
(2.37)
Hence
un = x.
(2.38)
Here u is a function of x. Differentiation by means of the
rule (2.36) and the chain rule leads to
nun−1 × u′ = 1.
(2.39)

2.7
Differentiation of fractions
84
Dividing by nun−1 on both sides gives
u′ =
1
nun−1.
(2.40)
Remember also that un = x and u = x1/n. Then we get
u′ =

x1/n′
=
1
nun−1 =
u
nun = x1/n
nx = 1
nx(1/n)−1. (2.41)
Thus
(xp)′ = pxp−1
(2.42)
is valid also when p is a fraction of the form p = 1/n,
which is sufﬁcient for our applications later on.
Let us differentiate the square root of x, which is de-
ﬁned by
√x ≡x1/2.
Using the rule (2.42), we get
 √x

2.7
Differentiation of fractions
In chapter 44 we shall need to differentiate fractions of
functions. By means of the product rule, the chain rule

2.7
Differentiation of fractions
85
and the rule for differentiating power functions, we shall
deduce the rule for differentiating such a fraction. Let
u(x) and v(x) be functions of x. We ﬁrst consider the func-
tion
y[v(x)] = 1/v = v−1.
(2.43)
The chain rule, in the form (2.29) with u replaced by v ,
gives
y′ = y′(v) × v′.
(2.44)
From the rule (2.42) with p = −1 we get
y′(v) = (v−1)′ = −v−2 = −1
v2.
(2.45)
These equations lead to
1
v
′

(2.46)
The product rule (2.22) with f = u and g = 1/v gives

u

′
= u′
v + u

−1
v

v −uv′

(2.48)
Multiplying the ﬁrst term at the far right-hand side by v
in the numerator and the denominator, and putting the

2.8
Functions of several variables
86
two terms on a common denominator, we ﬁnally arrive
at
u
v
′
= u′v −uv′
v2

(2.49)
This is the rule for differentiating a fraction of two func-
tions.
2.8
Functions of several variables
Geometrical pictures of functions of one variable, y =
f(x), are conveniently drawn as curves on an (x, y) plane.
In this case the value of f is the distance (in the y direc-
tion) from the x axis to a point on the curve. But, in-
evitably, we have to proceed to functions of several vari-
ables. Functions with two variables, z = f(x, y), can be
illustrated on paper, but not so easily. They are pictured
as surfaces in three-dimensional space, not curves. In this
case the value of the function f is the height above the
(x, y) plane of a point on the surface with coordinates
(x, y, z) in the three-dimensional space (see Fig. 2.8 be-
low).
In the above sections we have seen how the change of
a function of one variable with position is described by
the derivative of the function. The increase of a function
f(x, y) of two variables may be divided into two parts:

2.8
Functions of several variables
87
The increase
∆xf ≡f(x + ∆x, y) −f(x, y)
(2.50)
that f gets by a displacement ∆x along the x-axis, and the
increase
∆yf ≡f(x, y + ∆y) −f(x, y)
(2.51)
it gets by a displacement ∆y along the y-axis. Mathe-
matically such variations are described by what is called
‘partial derivatives’ of a function of several variables.
The partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and
y, respectively, are deﬁned by
∂f
∂x ≡∂f(x, y)
∂x
≡lim
∆x→0
f(x + ∆x, y) −f(x, y)
∆x
= lim
∆x→0
∆xf

(2.52)
and

∂y
≡lim
∆y→0
f(x, y + ∆y) −f(x, y)
∆y
= lim
∆y→0
∆yf
∆y .
(2.53)
The partial derivative of f with respect to x is calculated
by differentiating f with respect to x while keeping y con-
stant, and the partial derivative of f with respect to y
is calculated by differentiating f with respect to y while
keeping x constant.

2.8
Functions of several variables

Figure 2.7: A rectangular garden
We shall illustrate these new concepts by referring to
an increase of the area of a rectangular garden.
The
Euclid-loving owner introduces a Cartesian coordinate
system, as shown in Fig. 2.7. Let the function f(x, y) rep-
resent the area of the garden,
f(x, y) = xy.
(2.54)
Let us consider two ways by which the owner may in-
crease the area of the garden. Firstly he may extend it
only in the x-direction; keeping y constant and increas-
ing x by ∆x. The corresponding increase of the area is
given by Eq. (2.53),
∆xf = (x+∆x)×y−xy = xy+∆x×y−xy = y∆x. (2.55)

2.8
Functions of several variables
89
This is just the area of the column with width ∆x and
height y. Secondly he may extend the garden in the y-
direction; keeping x constant and increasing y by ∆y.
Then the increase of area is
∆yf = x(y + ∆y) −xy = x∆y.
(2.56)
The partial derivatives of f are now found by dividing
Eq. (2.50) by ∆x and Eq. (2.51) by ∆y, taking the limits
∆x →0, ∆y →0 and applying the deﬁnitions (2.52) and
(2.53). The result is
∂f
∂x = y,
∂f
∂y = x
with
f(x, y) = xy.
(2.57)
The change of height of the surface by a small displace-
ment in arbitrary direction, with component ∆x along the
x-axis and component ∆y along the y-axis, is
∆f = f(x + ∆x, y + ∆y) −f(x, y).
(2.58)
Generalizing the deﬁnition (2.5) of the differential of a
function of a single variable, we deﬁne the total differ-
ential of a function f(x, y) of two variables, as
Df = ∂f
∂x∆x + ∂f
∂y∆y.
(2.59)
To ﬁrst order in ∆x and ∆y there is no difference between
the increment ∆f and the differential Df of f. The total

2.8
Functions of several variables
90
differential may therefore be used to calculate how the
value of a function changes by small increments of the
variables x and y. These increments are usually called co-
ordinate differentials, and are denoted by dx and dy. With
this notation the expression for a total differential takes the
form
Df = ∂f
∂xdx + ∂f
∂ydy.
(2.60)
Using Einstein’s summation convention as introduced in
Eq. (1.26) in Ch. 1, this may be written
Df = ∂f
∂xidxi,
(2.61)
where x1 = x and x2 = y in the present case. (Remember
that the numbers 1 and 2 are not exponents, but indices
of coordinate axes.)
Let us illustrate the concept ‘total differential’ by go-
ing back to the example with the garden. The ﬁnite incre-
ment of the area of the garden is
∆f = (x + ∆x)(y + ∆y) −xy
= xy + x∆y + y∆x + ∆x∆y −xy
= x∆y + y∆x + ∆x∆y.
(2.62)
Since ∆x and ∆y are small the product ∆x∆y is a ‘small
quantity of the second order’. In short, it is very, very
small. When ∆x and ∆y are one to a million, ∆x∆y is one

2.8
Functions of several variables
91
to a million millions. Geometrically it is the area of the
small rectangle with sides ∆x and ∆y at the upper right-
hand corner of the garden in Fig. 2.7. If we are interested
in changes of the area to ﬁrst order in the differentials, we
can neglect products such as ∆x∆y, which gives
Df = xdy + ydx.
(2.63)
Further examples:
Example 2.3 We consider a hill described by the function
f(x, y) = x3y2.
(2.64)
The surface of the hill is illustrated in Fig. 2.8.
Figure 2.8: The function f(x, y) = x3y2

2.8
Functions of several variables
92
Let us ﬁrst differentiate f while y is kept constant. Then we
get
∂f
∂x = 3x2y2.
Then we differentiate while x is kept constant,
∂f
∂y = x32y = 2x3y.
Using Eq. (2.60) we get the total differential
Df = ∂f
∂xdx + ∂f
∂ydy = 3x2y2dx + 2x3ydy.
Example 2.4 Let us, as a reasonably obvious generalization,
consider an example with three variables.
g(x, y, z) = x2y3z.
Then
∂g
∂x = 2xy3z,
∂g
∂y = 3x2y2z,
∂g
∂z = x2y3,
and
Dg = 2xy3zdx + 3x2y2zdy + x2y3dz.
The above excessively complicated relations are found by
easy, elegant manipulations of symbols.

Einstein’s ﬁeld equations are ‘second order partial dif-

Just as the multiplication of 5 by 6 yields the same num-
ber as the multiplication of 6 by 5, successive differenti-
ation with respect to x and then with respect to y, yields
the same result as successive differentiation ﬁrst with re-
spect to y and then with respect to x. This is expressed
mathematically by
∂2f
∂y∂x =
∂2f
∂x∂y,
(2.66)
which means that different succession of differentiation
does not affect the result. (The proof is of an advanced
mathematical character and is not needed in our text.)

The MacLaurin and the Taylor se-
ries expansions
Most functions are more complicated and difﬁcult to
work with than power functions. It was therefore a very
useful mathematical result, when the Scottish mathemati-
cian Colin MacLaurin (1698–1746) and the English math-
ematician Brook Taylor (1685–1731) made clear that most
functions can be approximated by sums of power func-
tions, called power series expansions. Such expansions
will be applied in chapter 9 in our discussion of curva-
ture.
Most anecdotes about the mathematical genius Carl
Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) are likely to require consid-
erable mathematical knowledge, but one is rather inno-
cent. Carl was a small boy when the tired teacher, hoping
to get some rest, asked his pupils to for the sum of the ﬁrst
hundred numbers. To his annoyance Gauss practically at
once raised his hand. He wrote from left to right 1, 2,
3,. . . , 50, then, on the next line, 100, 99, 98,. . . , 51, and on
the third line he added the above, getting 50 equal sums
101, 101, 101,. . . , 101. Multiplying 101 with 50 he came
up with the correct answer: 5050.
If 100 is replaced by an arbitrary natural number n,
the formula Gauss found for the sum of the n ﬁrst natural

2.9
The MacLaurin and the Taylor series expansions
95
numbers, is
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n = (1 + n)n
2 .
(2.67)
Such a sum is called a ﬁnite series, meaning that it is a
sum of a ﬁnite number of terms. When the number of
terms increases indeﬁnitely, the sum of this particular se-
ries does the same. The resulting inﬁnite series is then said
to diverge. There are, however, series with an inﬁnitely
large number of terms which have a deﬁnite sum. Even
in the case that the sum is ﬁnite, in which case the series
is said to converge, such a series is called an inﬁnite series.
A particularly nice example of a convergent inﬁnite
series is 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · with |x| < 1. In this sum
one gets the next term multplying the last one by x. Such
a series with inﬁnitely many terms is called an ‘inﬁnite
geometrical series’. Note that for |x| < 1 each term is less
than the foregoing. Let Sn denote the sum of the ﬁnite
series,
Sn = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn.
(2.68)
Multiplying the left-hand side, and each term on the
right-hand side, by x,
xSn = x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn + xn+1.
(2.69)
Subtracting each side of (2.68) from each side of (2.69)
leads to
Sn −xSn = 1 −xn+1
(2.70)

2.9
The MacLaurin and the Taylor series expansions
96
or
(1 −x)Sn = 1 −xn+1.
(2.71)
Hence
Sn = 1 −xn+1
1 −x .
(2.72)
If |x| < 1, each multiplication of x by itself gives a smaller
number. Then limn→∞xn+1 = 0, and the series with in-
ﬁnitely many terms has a ﬁnite sum equal to
S =
1
1 −x.
(2.73)
The ﬁnal result may be written as follows
1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · =
1
1 −x,
|x| < 1.
(2.74)
Letting x = 1/k we have an example of a convergent inﬁ-
nite series
1 + 1
k + 1
k2 + · · · =
1
1 −1/k,
k > 1.
(2.75)
Here k is a real number. The left-hand side of Eq. (2.75)
is meant to represent an inﬁnite number of terms with
values indicated by the ﬁrst three ones that have been
written down. The right-hand expression is the sum of
all these terms. If k = 2, for example, the equation turns

2.9

8 + 1

=
1
1 −1/2 =

1/2 = 2.
(2.76)
Following MacLaurin and Taylor we now write a func-
tion f(x) as a sum of power functions, i.e. as a power series
expansion
f(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · ,
|x| < 1.
(2.77)
Here a0, a1, a2, . . . are numbers which depend upon the
function f(x).
We shall now show how these numbers are deter-
mined by the values of the function and its derivatives
at the point x = 0. Looking at Eq. (2.77) we see that if we
insert the value x = 0 all terms on the right-hand side are
equal to zero except the ﬁrst one. This leads to
a0 = f(0).
(2.78)
We now differentiate both sides of Eq. (2.77), using
Eq. (2.42),
f′(x) = 1a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + 4a4x3 + · · · .
(2.79)
Putting x = 0 we get
a1 = f′(0).
(2.80)

2.9
The MacLaurin and the Taylor series expansions
98
The rest of the coefﬁcients a2, a3, . . . can be determined
in a similar way. Let us ﬁnd the second and third deriva-
tives of f(x)
f′′(x) = 1×2a2+1×2×3a3x+1×2×3×4a4x2+· · · . (2.81)
f′′′(x) = 1 × 2 × 3a3 + 1 × 2 × 3 × 4a4x + · · · .
(2.82)
Putting x = 0 in these equations give
a2 = f′′(0)
1 × 2,
a3 =
f′′′(0)
1 × 2 × 3.
(2.83)
Inserting these results in Eq. (2.77) we obtain a nice for-
mula
f(x) = f(0)+ f′(0)
1
x+ f′′(0)
1 × 2x2 +
f′′′(0)
1 × 2 × 3x3 +· · · . (2.84)
If we continue the differentiation we can get any of the
coefﬁcients ai expressed through derivatives of f(x) at
x = 0. The resultant inﬁnite series is called the MacLaurin
series.
We shall consider, as an illustration, an example that
shall be employed in chapter 9; the MacLaurin series of
the function f(x) = 1/
√
1 −x2 = (1 −x2)−1/2. In order
to differentiate this function we write it as a composite
function, f[g(x)], where f(g) = g−1/2, and g(x) = 1 −x2.

From these expressions follow
f(0) = 1,
f′(0) = 0,
f′′(0) = 1.
Substituting this into Eq. (2.84) gives

(2.85)
The third term of the series, which we have not written
down, is proportional to x4, the next one to x6, and so
on. For small x, say x smaller that 0.01, x4 < (0.01)4 =
0.00000001, showing that these higher order terms are
then so small as to be negligible. For such small values

(2.86)
This approximate expression is useful because the right-
hand side is easier to handle mathematically.
A second example is the MacLaurin series of the func-
tion f(x) =
√
1 −x = (1 −x)1/2. Differentiation gives
f′(x) = (1/2)(1 −x)−1/2(−x′) = (−1/2)(1 −x)−1/2. Thus
f(0) = 1 and f′(0) = −1/2, which gives

For small values of x we can apply the approximation

(2.88)
The MacLaurin series is a series expansion of a function
at the point x = 0, that converges for |x| < 1. This means
that the value of the function at an arbitrary point inside
the interval −1 < x < 1, can be found by adding terms
with the values of the function and its derivatives cal-
culated at the point x = 0. If, on the other hand, x is
near a point outside this interval, for example x = 2, the
MacLaurin series is of no use. Then one needs a general-
ization of the MacLaurin series. One needs an expansion

about an arbitrary point, say x = a. This is called the Tay-
lor series, and will be used later in our road to Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations.
In order to arrive at the Taylor series, we introduce a
function F(x) deﬁned by
F(x) = f(x0 + x)
(2.89)
where x0 is a ﬁxed value of x. Differentiation gives
F′(x) = f′(x0 + x),
F′′(x) = f′′(x0 + x),
F′′′(x) = f′′′(x0 + x),
· · · .
(2.90)
Inserting x = 0 leads to
F(0) = f(x0),
F′(0) = f′(x0),
F′′(0) = f′′(x0),
F′′′(0) = f′′′(x0),
· · · .
(2.91)
The MacLaurin series for the function F(x) is
F(x) = F(0) + F′(0)
1
x + F′′(0)
1 × 2x2 +
F′′′(0)
1 × 2 × 3x3 + · · · .
Substituting from Eq. (2.90), we get

1
x + f′′(x0)
1 × 2 x2 +
f′′′(x0)

Adding inﬁnitely many terms we get the Taylor series.

Substituting a coordinate increment ∆x for x, the cor-

Chapter 3
Tangent vectors
Curves of particular interest in physics are those repre-
senting paths of moving particles. Such curves may be
described by giving the coordinates of the particle as
functions of time. In the following we shall consider the
path of a particle thrown horizontally, as an illustrating
example (see Fig. 3.1).
3.1
Parametric description of curves
In chapter 2 (see Fig. 2.4) we became familiar with the
parabola, given by
y = x2.
(3.1)
Consider a similar parabola, curving downwards instead
of upwards, see Fig. 3.1.
103

3.1
Parametric description of curves
104
Figure 3.1: Parabola
The equation of this parabola is
y = −x2.
(3.2)
The path of a free-falling particle moving from the origin
of the coordinate system with a horizontal initial velocity,
has the shape of such a parabola.
In order to describe, and understand, the motion of
particles, it is useful to describe the components of the
motion in the x direction and the y direction separately.
The curve followed by the particle is then described by
giving, not y as a function of x, but by giving both x and
y as functions of a variable t,
x = x(t),
y = y(t).
(3.3)

3.1
Parametric description of curves
105
The variable t is termed a parameter. Describing a curve
in this way, we give a ‘parametric representation’ of the
curve.
In the case of our particle moving horizontally away
from the origin, the x and y coordinates can be given as
functions of the parameter t as
x = t,
y = −t2
(3.4)
which represents the parabola given in Eq. (3.2).
The coordinates x and y tell the position, in the (x, y)
plane, of points on the curve, and thus determine its
shape. The parameter t may be thought of as a kind of co-
ordinate along the curve. The value of t indicates where
on the curve a certain point is. To every point on the curve
there corresponds a certain value of t, and all points on
the curve have different values of t.
A few more examples will make you a little more fa-
miliar with the ‘parametric representation of curves’.
Consider a certain curve, given by the parametric
form
x = t,
y =
p
1 −t2.
(3.5)
In order to ﬁnd the shape of the curve we can substitute
different values of t, calculate the corresponding values
of x and y, and then draw the curve through the points
that have been found. Alternatively we may eliminate t
from the parametric equations and thereby ﬁnd an equa-
tion between x and y, from which one can identify the

3.1
Parametric description of curves
106
curve (if it is reasonably simple). Since
x2 = t2,
y2 = 1 −t2,
(3.6)
the curve represented by Eq. (3.5) has the equation
x2 + y2 = 1.
(3.7)
This equation describes a circle with centre at the origin
and radius 1 (see Fig. 3.2). From the ﬁgure is seen that
Eq. (3.7) is just an expression of the Pythagorean theo-
rem. For an arbitrary curve the distance from the origin
to a point on the curve, r =
p
x2 + y2, depends upon the
position of the point. However, in the case of a circle this
distance is the same for all points on the curve, equal to
the radius of the circle. In Fig. 3.2 we have drawn a circle
with radius r = 1.
Subtracting x2 from both sides of Eq. (3.7) gives
y2 = 1 −x2.
(3.8)
Taking the positive square root we ﬁnd y as a function of
x
y =
p
1 −x2.
(3.9)
The graph of this function is only the upper half of the
circle.
A whole circle cannot be represented as the graph of
a single function. This is due to the fact that to every
value of the variable x there corresponds only one value

3.1
Parametric description of curves
107
Figure 3.2: Circle with unit radius centered at the origin

3.2
Parametrization of a straight line
108
of the function y. So a graph of a single function cannot
have two points with the same value of x and different
values of y. However, by giving x and y as functions of
a parameter, as in Eq. (3.6), one obtains a representation
of the whole of an arbitrary curve, whether it is open or
closed or even when it intersects itself.
Another example: A curve is given by the parametric
representation
x = 7t −3,
y = −49t2 + 42t −9.
(3.10)
Identify the curve! There is something suspicious about
the expression for y: 49 = 72, 9 = 32, 42 = 2 · 7 · 3. The
expression for y is quadratic; y = −(7t −3)2. (Remember
the rule (a + b)2 = a2 + 2 · a · b + b2. Here a = 7t and
b = −3.) Eq. (3.10) implies that x2 = (7t −3)2. Thus
y = −x2,
which is again the parabola of Eq. (3.2). Evidently one
and the same curve can be represented in inﬁnitely many
ways.
3.2
Parametrization of a straight line
A straight line L can be identiﬁed by giving its direc-
tion and a point P0 that it passes through. Let the point

3.2
Parametrization of a straight line
109
P0 have Cartesian coordinates (x0, y0, z0), and let a cer-
tain vector, ⃗v, specify the direction of the line (compare
Eq. (1.15)
⃗v = vx⃗ex + vy⃗ey + vz⃗ez.
(3.11)
This is illustrated in Fig. 3.2. A vector from the origin to a
Figure 3.3: Parametrisation of a line
point is called the position vector of the point. The position
vector of P0, and an arbitrary point P on the line L with
coordinates (x, y, z) are, respectively
⃗r0 = x0⃗ex + y0⃗ey + z0⃗ez,
⃗r = x⃗ex + y⃗ey + z⃗ez.
(3.12)
The vector from P0to P is t⃗v. Here t is a scalar quantity
which determines how far the point P is removed from
P0. The quantity t is the curve parameter. From Fig. 3.2
and the rule for vector addition (see Fig. 1.8) we get
⃗r = ⃗r0 + t⃗v.
(3.13)

3.2
Parametrization of a straight line
110
Substitution from Eqs. (3.11) and (3.12) gives
⃗r = x⃗ex + y⃗ey + z⃗ez
= x0⃗ex + y0⃗ey + z0⃗ez + tvx⃗ex + tvy⃗ey + tvz⃗ez
= (x0 + tvx)⃗ex + (y0 + tvy)⃗ey + (z0 + tvz)⃗ez.
(3.14)
This is the component form of Eq. (3.13) in three dimen-
sions. If two vectors are equal, then all their components
must be equal. Thus, in a three-dimensional space the
vector equation (3.13) leads to the three scalar equations
x = x0 + tvx,
y = y0 + tvy,
z = z0 + tvz.
(3.15)
These are the equations of a straight line in parametric
form. The usefulness of this form is easy to see. Think
of the line L in Fig. 3.2 as the path of a particle moving
without being acted upon by any forces. Then t is the
time, and the particle passes P0 at the time t = 0 and P at
time t.
Let us for a moment go back to Eq. (3.13). It is a mar-
velously simple equation, especially when you realize
that it is valid for lines in spaces of any dimension; it
holds for vectors in 5 or 55 dimensions (see Ch. 9) as el-
egantly as on a plane. However, the component form of
the vector equation for 55 dimensions is, if not compli-
cated, at least rather long. On the right-hand side of the
equivalent of Eq. (3.15) you ﬁnd a sum of 55 terms.

Tangent vector ﬁelds

3.3
Tangent vector ﬁelds
In section 1.3 we introduced the term ‘vector ﬁeld’ rep-
resenting the wind in a region, the air above Western Eu-
rope. Roughly a vector ﬁeld is a continuum of vectors ﬁll-
ing a region. The vectors representing the wind velocity
was
implicitly
assumed
to
exist
in
a
ﬂat
three-
dimensional region. However, the spacetime of general
relativity is curved. We need to become acquainted with
vectors in curved spaces.
A problem immediately ap-
pears. Vectors are drawn as arrows. And these arrows
are straight in the usual Euclidean sense. They are usu-
ally drawn in a ﬂat (x, y) plane.
Imagine instead that the vectors are drawn on a spher-
ical surface.
The expression ‘two-dimensional curved
space’ means just such curved surfaces. If a vector-arrow
could exist in such a curved two-dimensional space, it
would have to curve in order not to point out of the space,
at least if the vector arrow has a ﬁnite length. However,
curved vector arrows are not allowed! The conclusion is
that vectors of ﬁnite length do not exist in curved spaces. (In-
ﬁnitely short vectors, however, are allowed as far as their
departure from the curved space can be neglected.)
The simplest example of a curved space is a space of
only one dimension: a curve. We cannot deﬁne ﬁnite vec-
tors on a curve. But look at Fig. 2.2. There a curve is
generated by a succession of tangent lines. Each of the

3.3
Tangent vector ﬁelds
112
tangent lines are straight. Such a line is called the tangent
space of the curve at a point. The tangent space is ﬂat.
Even if we cannot deﬁne vectors in the one-dimensional
space deﬁned by the curve, we can do something which
will turn out to be very useful: we can deﬁne a succession
of tangent vectors along the curve. They can be drawn as
straight arrows along the tangent lines. If we deﬁne a tan-
gent vector at every point of the curve, we have what is
a called a tangent vector ﬁeld in a one-dimensional curved
space. The vectors of the tangent vector ﬁeld exist in a
succession of different tangent spaces along the curve.
These concepts are readily generalized to spaces of
higher dimensions. For example the tangent space of the
surface of the Earth at the North Pole is a plane touching
the North Pole. Now, think of a vector representing the
velocity of the drifting ice at the North Pole. Imagine that
no vertical extension exists. The world is just the two-
dimensional surface of the Earth. And the ice exists on
this surface. The velocity vector of the ice, however, ex-
ists in the tangent plane, i.e. in the ﬂat two-dimensional
tangent space to the surface of the Earth at the North Pole.
In curved four-dimensional spacetime one can deﬁne
vectors of ﬁnite length at each point. They exist in the ﬂat
four-dimensional tangent spacetime at each point. We
shall need these concepts in Chapter 9 where curvature is
discussed.
Now we go back to our simple one-
dimensional space: the curve.

3.3
Tangent vector ﬁelds
113
Let a curve be given parametrically by x = x(t), y =
y(t). The tangent-vector ⃗u of the curve at a point P is an
arrow with inital point at P and directed along the curve
in the direction of increasing values of the parameter t.
In any dimension and in any coordinate system the
components of ⃗u are deﬁned by
ui ≡dxi
dt .
(3.16)
Here i refers to the i’th component. Thus
⃗u = ui⃗ei = dxi
dt ⃗ei.
(3.17)
In the case that a curve lies in a plane the tangent vector ⃗u
may be decomposed in a two-dimensional Cartesian co-
ordinate system. Then Eq. (3.16) represents the two com-
ponent equations
ux = dx
dt
and
uy = dy
dt ,
(3.18)
and Eq. (3.17) reduces to
⃗u = ux⃗ex + uy⃗ey = dx
dt⃗ex + dy
dt⃗ey.
(3.19)
Consider again the parabola given by equation (3.2).
In this case
ux = dx
dt = 1
and
uy = dy
dt = −2t,
(3.20)

3.3
Tangent vector ﬁelds
114
showing that the tangent vector ﬁeld of the parabola is
⃗u = ⃗ex −2t⃗ey.
(3.21)
Since t = x according to equation (3.2), we get
⃗u = ⃗ex −2x⃗ey.
(3.22)
Thus the x-component of this vector ﬁeld is constant, and
the y-component is proportional to the distance from the
origin along the x-axis. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.4. The
tangent vector ﬁeld is the inﬁnite manifold of vectors with
initial points along the curve.
The initial points trace
completely the curve.
Here ux = 1, uy = −1 at x = 1 and ux = 1, uy = −2 at
x = 2.
As a second example consider a straight line,
x = at + b
and
y = ct + d.
(3.23)
The line has a constant tangent vector ﬁeld
⃗u = a⃗ex + c⃗ey.
(3.24)
The components of a tangent vector are deﬁned, as said
above, as ux = dx/dt and uy = dy/dt (when the curve is
in a two-dimensional space). You can therefore use your
old knowledge of differentiation when you are going to
calculate the components of a tangent vector.

Differential equations and Newton’s 2. law
116
Tangents that we learned about in school had no def-
inite length. We drew them suitably long on our paper,
and were told that mathematically they would go on in-
deﬁnitely. A decisive character of a tangent vector is its
ﬁnite length, u. In Fig. 3.4 we see that the length or mag-
nitude is that of a hypothenus of a right angled trian-
gle. This makes the calculation of its length an easy un-
dertaking: u2 = (ux)2 + (uy)2. Using Eq. (3.20) we get
u2 = 12 + (−2t)2 = 1 + 4t2 or u =
√
1 + 4t2. For t = 0 we
get u = 1. That is, having chosen 1 as the magnitude of
⃗ex, the tangent vector with root at point (0, 0), goes along
the x axis from 0 to 1. At the point with t = 5 the tangent-
vector is already fairly long,
√
12 + 4 · 52 =
√
101 ≈10
units, and like the curve itself approximating the vertical
slope.

Differential equations and New-
ton’s 2. law
Curves representing paths of moving particles are of par-
ticular interest in physics. According to classical dynam-
ics these curves are ﬁxed if you know the positions and
velocities of the particles at any moment and the forces
acting upon them.
Isaac Newton (1642–1727) postulated that the acceler-
ation of a particle is proportional to the force acting upon

3.4
Differential equations and Newton’s 2. law
117
it. (The relativistic generalization of this will be consid-
ered in chapter 11.) This is Newton’s second law. It is the
most fundamental equation of Newtonian dynamics, and
provides us with the Newtonian equations of motion of the
particles.
Let us consider motion in one dimension, say along
the x-axis, in order to simplify the mathematics. Velocity
is deﬁned as rate of change of position with time. In sec-
tion 2.1 we noted that the derivative of a function y with
respect to a variable x represents the rate of change of y
with x. Now, the position x of the particle is a function of
the time, t. Thus, the velocity is the derivative of x with
respect to t
v = dx
dt.
(3.25)
Acceleration is deﬁned as the rate of change of velocity
with time,
a = dv
dt.
(3.26)
It follows that the acceleration is the second derivative of
the position with respect to time
a = d2x
dt2 .
(3.27)
Newton’s second law says that the force F acting upon
a particle with mass m is equal to its mass times its accel-

3.5
Integration
118
eration,
F = md2x
dt2 .
(3.28)
The corresponding vector equation is
⃗F = m⃗a.
(3.29)
The forces acting upon a particle may depend both on
the position of the particle and upon time. We shall here
consider forces that depend upon the position, but that
do not change with time. Then the position of the parti-
cle will appear in the expression of the force on the left-
hand side of Eq. (3.28), and derivatives of the position on
the right-hand side. Equations containing both a function
and derivatives of the function, are called differential equa-
tions. If the equation contains only the ﬁrst derivative, it
is called a ﬁrst order differential equation. If it contains
second derivatives, it is called a second order differential
equation, and so forth.
If the expression of a certain force, acting upon a par-
ticle, is inserted in Newton’s second law the resulting
equation is a second order differential equation, which
may be said to ‘determine’ the motion of the particle.
3.5
Integration
Having found the equation of motion of a particle, one
wants to solve it in order to ﬁnd the position of the par-

119
ticle as a function of time. Solving a differential equation
one needs to perform a mathematical operation which
is the ‘opposite’ of differentiation. One might say that
one needs to ‘antidifferentiate’ an expression. This oper-
ation, which is called integration, will now be brieﬂy ap-
proached in a highly simpliﬁed manner.
The antiderivative, F(x), of a function y = f(x) is de-
ﬁned as that function whose derivative is equal to f(x),
dF
dx = f(x).
(3.30)
The antiderivative is expressed by a special sign
F(x) =
Z
ydx =
Z
f(x)dx
(3.31)
and is called the indeﬁnite integral of the function f(x).
Let us consider an example. We know from Eq. (2.42)
that the derivative of xp is equal to pxp−1, or increasing
the exponent by 1,
 xp+1′ = (p + 1)xp.
(3.32)
Dividing by p + 1 we get

1
p + 1xp+1
′
= xp
with
p ̸= −1.
(3.33)
Hence, xp+1/(p+1) is that function whose derivative is xp.
Because the derivative of a constant is zero, we can add

3.5
Integration
120
a constant C to the function. Hence, we have calculated
the whole class of integrals!
Z
xpdx =
1
p + 1xp+1 + C.
(3.34)
Putting for example p = 2, we get
Z
x2dx = 1
3x3 + C,
(3.35)
where C is called a ‘constant of integration’.
We shall now give a geometrical interpretation of the
integral. Consider the graph of a function y = f(x) as
shown in Fig. 3.5. Let us try to calculate the area of the
region bounded by the graph, the x-axis, and the vertical
lines x = a and x = b. In general the shape of the graph
is curved, so this is indeed not a trivial task.
The ﬁrst known solution to this problem is due to
Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). Newton and Leibniz man-
aged to construct a general method, independently of
each other, about three hundred years ago. Their inge-
nious construction made clear that there is an intimate
connection between the mathematical representation of
an area and the concept of an integral perceived as an an-
tiderivative.
We start by deﬁning an area function A(x), which rep-
resents the hached area in Fig. 3.5 bounded by the y and
the x axis, the graph, and a vertical line with an arbitrary

3.5
Integration
121
Figure 3.5: Geometrical interpretation of integration
x-coordinate. Clearly, A(x) grows when x increases. In-
creasing x by a small value ∆x, A will increase by a small
value ∆A. Consider the small column drawn from the x-
axis to the graph. The left side of the column has position
x and the right side has position x + ∆x. Its width is ∆x.
The height of the left side of the column is y = f(x), and
of the right side y+∆y. If we cut the top of the column by
a horizontal line where its left side meets the parabola, it
will be shaped like a rectangle with width ∆x and height
f(x). The area of this rectangle is ∆A = f(x)∆x, neglecting
a small triangular area on the top of the column. Divid-
ing by ∆x on both sides and taking the limit ∆x →0, we

3.5
Integration
122
get
lim
∆x→0
∆A
∆x = f(x).
(3.36)
Comparing with the deﬁnition (2.4) we see that the area
function A(x) has f(x) as its derivative. This means that
the area function is the antiderivative, or the integral, of
f (x), which was the great result of Newton and Leibniz.
Looking at the ﬁgure it it also clear that the area function
vanishes at x = 0, i.e. A(0) = 0. Thus we can deﬁne the
area function formally by
A(x) ≡F(x) −F(0),
(3.37)
where F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x) as given in
Eq. (3.31).
The area, Aab, between a and b is equal to the area
from the y-axis to b minus the area from the y-axis to a.
Hence,
Aab = A(b) −A(a).
(3.38)
Inserting the right-hand side of the deﬁnition (3.37) leads
to
Aab = F(b) −F(0) −[F(a) −F(0)]
= F(b) −F(0) −F(a) + F(0) = F(b) −F(a).
(3.39)
The area between a and b is written
Aab =
Z b
a
f(x)dx
(3.40)

3.5
Integration
123
and is said to be the integral of f(x) from a to b. It is called
a deﬁnite integral. We now have the following formula for
calculating a deﬁnite integral
Z b
a
f(x)dx = F(b) −F(a)
(3.41)
which is a fundamental equation in the calculus of inte-
gration. The right-hand side is calculated by ﬁrst insert-
ing the number at the top of the integral sign, called the
upper integration limit, in the antiderivative, and then
subtracting the value obtained when the lower integra-
tion limit is inserted into the antiderivative.
Let us consider an example, the area of the region en-
closed by the parable y = x2, the x-axis and the vertical
lines x = 1 and x = 3, as shown in Fig. 3.6. According to
Eq. (3.40) this area is given by the deﬁnite integral
A13 =
Z 3
1
x2dx.
(3.42)
First we ﬁnd the indeﬁnite integral
F(x) =
Z
x2dx = 1
3x3 + C.
(3.43)
We may omit the constant C because it will be cancelled
in the subtraction. Hence,
A13 = F(3) −F(1) = 1

We have developed the concept of a deﬁnite integral
as an area. That is, however, not necessary. Integrals,
deﬁnite as well as indeﬁnite, are of great use in prac-
tically all ﬁelds where mathematics is applied. It may
be used, for instance, to calculate the distance a planet
moves along its elliptical path and with varying velocity.
In such applications the integral is not something given.
One has to deduce it. Then one ﬁrst calculates a very
small change of the quantity one is to calculate. This cor-
responds to calculating the area of the small column of
Fig. 3.6, dA = ydx = x2dx. Having obtained this the
calculation proceeds by applying Eq. (3.41).
We now have a powerful mathematical tool which we
can use to ﬁnd the path of a particle from a knowledge of
the forces acting upon it, and the position and velocity at
a certain moment.

The exponential and logarithmic
functions
The power function y = xr of a positive real variable x,
where r is a real number, is a function satisfying the fol-
lowing three rules
xp · xr = xp+r
and
xp

(3.46)
The last equation in (3.46) is the rule for taking the r’th
root of xp. Note that the second of Eqs. (3.44) with p = r
gives x0 = 1, and that the same equation with p = 0 gives
1/xr = x−r.
The power function has the variable x as the base and a
constant exponent. The exponential function on the other
hand, is deﬁned as a function with a constant base and
the variable x as exponent, y = ax.
The inverse of a function y = f(x) is deﬁned as the func-
tion obtained by exchanging x and y in the expression for
f(x), and then solving the resulting equation with respect
to y. The graph of a function and the graph of its inverse
are symmetrical about the line y = x, as shown in Fig. 3.7.
A new function, the so-called natural logarithm, was
introduced by the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler
(1707–1783). It was a great and useful mathematical in-
vention, based on Euler’s discovery of a particular num-
ber, e, deﬁned by

(3.47)
Inserting large values of n this number can be calculated
as accurately as one wants. To ﬁfteen decimal places, for

127
Figure 3.7: A function and its inverse
example, the value is
e = 2.718281828459045.
The natural logarithm is denoted by ln x and is deﬁned
as the inverse function of the exponential function ex, i.e.
y = ln x ⇔x = ey.
(3.48)
Since e0 = 1, it follows that ln 1 = 0. Also, since x = e for
y = 1, we have ln e = 1.
We shall now deduce the most important rules for cal-
culating with the natural logarithm. Let x = ln a and
z = ln b. Then a = ex and b = ez. Using the rule (3.44)
we get ab = exez = ex+z. According to Eq. (3.48) this is

3.6
Exponential and logarithmic functions
128
equivalent to ln(ab) = x+z. Inserting the expressions for
x and z we have the rule
ln(ab) = ln a + ln b.
(3.49)
Similarly, since a/b = ex/ez = ex−z,
ln
a

= ln a −ln b.
(3.50)
Let now a = ln xr. This is equivalent to ea = xr. Taking
the r’th root of each side, using the second rule in (3.46),
we obtain x = ea/r, which is equivalent to ln x = a/r.
Multiplying each side of this equation by r we have a =
r ln x. From the two expressions for a we obtain the rule
ln xr = r ln x.
(3.51)
We shall now calculate the derivative of the natural
logarithm. Let y = ln x. An increment ∆x in x produces
an increment ∆y in y, given by
∆y = ln(x + ∆x) −ln x = ln x + ∆x

(3.52)
where we have used the rule (3.50). The derivative is
given by the limiting value of this expression as ∆x →0.
In order to simplify the calculation, we introduce a num-
ber n by ∆x/x = 1/n, so that ∆x →0 corresponds to

(3.53)
where we have used the rule (3.51) in the last step. Using
Eq. (3.47) we get

x ln e.
Hence, since ln e = 1, the derivative of the natural loga-
rithm is
(ln x)′ = 1

(3.54)
Let u(x) be a function of x. Using Eq. (3.54) and the chain
rule for differentiation, we get
(ln u)′ = 1
uu′ = u′
u .
(3.55)
Since ‘integration is the opposite of differentiation’, we
have the integral
Z 1
xdx = ln x + C.
(3.56)

3.6
Exponential and logarithmic functions
130
This completes Eq. (3.33) for p = −1. Note also, from
Eq. (3.55) that
Z u′
u dx = ln u + C,
(3.57)
for an arbitrary function u of x. In words: the integral
of a fraction in which the numerator is the derivative of
the denominator, is equal to the natural logarithm of the
denominator.
Let us consider an example. We shall ﬁnd the integral
of the function 2x/(x2 + 1). Then we write u = x2 + 1 and
get u′ = 2x. Thus, we have
Z
2x
x2 + 1dx =
Z u′
u dx = ln u + C = ln(x2 + 1) + C.
We shall now ﬁnd the derivative of the exponential func-
tion y = ax. This is most easily done by ﬁrst taking the
(natural) logarithm of each side, and then differentiating.
Applying at ﬁrst the rule (3.51) we get ln y = x ln a. Dif-
ferentiation by means of the rule (3.55) gives y′/y = ln a.
Multiplying each side by y leads to y′ = y ln a. We have
thereby obtained the formula
(ax)′ = ax ln a.
(3.58)
Since ln e = 1 we also have
(ex)′ = ex.
(3.59)

It follows immediately that

(3.60)
3.7
Integrating equations of motion
A particle moving in three-dimensional space will in gen-
eral have three independent components of the motion.
The position, velocity and acceleration of the particle are
all vectors, and so are the forces acting upon the parti-
cle. According to Newtonian dynamics the equation of
motion of a particle is found by ﬁnding the forces acting
upon the particle adding them vectorially and applying
Newton’s second law (see Eq. (3.29)) to the particle. In
three-dimensional space Newton’s second law is repre-
sented by three component equations,
md2x
dt2 = Fx,
md2y
dt2 = Fy,
and
md2z
dt2 = Fz.
(3.61)
We shall ﬁrst consider the simple case that no force is
acting upon the particle. Then the equations of motion
are
d2x
dt2 = 0,
d2y
dt2 = 0,
and
d2z
dt2 = 0.
(3.62)

3.7
Integrating equations of motion
132
(Note that if md2x
dt2 = 0 and m ̸= 0, then d2x
dt2 = 0.) The
antiderivative of the second derivative is the ﬁrst deriva-
tive. And the antiderivatice of zero is a constant (since
the derivative of a constant is zero). Integrating Eq. (3.62)
therefore gives
dx
dt = C1,
dy
dt = C2,
and
dz
dt = C3.
(3.63)
The left-hand expressions are just the velocity compo-
nents of the particle. Denoting these by vx, vy, and vz we
obtain
vx = C1,
vy = C2,
and
vz = C3.
(3.64)
This equation shows that the velocity components of the
particle are constant. Since the antiderivative of dx/dt is
x, and so forth, and the antiderivative of C1 is C1t, and so
forth, a new integration gives
x = x0 + vxt,
y = y0 + vyt,
and
z = z0 + vzt, (3.65)
where the integration constants have been denoted by x0,
y0, and z0. Inserting t = 0 we ﬁnd
x(0) = x0,
y(0) = y0,
andz(0) = z0
(3.66)
Thus, the constants x0, y0, and z0 are the coordinates of
a point that the particle passes at time t = 0. Compar-
ing with the parameter representation of a straight line,

3.7
Integrating equations of motion
133
Eq. (3.15), we see that the path followed by a particle that
is not acted upon by any forces is a straight line.
As our second example we shall calculate the path of
a particle thrown out horizontally with an initial velocity
v0 in a ﬁeld of weight with acceleration of gravity equal
to g. During the free fall of the particle (neglecting air re-
sistance) the only force acting upon the particle is gravity,
which acts vertically. There is no horizontal force. Then it
follows from our ﬁrst example that the particle has con-
stant horizontal velocity.
We choose a coordinate system with horizontal x-axis
and vertical y-axis. The particle is thrown out from the
origin, in the positive x-direction, at a point of time t = 0.
In this case the equations of motion of the particle are
d2x
dt2 = 0
and
d2y
dt2 = −g.
(3.67)
Integration with vy(0) = 0 gives
dx
dt = v0
and
dy
dt = −gt.
(3.68)
Integrating once more with x(0) = y(0) = 0 leads to
x = v0t
and
y = −1

Inserting t = x/v0 into the expression for y, we ﬁnd

This is the equation of a parabola of a similar shape as
that of Fig. 3.1. With a suitable initial velocity the path of
the particle will be just that parabola.

Chapter 4
Approaching general rela-
tivity:
introducing curvi-
linear coordinate systems
Cartesian coordinate systems have straight coordinate
lines orthogonal to each other. The coordinate basis vec-
tor ﬁelds are constant, and all the vectors of each ﬁeld are
unit vectors with the same direction. This is the simplest
coordinate system that one can imagine. It seems strange
that it can be advantageous to introduce coordinate sys-
tems with coordinate curves which are not straight lines,
so-called curvilinear coordinate systems. But in fact some
objects of investigation have certain symmetries, for ex-
ample cylindrical or spherical symmetry that makes it ad-
vantageous to introduce curvilinear coordinates. In a ﬂat
space, however, every coordinate system can be trans-
135

Curvilinear coordinate systems
136
formed into a Cartesian system, so that in principle one
could solve every problem with reference to Cartesian co-
ordinates.
In general relativity it is necessary to introduce curvi-
linear coordinate systems.
According to this theory
spacetime1 is curved and four-dimensional with three
space dimensions and one time dimension. This curved
four-dimensional spacetime seems to be the easiest way
of taking into account the results from careful experimen-
tal investigations of electromagnetism and gravitation.
In fact, already about 1920, the general theory of rel-
ativity was generalized to describe spacetime with more
than three spatial dimensions. More than one time di-
mension is problematic, however, because it leads to cer-
tain strange possibilities of backward time travel, which
belongs to science ﬁction. These generalized versions of
general relativity are called Kaluza–Klein theories, and
have been thoroughly investigated recently. They lead
to the possibility of giving a uniﬁed geometrical descrip-
tion of classical (i.e. non-quantum) electromagnetism and
gravity. The problem of creating a coherent single the-
ory for gravitation and quantum theory is still unsolved.
The most recent effort is called superstring theory and in-
volves ten-dimensional spacetime. In this book we shall
be concerned with four-dimensional spacetime.
Consider hypothetical two-dimensional creatures liv-

ing in a two-dimensional space made up of the surface of
a sphere. They would have to describe their world with
reference to the curved surface. No three-dimensional
space exists for these creatures. And the spherical surface
cannot be covered by a two-dimensional Cartesian coordi-
nate system. (Look at a globus!). The situation is similar
in the case of curved spaces of higher dimensions, such
as our spacetime. It cannot be covered by a Cartesian co-
ordinate system. As long as we insist that the spacetime
may be curved and four-dimensional, and that the de-
scription of our universe shall be referred to a coordinate
system with four dimensions only, there is no other way
than introducing curvilinear coordinate systems.
The simplest curvilinear coordinate system is a system
of concentric circles and straight radial lines out from the
common centre of the circles. The coordinates of this sys-
tem are called plane polar coordinates. In this chapter we
shall consider the main properties of such a coordinate
system. Some knowledge of trigonometric functions is
then indispensable.
4.1
Trigonometric functions
We shall now introduce three so-called trigonometric func-
tions, named sinus, cosinus, and tangens. They are widely
used in physics, meteorology and astronomy—every-
where.

4.1
Trigonometric functions
138
Consider a circle with radius r and centre at the origin
of a Cartesian coordinate system, as shown in Fig. 4.1.
The radial line OP makes an angle θ with the positive x-
axis. The point P has coordinates (x, y).
Figure 4.1: Circle of radius r centered at the origin
.
Before we deﬁne the functions sinus, cosinus and tan-
gens, we shall have to know how we measure angles.
There are two common angular measures. In daily life

4.1
Trigonometric functions
139
we measure angles in degrees. For example the latitude
and longitude of the position of a mountain are given
in degrees. One degree may be deﬁned in the following
way: divide a circle in 360 parts by marking 360 equidis-
tant points. Draw radial lines from the centre of the cir-
cle to all of the dividing points. One degree is the angle
between two neighbouring radial lines. Thus the angle
around the full circle is 360 degrees. Since there are four
right angles around a circle, a right angle is equal to 90
degrees, and a half circle is 180 degrees.
The other angular measure, which is used in connec-
tion with the trigonometric functions, is called a radian.
With reference to Fig. 4.1 we formulate the following def-
inition: the angle, θ, i.e. the number of radians, is deﬁned as
the length of the circular arc between 0 and P divided by
the radius. Note that this ratio is independent of the ra-
dius of the circle. The sign π is the symbol for the number
of radians of a 180 degree angle. Its value is 3.141592 . . ..
It follows that the length of a circle with radius r is 2πr.
The angle around a circle, as measured in radians, is 2π,
and a right angle is equal to 2π/4 = π/2. Increasing an
angle by 2π corresponds to going one time around a cir-
cle.
The functions sinus(θ) and cosinus(θ) are denoted by
sin θ and cos θ. They are deﬁned with reference to Fig. 4.1
by the equations
sin θ ≡y
r
and
cos θ ≡x
r,
(4.1a)

4.1
Trigonometric functions
140
where r = (x2 + y2)1/2 according to the Pythagorean the-
orem. Note that if r = 1 then sin θ = y and cos θ = x. For
θ outside the range [0, 2π⟩the deﬁnition implies
sin(θ + 2π) = sin θ
and
cos(θ + 2π) = cos θ.
(4.1b)
Equation (4.1b) shows that sin θ and cos θ are periodic
functions with period 2π. This corresponds to the fact
that if P on Fig. 4.1 is moved around the circle, so that θ
passes 2π, then x and y, and thus sin θ and cos θ obtain
just the same values as one round earlier.
The function tangens(θ) is denoted by tan θ, and is de-
ﬁned by
tan θ ≡sin θ
cos θ.
(4.2)
Substituting for sin θ and cos θ from the deﬁnitions in
Eqs. (4.1) leads to
tan θ = y
x.
(4.3)
The function tan θ is in principle superﬂuous. We can
always use sin θ and cos θ. However, the function tan θ
simpliﬁes some calculations, as will be seen in our de-
scription of plane curves in Sect. 9.1.
It will be useful to formulate the expressions for the
trigonometric functions without reference to a Cartesian
coordinate system; only referring to a right angled trian-
gle, such as OAP in Fig. 4.1. Note that in relation to the
angle θ the base x is the side adjacent to θ, and the height

4.1
Trigonometric functions
141
y is the side opposite to θ. Using these terms the expres-
sions for sin θ and cos θ can be formulated in the follow-
ing way.
sin θ = the length of the side opposite to θ
the length of the hypotenuse
,
cos θ = the length of the side adjacent to θ
the length of the hypotenuse
,
and
tan θ = the length of the side opposite to θ
the length of the side adjacent to θ .
These formulations permit us to ﬁnd expressions for the
trigonometric functions by reference to a right angled tri-
angle with arbitrary orientation, not referring to any co-
ordinate system, see Fig. 4.2.
From Fig. 4.2 and the expressions (4.1) we get sin θ =
a/h and cos θ = b/h. Multiplying by h we can express
the magnitude of the side opposite to θ and the side ad-
jacent to θ, by θ and the hypotenuse h of the right angled
triangle,
a = h sin θ
and
b = h cos θ.
(4.4)
Consider Fig. 4.3. The part CQD of the ﬁgure is ob-
tained by turning the part APB an angle 90 degrees to the
left. Thus the angles CQD and APB are equal. We obtain

the following sentence: two angles with pairwise normal
legs, are equal.
In Eq. (1.8) we have written the dot product of two
vectors ⃗A and ⃗B as ‘the magnitude of ⃗A times the mag-
nitude of ⃗B’s projection, ⃗B||, along ⃗A’. This may now be
expressed in terms of the angle α between ⃗A and ⃗B.
Figure 4.4: Angle α between ⃗A and ⃗B
From Fig. 4.4 is seen that |⃗B∥| = cos α. In general
|⃗B∥| =

(4.5)
Inserting this into Eq. (1.8) gives
⃗A · ⃗B = |⃗A||⃗B| cos α
(4.6)

4.1
Trigonometric functions
145
where the sign ambiguity in Eq. (1.8) is taken care of auto-
matically. Since the angle that a vector makes with itself
is zero, and cos 0 = 1, it follows that the square of the
magnitude of a vector is
|⃗A|2 = ⃗A · ⃗A.
(4.7)
We shall now deduce a geometrical identity that will
be used in Ch. 5. The square of |⃗A −⃗B| is
|⃗A −⃗B|2 = (⃗A −⃗B) · (⃗A −⃗B) = ⃗A · ⃗A −2⃗A · ⃗B + ⃗B · ⃗B
= |⃗A|2 + |⃗B|2 −2⃗A · ⃗B.
(4.8)
Substituting the expression (4.6) for the dot product ⃗A · ⃗B
leads to
|⃗A −⃗B|2 = |⃗A|2 + |⃗B|2 −2|⃗A||⃗B| cos α.
(4.9)
Look at Fig. 1.9. Let the angle between the vectors ⃗A
and ⃗B be α, the length of ⃗A be L1, the length of ⃗B be L2,
and the length of ⃗A−⃗B be L. Then Eq. (4.9) may be written
L2 = L2
1 + L2
2 −2L1L2 cos α.
(4.10)
This is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem to the
case when the triangle has no 90 degree angle. It might
have been named ‘The extended Pythagorean theorem’,

4.1

146
but is usually called ‘the law of cosines’. In Fig. 4.5 we
have redrawn Fig. 1.9, but this time with the quantities L,
L1, L2, and α which appear in Eq. (4.10).
Figure 4.5: The triangle of Eq. (4.10)
The magnitudes of sin θ and cos θ when θ increases
from 0 to 2π are seen from Fig.4.1 by letting P start at the
positive x-axis and then move around the circle. At the
x-axis, x = r and y = 0, giving and cos 0 = 1. Moving
on to the y-axis, x decreases towards zero and y increases
towards r. When P is at the y-axis the angle θis equal to
π/2. Thus sin(π/2) = 1 and cos(π/2) = 0. As P comes
to the negative x-axis, x = −r and y = 0, while θ = π,
so sin π = 0 and cos π = −1. Letting P move further to
the negative y-axis, the angle θ reaches 3π/2, while x = 0
and y = −r, giving sin(3π/2) = −1 and cos(3π/2) = 0.
We may now draw the diagrams representing y = sin θ
and y = cos θ (in Fig. 4.6), with y along a vertical axis and
θ along a horizontal axis.
An important relation between sin θ and cos θ should

4.1
Trigonometric functions
147
Figure 4.6: The function sin θ and cos θ
be noted. Using Eqs. (4.1) we get
sin2 θ + cos2 θ = x2
r2 + y2
r2 = x2 + y2
r2
= r2
r2 = 1.
(4.11)
This equation is valid for every value of the angle θ.
We shall need to calculate cosinus to the sum (or dif-
ference) of two angles. The formulae both for sinus and
cosinus to a sum of two angles are found from Fig. 4.7.
You will ﬁnd a lot of information written on the ﬁgure.
These are results that we shall now deduce. Consider ﬁrst
the angle DPC. PC is normal to OC and PD is normal to
OA. According to Fig. 4.3 two angles with pairwise nor-
mal legs are equal. Hence, we conclude that the angle
DPC is equal to the angle POC, i.e. it is equal to u.

4.1

149
Next we shall utilize Eq. (4.4) which is related to
Fig. 4.2. Consider the triangle OCP which is similar to
the triangle of Fig. 4.2. Using Eq. (4.4) we ﬁnd
OC = cos u
and
PC = sin u.
(4.12)
Looking at the triangle DCP we ﬁnd
DC = PC sin v = sin u sin v,
PD = PC cos v = sin u cos v.
(4.13)
From the triangle OBC we get
OB = OC cos v = cos u cos v,
BC = OC sin v = cos u sin v,
(4.14)
and from the triangle OAP we have
OA = cos(u + v)
and
AP = sin(u + v).
(4.15)
Looking at Fig. 4.7 we now ﬁnd
sin(u + v) = PD + AD = PD + BC.
(4.16)
Inserting the expressions for PD and BC from Eqs. (4.13)
and (4.14), respectively, we get
sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v
(4.17)
and
cos(u + v) = OB −AB = OB −DC.
(4.18)

4.1
Trigonometric functions
150
Inserting the expressions for OB and DC from Eqs. (4.14)
and (4.13), respectively, leads to
cos(u + v) = cos u cos v −sin u sin v.
(4.19)
We shall now deduce a formula which will be needed in
chapter 14. Using Eq. (4.17) we get
sin 2θ = sin(θ + θ)
= sin θ cos θ + cos θ sin θ = 2 sin θ cos θ.
(4.20)
From Eq. (4.19) we have
cos 2θ = cos(θ + θ) = cos2 θ −sin2 θ.
Using Eq. (4.11) this may be written alternatively as
cos 2θ = 2 cos2 θ −1 = 1 −2 sin2 θ.
4.1.1
Differentiation of trigonometric func-
tions
In our analysis of curved coordinate systems we shall
have to differentiate the functions sin θ and cos θ. A geo-
metrical deduction of the expressions for the derivatives
of these functions shall now be given.

Consider Fig. 4.8.
A circle with radius 1 is drawn
about the origin O of a Cartesian coordinate system. The
radii OP and OQ make angles θ and θ + ∆θ, respectively,
with the positive x axis. The point P has coordinates (x, y)
and the point Q (x−∆x, y+∆y). For a small angle ∆θ, the
direction of the line PQ is very close to that of the tangent
at P. Then PQ is normal to the radial line OP. Thus the
legs PQ and QR of the angle PQR are pairwise normal to
the legs OP and OA. Since the angle POA is equal to θ,
the angle PQR must also be equal to θ. From the triangle
PQR we then have
sin θ = ∆x
∆θ
and
cos θ = ∆y
∆θ.
(4.21)
Note that the line PQ equals ∆θ because the radius is
equal to 1. Also from the triangles OAP and OBQ we
get
sin θ = y
and
cos θ = x,
(4.22)
and
sin(θ+∆θ) = y+∆y
and
cos(θ+∆θ) = x−∆x. (4.23)
The expressions for the derivatives of sin θ and cos θ can
now be deduced directly from the general deﬁnition of

where we have used Eqs. (4.21)–(4.23).
In order to calculate, in chapter 9, the curvature of a
curve, we shall need the derivative of tan θ. This is most
simply deduced by applying the formula (2.46) for differ-
entiating a fraction of functions. Inserting u = sin θ and
v = cos θ and using Eqs. (4.2),(4.24), and (4.25) we ﬁnd

(4.26)
Alternatively, from the next last expression in Eq. (4.26),

4.1

we get
(tan θ)′ = 1 + sin2
cos2 θ = 1 + tan2 θ,
(4.27)
where we have used the deﬁnition of tan θ in Eq. (4.2).
In Sect. 9.2 we shall need to know the MacLaurin se-
ries for sin θ. In order to collect the necessary theory of
trigonometry at one place, we shall immediately deduce
the form of this series.
The MacLaurin series of a function f(θ) is given in
Eq. (2.84) as
f(θ) = f(0) + f′(0) θ + f′′(0)
2
θ2 + f′′′(0)
6
θ3 + · · · . (4.28)
In the case that f(θ) = sin θ we get
f(θ) = sin θ
⇒f(0) = 0
f′(θ) = cos θ
⇒f′(0) = 1
f′′(θ) = −sin θ
⇒f′′(0) = 0
f′′′(θ) = −cos θ ⇒f′′′(0) = −1.
Substitution into Eq. (4.28) gives
sin θ = θ −1
6θ3 + · · · .
(4.29)
These are the ﬁrst terms of the MacLaurin series for sin θ.

4.2
Plane polar coordinates
A coordinate system with plane polar coordinates, r and
θ, is shown in Fig. 4.9.
Figure 4.9: Plane polar coordinates, r and θ
Instead of vertical and horizontal coordinate lines,
such as in a Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinate
curves in a system with plane polar coordinates are con-
centric circles and radial lines. The Cartesian coordinates

4.2
Plane polar coordinates
156
x and y are the horizontal and vertical distances from the
origin. The plane polar coordinate r of an arbitrary point
P, is the distance from the origin to P. The plane polar
coordinate θ is the angle of the radial line from the origin
to P with respect to a horizontal line.
Just as there are horizontal and a vertical basis vectors,
⃗ex and ⃗ey, at every point in a Cartesian coordinate system,
there are radial, and a tangential basis vectors, ⃗er and ⃗eθ,
at every point in a polar coordinate system. These basis
vectors at an arbitrary point P are shown in Fig. 4.10. The
Figure 4.10: Radial and tangential basis vectors
point O is the origin of the coordinate system. The point
P has coordinates r and θ. The basis vectors at P have
been denoted by (⃗er)P and (⃗eθ)P to indicate that their di-

4.2
Plane polar coordinates
157
rections and magnitudes depend upon the point at which
they are drawn. The Cartesian basis vectors, ⃗ex and ⃗ey, on
the other hand, are the same everywhere.
The simple relation between a Cartesian coordinate
system and a polar coordinate system with the same ori-
gin, and with the direction θ = 0 corresponding to the
x-axis, is shown in Fig. 4.11.
Figure 4.11: Relation between Cartesian and polar coor-
dinates
From the ﬁgure is seen that
cos θ = x
r
and
sin θ = y
r
(4.30)

4.2
Plane polar coordinates
158
which gives
x = r cos θ
and
y = r sin θ.
(4.31)
This is our ﬁrst example of a coordinate transformation
equation.
Some curves have a simpler equation in polar coor-
dinates than in Cartesian coordinates. The equation of a
circle with centre at the origin and radius R is in Cartesian
coordinates
x2 + y2 = R2.
(4.32)
The equation of the same circle in polar coordinates is
r = R.
(4.33)
The position vector of an arbitrary point P with Cartesian
coordinates (x, y) is
⃗r = x⃗ex + y⃗ey.
(4.34)
The Cartesian components of⃗r are rx = x and ry = y, and
may be expressed by the coordinates r and θ by means of
Eq. (4.31), giving
⃗r = r cos θ⃗ex + r sin θ⃗ey.
(4.35)
We now calculate the magnitude of the basis vectors ⃗er
and ⃗eθ. Using a concept introduced in section 3.3 we may
say that the basis vector ﬁeld ⃗er is a tangent vector ﬁeld

4.2
Plane polar coordinates
159
to the radial lines. The coordinate θ is constant along a
radial line, while r increases along it. Thus r can be used
as a parameter for such a line. The parametric equation
for a radial line is then
x = r cos θ
and
y = r sin θ
where θ is a constant, speciﬁc for each line. Equation
(3.19) with ⃗u = ⃗er, t = r, and replacing dx/dt with ∂x/∂r,
and dy/dt with ∂y/∂r, gives
⃗er = ∂x
∂r⃗ex + ∂y
∂r⃗ey,
(4.36)
which shows that
(⃗er)x = ∂x
∂r
and
(⃗er)y = ∂y
∂r .
(4.37)
Differentiating Eq. (4.31) with respect to r, (remember
that θ is constant when we differentiate partially with re-
spect to r), we get
∂x
∂r = cos θ
and
∂y
∂r = sin θ.
(4.38)
Thus
(⃗er)x = cos θ
and
(⃗er)y = sin θ
(4.39)
showing that
⃗er = cos θ⃗ex + sin θ⃗ey.
(4.40)

4.2
Plane polar coordinates
160
The magnitude of ⃗er, as calculated by means of Eqs. (1.5)
and (4.39) is
|⃗er| = cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1,
(4.41)
which shows that ⃗er is an unit vector independent of its
position. But ⃗er changes with θ. Since the magnitude of
⃗er is constant and equal to unity, the change of ⃗er with θ
is only a change of direction.
The basis vector ﬁelds ⃗eθ are tangent vector ﬁelds to
the circles about the origin. The coordinate r is constant
along a circle, while θ increases along it. So θ can be used
as a parameter for such a circle. The parametric equa-
tion for a circle about the origin is again Eq. (4.31), but
this time with r = constant for each circle, and with θ as
variable.
Equation (3.17) with ⃗u = ⃗eθ, t = θ, and ﬁrst i = x, so
i = y, then gives
(⃗eθ)x = ∂x
∂θ = −r sin θ
and
(⃗eθ)y = ∂y
∂θ = r cos θ,
(4.42)
which leads to
⃗eθ = −r sin θ⃗ex + r cos θ⃗ey.
(4.43)
The magnitude of ⃗eθ is found from Eqs. (1.5) and (4.43 )
as
|⃗eθ| =

(−r sin θ)2 + (r cos θ)21/2
= r(sin2 θ + cos2 θ)1/2 = r.
(4.44)

4.2
Plane polar coordinates
161
This equation shows that the magnitude of ⃗eθ increases
proportionally to the distance from the origin. This is not
a unit vector ﬁeld. However, one could deﬁne a corre-
sponding unit vector ﬁeld ⃗e^θ by
⃗e^θ = ⃗eθ
|⃗eθ| = 1
r⃗eθ.
(4.45)
Here the hat above the index denotes that the vector has
unit length.
Note that the calculation above has provided us with
a method for transforming basis vectors. Using Eq. (3.19)
we ﬁnd the transformation of the basis vectors from a
knowledge of the corresponding coordinate transforma-
tion.
We have seen that in general the coordinate basis vec-
tors are not unit vectors. And the corresponding unit vec-
tors, such as ⃗e^θ, will in general not be coordinate basis
vectors. Still they are basis vectors, in the sense that an
arbitrary vector can be decomposed along the basis vec-
tors.

Chapter 5
The metric tensor
The metric tensor is perhaps the most important mathe-
matical quantity in the theory of relativity. From a knowl-
edge of the metric tensor one may compute the geometry
of spacetime and for example the motion of the planets in
the solar system. In this chapter we shall give a thorough
introduction to the metric tensor and its physical signiﬁ-
cance in the theory of relativity.
5.1
Basis vectors and the dimension
of a space
In Chapter 1 basis vectors were introduced as reference
vectors for directions (in ﬂat space), and it was mentioned
that at every point of an n-dimensional space there are n
basis vectors. One could say that there are n independent
162

5.1
Basis vectors and dimension of space
163
directions in an n-dimensional space. Let us say what
these terms express in a precise way. We then need to
make a few deﬁnitions.
The vectors ⃗e1,⃗e2, . . . ,⃗en are said to be linearly indepen-
dent if no set of real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an different from
zero exists, such that
a1⃗e1 + a2⃗e2 + · · · + an⃗en = 0.
(5.1)
The geometrical meaning of this deﬁnition is: The vec-
tors ⃗e1,⃗e2, . . . ,⃗en are linearly independent if it is not pos-
sible to make a closed polygon of the vectors, even if we
try our best by adjusting their lengths, that is, we cannot
make a vector sum of all the vectors equal to zero, even if
we scale them. Vectors that are not linearly independent
are said to be linearly dependent. A set of three linearly
dependent vectors is shown in Fig. 5.1.
Figure 5.1: Three linearly dependent vectors

5.1
Basis vectors and dimension of space
164
In this ﬁgure we consider three vectors ⃗v1 = 8⃗ex, ⃗v2 =
−4⃗ex + 3⃗ey, ⃗v3 = −4⃗ex −3⃗ey. Thus ⃗v1 + ⃗v2 + ⃗v3 = 0,
which means that they are linearly dependent, and that
when they are drawn as in Fig. 5.1, they make up a closed
polygon.
In general two vectors that have different directions
are linearly independent. Three vectors in a plane with
different directions are, however, linearly dependent,
since one can make a closed polygon in a plane by means
of three such vectors.
A set of maximally linearly independent vectors in a
space consists of the maximum number of linearly inde-
pendent vectors in the space. If ⃗e1,⃗e2, . . . ,⃗en are maxi-
mally linearly independent, there exists a vector ⃗u so that
the vectors ⃗e1,⃗e2, . . . ,⃗en, ⃗u are linearly dependent, which
means that there exist numbers a1 , a2 , ..., an so that
a1⃗e1 + a2⃗e2 + · · · + an⃗en + ⃗u = 0
or
⃗u = −a1⃗e1 −a2⃗e2 −· · · −an⃗en.
(5.2)
By means of three vectors with different directions in a
plane one can always make a closed polygon. To see this,
draw the ﬁrst vector from a chosen point, then add the
second by drawing it from the terminal point of the ﬁrst
vector as in Fig. 1.8, and choose ⃗u as minus the sum of the
ﬁrst two vectors. Clearly there are only two vectors in any
set of maximally linearly independent vectors in a plane.

5.1
Basis vectors and dimension of space
165
Correspondingly, there are three vectors in a maximally
linearly independent set of vectors in any ordinary three-
dimensional space, in a room for example.
The maximally linearly independent set of vectors in
a space adequately represents the independent directions
in the space. This motivates the following deﬁnition. A
vector basis, or, more precisely, a set of basis vectors {⃗e1, . . . ,
⃗en} of a space is a set of maximally linearly independent
vectors in the space. Furthermore we introduce new sym-
bols for the numbers ai, i = 1, . . . , n, namely ui = −ai.
Equation (5.2) then takes the form
⃗u = ui⃗ei = u1⃗e1 + u2⃗e2 + . . . + un⃗en
(5.3)
which is recognized as the component form of a vector
(see Eq. (3.17)). Note that we have superscripts on the
vector components and subscripts on the basis vectors (or
vice versa, see Sect. 5.6). The reason for this is connected
with the coordinate invariance of vectors, which will be
treated later in this chapter.
Later in this chapter we shall need to use the expres-
sion ‘linear combination’. We deﬁne: a linear combination
of some quantities q1, q2, . . . , qn is an expression of the
form a1q1 + a2q2 + · · · + anqn, where a1, a2, . . . , an are
numbers. The component form (5.3) of a vector thus im-
plies that any vector can be written as a linear combina-
tion of the basis vectors.
The decomposition of a vector in a given space is not
unique. In a two-dimensional space, for example, {⃗ex,⃗ey}

5.2
Space and spacetime
166
is the coordinate vector basis of a Cartesian coordinate
system, and {⃗er,⃗eθ} is the coordinate vector basis of a co-
ordinate system with plane polar coordinates. This illus-
trates that we can have many different sets of basis vec-
tors in a space.
The dimension of a space is deﬁned as the number of
vectors of a vector basis in the space. Note that this deﬁni-
tion does not refer in any way to ‘orthogonality’. We are
used to thinking of different dimensions as orthogonal
to each other, or independent of each other, in the sense
that motion in one dimension does not involve motion in
any other dimension. For example motion along the x-
axis does not involve any displacement along the y-axis.
However, this needs not always be so, as we shall later
see in connection with rotating reference frames. The dif-
ferent basis vectors of a vector basis need not be orthog-
onal to each other, and time is not necessarily orthogonal
to space.
5.2
Space and spacetime
What is space?
When you say “N.N. has much space
available in his home”, you can usually substitute ‘room’
for ‘space’. However, this is not the way that we shall
think of ‘space’ in the general theory of relativity. We
shall have to be familiar with very different uses. In order
to avoid prejudices, let us invent a word ‘wace’, rather

5.2
Space and spacetime
167
than always use the word ‘space’. We start by saying:
A wace is, among other things, something within which
there are directions and in which things can be moved, or
more technically, displaced. Forget about ﬁnite distances
between points and retain rather a notion of (tiny) neigh-
borhoods. In waces we can feel our way, locally.
There exist indeﬁnitely many kinds of waces. How do
we know? Because the existence is in general a purely
mathematical one.
The multitude of waces is not more
mysterious than the fact that there exist inﬁnitely many
numbers. As used within physics, however, a wace has a
physical aspect.
In a very special four-dimensional wace called ‘space-
time’, there are three dimensions called space dimensions
and one called the time dimension. A tiny displacement
normally affects all four dimensions.
It is useful to imagine displacement in a two-
dimensional wace as a displacement ‘on’ a surface. We
use inverted commas because the proposition ‘on’ sug-
gests ‘upon’, that is, a third dimension, which is foreign to
a two-dimensional wace. The displacements in our case
are parts of the surface. In the general case a bulging sur-
face, like a crust on a slightly boiling soup-like ﬂuid, bub-
bles are appearing and disappearing, but do not burst.
We must admit that we normally imagine a boiling sur-
face within a three-dimensional room, whereas in such a
wace we should try to imagine ourselves as two-

5.2
Space and spacetime
168
dimensional beings, parts of an indeﬁnitely thin crust.
According to the pre-relativistic conceptions, or ra-
ther, ‘models’, of our universe, we live in a three-
dimensional Euclidean (ﬂat) physical space. The proper-
ties of space, as a kind of empty container without walls,
were not thought to be inﬂuenced by its contents of mat-
ter. And time was something which did not interfere with
space itself.
In the special theory of relativity space and time are
united in a four-dimensional wace, called “spacetime”.
Space and time can no longer be separated in any ab-
solute sense, as is the case in Newtonian physics. The
relativity of simultaneity has the following strange con-
sequence (see Sect. 5.10). What one observer perceives
as a purely spatial distance between two simultaneous
events, is a combination of a time interval and a spatial
distance for another observer, moving relative to the ﬁrst
one. But the geometry of spacetime is not inﬂuenced by
matter present. It is ﬂat always and everywhere.
The situation is different in the general theory of relativ-
ity. Here spacetime is a part of physics. The geometrical
properties of spacetime depend upon the matter and en-
ergy present in it, and spacetime in turn determines the
motion of free particles. A remarkable aspect of this is
that spacetime is just as dynamic as matter.
Spacetime is a four-dimensional wace with Rieman-
nian geometry, and the equations of general relativity im-

5.3
Transformation of vector components
169
ply that free particles move along geodesic curves (that is,
straightest possible curves) in this wace (see Ch. 12).
Since spacetime is conceived of as curved, we must
develop a description that can be used with reference to
curved coordinate systems. This is obtained by introduc-
ing a kind of generalized vectors called tensors. In order
to appreciate those properties of tensors that make them
so useful for the mathematical formulation of the general
theory of relativity, we need some knowledge about how
vector components change under a change of coordinate
system without any change of the vector itself. In short: how
the vector components transform. The next paragraph is
devoted to this topic. Tensor components also transform
without any change of the tensor itself. According to Ein-
stein’s ideas, natural laws must be formulated in such
a way that they retain their identity whatever reference
systems, we humans, with our ﬁnite intelligence, choose
to employ in our study of those laws. Tensors suit this
purpose.
5.3
Transformation of vector compo-
nents
What happens to the components of a vector when the
vector remains identical with itself, while the coordinate
systems we place it in changes? It turns out that the equa-

5.3
Transformation of vector components
170
tion expressing the effect of all these changes are superbly
short. Only 14 symbols are needed in Eq. (5.13) below,
even less than in the case of the simple rule (a + b)2 =
a2 + 2ab + b2.
It was important for Einstein to ﬁnd something like
vectors which could take care of seemingly immensely
complicated relations. To the essential simplicity of nat-
ural laws, there could perhaps correspond simple vector
equations eliminating human fuss with coordinates.
Let xµ be the old coordinates in an n-dimensional
wace, and xµ′ be the new ones. The only thing we know
about the latter is that they are functions of the old ones:
x1′ = f1′(x1, x2, . . . , xn)
x2′ = f2′(x1, x2, . . . , xn)
...
xn′ = fn′(x1, x2, . . . , xn)


.
(5.4)
In an extreme case every new coordinate is a complicated
function of all the old ones. Using the notation x1′(. . .) for
f1′(. . .), x2′(. . .) for f2′(. . .), and so on, the whole system
of equations (5.4) may be written simply as
xµ′ = xµ′(x1, . . . , xn)
for
µ′ = 1′, 2′, . . . , n′.
(5.5)
Note that xµ′ should be thought of as one symbol, denot-
ing the ﬁrst coordinate in the new system, the second,
and so forth.

5.3
Transformation of vector components
171
Let us consider a simple example, where the ‘old’ co-
ordinates are the plane polar coordinates, r and θ, of sec-
tion 4.2, and the new ones are the Cartesian coordinates
x and y. Then x1 = r, x2 = θ, x1′ = x, and x2′ = y.
The transformation equation (4.31) from the plane po-
lar coordinates to the Cartesian coordinates, is a set of
equations of the type (5.5). The ﬁrst one of the equations
(5.5), x1′ = x1′(x1, x2), is x = r cos θ, and the second one,
x2′ = x2′(x1, x2), is y = r sin θ.
We shall ﬁnd the transformation formula for vector
components by thinking of an arbitrary vector as the tan-
gent vector of a curve, xµ(τ). Then the components of
the vector are uµ = dxµ/dτ, where τ is the curve param-
eter. The curve is deﬁned by specifying the coordinates
as functions of the curve parameter τ. The transforma-
tion formula for the tangent vector components is found
by differentiating the transformed coordinates with re-
spect to the parameter τ. Then we need a generalization
of the chain rule for differentiation, Eq. (2.31), to func-
tions of several variables. In a similar way that Eq. (2.31)
is deduced from Eq. (2.26), it follows from Eq. (2.61) that
the chain rule for a function of several variables takes the
form
dxµ′
dτ = ∂xµ′

Using Eq. (3.16) we can write Eq. (5.6) as

(5.10)
A transformation of some quantities is said to be linear
and homogeneous if all new (i.e. transformed) quantities
(vector components in the present case) are linear com-
binations of the old quantities. Equation (5.10) represents
a linear and homogeneous transformation of the vector
components uµ.
Transforming, for example, the components of a vec-
tor in the plane polar coordinate system to its compo-

5.3

nents in the Cartesian system, we get, from Eqs. (5.8)–

ux = cos θur −r sin θuθ,
uy = sin θur + r cos θuθ.
(5.11)
Written out for a vector in an n-dimensional space, the

(5.12)
The linear and homogeneous character of the trans-
formation ‘law’ of vector components implies that all the
terms on the right-hand side of the system of equations
(5.12) are proportional to an ‘old’ vector component, uµ.
This has a most important consequence. One can always
orient a coordinate system (which we choose as the ‘old’
system), so that a vector in the old coordinate system has
just one component, for example u1, different from zero,
or, as it is often expressed, one non-vanishing component.
Since all the coordinates of both the old and the new sys-
tem are included in every coordinate transformation, at
least one of the new coordinates is a function of x1. So,

5.3
Transformation of vector components
174
at least one of the coefﬁcients ∂xµ′/∂x1 of u1 is different
from zero (i.e. non-vanishing). Looking at the system of
equations, we then see that at least one of the new vector
components are non-vanishing. The conclusion of this
verbal mathematical deduction is: No vector can be trans-
formed away. And neither can a new vector appear due to
a coordinate transformation. The existence of any vector
is coordinate invariant.
In the rest of this book, when we mention systems of
equations written in a condensed form, like Eq. (5.10),
we shall permit ourselves to write only ‘equation’ even
where ‘set of equations’ would be more correct.
Equation (5.10) is the transformation equation of the
components of a tangent vector under an arbitrary
change of coordinate system. It was deduced for tangent
vectors, but all vectors can in fact be regarded as tangent
vectors. Therefore Eq. (5.10) holds generally for all vec-
tors. This equation furnishes the completely general rule
for transforming the components of an arbitrary vector.
By exchanging the indices we obtain the transforma-
tion equation for vector components from the new coor-
dinate system back to the old one
uµ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′ uµ′.
(5.13)
The vector components, uµ, with superscripts, transform
according to Eq. (5.10) from the old coordinate system

5.3
Transformation of vector components
175
to the new one. The coefﬁcients ∂xµ′/∂xµ have two in-
dices, and can be arranged as a matrix, which is called the
transformation matrix from the old to the new system. The
coefﬁcients ∂xµ′/∂xµ are called the elements of the trans-
formation matrix. The vector components transform ac-
cording to Eq. (5.13) back to the old system. The coefﬁ-
cients ∂xµ/∂xµ′ of this backwards transformation are the
elements of the inverse transformation matrix. Perform-
ing a to and fro transformation, i.e. a transformation fol-
lowed by the inverse transformation, leads to the origi-
nal vector components. Replacing uµ′ in eq (5.13) by the
right-hand side of Eq. (5.10), we ﬁnd the result of the to
and fro transformation,
uµ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′
∂xµ′
∂xν uν.
(5.14)
Note that we changed the summation index µ in
Eq. (5.10) to ν, since the letter µ was already used as a free
(i.e. non-summation) superscript in the equation. Such
changes of summation indices are always permitted.
Which letter we use for a summation index, also called
a dummy index, does not matter.
The great German mathematician Leopold Kronecker
(1823–91) is known for his disrespect of other numbers
than the whole ones: He coined the maxim “God created
the whole numbers, the rest is human doing”. A curious
little symbol δµν is called ‘the Kronecker symbol’. It may

The only non-vanishing term in this sum is obtained for
ν = µ. Equation (5.14) can thus be written
∂xµ

The Galilean coordinate transfor-
mation
The Galilean coordinate transformation is a transforma-
tion between a system at rest and a moving system. Be-
fore we proceed to write down the mathematical form

5.4
The Galilean coordinate transformation
177
of the transformation, we need to make some conceptual
preparations. The expression ‘the motion of a coordinate
system’, has not yet been given a clear meaning. A co-
ordinate system mapping a space is essentially a contin-
uum of sets of numbers, where each number represents
the value of a coordinate. In spacetime one such set at a
point contains four numbers, the values of, say, (x, y, z, t)
at the point. The coordinates are mathematical objects.
In order to give a meaning to the above expression, we
must give a physical interpretation of the coordinates. An
intermediate step is to introduce a reference for motion.
This is called a reference frame, and may be deﬁned as a
continuum of particles with given motion. A comoving
coordinate system in a reference frame is a coordinate sys-
tem in which the reference particles of the frame are at
rest, i.e. they have constant spatial coordinates.
Let us choose the platform of a railway station as one
reference frame, and a train moving past the platform
with constant velocity v as another reference frame. The
‘old’ coordinate system, {x, t}, is comoving with the plat-
form, i.e. it may be thought of as a system of measuring
rods and clocks at rest on the platform, and the ‘new’ one,
{x′, t′} is comoving with the train. The Galilean coordi-
nate transformation from the platform system to the train
system is
x′ = x −vt
and
t′ = t,
(5.18)
where we have omitted the y and z-coordinates. From

5.4
The Galilean coordinate transformation
178
this transformation we ﬁnd, for example, that the posi-
tion, in the train system, of the origin x = 0 of the plat-
form system, is x = −vt, which shows that the platform
moves with velocity v in the negative x′-direction relative
to the train. The corresponding transformation matrix is

The inverse transformation represents a transformation

and

(5.21)
Let us apply the Galilean transformation to the com-
ponents of a velocity vector. The way this is done in ele-
mentary mechanics, is to deﬁne the velocity of a particle
in the platform system by
⃗u = u⃗ex = dx
dt⃗ex
(5.22)
and the velocity in the train system by
⃗u′ = u′⃗ex′ = dx′
dt′⃗ex′.
(5.23)

5.4
The Galilean coordinate transformation
179
Differentiating the transformation equation (5.18) and us-
ing the deﬁnitions (5.22) and (5.23), we obtain the
Galilean velocity transformation
u′ = u −v.
(5.24)
We should obtain the same result by applying
Eq. (5.12). The only nonvanishing velocity component in
the platform system is u1 = u. Then Eq. (5.12) is reduced
to
u′ = ∂x′
∂x u = u,
(5.25)
which is clearly not correct. What has gone wrong?
The reason for the failure is deeper than just a calcu-
lation error. It has to do with what we mean by a vector.
It is not sufﬁcient to think of a vector just as a quantity
with magnitude and direction. From our deﬁnition of the
dimension of a space follows that a vector has always the
same number of components (not necessarily nonvanish-
ing) as the number of dimensions in the space it exists in.
A Galilean transformation concerns space and time. Four
dimensions are involved, even if time and space are not
woven together as in the theory of relativity. Therefore, in
order to obtain a proper application of the Galilean trans-
formation, Eq. (5.19), to the components of a vector, the
vector must be deﬁned not only with spatial components,
but also with a time component. Still omitting the y and

5.4
The Galilean coordinate transformation
180
z dimensions, we then have
⃗u = ux⃗ex + ut⃗et
(5.26)
with
ux = dx
dt
and
ut = dt
dt = 1.
(5.27)
The transformation of the components of the velocity vec-
tor, is now found by inserting the elements of the trans-
formation matrix (5.19), and ut = 1, into the transforma-
tion formula (5.10),
ux′ = ∂x′
∂x ux + ∂x′
∂t ut = ux −v
(5.28)
which is the correct result.
If we consider motion in an arbitrary direction, not
only along the x-axis, the Galilean transformation takes
the form
⃗u′ = ⃗u −⃗v.
(5.29)
The fundamental dynamical law in Newtonian me-
chanics is Newton’s second law, which we considered in
section 3.4. This has a most interesting property which
we shall now show.
Let us assume that a particle with mass m is acted
upon by a force ⃗f. In the rest frame of the platform the
particle then has an acceleration ⃗a given by Newton’s
second law ⃗f = m⃗a. Acceleration is the derivative of

5.5
Transformation of basis vectors
181
the velocity. Differentiating Eq. (5.29), and noting that
d⃗v/dt = 0 since⃗v is the constant velocity of, say, the train,
we get
⃗a′ = ⃗a.
(5.30)
Hence, as measured in the rest frame of the train, the ac-
celeration of the particle is the same as measured on the
platform.
In Newtonian mechanics forces and masses are abso-
lute quantities, i.e.
⃗f′ = ⃗f
and
m′ = m.
(5.31)
I follows that ⃗f′ = m′⃗a′, showing that Newton’s second
law is valid in the same form in two reference frames
connected by a Galilean transformation. One usually ex-
presses this by saying that the fundamental equations of
Newtonian mechanics are invariant under Galilean trans-
formations. This is what is meant when one says that
Newtonian mechanics obeys the principle of relativity.
5.5
Transformation of basis vectors
We shall deduce the transformation formula for basis vec-
tors, and start by using that the vector sum of the compo-
nent vectors is equal to the vector itself. If we transform
from the old to the new coordinate system, the vector it-
self is not affected, but the components of the vector are

5.5
Transformation of basis vectors
182
in general different in the two coordinate systems,
⃗u = uµ′⃗eµ′ = uµ⃗eµ
(5.32)
where ⃗eµ′ are the basis vectors of the new coordinate sys-
tem.
From their dishonorable slavery under the tyranny of
coordinate axes, we see that basis vectors are in a sense
fake vectors. They are not sovereign, immutable beings,
but chained to a coordinate system. Equations (5.13) and
(5.32) give
uµ⃗eµ = uµ′⃗eµ′ = ∂xµ′
∂xµ uµ⃗eµ′ = uµ∂xµ′
∂xµ ⃗eµ′.
(5.33)
Since this equation is valid for an arbitrary vector ⃗u,
which may have only one component uµ different from
zero, it follows that
⃗eµ = ∂xµ′
∂xµ ⃗eµ′.
(5.34)
This is the formula for transforming the basis vectors of
the new system to the old one.
Unlike other vectors, a set of basis vectors is not in-
variant against a change of coordinate system. Like the
component vectors that we talked about in Sect. 1.4, they
have magnitudes and directions, but the ‘identity’ of the
basis vectors, their magnitudes and directions, depend
upon the coordinate system.

5.6
Vector components
183
Applying Eq. (5.34) to the example after Eq. (5.5) we
ﬁnd the transformation from the basis vectors of the
Cartesian coordinate system to those of the system with
plane polar coordinates,
⃗er = ∂x
∂r⃗ex + ∂y
∂r⃗ey = cos θ⃗ex + sin θ⃗ey,
(5.35)
⃗eθ = ∂x
∂θ⃗ex + ∂y
∂θ⃗ey = −r sin θ⃗ex + r cos θ⃗ey,
(5.36)
in accordance with Eqs. (4.40) and (4.43).
By exchanging the indices µ′ and µ we obtain an equa-
tion for transforming the basis vectors of the old coordi-
nate system to those of the new system.
⃗eµ′ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′⃗eµ.
(5.37)
The basis vectors transform by means of the elements
of the inverse transformation matrix, i.e. they transform
inversely, i.e. in the opposite ‘direction’, relative to the
transformation (5.13) of the vector components.
5.6
Covariant and contravariant vec-
tor components
Vectors continue to be the same when described in differ-
ent coordinate systems, that is vectors are invariant. This

5.6
Vector components
184
means that the product sums of vector components and
basis vectors, vµ⃗eµ = v1⃗e1 + v2⃗e2 + · · · , must be invari-
ant (see Eq. (5.32)). This invariance may be expressed in
two different ways. Either by using vector components,
uµ, that transform by means of the elements of the trans-
formation matrix, and basis vectors, ⃗eµ, that transform
by means of the elements of the inverse matrix. Or one
could introduce vector components, uµ, that transform
by means of the inverse matrix, and basis vectors, ⃗eµ, that
transform by means of the ordinary transformation ma-
trix. The ﬁrst way is called a contravariant decomposi-
tion of a vector, ‘contra’ because the basis vectors trans-
form by means of the inverse transformation matrix in
this case. This is the usual decomposition which we have
used all the time, with superscripts for the contravariant
vector components and subscripts for the ordinary basis
vectors, ⃗u = uµ⃗eµ. The second way of expressing the in-
variance of a vector, is called the covariant decomposition
of a vector, with subscripts for the covariant vector com-
ponents and superscripts for the basis vectors, ⃗u = uµ⃗eµ.
The basis vectors ⃗eµ are called covectors.
The covectors, ⃗eµ, are deﬁned implicitely by
⃗eµ · ⃗eν = δµ
ν,
(5.38)
where ⃗eν are the usual basis vectors, and δµν is the Kro-
necker symbol. The transformation formula for the cov-
ectors may be deduced as follows. From Eqs. (5.37) and

5.6
Vector components
185
(5.38) we get
∂xν
∂xν′⃗eµ′ · ⃗eν = ⃗eµ′ · ∂xν
∂xν′⃗eν = ⃗eµ′ · ⃗eν′ = δµ′
ν′.
(5.39)
Multiplying by the elements ∂xν′/∂xα of the transforma-
tion matrix, leads to
∂xν′
∂xα
∂xν
∂xν′⃗eµ′ · ⃗eν = ∂xν′
∂xα δµ′
ν′.
(5.40)
Applying Eqs. (5.38) and (5.15) we obtain
δν
α⃗eµ′ · ⃗eν = ⃗eµ′ · ⃗eα = ∂xµ′
∂xα = ∂xµ′
∂xµ δµ
α.
(5.41)
Using the deﬁnition (5.38) we get
⃗eµ′ · ⃗eα = ∂xµ′
∂xµ ⃗eµ · ⃗eα.
Hence
⃗eµ′ = ∂xµ′
∂xµ ⃗eµ.
(5.42)
Comparing with Eq. (5.13) we see that the covectors
transform in the same way as the contravariant vector
components. The transformation from the marked to the
unmarked system is
⃗eµ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′⃗eµ′.
(5.43)

5.7
Tensors
186
A vector may be decomposed along the covectors as fol-
lows
⃗u = uµ⃗eµ.
(5.44)
The transformation formula for the covariant vector com-
ponents are found by using Eq. (5.43)
⃗u = uµ⃗eµ = uµ
∂xµ
∂xµ′⃗eµ′ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′ uµ⃗eµ′ = uµ′⃗eµ′,
giving
uµ′ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′ uµ,
(5.45)
which shows that the covariant vector components trans-
form in the same way as the ordinary basis vectors.
The relationship between the ordinary basis vectors
and the covectors, and between the contravariant and co-
variant components of a vector ⃗A, is illustrated in Fig. 5.2.
5.7
Tensors
Until now we have considered scalar functions and vec-
tors. The value of a scalar function at a point is speciﬁed
by one number. Such functions are adequate to describe
simple ﬁelds, such as the temperature in a region. How-
ever, in order to represent mathematically the wind at
the surface of the Earth, it does not sufﬁce to specify one

188
number at each point. One needs to specify two numbers,
for example the velocity of the wind in the East-West di-
rection and in the North-South direction. A still more
complicated problem is to represent mathematically the
stresses in a body. Then one has to specify both the di-
rection of a force and the direction of the surface that the
force acts upon. One needs a quantity consisting of two
vectors. Such quantities of a certain type shall be deﬁned
below. They are called tensors of rank two. Vectors are
called tensors of rank one, and scalars are called tensors
of rank zero. Tensors have components, and the rank is
just the number of indices of their components.
When we talk of ‘vector ﬁelds’ we think of vectors
that are functions of the coordinates. However, a vector
can also be thought of as a linear function acting on other
vectors and giving out a real number. When one vector
acts upon another in this way, the real number it gives
out is the scalar product between the other vector and it-
self. There is an additional convention here. A vector,
thought of as a tensor of rank one, is only allowed to act
upon a vector of opposite type than itself. A basis vector
is called a contravariant tensor of rank one, and a covec-
tor is called a covariant tensor of rank one. A contravari-
ant tensor of rank one can only act upon a covariant basis
vector of rank one, and vice versa,
⃗eµ(⃗eν) = ⃗eµ · ⃗eν
and
⃗eµ(⃗eν) = ⃗eµ · ⃗eν.
The scalar product is deﬁned to be symmetrical. Using

5.7
Tensors
189
Eq. (5.38) we ﬁnd that the real numbers obtained when
the basis vectors act upon each other, are the values of
the Kronecker symbols,
⃗eµ(⃗eν) = ⃗eµ(⃗eν) = δµ
ν.
(5.46)
In order to be able to write a tensor of rank two or higher
in component form we must introduce the tensor prod-
uct, which is denoted by ⊗and deﬁned by
⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν(⃗eα,⃗eβ) = ⃗eµ(⃗eα)⃗eν(⃗eβ).
(5.47)
There are three types of basis tensors of rank two or
greater:
1. A contravariant basis tensor acts only upon covec-
tors.
2. A covariant basis tensor acts only upon ordinary vec-
tors.
3. A mixed basis tensor acts upon both ordinary vec-
tors and covectors.
Tensors of rank two can be written in component form as
linear combinations of basis tensors of the form ⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν,
⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν, ⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν, or ⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν :
E = Eµν⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν,
F = Fµν⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν,
G = Gµ
ν⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν,
H = Hµν⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν.

Tensors are a sort of generalized vectors. Like a vector, a
tensor has a coordinate independent existence. Under a
coordinate
transformation
the
tensor
components
change, but not the tensor itself. The transformation for-
mulae for the contravariant components of a tensor of
rank two can be deduced by using the transformation for-
mula Eq. (5.34) for the basis vectors,
S = Sµ′ν′⃗eµ′ ⊗⃗eν′ = Sµν⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν
= Sµν∂xµ′
∂xµ ⃗eµ′ ⊗∂xν′
∂xν ⃗eν′ = ∂xµ′
∂xµ

∂xν Sµν⃗eµ′ ⊗⃗eν′.
(5.49)
Hence
Sµ′ν′ = ∂xµ′
∂xµ
∂xν′
∂xν Sµν.
(5.50)
In the same way one ﬁnds the transformation formulae
for the covariant and the mixed components
Sµ′ν′ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′

∂xν′ Sµν,

The metric tensor
As we have mentioned above, the geometrical proper-
ties of coordinate systems reﬂect the geometrical proper-
ties, such as symmetries and curvature, of the space they
cover. This information about the geometry of a space
is imprinted in the way that the coordinate basis vector
ﬁelds (see Sect. 1.3 on vector ﬁelds) vary with position.
This, again, is encoded in the position and time depen-
dence of the scalar products, ⃗eµ·⃗eν, of all the basis vectors
in a coordinate system.
In systems of curved coordinates both the angle be-
tween basis vectors and their length may change from
neighbourhood to neighbourhood.
The situation is so
complicated that we need an exceedingly clever ‘nota-
tion’, that is, mathematical terminology, in order to be
able to easily survey the wilderness of changes. When
we deal with n dimensions, we get n2 scalar products be-
tween the basis vectors, all of which may change from
neighbourhood to neighbourhood,
⃗eµ · ⃗eν,
µ = 1, 2, . . . , n,
ν = 1, 2, . . . , n.

The ⃗e’s are basis vectors along coordinate curves that are,
in the general case, not straight. In what follows we shall
explain why and how the n2 quantities in (5.53) tell us
everything we need about the geometrical properties of
our coordinate system.
Figure 5.3: Basis vectors ⃗eµ and ⃗eν
Figure 5.3 shows two basis vectors ⃗eµ and ⃗eν with an
angle α between them. Equation (4.5) applied to the pres-
ent case shows that the projection of ⃗eν onto ⃗eµ, written
⃗eν∥, has a magnitude |⃗eν∥| = |⃗eν| cos α. From Eq. (1.8) for

5.8
The metric tensor
193
the scalar product of two vectors then follows
⃗eµ · ⃗eν = |⃗eµ||⃗eν| cos α.
(5.54)
Note from Eq. (5.54) that the order of the vectors
means nothing for the magnitude or the sign of the scalar
product. This is expressed by saying that the scalar prod-
uct is symmetrical under exchange of the vectors:
⃗eµ · ⃗eν = ⃗eν · ⃗eµ.
(5.55)
The mathematicians’ response to the demand for a clever
terminology, making it possible to treat all the scalar
products in a systematic way, was to invent a new con-
cept: the metric tensor. In Ch. 1 we introduced, just as an
anticipation of things to come, the famous expression of
the components of the metric tensor
gµν ≡⃗eµ · ⃗eν
(5.56)
where each ⃗eµ is a basis vector ﬁeld, like the vector ﬁeld in
Fig. 1.4, i.e. the magnitudes and directions of the vectors
depend upon the position. This implies that the compo-
nents, gµν, of the metric tensor are in general functions of
the coordinates.
The three lines indicate that (5.56) is not an equation.
It is a regulative deﬁnition announcing that in what fol-
lows the expression gµν will be used as a short-hand for
⃗eµ · ⃗eν.

5.8
The metric tensor
194
According to the deﬁnition (5.56) and Eq. (5.55) the
metric tensor is symmetrical,
gνµ = gµν.
(5.57)
The number of independent components, gµν, of the met-
ric tensor is thereby reduced from n2 to n(n+1)/2 in an n-
dimensional space. In spaces of one, two, three and four
dimensions, for example, the metric tensor has respec-
tively one, three, six and ten independent components.
These are usually written in matrix form. For the men-
tioned number of dimensions they are, respectively

5.8
The metric tensor
195
where we have written only the independent compon-
ents. The unwritten components on the upper right half
of the matrices are equal to those on the lower left part.
In a coordinate system where the basis vectors are or-
thogonal to each other, the scalar products of different ba-
sis vectors are zero, according to Eq. (5.54) since α = π/2
for orthogonal vectors, and cos(π/2) = 0. Only the scalar
products of each vector by itself are different from zero.
This means that in a coordinate system with orthogonal
basis vectors, only the components of the metric tensor
with equal indices are different from zero.
Since they
are found along the diagonal when the components are
written as a matrix, such a metric tensor is called diago-
nal. Thus, in the case of a right angled coordinate system
in four-dimensional spacetime, the metric tensor has the
form
gµν =


(5.58)
To save space this is usually written as
gµν = diag[g11, g22, g33, g44].
(5.59)
Example 5.1 The simplest two-dimensional case is the metric
of a Cartesian coordinate system in a plane. Then the only
scalar products of basis vectors different from zero are⃗ex·⃗ex = 1

and ⃗ey ·⃗ey = 1, and the only non-vanishing components of the
metric tensor are,
g11 = g22 = 1.
(5.60)
Example 5.2 Let us now, as an illustration, calculate the com-
ponents of the metric tensor in the coordinate system with
plane polar coordinates.
The basis vectors are given in
Eqs. (5.35) and (5.36). The scalar products are
⃗er · ⃗er = (cos θ⃗ex + sin θ⃗ey) (cos θ⃗ex + sin θ⃗ey)

(5.63)

5.8
The metric tensor
197
Equation (5.63) shows that the basis vectors of the coordinate
system with plane polar coordinates are orthogonal, as shown
in Fig. 4.10. Thus the metric tensor is diagonal, and—con-
cluding this example—the only nonvanishing components are
g11 = 1
and
g22 = r2.
(5.64)
The transformation of the scalar products of the basis
vectors under a change of coordinate system follows from
Eq. (5.37)
⃗eµ′ · ⃗eν′ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′⃗eµ · ∂xν
∂xν′⃗eν = ∂xµ
∂xµ′
∂xν
∂xν′⃗eµ · ⃗eν.
(5.65)
From the deﬁnition (5.56) and Eq. (5.65) follows that the
components of the metric tensor transform in the same
way as the scalar products of the basis vectors
gµ′ν′ = ∂xµ
∂xµ′
∂xν
∂xν′ gµν.
(5.66)
Comparing with the ﬁrst of Eqs. (5.49) we see that gµν
transform as covariant components of a tensor of rank 2.
The new components are linear combinations of the old
ones.
Note that expressions such as ∂xµ
∂xµ′ ∂xν
∂xν′ are products of
two factors, and not a double differentiation. In the case
of a two-dimensional space, with one coordinate system

Example 5.3 Let us, as an illustrating application of this
equation, transform the components of the metric tensor in
a plane from a Cartesian coordinate system to a system with
plane polar coordinates. Here we choose x1 = x, x2 = y,
x1′ = r, and x2′ = θ. Equations (5.67), (4.25) and (5.60)

in accordance with Eq. (5.64).
Note that we need to mark
the indices only in a transformation equation, where we relate
the components in two different coordinate systems, not in an
equation such as Eq. (5.64) where only the components in one
coordinate system appear.
The components, in a certain coordinate system, of
the metric tensor of a space is often called just the met-
ric. From the deﬁnition (5.56) is seen that the metric is
directly related to a coordinate system, it is a ‘personal
signature’, its ‘ﬁngerprint’.

However, the general theory of relativity is not a the-
ory of coordinate systems, but of the space we suppos-
edly live in: physics, not mathematics. The metric is a
fundamental element of this theory. And it does indeed
contain information not only of coordinate systems. In
fact, from the metric we can extract everything we want
to know about the geometry of the mathematically de-
ﬁned space that the coordinate system ﬁlls. Mathemati-
cally deﬁned spaces are used as ‘models’ of the physical
space. How all this comes about you are invited to learn
in the following chapters. It requires particular attention
to the contents of Ch. 6—the famous Christoffel symbol—
and Ch. 9 which introduces the Riemann curvature ten-
sor.
5.9
Covariant and contravariant ten-
sor components
In Sects. 5.6 and 5.7 we met covariant, contravariant and
mixed tensor components. Even if one can perform all
calculations in general relativity in terms of one sort of
components only, some expressions are simpliﬁed when
different types of tensor components are allowed. There-
fore it has become common practice to use both covari-
ant, contravariant and mixed tensor components in rela-
tivistic calculations.

5.9
Tensor components
201
We shall here introduce the contravariant and mixed
components of the metric tensor, and we shall show how
the different sorts of tensor components can be calculated
from each other by means of the covariant and contra-
variant components of the metric tensor.
The contravariant components of the metric tensor are
deﬁned by
gµν = ⃗eµ · ⃗eν.
(5.70)
From Eqs. (5.70), (5.15) and (5.39) we have
⃗eµ · ⃗eν = gµν = gναδµ
α = gνα⃗eµ · ⃗eα = ⃗eµ · gνα⃗eα.
(5.71)
Hence
⃗eν = gνα⃗eα.
(5.72)
From this, together with Eq. (5.56), we get
gµνgνα = gµν⃗eν · ⃗eα = ⃗eµ · ⃗eα.
(5.73)
Applying Eq. (5.38) we have
gµνgνα = δµ
α.
(5.74)
Using this equation one can calculate the contravariant
components of the metric tensor from the covariant com-
ponents. If the metric tensor is diagonal, so that gνα ̸= 0
only for α = ν, Eq. (5.74) implies gµµgνν = 1 for ν = µ,
which gives
gµµ = 1/gµµ.
(5.75)

5.9
Tensor components
202
We shall now ﬁnd how the covariant vector compo-
nents can be calculated from the contravariant compo-
nents and the metric tensor. Multiplying the equation
uα⃗eα = uα⃗eα
by ⃗eµ we get
uα⃗eα · ⃗eµ = uα⃗eα · ⃗eµ.
Using Eq. (5.38) on the left-hand-side and Eqs. (5.56) and
(5.57) on the right-hand side give
uαδα
µ = uαgαµ = gµαuα
or
uµ = gµαuα.
(5.76)
Calculating uµ from Eq. (5.76) is called lowering a tensor
index.
A corresponding formula for raising a tensor index is
found by using, successively, Eqs. (5.15), (5.74) and (5.76),
uµ = δµ
αuα = gµνgναuα = gµνuν.
(5.77)
Hence, by means of the metric tensor the contravariant
components are mapped upon the covariant ones, and
vice versa.
The general expression (1.26) for the scalar product of
two vectors is
⃗u ·⃗v = gµνuµvν.
(5.78)

5.9
Tensor components
203
In three dimensions, for example, this is a short hand
notation for the nine terms in Eq. (1.27). Inserting ﬁrst
uν = gνµuµ = gµνuµ from Eq. (5.76), and then vµ = gµνvν,
Eq. (5.78) may be written in two alternative ways
⃗u ·⃗v = uνvν = uµvµ.
The mixed components of the metric tensor, gµ
ν, are de-
ﬁned by
gµ
ν = ⃗eµ · ⃗eν.
From Eq. (5.38) then follows
gµ
ν = δµ
ν.
(5.79)
Equation (5.79) shows that the mixed components of the
metric tensor are the values of the Kronecker symbol.
As mentioned above, if the components of a tensor
have one index, the tensor is said to be of rank 1. Thus,
vectors are, in fact, tensors of rank 1. The components
of the metric tensor are a set of quantities with two in-
dices. It is said to be of rank 2. This holds whatever the
dimensions of the space. The transformation formulae
for tensors of rank 2 are given in Eqs. (5.50) and (5.51).
There are sets of quantities which also transform simi-
larly, but have more than two indices, let us say three, µ,
ν, and α. If three, the tensor is said to be of rank 3. They
may be of any rank. The transformation formulae of the
tensor components are deduced in the same way as in

5.9
Tensor components

Eq. (5.50). The contravariant components, for example,
transform according to the following rules

For all these quantities it is sufﬁcient that they trans-
form similarly to vectors. This secures the decisive co-
ordinate independence, which is used in mathematical
formulations of the basic natural laws whatever the com-
plicated circumstances, say the steadiness and invariance
of laws of oceanic waves in hurricanes. The variation of
wind direction results in inﬁnitely complicated forms of
interfering wave-ridges, but presumably not in new basic
‘laws’.
The tensor-notation is superbly economical: it makes
sets of equations surveyable and understandable, which
otherwise would be completely impossible to grasp. A

His comment is laconic: “There are about 280 billion =

those which do not vanish.”
He ends up with a very
short formula—thanks to the ingenious tensor-notation.
Without that instrument it might have been several mil-

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
In the general theory of relativity gravitation is described
geometrically in terms of curved four-dimensional space-
time.
This spacetime has a strange property which is
apparent even in the ﬂat spacetime of the special the-
ory of relativity. Although ﬂat, its geometry is not Eu-
clidean. The distance between two points in spacetime
is not given by the usual form of the Pythagorean theo-
rem. The new form of the Pythagorean theorem, valid for
four-dimensional spacetime, will be deduced in the next

section, from the postulates of the special theory of rela-
tivity; that the velocity of light does not depend upon the
motion of the light source and is equal in all directions,
and that it is impossible, by performing experiments in-
side a laboratory, to measure any velocity of the labo-
ratory.
Thus the laws of nature should be formulated
so that they are valid, unchanged, whatever the move-
ment of the laboratory. This means that if we write down
an equation representing a physical law, with reference
to a certain laboratory frame, and then translate to an-
other frame moving relatively to the ﬁrst, the equation
should not change. Thus, each term of the equation must
change in the same way under the transformation be-
tween the two frames. In the special theory of relativ-
ity such a change of frame is done mathematically by ap-
plying the so-called Lorentz transformation that we shall
now introduce.
Imagine a gardener sitting on a bench, getting more
and more excited as he is observing what looks like an
odd hummingbird. The hummingbird ﬂies with constant
velocity along a straight line. She has a watch, a yardstick
and an organ that emits an extremely short ﬂash of light
just as she passes the gardener. The gardener, who is a
hobby mathematician, decides to imagine a Cartesian co-
ordinate system {x, y, z} with x-axis along the travelling
line of the hummingbird and with himself sitting at the
origin, x = 0. Also he adjusts his clocks to show zero

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
207
when the hummingbird passes him. In the gardener’s
coordinate system the position of the hummingbird at a
point of time t is
x = vt,
and
y = z = 0.
(5.81)
When the hummingbird ﬂies straight away with velocity
v along the gardener’s x-axis, she considers herself as be-
ing at rest at point zero of her x′-axis. Both the gardener
and the odd hummingbird knows the Galilean transfor-
mation equations
x′ = x −vt,
y′ = y,
z′ = z,
and
t′ = t.
(5.82)
Equations (5.81) and (5.82) imply that the position of the
hummingbird on her own axis is
x′ = x −vt = 0
and
y′ = z′ = 0,
(5.83)
showing that the hummingbird is indeed at rest at the
origin of the marked coordinate system.
Neither mechanical nor optical experiments, nor any
other sorts of experiments can decide whether the gar-
dener or the hummingbird is at rest. They may both con-
sider themselves at as rest and the other one as moving.
This is the gist of Einstein’s special principle of relativity
expressed in layman terms.
Observing the ﬂash of light emitted by the humming-
bird they both ﬁnd (surprisingly) that light travels iso-
tropically with the speed c and expands into a spherical

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
208
surface with radius ct. This is essentially what Einstein’s
second postulate says.
Because the hummingbird inevitably ﬂies along a ra-
dius of the sphere away from the centre x = 0, the gar-
dener says he occupies a privileged position and remains
at the centre, whereas she, at x′ = 0, gets further and
further away from the centre. “Not so”, says the hum-
mingbird, “I am at the centre all the time”. The gardener
replies: “As you like it, honey, but see to it that I need to
change my way of thinking as little as possible.”
What is the least possible change of the Galilean trans-
formation equations (5.18) such that the gardener and the
hummingbird both can maintain that they are perman-
ently at rest at the centre of the light wave, although they
move relative to each other? The hummingbird promises
to ﬁnd a way out. But there are a few preliminary steps,
she says. We must acknowledge that the equations of the
two spherical surfaces are
x2 + y2 + z2 = (ct)2
(5.84)
x′2 + y′2 + z′2 = (ct′)2.
(5.85)
The radii ct and ct′ expand proportionally to time. By
subtracting the ﬁrst equation from the second:
 x′2 −x2
+
 y′2 −y2
+
 z′2 −z2
= c2  t′2 −t2
. (5.86)

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
209
We postulate that motion along the x axis does not inﬂu-
ence the results of measuring distances in the (transverse)
y and z directions. (Remember the promise of least pos-
sible change.) Thus
y′ = y
and
z′ = z
are still valid in our new transformation. Equation (5.86)
then is reduced to
x′2 −x2 = c2  t′2 −t2
or
x′2 −c2t′2 = x2 −c2t2.
(5.87)
These were the preliminary steps. To proceed further
we demand that the new transformation shall deviate as
little as possible from the Galilean transformation. So we
assume that the new transformation has the form x′ =
γ(x −vt) and t′ = t, where γ is a positive constant to be
determined by inserting the expressions for x′ and t′ in
Eq. (5.87). However, inserting t′ = t into Eq. (5.87) gives
x′ = x. This is only an ‘identity transformation’, so the
proposed form of the transformation does not work.
A more radical solution is necessary in order to ob-
tain a consistent kinematics, so that both the gardener
and the hummingbird can regard themselves as perma-
nently at the centre of the spherical light wave emitted
by the hummingbird as it passed the gardner. We try a

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
210
time transformation of the form
t = ax + bt,
(5.88)
where a and b are constants. Here t′ is time measured
with clocks at rest relative to the hummingbird, and t
time measured with clocks at rest relative to the gardener.
The physical consequence of a time transformation of the
form (5.88) is unexpected. It implies that simultaneous
events in the gardner’s system are not simultaneous in
the hummingbird’s system, and vice versa. This can be
seen as follows.
The proposed coordinate transformation has the form
x′ = γ (x −vt)
and
t′ = at + bx.
(5.89)
Consider two events with coordinates x1 and x2 that the
gardner says are simultaneous. They happen for exam-
ple at t1 = t2 = 0. The hummingbird then says that the
events happen at the points of time t′
1 = bx1 and t2 = bx2.
Events that are simultaneous according to the gardener,
happens with a time difference t′
2 −t′
1 = b(x2 −x1) ac-
cording to the hummingbird.
This so-called ‘relativity of simultaneity’ is what
makes the seemingly contradictory observations of the
gardener and the hummingbird possible. What the hum-
mingbird says is the light wave at a certain instant, the
gardner will say is a succession of pictures of different

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
211
parts of the wave at different points of time. The hum-
mingbird will say the same about the gardener’s wave.
We shall now go on and calculate the constants γ, a,
and b in terms of the relative velocity v between the gar-
dener and the hummingbird and the velocity of light, c.
Inserting the expressions for x′ and t′ into Eq. (5.87) re-
sults in
[γ (x −vt)]2 −c2 (at + bx)2 = x2 −c2t2.
Multplying out the left-hand side we get
γ2x2 −2γ2vxt + γ2v2t2 −c2a2t2 −2c2abxt −c2b2x2
= x2 −c2t2.
Collecting terms with the same powers of x and t gives

= x2 −c2t2.
In order that the left-hand and right-hand side of this
equation shall be equal for arbitrary values of x and t,
the coefﬁcients in front of x2, of xt and of t2, must be the
same at each side of the equality sign. This leads to
γ2 −c2b2 = 1,
(5.90)
γ2v + c2ab = 0,
(5.91)

and

Inserting this into Eq. (5.90), we get

c2a2 = γ2 −1.
Thus
c2a2 = γ4v2
γ2 −1.

γ2v2 −γ4v2
γ2 −1 = −c2.
Multiplying each term by γ2 −1 leads to
γ4v2 −γ2v2 −γ4v2 = −γ2c2 + c2.

These famous transformation equations are called the
“Lorentz transformation”.
Lorentz was the contempo-
rary phycisist Einstein admired most. “Everything that
emanated from his surpremely great mind was as clear
and beautiful as a good work of art.”
Suppose we are in a strange civilization where we are
invited to travel just behind a beam of the light of a dis-
tant star. (When he was 16 Einstein dreamed about such
a travel.) If we follow the light, it would be nearly at rest
relative to us, we might think. It would not! Experience
suggests to us that light travels ahead of every observer
with the same velocity c. It forces us to concede that the
universe may be radically different from what we might
expect. Our conceptions about the properties of the uni-

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
215
verse on the whole are based upon experiences involv-
ing very small velocities compared to that of light. We
have had no good reason to expect anything as dramatic
as such a property of light. It is therefore justiﬁable to call
it a near miracle that our simple changes of the Galilei
transformation take wonderful care of this strange kind
of observation. How could one expect such a strange mir-
acle? It is understandable that Einstein and others played
with the idea of God as a mathematician fond of simple,
beautiful and ‘deep’ formulae.
It is sometimes said: After all, the special theory of rel-
ativity, in which the Lorentz transformation plays a sig-
niﬁcant role, means only a slight correction of the
Galilean and Newtonian kinematics. Perhaps it may be
looked upon only as a generalization or widening of the
old theory. Nothing could be more misleading!
Newton’s
theory
includes
Newton’s
conceptual
framework and his general understanding of what he
considered the physical world to be like.
To this the-
ory belongs Universal Time, Absolute Space and a wealth
of more or less abstract general theorems. The Newto-
nian theory is not ‘approximately relativistic’, even if its
predictions are nearly the same as those of the theory of
relativity for moderate velocities, because the theoretical
structure is deeply different. Newton asserts something
completely incompatible with the special theory of rela-
tivity. From observational reports alone you can never

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
216
deduce any theory. A set of reported mesurements can be
‘explained’ through indeﬁnitely many theorems. These
may even be inconsistent with each other.
Through observation we discover things. Abstract the-
ories are inventions. The fabulous success of some of these
inventions surprises us.
There is, perhaps, some kind
of hidden harmony between structures of thought and
structures of physical reality?
Something established
through hundred of millions of years of evolution?
The clash with habitual thinking is formidable com-
pared to the small change in mathematical formulae.
Suppose the hummingbird emits a ﬂash while ﬂying 9/10
the speed of light. The gardener thinks: she ﬂies just be-
hind the surface of the expanding sphere of light created
by the ﬂash, observing a velocity equal to 30,000 km/sec
for the light. But she knows otherwise: a measurement
would reveal that the light she emitted travels not with
a velocity 30,000 km/sec, but with the velocity 300,000
km/sec, away from her, as if she had been sitting quietly
with the gardener. Whether you ﬂy toward it or away
from it, you measure the same speed of light.
Such measurements were actually performed by
Michelson and Morley in 1887. They knew that the Earth
moves in an elliptical orbit around the Sun with a veloc-
ity of about 30 km/s, and wanted to measure this velocity
from its effect upon the propagation of light. The veloc-
ity of light relative to the Earth should be 60 km/s less

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
217
in the forward direction than in the backwards direction.
Michelson and Morley found a method by which they
could measure such a difference in the velocity of light,
even if it were only a tenth of the magnitude they sought
for due to the motion of the Earth. The shocking result of
the experiment was that they measured no difference at
all for the velocity of light in the forward and the back-
ward directions.
Whatever the intensity of democratic feelings, the no-
tion that we all remain at the centre, whatever our speed
relative to the light source was, and still is, felt as an af-
front to common sense. Einstein, when he learned about
the result of the Michelson–Morley experiment, was not
shocked. He had thought for many years about space and
time, and gained an openness for what would be a deep-
ening of common sense. He saw that measurements in-
volving speed, for instance by the gardener and the hum-
mingbird, rests on postulates about what simultaneity is
and how it is measured by means of light beams. He ar-
rived at new notions of time and space which satisﬁed
reason. These notions made it possible not to consider
the Michelson–Morley results as a brute, strange fact, but
to place them in an orderly understandable whole.
One can make a correspondence between (mathemat-
ical) space and physical objects by associating the points
of a space with the position of particles (without spatial
extension). This is the space of our daily life, and also that

5.10
The Lorentz transformation
218
of the pre-relativistic physics. Understood in this way,
space is part of our material world. There is a similar cor-
respondence between points in spacetime and events (i.e.
idealized physical events without extension in space and
time).
We shall brieﬂy return to the relativity of simultane-
ity. Let a train, moving past a station with velocity v, be
our reference frame Σ′ with comoving coordinates x′ and
t′. The station is a frame Σ with coordinates x and t. A
passenger in Σ′ observes that the front and back doors
of his wagon suddenly open (by a deplorable technical
accident), at a point of time t′ = 0. The co-moving coor-
dinates of the doors are x′ = 0 and x′ = L0, where L0 is
the length of the wagon.
The position and point of time of the events that the
doors were opened, as observed from the station, are
given by the Lorentz transformation, Eq. (5.98). The in-
verse transformation, from Σ′ to Σ, is obtained from
Eq. (5.98) just by replacing v by −v , giving
x = γ(x′ + vt′)
and
t = γ

t′ + v

.
Inserting x′ = t′ = 0 for the opening of the back door,
gives x = t = 0. Inserting x′ = L0 and t′ = 0 for the open-
ing of the front door, gives x = γL0 and t = γ(v/c2)L0.
We see that even if the doors open simultaneously as ob-
served from the wagon, the front door opens later than
the back door as observed from the station.

multaneity does not exist, i.e. two events that are simul-
taneous to one observer, are not simultaneous to another
one, moving relative to the ﬁrst. Hence, space and time
cannot be regarded as independent.
This motivated
Minkowski to open his famous address to the Congress of
Scientists, Cologne, September 21, 1908 with the words,
“Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are
doomed to fade away in mere shadows, and only a kind
of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.”
5.11
The relativistic time dilation
The invariance of the velocity of light has an interesting
consequence which concerns the rate of time as measured
with a moving so-called ‘standard clock’. By deﬁnition
the effect we shall deduce does not depend upon the na-
ture of the clock, so we can choose to analyze a particu-
larly simple clock, consisting essentially of a light signal
being reﬂected between a ﬂoor and a ceiling. Such a clock
is sometimes called a ‘photon clock’.
Imagine that our clock is at rest in the ‘train frame’
Σ′. The height between the ﬂoor and the ceiling is L0.
Each reﬂection is a ‘tick’. The light signals are assumed
to move vertically as observed in the train system. Then

5.11
The relativistic time dilation
220
the time interval between two ticks is
∆t′ = L0
c .
(5.99)
This is how fast the clock ticks in the frame where it is at
rest.
The train with the clock moves past a station with ve-
locity v. Within the theory of relativity the letter v always
represents a relative velocity, here the velocity of the train
relative to the station. In the ‘station frame’ Σ the path of
the light signal is zig zag shaped as shown in Fig. 5.4.

Since the velocity of light is c in every direction as
observed on the station as well as in the train, the time
intervals between two ticks is gives by the Pythagorean
theorem as follows

rive at
∆t =

(5.100)
Here ∆t is the time interval between the ticks of the
train clock as observed in the station frame. In this frame
the clock moves with velocity v. Equation (5.100) implies
that ∆t > ∆t′, which means that the time intervals be-
tween the ticks of the train clock are greater as observed
from the station than observed from the train. Thus the
clock is observed to go slower in the frame in which it
moves than as observed in the frame in which it is at rest.
In short: a moving clock goes slower than a clock at rest. This
is the special relativistic velocity dependent time dilation.
At the limit that the velocity of the clock approaches
the velocity of light, the time intervals between the ticks
of the clock become indeﬁnitely large. A clock that moves
with the velocity of light goes inﬁnitely slowly.

The line element
As mentioned above, Einstein decided to describe gravity
geometrically in terms of curved spacetime. In order to
understand how the metric tensor enters the theoretical
structure invented to describe a curved space, we should
note that it is not possible to ‘ﬁll’ such a space with a
Cartesian coordinate system, where all coordinate curves
are orthogonal and straight. This is easily realized if you
think of mapping the Earth. In order that a geometer who
is feeling his way in an arbitrary wace shall be able to ex-
tract information concerning the geometry of the wace
from his local measurements, he must be able to describe
the measuring results in a coordinate independent way.
Remember that any wace has geometrical properties
of a local character. Think of the surface of the Earth, for
example. You would, perhaps, like to deﬁne a distance-
vector between your home and the North Pole. But such
a vector does not exist on the surface of the Earth. Vec-
tors may be imagined as arrows, straight in the usual,
Euclidean sense. A distance vector would have to pass
through a tunnel inside the Earth, and this is not part of
our wace, which is only the surface of the Earth. How-
ever, indeﬁnitely short distance vectors between points
very near each other remain arbitrarily close to the sur-
face of the Earth. They are reckoned as part of the wace.
You may compare a distance vector with the tangent

5.12
The line element
223
vector introduced in Chapter 3. There we considered a
one-dimensional wace, namely the parabola of Fig. 3.4.
It is clearly seen from the ﬁgure that any ﬁnite tangent
vector ⃗u departs from the parabola. It does not exist in
the curved wace represented by the parabola.
However, it is possible to measure ﬁnite distances on
the surface of the Earth. This is done by ‘adding indeﬁ-
nitely small distances’ (integrating) along a curve on the
surface of the Earth. The small ‘distance differentials’ are
deﬁned in the same way for curved waces in general, as
for a ﬂat wace.
We need not introduce any coordinate system in or-
der to deﬁne the distance between two (indeﬁnitely close)
points in a wace. Mathematically the distance can be ex-
pressed as a coordinate independent quantity, namely the
indeﬁnitely small distance vector between the points, i.e.
the differential of the distance vector ⃗r, which we denote
by d⃗r.
If we introduce a coordinate system, the components
of ⃗dr along the coordinate curves are called coordinate dif-
ferentials and are written dxµ, i.e.
d⃗r = dxµ⃗eµ.
(5.101)
We now introduce a coordinate independent expression
for the square of the distance, dℓ2, between the points, by
taking the dot product of the indeﬁnitely small distance

5.12
The line element
224
vector by itself,
dℓ2 ≡d⃗r · d⃗r.
(5.102)
In order to obtain some feeling for what we talk about,
let us consider a simple example. A geometer is going to
map a ﬂat, two-dimensional plane. He may introduce
a Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates x and y.
He is at a point P with coordinates (x, y), moves a dis-
tance dx along the x axis, and then a distance dy along
the y axis, and arrives at a point Q with coordinates (x +
dx, y + dy). Then the distance vector from P to Q is
⃗dr = dx⃗ex + dy⃗ey.
From the deﬁnition (5.102) and Eq. (1.9) follows
dℓ2 = dx2 + dy2.
(5.103)
This corresponds to calculating the distance by means of
the Pythagorean theorem.
If we introduce plane polar coordinates r and θ (see
Fig. 4.9) the inﬁnitesimal distance vector, Eq. (5.101),
takes the form
⃗dr = dr⃗er + dθ⃗eθ.
Taking the dot product of this vector by itself we get
dℓ2 = (dr⃗er + dθ⃗eθ) · (dr⃗er + dθ⃗eθ)
= dr2⃗er · ⃗er + dr dθ⃗er · ⃗eθ
+ dθ dr⃗eθ · ⃗er + dθ2 ⃗eθ · ⃗eθ.
(5.104)

5.12
The line element
225
Since the basis vectors ⃗er and ⃗eθ are normal to each other,
⃗er · ⃗eθ = ⃗eθ · ⃗er = 0. According to Eqs. (4.41) and (4.44)
⃗er · ⃗er = 1 and ⃗eθ · ⃗eθ = r2. Using these results, Eq. (5.104)
is reduced to
dℓ2 = dr2 + r2dθ2.
(5.105)
Even if the expressions (5.103) and (5.105) are different,
they lead to the same number of metres for the distance
between the points P and Q. The deﬁnition (1.31) of ‘dis-
tance’ is such that it doesn’t matter what sort of coordi-
nate system one uses; the calculated distance is the same
whatever system one uses. This is more technically ex-
pressed by saying that the distance between two points is
a coordinate invariant quantity.
Let us show this explicitly, for our example. Accord-
ing to Eq. (4.31) the transformation between the Cartesian
coordinates (x, y) and the plane polar coordinates (r, θ) is
x = r cos θ
and
y = r sin θ.
By differentiation, using Eq. (5.4) with x1′ = x, x2′ = y,
x1 = r, and x2 = θ, we get
dx = cos θ dr−r sin θ dθ
and
dy = sin θ dr+r cos θ dθ.
Inserting this into Eq. (5.103) yields
dℓ2 = (cos θ dr −r sin θ dθ)2 + (sin θ dr + r cos θ dθ)2 .

5.12
The line element
226
Squaring leads to
dℓ2 = cos2 θ dr2 −2r cos θ sin θ drdθ + r2 sin2 θ dθ2
+ sin2 θ dr2 + 2r sin θ cos θ drdθ + r2 cos2 θ dθ2
=
 cos2 θ + sin2 θ



dθ2.
Using the identity sin2 θ + cos2 θ = 1 we obtain
dℓ2 = dr2 + r2dθ2.
This is the same equation as Eq. (5.105). It is the Pytha-
gorean theorem for a (two-dimensional) Euclidean plane
as expressed in polar coordinates. The equality of the ex-
pressions (5.103) and (5.105), i.e.
dℓ2 = dx2 + dy2 = dr2 + r2 dθ2
may be seen most directly geometrically, as shown in
Fig. 5.5.
Let us now direct the attention towards four-
dimensional spacetime. Again we shall consider the sim-
plest case, ﬂat spacetime, as in special relativity. Imagine
there are two laboratories, with observers and measur-
ing apparatus, one moving in the x direction with veloc-
ity v relative to the other. Their description of physical
phenomena and geometrical relationships are related by
the Lorentz transformation, Eq. (5.98). Since y′ = y and
z′ = z, we may discard the y and z dimensions with-
out losing anything of interest. We therefore consider ﬂat

two-dimensional spacetime with one space dimension,
that one along the x axis, and one time dimension.
What is the mathematical expression for the distance
between two points O and P near each other in this two-
dimensional spacetime?
Let us choose two coordinate
systems, {x, t} and {x′, t′} with O as common origin. The
other point P have coordinates (dx, dt) and (dx′, dt′), re-
spectively in the two coordinate systems. It would per-
haps seem natural to introduce a quantity ‘remoteness’
in spacetime analogous to distance in space, namely
dζ =
 dx2 + c2dt21/2 .
(5.106)
(The reason that we have multiplied dt2 with c2 is that
mathematically it is only possible to add commensurable
quantities, i.e. quantities that may be counted by the same
types of units. You cannot add a number of metres and a

5.12
The line element
228
number of seconds. However, a fraction of a ‘light sec-
ond’, c dt, where dt is a fraction of a second, is a cer-
tain number of metres, and can be added to a distance
dx. And the square of a number of light seconds can be
added to the square of a distance, which is what we have
done above.)
The above expression implies that an event which is
not remote from us must be close to us both in space
and time. An event can be remote because it happens far
away or because it happens at a time very different from
our now, or both.
In order that remoteness shall be a useful quantity for
the description of physical phenomena, the remoteness
between two events should be the same number of me-
tres whether it is measured by an observer in a moving
laboratory with coordinates {x′, t′}, or in a stationary lab-
oratory with coordinates {x, t}, i.e. the remoteness should
be Lorentz invariant. From the Lorentz transformation,
Eq. (5.98), we have
dx′ = dx −vdt
q
1 −v2
c2
and
dt′ = dt −v
c2dx

.
(5.107)
Inserting this into the expression (5.106) for remoteness,
squaring and simplifying, leads to

1 −v2
c2
dζ2 −

5.12
The line element
229
This shows that remoteness is not a Lorentz invariant
quantity.
If, for example the remoteness between two
events, as measured in the unprimed system, is dζ =
3, then the remoteness between the same two events, as
measured in the primed system is dζ′ ̸= 3. Because of this
dependence upon the velocity of the observer, the quan-
tity remoteness has not been introduced in the standard
version of the theory of relativity.
However, the experiences of the hummingbird and
the gardener suggest the existence of a Lorentz invariant
sort of ‘spacetime interval’. The velocity of light is equal
to c both as measured by the hummingbird and the gar-
dener. Hence
dx′
dt′ = c
and
dx
dt = c,
which gives
dx′2 = c2dt′2
and
dx2 = c2dt2
or
dx′2 −c2dt′2 = 0 = dx2 −c2dt2.
(5.108)
This equation shows that the quantity dx2 −c2dt2 is
Lorentz invariant and it is equal to zero for coordinate
differentials associated with the propagation of a light
signal. The value zero is speciﬁc for light signals, but the
Lorentz invariance of the expression may be valid in gen-
eral. Let us investigate if this is really the case.

5.12
The line element
230
We start by inserting the coordinate differentials
(5.107) into ds2 ≡dx′2−c2dt′2 where we have introduced
ds2 as a short-hand notation for the new spacetime inter-

5.12
The line element
231
Note that the Lorentz invariance of dx2 −c2 dt2 should be
expected, since the expression is essentially the same as
Eq. (5.87), and the differentials dx and dt transform as x
and t.
The ﬁrst and last short expression of the series of ex-
pressions in (5.109) is the so-called line element of our
two-dimensional ﬂat spacetime, as expressed in Carte-
sian coordinate systems. Equation (5.109) shows that the
line element is Lorentz invariant. In general, the line ele-
ment is denoted by ds2. It is the square of an inﬁnitesimal
‘distance’ in spacetime. If we add the y and z dimensions,
the line element of four-dimensional ﬂat spacetime, as ex-
pressed in a Cartesian coordinate system, takes the form
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 −c2dt2.
(5.110)
This expression may be thought of as an extension of the
Pythagorean theorem from ordinary space with a Carte-
sian coordinate system, to a corresponding coordinate
system in four-dimensional ﬂat spacetime.
Before we proceed to express the line element, ds2, in
arbitrary coordinate-systems, we shall interpret it phys-
ically. The physical interpretation of the line element of
spacetime does not depend upon the geometrical prop-
erties of spacetime, or what sort of coordinates we use.
So we can discuss the interpretation with reference to the
special form of the line element in Eq. (5.110) with conﬁ-
dence that the interpretation we arrive at will be valid in

5.13
Minkowski diagrams and light cones
232
general.
5.13
Minkowski diagrams and light
cones
In order to exhibit the causal structure of spacetime we
shall in this section consider ﬂat spacetime. This structure
does not depend upon the number of spatial dimensions,
so we may, for the present purpose, consider a ﬂat two-
dimensional spacetime. We introduce a two-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system {x, ct}. A spacetime diagram
with a vertical ct axis and a horizontal x axis is called a
Minkowski-diagram.
Figure 5.6: Worldlines of two photons and a massive par-
ticle

5.13
Minkowski diagrams and light cones
233
Let x4 = ct. The path of a particle of light, i.e. a photon,
passing through the origin at the point of time t = 0, and
moving in the positive x direction, is given by x = ct =
x4. This is called the worldline of the photon. It is a straight
line through the origin of the Minkowski-diagram, mak-
ing an angle at 45 degrees with the axes, which means
that the component of the spacetime velocity of light in
the time direction is equal to its component in the space
direction. Thus, the velocity of light is isotropic in space-
time as well as in ordinary three-dimensional space.
Photons are said to have vanishing rest mass. Particles
with non-vanishing rest mass move slower than light.
They cover a smaller distance in the x direction per sec-
ond than light. Accordingly the worldline of a massive
particle passing x = 0 at t = 0 is a line closer to the ct axis
in the Minkowski-diagram than the worldline of a pho-
ton (see Fig. 5.6). The worldline of a photon moving in
the negative x direction is also shown on the ﬁgure.
Imagine that there is a person at x = 0 emitting a ﬂash
of light a the point of time t = 0. Using material particles,
or reﬂecting electromagnetic signals in a suitable way, he
may inﬂuence events taking place in the region of space-
time between the worldlines of the two photons. This re-
gion may be causally connected to an event at the origin.
It represents the absolute future of this event, in the sense
that no event exists in this region that is contemporary or
past relative to the event at the origin.

5.13
Minkowski diagrams and light cones
234
Figure 5.7: The absolute future and past
Imagine two photons approaching a person at the ori-
gin. In Fig. 5.7 we have included their worldlines below
the x axis. Events at the region of spacetime below the x
axis and between the photon worldlines, may inﬂuence
the origin-event. This region is the absolute past of this
event.
What happens at the origin may be inﬂuenced
by events happening in the absolute past of this point in
spacetime. The region of spacetime to the left and right
of the absolute future and absolute past is the elsewhere of
the origin-event.
Let us then include one more space dimension, say
the y direction. If the light signal moves a distance r in an
arbitrary direction with x component x and y component

5.13

y, then, from the Pythagorean theorem (see Fig. 5.8),
ct = r =
p
x2 + y2.
This is the equation of a cone in the three-dimensional
Minkowski diagram. It is called the light cone. It may
be obtained graphically by rotating the worldlines of the
photons in Fig. 5.6 about the ct axis. From what was said
above it is clear that it is not possible for any particle (of
the type that has been observed so far) to move so that its
worldline passes through the vertex of the cone and then
proceeds outside it. The worldlines are inside the light
cone (see Fig. 5.8).
5.14
The spacetime interval
In order to understand the physical interpretation of the
line element we shall proceed step by step starting with
the most simple case. We shall ﬁrst deal with two (phys-
ically idealized) events (without extension in space and
time) that are simultaneous in our reference frame. Then
dt = 0, and the line element (5.110) reduces to
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2.
As we know from the Pythagorean theorem, this is the
square of the distance between the events. In this case

5.14
The spacetime interval
237
√
ds2 is just the distance in space between the simultane-
ous events.
As our next case we shall consider two events hap-
pening, in our reference frame at the same place, but not
at the same time. Then dx = dy = dz = 0. Consequently
Eq. (5.110) is reduced to
ds2 = −c2dt2.
(5.111)
This equation looks like a contradiction, since our
symbols represent quantities for which we insert num-
bers when the equations are applied to physical phenom-
ena. According to high-school mathematics, dealing with
so-called ‘real numbers’, the square of a number can
never be negative. However, mathematicians have in-
vented a new sort of numbers, so-called imaginary num-
bers, with the property that the square of an imaginary
number is negative.
The imaginary number whose
square is equal to −1 is denoted by i. Thus
i2 = −1
or
i =
√
−1.
An arbitrary imaginary number is a real number times i.
The value of any measured quantity is a real num-
ber. In the situation with two events happening at the
same place, the quantity ds is imaginary. In this situa-
tion ds does not represent a measurable quantity. How-
ever, dt in Eq. (5.111) represents a measurable time inter-
val. Its value is a real number. This number is the time

5.14
The spacetime interval
238
difference between two events, as measured on clocks at
rest in our reference frame. Equation (5.111) shows that
−ds2 = c2 dt2. Taking the square root,
p
−ds2 = c dt,
(5.112)
which is the distance that light can travel during the time
dt. This distance is termed the spacetime interval between
the events, but is usually simply called the interval be-
tween the events.
We have now interpreted physically the quantity
√
−ds2 for the case that the events happen at the same
place, and the quantity
√
ds2 for the case that the events
happen simultaneously.
In both cases
p
|ds2| is a dis-
tance, in the ﬁrst case the distance that light can travel
in a time-interval dt, and in the second case a distance in
space. It has become customary in the theory of relativ-
ity to use the word ‘interval’ as a common name covering
both cases. This suggests the following deﬁnition: The in-
terval in spacetime between two events is
p
|ds2|, i.e. the
square root of the absolute value of the line element.
Traditionally we distinguish between three types of
intervals with the fancy names space-like, light-like, and
time-like. In the case that the line element is positive,
ds2 > 0, the interval is said to be space-like. In the case
that the line element is zero, ds2 = 0, it is called light-like.
And in the case that the line element is negative, ds2 < 0
, we call it time-like (see Fig. 5.9).

5.14
The spacetime interval
239
Figure 5.9: Three classes of spacetime intervals
Let us look at the physical meaning of this classiﬁca-
tion. Imagine two events P1 and P2 very close to each
other. The square of the spatial distance between the po-
sitions of the events is
dℓ2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2.
The line element (5.110) can now be written
ds2 = dℓ2 −c2dt2.
(5.113)
In general the line element is expressed in terms of co-
ordinates in a given reference frame, and the time inter-
val dt is assumed to be measured by clocks at rest in the
frame.
Consider ﬁrst the case that the interval between the
events is light-like.
Then, according to the deﬁnition

5.14
The spacetime interval
240
above, ds2 = 0, which in tern implies
dℓ
dt = c.
A consequence of this equation is that a signal which is
emitted at P1 and absorbed at P2 moves with the velocity
of light. For example, the spacetime interval between a
supernova explosion and our observation of it, is light-
like.
If the interval between P1 P2 is a positive number, i.e.
ds2 > 0, which implies that dℓ/dt > c, then the interval
according to our deﬁnition is space-like. In this case one
must move faster than light in order to be present both at
P1 and P2, which is impossible for ordinary matter mov-
ing slower than light.
As stated above two events are said to happen simul-
taneously if dt = 0. Then, according to Eq. (5.113), ds2 =
dℓ2 and dℓ2 > 0, showing that the interval between two si-
multaneous
events is space-like. In order to be present at these two
events we have to move inﬁnitely fast—squarely impos-
sible!
The interpretation when the line element is negative,
and the interval is time-like, is quite different. The line

element (5.110) can be written

(5.114)
where v = dℓ/dt is the velocity of a person, moving (or
staying at rest in the space dimensions if P1 and P2 hap-
pen at the same place in space) in such a way that she is
present both at P1 and P2. For a time-like interval ds2 < 0
which gives v < c. In this case it is possible to have been
present at both P1 and P2, travelling in ordinary three-
dimensional space with a velocity v less than the velocity
of light c. This case includes ordinary physical travelling.
Note that the person will necessarily move in the time di-
rection on her way through spacetime from the event P1
to P2. While it is possible to stay at rest in ordinary three-
dimensional space, it seems impossible to prevent mov-
ing in the time direction, as we incessantly travel from
event to event in spacetime.
We want a Lorentz invariant measure of time telling
‘truly’ how fast an object (or subject) gets older. From
Eq. (5.111) we see that
√
−ds2/c represents the time mea-
sured on a clock at rest in a reference frame. Remem-
ber that the line element is Lorentz invariant. From these
two points it follows that if you make a Lorentz transfor-
mation from a reference frame where a clock is at rest to
a frame where it moves, then the value of ds2 between

5.14
The spacetime interval
242
two events at which the clock is present, is the same in
both reference frames. It is the time interval between the
events as shown by the clock.
Imagine that the clock is comoving with a certain
body. In order to make clear that we talk about time as
measured on a clock carried by a given body, it is called
the proper time of the body. A proper time interval dτ is
deﬁned mathematically by
dτ ≡
p
−ds2/c
(5.115)
for time-like intervals, which shows that the proper time
interval is Lorentz invariant. It is often useful to write
Eq. (5.115) in the form
ds2 = −c2dτ2.
(5.116)
Equation (5.115) looks very similar to Eq. (5.112). They
have, however, different contents. Equation (5.115) is a
deﬁnition telling what we mean by the proper time inter-
val of a clock between two events. These events need not
happen at the same place. The proper time interval be-
tween two events is the time interval between the events
as shown by a clock moving so that it is present at both
events. Equation (5.112), on the other hand, represents
the special case that dt is the time interval between two
events happening at the same place.
Let us denote a proper time interval as measured by
a clock at rest by dτ0. From Eq. (5.114) with v = 0 and

5.14
The spacetime interval
243
Eq. (5.116) then follows
−c2dτ2
0 = −c2dt2
or
dτ0 = dt.
As was shown in Sect. 5.10 by considering a photon clock,
a moving clock goes slower. This can also be deduced
directly from Eq. (5.114) and the deﬁnition of proper time,
in the form of Eq. (5.116), i.e.
−c2dτ2 =
 v2 −c2
dt2
or
c2dτ2 =
 c2 −v2
dt2 =

1 −v2

c2dt2.
Dividing by c2 and taking the square root,
dτ =
q
1 −v2/c2 dt.
(5.117)
The strange minus-sign in the expression (5.110) for
the line element has interesting consequences, and shows
that spacetime is something very different from the usual
3-space. In Euclidean space the shortest distance between
two points is measured along the straight line between
them.
Consider two points P1 and P2 in spacetime connected
by a time-like interval. We can choose the coordinate sys-
tem so that the events happen at the same place, dℓ= 0.

The spacetime interval
244

server both present at the events P1 ad P2

5.14
The spacetime interval
245
Then the the proper time interval between them, mea-
sured on a clock at rest in the coordinate-system, is
∆τ0 = ∆t.
(5.118)
The path, I, of this clock is a straight line (see Fig. 5.10).
On the other hand, the interval between the same two
events, as measured on a clock that moves away and then
comes back again, so that it can be present at both events,
is found by summarizing (by integration) proper time in-
tervals dτ =
p
1 −v2/c2dt. This is clearly less than sum-
marizing just the dt’s, as was done in Eq. (5.118). The
worldline, II, of this clock cannot be straight. Thus the
proper time interval between P1 and P2 along any curved
path is less than the proper time interval between the
same two events measured along a straight curve,
∆τ < ∆τ0.
We have arrived at the following strange (but gener-
ally true) result: The greatest time-like interval in space-
time between two points, is the interval, ∆τ0, measured
along the straightest possible curve between them. There
is, however, no paradox here. It is all a consequence of
our deﬁnitions.
A time-like interval is in general not
equal to ‘distance’, but to proper time. The slower we
travel in space the faster we travel in time. If our world-
line between two events (two points in spacetime) is a
straight line, then the spatial distance we travel between

5.15
The general formula for the line element
246
the events is as short as it can be, and we travel as slowly
as possible in space from the ﬁrst event to the second one.
The proper time between the events, measured along this
route, is accordingly maximal. This is what is meant by
saying that a time-like interval between two points in
spacetime is maximal along the straightest possible curve
between the points. (The quantity ‘remoteness’, which
we introduced above, reminds more of distance, and is
minimal along the straightest possible curves in space-
time.)
5.15
The general formula for the line
element
Knowing the meaning of the spacetime line element we
may now proceed mathematically to the general (coordi-
nate independent) expression for the line element. This
is of vital importance because the special form (5.110)
of the line element is valid only in Cartesian systems,
and the general theory of relativity is concerned with de-
scribing the properties of curved spacetime from arbitrary
coordinate-systems.
As was proved above the form (5.110) of the line ele-
ment is invariant against a Lorentz transformation. Now
we seek a generalization of this expression that is invari-
ant against arbitrary coordinate transformations.
This

5.15
The general formula for the line element
247
will secure for example that we can calculate the proper-
time of a clock with arbitrary motion (accelerated or not)
by means of the expression (
√
−ds2/c, not only of a clock
with constant velocity. In order to ﬁnd an invariant ex-
pression for ds2 we ﬁrst note that the dot product be-
tween two vectors is an invariant quantity. So if ds2 can
be expressed as the dot product of two vectors we shall
have obtained our goal.
The general component-expression for the scalar
product of two vectors, ⃗u = uµ⃗eµ and ⃗v = vν⃗eν, is
⃗u ·⃗v = uµ⃗eµ · vν⃗eν = ⃗eµ · ⃗eνuµvν = gµνuµvν,
(5.119)
where we have used the deﬁnition (5.56) of the compo-
nents of the metric tensor. The dot product of a vector
by itself is the square of the length, or magnitude, of the
vector.
In Sect. 5.12 the line element was introduced as “the
square of an inﬁnitesimal ‘distance’ in spacetime”. Such a
‘distance’ is an interval between two events in spacetime.
Let
d⃗r = dxµ⃗eµ
be the distance vector between the events. The line ele-
ment, ds2, is given by the dot product of d⃗r by itself,
ds2 = d⃗r · d⃗r.
Using Eq. (5.119) with ⃗u = ⃗v = d⃗r we get
ds2 = gµνdxµdxν.
(5.120)

5.15
The general formula for the line element
248
This formula is the starting point for most investigations
of the consequences of the general theory of relativity. In
the rest of this book it will be studied extensively.
Let us for a moment go back and consider the four-
dimensional ﬂat space with the strange time-dimension,
the Minkowski spacetime. What is its metric? Writing
Eq. (5.120) for the case of a so-called diagonal metric, i.e.
a metric where gµν is different from zero only if µ = ν,
we get
ds2 = gxxdx2 + gyydy2 + gzzdz2 + gttdt2.
Comparing with Eq. (5.110) for the line element of Min-
kowski spacetime as described in a Cartesian coordinate
system, we ﬁnd
gxx = 1,
gyy = 1,
gzz = 1,
and
gtt = −c2. (5.121)
From the deﬁnition (5.56) of the components of the metric
tensor follows that the scalar products of the basis vectors
are
⃗ex ·⃗ex = 1,
⃗ey ·⃗ey = 1,
⃗ez ·⃗ez = 1,
and
⃗et ·⃗et = −c2.
The fact that the dot product of the time-like basis vec-
tors is negative shows the strange non-Euclidean charac-
ter of Minkowski spacetime. In fact the magnitude of ⃗et
must be an imaginary number; a number whose square is
negative. This tells us that this vector is only part of the

5.15
The general formula for the line element
249
mathematical machinery. It does not represent a physi-
cal quantity, such as for example proper time. The result
of measuring physical observables is reported in terms of
real numbers.
We should distinguish between the terms ‘Minkowski
metric’ and ‘Minkowski spacetime’. Minkowski space-
time is ﬂat four-dimensional spacetime. We need not in-
troduce any coordinate system in order to be able to talk
about the Minkowski spacetime.
However, the term
‘Minkowski metric’ refers necessarily to the basis vectors
of a coordinate system, since the ‘metric’ is deﬁned as the
scalar products of the basis vectors. We could have other
metrics than the Minkowski metric in the Minkowski
spacetime. Only the (unit) basis vectors of a Cartesian
coordinate system with spatial basis vectors orthogonal
to the time-direction gives the Minkowski metric.
One more point concerning the meaning of our sym-
bols: the coordinate differentials, dxµ, of an arbitrary co-
ordinate system do not in general correspond to distances
measured with measuring rods. Consider, for example,
the plane polar coordinate system of a two-dimensional
Euclidean plane. The coordinate differential dθ is not a
distance. It is an angular interval. The corresponding dis-
tance along a circle with radius r is dℓθ = rdθ, according
to the deﬁnition of radians (see Sect. 4.1). A displacement
along the circle is a displacement in the ⃗eθ direction, and
according to Eq. (4.44) the basis vector ⃗eθ has a magni-

5.15
The general formula for the line element
250
tude r. We may therefore write dℓθ = |⃗eθ|dθ. In general
the distance corresponding to a particular coordinate dif-
ferential dxµ is
dlµ = |⃗eµ|dxµ
(no summation).
(By convention we write ‘no summation’ when we refer
to a particular value of µ, rather that performing an Ein-
stein summation.)
From Eq. (5.54) with ⃗eν = ⃗eµ and α = 0, giving cos α =
1, and Eq. (5.56), we get for the square of the length of a
coordinate basis vector
|⃗eµ|2 = |⃗eµ · ⃗eµ| = |gµµ|
and
|⃗eµ| =
q
|gµµ|.
The distance corresponding to the coordinate differential
dxµ can therefore be written
dℓµ =
q
|gµµ|dxµ
(no summation).
Sometimes the line element contains terms with prod-
ucts of different coordinate differentials. The signiﬁcance
of such terms may be clearly understood by considering
a skew-angled coordinate system, as shown in Fig. 5.11.
The ﬁgure shows a small coordinate parallelogram with
sides
dℓ1 = |⃗e1| dx1 = √g11dx1

5.15
The general formula for the line element
251
Figure 5.11: Skew-angled coordinates
and
dℓ2 = |⃗e2| dx2 = √g22dx2,
respectively. Here ⃗e1 and ⃗e2 are the corresponding coordi-
nate basis vectors, with an angle α between them. From
the law of cosines, Eq. (4.10), follows
dℓ2 = dℓ1
2 + dℓ2
2 −2dℓ1dℓ2 cos θ.
From Fig. 5.11 is seen that θ = π −α. Using Eq. (4.19),
and the numerical values cos π = −1 and sin π = 0, we
obtain
cos θ = cos(π −α) = cos π cos(−α) −sin π sin(−α)
= −cos(−α) = −cos α.
Hence
dℓ2 = dℓ1
2 + dℓ2
2 + 2dℓ1dℓ2 cos α.

5.15
The general formula for the line element
252
Inserting the expressions for dℓ1 and dℓ2 we get
dℓ2 = g11(dx1)2 + g22(dx2)2
+ 2|⃗e1| |⃗e2| cos α dx1 dx2.
(5.122)
Using Eqs. (5.54) and (5.56) together with the symmetry
of the metric tensor, the last term can be written
2 |⃗e1| · |⃗e2| cos α dx1 dx2 = 2 (⃗e1 · ⃗e2) dx1 dx2 = 2 g12 dx1 dx2
= g12dx1 dx2 + g21dx2 dx1.
Inserting this into Eq. (5.122) leads to
dℓ2 = g11 (dx1)2 + g12 dx1 dx2 + g21 dx2 dx1 + g22(dx2)2.
Using Einstein’s summation convention this may be writ-
ten
dℓ2 = gijdxidxj,
where
i = 1, 2
and
j = 1, 2.
This is Eq. (5.120) applied to the present two-dimensional
case.
From this calculation is seen that the non-diagonal
components of the metric tensor, i.e. gij ̸= 0 for i ̸= j,
will be present in skew-angled coordinate systems. This
corresponds to terms with products between different co-
ordinate differentials in the line element. There are no
such components or terms in coordinate systems where
the basis vectors are orthogonal.

Epistemological comment
The fundamental kinematical concepts are position, di-
rection and motion. Note, by the way, that motion (kine-
sis in Greek) implies position and direction. To each of
these physical concepts, there corresponds an indepen-
dent type of mathematical entities by means of deﬁni-
tions of correspondence. If you are going to arrange a
meeting with a person (an event) you have to tell where
and when you shall meet. In order to tell where, you can
in principle specify three numbers: the longitude, the lat-
itude and the height above the sea level. (The fact that
only longitude and latitude is necessary in actual life has
only to do with practical circumstances—that we usually
arrange to meet persons on the surface of the Earth.) You
must also specify a fourth number; the point of time for
the meeting. Thus, to each event corresponds a set of
four numbers telling the position of the event in space-
time. A continuum of such sets of numbers make up a
mathematically deﬁned set of coordinates (a coordinate
system). The direction of a ‘rod’ is related to a (math-
ematical) basis vector ﬁeld. The motion of a particle is
relative to a set of particles with given motion, called a
(physical) reference frame. The mathematical relevance
of a reference frame is, maybe, more vividly grasped if
one represents the reference points by their worldlines.
Then one can deﬁne a reference frame as a continuum of

5.16
Epistemological comment
254
worldlines in spacetime.
In this way a large set of physical phenomena are re-
lated by deﬁnitions of correspondence to mathematical
entities. It is therefore natural to use the name ’mathe-
matical physics’, but one must keep in mind that physics
is not supposed to be mathematics, and mathematics not
supposed to be physics. It is worth a desperate ﬁght of
theoretical physics to keep in touch with the world of expe-
rience.
The above-mentioned types of references can be in-
troduced in a physical description independently of each
other. And there are several sorts of each type. What
type, and which sort of reference one introduces, is a mat-
ter of convenience. The choice is determined by the prop-
erties of the system as a whole that is to be described.
Everyone knows that the Earth is round, and most
people have a clear mental picture of what this means,
thinking for example of a globe. Also we think that the
universe expands. This is a consequence of the general
relativistic interpretation of Hubble’s remarkable obser-
vations in the 1920s. What could be the proper mental
picture of that? Psychologically it is possible, and even
natural, to think of the expansion of the universe as an
expansion of the galaxies through space to more remote
regions. However this conception cannot be consistently
carried through in the context of relativistic cosmology
(see Ch. 14). According to the relativistic models of the

5.16
Epistemological comment
255
universe it is space itself that expands. But what is meant
by ‘space itself’ here? We have to be careful not to stick
narrowly to terms as used in our daily life. It is a more
abstract meaning we have to depend upon in our text.
In physics the meaning of a word, such as ‘space’, is
theory dependent. Its most important meaning is found
by making clear what function the word has in what is
considered the best physical theory available. We do not
want to describe, here, the mathematician’s abstract
space, but the physical spacetime that Einstein’s theory
pretends that we live in.
Live in spacetime? A brief discussion of such use of
words is in order. Note ﬁrst that the Newtonian universe
is free of certain paradoxical features deducable from Ein-
stein’s theory. One example: when we sit quietly and
read this page, we move with the velocity of light in the
time direction (see Sect. 10.8). The crucial, very special
invariance of the speed of light makes some of us feel it is
natural to stress the function of the general theory of rel-
ativity as an abstract model. The physical world is some-
thing very different from the concepts of the models, even
if there is some sort of correspondence between the two.
A theoretical model does not describe qualitatively what
it models, and we do not live in models. The two authors
of this book do enjoy slightly disagreeing about the ‘real-
ism’ of certain concepts used in General Relativity.
Space is a concept used in models of something physi-

5.17
Kant or Einstein
256
cal.
So we have to establish correspondences, co-
relations, or parallels between physical relations and
mathematical relations.
It is a decisive character of the abstract mathemati-
cal ‘models’ and ‘formalism’ that they somehow are con-
nected with observations. But the lifeline between theory
and observation is thin and debateable.
5.17
Kant or Einstein: are space and
time human inventions?
Hundreds of articles and many books written by philoso-
phers and physicists have been devoted to questions of
how, why and with what right Einstein seems somehow
to bring time and space together, invading their funda-
mental difference.
What Immanuel Kant wrote in his Kritik der reinen Ver-
nuft in 1781 about space and time as, completely different,
fundamentally different Anschauungsformen, has been
looked upon as presenting one of the peaks of ingenu-
ity in Western philosophy. Views heavily inspired and in
important ways similar to that of Kant—Kantian views,
Kantianism, have been, and are, and will presumably and
unavoidably be compared to what general relativity has
to say.
One of the smallest problems is linguistic: For the Ger-

5.17
Kant or Einstein
257
man term Anschauung there is no single English term
available. It is bound up with German culture. But one
can adequately render what is meant through explana-
tions.
What are space and time—are they real beings, asks
Kant. If real, in what sense are they real? Perhaps the
terms express real relations between things, relations
which are there independent of our ways of perceiving
them? Or are they only basic forms, ways, through which
we preceive things and events: human Anschauungs-
formen. Are they forms which reﬂect the nature of our
minds, that is, something subjective without which it
would be perfectly impossible to experience anything in
here and out there. Kant looks into his own mind, and
out of the window, and votes for the latter. We always per-
ceive things in space, and we always conceive our selves
in time. We do not learn through experience the existence
of space and time. We need not generalize what we learn.
Out of inner necessity we perceive in certain ways.
As a consequence any sentence expressing a property
of space that must be there in order to be a space, is a valid
or true sentence, and its certainty is apodictic. It is incon-
ceivable that it could be otherwise. If it follows from the
very concept of space, the insight need not, and cannot,
be conﬁrmed by experience: Experience can never sup-
ply us with absolute certainty. Because of the ways of
perceiving, we can ﬁnd apodictic truths in geometry as

5.17
Kant or Einstein
258
long as it deals with space.
In the same way, our inner life is such that we cannot
avoid perceiving in terms of before and after, and there
is an irreversibility: it makes no sense to reverse the order,
time has an arrow. But the difference between the outer
perception and the inner perception is such that space and
time do not mix in any way.
As may easily be understood there seems to be a po-
larity between Kantian and Einsteinian way of thought.
And it is tempting to draw the conclusion that a Kantian
way of thinking is obsolete. Does it not absolutize Eu-
clid? Or prohibit a spacetime? It is a thinking that was
well adapted to that of Newton, not of Einstein.
This
is the conclusion of Hans Reichenbach, an outstanding
researcher both in physics and philosophy.
He is one
of the contributors to the great work edited by Arthur
Schilpp, Albert Einstein: Philosopher–Scientists, published
in 1949. In all 25 philosophers and scientists discuss Ein-
stein’s theories in this volume. Kant is mentioned in more
than 30 pages and by authors representing different
philosophical currents.
The “relativity” of simultaneity elicited strong nega-
tive, in part angry, reactions among both philosophers
and laymen. But what Einstein says is that physical mea-
surements and theoretical requirements, that is the re-
sults of the Michelson–Morley experiment combined
with the requirement of the validity of the relativity prin-

5.17
Kant or Einstein
259
ciple for electromagnetic as well as mechanical phenom-
ena, forces upon us a deﬁnition of simultaneity with a
relational character. But a philosopher and a layman are
completely free to stick to a ‘intuitive’ notion. There is
nothing wrong with that from a scientiﬁc point of view as
long as its supporters accept a physical concept indispen-
sible to the science of physics. Generalizing from imme-
diate perception we may at this very movement imagine
events at other planets—extremely far away—happening
at the very same moment. The notion—let me not call it
concept—we have is in a certain sense untouched by Ein-
stein’s relationism. It is only when we bring in a require-
ment of an encompassing theoretical structure modelling
physical reality, that the formidable relatedness to veloc-
ity occurs. Kant believed Newton had said the last word:
there is an ‘absolute’ space and time independent of us,
but a Kantian may say: not absolutely. A deep change of
the human mind may result in different Anschauungsfor-
men. A post-human being may not have an inner sense
such that it necessarily perceive things in a series, involv-
ing before, after and at-the-same-time. With a modiﬁed
mind there may also be no necessity of an outer sense
which perceives these things spatially. But—here Kant
may be completely wrong—not much can be derived if ab-
soluteness is accepted. Kant believed very much could be
derived from his hypothesis about absoluteness of time.
Similarly as regards spatial relations. We do not need

5.17
Kant or Einstein
260
the arrogance to think at our more or less spontaneous
experience of spatial relations, such as the one expressed
by ‘A is between B and C’ furnishes us with a concept
guaranteeing testability which is required by the science
of physics. We may agree with Kant that the present hu-
man mind is constituted in such a way that what is not
perceived to be in ourselves necessarily is perceived to
be outside—in space, or better in a spatial arrangement.
Of course, we would have to explain what we mean by
the “inner” and “outer” sense, and what we mean by the
supposedly very different outer and inner world, but that
goes beyond our discussion of relations to Einstein.
When it is said that the relational character of s imul-
taneity goes straight, not only against Kant, but against
common sense, it may be objected that “common sense”
scarcely has thought about what might happen when
bodies move with enormous speed in relation to each
other, and we try to ﬁnd out what is happening simul-
taneously. To say “what reason did I have to think that
something strange would be observed in such cases?”
The depth or deﬁniteness of intention is always limited
and largely determined by requirements of action, not re-
ﬂection.
But how did the many very competent philosophers
and physicists conclude about ‘Kant versus Einstein’? So
far, I have only mentioned Hans Reichenbach’s thorough-
ly negative conclusions. The philosopher F. S. C. Nor-

5.17
Kant or Einstein
261
throp is fairly negative but very speciﬁc: “[...] in the
epistemology of Albert Einstein, the structure of space-
time is the structure of the scientiﬁc object of knowledge”;
its real basis is not “solely in the character of the scien-
tist as knower.” This “follows from the tensor equation
of gravitation[. . . ] Thus spacetime has all the contingent
character that the ﬁeld strengthens, determined by the
contingent distribution of matter throughout nature, pos-
sess.”
Einstein is aware of many “pure deductions” used to
arrive at his equation.
He even declares that Henri
Poincaré is right: one may suppose that there are at t1
“any number of possible systems of theoretical physics
all with an equal amount to be said for them; and this
opinion [of Poincaré] is no doubt correct, theoretically.
But evolution has shown that at any given moment, out
of all conceivable constructions, a single one has always
proved itself absolute superior to all the rest.”[4, p 22] The
important point for us when discussing Kant is that noth-
ing seems to be a priori and certain in physics. Einstein
seems, however, to have an uncritical belief that all possi-
bilities can be compared, and one found to be superior—
physically, mathematically, or in Einstein’s special termi-
nology, simpler (!).
After all this criticism of Kantian conceptions, let us
look at more positive evaluations. There are many but
highly overlapping: Theories are constructions, free cre-

5.17
Kant or Einstein
262
ations of the intellect, in Einstein’s own terminology. In
this they are of course part of the human mind. They
are made prior to certain experiences in the sense of ob-
servations, and even prior to generalizations from obser-
vations. But they have no certainty, and cannot possi-
bly have “apodictic certainty”. And they should, accord-
ing to Einstein, at least at some points, be experimentally
testable. Never veriﬁable, never falsiﬁable in any strict
sense.
Ernst Cassirer is one of the great names in the philos-
ophy of this century. He has developed a Kantian sort
of philosophy, a “critical theory” which he thinks is com-
pletely compatible with Kant’s[1]. The fundamental traits
of this theory is completely compatible with general rel-
ativity. They are not dependent upon the invariances as-
sumed by Euclid’s formalism. The Kantian views about
geometry must be modiﬁed taking into account the ap-
pearance of non-Euclidian kinds. A book by the Dutch
philosopher Alfred Elsbach ends essentially with the
same positive conclusions. General relativity does not
imply that time and space are similar in some ways. Cen-
timetres and seconds are related in some formulas, but
through the multiplication by the imaginary number
√
−1. If it is reported from another planet that an athlete
there has jumped 9 metres multiplied by
√
−1, we can-
not accept it, not even understand what was going on on
the planet. Elsbach says that in the equation of general

5.17
Kant or Einstein
263
relativity a centimetre plays “the same role” as
√
−1/c
seconds—and why not? It does not affect the updated
theory of the two Anschauungsformen. Between 1/c and
√
−1/c there is a fundamental difference.
After Bergson’s brilliant analysis of the abyss between
the intuitively given dureé and the measureable temps,
any theory that seems to deﬂate the difference, or any
theory which seems to equate time intervals with spatial
distances, must expect strong, ﬁrmly based protests. The
“t” in Newtonian physics is measureable and the same
of course, holds in general relativity. But the latter does
not in any way support a concept of time that reduces
the difference between time and space as we experience
it in our daily life. The loss of absolute simultaneity is
due to a new kind of relation between certain measure-
mentss of distance of time and measurements of velocity
of motion. It does not in any way bring what we feel to
be a time interval nearer to what we perceive as a dif-
ference in velocity. The “common sense” is not negated
or undermined in this matter. There is still room for Kan-
tian and other philosophies which assume a “categorical”
difference between velocity intervals and time intervals.
But if intersubjective, intercultural testability is required,
questions are relevant which are completely new and un-
related to those pertinent to our common practical prob-
lems. The conclusion is simple: We are all predisposed
to understand in terms of spatial and time relations. (But

5.17
Kant or Einstein
264
of course not only in terms of space and time, we, for in-
stance, are predisposed to ask for causes of events.) It is
difﬁcult to imagine a decisive change in this, for example,
that concepts of information could take over. Kant under-
mines conceptions of science and of physics which under-
estimate the inﬂuence of the working of the mind—and
of society and culture—upon what we accept as scientiﬁc
knowledge. Einstein contributes heavily to our apprecia-
tion of the role of intuition, imagination and also logical
deductions—not only in physics, but in science in gen-
eral. We learn from experience mainly because of the role
of what we have not learned from experience.

Chapter 6
The Christoffel symbols
Choreography is the art of composing dances and the
recording of movements on paper by means of conve-
nient signs and symbols. Consider for a moment a most
disturbing and uncanny experience suffered by a well es-
tablished choreographer. He was supposed to record on
paper the movements of certain fairly simple dances, but
in a faraway, strange place.
He found himself in a big beautiful room where he
could easily observe the movements of the dancers. But
what horror! He felt to his abysmal dismay that the ﬂoor
itself, and the walls, even the ceiling were changing shape
all the time, like reﬂections on the surface of waves. Also
elongations and contractions occurred in an utterly con-
fusing, erratic way. To his consternation, looking at him-
self he saw that he himself and his paper took part in all
this. How could he possibly describe the dance when de-
265

The Christoffel symbols
266
prived of a Cartesian coordinate system? Deprived of
a familiar straight unmoving ﬂat ﬂoor, stable walls and
ceiling! To his surprise he managed, listening to an Ital-
ian named Elwin B. Christoffel (1827–1900) and to others
who dropped down from the ceiling at the right moment.
In what follows we are not ambitious enough to de-
scribe a dance of a particle, or some other thing of point-
like simplicity, inside weird rooms. We are postponing
that. We shall limit ourselves to ﬁnd a way that will be
used to describe the dance of the ﬂoor in such a room.
Our efforts include the introduction of the famous
Christoffel symbols Γ νµα, symbols that Einstein initially
had found difﬁcult to understand, but soon mastered
magniﬁcently; he simply had to.
We shall now start on a level surpassed long ago, the
chapter 2 level.
The curvature of a curve y = f(x) is
described by the second derivative y′′ = d2f/dx2. The
ﬁrst derivative y′ = df/dx furnishes information of the
steepness of a curve at a given point. Fortunately, we
shall lose nothing on our way to the Christoffel symbol
by considering only the ﬁrst derivatives. But instead of
talking directly about curves, we talk about basis vectors
and their changes. When these are thought of as being
placed tightly together along a curve, their initial points
trace that curve.
Enough introductory talk! We start in earnest.

In Fig. 6.1 a plane polar coordinate system (see ﬁg.4.7)
is illustrated with particular vectors of the basis vector
ﬁelds ⃗er and ⃗eθ drawn at four different points P, Q, R,
and S. The ⃗er vector ﬁeld ﬁlls the total two-dimensional

268
plane pointing outwards from the origin O in every di-
rection. The magnitude is constant. In Fig. 6.1 we have
only drawn four radial basis vectors, those with roots at
the points P, Q, R, and S. Similarly, the ⃗eθ vector ﬁeld ﬁlls
the two-dimensional plane, each being a tangential vec-
tor to every circle with centre at O. Their directions are
perpendicular to the radial basis vectors, pointing in the
direction of increasing angle θ. The magnitudes of these
vectors are proportional to their distance from the origin.
We shall be concerned with changes of the vectors of
the basis vector ﬁelds with position. In order to prepare
for a general formula representing such changes, we shall
ﬁrst consider a particular case: the change of the vector ⃗eθ
by a small displacement in the θ direction.
In Fig. 6.2 we have drawn two vectors (⃗eθ)P and (⃗eθ)S
of the basis vector ﬁeld ⃗eθ at the points P and S, respec-
tively. The points P and S are separated by a ﬁnite angle
∆θ. The vector (⃗eθ)∥P is the vector (⃗eθ)P parallel trans-
ported from P to S.
The vector ∆θ ⃗eθ is the change of the vector ﬁeld ⃗eθ
from P to S, that is, a change by a displacement in the ⃗eθ
direction. A ‘change’ is generally deﬁned to mean ‘ﬁnal
value minus initial value’. Finite changes are denoted by
∆and indeﬁnitely small ones by d.
We shall now examine the vector triangle deﬁned by
the vectors (⃗eθ)∥P, (⃗eθ)S, and ∆θ ⃗eθ.
This is shown in
greater detail in Fig. 6.3.

6.1
Geometrical calculation
271
From Fig. 6.3 and the deﬁnition of an angle as mea-
sured in radians we see that
L = |⃗eθ|∆θ.
(6.1)
Since |⃗eθ| has magnitude r (see Eq. (4.44)),
L = r∆θ.
The difference between L and |∆θ ⃗eθ| approaches zero as
∆θ →0, so we obtain
|dθ ⃗eθ| = rdθ.
(6.2)
From Fig. 6.2 we see that dθ ⃗eθ points in the opposite di-
rection of ⃗er. Equation (6.2) then gives
dθ ⃗eθ = −r dθ⃗e^r
where ⃗e^r (pronounced ‘e vector r hat’) is a radial unit vec-
tor. Since the coordinate basis vector ⃗er is itself a unit
vector ﬁeld, we may drop the ‘hat’ in ⃗e^r, and write
dθ ⃗eθ = −r dθ⃗er.
(6.3)
We shall now consider differentiation of vectors.
Sometimes the vectors ⃗e of a vector ﬁeld are functions
of only one coordinate, say x. Then the derivative of the
vector ﬁeld ⃗e is deﬁned by
d⃗e
dx ≡lim
∆x→0
⃗e(x + ∆x) −⃗e(x)
∆x
.

6.1
Geometrical calculation
272
It may also happen that the vectors are functions of sev-
eral coordinates, say ⃗e(x, y). The partial derivative of the
vector function with respect to a coordinate x is deﬁned
by (compare with Eq. (2.52) for the partial derivative of a
scalar function).
∂⃗e
∂x = lim
∆x→0
⃗e(x + ∆x, y) −⃗e(x, y)
∆x
= lim
∆x→0
∆x ⃗e
∆x = dx⃗e
dx .
Applying this deﬁnition to the case considered in Fig. 6.3
we obtain
dθ⃗eθ
dθ = ∂⃗eθ
∂θ =
∂⃗eθ
∂θ
r
⃗er +
∂⃗eθ
∂θ
θ
⃗eθ.
(6.4)
The vector (⃗eθ)S is connected to the vector (⃗eθ)P by means
of the ‘difference vector’ or ‘connection vector’ dθ⃗eθ =
(⃗eθ)S −(⃗eθ)P. Therefore the components of this vector per
unit coordinate distance are called connection coefﬁcients,
and are in the present case denoted by Γ rθθ and Γ θθθ, i.e.
dθ⃗eθ
dθ = Γ r
θθ ⃗er + Γ θ
θθ ⃗eθ.
(6.5)
If the basis vectors represent coordinate basis vector
ﬁelds, which will be the case in the whole of our text,
the connection coefﬁcients are called Christoffel symbols.
From Eqs. (6.4) and (6.5) follow
Γ r
θθ =
∂⃗eθ
∂θ
r
and
Γ θ
θθ =
∂⃗eθ
∂θ
θ
.

6.1
Geometrical calculation
273
Using Eq. (6.3) we ﬁnd
Γ r
θθ = −r
and
Γ θ
θθ = 0.
We have thus calculated our ﬁrst Christoffel symbols.
And they have been calculated in an elementary and
purely geometrical way.
It is natural, now, to deﬁne an arbitrary Christoffel
symbol in the following way: The Christoffel symbol Γ νµα
is the ν component of the change of the coordinate basis
vector ⃗eµ by an inﬁnitesimal coordinate displacement dxα
per unit coordinate distance. Hence
Γ ν
µα ≡
∂⃗eµ
∂xα
ν
.
In order to see more clearly the geometrical signiﬁ-
cance of the Christoffel symbols, we shall proceed to cal-
culate the remaining Christoffel symbols of the polar co-
ordinate system in similar geometrical ways as above.
We now consider the change of the basis vector ﬁeld
⃗eθ due to a radial displacement.
This is illustrated in
Fig. 6.4. The vector ∆r⃗eθ is the change of the vector ﬁeld
⃗eθ from P to Q. From the triangles A and B is seen that
|∆r⃗eθ|
∆r
= |⃗eθ|
r .
Hence
|∆r⃗eθ| = |⃗eθ|(1/r)∆r.

6.1
Geometrical calculation
274
Figure 6.4: The change in ⃗eθ due to a radial displacement

6.1
Geometrical calculation
275
In the limit that ∆r →0 we get
|dr⃗eθ| = |⃗eθ|(1/r)dr.
Since dr⃗eθ is directed along ⃗eθ this leads to
dr⃗eθ = (1/r) dr⃗eθ
and therefore
Γ θ
θr =
∂⃗eθ
∂r
θ
= 1
r
and
Γ r
θr =
∂⃗eθ
∂r
r
= 0.
Next we consider the basis vector ﬁeld ⃗er.
From
Fig. 6.1 is seen that this vector ﬁeld does not change by
radial displacements. Thus
dr⃗er = 0.
If a vector is zero, then each of its components must be
zero. This implies that
Γ r
rr = Γ θ
rr = 0.
We shall now calculate the change of the vector ﬁeld
⃗er by an angular displacement dθ. Then we need to con-
sider Figs. 6.5 and 6.6. Let us examine the vector triangle
deﬁned by the vectors (⃗er)∥P, (⃗er)S, and ∆θ⃗er. The trian-
gle is shown in greater detail in Fig. 6.6. The arc-length
between point A and B in Fig. 6.6 has been denoted by L.

by the vectors (⃗er)∥P, (⃗er)S, and ∆θ⃗er in Fig. 6.5

6.1
Geometrical calculation
278
The drawn radius of the circle about S is |⃗er|. Again (see
Eq. (6.1)), from the deﬁnition of an angle as measured in
radians, we get
L = |⃗er|∆θ.
(6.6)
Since ⃗er has constant magnitude equal to one, see
Eq. (4.41), Eq. (6.6) is simpliﬁed to
L = ∆θ.
If ∆θ →0, the difference between L and |∆θ⃗er| approaches
zero. Thus we obtain
|dθ⃗er| = dθ.
(6.7)
From Fig. 6.5 is seen that dθ⃗er has the same direction
as ⃗eθ. By means of Eq. (6.7) we get
dθ⃗er = dθ⃗e^θ,
where ⃗e^θ = (1/r)⃗eθ is the unit vector introduced in
Eq. (4.45). Hence
dθ⃗er = (1/r) dθ⃗eθ.
(6.8)
This equation gives the change of the basis vector ⃗er by an
inﬁnitesimal displacement (of the point of observation)
in the ⃗eθ -direction. As seen from Fig. 6.5 and as stated
in Eq. (6.8) this change of ⃗er has only a θ component.

6.1
Geometrical calculation
279
From this we obtain the two last Christoffel symbols of
the plane polar coordinate system
Γ θ
rθ =
∂⃗er
∂θ
θ
= 1
r
and
Γ r
rθ =
∂⃗er
∂θ
r
= 0.
This completes our geometrical calculation of the
Christoffel symbols of the coordinate system with plane
polar coordinates.
We have seen in detail how the
Christoffel symbols describe the change of basis vector
ﬁeld with position. This is the essential signiﬁcance of
the Christoffel symbols. We would like to emphasize that
they describe coordinate systems (or more generally basis
vector ﬁelds) and not space itself. In particular we note
that the Christoffel symbols themselves do not give any
information about the curvature of space, although they
give full information about the geometrical properties of
the coordinate system that we have chosen as reference
of our description of that space.
The above shows that the geometrical meaning of the
Christoffel symbols can be understood more or less in-
tuitively. As a young man (before 1912) Einstein would
probably
disapprove
of
the
complicated-looking
Christoffel symbols with three indices, because he then
had the suspicion, according to his friend Philipp Frank,
that the sophisticated ‘higher’ mathematics used by some
physicists was not intended to clarify, but rather to dumb-
found the reader. He radically but reluctantly changed

6.2
Algebraic calculation
280
his opinion.
The many zeros are due to our choice of coordinate
system: only one of the coordinate-curves are curved. If
both were curved we would in the general case have no
zeros. If the two curved coordinates are called x1 and x2
we get eight Christoffel symbols
Γ 1
11,
Γ 1
12,
Γ 2
11,
Γ 2
12,
Γ 1
21,
Γ 1
22,
Γ 2
21,
and
Γ 2
22.
In the case of n dimensions the three indices can all have
the values 1, 2, . . ., n. Thus, in an n-dimensional coordi-
nate system there will be n3 Christoffel symbols with dif-
ferent indices. In Sect. 6.4 we shall see that some of them
are always equal, so the number of different Christoffel
symbols is not as great as this, due to a symmetry that
the Christoffel symbols fulﬁl. In the case of two, three,
and four dimensions there are 8, 27 and 64 Christoffel
symbols, respectively, with different sets of indices.
6.2
Algebraic calculation of Christof-
fel symbols
We shall now show how the Christoffel symbols can most
efﬁciently be calculated by means of differentiation, in-
stead of by geometric considerations.

6.2
Algebraic calculation
281
Consider the basis vector ﬁeld ⃗er = ⃗er(r, θ) and ⃗eθ =
⃗eθ(r, θ). According to Eq. (6.4) the change of ⃗eθ due to a
displacement dθ is
dθ ⃗eθ =
∂⃗eθ
∂θ
r
dθ⃗er +
∂⃗eθ
∂θ
θ
dθ⃗eθ,
and from Eq. (6.5) this can be written
dθ ⃗eθ = Γ r
θθ dθ⃗er + Γ θ
θθ dθ⃗eθ.
(6.9)
Similarly the change of ⃗eθ under a displacement in the r
direction, has the form
dr ⃗eθ = Γ r
θr dr⃗er + Γ θ
θr dr⃗eθ.
(6.10)
The total change of ⃗eθ due to a displacement in an arbi-
trary direction, i.e. with both a component dr and dθ is
d⃗eθ = dr ⃗eθ + dθ ⃗eθ.
Inserting the right-hand sides of Eqs. (6.9) and (6.10)
leads to
d⃗eθ = Γ r
θr dr⃗er+Γ θ
θrdr⃗eθ+Γ r
θθ dθ⃗er+Γ θ
θθ dθ⃗eθ. (6.11)
In the same way the total change of ⃗er is
d⃗er = Γ r
rr dr⃗er +Γ θ
rr dr⃗eθ +Γ r
rθ dθ⃗er +Γ θ
rθ dθ⃗eθ. (6.12)

6.2
Algebraic calculation
282
In the present case Einstein’s summation convention re-
sults in a considerable simpliﬁcation.
Equations (6.11)
and (6.12) can be written in the remarkably elegant form
d⃗eµ = Γ ν
µα dxα ⃗eν,
(6.13)
where µ, ν, and α can all take the ‘values’ r and θ.
The algebraic method works according to the follow-
ing procedure. First the basis vectors are decomposed in
a (locally) Cartesian coordinate system with constant ba-
sis vectors. Then one performs the differentiation, and
the resulting expressions are decomposed in the original
coordinate system.
Finally the Christoffel symbols are
identiﬁed as the coefﬁcients in front of dxα⃗eν.
This method will now be applied to the basis vectors
⃗er and ⃗eθ as given in Eqs. (4.40) and (4.43),
⃗er = cos θ⃗ex+sin θ⃗ey
and
⃗eθ = −r sin θ⃗ex+r cos θ⃗ey.
The total differentials of these vectors are calculated from
d⃗er =
∂⃗er
∂r
x
dr⃗ex +
∂⃗er
∂r
y
dr⃗ey
+
∂⃗er

dθ⃗ex +
∂⃗er

dθ⃗ey.
(6.14)

and
d⃗eθ =
∂⃗eθ
∂r
x
dr⃗ex +
∂⃗eθ
∂r
y
dr⃗ey
+
∂⃗eθ
∂θ
x
dθ⃗ex +
∂⃗eθ
∂θ
y
dθ⃗ey.
Performing the differentiations,
d⃗er = 0 dr + (−sin θ⃗ex + cos θ⃗ey) dθ
(6.15)
d⃗eθ = (−sin θ⃗ex + cos θ⃗ey) dr
−r (cos θ⃗ex + sin θ⃗ey) dθ.
(6.16)
In order to compare with Eqs. (6.11) and (6.12) we must
decompose the vectors d⃗er and d⃗eθ in the polar coordi-
nate system. In Eq. (6.15) and in the ﬁrst term of Eq. (6.16)
we recognize by means of Eq. (6.14), that −sin θ⃗ex +
cos θ⃗ey = (1/r)⃗eθ, and in the second term of Eq. (6.16)
that cos θ⃗ex + sin θ⃗ey = ⃗er. We see from this
d⃗er = (1/r) dθ⃗eθ,
d⃗eθ = (1/r) dr⃗eθ + (−r) dθ⃗er.
(6.17)
Comparing with Eqs. (6.11) and (6.12) we ﬁnd the follow-
ing non-vanishing Christoffel symbols
Γ θ
r θ = 1
r,
Γ θ
θr = 1
r,
and
Γ r
θθ = −r.
(6.18)
This is in accordance with the geometrical calculations
above.

6.2
Algebraic calculation

The generalization of these results to the simplest 3-
dimensional curvilinear coordinate system, called cylin-
drical coordinates, is rather trivial. This coordinate sys-
tem will therefore only be brieﬂy mentioned, and we will
then go on to calculate the Christoffel symbols in spher-
ical coordinates, which is of great importance in several
applications of the general theory of relativity.
Figure 6.7: The basis vectors of cylindrical coordinates
The extension of plane polar coordinates to cylindrical
coordinates is made by introducing a third coordinate z

with straight coordinate axis normal to the plane of the
polar coordinates. The basis vector ﬁeld ⃗ez is a constant
vector ﬁeld. All the vectors ⃗ez of this ﬁeld are unit vectors
and have the same direction. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.7.
None of the basis vectors are changed by a displace-
ment in the z direction. The changes of the basis vectors
⃗er and ⃗eθ have no components along ⃗ez. And the vec-
tor ⃗ez does not change by any displacement in the (r, θ)
plane. These properties of the basis vectors imply that all
the Christoffel symbols with at least one z index are zero.
Thus the extension of the plane polar coordinate system
to a three-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system in-
troduces no new Christoffel symbols.
6.3
Spherical coordinates
Figure 6.8 invites the reader to imagine a sphere. What
is supposed to be seen is marked with full lines. Lines in
the interior of the sphere are dotted except some angles.
At an arbitrary point P we have drawn three basis vec-
tors; ⃗er along the radial direction from the centre of the
sphere and outwards, ⃗eϕ is pointing in a direction corre-
sponding to the variation of longitude on the surface of
the Earth, and ⃗eθ in a direction corresponding to the vari-
ation of latitude. The hatched two small right-angled tri-
angles converging on the centre of the sphere have sides
marked x, y, z, and r and angles ϕ and θ. Note that the

6.3
Spherical coordinates
286
Figure 6.8: Spherical coordinates

6.3
Spherical coordinates
287
spherical coordinates used in mathematical physics are
different from those used on a globus. On the Earth the
poles are at 90 degree latitude. The coordinate θ, how-
ever, is so that the poles are at θ = 0, and the Equator at
θ = 90 degrees.
Using Eq. (4.1a) for sinus and cosinus, and inspecting
the mentioned triangles we see that
cos ϕ =
x
r sin θ,
sin ϕ =
y
r sin θ,
and
cos θ = z
r.
Thus, the coordinate transformation between the spherial
coordinates r, θ, and ϕ and the Cartesian coordinates x,
y, and z is
x = r sin θ cos ϕ,
y = r sin θ sin ϕ,
and
z = r cos θ.
(6.19)
We now use the transformation formula (5.37) and
ﬁnd that the basis vectors of the spherical coordinate sys-
tem are given by
⃗er = ∂x
∂r ⃗ex + ∂y
∂r ⃗ey + ∂z
∂r ⃗ez
(6.20a)
⃗eθ = ∂x
∂θ ⃗ex + ∂y
∂θ ⃗ey + ∂z
∂θ ⃗ez
(6.20b)
⃗eϕ = ∂x
∂ϕ ⃗ex + ∂y
∂ϕ ⃗ey + ∂z
∂ϕ ⃗ez
(6.20c)

6.3
Spherical coordinates
288
In short, using the Einstein summation convention
⃗eµ = ∂xm
∂xµ ⃗em
where

xm ∈{x, y, z},
xµ ∈{r, θ, ϕ}.
(6.21)
From Eqs. (6.20) it is clear that the spherical coordinate
system is more complex than the Cartesian, the plane po-
lar, and the cylindrical systems. However, systems with
spherical symmetry are the most important ones for us,
since we seem to live on a spherical Earth in an isotropic
universe.
So it is worth the effort to work out the
Christoffel symbols in this coordinate system.
We start by calculating the basis vectors ⃗er, ⃗eθ, and
⃗eϕ from Eq. (6.20), using the expressions for x, y, and z
in Eq. (6.19). Performing the partial differentiations and
substituting the results into Eqs. (6.20) we get
⃗er = sin θ cos ϕ⃗ex + sin θ sin ϕ⃗ey + cos θ⃗ez
(6.22a)
⃗eθ = r (cos θ cos ϕ⃗ex + cos θ sin ϕ⃗ey −sin θ⃗ez) (6.22b)
⃗eϕ = r (−sin θ sin ϕ⃗ex + sin θ cos ϕ⃗ey)
(6.22c)
Differentiating once more, using the product rule (2.24),
leads to
d⃗er = (cos θ cos ϕ⃗ex + cos θ sin ϕ⃗ey −sin θ⃗ez) dθ
+ (−sin θ sin ϕ⃗ex + sin θ cos ϕ⃗ey) dϕ (6.23a)

6.3
Spherical coordinates
289
d⃗eθ = (cos θ cos ϕ⃗ex + cos θ sin ϕ⃗ey −sin θ⃗ez) dr
+ (−r sin θ cos ϕ⃗ex −r sin θ sin ϕ⃗ey −r cos θ⃗ez) dθ
+ (−r cos θ sin ϕ⃗ex + r cos θ cos ϕ⃗ey) dϕ (6.23b)
d⃗eϕ = (−sin θ sin ϕ⃗ex + sin θ cos φ⃗ey) dr
+ (−r cos θ sin ϕ⃗ex + r cos θ cos ϕ⃗ey) dθ
−(r sin θ cos ϕ⃗ex + r sin θ sin ϕ⃗ey) dϕ (6.23c)
In order to calculate the Christoffel symbols from
Eq. (6.13) we must express the right-hand side of
Eqs. (6.23) as linear combinations of the vectors ⃗er, ⃗eθ, and
⃗eϕ, not of ⃗ex, ⃗ey, and˘a⃗ez. Comparing the terms inside the
parenthesis in the expression for d⃗er with the vector ⃗eθ as
given in Eq. (6.22), we see that these terms are equal to
(1/r)⃗eθ. Similarly, the terms in the expression for d⃗er in
front of dϕ is equal to (1/r)⃗eϕ. Thus
d⃗er = (1/r) dθ⃗eθ + (1/r) dϕ⃗eϕ.
(6.24)
Comparing now the three terms in front of dr, dθ, and
dϕ in the expression for d⃗eθ with the vectors ⃗er, ⃗eθ, ⃗eϕ in
Eq. (6.22) leads to
d⃗eθ = (1/r) dr⃗eθ + (−r) dθ⃗er + cos θ
sin θdϕ⃗eϕ.
(6.25)
This procedure also works for the two ﬁrst lines in the ex-
pression for d⃗eϕ. They are, respectively, (1/r) dr⃗eϕ and

6.3
Spherical coordinates
290
cos θ
sin θ dθ⃗eϕ. But the term −r sin θ (cos ϕ⃗ex + sin ϕ⃗ey) in
front of dϕ in the expression for d⃗eϕ is not simply pro-
portional to one of the vectors ⃗er, ⃗eθ, or ⃗eϕ.
Figure 6.9: The shaded plane in Fig. 6.8 seen from above
We shall now ﬁnd an expression for cos ϕ⃗ex +sin ϕ⃗ey
in terms of ⃗er and ⃗eθ, by simple geometrical reasoning.
Consider the shaded plane in Fig. 6.8. Imagine that you
look down on this plane from a position far up at the z
axis. Then the plane will look like a line to you, as shown
in Fig. 6.9.
Let ⃗eH be a horizontal unit vector in the shaded plane.
From Fig. 6.9 and the usual formula for vector addition
follows
⃗eH = |⃗eH| cos ϕ⃗ex + |⃗eH| sin ϕ⃗ey = cos ϕ⃗ex + sin ϕ⃗ey.
Imagine now that you are positioned in front of the
shaded plane and are looking horizontally towards the

izontal position
plane. In Fig. 6.10 we have drawn the plane as seen from
this position together with appropriate unit vectors ⃗e^r, ⃗e^θ
and the horizontal vector ⃗eH.
From Fig. 6.10 is seen that
⃗eH = |⃗eH| sin θ⃗e^r + |⃗eH| cos θ⃗e^θ = sin θ⃗e^r + cos θ⃗e^θ.
Calculating the magnitudes of ⃗er and ⃗eθ from
|⃗er| = (⃗er · ⃗er)1/2
and
|⃗eθ| = (⃗eθ · ⃗eθ)1/2
by means of Eq. (6.22), we ﬁnd
|⃗er| = 1
and
|⃗eθ| = r.
Thus the corresponding unit vectors are
⃗e^r = ⃗er
and
⃗e^θ = (1/r)⃗eθ.

Inserting this in the expression for ⃗eH we have
⃗eH = sin θ⃗er + (1/r) cos θ⃗eθ.
Equalizing our two expressions for ⃗eH gives
cos ϕ⃗ex + sin ϕ⃗ey = sin θ⃗er + (1/r) cos θ⃗eθ.
Inserting this for the expression inside the parenthesis in
the last term of d⃗eϕ in Eq. (6.23), we obtain

According to Eq. (6.13) the expressions for d⃗er, d⃗eθ, and

exist in 3-dimensional coordinate systems, these nine are
the only ones that are different from zero in the spherical

The total differential of a basis vector ﬁeld is given in
terms of the partial derivatives, in the same way as in
Eq. (2.61) for a scalar ﬁeld,
d⃗eµ = ∂⃗eµ

The Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their subscripts.

Chapter 7
Covariant differentiation
In this chapter a new sort of differentiation, called co-
variant differentiation, will be introduced. The new con-
cept will prove to be of fundamental importance, making
it possible to formulate coordinate invariant mathematical
expressions for the laws of nature.
Why coordinate invariance? Because the laws of na-
ture operated before humans constructed coordinate sys-
tems! We have to use language expressing the laws, and
the formulation of the laws should not depend upon the
choice of coordinate systems. As long as we distinguish
between (a) the motion of a body that is left to itself sub-
ject to no forces (a body showing inertial motion), and (b)
the motion of a body under the inﬂuence of gravity, we
are slaves of coordinate systems. Why? Because (a) is
said to be rectilinear and uniform, whereas (b) is said to
be curvilinear and nonuniform. And that is said to be so
295

7.1
Variation of vector components
296
on false grounds: By means of suitably choosing curvilin-
ear and nonuniformly moving (i.e. accelerated) systems
of reference and coordinate systems, any motion can be
described as rectilinear and uniform or curvilinear and
nonuniform. The wildest movements can be described
as locally straight. Einstein says that these different de-
scriptions are equally valid, In short: give up the distinc-
tion between (a) and (b) as absolute, use it as relative,
or better, relational. If it suits you, you may announce
that the Sun travels around the Earth. Unfortunately the
transformation mathematics is not easy, but in 1912 Ein-
stein learned it from his friend Marcel Grossmann, and it
formed an indispensable tool which he eventually used
in a masterly way when he formulated the general the-
ory of relativity.
7.1
Variation of vector components
Suppose we measure the wind at different points along
our path in the landscape. The strength and direction of
the wind varies from point to point. Let us describe the
velocity of the wind by a vector ﬁeld ⃗A(λ), where λ is an
invariant, i.e. coordinate independent, parameter along
our path, which we treat as a curve. The parameter λ
could for example be the path length along the curve, or
the time measured with a clock we carry with us, i.e. our
proper time. Mathematically the curve is given in para-

metric form (see Sect. 3.1) by specifying the coordinates
as functions of the parameter, xα = xα(λ).
Figure 7.1: The vector ﬁeld ⃗A and its decomposition at
two points P and Q on a curve S
Imagine that each point of the path is equipped with
a wind measuring apparatus, so that the strength and
direction of the wind may be measured at every point.
Then we go along the path S from a point P to a neigh-
bouring point Q, with parameters λP and λQ. As decom-
posed in a Cartesian coordinate system we have
⃗AP = AP
x ⃗ex + AP
y ⃗ey
and
⃗AQ = AQ
x ⃗ex + AQ
y ⃗ey.
The vectors and their components are illustrated in
Fig. 7.1.
The Cartesian basis vectors are without subscripts P
and Q, since they are constant. The change of the vector

7.1
Variation of vector components
298
ﬁeld from P to Q is denoted by (∆⃗A)PQ, and is given by
(∆⃗A)PQ = ⃗AQ −⃗AP.
In the case that Q is indeﬁnitely close to P the change of
the vector ﬁeld is found by differentiation with respect to
the curve parameter
d⃗A
dλ = lim
∆λ→0
∆⃗A
∆λ = d (Ax ⃗ex)
dλ
+ d (Ay ⃗ey)
dλ
.
The quantity d⃗A/dλ is the covariant directional derivative of
⃗A along the curve. Using the formula for differentiation
of a product, (uv)′ = u′v + uv′, we get
d⃗A
dλ = dAx
dλ ⃗ex + Axd⃗ex
dλ + dAy
dλ ⃗ey + Ayd⃗ey
dλ .
(7.1)
However, since the Cartesian basis vectors are constant,
this equation is reduced to
d⃗A
dλ = dAx
dλ ⃗ex + dAy
dλ ⃗ey.
(7.2)
This may be written in condensed form by means of the
Einstein summation convention,
d⃗A
dλ = dAm
dλ ⃗em,
m ∈{x1, x2}
with

x1 = x,
x2 = y.
(7.3)

7.1
Variation of vector components
299
Usually the vector components are given as functions of
the coordinates in a region. And along the curve where
the directional derivative of the vector ﬁeld is to be cal-
culated, the coordinates are given as functions of the pa-
rameter λ. The derivative dAm/dλ is then calculated by
using the chain rule of differentiation. First we calculate
the partial derivative of Am with respect to a coordinate,
then we multiply by the derivative of the coordinate with
respect to λ. This is done for all the coordinates. And ﬁ-
nally the products are added. In the present case (com-
pare with Eq. (2.61) with f = Am),
dAm
dλ
= ∂Am
∂x
dx
dλ + ∂Am
∂y
dy
dλ.
Using Einstein’s summation convention this is written
dAm
dλ
= ∂Am
∂xn
dxn
dλ .
(7.4)
Equation (7.3) then takes the form
d⃗A
dλ = ∂Am
∂xn
dxn
dλ ⃗em.
(7.5)
We have now come to a salient point. Equation (7.5) is
not valid for vectors decomposed in curved coordinate
systems. In that case the step from Eq. (7.1) to (7.2) is not
valid. This is due to the fact that in general the basis vec-
tors are not constant vectors, but vary from point to point.

7.1
Variation of vector components
300
Taking account of the variability of the basis vectors, and
using the formula (2.22) for differentiation of the product
between a scalar function and a vector function (in this
case a basis vector ﬁeld), we obtain

(7.6)
This equation gives the covariant directional derivative
of a vector along a curve, as decomposed in an arbitrary
coordinate system. Writing the equation as
dAµ
dλ ⃗eµ = d⃗A
dλ −Aµ d⃗eµ
dλ ,
we see that in general the change of the components of a
vector ﬁeld with position has two independent contribu-
tions; one from the variation of the vector ﬁeld itself, and
one from the change of basis vector ﬁeld in an arbitrary
coordinate system.
How then do we calculate d⃗eµ/dλ? In Eq. (6.13) Elwin
Christoffel comes to our rescue. From this equation fol-
lows that the derivative of the basis vectors with respect
to the curve parameter λ is
d⃗eµ
dλ = Γ ν
µα
dxα
dλ ⃗eν.
(7.7)

7.2
The covariant derivative
301
We are now able to answer those generalists who
thought, while reading the last chapter: this is for spe-
cialists, not for us. Our answer is that if, in the ﬁrst place,
we take the drastic step of introducing curvilinear coordi-
nates, then we have at least to be able to understand the
changes of vectors and their components as referred to
such coordinate systems. And the description of all such
changes necessarily makes use of the Christoffel symbols.
7.2
The covariant derivative
Equation (7.6) offers us an expression of the derivative of
a vector along a curve. We shall now ﬁnd a more pow-
erful expression, which is essential in the mathematical
development of the theory of relativity. The mathematics
may look difﬁcult in the sections that follow, and one may
wonder if it is necessary to go through all of this. Yes, we
must, if we are to say honestly that we have gone through
all of the mathematics needed to arrive at Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations.
Replacing Am by Aµ and n by ν in Eq. (7.4), we obtain
dAµ
dλ = ∂Aµ
∂xν
dxν
dλ .
Equation (3.16), which deﬁnes the components of a

7.2
The covariant derivative
302
tangent vector ⃗u may be written
uν = dxν
dλ .
(7.8)
Therefore
dAµ
dλ = ∂Aµ
∂xν uν = uν∂Aµ
∂xν .
(7.9)
Hence, the directional derivative of a scalar function f
along a vector ⃗u = uν⃗eν can be expressed by the compo-
nents of the vector and the partial derivatives as follows
df
dλ = uν ∂f
∂xν.
Einstein introduced a convenient shorthand for the par-
tial derivative of a function f, for instance the function
Aµ. The ﬁrst part of the right-hand side of Eq. (7.9) he
liked to write using a comma
∂Aµ
∂xν ≡Aµ
,ν.
(7.10)
Consequently Eq. (7.9) can be written
dAµ
dλ = Aµ
,ν uν.
(7.11)
From Eqs. (7.7) and (7.8) we obtain
d⃗eµ
dλ = Γ ν
µα uα ⃗eν.
(7.12)

7.2
The covariant derivative
303
Substituting Eqs. (7.11) and (7.12) into (7.6) we obtain
d⃗A
dλ = Aµ
,ν uν ⃗eµ + Aµ Γ ν
µα uα ⃗eν.
(7.13)
Our manipulations have disturbed the distribution of
summation indices. It is convenient to stick to our old
indices, so that the common factors u and ⃗e have equal
indices in both terms. We therefore let µ →α, ν →µ, and
α →ν in the last term. This has the desired effect: We can
use a parenthesis which units the two terms into one,
d⃗A
dλ = Aµ
,ν uν ⃗eµ + Aα Γ µ
αν uν ⃗eµ
= (Aµ
,ν + Aα Γ µ
αν) uν ⃗eµ.
(7.14)
Einstein has a useful shorthand notation of the whole of
what is inside the parenthesis:
Aµ
;ν ≡Aµ
,ν + Aα Γ µ
αν.
(7.15)
We end up with a new, very potent formula for the de-
rivative of a vector along a curve, as expressed through
its components in an arbitrary coordinate system,
d⃗A
dλ = Aµ
;ν uν ⃗eµ.
(7.16)
As mentioned above d⃗A/dλ is the covariant direction-
al derivative of ⃗A along the curve. The quantity Aµ;ν in

7.2
The covariant derivative
304
Eq. (7.16) is called the covariant derivative of the vector
component Aµ, and Aµ;ν uν is the covariant directional
derivative of the vector component Aµ in the direction
of the tangent vector ⃗u = uν⃗eν of the curve.
We started Ch. 6 with a small narrative: the choreog-
rapher who despairs entering a room where everything
is bulging. The dance he observes is not like the dance
he has ever choreographed. The dance itself corresponds
to the vector ⃗A, and what the choreographer observes
when he enters the bulging room, is a component of the
dance (the vector) as referred to the strange room. The
bulging of the room corresponds to the variability of the
basis vectors. Having received help from Christoffel for
some hours, the choreographer is able to choreograph the
dance in a room-independent way—“replacing commas
by semicolons”, and thereby obtaining a covariant de-
scription of the movements of the dancers, i.e. compo-
nent expressions valid in every coordinate system. He
can now anticipate how the dance will appear in an arbi-
trarily bulging room.
The force of a mathematical formalism depends very
much upon an economical notation.
Equation (7.16)
looks simple just because of Einstein’s clever notational
inventions. If written out it is rather complicated. Even in
the simplest, two-dimensional case the expansion of the
equation, as written in the ﬁrst line of Eq. (7.14), contains

(7.17)
In three-dimensional space there would be 36 terms, and
in four-dimensional spacetime 80 terms, and in n dimen-
sions n2(n + 1) terms. In comparison the general form in
Eq. (7.16) for the derivative of a vector is economical and
elegant—or, we are tempted to say: beautiful.
The geometrical interpretation of Eq. (7.17) may be
stated as follows. The expression Aµ;ν uν is the µ compo-
nent of the derivative of the vector ⃗A, giving the µ com-
ponent of the change of the vector ﬁeld ⃗A by an inﬁnites-
imal displacement in the direction of the curve. On the
other hand, Aµ,νuν describes the change of Aµ by such a
displacement. Hence, while Aµ, ν is a derivative acting on
the vector component Aµ, this is not so in the case of Aµ;ν.

7.2
The covariant derivative
306
In this respect the usual expression: Aµ;ν is the covariant
derivative of the vector-component Aµ, is somewhat mis-
leading. The covariant derivative essentially represents a
differentiation of the whole vector ⃗A, not only of its com-
ponents. In fact Aµ;ν may be different from zero even if
the component Aµ vanishes at all positions. This concep-
tually not trivial point is illustrated by Example 7.1 below.
Figure 7.2: A vector ﬁeld with vanishing radial compo-
nent
Example 7.1 Consider a vector ﬁeld ⃗A, in which the vectors
are directed along concentric circles (see Fig. 7.2), and have a

7.2
The covariant derivative
307
magnitude equal to the distance from the centre of the circles,
i.e. in polar coordinates
⃗A = r⃗eθ.
(7.18)
None of the arrows have a radial component. Therefore Ar = 0
everywhere, so that Ar,θ = 0, but from Eq. (7.15) we get in the
present case
Ar
; θ = Aθ Γ r
θθ.
Inserting Γ rθθ = −r from Eq. (6.18) and Aθ = r from
Eq. (7.18), we get
Ar
;θ = −r Aθ = −r2.
Thus the covariant derivative of Ar with respect to θ is different
from zero in spite of the fact that Ar is zero everywhere. This
means that there is a change of the vector ﬁeld itself (not of the
component Ar) under a dispacement in the ⃗eθ-direction.
Example 7.2 In this example we shall show how the compo-
nent expression of the acceleration of a particle in a curved co-
ordinate system, say in plane polar coordinates, is contained
in the expression for the covariant derivative. We shall con-
sider the ordinary Newtonian case and use Newtonian time t
as parameter along the path of the particle. Differentiation with
respect to time will be denoted by an overdot.
In plane polar coordinates the component expression of the
velocity is
⃗v = dr
dt ⃗er + dθ
dt ⃗eθ = ˙r⃗er + ˙θ⃗eθ.

7.2
The covariant derivative
308
The acceleration is
⃗a = d⃗v
dt.
(7.19)
Equation (7.13) shall now be applied to calculate the expression
for the acceleration in plane polar coordinates. Inserting the
left-hand of Eq. (7.11) in the ﬁrst term of Eq. (7.13), and using
Latin indices since only spatial components are involved, this
equation takes the form
d⃗A
dλ = dAk
dλ ⃗ek + Γ k
ij Aiuj ⃗ek.
(7.20)
Replacing the parameter λ by the time t, and the vectors ⃗A and
⃗u by the velocity ⃗v, we get from Eqs. (7.19) and (7.20),
⃗a =
 ˙vk + Γ k
ijvivj ⃗ek.
(7.21)
There are only three non-vanishing Christoffel symbols, given
in Eq. (6.18), in a plane polar coordinate system. Hence, in the
present case Eq. (7.21) reduces to
⃗a =
 ¨r + Γ r
θθ ˙θ2 ⃗er +
 ¨θ + 2Γ θ
rθ˙r ˙θ
 ⃗eθ,
where we have used the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols.
Inserting the values of the Christoffel symbols from Eq. (6.18),
we get
⃗a =

⃗eθ.

7.3
Transformation of covariant derivatives
309
The unit vectors correspnding to the basis vectors ⃗er and ⃗eθ are
⃗e^r = ⃗er and ⃗e^θ = (1/r)⃗eθ. They represent an orthonormal
basis ﬁeld in the plane polar coordinate system. The “physical
components” of the acceleration vector appear when the accel-
eration is decomposed in the orthonormal basis ﬁeld,
⃗a =
 ¨r −r ˙θ2 ⃗e^r +
 r ¨θ + 2˙r ˙θ
 ⃗e^θ.
(7.22)
In most books on mechanics this expression for the ac-
celeration in plane polar coordinates, is deduced by ge-
ometrical reasoning specially adapted to the particular
problem. As shown in Example 7.2, it is neatly contained
in the covariant formalism, which may be applied to all
sorts of coordinate systems.
7.3
Transformation of covariant de-
rivatives
In the old days, when space was believed to be ﬂat, one
could always introduce Cartesian coordinates, which
meant that a formulation of the laws of physics valid in
arbitrary coordinates could be dispensed with.
When
Einstein understood that gravitation should be described
in terms of curved spacetime, he also saw that he had
to formulate the laws of nature in a form valid in arbi-
trary curved coordinate systems. He knew that vectors

7.3
Transformation of covariant derivatives
310
do not change under a coordinate transformation, only
their components. Maybe a description in terms of vec-
tors might do?
In such a formulation of the theory the calculations
are performed in terms of the components of the vectors.
Since the laws, for example Newton’s 2nd law, are ex-
pressed by differential equations, one needs to differen-
tiate the vector components. If the derivative of a vec-
tor component is not itself a vector component, we are in
trouble with our vector formulation of the theory.
Vector components have one index. However, the par-
tial derivative of a vector component, say Aµ,ν, has two
indices. Hence it is not a vector component. So, a vec-
tor formulation of the theory does not fulﬁl Einstein’s re-
quirements. Einstein needed a theory of tensors of rank
higher than one (vectors are tensors of rank one).
The components of tensors of rank 2 have 2 indices,
just like the partial derivatives of vector components.
Maybe the partial derivatives of the components of a vec-
tor make up a tensor of rank 2? Let us investigate this.
Imagine that we have two coordinate systems {xµ} and
{xµ′}, where the marked coordinates are given as func-
tions of the unmarked ones, and vice versa, in a coor-
dinate transformation xµ′ = xµ′(xµ) and inversely xµ =
xµ(xµ′).
These expressions can be differentiated, and
∂xµ/∂xµ′ and ∂xµ′/∂xµ are the elements of the transfor-
mation matrix and its inverse. From the chain rule for

7.3
Transformation of covariant derivatives
311
differentiation follows that partial derivatives transform
as follows
∂
∂xν′ = ∂xν
∂xν′
∂
∂xν.
Using this together with Eq. (5.10) for transforming vec-
tor components, we get
Aµ′
, ν′ = ∂Aµ′
∂xν′ = ∂xν
∂xν′
∂Aµ′
∂xν
= ∂xν
∂xν′
∂
∂xν
∂xµ′
∂xµ Aµ

.
(7.23)
The product rule (2.24) gives
∂

∂xµ′
∂xµ Aµ

= ∂xµ′
∂xµ
∂Aµ
∂xν +
∂xµ′
∂xν∂xµ Aµ.
Inserting this into Eq. (7.23) we arrive at
Aµ′
, ν′ = ∂xν
∂xν′
∂xµ′
∂xµ Aµ
, ν + ∂xν
∂xν′
∂2xµ′
∂xν ∂xµ Aµ.
(7.24)
This shows that the partial derivatives of vector compo-
nents do not transform as tensor components, but in a
much more complicated way due to the presence of the
last term. In other words, they do not form a tensor. Even
if all Aµ, ν are zero, the Aµ′
, ν′ will in general not be zero
because of the second term.

7.3
Transformation of covariant derivatives
312
In order to be able to formulate the laws of nature in a
coordinate independent way, we need a new sort of dif-
ferentiation, such that the derivative of a vector compo-
nent is the component of a tensor of rank 2. The most
obvious candidate is the covariant derivative.
The transformation formula for the covariant deriva-
tive of a vector component follows most easily from
Eq. (7.16). Using the transformation formulae (5.10) and
(5.37) for vector components and basis vectors, respec-
tively, we get
d⃗A
dλ = Aµ′
;ν′ uν′ ⃗eµ′ = Aµ
;ν uν ⃗eµ = Aµ
;ν
∂xν
∂xν′ uν′ ∂xµ′
∂xµ ⃗eµ′.
Since the succession of the factors does not matter when
we calculate by means of Einstein’s summation conven-
tion, we obtain
Aµ′
;ν′ = ∂xµ′
∂xµ
∂xν
∂xν′ Aµ
;ν.
This is just the transformation formula for the mixed
components of a tensor of rank 2.
Hence, the covari-
ant derivative is the answer to our search for a suitable
derivative in a tensor formulation of a physical theory.

7.4
Covariant tensor components
313
7.4
Covariant differentiation of co-
variant tensor components
Equation (7.15) gives the covariant derivative of the con-
travariant vector components. We shall also need to know
the formula for the covariant derivative of the covariant
components of a vector. In order to deduce this formula
it is useful to start with the the simplest possible quantity:
a scalar. Such a quantity has no direction. If one differen-
tiates a scalar quantity, for instance a temperature ﬁeld,
the variation of the basis vectors of the coordinate system
does not matter. Therefore the covariant derivative of a
scalar function is deﬁned as the ordinary partial deriva-
tive. For the temperature ﬁeld T(x1, x2, x3) the covariant
derivative of T with respect to x1, is
T; x1 = T, x1 = ∂T
∂x1.
The dot product of a vector by itself is the square of
the magnitude of the vector. This is a scalar function. Ac-
cording to Eq. (5.78) this function is given by
⃗A · ⃗A = AµAµ.
Since the rule (2.24) for differentiating a product is valid
both for partial and covariant derivatives, we get
(AµAµ); ν = Aµ;ν Aµ + Aµ Aµ
;ν

7.4
Covariant tensor components
314
and
(AµAµ), ν = Aµ,ν Aµ + Aµ Aµ
,ν.
Using that the covariant derivative of a scalar function,
like AµAµ, is equal to the partial derivative, we obtain
Aµ;ν Aµ + Aµ Aµ
;ν = Aµ,ν Aµ + Aµ Aµ
,ν.
Substituting for Aµ;ν from Eq. (7.14) we get
Aµ;ν Aµ + Aµ (Aµ
, ν + AαΓ µ
αν) = Aµ,ν Aµ + Aµ Aµ
,ν.
Subtracting AµAµ, ν + Aµ Aα Γ µαν on each side leads to
Aµ;ν Aµ = Aµ,ν Aµ −AµAαΓ µ
αν.
Finally, exchanging the names of the summation indices
µ and α in the last term gives
Aµ;ν Aµ = Aµ , ν Aµ −Aα Aµ Γ α

In order that this shall be valid for arbitrary vectors ⃗A =
Aµ ⃗eµ, the factor in front of Aµ must be equal for every
Aµ. Therefore

This is the equation for the covariant derivative of covariant
vector components.

rank two. Energy and momentum conservation is de-
scribed by putting the covariant divergence of this tensor
equal to zero. Therefore we shall need to be able to calcu-
late the covariant derivatives of the components of a ten-
sor of rank two. They are given by the following formulae
for the contravariant, mixed and covariant components,
respectively:

Christoffel symbols expressed by
the metric tensor
In chapter 6 we calculated the Christoffel symbols from
the changes of the coordinate basis vectors with position.
In chapter 5 the metric tensor was introduced, and it was
mentioned that it is of fundamental importance in the
theory of relativity, and contains the information needed
to calculate the curvature of spacetime. In this section we
shall go one step further towards the calculation of curva-
ture from the components of the metric tensor, by deduc-
ing how the Christoffel symbols can be calculated from
the metric. Note, however, that there are non vanishing
Christoffel symbols even in ﬂat spacetime as described in

7.5

terms of curved coordinate systems. The Christoffel sym-
bols characterize the geometrical properties of the coordi-
nate system, not of spacetime itself. It will be shown in
chapter 9 how the curvature of spacetime can be calcu-
lated from the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives.
Consider the unit tensor of rank 2, whose mixed com-
ponents are equal to the Kronecker symbols, deﬁned in
Eq. (5.15). Let us calculate the covariant derivative of the
components. Using Eq. (7.26b) we get
δµ
ν ; β = δµ
ν , β + δα
ν Γ µ
αβ −δµ
α Γ α
νβ
= δµ
ν , β + Γ µ
νβ −Γ µ
νβ = δµ
ν , β = 0,
where the last equality follows since the partial deriva-
tives of the numbers 1 and 0 vanish. Thus the unit tensor
of rank 2 is a constant tensor.
As we saw in Eq. (5.79) the mixed components of the
metric tensor are equal to the Kronecker symbols. Hence
the metric tensor may be written (see Sect. 5.5)
g = δµ
ν ⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν,
i.e. it is just the unit tensor of rank 2. This is a constant
tensor, meaning that the derivative of the tensor along an
arbitrary curve with paramete λ vanishes,
dg
dλ = 0.
(7.27)
The covariant derivative of the tensor components of
a tensor of arbitrary rank are deﬁned in the same way as

7.5
Connection expressed by the metric
317
Eq.(7.16) for vector components. The covariant deriva-
tives of the mixed and covariant components of the met-
ric tensor, for example, are given by
dg
dλ = δµ
ν;β uβ ⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν = gµν;βuβ ⃗eµ ⊗⃗eν,
uβ = dxβ
dλ .
(7.28)
From Eqs. (7.27) and (7.28) follows
gµν ; β = 0.
Using Eq. (7.26c) this equation takes the form
gµν ; β = gµν , β −gαν Γ α
µβ −gµα Γ α
νβ,
which gives
gµν , β = gαν Γ α
µβ + gµα Γ α
νβ.
(7.29a)
Relabelling we have
gµβ , ν = gαβ Γ α
µν + gµα Γ α
βν
(7.29b)
and
gνβ , µ = gαβ Γ α
νµ + gνα Γ α
βµ.
(7.29c)
Taking Eq. (7.29a) + Eq. (7.29b) −Eq. (7.29c) we get
gµν,β + gµβ,µ −gνβ,µ = gανΓ α
µβ + gµαΓ α
νβ + gαβΓ α
µν
+ gµαΓ α
βν −gαβΓ α
νµ −gναΓ α
βµ.

7.5
Connection expressed by the metric
318
Due to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols and the
metric tensor, the ﬁrst and the last terms at the right-hand
side cancel, the third and the ﬁfth terms cancel, and the
second and fourth terms are equal. Exchanging the left
and right hand sides we thus get
2gµα Γ α
νβ = gµν , β + gµβ , ν −gνβ , µ.
Multiplying by gτµ, as deﬁned in Eq. (5.70), dividing by
2, and using the equation
gτµ gµα Γ α
νβ = δτ
α Γ α
νβ = Γ τ
νβ,
provides us with
Γ τ
νβ = 1
2 gτµ (gµν , β + gµβ , ν −gνβ , µ) ,
(7.30)
which is the desired expression. It is the expression you
will ﬁnd most often for calculating the Christoffel sym-
bols, if you go to a library and look rapidly through books
on general relativity.
There are in fact two kinds of Christoffel symbols. The
ones given by Eq. (7.30) are called Christoffel symbols of
the second kind. The Christoffel symbols of the ﬁrst kind,
Γαµν, are deﬁned by
Γαµν ≡gατΓ τ
µν.

7.5
Connection expressed by the metric
319
Inserting the expression (7.30) and using Eq. (5.74) we get
Γαµν = 1
2 gατgτβ (gλµ,ν + gβν,µ −gµν,β)
= 1
2 δα
β (gβµ,ν + gβν,µ −gµν,β) .
In the summation over β only terms with β = α are dif-
ferent from zero, since δα
β = 0 for β ̸= α. Thus we get
Γαµν = 1
2 (gαµ,ν + gαν,µ −gµν,α) .
(7.31)
These are the Christoffel symbols of the ﬁrst kind. They
will be used in Sect. 11.2.

Chapter 8
Geodesics
‘Geodesy’ comes from Greek γη, Earth, and δα´ιω, divide,
i.e. ‘Earth division’. ‘Geodesic’ will be used in a rather
special geometric sense in the following, but it will be re-
lated to the old problem of measuring the shortest path
on the curved surface of the Earth. From the Euclidean
geometry of a plane surface, we know that the shortest
path between two points is the straigth line between the
points on the surface. However, on the spherical surface
of the Earth you cannot ﬁnd straight paths, so the short-
est path between two points is the straightest possible path
on the surface between the points. Such paths are called
geodesic curves.
In this chapter we shall give a generally valid and
precise mathematical deﬁnition of the concept ‘geodesic
curve’. Such curves can be deﬁned in two conceptually
different, but mathematically equivalent ways; either as
320

8.1
Generalizing ‘ﬂat space concepts’
321
the shortest (or the longest—in spacetime) curve between
two points, or as the straightest possible curve.
We
choose to deﬁne a geodesic curve as the straigthest possi-
ble curve.
In order to approach a mathematical precision of the
concept ‘straightest possible’ we note that the tangent
vectors of a straight line on a plane, have the same direc-
tion. This means that the tangent vector ﬁeld of a straight
line consists of vectors that are connected by parallel
transport. In ﬂat space, or on a plane, this has an intu-
itively obvious meaning: if you move a tangent vector
along the curve, without changing the direction of the
vector, it will arrive at a new place on the curve and cover
(coincide with) a tangent vector at this place.
8.1
Generalizing ‘ﬂat space concepts’
to ‘curved and ﬂat space concepts’
As a prerequisite for a precise deﬁnition of ‘straightest
possible’ we shall in the next section deﬁne the concept
‘parallel transport’ of a vector in a covariant way. The
deﬁnition will be generally valid in curved as well as ﬂat
spaces. In this section we shall introduce a powerful and
simple method for making such general deﬁnitions. The
way we proceed here, is typical for the way that one can
generalize a mathematical concept, with a known equa-

8.1
Generalizing ‘ﬂat space concepts’
322
tion valid in Cartesian coordinates in ﬂat space, to a more
general concept, useful also in curved spaces: We start
with the known equation valid in ﬂat space. This is gen-
erally not a tensor equation. Then we construct a tensor
equation reducing to our ﬁrst equation in a Cartesian co-
ordinate system.
If we are to accept the resulting equation as a proper
generalization of the original equation, we must know
that there is only one tensor equation which reduces to
the original one in Cartesian coordinates. We need the
following theorem: If a tensor vanishes in one particular co-
ordinate system, then it vanishes in every coordinate system.
This is expressed mathematically by the transforma-
tion law Eq. (5.13) for the vector components, uµ′ =
(∂xµ′/∂xµ) uµ. If every uµ vanish, then every uµ′ vanish
also.
That this theorem is valid for the special case that the
tensor is a vector, is intuitively clear. We are used to think
of a vector as a coordinate-independent arrow with ﬁxed
length and direction. If a vector vanishes in one particu-
lar coordinate system, then there is no arrow, and a trans-
formation to a new coordinate system does not create a
vector. For a tensor of arbitrary rank the intuitive basis is
no longer there. But the component concept is essentially
the same as for vectors. If a tensor vanishes in one coordi-
nate system, then all the components of the tensor in this
coordinate system vanish, and the transformation laws

323
for tensor components, Eq. (5.80), then secures that all the
components of the tensor vanish in an arbitrary coordi-
nate system. This proves our theorem: tensors of arbitrary
rank are coordinate independent quantities, just like vectors.
This means that there is only one tensor generalization
of a non-tensorial equation valid in a Cartesian coordi-
nate system.
8.2
Parallel transport:
unexpected
difﬁculties
Figure 8.1: Parallel transport on a ﬂat surface
Imagine that we pick a piece of paper formed like an

8.2
Parallel transport: unexpected difﬁculties
324
arrow, and put it so that it covers the vector ⃗A on Fig. 8.1.
We will let the arrow slide along the boundary of the tri-
angle in such a way that its direction is not changed. If
we succeed in parallel transporting the arrow around the
triangle, it will return to the original position with just the
same orientation as it had when it left this position.
Let us now imagine that we are two-dimensional crea-
tures (‘ﬂatlanders’) on a great spherical surface. Unavoid-
ably it sounds like a paradox to ask for this, since it seems
to require that we may perceive ourselves simultaneously
as two-dimensional creatures on a surface, and as three-
dimensional creatures looking at ourselves on that sur-
face. Imagine, furthermore, that the spherical surface is
covered with a coordinate system like that on a globe,
such that we may deﬁne latitude and longitude on the
sphere. Assume that we are somewhere on the Equator,
with a straight arrow. Letting the arrow point along the
Equator we then proceed to walk eastwards to a certain
longitude. Then we turn northwards all the way to the
North Pole. After a long rest we turn southwards along
a latitude further west, so that we reach Equator at just
the point we started from. All the time we have kept the
direction of the arrow ﬁxed. But, as suggested in Fig. 8.2,
the result of this transport is not what we expect from our
parallel transport of an arrow on a plane.
We see, in Fig. 8.2, that when the arrow arrives at the
point of departure, after the round trip, it is pointing in a

8.2

direction which deviates from its direction at the start of
the trip.
It may be objected that the drawing is misleading. The
drawing of a curved surface is possible only if we imag-
ine that the surface is embedded in a ﬂat (Euclidean) 3-
dimensional space. One might suspect that our conclu-
sion that the direction of an arrow is changed during a
round trip on a spherical surface is, somehow, an illusory
result of our reasoning from a three-dimensional point of
view. That the result is real enough, however, also for
two-dimensional creatures on the surface, will be proved
mathematically in the next chapter.
Before proceeding to a mathematical deﬁnition of par-
allel transport, we owe it to the reader to comment a lit-
tle on the above thought experiment. How can we keep
the direction of the arrow constant? On the Earth there
is a magnetic ﬁeld determining the direction of a com-
pass needle. This leads outside the core of the theory
of relativity, which concerns space, time and gravitation,
not electromagnetism. What we therefore need, is a com-
pass of inertia. It was noted by the great mathematician
Kurt Gödel that such a compass exists, and it is remark-
ably simple. A pendulum is a ‘compass of inertia’. Its
swinging plane remains unchanged relative to the direc-
tion of the stars. The swinging plane of the pendulum
determines a ﬁxed direction of reference.

8.3
Deﬁnition of parallel transport
327
8.3
Deﬁnition of parallel transport
We shall ﬁrst describe parallel transport of vectors in a
Cartesian coordinate system in ﬂat space. Let a curve
pass through the space.
The curve is described math-
ematically by means of a parameter (curve-coordinate)
λ. Assume that there is a vector ﬁeld ⃗A in the space. If
the vectors of the ﬁeld are connected by parallel trans-
port, they all have the same direction. We shall also de-
mand that vectors connected by parallel transport have
the same length. Said in an intuitive way: If two vectors
in ﬂat space are connected by parallel transport, they are
identical except for their position. In other words: If the
vectors of a vector ﬁeld are connected by parallel trans-
port, then the vector ﬁeld is constant. And the derivative
of a constant vector ﬁeld vanishes. Thus
d⃗A
dλ = 0.
(8.1)
The left-hand side is the directional derivative of the vec-
tor ﬁeld along the curve. When we give a parametric de-
scription of the curve we specify the coordinates as func-
tions of the curve parameter λ (see chapter 3). So we may
use the chain rule for differentiation, Eq. (2.31), and write
(using Latin indices for components in a Cartesian coor-

8.3
Deﬁnition of parallel transport

dinate system)
d⃗A
dλ = ∂Am
∂xi
dxi
dλ = Am
, i ui.
In the last step we have introduced Einstein’s comma no-
tation (7.10) for partial derivatives, and the Eq. (3.16) for
the components of tangent vectors. Equation (8.1) can
now be written
Am
, i ui = 0.
(8.2)
This is the equation for parallel-transport of vectors, a s
expressed in a Cartesian coordinate system.
As we know from the transformation equation (7.24)
for partial derivatives of vector components, Eq. (8.2) is
not a tensor equation. It is not valid, as an equation for
parallel transport, in arbitrary coordinate systems. But
from the results of chapter 7 we know how to general-
ize this equation to one that is generally valid. We just
have to replace ordinary partial derivatives by covariant
derivatives.
Due to the ingenious notation introduced
by Einstein, this can be performed just by replacing the
comma in Eq. (8.2) by a semicolon. In this way we obtain
the covariant equation for parallel transport of vectors,
Aµ
;ν uν = 0.
(8.3)
Substituting the expression (7.15) for the covariant de-
rivative, the equation takes the form
Aµ
, ν uν + Aα Γ µ
αν uν = 0.

8.4
The general geodesic equation
329
Using Eq. (7.11) and placing Aα between Γ µαν and uν, we
get
dAµ
dλ + Γ µ
αν Aα uν = 0.
(8.4)
In this general form the equation for parallel transport
is suitable for two most important applications. In the
next section we shall see that the equation for geodesic
curves is closely related to it, and in the next chapter the
equation will be taken as a point of departure for the def-
inition of the Riemann curvature tensor.
8.4
The general geodesic equation
The deﬁnition of a ‘straightest possible curve’ may be
stated as follows: A curve is said to be straightest possible if
and only if the tangent vectors of the curve are connected
by parallel transport. Such curves shall be called geodesic
curves.
According to this deﬁnition the equation of a geodesic
curve is obtained from Eq. (8.3) just by replacing the arbi-
trary vector ⃗A by the tangent vector ⃗u of the curve. This
gives the equation of a geodesic curve on covariant form
uµ
; ν uν = 0,
(8.5)
which may be stated with words as follows: the covari-
ant directional derivative of the tangent vector ﬁeld of a

8.4
The general geodesic equation
330
geodesic curve, in the direction of the curve, is equal to
zero.
Using Eq. (8.4) this equation can be written as
duµ
dλ + Γ µ
αν uα uν = 0
(8.6)
or
d2xµ
dλ2 + Γ µ
αν
dxα
dλ
dxν
dλ = 0.
(8.7)
An equation expressed in terms of tensors, (and not
their components), is said to have an invariant form. The
invariant form of the geodesic equation is
d⃗u
dλ = 0.
(8.8)
Note that each of the component Eqs. (8.5)–(8.7), repre-
sents a set of n equations in an n-dimensional space; one
for each value of the index µ. This is understood to be
the case also for Eq. (8.8), although this fact is not visible
in this equation. A vector equation in four-dimensional
spacetime represents four component equations.
We shall give two illustrations; geodesics on an Eu-
clidean plane, and geodesics on a spherical surface.
Example 8.1 Let x and y be Cartesian coordinates on the
plane. Then all the Christoffel symbols are equal to zero, and
Eq. (8.6) is reduced to
dux
dλ = 0
and
duy
dλ = 0.

8.4
The general geodesic equation
331
These equations are integrated in just the same way as the cor-
responding equations of motion of a free particle in section 3.7.
Since the derivative of a constant is zero, we get
ux = k1
and
uy = k2,
where k1 and k2 are constants. Hence
dx
dλ = k1
and
dy
dλ = k2.
Integrating once more, using Eq. (3.33) with the substitutions
x →λ, p = 1 , and C = x0 in the ﬁrst equation and C = y0 in
the second, we ﬁnd
x = x0 + k1λ
and
y = y0 + k2λ.
This is the parametric equation of a straight line (see Eq. (3.15)
with t = λ, vx = k1, and vy = k2).
Example 8.2 Next we shall answer the question: what kind
of curves on a spherical surface are geodesic? We consider a
surface with radius R, and introduce spherical angular coordi-
nates x1 = θ and x2 = φ on the surface. In this case Eq. (8.7)
represents the following two equations (note that the symmetry
of the Christoffel symbols has been used)

(8.10)
To some readers the transition from Eq. (8.7) to Eqs. (8.9)
and (8.10) may for a moment seem slightly magical. But note
that α and ν in the Christoffel symbol of Eq. (8.7) are dummy
indexes. We have to expand and summarize with the substitu-
tions θθ, θφ, and φφ for αν. With xµ = θ we get Eq. (8.9), in-
cluding four Christoffel symbols, but the symmetry θφ = φθ
reduces this to 3. That is the reason for the factor 2 in the third
term of each equation. We are sorry to admit that the magic
vanishes. Note, also, that in the present case the invariant pa-
rameter λ is the arclength along the geodesic curve.
From Eq. (6.28) we ﬁnd that the only non-vanishing of
these Christoffel symbols are
Γ φ
θφ = cos θ
sin θ
and
Γ θ
φφ = −sin θ cos θ.
Consequently Eqs. (8.9) and (8.10) reduce to

(8.12)

8.4
The general geodesic equation
333
In order to ﬁnd the curves represented by these equations,
we note that a geodesic curve must be the intersection between
a plane and the spherical surface, since it is the straightest pos-
sible curve. Obviously such a curve must have circular shape.
Since there is no preferred direction on the surface we may
choose our coordinate system such that the intersecting circle
has a constant value of the angle θ, i.e. so that it is parallel to the
‘equatorial circle’ of the coordinate system. Thus d2θ/dλ2 = 0.
Then the second term of Eq. (8.11) must be equal to zero, in or-
der that this equation shall be fulﬁlled. Since dφ/dλ ̸= 0, this
demands sin θ cos θ to equal zero, which is possible only if the
angle θ = π/2 (in the interval from θ = 0 (the North Pole) to
θ = π/2 (the Equator)). Hence the geodesic curve is a great cir-
cle along the Equator. It remains to show that this solution also
satisﬁes Eq. (8.12). With θ = π/2 the second term in Eq. (8.12)
vanishes and the equation is reduced to d2φ/dλ2 = 0, giving
dφ/dλ = K, where K is a constant. Measuring the angle φ in
radians, we get K = 1/R, and φ = λ/R, which is the longitude
measured along the equatorial circle.
We have now found that the equatorial great circle is the
only curve with θ = constant that solves the geodesic equa-
tions. Since the orientation of our coordinate system is ar-
bitrary, we conclude that on a spherical surface the geodesic
curves are great circles.
The rather obvious result of Example 8.2 may lead the
reader to think that after all we have shot only a crow
with our cannon. However, the main point we have il-

8.5
Local Cartesian coordinates
334
lustrated with this example is that equations (8.5)–(8.8) de-
scribe geodesic curves, not only on ﬂat space relative to arbi-
trary coordinate systems, but in curved space as well.
The equation will be of vital importance in the the-
ory of relativity. According to this theory spacetime is
curved, and free particles move along geodesic curves in
spacetime (see Ch. 12).
8.5
Local Cartesian and geodesic co-
ordinate systems
A useful result is the following. At an arbitrary point P
in curved spacetime one can construct a coordinate sys-
tem in a small region around P such that the metric has
the Minkowski form given by Eq. (5.121) at P, and the
Christoffel symbols vanish at P.
The Minkowski form of the metric is obtained simply
by choosing a coordinate system with orthogonal unit ba-
sis vectors at P. Coordinates with vanishing Christoffel
symbols at P may be constructed as follows. Consider a
geodesic curve ⃗r(λ) through P. Let ⃗uP = (uµ)P(⃗eµ)P be
the unit tangent vector of the curve at P, as decomposed
in an arbitrary coordinate system. The parameter λ is the
path length, or distance, along the curve with λ = 0 at P.
We now introduce a special coordinate system {xµ} such

8.5
Local Cartesian coordinates
335
that at a point Q at a distance λ from P has coordinates
xµ = (uµ)Pλ.
(8.13)
In the new coordinate system, all geodesics through P
have equations of the form (8.13). Differentiating twice
with respect to λ, and remembering that (uµ)P are the
components of a ﬁxed vector, leads to
d2xµ
dλ2

P
= 0.
(8.14)
Comparing with the general geodesic equation (8.7), we
see that the Christoffel symbols vanish at P.
We have thus succeeded in constructing a coordinate
system around P with Minkowski metric and vanishing
Christoffel symbols at P. In the following this type of
coordinates shall simply be called local Cartesian coordi-
nates. From chapter 1 we know that the second deriva-
tive of a function describing a curve tells how fast its
direction changes, which means that it describes its cur-
vature. Equation (8.14) tells that, as referred to a local
Cartesian coordinate system, a geodesic curve in an ar-
bitrary space is straight. In this sense a geodesic curve
is the ‘straightest possible’ curve. From our knowledge
of curves and distances on ﬂat surfaces it is tempting to
conclude that the geodesic curve is also the shortest path
between the given points P1 and P2. However, when it

8.5
Local Cartesian coordinates
336
comes to geodesic curves in spacetime, you shall be pre-
sented with a great surprise.
The geodesic curves of
spacetime have the longest path lengths between two
events (see Sect. 5.14).

Chapter 9
Curvature
9.1
The curvature of plane curves
‘Spacetime is curved’. It is, of course, not easy to un-
derstand adequately what is meant by that sentence as
it occurs in the general theory of relativity. There are two
principal axes of ‘precisation’, one leads into pure math-
ematics, the other into physics and cosmology. We shall
start with the mathematical.1
One of the simplest properties of a space is its dimen-
sion, which was deﬁned in Sect. 5.1. If you wonder how
you can ﬁnd out the number of dimensions of a space,
1A formulation U is more precise than a formulation T if and only if the set
of different interpretations of U is a genuine subset of the interpretations of T. In
other words, if U is more precise than T, there is a higher deﬁniteness of meaning
and less ambiguity in U than in T. The more precise formulations, U1, U2, ..., are
called precisations.
337

9.1
The curvature of plane curves
338
you may just count how many positions in different ‘or-
thogonal’ directions you need in order to specify a point
in the space. The number you arrive at is the dimension
of the space. For example, if you want to make an ap-
pointment, you have to specify three positions, the lati-
tude, the longitude and the height in order to ﬁx a point
in space, and one number in order to ﬁx the point of time.
Thus spacetime is four-dimensional. If you want to spec-
ify a point on a curve one position sufﬁces. Thus a curve
may be considered as a one-dimensional space.
The simplest case of a one-dimensional space is a
straight line. It has no curvature. A straight line may
be called an Euclidean one-dimensional space. The next
simplest case is a curve in a plane, i.e. a plane curve. Let
us consider curves in the xy-plane, and assume that the
curves are graphs of differentiable functions, y = y(x).
In Sect. 2.3 it was mentioned that there is a connection
between the second derivative of a function and the cur-
vature of its graph. We shall now ﬁnd that connection.
A deﬁnition of the curvature of a plane curve is
needed. Qualitatively the curvature is an expression of
how fast the slope of a curve changes as we move along
the curve. In Fig. 9.1 we have drawn a part of a curve in a
region around a point P on the curve. Let φ be the angle
that the tangent to the curve at P makes with the x-axis.

From Eq. (4.3) and the ﬁgure is seen that
tan φ = dy
dx.
According to the deﬁnition (2.4) of the derivative it then
follows that
y′ = tan φ.
(9.1)
Let ds be a displacement along the curve correspond-
ing to a displacement dx along the x-axis and a displace-
ment dy along the y-axis. The curvature K of a plane
curve is deﬁned as the change of the slope angle φ per

K ≡dφ
ds .
(9.2)
The relationship between the displacements ds, dx,
and dy is given by the Pythagorean theorem.
(ds)2 = (dx)2 + (dy)2.
Putting (dx)2 outside a parenthesis we get

Here φ′ may be expressed in terms of y′′ by differentiat-
ing Eq. (9.1).

Eq. (2.31), since φ is a function of x , we ﬁnd
y′′ = (tan φ)′ =

Substituting for tan φ from Eq. (9.1) leads to

Inserting this into Eq. (9.3) and using that

y′2) = (1 + y′2)3/2, we ﬁnally arrive at the expression for
the curvature of a plane curve
K =
y′′
 1 + y′23/2.
(9.4)
The second derivative of y is not quite the same as the
curvature of the graph y = y(x). While y′′ is the rate of
change of slope (i.e. tangens to the slope angle) per unit
distance in the x-direction, the curvature K is the rate of
change of slope angle per unit distance along the curve.
Let us again consider the parabola y = x2 of Fig. 2.4.
This function has y′ = 2x and y′′ = 2. Thus, its curvature

9.2
The curvature of surfaces
342
is K = 2/(1 + 4x2)3/2. This expression shows that the cur-
vature of the parabola is largest, equal to 2, at x = 0, and
decreases towards zero for large values of x. Far away
from the y-axis the parabola approaches a straight line.
Looking at Fig. 2.4 you see that this is in accordance with
the shape of the curve. Note also that if we had tried to
deﬁne the curvature as the rate of change of slope per
unit distance along the x-axis, i.e. as y′′, we would have
found a constant curvature, equal to 2 for the parabola.
A constant curvature corresponds to a circular arc, which
clearly does not correspond to the shape of the parabola.
9.2
The curvature of surfaces
Let us inspect a simple surface; the surface of a cylinder.
Suppose the cylinder you look at is of paper and that you
roll it out like you would do with a rolled-up newspaper
fetched by your dog. If there were drawings of triangles
and other ﬁgures on the cylinder they would all retain
their shapes and lengths. There would be no trace of dis-
tortions or deformations. The geometry of a cylindrical
surface is the same as that of a ﬂat paper. The right trian-
gle drawn on a paper with lengths 3, 4, and 5 cm, retain
these quantities when we roll the paper into a cylinder.
The theorem of Pythagoras holds good also on the curved
cylindrical surface. The sum of the angles remains 180 de-
grees. Two-dimensional creatures on a cylinder develop

9.2
The curvature of surfaces
343
the plane Euclidean geometry. They have no concept of
a cylinder as we see it. But of course a sufﬁciently long
straight journey on the surface may lead back to where
they started. This is an astonishing fact for the cylindri-
ans, showing that the topology of their world is different
from that of an Euclidean plane.
As three-dimensional creatures we may curl the pa-
per cylinder more and more. The diameter of the cylin-
der gets smaller and smaller, the paper curves ‘more and
more’ per cm. The 5 cm straight line of our drawn tri-
angle is eventually changed into a spiral. But the cylin-
drians, as mathematicians, may not notice anything what-
soever. The geometrical measurements of the cylindrians
show no difference. Technically we say that the intrinsic
curvature of the cylindrical surface is zero. Embedded in a
three-dimensional space, it has curvature which is greater
or smaller. The curvature of a two-dimensional surface as
measured when embedded in a three-dimensional space
is called the extrinsic curvature.
In general relativity we are concerned with curved
four-dimensional spacetime, without reference to any
higher-dimensional ﬂat space in which spacetime could
be imagined to be embedded.
Thus by ‘curvature of
spacetime’ is always meant ‘intrinsic curvature’.
We
might speak of the extrinsic curvature of spacetime,
embedded in for example a ten-dimensional Euclidean
space, but there is no need for such an exploit.

9.2
The curvature of surfaces
344
We shall deduce an expression showing how the in-
trinsic curvature of a two-dimensional surface can be
found by measurements on the surface itself. The circum-
ference and radius of a circle can be measured by means
of a ruler. The quotient between these quantities is equal
to 2π on a plane. We shall ﬁnd how the intrinsic curva-
ture of a surface is given by the deviation of this quotient
from 2π.
Figure 9.2: Surface of a dome
Consider a small part of any surface, for instance a
part of the surface of a dome which surrounds a point
P. By making the neighborhood around P small enough,
the form of the considered mathematical surface will de-
part as little as one pleases from a spherical form. This is
illustrated in Fig. 9.2.
From this ﬁgure and the deﬁnition of an angle as mea-

9.2
The curvature of surfaces
345
sured in radians (see Sect. 4.1) we see that
α = r
R.
The ﬂatter the dome, the larger is R, and the smaller is the
angle α. Furthermore
sin α = ρ
R.
Thus
ρ = R sin α = R sin(r/R).
Also, as shown more clearly in Fig. 9.3
θ = s
ρ,
where s is the distance along the circle C extended by the
angle θ. We get
s = θρ = θ R sin(r/R).
(9.5)
This expression shall be used to ﬁnd the curvature at a
point P of the surface depicted on Fig. 9.2. In general the
curvature of a surface is a function of the position on the
surface. The curvature at P is a local quantity, generally
different from the curvature at other points on the sur-
face. Therefore, we shall need to develop an expression
for s, valid for very small values of r. This is performed
by means of a series expansion of the expression (9.5).

Here R is the radius of the sphere that the surface
around P is part of. The extrinsic curvature—the curva-
ture measured from the outside of the surface—is called
‘KE’, and is deﬁned as
KE ≡1

It is called extrinsic because it refers to the radius of cur-
vature R of the two-dimensional surface as embedded
in the three-dimensional space external to the surface.

9.2
The curvature of surfaces

The intrinsic curvature KI is called the Gaussian curvature.
From Eqs. (9.9) and (9.10) it follows that for the consid-
ered surface KI = KE
2. This extremely simple relation is
not easily seen intuitively, and is not valid in general. It is
due to the special property of the considered surface; that
this surface was assumed to be indistinguishable from a
spherical cap at a sufﬁciently small region around a point
P. This is not a general property of surfaces. The cylin-
drical surface we mentioned above, for example, is locally
similar to a plane. It has KE ̸= 0 and KI = 0.
In general the extrinsic curvature of a surface may be
characterized as follows. At every point on the surface
we consider the straightest possible curves with different
directions. We then ﬁnd the curvature of these curves.
They curve in the direction normal to the surface. Gen-
erally the curvature varies with the direction of the curve
(except in the isotropic case that we considered above).
The maximal and minimal curvatures are called the ‘prin-
cipal curvatures’ of the surface, and are denoted by κ1
and κ2. The extrinsic curvature is deﬁned by
KE ≡1
2 (κ1 + κ2).
(9.11)
The intrinsic (Gaussian) curvature is given by
KI ≡κ1 κ2.

For a spherical surface κ1 = κ2, which gives KI = KE

1/R2. In the case of a cylindrical surface κ1 ̸= 0 and κ2 = 0,
which gives KE = κ1/2 ̸= 0 and KI = 0.
If KI ̸= 0, KI may be either positive or negative. The
case we have considered in Fig. 9.2 has ℓ< 2πr, giving
KI > 0.
The geometry of such surfaces is called parabolic. In
the case that l > 2πr, the spherical surface is replaced by
a surface similar to a saddle. In this case KI < 0. The
geometry of such surfaces is called hyperbolic.
In elementary school the famous π is a symbol for the
ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle,
and the value of π is given as 3.14159 · · · . True or false?
On a ﬂat surface: true. But what about circles drawn on
curved surfaces? Think of a circle on a spherical surface.
Let the centre of the circle be at the North Pole. From the
point of view of a Euclidean three-dimensional space in
which the spherical surface is embedded, the radius of
the circle is a curved path on the surface, from the North
Pole to the circle. Assume that the radius of the circle
is made larger, so that the circle approaches the Equator,
and even passes the Equator. Then the circumference of
the circle decreases while the radius increases. Obviously,
the ratio of the length of the circumference and the length
of the radius of the circle is not constant when the radius
of the circle increases. It is due to the curvature of the
surface.
What we have seen is that if one maintains the school-

9.2
The curvature of surfaces
351
deﬁnition of π, then the magnitude of π will depend upon
the diameter of the circle that it refers to. This may be
maintained, but not the implicit assumption that the cir-
cle must be drawn on a ﬂat surface. But both mathemat-
ical and physical ﬂatness is an extremely special condi-
tion.
Deﬁning the concept of π as quotient between circum-
ference and diameter, its value may vary from zero to
inﬁnity, dependent upon the curvature of a surface! We
shall in what follows mercifully retain the value of π you
always ﬁnd, by modifying the school deﬁnition of π,
since it is admittedly not very practical that π might
sometimes be equal to 2.15 and sometimes for example
equal to 8.50. In order not to violate the near-sacredness
of 3.14159 · · · we need only to add four words to the def-
inition of π: “on a ﬂat surface”. This more precise deﬁni-
tion has a consequence with respect to the number of ra-
dians we get for the angle around a circle (see Sect. 4.1.1).
In order that a radian shall be a geometry-independent
measure of an angle, we shall demand that the number
of radians around a circle is the same whether it refers to
circles on ﬂat or curved surfaces. Then the deﬁnition of a
radian must also refer to a ﬂat surface. We shall illustrate
all this by example 9.1.
Example 9.1 Consider a circle on a spherical surface, as
shown in Fig. 9.4.
Here ℓis the circumference of a circle with radius r on

the spherical surface. Let us for a moment retain the ‘school-
deﬁnition’ of π mentioned above and apply it to curved space
ϖ ≡ℓ
2r.
(9.13)
The symbol ϖ also denotes the Greek letter π, but we reserve
the π symbol for the ﬂat space value
π = 3.14159 · · · .
The radius of the circle on the shaded plane in Fig. 9.4 is
denoted by ρ. Since the geometry is Euclidean on this plane,
ℓ= 2πρ.
(9.14)
Inserting Eq. (9.14) into Eq. (9.13) gives
ϖ = ρ
r π.
Now we want to express ϖ as a function of α, the angle at the
centre of a globe (see Fig. 9.4). It is seen that
ρ = R sin α
so that
ϖ = R sin α
r π
.
(9.15)
Since α is measured in radians
α = r

ϖ(α) = sin α

Let us consider some particular values, remembering that
we refer to measurements performed at the North Pole.
For a small circle around the North Pole α ≈0 and the
measured value of ϖ according to the ‘school-deﬁnition’, is

α→0 ϖ(α) = π lim

α→o

α = π,
where we have used the fact that in the limit α →0 it is sufﬁ-
cient to retain the ﬁrst term in the MacLaurin series, Eq. (9.6),
for sin α.
For the equatorial circle the angle α is deﬁned with reference
to our Euclidean paperplane. Thus the equator corresponds to
the angle α = π/2 , giving
ϖ(π/2) =
π
π/2 = 2 π
π = 2.
If our observer at the North Pole measures π using a circle
with centre at the North Pole, and with the largest as possible
radius, r (see Fig. 9.4), namely a small circle at the South Pole
of the surface, he gets
ϖ(π) = 0
ππ = 0.

9.2
The curvature of surfaces
355
Generally when the curvature of a surface is positive, ϖ <
π.
The simplest surface with negative curvature is a
saddle shaped surface, as shown in Fig. 9.5.
Figure 9.5: A surface with negative curvature
A circle drawn on such a surface is shaped like a wave
going up and down. The length of such a curve with a
given radius is clearly longer than the length of a plane
circle with the same radius. This means that the value of
ϖ ≡ℓ/(2r) is greater than π on a surface with negative
curvature.
When we come to the geometry of three-dimensional
spaces—or even four-dimensional spacetimes—the pos-
sibility of obtaining a visual image of the curvature of
the space has been lost. We must resort to less intuitive

9.3
Curl
356
ways of describing the geometry of such spaces. How-
ever, it was discovered by ‘the prince of mathematics’,
Carl Friedrich Gauss—in what he called ‘theorema egre-
gium’ (‘the extraordinary theorem’), that an inhabitant
of, say, a three-dimensional space, may perform measure-
ments, within the three-dimensional space, which reveals to
him the curvature of the space he lives in. This may be
achieved by performing analogous measurements to the
one we treated in the last paragraph, where the curva-
ture of a surface was found by measuring how the quo-
tient between the circumference of a circle and its diam-
eter deviates from the ‘Euclidean’ value 3.14.... In the
following paragraphs we shall consider one such ‘intrin-
sic’ way of measuring the curvature in a space with an
arbitrary number of dimensions, namely by measuring
the change suffered by a vector when it is parallel trans-
ported around a closed path in a curved space.
9.3
Curl
The main topic of this chapter is to introduce a deﬁnition
of the Riemann curvature tensor. This will be done by
calculating the change of a vector by parallel transport
around a small closed curve in a curved space. The idea
of using such a procedure comes from the considerations
in Sect. 8.2, where we found that a vector parallel trans-
ported around a triangle on the Earth suffers a change,

9.3
Curl
357
while on a plane there is no such change.
Before we can proceed with the calculation, we need
to make a few deﬁnitions. Consider a vector ﬁeld ⃗B, and
a closed curve T. Let d⃗r = dxν⃗eν be an inﬁnitesimal dis-
placement vector along the curve. The circulation C of ⃗B
around the curve is deﬁned as
C ≡
I
⃗B · d⃗r,
(9.17)
where the symbol
H
means the integral around the curve.
The scalar product ⃗B · d⃗r is the magnitude of the vector
⃗B times the projection along the vector of an inﬁnitesimal
displacement d⃗r along the curve. We can say the circu-
lation of a vector ﬁeld represents the ‘ﬂow’ of the vector
ﬁeld around a closed curve. If, for example the curve is a
stream line in a ﬂuid, and ⃗B = ρ⃗v, where ρ is the density
of the ﬂuid and ⃗v its velocity ﬁeld, the circulation repre-
sents the rate of ﬂow of ﬂuid mass around the curve.
We shall now deﬁne the curl of a vector ﬁeld. Let ⃗n
be the unit vector normal to a small surface with area ∆S
enclosed by the curve T. The component of the curl of a
vector ⃗B in the ⃗n direction is deﬁned by
curl ⃗B ≡⃗n lim
∆S→0
1
∆S
I
⃗B · d⃗r.
(9.18)
The curl of a vector ﬁeld ⃗B is the circulation density, i.e.
the circulation of ⃗B around small curve T per unit area

9.3
Curl
358
of the surface enclosed by T. If ⃗B is the velocity ﬁeld,
⃗B = ⃗v, the curl is a local measure of the rate of rotation of
a ﬂuid. A ﬂuid with curl free velocity ﬁeld is said to be
irrotational.
Writing lim∆S→0 ∆S = dS, and multiplying each side
of Eq. (9.18) by dS, we have
I
⃗B · d⃗r = (curl ⃗B)n dS,
where (curl ⃗B)n is the component of curl ⃗B normal to the
surface dS. This equation says that the circulation of a
vector ﬁeld ⃗B around an indeﬁnitely small curve T is
equal to the curl of the vector times the area of the sur-
face enclosed by T. Introducing coordinates {xα, xβ}, the
component of curl⃗B normal to the surface are written
(curl ⃗B)αβ and the area of the surface dSαβ. Then the cir-
culation of ⃗B around T can be expressed in the following
way
I
⃗B · d⃗r = (curl ⃗B)αβ dSαβ.
(9.19)
We shall now calculate the curl of a vector ﬁeld ⃗B in
the most simple case of a vector ﬁeld in a plane covered
with a Cartesian coordinate system, i.e. an (x, y) plane. In
the following it will be advantageous to express a vector
by its covariant components (subscripts), and not by its
contravariant components (superscripts). The covariant
components of the vector ﬁeld are Bx(x, y) and By(x, y).

9.3
Curl
359
Consider a small curve T, enclosing a rectangular sur-
face with area ∆Sxy = ∆x ∆y, as shown in ﬁg.9.6.
Figure 9.6: Inﬁnitesimal curve
The counterclockwise circulation of ⃗B around the
curve T is the sum of the ﬂow rates along the sides, i.e.
of the component of ⃗B times the length of the side. The
ﬂow rates are:
Fbottom = Bx(x, y) ∆x,
Fright = By(x + ∆x, y) ∆y,
Ftop = −Bx(x, y + ∆y) ∆x,
Fleft = −By(x, y)∆y.
We add opposite pairs to get, for the top and bottom

edges:
−[Bx(x, y + ∆y) −Bx(x, y)] ∆x = −∆Bx
∆y ∆y ∆x
and for the right and left sides
[By(x + ∆x, y) −By(x, y)] ∆y = ∆By
∆x ∆x ∆y.
Adding these expressions gives the circulation around
the rectangular curve T
C =

Taking the limit of an indeﬁnitely small rectangle, we get
from the deﬁnition (9.18) of the curl
curl ⃗B =

⃗ez.
Using Einstein’s comma notation for partial derivatives,
and denoting the z component of the curl by (curl ⃗B)xy,
we have
(curl ⃗B)xy = By,x −Bx,y.
This expression is valid in a Cartesian coordinate system
only. The covariant generalization is obtained by replac-
ing the ordinary partial derivatives by covariant deriva-
tives,
(curl ⃗B)αβ = Bβ;α −Bα;β.
(9.20)

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
361
However, due to the symmetry (6.31) of the Christoffel
symbols one can, in fact, replace the covariant deriva-
tives by ordinary partial derivatives in arbitrary coordi-
nate systems. This can be seen as follows. Inserting the
expression (7.25) for the covariant derivative of covariant
vector components into Eq. (9.20) we get
(curl ⃗B)αβ = Bβ,α −BτΓ τ
βα −(Bα,β −BτΓ τ
αβ)
= Bβ,α −Bα,β −Bτ (Γ τ
βα −Γ τ

Since the last term vanishes the expression
(curl ⃗B)αβ = Bβ,α −Bα,β.
(9.21)
is valid in an arbitrary coordinate system.
9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
We made appeal to our intuition in chapter eight, to see
what would happen to a vector if it was parallel trans-
ported around a closed curve on a spherical surface, such
as, for example, on the surface of a globe. We reached
the thought provoking result that when we transport the
vector ﬁrstly along the equator, then along a certain lon-
gitude to the North Pole, and then along another longi-
tude back to the equator so that it reaches the point of
departure, then the vector will not point along the same

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
362
direction as when it started! If a similar trip is performed
on a plane surface, or even on the surface of a cylinder, no
change of direction will take place. The change seems to
depend in some way upon the curvature of the spherical
surface, as distinct from a plane or cylindrical surface. In
this connection it may be noted that a cylindrical surface
may be ‘rolled out’ on a plane surface.
In the following we shall search for a consistent geo-
metrical interpretation of the change of direction of a vec-
tor due to parallel transport around a closed curve. This
will turn out to be rather involved since we are seeking
a mathematical expression valid for curved surfaces gen-
erally, that is, for an overwhelmingly rich variety of sur-
faces. You are invited to take part in what might be called
‘index gymnastics’. The equations in this section are rel-
atively short and simple, but looking closely you will no-
tice a bewildering change of indices. There is reason to
suspect that Einstein, who felt he was a pure physicist,
and never a mathematician, disliked this sort of gymnas-
tics. But he saw no way to avoid it in his search for a
relativistic theory of gravitation. So he not only learned
it and mastered it. He also contributed to this part of the
mathematics by inventing useful notation—as for exam-
ple the Einstein summation convention.
Let us start by inspection of a small area ∆S on a plane
surface.
This area is enclosed by a pair of coordinate
curves of an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system (see

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
363
Figure 9.7: An area on a plane surface.

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
364
Fig. 9.7). Parallel transport on a plane surface does not
change a vector. If we denote the change of a vector ⃗A
due to parallel transport around a closed curve by ∆⃗A,
then, in the case of a plane surface, we may safely write
∆⃗A = 0.
In this chapter we intend to deduce an expression for ∆⃗A
in the case of parallel transport around an inﬁnitely small,
closed curve on a curved surface of any kind. We shall
then use the notation d⃗A instead of ∆⃗A.
In our deduction of the general expression for d⃗A we
will need to know how the components of ⃗A change dur-
ing parallel transport. As made clear in Sect. 8.2, if the
vectors of a vector ﬁeld ⃗A are connected by parallel trans-
port along a curve, then the vector ﬁeld is constant along
the curve. This is expressed by the vector equation (see
Eq. (8.1))
d⃗A = 0,
which holds in curved space as well as in ﬂat space.
There is something strange here. Parallel transport-
ing a vector around a triangle on a spherical surface we
found a change ∆⃗A ̸= 0. However, by adding vanish-
ing changes d⃗A around a curve one cannot get a non-
vanishing change. The solution of this apparent paradox
is that the change of a vector d⃗A, when the vector is par-
allel transported an inﬁnitesimal distance dxµ, vanishes

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor

only to ﬁrst order in dxµ. Another way of expressing this
is to say that the change of a vector ﬁeld by parallel trans-
port is not visible when we are concerned only with ﬁrst
derivatives of the vector ﬁeld. But if we calculate to sec-
ond order in the differentials there is such a change.
If the vector changes by parallel transport around a
curve, then the components of the vector will change by
such a transport, too, since the vector is transported back
to the same point it started from, with the same basis
vectors. We shall, as announced, calculate the change of
the vector components when the vector is parallel trans-
ported around an indeﬁnitely small curve. It turns out
to be most convenient to calculate the changes dAµ of the
covariant vector components. Parallel transporting a vec-
tor ⃗A a coordinate distance dxν we have
Aµ;νdxν = 0.
Inserting the expression (7.25) for the covariant deriva-
tives of the covariant vector components, we get
Aµ,νdxν = Aτ Γ τ
µνdxν.
Thus
Aµ,ν = AτΓ τ
µν.
(9.22)
Furthermore, the change of Aµ by parallel transport along
dxν is
dAµ = Aτ Γ τ
µνdxν.
(9.23)

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
366
According to what was said above one might be sur-
prised that we need not include a second derivative term
in the expression for dAµ.
However, according to
Eq. (9.21), the sum of the ﬁrst derivatives (the Christoffel
symbols) around a curve may be expressed by the second
derivatives (the derivatives of the Christoffel symbols) on
the surface enclosed by the curve. Therefore the expres-
sion (9.23) is sufﬁciently accurate.
We shall now calculate the total change, ∆Aµ, of Aµ by
parallel transport around a closed curve. In other words,
we shall integrate dAµ, as given by Eq. (9.23), around the
curve,
∆Aµ =
I
dAµ.
The right-hand side of Eq. (9.23) can be written
dAµ = Bµν dxν,
(9.24)
where the quantities Bµν are given by
Bµν = AτΓ τ
µν.
(9.25)
We now introduce vectors ⃗Bµ with covariant components
Bµν in order to write the right-hand side of Eq. (9.24) as a
scalar product. Usually vector components have only one
index. Here we need two, one index µ to specify which
vector we consider, and one index ν to specify the compo-
nent of the vector (the x component or the y component

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
367
and so forth). According to Eq. (5.119) the scalar prod-
uct of two vectors, ⃗N and d⃗r, can be expressed in terms
of their components in an arbitrary coordinate system as
follows
⃗N · d⃗r = Nν dxν
where d⃗r = dxµ⃗eµ have been used. In the present case
the components Nν are replaced by the components Bµν
of the vectors ⃗Bµ, and we have
dAµ = Bµν dxν = ⃗Bµ · d⃗r.
Thus the total change of the vector components Aµ
around an indeﬁnitely small curve T of arbitrary shape,
is equal to
∆Aµ =
I
dAµ =
I
⃗Bµ · d⃗r.
(9.26)
Comparing with Eq. (9.17) we see that Eq. (9.26) is just the
circulation of ⃗Bµ around the curve.
According to
Eq. (9.19) this is equal to a sum of the components of the
curl of ⃗Bµ times the components of the area dSαβ of the
surface enclosed by the curve. The components of the
curl are given by Eq. (9.21). Thus
∆Aµ = (curl ⃗B)αβ ∆Sαβ = (Bµβ,α −Bµα,β) ∆Sαβ.
Inserting the expression (9.25) for the components of ⃗Bµ
we get
∆Aµ =
h
(AτΓ τ
µβ),α −(AτΓ τ
µα),β
i
∆Sαβ.

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
368
Differentiating the products AτΓ τµα and AτΓ τµβ and re-
naming the summation indices so that τ is replaced by ν
in the second and fourth terms, gives
∆Aµ = (Aτ,αΓ τ
µβ + AνΓ ν
µβ,α −Aτ,βΓ τ
µα
−AνΓ ν
µα,β) ∆Sαβ. (9.27)
According to Eq. (9.22) (replacing µ by τ, ν by β and τ by
ν) Aτ,α = AνΓ ντα and (replacing µ by τ, ν by α and τ by ν)
Aτ,β = AνΓ ντβ. Inserting these expressions into Eq. (9.27),
we get
∆Aµ = (AνΓ ν
τα Γ τ
µβ −AνΓ ν
τβ Γ τ
µα + AνΓ ν
µβ,α
−AνΓ ν
µα,β) ∆Sαβ.
Putting the common factor Aν outside the parenthesis,
and exchanging the factors in the products of the
Christoffel symbols (only for aestetic reasons, to get the
same succession of the indices α and β in the two ﬁrst
terms and the two last terms), we get
∆Aµ = (Γ τ
µβ Γ ν
τα −Γ τ
µα Γ ν
τβ + Γ ν
µβ,α
−Γ ν
µα,β) Aν ∆Sαβ. (9.28)
The Riemann curvature tensor
is the fourth rank tensor
with components Rνµαβ deﬁned by
Rν
µαβ ≡Γ τ

τα −Γ τ
µα Γ ν
τβ + Γ ν

µα,β.
(9.29)

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
369
The change of the covariant components a vector ⃗A by
parallel transport around an indeﬁnitely small closed
curve enclosing a surface with area dSαβ may now be
written
∆Aµ = 1
2Rν
µαβ Aν ∆Sαβ.
(9.30)
The change of the vector itself is given by the change of
its components, (raising the index µ at both sides of the
last equality sign)
∆⃗A = ∆Aµ⃗eµ = 1
2 Rνµ
αβ Aν ∆Sαβ ⃗eµ,
(9.31)
since the vector has been parallel transported around a
closed curve and thus has come back to the point where
its transport started, with the same basis vectors.
Equation (9.31) shows that the change of a vector by
parallel transport around a closed path in a curved space,
is proportional to the product of the curvature of the
space and the area of the surface enclosed by the path.
The result expressed in Eq. (9.31) is purely mathemat-
ical.
It concerns the curvature of curved surfaces and
curved spaces. The ‘theorema egregium’ of Gauss is con-
tained in Eq. (9.28), since the values of the Christoffel
symbols and their derivatives are deﬁned ‘intrinsically’,
i.e. without reference to any higher-dimensional space
which the one with curvature Rµναβ could be embedded
in. Due to its mathematical character this theorem needs

9.4
The Riemann curvature tensor
370
no empirical support, it tells nothing about the physi-
cal world. The geometrical theory can be developed ab-
stractly as a non-geometrical, logical system. The terms
‘vector’, ‘point’, ‘coordinate’, and ‘path’ are then intro-
duced without any reference to a physical space that we
might be said to live in.
Drawings on a paper are of
no signiﬁcance for the deductions. Drawings are only of
heuristic value.
However, some equations of the abstract system can
be made to correspond to certain empirically studied phys-
ical relationships. If we construct a theory which, for ex-
ample, through certain equations, successfully predicts
how light moves in ﬂat spacetime, and also in curved
spacetime, we would talk of a physical spacetime, whose
geometrical properties we then can investigate empiri-
cally. The general theory of relativity is just such a the-
ory. This makes it meaningful to talk about the geometry
of physical spacetime.
We
shall
further
on
be
talking
about
a
four-
dimensional model of the universe where we are born
and presumably are going to die. But the level of abstrac-
tion will be astonishing. Abhorrent and frightening to
some, awesome to others. The so-called Einstein equa-
tions, superceeding Newton’s, require skyhigh levels of
abstraction.
The question is unavoidable: will humanity never get
back to a fairly easily understandable, but grand theory

9.4

of the universe of the Newtonian kind? For those who
hope to see a trend in that direction, the development of
this century has been discouraging.

Chapter 10
Conservation laws of clas-
sical mechanics
10.1
Introduction
In order to be able to understand Einstein’s ﬁeld equa-
tions we should ﬁrst consider some important concepts
of Newtonian physics.
Three fundamental principles of Newtonian physics
are:
1. conservation of momentum (mass times velocity)
2. conservation of mass
3. conservation of energy
372

10.1
Introduction
373
The general theory of relativity is a theory which is concep-
tually very different from Newtonian mechanics and gravita-
tional theory. It is often said that Einstein’s theory gener-
alizes Newton’s theory. This must, however, be under-
stood in a restricted sense; the general theory of relativity
contains the predictions of Newton’s theory of gravita-
tion, as a limiting case with small velocities (compared to
the velocity of light) and weak gravitational ﬁelds. Physi-
cists are conﬁdent that the general theory of relativity can
describe, with great accuracy, also phenomena involving
strong gravitational ﬁelds, such as very compact stars,
and systems with great velocities, like the expanding uni-
verse. But to do this a new conceptual framework had to
be invented.
Of particular signiﬁcance is the concept ‘spacetime’
which was introduced into physics by Hermann Min-
kowski in a famous speech on September 21, 1908, start-
ing by the words:
The views of space and time which I wish to
lay before you have sprung from the soil of ex-
perimental physics,
and therein lies their
strength. They are radical. Henceforth space
by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade
away into mere shadows, and only a kind of
union of the two will preserve an independent
reality.
If one wants to apply a theory of gravity to the interior

10.1
Introduction
374
of a star, or to the universe as a whole, one must be able
to combine a law of gravitation with a hydrodynamical
formulation of the basic principles stated above. This is
because both the interior of stars and the contents of the
universe as a whole can today most simply be modelled as
a kind of ﬂuid or a gas.
For example, the simplest model of the cosmic mass
is a ﬂuid or gas without viscosity, called ‘perfect ﬂuid’.
It has by deﬁnition only three properties: mass (energy),
pressure (or tension) and motion. These properties are
represented by the mass density (mass per unit volume),
ρ, the pressure, p, and a velocity ﬁeld, ⃗v.
In this chapter we shall study slowly moving systems
in regions free of gravitational ﬁelds. Such systems can be
adequately investigated by means of conventional New-
tonian dynamics, as formulated in the nineteenth century.
However, in order to prepare for the covariant formula-
tion of the fundamental laws of nature in the way they
appear in the general theory of relativity, we shall here
describe ﬂuids moving in the four-dimensional ﬂat space-
time of special relativity, using a tensor formalism that
may also be applied in curved spacetime.
So, even if
the numerical results obtained when the equations of this
chapter are applied to hydrodynamical problems, for ex-
ample to the task of predicting tomorrow’s weather, are
equal to those of Newton’s theory—the spirit of our treat-
ment is due to Einstein and Minkowski.

10.2
Divergence
375
10.2
Divergence
In order to be able to give a condensed, general mathe-
matical formulation of the fundamental conservation
laws, we shall need to become familiar with what is
called the divergence. Even if this concept is of a geo-
metrical nature, it will be useful to introduce it by means
of a physical example.
Imagine that something is ﬂowing out from a region
and something ﬂows into it.
In some regions, called
‘sources’, more is ﬂowing out of it than into it. For ‘sinks’
the situation is the opposite one.
In the story which unfortunately has contributed in
the forming of a negative picture of wolves, namely Little
Red Riding Hood, more is moving into the cavern than
out of it. The cavern is a sink. On the other hand, the
sun or a birth clinic, is a source. More heat or people are
ﬂowing out of it than into it.
The ﬂux of a quantity through a surface is deﬁned as
the product of that quantity and the area of the surface.
We deﬁne the divergence of a quantity at a point P as the
net ﬂux per unit volume of that quantity moving out or
in from an indeﬁnitely small region surrounding P.
Already at this point one may guess that a conserva-
tion law can be expressed mathematically in terms of a
vanishing divergence. Our task now is to express the con-
cept ‘divergence’ mathematically.

10.2
Divergence
376
Figure 10.1: A small volume

10.2
Divergence
377
Let an indeﬁnitely small region around a point P be
equipped with a Cartesian coordinate system, as shown
in Fig. 10.1. The point P is located in a vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y,
z). The physical meaning of ⃗F is of no signiﬁcance. But if
one wants to think of something which is streaming, then
one might let ⃗F represent, for example, the velocity ﬁeld
of a ﬂuid. Our region is now chosen as a parallel-epiped
(generalization of the cube, with different lengths of the
sides) with side-lengths ∆x, ∆y, ∆z along the coordinate
axes.
Consider the z direction. At the point P the z compo-
nent of the vector ﬁeld is Fz(x, y, z). A small distance ∆z
from P along the z axis the z component has changed to
Fz(x, y, z+∆z). In Fig. 10.1 this component is represented
by a longer arrow than the one at P. From our deﬁnition
then follows that the region is a source of ⃗F as far as the z
direction concerns.
The z component of the net ﬂux of⃗F out of the parallel-
epiped is
Fz(x, y, z + ∆z)∆x ∆y −Fz(x, y, z)∆x ∆y.
The volume of the parallel-epiped is
∆V = ∆x ∆y ∆z.

10.2
Divergence
378
The z component of the net ﬂux per unit volume is
[Fz(x, y, z + ∆z) −Fz(x, y, z)] ∆x ∆y
∆x ∆y ∆z
= Fz(x, y, z + ∆z) −Fz(x, y, z)
∆z
.
Adding the x, y, and z components and taking the limit
of an indeﬁnitely small region, we ﬁnd the divergence of
⃗F(x, y, z) at P
div⃗F = lim
∆x→0
Fz(x + ∆x, y, z) −Fz(x, y, z)
∆x
+ lim
∆y→0
Fy(x, y + ∆y, z) −Fy(x, y, z)
∆y
+ lim
∆z→0
Fz(x, y, z + ∆z) −Fz(x, y, z)
∆z
.
Comparing this with the deﬁnition of partial derivatives
of functions of several variables (see Sect. 2.8), we ﬁnd
div⃗F = ∂Fx
∂x + ∂Fy
∂y + ∂Fz
∂z .
(10.1)
If we use Einstein’s summation convention, and the
comma notation for partial derivatives, this can be writ-
ten as
div⃗F = ∂Fi
∂xi = Fi
,i.
(10.2)

10.2
Divergence
379
The deﬁnition of divergence, as formulated above, does
not refer to any particular coordinate system. The partic-
ular expressions (10.1) and (10.2), however, are only valid
in locally Cartesian coordinate systems. We sorely need
a coordinate independent generalization of these expres-
sions.
The mathematical apparatus that we have developed
makes it nearly miraculously simple to ﬁnd this gener-
alization. It is simply the tensor-expression which is re-
duced to Eq. (10.1) in a locally Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem. The tensor-generalization of partial derivatives of
tensor components is found just by replacing the partial
derivatives with covariant derivatives. Thus, the tensor
expression replacing Eq. (10.2) is found by replacing the
comma by a semicolon
div⃗F = Fµ
;µ.
(10.3)
We have also replaced Latin indices referring to Cartesian
coordinates in three-dimensional space by Greek indices
referring to arbitrary coordinates in spacetime. Note that
in spacetime the summation extends over the time coor-
dinate and the three space coordinates.
The generalization of Eq. (10.3) to the divergence of a
tensor-ﬁeld T µν of rank 2 is a vector with components
(div T)µ = T µν
;ν.
(10.4)
In general, taking the divergence of a tensor-ﬁeld reduces
its rank with one. For example the divergence of a tensor

10.3
The equation of continuity
380
of rank 2 is a vector, and the divergence of a vector-ﬁeld
is a scalar (i.e. the ﬁeld of a tensor of rank 0).
If the divergence of a vector ﬁeld vanishes, one gets a
single (scalar) equation
Fµ
;µ = 0.
We started this section with an application of mathemat-
ics to physics, in the sense of an illustration. We end this
section with a purely mathematical concept. However,
the next section starts and ends within physics.
10.3
The equation of continuity
In sections 10.3–10.5 we shall derive the two basic equa-
tions governing the motion of ﬂuids moving slowly com-
pared to the velocity of light. This is needed to formulate
a relativistic hydrodynamics, which will be used when
we are going to apply the general theory of relativity to
the task of modelling the large scale structure of our uni-
verse.
In Newtonian physics we postulate that mass is con-
served. Consider a ﬂuid in a region with volume V en-
closed by a surface with area S. Conservation of mass,
meaning that no mass is created or destroyed, can then
be expressed by the equation

increase of mass within
a volume V per unit time

=

net ﬂux of mass across
surface S per unit time

.

10.3
The equation of continuity
381
We shall now express this equation in terms of our math-
ematical language.
Mass density, ρ, is deﬁned as mass per unit volume,
ρ = m
V ,
where m is the mass inside a volume V. Hence
m = ρ V.
(10.5)
We have here assumed that V is sufﬁciently small that the
density is constant inside the volume.
The current density of a ﬂuid is deﬁned as the mass
density of the ﬂuid times its velocity.
Consider the surface of a cube, at rest in a reference
frame with a Cartesian coordinate system. The ﬂuid is
here ﬂowing in the negative y direction of coordinate sys-
tem. The cube is oriented as in Fig. 10.1. During a time
interval dt a ﬂuid-element moves a distance dy = v dt
normal to the surface facing the positive y axis. The ﬂuid
having passed this surface during a time interval dt ﬁlls a
volume dV
=
A dx
=
A v dt inside the cube (see
Fig. 10.2). The mass entering the cube through this sur-
face during the time dt, is
dx m = −ρ dV = −ρ A dy
= −ρ A v dt = −ρ v A dt.
(10.6)
The minus sign has been included since a positive veloc-
ity v is directed out of the sweep-net, causing a decrease of

10.3
The equation of continuity
382
Figure 10.2: The inﬁnitesimal volume dV

10.3
The equation of continuity
383
mass inside it. A negative velocity causes an increase of
mass inside the cube.
Equation (10.6) shows that the mass which has passed
through the surface element during the time dt, is minus
the ﬂux of the current density, ρ v times dt. The amount
of mass, dm, which has passed through all the walls of
the cube during a time interval dt is therefore minus the
net ﬂux of the ﬂuid’s current density through all the walls
of the cube times dt.
The divergence of a quantity is deﬁned as the net ﬂux
of the quantity per unit volume. Thus, the net increase
of ﬂuid-mass in a time interval dt, inside the cube with
volume V, is
dm = −div(ρ⃗v) V dt.
(10.7)
On the other hand, if the cube has constant volume,
the change of mass inside it results in a change of density,
dt ρ = ∂ρ
∂t dt.
In general the density is a function both of time and po-
sition. In the present case we consider the change of den-
sity at a ﬁxed place in the ﬂuid. It is the local change
of density when it varies with the time. This has been
marked by a subscript t on the differential, and has made
it necessary to use partial derivatives. From Eq. (10.5)
follows that the corresponding change of mass inside the

10.4
The stress tensor
384
cube may be expressed by
dm = V dtρ = ∂ρ
∂t V dt.
(10.8)
Setting the two expressions (10.7) and (10.8) for dm equal
to each other, leads to
∂ρ
∂t V dt = −div(ρ⃗v) V dt
or
∂ρ
∂t = −div(ρ⃗v).
(10.9)
This is called the equation of continuity of classical hydro-
dynamics, which might better be called ‘the equation of
mass conservation’. It is the mathematical expression of
the assumption that mass is conserved, i.e. that mass is
neither created nor destroyed.
Note that mass is not always conserved. For example
in nuclear reactions there may be a loss of mass which is
transformed into energy. Relativistically one would say
that mass-energy is conserved also in such a situation,
but in Newton’s theory mass conservation and energy
conservation are two different assumptions.
10.4
The stress tensor
A so-called ‘perfect ﬂuid’ is deﬁned as a ﬂuid which (ac-
cording to Newton’s theory) has only four ‘dynamical’

10.4
The stress tensor

properties: mass, energy, stresses, and motion. We shall
at ﬁrst discuss how the stresses are represented mathe-
matically in classical ﬂuid dynamics.
Figure 10.3: A cube inside a ﬂuid
A small cube inside a ﬂuid is drawn in Fig. 10.3. A
vector pointing orthogonally to a surface is called a nor-
mal vector of the surface. We now introduce a Cartesian
coordinate system so that the sides of the cube are ly-

10.4
The stress tensor
386
ing along the coordinate-axes. Then the unit normal vec-
tors of the cube’s surfaces are ⃗ex, ⃗ey, and ⃗ez. A stress-
component—force per unit area—acting on a surface
with normal vector ⃗ei and pointing in the direction of
⃗ej, is termed ti j. The ﬁrst superscript indicates the nor-
mal vector of the surface on which the stress acts, and
the second superscript shows the direction of the force-
component. Thus, tx x, tx y, and tx z are, respectively, the
x, y, and z components of the stress acting on the sur-
face with normal vector ⃗ex.
The stress-component tx x
points in the direction orthogonal to the yz plane (having
normal-vector ⃗ex) on which it acts. It is therefore called
a normal stress. The stress-components tx y and tx z point
along this plane. They are called shear stresses. The exis-
tence of shear stresses depends upon some sort of friction
in the ﬂuid. A perfect ﬂuid is friction-free. So, there are
no shear stresses in a perfect ﬂuid. A normal-stress point-
ing towards the surface it acts upon, is called a pressure,
while a normal-stress pointing away from the surface is
called a tension.
The nine stress-components acting in an arbitrary
ﬂuid make up a stress tensor of rank 2. The components
are often written in matrix form as follows.
tij =


txx txy txz
tyx tyy tyz
tzx
tzy
tzz

.
The shear stress txy is the force per unit area acting

10.4
The stress tensor
387
upon the front side of the cube (see Fig. 10.3), and point-
ing in the y direction. It tends to give the cube a rotat-
ing motion in the counter-clockwise direction about the z
axis. In order that this rotational motion shall not increase
beyond any limit, it must be counteracted by a force, tyx
per unit area, on the right-hand side of the cube, acting in
the x direction. If these stress-components shall keep the
cube in equilibrium, the condition txy = tyx must be ful-
ﬁlled. If txy ̸= tyx these stress components would cause
the ﬂuid elements to rotate faster and faster, which is not
observed. In a similar way, considering rotations about
the x and y axes, leads to the conclusion that the stress
tensor must be symmetric.
The pressures are usually denoted by px, py,˘aand pz
and correspond to the three ﬁrst diagonal components of
the stress tensor txx = px, tyy = py, and tzz = pz. In a
perfect ﬂuid the pressure is isotropic, px = py = pz = p.
The stress tensor of a perfect ﬂuid with isotropic (same in
all directions) pressure is reduced to
tij = p δij,
(10.10)
where the Kronecker symbol may here be thought of as
the metric tensor of ﬂat three-space in a Cartesian coordi-
nate system.

The net surface force acting on a ﬂuid element
388
10.5
The net surface force acting on a
ﬂuid element
In order to ﬁnd an expression for the resultant surface
force acting on our ﬂuid element, we start by considering
the force-components in the x-direction. We denote the
stress acting on the surface of the cube in Fig. 10.3 with
normal vector ⃗ex by ⃗tx. Stress is force per unit area. In
other words, force is stress times area. Since the area of
the surface is ∆x ∆y, the force acting on this surface is
⃗Fx = ⃗tx ∆y ∆z.
This force can be expressed in component form
⃗Fx(x + ∆x, y, z) = [ txx(x + ∆x, y, z)⃗ex
+ txy(x + ∆x, y, z)⃗ey
+ txz(x + ∆x, y, z)⃗ez ] ∆y ∆z. (10.11a)
The ﬁrst term represents the force in the x direction act-
ing on the right-hand surface normal to the x axis, with
corresponding interpretations of the other terms.
The reason for the arguments x + ∆x inside the paren-
theses is that the surface with normal vector ⃗ex is located
at the position x + ∆x. The surface with normal vector
−⃗ex, on the other hand, is at the position x (we shall keep
an arbitrary x in our expressions, even if x = 0 in the

10.5
The net surface force acting on a ﬂuid element
389
drawing), and since this force points in the negative x di-
rection, it is given by
⃗Fx(x, y, z) = [ −txx(x, y, z)⃗ex −txy(x, y, z)⃗ey
−txz(x, y, z)⃗ez ] ∆y ∆z, (10.11b)
In the same way, we ﬁnd the forces on the remaining four
surfaces of our cube
⃗Fy(x, y + ∆y, z) = [ tyx(x, y + ∆y, z)⃗ex
+ tyy(x, y + ∆y, z)⃗ey
+ tyz(x, y + ∆y, z)⃗ez ] ∆x ∆z, (10.11c)
⃗Fy(x, y, z) = [ −tyx(x, y, z)⃗ex −tyy(x, y, z)⃗ey
−tyz(x, y, z)⃗ez] ∆y ∆z, (10.11d)
⃗Fz(x, y, z + ∆z) = [ tzx(x, y, z + ∆z)⃗ex
+ tzy(x, y, z + ∆z)⃗ey
+ tzz(x, y, z + ∆z)⃗ez ] ∆x ∆y, (10.11e)
⃗Fz(x, y, z) = [ −tzx(x, y, z)⃗ex −tzy(x, y, z)⃗ey
−tzz(x, y, z)⃗ez ] ∆x ∆y. (10.11f)
We now compute the x component (the six terms of
Eqs. (10.11a)–(10.11f) in front of the basis vector ⃗ex) of the

10.5
The net surface force acting on a ﬂuid element

resultant surface force ⃗S acting on all the surfaces of the
cube. It is due to the normal stresses acting on the ±⃗ex

written as

Similar equations are valid for the y and z components of
the force ⃗S. Denoting an arbitrary force component by Si,
we obtain
Si = ∂tji
∂xj V.
Using the symmetry of the stress tensor, tji = tij, we get
Si = ∂tij
∂xj V.
Comparing with the expression (10.4) for the divergence
of a tensor of rank 2, we ﬁnd that
⃗S = V div T,
where T is the stress tensor. This equation shows that the
net surface force per unit volume on a ﬂuid element is
equal to the divergence of the stress tensor.
In the case of a perfect ﬂuid the only stress is the pres-
sure, and the stress tensor reduces to the form in
Eq. (10.10). Inserting this in Eq. (10.12) leads to

Thus, the x component of the net pressure force per unit

The y and z components of this force are given by similar
expressions, but with partial derivatives with respect to

The gradient of a function f(x, y, z) is denoted by grad f
and is deﬁned as a vector which has the following com-
ponent form in a Cartesian coordinate system,
grad f ≡∇f∂f

Cartesian coordinate system takes the form1:
∇= ∂
∂x ⃗ex + ∂
∂y ⃗ey + ∂
∂z ⃗ez.
(10.15)
The pressure gradient is a vector pointing in the di-
rection in which the pressure increases fastest, and with a
magnitude equal to the rate of change of the pressure in
this direction. Equation (10.13) says that the net pressure
force per unit volume on a ﬂuid element has a magni-
tude equal to that of the pressure gradient, and points in
the opposite direction of the pressure gradient,
⃗s = −∇p.
Hence the net pressure force on a ﬂuid element points in
the direction of maximally decreasing pressure. In index
notation the equation for the i component of this force
takes the form
si = −∂p
∂xi.
(10.16)
This expression will appear below in the equation of mo-
tion of a ﬂuid.
10.6
The material derivative
The velocity of a ﬂuid element may change for two dif-
ferent reasons. Think of a ﬂuid element in a river. Firstly,
1For a general deﬁnition of the gradient operator, see Appendix A

10.6
The material derivative
394
the velocity of the water in the river may increase with
time due to for example heavy rain, and, secondly, the
ﬂuid element may move into a narrow region of the river
with a greater ﬂow velocity.
This is a typical situation for all sorts of ﬁelds, not only
velocity ﬁelds. Imagine you are measuring the temper-
ature of a gas, while you are moving through it with a
thermometer. The temperature you measure may change
because it is evening and the air cools towards the night,
and it may change because you move northwards toward
cooler regions. In other words the temperature measured
by a moving thermometer may change both because the
temperature ﬁeld changes with time, and because it is in-
homogeneous, i.e. the temperature is different at different
places.
These changes are represented mathematically by two
sorts of derivatives, called the local derivative and the con-
vective derivative, respectively. Their sum is called the total
derivative. Their deﬁnition will appear in a natural way
when we consider the total differential of a ﬁeld f(x, y, z,
t) (scalar ﬁeld or vector ﬁeld—that does not matter)
which is a function of the time coordinate and the three
spatial coordinates (see chapter 2)
df = ∂f

Here dx

dt are the x, y, and z components of the
velocity of the measuring apparatus through the ﬂuid. The
rate of change of f with time which this apparatus mea-
sures, is df
dt. This quantity is the total derivative of f. The
term ∂f
∂t represents the rate of change of f that would be
measured by an apparatus at rest. It is the local derivative
of f. The three remaining terms in Eq. (10.17) represent
the rate of change of f that would have been measured
by the moving apparatus due to the position dependence
of f in a stationary ﬂuid, i.e. in a ﬂuid where this property
does not change with time. It is the convective derivative
of f.
If the measuring apparatus moves with the ﬂuid, so
that
dx

dt = vy,
and

where vx, vy, and vz are the components of the ﬂuid veloc-

10.7
The equation of motion
Newton’s second law says that the vector sum of the
forces acting on a ﬂuid element is equal to the mass of
the ﬂuid element times its acceleration, ⃗a. The forces act-
ing on an element of a ﬂuid may be separated into two
parts in a natural way. On the one hand there are the so-
called ‘body forces’, ⃗G, acting on the whole of the ﬂuid
element. A prominent example is the force of gravity or
weight of a ﬂuid element. On the other hand there are
forces ⃗S acting upon the surface enclosing the ﬂuid ele-
ment, for example pressure forces. Newton’s second law
as applied to a ﬂuid element with mass m thus may be
written
⃗G + ⃗S = m ⃗a.

10.7
The equation of motion
397
In hydrodynamics it is most useful to consider the
force per unit volume on a ﬂuid element. Also one prefers
to exchange the two sides of the equation, in order to em-
phasize that the acceleration of a ﬂuid element is result-
ing from the forces acting on it. So, we write the equation
of motion as
ρ D⃗v
Dt = ρ ⃗g + ⃗s,
where ⃗s is the pressure per unit volume introduced in
Eq. (10.13), and ⃗g is the acceleration of gravity. The i com-
ponent of this equation is
ρ Dvi
Dt = ρ gi + si.
Substituting for D vi/D t from Eq. (10.18) and for si from
Eq. (10.16) leads to the standard form of the equation of
motion for a perfect ﬂuid, called Euler’s equations of mo-
tion,

corresponding equation of motion.

Four-velocity
According to Newton’s conceptions a body moves
through three-dimensional space. There exists a univer-
sal time t, and the velocity of the body is the rate of
change of position with time in this space. As decom-
posed in a Cartesian coordinate system the velocity is
⃗v = vx ⃗ex + vy ⃗ey + vz ⃗ez = dx
dt ⃗ex + dy
dt ⃗ey + dz
dt ⃗ez
or
⃗v = vi ⃗ei = dxi
dt ⃗ei.
(10.20)
Since the metric in an ordinary Cartesian coordinate
system is (see Eq. (5.15) for the deﬁnition of the Kronecker
symbol,
and Eq. (5.60) for the metric in a two-
dimensional Cartesian coordinate system)
gij = δij,
the square of the magnitude of a usual three-velocity is

The magnitude |⃗v| of the velocity in three-space is called

10.8
Four-velocity
399
We shall now go on to deﬁne the velocity of a body
in spacetime. Since spacetime is four-dimensional, vec-
tors in spacetime must have four components. They are
therefore called four-vectors.
Furthermore time is not universal according to the
special theory of relativity. The Lorentz transformation,
Eq. (5.98), imply that people moving relative to each other
will not agree as to which events are measured as simul-
taneous.
And their clocks do not go equally fast (see
Ch. 5).
The velocity of a body in spacetime is called the four-
velocity. The components of the four-velocity should be
given by expressions similar to those of an ordinary ve-
locity in three-space (see Eq. (10.20)); rate of change of
coordinates with time. In order that these expressions
shall indeed transform as vector-components, the coordi-
nates must be differentiated with respect to an invariant
time appropriate for the particular body which is to be
studied. In chapter 5 we deﬁned such an invariant time;
the proper time of the body, dτ. It is the time shown by a
clock that moves together with the body. So, we deﬁne
the four-velocity of a body by
⃗u ≡dxµ
dτ ⃗eµ.
(10.21)
Let us consider a particle moving in ﬂat spacetime
with Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z, t).
An inﬁnitesimal

10.8
Four-velocity
400
distance vector in spacetime, d⃗r = dxµ⃗eµ, then has com-
ponents dx, dy, dz, and dt. The ﬁrst three components
are measured in metres and the last one in seconds. Thus,
the components of the distance vector in a space direction
and the time direction seem to be measured in different
units. This cannot be correct. The components of a vector
are just the projections of the vector onto chosen direc-
tions. It must be possible to measure all the components
of a vector in the same unit. Thus, in connection with
four-vectors the time coordinate t is not a suitable coor-
dinate. We must introduce a time coordinate x4 that is
measured in metres! In order to obtain a change from sec-
onds to metres we must multiply by metres per second,
i.e.
metre = metre
second second.
Thus we must multiply the time coordinate by a veloc-
ity. In order that the new coordinate x4 shall represent
time, and nothing else, this velocity must be a universal
constant. There is only one such velocity, the velocity of
light, c. The unique choice of time coordinate in connec-
tion with four-vectors is therefore
x4 = c t.

10.8
Four-velocity
401
The square of the magnitude of a four-velocity is
|⃗u|2 = |⃗u · ⃗u| = |uµuµ|
= |gµνuµuν| =
gµν
dxµ
dτ
dxν
dτ
 .
(10.22)
Combining this with the general expression for the line
element, Eq. (5.120), we get
|⃗u|2 =

ds2
dτ2
 .
According to the deﬁnition (5.115) of the proper time in-
terval, the line element may be written
ds2 = −c2dτ2.
Inserting this in Eq. (10.22) gives
|⃗u|2 = | −c2 | = c2.
The magnitude of the four-velocity of an arbitrary body,
its ‘speed’ in spacetime, is therefore, surprisingly
|⃗u| = c.
(10.23)
This equation shows that all bodies move with the same
constant speed in spacetime. Nothing is at rest. A body
at a ﬁxed position in space moves in the time direction,

10.8
Four-velocity
402
meaning that the body’s distance in spacetime from the
Big Bang event representing the creation of our universe,
increases steadily.
Looking at Eq. (10.21) we ﬁnd that u4 = dx4/dτ =
c(dt/dτ). Hence, the four-velocity has a time component,
which is equal to c times the rate of change of coordinate
time with proper time. However, the direction of the ve-
locity of a material body in spacetime differs from that of
light. Light has a greater velocity component in the spa-
tial direction than any particle.
Consider a particle moving through a coordinate sys-
tem with an ordinary (three-dimensional) speed v. Then
the relation between the coordinate-time and the proper-
time of the particle is given in Eq. (5.117). Inserting this
into the expression for the spatial components of the four-
velocity we obtain
ui = dxi
dτ =
1
p
1 −v2/c2
dxi
dt =

p
1 −v2/c2.
These four-velocity components can clearly be greater
than c. It seems that bodies can move faster than light,
after all. However, these four-velocity components are
the rate of change of (spatial) position with proper time.
And the proper-time measured on a clock moving with
the velocity of light does not change at all. So the spatial
four-velocity components of light are inﬁnitely great.

The time component of the four-velocity is
ut = c dt
dτ =

1 −v2/c2,
where we have used Eq. (5.117) for the relativistic time
dilation. Consequently the component-form of the four-
velocity is
⃗u = γ (vx ⃗ex + vy ⃗ey + vz ⃗ez + c⃗et)
where
γ = 1/
q
1 −v2/c2.
In the case of a slowly moving body, vi ≪c, so γ →
1, and the components of the four-velocity is, with good
approximation, given by
uµ = (vx, vy, vz, c).

10.9
Newtonian
energy-momentum
tensor of a perfect ﬂuid
In order to obtain a uniﬁed representation of all the prop-
erties of a perfect ﬂuid (see Sect. 10.4), the remaining

10.9
Newtonian energy-momentum of a perfect ﬂuid
404
properties—mass, energy and motion—must also be rep-
resented by a symmetric tensor of rank 2. The quantity
combining these properties in Newton’s theory is simply
a scalar function; the kinetic energy of a ﬂuid element. The
kinetic energy per unit volume is
Ekinetic = 1
2 ρ v2,
(10.25)
where ρ is the mass density of the ﬂuid, and v is the speed
of the ﬂuid element.
Since we are going to describe ﬂuids in four-dimen-
sional spacetime, not in Newton’s three-dimensional
space, we must form a sort of generalization of Eq. (10.25)
in terms of the four-velocity ⃗u = uµ⃗eµ of the ﬂuid-element.
Because this generalization shall be a tensor of rank 2,
it cannot involve just the magnitude of the four-velocity.
However, the products uµ uν transform as components of
a tensor of rank 2. Since the succession of the vector com-
ponents does not change the values of the products, this
tensor is symmetric.
The density of the ﬂuid is deﬁned as the mass of the
ﬂuid per unit volume. As applied to our ﬂuid-element,
it is the mass of the ﬂuid-element divided by its volume.
In Newton’s theory the density of the ﬂuid is invariant
against a transformation from one reference frame to an-
other. This is not the case in the special theory of rel-
ativity, due to the Lorentz contraction of a ﬂuid element,
making its volume less, and the relativistic mass increase,

10.9
Newtonian energy-momentum of a perfect ﬂuid
405
making the mass greater, the faster the ﬂuid element
moves through three-space. However, the density of the
ﬂuid as measured by an observer following its motion, is
just the same as if the ﬂuid were at rest. It is called the
proper density of the ﬂuid, and is equal to the Newtonian
density, ρ. The proper density of the ﬂuid is an invariant
quantity.
Using the theory of relativity, Einstein deduced in
1905 a relationship between the energy E of a system and
its mass m, namely E = m c2. Just as x4 = c t and t is es-
sentially the same quantity, a time coordinate, the equa-
tion E = m c2 means that according to the theory of rela-
tivity energy and mass are essentially the same physical
quantity. The only difference is that they are measured
in different units. We need not then introduce both mass
and energy to represent this quantity in the theory of rel-
ativity.
We now introduce a symmetric tensor of rank 2, with
components θµν, representing the mass/energy and mo-
tion of a ﬂuid. These components are deﬁned by
θµν ≡ρ uµuν.
This expression represents the components of the so-
called kinetic energy-momentum tensor.
The four-
velocity components of a slowly moving ﬂuid is given in
Eq. (10.24).
For such a ﬂuid the kinetic energy-

(10.26)
Before we can deﬁne a total energy-momentum den-
sity tensor, we must generalize the three-space stress ten-
sor tij to a corresponding spacetime tensor Sµν. This ten-
sor is deﬁned by demanding that its only non-vanishing
components in a local rest frame of the ﬂuid are equal to
the components of the ‘Newtonian’ stress tensor tij. The
components of the tensor Sµν in an arbitrary inertial ref-
erence frame are then calculated by Lorentz transforming
the tensor components from the rest-frame to the arbi-
trary frame. However, we shall not need to write down
these expressions.
The total-energy momentum density tensor (later called
‘the energy-momentum tensor’) is deﬁned by
T µν ≡θµν + Sµν.
Inserting the components of Sµν from the ‘rest frame val-
ues’ in Eq. (10.10), and the components of θµν from
Eq. (10.26), we get the components for the energy-
momentum tensor for the case of a perfect ﬂuid moving
slowly in a (four-dimensional) Cartesian coordinate sys-

Mathematical formulation of
the basic conservation laws
We shall now study the divergence, interpreted physi-
cally, of the ‘Newtonian’ energy-momentum tensor of a
perfect ﬂuid given in Eq. (10.27). Then we shall be able
to understand the physical meaning of stating that this
divergence vanishes.
In the present application we let T µν be decomposed
in a locally Cartesian coordinate system comoving with
an inertial reference frame. Then the covariant deriva-
tives are reduced to ordinary partial derivatives, and the
time component of T µν;ν is
T 4ν

This is just the equation of mass conservation in hydro-
dynamics, Eq. (10.9). In view of the ‘equivalence’ of the
measurable quantities mass and energy, represented by
Einstein’s famous equation E = m c2, this can also be in-
terpreted as an expression of the law of energy-
conservation.
The signiﬁcance of E = m c2 as representing a unifying
concept of fundamental importance in physics should be
emphasized. In classical Newtonian mechanics there are

10.10
The basic conservation laws
409
four basic conservation laws; conservation of mass, en-
ergy, momentum and angular momentum. The mass of
a body is the quantity m that appears both in Newton’s
second law and in Newton’s law of gravitation. Energy
appears in different forms, for example kinetic energy re-
lated to the motion of a body, and potential energy re-
lated to the position of a body in a force ﬁeld. Momen-
tum is mass times velocity, and angular momentum is
a rotational analogue of momentum, in which mass far
from the axis of rotation contributes mostly. Its conserva-
tion is made visible when a ﬁgure skater draws her arms
towards her body and thereby increases her angular ve-
locity in a pirouette.
In 1918 Emmy Noether proved the remarkable fact
that conservation of energy, momentum and angular mo-
mentum are consequences of a more basic requirement.
The laws of physics should be completely independent
of the location of an experiment in space and time, and
of the orientation of the experimental arrangement. Ex-
pressed more technically: three of the four basic conser-
vation of Newtonian mechanics are consequences of the
requirement that the laws of nature should be invariant
against translations in space, and in time, and under rota-
tions in space. Such invariance properties are often called
symmetries in physics. In other words, three of the four
basic conservation laws of Newtonian physics follows
from symmetries of space and time.
Conservation of

mass is usually postulated separately (although it can
also be considered as implicit in the law of conservation
of momentum).
We now proceed to investigate the spatial components

form
T iν

We shall now show more explicitly the relation of this
equation to Newton’s second law, which says that mass
times acceleration is equal to the sum of the forces. Thus,
we must rewrite Eq. (10.31) so that the left-hand side is
replaced by ‘mass times acceleration’. In order to do this,

with the acceleration of gravity here. Fortunately, the rea-
son for this discrepancy is simple to ﬁnd, and simple to
‘repair’. The effect of gravity has not been included in the
present section because we decided to simplify the equa-
tions by decomposing the tensors and vectors in a Carte-
sian coordinate system comoving with an inertial refer-
ence frame. This made it possible to replace covariant dif-
ferentiation by ordinary partial differentiation. This was
sufﬁcient for the present purposes; namely to formulate
the Newtonian laws of hydrodynamics in a way that may
be generalized, to include the effects of arbitrarily strong
gravitational ﬁelds and relativistic velocities. Such gener-
alization may be obtained by the receipt: replace ordinary
partial derivatives by covariant derivatives!
Later we shall see that certain Christoffel symbols that
automatically appear when we use covariant derivatives
represent, in a uniﬁed way, inertial forces experienced in
an accelerated reference frame, and gravitational forces
due to mass concentrations.
We have now seen: In spacetime T µν;ν = 0 represents
four equations. The time component is the equation of
continuity, representing the law of conservation of mass,

10.11
Relativistic energy-momentum of a perfect ﬂuid
413
or energy. The three spatial components represent the
law of conservation of momentum.
Together with the
equation of mass conservation this leads to the equation
of motion of a ﬂuid element. Thus, the basic conserva-
tion laws of hydrodynamics, and the equation of motion
of ﬂuids, are all contained in the physical interpretation
of the covariant equations T µν;ν = 0.
10.11
Relativistic energy-momentum
of a perfect ﬂuid
The expression (10.27) for the components of the energy-
momentum tensor of a perfect ﬂuid moving slowly in a
Cartesian coordinate system shall now be generalized to
a relativistically valid expression. We must then replace
the components vi of the ordinary velocity by the compo-
nents uµ of the four velocity of the ﬂuid elements. Note
also that δij are the components of the metric tensor in the
Cartesian coordinate system. This must be replaced by
the components gµν of the metric in an arbitrary coordi-
nate system in spacetime. The relativistic generalization
of the expression for T ij in Eq. (10.27) therefore seems to
be
¯T µν = ρuµuν + pgµν.
(10.34)
In a local inertial rest frame of the ﬂuid at an arbitrary
point in spacetime the values of the components of the

10.11
Relativistic energy-momentum of a perfect ﬂuid
414
energy-momentum tensor are found by inserting vi = 0
in Eq. (10.27). Denoting the rest frame values by marked
indices, we get
T i′j′ = p δi′j′,
T i′4′ = 0,
and
T 4′4′ = ρc2.
However,
calculating
the
rest
frame
values
from
Eq. (10.34) by inserting uµ′ = (c, 0, 0, 0), gi′j′ = δi′j′, gi′4′ =
0, and g4′4′ = −1, we get
¯T i′j′ = p δi′j′,
¯T i′4′ = 0,
and
¯T 4′4′ = ρc2 −p.
Due to the wrong value of ¯T 4′4′ Eq. (10.34) cannot be the
correct expression for the energy-momentum tensor. We
must add a term that contributes with p to T 4′4′, but does
not contribute to the components T i′j′ and T i′4′ . The sim-
plest such term is (p/c2) uµuν.
Adding this term to
Eq. (10.34) we obtain an expression which we can use to
deﬁne the components of the relativistic energy-momen-
tum tensor of a perfect ﬂuid,
T µν ≡
 ρ + p/c2
uµuν + p gµν.
(10.35)
We see from this expression that the energy-momentum
tensor is symmetric, T νµ = T µν.

Chapter 11
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations
11.1
A new conception of gravitation
According to Einstein’s theory of gravitation there is no
gravitational ﬁeld of forces. The notion of a gravitational
ﬁeld of force is replaced by that of curved spacetime.
Because no force is needed, the theory is often said
to be purely geometric. Einstein is said to have ‘geom-
etrized’ gravitation.
This is somewhat misleading be-
cause his theory is one of physics making use of empir-
ically vulnerable terms.
In geometry, understood as a
mathematical, not a physical science, there is no empir-
ical vulnerability. We would like, instead, to say that Ein-
stein’s theory of gravitation is purely ‘kinematical’, i.e.
purely movement oriented, emphasizing the absence of
any gravitational force in this theory. Matter moves ac-
415

11.1
A new conception of gravitation
416
cording to the curvature of space and space is curved by
matter.
The great relativist J. A. Wheeler formulated the apho-
rism: “matter tells space how to curve, and space tells
matter how to move”.
The mathematical expressions of this are Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations and the geodesic equation. They replace
Newton’s gravitational law that ‘tells’ how matter creates
a gravitational ﬁeld of force, and Newton’s second law,
that ‘tells’ how a particle responds to this ﬁeld. The fa-
mous slogan of Wheeler is, as most slogans, likely to be
misunderstood; the ‘telling’ demands no force. To certain
physical properties in a region there correspond certain ge-
ometrical properties of spacetime. A logical relation of
correspondence!
In order to avoid thinking in terms of force and inﬂu-
ence, we may propose the following alternative to
Wheeler’s slogan: with mass space is curved, and so are
the paths of the mass.
It is difﬁcult to avoid the concept of ‘force’ when we
talk about gravitational phenomena. For example, people
often say that mass causes spacetime curvature, and that
this curvature causes the path of a free particle to deviate
from a straight line in ordinary three-dimensional space.
According to Newtonian gravitational theory there are
causal relationships involving forces. General relativity
is nevertheless, a causal theory of gravitation and space-

11.1
A new conception of gravitation
417
time. But it is free of forces. The causal character of the
theory is related to the mathematical expression of the
theory. In the weak ﬁeld approximation general relativ-
ity is similar to Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory. If the
Sun changes its shape, for example, it emits gravitational
waves moving with the velocity of light. Still, as far as
gravitation is concerned, Einstein’s God does no push-
ing; everything ﬂows freely. Gravitation is of a kinemati-
cal character, it is not an interacting force.
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations relate spacetime curvature
to matter and radiation, which is characterized by an
energy-momentum tensor. As noted in section 10.11, it is
a symmetric tensor of rank 2. The ﬁeld equations of Ein-
stein say that a certain curvature tensor of spacetime is
proportional to the energy-momentum tensor of the mat-
ter and energy that is present. Like the energy-momen-
tum tensor this curvature tensor must be a symmetric
tensor of rank 2, since two tensors that are proportional
to each other must be of the same rank and have the same
symmetries.
Since the Riemann curvature tensor is of rank 4, Ein-
stein had to ﬁnd a different curvature tensor for the left-
hand side of his ﬁeld equations.
One may perhaps wonder:
Why not construct an
energy-momentum tensor of rank 4? Then the ﬁeld equa-
tions could have the form: ‘The Riemann curvature ten-
sor is proportional to the energy-momentum tensor’. The

11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
418
reason that Einstein did not follow this route is that it
would not make physical sense. A simple illustration may
be useful. Temperature is a quantity that may be speci-
ﬁed by means of just one number (and an expression of a
unit, for example ‘degree Celsius’). So it does not make
much sense to introduce for example two numbers, say
a temperature vector with two components. In a similar
way there are enough components in a symmetric ten-
sor of rank 2 to specify all the kinematical and dynamical
properties of matter. Introducing an energy-momentum
tensor of rank 4 would only make sense if all geometrical
properties of a curved space corresponded to the physi-
cal properties of matter. So far our observations make us
believe that this is not the case.
11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
There is a way to construct a tensor of rank 2 from one of
rank 4, or more generally, a tensor of rank n −2 from one
of rank n. The procedure is called contraction. Consider,
as an example a tensor S of rank 2. The contravariant
components are Sµν. Contraction is deﬁned by the fol-
lowing operations. One index is lowered and then made
equal to an upper index. The two equal indices are then
regarded as summation indices, by an extension of Ein-
stein’s summation convention, and the indicated summa-
tion is performed. Therefore, the contraction tensor of

11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
419
the energy-momentum tensor, which is of rank 2 and has
components T µν, is the scalar quantity (that is tensor of
rank 0)
T ≡T µ
µ = T 1
1 + T 2
2 + T 3
3 + T 4
4.
(11.1)
Another example, which will be used below, is the
contraction of the metric tensor. We start with the compo-
nents gµν. Lowering the last index (see Eq. (5.74)) gives
gµαgνα = δµν, where δµν is the Kronecker symbol. We put
µ equal to ν and thereby reduce information. Then we
summarize and get:
δν
ν = δ1
1 + δ2
2 + δ3
3 + δ4
4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.
(11.2)
Thus the contraction of the metrical tensor is just the
number 4. The only information left is the number of di-
mensions. If other tensors of rank 2 are contracted, we
do not in general obtain merely a deﬁnite number, but a
scalar function, such as the scalar T in Eq. (11.1).
We are searching for a curvature tensor of rank 2 by
contracting our wellknown Riemann curvature tensor of
rank 4. We start with the mixed components Rµναβ. This
tensor has three lower indices. Does this mean that we
can obtain three different contracted curvature tensors,
depending upon which lower index we put equal to µ?
On the next two pages we shall show that the Rie-
mann tensor possesses certain symmetries that make the
contraction of the Riemann tensor a curvature tensor of
rank 2 unique, and reduce the number of independent

11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
420
components of the Riemann tensor in four-dimensional
spacetime from 256 to 20. This is of great signiﬁcance as
to the possibility of obtaining a useful geometrical theory
of space, time and gravitation. Therefore we ﬁnd it jus-
tiﬁable to make the reader completely competent to un-
derstand the mathematical basis of these symmetries.
We now write the components of the curvature ten-
sor with reference to a local Cartesian coordinate system
(Sect. 8.5). In such a coordinate system the Christoffel
symbols vanish.
Then the terms with products of
Christoffel symbols in Eq. (9.29) vanish, and the expres-
sion for the components of Riemann’s curvature tensor is
reduced to (where we have exchanged the indices µ and
ν in Eq. (9.29))
Rµ
ναβ = Γ µ
νβ,α −Γ µ
να,β.
(11.3)
From this equation we get
Rµ
νβα = Γ µ
να,β −Γ µ
νβ,α
= −(Γ µ
νβ,α −Γ µ
να,β) = −Rµ
ναβ.
(11.4)
The Riemann curvature tensor is antisymmetric in its last
two indices. Since the symmetries of a tensor are inde-
pendent of the coordinate system, this result is valid in
general.
Lowering the index µ in each term of Eq. (11.3) we get
Rµναβ = Γµνβ,α −Γµνα,β.
(11.5)

11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
421
From this equation we can deduce a symmetry relation
fulﬁlled by the Riemann tensor, as follows
Rµναβ + Rµβνα + Rµαβν = Γµνβ,α −Γµνα,β + Γµβα,ν −Γµβν,α
+ Γµαν,β −Γµαβ,ν.
We now apply the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols,
Γµαβ = Γµβα, and exchange the succession of the terms
Rµναβ + Rµβνα + Rµαβν = Γµνβ,α −Γµνβ,α + Γµβα,ν −Γµβα,ν
+ Γµνα,β −Γµνα,β.
All the terms cancel each other. Consequently
Rµναβ + Rµβνα + Rµαβν = 0.
(11.6)
This is the second symmetry relation fulﬁlled by the Rie-
mann tensor.
According to Eq. (7.31) the Christoffel symbols of the
ﬁrst kind are given by
Γµνα = 1
2 (gµν,α + gµα,ν −gνα,µ) .
(11.7)
We are now going to insert this expression into Eq. (11.5).
Since the derivatives of the Christoffel symbols, contain-
ing ﬁrst derivatives of the metric, are present in Eq. (11.5),
we shall get second derivatives of the metric in the ex-
pression of the curvature. This may not be too surpris-
ing, if we recall from section 2.3 that the curvature of a

11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
422
graph of a function, y = f(x), is proportional to the sec-
ond derivative of the function.
The following notation shall be used for the second
derivatives of the tensor components gµν
gµν,βα ≡(gµν,β),α .
Consider the ﬁrst term at the right-hand side of Eq. (11.5),
Γµνβ,α. Here we shall differentiate the Christoffel symbol
given by Eq. (11.7), but with α replaced by β. Then we
get
Γµνβ,α = 1
2 (gµν,β + gµβ,ν −gνβ,µ),α
= 1
2 (gµν,βα + gµβ,να −gνβ,µα) .
(11.8)
In the same way, only exchanging α and β,
Γµνα,β = 1
2 (gµν,αβ + gµα,νβ −gνα,µβ) .
(11.9)
Subtracting Eq. (11.9) from Eq. (11.8) and using Eq. (11.5),
we ﬁnd
Rµναβ = 1
2 (gµν,βα + gµβ,να −gνβ,µα −gµν,αβ
−gµα,νβ + gνα,µβ) . (11.10)
Since the succession of differentiation of two consecutive
partial differentiations does not inﬂuence the result,

11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
423
gµν,αβ = gµν,βα. Therefore the ﬁrst and the fourth terms
at the right-hand side of Eq. (11.10) cancel each other, and
we are left with the expression (valid in a local Cartesian
coordinate system)
Rµναβ = 1
2 (gµβ,να −gνβ,µα −gµα,νβ + gνα,µβ) .
(11.11)
Exchanging the indices µ and ν in the expression inside
the parenthesis leads to a change of sign, i.e.
gµβ,να −gνβ,µα = −(gνβ,µα −gµβ,να)
and
−gµα,νβ + gνα,µβ = −(−gνα,µβ + gµα,νβ) .
Thus, we get
Rνµαβ = −Rµναβ
(11.12)
which shows that the Riemann curvature tensor is anti-
symmetric in its ﬁrst two indices, too.
The fourth and last symmetry of the Riemann cur-
vature tensor is also found from the expression (11.11).
We start by writing this expression, exchanging the index
pairs µν and αβ
Rαβµν = 1
2 (gαν,βµ −gβν,αµ −gαµ,βν + gβµ,αν) .
Exchanging the ﬁrst and the last term in the parenthesis,
and using the symmetry of the metric tensor and that the

11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
424
successsion of the partial derivatives doesn’t matter, so
that, for example, gβµ,αν = gµβ,να, we get
Rαβµν = 1
2 (gµβ,να −gνβ,µα −gµα,νβ + gνα,µβ)
which is just the expression (11.11). This shows that the
Riemann curvature tensor has the symmetry
Rµναβ = Rαβµν.
(11.13)
The four symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor,
Eqs. (11.4), (11.6), (11.12) and (11.13), reduce the number
of independent components of the Riemann tensor in a
four-dimensional spacetime from 44 = 256 to 20, which
is of decisive importance for the construction of a curva-
ture tensor which can be used in Einstein’s ﬁeld equa-
tions, because it reduces drastically the number of equa-
tions needed.
As noted above we need to ﬁnd a symmetric curva-
ture tensor of rank 2. In order to construct such a ten-
sor, we calculate the contraction of the Riemann curva-
ture tensor. Since the components of this tensor can be
written with one superscript and three subscripts, there
exist three possible contractions of the Riemann curva-
ture tensor. Let us consider all three possibilities.
We ﬁrst put ν=µ, in Rµναβ and get
Rµ
µαβ = gµνRνµαβ = −gµνRµναβ = −gνµRµναβ
= −gµνRνµαβ = −Rµ
µαβ.
(11.14)

11.2
The Ricci curvature tensor
425
Here we ﬁrst used the rule (5.77) for raising an index,
then we used Eq. (11.13), then the symmetry of the metric
tensor, and then the freedom to change the name of sum-
mation indices. In the present case we have let µ →ν
and ν →µ. Equation (11.14) implies that Rµµαβ = 0, since
if something positive is equal to something negative this
‘something’ must be zero.
Next we contract α with µ. Using Eq. (11.3) we get
Rµ
νβµ = −Rµ
νµβ
which shows that the tensor obtained by contraction of β
with µ is the negative of the tensor obtained by contract-
ing α with µ.
We had three possibilities. Contraction with the ﬁrst
subscript gave zero, and contraction with the third sub-
script gave the same quantity, but with opposite sign, as
contraction with the second subscript. Therefore we get
essentially only one tensor of rank 2 by contraction of the
Riemann curvature tensor. The contracted tensor is called
the Ricci curvature tensor. Its components Rµν are deﬁned
by
Rµν ≡Rα
µαν,
(11.15)
where we have chosen to rename the indices, with µ and
ν as free indices, and α as summation index. From the
symmetry (11.13) follows that the Ricci tensor is symmet-
ric,
Rµν = Rνµ.
(11.16)

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
426
Perhaps the Ricci curvature tensor is the one we ul-
timately are looking for? Does it make sense to postu-
late that it is proportional to the energy-momentum ten-
sor Tµν? It is natural to try it out since it is a symmet-
ric tensor of rank 2. And Einstein actually proposed it,
writing down ﬁeld equations that seemingly appeared
unique and extremely simple, namely
Rµν = κ Tµν,
where κ is a constant. But for reasons that will be ap-
parent below, he gave it up and ended with a somewhat
different tensor.
11.3
The Bianchi identity, conserva-
tion of energy, and Einstein’s
tensor
According to the fundamental laws of dynamics, thermo-
dynamics and electromagnetism the amount of energy
and momentum (mass times velocity) do not change for
an isolated system. This is often expressed by saying that
energy and momentum are conserved quantities.
Einstein demanded from his general theory of relativ-
ity that energy and momentum conservation should fol-
low from the ﬁeld equations.
As we have seen in

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
427
Sect. 10.10, energy and momentum conservation is ex-
pressed by vanishing divergence of the energy-momen-
tum tensor. In order that this shall be a consequence of
the ﬁeld equations the curvature tensor must have van-
ishing divergence, which should be a purely geometric
property of the curvature tensor, not the result of any-
thing physical.
We shall now calculate the divergence of the Ricci cur-
vature tensor, and see if it vanishes. This is most easily
done by means of a geometric relation, unknown to the
young Einstein, called the Bianchi identity.
The deduction of the Bianchi identity is greatly sim-
pliﬁed by use of locally Cartesian coordinates. Then the
components
of
the
Riemann
tensor
are
given
by
Eq. (11.3).
By partial differentiation of each term of
Eq. (11.3) with respect to a coordinate xγ, we get
Rµ
ναβ,γ = Γ µ
νβ,αγ −Γ µ
να,βγ.
(11.17)
Replacing α by γ, β by α, and γ by β leads to
Rµ
νγα,β = Γ µ
να,γβ −Γ µ
νγ,αβ.
(11.18)
Similarly, replacing γ by β, α by γ, and β by α results in
Rµ
νβγ,α = Γ µ
νγ,βα −Γ µ
νβ,γα.
(11.19)
Let us inspect the sum of Eqs. (11.17)–(11.19). In the
ﬁrst term of Eq. (11.17) and the last term of Eq. (11.19) the

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
428
succession of differentiation is different, but this does not
inﬂuence the result. Accordingly, these two terms cancel
each other when Eqs. (11.17)–(11.19) are added. The same
applies to term number two of Eq. (11.17) and term num-
ber one of Eq. (11.18), and to term two of Eq. (11.18) and
term one of Eq. (11.19). Hence
Rµ
ναβ,γ + Rµ
νγα,β + Rµ
νβγ,α = 0.
(11.20)
Due to the presence of the partial derivatives this is
not a tensor equation. It is valid only in a locally Carte-
sian coordinate system.
However, the corresponding
generally covariant tensor equation is obtained simply by
replacing the partial derivatives with covariant deriva-
tives. That this is a valid generalization of Eq. (11.20)
follows from the fact that if a tensor expression vanishes
in one particular coordinate system, then it vanishes in
all other coordinate systems. The ﬁnal relation is accord-
ingly
Rµ
ναβ;γ + Rµ
νγα;β + Rµ
νβγ;α = 0.
(11.21)
This is the famous Bianchi identity.
It is possible to give a geometrical interpretation of the
Bianchi identity. In order to arrive at such an interpreta-
tion we shall need a two-pages deduction. The geomet-
rical contents of the Bianchi identity will thereby become
apparent.

429
Figure 11.1: A cube

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
430
Let us introduce a local Cartesian coordinate system.
Consider a coordinate cube as shown in Fig. 11.1.
Imagine that a vector ⃗A is parallel transported around
the front side with normal vector ⃗ex. This side is at x +
∆x. Since the basis vectors of the locally Cartesian co-
ordinates are constant in the indeﬁnitely small region of
the cube (because of vanishing Christoffel symbols, see
Sect. 8.5), the change of the vector ⃗A due to this parallel
transport is given by the change of the vector components
(see Eq. (9.30)),
(∆Aµ)x+∆x = Rµ
νyz(x + ∆x, y, z) Aν ∆y ∆z.
Parallel transport of ⃗A around the opposite surface gives
a similar contribution, except that now the sign is
reversed and the evaluation takes place at x rather than
at x + ∆x,
(∆Aµ)x = −Rµ
νyz(x, y, z) Aν ∆y ∆x.
The sum of the contributions from parallel transport of ⃗A
around these two surfaces gives, in the case of a vanish-

where ∆V ≡∆x ∆y ∆z is the volume of the coordinate
cube. The change of the vector ⃗A when it is parallel trans-
ported around all six boundary surfaces of the cube is
∆Aµ =

or, making use of Einstein’s comma notation for partial
derivatives,
∆Aµ = (Rµ
νyz,x + Rµ
νzx,y + Rµ
νxy,z) Aν ∆V.
(11.22)
In order to ﬁnd the value of this change of the vec-
tor ⃗A we shall use a geometrical argument. Consider the
shaded part S of the spherical surface in Fig. 11.2.
The circle L is the boundary of the surface S. Let L
move towards the ‘south pole’ of the sphere. Then S ap-
proaches the whole spherical surface, and the length of
the boundary L approaches zero. In the limit that the sur-
face S is closed, it bounds the volume of a sphere. Let

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
432
Figure 11.2: A surface S with boundary L

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
433
us recapitulate: The boundary of a closed surface is zero,
and a closed surface is the boundary of a volume. Thus,
in Wheeler’s words “the boundary of a boundary is zero”.
Consider now our cubical coordinate volume.
The
edges along which the vector ⃗A is parallel transported,
are parts of the boundary of the surfaces bounding the
cube. When ⃗A is parallel transported around all the six
surfaces of the cube all the edges are traversed twice, once
in each direction, as indicated on three of the surfaces
in Fig. 11.1. These displacements have signs depending
upon the direction in which an edge is traversed, so all
the dispacements add up to zero.
The boundary (the
edges with signs bounding all the surfaces) of a bound-
ary (the surfaces bounding the cube) is zero. This implies
that there will be no change at all of the vector ⃗A when
it is parallel transported though the boundaries of all six
surfaces, traversing each edge twice, once in each direc-
tion. Accordingly
∆Aµ = 0.
The vector ⃗A is presupposed to be different from zero.
Therefore at least one of the components Aν in Eq. (11.22)
are different from zero. Also the volume ∆V is different
from zero. Therefore, the quantity inside the parenthesis
must be equal to zero, which is just Eq. (11.20). Trans-
forming to a covariant equation valid in an arbitrary coor-
dinate system by replacing partial derivatives (commas)
by covariant derivatives (semicolons), we arrive at the

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
434
Bianchi identity, Eq. (11.21). We have thereby arrived at
a geometrical interpretation of the Bianchi identity: It ex-
presses that the boundary of a boundary is zero, as we saw
above in the case of a sphere and a cube.
As mentioned above the conservation laws of energy
and momentum are represented mathematically by
putting the divergence of the (symmetrical) energy-
momentum tensor (of rank 2) equal to zero. For this rea-
son Einstein searched for a symmetrical curvature tensor
of rank 2 with vanishing divergence. The Ricci tensor is a
symmetrical curvature tensor of rank 2. But has it a van-
ishing divergence?
Applying the Bianchi identity we shall ﬁnd an unam-
biguous answer to this question. Inserting α = µ in the
ﬁrst term of the Bianchi identity, we get
Rµ
νµβ;γ = Rνβ;γ.
This is the covariant derivative of the Ricci tensor. Con-
tracting ν with γ we get Rγβ;γ. This is the covariant diver-
gence of the Ricci tensor.
From this it is seen that the value of the divergence of
the Ricci tensor can be calculated by ﬁrst contracting α
with µ in the Bianchi identity, and then ν with γ in the
resulting equation. Let us go to the task.
As we saw above, if we put α = µ in the Bianchi iden-

tensor. In the second term we apply the relations
Rµ
νγµ = −Rµ
νµγ = −Rνγ.
The second term in the Bianchi identity is thereby
changed to Rνγ;β.
We then get what is called the con-
tracted Bianchi identity,
Rνβ;γ −Rνγ;β + Rµ
νβγ;µ = 0.
Contracting β with ν, i.e. raising the index β and putting
β = µ, gives
R;γ −Rν
γ;ν + Rµν
νγ;µ = 0,
(11.23)
here we have deﬁned
R ≡Rν
ν.
(11.24)
The quantity R is a curvature scalar, i.e. a tensor of rank
0. Since it is a contraction of the Ricci curvature tensor, it
is called the Ricci curvature scalar.
The second term of Eq. (11.23) is the divergence of the
Ricci tensor. As regards the third term we note that the
Riemann tensor is antisymmetric in its ﬁrst two indices.
Consequently we have
Rµν
νγ;µ = −Rνµ
νγ;µ = −Rµ
γ;µ = −Rν
γ;ν,
where we have replaced the summation index µ by ν in
order that the second and the third terms in Eq. (11.23)

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor

shall look similar. Substituting −Rνγ;ν for Rµννγ;µ in the
third term of Eq. (11.23) results in
R;γ −Rν
γ;µ −Rν
γ;µ = 0.
Therefore
R;γ = 2 Rµ
γ;µ
or
Rµ
γ;µ = 1
2 R;γ.
(11.25)
We have now calculated the divergence of the Ricci
tensor. It is equal to the covariant derivative of the Ricci
curvature scalar. This vanishes only if the curvature sca-
lar is constant. And even if this sometimes is the case
(we shall later see that the Ricci curvature scalar is equal
to zero everywhere in a region with vanishing energy-
momentum tensor), this curvature scalar is not always
constant,
which means that the right-hand side of
Eq. (11.25) is not equal to zero.
Thus, the Ricci tensor is not divergence free. So the
Ricci tensor was not the answer to Einstein’s search for
a divergence-free curvature tensor of rank 2. However,
Eq. (11.25) is of decisive importance as a starting point
for the very last steps towards Einstein’s ﬁeld equations.
In order to write R;γ as the divergence of a tensor of
rank 2, we use a trick. We multiply R with a constant ten-
sor of rank 2, namely the Kronecker symbol, and take the

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
437
divergence of the resulting tensor,
(δµ
γ R);µ = (δµ
γ);µ R + δµ
γ R;µ = 0 · R + R;γ = R;γ.
Inserting this into Eq. (11.25) gives
(δµ
γ R);µ −2 Rµ
γ;µ = (δµ
γ R −2 Rµ
γ);µ = 0.
Multiplying by −1/2 we get

Rµ
γ −1
2 δµ
γ R

;µ
= 0.
At last we have found a symmetric curvature tensor of
rank 2,
Eµ
γ ≡Rµ
γ −1
2 δµ
γ R,
(11.26)
which is divergence free,
Eµ
γ;µ = 0.
(11.27)
The vanishing divergence of this tensor is a geometric un-
changeable property which comes from the theorem that
‘the boundary of a boundary is zero’. The tensor with
mixed components Eµγ is named Einstein’s curvature ten-
sor. In four-dimensional spacetime Eq. (11.27) represents
four identities, one for each value of the index γ, which
the Einstein tensor fulﬁls.
The mathematical deductions have now been com-
pleted. The Einstein tensor is the adequate answer to the

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
438
mathematical problem Einstein wrestled with for more
than three years: which curvature tensor, if any, might be
proportional to the energy-momentum tensor?
Having reached this solution late in the Autumn of
1915, Einstein promptly put his divergence free curvature
tensor proportional to the energy momentum tensor, and
thereby obtained the gravitational ﬁeld equations of the
general theory of relativity. Einstein’s ﬁeld equations are
Eµ
ν = κ T µ
ν
(11.28)
where the proportionality constant κ is related to New-
ton’s constant of gravitation (see Ch. 12).
The Einstein tensor is a symmetrical tensor of rank 2.
In four-dimensional spacetime a tensor of rank 2 has six-
teen components, which is often written as a 4×4 matrix.
Due to the symmetry of the tensor, the components on
each side of the diagonal are equal, leaving ten compo-
nents that are not necessarily equal (just like the metric
tensor). One might think, therefore, that Eq. (11.28) rep-
resents ten independent ﬁeld equations. This is, however,
not the case due to the four identities (11.27) that the Ein-
stein tensor fulﬁls. Thus, there are only six independent
ﬁeld equations. These six second order partial differen-
tial equations are used to determine the components of
the metrical tensor. However, they can determine only
six of the ten independent components, leaving four of
them free. This freedom, Einstein noted, is of decisive

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
439
importance. As we saw in Ch. 5, the components of the
metric tensor depends upon the choice of coordinate sys-
tem. In ﬂat spacetime, for example, the metric is different
in a Cartesian coordinate system and a spherical coordi-
nate system. The freedom to choose a suitable coordinate
system requires that four of the components of the met-
ric tensor are not determined by the ﬁeld equations. And
this was just what Einstein found: only four of the ten
ﬁeld equations are independent due to the four identities
(11.27) fulﬁlled by all Einstein tensors, independent of the
geometrical properties of the spacetime they represent.
Inserting the expression (11.26) for the mixed compo-
nents of the Einstein tensor, the ﬁeld equations take the
form
Rµ
ν −1
2 δµ
ν R = κ T µ
ν.
(11.29)
Lowering the index µ in Eq. (11.29), and using that the
Kronecker symbols with one superscript and one sub-
script, are the mixed components of the metric tensor (see
Eq. (5.79)), we get a much used form of Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations
Rµν −1
2 gµν R = κ Tµν.
(11.30)
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations may also be expressed in terms
of the contravariant tensor components
Rµν −1
2 gµνR = κ T µν.
(11.31)

11.3
The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
440
This form of the ﬁeld equations will be used in Ch. 12.
The ﬁeld equations, together with the geodesic equa-
tion, Eq. (8.7), are the fundamental equations of the the-
ory of relativity.
In Eq. (11.30) the left-hand side rep-
resents curvature, and the right-hand side kinematical
and dynamical properties of matter. The ﬁeld equations
are the mathematical expression of “mass is and space
curves”, and the geodesic equation expresses “space
curves and mass moves with it”.
In the next chapter we need to write Eq. (11.30) in a
different way. Contraction of this equation and use of
Eqs. (11.30) and (11.24) gives
R −1
2 4 R = κ T,
(11.32)
where
T ≡T ν
ν = T 1
1 + T 2
2 + T 3
3 + T 4
4.
Equation (11.32) can be written as
R = −κ T.
(11.33)
Inserting Eq. (11.33) into Eq. (11.30) we ﬁnd
Rµν + 1
2 gµν κ T = κ Tµν
or
Rµν = κ

.
(11.34)

The Bianchi identity and Einstein’s tensor
441
One interesting property of so-called ‘empty space-
time’ may be noted immediately. Since empty space has
vanishing energy-momentum tensor, the right-hand side
of Eq. (11.34) is zero in such a region. This means that the
Ricci tensor vanishes in empty spacetime. In other words
the ﬁeld equations of empty spacetime are
Rµν = 0.
(11.35)
It follows immediately that also the Ricci curvature scalar
vanishes in empty spacetime. This does not mean, how-
ever, that space is ﬂat in empty spacetime. The curva-
ture of spacetime is represented by the Riemann tensor
of spacetime, not the Ricci tensor.

Chapter 12
Einstein’s theory of space-
time and gravitation
We have now completed our intended introduction to the
mathematics used in the general theory of relativity. It re-
mains to explain the central physical contents of the the-
ory. Let us ﬁrst offer a brief summary of the fundamental
concept of Newton’s theory of gravitation.
12.1
Newtonian kinematics
Particles move in a three-dimensional Euclidean space.
Position vectors with ﬁnite length can be placed any-
where in this space. The position of a particle can be mea-
sured with respect to an arbitrarily chosen point of refer-
ence. Also time is universal and absolute. In particular
442

12.1
Newtonian kinematics
443
it is possible for all observers to agree as to which events
are simultaneous.
The velocity of a particle is the derivative of its posi-
tion vector with respect to time
⃗v = d⃗r
dt.
The velocity describes how fast and in which direction a
particle moves, relative to a given reference point, which
may be the position of an observer.
Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with re-
spect to time
⃗a = d⃗v
dt.
The acceleration describes how fast the velocity changes,
not only in magnitude (speed), but also in direction.
Consider a body that moves along a circular path, for
example the Moon as it moves around the Earth. Since
the direction of the velocity changes all the time, the mo-
tion is accelerated all the time, even if the speed is con-
stant.
In Fig. 12.1 ∆⃗v is the change of velocity from P1 to P2.
The acceleration of the body is
⃗a = d⃗v
dt = lim
∆t→0
∆⃗v
∆t = lim
∆t→0
⃗v2 −⃗v1

.
From this expression and Fig. 12.1 it is seen that when

12.2
Forces
444
Figure 12.1: Worldline of an accelerating body
∆t →0, the acceleration is directed towards the centre of
the circular path.
12.2
Forces
Isaac Newton (1642–1726) proposed that no force is nec-
essary in order to keep a body moving. If a body stops
moving when it is left to itself, it is because it meets fric-
tion. One is usually not able to remove completely the
force of friction. A body is perhaps never quite ‘left to
itself’!
One speaks of a force when a body acts on another so
that it is either deformed or its velocity changes. Today
we recognize four fundamental forces in this sense.
1. The electromagnetic force
This is a force that acts between electrically charged
bodies. Also if two electrically neutral objects, with
inhomogeneous charge distributions, for example

12.2
Forces
445
two atoms, are near each other, they can act on each
other by means of electromagnetic forces. Molecu-
lar bonds, for example, are due to such forces. Fric-
tion forces are also of electromagnetic nature.
2. The gravitational force
Figure 12.2: Earth and trajectories of falling objects
This force acts between all masses. The gravitation-
al force is always attractive (see Fig. 12.2). The rea-

12.2
Forces
446
son that the Moon does not move along a straight
path, but along a circle with an acceleration directed
towards the centre of the circle (the Earth), is that
the Earth acts upon the Moon with a gravitational
force (see Fig. 12.2).
3. The weak nuclear force
This is a force which is responsible for a certain ra-
dioactive emission from atomic nuclei. Its range is
extremely small, shorter than the radius of a neu-
tron.
4. The so-called ‘colour force’
The name ‘colour force’ is fanciful. The word ‘col-
our’ has here nothing to do with human percep-
tions. It is used as designation for a new kind of
charge, called ‘colour-charge’. Particles with colour-
charge act on each other with a very strong force
called ‘colour force’. Each proton and neutron con-
sist of three ‘quarks’ (named so by the american
physicist Murray Gellmann, after a line, ‘three
quarks for Muster Mark’ in James Joyce’s Finnegan’s
Wake).
The quarks have colour charge.
It is the
colour force that binds them together in the protons
and the neutrons.
The range of this force is very small, about the ra-
dius of an atomic nucleus. The protons and neu-

12.2
Forces
447
trons are colour-neutral.
Yet, the strong nuclear
force, which binds protons and neutrons together
in atomic nuclei, are due to the colour force, in a
similar manner that forces between electrically neu-
tral atoms, which make up molecules, are due to the
electric force.
For systems as small as atomic nuclei, ordinary New-
tonian theory of force does not apply. One has to use
quantum mechanics. All forces of ordinary experience
such as friction, pressure, the forces in a rope, the force
that makes things fall etc. are due to either the electro-
magnetic or the gravitational force. They are the only
long-range forces.
12.2.1
Newton’s three laws
The fundamental laws of classical mechanics, his doctrine
about forces, was formulated by Newton as follows.
Newton’s ﬁrst law:
A body which is not acted upon by
any forces (or by forces with a sum which is equal to zero)
is either at rest, or it moves along a straight path with
constant speed.
Some comments are in order. Firstly, this law is valid
only if the velocity of the body is measured relative to

12.2
Forces
448
an inertial reference frame, i.e. a non-accelerated and non-
rotating frame not inﬂuenced by forces. Such a frame is
traditionally called ‘freely moving’.
Secondly, one may wonder if ‘not inﬂuenced by
forces’ implies ‘non-rotating’.
In order to remove any
doubt, think of a rotating neutron star (a pulsar). If it is
not acted upon by any forces it will rotate forever. Just
as a particle will proceed moving with constant veloc-
ity when no force acts upon it, an extended system will
proceed to rotate with constant angular velocity when no
force acts upon it, like a friction-free spinning top.
Thirdly, what is the logical status of Newton’s ﬁrst
law? Is it a physical law, or a deﬁnition of the concept
‘inertial reference frame’?
Are there laws of nature?
Something behind what
goes on and steers everything? Johann Wolfgang Goethe
seems to deny it: “Die Natur hat weder kern noch Schale,
alles is auf einem Male” (Nature has neither core nor shell,
everything is there at once). One requirement of a physi-
cal law is that it is conceivable (non-contradictory?) that
it could be broken by the actual behaviour of a physical
object. Analyzing Newton’s ﬁrst law it is advisable to in-
troduce the concept of implicit deﬁnition. Newton’s ﬁrst
law can be said to have double contents, separated as fol-
lows:
1. There exist reference frames in which free particles
move with constant speed along straight lines.

12.2
Forces
449
2. These reference frames are called inertial frames.
Newton’s second law:
The acceleration of a body is
proportional to the force acting on it, and inversely pro-
portional to its mass.
The proportionality constant can be chosen equal to
one, so that the law can be written
⃗a =
P⃗F
m
or
X⃗F = m⃗a
(12.1)
where P⃗F is the vector sum of the forces acting on the
body.
Newton’s second law involves three terms: ‘accelera-
tion’, ‘mass’, and ‘force’, and we have not yet given pre-
cise deﬁnitions of the two latter ones. A thorough discus-
sion of these terms is outside the main topic of this text.
Note, however, that the term ‘mass’ appears in two fun-
damentally different contexts in Newtonian dynamics. In
connection with Newton’s law of gravitation the ‘mass’
of a body expresses a quantity, namely the strength of
the gravitational force towards it. But in connection with
Newton’s second law ‘mass’ expresses the resistance of
the body to change is motion. In order to make clear that
these quantities are different, we should talk about gravi-
tational mass, and inertial mass, respectively.
Force is sometimes deﬁned as mass times acceleration.
Then ‘Newton’s second law’ is a deﬁnition, (force ≡

12.2
Forces
450
mass × acceleration) and it should not be possible to con-
front it with experimental results. However such ‘con-
frontation’ may be said to be a most useful part of New-
tonian dynamics. One way out of this dilemma, is again
to accept that what is called a ‘law’ has in reality a double
meaning. In the present case it has an empirical content:
that the acceleration of an arbitrary body is proportional
to a certain quantity. And it deﬁnes a term by means of
this empirical relation. The mentioned quantity is called
the force that acts upon the body.
Newton’s third law:
If a body A acts on another body
B with a force ⃗FB, then B acts back on A with a force ⃗FA in
the opposite direction and of the same magnitude,
⃗FA = −⃗FB.
According to Newton’s third law forces will always ap-
pear in pairs. It is suitable, then, to think of forces as in-
teractions between pairs of bodies.
One may wonder if it is possible to understand this
law as a convention.
Does it have empirical content?
Could the world be such that this ‘law’ is not obeyed?
Suppose we ﬁnd that A acts upon B. Can we possibly
ﬁnd that nevertheless B does not react upon A? If every
force is an interaction between two bodies, and if this term
implies a sort of ‘democracy’ in the sense that it is only a
matter of the physicists’ choice whether one says that A

12.3
Newton’s theory of gravitation
451
acts upon B, or B acts upon A, then Newton’s third law
would always be obeyed. In this case the question above
would be answered by ‘no’. However, in a rotating refer-
ence frame Newton’s third law is not obeyed. In such a
system a centrifugal force acts upon a body. But this body
does not act back on another body with an equal and op-
positely directed force. So the question above should be
answered by ‘yes’. Conclusion: Newton’s third law has
‘an empirical content. It is not a terminological conven-
tion.
12.3
Newton’s theory of gravitation
Newton realized that gravitation governs the motion of
the planets (as illustrated in Fig. 12.2). He also formu-
lated the law giving the gravitational force between two
spherical bodies in general.
Figure 12.3: Two bodies with masses m1 and m2
Consider two bodies with masses m1 and m2. Let ⃗r =
r⃗er be a vector representing the position of m2 relative to

12.3
Newton’s theory of gravitation
452
m1 (see Fig. 12.3).
Newton made the hypothesis that the gravitational
force acting from m1 upon m2 is
⃗F = −G m1m2
r2
⃗er,
(12.2)
where ⃗er is a unit vector directed away from m1 along
the connecting line through m1 and m2, and G = 6.6 ×
10−33m3kg−1s−2
is
Newton’s
gravitational
constant.
Equation (12.2) expresses Newton’s law of gravitation. In-
cidentally the body m2 acts upon m1 with an oppositely
directed gravitational force of the same magnitude, ac-
cording to Newton’s third law. This vector-equation tells
that the force is directed along the line connecting the
centres of the bodies, and acts in the negative ⃗er direc-
tion towards the mass m1 that generates the force. It is an
attractive force. If one is interested in the magnitude of
the force only, Eq. (12.2) is reduced to the more familiar
form
F = G m1m2
r2
.
Essentially, Newton’s theory of gravitation has the fol-
lowing ingredients. Universal time, Euclidean space, the
three dynamical laws, and the gravitational law.
The
force of gravitation is implicitly assumed to act instan-
taneously (actio in distantia). If God suddenly removed
some of the Sun’s mass, so that it instantly disappeared,

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
453
the gravitational force from the Sun upon the Earth
would change instantly.
12.4
Consequences of special relativ-
ity for a theory of gravitation
Einstein constructed the special theory of relativity in
1905. It is said to be based on two ‘postulates’ or rather
‘principles’. They have the status of physical hypotheses
of a rather basic kind.
The special principle of relativity.
Let F1 and F2 be two
inertial reference frames in a region free of gravitational
ﬁelds. To every physical process Q1 there exists a physi-
cal process Q2 such that Q2 as observed in F2 is identical
to Q1 as observed in F1. The reason for the word ‘special’
is that the identity refers only to a special case: identity
between inertial reference frames. According to this prin-
ciple no experiment gives information about the veloc-
ity of one’s own laboratory. One is always permitted to
consider an inertial laboratory, i.e. a non-rotating labora-
tory not acted upon by any forces, as at rest. This means
that velocity is always velocity in relation to something.
There exists no absolute velocity. Since the expressions of
the laws of nature are formalized descriptions of physical
processes, it follows that these laws must be formulated

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
454
without reference to the velocity of any reference frame.
Only velocities of objects relative to a chosen reference is of
physical signiﬁcance: ‘velocity is relative’. In the theory
of relativity the statement that ‘particle P1 has velocity ⃗v1’
has no sense unless a reference frame is introduced in re-
lation to which the velocity is said to be ⃗v1 .
The constancy of the velocity of light.
The velocity of
light is the same in every direction independently of the
velocity of the observer or emitter. This implies that it is
exactly the same relative to any freely moving reference
frame whatsoever.
These two principles, contradictory according to
Newton, furnish the basis of the special theory of rela-
tivity. We shall here be particularly concerned with one
consequence of that theory, namely the increase of mass
with (relative) velocity. This is expressed by the formula
m = m0

1 −v2
c2
−1/2
.
(12.3)
Here m is the mass of a body moving with a velocity
v relative to an observer, and m0 is its mass when it is at
rest. From Eq. (12.3) it is seen that limv→c m = ∞. The
mass of a body increases towards inﬁnity when its veloc-
ity approaches c. Due to the relation between energy, E,
and mass, m, expressed by E = mc2, this means that one
has to supply an inﬁnite amount of energy in order to

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
455
propel a particle all the way to the velocity of light. This
has often been interpreted to imply that particles with a
velocity greater than c cannot exist.
The Indian physicist C. G. S. Sudarshan has pointed
out that the reasoning behind this conclusion is similar
to the reasoning of people in India of old days, who con-
cluded that there could not exist people North of Hima-
laya, for it was impossible to pass through these moun-
tains. In fact, the theory of relativity permits the existence
of particles travelling faster than light. They are called
tachyons, and their physical existence is doubtful. From
the formula (12.3) it can only be deduced that such travel
cannot be realized by increasing the velocity from below
that of light. Tachyons must be created on the ‘upper side
of the light barrier’! They remain there. They cannot be
slowed down to c without being supplied with an inﬁnite
amount of energy.
However, due to the relativity of simultaneity, certain
causality paradoxes would appear if tachyons were able
to carry information. Think of an ‘Einstein train’ moving
past a station. In Ch. 5 we showed that if two events, one
at the front end of the train and one at the hindmost end,
happened simultaneously as observed on the train, then
the hindmost event would happen ﬁrst as observed on
the station. Imagine that we construct a ‘tachyon tele-
phone’ with tachyons moving inﬁnitely fast.
We send
a message from the station that arrives at the front end

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
456
of the train immediately. The message is reﬂected to the
emitter via a tachyon line attached to the train, so that it
arrives at the hindmost end of the train just as it passes
the emitter at the station. The signal arrives at that point
practically simultaneously with the reﬂection event as
observed on the train. Thus, as observed on the station
the signal arrives before it was reﬂected. Since it was re-
ﬂected at practically the same moment it was emitted, the
signal arrives back at the emitter before it was emitted.
The message could be: destroy the telephone as soon as
this message is received!
Since all sorts of waves can transfer information, grav-
itational waves are able to carry information. The veloc-
ity of gravitational waves is the ‘spreading velocity’ of
the gravitational force. This, together with the possibil-
ity of a ‘causality paradox’ implies that the gravitational
force cannot act instantaneously according to the special
theory of relativity.
This means that Newton’s theory
of gravitation contradicts the special theory of relativity.
There is a relation of logical incompatibility between the
two.
The anti-relativistic character of Newton’s theory of
gravity could not be discovered empirically in the case of
matter moving very much slower than light, since the rel-
ativistic deviations from the Newtonian results depend
upon the factor v2/c2, where v is the velocity of the, say, a
planet. This is the reason why Newton’s theory of grav-

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
457
itation has functioned so well for several centuries and
still does so.
In fact the calculations of the rocket ad-
justments needed in order for example to hit Saturn with
a spacecraft, are performed by means of Newton’s the-
ory of gravitation. The rocket don’t move fast enough to
make it necessary to warrant the introduction of the the-
ory of relativity.
Einstein found it compelling, as a matter of princi-
ple, to construct a gravitational theory in accordance with
the special theory of relativity.
He knew that the the-
ory of electromagnetic forces and ﬁelds formulated by
Maxwell in about 1860 was consistent with special rela-
tivity. And the law of the electrical force between two
charges, known as Coulomb’s law, has just the same form
as Newton’s gravitational law. He also knew that it was
Faraday’s introduction of the ﬁeld concept that paved the
way for Maxwell’s ‘relativistic theory of electromagnet-
ism’.
A ﬁrst step towards a satisfactory theory, is to formu-
late Newton’s theory of gravitation as a ﬁeld theory, in
which the force on a particle is due to a gravitational ﬁeld
acting on a particle, locally, at the position of the particle.
In this way one can get rid of the non-relativisic notion of
‘action at a distance’ (which corresponds to the unphys-
ical limit c →∞in the relativistic theory of gravitation,
because the force of gravity is spreading with the velocity
of light in this theory, just like the electromagnetic force).

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
458
In a ﬁeld theory the changes of the ﬁeld are described
locally by means of differential equations. For this pur-
pose it will be convenient to introduce something called
the gravitational potential φ. This is a function deﬁning the
potential energy of a particle with unit mass in a gravita-
tional ﬁeld. The potential energy of a body at a position
P is equal to the work needed to move the body from a
position where it has no potential energy, to P. The po-
sition where the potential energy is equal to zero, can be
chosen freely. In the gravitational ﬁeld at the surface of
the Earth, for example, it is often chosen at sea level. The
value of the potential increases in the upward direction
in a gravitational ﬁeld.
A simple illustration of the concept gravitational po-
tential is provided by a uniform gravitational ﬁeld in a
room, say. Let us choose the zero energy level at the ﬂoor.
The acceleration of gravity g is assumed to be constant.
The weight of a particle with mass m is mg. The particle
is lifted with constant velocity upwards from the ﬂoor to
a height h above the ﬂoor. The force needed to lift the
particle is mg, and the distance is h. The work, W, is
the force times the distance, i.e. W = mgh. The poten-
tial is the work per unit mass, thus, the potential, φ, at a
height h above the zero energy level in a uniform gravi-
tational ﬁeld is φ = gh. The potential at every point with
this height has the value gh. This means that in a uniform
gravitational ﬁeld a horizontal surface is an equipotential

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
459
surface.
Outside a spherical mass distribution the equipoten-
tial surfaces are spherical surfaces.
The potential in-
creases with increasing distance from the centre. In this
case one often deﬁnes the zero energy level on a spherical
surface with inﬁnitely large radius. Then the potential is
increasingly negative the closer one is to the centre.
In a ﬁeld (i.e. not ‘action at a distance’) theory of grav-
itation space is imagined to be ﬁlled with a gravitational
ﬁeld. The ﬁeld vector is the acceleration of gravity, ⃗a,
which is deﬁned to equal ‘minus the gradient of the grav-
itational potential’, φ. According to Eq. (10.14) the gradi-
ent of a scalar ﬁeld φ is given as
∇φ = ∂φ
∂x⃗ex + ∂φ
∂y⃗ey + ∂φ
∂z ⃗ez
in a Cartesian coordinate system. In terms of the gradient
operator ∇(see Eq. (10.15) or Appendix A) the accelera-
tion of gravity ⃗g is
⃗g = −∇φ.
(12.4)
The gravitational potential is determined locally by the
mass distribution. The differential equation that tells how
the mass distribution determines the potential is called
Poisson’s equation. It is a second order differential equa-
tion involving the so-called Laplacian (see Appendix A).
In Newton’s theory of gravitation,
mass is the
source—or rather the sink (due to the attractive character

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
460
of gravity)—of the gravitational ﬁeld. In the ﬁeld formu-
lation of the theory, this means mathematically that the
divergence of the gravitational ﬁeld is proportional to the
mass density. Thus
div ⃗g = −4πGρ.
Inserting the right-hand side of Eq. (12.4) leads to
div grad φ = 4πGρ.
Introducing the Laplacian deﬁned in Eq. (A.1) this equa-
tion can be written
∇2φ = 4πGρ.
(12.5)
This is Poisson’s equation. It is the analogy of Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations in the ﬁeld theory formulation of New-
ton’s theory of gravity. Equations (12.4) and (12.5) consti-
tute what may be called ‘Newton’s theory of gravitation
formulated as a ﬁeld theory’. In the ‘action at a distance
version of Newton’s theory of gravity, one had to assume
the form of the force law. In the ﬁeld theory formulation
this assumption is replaced by the more general assump-
tion that mass is the source of the gravitational ﬁeld, and
the force law can be deduced as a solution of this equa-
tion.
At a point where the mass density vanishes, the equa-
tion is reduced to
∇2φ = 0,
(12.6)

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
461
which is called Laplace’s equation.
We shall now show—for the special case of spherical
symmetry—that this equation implies Newton’s law of
gravitation
⃗g = −G M
r2
⃗er,
(12.7)
where M is the mass inside a sphere with centre at the
origin and radius r, and ⃗g is the acceleration of gravity
outside the spherical mass distribution. Thus we shall
solve Eq. (12.6) at an arbitrary point with vanishing mass
density in a spherically symmetric region.
In the present case the Laplace operator shall act upon
a gravitational potential φ that is a function of r only.
Then the last two terms of Eq. (A.15) vanish because
∂φ/∂θ = ∂φ/∂ϕ = 0. In the remaining term we can
replace the partial derivatives with ordinary derivatives.
Laplace’s equation then takes the form
1
r2
d


r2 dφ

= 0.
Since 1/r2 is different from zero, this equation reduces to
d
dr

r2 dφ
dr

= 0.
(12.8)
From this equation, we shall ﬁnd the acceleration of grav-
ity, which is given in Eq. (12.4). In the present case the

12.4
Special relativity and gravity
462
acceleration points in the radial direction, and the only
non-vanishing component is
gr = −dφ
dr .
Since integration is the same as antiderivation, integra-
tion of the left-hand side of Eq. (12.8) gives just the ex-
pression inside the parenthesis. And since the derivative
of a constant is zero, integration of the right-hand side
gives a constant. Thus, we get
r2 dφ
dr = K,
where K is an arbitrary constant. Dividing both sides of
this equation by r2 leads to
dφ
dr = K
r2.
Choosing K = GM we get Newton’s law of gravitation,
Eq. (12.7).
So far Newton’s theory formulated as a ﬁeld theory
reminds very much of the theory of an electrostatic ﬁeld.
There is, however, a fundamental difference between the
theory of the electric ﬁeld and gravitation. The electric
ﬁeld is uncharged. It does not contribute to the charge of
the source. The electric ﬁeld does not act by electric forces
upon itself. This has the mathematical consequence that

12.5
The general theory of relativity
463
the ﬁeld equations of the electric ﬁeld are linear differen-
tial equations.
The quantity that replaces electrical charge in the case
of gravitation, is mass. In other words, the ‘gravitational
charge’ is mass. A gravitational ﬁeld has energy. Accord-
ing to the relativistic equivalence between energy and
mass (E = mc2), a gravitational ﬁeld has mass.
Con-
sequently a gravitational ﬁeld is itself a source of gravi-
tational attraction. A gravitational ﬁeld acts upon itself.
The differential equation (12.5) is not able to describe the
action of a gravitational ﬁeld upon itself. According to
Newtonian theory the gravitational ﬁeld has no mass and
does not act upon itself. In this theory Poisson’s equation
is a correct ﬁeld equation for gravitation. But it cannot be
a relativistically correct equation.
We should mention that even if the concept of a gravi-
tational force is absent in general relativity, the non-linear
character of gravitation must be present in a relativistic
theory of gravitation. But in general relativity it is inter-
preted in terms of geometry, not in terms of forces.
12.5
The general theory of relativity
The following three principles make up the fundamental
physical assumptions of the general theory of relativity.
1. The special principle of relativity.

12.5
The general theory of relativity
464
2. The principle of the constancy of the velocity of
light.
3. The weak principle of equivalence (see below).
The ﬁrst two principles are the building blocks of the
special theory of relativity, which may be considered as
a decisive step in the conceptual development leading to
the general theory of relativity. Of special importance in
this connection is that special relativity demands of us
that we give up the old idea of absolute (non-relative)
time and space, and think instead of our existence in a
four-dimensional spacetime.
The principle of relativity is concerned with physical
phenomena. It motivates the introduction of a formal re-
quirement called the covariance principle. This principle
may be formulated in the following way: The general
laws of nature are to be expressed by equations which
hold good for all systems of coordinates, that is, they
are co-variant with respect to any change of coordinate
system. This requirement is not directly concerned with
physical phenomena, but with the way of talking about
them. As we know from the preceding chapters, tensor
equations have a coordinate independent form: they are
said to be form-invariant, also called ‘covariant’.
One should note, however, that a covariant equation,
when given physical interpretation, does not necessarily
obey the principle of relativity. This is due to the follow-

12.5
The general theory of relativity
465
ing circumstance. Because it is a physical principle, the
principle of relativity is concerned with relations that can
be observed. If you are going to investigate the physical
consequences of a tensor equation, you have to establish
certain relations between tensor components and observ-
able physical quantities. The relations have to be sepa-
rately deﬁned. From the tensor equations that are covari-
ant, and the deﬁned relations between the tensor compo-
nents and the observable physical quantities, one can de-
duce equations between observable physical quantities.
The special principle of relativity demands that the laws
which are expressed by these equations, can be stated in
the same way in every inertial reference frame, and that
the laws do not refer to any universally privileged refer-
ence frame, PRF. If we term the velocity of an arbitrary
frame relative to PRF the absolute velocity of the frame,
the principle of relativity requires that the laws of nature
do not refer to any absolute velocity, i.e. the equations re-
lating physical quantities should not contain any absolute
velocity.
If a physical theory is expressed by means of tensor
equations, the theory is said to be written in a manifestly
covariant form. As written in this way, the theory will
automatically fulﬁl the covariance principle, but it need
not fulﬁl the principle of relativity.
We shall now go on and introduce the famous principle
of equivalence. In the literature one ﬁnds two versions of

12.5
The general theory of relativity
466
this principle: the weak and the strong principle of equiv-
alence.
In order to be able to understand the signiﬁcance of
the weak principle of equivalence, one should remember
the fact that the term mass appears in two kinds of con-
texts in Newton’s theory of gravitation. On the one hand
it appears as the gravitational mass, mg, of a body. On the
other hand, mass appears in Newton’s second law as a
measure of how strongly a body resists acceleration. This
is the inertial mass, mi, of a body.
If Newton’s second law, Eq. (12.1), is combined with
Newton’s law of gravitation, Eq. (12.2), we may write
−G mg Mg
r2
⃗er = mi ⃗a,
for a particle with gravitational mass mg and inertial
mass mi at a distance ⃗r = r⃗er from the centre of a spheri-
cal body with gravitational mass Mg. The acceleration of
the particle is
⃗a = −GMg
r2
mg
mi
⃗er.
(12.9)
Note that the acceleration depends upon the quotient be-
tween the gravitational and the inertial mass of the parti-
cle.
Experiments have without exception conﬁrmed the
hypothesis that bodies made of different materials fall
with equal acceleration under the same carefully de-

12.5
The general theory of relativity
467
scribed circumstances.
From this hypothesis and
Eq. (12.2) we derive the well attested hypothesis: mg/mi
has the same numerical value for all bodies whatsoever.
This sameness of numerical value is the contents of the so
called weak principle of equivalence.
In such important cases of empirical conﬁrmations (so
far) without exception, what a physical equation ex-
presses is usually endowed with a honoriﬁc title ‘phys-
ical law’ or ‘law of nature’. We have used the term ‘hy-
pothesis’ because future instances of observational dis-
conﬁrmation are possible. According to the philosophy
of possibilism, we have no guarantee whatsoever that the
future in the relevant area will resemble the past. There
might be changes so deep and universal that nobody
could meaningfully declare ‘this time the conditions are
such that a crucial test is possible, and we shall ﬁnd out
whether our previous series of conﬁrmations will con-
tinue indeﬁnitely or not’. Also if there were too many
abrubt changes, we may not be able to observe them. The
process of observation seems only to be possible if we
can rely, for instance, on at least a moderate steadiness
of the constitution of the material world and how it be-
haves. Fundamentally chaotic and erratic behaviour en-
compassing the observing subject seems to be incompati-
ble with the act of obtaining knowledge about observable
properties of the material world.

12.5
The general theory of relativity
468
It was tempting for Einstein (and only Einstein?), not
to rest with a law stating that two different entities, mg
and mi, always are quantitatively the same.
Einstein
asked: why not think of mg and mi as one and the same
physical entity, like the ‘Morning Star’ and ‘Evening Star’
being names for the same planet Venus? The validity of
the weak principle of equivalence could then be proved
because measures of mg and mi would then be measures
of one and the same entity. An entity that was simply
called ‘mass’. It would have to be a very special kind
of entity showing an extreme generality, characterising
every physical kind of system, including, for example
electromagnetic ﬁelds, and the particles of microphysics.
Also the naming could be changed. By the weak prin-
ciple of equivalence one might mean what is expressed
by the six words gravitational and inertial mass are identical.
This in turn makes the principle not something proved.
It is, however, a physical hypothesis of immense gener-
ality. A stroke of Einstein’s genius was to recognize this
hypothesis and make it a part of the foundations of his
remarkable general theory of relativity.
According to this principle Eq. (12.9) is reduced to
Eq. (12.7). Note that no property whatsoever of the accel-
erated particle is referred to in the equation. Neither the
mass of the particle nor what it consists of means any-
thing for its acceleration, only its position in the gravita-
tional ﬁeld.

12.5
The general theory of relativity
469
This made Einstein realize that the acceleration of a
particle at a certain position in a gravitational ﬁeld might
be a property of space itself at this position. This has noth-
ing to do with any property of the particle. But even if it
is a property of space itself, we do not necessarily leave
physics and enter mathematics. We enter the area of ge-
ometrical properties of something physical. So Einstein
conceived the revolutionary project of a geometrical con-
ception of gravity: the essence of the general theory of
relativity.
But how is this possible some may ask. Is not geom-
etry a part of mathematics and gravity a part of physics?
The question is serious. Let us look at an example. We
may offer a purely geometrical description of a perfect
sugar cube. All angles are ninety degrees, all sides ﬂat
and equal. We leave out chemical properties, taste and
everything else, conﬁning ourselves to purely geometri-
cal properties. By calling the description of gravity ge-
ometrical, we refer to geometrical properties of physical
spacetime. But in contrast to the description of the sugar
cube we may add: there are1 no other properties, chemi-
cal, electrical or otherwise.
Even if Newton declared that he made no hypotheses
as to the physical cause of the gravitational force, the con-
1We should here warn the reader: spacetime may not be as simple as that.
Quantum ﬁeld theory indicates that what we call vacuum is tremendously com-
plicated and badly understood. But that is another story.

12.5
The general theory of relativity
470
ceptual structure of his theory invites to search for such
a cause. In the second half of the eighteenth century, one
tried for example to explain the gravitational force as a re-
sult of hydrodynamic phenomena in the so-called ‘ether’.
Einstein’s theory of gravitation is different. According to
this theory there is no gravitational force.
An important consequence of the weak principle of
equivalence is that the ‘inﬂuence’ (see below) of a ﬁeld
of weight upon all ‘local’ (the meaning of this word in
the present context is explained below) mechanical experi-
ments can be simulated by an accelerated frame of reference,
say an Einstein lift, in a region free of gravitating masses.
Consequently, every ‘inﬂuence’ of a ﬁeld of weight upon
a local mechanical experiment can be ‘transformed
away’, by going into a freely falling frame of reference.
The so-called strong principle of equivalence generalizes
these statements to encompass experiments involving
physical processes of arbitrary nature, not just mechan-
ical ones.
The strong principle of equivalence makes the concep-
tion of a causal inﬂuence of a ﬁeld of weight upon for ex-
ample light superﬂuous and misleading. We should stick
to just kinematics (science of movement), as far as gravi-
tation is concerned, totally leaving out dynamics (science
of force).
Consider a ray of light directed horizontally at the sur-
face of the Earth. According to the Newtonian (dynam-

12.5
The general theory of relativity
471
ical) conception of gravitation, a gravitational ﬁeld acts
upon light if it has mass, and forces the light ray to bend
downwards. If light is mass-less there is no gravitational
force, and the light ray is perfectly straight. The under-
standing of gravitation obtained in the general theory of
relativity is free of any dynamical relationships, and leads
in fact to a prediction which is different from the New-
tonian one in the present example. The situation is de-
scribed as follows. If the observer moves non-inertially,
in other words, if he is not in free fall, but is acted upon
by some kind of force (non-gravitational, since in general
relativity no gravitational force exists), then he shall ﬁnd
that a ray of light is bended. This bending is understood
not to be an observer-independent feature of the motion
of light. Nothing acts upon the light and makes it bend. If
the observer moves inertially, then he shall observe that,
locally, the ray of light is straight. General relativity thus
predicts that if light moves with a ﬁnite velocity, then a
non-inertial observer shall register a bending of a light
ray, whether light has mass or not.
As mentioned above, what is, in Newton’s theory of
gravitation, understood as the inﬂuence of a ﬁeld of
weight upon the results of a local experiment, can be
transformed away, by going into a freely falling frame of
reference.
The word ‘local’ means local both in space and time.
The reason for this restriction is the existence of what

12.5
The general theory of relativity
472
in Newton’s theory of gravitation is called tidal forces.
These are the forces that cause the ebb and ﬂood of tides
on the Earth.
Figure 12.4 depicts the Earth in the gravitational ﬁeld
of the Sun. The Sun is in the ‘downward’ direction in the
plane of the paper. The ﬁeld lines approach each other
in the direction of the Sun, indicating that the ﬁeld is
stronger closer to the Sun. The lengths of the arrows in-
dicate that acceleration of gravity, in the ﬁeld of the Sun,
is larger at the side of the Earth which turns towards the
Sun, than at the opposite side. Compared to the centre
of the Earth, i.e. to the Earth as a whole, the water at
the sunny side is drawn more strongly towards the Sun,
and the water at the opposite side more weakly. This,
together with the similar properties of the Moon’s gravi-
tational ﬁeld at the surface of the Earth, causes the tides.
The difference of gravitational pull is fortunately small.
Otherwise we might have horrible tidal waves hundreds
of metres high.
A gravitational ﬁeld in which the acceleration of grav-
ity is the same everywhere is called homogeneous. Then
the gravitational ﬁeld lines are parallel. A gravitational
ﬁeld in which the acceleration of gravity is position de-
pendent, has ﬁeld lines that are not parallel, as those of
Fig. 12.4.
Such a gravitational ﬁeld is said to be inho-
mogeneous. An inhomogeneous gravitational ﬁeld cannot
be transformed away by going into a freely falling refer-

12.5

473

12.5

ence frame. But measurements of tidal forces demand a
certain duration and spatial extension. ‘Local’ has here
the following meaning: The measurements are to be re-
stricted in duration and spatial extension, so that tidal
forces cannot be measured within the accuracy of mea-
surement that can be obtained with the equipment of the
observer. The extension of the area that can be considered
‘local’, depends upon the character and accuracy of this
equipment.
In this connection it is important to note the difference
between inertial reference frames Fsr in special relativity
and inertial reference frames Fgr in general relativity. The
special relativistic inertial frames are unaccelerated refer-
ence frames of arbitrary extension in a space free of gravi-
tational ﬁelds, i.e. ﬂat spacetime. The general relativistic
inertial reference frames are local systems falling freely in
curved spacetime.
The strong principle of equivalence may now be stated
as follows. Given a certain measuring accuracy, to every
physical process Q1 in Fgr there exists a physical process
Q2 in an inertial frame Fsr in Minkowski spacetime, so
that Q2 is found by observation in Fsr to be identical to Q1
observed in Fgr.
The strings of a music instrument, for example, vi-
brate in the same manner whether you play in a ﬂat re-
gion far from any masses, or in a satellite just above the
Earth. You can play with it equally successfully at either

12.5
The general theory of relativity
475
place.
The strong principle of equivalence announces the
physical equivalence of all inertial reference frames.
Since the process of transforming away a ﬁeld of
weight by going into a freely falling reference frame may
be reversed, there is also a corresponding equivalence
between non-inertial reference frames. The acceleration
ﬁeld in such a frame has the same physical effects,
whether it is caused by acceleration of the reference
frame, or it is due to a nearby mass.
However, if we compare observations in a non-inertial
and an inertial reference frame, differences will appear.
Light, for example, is deﬂected in a non-inertial reference
frame, and moves along a straight path in an inertial ref-
erence frame. One may in several ways, both by optical
and by mechanical means, ﬁnd out by local experiments,
whether one is in a non-inertial or an inertial reference
frame.
In spite of this, Einstein generalized the special prin-
ciple of relativity to a general principle of relativity, en-
compassing accelerated motion. Due to the locally ob-
servable difference between inertial and non-inertial ref-
erence frames, the generalization of the special principle
of relativity cannot be just to replace ‘inertial reference
frames’ with ‘arbitrary reference frames’ in its formula-
tion.

12.5
The general theory of relativity
476
Even if one restricts oneself to using inertial reference
frames, a physical process is determined not only by the
laws of nature, but also by the initial conditions. If one
refers to an arbitrary coordinate system, the process will
in addition depend upon the metric of the coordinate sys-
tem. However, if one formulates the natural laws so that
they are valid without any changes for every metric gµν,
one may formulate a general principle of relativity as fol-
lows: Natural laws are independent of coordinate sys-
tems and even reference frames, and so are their expres-
sions.
In other words: It should not be necessary to
change the verbal formulation of any natural law when
changing the reference frame.
In the special case of the propagation of light, the law
is: light follows null geodesic curves, that is geodesic
curves in spacetime such that the spacetime intervals are
zero along the curve (see Sect. 5.12). This sentence is per-
fectly adequate whether the reference frame is acceler-
ated or not. The shape of a geodesic curve depends upon
the ﬁrst derivative of the metric due to the presence of the
Christoffel symbols in the geodesic equation, and it fol-
lows from this law that light is deﬂected in a non-inertial
reference frame, but not in an inertial frame. The fact that
light is deﬂected in a non-inertial reference frame, implies
that the velocity of light is constant only in local inertial refer-
ence frames.

12.5
The general theory of relativity
477
As mentioned above, an important consequence of the
principles of equivalence is that gravitation may be de-
scribed geometrically. In the general theory of relativity
the gravitational attraction between two bodies is not per-
ceived as the result of an interaction between the bodies.
Instead it is described as the curvature of spacetime near
the bodies. There is no longer any gravitational dynam-
ics (of particles in a gravitational ﬁeld), only gravitational
kinematics—theory of movement.
Newton’s law of gravitation is in general relativity re-
placed by equations that tell how the presence of mass
or energy corresponds to curved spacetime and vice versa.
These equations—the ﬁeld equations of Einstein—do not
follow logically from the principles we have talked about
above. In order to arrive at these equations Einstein de-
manded that conservation of energy and momentum
shall follow from the ﬁeld equations. He also wanted to
make the equations as simple as possible. Noting that
higher order derivatives would make the equations inor-
dinately complicated, he limited himself to a curvature
tensor involving only ﬁrst and second derivatives of the
metric tensor.
Einstein was well aware of the fact that natural phe-
nomena of a certain class, for example those having to
do with gravitation, can be represented conceptually and
mathematically by a manifold of theories. For Einstein a
most important criterium for selecting one theory above

12.5
The general theory of relativity
478
the others is that of simplicity.
In Einstein’s Herbert
Spencer lecture, delivered at Oxford, June 10, 1933, he
said:
Our experience hitherto justiﬁes us in believ-
ing that nature is the realization of the simplest
conceivable mathematical ideas.
And in Forum Phil. 1, 173 (1930) he wrote:
I do not consider the main signiﬁcance of the
general theory of relativity to be the predic-
tion of some tiny observable effects, but rather
the simplicity of its foundations and its consis-
tency.
Note that ‘simple’ here does not mean ‘easy’. A simple
theory is above all conceptually and mathematically eco-
nomic. It introduces a smallest possible number of prin-
ciples and concepts representing a largest possible set of
physical phenomena in a mathematically consistent way.
In order to realize such a theory one may need to in-
troduce advanced mathematics, but a guiding principle
is: Construct the theory with maximum breath of ﬁeld
of valid application, with maximal conceptual economy,
and represent its conceptual structure in as few and sim-
ple mathematical terms as possible, expressed with an
appropriate and suggestive notation.

We shall describe a static and very weak gravitational
ﬁeld, like the gravitational ﬁeld in the Solar system. We
start by giving a relativistic representation of the acceler-
ation of gravity.
The motion of a free particle is expressed by the geod-
esic equation, Eq. (8.7). Making use of the proper time τ
of the particle as parameter, this equation takes the form
d2xµ
dτ2 + Γ µ
αβ
dxα
dτ

dτ = 0,
(12.10)
where xµ = (x1, x2, x3, x4) and x4 = ct.
Consider a free particle instantaneously at rest. Then
the spatial components, uj = dxj/dτ, of the particle’s
four-velocity vanish, dxj/dτ = 0. The time component
is u4 = dx4/dτ = d(ct)/dτ = c dt/dτ. In the summation
over α and β in Eq. (12.10) only the term with α = β = 4
is non-vanishing. Equation (12.10) represents a set of four
equations, one for each value of µ. Putting µ = j one then
ﬁnds the equation of motion in the j direction

The coordinate clocks of an observer at the position of
the particle at the instant it is at rest, are chosen to be syn-
chronized with the standard clock of the particle. Since
we want to calculate the acceleration ⃗a = aj⃗ej of the par-
ticle at this particular instant, we have dτ = dt, and aj =
d2xj/dt2 = d2xj/dτ2.
The acceleration of gravity is deﬁned as the acceleration
of a freely falling particle instantaneously at rest. Because
dτ/dt = 1 we get from Eq. (12.11)
aj = −c2Γ j
44.
(12.12)
We have thereby obtained a physical, not merely geomet-
rical, interpretation of the Christoffel symbols Γ j44. They
represent the components of the acceleration of gravity.
We now assume that the gravitational ﬁeld is very
weak at the position of the particle. Relativistically this
implies that the curvature of spacetime is small. The met-
ric tensor deviates very little from the Minkowski metric
ηµν.
The line element of ﬂat spacetime as expressed by
Cartesian coordinates and the usual time coordinate, has
the form
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 −c2 dt2.
(12.13)
The components of the metric tensor are
ηxx = ηyy = ηzz = 1
and
ηtt = −c2.
(12.14)

12.6
The Newtonian limit of general relativity

It is practical to introduce a fourth coordinate x4 = c t,
which may be called ‘light distance’ since it represents
the distance that light passes during a time t. Inserting
this coordinate into the last term of Eq. (12.13), the line
element takes the form
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 −(dx4)2.
(12.15)
We read from this that the components of the metric ten-
sor are
ηxx = ηyy = ηzz = 1
and
η44 = −1.
(12.16)
Both Eqs. (12.14) and ( 12.16) are called the Minkowski
metric. We shall use the form (12.16).
We now introduce a tensor with components hµν
which represents the deviation from the Minkowski met-
ric. We may write
gµν = ηµν + hµν.
(12.17)
Since the gravitational ﬁeld is assumed to be very weak,
the deviation from the Minkowski metric is very small.
Thus, the components hµν have magnitudes much less
than 1, i.e. |hµν| ≪1. We also assume that the tensor hµν
is diagonal. Then the contravariant components of the
metric tensor are given by Eq. (5.75), that is
gµµ = 1/gµµ.
(12.18)

We need to calculate the Christoffel symbol Γ j44 which is
present in Eq. (12.12). Inserting τ = j, ν = 4, and λ = 4 in

.
(12.19)
Since we describe a static gravitational ﬁeld, the met-
ric tensor is time-independent. Then the ﬁrst two terms
on the right-hand side of Eq. (12.19) vanish, and the equa-
tion is reduced to
Γ j
44 = −1
2 gjµ ∂g44
∂xµ .
(12.20)
Since the metric is diagonal, meaning that gjµ = 0 for
µ ̸= j, only µ = j contributes in the summation over µ.
Equation (12.20) then further reduces to
Γ j
44 = −gjj ∂g44
∂xj .
Using Eq. (12.18) we get
Γ j
44 = −1
gjj
∂g44
∂xj .
Substituting for gjj and g44 from Eq. (12.17) follows

Now ηjj = 1 for all j and hjj ≪1, so we can neglect hjj
and obtain

∂h44
∂xj .
Inserting this into Eq. (12.12) we have
aj = c2
2
∂h44
∂xj .
(12.21)
Since g44 = −1 + h44, this equation indicates how, in the
Newtonian limit, the time–time (i.e. four–four) compo-
nent of the metric tensor determines the acceleration of
gravity.
According to Eq. (12.4) the j component of the acceler-
ation of gravity is expressed in terms of the gravitational
potential φ, by
aj = −∂φ
∂xj.
Comparing with Eq. (12.21) we get
−∂φ
∂xj = c2

∂h44

12.6
The Newtonian limit of general relativity
484
From which follows
φ = −c2
2 h44.
Multiplying each side by −2 and dividing by c2, we ﬁnd
the following expression for h44 in terms of the (Newto-
nian) gravitational potential
h44 = −2φ
c2 .
The above equations contain concepts completely foreign
to Newtonian thinking. This means that it is misleading
to think of them as a generalization of Newtonian think-
ing. Nevertheless Newton’s equations are logically deriv-
able from Einstein’s theory in the case of very weak grav-
itational ﬁelds and as applied to objects moving with ve-
locities very much smaller than that of light.
Since, according to Eq. (12.21), only the component h44
of the tensor hµν contributes to the acceleration of gravity
in the Newtonian limit, we are free to choose a coordinate
system so that all the other components of hµν vanish.
Then the line element of spacetime can be written
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 −(1 −h44) c2 dt2,
or
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 −

12.6
The Newtonian limit of general relativity

There is only one function φ to be determined by the
ﬁeld equations. In this special case there is only one in-
dependent ﬁeld equation, which can be taken as the 44
component of Eq. (11.34)
R44 = κ

T44 −1

.
(12.23)
Because φ and its ﬁrst derivatives are much less than 1,
we may use the expression (11.11) of the Riemann curva-
ture tensor, valid in a local Cartesian coordinate system
Rµναβ = 1
2 (gµβ,να −gµα,νβ −gνβ,µα + gνα,µβ) .
In particular, putting ν = 4 and β = 4,
Rµ4α4 = 1
2 (gµ4,4α −gµα,44 −g44,µα + g4α,µ4) .
Considering a static ﬁeld, all terms with time-derivatives
(terms with a number 4 somewhere after a comma) are
equal to zero. In this case we get
Rµ4α4 = −1
2 g44,µα = −1
2
∂2g44
∂xµ∂xα.
(12.24)
Since g44 = −1 −2φ/c2, the derivatives of g44 are −2/c2
times the derivatives of φ. Equation (12.24) then becomes
Rµ4α4 = 1

∂2φ

Contracting µ with α leads to

(12.26)
Substituting the last expression in (12.26) for ∂2φ/∂xα∂xα,
Eq. (12.25) takes the form
R44 = −∂2φ
c4∂t2 + 1
c2
∂2φ
∂xj∂xj.
Since, according to our assumptions, derivatives with re-

Using Eq. (A.13) in Appendix A, this equation can be
written
R44 = 1

(12.27)
Considering the components of the energy-momen-
tum tensor of a perfect ﬂuid, as given in Eq. (10.27), we
see that in the Newtonian limit the term T44 = ρc2 is
dominating. All the other terms can be neglected com-
pared to T44. From the rule that indices can be lowered
(see Eq. (5.76)) by means of the Minkowski metric in the
Newtonian limit, we ﬁnd, making use of η44 = −1
T ≡T 4
4 = η4αTα4 = η44T44 = −T44.
(12.28)
Neglecting h44 in the ﬁrst step and using η44 = −1 and
Eq. (12.28) in the second step below leads to

From Eqs. (12.27) and (12.29) we derive

2 κ ρ c4.
(12.30)

12.6
The Newtonian limit of general relativity
488
This represents the Newtonian limit of Einstein’s gravi-
tational ﬁeld equations. The equation is approximately
valid only for very weak gravitational ﬁelds.
According to the deﬁnition (A.1) of the Laplacian
Eq. (12.30) can be written as
div grad φ = 1
2κρc4.
From Eq. (12.4) the acceleration of gravity is given by
⃗a = −grad φ.
From the last two equations it is seen that Eq. (12.30) can
be given the form
div ⃗a = −1
2κc4ρ.
According to the interpretation of the divergence, as
discussed in Sect. 10.2, this equation expresses that the
acceleration of gravity is a ﬁeld that converges (due to the
minus sign) towards regions with a non-vanishing mass-
density. This negative sign is the mathematical expres-
sion of the fact that gravitation is an attractive force.
Comparing Eqs. (12.30) and (12.5) we see that the rel-
ativistic equations are compatible with the ‘Newtonian’
gravitational ﬁeld equation if (1/2)κρc4 = 4πGρ. Solving
this equation with respect to κ we get
κ = 8π G/c4.

Repulsive gravitation

This quantity has been termed ‘Einstein’s gravitational
constant’, because κ is the proportionality constant be-
tween Einstein’s curvature tensor and the energy-
momentum tensor in Einstein’s ﬁeld equations.
12.7
Repulsive gravitation
In this section we shall still consider very weak gravita-
tional ﬁelds, i.e. nearly ﬂat spacetimes, that are described
by the line element (12.22), but we shall now investigate
the gravitational properties of perfect ﬂuids with non-
negligible stresses.

Consider a perfect ﬂuid at rest. In the weak ﬁeld approx-

T ij = p δij
and
T 44 = ρc2.
The mixed components are

and
T 4

∇2φ = 4πG (ρ + 3p/c2).
(12.34)
Comparing this equation with the corresponding Newto-
nian equation (12.5), we deﬁne a relativistic gravitational
mass density ρg by
∇2φ = 4πGρg.
(12.35)
Equations (12.34) and (12.35) imply
ρg = ρ + 3p/c2.
(12.36)

12.8
‘Geodesic postulate’ and the ﬁeld equations
491
This is the relativistic mass density that generates the
gravitational ﬁeld which gives free particles an accelera-
tion of gravity. Here p > 0 represents pressure, and p < 0
represents tension. Thus the pressure in a star, for ex-
ample, increases the attractive gravitational ﬁeld. This is
the reason that according to general relativity, sufﬁciently
massive stars will collapse to black holes (see chapter 13).
According to Newton’s theory of gravitation a large pres-
sure can prevent such a collapse, but relativistically the
pressure is itself a source of increased gravitational at-
traction. If there exists a medium for which the tension
is so large that p < −(1/3)ρc2, then such a medium will
be a source of repulsive gravitation. In chapter 14 on cos-
mology we shall see that vacuum energy may be such a
medium. However, proceeding towards the limit c →∞,
representing Newton’s theory with instantaneous action
at a distance, the possibility of repulsive gravitation van-
ishes.
12.8
The ‘geodesic postulate’ derived
from the ﬁeld equations
The principle that free particles follow geodesic curves is
often called ‘the geodesic postulate’. Early in the history
of general relativity this was considered an independent
assumption, which could not be logically derived from

12.8
‘Geodesic postulate’ and the ﬁeld equations
492
the other principles of the theory. It is an empirical propo-
sition, part of physics, not of geometry, and in principle
open to testing and revision by observations. In order
to exhibit the extremely important conceptual economy
of Einstein’s theory of spacetime and gravitation, we feel
we have an obligation to show, to those readers who are
still willing to do some mathematics, that ‘the geodesic
postulate’ clearly follows as a logical consequence of the
ﬁeld equations. The derivation necessitates many steps,
but each is rather elementary.
Consider a system of free particles in curved space-
time. This system can be regarded as a pressure-free gas.
Such a gas is called dust. From Eq. (10.35) follows that it
is described by an energy-momentum tensor
T µν = ρuµuν,
where ρ is the rest density of the dust as measured by
an observer at rest in the dust, and uµ the components of
the four-velocity of the dust-particles. All particles of the
dust have the same velocity, so that the dust moves like a
rigid system.
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, Eq. (11.31), as applied to
spacetime ﬁlled with dust, take the form
Rµν −1
2 gµν R = κ ρ uµuν.
Because the divergence of the left-hand side is zero (see
Eq. (11.27)), the divergence of the right-hand side must

12.8
‘Geodesic postulate’ and the ﬁeld equations
493
be zero, too
(ρ uµuν);ν = 0
or
(ρ uνuµ );ν = 0.
The quantity in the parenthesis we now regard as a prod-
uct of ρuν and uµ. By the rule for differentiating a product
we get
(ρ uν);ν uµ + ρ uνuµ
;ν = 0.
(12.37)
Since the four-velocity of any object in spacetime has a
magnitude equal to the velocity of light (see Eq. (10.23)),
we have
uµ uµ = −c2.
(12.38)
Differentiation gives
(uµ uµ);ν = 0.
Using, again, the rule for differentiating a product, we get
uµ;ν uµ + uµ uµ
;ν = 0.
(12.39)
Applying the rule (5.77) for raising an index (second and
fourth equality below), and the freedom of changing a
summation index from α to µ, say, (last equality) we get
uµ;ν uµ = uµ uµ;ν = gµα uα uµ;ν = uα gµα uµ;ν
= uα uα
;ν = uµ uµ
;ν.

12.8
‘Geodesic postulate’ and the ﬁeld equations
494
Thus the second term of Eq. (12.39) is equal to the ﬁrst
one. Accordingly Eq. (12.39) says that the sum of two
equal terms are equal to zero. It follows that each of them
are equal to zero. So we have
uµ uµ
;ν = 0.
(12.40)
We now multiply each term of Eq. (12.37) by uµ. From
this follows
(ρ uν);ν uµ uµ + ρ uν uµ uµ
;ν = 0.
Using Eq. (12.38) in the ﬁrst term, and Eq. (12.40) in the
last term, which then vanishes, we get
(ρuν);ν (−c2) = 0.
Dividing by −c2,
(ρ uν);ν = 0.
Putting this into Eq. (12.37) we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst term
vanishes,
ρ uν uµ
;ν = 0.
Since ρ ̸= 0 we must have
uν uµ
;ν = 0.
(12.41)
This is just the geodesic equation (8.5). Conclusion: It
follows from Einstein’s ﬁeld equations that free particles move
along geodesic curves of space time.

12.9
Constants of motion
495
12.9
Constants of motion
When we are going to ﬁnd the motion of particles moving
in gravitational ﬁelds by solving the geodesic equation,
it is very useful to ﬁnd quantities that have conserved
values during the motion of the particle. Such quantities
are called constants of motion. They can be found from
the geodesic equation. In this connection it is practical
to lower the index µ in Eq. (12.41). Hence we write the
geodesic equation in the form
uν uµ;ν = 0.
The covariant derivatives of the covariant components
are given by Eq. (7.25)
uν (uµ,ν −uα Γ α
µν) = 0.
Consequently
uµ,ν uν = Γ α
µν uαuν.
Making use of Eq. (7.8) on the left-hand side we get
duµ
dτ = Γ α
µν uαuν.

12.9
Constants of motion
496
Substituting the expression (7.30) for the Christoffel sym-
bols gives
duµ
dτ = 1
2gαβ (gβµ,ν + gβν,µ −gµν,β) uαuν
= 1
2 (gβµ,ν + gβν,µ −gµν,β) gαβuαuν.
(12.42)
According to Eq. (5.77), gαβuα = uβ, so Eq. (12.42) takes
the form
duµ
dτ = 1
2 (gβµ,ν + gβν,µ −gνµ,β) uβuν.
(12.43)
Note that gβµ,ν −gνµ,β is antisymmetric in β and ν, mean-
ing that this quantity changes sign if β and ν are ex-
changed, gβµ,ν −gνµ,β = −(gνµ,β −gβµ,ν). Furthermore,
uβuν is symmetric under exchange of β and ν, i.e. uβuν =
uνuβ. Multiplying the ﬁrst and the third term inside the
parenthesis in Eq. (12.43) by the factor uβuν outside the
parenthesis, we ﬁnd
(gβµ,ν −gνµ,β) uβuν = gβµ,νuβuν −gνµ,βuβuν.
Exchanging the summation indices β and ν in the ﬁrst
term, i.e. letting β →ν and ν →β, we get
(gβµ,ν −gνµ,β) uβuν = gνµ,βuνuβ −gνµ,βuβuν
= gνµ,β
 uνuβ −uβuν
.

12.9
Constants of motion
497
Due to the symmetry of uβuν in β and ν the terms in the
parenthesis cancel each other, and we obtain
(gβµ,ν −gνµ,β) uβuν = 0.
The only property we have used in deducing this result is
symmetry properties of the factors gβµ,ν−gνµ,β and uβuν.
Thus we have proved the following useful result: Sum-
mation over the indices of the factors in a product between an
antisymmetric and a symmetric quantity always gives zero.
This result implies that only the second term in the
parenthesis of Eq. (12.43) contributes to the summation
over β and ν, ultimately providing
duµ
dτ = 1
2 gβ ν,µ uβuν.
(12.44)
This is the form of the geodesic equation we have sought
for. It shows that if gβν,µ = 0, then duµ/dτ = 0, which
implies that uµ is then a constant of motion. Thus we
have proved the following result: If all the components of
the metric tensor are independent of a coordinate xµ, then the
covariant component uµ of the four velocity is a constant along
the trajectory of any freely moving particle.

12.11
General relativity versus New-
ton’s theory of gravitation
You may have heard sentences such as ‘Einstein has
proved
that
Newton
was
wrong’,
implying
that
Newton’s theory of gravity was proved to be false when
the general theory of relativity was accepted as correct.
One also sometimes hears that ‘the general theory of rel-
ativity generalized Newton’s theory of gravity’.
None of these sentences can withstand criticism based
on fundamental insights reached at in contemporary phi-
losophy of science.
Consider the conceptual structure of Newton’s theory
of gravity on the one hand, and the general theory of rel-
ativity on the other hand. The essential concept of New-
ton’s theory is that of force. And this concept does not
even exist in Einstein’s theory understood as a theory of
space, time and gravitation. The general theory of relativ-
ity is, right from its fundamental principles to its mathe-
matical formulation, a totally new conception and inven-
tion. It does not generalize Newton’s theory. It replaces
it!
But clearly there is a connection between Newtons’s
theory of gravitation and Einstein’s theory of relativity.
They are both physical theories, and the region of appli-
cability of Einstein’s theory encompasses the region of
applicability of Newton’s theory. Furthermore, the fun-

12.11
General relativity versus Newton’s theory
500
damental principles of general relativity is formulated in
terms of concepts existing in Newton’s theory, such as
space, time, mass, motion and soforth. However, the new
concept of curved spacetime was introduced in the gen-
eral theory. This made it possible to construct a theory
in which concepts and priciples that are independent of
each other in Newton’s theory, are intimately related in
Einstein’s theory. For example space and time are united
into a four-dimensional spacetime, energy and mass are
equivalent, the equation of continuity (energy conserva-
tion) and the equation of motion of neutral matter (mo-
mentum conservation) follows as a consequence of the
ﬁeld equations in Einstein’s theory. This means that Ein-
stein’s theory is conceptually more economical than
Newton’s theory.
When we say that Einstein’s theory has a larger region
of applicability than Newton’s theory, we mean that some
phenomena that are correctly described by Einstein’s the-
ory, are either not described at all by Newton’s theory, or
Newton’s theory predicts wrong results for them. One
example is that time goes slower further down in a grav-
itational ﬁeld.
Conceptual simplicity and generality are obtained at
the cost of introducing a more complicated mathematical
formalism. The distance, as regards the amount of calcu-
lations, from the formulation of the general principles, to
the predictions of physical phenomena, is greater in Ein-

12.11
General relativity versus Newton’s theory
501
stein’s theory than in Newton’s.
Also the level of abstraction is greater in Einstein’s
theory than in Newton’s. Einstein’s theory is expressed
in terms of a formalism—the tensor formulation of dif-
ferential geometry—that was developed for geometrical,
rather than physical purposes. The physical meaning of
the formalism within Einstein’s theory is established
through our physical interpretation of the theory. For ex-
ample, four-dimensional wace, which is a basic geomet-
rical concept in general relativity, is interpreted as the
spacetime of the universe we live in. Time-like geodesic
curves are interpreted as paths of free particles. Inter-
preting the formalism physically, we can extract observa-
tional predictions from the equations. The predictions of
the theories can then be compared.
Comparing Galilean kinematics and Newton’s theory
of gravity with Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one
ﬁnds:
1. Einstein’s theory is richer (more general) than New-
ton’s, i.e. it has a wider range of applicability than
Newton’s theory.
2. In the limit of very weak ﬁelds and low velocities,
the predictions of Newton’s and Einstein’s theories
are practically identical.
In those cases where the measurable predictions of the
two theories are different, observations have agreed with

12.12
Epistemological comment
502
general relativity. This does not mean that Newton’s the-
ory is wrong. It sets, however, a limit for the range of
applicability of Newton’s theory.
Today the general theory of relativity is established as
a theory of great beauty, and a wide ﬁeld of applications.
During the latest twenty years, thousands of research ar-
ticles have been published, exploring the properties and
consequences of general relativity. Yet, at the very fron-
tier of today’s physics research is the effort to construct
a new uniﬁed theory, encompassing both gravitational
phenomena, quantum phenomena, and the fundamental
forces. We must expect that a new conceptual framework
has to be constructed. And there will probably continue
to be an increasingly long way, mathematically, from the
basic principles of the theory to its physical predictions.
The bonus will be great. We shall reach new depths in our
comprehension of our universe. Still, the insights Ein-
stein gave us will never fade.

Epistemological comment
Is general relativity veriﬁed? Is it falsiﬁed? Neither. Is it
veriﬁable? Is it falsiﬁable? Logically (not pragmatically)
speaking: Neither.
From a terminological point of view it must immedi-
ately be added that ‘veriﬁed’ is taken to be synonymous
with ‘shown or proven to be true’, and if a precisely formu-

12.12
Epistemological comment
503
lated proposition p is true, then, according to our concept
of truth, it cannot possibly be false, and further research is
therefore pointless. A corresponding terminology is pre-
supposed in relation to the term ‘falsiﬁed’. If something
is false, not only unanimously considered to be false, no
possibility of truth is present.
It is often held that theories in mathematical physics,
for instance general relativity as a set of propositions, p,
are falsiﬁable, but not veriﬁable. If p in these cases were
falsiﬁable through research, ‘p is false’ would have to be
a conclusion, formally correctly derived from true pre-
mises. If one or more premises are conjectural, ‘p is false’
is only hypothetical.
Theories in mathematical physics are very different
from generalizations from observations such as ‘all
ravens are black’.
Experimental setups are in modern
mathematical physics immensely complex.
The rele-
vance of a concrete, dateable experiment depends upon
the adequacy of the experimental design. The assertion
that a particular setup is adequate may be spelled out in
a series of propositions; q, r, s, . . ., connected with ‘and’.
The conclusion that p is false depends upon the truth of a
series of general propositions, many of them called ‘laws
of nature’, for instance mechanical and optical laws pre-
supposed valid when using a certain set of machinery
and apparatus in general. There is in short no deﬁnite
end of the series q, r, s, . . ., required as true premises, and

even if there were, many members of the series clearly
are propositions which are unveriﬁable. They are not all
shown or proven to be true. A whole paradigm of prac-
tice is involved.
The conclusion ‘p is false’ is therefore in the case of
p being a theory of mathematical physics, unfalsiﬁable.
Or, we do not see any surplus of good reasons or good
consequences from a decision to declare p to have been
falsiﬁed.
There is nothing regrettable in this lack of falsiﬁcation.
Research involves cases of conﬁmation and disconﬁrma-
tion, all more or less open to revision. Sometimes the se-
ries of kinds of disconﬁrmations are of such a consider-
able weight that it is absurd to continue experimenting.
The theory is with good reason abandoned, unfalsiﬁed.
Einstein admits of wonder. The theories of modern
mathematical physics are full of wonder. Nothing is ver-
iﬁed, nothing is falsiﬁed. Everything is in a process of
change and improvisation. Lucky are those who are in
the middle of the turmoil!

Chapter 13
Some applications of the
general theory of relativity
The ﬁrst eleven chapters of our text were devoted to the
development of the mathematical structure of Einstein’s
theory of relativity. In chapter 12 we discussed the phys-
ical principles of the theory. But there is a third region of
inquiry which the reader may want to enter: the multi-
tude of applications of the general theory. Applied to the
world of stars and galaxies, to our universe at large, new
insights are obtained, and new possibilities of phenom-
ena and objects that we may possibly discover observa-
tionally, are revealed. It is, for instance, a consequence of
the theory that there may exist black holes somewhere.
Unfortunately, the mathematical derivations of the
many astonishing and extremely interesting conse-
quences of the theory, are no less difﬁcult and complex

than what the reader has been through so far. However,
by means of a sufﬁcient number of small steps we can
reach what we want. To give you a choice in how to read
this chapter (and the next), we have chosen to place the
detailed calculations of the components of the Ricci cur-
vature tensor for the present applications, in Appendices
B and C.
Einstein devised, however, a method to extract some
essential consequences of the general theory without hav-
ing to solve the ﬁeld equations. One can start by ana-
lyzing physical phenomena in the ﬁcticious gravitational
ﬁelds that appear in accelerated and rotating reference
frames, and then by an application of the principle of
equivalence, deduce that the same effects that one found
would also take place in permanent gravitational ﬁelds
associated with massive bodies. The calculations are sim-
pler in such applications of the theory than in those that
involve the ﬁeld equations. In the next two sections we
shall demonstrate the power of this method, by deduc-
ing an expression for a relativistic effect called the gravi-
tational time dilation.
Of course this effect can also be deduced more rigor-
ously for permanent gravitational ﬁelds. In Sect. (13.4)
the expression for the gravitational time dilation shall be
deduced directly from the solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations outside a massive, spherical body.

13.1
Rotating reference frame
507
13.1
Rotating reference frame
Mathematically, the simplest and most interesting appli-
cation of Einstein’s ‘equivalence principle method’ is
based upon an analysis of clocks in a rotating reference
frame. In the present section we shall become familiar
with such a frame, which may be thought of as a merry-
go-round equipped with measuring rods and clocks.
We start by introducing an inertial reference frame I
in ﬂat spacetime, and consider clocks on a plane, circular
disk. We introduce plane polar coordinates r′ and θ′ in
I, and a time coordinate t′. The time t′ is measured on
clocks at rest in I. With these coordinates the inﬁnitesi-
mal radial distance is simply equal to the radial coordi-
nate differential dr′, and the distance along a circle with
radius r′ about the axis is r′dθ′ (from the deﬁnition of θ′
as measured in radians, see Sect. 4.1). Thus the line ele-
ment takes the form
ds2 = dr′2 + r′2dθ′2 −c2dt′2.
(13.1)
Then we introduce a second reference frame, R, which ro-
tates steadily. It may be thought of as a merry-go-round
with the axis of rotation at rest in I. A useful mental ex-
ercise is to imagine that you are an observer at rest in R.
Then you can think of the experience of being positioned
on a rotating merry-go-round of glass just above the in-
ertial disc I, so that you can compare the readings made

13.1
Rotating reference frame
508
with the measuring equipment in R and that in I. The
measuring equipment in R is represented by a comoving
system of plane polar coordinates r and θ in R, and time
coordinate t. We choose a coordinate time t that is per
deﬁnition measured by coordinate clocks that are adjusted
and synchronized so that they show the same time as the
non-rotating (inertial) clocks, i.e. t = t′.
We shall now deduce a coordinate transformation be-
tween comoving coordinates in I and R. Imagine a ra-
dial line representing θ = θ0 engraved on the merry-go-
round, and a similar line representing θ′ = θ′0 engraved
on the non-rotating plane disc in I. Let P be a point on
the line engraved on the rotating disc R of glass. In R this
point has a constant angular coordinate θ = θ0. In I the
radial line on the glass rotates so that its angular coordi-
nate increases as measured in I. The line in I coinsides
with that in R at a point of time t = 0.
We need to know a quantity called angular velocity. Or-
dinary velocity is a measure of how fast a particle moves
along a curve. Angular velocity, on the other hand, is a
measure of how fast a body rotates. The angular velocity
of R relative to I, ω, is deﬁned as the rate of change of
angle of the radial reference line in R as measured in I,
ω ≡dθ′
dt′ .
(13.2)
Making use of t′ = t and multiplying each side of the

13.1
Rotating reference frame
509
equation by dt we get
dθ′ = ω dt.
Steady rotation means that the angular velocity ω is con-
stant. Integration results in
θ′ = θ′
0 + ω t,
where θ′0 is a constant of integration. The angular coor-
dinate of the radial reference line in R is constant,
θ = θ0.
Since θ′0 = θ0 we get
θ′ = θ + ω t.
This is the coordinate transformation of the angular coor-
dinate between R and I.
Using the same radial coordinate in R and I, we can
write the coordinate transformation between R and I as
follows
r′ = r,
θ′ = θ + ω t,
and
t′ = t.
Differentiation gives
dr′ = dr,
dθ′ = dθ + ω dt,
and
dt′ = dt.

13.2
The gravitational time dilation
510
Inserting this into Eq. (13.1), we ﬁnd
ds2 = dr2 + r2 (dθ + ω dt)2 −c2 dt2
= dr2 + r2 dθ2 + r2ω2 dt2 −c2 dt2
+ 2 r2 ω dθ dt
= dr2 + r2 dθ2 −
 1 −r2ω2/c2
c2 dt2
+ 2 r2 ω dθdt.
(13.3)
In the following section we shall apply this line ele-
ment to show that the theory of relativity implies the ex-
istence of, and provides a formula for, a sort of time di-
lation that is different from the velocity dependent time
dilation of special relativity.
13.2
The gravitational time dilation
In order to discuss a possible position dependence of the
rate of time in the rotating reference frame, we need a po-
sition independent reference for the rate of time, i.e. a set
of clocks going equally fast irrespective of their position.
This is here represented by the rate of time as measured
on the coordinate clocks, because they go at the same rate
as the non-rotating clocks, and we know that their rate is
position independent.
The rate of time in any reference frame is represented
by the proper time τ. According to the deﬁnition (5.115)

13.2
The gravitational time dilation
511
a proper time interval dτ is given in terms of the line ele-
ment by
dτ2 = −(1/c2) ds2.
(13.4)
Clocks that measure dτ are called standard clocks. They
are ‘natural clocks’ that are not adjusted in any way as
they are moved to different positions. A standard clock
at a distance r from the axis, has at ﬁrst been adjusted
to go at a correct rate and to show the correct time (that
of the non-rotating clocks) while at the axis. Then it has
been moved slowly (so as not to be slowed down by the
special relativistic, velocity dependent time dilation) to
its position. When the clock is at rest in the rotating refer-
ence frame, its path through spacetime has dr = dθ = 0.
In this special case Eqs. (13.3) and (13.4) result in
dτ =
 1 −r2 ω2/c21/2 dt.
(13.5)
This formula shows that for a given value of dt the value
of dτ gets less with increasing value of r. Since the co-
ordinate clocks have a position independent rate, that of
the clock at the axis, this means that the standard clocks
are slower the further they are from the axis. The position
dependence of the rate of the standard clocks at rest in R
can be measured both by an observer at rest in I and one
at rest in R.
As observed from the inertial frame I, a clock at rest
in R moves along a circular path. According to the def-
inition (13.2) of angular velocity it passes over an angle

13.2
The gravitational time dilation
512
dθ′ = ω dt′ during a time dt′. The angle is measured
in radians (see Sect. 4.1), i.e. arclength divided by radius.
Thus, the distance covered by the clock during a time dt′
is dℓ′ = r dθ′ = rω dt′. The velocity of the clock is
v = dℓ′/dt′ = rω.
(13.6)
This equation says that the velocity of a particle moving
along a circular path is equal to the radius of the circle
times the angular velocity of the particle.
Using Eq. (13.6) we see that the special relativistic for-
mula for the velocity dependent time dilation, Eq. (5.100)
gives just Eq. (13.5). However, as observed from the ro-
tating frame R the clock is at rest. So the explanations
of the fact that the clocks further away from the axis are
slower, are different in the inertial frame and in the rotat-
ing frame.
Einstein’s explanation is as follows. An observer in
the rotating reference frame experiences an acceleration
of gravity directed away from the axis. In this ﬁeld ‘up’
is towards the axis, and ‘down’ away from the axis, since
a stone which we drop in the merry-go-round falls away
from the axis. And, said Einstein, a gravitational ﬁeld
due to the acceleration or rotation of the reference frame
is equivalent, in its action on both material systems, and
on the rate of time, to a gravitational ﬁeld due to masses.
This is a consequence of the principle of equivalence.
Thus, the position dependent rate of standard clocks in a

13.2
The gravitational time dilation
513
rotating reference frame is interpreted as a gravitational
effect. The conclusion is that the rate of time is slower far-
ther down in a gravitational ﬁeld. But as seen from below
time goes fast up there.
Note that in the theory of relativity the concepts ‘up’
and ‘below’ are deﬁned with respect to the ﬁeld of accel-
eration of gravity, experienced locally. This implies, for
example, that ‘upwards’ is oppositely directed in Nor-
way and Australia. A free particle falls downwards, by
deﬁnition.
In the case of the merry-go-round ‘down-
wards’ means farther away from the axis, r = 0.
The movements of the orchestra-conductor will ap-
pear faster than normal to the musicians of an orchestra
in an abnormally deep grave. And this, in fact, has the
remarkable effect that the orchestra plays at just the cor-
rect tempo as seen by the conductor. But the musicians
do not age as fast as the conductor.
In accordance with Einstein’s interpretation the grav-
itational time dilation can be expressed in terms of the
potential difference between two positions in a gravita-
tional ﬁeld. In order to calculate the potential of the grav-
itational ﬁeld experienced in R, we have to ﬁnd an ex-
pression for the acceleration of gravity in this ﬁeld. To do
this we have to ﬁnd the acceleration of an observer at rest
in R. Such an observer moves along a circular path with
constant velocity, given by Eq. (13.6), i.e.
⃗v = r ω⃗e ^θ′,

13.2
The gravitational time dilation
514
where ⃗e ^θ′ is a tangential unit vector.
According to
Eq. (4.45) the coordinate basis vector in this direction is
⃗eθ′ = r⃗e ^θ′, which gives
⃗v = ω⃗eθ′.
The acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, ⃗a =
d⃗v/dt. Therefore
⃗a = ω d⃗eθ′
dt′ .
(13.7)
The rate of change of the basis vector ⃗eθ′ along a circular
path is given by Eq. (6.17) with dr = 0. Hence
d⃗eθ′
dt′ = −r dθ′
dt′ ⃗er = −r ω⃗er.
Inserting this into Eq. (13.7) we get
⃗a = −r ω2 ⃗er.
(13.8)
This equation shows that the acceleration of observers at
rest in R is directed radially towards the centre of the disc.
Therefore it is called centripetal acceleration.
The acceleration of gravity, ⃗g, felt by an observer in R
is equal to his own acceleration, but oppositely directed,
i.e.
⃗g = −⃗a = r ω2 ⃗er.
(13.9)
In Newtonian theory it is called centrifugal acceleration,
and one introduces a force m⃗g which is called the cen-
trifugal force and is reckoned as a ﬁctive force, not a real

13.2
The gravitational time dilation
515
force. In general relativity one does not introduce any
ﬁctive force, and the acceleration ﬁeld ⃗g is reckoned as a
genuine gravitational ﬁeld on line with the gravitational
ﬁeld at the Earth.
We shall now calculate the potential in the gravita-
tional ﬁeld given by Eq. (13.9). This concept was intro-
duced in Sect. (12.4). The position with zero potential can
be chosen freely, and we choose to put the potential equal
to zero at the axis of the merry-go-round. Since the grav-
itational ﬁeld points radially outwards from the axis, all
points at the same distance from the axis has the same
value of the potential, equal, by deﬁnition, to the work
which must be performed to move a unit mass from the
axis to a distance r from the axis.
Work is deﬁned as force times distance. Usually the
force depends upon the position, so it is not possible to
calculate the work just by multiplying a certain value of
the force by the distance. The correct method is ﬁrst to
set up an expression for the work needed to move the
body an inﬁnitesimal distance, and then integrate over
the whole distance.
Imagine that a body is moved with constant velocity
from the axis to a point at a distance r from the axis. The
force that prevents the body from falling freely outwards
with increasing velocity, must act inwards. This force, per
unit mass, is −g. Thus the change of the potential during

13.2
The gravitational time dilation
516
a displacement dr is
dφ = −g dr.
(13.10)
Inserting g = r ω2 from Eq. (13.9) into Eq. (13.10) gives
dφ = −ω2 r dr.
This is the expression for the change of the potential dur-
ing an inﬁnitesimal radial displacement.
Integrating
from 0 to r, noting that ω is constant and using the rule
(3.33), we ﬁnd
φ = −ω2
Z r
0
r dr = −1
2 r2ω2.
This is the gravitational potential in R at a distance r from
the axis of rotation.
Substituting 2φ for −r2ω2 in Eq. (13.5), and noting
that the coordinate clocks in R have a position indepen-
dent rate equal to that of standard clocks at the axis, i.e.
dt = dτ0, we get
dτ =
 1 + 2φ/c21/2 dτ0,
(13.11)
where dτ0 refers to time as measured on a standard clock
at the position with zero potensial. Equation (13.11) is the
equation of the gravitational time dilation.
There are two conceptions of physical relationships
concerning gravitational phenomena, according to the

13.3
The Schwarzschild solution
517
general theory of relativity; the causal and the acausal.
According to the causal conception the position depen-
dent rate of time in a gravitational ﬁeld is an effect due
to gravity, i.e. gravity causes the gravitational time dila-
tion. The acausal conception is different. Time measures
in spacetime depend upon the position of the clock in a
gravitational ﬁeld. At each position there is a deﬁnite rate
of time; slower or more rapid. This has to do purely with
interrelations of time itself with no causality involved.
Whether one prefers the causal or the acausal point of
view is a matter of taste. The theory does not force any of
these conceptions upon us.
13.3
The Schwarzschild solution
Having arrived at Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, we may ask:
“Which are the solutions to this set of equations? What
are the properties of the spacetimes implied by these
equations?” The ﬁeld equations in the form (11.34) are
very general. They can describe all sorts of spacetimes:
ﬂat (Minkowski) spacetime, curved spacetime outside
massive particles, spacetime inside stars, cosmic space-
times in which space expands and so forth.
The solutions of the ﬁeld equations are the ten func-
tions that make up the components of the metric tensor.
The ﬁeld equations are a set of six second order partial
differential equations, and generally the ten metric com-

13.3
The Schwarzschild solution
518
ponents are functions of all four spacetime coordinates.
Six equations can only determine six of the metric
functions—fortunately.
This leaves us the freedom of
choosing a coordinate system appropriate for the space-
time which is to be investigated. Still, the mathematical
problem of solving the ﬁeld equations is often extremely
difﬁcult, and only for spacetimes with a high degree of
symmetry are we able to solve the equations in terms of
elementary functions.
The symmetry of a space means that the properties of
the space do not change under a certain motion. Think
of spacetime outside a particle, for example. Imagine a
spherical surface with centre on the particle. No proper-
ties of space change if you move from one point to an-
other arbitrary point on the surface. The metric is inde-
pendent of the position on the spherical surface. Then we
say that this space is spherically symmetric. This is the type
of spaces we shall consider in this chapter and the next.
A symmetry has important mathematical conse-
quences. It may simplify enormously the task of solv-
ing the ﬁeld equations. In the ﬁrst place the symmetry
suggests the type of coordinate system that one should
introduce and reduces the number of unknown metric
functions from six, to possibly only one or two, and sec-
ondly it implies that the components of the metric tensor
are functions not of all four spacetime coordinates, but
possibly only of one or two of the coordinates.

13.3
The Schwarzschild solution
519
In this chapter we shall consider spacetime outside a
static (i.e. time independent), spherically symmetric mass
distribution. In the case of ﬂat space one would then in-
troduce spherical coordinates, as given in Sect. 6.3. From
Eq. (6.22) we get grr = ⃗er · ⃗er = 1, gθθ = ⃗eθ · ⃗eθ = r2,
and gϕϕ = ⃗eϕ · ⃗eϕ = r2 sin2 θ. Hence, the line element of
Euclidean 3-dimensional space, as expressed in spherical
coordinates, is
dℓ2 = dr2 + r2 dθ2 + r2 sin2 θ dϕ2.
(13.12)
The line element of ﬂat spacetime, with these coordinates,
is
ds2 = dℓ2 −c2 dt2,
or
ds2 = dr2 + r2 dθ2 + r2 sin2 θ dϕ2 −c2dt2.
(13.13)
We know that there is a gravitational ﬁeld outside a mass
distribution. Spacetime is curved in such a region. Al-
lowing for this, we make a generalization of the form
(13.3) of the line element, writing
ds2 = eλ(r)dr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin2 θ dϕ2 −eν(r)c2dt2, (13.14)
where λ(r) and ν(r) are functions of r only. The letter
e = 2.71828 . . . in Eq. (13.14) has nothing to do with basis
vectors (no arrows!), but denotes the basis of the expo-
nential function (see Ch. 3). Instead of introducing just

13.3
The Schwarzschild solution
520
functions A(r) and B(r) we use the exponential form, be-
cause this simpliﬁes the ﬁeld equations. This is just a trick
which turns out to be very convenient.
The form (13.14) of the line element preserves the
spherical symmetry, and the time independence. The cor-
responding components of the metric tensor are
grr = eλ(r),
gθθ = r2,
gϕϕ = r2 sin2 θ,
gtt = −c2eν(r).
(13.15)
In the following we shall leave out the functional depen-
dence on r when we write the exponential functions eν
and eλ, but it is of course still understood that these ex-
pressions denote functions of r.
Since we are going to ﬁnd the geometry of the region
outside the mass distribution, we must solve the ﬁeld
equations (11.35) for vacuum, Rµν = 0.
Using Eqs. (B.17), (B.18) and (B.22) in Appendix B, the
vacuum ﬁeld equations for the static, spherically sym-
metric space may be written
Rtt/eν−λ = ν′′
2 −1

e−λ = 0.
(13.16c)
These differential equations shall now be solved.
In-
specting the equations we see that a simple equation is
obtained if the ﬁrst two of Eqs. (13.16) are added, namely
ν′ + λ′
r
= 0.
Consequently
ν′ + λ′ = (ν + λ)′ = 0.
Since the derivative of ν + λ vanishes, this quantity must
be equal to a constant, ν + λ = b, which is determined
from the condition that spacetime is ﬂat inﬁnitely far
from the mass distribution. Then the line element (13.14)
is reduced to the form (13.13) as r →∞. Since e0 = 1, this
means that ν and λ must vanish as r →∞. Consequently
b = 0 and
λ = −ν.
(13.17)
Inserting this in Eq. (13.16c), we get
1 −(1 + r ν′) eν = 0,
or
(1 + r ν′) eν = 1.
(13.18)

13.3
The Schwarzschild solution
522
According to the product rule for differentiation, and the
chain rule,
(r eν)′ = eν + r (eν)′ = eν + r eν ν′ = (1 + r ν′) eν.
Hence Eq. (13.18) can be written as
(r eν)′ = 1.
(13.19)
Since integration is ‘antiderivation’, the integral of the
left-hand side is equal to r eν. Integrating the right-hand
side by means of Eq. (3.33) with p = 0 (because x0 = 1),
we get the answer r + C, where C is a constant. Integra-
tion of Eq. (13.19) thus gives
r eν = r + C,
or
eν = 1 + C
r .
(13.20)
The constant C will be determined by considering the
Newtonian limit of general relativity (see Sect. 12.6). In
this limit the time-time component of the metric tensor is
written as
gtt = −c2 (1 −htt) .
(13.21)
The acceleration of gravity is given in terms of the deriva-
tive of the metric tensor by Eq. (12.21). In the present case
this equation is reduced to
a = c2
2 h′
tt.
(13.22)

13.3
The Schwarzschild solution
523
According to Eq. (12.7) (i.e. Newton’s law of gravitation)
the acceleration of gravity at a distance r outside a spher-
ical body with mass M, is
a = −G M
r2 .
(13.23)
The minus sign means that the acceleration points in the
direction of decreasing r. Putting the right-hand sides of
Eqs. (13.22) and (13.23) equal to each other, and solving
with respect to h′
tt, gives
htt′ = −2GM

r2.
We see that h′
tt is equal to a constant factor times 1/r2.
Integrating 1/r2 by means of Eq. (3.33), this time with p =
−2, (note that 1/r2 = r−2 and r−1 = 1/r) leads to
htt = 2GM
c2r
+ K.
(13.24)
The integration constant K is determined by the condition
that spacetime is ﬂat inﬁnitely far from the mass M. This
implies that htt →0 as r →∞, which is possible only if
K = 0. Inserting Eq. (13.24) with K = 0 into Eq. (13.21)
results in

This is the famous Schwarzschild solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations.
The Schwarzschild solution constitutes an expression
of the metric of spacetime, namely a relativistically valid
metric of a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, and
thereby also of the gravitational ﬁeld of the Sun. Since the
masses of the planets are much less than the mass of the
Sun, the Schwarzschild metric represents a good approx-
imation of the spacetime near the Sun, and is adequate to
describe the gravitational effects in the Solar system.
The quantity

13.3
The Schwarzschild solution
525
is a length which characterizes the mass of a body. It is
called the Schwarzschild radius of the body. Inserting val-
ues for Newton’s gravitational constant, the velocity of
light and the mass of the Sun, we get rS = 3 km for the
Sun. Thus the Schwarzschild radius of a body with mass
M is rS = (M/M⊙)3 km, where M⊙is the mass of the Sun.
The Earth, for example has a Schwarzschild radius equal
to 1 cm. A man with mass 100 kg has a Schwarzschild
radius equal to 1.5 × 10−25 m, which is very much less
that the radius of an atomic nucleus. The physical sig-
niﬁcance of the Schwarzschild radius will become clear
below, in connection with our discussion of black holes.
Inserting the expression (13.27) for the Schwarzschild
radius into Eq. (13.26), the Schwarzschild line element

(13.28)
At a large distance from a body compared to its Schwarz-
schild radius, r ≫rS, the line element is approximately
equal to Eq. (13.13) which represents ﬂat spacetime as ex-
pressed in spherical coordinates. At the surface of the
Earth, for example, rS/r ≈10−8, and at the surface of the

is weak in the whole of the Solar system. This is the rea-
son for the success of Newton’s theory of gravitation as

The Pound–Rebka experiment
It is a demonstration of the eminent ability of experimen-
tal physicists that they have managed to measure the
gravitational time dilation on the surface of the Earth in
an experiment with maximal extension 22.5 metres. It is
remarkable that this phenomenon was predicted by Ein-
stein 45 years before anybody was able to measure it. Let
us follow Einstein’s simple explanation.
Einstein argued that light waves (moving freely) can
neither vanish nor be created between the emitter and the
receiver. So, in a spacetime where nothing changes with
time, the same number of waves per second must arrive

13.4
The Pound–Rebka experiment
527
at the receiver as are sent out from the emitter. But, said
Einstein, this conclusion is correct only if a tacit assump-
tion is accepted, namely that the clocks at the emitter and
the receiver go equally fast.
Consider standard clocks spatially at rest in the
Schwarzschild spacetime. For these clocks dr = dθ =
dϕ = 0, and Eq. (13.28) is reduced to
ds2 = −

1 −rS

c2 dt.
(13.30)
According to Eq. (5.115) the proper time interval mea-
sured on the standard clocks is given by
dτ =
√
−ds2
c
.
Combining with Eq. (13.30) leads to
dτ =
r
1 −rS
r dt.
(13.31)
Since the Schwarzschild metric is static, the coordinate
clocks, showing the time t, must be synchronized and ad-
justed so that they go equally fast independently of their
position. From Eq. (13.31) we can therefore conclude that
the less r is, the slower the standard clocks go. In other
words time goes slower farther down in a gravitational
ﬁeld.

13.4
The Pound–Rebka experiment
528
Let us now return to Einstein’s argument. Assume
that light is emitted from a height h > 0 to the ﬂoor, at
h = 0. Since the standard clocks at the ﬂoor are slower
than those at the height h, one measures that more light
waves arrive at the receiver per second than are emittet
at the height h. Einstein therefore concluded that one
would measure a frequency increase at the receiver; a
blue shift of the light.
Pound and Rebka performed the experiment in 1960
with h = 22.5 metres.
If rS and R are the Schwarzschild radius and radius of
the Earth, respectively, the proper time interval dτR at the
receiver and dτE at the emitter, are given by
dτR =
r
1 −rS
R dt
and
dτE =
r
1 −
rS
R + h dt.
Since rS = 1 cm and R = 6300 km we have x ≡rS/R =
1.5 × 10−9. We can therefore, with sufﬁcient accuracy, use
the approximation
√
1 −x ≈1 −x/2, obtained by retain-
ing the ﬁrst two terms of the MacLaurin series, Eq. (2.84),

emitter, respecively.
The ‘blue shift’ of the light is denoted by z and deﬁned
by
z ≡dτE −dτR

.
Inserting the expressions (13.32), and approximating the
denominator by dt (which is permissible since the nu-

The special relativistic velocity dependent time dilation
and the general relativistic (gravitational) position depen-
dent time dilation are physically different. But sometimes
they occur together, for example when one travels in an
airplane.
In the Hafele–Keating experiment both types of time
dilations were demonstrated by travelling around the
Earth with caesium clocks in Jumbo-jets, comparing the
travelling time as measured with these clocks, with that
measured on a similar clock positioned at the airport. We
shall calculate what general relativity predicts for this ex-
periment.
According to Eq. (5.115) the proper time, i.e. the time
shown by an ordinary clock, is given in terms of the line
element by
dτ =
√
−ds2

Inserting the general expression for the line element from

Specializing to the diagonal metric of orthogonal coordi-
nate systems, we get

(−gµµ)(dxµ)2.
The summation over µ goes over the four values 1, 2, 3,
and 4. In this sum with four terms we write ﬁrst the term
with µ = 4, and then use Einstein’s summation conven-
tion with µ = i for the remaining three terms. The fourth
coordinate is x4 = c t (see Sect. 12.6). Thus

inside the square root, it becomes 1/c2. We then have

(13.33)
According to Eq. (4.7) the square of the velocity is the
scalar product of the velocity vector by itself
v2 = ⃗v ·⃗v.
From Eq. (1.26) we get
v2 = gijvivj.
In the case of a diagonal metric this is reduced to
v2 = gii(vi)2.
Inserting this into Eq. (13.33) leads to
dτ =

(13.34)
We now assume that spacetime outside the Earth is
adequately modelled by the Schwarzschild solution of
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, Eq. (13.28).

This is an expression of the time dilation that includes
both the velocity dependent time dilation of special rel-
ativity and the position dependent (gravitational) time
dilation of general relativity. In the case of a vanishing
gravitational ﬁeld, rS = 0, and Eq. (5.117) is recovered,
and in the case of a clock at rest, v = 0, Eq. (13.31) is re-
covered.
In the Hafele–Keating experiment one clock was at
rest at the airport and one was travelling around the
Earth, once westwards and once eastwards. Let Ωbe the
angular velocity of the Earth due to its daily rotation, and
R the radius of the Earth. A point on the Equator moves
with angular velocity Ωalong a circle with radius R. Ac-
cording to Eq. (13.2) a satellite at rest relative to the sur-
face of the Earth at a height h above the surface, has a
velocity (R + h) Ω. Using the Galilean law of velocity ad-
dition, valid for velocities small compared to the velocity
of light, an airplane ﬂying with velocity u relative to the
surface of the Earth at a height h, has a velocity
v = (R + h) Ω+ u.

13.5
The Hafele–Keating experiment
534
Inserting this, and the expression (13.27), with M equal
to the mass of the Earth and r = R + h, into Eq. (13.36),
we get
dτ =

(R + h) c2 −[(R + h) Ω+ u]2

The clock at the airport has h = u = 0, which gives
dτ0 =

In order to simplify the calculation we1 now assume
that the airplanes travel with constant velocity and height
just above the Equator. Choosing positive u in the same
direction that the Earth rotates in, u > 0 for a clock trav-
elling eastwards and u < 0 for a clock travelling west-
wards.
The difference between the travelling times as
measured by the air-borne clocks, and as measured by
1Actually, Hafele and Keating integrated the equations numerically along the
travelling routes, but the result we obtain by our analytical calculation is sufﬁ-
ciently accurate to agree with the results of the numerical calculations within the
measuring uncertainty.

These predictions were conﬁrmed by the measurements
with about 20% accuracy.
13.6
Mercury’s perihelion precession
The planets move along elliptic orbits around the Sun.
However the ellipses are not exactly closed. The point
closest to the Sun gets a small displacement for each
round. The closest point to the Sun is called perihelion,

13.6
Mercury’s perihelion precession
536
and the mentioned displacement is called the precession
of the perihelion.
We shall consider the motion of the innermost planet
Mercury. For this planet the precession is 532′′per cen-
tury = 532 seconds of arc per century. Of this 489′′ per
century could be accounted for by Newton’s theory of
gravitation. It is an effect of the other planets upon Mer-
cury. However 43′′ per century could not be accounted
for by Newton’s theory.
Mercury moves along a geodesic curve in the
Schwarzschild spacetime outside the Sun. We choose the
orientation of the coordinate system so that Mercury
moves in the equatorial plane, θ = π/2. The spacetime
is static and spherically symmetric. Thus, the metric is
independent of the coordinates t and ϕ. It follows from
the geodesic equation in the form (12.44) that ut and uϕ
are constants of motion of Mercury.
The most efﬁcient way of solving the geodesic equa-
tion, is to insert the constants of motion into the four ve-
locity identity (12.38), which in the present case takes the
form
urur + uϕuϕ + utut = −c2.
(13.37)
Here ur = dr/dτ. Since the metric is diagonal, we get
from Eqs. (5.75) and (5.76),
ur = grrur,

uϕ = gϕϕuϕ = uϕ/gϕϕ,

In this equation the radial coordinate of Mercury is to be

This equation of motion can be solved to ﬁnd y and there-
by r as a function of time. However, what interests us
here is the shape of the trajectory followed by Mercury.
We would like to know r as a function of the angle ϕ
rather than as a function of time. Therefore we introduce
ϕ as a variable instead of τ. The connection between ϕ
and τ is given by Eq. (13.38b). Noting that uϕ = dϕ/dτ
and gϕϕ = r2 in the equatorial plane, we get
dϕ
dτ = gϕϕuϕ = uϕ
gϕϕ

and

From observations we know that the trajectory of Mer-
cury is a nearly circular ellipse. Thus we are not inter-
ested in ﬁnding the general solution of Eq. (13.41). We
want to ﬁnd a nearly circular solution.
Putting
d2y/dϕ2 = 0 in Eq. (13.41), we ﬁnd that it has a solu-
tion representing a circle with inverse radius y0 given by
y0 = a + b y2
0.
(13.42)
With a small deviation from circular motion, the value of
y is changed from y0 by a small amount, which we denote
by y1, i.e. y1 ≪y0. Inserting y = y0 + y1 into Eq. (13.41)

13.6

we get

Subtracting Eq. (13.42) gives
d2y1
dϕ2 + y1 = 2 b y0 y1 + b y2
1.
Since y1 ≪y0, we ignore the last term, and arrive at the
equation
d2y1
dϕ2 + y1 ≈2 b y0 y1.
Subtracting 2 b y0 y1 on each side of the equation we get
d2y1
dϕ2 + (1 −2 b y0 ) y1 ≈0.
Deﬁning
f ≡

1 −2 b y0,
(13.43)
and reintroducing the equality sign, this equation takes
the form
d2y1
dϕ2 + f2 y1 = 0.
(13.44)
We shall show that the function
˜y1 = ϵ y0 cos(fϕ),
(13.45)

13.6
Mercury’s perihelion precession
541
where ϵ is a constant, is a solution of Eq. (13.44). Differ-
entiation by means of Eq. (4.25) and the chain rule (2.31)
we get
d˜y1
dϕ = −ϵ y0 f sin(f ϕ).
One more differentiation gives
d2 ˜y1
dϕ2 = −ϵ b f2 cos(f ϕ).
Inserting ˜y1 from Eq. (13.45) leads to
d2 ˜y1
dϕ2 = −f2 ˜y1,
which for y1 = ˜y1 is equivalent to Eq. (13.44).
We have then found the solution for the trajectory of
Mercury
y = y0 + y1 = y0 [1 + ϵ cos(f ϕ)]
or
1
r = 1
r0
[1 + ϵ cos(f ϕ)] .
For f = 1, i.e. b = 0, this expression describes an elliptic
orbit which is ﬁxed in space, since the minimum value
of r would then always take place at the same position,
when the angle has increased by ϕ = 2π. This corre-
sponds to the Newtonian case. However, taking the rela-
tivistic effect into account, Mercury has to move an angle

13.6
Mercury’s perihelion precession
542
ϕ so that f ϕ = 2π, before it returns to the point closest to
the Sun, i.e. it must move an angle ϕ = 2π/f. Thus, Mer-
cury moves not 2π between each time it passes the point
where it is closest to the Sun, but 2π plus an extra angle
∆ϕ = 2π (1/f −1).
(13.46)
This is the precession angle per orbit.

Eq. (13.46) by the expression (13.43) gives

expression,
1
√1 −2 b y0
≈1 + b y0.
Substituting this into Eq. (13.47) we arrive at
∆ϕ = 2π b y0.
Replacing b by (3/2)rS (see Eq. (13.41)) ﬁnally gives
∆ϕ = 3π rS y0 = 3π(rS/r0)
per revolution. Here rS is the Schwarzschild radius of
the Sun, and r0 is the radius of the nearly circular or-
bit of Mercury. Inserting numerical values gives ∆ϕ =
5.03 × 10−7 radians per revolution. This corresponds to a
precession of 43′′ per century!

Gravitational deﬂection of light
One of the ﬁrst predictions Einstein made from his gen-
eral theory of relativity was that light grazing the Sun
should be deﬂected by 1.75′′. In this section we shall see
how this prediction can be calculated.
In Sect. 5.12 we saw that a light-like interval has ds2 =
0. This means that in the case of light, Eq. (13.37) is re-
placed by
urur + uϕuϕ + utut = 0.
Consequently the equation of the trajectory of photons in
the Schwarzschild spacetime is obtained by putting a = 0
in Eq. (13.41),
d2y
dϕ2 + y = by2.
(13.48)
We are not interested in the general solution of this equa-
tion. Light grazing the Sun is deﬂected by a very small
amount. The trajectory of this light is nearly a straight
line. From Fig. 13.1 is seen that
cos ϕ = R/r,
or, denoting the y function representing this line by y0,
y0 = 1
r = cos ϕ
R
.
(13.49)
This function has the same form as ˜y1 of Eq. (13.45). Ac-
cordingly it fulﬁlls an equation of the same form as

Since we seek a solution close to the straight line, we can
write
y = y0 + y1,
y1 ≪y0.
(13.51)
Inserting this into Eq. (13.48) leads to
d2y0
dϕ2 + d2y1
dϕ2 + y0 + y1 = b (y0 + y1)2 .
Subtracting Eq. (13.50) we get

dϕ2 + y1 = b (y0 + y1)2 .
At the right-hand side we can neglect y1 compared to y0,
d2y1
dϕ + y1 = b y2

(13.52)
Due to the appearance of the function cos2 ϕ at the right-

lution may be written
y1 = A + B cos2 ϕ,
(13.53)
where A and B are constants, which we shall try to deter-
mine so that the expression (13.53) do satisfy Eq. (13.52).
Differentiating the expression (13.53) by means of the
chain rule (2.31) with y = u2, u = cos ϕ and x = ϕ, using
Eq. (2.36) with n = 2 and Eq. (4.25), we obtain

In order that the left-hand and right-hand sides of this

cos ϕ∞= cos(π/2 + ∆ϕ)

Since cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1, Eq. (13.59) reduces

cos ϕ∞= −∆ϕ.
Equation (13.58) then takes the form
0 = −∆ϕ

Because ∆ϕ ≪1, we can neglect the term (∆ϕ)2 inside
the parenthesis. This leads to
∆ϕ = 2b

From Fig. 13.1 is seen that the deﬂection of the light is
twice this angle

Inserting the value b = (3/2)rS from Eq. (13.41) we ﬁnally
arrive at
∆ϕtot = 2rS

Here rS is the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun, and R is
the actual radius of the Sun. Inserting numerical values
gives ∆ϕtot = 8.48 × 10−6 radians = 1.75′′.

We shall now investigate the spacetime outside a mas-
sive spherical body with mass M by considering light
cones in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It will be sufﬁ-
cient for our purposes to ﬁnd the intersections of the light
cones by the (r, t)-plane. In other words we shall inves-
tigate radially moving photons, such that dθ = dϕ = 0
along the photon worldlines. Furthermore, since photons
follow null geodesics, their equations of motion are ob-
tained by putting ds2 = 0 in the Schwarzschild line ele-
ment, Eq. (13.26). This gives

(13.60)
This is the coordinate velocity of light. The velocities of
ingoing and outgoing photons are the same.
As r in-
creases the velocity approaches the special-relativistic
value, c. But for r = rS we get dr/dt = 0. As shown
by Eq. (13.60) both the ingoing and outgoing coordinate
velocity of light vanish at r = rS, and the light cone of a
source at this position degenerates to a line. This aston-
ishing conclusion is due to the choice of coordinates, and
indicates that the chosen coordinates are not suitable for
describing the propagation of light in the vicinity of the
Schwarzschild radius.
We want to use coordinates such that the light cone
is open for ingoing light passing the Schwarzschild ra-
dius. A suitable time coordinate for this purpose is called
‘the ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein coordinate’. It can be
found by integrating the equation of motion of a radially
ingoing light signal, Eq. (13.60), with the minus sign. This
equation may be written as
1
1 −rS/r dr = −c dt.
Multiplying the numerator and the denominator by r we

get
r
r −rS
dr = −c dt.
(13.61)
In order to facilitate integration of this equation we write
r
r −rS

rS

Both these terms can be integrated by means of the rules
in chapter 3. Putting rS in front of the integral, since it is

(13.62)
In the ﬁrst term on the left-hand side we note that the
integral of dr is r, in the second term we use the rule (3.55)
with u = r −rS (note that u′ = (r −rS)′ = r′ = 1 since
the derivative of the constant rS is zero), and at the right-
hand side of Eq. (13.62) we note that the integral of dt is
t. Including a constant of integration K, we ﬁnd
r + rS ln |r −rS| = −c t + K.
(13.63)

13.8

We now introduce a new time coordinate ¯t such that
the equation of motion of a radially moving ingoing pho-
ton takes the very simple form
r = −c ¯t.
(13.64)
In the (r, ¯t) coordinate system the coordinate velocity of
an ingoing photon is constant and equal to c. Putting
K = 0, Eq. (13.63) can be written
r = −c t −rS ln |r −rS|.
Comparing with Eq. (13.64) we see that the new time co-
ordinate is related to the old one by
¯t = t + rS
c ln |r −rS|.
(13.65)
This is the announced ‘ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein
time coordinate’. Note that the clocks that measure the
new time coordinate ¯t are not synchronized with the
clocks that measure the Schwarzschild time coordinate,
since ¯t depends upon the position even if t = constant.
The physical signiﬁcance of this new time coordinate is
that the velocity of radially ingoing light in the Schwarz-
schild spacetime is constant and equal to c as measured
with these clocks (see Eq. (13.64)).
In order to ﬁnd how an outgoing photon moves in the
(r, ¯t) system we ﬁrst have to express the line element of

13.8
Black holes
552
the Schwarzschild solution, Eq. (13.26), by these coordi-
nates. This means that we must calculate dt expressed by
d¯t. We therefore solve Eq. (13.65) with respect to t (and
multiply, for later convenience, each term by c),
c t = c ¯t −rS ln |r −rS|.

Like Eq. (13.26) this line element represents the Schwarz-

new time coordinate ¯t.
The line element reduces to
Eq. (13.13) representing ﬂat spacetime, in the limit r →
∞, i.e. inﬁnitely far from the mass M, or if rS = 0, i.e. if
the mass M is removed.
We shall now consider photons moving along a radial
coordinate axis. Photons follow null geodesic curves (see
Ch. 5). Therefore the path of a photon is found by putting
ds2 = 0. Since we are considering photons moving radi-
ally, dθ = dϕ = 0 in the line element (13.66). This results

In order to solve this equation with respect to x we shall
ﬁrst show how one can construct a quadratic term from
the two terms containing x. Multiplying (13.67a) by 4a,
we get
4 a2 x24 a b x + 4 a d = 0.
We now use a trick that sometimes leads to a simpliﬁ-
cation, that of adding and subtracting a suitably chosen
term. In the present case the term b2 is chosen in order to
write the resulting ﬁrst three terms as one quadratic term.
Adding and subtracting b2 leads to
4 a2 x2 + 4 a b x + b2 + 4 a d −b2 = 0
or
(2 a x + b)2 + 4 a d −b2 = 0
where we have used the rule u2 + 2uv + v2 = (u + v)2.
Then
(2 a x + b)2 = b2 −4 a b.
Taking the square root
2 a x + b = ±

out = c, showing that in this
case the velocity of ingoing and outgoing light is the
same. This is quite natural since spacetime is ﬂat in this
case, making the special theory of relativity govern the
scene. Equation (13.70) shows that the velocity of an in-
going photon is constant and equal to c, in accordance
with the deﬁning equation (13.64). On the other hand,
the velocity of an outgoing photon varies with the ra-
dial position. This is different from in the special theory.
The light cones corresponding to Eq. (13.70) are drawn in
Fig. 13.2.
The properties of the drawing follow from the expres-
sions for the photon velocities in Eq. (13.70). The inward
cut of the light cone with the plane of the paper, which
represents an ingoing photon, makes an angle equal to
45 degrees with the time axis, independently of the po-
sition of the emitter, since the inward velocity of light
is equal to c at all distances in these coordinates. How-
ever, the outward velocity, given by the second expres-
sion in Eq. (13.70) is less that c. So the outward cut of
the cone with the plane of the paper, makes an angle
with the time axis which is less than 45 degrees. But in
the limit of large r, i.e. far away from the mass distribu-
tion, the velocity of outgoing photons approach c, and
the cut makes nearly 45 degrees with the time axis. At
the Schwarzschild radius rS the numerator in the second
expression in Eq. (13.70) is equal to zero. This means that

13.8
Black holes
558

zon of a black hole

13.8
Black holes
559
even a photon that is emitted radially outwards from this
position, will not be able to move outwards. Thus the
outward cut of the light cone is parallel to the time axis
for an emitter at this position. In the case of an emitter
inside the Schwarzschil radius, r < rS, the velocity of the
outgoing photon is negative. This means that a photon
emitted outwards from such a position will nevertheless
move inwards.
This is shown in the ﬁgure where the
whole light cone leans inwards for r < rS.
From the discussion in Sect. 5.13 we know that all par-
ticles of the observed universe move so that their world-
lines are inside the light cones. This means that what-
ever superb rockets you may possess, if your rocket ship
comes inside the Schwarzschild radius there is no way
out. And worse still, you cannot even send a message
for help out of the region inside the Schwarzschild ra-
dius. No information can reach from this region to the
outside world. Therefore the spherical surface with ra-
dius r = rS is called the Schwarzschild horizon. Since, as
seen from the outside, no light comes from the inside, this
region is called a black hole.
Black holes, that may exist according to the general
theory of relativity, have probably been located in double
star systems, with one invisible star seemingly disturbing
the appearance of the visible star. The most prominent
candidate is Cygnus X-1.
If the existence of black holes is conﬁrmed beyond

13.8
Black holes
560
any reasonable doubt, there is ample reason to enjoy a
feeling of excitement. One would then experience one of
those seldom events that make vivid what Einstein meant
when he said: “The most incomprehensible thing about
the world is that it is comprehensible”. For the man who
invented the theory it would be astonishing.
Nothing
like black holes was thought of when the theory was con-
structed. It was a question of making a theory of space,
time and gravitation in accordance with the most natu-
ral (for Einstein) and general principles: the principle of
relativity, the principle of the local constancy of the veloc-
ity of light and the principle of equivalence. Eighty years
of work by hundreds of physicists has proved that the
theory has a vast manifold of interesting physical conse-
quences. And it may be felt like a wonder: nature seems
to obey the theory!
Still Einstein felt like Newton: to be playing along the
shore of an ocean of ignorance. He did not rest, but went
on along the shore, venturing further out into the ocean
than most others. His goal was no less than a uniﬁed the-
ory of the known fundamental forces, from which all the
observable properties of the material world could be de-
duced. During the last thirty years of his life he searched
for such a theory. Physicists are still searching for it.

Chapter 14
Relativistic universe mod-
els
Cosmology may be said to be that part of physical sci-
ence that aims at giving a description of the universe at
large. Such descriptions are called universe models, and
are mathematical models interpreted physically. They are
based upon observations and physical laws. These laws
represent our deepest insights as to the behaviour of the
material world. They are the main contents of the physi-
cal theories.
By giving the laws mathematical formulations, one
may calculate from the laws how the matter behaves un-
der given circumstances, and thus predict the behaviour
of different types of models. Comparing such predictions
with observations, one may obtain an idea of the validity
and scope of our conceptions concerning the universe.

14.1
Observations
During the last 60 years or so one has observed processes
in parts of the universe by means of large optical tele-
scopes,
radio telescopes and spaceborn observation
equipment, in particular the Hubble telescope. These ob-
servations have suggested several simple properties of
the universe as a whole.
Distances.
The velocity of light in vacuum is approxi-
mately c = 300, 000 km/s, which corresponds to travel-
ling 7 times around the Earth per second. The light uses
8 minutes from the Sun to the Earth. The distance that
light travels during one year is called a light year, and
is equal to 9.46 × 1015 m. Our nearest star, Alpha Cen-
tauri, is about 4 light years away from us. This is much
farther away than it sounds when we use light year as
distance unit. Imagine a spacecraft travelling with a ve-
locity 100 km/s. The spacecraft would pass the Sun after
20 days and nights, but it would take 12,000 years before
the spacecraft arrives at the nearest star.
Our planetary system is positioned in an arm of a spi-
ral galaxy, the Milky Way, about 100.000 light years from
its centre. There are about 1011 stars in our galaxy, and
there are presumably a similar number of galaxies in the
universe. Our nearest galaxy is the Andromeda galaxy. It
is about 2.5 × 106 light years from the Milky Way to the

14.1
Observations
563
Andromeda galaxy. The galaxies are collected in clusters
of galaxies. The mean distance between the galaxy clus-
ters is about 108 light years. The farthest objects observed
have a distance about 1010 light years from us.
Large scale homogeneity.
Observations seem to indi-
cate that over distances larger than about 109 light years
the material of the universe is uniformly distributed. On
such a scale the universe is usually assumed to be ho-
mogeneous. The validity of this assumption has, how-
ever, been discussed recently on the basis on new three-
dimensional surveys of the distribution of matter in the
universe.
Isotropy.
The distribution of galaxies seems to be equal
in all directions on a large scale, i.e. the distribution is
isotropic. The isotropy of the universe on a large scale
has been conﬁrmed by observations of the cosmic back-
ground radiation. Its spectral distribution corresponds
to black body radiation with a temperature 2.726 K (see
Fig. 14.1).
Expansion.
From 1925 to 1930 Edwin Hubble observed
the spectral lines in the light from galaxies far away. He
also estimated the distances to the galaxies by astrophys-
ical methods. The result of these investigations is that

14.1
Observations
564
Figure 14.1:
Frequency distribution of cosmic back-
ground radiation

14.1

565
the spectral lines corresponding to known atomic transi-
tions are displaced towards red, i.e. towards longer wave-
lengths, and that this red shift is proportional to the dis-
tances of the galaxies. This is called Hubble’s law.
Figure 14.2: Doppler effect
The simplest explanation of this ‘law’ is that it is due
to the Doppler effect, indicating that the galaxies are
moving away from us, and faster the farther away they
are (see Fig. 14.2). Thus, the universe expands.
According to Newtonian kinematics such an expan-
sion of at least a universe of ﬁnite extension implies the
existence of a centre from which everything expands.
This is not so according to the conceptions of the gen-
eral theory of relativity. As we have seen, space is curved
according to this theory. The two-dimensional analogue

14.2
Homogeneous and isotropic models
566
of a ﬁnite isotropic universe is an expanding spherical
surface. The galaxies may be imagined as dots painted
on the surface. The distances between the dots increase
due to the expansion. But the dots do not move on the
surface. Neither is there any centre on the surface. Sim-
ilarly there is no centre in the homogeneous relativistic
universe models.
14.2
Homogeneous
and
isotropic
universe models
In 1922 the Russian meteorologist A. Friedmann found a
set of solutions to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, describing
expanding universes. The models of Friedmann are simi-
lar in all directions and at all points, i.e. they are isotropic
and homogeneous. This seems to be in agreement with
the observed properties of our universe on a large scale.
It should be noted, however, that there is an ongoing dis-
cussion concerning a possible hierarchical structure of the
distribution of matter on a large scale.
The homogeneous and isotropic universe models of
Friedmann are the the simplest relativistic models. They
have dominated the large scale modelling of the universe
for the last seventy years. In order to become familiar
with the research region termed relativistic cosmology, one
should at ﬁrst make oneself familiar with the Friedmann

14.2
Homogeneous and isotropic models
567
models. And we shall restrict ourselves to these models
in the present text.
However, the models have important limitations as
to their ability to explain observed properties of the uni-
verse, such as homogeneity and isotropy, because of the
following circumstance: If one wants to explain a certain
observed property of the universe, one has to investigate
sufﬁciently general theoretical models, which permit the
universe not to have this property. More general models
have been constructed, but they are mathematically more
complicated than the ones we shall consider.
The curvature of space at a certain moment in a Fried-
mann model, is constant. In order to gradually develop
some visual notions about spaces with constant curva-
ture, we shall start by considering a two-dimensional
space with constant positive curvature, a spherical sur-
face (see Fig. 14.3).
The line element of ﬂat three-dimensional space, as
expressed in a spherical coordinate system, is given in
Eq. (13.12). Let us consider a spherical surface with ra-
dius R. On this surface the line element is reduced to
dσ2 = R2 dθ2 + R2 sin2 θ dϕ2.
(14.1)
Here θ represents the latitude with θ = 0 at the North
Pole, and ϕ represents the longitude. The position of a
point on the spherical surface is given by specifying θ
and ϕ. We now replace the coordinate θ by a radial co-

14.2

568
Figure 14.3: Spherical surface

14.2

569
ordinate r representing the distance from the axis pass-
ing through the poles to a point on the spherical surface.
From Fig. 14.3 and the formula (4.1a) for the sinus of an
angle, follows
sin θ = r/R
(14.2)
or
r = R sin θ.
(14.3)
Note that r is a function of θ alone since R is constant.
Differentiation by means of Eq. (4.24), then gives
dr
dθ = R cos θ
or
dr
cos θ = R dθ.
Squaring, and exchanging the left-hand and right-hand
sides, we have
R2 dθ2 =
dr2
cos2 θ.
(14.4)
From Eq. (4.11) follows
cos2 θ = 1 −sin2 θ.
(14.5)
Substituting the expression (14.2) for sin θ in Eq. (14.5)
leads to
cos2 θ = 1 −r2/R2.

14.2
Homogeneous and isotropic models
570
Inserting this into Eq. (14.4) we get
R2 dθ2 =
dr2
1 −r2/R2.
(14.6)
Inserting the right-hand side of Eq. (14.6) and the left-
hand side of Eq. (14.3) into Eq. (14.1) leads to
dσ2 =
dr2
1 −r2/R2 + r2 dθ2.
In chapter 9, after Eq. (9.12), we found that the internal
curvature of a spherical surface with radius R is k = 1/R2.
Thus the line element on the spherical surface may be
written as
dσ2 =
dr2
1 −k r2 + r2 dθ2.
(14.7)
This form of the line element is obviously valid also for
a plane, which has k = 0, since Eq. (14.7) then reduces
to the line element (5.105) of an Euclidean plane, as ex-
pressed in plane polar coordinates. It is also valid for
surfaces of constant negative curvature, k < 0.
The line element (13.12) is a generalization of ﬂat
three-dimensional space of the line element (5.105) for
a (two-dimensional) plane. Similarly, the generalization
of (14.7) to a line element, which we call d b2, for three-
dimensional space with constant curvature, is
db2 =
dr2
1 −k r2 + r2 dθ2 + r2 sin2 θ dϕ2.
(14.8)

14.2
Homogeneous and isotropic models
571
We shall consider an expanding universe. Our coordinate
system is chosen such that the galaxies have ﬁxed spa-
tial coordinates. The quantity db, which appears squared
in Eq. (14.8), is the coordinate distance between the ori-
gin of the coordinate system and a point with coordinates
(dr, dθ, dϕ). The physical distance is
dl = a(t) db,
where the function a(t) is a so-called scale factor, which
tells us how the distance to a galaxy changes with time.
No direction is preferred.
Assuming that the function
a(t) increases with time, there is an isotropic expansion.
In order to write the full line element for spacetime,
we must specify what sort of coordinate clocks is to be
used. Choosing a coordinate time that is equal to the time
as measured by standard clocks carried by the galaxies,
the line element of spacetime takes the form

Appendix C. In particular Γ rtt = 0, and this will prove
to be of physical signiﬁcance. In Sect. 12.8 we showed
that free particles follow geodesic curves in spacetime.
Consider a free particle instantaneously at rest. From the
isotropy of the models follows that the particle has no ac-
celeration in the θ and ϕ directions. The r component of
the geodesic equation (8.7) is

where τ is the proper time of the particle. Since the parti-
cle is instantaneously at rest, the only non vanishing com-
ponent of the four velocity (see Eq. (10.21)) is the time
component dt/dτ. Thus Eq. (14.11) is reduced to
d2r

= 0.
Since Γ rtt = 0 it follows that
d2r
dτ2 = 0.
Thus the particle has no acceleration. Therefore it will
remain at rest in the coordinate system. This implies that
particles with constant spatial coordinates are freely mov-
ing. We can therefore identify such ‘particles’ with the
galaxies. This means that our coordinate system is co-
moving with the galaxies. Thus the scale factor a(t) tells
how the galaxies move. According to our conceptions the
movement is not imagined as a movement through space,
but signiﬁes the expansion of space itself.
We now come to the ﬁeld equations. Inserting the ex-
pression (12.31) for Einstein’s gravitational constant into
Eq. (11.34), the ﬁeld equations take the form
Rµν = 8πG

The left-hand side, i.e. the needed components of the
Ricci tensor have been calculated in Appendix C. The

14.3
Einstein’s cosmological ﬁeld equations
574
right-hand side of the ﬁeld equations involves the
energy-momentum tensor of the matter. We assume that
the cosmic matter is homogeneous, and may be repre-
sented as a perfect ﬂuid. This means that the only phys-
ical properties of the matter that we take account of, is
its motion, the density and the pressure or tension. Vis-
cosity, for example, is neglected. The energy-momentum
tensor of a perfect ﬂuid is given in Eq. (10.35). Lowering
the indices we obtain
Tµν =
 ρ + p/c2
uµuν + p gµν.
According to the deﬁnition (10.21) the contravariant com-
ponents of the four velocity are
uµ = dxµ
dτ .
Since the galaxies are at rest in the coordinate system,
only the time component is non-vanishing
ut = dt
dτ.
According to our choice of coordinate time, dt = dτ,
which leads to
ut = 1.
Lowering the index, we get
ut = gtt ut = −c2.

the energy-momentum tensor is

where we have used Eq. (5.79) in the last term. From
Eqs. (10.21) and (10.22) follow that the square of the four
velocity is
uµuµ = −c2.
According to Eq. (11.2) δµµ = 4. Therefore
T =

14.4
Physical properties of the Fried-
mann models
Let us ﬁrst ﬁnd which type of expansion these models
have.
For this purpose we consider models with
Euclidean spatial geometry, k = 0. From the line element
(14.9) follows that for such models the physical distance
from the origin to a galaxy with radial coordinate r is
ℓ= a(t) r.
The expansion velocity of the galaxy is
v = ˙l = ˙a r = ˙a
a a r = ˙a
a ℓ.
From this follows that the velocity of the galaxy is pro-
portional to the distance. As mentioned above, this is
called Hubble’s law. His many observations of the spectral

14.4
The Friedmann models
578
lines in the light from the galaxies suggested the hypoth-
esis that there exists such a law. More recent observations
support this.
Deﬁning the so-called Hubble factor,
H ≡˙a
a,
(14.16)
the Hubble law can be written as
v = H ℓ.
Note that for most universe models the Hubble factor is
a function of the time.
The present value H0 of the Hubble factor, as deter-
mined from observations, is
H0 = h 30 km/s
106 l.y. ,
(14.17)
where h is a factor with a value limited by observations
to the interval 0.5 < h < 1. The magnitude of the allowed
values for h represents the uncertainty in the value of
the Hubble factor. The most recent measurements (1997)
point at h = 0, 6 as the most probable value of h. The
expression (14.17) means that if the distance is increased
by one million light years, then the expansion velocity in-
creases by h times 30km/s .
Our neighbouring galaxy, the Andromeda galaxy, is
about 2.5 × 106 l.y. away from us. At this distance the ex-
pansion velocity (with h = 1) is about 75 km/s. This does

14.4
The Friedmann models
579
not mean that the Andromeda galaxy moves with this ve-
locity away from us. The galaxies are like the particles of
a gigantic gas. The velocity due to the expansion is super-
posed upon a velocity due to a motion of the galaxies in
arbitrary directions. The average velocity of this motion
is about 500 km/s. Thus, only for galaxies at distances
greater than about 17 million light years, will the expan-
sion dominate over the arbitrary motions.
We shall now consider some consequences of the ﬁeld
equations. Equation (14.14) conﬁrms the results (12.34)
and (12.36) that we found earlier in the weak ﬁeld ap-
proximation, namely that the relativistic gravitational
mass density is ρg = ρ + 3 p/c2, implying that pressure
or tension contributes to the gravitational ﬁeld. For or-
dinary matter p/c2 ≪ρ, which gives ¨a < 0. This means
that the expansion is slowed down, due to attractive
gravity. The expansion was faster at earlier times.
The observed fact that the universe expands means
that the particles in the cosmic matter were closer before
than they are now. Going far enough back in time we
come to a point of time where the cosmic matter was very
closely packed. The density was extremely large. This is
a state that cannot be properly described by means of the
general theory of relativity. At a sufﬁciently early time
we reach the limit of applicability of the general theory
of relativity, and we need a quantum theory of gravity
to describe the ﬁrst moment. If we call the point of time

14.4
The Friedmann models
580
with inﬁnite density, as predicted by general relativity, for
t = 0, then the region of applicability of general relativity
is later than the so-called Planck time, tPlanck =
p
G¯h/c5 =
10−43 s, where ¯h is Planck’s constant. This initial moment
in the history of the universe is called the Big Bang.
The time from the Big Bang to now is called the age of
the universe. Due mainly to the uncertainty in the value
of the Hubble factor, it is uncertain by about a factor of
two. If the expansion velocity was constant, the present
age of the universe would be equal to the inverse of the
present value of the Hubble factor.
This age is called
the Hubble age, and is denoted by tH0. Due to attractive
gravity the expansion is slowed down. The universe ex-
panded faster before. Thus the age of the universe is less
that the Hubble age, which has a value
tH0 = 1/H0 = (10/h) 109 years.
(14.18)
Inserting h = 0.6 we ﬁnd the most probable value tH0 =
16.7 × 109 years.
Subtracting Eq. (14.14) from Eq. (14.15) we get

Introducing the Hubble factor from Eq. (14.16), and di-
viding each side of Eq. (14.19) by a2, the latter equation
takes the form of
H2 + k c2

A universe with Euclidean spatial geometry, k = 0, is
said to have critical mass density ρcrit. Hence
H2 = 8πG

or
ρcrit = 3H2
8πG.
(14.21)
Inserting the present value, H0, of the Hubble factor, we
get the present value of the critical mass density, (ρcrit)0 =
2 h2 10−26 kg/m3. Inserting h = 0.6 gives (ρcrit)0 = 7, 2 ×
10−27 kg/m3, which corresponds to about 4 hydrogen
atoms per cubic metre.
One often introduces a dimensionless parameter rep-
resenting the cosmic mass density, namely the ratio of the
actual cosmic mass density and the critical mass density,
Ω≡ρ/ρcrit.
(14.22)
Dividing Eq. (14.20) by H2 and using Eq. (14.22) and that

(14.23)
When we know a as a function of the time, this equation
will tell whether the mass density approaches the critical
density or not.
An equation for the rate of change of the cosmic mass
density can be deduced from the ﬁeld equations as fol-
lows. Differentiating Eq. (14.19) we get

This is the equation for the rate of change of density of

There are different sorts of perfect ﬂuid characterized
by different relationships between pressure and density.
Such a relationship is usually called the equation of state

14.4
The Friedmann models

of the cosmic ﬂuid. In all the ﬂuids we shall consider the
pressure is proportional to the density, i.e.
p = (β −1) ρ,
(14.25)
where β is a constant characterizing the ﬂuid. Inserting
Eq. (14.25) into Eq. (14.24) we get
˙ρ = −3 [ρ + (β −1) ρ] ˙a
a = −3 (ρ + β ρ −ρ) ˙a
a

a.
Dividing each side of this equation by ρ we have
˙ρ

a.
Integrating each side of this equation by means of the rule
(3.55) we ﬁnd
ln ρ = −3 β ln a + K,
where K is a constant. Using the rule (3.51) and adding
3 β ln a = ln(a3 β) on each side, we can write
ln ρ + ln(a3 β) = K.
Using the rule (3.49) we get
ln(ρa3β) = K = ln Kβ

where Kβ is a new constant. Hence
ρ a3 β = Kβ.

This equation shows how the density of different sorts of
cosmic ﬂuids depends upon the scale factor.
We can now calculate how the the scale factor of a uni-
verse with critical mass density depends upon the time.

more commonly known as ‘matter dominated’—with

t0 = (6.7/h) × 109 years.
For h = 0.6 we ﬁnd the most probable age for this uni-

The matter and radiation domi-
nated periods
Observations reveal that the visible matter in the universe
consists mainly of very cold and thin hydrogen and he-
lium gas for which the pressure divided by c2 is negli-
gibly small compared to the density. Thus we can, as a
good approximation, put p = 0, or β = 1 in the equation
of state of the cosmic matter during such a matter dom-
inated period. Matter with vanishing pressure is called
dust. Putting β = 1 in Eq. (14.26) we get
ρdust a3 = (ρdust)0 a3
0,
(14.31)
where the index 0 denotes ‘value at the present age of the
universe’. The mass density estimated from visible mat-
ter in the universe is between 0.5% and 5% of the critical
density. However, the dynamics of the galaxies and clus-
ters of galaxies indicates that there may be large amounts
of dark matter in the universe. We therefore assume that
the density of the cosmic matter is equal to the critical
density.
In 1965 it was discovered that the universe is ﬁlled
by black body radiation. Recent measurements with the
COBE satellite has shown that the radiation has a temper-
ature of T = 2.726K. According to the Stefan–Boltzmann
radiation law, black body radiation with this temperature
has a mass density (ρrad)0 = 4, 5 × 10−31 kg/m3.

The equation of state of black body radiation is
p = 1

ρrad

which corresponds to β
=
4/3.
Inserting this in
Eq. (14.26) we get
ρrad a4 = (ρrad)0 a4
0.
(14.32)
Thinking of earlier periods in the history of the uni-
verse, the value of the scale factor was less, and the den-
sities of the dust and the radiation were greater. Since
ρrad a4 = constant for radiation, and ρdust a3 = constant
for dust, the density of the radiation increases faster
when we go backwards in time than the density of the
dust. Thus at a certain point of time, teq the mass den-
sity of the radiation was equal to that of the dust. Before
this point of time the mass density of the radiation was
greater than that of the dust, i.e. the universe was radia-
tion dominated. In order to ﬁnd the point of time for the
transition from the radiation dominated era to the dust
dominated era, we divide Eq. (14.32) by (14.31), which
leads to
ρrad
ρdust
a = (ρrad)0
(ρdust)0

At the point of time teq the densities ρrad and ρdust were
equal, from which follows
a(teq) = (ρrad)0

a0.

Inserting the values for (ρrad)0 and (ρdust)0 we ﬁnd
a(teq) ≈10−4 a0.
(14.33)
In order to proceed in the calculation of the point of
time trd we must ﬁnd the scale factor as function of time
in a dust dominated universe with critical mass density.
This is given in Eq. (14.28) with β = 1,
a = (6πGK1)1/3 t2/3.
(14.34)
The value of the scale factor at the present point of time
is
a0 = (6πGK1)1/3 t2/3

Inserting the value (14.30) gives teq = 1.12 × 104 years.

Problems with the standard model
591
The model we have considered up to now is called the
standard model of the universe. This model is not without
problems!
14.6
Problems faced by the standard
model of the universe
There are problems of two different types. The ﬁrst type
concerns properties of the models that are in accordance
with observations, but which are not explained as a con-
sequence of the dynamics of the model. They are put
into the model in an ad hoc way as initial conditions.
Among such properties are the isotropy, the homogene-
ity, the amount of matter in the universe and the expan-
sion of the model. The second type of problems are those
where the properties of the model are in conﬂict with ob-
servations. The most prominent problem of this type con-
cerns the age of the universe.
As an illustration we shall consider the problem con-
cerned with the amount of matter in the universe. Let us
introduce a parameter
ϵ ≡Ω−1
Ω
(14.40)
as a measure of the quantity of matter in the universe,
where Ωis deﬁned in Eq. (14.22). ϵ < 0 if ρ < ρcrit, ϵ = 0

14.6
Problems with the standard model
592
if ρ = ρcrit and ϵ > 0 if ρ > ρcrit. If the actual density is
very much less than the critical density, ϵ has a large neg-
ative value, and if the density is very much larger than
the critical density, ϵ has a large positive value. If the ab-
solute value of ϵ is not very large, the density of the cos-
mic matter is close to the critical density. Measurements
indicate that ϵ ≈−100, which is a small number in this
connection.
We shall calculate an initial value for ϵ, i.e. the value
of ϵ at the Planck time, tPlanck = 10−43 s, according to the
standard model. The time variation of Ω−1 is given in
Eq. (14.23). The scale factor during the matter dominated
period is given by Eq. (14.34). Differentiation gives
˙a ∝t−1/3,
where ∝denotes ‘proportional to’.
Inserting this into
Eq. (14.23) we ﬁnd the time variation of Ω−1 during the
matter dominated period,
Ω−1 ∝t2/3.
The time variation of Ω−1 during the radiation domi-
nated period follows by inserting Eq. (14.39) into
Eq. (14.23), which results in
Ω−1 ∝t.
(14.41)
These expressions show that the value of Ωis departing
from 1 with increasing time. Thus, the value of Ωwas

14.6
Problems with the standard model
593
closer to 1 at earlier times. In our calculation of the value
of ϵ at the Planck time we can therefore put Ω≈1. Hence
ϵ = Ω−1
Ω= Ω2 −1
Ω
≈Ω2 −1
= (Ω+ 1) (Ω−1) ≈2 (Ω−1).
(14.42)
Since Ω−1 is proportional to t during the radiation dom-
inated period, then ϵ is so too, according to Eqs. (14.41)
and (14.42). We can then write
ϵPlanck ≈ϵeq(tPlanck/teq),
(14.43)
where the index “Planck” denotes ‘value at the Planck
time’ and “eq” ’value at the transition time from radiation
dominated to matter dominated’. Similarly, since Ω−1 is
proportional to t2/3 during the matter dominated period,
we can write
ϵeq ≈ϵ0 (teq/t0)2/3.
Inserting this expression into Eq. (14.43) leads to
ϵPlanck ≈tPlanck

−10−56. Thus, at the Planck time the mass density of the
universe was extremely close to the critical density. Such
an extremely accurate adjustment of an initial condition
of the universe cannot be explained within the frame of
the standard model of the universe.
In Sect. 14.7 of this book we shall see how new ideas
that appeared at about 1980 offer a solution to this prob-
lem, and also offer an explanation of why the universe
expands.

Inﬂationary cosmology
According to quantum ﬁeld theory, it is impossible to re-
move all the energy from a region. Vacuum is not a space
without energy, but with the least possible energy.
Some of the great advances in our understanding of
the behaviour of the material universe are associated
with advents of new uniﬁed theories of different phe-
nomena. For example, at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, electrical, magnetic and optical phenomena were
not related to each other. However, between 1850 and
1860 J. C. Maxwell managed to develop a uniﬁed theory
of these phenomena, and an understanding that light is
electromagnetic waves. This type of theoretical advance
has proceeded. More than a hundred years later a Nobel
prize was given for the detection of particles that were
predicted by a uniﬁed theory for the weak nuclear force

14.7

and the electromagnetic force. One has also constructed
so-called Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUTs) for the ‘elec-
troweak’ force and the strong nuclear force. Even if these
theories lack experimental conﬁrmation, we shall explore
one consequence of them, that is of great signiﬁcance for
the evolution of the universe.
Let us ﬁrst calculate the time dependence of the crit-
ical cosmic energy density. Inserting (14.27) into (14.26)
gives
ρcrit 6πGβ2Kβ t2 = Kβ
or
6πGβ2 ρcrit t2 = 1.
This means that
ρcrit ∝1/t2,
(14.44)
which shows that the critical density was large at earlier
times. Since the actual density was then very close to the
critical density the actual density of the cosmic energy
was very large in the beginning.
According to the Stefan–Boltzmann radiation law
ρrad ∝T 4.
(14.45)
Equations (14.44) and (14.45) imply that
T 4 ∝1/t2
or
T ∝1/
√
t.

This equation shows that the cosmic background radia-
tion had a very high temperature in the beginning. Also
it shows that the temperature of the cosmic background
radiation can be used as a cosmic clock.
The GUTs combined with the model of a universe that
was extremely hot in the beginning, has as a consequence
that the evolution of the universe may have been domi-
nated by vacuum energy at its ﬁrst moment, before the
universe was 10−33 s old.
Several experiments have been performed to measure
the velocity of the Earth through the vacuum, the most
wellknown one being the Michelson–Morley experiment
of 1887. None of these experiments managed to measure
such a velocity. It is consistent with the results of these
experiments to assume that the vacuum energy is of such
a nature that it is impossible to measure velocity relative
to the vacuum.
We shall now deduce some very interesting conse-
quences of this assumption within the context of homoge-
neous and isotropic universe models. The only physical
properties attributed to the vacuum energy are density
and pressure or tension. This means that we can describe
the vacuum as a perfect ﬂuid. Since the vacuum has no
velocity, the components of its energy-momentum ten-
sor in an arbitrarily moving local inertial frame are those
given in Eq. (10.27),
T ij = p δij
and
T tt = ρ.
(14.46)

14.7
Inﬂationary cosmology
597
Because it is impossible to measure velocity relative to the
vacuum ﬂuid, all components of the energy-momentum
tensor must be invariant, i.e. unchanged, under arbitrary
Lorentz transformations. We shall apply this requirement
to the components T xx and T tt under a Lorentz transfor-
mation in the x direction. Denoting the transformed com-
ponents by T x′x′ and T t′t′ we then have
T x′x′ = T xx
and
T t′t′ = T tt.
(14.47)
Using the second of Eqs. (5.80) the transformed compo-
nents are
T x′x′ = ∂x′
∂xµ
∂x′
∂xµ T µν
and
T t′t′ = ∂t′
∂xµ
∂t′
∂xν T µν. (14.48)
The elements of the transformation matrix is obtained by
differentiating the coordinates x′ and t′ in Eq. (5.98),
∂x′
∂x = γ,
∂x′
∂t = −γv,
∂t′
∂x = −γv
c2 ,
and
∂t′
∂t = γ.
(14.49)
Performing the summations over µ and ν in Eq. (14.48),
and keeping only non-vanishing terms, we get
T x′x′ = ∂x′
∂x
∂x′
∂x T xx + ∂x′
∂t
∂x′
∂t T tt,
T t′t′ = ∂t′
∂x
∂t′
∂x T xx + ∂t′
∂t
∂t′
∂t T tt.

14.7
Inﬂationary cosmology

Inserting the expressions (14.49) leads to
T x′x′ = γ2 T xx + γ2 v2 T tt,
T t′t′ = (γ2v2/c4) T xx + γ2 T tt.
(14.50)
From Eqs. (14.47) and (14.50), we have
T xx = γ2 T xx + γ2 v2 T tt,
T tt = (γ2v2/c4) T xx + γ2 T tt
or
(γ2 −1) T xx = −γ2 v2 T tt,
(γ2 −1) T tt = −(γ2 v2/c4) T xx.
(14.51)
Dividing these equations by each other, we get
T xx
T tt = T tt
T xxc4.
Hence
(T xx)2 = (T tt)2 c4.
From Eq. (14.51) follows that T xx and T tt have opposite
signs. Thus, we take the negative root, which results in
T xx = −T tt c2.
Inserting T xx = p and T tt = ρ from Eq. (14.46) we obtain
p = −ρ c2.
(14.52)

14.7
Inﬂationary cosmology
599
This equation shows that the ‘vacuum ﬂuid’ is in a state
of tension. Inserting Eq. (14.52) in Eq. (12.36) for the grav-
itational mass density, we get
ρg = −2ρ.
We are lead to the conclusion that the gravitational mass
density of vacuum is negative, which means that the
gravity of vacuum is repulsive.
We here see the remarkable strength of the general
theory of relativity. From the assumption that we cannot
measure velocity relative to vacuum, the theory implies
that vacuum acts upon itself with repulsive gravitation.
A vacuum dominated region will have a tendency to ex-
plode!
The equation of state (14.52) is just Eq. (14.25) with
β = 0.
Inserting β = 0 into Eq. (14.26), and putting
a0 = 1, we get ρ = K0, showing that the vacuum energy
has constant energy density during the expansion of the
universe. There will be more and more vacuum energy
during the expansion.
From Eq. (14.23) follows that since the expansion ve-
locity ˙a increases during the accelerated expansion in a
vacuum dominated period, the value of Ωapproaches 1,
i.e. the density of the cosmic vacuum ﬂuid approaches
the critical density. The time dependence of the scale fac-
tor during the early vacuum dominated period, which is
called the inﬂationary era, may thus be found by integrat-

14.7
Inﬂationary cosmology
600
ing Eq. (14.19) with k = 0 and ρ = ρvac = constant,
˙a2 = 8πG
3
ρvac a2.
Taking the square root and dividing by a we get
˙a
a =
r
8πG
3
ρvac.
(14.53)
Note that the left-hand side is the Hubble factor of this
universe model. Since the right-hand side is constant, it
follows that the Hubble factor of a vacuum dominated
universe model with critical density, is constant. We de-
note this constant by Hvac, that is
Hvac =
r
8πG
3
ρvac.
(14.54)
The transition into a vacuum dominated period hap-
pened at a point of time when the energy density of the
radiation became less than a certain energy density ρGUT
determined by the GUTs. Thus, according to Eq. (14.54)
the Hubble factor during the inﬂationary era is
Hvac =
r
8πG
3
ρGUT.
The point of time t1 when the universe entered the inﬂa-
tionary era, is taken to be the Hubble age associated with

14.7
Inﬂationary cosmology
601
the GUT-energy density, i.e.
t1 = 1/Hvac.
The GUTs give t1 = 10−35 s.
Equation (14.53) can now be written
˙a
a = Hvac = 1
t1
.
Using that ˙a = da/dt, and multiplying by dt we thus get
da
a = 1
t1
dt.
Integrating this equation by means of the rule (3.54) with
the initial condition a(t1) = a1, we ﬁnd
ln a −ln a1 = 1
t1
(t −t1) = t
t1
−1.
Applying the rule (3.50) this equation can be written as
ln a
a1
= t
t1
−1.
(14.55)
Using that y = ln x ⇔x = ey, where e is the base of the
natural logarithm, ans substituting a for x and Hvac t for
y, we see that Eq. (14.55) is equivalent to the equation
a/a1 = e(t/t1)−1

14.7
Inﬂationary cosmology
602
or
a = a1 e(t/t1)−1.
Thus the universe has exponential expansion during the
inﬂationary era.
Differentiation gives
˙a = (a1/t1) e(t/t1)−1.
Inserting this into Eq. (14.23) leads to
Ω−1 = k (c t1/a1)2e−2[(t/t1)−1].
This equation shows that Ωapproaches 1 exponentially
fast during the inﬂationary era.
At the beginning of the inﬂationary era the d ensity of
the cosmic matter may have differed very much from the
critical density. If, for example, a1 ≪c t1, then
Ω(t1) = 1 + k (c t1/a1)2 ≈k (c t1/a1)2 ≫1,
which means that the cosmic mass density was much
larger than the critical density at the initial moment of the
inﬂationary era. The value of the parameter ϵ introduced
in Eq. (14.40), was then, with good accuracy
ϵ(t1) ≈Ω(t1) ≈k (c t1/a1)2.
(14.56)
However, as noted above, the density approached the
critical density very fast during the inﬂationary era, and

14.7
Inﬂationary cosmology
603
at the end of this era we can use the approximation
(14.42). According to the GUTs the inﬂationary era lasted
until t2 = 10−33 s, and the value of ϵ at the end of the
inﬂationary era was
ϵ(t2) ≈2 [Ω(t2) −1] = 2 k (c t1/a1) e−2 [(t2/t1)−1].
Using Eq. (14.56) and inserting the values of t1 and t2 we
get
ϵ(t2) = 2 ϵ(t1) e−[(t2/t1)−1] = 2 × e−199 ϵ(t1) ≈10−87ϵ(t1).
This shows that during the inﬂationary era the density
became extremely close to the critical density. Hence one
of the predictions of the inﬂationary universe models, is
that the universe should still have a cosmic mass density
close to the critical density. Thus the inﬂationary cosmol-
ogy solves the problem, which was unsolved in standard
model, of explaining the observed fact that the mass den-
sity is close to the critical density. In fact it seems to solve
it too well. Observations indicate a cosmic mass density
which is close to, but less than the critical mass density,
0.2 < Ω< 0.4. This is less than the mass density pre-
dicted by the inﬂationary models.
One ﬁnal triumph of the inﬂationary models should
be mentioned, though. We now seem to know the an-
swer to the question: Why does the universe expand?
The inﬂationary cosmological models offer the follow-
ing answer: Once upon a time vacuum energy ﬁlled the

14.7
Inﬂationary cosmology
604
universe, it had negative mass, and repulsive gravitation
forced the universe to expand.

Appendix A
The Laplacian in a spheri-
cal coordinate system
In order to be able to deduce the most important physi-
cal consequences from the Poisson equation (12.5), which
represents the Newtonian limit of Einstein’s ﬁeld equa-
tions, we must know the form of the Laplacian in a spher-
ical coordinate system. This is because most important
applications of any theory of gravitation involve physi-
cal systems, for example planets, stars, black holes and
the whole universe, that are spherically symmetric. Of
course it is possible to ﬁnd the wanted form of the Lapla-
cian in collections of mathematical formulae. However,
in the spirit of the rest of this book, we here offer a de-
tailed deduction.
The Laplace operator, or more commonly called the
Laplacian, is deﬁned as the divergence of the gradient,
605

The Laplacian in a spherical coordinate system

i.e.
∇2 ≡div grad .
(A.1)
We shall ﬁnd an expression of the Laplacian valid in an
arbitrary orthogonal coordinate system, and then special-
ize to a spherical coordinate system. In order to calcu-
late the Laplacian in an orthogonal coordinate system,
we must ﬁrst ﬁnd expressions for the gradient and the
divergence in such coordinate systems. We start with the
gradient.
An operator is something which acts upon a function
and changes it in a prescribed way. The gradient operator
acts upon a scalar function by differentiating it, and gives
out a vector called the gradient of the function. In an arbi-
trary coordinate system the gradient operator is deﬁned
as a vector with covariant components
∇i ≡∂
∂xi.
(A.2)
According to the rule (5.77) for raising an index, the con-
travariant components are
∇i = gij ∇j = gij ∂
∂xj.
(A.3)
We shall need to know the expression for the gradient
in the class of coordinate systems with orthogonal coordi-
nate axes. Such coordinate systems have diagonal metric

tensors, i.e. gij = 0 for i ̸= j. In this case the only non-
vanishing contravariant components of the metric ten-
sor are given in terms of the covariant components by
Eq. (5.75).
gii = 1/gii.
Inserting this into Eq. (A.3) gives
∇i = 1
gii
∂
∂xi.
Next we shall ﬁnd an expression for the divergence
in terms of ordinary partial derivatives and the compo-
nents of the metric tensor in an orthogonal coordinate
system. The divergence is given as a covariant deriva-
tive in Eq. (10.3). Inserting the expression (7.15) for the
covariant derivative into Eq. (10.3), leads to
div⃗F = ∂Fi
∂xi + FkΓ i
ki.
(A.4)
Hence, we must ﬁnd an expression for the Christoffel
symbols Γ iki in an orthogonal coordinate system with a
diagonal metric tensor. For this purpose we use Eq. (7.30)
with τ = i, ν = k, λ = i, which for a diagonal metric
tensor reduces to

Inserting this into Eq. (A.4) we get

(A.6)
We now deﬁne
g ≡g11 g22 g33.
(A.7)
Differentiation g by means of the product rule (2.22) we
ﬁrst put u = g11 g22 and v = g33 and get
∂g
∂xk = ∂(g11 g22)
∂xk
g33 + g11 g22
∂g33
∂xk .
(A.8)
Using the product rule once more, we have
∂(g11 g22)
∂xk
= ∂g11
∂xk g22 + g11
∂g22
∂xk .
Inserting this into Eq. (A.8) gives
∂g
∂xk = ∂g11
∂xk g22 g33 + g11
∂g22
∂xk g33 + g11 g22
∂g33
∂xk .
Multiplying the numerators and the denominators of the
terms at the right-hand side by g11, g22, and g33, respec-
tively, reordering, and using Eq. (A.7), we get
∂g
∂xk = g

∂xk + g

∂xk + g

Using Einstein’s summation convention this may be writ-

hand sides, we get

Inserting this into Eq. (A.6) we get

In order to simplify this expression, we differentiate √g.
Using the rule (2.36) with n = 1/2 and the chain rule

∂√g
∂xk = ∂g1/2
∂xk = 1

Thus, Eq. (A.9) can be written as

(A.11)
Inserting Fi = ∇i from Eq. (A.3) and the expression (A.11)

the expression for the Laplacian in an arbitrary orthogo-

In the case of a Cartesian coordinate system, the only
non-vanishing components of the metric tensor are gxx =
gyy = gzz = 1. Then √g = 1, and performing the summa-

∇2 = ∂2

The expression (A.12) shall now be used to calculate
the Laplace operator in a spherical coordinate system.
Then we need the line element of Euclidean 3-dimensio-
nal space as expressed in a spherical coordinate system.
The basis vectors of this coordinate system are given in
terms of the basis vectors of a Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem in Eq. (6.22). The components of the metric tensor in
this coordinate system are given by the scalar products
of the basis vectors in Eq. (6.22). Since the vectors are or-
thogonal to each other only the products of each vector
with itself are different from zero. Using Eq. (4.11) we

Thus the line element of ﬂat space in spherical coordi-

The components of the metric tensor in a spherical coor-
dinate system are therefore
grr = 1,
gθθ = r2,
and
gϕϕ = r2 sin2 θ.

In the ﬁrst term sin θ is constant during the differentia-

tor in front of ∂/∂r. The sin θ in the numerator and the
denominator cancel each other. In the second term r2 in
the numerator and the denominator inside the parenthe-
sis cancel each other. Finally, in the last term the sin θ
in the numerator cancels one of the sin θ factors in the
denominator inside the parenthesis. The remaining sin θ
can be put in front of ∂/∂ϕ, since sin θ is constant dur-
ing differentiation with respect to ϕ. This ﬁnally gives

Appendix B
The Ricci tensor of a static
and spherically symmetric
spacetime.
The most interesting applications of Einstein’s theory are
concerned with systems having spherical symmetry. In
Ch. 13 we consider spacetime outside static systems.
Then we have to solve Einstein’s vacuum ﬁeld equations
in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime. Since the
vacuum ﬁeld equations amount to putting the Ricci ten-
sor equal to zero, we need to calculate the components of
the Ricci tensor for this case.
We ﬁrst have to calculate the Christoffel symbols for
the metric (13.15). Then we use Eq. (7.30). We need the
contravariant components gµν of the metric tensor. Since
the metric is diagonal, they are given by Eq. (5.75), i.e.
614

Ricci tensor of a static, spherically symmetric metric
615
gµµ = 1/gµµ. Then Eq. (7.30) simpliﬁes to
Γ µ
νλ =
1
2 gµµ
(gµν,λ + gµλ,ν −gνλ,µ) .
(B.1)
In this equation and the next ones, there is no summation
over the values of the index ν.
In order to calculate the Christoffel symbols, we di-
vide the Christoffel symbols into three groups. First we
consider the case with µ = ν. Inserting this into Eq. (B.1)
gives
Γ ν
νλ =
1
2 gνν
(gνν,λ + gνλ,ν −gνλ,ν) .
The last two terms cancel each other, so we are left with
Γ ν
νλ =
1
2gνν
gνν,λ.
(B.2)
Next we ﬁnd an expression for the Christoffel symbols
with λ = ν and µ different from both. Inserting λ = ν in
Eq. (B.1) gives
Γ µ
νν =
1
2 gµµ
(gµν,ν + gµν,ν −gνν,µ) .
Since µ ̸= ν in this case, and the metric of the line element
(13.14) has gµν = 0 for µ ̸= ν, the ﬁrst two terms inside
the parenthesis are equal to zero, which implies
Γ µ
νν = −
1
2 gµµ
gνν,µ.
(B.3)

Ricci tensor of a static, spherically symmetric metric
616
At last we consider the Christoffel symbols which have
all three indices different, λ ̸= µ, λ ̸= ν, and µ ̸= ν. Then
the indices of the metric components in all three terms
of Eq. (B.1) are different. Thus, all the terms are equal to
zero, which leads to
Γ µ
νλ = 0,
if
λ ̸= µ,
λ ̸= ν,
and
ν ̸= µ.
Inserting µ = ν and µ = r in Eq. (B.2), we get

Inserting grr = eλ(r) from Eq. (13.15),

We now use the chain rule, [f(λ)]′ = f′(λ) λ′, where f′(λ)
is f differentiated with respect to λ, and (in the present
case) λ′ is λ differentiated with respect to r.
Inserting
f(λ) = eλ, and using Eq. (3.59) gives

The calculation of all the non-vanishing Christoffel

Equations (B.17), (B.18) and (B.22) provide the expres-
sions for the components of the Ricci curvature tensor of
a static, spherically symmetric spacetime that are needed
in Ch. 13 in order to investigate the consequences of the
general theory of relativity for this type of spacetime.

Appendix C
The Ricci tensor of the
Robertson–Walker metric
The expanding universe models that are still the most
prominent relativistic models of the universe, were de-
duced as solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations by
A. Friedmann in 1922. These models are isotropic and ho-
mogeneous, and the most suitable line element for such
models were found by H. P. Robertson and A. G. Walker
about 1930.
Before we can solve the ﬁeld equations for these mod-
els, we must ﬁnd the form of the ﬁeld equations for them,
that is for the Robertson–Walker line element. Then we
need to know the components of the Ricci tensor for this
line element. In order to ﬁnd these components of the
Ricci tensor, we shall ﬁrst calculate the non-vanishing
Christoffel symbols for the line element (14.9).
624

625
Some of the Christoffel symbols come from the part
r2 dθ2 + r2 sin2 θ dϕ2 of the line element (14.9), which is
also a part of the line element (13.14). They are given in
Eqs. (B.7), (B.9), (B.10), and (B.14). We list them here for
easier reference

(C.5)
where ˙a means the derivative of the function a with re-
spect to t. Due to the isotropy of the spacetimes described
by the line element (14.9), and the symmetry of the

Christoffel symbols in their lower indices, we get

There are no more non-vanishing Christoffel symbols.
Note in particular that Γ βtt = 0, which is of physical sig-
niﬁcance, as shown in Ch. 14.
We now proceed by calculating the components of the
Ricci tensor which we need in order to ﬁnd the form of
the ﬁeld equations for the present application. Inserting
µ = ν = t in Eq. (B.15), and including only the non-
vanishing Christoffel symbols in the summation over α

(C.20)
Due to the isotropy of the models, we only need the two
components of the Ricci tensor that we have now calcu-
lated. Inserting the expressions (C.15) and (C.20) for Rtt
and Rθθ, respectively, into Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, we
arrive at a set of two differential equations. The solutions
of these equations show how the expanding motion of
the universe models varies with time, and how the mass
density evolves in the models.
