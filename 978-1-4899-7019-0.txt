PREFACE 
The Missile and Space Projects Guide has beenprepared to pro-
vide aerospace scientists, engineers, market analysts, planners, 
and other specialists with basic information on the numerous 
existing missile and space projects. lt is the first book of its kind 
in that it assembles in one volume reference information on nearly 
all projects, planned or actual, including concepts, studies, or 
hardware, that have been mentioned in the open literature. A number 
of missile and space guides, dictionaries, glossaries, or handbooks 
have been published, but none is centered about the "project" 
in its broadest sense. Some of these guides furnish detailed infor-
mation on a limited number of R&D projects but ignore the hundreds 
of studies, proposals, concepts, and programs which complete the 
picture. 
lf we consider missile and space projects as trees in a forest, 
it can be said that the mighty oaks and many of the larger trees 
have been covered in the literature, but the young growth, from 
which the big trees of the future must develop, has not been treated 
extensively in existing guides. lt is the aim of this volume to 
provide reference information on all missile and space projects, 
whether small or great, domestic or foreign, conceptual or material. 
Apart from the names of actual missile and space programs, 
this guide includes numerical designations of such projects and of 
pieces of associated equipment, as well as the names or abbrevia-
tions of many aerospace organizations. Nearly all known missile 
and space project names and project designations have been 
identified and cross-referenced. All are not included because 
new ones are coming into existence daily. However, more projects 
than ever before assembled are listed and identified in a systematic 
manner. 
Obviously, the present guide cannot provide a quantity of de-
tailed information on any one project, but it does provide sufficient 
data to orient the reader, classify the project, and relate it to an 
organization or sponsoring agency. Where possible, budgetary and 
cost information, principal subcontractors, status of the project, 
and some descriptive data are given. Although every effort has 
been made to check the validity of the data presented, the authors 
cannot guarantee the accuracy of every item. This derives from 
the fact that missile and space programs are under constant re-
vision and that only unclassified sources have been used in this 
vii 

compilation. For the present guide to be useful, it must be current; 
it could not be so if the authors had not struck a suitable balance 
between time and accuracy.

Board, the Air Council, USAF Chief of Staff, and the Air Secre-
tary. Ten offices to be created initially; more may be created 
later. SYSTOS to handle MINUTEMAN, ATLAS, TITAN, and
