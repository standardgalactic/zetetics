Preface to the Second Edition
Sidney Greenbaum’s An Introduction to English Grammar was ﬁrst published in
1991, and has been consistently popular ever since.
In preparing this second edition, I have preserved the overall organization of the
original book. Part I provides an outline description of English grammar. Part II
applies the grammatical information from Part I, giving students guidance on
solving problems of usage, improving their writing style, and on punctuation.
Apart from making some minor revisions, and updating the citations, I have
preserved almost all the material that appeared in the ﬁrst edition. I have added a
new chapter entitled English in Use, which deals with the grammatical features of
a range of linguistic registers, including conversations, sports commentaries, and
emails. Most of these extracts are taken from the British component of the Interna-
tional Corpus of English (ICE-GB), which was compiled at the Survey of English
Usage, University College London. The section called Literary Analysis, which
appeared in the ﬁrst edition, has been incorporated without change into the new
chapter, under the heading The Language of Literature. In the Appendix on spelling,
I have disambiguated some of the most common and troublesome homophones.
The number of exercises has been increased, and the exercises now appear at the
end of the relevant chapter, rather than in a section of their own. The exercises are
intended to help students understand the text and give them practice in applying
the grammar. Some of the exercises introduce topics that are not dealt with expli-
citly in the text. These are generally essay-style exercises, in which students are
encouraged to explore linguistic topics on their own, using the new Further Read-
ing section as a starting point. Many of the exercises were compiled by Professor
Charles F. Meyer (University of Massachusetts-Boston).

Rules and Variation
1.1
What is grammar?
I will be using the word grammar in this book to refer to the set of rules that
allow us to combine words in our language into larger units. Another term for
grammar in this sense is syntax.
Some combinations of words are possible in English and others are not. As a
speaker of English, you can judge that Home computers are now much cheaper is a
possible English sentence whereas Home computers now much are cheaper is not,
because you know that much is wrongly positioned in the second example. Your
ability to recognize such distinctions is evidence that in some sense you know the
rules of grammar even if you have never studied any grammar. Similarly, you
operate the rules whenever you speak or write (you can put words in the right
order) and whenever you interpret what others say (you know that Susan likes Tom
means something quite different from Tom likes Susan). But knowing the rules
in evaluative and operational senses does not mean that you can say what the
rules are.
You acquire a working knowledge of your native language simply through being
exposed to it from early childhood: nobody taught you, for example, where to posi-
tion much. You study grammar, however, if you want to be able to analyse your
language. The analytic grammar makes explicit the knowledge of the rules with
which you operate when you use the language. There is a clear difference between
the operational grammar and the analytic grammar. After all, many languages have
never been analysed and some have been analysed only relatively recently. People
were speaking and writing English long before the ﬁrst English grammars appeared
at the end of the sixteenth century.
1.2
Grammar and other aspects of language
Linguistic communications are channelled mainly through our senses of sound and
sight. Grammar is the central component of language. It mediates between the
system of sounds or of written symbols, on the one hand, and the system of
meaning, on the other. Phonology is the usual term for the sound system in the
language: the distinctive sound units and the ways which they may be combined.
Orthography parallels phonology in that it deals with the writing system in

2
An Introduction to English Grammar
the language: the distinctive written symbols and their possible combinations.
Semantics is concerned with the system of meanings in the language: the mean-
ings of words and the combinatory meanings of larger units.
Orthography
Grammar
Phonology
Semantics
Three other aspects of language description are often distinguished: phonetics,
morphology, and pragmatics. Phonetics deals with the physical characteristics of
the sounds in the language and how the sounds are produced. Sounds and letters
combine to form words or parts of words. Morphology refers to the set of rules
that describe the structure of words. The word computer, for example, consists of
two parts: the base compute (used separately as a verb) and the sufﬁx -er (found in
other nouns derived from verbs, e.g. blender). Pragmatics is concerned with the
use of particular utterances within particular situations. For example, Will you join
our group? is a question that, depending on the speaker’s intention, is either a
request for information or a request for action.
For descriptive purposes, it is convenient to deal with the components of
language separately, but because of the central place of grammar in the language
system, it is sometimes necessary to refer to the other components when we
discuss the grammar.
1.3
Grammars of English
There are many grammars of English, that is to say books describing English
grammar. They differ in how much of the grammar they cover and in how they set
out the rules. There are also some differences in the categorization and termin-
ology they use. Nevertheless, most categories and terms are widely shared, deriving
from a long tradition of grammatical description.
The grammatical analysis in this book follows the approach found in A Compre-
hensive Grammar of the English Language by Randolph Quirk, Sidney Greenbaum,
Geoffrey Leech, and Jan Svartvik. First published in 1985, that is a reference work
on contemporary English grammar that contains nearly 1800 pages. Future refer-
ence works of this scope are likely to be even longer. Despite the immense amount
of research on contemporary English in the last few decades, many grammatical
phenomena have yet to be discovered and described.
1.4
National varieties
English is the ﬁrst language of over 300 million people. Most of them live in the
United States of America, which has about 230 million native speakers of English,

Rules and Variation
3
and the United Kingdom, with about 54 million. Other countries with large
numbers of English native speakers that also constitute the majority of the popula-
tion are Canada (about 16 million), Australia (about 19 million), the Irish Republic
(about 3.8 million), and New Zealand (about 3.9 million). Some countries have
concentrations of English native speakers, though they do not constitute the majority
of the population; for example, South Africa has about 1.6 million native English
speakers apart from about 8.5 million bilingual speakers of English. While recog-
nizing that these people all speak English, we can distinguish the national varieties
they use as American English, British English, Canadian English, and so on.
English is a second language for over 300 million people who speak another
language as their native tongue but also use English in communicating with their
compatriots. For example, the ﬁrst language for about 30 per cent of Canadians is
French and for millions of Americans it is Spanish. English is also the second
language in countries where only a small minority speak it as their tongue but
where it is the ofﬁcial language or joint ofﬁcial language for government business.
Among these countries is India, where it is estimated that about 21 million people
speak English ﬂuently as their second language (though these constitute only about
3 per cent of India’s vast population). Other countries where English is the ofﬁcial
or joint ofﬁcial language include Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Puerto
Rico (where about 1.3 million inhabitants are bilingual in Spanish and English),
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Since the English in each of these
countries has certain distinctive features, it is reasonable to refer to such national
varieties as, for example, Indian English or Nigerian English.
Finally, English is studied as the primary foreign language in most other coun-
tries. One estimate is that over 150 million children are currently studying
English as a foreign language in primary or secondary schools. Its popularity lies
in its value as an international language. A knowledge of English is perceived in
most parts of the world as essential for international communication in commerce
and tourism, in economic and military aid, and in scientiﬁc and technological
literature.
1.5
Standard and non-standard English
In addition to differences between national varieties of English, there are differ-
ences within each national variety. Each has a number of dialects. In countries
where the majority speak English as their ﬁrst language one dialect is used nation-
ally for ofﬁcial purposes. It is called Standard English.
Standard English is the national dialect that generally appears in print. It is
taught in schools, and students are expected to use it in their essays. It is the norm
for dictionaries and grammars. We expect to ﬁnd it in ofﬁcial printed communica-
tions, such as letters from government ofﬁcials, solicitors, and accountants. We
expect to hear it in national news broadcasts and documentary programmes on
radio or television.

4
An Introduction to English Grammar
Within each national variety the standard dialect is relatively homogeneous
in grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and punctuation. Pronunciation is a different
matter, since there is no equivalent standard accent (type of pronunciation). For
each national variety there are regional accents, related to a geographical area, and
social accents, related to the educational, socio-economic, and ethnic backgrounds
of the speakers. In British English, Received Pronunciation (RP) is a non-regional
social accent associated with public school education but it is not regarded as a
standard accent to be learned in schools throughout the country. It is spoken by
about 3 per cent of the population in Britain.
Standard English has prestige because people connect it with education and
with higher-income groups. It is not intrinsically better than other dialects, though
many believe it is. One of its major advantages is that it has developed a range of
styles to suit different kinds of uses of the language, particularly in writing.
Non-standard dialects tend to be restricted to people from a particular region or
from a particular social group or to social groups within a region. Many people
speak more than one dialect, perhaps using different dialects at home and at work.
1.6
Variation according to use
Language also varies according to context and communicative purpose. For ex-
ample, newspapers, cookery books, scientiﬁc papers, emails, poetry, and ﬁction all
have distinctive language features. Newspapers have a distinctive layout, headlines
are often highly compressed (Banks warned on student loans), cookery books tend
to use many imperatives (Mix the ingredients), scientiﬁc papers use many passive
constructions (A colourless gas is produced). These varieties are known as registers,
that is, varieties of language associated with speciﬁc uses and communicative
purposes.
Some variation depends on the medium, that is, the channel of communication.
There is a major distinction between spoken and written language. Conversation,
the most common type of speech, involves immediate interchange between the
participants, who convey their reactions either in words or through facial expres-
sions and bodily movements. There is more spontaneity in conversation than in
writing; self-correction occurs in the ﬂow of conversation, whereas it is eliminated
through editing in writing. Writing needs to be more explicit, since obscurities and
misunderstandings cannot be removed immediately. People feel more committed
to what they write because of the potential permanence of the written communica-
tion. The differences in the nature of the media is reﬂected in the greater concision
that is possible in writing and in the greater care that writers take over their choice
of words.
Language also varies according to the attitude of the speaker or writer towards
the listener or reader, towards the topic, and towards the purpose of communi-
cation. We can select from features that range from the most formal to the most
informal. For instance, comprehend and strive are more formal than their respective

Rules and Variation
5
equivalents, understand and try. Similarly, This is the student to whom I gave the
message is more formal than This is the student I gave the message to.
Grammatical variation across spoken and written registers is a central theme
of the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English by Douglas Biber et al.
(1999). In Chapter 10 we examine the grammatical features of a range of English
registers, including conversations, sports commentaries, emails, and literary texts.
1.7
Descriptive rules and prescriptive rules
At the beginning of this chapter I said that the rules of grammar state which com-
binations of words are possible in the language and which are not. My example of
an impossible sentence in English was Home computers now much are cheaper. The
rule that disallows that sentence is a descriptive rule, a rule that describes how
people use their language. The validity of this descriptive rule depends on whether it
is true that Home computers are now much cheaper is a possible English sentence and
Home computers now much are cheaper is an impossible English sentence. The evidence
to validate this rule is drawn from the knowledge that speakers of English have of
their language as well as from samples of their actual use of the language. Of course
the descriptive rule must be accurately formulated to make the valid distinctions.
Sometimes people speaking the same dialect disagree in their evaluation of par-
ticular sentences. For example, some speakers of standard British English ﬁnd
acceptable I demand that she gives her reasons; others prefer or require a different
form of the verb in the that-clause, either that she give her reasons or that she should
give her reasons.
A number of differences in the use of standard British English have acquired
social importance. Some speakers of the standard dialect consider that certain usages
mark their user as uneducated. Rules that specify which usages should be adopted
or avoided are called prescriptive rules. Examples of prescriptive rules are:
•
Don’t use like as a conjunction, as in He speaks like his father does.
•
Don’t use between you and I.
•
Don’t split an inﬁnitive, as in to actually feel.
•
Don’t end a sentence with a preposition.
Speakers of the standard dialect tend to pay greater attention to prescriptive
rules when they are on their best behaviour, in particular when they are writing in
a formal style.
1.8
Why study grammar?
The study of language is a part of general knowledge. We study the complex
working of the human body to understand ourselves; the same reason should
attract us to studying the marvellous complexity of human language.
Everybody has attitudes towards the English language and its varieties, and has
opinions on speciﬁc features. These attitudes and opinions affect relationships

An Introduction to English Grammar
with other people. If you understand the nature of language, you will realize the
grounds for your linguistic prejudices and perhaps moderate them; you will also
more clearly assess linguistic issues of public concern, such as worries about the
state of the language or what to do about the teaching of immigrants. Studying the
English language has a more obvious practical application: it can help you to use
the language more effectively.
In the study of language, grammar occupies a central position. But there is also
a practical reason to emphasize the study of grammar. It is easy to learn to use
dictionaries by yourself to ﬁnd the pronunciation, spelling, or meanings of words,
but it is difﬁcult to consult grammar books without a considerable knowledge of
grammar.
There are several applications of grammatical study: (1) A recognition of gram-
matical structures is often essential for punctuation; (2) A study of one’s native
grammar is helpful when one studies the grammar of a foreign language; (3) A
knowledge of grammar is a help in the interpretation of literary as well as nonliterary
texts, since the interpretation of a passage sometimes depends crucially on gram-
matical analysis; (4) A study of the grammatical resources of English is useful in
composition: in particular, it can help you to evaluate the choices available to you
when you come to revise an earlier written draft.
This book provides a survey of the grammar of standard British English, with sets
of exercises at the end of each major section. It also includes applications to punc-
tuation, usage problems, writing style, and the analysis of a range of linguistic registers.
It ends with an appendix on spelling, and a glossary of terms used in the book.

The Sentence
2.1
What is a sentence?
Grammar deals with the rules for combining words into larger units. The largest
unit that is described in grammar is normally the sentence. However, deﬁning a
‘sentence’ is notoriously difﬁcult, for the reasons we’ll now discuss.
It is sometimes said that a sentence expresses a complete thought. This is a
notional deﬁnition: it deﬁnes a term by the notion or idea it conveys. The difﬁ-
culty with this deﬁnition lies in ﬁxing what is meant by a ‘complete thought’.
There are notices, for example, that seem to be complete in themselves but are not
generally regarded as sentences: Exit, Danger, 50 mph speed limit.
On the other hand, there are sentences that clearly consist of more than one
thought. Here is one relatively simple example:
This week marks the 300th anniversary of the publication of Sir Isaac
Newton’s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, a fundamental
work for the whole of modern science and a key inﬂuence on the philosophy
of the European Enlightenment.
How many ‘complete thoughts’ are there in this sentence? We should at least
recognize that the part after the comma introduces two additional points about
Newton’s book: (1) that it is a fundamental work for the whole of modern science,
and (2) that it was a key inﬂuence on the philosophy of the European Enlighten-
ment. Yet this example would be acknowledged by all as a single sentence, and it is
written as a single sentence.
We can try another approach by deﬁning a sentence as a string of words begin-
ning with a capital (upper case) letter and ending with a full stop (period). This is
a formal deﬁnition: it deﬁnes a term by the form or shape of what the term refers
to. We can at once see that as it stands this deﬁnition is inadequate, since (1) many
sentences end with a question mark or an exclamation mark, and (2) capital letters
are used for names, and full stops are often used in abbreviations. Even if we
amend the deﬁnition to take account of these objections, we still ﬁnd strings
of words in newspaper headlines, titles, and notices that everyone would recognize
as sentences even though they do not end with a full stop, a question mark, or an
exclamation mark:

14
An Introduction to English Grammar
Trees May Be a Source of Pollution
An Irish Airman Foresees his Death (title of poem)
Do not enter
But the most serious objection is that the deﬁnition is directed only towards
orthographic sentences; that is, sentences that appear in the written language.
Spoken sentences, of course, do not have capital letters and full stops.
It is in fact far more difﬁcult to determine the limits of sentences in natural con-
versation, to say where sentences begin and end. That is so partly because people
may change direction as they speak and partly because they tend to make heavy use
of connectors such as and, but, so, and then. Here is a typical example of a speaker
who strings sentences together with and. The symbol <,> denotes a pause.
I’d been working away this week trying to clear up <,> the backlog of
mail caused by me being three weeks away <,> and I thought I was doing
marvellously <,> and at about <,> six o’clock last night <,> I was sorting
through <,> stuff on the desk and I discovered a fat pile of stuff <,> all
carefully opened and documented by Sally that I hadn’t even seen
How many orthographic sentences correspond to the speaker’s story? There is
no one correct answer. In writing it we have a choice: we could punctuate it as one
sentence or we could split it into two or more sentences, each of the later sentences
beginning with and.
Grammarians are not unduly worried about the difﬁculties in deﬁning the sen-
tence. Their approach to the question is formal because they are interested in
grammatical form. Like many people who are not grammarians, they are generally
conﬁdent of recognizing sentences, and they specify the possible patterns for the
sentences. Combinations of words that conform to those patterns are then gram-
matical sentences.
2.2
Irregular sentences and non-sentences
Sentences that conform to the major patterns (cf. 3.13) are regular sentences, and
they are the type that will generally concern us in this book. Sentences that do not
conform to the major patterns are irregular sentences.
If I ask you to write down the ﬁrst sentences that come into your mind, you are
likely to produce regular sentences. Here are some regular sentences in various
major patterns:
David and Helen have three children.
The liquid smelled spicy to Justin.
Some people give their children a daily dose of vitamins.
About a million visitors come to our city every summer.

The Sentence
15
Most irregular sentences are fragmentary sentences. These leave out words that
we can easily supply, usually from the preceding verbal context. Here is a typical
example in an exchange between two speakers:
A:
Where did you put the letter?
B:
In the top drawer.
We interpret B’s reply as I put the letter in the top drawer, and that reconstructed
sentence would be regular. Similarly, the newspaper headline Washington abuzz
over missing intern corresponds to the regular Washington is abuzz over a missing
intern. Fragmentary sentences can therefore be viewed as directly derivable in their
interpretation from regular sentences.
Finally, we often say or write things that are not grammatical sentences. These
non-sentences may simply be mistakes. But they may also be perfectly normal,
although they cannot be analysed grammatically as sentences. Normal non-
sentences include such common expression as Hello!; Yes; No; So long!; Thanks!;
Cheers!; and they include many headlines, headings, titles, labels and notices:
Trafﬁc Chaos (newspaper headline)
On the Nature of the Model (section heading in book)
The Captain and the Kings (title of book)
Naming of Parts (title of poem)
Pure Lemon Juice
No Smoking
In the next chapter we will be looking at the patterns of regular sentences, but ﬁrst
I have a few more general things to say about sentences.
2.3
Simple and multiple sentences
Here are two sentences placed next to each other:
[1]
The inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties. I was one of them.
I can combine the two sentences in [1] merely by putting and between them:
[2]
The inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties, and I was one of them.
I can also combine them by putting a connecting word in front of the ﬁrst sentence:
[3]
When the inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties, I was one of them.
I can make a small change in the second sentence:

16
An Introduction to English Grammar
[4]
The inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties, I being one of them.
A sentence or a sentence-like construction contained within a sentence is called
a clause. Constructions like I being one of them in [4] resemble sentences in that
they can be analysed to a large extent in similar ways (cf. 6.8). The sentences in [2],
[3], and [4] therefore all consist of two clauses. (Strictly speaking, the separate
sentences in [1] are also clauses, but since they have only one clause each, it is
convenient to refer to them just as sentences.)
A sentence that does not contain another clause within it is a simple sentence.
If it contains one or more clauses, it is a multiple sentence.
Here are some more examples of multiple sentences with connecting words:
You can’t insist that your children love each other.
The building was emptied before the bomb-disposal squad was called.
When we returned three hours later, no wolves were in sight.
My father always hoped that I would become a doctor and that must have
been why he took me along when he visited his patients.
We will be looking more closely at multiple sentences in Chapter 6. Meanwhile, I
will be using simple sentences to illustrate general matters about sentences.
2.4
Sentence types
There are four major types of sentences:
1.
Declaratives (or declarative sentences)
She was attracted to an open-air job.
The new proposals have galvanized the normally disparate community into a
potent ﬁghting force.
2.
Interrogatives (or interrogative sentences)
Do you have internet access at home?
Where will you be going for your holiday?
3.
Imperatives (or imperative sentences)
Open the door for me.
Take a seat.
4.
Exclamatives (or exclamative sentences)
How well you look!
What a good friend you are!

The Sentence
17
These four sentence types differ in their form (cf. 6.2–4). They correspond in
general to four major uses:
1.
Statements are used chieﬂy to convey information.
2.
Questions are used chieﬂy to request information.
3.
Directives are used chieﬂy to request action.
4.
Exclamations are used chieﬂy to express strong feeling.
It is usual to refer to interrogatives more simply as questions.
We will be discussing these sentence types and their uses in a later chapter
(cf. 6.1–5). Declaratives are the basic type and I will therefore generally be using
them for illustrative purposes.
2.5
Positive and negative sentences
Sentences are either positive or negative. If an auxiliary (‘helping’) verb is
present, we can usually change a positive sentence into a negative sentence by
inserting not or n’t after the auxiliary. In the following examples, the auxiliaries are
has, is, and can:
Positive:
Nancy has been working here for over a year.
Negative:
Nancy has not been working here for over a year.
Positive:
Dan is paying for the meal.
Negative:
Dan isn’t paying for the meal.
Positive:
I can tell the difference.
Negative:
I can’t tell the difference.
The rules for inserting not and n’t are somewhat complicated. I will return to them
later (cf. 3.3f ).
A sentence may be negative because of some other negative word:
She never had a secretary.
Nobody talked to us.
This is no ordinary painting.
Most sentences are positive, and I will therefore generally be using positive
sentences for my examples.
2.6
Active and passive sentences
Sentences are either active or passive. We can often choose whether to make a
sentence active or passive (cf. 4.15). The choice involves differences in position
and differences in the form of the verb:
Active:
Charles Dickens wrote many novels.
Passive:
Many novels were written by Charles Dickens.

18
An Introduction to English Grammar
Charles Dickens and many novels are at opposite ends of the two sentences. In the
passive sentence by comes before Charles Dickens, and the active wrote corresponds
to the longer were written.
Here are two further examples of pairs of active and passive sentences:
Active:
Manchester United beat Liverpool at Old Trafford.
Passive:
Liverpool were beaten by Manchester United at Old Trafford.
Active:
The Rambert Dance Company won the country’s largest arts
prize, the Prudential Award.
Passive:
The country’s largest arts prize, the Prudential Award, was
won by the Rambert Dance Company.
Actives are far more numerous than passives. Their relative frequency varies with
register. For example, passives tend to be heavily used in formal scientiﬁc writing.
The example sentences in the chapters that follow will generally be active rather
than passive.

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
3.1
Structure, form, function
Consider this sentence:
[1]
A heavy snowfall has blocked the mountain passes.
There are various ways of analysing this. One way is to say that the sentence
contains three units:
A heavy snowfall
has blocked
the mountain passes
We cannot simply arrange the units in any way that we like. For example, [1a] below
is not an English sentence:
[1a]
Has blocked the mountain passes a heavy snowfall.
Sentence [1] has a structure in that there are rules that decide the units that can
co-occur in the sentence and the order in which they can occur.
The three units in [1] are phrases. Phrases also have a structure. We cannot
rearrange the internal order of the three phrases in [1]. These are not English
phrases: heavy snowfall a, blocked has, the passes mountain.
A heavy snowfall and the mountain passes are noun phrases (cf. 4.2) and has
blocked is a verb phrase (cf. 4.11). We characterize them as these types of phrases
because of their structure: in the noun phrases a noun is the main word, while in
the verb phrase a verb is the main word. That kind of characterization describes
the type of structure for each of the three units.
We can also look at the three units from a different point of view; their func-
tion, or how they are used in a particular sentence. For example, in [1] A heavy
snowfall is the subject of the sentence and the mountain passes is the direct object
of the sentence (cf. 3.5–7):

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
21
[1]
A heavy snowfall has blocked the mountain passes.
However, in [2] below a heavy snowfall is the direct object and in [3] the mountain
passes is the subject:
[2]
They encountered a heavy snowfall.
[3]
The mountain passes are now open.
We therefore see that identical phrases may have different functions in different
sentences.
Turning back to [1], we can combine the descriptions by structure and function.
A heavy snowfall is a noun phrase functioning as subject, and the mountain passes is
a noun phrase functioning as direct object. In this chapter we will be examining
the function of the phrases, not their structure. In the next section, we will take a
preliminary look at the functions of the parts of a sentence.
3.2
Subject, predicate, verb
It is traditional to divide the sentence into two main constituents: the subject and
the predicate. The predicate consists of the verb and any other elements of the
sentence apart from the subject:
subject
predicate
I
learned all this much later.
The chef
is a young man with broad experience of the
world.
The fate of the land
parallels the fate of the culture.
The most important constituent of the predicate is the verb. Indeed, it is the most
important constituent in the sentence, since regular sentences may consist of only
a verb: imperatives such as Help! and Look! The verb of the sentence may consist
of more than one word: could have been imagining. The main verb in this verb
phrase comes last: imagining. The verbs that come before the main verb are
auxiliary verbs (‘helping verbs’), or simply auxiliaries: could have been.
I have been following traditional practice in using the word verb in two senses:
1.
Like the subject, the verb is a constituent of sentence structure. In [1] the verb
of the sentence is stroked and in [2] it is has been working:
[1]
Anthony stroked his beard.
[2]
Ellen has been working all day.
2.
A verb is a word, just as a noun is a word. In this sense, [2] contains three
verbs: the auxiliaries has and been and the main verb working. The three verbs
in [2] form a unit, the unit being a verb phrase (cf. 4.11).

22
An Introduction to English Grammar
3.3
Operator
In section 3.2 I divided the sentence into two parts: the subject and the predicate.
I then pointed to the verb as the most important constituent of the predicate.
We can now identify an element in the verb that has important functions in the
sentence: the operator. Another way of analysing the sentence is to say that it
consists of three constituents: the subject, the operator, and the rest of the predicate.
As a ﬁrst approximation, I will say that the operator is the ﬁrst or only auxiliary
in the verb of the sentence. In [1] the verb is could have been imagining:
[1]
You could have been imagining it.
The operator is could, the ﬁrst auxiliary. In [2] the verb is can get:
[2]
Karen can get to the heart of a problem.
The operator is can, the only auxiliary.
The operator plays an essential role in the formation of certain sentence structures:
1.
We form most types of questions by interchanging the positions of the subject
and the operator:
[1]
You could have been imagining it.
[1a]
Could you have been imagining it?
This is known as subject-operator inversion.
2.
We form negative sentences by putting not after the operator. In informal
style, not is often contracted to n’t, and in writing n’t is attached to the
operator; some operators have very different positive and negative forms (e.g.
will in [4] and won’t in [4a]):
[3]
Barbara and Charles are getting married in April.
[3a]
Barbara and Charles ! are not # getting married in April.
@ aren’t $
[4]
Nancy will be staying with us.
[4a]
Nancy ! will not # be staying with us.
@ won’t
$
3.
Operators can carry the stress in speech to convey certain kinds of emphasis:
[5]
A:
Finish your homework.
B:
I HAVE ﬁnished it.
[6]
A:
I am afraid to tell my parents.
B:
You MUST tell them.
4.
Operators are used in various kinds of reduced clauses to substitute for the
predicate:

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
23
[7]
A:
Are you leaving?
B:
Yes, I am.
[8]
Karen and Tom haven’t seen the video, but Jill has.
[9]
I’ll take one if you will.
3.4
Do, Be, Have
In 3.3 I identiﬁed the operator as the ﬁrst or only auxiliary. But many sentences
have no auxiliary, as in [1]:
[1]
Terry works for a public authority.
Here there is only the main verb works. If we want to form the structures speciﬁed
in 3.3, we have to introduce the dummy operator do with the appropriate
endings (do, does, did):
[1a]
Does Terry work for a public authority?
[1b]
Terry doesn’t work for a public authority.
[1c]
Terry does work for a public authority, and her sister does too.
The auxiliary do in these sentences is a dummy operator because it is introduced to
perform the functions of an operator in the absence of ‘true’ operators such as can
and will.
There are two operators that are not auxiliaries. The verb be is used as an
operator even when it is the main verb, provided that it is the only verb:
[2]
It was an awful system.
[2a]
Was it an awful system?
Under the same condition, the main verb have is optionally used as an operator:
[3]
Nora has just one daughter.
[3a]
Has Nora just one daughter?
But with have there is a choice. We can introduce the dummy operator as with
other verbs (Does Nora have just one daughter?) or substitute get as the main verb
(Has Nora got just one daughter?).
3.5
Subject and verb
Regular sentences consist of a subject and a predicate, and the predicate contains
at least a verb (cf. 3.2). Here are some sentences consisting of just the subject and
the verb:

24
An Introduction to English Grammar
subject
verb
A door
opened.
The sun
is setting.
The baby
was crying.
You
must leave.
Many of us
have protested.
They
have been drinking.
Sentences usually contain more than just the subject and the verb. Here are
several examples, with the subject (S) and the verb (V) italicized and labelled:
His black boots (S) had (V) pointed toes and fancy stitching.
It (S) rained (V) every day of our vacation.
Every kind of medical equipment (S) was (V) in short supply.
The subject need not come ﬁrst in the sentence:
Eventually the managing director (S) intervened (V) in the dispute.
Over the years she (S) had collected (V) numerous prizes for academic
achievement.
Sometimes, a word or phrase comes between the subject and the verb:
They (S) often stay (V) with us at weekends.
Or there is an interruption between parts of the verb:
We (S) can (V) never thank (V) this country enough.
The easiest way to identify the subject in a declarative sentence is to turn this
sentence into a yes–no question (one expecting the answer yes or no). The operator
(op) and the subject change places:
[1]
The baby (S) has (op) been crying.
[1a]
Has (op) the baby (S) been crying?
[2]
Every kind of medical equipment (S) was (op) in short supply.
[2a]
Was (op) every kind of medical equipment (S) in short supply?
[3]
Eventually the managing director (S) intervened in the dispute.
[3a]
Did (op) the managing director (S) eventually intervene in the dispute?
It may be necessary to turn other types of sentences into declarative sentences to
identify the subject for this test and the next test. For example, the subject in [1a]
is that part of the sentence that changes place with the operator when the question
is turned into a declarative sentence.

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
25
Another way of identifying the subject of a declarative sentence is by asking
a question introduced by who or what followed by the verb (without subject–
operator inversion). The subject is the constituent that who or what questions:
[4]
Mr Bush (S) talked (V) by telephone with President Jiang Zemin of China.
[4a]
Who (S) talked (V) by telephone with President Jiang Zemin of China?
– Mr Bush.
[5]
Tourism (S) has become (V) the fastest growing industry in our country.
[5a]
What (S) has become (V) the fastest growing industry in our country?
– Tourism.
We can identify the verb of the sentence because it changes its form or contains
auxiliaries to express differences in time (for example, past and present) or attitude
(for example, possibility, permission, and obligation). Here are some examples
with the verb predict:
predicts
was predicting
might predict
predicted
may predict
could have predicted
is predicting
will predict
should have been predicting
We could use any of these forms of predict as the verb in this sentence:
He predicted (V) another world recession.
3.6
Subject
Many grammatical rules refer to the subject. Here are some examples, including
several that I have mentioned earlier:
1.
There are rules for the position of the subject. The subject normally comes
before the verb in declaratives, but in questions it comes after the operator:
[1]
They (S) accepted (V) full responsibility.
[1a]
Did (op) they (S) accept (V) full responsibility?
The subject comes before the verb even in questions if who or what or an
interrogative phrase such as which person is the subject:
[1b]
Who (S) accepted (V) full responsibility?
2.
The subject is normally absent in imperatives:
Help (V) me with the luggage.
3.
Most verbs in the present have a distinctive form ending in -s when the
subject is singular and refers to something or someone other than the speaker
or the person or persons being addressed:

26
An Introduction to English Grammar
The older child (singular S) feeds (singular V) the younger ones.
The older children (plural S) feed (plural V) the younger ones.
The senator (singular S) has (singular V) a clear moral position on racial
equality.
The senators (plural S) have (plural V) a clear moral position on racial
equality.
4.
Some pronouns (words like I, you, she, he, they) have a distinctive form when
they function as subject of the sentence or of clauses in the sentence:
She (S) knows me well.
I (S) know her well, and they (S) know her well too.
5.
The subject determines the form of reﬂexive pronouns (those ending in
-self; such as herself, ourselves, themselves) that appear in the same clause:
I (S) hurt myself badly.
The child cried when he (S) hurt himself badly.
You (S) can look at yourself in the mirror.
She (S) can look at herself in the mirror.
6.
When we turn an active sentence into a passive sentence (cf. 2.6) we change
the subjects:
Active:
The police (S) called the bomb-disposal squad.
Passive:
The bomb-disposal squad (S) was called by the police.
We can also omit the subject of the active sentence when we form the passive
sentence, and indeed we generally do so:
Passive:
The bomb-disposal squad was called.
3.7
Transitive verbs and direct object
If a main verb requires a direct object to complete the sentence, it is a transitive
verb. The term ‘transitive’ comes from the notion that a person (represented by
the subject of the sentence) performs an action that affects some person or thing:
there is a ‘transition’ of the action from the one to the other. Indeed, the direct
object (dO) typically refers to a person or thing directly affected by the action
described in the sentence:
Helen received my email (dO).
They ate all the strawberries (dO).
I dusted the bookshelves in my bedroom (dO).
Anthony stroked his beard (dO).
One way of identifying the direct object in a declarative sentence is by asking a
question introduced by who or what followed by the operator and the subject. The
object is the constituent that who or what questions:

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
27
[1]
Carter has been photographing light bulbs lately.
[1a]
What (dO) has (op) Carter (S) been photographing lately?
– Light bulbs.
[2]
Sandra recorded the adverse effects of the changes.
[2a]
What (dO) did (op) Sandra (S) record?
– The adverse effects of the changes.
[3]
Don is phoning his mother.
[3a]
Who (dO) is (op) Don (S) phoning?
– His mother.
Some grammatical rules refer to the direct object.
1.
The direct object normally comes after the verb (but cf. 3.11).
Carter has been photographing (V) light bulbs (dO) lately.
2.
Some pronouns have a distinctive form when they function as direct object
(cf. 3.6 (4)):
She phoned us (dO) earlier this evening.
We phoned her (dO) earlier this evening.
3.
If the subject and direct object refer to the same person or thing, the direct
object is a reﬂexive pronoun (cf. 3.6(5)):
The children hid themselves.
4.
When we turn an active sentence into a passive sentence, the direct object of
the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence:
Active:
The tests revealed traces of anthrax (dO).
Passive:
Traces of anthrax (S) were revealed by the tests.
In this section I have discussed one basic sentence structure:
SVO:
subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object
3.8
Linking verbs and subject complement
If a verb requires a subject complement (sC) to complete the sentence, the verb is
a linking verb. The subject complement (underlined in the examples that follow)
typically identiﬁes or characterizes the person or thing denoted by the subject:
[1]
Sandra is my mother’s name.
[2]
Your room must be the one next to mine.
[3]
The upstairs tenant seemed a reliable person.
[4]
A university is a community of scholars.

28
An Introduction to English Grammar
[5]
The receptionist seemed very tired.
[6]
You should be more careful.
[7]
The distinction became quite clear.
[8]
The corridor is too narrow.
The most common linking verb is be. Other common linking verbs (with examples
of subject complements in parentheses) include appear (the best plan), become (my
neighbour), seem (obvious),  feel (foolish), get (ready), look (cheerful), sound (strange).
Subject complements are typically noun phrases (cf. 4.2), as in [1]–[4] above, or
adjective phrases (cf. 4.21), as in [5]–[8] above.
We have now looked at two basic sentence structures:
(3.7)
SVO:
subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object
(3.8)
SVC:
subject + (linking) verb + (subject) complement
3.9
Intransitive verbs and adverbials
If a main verb does not require another element to complete it, the verb is
intransitive:
[1]
I (S) agree (V).
[2]
No cure (S) exists (V).
[3]
They (S) are lying (V).
[4]
The protestors (S) were demonstrating (V).
We have now seen three basic sentence structures:
(3.7)
SVO:
subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object
(3.8)
SVC:
subject + (linking) verb + (subject) complement
(3.9)
SV:
subject + (intransitive) verb
The structures are basic because we can always add optional elements to them.
These optional elements are adverbials. Adverbials (A) convey a range of infor-
mation about the situation depicted in the basic structure (cf. 3.14). In [1a] below,
the adverbial noisily depicts the manner of the action, and the adverbial outside the
White House indicates the place of the action:
[1a]
The protestors were demonstrating noisily (A) outside the White House (A).
As [1a] indicates, a sentence may have more than one adverbial.
In [2a] entirely is an intensiﬁer of agree, conveying the intensity of the agreeing:
[2a]
I entirely (A) agree.

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
29
In [3a] unfortunately supplies the writer’s comment:
[3a]
Unfortunately (A), no cure exists.
In [4a] therefore points to a logical connection between the two sentences. The
evidence stated in the ﬁrst sentence is the reason for the assertion in the second
sentence.
[4a]
A reliable witness has testiﬁed that they were in Melbourne on the day
they claimed to be in Sydney. Therefore (A) they are lying.
The sentences [1a]–[4a] with adverbials have the basic structure SV, which we
also see in the parallel sentences [1]–[4] without adverbials. In [5] the basic struc-
ture is SVO and in [6] it is SVC:
[5]
For all its weaknesses (A) the labyrinthine committee structure provides a
useful function in disseminating information.
[6]
Jade is plentiful in this area (A).
In [5] the adverbial has concessive force (‘despite all its weaknesses’) and in [6] it
indicates place.
We should be careful to distinguish adverbials from adverbs (cf. 5.15). The
adverbial, like the subject, is a sentence constituent; the adverb, like the noun, is a
word.
3.10
Adverbial complement
I explained in section 3.9 that adverbials are optional elements in sentence struc-
ture. However, some elements that convey the same information as adverbials are
obligatory because the main verb is not complete without them. Such obligatory
elements are adverbial complements (aC).
Contrast [1] with [1a]:
[1]
The protestors were demonstrating outside the White House (A).
[1a]
The protestors were outside the White House (aC).
In [1] the sentence is complete without the adverbial, but in [1a] the sentence is
not complete without the adverbial complement.
Typically, adverbial complements refer to space, that is, location or direction:
The city lies 225 miles north of Guatemala City (aC).
The nearest inhabitants are a ﬁve-day mule trip away (aC).
George is getting into his wife’s car (aC).
This road goes to Madison (aC).

30
An Introduction to English Grammar
Adverbial complements may convey other meanings:
Their work is in the early stages (aC).
The show will last for three hours (aC).
The children were with their mother (aC).
These letters are for Cindy (aC).
We can now add a fourth basic sentence structure to our set:
(3.7)
SVO:
subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object
(3.8)
SVC:
subject + (linking) verb + (subject) complement
(3.9)
SV:
subject + (intransitive) verb
(3.10)
SVA:
subject + verb + adverbial (complement)
The most common verb in the SVA structure is be.
3.11
Direct object and indirect object
We have seen that a transitive verb requires a direct object to complete the
sentence (cf. 3.7). Some transitive verbs can have two objects: an indirect object
followed by a direct object. The indirect object (iO) refers to a person indirectly
affected by the action described in the sentence. The person generally receives
something or beneﬁts from something:
[1]
Ruth gave my son (iO) a birthday present (dO).
[2]
I can show you (iO) my diploma (dO).
[3]
My friends will save her (iO) a seat (dO).
[4]
You may ask the speaker (iO) another question (dO).
The indirect object is usually equivalent to a phrase introduced by to or for,
but that phrase normally comes after the direct object. Sentences [1a]–[4a] parallel
[1]–[4]:
[1a]
Ruth gave a birthday present to my son.
[2a]
I can show my diploma to you.
[3a]
My friends will save a seat for her.
[4a]
You may ask another question of the speaker.
The structures in [1]–[4] and those in [1a]–[4a] differ somewhat in their use, since
there is a general tendency for the more important information to come at the end
(cf. 9.2). For example, if the son has already been mentioned, but not the birthday
present, we would expect [1] to be used rather than [1a], though in speech we can
indicate the focus of information by giving it prominence in our intonation.

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
31
We can question the indirect object in a way similar to the questioning of the
direct object:
[1b]
Who (iO) did Ruth give a birthday present to?
The grammatical rules that refer to the direct object (cf. 3.7) also refer to the
indirect object:
1.
The indirect object comes after the verb:
Ruth gave my son (iO) a birthday present (dO).
Notice that the indirect object comes before the direct object.
2.
Some pronouns have a distinctive form when they function as indirect object:
I paid her (iO) the full amount.
She paid me (iO) the full amount.
3.
If the subject and indirect object refer to the same person, the indirect object
is generally a reﬂexive pronoun (cf. 3.6(5)):
The managing director paid herself (iO) a huge salary.
4.
When we turn an active sentence into a passive sentence, the indirect object of
the active sentence can become the subject of the passive sentence:
The principal granted Tony (iO) an interview.
Tony (S) was granted an interview.
The direct object can also become the subject, but in that case the indirect
object (if retained) is generally represented by a phrase introduced by to or for:
An interview was granted to Tony.
We can now add a ﬁfth basic sentence structure:
(3.7)
SVO:
subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object
(3.8)
SVC:
subject + (linking) verb + (subject) complement
(3.9)
SV:
subject + (intransitive) verb
(3.10)
SVA:
subject + verb + adverbial (complement)
(3.11)
SVOO:
subject + (transitive) verb + (indirect) object + (direct) object
3.12
Direct object and object complement
In 3.11 we have seen examples of transitive verbs that require two constituents:
an indirect object and a direct object. In this section I introduce the two remain-
ing structures, each of which consists of a subject, a transitive verb, a direct object,
and a complement. In both structures the complement is related to the direct
object.

32
An Introduction to English Grammar
In the ﬁrst structure, the direct object is followed by an object complement
(oC):
[1]
His jokes made the audience (dO) uneasy (oC).
[2]
I declared the meeting (dO) open (oC).
[3]
The heat has turned the milk (dO) sour (oC).
[4]
They elected her (dO) their leader (oC).
This SVOC structure parallels the SVC structure (cf. 3.8), but in the ﬁrst struc-
ture the complement is related to the direct object and in the second it is related to
the subject. Compare [1]–[4] with [1a]–[4a]:
[1a]
The audience (S) is uneasy (sC).
[2a]
The meeting (S) is open (sC).
[3a]
The milk (S) is sour (sC).
[4a]
She (S) is their leader (sC).
Finally, the direct object may be followed by an adverbial complement (aC)
(cf. 3.10):
[5]
You should put (V) the chicken (dO) in the microwave (aC).
[6]
I keep (V) my car (dO) outside the house (aC).
[7]
He stuck (V) his hands (dO) in his pockets (aC).
Just as the SVOC structure parallels the SVC structure, so this SVOA structure
parallels the SVA structure.
[5a]
The chicken (S) is in the microwave (aC).
[6a]
My car (S) is outside the house (aC).
[7a]
His hands (S) are in his pockets (aC).
We have now looked at four basic structures with transitive verbs and direct
objects:
(3.7)
SVO:
subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object
(3.11)
SVOO:
subject + (transitive) verb + (indirect) object + (direct) object
(3.12)
SVOC:
subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object + (object) complement
(3.12)
SVOA:
subject + (transitive) verb + direct (object) + adverbial
(complement)
3.13
The basic sentence structures
I will now summarize what has been described so far in this chapter. The following
elements (major sentence constituents) function in the basic sentence structures:

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
33
subject
S
verb
V
object
O – direct object dO
O – indirect object iO
complement
C – subject complement sC
C – object complement oC
A – adverbial complement aC
These elements enter into the seven basic sentence structures:
1.
SV:
subject + intransitive verb (cf. 3.9)
Someone (S) is talking (V).
2.
SVA:
subject + verb + adverbial complement (cf. 3.10)
My parents (S) are living (V) in Chicago (aC).
3.
SVC:
subject + linking verb + subject complement (cf. 3.8)
I (S) feel (V) tired (sC).
4.
SVO:
subject + transitive verb + direct object (cf. 3.7)
We (S) have ﬁnished (V) our work (dO).
5.
SVOO:
subject + transitive verb + indirect object + direct object (cf. 3.11)
She (S) has given (V) me (iO) the letter (dO).
6.
SVOA:
subject + transitive verb + direct object + adverbial complement
(cf. 3.12)
You (S) can put (V) your coat (dO) in my bedroom (aC).
7.
SVOC:
subject + transitive verb + direct object + object complement
(cf. 3.12)
You (S) have made (V) me (dO) very happy (oC).
The structures depend on the choice of the main verbs, regardless of any
auxiliaries that may be present. The same verb (sometimes in somewhat different
senses) may enter into different structures. Here are some examples:
SV:
I have eaten.
SVO:
I have eaten lunch.
SV:
It smells.
SVC:
It smells sweet.
SVC:
He felt a fool.
SVO:
He felt the material.
SVO:
I made some sandwiches.
SVOO:
I made them some sandwiches.

34
An Introduction to English Grammar
SVO:
I have named my representative.
SVOC:
I have named her my representative.
SV:
The children are growing.
SVO:
The children are growing carrots.
SVC:
The children are growing hungry.
SVO:
She caught me.
SVOO:
She caught me a ﬁsh.
SVOA:
She caught me off my guard.
3.14
The meanings of the sentence elements
The sentence elements are grammatical, not semantic, categories. However, they
are associated with certain meanings. In this section I will illustrate some typical
meanings.
Subject
1.
agentive
In sentences with a transitive or intransitive verb, the subject typically has an
agentive role: the person that performs the action:
Martha has switched on the television.
Caroline is calling.
2.
identiﬁed
The identiﬁed role is typical of structures with a linking verb:
Jeremy was my best friend.
Doris is my sister-in-law.
3.
characterized
The characterized role is also typical of structures with a linking verb:
This brand of coffee tastes better.
Paul is an excellent student.
4.
affected
With intransitive verbs the subject frequently has the affected role: the person
or thing directly affected by the action, but not intentionally performing the
action:
They are drowning.
The water has boiled.
5.
‘it’
Sometimes there is no participant. The subject function is then taken by it,
which is there merely to ﬁll the place of the subject:

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
35
It’s raining.
It’s already eleven o’clock.
It’s too hot.
It’s a long way to Miami.
Verb
The major distinction in meaning is between verbs that are stative and verbs that
are dynamic.
Stative verbs introduce a quality attributed to the subject or a state of affairs:
I am a French citizen.
Their children are noisy.
She has two brothers.
I heard your alarm this morning.
Dynamic verbs introduce events. They refer to something that happens:
Her books sell well.
We talked about you last night.
Your ball has broken my window.
I listened to her respectfully.
Dynamic verbs, but not stative verbs, occur quite normally with the -ing form
(cf. 4.12, 4.14):
Her books are selling well.
We were talking about you last night.
They have been playing in the yard.
She is looking at us.
When stative verbs are used with the -ing form, they have been transformed into
dynamic verbs:
Their children are being noisy. (‘behaving noisily’)
I am having a party next Sunday evening.
Direct object
1.
affected
This is the typical role of the direct object. See subject (4) above.
She shook her head.
I threw the note on the ﬂoor.

36
An Introduction to English Grammar
2.
resultant
The direct object may refer to something that comes into existence as a result
of the action:
He’s written an account of his travels.
I’m knitting a sweater for myself.
3.
eventive
The direct object may refer to an event. The eventive object generally con-
tains a noun that is derived from a verb. In typical use, the noun carries the
main part of the meaning that is normally carried by the verb, and is preceded
by a verb of general meaning, such as do, have, or make:
They were having a quarrel. (cf: They were quarrelling.)
I have made my choice. (cf: I have chosen.)
Indirect object
The indirect object typically has a recipient role: the person that is indirectly
involved in the action, generally the person receiving something or intended to
receive something, or beneﬁting in some way:
They paid me the full amount.
He bought Sandra a bunch of ﬂowers.
David has been showing Andrew his computer printout.
Subject complement and object complement
The complement typically has the role of attribute. It attributes an identiﬁcation
or characterization to the subject – if it is a subject complement (sC) – or the direct
object – if it is an object complement (oC):
sC:
Susan is my accountant.
sC:
Ronald became a paid agitator.
oC:
I have made David my assistant.
oC:
The sun has turned our curtains yellow.
Adverbial
Adverbials have a wide range of meanings, some of which apply to adverbial
complements (cf. 3.10, 3.12). Here are some typical examples:
1.
space
My school is south of the river. (position in space)
She has gone to the bank. (direction)

The Parts of the Simple Sentence
37
2.
time
They’re staying with us for a few weeks. (duration)

3.
manner
The students cheered wildly.
I examined the statement carefully.
4.
degree
I like them very much.
We know her well.
5.
cause
My brother is ill with the ﬂu.
They voted for her out of a sense of loyalty.
6.
comment on truth-value (degree of certainty or doubt)
They certainly won’t ﬁnish on time.
Perhaps he’s out.
7.
evaluation of what the sentence refers to
Luckily, no one was injured.
Unfortunately, both copies were destroyed.
8.
providing a connection between units
I was not friendly with them; however, I did not want them to be treated
unfairly.
We arrived too late, and as a result we missed her.

one of these interrogative words to replace the direct object. Position the operator
and the subject after who or what, as in the following example:
She introduced the school head to her parents. (Who)
Who did she introduce to her parents?
1.

*Exercise 3.9 Transitive verbs and direct object (cf. 3.7)
In each sentence below, underline the direct objects. If a sentence contains more
than one clause, it may have more than one direct object. For example, in the
following sentence there are two direct objects:

expect much gratitude.
1.
The president promised the end of racial discrimination, but he rejected the
black demand for one man, one vote.
2.
That sort of democracy would mean rule by a black majority, which might feel
an understandable urge for retribution for past oppressions.
3.
Whites, equally understandably, want safeguards for white rights, but you
cannot ensure safeguards once you surrender your power.
4.
Having made his gamble, the president will ﬁnd himself under pressure from
two directions.
5.
Among blacks he has created an upward surge of expectations which he may
be unable to fulﬁl.

A small set of verbs have been called ‘middle verbs’. They are illustrated in the
following sentences:

The Structures of Phrases
4.1
Phrase types
When we looked earlier (3.1) at the parts of the simple sentence, we noticed that
they can be viewed in terms of either their structure or their function. In Chapter
3 we were mainly concerned with their function in the sentence, and we distinguished
functional elements such as subject and direct object. In this chapter we are mainly
concerned with the internal structure of the elements. For the simple sentence,
this means the structure of the various phrases that can function in the sentence as
subject, verb, etc.
There are ﬁve types of phrases:
1.
noun phrase
a peaceful result
(main word: noun result)
2.
verb phrase
must have been dreaming
(main word: verb dreaming)
3.
adjective phrase
very pleasant
(main word: adjective pleasant)
4.
adverb phrase
very carefully
(main word: adverb carefully)
5.
prepositional phrase
in the shade
(main word: preposition in)
In grammar, the technical term phrase is used even if there is only one word –
the main word alone; for example, both very pleasant and pleasant are adjective
phrases. This may seem strange at ﬁrst, since in everyday use the word phrase
applies to a sequence of at least two words. There is a good reason for the wider
use of the term in grammar. Many rules that apply to an adjective phrase apply
also to an adjective. For example, the same rules apply to the positions of very
pleasant and pleasant in these sentences:
It was a ! pleasant
# occasion.
@ very pleasant $
The party was ! pleasant.
@ very pleasant.

The Structures of Phrases
47
Instead of specifying each time ‘adjective phrase or adjective’ it is simpler to
specify ‘adjective phrase’ and thereby include adjectives.
In the sections that follow we will be looking at the structures of the ﬁve types of
phrases, but I will make several general points now. First, a phrase may contain
another phrase within it. Or, to put it another way, one phrase may be embedded
within another phrase.
[1]
We had some very pleasant times in Florida.
[2]
They were standing in the shade of a large oak tree.
In [1] the noun phrase some very pleasant times has the adjective phrase very
pleasant embedded between some and times. In [2] the prepositional phrase consists
of the preposition in and the noun phrase the shade of a large oak tree; in the noun
phrase another prepositional phrase (of a large oak tree) is embedded as a modiﬁer
of shade and that phrase contains the noun phrase a large oak tree. A clause (cf. 2.3)
may also be embedded in a phrase:
[3]
The school that I attend is quite small.
In [3] the clause that I attend is embedded in the noun phrase the school that I
attend.
A second point is that phrases are deﬁned by their structure, but they are also
characterized by their potential functions. For example, a noun phrase may func-
tion (among other possibilities) as a subject, direct object, or indirect object.
Third, there is an inevitable circularity in talking about phrases and words: a
noun is a word that can be the main word in a noun phrase, and a noun phrase is
a phrase whose main word is a noun.
We will be examining classes of words more closely in the next chapter, but the
classes must enter into the discussions of phrases in this chapter. The examples
should be a sufﬁcient indication of the types of words that are involved.
T H E  N O U N  P H R A S E
4.2
The structure of the noun phrase
The main word in a noun phrase is a noun or a pronoun. There are a number of
subclasses of nouns and pronouns, but I will postpone discussion of subclasses
until we come to look at word classes (cf. 5.4, 5.17).
The structure of the typical noun phrase may be represented schematically in
the following way, where the parentheses indicate elements of the structure that
may be absent:

48
An Introduction to English Grammar
(determiners)
(pre-modiﬁers)
noun
(post-modiﬁers)
Determiners (words like the, a, those, some) introduce noun phrases. Modiﬁers are
units that are dependent on the main word and can be omitted. Modiﬁers that
come before the noun are pre-modiﬁers, and those that come after the noun are
post-modiﬁers. Here are examples of possible structures of noun phrases:
noun
books
determiner + noun
those books
pre-modiﬁer + noun
new books
determiner + pre-modiﬁer + noun
some long books
noun + post-modiﬁer
books on astronomy
determiner + noun + post-modiﬁer
some books on astronomy
pre-modiﬁer + noun + post-modiﬁer
popular books on astronomy
determiner + pre-modiﬁer + noun +
post-modiﬁer
some popular books on astronomy
All these examples can ﬁt into the blank in this sentence:
I occasionally read .....................
4.3
Determiners
There are three classes of determiners (cf. 5.26–30):
1.
pre-determiners, e.g. all, both, half
2.
central determiners, e.g. a(n), the, those
3.
post-determiners, e.g. other, two, ﬁrst
Here are two examples with determiners from each class:
all these other works
both our two daughters
4.4
Modiﬁers
The noun phrase may have more than one pre-modiﬁer or post-modiﬁer:
a long hot summer
acute, life-threatening diseases
a nasty gash on his chin which needed medical attention
There are two post-modiﬁers in the last example because each separately modiﬁes
gash: a nasty gash on his chin; a nasty gash which needed medical attention. The
modiﬁer may itself be modiﬁed (cf. 4.21):

The Structures of Phrases
49
a comfortably cool room
the investigation of crimes against children
A modiﬁer may also be discontinuous, one part coming before the noun and the
other part after it:
the easiest children to teach
Compare:
the children (who are) easiest to teach
4.5
Relative clauses
One very common type of post-modiﬁer is the relative clause:
He had a nasty gash which needed medical attention.
The relative clause is embedded in the noun phrase. As an independent sentence it
might be:
[1]
The gash needed medical attention.
We might think of the embedding as a process that takes place in stages. The ﬁrst
stage puts the sentence close to the noun it will be modifying:
[1a]
He had a nasty gash. The gash needed medical attention.
You will notice that the two sentences share nouns (gash) that refer to the same
thing. The next stage changes the noun phrase into a relative pronoun (cf. 5.24) –
here which:
[1b]
He had a nasty gash which needed medical attention.
The relative pronoun which functions as subject in the relative clause just as The
gash functions as subject in [1a].
Here is another example:
[2]
The woman is an engineering student. The woman was sitting next to you.
[2a]
The woman (The woman was sitting next to you) is an engineering student.
[2b]
The woman who was sitting next to you is an engineering student.
In both [1b] and [2b] the relative pronoun can be replaced by relative that:

50
An Introduction to English Grammar
[1c]
He had a nasty gash that needed medical attention.
[2c]
The woman that was sitting next to you is an engineering student.
For the choice of relative pronouns, see 5.24.
4.6
Appositive clauses
Another type of clause that is often embedded in a noun phrase is the appositive
clause. It is introduced by the conjunction that:
the assumption that people act out of self-interest
the fact that she rejected his offer of marriage
the realization that miracles don’t happen
the news that agreement has been reached
The conjunction that in appositive clauses differs from the relative that (cf. 4.5)
because the conjunction does not have a function within its clause. The appositive
clause can be a sentence without that:
[1]
You must have heard the news that agreement has been reached.
[1a]
Agreement has been reached.
In contrast, the relative clause cannot be a sentence without the relative that:
[2]
He had a nasty gash that needed medical attention.
[2a]
*Needed medical attention.
We can convert the noun phrase containing the appositive clause into a sentence
by inserting a form of the verb be before the clause:
[3]
the assumption that people act out of self-interest.
[3a]
The assumption is that people act out of self-interest.
4.7
Apposition
Apposition is a relationship between two noun phrases which have identical
reference:
Bono, the lead singer with U2, also took part.
As with the appositive clause, we can show that the lead singer with U2 is in
apposition to Bono by converting the two phrases into a sentence:
Bono is the lead singer with U2.

The Structures of Phrases
51
Here are some more examples of noun phrases in apposition:
our Political Correspondent, Eleanor Goodman
vitamin B12, a complex cobalt-containing molecule
the witness, a burly man with heavy stubble
the rattlesnake, a venomous animal capable of causing death in human beings
Apposition is sometimes signalled by expressions such as namely and that is to say:
You can read the story in the ﬁrst book of the Bible, namely Genesis.
4.8
Coordination
We can coordinate (‘link’) noun phrases with and or or:
all the senators and some of their aides
law schools or medical schools
my sister, her husband, and their three children
We can also coordinate parts of a noun phrase. Coordinated modiﬁers may apply
as a unit:
wholesome and tasty food [food that is both wholesome and tasty]
a calm and reassuring gesture [a gesture that is both calm and reassuring]
an appetizer of blackberries and raspberries [an appetizer that consists of
both blackberries and raspberries]
Or they may apply separately:
chemical and biological weapons [chemical weapons and biological weapons]
electric and magnetic ﬁelds [electric ﬁelds and magnetic ﬁelds]
large or small classes [large classes or small classes]
houses along the coast and on the lower hills [houses along the coast and
houses on the lower hills]
A determiner may serve two or more nouns or modiﬁed nouns:
his wife and two sons [his wife and his two sons]
some friends and close acquaintances [some friends and some close
acquaintances]
the reactions of the students and teachers [the reactions of the students
and the reactions of the teachers]

52
An Introduction to English Grammar
It is sometimes possible to interpret coordination of parts of phrases in more
than one way:
frustrated and desperate men
(1)
frustrated men and desperate men
(2)
men who are both frustrated and desperate
old men and women
(1)
old men and old women
(2)
women and old men
their cats and other pets
(1)
their cats and their other pets
(2)
other pets and their cats
4.9
Noun phrase complexity
Noun phrases can display considerable structural complexity. It is easy to embed
in them appositional structures, clauses, and linked noun phrases. Both the subject
and the direct object in [1] are complex noun phrases:
[1]
Wordsworth’s several reactions to tourism’s threat to treasured precincts ex-
hibit tendencies we can also observe in many nineteenth- and twentieth-century
records.
[James Buzard, The Beaten Track, p. 30. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993]
Here are two other examples of complex noun phrases functioning as subject of the
sentences:
[2]
A full-blown ﬁnancial collapse of the kind last seen in the 1930s is not out of
the question.
[3]
Iron resolve in the ﬁght against internationalism terrorism and determined
leadership on the budget and the economy could make Mr Bush the president
no one ever really thought he could be.
In [4] the complex noun phrase is subject complement and in [5] it is a direct
object:
[4]
Taxonomy is a practical science used to distinguish, name, and arrange plants
and other organisms in a logical way.
[5]
Daniel Blumenthal gives performances of the two concertante pieces which
convincingly combine Ravelian delicacy of articulation with genuine feeling for
the jazz-based idiom.

For noun phrases as dependent or independent genitives, see 5.8.
T H E  V E R B  P H R A S E
4.11
The structure of the verb phrase
The typical structure of the verb phrase consists of a main verb preceded option-
ally by a maximum of four auxiliary verbs. The four belong to different subclasses
of auxiliaries.

54
An Introduction to English Grammar
auxiliary 1
auxiliary 2
auxiliary 3
auxiliary 4
main verb
It is very unusual for all four auxiliaries to appear in one verb phrase, but if two or
more auxiliaries co-occur they must appear in the sequence indicated in the dia-
gram, e.g. 1+3, 1+2+4, 2+3. For the four subclasses, see 4.17 below.
4.12
Main verbs
Regular main verbs have four forms that are constructed in this way:
1.
base form:
The base form is what we ﬁnd in dictionary entries: laugh, mention, play.
2.
-s form:
The -s form adds to the base form an ending in -s: laughs, mentions, plays.
3.
-ing participle:
The -ing participle adds to the base form an ending in -ing: laughing, mention-
ing, playing.
4.
-ed form (past or -ed participle):
The -ed form adds to the base form an ending in -ed: laughed, mentioned,
played.
The addition of the endings involves some rules of pronunciation and spelling
that depend on how the base form ends. For example, the -ed ending is pronounced
as a separate syllable in loaded but not in laughed; the ﬁnal consonant of the base
form is doubled in the spelling of plotted but not in the spelling of revolted. Simi-
larly, the -s ending is pronounced as a separate syllable and spelled -es in passes.
(For the spelling rules, see A.4. in the Appendix.)
The -ed form represents two distinct functions that are differentiated in the
forms of some irregular verbs. Contrast the one form for laugh in the following sets
of sentences with the two forms of give and speak:
past
She laughed at us.
She gave us a smile.
She spoke to us.
-ed participle
She has laughed at us.
She has given us a smile.
She has spoken to us.
Irregular main verbs have either fewer or more forms than regular main verbs.
For example, put has only three forms: put, puts, putting. Put serves as the base
form and also as the -ed form in the functions of the past and of the -ed participle:

The Structures of Phrases
55
base form
They always put the cat out at night.
-ed form: past
They put the cat out last night.
-ed form: -ed participle
They have put the cat out.
The irregular verb be has the most forms, eight in all:
base form
be
present
am, is, are
past
was, were
-ing participle
being
-ed participle
been
For the differences in the present forms and in the past forms of be, see 4.13.
4.13
Tense, person, and number
The ﬁrst or only verb in the verb phrase is marked for tense, person, and
number.
Tense is a grammatical category referring to the time of the situation; the tense
is indicated by the form of the verb. There are two tense forms: present and past.
There are three persons: ﬁrst person (the person or persons speaking or writing),
second person (the person or persons addressed), and third person (others).
There are two numbers: singular and plural.
For all verbs except be, there are two forms for the present: the -s form and the
base form. The -s form is used for the third person singular, that is with he, she, it,
and singular noun phrases as subject:
He plays football every day.
The road seems narrower.
The base form is used for all other subjects: I, you, we, they, and plural noun
phrases as subject:
I play football every day.
The roads seem narrower.
Be has three forms for the present tense, which are distinct from the base form be:
am – ﬁrst person singular
is – third person singular
are – others
For all verbs except be, there is only one past form:

56
An Introduction to English Grammar
He (or They) played football yesterday.
The road (or roads) seemed narrower.
Be has two forms for the past:
was – ﬁrst and third person singular
were – others
The two tenses are related to distinctions in time, but they do not correspond
precisely to the difference between present and past in the real world. The present
tense generally refers to a time that includes the time of speaking but usually
extends backward and forward in time:
Three and ﬁve make eight.
We live in Sydney.
I work in the steel industry.
They are my neighbours.
Sometimes the present refers to an event that is simultaneous with the time of
speaking:
Here comes your sister.
I nominate Robert.
4.14
Aspect
Aspect is a grammatical category referring to the way that the time of a situation is
viewed by the speaker or writer; the aspect is indicated by a combination of auxiliary
and verb form. Verbs have two aspects: the perfect aspect and the progressive aspect.
The perfect of a verb combines a form of the auxiliary have with the -ed par-
ticiple of that verb. The auxiliary has two present tense forms (has, have) and one
past form (had). For example, the present perfect of close is has closed or have
closed and the past perfect is had closed:
I have closed the shop for the day.
The shop has closed for the day.
The police had closed the shop months ago.
The present perfect refers to a situation set in some indeﬁnite period that leads
to the present. The situation may be a state of affairs that extends to the present:
They have been unhappy for a long time.
I have lived here since last summer.
We have always liked them.

Or it may be an event or set of events that is viewed as possibly recurring:
We have discussed your problems.
I have phoned him every day since he fell ill.
He has read only newspapers until now.
The past perfect refers to a situation earlier than another situation set in the past:
We had heard a lot about her before we ever met her.
In many contexts, the present perfect and the past perfect can be replaced by
the past.
The progressive combines a form of the auxiliary be with the -ing participle. The
present progressive and the past progressive are illustrated below:
You are neglecting your work.
I am resting just now.
The children were ﬁghting all morning.
We were waiting for you in the lobby.
The progressive indicates that the situation is in progress. It may therefore also
imply that it lasts for only a limited period and that it is not ended. Contrast I
read a novel last night (which implies that I ﬁnished it) with I was reading a novel
last night.
4.15
Voice
Verbs have two voices: active and passive. The active is the voice that is used
most commonly. The active and passive have different verb phrases in that the
passive has an additional auxiliary: a form of the auxiliary be followed by an -ed
participle. Here are examples of corresponding active and passive verb phrases:
Active
Passive
loves
is loved
sold
was sold
is ﬁghting
is being fought
has reconstructed
has been reconstructed
will proclaim
will be proclaimed
may have asserted
may have been asserted
should be purifying
should be being puriﬁed
The passive is a way of phrasing the sentence so that the subject does not refer
to the person or thing responsible (directly or indirectly) for the action. The

58
An Introduction to English Grammar
passive therefore differs from the corresponding active not only in the forms of the
verb phrases but also in the positions of certain noun phrases. The direct object
(dO) or the indirect object (iO) of the active sentence becomes the subject (S) of
the corresponding passive sentence, and the subject (if retained) appears after the
verb in a by-phrase:
Active:
A team of detectives (S) is investigating the crime (dO)
Passive:
The crime (S) is being investigated by a team of detectives.
Active:
The new management (S) has offered employees (iO) a better
deal.
Passive:
Employees (S) have been offered a better deal by the new
management.
Active:
Three bullets (S) penetrated his heart (dO).
Passive:
His heart (S) was penetrated by three bullets.
Active:
Scientists (S) predicted the location, extent, and strength of the
earthquake (dO) with unprecedented accuracy.
Passive:
The location, extent, and strength of the earthquake (S) were
predicted by scientists with unprecedented accuracy.
Generally the passive sentence does not contain the by-phrase:
Britain’s reservations on these points were duly noted.
Most of the buildings were destroyed.
The decision has already been taken.
The most common reason for using the passive is to avoid referring to the
person performing the action. That may be because the identity of the person is
not known or because it is felt to be unnecessary to identify the person (perhaps
because it is irrelevant or obvious) or it is felt to be tactless to do so:
He was immediately admitted to the hospital.
The refrigerator door has not been properly closed.
Some -ed participle forms may be used as adjectives. In the following sentences
the -ed forms are adjectives, not passive participles:
She was annoyed with them.
I am worried about Edward.
My teachers are pleased with my progress.
These sentences look like passive sentences, but the -ed words are adjectives if one
or more of these possibilities apply:

The Structures of Phrases
59
1.
if they can be modiﬁed by very (for example, very annoyed);
2.
if they can occur with a linking verb other than be (for example, became worried);
3.
if they can be linked with another adjective (for example, angry and worried).
The -ed participle form is obviously an adjective in Many seats were unsold when I
rang the ticket ofﬁce because there is no verb unsell.
4.16
Expressing future time
In 4.13 I stated that verbs have only two tenses: present and past. How then do we
refer to future time?
There are only two tenses in the sense that these are the two distinctions that we
make through the forms of the verbs. However, there are various ways of express-
ing future time. One way is through the simple present tense:
My sister arrives tomorrow.
The most common way is by combining will (or the contraction ’ll) with the
base form:
My sister will arrive tomorrow.
I’ll talk to you next week.
Many speakers in England also use shall instead of will when the subject is I or we:
I shall make a note of your request.
Two other common ways are the use of be going to and the present progressive:
I’m going to study during the vacation.
We’re playing your team next week.
4.17
The sequence of auxiliaries
In 4.11 I referred to the four types of auxiliaries. Here again is the diagram
representing the sequence:
auxiliary 1
auxiliary 2
auxiliary 3
auxiliary 4
main verb
If we choose to use auxiliaries, they must appear in the following sequence:
[1]
modal auxiliary, such as can, may, will (cf. 5.31)
[2]
perfect auxiliary have

60
An Introduction to English Grammar
[3]
progressive auxiliary be
[4]
passive auxiliary be
These four uses of the auxiliaries specify the form of the verb that follows:
[1]
modal, followed by base form: may phone
[2]
perfect have, followed by -ed participle: have phoned
[3]
progressive be, followed by -ing participle: was phoning
[4]
passive be, followed by -ed participle: was phoned
Gaps in the sequence are of course normal:
[1] + [3]:
will be phoning (modal + progressive)
[2] + [4]:
has been phoned (perfect + passive)
[2] + [3]:
has been phoning (perfect + progressive)
[1] + [4]:
can be phoned (modal + passive)
The sequence does not take account of the dummy operator do (cf. 3.4), which is
introduced when there would otherwise not be an auxiliary in the verb phrase.
In this function, do is therefore the only auxiliary present. It is followed by the
base form:
I did phone.
Did you phone?
I did not phone.
Martha phoned, and I did too.
There are also phrasal auxiliaries, which are intermediate between auxiliaries
and main verbs. Here are some examples:
Sandra is going to apply for the job.
I had better eat now.
My parents are about to leave.
We have got to speak to her.
He may be able to help us.
Jennifer is supposed to phone us today.
Only the ﬁrst word in a phrasal auxiliary is a true auxiliary, since only that word
functions as an operator, for example in forming questions (cf. 3.3):
Is Sandra going to apply for the job?
Had I better eat now?
Is Jennifer supposed to phone us today?

The Structures of Phrases
61
The phrasal auxiliaries may come together to make a long string of verbs:
We seem to be going to have to keep on paying the full fee.
They are likely to be about to manage to start working on our project.
4.18
Finite and non-ﬁnite verb phrases
Verb phrases are either ﬁnite or non-ﬁnite. A ﬁnite verb is a verb that carries a
contrast in tense between present and past, and may also be marked for person and
number. In a ﬁnite verb phrase the ﬁrst or only verb is ﬁnite, and the other verbs
(if any) are non-ﬁnite. In a non-ﬁnite verb phrase all the verbs are non-ﬁnite. Play
and played are ﬁnite verbs in these sentences:
[1]
We play football every day.
[2]
We played in a football match last week.
Play is in the present tense in [1] and played is in the past tense in [2]. In [3] plays
is the third person singular form of the present:
[3]
She plays hockey.
On the other hand, in [4] will is the ﬁnite verb (the past of will is would), whereas
play is non-ﬁnite:
[4]
We will play football later today.
Similarly, in [5] have is the ﬁnite verb and played is non-ﬁnite:
[5]
We have played football every day this week.
All the verb phrases in [1]–[5] are ﬁnite verb phrases because they begin with a
ﬁnite verb.
The following are the non-ﬁnite verb forms:
1.
the inﬁnitive, often introduced by to: (to) phone
2.
the -ing participle: phoning
3.
the -ed participle: phoned
If one of these forms is the ﬁrst or only verb in the verb phrase, the phrase is a
non-ﬁnite verb phrase:
He was afraid to predict the next day’s weather.
Having stayed in their house, I can remember how frequently they quarrelled.
The new system, described in a recent report, provides criteria for evaluating
scientiﬁc priorities.

62
An Introduction to English Grammar
The inﬁnitive has the base form. It is the inﬁnitive that is used after modals and
after the dummy operator do:
I may see you later.
I may be there later.
I did tell them.
Non-ﬁnite verb phrases normally do not occur as the verb phrase of an inde-
pendent sentence. Contrast:
[6]
His job was to predict the next day’s weather.
[7]
He predicted the next day’s weather.
The verb of the sentence in [6] is was, not the inﬁnitive to predict (cf. To predict the
next day’s weather was his job).
4.19
Mood
Mood refers to distinctions in the form of the verb that express the attitude of the
speaker to what is said. Finite verb phrases have three moods:
1.
indicative
2.
imperative
3.
subjunctive
The indicative is the usual mood in declarative, interrogative, and exclamative
sentences:
Roger has known me for a long time.
How well does Rosalind play?
What a heavy coat you are wearing!
The imperative has the base form. It is used chieﬂy as a directive to request
action:
Stop them!
There are two forms of the subjunctive: the present subjunctive and the past
subjunctive. The traditional terms are misnomers, since the difference between the
two is not one of tense.
The present subjunctive has the base form. It is used in:
1.
that-clauses after the expression of such notions as demand or request:
[1]
We demand that he take the witness stand.
[2]
I accept your suggestion that my secretary omit this item from the minutes.

The Structures of Phrases
63
[3]
My boss insists that I be on time.
[4]
I move that the meeting be adjourned.
In verbs other than be, the present subjunctive has a distinctive form only in the
third person singular: the base form, which contrasts with the indicative form
ending in -s. In other singular persons and in plurals, the base form is the same as
the present tense form. Contrast [1] with [1a]:
[1a]
We demand that they take the witness stand.
For all persons the negative sentence need not have an operator (cf. 3.31):
[1b]
We demand that he/they not take the witness stand.
[4a]
I move that the meeting not be adjourned.
In the contexts exempliﬁed in [1]–[4] we commonly use should followed by the
base form, instead of the subjunctive:
[1c]
We demand that he should take the witness stand.
[3a]
My boss insists that I should be on time.
Another possibility, when the verb is not be, is the indicative:
[1d]
We demand that he takes the witness stand.
2.
certain set expressions:
Long live the Republic!
Be that as it may, . . .
The past subjunctive were is used chieﬂy to convey that the speaker is not sure
that the situation will happen or is happening:
[5]
If he were to be appointed, I would leave.
[6]
If they were in the city, they would contact us.
[7]
I wish you were here.
[8]
I wish I were somewhere hotter than here.
Were is also the past indicative form, so that the subjunctive and indicative are
identical except where was is required as a past indicative – in the ﬁrst and third
persons singular (I was, he was). Were therefore is a distinctive form as subjunctive
only in [5] and [8]. In fact, except in formal style, indicative was is commonly used
in place of the past subjunctive in the ﬁrst and third persons singular:

64
An Introduction to English Grammar
[5a]
If he was to be appointed, I would leave.
[8a]
I wish I was somewhere hotter than here.
4.20
Multi-word verbs
Multi-word verbs are combinations of a verb and one or more other words. They
are called multi-word verbs because in certain respects they behave as a single verb.
The most frequent types of multi-word verbs consist of a verb followed by one
or more particles (words that do not change their form) such as at, away, by, and
for. The three major types of these combinations are:
phrasal verbs, e.g. give in, blow up
prepositional verbs, e.g. look after, approve of
phrasal-prepositional verbs, e.g. look down on, catch up with
There are sometimes one-word verbs that are similar in meaning to the multi-
word verbs. The one-word verbs are more formal:
phrasal verb
give in
– surrender
prepositional verb
look after
– tend
phrasal prepositional verb
put up with – tolerate
Phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs are a combination of a verb and one
particle, whereas phrasal-prepositional verbs have two particles. A preposi-
tional verb requires an object to complete the sentence:
[1]
Peter is looking after his elderly parents.
A transitive phrasal verb also requires an object:
[2]
All the students have handed in their essays.
An intransitive phrasal verb does not require an object:
[3]
I give up.
We can distinguish transitive phrasal verbs from prepositional verbs by testing
whether the particle can come before the object as well as after the object. The
particle of a phrasal verb can take either position because it is an adverb and like
most adverbs it is not conﬁned to one position.
[1a]
All the students have handed in their essays.
[2b]
All the students have handed their essays in.

The Structures of Phrases
65
If the object is a personal pronoun, however, the particle in a phrasal verb normally
must come after the object:
[2c]
All the students have handed them in.
On the other hand, the particle of a prepositional verb is a preposition and must
always come before the object, as in [1] above and in [1a]:
[1a]
Peter is looking after them.
Further examples of intransitive phrasal verbs are in [4]–[6] and transitive
phrasal verbs in [7]–[9]:
[4]
The discussions went on for a long time.
[5]
They stood up when she entered the room.
[6]
The excitement has died down.
[7]
I can’t make out your handwriting.
[7a]
I can’t make your handwriting out.
[8]
We should put off the decision until the next meeting.
[8a]
We should put the decision off until the next meeting.
[9]
Cornelia has ﬁnally brought out her new book.
[9a]
Cornelia has ﬁnally brought her new book out.
There are three types of prepositional verbs. The ﬁrst type is followed by a
prepositional object, which differs from direct and indirect objects in that a
preposition introduces it:
[10]
My aunt is looking after my brothers.
[11]
The principal called for references.
[12]
Heavy smoking leads to cancer.
Like other objects, prepositional objects can be questioned by who or what:
[10a]
Who is your aunt looking after?
– My brothers.
[12a]
What does heavy smoking lead to?
– Cancer.
And they can often be made the subject of a corresponding passive sentence:
[11a]
References were called for.

66
An Introduction to English Grammar
The second type of prepositional verb has two objects: a direct object and a pre-
positional object. The direct object comes before the particle, and the prepositional
object follows the particle:
[13]
He blamed the accident on the weather.
[14]
You may order a drink for me.
[15]
I have explained the procedure to the children.
[16]
They were making fun of you.
[17]
I have just caught sight of them.
In some cases the direct object is part of an idiomatic unit, as in make fun of [16]
and catch sight of [17].
The third type of prepositional verb also has two objects, but the ﬁrst is an
indirect object:
They told us about your success.
She forgave me for my rude remark.
I congratulated her on her promotion.
The indirect object refers to a person who typically has the recipient role (cf. 3.14).
The preposition in all three types of prepositional verbs ordinarily cannot be
moved from its position. But if the style is formal, in certain structures such as
questions and relative clauses it may move with the object to the front. For
example, the prepositional object in [13] is normally questioned like this:
[13a]
What did he blame the accident on?
But we could also place on in front, in a more formal style:
[13b]
On what did he blame the accident?
Finally, there are two types of phrasal-prepositional verbs, which have two
particles (an adverb followed by a preposition). The ﬁrst type has just the preposi-
tional object:
I have been catching up on my reading.
They look down on their neighbours.
The second type has a direct object and a prepositional object:
I have put his problem down to inexperience.
We put him up for election.

The Structures of Phrases

T H E  A D J E C T I V E  P H R A S E
4.21
The structure of the adjective phrase
The main word in an adjective phrase is an adjective. The structure of the typical
adjective phrase may be represented in the following way, where the parentheses
indicate elements of the structure that may be absent:
(pre-modiﬁers)
adjective
(post-modiﬁers)
Modiﬁers qualify in some respect what is denoted by the adjective, and they are
optional. The pre-modifer comes before the adjective and the post-modiﬁer comes
after it.
Some post-modiﬁers complete what is implied in the meaning of the adjective.
For example, if we say Tom is afraid we intend this to mean that Tom is ﬁlled with
fear in some respect. The post-modiﬁer speciﬁes in what respect:
1 of spiders.
4 for his job.
[1]
Tom is afraid 2 to say anything.
4
3 that no one will believe him.
A few adjectives (at least in certain senses) must have a post-modiﬁer:
[2]
Mary is fond of children.
[3]
I am aware that he is abroad.
[4]
The contract is subject to approval by my committee.
Some adjectives that take obligatory post-modiﬁers resemble verbs in their meaning:
[1a]
Tom fears that no one will believe him.
[2a]
Mary likes children.
[3a]
I know that he is abroad.
[4a]
The contract requires approval by my committee.
Here are some examples of possible structures of adjective phrases:
adjective
happy
pre-modiﬁer + adjective
very happy
adjective + post-modiﬁer
happy to see you
pre-modiﬁer + adjective + post-modiﬁer
very happy that you could
join us

68
An Introduction to English Grammar
4.22
Functions of adjective phrases
These are the main possible functions of adjective phrases:
1.
pre-modiﬁer in a noun phrase
He was a tall man, dressed in a blue suit.
2.
subject complement
The photographs were quite professional.
3.
object complement
My parents made me aware of my ﬁlial responsibilities.
4.
post-modiﬁer in a noun phrase
The OS/2 makes good use of the memory available.
Indeﬁnite pronouns, such as somebody, require the adjective phrase to follow them:
You should choose somebody older.
I bought something quite expensive today.
There are also some set expressions (mostly legal or ofﬁcial designations) where
the adjective follows the noun:
heir apparent
attorney general
court martial
notary public
Here are some more examples of adjective phrases as post-modiﬁers of noun
phrases:
the earliest time possible
in years past
the people responsible
the weapons involved
Central adjectives are adjectives that can fulﬁl all the four possible functions
listed above. There are also some adjectives that can be only pre-modiﬁers and
others that cannot be pre-modiﬁers (cf. 5.13).
Adjectives can be partially converted into nouns and then like nouns can func-
tion as heads of noun phrases. Typically, such phrases refer to well-established
classes of persons, such as the disabled, the poor, the sick, the unemployed, the young.
Nationality adjectives are commonly used in this way, too: the British, the English,
the French, the Irish. These noun phrases are plural, even though the adjectives do
not have a plural ending:
The sick require immediate attention.
The British are coming.

The Structures of Phrases
69
Some adjectives, particularly superlatives (cf. 5.14), function as heads of noun
phrases that are abstract. These noun phrases are singular:
The best is yet to come.
The latest is that our team is winning.
Here are a few common examples of such phrases in set expressions:
from the sublime to the ridiculous
out of the ordinary
We have much in common.
I’m leaving for good.
I’ll tell you in private.
The situation went from bad to worse.
T H E  A D V E R B  P H R A S E
4.23
The structure of the adverb phrase
The main word in an adverb phrase is an adverb. The structure of the typical
adverb phrase is similar to that of the typical adjective phrase, except for the class
of the main word:
(pre-modiﬁers)
adverb
(post-modiﬁers)
Here are some examples of possible structures of adverb phrases:
adverb
surprisingly
pre-modiﬁer + adverb
very surprisingly
adverb + post-modiﬁer
surprisingly for her
pre-modiﬁer + adverb + post-modiﬁer
very surprisingly indeed
4.24
Functions of adverb phrases
Adverbs have two main functions, but particular adverbs may have only one of
these:
1.
modiﬁer of an adjective or an adverb in phrase structure
2.
adverbial in sentence structure
Here are examples of adverbs as modiﬁers:

70
An Introduction to English Grammar
1.
modiﬁer of an adjective
The description was remarkably accurate.
2.
modiﬁer of an adverb
The new drug was hailed, somewhat prematurely, as the penicillin of the
1990s.
Semantically, most of the modiﬁers are intensiﬁers (cf. 5.14). They express the
degree to which the meaning of the adjective or adverb applies on an assumed
scale. The most common intensiﬁer is very.
Adverbs are commonly used as adverbials in sentence structure:
Fortunately, American automobile manufacturers are now concentrating
on improvements in economy and safety.
Certainly we should be grateful for the ways in which he inadvertently
challenged our beliefs, deeply and seriously.
Some adverbials seem to be closely linked to the verb or perhaps the predicate, as
in She spoke vigorously or She spoke her mind vigorously, but it is difﬁcult to be
precise about the scope of such adverbials. For the range of meanings of adverbials,
see 3.14.
Many adverbs can function both as modiﬁers and as adverbials. The intensiﬁer
entirely is a modiﬁer of an adjective in [1] and an adverbial in [2]:
[1]
Michael’s amendment is entirely acceptable.
[2]
I entirely agree with you.
T H E  P R E P O S I T I O N A L  P H R A S E
4.25
The structure of the prepositional phrase
The prepositional phrase is a structure with two parts:
preposition
complement
The prepositional complement is typically a noun phrase, but it may also be a
nominal relative clause (cf. 6.9) or an -ing clause (cf. 6.8). Both the nominal relative
clause and the -ing clause have a range of functions similar to that of a noun
phrase.
1.
complement as noun phrase
through the window

The Structures of Phrases
71
2.
complement as nominal relative clause
from what I heard (‘from that which I heard’)
3.
complement as -ing clause
after speaking to you
As its name suggests, the preposition (‘preceding position’) normally comes before
the prepositional complement. There are several exceptions, however, where the
complement is moved and the preposition is left stranded by itself. The stranding
is obligatory when the complement is transformed into the subject of the sentence:
Your case will soon be attended to.
This ball is for you to play with.
The picture is worth looking at.
In questions and relative clauses the prepositional complement may be a pronoun
or adverb that is fronted. In that case, the preposition is normally stranded:
Who are you waiting for?
Where are you coming from?
I am the person (that) you are waiting for. [In relative clauses the pronoun
may be omitted.]
In formal style the preposition is fronted with its complement:
For whom are you waiting?
From where are you coming?
I am the person for whom you are waiting.
4.26
Functions of prepositional phrases
Prepositional phrases have three main functions:
1.
post-modiﬁer of a noun
I took several courses in history.
The local council is subsidizing the installation of energy-saving devices.
2.
post-modiﬁer of an adjective
We were not aware of his drinking problem.
I was happy with my marks last term.
3.
adverbial
After the storm, the sky brightened.
In my opinion, people behave differently in crowds.

72
An Introduction to English Grammar
Two or more prepositional phrases may appear independently side by side.
Here is a sentence with three prepositional phrases, each functioning as a separate
adverbial:
I read stories to the children (A) at home (A) in the evening (A).
One prepositional phrase may also be embedded within another, as in this prepo-
sitional phrase that post-modiﬁes the noun variations:
There were variations in the degree of bitterness of taste.
The embedding can be shown in this way:
prepositional phrase
in the degree of bitterness of taste
noun phrase
the degree of bitterness of taste
prepositional phrase
of bitterness of taste
noun phrase
bitterness of taste
prepositional phrase
of taste

Word Classes
5.1
Open and closed classes
Word classes such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., are traditionally called parts of
speech. There is not a ﬁxed number of word classes. We can set up as many classes
and subclasses as we need for our analysis. The more detailed our analysis, the
more classes and subclasses we need.
Word classes can be divided into open classes and closed classes. Open
classes are readily open to new words; closed classes are limited classes that rarely
admit new words. For example, it is easy to create new nouns, but not new
pronouns.
Listed below, with examples, are the classes that we will be examining in this
chapter. They will be further divided into subclasses.
Open classes
noun
Paul, paper, speech, play
adjective
young, cheerful, dark, round
main verb
talk, become, like, play
adverb
carefully, ﬁrmly, conﬁdentially
Closed classes
pronoun
she, somebody, one, who, that
determiner
a, the, that, each, some
auxiliary (verb)
can, may, will, have, be, do
conjunction
and, that, in order that, if, though
preposition
of, at, to, in spite of
There are also some more minor classes, such as the numerals (one, twenty-three,
ﬁrst) and the interjections (oh, ah, ouch). And there are some words that do not ﬁt
anywhere and should be treated individually, such as the negative not and the
inﬁnitive marker to (as in to say).
The conjunction in order that and the preposition in spite of are complex words
even though each is written as three separate words.

Word Classes
87
5.2
Word classes and word uses
In 5.1 some words are listed in more than one class. For instance, play is both a
noun and a verb; that is a pronoun, a determiner, and a conjunction. Many more
examples could be given of multiple membership of word classes. We can identify
the class of some words by their form, as we will see in later sections of this
chapter. But very often we can tell the class of a word only from its use in a con-
text. Reply is a noun in:
[1]
I expect a reply before the end of the month.
It is a verb in:
[2]
You should reply before the end of the month.
It is particularly easy to convert nouns to verbs and to convert verbs to nouns.
Reply in [1] and [2] represents two different words that share the same form.
They are two different words, though related in meaning; they are entered as
separate words in dictionaries (‘lexicons’).
If words happen to share the same form and are not related in meaning at all,
they are homonyms; examples are peer (‘person belonging to the same group in
age and status’) and peer (‘look searchingly’), or peep (‘make a feeble shrill sound’)
and peep (‘look cautiously’). We can make further distinctions if we wish to empha-
size identity in pronunciation or identity in spelling. If homonyms share the same
sound but perhaps differ in spelling, they are homophones; examples are weigh
and way or none and nun. On the other hand, if they share the same spelling but
perhaps differ in pronunciation, they are homographs; examples are row (‘line of
objects’) and row (‘quarrel’).
A word may have more than one grammatical form. The noun play has the
singular play and the plural plays; the verb play has the base form play and the past
played. It is common to use word for the grammatical form, so we can say that the
past of the word see is saw and we can also say that the word saw is spelled with
a ﬁnal w. Sometimes there is neutralization in form: rather than having the
distinctions found in most words, some words have only one neutral form. For
example, the verb cut represents at least three grammatical words:
present tense
I always cut my steak with this kind of knife.
past tense
I cut my ﬁnger earlier today.
past participle
I have cut my ﬁnger.
The examples of word classes in 5.1 are ‘lexical’ words (listed as main entries in
dictionaries), but they include any associated grammatical forms.
We recognize the class of a word by its use in context. Some words have sufﬁxes
(endings added to words to form new words) that help to signal the class they

88
An Introduction to English Grammar
belong to. These sufﬁxes are not necessarily sufﬁcient. For example, -ly is a typical
sufﬁx for adverbs (slowly, proudly), but we also ﬁnd this sufﬁx in adjectives:
cowardly, homely, manly. And we can sometimes convert words from one class to
another even though they have sufﬁxes that are typical of their original class: an
engineer, to engineer; a hopeful candidate, a hopeful.

5.3
Noun sufﬁxes
A noun is a word that can be the only or main word in a noun phrase (cf. 4.2). We
cannot identify all nouns merely by their form, but certain sufﬁxes can be added to
verbs or adjectives to make nouns. Here are a few typical noun sufﬁxes with words
that exemplify them:
-tion (and variants)
education, relation, invasion, revision
-er, -or
camper, speaker, actor, supervisor
-ism
optimism, socialism, terrorism
-ity
mentality, normality, reality, sanity
-ment
environment, equipment, government
-ness
happiness, compactness, darkness
Some sufﬁxes were part of the words when they were borrowed from other
languages: doctor, eternity, courage.
5.4
Noun classes
Nouns are common or proper. Proper nouns are the names of speciﬁc people,
places, or occasions, and they usually begin with a capital letter: Shakespeare,
Chicago, January, Christmas, Ramadan. Names may consist of more than one word:
The Hague, The New York Times, Heathrow Airport, Captain Andrews, Mount
Everest. Proper nouns are sometimes converted into common nouns: the Thompsons
I know; the proper noun Thompson cannot ordinarily be made plural, but here the
Thompsons means ‘the people in the family with the name Thompson’.
Common nouns are nouns that are not names, such as capital in:
The capital of the Netherlands is The Hague.
Common nouns can be subclassiﬁed in two ways:
1.
type of referent: concrete or abstract
2.
grammatical form: count or non-count

Word Classes
89
Concrete nouns refer to people, places, or things: girl, kitchen, car. Abstract
nouns refer to qualities, states, or actions: humour, belief, honesty. Some nouns may
be either concrete or abstract, depending on their meaning:
concrete
Thomas can kick a football 50 yards.
abstract
Thomas often plays football on Saturdays.
Count nouns refer to entities that are viewed as countable. Count nouns there-
fore have both a singular and a plural form and they can be accompanied by
determiners that refer to distinctions in number:
a
5
ten
5
one
6 student
many 6 students
every 7
those 7
Non-count nouns refer to entities that are viewed as an indivisible mass that
cannot be counted; for example, information, furniture, software. Non-count nouns
are treated as singular and can be accompanied only by determiners that do not
refer to distinctions in number:
much 5
your 6 information
that 7
There is a general tendency for abstract nouns to be non-count.
Determiners such as the and your can go with both count and non-count nouns.
Others can go only with singular count nouns (a) or only with plural count nouns
(those).
Some nouns may be either count or non-count, depending on their meaning:
There is not enough light in here.
(non-count)
We need another couple of lights.
(count)
Sandra does not have much difﬁculty with science.
(non-count)
Benjamin is having great difﬁculties with arithmetic.
(count)
Nouns that are ordinarily non-count can be converted into count nouns with two
types of special use:
1.
When the count noun refers to different kinds:
The shop has a large selection of cheeses.
2.
When the count noun refers to units that are obvious in the situation.
I’ll have two coffees, please. (‘two cups of coffee’)

90
An Introduction to English Grammar
5.5
Number
Count nouns make a distinction between singular and plural. The regular plural ends
in -s. This inﬂection (grammatical sufﬁx), however, is pronounced in one of three
ways, depending on the sound immediately before it. Contrast these three sets:
1.
buses, bushes, churches, pages, diseases, garages
2.
sums, machines, days, toes
3.
tanks, patients, shocks, notes
The plural inﬂection is pronounced as a separate syllable – spelled -es – when it
follows any of the sounds that appear in the singulars of the words listed in (1); in
the case of diseases and garages, a ﬁnal -e is already present in the singular, so only
an -s needs to be added in the plural. When -s is added to form the plurals toes in
(2) and notes in (3), the -es is not pronounced as a separate syllable. There are also
some other exceptions to the usual -s spelling. (See also A.4 in the Appendix.)
There are a few irregular plurals that reﬂect older English forms:
man – men
mouse – mice
woman – women
louse – lice
foot – feet
brother – brethren (in special senses)
goose – geese
child – children
tooth – teeth
ox – oxen
There are a large number of classes of other irregular plurals, many of them
having foreign plurals (e.g. stimulus – stimuli; curriculum – curricula; crisis – crises).
5.6
Gender
Relatively few nouns are distinguished in gender, but there are some male nouns
and female nouns; for example:
father – mother
widower – widow
boy – girl
bridegroom – bride
host – hostess
bull – cow
hero – heroine
lion – lioness
Important distinctions in gender, however, apply to the third-person singular
pronouns he, she, and it (cf. 5.18).
When he or she refers to a noun, the sex of the speciﬁc person or animal is made
manifest (but see 8.6):
The student was absent today because she attended an interview for a job.
5.7
Case
Nouns make a distinction in case: a distinction that is based on the grammatical
function of the noun. Nouns have two cases: the common case and the genitive

Word Classes
91
case. The common case is the one that is used ordinarily. The genitive case
generally indicates that the noun is dependent on the noun that follows it; this case
often corresponds to a structure with of:
Jane’s reactions – the reactions of Jane
For regular nouns the genitive is indicated in writing by an apostrophe plus s
(student’s) in the singular and by an apostrophe following the plural -s inﬂection in
the plural (students’):
singular
plural
common case
the student
the students
genitive case
the student’s essay
the students’ essays
In speech, three of these forms are pronounced identically.
Irregular nouns, however, distinguish all four forms in speech as well as in
writing:
singular
plural
common case
the child
the children
genitive case
the child’s toy
the children’s toys
The same genitive inﬂection (’s) is attached to both the singular and the plural.
On the rules for placing the apostrophe after words ending in -s, see 9.13.
5.8
Dependent and independent genitives
Genitives may be dependent or independent. The dependent genitive functions
like a possessive determiner (cf. 5.19). Compare:
the student’s essay (dependent genitive)
his essay
(possessive determiner)
The independent genitive is not dependent on a following noun. The noun may
be omitted because it can be understood from the context:
Your ideas are more acceptable than Sandra’s. (‘Sandra’s ideas’)
David’s comments are like Peter’s. (‘Peter’s comments’)
But the independent genitive is also used to refer to places:
The party is at Alan’s tonight.
She’s gone to the hairdresser’s.

92
An Introduction to English Grammar
Finally, the independent genitive may combine with the of-structure:
a friend of Martha’s
a suggestion of Norman’s
The independent genitive in the of-structure differs from the normal genitive in its
meaning: Martha’s friend means ‘the friend that Martha has’ (the speaker assumes
that the hearer knows the identity of the friend), whereas a friend of Martha’s
means ‘one of the friends that Martha has’.
M A I N  V E R B S
5.9
Verb sufﬁxes
A main verb (or, more simply, a verb) is a word that can be the main word in a
verb phrase and is often the only verb (cf. 4.11). Certain sufﬁxes are added to
nouns or adjectives to make main verbs. Here are a few common verb sufﬁxes with
words that exemplify them:
-ate, -iate
chlorinate, originate, differentiate
-en
darken, hasten, sadden
-ify, -fy
codify, falsify, beautify
-ise, -ize
apologise, publicise, rationalize
Like nouns, very many verbs have no sufﬁxes: write, walk, reveal, understand.
Many of the sufﬁxes that characterize verbs served that function in Latin or
French, and so we have words in English that were already sufﬁxed when they
were borrowed from these languages: signify, realize.
5.10
Regular and irregular verbs
I earlier (4.12) distinguished ﬁve forms of verbs. In all regular verbs (such as laugh)
and in many irregular verbs (such as hear) forms 4 and 5 below are identical. In one
set of irregular verbs (e.g. cut) forms 1, 4, and 5 are identical. The full set of ﬁve
forms appears in the irregular verb speak.
1.
base form:
laugh
hear
cut
speak
2.
-s form:
laughs

3.
-ing participle:
laughing
hearing

speaking
4.
past form:

5.
-ed participle:

spoken
The highly irregular verb be has eight forms (cf. 4.12).

Word Classes
93
5.11
Classes of irregular verbs
There are over 250 irregular verbs in English. Apart from the verb be, the -s form
and the -ing participle can be predicted for all verbs from the base form. We
therefore need list only three forms to show irregularities: the base, past, and -ed
participle. These three forms are known as the principal parts of the verb. If we
leave aside the verb be, we can group the irregular verbs into seven classes accord-
ing to whether or not three features apply to their principal parts: (a) the past and
-ed participles are identical; (b) the base vowel is the same in the other two
principal parts; (c) the past and -ed participle have inﬂectional endings. If an
irregular verb has inﬂectional endings, these may be irregular; for example, kept
from keep or spoken from speak.
Table 5.1 sets out in columns the three features and shows whether they apply
(‘+’) or not (‘−’) to each of the seven classes of irregular verbs. The ‘±’ for class II
indicates that some verbs in the class do not have the speciﬁed feature. The ‘1/2’ for
class IV indicates that the verbs have an inﬂectional ending in the participle
(spoken) but not in the past (spoke).
I give further examples of irregular verbs in each of the classes.
Class I
bend bent bent
earn earnt earnt
build built built
learn learnt learnt
have had had
smell smelt smelt
make made made
spoil spoilt spoilt
Those in the second column also have regular variants: earn, earned, earned.
Class II
mow mowed mown
shear sheared shorn
show showed shown
swell swelled swollen
The past is formed regularly, but the participle has an -n inﬂection. Those in the
second column have a different vowel in the participle, hence ‘±’ in the table. All
the verbs have regular variants for the participle: mow, mowed, mowed.

Those in the second column also have regular variants: dream, dreamed, dreamed.
Class IV
blow blew blown
see saw seen
break broke broken
take took taken
hide hid hidden
tear tore torn
lie lay lain
write wrote written
The participle has an inﬂection, but not the past, hence ‘1/2’ in Table 5.1. In some
verbs (e.g. blow) the participle has the same vowel as the base; in some (e.g. break)
the past and participle have the same vowel; in some (e.g. write) all the vowels are
different. The verb beat has the same vowel in all parts (beat, beat, beaten), but it
may be included in this class rather than in class II because it is not inﬂected in
the past.
Class V
burst
ﬁt
hit
rid
hurt
sweat
let
wet
All three principle parts are identical. Those in the second column also have
regular variants: ﬁt, ﬁtted, ﬁtted, as well as ﬁt, ﬁt, ﬁt.
Class VI
bleed bled bled
get got got
dig dug dug
hold held held
ﬁnd found found
strike struck struck
ﬁght fought fought
win won won
The past and participle are identical, but there is a change from the base vowel and
there are no inﬂections. A few verbs in this class have regular variants: light,
lighted, lighted, as well as light, lit, lit.
Class VII
begin began begun
come came come
sing sang sung
run ran run
Those in the second column have the same form for the base and the participle.
Some verbs also have variants in which the past and participle are identical: sing,
sung, sung, as well as sing, sang, sung.

Adjective sufﬁxes
An adjective is a word that can be the only or main word in an adjective phrase
(cf. 4.21). A large number of sufﬁxes are added to nouns and verbs to make
adjectives. Here are the most common sufﬁxes and words that exemplify them:
-able, -ible
disposable, suitable, fashionable, audible
-al, -ial
normal, cynical, racial, editorial
-ed
wooded, boarded, wretched, crooked
-ful
hopeful, playful, careful, forgetful
-ic
romantic, atmospheric, heroic, atomic
-ical
historical, political, paradoxical, economical
-ish
amateurish, darkish, foolish, childish
-ive, -ative
defective, communicative, attractive, afﬁrmative
-less
tactless, hopeless, harmless, restless
-ous, -eous, -ious
famous, virtuous, erroneous, spacious
-y
tasty, handy, wealthy, windy
The sufﬁx -ed is often used to form adjectives from noun phrases: blue-eyed,
long-haired, goodnatured, open-minded.
Like nouns and verbs, many adjectives have no sufﬁxes: sad, young, happy, true.
Some sufﬁxes were part of the words when they were borrowed into English:
sensitive, virtuous.
5.13
Adjective classes
We can divide adjectives into three classes according to their function. Used alone
or with one or more modiﬁers, an adjective can be:
1.
pre-modiﬁer of a noun
2.
subject complement
3.
object complement
Adjectives are attributive (attributing a quality to what is denoted by a noun)
when they are being used as pre-modiﬁers. They are predicative (part of the
predicate) when they are being used as complements.
Central adjectives can be used in all three functions:
1.
It was a comfortable ride.
attributive
2.
The ride was comfortable.
predicative
3.
I made the bed comfortable.
predicative
Other examples of central adjectives include: clever, brave, calm, hungry, noisy.

96
An Introduction to English Grammar
Some adjectives are attributive only:
That is utter nonsense.
You are the very person I was looking for.
Other examples include: chief, main, sheer. Many words are restricted in this way
only in particular meanings. Old is only attributive in:
She is an old friend of mine. (‘a friend for many years’)
It is a central adjective in:
She is an old woman.
She is old.
I consider her old.
Some adjectives are predicative only:
He is afraid of dogs.
I am glad that you are here.
Some predicative adjectives must be followed by a post-modiﬁer (cf. 4.21):
aware (of + noun phrase), loath (to + inﬁnitive), subject (to + noun phrase). Some
words have this restriction only with particular meanings. Happy is only predicat-
ive in:
We are happy to see you.
It is a central adjective in:
He has a happy disposition.
His disposition is happy.
We made him happy.
5.14
Gradability and comparison
Adjectives are typically gradable, that is, we can arrange them on a scale of
comparison. So we can say that something is a bit hot, somewhat hot, quite hot, very
hot, or extremely hot. We can also compare things and say that something is hotter
than something else or that it is the hottest of a number of things.
We use intensiﬁers to indicate the point on the scale. The most common
intensiﬁer of adjectives is the adverb very. Other examples of intensiﬁers, in
addition to those already given, include:

Word Classes
97
fairly warm
entirely different
pretty difﬁcult
incredibly dull
rather dark
too old
There are three degrees of comparison:
1.
higher
(a)
Ann is politer than Michael. (comparative)
(b)
Ann is the politest child in the family. (superlative)
We have a three-term contrast:
absolute
polite
comparative
politer, more polite
superlative
politest, most polite.
2.
same
Ann is as polite as Michael.
3.
lower
(a)
Ann is less polite than Michael.
(b)
Ann is the least polite child in the family.
The superlatives in (1b) and (3b) are required when the comparison involves more
than two units or sets of units.
Higher degrees of comparison are expressed either through the inﬂections -er
and -est or through the pre-modiﬁers more and most:
absolute
comparative
superlative
inﬂection
polite
politer
politest
pre-modiﬁer
polite
more polite
most polite
Some very common adjectives have irregular inﬂections:
absolute
comparative
superlative
good
better
best
bad
worse
worst
far
farther/further
farthest/furthest
Words of one syllable generally take inﬂections: older, oldest, purer, purest. Many
words of two syllables can usually take either form: politer, politest or more polite, most
polite, noisier, noisiest or more noisy, most noisy. Words with more than two syllables
take the pre-modiﬁers: more important, most important; more expensive, most expensive.

Adverb sufﬁxes
An adverb is a word that can be the only or main word in an adverb phrase (cf.
4.23). The sufﬁx -ly is commonly added to adjectives to make adverbs:
calmly, frankly, lightly, madly, quietly, tearfully
If the adjective ends in -ic, the sufﬁx is usually -ically:
economically, geographically, heroically, romantically
The exception is publicly.
The sufﬁx -wise is added to nouns to make adverbs:
clockwise, lengthwise, moneywise, weatherwise
Like the other word classes, many adverbs have no sufﬁxes. These include, in
particular, most time adverbs (now, today, yesterday, tomorrow), space adverbs
(here, there, outside, inside), and ‘linking adverbs’ (therefore, however).
5.16
Gradability and comparison
Like adjectives, adverbs are typically gradable and can therefore be modiﬁed by
intensiﬁers and take comparison (cf. 5.14): quite calmly, very calmly, less calmly,
most calmly. Most adverbs that take comparison require the pre-modiﬁers more and
most. Those adverbs that have the same form as adjectives have the inﬂections (e.g.
late – later – latest). The following adverbs have irregular inﬂections; the ﬁrst three
are identical with those for adjectives:
well
better
best
badly
worse
worst
far
farther/further
farthest/furthest

Pronoun classes
Pronouns are essentially special types of nouns and are the main word in a noun
phrase or (more usually) the only word in a noun phrase. They fall into a number
of classes, here listed with examples:

Word Classes
99
1.
personal pronouns
I, you, we, they
2.
possessive pronouns
my, mine, your, yours
3.
reﬂexive pronouns
myself, yourself
4.
demonstrative pronouns
this, these, that, those
5.
reciprocal pronouns
each other, one another
6.
interrogative pronouns
who, what, which
7.
relative pronouns
which, who, that
8.
indeﬁnite pronouns
some, none
The ﬁrst three classes are related in that they make distinctions in person (ﬁrst,
second, third), gender (masculine, feminine, and non-personal), and number
(singular and plural). Most of them also share at least some resemblance in their
sound and in their appearance (you, yours, yourself ).
Pronouns generally substitute for a noun phrase:
I went around the hospital with Dr Thomas. He was highly intelligent,
austere, and warm all at the same time. He could perceive almost instan-
taneously whether a problem was a serious one or not.
The two instances of He refer back to an antecedent (something that came
before), in this instance Dr Thomas. The pronouns are used to avoid repeating the
noun phrase Dr Thomas. One, however, replaces the noun head problem (and
therefore is literally a pronoun rather than a substitute for a noun phrase). Here is
another example of pronoun substitution:
A property development company has been found guilty of racial
discrimination because it attempted to prevent blacks from buying its
homes.
In this case the pronoun it replaces a noun phrase that is not identical with the
antecedent noun phrase A property development company. If we did not substitute
it, we would have to write the property development company (with the deﬁnite
article the) or (more economically) the company.
The pronoun occasionally comes before its antecedent:
When she moved into her own ﬂat, Helen seemed much more relaxed.
If we assume that the pronoun she and Helen refer to the same person, she and the
possessive determiner her (cf. 5.19) both refer forward to Helen.
Pronouns can also refer directly to something that is present in the situation:
Look at that!
I’ll pick it up.

An Introduction to English Grammar
5.18
Personal pronouns
All the personal pronouns have distinctions in person (ﬁrst, second, third). Most
also have distinctions in number (singular, plural) and in case (subjective, objec-
tive, genitive). For the genitive case of the personal pronouns, see the possessive
determiners (5.19).
subjective case
objective case
ﬁrst person
singular
I
me
plural
we
us
second person
singular/plural
you
you
third person
singular – masculine
he
him
– feminine
she
her
– non-personal
it
it
plural
they
them
The subjective case applies when the pronouns are the subject of a ﬁnite clause:
I know that she lives in Coventry and that he lives in Birmingham.
In all other instances except the one that I am about to mention, the objective case
is used:
She knows me well.
He has told her about me.
You must go with him.
The exception is that the subjective case is also used for the subject comple-
ment. In these examples the complement follows the linking verb be:
This is he.
It was I who issued the order.
In non-formal style, however, the objective case is common here too:
It’s him.
The masculine and feminine genders apply to human beings and also to other
beings that are treated as persons, such as pets or perhaps some farm animals. The

Word Classes
101
distinction between the two genders is made on the basis of natural distinctions in
sex. Some other objects (such as ships or cars) or even personiﬁed abstractions
(such as Death or Beauty) may be treated as if they were persons. Otherwise, the
non-personal pronoun it is used. One exceptional use of it is for babies whose sex
is unknown to the speaker.
The personal pronouns take modiﬁers to a limited extent:
you who know me
we in this country
you there
they both
5.19
Possessives
The possessive pronouns are the genitives of the personal pronouns. There are two
sets. One set contains the possessive determiners, a subclass of determiners (cf.
5.26f.). A possessive determiner is dependent on a noun:
Here is your book.
The other set of possessives contains the possessive pronouns, a subclass of pro-
nouns. A possessive pronoun functions independently:
This book is yours.
The possessive determiners are not pronouns, but it is convenient to deal with
them in this section because of the parallels between the two sets of possessives.
Nouns in the genitive case also have these two functions (cf. 5.7):
This is David’s book. (dependent genitive)
This book is David’s. (independent genitive)
But unlike the nouns, most of the possessives have separate forms for the depen-
dent and independent functions. The two sets of forms parallel the forms for the
personal pronouns (cf. 5.18).
Dependent

5.20
Reﬂexive pronouns
The reﬂexive pronouns parallel the personal and possessive pronouns in person
and number, but have no distinctions in case. There are separate forms for the
second person singular ( yourself ) and plural ( yourselves), whereas there is only one
form of the second person for the personal pronoun ( you) and the possessive
pronoun ( yours).
ﬁrst person
singular
myself
plural
ourselves
second person
singular
yourself
plural
yourselves
third person
singular – masculine
himself
– feminine
herself
– non-personal
itself
plural
themselves
The reﬂexive pronouns have two main uses:
1.
They refer to the same person or thing as the subject does:
They behaved themselves for a change.
You’ll hurt yourself.
2.
They give emphasis to a noun phrase:
She herself spoke to me.
He wrote to me himself.
I appealed to the captain himself.
5.21
Demonstrative pronouns
There are four demonstrative pronouns:
singular
this
that
plural
these
those

Word Classes
103
This is for you.
That doesn’t make sense.
These are tasty.
You may take those.
The demonstratives may also be determiners (cf. 5.26f ):
This letter is for you.
That sign doesn’t make sense.
These biscuits are tasty.
You may take those boxes.
5.22
Reciprocal pronouns
There are two reciprocal pronouns, and they have genitives:
each other
one another
each other’s
one another’s
The partners trusted each other completely.
My brother and I borrow one another’s clothes.
5.23
Interrogative pronouns
One set of the interrogative pronouns has distinctions in gender and case:
subjective case
objective case
genitive case
personal
who
whom
whose
It is normal to use who for both the subjective and objective cases, and to reserve
whom for formal style (cf. 8.18). The other interrogative pronouns, which and what,
have only one form. Which, what, and whose may also be determiners (cf. 5.26f.).
We use who and whom when we refer to persons:
Who is your favourite pop singer?
Who (or whom) have they appointed?
Whose is that towel?
Which can be either personal or non-personal:
Which is your sister?
Which (of the drinks) do you prefer?

104
An Introduction to English Grammar
What is normally only non-personal:
What do you want?
5.24
Relative pronouns
Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses (cf. 4.5). They also have distinctions
in gender and case:
subjective case
objective case
genitive case
personal
who
whom
whose
non-personal
which
which
whose
that
that
As with the interrogative pronouns (cf. 5.23), who is the normal form for the
subjective and objective cases, whereas whom is used only in formal style. The
relative pronoun that, which is gender-neutral, may be omitted in certain circum-
stances. The omitted pronoun is sometimes called the zero relative pronoun.
the teacher who (or that) taught me Chemistry
the house which (or that or zero) we bought
the person whom (or, less formally, who, that, or zero) they appointed
the student to whom you gave it (formal)
the student who (or that or zero) you gave it to
Genitive whose is a determiner, like his or her.
There is another set of relative pronouns that introduce nominal relative
clauses (cf. 6.9); these are the nominal relative pronouns. In addition to who,
whom, and which, they include whoever, whomever (in formal style), whichever,
what, and whatever.
You may take what/whatever/whichever you wish
What I need is a long holiday.
I’ll speak to whoever is in charge.
Nominal relative pronouns correspond to a combination of a relative pronoun
with a preceding antecedent (cf. 5.17):
What I need . . . (‘the thing that I need’)
. . . to whoever is in charge (‘to the person who is in charge’)
5.25
Indeﬁnite pronouns and numerals
Indeﬁnite pronouns are the largest group of pronouns. They refer to the presence
(or absence) of a quantity. Here are some examples of indeﬁnite pronouns:

Word Classes
105
Many have replied to the advertisement and several have been interviewed.
You take one and I’ll take the other.
No one was absent today.
More will be arriving later.
You can have both.
Either will do for me.
There are fewer here today.
Everybody was pleased with the speech.
The some-set of indeﬁnite pronouns contrasts with the any-set:
some
any
someone
anyone
somebody
anybody
something
anything
The any-set is normal in negative contexts. Contrast:
She has some close friends.
She doesn’t have any close friends.
Some implies a quantity, though the quantity is not speciﬁed. Any does not imply
a speciﬁc quantity; the quantity is without limit. The any-set is also normal in
questions unless a positive reply is expected:
Did anyone call for me?
Did someone call for me?
Two uses of indeﬁnite one deserve special mention:
1.
Generic one has the meaning ‘people in general’:
If one is concerned about the increasing deterioration of the environment,
one must be prepared to accept a lower standard of living.
2.
Substitute one is used as a substitute for a noun:
A:
Do you want an ice cream?
B:
I’ll have a small one.
Unlike most pronouns, one in the response by B substitutes for a noun, not a noun
phrase. It is the main word in the noun phrase a small one.
Many of the indeﬁnite pronouns may be post-modiﬁed. Of-phrases are particu-
larly common:

106
An Introduction to English Grammar
somebody else
neither of us
several in our group
none of the people
something quite funny
a few of my friends
Numerals may be used as pronouns. Here are two examples of cardinal nu-
merals as pronouns:
Twenty-two were rescued from the sinking ship.
Three of the children wandered off on their own.
The ordinal numerals ( ﬁrst, second, third, . . . ) combine with the in this function:
The ﬁrst of my children is still at school.

Classes of determiners
Determiners introduce noun phrases. The three classes of determiners are deﬁned
by the order in which they come:
1.
pre-determiners
2.
central determiners
3.
post-determiners
Here is an example with determiners from each class:
all (1) those (2) other (3) people
Many words may be either determiners or pronouns:
pronoun
Some have left.
determiner
Some people have left.
pronoun
I need more.
determiner
I need more money.
pronoun
All are forgiven.
determiner
All faults are forgiven.
pronouns
You may borrow this.
determiner
You may borrow this pencil.
5.27
Central determiners
The central determiners fall into several subclasses.

7.
indeﬁnites (cf. 5.25)

We cannot combine two or more central determiners to introduce the same noun
phrase.
5.28
The articles and reference
We can apply three sets of contrast in the reference of noun phrases:
1.
generic and non-generic
2.
speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc
3.
deﬁnite and non-deﬁnite
Generic/non-generic reference
Noun phrases are generic when they refer to a class as a whole:
Dogs make good pets.
They are non-generic when they refer to individual members of the class:
Bring in the dogs.
For generic reference, the distinction between singular and plural is neutralized,
and so is the distinction between the deﬁnite and indeﬁnite articles. In their
generic use, all of the following are roughly similar in meaning:
[1]
An American works hard.
[2]
Americans work hard.
[3]
The American works hard.
[4]
The Americans work hard.
Depending on the contrast, [3] and [4] can also be interpreted non-generically to
refer to individual Americans.

108
An Introduction to English Grammar
Speciﬁc/non-speciﬁc reference
Noun phrases are speciﬁc when they refer to some particular person, place, thing,
etc. In [5] an Australian refers to a speciﬁc person (even if unknown to the
speaker):
[5]
Patrick has married an Australian. (some Australian)
In [6], on the other hand, an Australian does not refer to a speciﬁc person:
[6]
Patrick would not dream of marrying an Australian. (any Australian)
Sentence [7] is ambiguous between the two interpretations:
[7]
Patrick intends to marry an Australian.
It may mean that Patrick has a speciﬁc person in mind (perhaps unknown to the
speaker), or that he has the ambition to marry someone from Australia though he
has nobody in mind at present.
As we will shortly see, both the indeﬁnite article a and the deﬁnite article the are
readily available for speciﬁc reference. For non-speciﬁc reference, indeﬁnite a is
usual but deﬁnite the also occurs:
[8]
Patrick intends to marry the ﬁrst Australian he meets.
Generic reference is always non-speciﬁc. Some non-generic reference may also
be non-speciﬁc, as in [6] and [8].
Deﬁnite/indeﬁnite reference
The deﬁnite article the is used to signal that a noun phrase is deﬁnite. Noun
phrases are deﬁnite when they are intended to convey enough information to
identify what they refer to. If they are not so intended, they are indeﬁnite. The
identiﬁcation may come from several sources:
1.
The phrase refers to something uniquely identiﬁable by the speaker and
hearer from their general knowledge or from their knowledge of the particular
situation:
the sun; the sea; the Church
The Prime Minister is speaking on the radio this evening.
I must feed the dog.
The door is locked.
The boss wants you.

Word Classes
109
2.
The phrase may refer to something mentioned previously:
Nancy introduced me to a young man and his wife at the reception. The
young man was her nephew.
At the ﬁrst mention of the young man, the sentence refers to him by the
indeﬁnite phrase a young man.
3.
The information may be identiﬁed by modiﬁers in the noun phrase:
I wonder whether you would mind getting for me the blue book on the
top shelf
Noun phrases may be deﬁnite even though they are not introduced by the
deﬁnite article. For example, in a particular situation, personal pronouns (I, you,
etc.) and names are uniquely identiﬁable and so are the demonstrative pronouns
(cf. 5.21). Other determiners, such as the demonstrative determiners (cf. 5.27),
may also signal that the noun phrase is deﬁnite.
5.29
Pre-determiners
There can also be pre-determiners before the central determiners. These include
the multipliers (double, twice, three times, . . . ) and the fractions (half, one-third, . . . ):
double her fee
half a loaf
They also include the words all, both, such, and what:
all the stations
both our children
such a joke
what a good idea
These can also occur without a central determiner:
all stations
both children
such jokes
Such is exceptional in that it can combine with other pre-determiners (all such
jokes) and can come after a central determiner (no such jokes) and even a post-
determiner (many such jokes).
5.30
Post-determiners
Post-determiners can come after the central determiners. They include the car-
dinal numerals and the ordinal numerals:

110
An Introduction to English Grammar
the three rooms
our ﬁrst apartment
They also include many, few, and little:
my many good friends
the few possessions that he owned
the little money that I have
The ordinal and cardinal numerals can co-occur:
the ﬁrst two weeks
The post-determiners can occur without other determiners:
He has few vices.
We saw two accidents on our way here.
A U X I L I A R I E S
5.31
Classes of auxiliaries
Auxiliaries come before the main verb in a verb phrase. The primary auxiliaries
are be, have, and do. They are different from each other and from the other
auxiliaries. Their uses are:
1.
be for (a)
the progressive: was playing (cf. 4.14)
(b)
the passive: was played (cf. 4.15)
2.
have for the perfect: has played (cf. 4.14)
3.
do as the dummy operator: did play (cf. 4.17)
The remaining auxiliaries are the modal auxiliaries or, more simply, the
modals. The central modals are:
present
can
may
will
shall
must
past
could
might
would
should
Like other verbs, most of the modals have a tense distinction between present and
past (the exception being must), but the past forms are often used for present or
future time:
We may/might come along after dinner.
I can/could help you later.

Word Classes
111
5.32
Meanings of the modals
The modals express two main types of meaning:
1.
human control over events, such as is involved in permission, intention,
ability, or obligation:
You may leave now. (‘I give you permission to . . .’)
I could speak Greek when I was young. (‘I knew how to . . .’)
You must go to bed at once. (‘I require you to . . .’)
2.
judgement whether an event was, is, or will be likely to happen:
They may be away for the weekend. (‘It is possible that they are . . .’)
That could be your mother. (‘It is possible that it is . . .’)
It must be past midnight. (‘It is certainly the case that it is . . .’)
5.33
Conjunctions
There are two classes of conjunctions:
1.
coordinating conjunctions, or coordinators
2.
subordinating conjunctions, or subordinators
The central coordinators are and, or, and but. They are used to link units of
equal status:
I enjoy novels and short stories best of all
I can and will speak!
The device seals a plastic shopping bag and equips it with a handle.
You may pay by cash or credit card.
He was apologetic but he refused to intervene.
The coordinators may be reinforced by correlative expressions: both . . . and;
either . . . or; not only . . . but also:
both Susan and her brother
either tea or coffee
Not only was the speech uninspiring, but it was also full of illogical
statements.
The marginal coordinator nor may be reinforced by the correlative neither:
I have neither seen the movie nor read the book.
Subordinators introduce subordinate clauses (cf. 6.9):

112
An Introduction to English Grammar
The negotiations succeeded because both sides bargained in good faith.
If you like the service, tell the manager.
Here are some common subordinators:
after
before
till
where
although
if
unless
while
as
since
until
because
that
when
Some subordinators consist of more than one word: except that and as long as, for
example.
Some words are both subordinators and prepositions. If the word introduces a
ﬁnite clause, it is a subordinator; if it introduces a phrase, it is a preposition:
subordinator
I saw her after I had my interview.
preposition
I saw her after the interview.
5.34
Prepositions
Prepositions introduce a prepositional phrase, and are followed by a prepositional
complement (cf. 4.25). The preposition links the complement to some other expres-
sion. If it links the complement to the rest of the sentence or clause, the prepositional
phrase may be placed in any of various positions:
We had an argument in the supermarket.
All the members of the team, in my view, contributed equally to the victory.
By that time I was feeling sleepy.
It may also link the complement to a phrase:
He became personal assistant to the managing director of the company.
The government suppressed all information about the epidemic.
Here are some common prepositions:
about
before
during
over

above

spite of, in addition to.

While ( ) he developed the theory of special relativity in ( ) about 1905, Albert
Einstein lived with ( ) a fellow student of physics who became his ﬁrst wife.
Some researchers believe that ( ) his wife Mileva should get at least some
of the credit for ( ) the theory, since ( ) there are letters from ( ) Einstein to
her that refer to ‘our work’ and ‘our theory’. Furthermore, a Russian physi-
cist who is now dead claimed to have seen both names on ( ) the original
manuscripts of four papers, but some scholars discount his evidence
because ( ) the original manuscripts have disappeared. Although ( ) Mileva
was certainly capable of understanding Einstein’s work and perhaps of
collaborating with ( ) him, the present evidence is too meagre to upset the
traditional view of Albert Einstein’s contribution to ( ) the theory of
special relativity, a view held since ( ) the publication of the theory.

At the end of each sentence you will ﬁnd a label for a word class. Underline all the
words in the sentence that belong to that word class.
1.
It is remarkably difﬁcult to deﬁne what literature is. – main verb
2.
Some deﬁnitions of literature say that it is language used for making ﬁction.
– noun
3.
Other deﬁnitions say that it is language used for the purpose of pleasing
aesthetically. – preposition
4.
However, some critics have shown convincingly that the two deﬁnitions are
necessarily connected. – adverbs
5.
Certainly, the ﬁction deﬁnition alone is not sufﬁcient, since some literature is
not ﬁction (e.g. biography) and some ﬁction is not literature (e.g. the story told
in an advertisement). – determiner
6.
Attempts to identify literary language through its abundance of rhetorical or
ﬁgurative devices have also failed. – adjective
7.
Some have argued that it is a mistake to set up a dichotomy between literary
and non-literary language, since literature is deﬁned simply by what we as
readers or literary critics regard as literature. – pronoun

Sentences and Clauses
6.1
Sentence types
In 2.4 I listed the four major types of sentences that are associated with four major
uses in communication:
1.
declaratives for statements
2.
interrogatives for questions
3.
imperatives for directives
4.
exclamatives for exclamations
Most of the sentences that we have looked at so far have been declaratives. In the
sections that follow we will examine the other three types of sentences.
6.2
Questions
There are two main types of interrogative sentences:
1. Yes–no questions begin with a verb. They require subject–operator inver-
sion; that is, a reversal of the order of subject and verb (the order that is normal in
declaratives). The verb that appears before the subject is an operator (cf. 3.3f):
Should (op) the government (S) cut income taxes?
Does (op) this shop (S) open 24 hours every day?
They are called yes–no questions because they expect the answer yes or no. They
may in fact be answered in other ways; for example, Certainly; Perhaps; I don’t
know; What do you think?
2. Wh-questions begin with an interrogative word or phrase:
Why should the government cut income taxes?
On which days does this shop open 24 hours?
They are called wh-questions because most of the interrogative words begin with wh-
(the exception is how). The interrogative phrases contain an interrogative word
such as which in On which days. The interrogative word in wh-questions represents
a missing piece of information that the speaker wants the hearer to supply.

122
An Introduction to English Grammar
Wh-questions generally require subject–operator inversion too. The exception
occurs when the interrogative word or phrase is the subject, and in that case the
normal subject–verb order applies:
Who has taken my car?
Which bus goes to Chicago?
There are also several other types of questions.
3. Declarative questions have the form of a declarative sentence but the force
of a question. They are signalled by a rising intonation in speech and by a question
mark in writing:
You know my name?
He’s got the key?
4. Alternative questions present two or more choices, and the hearer is
expected to reply with one of them. One type of alternative question resembles the
form of yes–no questions:
Should the government reduce its deﬁcit by raising income taxes or by
cutting expenditure?
The other type resembles wh-questions:
Which do you want, coffee or tea?
5. Tag questions are attached to sentences that are not interrogative. They
invite the hearer to respond in agreement with the speaker:
The government should cut income taxes, shouldn’t it?
You haven’t said anything yet, have you?
Tag questions have the form of yes–no questions. They consist of an operator and
a pronoun subject that echo the subject and operator of the sentence. The tag
question is usually negative if the sentence is positive, and positive if the sentence
is negative. Tag questions can be attached to imperative sentences; generally in
these the subject is you and the operator is will:
Don’t tell him, will you?
Make yourself at home, won’t you?
6. Rhetorical questions do not expect a reply since they are the equivalent of
forceful statements. If the rhetorical question is positive it has negative force, and

Sentences and Clauses
123
if it is negative it has positive force. The questions may resemble either yes–no
questions or wh-questions:
Is there anything more relaxing than a hot bath? (‘Surely there isn’t . . .’)
Haven’t you eyes? (‘Surely you have eyes.’)
Who could defend such a view? (‘Surely no one could . . .’)
6.3
Imperatives
Imperative sentences usually do not have a subject. If there is no auxiliary, the verb
has the base form:
Take a seat.
Pass me the bottle.
Make me an offer.
Modal auxiliaries do not occur with imperatives, and the only auxiliary that occurs
with any frequency is passive be (usually in the negative):
Don’t be carried away with the idea.
The pronoun you may be added as a second person subject:
You make me an offer.
Occasionally, a third person subject is used:
Somebody make me an offer.
Those in the front row sit down.
First and third person imperatives may be formed with let and a subject:
Let us go now.
Let’s not tell him.
Don’t let’s talk about it.
Let me think what I should do.
Let nobody move.
6.4
Exclamatives
Exclamatives begin with what or how. What introduces noun phrases; how is used
for all other purposes. The exclamative word or (more commonly) phrase is
fronted:

124
An Introduction to English Grammar
What a good show it was! (‘It was an extremely good show.’)
What a time we’ve had!
How hard she works!
How strange they look!
How time ﬂies! (‘Time ﬂies extremely fast’)
Exclamative sentences express strong feeling. More speciﬁcally, they indicate
the extent to which the speaker is impressed by something. What and how are
intensiﬁers expressing a high degree.
6.5
Speech acts
When we say or write something, we are performing an action. This action expressed
in words is a speech act. The intended effect in a speech act is the communicative
purpose of the speech act.
In Section 2.4 I referred to four major communicative uses associated with the
four major types of sentences. We have already seen (cf. 6.2) that a sentence type
may have a communicative use other than the one normally associated with it: a
declarative question is a declarative sentence with the force of a question; a rhetori-
cal question, on the other hand, is an interrogative sentence with the force of a
statement.
There are many more than four types of communicative purpose. Directly or
indirectly, we may convey our intention to promise, predict, warn, complain, offer,
advise, and so on. The communicative purpose of a speech act depends on the
particular context in which the act is performed. Here are some sentences, together
with plausible interpretations of their purpose if they are uttered as speech acts:
It’s getting late. (request for someone to leave with the speaker)
Tell me your phone number. (inquiry – request for information)
There is a prospect of heavy thunderstorms later in the day. (prediction)
I’m afraid that I’ve broken your vase. (apology)
Break it, and you’ll pay for it. (warning)
Do you want a seat? (offer)
I nominate Tony Palmer. (nomination)
Enjoy yourself. (wish)
Don’t touch. (prohibition)
I won’t be late. (promise)
It would be a good idea to send a copy to the manager. (advice)
The purpose may be merely to make a friendly gesture, where silence might be
interpreted as hostility or indifference:
It’s a nice day, isn’t it? (ostensibly information)
How are you? (ostensibly an inquiry)

Sentences and Clauses
125
6.6
Compound sentences
A multiple sentence is a sentence that contains one or more clauses (structures
that can be analysed in terms of sentence elements such as subject and predicate).
If the multiple sentence consists of two or more coordinated clauses, it is a com-
pound sentence. The coordinated clauses are normally linked by one of the
coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but):
[1]
She is a superb administrator, and everybody knows that.
[2]
Lawns are turning green, ﬂowers are blooming, and summer time is
returning.
[3]
Send it to me by post or bring it around yourself.
[4]
They have played badly every year since 1998, but this year may be different.
Compound sentences have two or more main clauses, each with independent
status. We cannot therefore speak of, say, the subject of the sentence. In [1] for
example, there is no subject of the sentence as a whole: the subject of the ﬁrst main
clause is she and the subject of the second main clause is everybody. In [2] there are
three subjects of main clauses: lawns, ﬂowers, and summer time.
Instead of linking main clauses with a coordinator, we can often juxtapose them
(place them side by side), and link them with a semicolon:
[1a]
She is a superb administrator; everybody knows that.
[4a]
They have played badly every year since 1998; this year may be different.
If we put a full stop between them, we have two orthographic sentences.
We sometimes avoid repeating identical expressions across coordinated clauses
by ellipsis (the omission of essential grammatical units that can be supplied by the
hearer from the context):
The adults ate chicken, the teenagers hamburgers, and the youngest chil-
dren pizza. (The verb ate is omitted in the second and third clauses.)
Last year we spent our holiday in Spain, the year before in Greece. (The
expression we spent our holiday is ellipted in the second clause.)
6.7
Complex sentences
A complex sentence is a multiple sentence in which one or more subordinate
clauses are embedded:
[1]
Everybody knows that she is a superb administrator.
[2]
He saw the trouble that idle gossip can cause.
[3]
I am glad that you are joining our company.

126
An Introduction to English Grammar
In [1] the clause functions as a sentence element: the direct object. In [2] it is
a modiﬁer in a phrase: the post-modiﬁer of the noun trouble. In [3] it is also a
modiﬁer in a phrase: the post-modiﬁer of the adjective glad.
Subordinate clauses are often introduced by a subordinator (or subordinating
conjunction, cf. 5.33), particularly if the clauses are ﬁnite.
A complex sentence can be analysed in terms of sentence elements such as
subject and verb. In [1] the subject is Everybody, the verb is knows, and the direct
object is the subordinate that-clause. In the subordinate clause, which is intro-
duced by the subordinator that, she is the subject, is is the verb, and a superb
administrator is the subject complement.
6.8
Non-ﬁnite and verbless clauses
Non-ﬁnite and verbless clauses are generally subordinate clauses. Non-ﬁnite
clauses have a non-ﬁnite verb (cf. 4.18); verbless clauses are without a verb.
There are three types of non-ﬁnite clauses, depending on the form of the ﬁrst
verb in the verb phrase:
1.
-ing clauses (or -ing participle clauses)
[1]
Just thinking about the ﬁnal round put him in a combative mood.
2.
-ed clauses (or -ed participle clauses)
[2]
Dressed in street clothes, the patients strolled in the garden.
3.
inﬁnitive clauses
(a)
with to
[3]
They wanted to pay for their meal.
(b)
without to
[4]
We helped unload the car.
Here are two examples of verbless clauses:
[5]
Though fearful of the road conditions, they decided to go by car.
[6]
Weary and almost out of money, we drove into a petrol station off the
motorway.
Non-ﬁnite and verbless clauses can be regarded as reduced clauses, reduced in
comparison with ﬁnite clauses. They often lack a subject, and verbless clauses also
lack a verb. However, we can analyse them in terms of sentence elements if we
reconstruct them as ﬁnite clauses, supplying the missing parts that we understand
from the rest of the sentence:
[2]
Dressed in street clothes, (V + A)
[2a]
They were dressed in street clothes. (S + V + A)

Sentences and Clauses
127
[4]
unload the car. (V + dO)
[4a]
We unloaded the car. (S + V + dO)
[5]
Fearful of the road conditions, (sC)
[5c]
They were fearful of the road conditions. (S + V + sC)
Non-ﬁnite and verbless clauses may have their own subject:
He began his speech nervously, his voice (S) trembling.
They trudged by the river in the deep snow, their heads and their hands (S)
bare.
If they do not have a subject, their subject is generally interpreted as being iden-
tical in its reference with that of the subject of the sentence or clause in which they
are embedded. This rule applies to sentences [2]–[6]. For [1] we deduce that the
reference of the subject of thinking is identical with that of the object him.
Non-ﬁnite and verbless clauses are sometimes introduced by subordinators. In
[5] the subordinator though introduces the verbless clause.
We have seen (3.7–12) that the choice of the verb determines the choice of other
sentence elements. For example, a transitive verb requires a direct object. The
verb also determines the form of the element, including whether it allows a clause
and what type of clause. For example, the transitive verb like may have as its direct
object a noun phrase, an inﬁnitive clause, or an -ing clause:
1 vanilla ice cream.
I like 2 to shop at Harrods.
3shopping at Harrods.
The transitive verb prefer, on the other hand, takes as a direct object a noun phrase,
an inﬁnitive clause, an -ing clause, or a that-clause:
1 vanilla ice cream.
4 to shop at Harrods.
I prefer 2 shopping at Harrods.
4
3 that we shop at Harrods.
6.9
Functions of subordinate clauses
Subordinate clauses have three main sets of functions:
1. Nominal clauses have a range of functions similar to that for noun phrases
(cf. 4.10). For example:
subject
Learning a foreign language is no easy task.
subject complement
The only problem in design is to relate
design to people’s needs.

128
An Introduction to English Grammar
direct object
I believe that a hot, humid summer has
beneﬁted the movie business.
prepositional complement
I listened to what the candidates had to say.
Nominal relative clauses are clauses that are introduced by a nominal relative
pronoun (cf. 5.24). Whereas relative clauses post-modify nouns, nominal relative
clauses have the same functions as noun phrases:
He gave his children what they wanted (dO).
Whoever said that (S) does not understand the question.
2. Modiﬁer clauses function as modiﬁers in phrases. One common kind of
modiﬁer is the relative clause (cf. 4.5), which post-modiﬁes a noun:
Drugs that are used in chemotherapy damage a patient’s healthy cells as well.
Non-ﬁnite clauses function as reduced relative clauses:
The ﬁremen battled an inferno fuelled by toxic chemicals. (‘that was fuelled
by . . .’)
Scientists found no evidence to suggest that neutrinos have mass. (‘that
would suggest that . . .’)
I was engaged in a programme of research involving many chemical reac-
tions. (‘that involved . . .’)
Another common kind of modiﬁer is the comparative clause, which is introduced
by than or as:
She is a better doctor than I am.
He spoke more rashly than he used to do.
Norman played as ﬁercely as I expected.
A third kind is a post-modiﬁer of an adjective:
Roger was afraid to tell his parents.
3. Adverbial clauses function as the adverbial element in sentence or clause
structure (cf. 3.9f ):
When a heart attack occurs, the electronic device automatically produces
charges of electricity that jolt the heart back into a normal rhythm.
Reﬂecting on the past three years, she wondered whether she could have
made better choices.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

Sentences and Clauses
129
6.10
Sentence complexity
The earlier division of multiple sentences into compound sentences and complex
sentences (cf. 6.6f ) is an oversimpliﬁcation. It indicates at the highest level within
the sentence a distinction between coordination and subordination of clauses. But
these two types of clause linkage may mingle at lower levels. A compound sentence
may have subordination within one of its main clauses. In this compound sentence,
the second main clause is complex:
[1]
Mite specialists have identiﬁed 30,000 species of mites, but they believe
that these represent only a tenth of the total number.
In [1], but introduces a main clause and that introduces a subordinate clause
within the main clause. The that-clause is subordinate to the but-clause and not
to the sentence as a whole: the but-clause is superordinate to the subordinate
that-clause.
A complex sentence may contain a hierarchy of subordination:
[2]
They refused (A) to say (B) what they would do (C) if the strikers did not
return to their jobs.
In [2] each of the subordinate clauses extends from the parenthesized letter that
marks it to the end of the sentence: (A) is a direct object that is subordinate to
the sentence as a whole and superordinate to (B); (B) is a direct object that is sub-
ordinate to (A) and superordinate to (C); (C) is an adverbial clause that is
subordinate to (B).
The next example is a complex sentence whose subordinate clauses are
coordinated:
[3]
They claimed that the streets are clean, the rubbish is regularly collected, and
the crime rate is low.
In [3] the three coordinated subordinate clauses together constitute the direct
object of the sentence.
In the ﬁnal example, the compound sentence has both subordination and co-
ordination at lower levels.
[4]
The Great Lake states warned pregnant women and nursing mothers to
avoid eating certain Great Lakes ﬁsh, and they advised the rest of us to
avoid certain large fatty species and to limit the consumption of other ﬁsh.
The two main clauses are linked by and. The ﬁrst main clause contains a non-
ﬁnite subordinate clause (beginning to avoid) in which is embedded another non-
ﬁnite subordinate clause (eating . . . ﬁsh). The second main clause contains two

130
An Introduction to English Grammar
coordinated non-ﬁnite subordinate clauses (to avoid . . . and to limit . . . ). The
relationship of coordination and subordination in [4] is represented in Figure 6.1.
6.11
There-structures
In the remaining sections of this chapter we will examine some common structures
that depart from the basic sentence patterns.
The ﬁrst is the there-structure. There is put in the subject position and the
subject is moved forward to a later position:
There is nobody outside. (cf. Nobody is outside.)
There are some topics that are best discussed in private. (cf. Some topics
are best discussed in private.)
There are several countries that have asked the Secretary-General for an
emergency session of the Security Council.
There is somebody knocking on the door.
The effect of this structure is to present the postponed subject and the rest of the
sentence as new information and thereby to give the sentence (in particular the
subject) greater prominence. The postponed subject is normally an indeﬁnite
pronoun (cf. 5.25) or a noun phrase with an indeﬁnite determiner (cf. 5.27).

6.12
Cleft sentences
In a cleft sentence the sentence is divided into two and one part is given greater
prominence:
It was Thomas Edison who (or that) invented the electric lamp.
(Compare: Thomas Edison invented the electric lamp.)
In a cleft sentence, the subject is it, the verb is a form of be, and the emphasized
part comes next. The rest of the sentence is usually introduced by that:
It was an American ﬂag that he was waving.
It was in 1939 that (or when) the Second World War started.
It was after I spent a summer working for a butcher that I decided to become
a vegetarian.
It was in Paris that Bob and Fiona fell in love.
Pseudo-cleft sentences have a similar purpose, but the emphasized part comes
at the end. The ﬁrst part is normally a nominal relative clause (cf. 6.9) introduced
by what. The verb be links the two parts of this SVC structure:
What I want is a good sleep.
What he did was open my letters.
What I’m going to do is see the principal.
6.13
Anticipatory it
It is unusual to have a nominal clause as the subject of the sentence:
[1]
That the season has started so early seems a pity.
Instead, the subject is usually moved to the end (the postponed subject) and its
position is taken by it (the anticipatory subject):
[1a]
It seems a pity that the season has started so early.
Here are some other examples:
It is likely that we’ll be moving to Glasgow.
It doesn’t matter to me who pays my ticket.
It’s impossible to say when they are arriving.
It has not been announced whether negotiations between the employers and
the employees have broken down.

132

position:
Having a good self-image keeps me sane.

7.1
The general rules
The verb agrees with its subject in number and person. The agreement applies
whenever the verb displays distinctions in person and number. For all verbs other
than be, the distinctions are found only in the present tense, where the third person
singular has the -s form and the third person plural – like the ﬁrst and second
persons – has the base form:
[1]
The noise distracts them.
[2]
The noises distract them.
The verb be makes further distinctions in the present and introduces distinc-
tions in the past. These are as follows:
present tense
singular
plural
1st person
am
2nd person
are
are
3rd person
is
past tense
singular
plural
1st person
was
2nd person
were
were
3rd person
was
The distinctions for third person agreement with be are illustrated in [3] and [4]
for the present and in [5] and [6] for the past:
[3]
The noise is distracting them.
[4]
The noises are distracting them.
[5]
The noise was distracting them.
[6]
The noises were distracting them.

142
An Introduction to English Grammar
The agreement affects the ﬁrst verb in the verb phrase, whether it is a main verb
as in [1]–[2] or an auxiliary as in [3]–[6]. Modal auxiliaries (cf. 5.31), however, do
not make distinctions in number or person:
The noise # may distract them.
The noises $
If the subject is a noun phrase, the main noun determines the number of the
phrase:
The noise of the ! demonstration # is distracting them.
@ demonstrators $
The noises of the ! demonstration # are distracting them.
@ demonstrators $
It is a mistake to allow the verb to be inﬂuenced by an adjacent noun that is not the
main noun.
Noun phrases coordinated with and are generally plural, even though the indi-
vidual noun phrases are singular:
The President and the Vice-President were at the ceremony.
Clauses are generally singular:
Playing handball relaxes me.
To make mistakes is only human.
That he needs a shave is obvious.
The rule of number agreement between subject (S) and verb applies to all ﬁnite
clauses, whether they are main clauses or subordinate clauses:
Inﬂation (S) is decreasing, and productivity (S) is rising.
Nature (S) has arranged that no two ﬂowers (S) are the same, even though
they (S) appear very similar.
7.2
And
The subject is plural if it consists of two or more phrases that are linked by and,
even if each is singular:
Your kitchen, your living-room, and your dining-room are too small.
The subject is also plural if and is implied though not actually present:

Usage Problems
143
Your kitchen, your living-room, your dining-room, are too small.
It is plural when one of the main nouns is implied though not actually present:
British and American English are dialects of one language. (British English
and American English are . . . )
Both the ﬁrst and the second prize were won by students at our school.
(Both the ﬁrst prize and the second prize were . . . )
On the other hand, if the linked units refer to the same thing, the subject is
singular:
The ﬁrst serious poem I read in grade school and one I later studied in
high school was ‘Ozymandias’ by Shelley. (The ﬁrst serious poem was
identical with the one later studied.)
A conscientious and honest politician has nothing to fear. (A politician
who is both conscientious and honest has . . . )
In some instances, two linked units may be viewed as either a combination (and
therefore singular) or as separate units (and therefore plural):
Bread and butter is good for you. (Bread with butter on it is . . . )
Bread and butter have recently gone up in price. (Both bread and butter
have . . . )
If the noun phrases are introduced by each or every, the subject is singular:
Every student and every instructor has to show an ID card to borrow
books from the library.
Each adult and each child was given a sandwich.
Every bank and store was closed that day.
See 7.4 for with and other linking expressions.
7.3
Or, nor
If the subject noun phrases are linked by or, either . . . or, or neither . . . nor, the
verb may be singular or plural. When both phrases are singular, the verb is
singular:
No food or drink was provided.
Either pollen or dust causes his allergy.
Neither the time nor the place was appropriate.

144
An Introduction to English Grammar
When both phrases are plural, the verb is plural:
Either the Unionists or the Nationalists have to make concessions.
When one phrase is singular and the other plural, usage guides prefer the verb to
agree in number with the phrase closest to it:
Three short essays or one long essay is required.
Neither your brother nor your sisters are responsible.
The plural is very often used in conversation regardless of which phrase precedes
the verb.
When the linked units are pronouns that require different verb forms, it is better
to avoid having to make a choice. Instead, rephrase the sentence:
Neither you nor I am responsible for the arrangements.
Neither of us is responsible for the arrangements.
7.4
With
When a singular noun phrase is linked to a following noun phrase by a preposition
such as with, the subject is singular even though the preposition is similar in
meaning to and:
His sister, together with her two youngest children, is staying with them.
The subject is singular because the main noun is singular. Other prepositions used
in a similar way include as well as and in addition to:
The teacher, as well as the students, was enjoying the picnic.
In the following sentence, the preposition is after:
One person after another has objected to the proposed reform.
7.5
Collective nouns
A collective noun refers to a group of people or things. Some common examples
are:
administration
enemy
herd
army
ﬁrm
jury
audience
family
mob
class
ﬂeet
nation

Usage Problems
145
committee
gang
public
crew
government
swarm
crowd
group
team
When members of the group are viewed as a unit, singular verbs and singular
pronouns are usual:
The audience was very noisy.
The public has a right to know.
The jury has retired for the night, but it will resume its deliberations
tomorrow.
The Olympic Committee has made its decision, and has awarded the 2008
Games to Beijing.
When the members of the group are viewed as individuals, plural verbs and plural
pronouns are used:
The government are confused about what to do next. (The members of
the government are . . . )
All the team are in their places. (All the members of the team are . . . )
7.6
Indeﬁnite pronouns
Most indeﬁnite pronouns (cf. 5.25) take singular verbs:
Everybody is now here.
Someone has borrowed my comb.
In formal writing, use singular verbs even when a plural phrase follows the
pronouns:
Either of them is prepared to help you.
Each of our friends has taken the course.
Several indeﬁnite pronouns (none, all, some, any) and the fractions may be either
singular or plural. If they refer to one thing, they take a singular verb:
Some (of the material) is not suitable for children.
Half (the county) is under water.
All (the fruit) has been eaten.
None (of the crop) was in danger.
If they refer to more than one person or thing, they take a plural verb:

146
An Introduction to English Grammar
Some (of the pages) are missing.
Half (of the members) have voted in favour of the amendment to the
constitution.
All (my friends) were abroad.
None (of us) have heard about the new regulation.
None is also used with a singular verb:
None (of us) has heard about the new regulation.
Problems sometimes arise in the choice of pronouns or determiners for which
singular indeﬁnite pronouns are the antecedent. The traditional choice for formal
writing is a masculine pronoun or determiner, according to what is required in the
context:
[1]
Everybody wanted a room of his own.
[2]
Does anyone think he can solve this problem?
It is also the traditional choice when noun phrases are introduced by indeﬁnite deter-
miners such as every or any (cf. 5.26) or when the phrases refer to a class of people:
[3]
Every student has handed in his work on time.
[4]
A good musician receives more invitations to perform than he can manage.
Changes in attitude have led many to avoid using the masculine to refer to both
male and female. It is generally possible to rephrase the sentence to avoid suggest-
ing a sexist bias. One way is to avoid using a pronoun or possessive determiner, as
in [1a]; another way is to make the subject plural, as in [2a]–[4a]:
[1a]
Everybody wanted a separate room.
[2a]
Do any of you think you can solve this problem?
[3a]
All students have handed in their work on time.
[4a]
Good musicians receive more invitations to perform than they can manage.
In recent usage, the plural pronouns their and they are increasingly being used,
especially in informal contexts:
Everybody wanted a room of their own.
Does anyone think they can solve this problem?
7.7
Quantity phrases
Plural phrases of quantity or extent take singular verbs when the quantity or extent
is viewed as a unit:

Usage Problems
147
Ten pounds is enough.
Two years seems too long to wait.
Five miles was as far as they would walk.
Otherwise, a plural is used:
Twenty years have passed since I last saw Helen.
Twenty-seven pounds were stolen from his wallet.
7.8
Singular nouns ending in -s
Nouns ending in -ics are singular when they refer to a ﬁeld of study, for example
economics, linguistics, mathematics, physics, statistics:
Statistics is one of the options in the degree course.
Economics was my favourite subject at school.
Some of these nouns are often used in a different sense and may then be plural:
Your statistics are inaccurate.
The acoustics in this hall have been improved.
Names of diseases that end in -s are generally treated as singular, for example
AIDS, measles, mumps:
AIDS is particularly prevalent in Africa.
Names of games that end in -s are singular, for example billiards, darts, draughts,
dominoes:
Dominoes is the only game I play at home.
Individual pieces have singular and plural forms:
You’ve dropped a domino on the ﬂoor.
The dominoes are on the ﬂoor.
7.9
Who, which, that
The relative pronouns who, which, and that have the same number as the nouns
they refer to.
The singular is correct in the following sentences:
I have written a letter for the student who is applying for a job in our
department. (The student is applying . . . )

148
An Introduction to English Grammar
You need special permission to borrow a book which is kept in the refer-
ence section. (The book is kept . . . )
They noted the tension that has begun to mount in the city. (The tension
has begun to mount . . . )
The plural is correct in the following sentences:
People who live in glasshouses shouldn’t throw stones. (The people live in
glasshouses.)
The weapons which were found during the search were produced as
evidence in court. (The weapons were found . . . )
She reported on the decisions that were made at the meeting. (The decisions
were made . . . )
The same rule of agreement applies when the relative pronoun refers to a
personal pronoun:
You who are my closest friends know best what needs to be done. (You
are my closest friends.)
It is I who am to blame. (I am to blame.)
It is he who is responsible for organizing the event. (He is responsible . . . )
In less formal contexts, constructions beginning It’s . . . will take objective forms
of the pronouns (cf. 7.13) and third person verb forms:
It’s me who’s/who was to blame.
It’s us who are/were to blame.
7.10
What
Either a singular verb or a plural verb may be used with the pronoun what. The
choice depends on the meaning:
What worries them is that he has not yet made up his mind. (The thing
that worries them is . . . )
They live in what are called ranch houses. (in houses that are called . . . )
Similarly, use either the singular or the plural with what-clauses, according to the
meaning:
What they need is a good rest. (The thing that they need is . . . )
What were once painful ordeals are now routine examinations. (Those
things . . . are now . . . )

Usage Problems
149
7.11
There is, there are
In speech it is common to use a singular verb after introductory there (cf. 6.11)
even when the subject (which follows the verb) is plural:
There’s two men waiting for you.
In formal writing, follow the general rule:
There is somebody waiting for you.
There are two men waiting for you.
7.12
Citations and titles
Citations and titles always take a singular verb, even though they consist of plural
phrases:
‘Children’ is an irregular plural.
Reservoir Dogs is a very violent ﬁlm.
Oscar and Lucinda was awarded the Booker Prize in 1988.
C A S E
7.13
Subject complement
When the subject complement is a pronoun, it is usually in the objective case: It’s
me, That’s him. Such sentences tend to occur in speech or written dialogue. Sub-
jective forms as in It is I and This is he are felt to be stilted, though they may be
used in formal contexts in constructions such as It is I who am to blame, It is he who
is responsible (cf. 7.9).
7.14
Coordinated phrases
In 5.18 I stated the rules for the selection of subjective and objective cases in
pronouns: we use the subjective case for the subject and (in formal style) for the
subject complement; otherwise we use the objective case. Errors of case may arise
when a pronoun is coordinated with a noun or another pronoun:
[1]
You and her will take charge. (Correct to You and she.)
[2]
I think Bob and me have the right approach. (Correct to Bob and I.)
[3]
Everybody knows Nancy and I. (Correct to Nancy and me.)
[4]
The tickets are for you and I. (Correct to you and me.)

150
An Introduction to English Grammar
The errors do not occur when there is only one pronoun. You can therefore test
which form is correct by using just the second pronoun:
[1a]
She will take charge. (She is subject.)
[2a]
I think I have the right approach. (I is subject of the subordinate clause.)
[3a]
Everybody knows me. (Me is direct object.)
[4a]
The tickets are for me. (Me is complement of the preposition for.)
There is a similar possibility of error when we or us is accompanied by a noun:
They complained about the way us students were behaving.
Correct to: we students. (cf. the way we were behaving.)
They will not succeed in pushing we Australians around.
Correct to: us Australians. (cf. pushing us around.)
7.15
After as and than
In formal writing, as and than are always conjunctions in comparisons. The case of
the pronoun depends on its function in the comparative clause, though the verb
may be absent:
[1]
They felt the same way as he. (He is subject.)
[2]
They paid him more than me. (Me is indirect object.)
[3]
He likes me more than her. (Her is direct object.)
You can test which form is correct by expanding the comparative clause:
[1a]
They felt the same way as he did.
[2a]
They paid him more than they paid me.
[3a]
He likes me more than he likes her.
In less formal contexts, the objective forms are normal even when the pronoun is
subject:
[1b]
They felt the same way as him.
7.16
After but
But meaning ‘except’ is a preposition. In formal writing, the pronoun following the
preposition but should be in the objective case:
I know everybody here but her.
Nobody but me can tell the difference.

Usage Problems
151
7.17
After let
Use the objective case after let:
Let us examine the problem carefully.
Let them make their own decisions.
A coordinated pronoun should be objective:
Let you and me take the matter in hand.
Let Bob and her say what they think.
7.18
Who, whom
Whom is not often used in everyday speech. In formal writing, however, the
distinction between subjective who and objective whom is retained:
She is somebody who knows her own mind. (cf. She knows her own
mind.)
She is somebody on whom I can rely. (cf. I can rely on her.)
Parenthetic clauses like I believe and I think should not affect the choice of case:
[1]
I recently spoke to somebody who I believe knows you well.
(cf. She knows you well, I believe.)
[2]
I recently spoke to somebody whom I believe you know well.
(cf. You know her well, I believe.)
The following example is different:
[3]
She is somebody whom I consider to be a good candidate for promotion.
(cf. I consider her to be a good candidate for promotion.)
I consider in [3] is not parenthetic. It cannot be omitted like I believe in [1] and [2].
Whom in [3] is the direct object of consider.
Similarly, the distinction between subjective whoever and whomever is retained
in formal writing:
Whoever wants to see me should make an appointment with my secretary.
(cf. She wants to see me.)
You can show the report to whoever wants to see it. (cf. She wants to see
it.)
I will offer advice to whomever I wish. (cf. I wish to offer advice to
her.)

152
An Introduction to English Grammar
7.19
Case with -ing clauses
An -ing participle clause may have a nominal function (i.e. a function similar to
one possible for a noun phrase). If the subject of the clause is a pronoun, a name,
or other short personal noun phrase, it is preferable to put it into the genitive
case:
They were surprised at Paul’s/his refusing to join the club.
He was afraid of my protesting against the new rule.
I dislike Robert’s seeing X-rated movies.
Do you know the reason for your sister’s breaking off the engagement?
Use the common case (that is, not the genitive case) for long noun phrases:
I remember a car with a broken rear window being parked alongside our
house.
They were annoyed at the students and staff demonstrating against cuts in
student loans.
The common case is also used for non-personal nouns:
I am interested in the car being sold as soon as possible.
Except in formal writing, the subject is often in the common case (for nouns) or
objective case (for pronouns):
They were surprised at Paul/him refusing to join the club.
In both formal and informal writng, the genitive case is used when the clause is the
subject:
My forgetting her name amused everybody.
Similarly, use the common case (for nouns) or objective case (for pronouns)
after verbs of perception, such as see, or certain other verbs, the most frequent of
which are ﬁnd, keep, and leave:
I kept Paul waiting.
We watched them leaving.

Problems with auxiliaries
When it follows a modal (cf. 5.31), the auxiliary have is often pronounced like of
and is therefore sometimes misspelled of. The correct spelling is have after the
modals in these sentences:
I should have said something about it long ago.
Somebody else would have paid.
You might have helped me.
She could have become the mayor.
The semi-modal had better is often rendered as ’d better or better in speech: He
better not be late. Use the full expression in formal writing: He had better not be late.
Ought to should be the ﬁrst verb in the verb phrase. Combinations such as didn’t
ought to and hadn’t ought to are non-standard.
7.21
Lie, lay
The intransitive verb lie (‘be in a reclining position’) and the transitive verb lay
(‘place’) are often confused, because the past tense of lie is lay and the present
tense of lay is lay or lays. Here are the forms of the two verbs:
present tense
lie, lies
lay, lays
-ing participle
lying
laying
past tense
lay
laid
-ed participle
lain
laid
Here are examples of sentences with these verbs:
lie
Is she lying on the sofa?
The children lay asleep on the ﬂoor.
I have lain in bed all morning.
lay
Are you laying a bet on the next race?
He laid his head on his arms.
The hens have laid a dozen eggs this morning.
7.22
Present tense
Standard written English requires the -s inﬂection for the third person singular
and no inﬂection elsewhere (cf. 7.1 for the verb be):

154
An Introduction to English Grammar
Johns says.
I say.
She knows.
We know.
The dog bites.
They bite.
It does.
You do.
Forms such as I says, you knows, and it do are frequently used in casual conversa-
tion, but they are non-standard forms and should therefore be avoided in writing.
Negative contractions sometimes cause difﬁculties. The standard contraction of
does not is doesn’t (she doesn’t), not don’t. Negative ain’t is commonly heard in
conversation as a contraction of various combinations, including am not, is not,
have not, and has not, but it is not a standard form.
7.23
Past and -ed participle
Regular verbs have the same form for the past and the -ed participle:
He laughed loudly.
He hasn’t laughed so much for a long time.
Some irregular verbs have different forms:
She spoke to me about it.
She has spoken to me about it.
Except in written representations of non-standard speech, do not write non-
standard forms for the past and -ed participle:
I done my assignment. (Correct to did.)
We seen the movie last week. (Correct to saw.)
He was shook up by the news. (Correct to shaken.)
Some verbs have variant forms that are acceptable for both past and -ed participle:
dreamed, dreamt; kneeled, knelt; lighted, lit; shined, shone. The past and -ed participle
of hang is generally hanged in the sense ‘suspend by the neck until dead’ (He was
hanged for murder) and is hung for all other meanings (The picture was hung on the
wall).
7.24
Past and past subjunctive
The past subjunctive is used to refer to situations that are very unlikely or that are
contrary to the facts (cf. 4.19):
I wish she were here.
He behaves as though he were your friend.

Usage Problems
155
Suppose she were here now.
If I were you, I wouldn’t tell him.
The only past subjunctive is were, which is used for the ﬁrst and third person
singular of the verb be in formal English. In less formal style the simple past was is
generally used in the same contexts:
I wish she was here.
If I was you, I wouldn’t tell him.
For the plural and the second person singular of be and for verbs other than be,
the simple past is used to refer to situations in the present or future that are very
unlikely or that are contrary to fact. One very common context is in conditional
clauses, that is, clauses that express a condition on which something else is
dependent:
If they were graduating next year, they would need to borrow less money.
(But they probably will not be graduating next year.)
If she lived at home, she would be happier. (But she does not live at
home.)
If you were an inch taller, you could be a basketball player. (But you’re not
likely to get taller.)
The verb in the main clause is always a past modal, usually would or could.
If the situations are set in the past, the past perfect is used in the conditional
clause and a past perfect modal, usually would have, in the main clause:
If we had been there yesterday, we would have seen them. (But we were not
there yesterday.)
If he had been given a good mark, he would have told me. (But it seems that
he was not given a good mark.)
If the auxiliary in the conditional clause is were, had, or should, we can omit if
and front the auxiliary:
Were she here now, there would be no problem.
Had we stayed at home, we would have met them.
Should you see him, give him my best wishes.
7.25
Multiple negation
Standard English generally allows only one negative in the same clause. Non-
standard English allows two or more negatives in the same clause:

156
An Introduction to English Grammar
double negation
They didn’t say nothing.
corrected
They said nothing.
They didn’t say anything.
triple negation
Nobody never believes nothing I say.
corrected
Nobody ever believes anything I say.
double negation
I didn’t like it, neither.
corrected
I didn’t like it, either.
Negative adverbs include not only the obvious negative never, but also barely,
hardly, scarcely:
double negation
I can’t hardly tell the difference.
corrected
I can hardly tell the difference.
Standard English allows double negation when the two negatives combine to
make a positive. When not modiﬁes an adjective or adverb with a negative preﬁx
(unhappy, indecisively), it reduces the negative force of the word, perhaps to ex-
press an understatement:
It was a not unhappy occasion. (‘a fairly happy occasion’)
She spoke not indecisively. (‘fairly decisively’)
Occasionally both the auxiliary and the main verb are negated:
We can’t not agree to their demands. (‘It’s not possible for us not to agree
to their demands.’)
Other negative combinations also occasionally occur:
Nobody has no complaints. (‘There is nobody that has no complaints’;
‘Everybody has some complaints.’)

Confusion between adjectives and adverbs
It is occasionally not obvious whether to use an adjective or a related adverb. One
rule is to use an adjective if the word is the subject complement after a linking verb
(cf. 3.8). The adjective characterizes the subject:

Usage Problems
157
She looked angry.
She feels bad.
I don’t feel well.
He sounded nervous.
The ﬂowers smell sweet.
The food tastes good.
The adverb badly is often used with the linking verb feel, but in formal writing use
feel bad. Well in I don’t feel well is an adjective meaning ‘in good health’. It is an
adverb in ‘He didn’t play well.’
If the word characterizes the manner of the action denoted by the verb, use an
adverb in formal writing:
She writes well. (Not: ‘She writes good’)
He hurt his neck badly. (Not: ‘He hurt his neck bad’)
Your dog is barking loudly. (Not: ‘Your dog is barking loud’)
If the job is done satisfactorily, I will give him other jobs (Not: ‘If the job
is done satisfactory . . .’)
Some words can have the same form for both the adjective and the adverb: early,
fast, hard, late, slow, quick, long, and words in -ly that are formed from nouns
denoting time (hourly, daily). The adverbs slow, quick, and deep also have parallel
adverb forms in -ly: slowly, quickly, and deeply. These three adverbs formed with-
out the -ly sufﬁx are mainly used with imperatives:
Drive slow.
Come quick.
Dig deep into your pocket for a donation.
Both direct and directly are adverbs in the senses ‘in a straight line’ or ‘without
anything intervening’:
We fax our orders direct to London for immediate despatch.
The Transcaucasian republics try to bypass Moscow by selling oil directly
to Ukrainian nationalists.
7.27
Comparison
Most adjectives and adverbs are gradable (cf. 5.14): we can view them as being on
a scale of less or more. Gradable words allow comparison (less foolish, more quickly)
and modiﬁcation by intensiﬁers that show how far they are along the scale (somewhat
foolish, very quickly). Some adjectives and adverbs are not gradable; for example,
we cannot say more medical or very previously.

158
An Introduction to English Grammar
Writers vary on whether certain adjectives or adverbs are gradable. Those who
treat them as non-gradable think that they express the highest degree (excellent) or
that they cannot be measured on a scale (uniquely). The most common of these
disputed words are complete(ly), perfect(ly), unique(ly). Yet even in formal writing
we ﬁnd expressions such as a more perfect union or the most extreme poverty. If you
are in doubt, it is better not to treat these words as gradable in formal writing.
Use the comparative for two only (the older of the two girls) and the superlative
for more than two (the oldest of the three girls). The comparative of the adjective bad
and the adverb badly is worse (not worser); the superlative is worst (not worsest).
Fewer goes with count nouns and less with non-count nouns (cf. 5.4):
1 demonstrators
1 danger
fewer 2 mistakes
less 2 money
3 votes
3 time
7.28
Only
Where you put only in a sentence may affect how the reader understands the
sentence. In speech you can make your intention clear through your intonation,
but when you write, it is best to put only next to the word or phrase it refers to:
Only children can swim in the lake before noon. (not adults)
Children can only swim in the lake before noon. (not ﬁsh)
Children can swim only in the lake before noon. (not in the pool)
Children can swim in the lake only before noon. (not in the afternoon)
The following words should also be positioned with care: also, even, just, merely.
7.29
Dangling modiﬁers
Absolute clauses are non-ﬁnite or verbless adverbial clauses that have their own
subjects:
All their money having been spent on repairs, they applied to the bank for a
loan.
He nervously began his speech, his voice trembling.
They strolled by the river, their heads bare.
If adverbial clauses have no subject of their own, their implied subject is generally
the same as the subject of the sentence:
Having spent all his money on a vacation to Hawaii, Norman applied to
the bank for a loan. (Norman has spent all his money on a vacation
to Hawaii.)

Usage Problems
159
A dangling modiﬁer has no subject of its own, and its implied subject cannot
be identiﬁed with the subject of the sentence though it can usually be identiﬁed
with some other phrase in the sentence:
dangling
Being blind, a dog guided her across the street.
corrected
Being blind, she was guided across the street by a dog.
dangling
Although large enough, they did not like the apartment.
corrected
Although the apartment was large enough, they did not like it.
dangling
After turning the radio off, the interior of the car became silent.
corrected
After she (or I, etc.) turned the radio off, the interior of the
car became silent.

salary for six months.
corrected
When you are absent through illness, the company pays you
your full salary for six months.

to do.

Since she was an excellent student, her teacher gave her
extra work to do.

An Introduction to English Grammar

Style
8.1
Style in writing
In normal unprepared conversation we have only a very limited time to monitor
what we say and the way we say it. We have much more time when we write, and
generally we have the opportunity to revise what we write. Sometimes we are
happy with our ﬁrst decision, but very often we think of new things as we write
and perhaps want to change both what we write and how we write it.
In our revisions we can draw on the resources that are available to us in various
aspects of the language. Our writing style reﬂects the choices we make. In this
chapter we will be looking at the choices we make in grammar. In particular, we
will be considering how we can ensure that we convey our message effectively.
E M P H A S I S
8.2
End-focus
It is normal to arrange the information in our message so that the most important
information comes at the end. We follow this principle of end-focus when we put
such information at the end of a sentence or clause. In contrast, the beginning of a
sentence or clause typically contains information that is general knowledge, or is
obvious from the context, or may be assumed as given because it has been men-
tioned earlier.
If we put a subordinate clause at the end of a sentence, it receives greater
emphasis. For example, [1] emphasizes the action of the committee members,
whereas [1a] emphasizes their feelings:
[1]
Although they were not completely happy with it, the committee members
adopted her wording of the resolution.
[1a]
The committee members adopted her wording of the resolution, although
they were not completely happy with it.
Similarly, the pairs that follow show how we can choose which information comes
at the end by the way we organize the sentence:

Style
169
[2]
The American public is not interested in appeasing terrorists.
[2a]
Appeasing terrorists does not interest the American public.
[3]
On guard stood a man with a gun in each hand.
[3a]
A man with a gun in each hand stood on guard.
[4]
Teenagers are difﬁcult to teach.
[4a]
It is difﬁcult to teach teenagers.
8.3
Front-focus
If we place an expression in an abnormal position, the effect is to make the
expression more conspicuous. It is abnormal for the verb and any objects or
complements to come before the subject. If these are fronted, they acquire greater
prominence:
Attitudes will not change overnight, but change they will.
Marijuana they used occasionally, but cocaine they never touched.
Most distressing of all is the plight of the refugees.
The same applies if an adverbial that normally follows the verb is fronted and
therefore comes before the subject:
Out you go.
Here they are.
Across the harbour stands a disused warehouse.
In goal is Seaman for England.
When a negative adverbial is fronted, it gains stronger emphasis. The operator
comes before the subject, as in questions:
Never have so many youngsters been unemployed.
Under no circumstances will they permit smoking in public areas.
8.4
There-structures and cleft sentences
There-structures give greater prominence to the subject (cf. 6.11):
There were some students who refused to show their ID card.
They are particularly useful when the only other elements are the subject and the
verb be:
There are no simple solutions.
There was no reason to be annoyed.
There is more than one way to reach your customers.

170
An Introduction to English Grammar
Cleft sentences (cf. 6.12) give greater prominence to one part of the sentence by
placing it after a semantically empty subject (it) and a semantically empty verb (be):
It was human error that caused the explosion.
It is the ending that is the weakest part of the novel.
Similar effects can be achieved by using a nominal relative clause (cf. 6.9) or a
general abstract noun:
What caused the explosion was human error.
The thing that caused the explosion was human error.
What he forgot to do was to lock the front door.
8.5
Parenthetic expressions
Parenthetic expressions are marked by intonation in speech and by punctuation
in writing. The effect of the interruption is to give greater prominence to the
previous unit:
Freud, of course, thought that he had discovered the underlying causes of
many mental illnesses.
The music business is not, in actual fact, an easy business to succeed in.
In Australia, for example, the kangaroo is a trafﬁc hazard.
The unions, understandably, wanted the wage increase to be adjusted to
rising inﬂation.
C L A R I T Y
8.6
End-weight
Where there is a choice, it is normal for a longer structure to come at the end of a
sentence or clause. This principle of end-weight is in large part a consequence of
the principle of end-focus (cf. 8.2), since the more important information tends to
be given in fuller detail.
A sentence is clumsy and more difﬁcult to understand when the subject is
considerably longer than the predicate. We can rephrase the sentence to shift the
weight to the end:

Misplaced expressions
We show where an expression belongs by where we place it. For example, [1] and
[1a] as written sentences are likely to be understood differently because of the
different positions of immediately afterwards:
[1]
Immediately afterwards I remembered having met her.
[1a]
I remembered having met her immediately afterwards.

172
An Introduction to English Grammar
A sentence is more difﬁcult to understand when an expression is misplaced, even if
there is no danger of misinterpretation. The [a] sentences in the pairs that follow
give a corrected placement:
[2]
He had not realized how slim she had become before he saw her.
[2a]
Before he saw her, he had not realized how slim she had become.
[3]
They knew what I meant quite well.
[3a]
They knew quite well what I meant.
[4]
She told him that it was all a joke in a calm voice.
[4a]
She told him in a calm voice that it was all a joke.
Sometimes a sentence has more than one interpretation because an expression
is positioned where it might belong in either of two directions. In [5] on several
occasions may go with He said or with he suffered from headaches:
[5]
He said on several occasions he suffered from headaches.
One way of showing it belongs with He said is to insert the conjunction that after
it, since on several occasions will then be outside the boundaries of the subordinate
clause:
[5a]
He said on several occasions that he suffered from headaches.
The second interpretation is elicited in [5b]:
[5b]
He said that he suffered on several occasions from headaches.
For [6], we can ensure the correct interpretation by moving again to unambiguous
positions, as in [6a] and [6b]:
[6]
I told them again the meeting had been postponed.
[6a]
I again told them the meeting had been postponed.
[6b]
I told them the meeting had again been postponed.
For [7], it would be best to rephrase the sentence as [7a] or [7b]:
[7]
Writing clearly is important.
[7a]
It is important to write clearly.
[7b]
It is clear that writing is important.
Similarly, [8a] and [8b] clarify the intended meaning of the writer of [8]:

Style
173
[8]
Looking at the ages of the subjects ﬁrst proved not to be very useful.
[8a]
It proved not to be very useful to look ﬁrst at the ages of the subjects.
[8b]
At ﬁrst it proved not to be very useful to look at the ages of the subjects.
8.8
Abstract nouns
It is often possible to make a sentence clearer by rephrasing it to replace abstract
nouns (or at least some of them) with verbs or adjectives:
clumsy
Since the decriminalization of public drunkenness, people
have been avoiding Broadway Park, where drunks have been
congregating.

improved

General abstract nouns are often redundant. In such cases you can easily leave
them out by rephrasing the sentence:
redundant

method, other techniques would have to be employed.
improved

Some longwinded phrases with general words such as fact are better replaced by
simpler conjunctions or prepositions:

174
An Introduction to English Grammar
longwinded
I went to see Saving Private Ryan in spite of the fact that I
dislike war ﬁlms.
improved
I went to see Saving Private Ryan even though I dislike war
ﬁlms.
Other examples are on account of the fact that and due to the fact that (both of which
can be replaced by ‘because’), apart from the fact that (‘except that’), as a conse-
quence of (‘because of ’), during the course of (‘during’), in the neighbourhood of
(‘near’), with the exception of (‘except’).
8.9
Modiﬁers in noun phrases
Readers may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to work out the meaning of a noun phrase that has two
or more modiﬁers. If we are writing about American history, it may be obvious
what we mean by American history teachers. But if the context fails to make the
meaning unambiguous, we should use prepositions to show the relationships:
teachers of American history or American teachers of history.
Even if there is no ambiguity, a long noun phrase such as prison reform lobby
group recommendations is better written with prepositions that indicate the words
that belong together: recommendations by the lobby group for prison reform.
8.10
Subordination
It is sometimes better to split up a long complex sentence:
[1]
Because many minor revisions were still required in the second draft of
the document, contact with individual committee members was made by
phone or letter, as the committee had been dissolved by the board and was
soon to be replaced by an entirely new committee made up of members
from a different department within the university.
One way of improving the readability of [1] is to divide it into two or more
sentences, since one of the problems with [1] is that it contains two clauses
(introduced by because and as) that separately give reasons for contacting commit-
tee members:
[1a]
Many minor revisions were still required in the second draft of the docu-
ment. Committee members were individually contacted by phone or letter
for their views on the draft, since the committee had been dissolved by
the board. An entirely new committee was soon to be formed consisting of
members from a different department within the university.
In [2] the problem is the string of that-clauses:

Style
175
[2]
She rehearsed the speech that she was to give to the committee that
distributed funds that had been allocated for training the unemployed.
We can replace the last two that-clauses by converting them into non-ﬁnite clauses,
as in [2a]:
[2a]
She rehearsed the speech that she was to give to the committee distributing
funds allocated for training the unemployed.
8.11
Parallelism
Parallel structures provide a pleasing balance between the parallel units, and they
emphasize meaning relationships between the units such as equivalence and con-
trast. Parallelism often involves coordination. However, the coordinated units must
be similar in type. Here is an example of faulty parallelism, where the coordinated
units are dissimilar:
faulty
They discontinued the production of the paint because the
results of the ﬁeld tests were unsatisfactory and a lack of inter-
ested customers. (clause and noun phrase)
corrected
They discontinued the production of the paint because the
results of the ﬁeld tests were unsatisfactory and there was a lack
of interested customers.
or

unsatisfactory results of the ﬁeld tests and a lack of interested

faulty

tuition. (prepositional phrase and inﬁnitive clause)
corrected

The relative pronoun that is generally an alternative to which or who. It is a fault
to switch from that to which or who, or vice versa. The fault is illustrated in the
following sentence; it can be corrected by using either which or that in both
instances.
Scientists are still trying to explain the UFO which was seen over Siberia
in 1908 by thousands of witnesses and that caused an explosion like that
of an H-bomb.
In a series of three or more coordinated units, we can often choose whether to
repeat words from the ﬁrst unit or to leave them out. But we should be consistent:
faulty
The colour of her hair, look of self-assurance, and the aristo-
cratic bearing match those in the painting of the beautiful

176

faulty

we go our separate ways.
corrected

Similarly, expressions that compare or contrast must also introduce parallel units:
faulty

corrected

or

faulty

in ofﬁces is measurably less than non-smokers in smoke-free

Both correlatives must be present in comparative structures of the type The
more, the merrier:

Repeated sounds
Avoid putting words near each other if they sound the same or almost the same but
have different meanings. The lack of harmony between sound and sense may be
distracting and sometimes even confusing. I suggest some alternatives in parentheses:

point out by mention.)

(Replace showed by demonstrated.)
8.13
Pronoun reference
A pronoun may refer to something in the situation (this in Give this to your mother),
but generally it refers back to another word or phrase – its antecedent (cf. 5.17).
The reference to an antecedent should be clear:
unclear
The students were employed during the vacation by people
who were fussy about their work.
clariﬁed
The students were employed during the vacation by people
who were fussy about the students’ work.
or
The students were employed during the vacation by people
who were fussy about their own work.
You need to be particularly careful when you intend the pronoun to refer to
more than a phrase:
unclear
Some people believe that a person is successful only when he
acquires enormous wealth and they cannot be persuaded other-
wise. But that is not always true.
clariﬁed
Some people believe that a person is successful only when he
acquires enormous wealth and they cannot be persuaded other-
wise. But wealth is not always a true measure of success.
Do not use a pronoun to refer vaguely to an antecedent that is implied but is not
actually present. Replace the pronoun with a suitable noun phrase:
vague
The airlines and the airports are unable to cope with the new
security measures. Delays and frustration affect travellers daily.
No one saw it coming.
clariﬁed
The airlines and the airports are unable to cope with the new
security measures. Delays and frustration affect travellers daily.
No one anticipated the problem.
You can sometimes improve a sentence by rephrasing it to omit a pronoun:

same persons:

corrected

Punctuation

Punctuation
9.1
Punctuation rules
The rules for punctuation are conventions that have been developed by printers and
publishers. In large part, punctuation helps the readers to understand the written
communication by breaking it down into smaller components. The conventions
also contribute to the appearance of the printed page, notably through paragraphing.
The conventions establish a measure of consistency for writers. Some conventions
are obligatory: if we break them, we have made mistakes in punctuation. Others
are optional: we can make better or worse choices in particular circumstances,
depending on the effects we wish to convey. To that extent, punctuation is an art.
Some punctuation marks are intended to represent pauses that we should make
in our reading. In [1] below, the author has chosen to enclose three words in
brackets to indicate that they are to be read with pauses on either side. The effect
of the separating pauses is rhetorical: they emphasize the addition of or may not:
[1]
He may (or may not) vote for Mr Portillo as party leader.
But we do not always insert punctuation marks where we pause in speech. We
would be likely to read or speak the sentence in [2] with a pause (or a break in our
intonation) after the word development (and perhaps other pauses too):
[2]
A contemporary philosopher invited to consider relevant difﬁculties raised
by modern urban development might think to approach the issues from
the direction of either of the now well-established traditions of social
philosophy or aesthetics.
The punctuation system, however, does not allow a comma after development.
There is a punctuation rule that forbids a comma between the subject and predi-
cate unless the comma is the ﬁrst of a pair of commas, as in [3]. Here parenthetic
such as thistles and docks is separated by a pair of commas:
[3]
Some perennials, such as thistles and docks, were killed by ploughing and
harrowing during the fallow summer period.

184
An Introduction to English Grammar
The rule forbidding a comma after development in [2] depends on the grammar
of the sentence: the analysis of the sentence into subject and predicate. Some
punctuation rules involve grammar and others involve meaning. We will be looking
at such rules in the sections that follow.
9.2
Sentence fragments and fragmentary sentences
A sentence fragment is a set of words that is punctuated as a sentence even
though it is not grammatically an independent sentence. Experienced writers can
set a tone in their writing that allows them to violate the rules of punctuation
through their intentional use of sentence fragments. When inexperienced writers
violate these rules, their readers are given the impression that the writers do not
know the rules. On the whole, it is safer for writers to avoid using fragments in
formal writing until they are experienced enough to sense when it is appropriate to
use them. Below are three types of sentence fragments to avoid. In each instance, if
we replace the full stop, we also need to change the following capital to lower case.
1.
subordinate clauses
The most vulnerable items are the keyboard, ﬂoppy disks, and printers. Because
these are the items that people handle. [Replace the full stop with a comma.]
The percentage or letter-marking system is better than the pass/fail system.
Because marks motivate students to work harder. [Omit the full stop or
replace it with a comma.]
I woke up late the next morning. My head throbbing and my stomach burn-
ing. [Replace the full stop by a comma or a dash.]
2.
loosely joined phrases
The kit comes complete with an instruction leaﬂet. All for £18.50. [Replace
the full stop with a comma or a dash.]
He found her rather uninteresting. Especially by comparison with Helen.
[Replace the full stop with a comma or a dash.]
Some parents are making an effort to deal with the problem of teenage drinking.
An effort that can help reduce alcoholism and road accidents. [Replace the full
stop with a comma.]
3.
coordinated expressions
Some of his students became interested in environmental problems. And later
helped in the battle against environmental pollution. [Replace the full stop
with a comma.]
They have abandoned their homes. And taken all their possessions with them.
[Delete the full stop or replace it with a comma.]
He gossiped about other people’s relationships. And even his own. [Replace
the full stop with a comma or a dash.]

Punctuation
185
Sentence fragments are occasionally used in print, particularly in advertising, to
suggest an afterthought or a dramatic pause, as in this extract from an advertise-
ment for Intercity trains:
Suddenly, a brilliant thought might strike. An idea for a game that could
be bigger than Trivial Pursuit.
Fragmentary sentences are sentences that are grammatically incomplete but
can be completed from the verbal context (cf. 2.2). In written dialogue they are
particularly common for responses, and their use in such contexts is perfectly
appropriate:
A:
What did she tell you?
B:
To help myself to food. (‘She told me to help myself to food.’)
A:
I heard you passed your driving test.
B:
After failing three times. (‘I passed it after failing three times.’)
Fragmentary sentences are also common and appropriate in ﬁctional description
and narration:
We’ve made a pact. A new start. No more philandering.
[Paul Sayer, Howling at the Moon, p. 142. London: Constable, 1990]
In the next example (also from a novel), all the sentences except the ﬁrst are
fragmentary. The ﬁrst sentence (ending in a semicolon) provides the clue to their
interpretation. For most of them we would supply an initial She was, She had, or
She had a to make them grammatically complete:
Dr von HaIler looked younger than I; about thirty-eight, I judged, for
though her expression was youthful there was a little gray in her hair.
Fine face; rather big features but not coarse. Excellent nose, aquiline if
one wished to be complimentary but verging on the hooky if not. Large
mouth and nice teeth, white but not American-white. Beautiful eyes,
brown to go with her hair. Pleasant low voice and a not quite perfect
command of colloquial English. Slight acccent. Clothes unremarkable,
neither fashionable nor dowdy, in the manner Caroline calls ‘classic’.
Altogether a person to inspire conﬁdence. [Robertson Davies, The Deptford
Trilogy, p. 282. Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1977]
Fragments are commonly used in email messages, and in personal letters. The
following extract is from a personal letter written while travelling on London
Underground. The sentence fragments are in italics.

186
An Introduction to English Grammar
Goodge St. Station. Last singing lesson this term with Christopher Littlewood.
Fantastic man, fantastic lessons, so clever. Don’t know what I’m going to do
now, his private waiting list is depressingly long. So I’ll just have to wait
I guess. How are you today I wonder? Shit – Train resembles sardine can.
But by some miracle I get a seat.
[ICE-GB-W1B-003-59ff ]
As well as fragments, there is ellipsis (cf. 6.6) of determiners:
(The) train resembles (a) sardine can.
9.3
Run-on sentences and comma splices
In [1] we have two separate sentences:
[1]
I used to be afraid of him. I have since got to know him well.
We can join them into one sentence by simply putting a semicolon between them:
[1a]
I used to be afraid of him; I have since got to know him well.
The general rule is that if we juxtapose sentences, as in [1] and [1a] , we must
use a major punctuation mark. The major punctuation marks are full stops (periods),
question marks, exclamation marks, colons, semicolons, and dashes. If we fail to
use any mark at all the resulting error is a run-on sentence, as in [1b]:
[1b]
I used to be afraid of him I have since got to know him well. [Correct by
inserting a major punctuation mark after afraid of him.]
Here are further examples of run-on sentences:
It did not matter to me whether or not I had made an impact on the world
I just wanted to learn as much as possible. [Insert a major punctuation
mark after the world.]
Ask the ﬁrst person you see if they will help you I am sure they will.
[Insert a major punctuation mark after help you.]
If we use a comma instead of a major punctuation mark, the resulting error is a
comma splice, as in [1c]:
[1c]
I used to be afraid of him, I have since got to know him well. [Replace the
comma with a major punctuation mark.]

Punctuation
187
The personal letter that we looked at in Section 9.2 also contains a comma splice:
Don’t know what I’m going to do now, his private waiting list is depress-
ingly long. [Replace the comma with a major punctuation mark.]
Here are further examples of comma splices:
I visited them in their new home, it was a large apartment with a living
room, kitchen, dining alcove, and two bedrooms. [Replace the comma
after home with a major punctuation mark.]
I drifted towards vegetarianism, it was only partly for moral reasons.
[Replace the comma after vegetarianism with a major punctuation mark.]
Comma splices are most likely to occur when a linking adverb (e.g. therefore,
nevertheless) or a linking prepositional phrase (e.g. in spite of that, as a result) comes
between the two sentences. A semicolon is the normal major punctuation mark if
the two sentences are combined:
[2]
They lost the battle, nevertheless they were determined to continue the
war. [Correct by replacing the comma with a major punctuation mark.]
[3]
The supply of houses grew more slowly than the number of new house-
holds, as a result there was a giddy rise in prices. [Correct by replacing the
comma with a major punctuation mark.]
These linking expressions do not have to come between the two sentences. They
can be moved elsewhere in the second sentence, as in [2a] and [2b]:
[2a]
They lost the battle; they were determined, nevertheless, to continue the
war.
[2b]
They lost the battle; they were determined to continue the war nevertheless.
There is one exception to the general rule. We may use commas between
juxtaposed sentences if they are short and are similar in their structure, as in [4]:
[4]
The ﬁrst problem is ﬁnding out what is important in life, the second
problem is knowing how to apply this information in practice.
The sentence may consist of just two parallel clauses involving a kind of com-
parison, as in [5] and [6]:
[5]
The sooner he ﬁnishes, the better he will feel.
[6]
The more they earned, the more they wanted.

9.4
Coordinated main clauses
Instead of juxtaposing sentences, we can often link them with a coordinator as two
main clauses within one sentence. When we use a coordinator, we can put merely
a comma between the clauses. In [1d] below, the coordinator but follows a comma:
[1d]
I used to be afraid of him, but I have since got to know him well.
The central coordinators are and, or, and but. The marginal coordinators, which
resemble the central coordinators in that they must come between the clauses, can
also be used merely with a preceding comma: these are for, nor, so (‘therefore’),
then (‘after that’), and yet. Here are examples with the three central coordinators
and the other linking words:
They were highly successful in the competition for grant support, and
each grant provided jobs for technicians and other workers.
He ought to admit that he is responsible for what he is doing, or he ought
not to do it at all.
The legal profession does not seem to have changed much, but in fact it
has become much more democratic.
Peace is by no means assured, for several cabinet ministers are opposed to
key paragraphs in the draft treaty.
He is not a furniture designer, nor is he a shopkeeper.
A storm damaged their radio, yet they were able to send messages.
She was refused admission, so she complained to the manager.
Check that the light is on, then push the knob inwards and turn to the
setting that you require for cooking.
The central coordinators may also link clauses without a punctuation mark,
particularly if one or more of the clauses is short:
We’ve all been asked to take more personal responsibility and people have
responded to that challenge.
We may want to use major punctuation marks between coordinated main clauses
because they are long, because we want to emphasize that each clause is a separate
unit, or because one or more of the clauses has internal commas:
The kids are bored with tv; and they’re bored with ﬁlms; and they’re
bored with video games; and they’re bored with computers.

Punctuation
189
She thinks that the data on which the current view is based are biased by
the fact that many of the measurements were made near urban areas,
which tend to be warmer. But the measurements at sea are unreliable too,
especially the older ones.
On the other hand, we should not use a full stop or a semicolon to separate a
subordinate clause from the main clause. Using a full stop results in a sentence
fragment (cf. 9.2), and a similar mistake results from using a semicolon:
He told the police that she has moved; although in fact she had died.
[Replace the semicolon with a comma.]
9.5
Direct speech
We use direct speech when we report the actual words that somebody has said or
written. It is normal to enclose direct speech in two pairs of either single or double
quotation marks, an opening one or pair and a closing one or pair. Single quotation
marks are more common.
In dialogue, direct speech often comes with a reporting clause, such as she
said. Sentences [1]–[3] illustrate the usual punctuation of direct speech with a
reporting clause when the direct speech is a declarative sentence. The reporting
clause can appear in one of three positions:
[1]
She said, ‘The solution is in your hands.’
[2]
‘The solution is in your hands,’ she said.
[3]
‘The solution,’ she said, ‘is in your hands.’
When we report the original in our own words, we use indirect speech:
She told us that the solution was in our hands.
Rules for punctuating direct speech
The following are the rules for punctuating direct speech with a reporting clause:
(a) initial reporting clause, as in [4]
It is usual to put a comma after the reporting clause and before the initial quotation
marks:
[4]
She told them, ‘We should not waste food when millions are starving.’
We may use a colon instead of a comma, particularly if the direct speech contains
more than one sentence:

190
An Introduction to English Grammar
[5]
He turned to me and said: ‘For the ﬁrst time in my life I understood who
I was and what I was doing and why I was doing it.’
If the quotation is indented, it is not necessary to use quotation marks since the
layout is a sufﬁcient indication of direct speech.
If the quotation ends the sentence, we put a full stop, a question mark, an
exclamation mark, or a dash before the ﬁnal quotation marks. The full stop is
illustrated in [1], [3], [4], and [5]. The other three marks are illustrated in [6]–[8]:
[6]
The reporter asked, ‘Has the general arrived?’
[7]
The crowd cried, ‘Long live the President!’
[8]
She said, ‘I have done my share, but you –’
The dash in [8] indicates that the speaker has stopped in mid-sentence.
If the question mark or exclamation mark belongs to the sentence as a whole (not
to the direct speech), it goes after the closing quotation marks:
[9]
Did she say, ‘It is against my religious principles’?
[10]
He actually said, ‘I am too busy to see you’!
In the rare situation when the question mark or exclamation mark belongs both to
the sentence and to the direct speech, use only one mark and put it before the
quotation marks:
Did she say, ‘Is it against your religious principles?’
(b) ﬁnal reporting clause, as in [2]
If the direct speech sentence would ordinarily end in a full stop, put a comma
before the quotation marks:
[11]
‘I’m not yet ready,’ he replied.
Otherwise, use a question mark or exclamation mark as appropriate:
[12]
‘Do you know the way?’ she asked.
[13]
‘Lights!’ he screamed.
The sentence may continue after the reporting clause:
[11a]
‘I’m not yet ready,’ he replied, and put down the telephone.
[11b]
‘I’m not yet ready,’ he replied; then he put down the telephone.
(c) medial reporting clause, as in [3]
The medial clause combines punctuation features associated with the initial and
ﬁnal reporting clause. The punctuation before the medial clause is the same as for
the ﬁnal reporting clause:

Punctuation
191
[14]
‘I’m not yet ready,’ he replied. ‘You go ahead without me.’ (cf. [11])
[15]
‘Do you know the way?’ she asked. ‘I’m lost.’ (cf. [12])
[16]
‘Lights!’ he screamed. ‘Give me lights!’ (cf. [13])
If the reporting clause interrupts a sentence, use a comma even if the sentence
would ordinarily have no punctuation:
[17]
‘When you are ready,’ he said, ‘let me know.’ (cf. When you are ready, let
me know.)
[18]
‘I know,’ he said, ‘that they suspect me.’ (cf. I know that they suspect me.)
The punctuation after the medial reporting clause depends on whether the ﬁrst
part is an independent sentence. If it is, a full stop follows the reporting clause, as
in [14]–[16]. If the reporting clause interrupts the sentence where the sentence
would ordinarily have a comma or no punctuation, as in [17] and [18], then a
comma follows the clause. If the reporting clause is placed where the sentence
would ordinarily have a semicolon, the semicolon follows the reporting clause:
[19]
‘The ﬁrst two attempts to amend the constitution by convention succeeded,’
the senator said; ‘the next two attempts failed.’
The punctuation at the end of the sentence is the same as for the initial reporting
clause. We therefore have a full stop before the closing quotation marks in [14]–
[15] and in [17]–[19], and an exclamation mark in [16]. Here are two further
examples:
[20]
‘Did you say,’ she asked, ‘that she would see me now?’
[21]
‘I have done my share,’ she said, ‘but you –’
(d) in general
It is normal to start a new paragraph when there is a change of speaker, whether or
not the direct speech is accompanied by a reporting clause:
‘What was in the letter?’ she asked.
‘I can’t tell you. I couldn’t read it.’
‘Why not?’
‘It was in Spanish.’
Use double quotation marks for a quotation within a quotation if you have used
single quotation marks for the main quotation:
‘I said I’d take the job. Then I went to bed and thought, “What am I
doing?” I don’t want my children to say “He was a good football coach”.
I want them to think that I tried to do more than that.’

192
An Introduction to English Grammar
If the quotation is not in full, the punctuation mark that follows it comes after
the quotation marks:
The Colonel says he regards ‘the past 20 years just as an introduction’.
He described the pleasure of seeing how deserts had become ‘not the
Garden of Eden exactly, but a bit greener’, though he made it clear that
self-fulﬁlment was not his aim.
Partial quotations draw attention to a signiﬁcant part of what was said, and they
may therefore be very brief:
The newspapers carried reports of a famine of ‘biblical proportions’ in
Ethiopia.
Sometimes the party sounds a little too enthusiastic about enforcing
majority ‘rights’.
In the last example the effect of inserting the quotation marks is to suggest that
the writer does not accept responsibility for the appropriateness of the expression
‘rights’ in this context.
9.6
Citations
We use words in a special way when we refer to them as words. Compare [1]
with [2]:
[1]
They are in love.
[2]
Love can be either a verb or a noun.
In [1] love is used in the normal way. In [2] it is the word love that is being
discussed. When a word or phrase is cited – quoted or mentioned rather than used
in the normal way – it is either put in double quotation marks or underlined.
(Underlining in writing is the equivalent of italics in print.) If you use many such
citations or if you need quotation marks for other purposes, it is clearer to use
underlining rather than quotation marks. Deﬁnitions and translations of words and
phrases are usually in single quotation marks:
Perennial ‘perpetual’ or ‘recurring’ has its roots in the Latin per (‘through’)
and annus (‘year’).
Titles of works are also a special use of language. If the works are published or
produced separately (for example, books, magazines, movies, musical compositions),
they are underlined. But if the titles are for part of a larger work (for example,
articles, chapters, short stories, songs), they are enclosed in single or double quotation
marks:

Punctuation
193
I read the report in the New York Times.
You can ﬁnd that character in A Streetcar Named Desire.
My favourite Beatles song is ‘Eleanor Rigby’.
Contrast:
Hamlet is a complex play.
Hamlet is a complex character.
9.7
Questions
The general rule is that a question mark comes at the end of an interrogative
sentence:
Is our nation prepared for further sacriﬁces?
The rule also applies to tag questions (cf. 6.2):
She’s in quite a good frame of mind, isn’t she?
It extends to declarative questions, which have the structure of a declarative
sentence but function as a question (cf. 6.2):
You know the rules?
It is usual to put an exclamation mark at the end of an exclamatory question to
ensure that it is read as an exclamation:
Haven’t you grown!
Am I thirsty!
It is usual to put a full stop at the end of a question beginning Would you that
is intended as a polite request, particularly if the sentence is long. This usage is
common in ofﬁcial letters. In this context the writer expects the fulﬁlling of the
request, not a reply to the question:
Would you please send me a copy of the instructional book that should
have been enclosed with the microwave oven.
Do not use a question mark for an indirect question (a question in indirect
speech). Contrast the direct question in [1] with the indirect question in [2]:
[1]
He asked, ‘Who wants to speak?’
[2]
He asked who wanted to speak.

194
An Introduction to English Grammar
9.8
Restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses
Relative clauses post-modify nouns (cf. 4.5):
[1]
the house that they bought last year
[2]
a student who belongs to our group
[3]
the place where we ﬁrst met
The three examples above are restrictive relative clauses. Restrictive clauses
identify more closely what the nouns refer to. The house in [1] might be in contrast
with the house that they used to live in. The student in [2] might be in contrast with
a student who belongs to another group. The place in [3] might be in contrast with a
place where we met last week.
Non-restrictive relative clauses do not identify. They offer additional
information:
[4]
their present house, which they bought last year,
[5]
Jean, who belongs to our group,
[6]
San Francisco, where we ﬁrst met,
The house in [4] is identiﬁed by their present. The person in [5] and the place in [6]
are identiﬁed by their names. Names rarely need further identiﬁcation, but it is
possible to use a restrictive clause if further identiﬁcation is necessary, as in [7]:
[7]
The Jimmy Robinson who was in my primary school class has just become a
bank manager.
Restrictive clauses should not be punctuated. Non-restrictive clauses, on the
other hand, should be enclosed in punctuation marks. The usual punctuation is a
pair of commas, as in [8], unless a major punctuation mark (cf. 7.3) would ordin-
arily appear at the end of the non-restrictive clause, as in [9] and [10]:
[8]
The regulations, which took effect last year, list over 500 industrial pro-
cesses and materials as hazardous.
[9]
Americans are becoming like Europeans, who prefer to buy goods that last a
long time.
[10]
I have grown tired of my old stereo, which I bought 12 years ago; however,
I can’t afford to buy a new one.
Dashes or parentheses are sometimes also used to enclose non-restrictive clauses.
Dashes indicate dramatic pauses and parentheses separate the clause more distinctly.
Non-restrictive relative clauses may refer back not only to a noun, but also to a
previous part of the sentence:

Punctuation
195
He failed his driving test, which must be discouraging. (‘His having failed
. . . must be discouraging.’)
He used to read political speeches, which is unusual for a 15-year-old.
(‘Reading political speeches is unusual for a 15-year-old.’)
The distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive applies also to reduced
relative clauses – those that correspond to relative clauses. Contrast the restrictive
clause in [11] and the non-restrictive clause in [12]:
[11]
research involving chemical reactions (‘that involves chemical reactions’)
[12]
his recent research, involving chemical reactions,
Here are further examples of restrictive clauses.
It is impossible to ﬁnd a teacher who is happy with the facilities at her school.
The team has developed a fungicide that acts as a toxic barrier when it is
applied to a vine’s bare wood.
He imagines building sites in which workers have been replaced by smart
machines.
Tumours that start when the patient is under twenty-ﬁve usually have an
underlying environmental cause.
For the course on current European politics, these are the best books
to read.
Here are further examples of non-restrictive clauses:
The Brady cactus, which is small and single-stemmed, retracts its head into
the soil during dry hot spells.
The technology has opened up astonishing new possibilities, many of
which are already being exploited.
Human infants pass through a critical period, lasting a few years, during
which they acquire language.
The foreigners, treated by the rebels as guests rather than as hostages, were
allowed to escape the next day.
My aunt, who is frightened of ﬂying, had a very unpleasant experience on
an aeroplane recently.
9.9
Restrictive and non-restrictive apposition
Apposition expresses a relationship of some equivalence between two units (cf. 4.6):
The civil servants often switch from English, the ofﬁcial language, to their
native languages.

196
An Introduction to English Grammar
The relationship can be demonstrated by linking the two units with the verb be:
English is the ofﬁcial language.
The second unit is generally in apposition to the ﬁrst.
Like relative clauses (cf. 9.8), appositives are restrictive or non-restrictive: restric-
tive appositives identify more closely the preceding noun, whereas non-restrictive
appositives offer additional information. And as with relative clauses, restrictive
appositives are not punctuated, whereas non-restrictive appositives are enclosed in
punctuation marks, normally a pair of commas but occasionally dashes or paren-
theses. Appositives may be either noun phrases or clauses.
Here are examples of restrictive appositives:
My brother Tom is an architect.
Do you know the meaning of the word ‘egregious’?
I heard on the radio the news that Kabul had been attacked.
The fact that she likes the job suggests that she will remain here for a long
while.
Here are examples of non-restrictive apposition:
The genuine American hamburger, a ground beef patty served on a bun, was
invented at the beginning of the twentieth century.
The most reliable indication of Islam’s revival is the observance of the
hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that devout Muslims are expected to make at
least once in their lifetime.
Scientists have discovered two sets of hydrothermal vents (ocean hot springs).
His greatest service – the issue that made him famous – was the way he
defused the crisis.
The agency ignored their objection, that the anti-pollution measures would
greatly increase the cost of the products.
Like non-restrictive relative clauses, non-restrictive appositives can refer back to a
previous part of the sentence, not merely to a noun phrase:
The scientists wanted their research to be useful, an indication of their
desire to work for the beneﬁt of humanity.
Retail prices are begining to rise, an early warning of inﬂation.
9.10
Adverbial clauses
Clauses that function as adverbials in sentence structure are adverbial clauses
(cf. 6.9). Adverbial clauses occur initially, medially, and ﬁnally. Medial position –
the position between the subject and the verb – occurs relatively infrequently.

Punctuation
197
When adverbial clauses are punctuated, the normal punctuation marks are com-
mas. In medial position, the clauses are enclosed in a pair of commas.
Adverbial -ing and -ed clauses (cf. 6.8) are generally punctuated, whatever their
position:
Feeling unadventurous, I ordered chicken soup for my ﬁrst course.
My parents, needing money for extensive house repairs, applied for a second
mortgage.
His colleague worked in the corporate section, selling art to big ﬁrms.
When asked to speak, he complained about the poor service.
My wife, not easily pleased, declared that the play was excellent.
It is peaceful to ﬂoat down a river, carried effortlessly by the current.
Medial ﬁnite clauses are always punctuated:
The members of the committee, when they read his report, demanded his
resignation.
Initial ﬁnite and inﬁnitive clauses (cf. 6.8) are often punctuated:
If the negotiations are held in public, they are likely to fail.
As the canoe drew near, the design on its prow became visible.
To push a wheelchair, you need muscle power.
The punctuation of ﬁnal ﬁnite and inﬁnitive clauses depends on their relation-
ship to the rest of the sentence. If they specify the circumstances of the situation,
they are not punctuated:
Call me if you decide not to come with us.
Security has been heightened since a porter was mugged.
I recognized her talents before anyone else did.
People often phone to thank me for my advice.
If they provide additional information or a comment, they are punctuated:
She walked fast, so that she arrived before us.
They expelled him from the country, although he had not been charged with
a crime.
I have been studying every day past midnight, since I want to graduate
this year.
He was self-conscious in his casual clothes, as if he had appeared without
socks for a formal reception.
It’s too large, if I may say so.
The suit doesn’t ﬁt him, to tell you the truth.

198
An Introduction to English Grammar
The same applies to verbless clauses (cf. 6.8):
If in difﬁculty, phone me.
Her father, when a hotel manager, had to work overtime every night.
The procedure was simple, though somewhat unpleasant.
If the sentence is negative, the absence of punctuation indicates that the nega-
tion includes the adverbial clause. The distinction is particularly sharp for a
because-clause:
[1]
He didn’t go there because his sister was going to be there.
The absence of a comma before the because-clause in [1] suggests the interpretation
‘He did go there, but not because his sister was going to be there’. On the other
hand, the presence of a comma stops the negation from applying to the because-
clause, as in [2]:
[2]
He didn’t go there, because his sister was going to be there.
The interpretation of [2] is ‘He did not go there, and he decided not to because his
sister was going to be there’. The same interpretation applies if the because-clause
is fronted:
[2a]
Because his sister was going to be there, he didn’t go there.
Adverbials other than clauses are often separated by commas if they provide a
comment or have a linking function:
Unfortunately, we were unable to attend your party.
It was, quite frankly, a very boring speech.
She was, in fact, a mathematical genius.
None of the children liked the puppet show, to my surprise.
Do you know her, by the way?
His opinion, however, does not carry any weight.
Rhetoric has started wars; on the other hand, rhetoric has stopped wars.
In summary, his idea was neither original nor correct.
9.11
Vocatives and interjections
Vocatives are phrases – commonly names – that directly address the person spoken
to. Vocatives resemble adverbials in their range of positions and are always separ-
ated by commas:

Punctuation
199
Mr Chairman, I want to second the motion.
Can you tell me, Caroline, what I have to do next?
Turn on the light for me, Jean.
Similarly, interjections and other reaction expressions are isolated by commas:
Oh, we didn’t expect to see you so soon.
Well, what’s your explanation?
Yes, the ﬁnals will be next week.
OK, we’re ready.
9.12
Avoidance of misunderstanding
Commas may be needed to prevent readers from misunderstanding the sentence,
even if only momentarily:
Above all, discrimination is ethically indefensible. [Not all discrimination.]
After cleaning, position the cutter centrally over the retaining clip and
push downwards. [Not After cleaning position.]
When architectural changes occur, clearly society is changing. [Not occur
clearly.]
To be honest, workers don’t stay there long. [Not honest workers.]
In most parts of the country you replaced thou, and ye was rarely used.
[Not you replaced thou and ye.]
If the same verb appears twice, a comma is inserted between the two verbs:
What she thinks her role on the committee is, is likely to inﬂuence her
decisions.
9.13
Genitives of nouns
In writing we indicate that nouns are genitive (cf. 5.7) by using an apostrophe. The
general rules for forming the genitive are:
1.
If the noun is singular, add ’s.
David
David’s brother
the student
the student’s expectations
the woman
the woman’s options
2.
If the noun is plural and ends in -s, add just an apostrophe.
the students
the students’ expectations
my sisters
my sisters’ friends
his parents
his parents’ address

200
An Introduction to English Grammar
3.
If the noun is plural and does not end in -s, add ’s.
the women
the women’s suggestions
the people
the people’s decision
the police
the police’s reactions
There is some variation among writers about singular nouns ending in -s. On the
whole, it is safer to follow the general rule and add ’s:
The boss’s daughter
Charles’s video
Burns’s poetry
Dickens’s novels
The traditional exceptions, which take just the apostrophe, are:
1.
the genitive of Jesus and Moses
Jesus’ teaching
Moses’ blessing
2.
names of more than one syllable that end in -s and have an ‘eez’ sound:
Socrates’ death
Xerxes’ defeat
In the ﬁxed expressions for . . . sake where the noun in the middle ends in an ‘s’
sound, the noun traditionally takes just the apostrophe:
for goodness’ sake
for appearance’ sake
9.14
Genitives of pronouns
Certain indeﬁnite pronouns (cf. 5.25) have a genitive ending in ’s. These are one,
compounds ending in -one (e.g. someone), and compounds ending in -body (e.g.
somebody):
one’s friend
anybody’s idea
nobody’s fault
someone’s move
In the combinations with else, ’s is added to else:
someone else’s coat
no one else’s fault
The indeﬁnite pronoun other follows the general rule for nouns: the genitive
singular is other’s and the genitive plural is others’:
each other’s letters
one another’s children
the others’ problems (the problems of the others)
Possessive pronouns (cf. 5.19) ending in -s should not have an apostrophe:

Exercises marked with an asterisk are more advanced.
Exercise 9.1 Sentence fragments and fragmentary sentences (cf. 9.2)
The paragraphs below contains many sentence fragments and fragmentary sentences.
Re-punctuate the paragraphs to remove the sentence fragments and fragmentary
sentences.
James Joyce’s novel Ulysses describes the adventures of Leopold Bloom
in Dublin on a single day, June 16 1904 – now celebrated every year as
‘Bloomsday’. Bloom makes breakfast for his wife. Goes to a funeral. Goes
to a newspaper ofﬁce. Drinks. Gets into a ﬁght. Thinks his wife is having
an affair. She is. And so is Bloom. Flirts with a girl on the beach. Meets
Stephen Daedalus. In a brothel. Goes home. Goes to bed. Not much
adventure, you might think.
Actually, the adventure is in the use of language. Most people think
Ulysses is a difﬁcult novel. And it is. But it is also a very rewarding one. If
you persevere with it. Highly inventive, original, and extremely funny in
places. Also very explicit at times. It was originally banned in most coun-
tries on the grounds of ‘obscenity’. Not the sort of book you would give to
your maiden aunt.
Exercise 9.2 Run-on sentences and comma splices (cf. 9.3)
Correct errors in run-on sentences and comma splices.

10.1
Register variation
In 1.6 we introduced the concept of grammatical variation according to communi-
cative purpose, the context in which language is used, and according to whether
the medium is writing or speech. Varieties of language associated with speciﬁc uses
and communicative purposes are called registers. In this chapter we will examine
the distinctive features of a range of registers, including conversation, unscripted
monologue, sports commentaries, and emails.
10.2
Conversational English
Whether it is chatting among friends, among colleagues, or asking directions of
strangers in the street, everyday, face-to-face conversation accounts for by far the
greatest amount of language use. The following is an extract from a family con-
versation. The speakers are identiﬁed as A, B and C. A and B are a husband and
wife respectively, and C is their adult daughter. The speakers are British, and
the conversation was recorded in London in the 1990s. Pauses are denoted by the
symbol <,> and overlapping segments are bracketed.
A:

I was a fool

[ICE-GB-S1A-007-1f ]
The recording has been transcribed orthographically, that is, the words have
been transcribed as they would appear in writing, observing the usual rules of
spelling and capitalization, but without punctuation. At ﬁrst glance, therefore, the
extract appears to resemble writing, but this is simply an artefact of the transcrip-
tion. Closer examination will reveal some important differences between speech
and writing, and some characteristics that are unique to conversational English.
The extract contains a great deal of overlapping speech. Typically, the end of
one speaker turn overlaps with the beginning of the other turn. In these cases, the
interruption forces the ﬁrst speaker to yield the turn to the other speaker. In line
34, however, speaker C overlaps with a pause in B’s speech, but B does not yield
the turn.
The informal nature of this conversation can be seen at the level of vocabulary.
Minor expletives like blasted and damn are used, as well as colloquial expressions
like quid and her next door. Speakers B and C both address speaker A using
vocatives (cf. 7.11):
If you gave it to her Dad
Well you can’t blame her lovey
The extract also contains many items such as well, I mean, uhm and uh, which
are sometimes termed ‘ﬁllers’ or discourse particles. The functions of these are
various: the voiced pauses uhm and uh allow the speaker time to think, while
retaining the turn in the conversation. All three speakers use well at the beginning
of some of their utterances, often to signal a change of topic, or to introduce a
salient new point:
Well these damn plants have shot up in price . . .
Well can’t you buy a piece of glass . . .
Well she’s using it . . .
Well it annoys me . . .
Well you can’t blame her . . .
60
65

English in Use
211
Other discourse particles which are commonly used in conversation include you
know, sort of, and like.
The unplanned nature of the conversation is revealed in several instances of
non-ﬂuency, including repetitions (‘Yes because because I broke that window’),
false starts (‘I got two but I I can’t I think I left the other one up at Bow’), and
hesitations (That just sh shows you . . . )
All the speakers use a great many contractions, which are frowned upon in
formal writing, but are very characteristic of informal speech:
What you want’s a little greenhouse (cf. What you want is . . . )
What’s happened to the door
(cf. What has happened . . . )
D’you know how much glass is now (cf. Do you know . . . )
Unlike written English, many of the utterances in this extract are not complete,
grammatical sentences, in the sense that we have deﬁned this term. In other words,
they do not display the canonical subject–predicate structure that we looked at in
Chapter 3. Instead, the speakers use several fragmentary sentences (cf. 9.2):
Piece of glass
Almost opaque
Or a clip frame
Ellipsis (cf. 6.6) is a very common feature of conversational language. Ellipsis
refers to the omission of grammatical units. They are omitted in the interests of
economy. Since they can be recovered from the immediate context, there is no
need to include them. Ellipsis of the subject (cf. 3.5) is particularly common,
especially when the subject is I:
Could’ve cleared that square yard . . . (cf. I could’ve . . . )
Didn’t want it
(cf. I didn’t . . . )
In the following examples, both the subject and some or all of the verb phrase
(cf. 4.11) have been ellipted:
Still out there
(cf. It is still out there)
Cost a lot more now (cf. It would cost a lot more now)
Another characteristic of conversation is the use of tag questions (cf. 6.2):
You can’t blame her for that really can you
Absolute daylight robbery really aren’t they
. . . that’s got glass in it hasn’t it

212
An Introduction to English Grammar
In each case, the function of the tag question is to seek agreement from the other
speaker with what is said in the preceding part.
Compared with writing, and with more formal, prepared speech, conversational
English tends to be less complex syntactically. Even when they are grammatically
complete, most of the utterances are simple sentences, without subordination. The
following is an exception to this, since it contains two subordinate clauses (one
introduced by because, the other by when):
I brought that from Bow because I got it from the place next door when they
threw their window frames out
At the phrase level, too, informal conversation tends to be simple. Many of the
noun phrases (cf. 4.2) in this extract consist of a noun only (glass), a noun together
with one determiner (a fool, the shed) or a noun and a pre-modiﬁer ( frosted glass, fancy
glass). In this extract, pre-modiﬁers are far more common than post-modiﬁers.
When post-modiﬁers do occur, they are often simple prepositional phrases (cf.
4.25) introduced by of:
a piece of glass
a box of seeds
In the following noun phrase, the post-modiﬁer is a clause:
the door we had out there
This is a relative clause (cf. 4.5), or more accurately a zero-relative clause (cf.
5.24), since the relative pronoun has been omitted. This omission of the relative
pronoun is very common in conversation, but less common in more formal con-
texts, where we might expect to ﬁnd
the door that (or which) we had out there
In 1.6 we noted that one of the factors involved in grammatical variation is the
attitude of the speaker towards his or her audience, towards the topic, and towards
the purpose of communication. In more general terms, we can say that in conver-
sation, a major factor is the relationship between the speakers. The extract above
is from a family conversation – the speakers are all very familiar with each other,
and the conversation is informal, relaxed, and at times ‘jokey’. We would expect
a rather different type of conversation between, say, a student and his supervisor,
or between an employee and his employer.
Our second extract is from a counselling interview. Speaker A is a male univer-
sity student, aged 19, and speaker B is his counsellor, who is also male, aged
around 50. Again, the symbol <,> denotes a pause and overlapping strings are
bracketed.

non-ﬂuencies:

tag questions:
. . . that’s a big step forward isn’t it
and ﬁnally contractions:
. . . I’ve got to grips . . .
(cf. . . . I have got to grips . . . )
. . . you’re getting on top of the work (cf. . . . you are getting . . . )
. . . that’s in seminars . . .
(cf. . . . that is . . . )
However, it is noticeable that all of these features are much less frequent than in
the family conversation. There are also far fewer overlaps; because of the purpose
of the exchange, and the relationship between the participants, the speakers rarely
interrupt each other. On the other hand, there are far more pauses. These allow
the student time to frame a response to the counsellor’s questions, and they give
the counsellor time to consider his next question.
Compared with the family conversation, the counselling interview appears much
more ﬂuent, with much longer and much more complex utterances. In fact, almost
all the utterances in the counselling interview are complex sentences, that is, they
contain at least one subordinate clause. For example, Speaker A’s ﬁrst utterance is
a complex sentence:
I wish I could feel more relaxed . . .
Here, the subordinate clause I could feel more relaxed . . . functions as the direct
object (cf. 3.7) of the verb wish. In a more formal context, such as in writing, the
subordinate clause would be introduced by that:
I wish that I could feel more relaxed . . .
Here, we will list and describe some of the other complex sentences in the
counselling interview. The subordinate clauses are underlined:
Yeah but I would like to improve it
(to-inﬁnitive clause functioning as direct object of the verb like)
It <,> can still be improved even if it is fairly good
(if-clause functioning as adverbial (cf. 3.9))
So you now feel that you’re getting on top of the work
(that-clause functioning as direct object of the verb feel)
I’ve got to grips with my subject better uhm <,> than I have in <,> in
previous weeks
(comparative clause (cf. 6.9) introduced by than)

English in Use
215
you understand what’s going on
(nominal relative clause (cf. 6.9) functioning as direct object of the verb
understand)
Speaker A’s ﬁnal utterance is quite long and confused. The speaker may be
nervous, or he may simply be unsure of what he wants to say. The utterance con-
tains many false starts and repetitions, but we can nevertheless see that it contains
a great many subordinate clauses:
having said that
(an -ing-clause functioning as adverbial. In terms of meaning, it has con-
cessive force.)
I still ﬁnd that when I eat
(adverbial clause, expressing time)
I know that I should eat
(that-clause functioning as direct object of the verb know)
The complexity of the language used in the counselling interview is not conﬁned
to clause and sentence structure. Complexity can also be found in the phrase
structures (cf. Chapter 4). In Speaker B’s ﬁrst utterance, the subject is a complex
noun phrase, with the structure:
determiner
noun
post-modiﬁer
the
impression
I got
The post-modiﬁer of the noun impression is the zero-relative clause I got
(cf. 5.24). In formal writing, this would normally be introduced by the relative
pronoun that:
the impression that I got
Here are some more examples of complex phrases in the counselling interview:
certain aspects of my life
pre-modiﬁer
noun
post-modiﬁer
certain
aspects
of my life
In this case, the post-modiﬁer is a prepositional phrase (cf. 4.25)

216
An Introduction to English Grammar
the resources available to me
determiner
noun
post-modiﬁer
the
resources
available to me
Here, the post-modiﬁer is itself a complex phrase. It is an adjective phrase with the
following structure:
adjective
post-modiﬁer
available
to me
So the phrase the resources available to me is a complex noun phrase which contains
a complex adjective phrase embedded within it (cf. 4.1).
a big step forward
determiner
pre-modiﬁer
noun
post-modiﬁer
a
big
step
forward
The use of an adverb ( forward) to post-modify a noun is restricted to a small
number of adverbs. Further examples include:
the people upstairs
the day before
the way back
One further aspect of the counselling interview is worth noting. In asking
questions, the counsellor makes frequent use of declarative questions (cf. 6.2).
Declarative questions have the formal characteristics of a declarative sentence, but
they are in effect questions. In lines 17f. the counsellor uses three declarative
questions in rapid succession:
B:
So you now feel that you’re getting on top of the work
A:
Yes
B:
Uhm <,> and uh you understand what’s going on
A:
Yes <,>
B:
And that’s in seminars and lectures
A:
We don’t uh have seminars as such
Because of the context, speaker A has no difﬁculty in interpreting each of these as
having the force of a question, despite their declarative form. The use of declarative

questions is clearly suited to counselling interviews, but we would expect this
questioning technique to be less common in a less structured exchange.
The counselling interview shares some of the features of the family conversa-
tion. In one sense, they are both ‘conversations’, but that term must be interpreted
broadly. Both extracts have distinctive features of their own. Returning to our
earlier point, it is clear that many factors are at work in determining differences
among and within linguistic registers. In face-to-face conversation, the relationship
between the speakers is a signiﬁcant factor, as are the age and sex of the speakers. The
speakers’ educational background is also an important factor. In terms of the com-
municative situation, it is important to consider the purpose of the exchange, the
topic or topics being discussed, and the speakers’ attitudes towards those topics.

Unscripted monologue
The extract below is from a judge’s summation of a court case involving an
accident at a builder’s yard. The judge is summing up the facts of the case for the
beneﬁt of the jury. The symbol <,> denotes a pause.
Uh he estimated the slope at the time in nineteen eighty-four to’ve been
something like one in four <,> a a and it sloped down <,> uh for <,>
uhm a distance of uhm uh <,> I think for three or four <,> uhm feet or
possibly more <,> than the length of the slope
It may even have been uh <,> uh up to about two yards <,>
Now because of the uneven ground and because of the <,> liability to rut
and uhm also because of this slope <,> the <,> ground <,> was plainly
<,> uh uh and this seems to have been uh common ground between the
witnesses who were called in this case <,> uhm a bad place for <,>
stacking <,> uh these lintels and beams <,> uh uh and the reason why it
was a bad place is obvious <,>
Uh the uh uh beam the stacks were liable to become unstable particularly
when <,> uh the forklift truck was being used <,> uhm for taking the
beams away <,>
Beams were taken away from one side and the stack was leaning to some
extent <,> then over the stack would go and the beams would all fall to
the ground <,>
Uh on other occasions uh during the course of loading <,> uh there
would be minor collisions between the forklift trucks and these stacks and
the beams would go over in that way <,> and the consequence of that was
<,> that at <,> fairly frequently it became necessary to tidy this place
<,> uh up <,>
Now this tidying up usually took place when the factory machine broke
down and the gang in the factory would be then available for the tidying
up operation <,> and uh when that happened the men in the factory <,>

time they would set about tidying up these beams <,>
Well now how did this accident happen <,> if it did happen <,>
[ICE-GB-S2A-067-1ff.]
This unscripted monologue displays many of the characteristics that we saw in
the family conversation and in the counselling interview (10.2). There are many
pauses, and many voiced pauses, which have been transcribed as uh and uhm. In
line 1 there is a contraction to’ve (to have). There are also many non-ﬂuencies.
These include false starts:
. . . the consequence of that was <,> that at <,> fairly frequently . . .
and self-corrections:
Uh the uh beams the stacks were liable to become unstable . . .
The speaker uses the discourse particle now to introduce new points in his
description of events and, in line 28, he uses well now to introduce his ﬁnal
question, which in a sense is the culmination of his speech.
In describing the facts of the case, the judge presents a series of events as a
sequence of clauses which are loosely connected by and:
Beams were taken away from one side
and
the stack was leaning to some extent then over the stack would go
and
the beams would all fall to the ground
This use of and is very common in continuous speech. However, it does not
perform any real coordinating role in this case; it is simply used to string together
a series of clauses.
In line 3 there is a parenthetic clause I think (cf. 7.18), but lines 7f. contain a
much longer parenthesis:
the <,> ground <,> was plainly <,> uh uh and this seems to have been uh
common ground between the witnesses who were called in this case <,> uhm a
bad place for <,> stacking <,> uh these lintels and beams
The parenthetic clause occurs between the verb (was) and the subject complement
(a bad place for stacking these lintels and beams). Such a long parenthetic clause
would be unusual in formal writing. If it did occur, it would be enclosed in
brackets or marked off from the rest of the sentence using dashes.

219
Line 16 contains an interesting example of fronting (cf. 8.3):
. . . then over the stacks would go . . .
Here, the adverb over (part of the phrasal verb go over) has been moved to a posi-
tion before the subject in order to give it greater emphasis. The result is a more
‘dramatic’ description of the accident. Compare this version with the conventional
word order, which is a much more ‘ﬂat’:
. . . then the stacks would go over . . .
The effect of fronting is to make the fronted element more conspicuous, and to
give it more dramatic focus. Compare:
Twenty pounds it cost me.
(fronted)
It cost me twenty pounds.
(normal word order)
10.4
Sports commentaries
Sports commentaries are also a type of unscripted monologue. They offer an
interesting example of language use because in them the commentator has to
describe events which happen as he is speaking, and over which he has no control.
In many sports, the action is very fast, and events succeed each other in rapid
succession. The commentator therefore must be able to react quickly under great
pressure, and he must describe events coherently without having any time to
prepare or rehearse. Sports commentaries therefore offer us interesting examples
of truly spontaneous and public language use.
The extract below is from a radio commentary on an FA Cup match between
Manchester United and Queen’s Park Rangers.

He knocks it in there
McClair gets a good shot from Bruce

drags the ball up to the halfway line

was fouled
Free kick to United just inside the Rangers’ half

make the break forward with Bardsley
Bardsley now facing a challenge from Paul Ince puts a short ball back to
Barker and he goes back out to Wegerle on the far side
A good idea to set Barker away again but a vital interception coming in
from Blackmore and now United move forward
It’s with Brian McClair
McClair moves down the centre
He’s got Hughes to his right <,> and he was aiming for Mark Hughes

In this extract it is very noticeable that the length of the units corresponds
closely with the speed of the action being described. During periods of intense, fast
action, the utterances are very brief and ‘telegraphic’ in style, as the commentator
tries to keep pace with the action. During less intense periods – when there is a lull
in the game – the commentator has more time to produce longer and grammatically
more complex utterances.
In the ‘telegraphic’ utterances, there is a great deal of ellipsis, including ellipsis
of the main verb:
Steskal in goal (cf. Steskal is in goal)
Channing Bardsley Maddox and Sampson at the back (cf. . . . are at the
back)
The ball currently inside the centre circle . . . (cf. The ball is currently . . . )
. . . the ball at the moment with Paul Ince . . . (cf. the ball at the moment
is with . . . )
There is also ellipsis of determiners (cf. 5.26) in some noun phrases (cf. 4.2):
Tackle coming in . . . (cf. A tackle . . . )
Free kick to United . . . (cf. A free kick . . . )
The use of progressive aspect (cf. 4.14) is very striking in this commentary,
but the progressive auxiliary be is usually ellipted:
Steskal going up . . . (cf. Steskal is going up . . . )
United tonight playing with a familiar line-up (cf. United are playing . . . )
The corner coming out . . . (cf. The corner is coming out . . . )
Ellipsis allows the commentator to speak quickly in order to keep pace with the
action, while having no detrimental effect on comprehensibility.
In terms of clause relationships, the ‘telegraphic’ style of a sports commentary
may be described as a kind of loose ‘stringing together’ of short clauses or other
units, with no grammatical relation between them:
60

222
An Introduction to English Grammar
Played forward by Robson
Hughes tries to lay it off for McClair
Comes back now for Neil Webb
Webb wisely spots Irwin in space
Chipped into the middle by Irwin
This loose ‘stringing together’ of units, without any grammatical relation between
them, is called parataxis. It is contrasted with hypotaxis, which refers to rela-
tions between units based on coordination or subordination (cf. 6.10).
Sports commentaries typically contain a large proportion of passive construc-
tions, often followed by a by-phrase (cf. 4.15):
It’s knocked back <,> by Danny Maddox
. . . ﬂicked forward by Justin Channing
but then knocked forward for United by Webb
We can compare these passive constructions with their active counterparts:
Danny Maddox knocks it back
Justin Channing ﬂicks it forward
Webb knocks it forward for United
In the active construction, the subject (the name of the player who is performing
the action) comes ﬁrst, followed by the verb. In the passive construction, this
information is postponed to the end of the clause, where it occurs in the by-phrase.
The passive construction therefore gives the commentator more time to identify
exactly which player is involved in the action. We might refer to the use of the
passive here as a type of ‘delaying tactic’ on the part of the commentator. Delaying
tactics are particularly important in a radio commentary, where even a brief silence
can be very disconcerting to the listeners. The commentator must keep speaking more
or less all the time, even when he is unsure about what is happening on the ﬁeld.
Here is another example of a delaying tactic:
. . . and quickly in there was Barker
Here, the commentator uses a changed word order to ‘buy time’ for himself, until
he has identiﬁed the player involved in the action. Compare this construction with
the more usual:
. . . and Barker was quickly in there
The following is the clearest example in this extract of a delaying tactic. As one
player is about to be substituted, the commentator does not yet know who his

English in Use
223
replacement is going to be. However he keeps speaking until he has identiﬁed the
substitute:
. . . and we’re going to see I think the introduction after just twelve minutes
of Alan McCarthy
The commentator is quite obviously ‘buying time’. He ﬁrst uses a parenthetic
clause I think (cf. 7.18), and then an adverbial after just twelve minutes (cf. 3.9).
These are inserted into the noun phrase the introduction of Alan McCarthy, between
the noun (introduction) and the post-modiﬁer (of Alan McCarthy). This is very
untypical of general language use. Typically, a noun is immediately followed by its
post-modiﬁer (cf. 4.4). In the sports commentary, however, the strategy clearly
serves the very useful purpose of ‘buying time’ for the commentator.
10.5
Email English
An estimated 6.1 billion emails are sent out daily around the world, and the ﬁgure
continues to increase. In the last decade, email has become an important commun-
ication tool, and email communication is already recognized as a linguistic register
in its own right, even if its conventions are not yet fully ﬁxed. Email is a written
form of language, but it is not simply a letter in electronic form. It also has many of
the characteristics of speech. However, we will begin by looking at some of the
features that emails share with other forms of writing, especially letters.
As a linguistic register, email is still very much in a development stage; usage
varies, and many users of the medium are still unsure about what the conven-
tions are. For example, in writing a letter, we know the convention of starting with
Dear John or Dear Sir, and ending with a salutation such as Best wishes or Yours
sincerely. The conventions are less clear in emails. Users are still often unsure
whether to use Dear John, Hi John, or simply John –. Much depends, of course, on
the relationship between the sender and the recipient. Among close friends, a wide
range of openings can be observed, including Hi, Yo, and Hey. However, if the
recipient is not personally known to the sender, many writers still tend to use the
more traditional ‘Dear . . .’ and ‘Yours sincerely’. In circulars, or emails to a mailing
list, Dear all or Dear List Members are commonly used.
Speed is an important aspect of email communication. This refers both to how
emails are delivered and also to how they are composed. Unlike a letter, which may
take days to arrive, an email may be read almost as soon as it is sent. As a result, the
sender may receive a reply very quickly, and so a rapid back-and-forth exchange of
emails can be entered into. Emails tend to be written very quickly. They are
typically brief, and many writers use abbreviations to speed up the act of composi-
tion. These include
thx (thanks)
u (you)

224
An Introduction to English Grammar
BTW (by the way)
FYI (for your information)
b4 (before)
CU (see you)
Some writers dispense with upper case letters altogether, since the upper case
requires an additional key stroke:
i met john on monday.
On the other hand, an email typed entirely in upper case letters is considered to be
a breach of ‘netiquette’, since the reader interprets it as the equivalent of shouting
in speech. A limited use of capitalization is generally acceptable, if it is used to give
emphasis:
We’re taking Libby to the doctor this morning to ﬁnd out why she’s
eating SO MUCH! . . . she’s becoming quite a blimp
Writers of emails are generally unconcerned with spelling errors or ‘typos’; only
the most careful writers will re-read and edit their emails before sending them. On
the part of readers, there is much greater tolerance of spelling errors in emails than
in handwriting or print. This is somewhat ironic, since electronic spellcheckers
make it easier to check an email than it is to check any of the more traditional
forms of written communication.
Speed of composition, and the typical brevity of emails, may be factors in what
many people perceive as a certain terseness in email messages, even when no such
thing is intended. An email is more likely to be misinterpreted than a letter. For
that reason, people sometimes use smileys or emoticons to indicate their intention,
or to clarify how their remarks are to be interpreted. Emoticons represent the facial
expressions of the writer:
:-)
smile
:-(
frown
;-)
wink
Some writers explicitly describe their own facial expressions by inserting <grins>,
<smiles>, or <laughs>. Similarly, ‘LOL’ (‘laughing out loud’) has become a
common tag in personal emails. Idiosyncratic spellings are sometimes used to
emulate certain aspects of speech:
This is just sooooooo boring.
Going to (yaaaaaaaaaawn) Dublin at the weekend.

English in Use
225
Here, the idiosyncratic spellings are used to represent extended vowel sounds, and
thereby to give added emphasis to what is being expressed. All of these strategies
are intended to compensate for a perceived deﬁciency in email communication, in
comparison with face-to-face conversation, where a great deal of the meaning is
communicated by the speakers’ facial expressions, gestures, stress, and intonation.
Other features of speech are also regularly represented in emails, by various
means. Most notable among these is the very common use of interjections and
discourse particles:
. . . by the way – you know the Britannica we bought for, eh, Elizabeth?
well, it arrived last week (30 vols) – we spent some time in Don’s shed
opening the boxes and having a look at it – like . . . wow!!!
Hey, hope u’re ok there. TGIF eh?
We turn now to the grammatical features of emails. In personal emails – that is,
among close, personal friends – there are many grammatical features that we
associate with speech, and speciﬁcally with conversation.
Yo –
We are in Newbridge (Whoa!) in an I-Cafe. Raining here. Been to see a
house – nice but too far from anywhere. The search goes on. How you?
Big day on Sunday, eh?
Since this is a personal email, the writer assumes a great deal of shared knowledge
with the recipient – a shared attitude towards Newbridge, perhaps, which is
expressed by the interjection Whoa!, and shared knowledge of some event on
Sunday. The writer observes many of the conventions of the written medium,
such as capitalization and punctuation, but in terms of grammar the message is
closer to a conversation. There is a great deal of ellipsis:
Raining here
(cf. It is raining here)
Been to see a house (cf. I have been to see a house)
How you?
(cf. How are you?)
and fragmentary sentences:
– nice but too far from anywhere
Big day on Sunday.
Even the grammatically complete sentences are very short, and no subordinate
clauses are used.
In less personal emails, brevity is still a central feature, both of the email itself
and of the individual sentences. However, in the following example, there is a
degree of sentence complexity, which is the result of subordination and coordination:

226
An Introduction to English Grammar
hi, thanks.
think i can make my way to you. plane is scheduled to land at 5:45, so by
the time i (hopefully) retrieve my bag and wend my way to central i guess
it will be nearer 6:30 to 7.
maybe i could call you from the airport and give you an ETA, or if i get
lost call again!
up to you really.
whatever, it is a very sunny august bank holiday monday in olde london
towne.
milly says hello,
see ya soon
K.
In this example, some quite complex sentences alternate with brief, fragmentary
sentences. The complex sentences are used to express the main business of the
message, which is to make travel arrangements. However, it is quite unlike a busi-
ness letter. We can see this in the informality and casualness of the language (hi, see
ya), and in the throwaway line beginning with Whatever . . . , which suggests that
the writer is not unduly worried about his travel arrangements. While maintaining
an informal and friendly tone, this email still succeeds in conveying the most
important information.
Apart from personal messages, email is probably most often used in the workplace,
as a means of communication among colleagues. In this case, the usual formalities
of a letter, such as ‘Dear . . .’, are often dispensed with altogether, leaving only the
business in hand. The following is an exchange between two colleagues:
I’m trying to delegate a few duties, as I simply don’t have the time to do
everything myself !
Thanks, – Charles
>Charles,
>My CD Writer isn’t working just now, among other technical problems,
>so I’d be grateful if you could send copies to the people concerned.
Gerry—I’ll be happy to do this.
The sole purpose of this exchange is to conduct business, although it is very
different from traditional communication by business letters. The greetings and
salutations are brief, and are not used consistently. Both writers use contracted
forms, such as I’ll, I’d, and don’t. These features contribute to the informal and
friendly tone of the exchange. On the other hand, the ‘business-like’ nature of the
communication can be seen in the fact that all the sentences are grammatically
complete. There is no ellipsis of the subject, which is very common in more
informal contexts. The objective of both writers is to convey information, and for
that reason most of the sentences display a high degree of complexity at both the
clause level and the phrase level:

English in Use
227
I’m trying to delegate a few duties, as I simply don’t have the time to do
everything myself!
The clause to delegate a few duties is a to-inﬁnitive clause, functioning as direct
object of the verb trying. The clause as . . . myself is an adverbial clause, expressing
reason. Finally, the noun time is post-modiﬁed by the to-inﬁnitive clause to do
everything myself.
My CD Writer isn’t working just now, among other technical problems,
so I’d be grateful if you could send copies to the people concerned.
This sentence consists of two clauses coordinated by the marginal coordinator so
(cf. 7.4). The ﬁrst clause is simple, though it contains two adverbials, just now and
among other technical problems. The second clause is complex: it contains an adver-
bial if-clause, expressing condition. The complex noun phrase the people concerned
has the following structure:
determiner
noun
post-modiﬁer
the
people
concerned
The post-modiﬁer is a reduced relative clause, in which the relative pronoun is
ellipted, and the verb phrase is non-ﬁnite (cf. 6.9). Compare:
the people who are concerned
The ﬁnal sentence contains a complex adjective phrase (cf. 4.21):
I’ll be happy to do this.
Here, the to-inﬁnitive clause functions as post-modiﬁer of the adjective happy.
10.6
The language of literature
Most of what we ﬁnd in the language of literature – particularly in prose ﬁction
and drama – we also ﬁnd in other uses of language. Writers select from what is
available in the language as a whole. Poetry, however, often departs from the
norms of language use in two respects: (1) in deviations from the rules and con-
ventions of ordinary language, and (2) in excessive regularities. For that reason, I
will be drawing my examples from poetry. At the same time, it must be said that
some poets are more inclined than others to keep close to everyday uses of lan-
guage, perhaps even to simulate the style of natural conversations.
The deviations that we encounter in poetry are located in various aspects of the
language. Poetry is distinctive visually. It is set out in lines that do not go right

228
An Introduction to English Grammar
across the page. Spaces may be left between sets of lines to indicate the beginnings
of new sections, and lines within sections may be indented in various ways to
indicate connections of some kind, perhaps in rhyme or metrical pattern. The
traditional verse convention is for each line to begin with a capital letter, but some
modern poets defy this convention. Some modern poets also defy the ordinary
language conventions of spelling and punctuation. In this respect, e.e. cummings is
particularly idiosyncratic: for example, he regularly writes the ﬁrst person singular
pronoun as ‘i’ and he sometimes inserts a punctuation mark in the middle of a
word.
Poets often create new words. These tend to follow the normal rules for word-
formation rather than being deviant. Some eventually enter the general language.
But new words are surprising at their ﬁrst appearance and they may never be
admitted to the general vocabulary, particularly when they are based on word-
formation rules that are little used. Gerard Manley Hopkins seems to have in-
vented unfathering (‘depriving of a father’). He describes how the snow ‘Spins to
the widow-making unchilding unfathering deeps’. The new word and its sense
are prepared for by the more transparent widow-making and the parallel unchilding
(an existing word, though uncommon). Hopkins has combined the preﬁx un- with
a noun to form a verb unfather in a deprivative sense. This is a rule of word-
formation that is little used. Even more rare is the formation of a negative noun by
preﬁxing un- to an existing noun. Thomas Hardy introduces the noun unhope as
the ﬁnal word in the last stanza of ‘In Tenebris’:
Black is night’s cope;
But death will not appal
One who, past doubtings all,
Waits in unhope.
We ﬁnd very few nouns with the preﬁx un-; two, for example, are untruth and
unrest. Hopkin’s unfathering, and Hardy’s unhope remain nonce-words (words coined
for a single occasion); they have not entered the vocabulary stock of the language.
Conversion is a common process for the formation of new words. We butter
bread, take a look, calm somebody. In these everyday examples, words have changed
from their original word-class to a new word-class without any change in their
form: Butter is a verb derived from a noun (‘put butter on’), look is a noun derived
from a verb, and calm is a verb derived from an adjective. Poets sometimes
introduce nonce-formations through conversion. Hopkins converts the adjective
comfortless into a noun in ‘grouping round my comfortless’ and the abstract non-
count noun comfort into a concrete count noun in ‘Here! creep, Wretch, under a
comfort’. e.e. cummings takes conversion to an extreme by converting the past
form did and its negative didn’t into nouns in ‘he sang his didn’t he danced his did’.
Sometimes the poet’s lexical innovations are compounds, the combination of
two words into one: Hopkin’s selfyeast in ‘selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours’;

English in Use
229
T.S. Eliot’s sea-girls; thought-fox in the title of a poem by Ted Hughes; and gift-
strong in John Berryman’s ‘when he was young and gift-strong’.
Poets often introduce unusual collocations of words, which may require ﬁgurative
interpretations. Examples abound. Here are just a few:
The child’s cry / Melts in the wall. (Sylvia Plath)
Bitter memory like vomit / Choked my throat. (Gary Snyder)
Your lips are animals (Anne Sexton)
This grandson of ﬁshes (Robert Bly)
across the castrate lawn (Richard Wilbur)
hopeless cathedrals (Allen Ginsberg)
Some deviations are grammatical. Departures from normal word order are com-
mon in poetry. In the following line from Walt Whitman the direct object Vigil
strange is fronted, an occasional unusual order in non-poetic language (cf. 9.3).
Vigil strange I kept on the ﬁeld one night
Also abnormal is the order vigil strange rather than strange vigil, since adjectives
generally come before the nouns they modify. In the next example from W.H.
Auden, the direct object A white perfection is abnormally placed between the
subject Swans in the winter and the verb have:
Swans in the winter air
A white perfection have
In another example, from Wallace Stevens, the phrase upon a hill is extracted
from the ﬁrst of a pair of coordinated clauses (I placed a jar in Tennessee upon a hill)
and placed after the second clause:
I placed a jar in Tennessee
And round it was, upon a hill.
In addition, the subject complement round is fronted from its normal position (it
was round). Finally, in these lines from a sonnet by Gerard Manley Hopkins, the
verb ﬁnd is abnormally omitted in the ﬁrst of two coordinated clauses:
. . . than blind
Eyes in their dark can day or thirst can ﬁnd
Thirst’s all-in-all in all a world of wet.
The sense is ‘than blind eyes can ﬁnd day in their dark?’

230
An Introduction to English Grammar
Excessive regularities are expressed in the systematic organization of features
that otherwise occur unsystematically in the language. Poetry is often marked by
patterns of sound; for example, metre, rhyme, and alliteration. The alliteration of l
in this stanza from Philip Larkin’s poem ‘Toads’ is so abundant that it could not
occur by chance in the ordinary use of language:
Lots of folk live on their wits:
Lecturers, lispers,
Losels, loblolly-men, louts –
They don’t end as paupers.
The alternate lines end with identical sounds: ts in wits and louts, and pers in lispers
and paupers.
Another type of patterning is parallelism. Parallel structures exhibit gram-
matical, lexical, and semantic similarities. Here is an example of close parallelism
from ‘Little Gidding’ in T.S. Eliot’s ‘Four Quartets’:
We die with the dying:
See, they depart, and we go with them.
We are born with the dead:
See, they return, and bring us with them.
In the next example, from the end of one of John Donne’s sonnets, the ﬁnal two
lines are parallel. This parallelism takes the form of chiasmus, a reversal of the
order of the two parts of the parallel structures: the except-clause comes ﬁrst in one
line, and second in the other line.
Take me to you, imprison me, for I,
Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,
Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.
The two clauses in the ﬁrst line are also parallel. Grammatically, both clauses are
imperative, starting with an imperative verb followed by a direct object. Lexically,
both clauses have the same pronoun me as direct object, and the verbs take (in this
structure) and imprison are partial synonyms. Semantically, both clauses express
the poet’s request to God (the subject that is understood from the previous con-
text) to take control of him.
One useful approach to literary analysis is to start by looking for the language
features that deviate from what we know to be normal in language. This approach
is explored in the following section.
10.6.1
Foregrounding
Literary language, especially poetic language, is distinguished by the consistency
with which it uses foregrounding. The term foregrounding is a visual metaphor; it

231
refers to the language features that stand out from the background of normal
use. One of the objectives that analysts of the language of literature may set for
themselves is to ﬁnd interpretations of foregrounding. As in all literary criticism,
there is scope for more than one interpretation, but some interpretations are more
plausible than others.
I take as my ﬁrst example a poem by Thomas Hardy, entitled ‘In Tenebris’ (‘In
Darkness’). It has a Latin epigraph from Psalm 102, which is rendered in the King
James version ‘My heart is smitten, and withered like grass’. The complete poem
follows:
Wintertime nighs;
But my bereavement-pain
It cannot bring again:
Twice no one dies.
Flower-petals ﬂee;
But, since it once hath been,
No more that severing scene
Can harrow me.
Birds faint in dread:
I shall not lose old strength
In the lone frost’s black length:
Strength long since ﬂed!
Leaves freeze to dun;
But friends can not turn cold
This season as of old
For him with none.
Tempests may scath;
But love can not make smart
Again this year his heart
Who no heart hath.
Black is night’s cope;
But death will not appal
One who, past doubtings all,
Waits in unhope.
The poem is divided into six stanzas. The stanza division is made more con-
spicuous than usual by the indentation of the ﬁrst and last lines, which are shorter
than the middle lines. Sound patterning reinforces the feeling that each stanza is a
unit: the two shorter lines rhyme and the two longer lines rhyme, and no rhymes
are repeated across stanzas. The metrical scheme is iambic (unstressed syllable
5

20

232
An Introduction to English Grammar
followed by stressed syllable), but contrary to the iambic norm every stanza begins
with a stressed syllable.
The parallelism in appearance and sound has its analogy in a parallelism in
sense. The stanzas elaborate the comparison expressed in the epigram from the
Psalms: a comparison between desolation in nature and desolation in personal
feelings. The ﬁrst line of each stanza portrays a negative image from nature, an
image that conjures up loss or danger. The next three lines relate this image to a
negative human experience.
Negation is foregrounded in the poem, which is replete with negative words
(no one, no more, none, not, no) and words with negative connotations (such as
wintertime, bereavement-pain, ﬂee, lose, black, death). The ﬁnal word is the nonce-
formation unhope, which we examined in the previous section. It makes a stronger
impact than a possible synonym such as despair might have. As the negative of
hope, it intimates the absence of any feeling of hope: a state beyond hope. The
contrast with hope is underlined by the collocation Waits in unhope, which brings to
mind the normal collocation waits in hope. In its strategic position as the ﬁnal word
of the poem, unhope is the climax to a series of preceding negative expressions.
The negation motif chimes with the imagery and themes of the poem. In each
stanza the comments that follow the nature imagery allude to previous experiences
of pain and despair. The consequences of past adversities have been permanent, so
that a repetition of the adversity can no longer affect the poet. The ﬁnal stanza
refers to the ultimate adversity – death. But even death ‘will not appal’.
In the ﬁrst half of the poem, the poet treats the experiences as personal to him
by using the ﬁrst person pronouns I, me, my. In the second half, his pain and
despair are distanced through the use of the third person pronouns him and his and
(in the ﬁnal stanza) the indeﬁnite pronoun one. Through the change in pronouns,
the poet generalizes from his own experiences to the human condition.
My ﬁnal example of foregrounding involves departures from both external and
internal norms. The poem, given in full below, is by Gerard Manley Hopkins. It is
titled ‘Heaven-Haven’ and subtitled ‘A nun takes the veil’. The subtitle provides
the situational context for the poem. The title not only points to the theme of the
poem (heaven as haven), but also introduces the linguistic device that dominates
the poem, close parallelism. The two words heaven and haven fall short of com-
plete identity by just one vowel sound as well as one letter:
1
I have desired to go
2
Where springs not fail,
3
To ﬁelds where ﬂies no sharp and sided hail
4
And a few lilies blow.
5
And I have asked to be
6
Where no storms come,
7
Where the green swell is in the havens dumb,
8
And out of the swing of the sea.

English in Use
233
The close parallelism in grammatical structure between the two stanzas calls attention
to itself. The last three lines in each stanza refer to places that are characterized by
the negatives not and no and by words that have negative connotations.
The closeness of the parallelism also foregrounds the differences between the
two stanzas. The ﬁrst stanza opens with I have desired to go and the second stanza
with I have asked to be. Desire is ambiguous between two meanings: the stative
‘wanted’ and the dynamic ‘asked’ (cf. 3.14). In the ‘asked’ interpretation, the line is
closer in meaning to the opening line of the second stanza. Both lines then describe
a past request. The present perfect have desired and have asked indicate that the
request is relevant to the present time of the poem, whereas the simple past I
desired and I asked might suggest that the person is no longer interested in having
the request granted. On the other hand, in the ‘wanted’ interpretation, I have
desired points to a feeling that has extended over a period of time to the present
but has not necessarily been translated into the action of making a request. The
ambiguity is mimetic of ambivalence. The ostensible speaker is a woman about to
become a nun, and she expresses some feeling of ambivalence about taking the veil.
The change from the ambiguous desired to the unambiguous asked suggests a
progression in the poem.
Similarly the switch from desired to go to asked to be marks a progression: the
dynamic go points to a striving, whereas the stative be indicates a state of rest.
There are other differences between the stanzas that suggest a similar advance.
There is more deviation from grammatical norms in the ﬁrst stanza, perhaps
mimetic of the striving: the archaic negation without do in springs not fail (instead
of springs do not fail), the fronting of the verb in ﬂies no sharp and sided hail, and the
separation of the two parts of the compound in sharp and sided hail (instead of
sharp-sided hail).
There is a difference between where the speaker has desired to go and where she
has asked to be. The ﬁrst stanza describes a countryside with springs and ﬁelds. It
alludes to material needs (springs not fail) and pleasures (a few lilies blow). The
second stanza describes a place of peace and quiet, the haven of the poem’s title.
The tension in the ﬁrst stanza – conveyed in large part by the grammar – is
resolved in the ﬁnal stanza. The ﬁrst stanza indicates a desire for positive things,
even though negatives are used: springs that do not fail, ﬁelds without hail, and the
presence of a few lilies. The second stanza calls for the absence of storms and tides:
the ideal is the absence of conﬂict.
In the next section we will explore the type of foregrounding that derives from
ambiguity.
10.6.2
Ambiguity
In the everyday uses of the spoken language and in most writing, ambiguity is a
fault to be avoided because it may cause confusion or misunderstanding. Poets,
however, introduce ambiguity intentionally to convey simultaneous meanings.

234
An Introduction to English Grammar
Puns, which are based on multiple interpretations, are employed playfully in
poetry as in jokes and advertisements, though they may also have a serious pur-
pose. The following stanza, from a poem by John Donne, contains two puns, one
on Sun and the other on done:
I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun
My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;
Swear by thyself, that at my death thy Sun
Shall shine as it shines now, and heretofore:
And, having done that, thou hast done,
I have no more.
Religious poetry traditionally puns Sun with Son, Christ the son of God, blending
the associations of natural light with the associations of spiritual light. The second
pun is personal, on the name of the poet: thou hast done combines the meaning ‘you
have ﬁnished’ with ‘you have Donne’. The last two lines of the poem echo a refrain
in the previous stanzas:
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
For I have more.
The poet tells God that when He has forgiven the sins he enumerates He has not
ﬁnished because he has more sins. At the same time, the pun conveys the added
meaning that God has not taken possession of Donne because he has more sins. It
is through Christ that at his death the poet will be fully forgiven by God and taken
by God.
Grammatical ambiguities are also found in poetry. They are generally more
difﬁcult to analyse than lexical ambiguities. The ﬁrst example comes from T.S.
Eliot’s The Waste Land, in an extract from the section called ‘The Fire Sermon’:
1
At the violet hour, when the eyes and back
2
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
3
Like a taxi throbbing waiting,
4
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,
5
Old man with wrinkled female breasts can see,
6
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives
7
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,
8
The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights
9
Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
The subject of this sentence, I Tiresias (line 4), is followed by two adverbials: a
verbless clause though blind and a non-ﬁnite clause throbbing between two lives.
Then comes an instance of apposition (cf. 4.7): Old man with wrinkled female

English in Use
235
breasts. This seems at ﬁrst reading to be in apposition with two lives: one life is an
old man, the other perhaps a woman with wrinkled female breasts. But the absence
of a description of a second life suggests that the reader has been sent on a false
trail. The phrase is then re-assigned as appositive to the subject of the sentence I
Tiresias. We have two grammatical analyses of the function of the appositive; the
second supersedes the ﬁrst, but the effect of the ﬁrst lingers. Tiresias is the old
man with wrinkled female breasts and the throbbing between two lives is the
uneasy straddling of male and female in Tiresias. The grammatical straddling
between two analyses reinforces the imagery. A second false trail is set by what
follows the verb can see (line 5). Is see here intransitive (‘Tiresias has the ability to
see’), or is it transitive (‘Tiresias can see somebody or something’)? If it is transi-
tive, we expect a direct object to follow later in the sentence. The reader is kept in
suspense for several lines. The phrase beginning with the evening hour is in apposition
with the violet hour (line 6). The evening hour is modiﬁed by a relative clause whose
predicates are coordinated: that strives / Homeward, and brings the sailor home from
sea. It looks as if what follows shares the verb brings and is coordinated, though the
coordinator and is implied and not present; brings the sailor home from sea, / The
typist home at teatime. The parallelism of the sailor home and The typist home and the
commas after sea and teatime encourage that initial reading. Yet as we read on, we
see that The typist has its own set of coordinated predicates: clears her breakfast, lights
/ Her stove, and lays out food in tins (lines 8–9). The typist could therefore be the
subject of a new sentence. Alternatively, The typist home at teatime might indeed be
coordinated with the sailor home from sea, and the predicates that follow might be a
relative clause (cf. 4.5) with the relative pronoun who omitted, though the omission
would be very odd in the ordinary use of language: brings . . . / The typist home at
teatime, [who] clears / her breakfast, lights / Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
Let us now turn back to the question whether see in line 5 is intransitive or
transitive. The question is in fact not resolved, since the grammatical status of see
depends on the interpretation of The typist home at teatime (line 8). If this phrase
begins a new sentence, see is intransitive. If it is coordinated with the sailor home
from sea (line 7), see is still intransitive. But there is yet a third possibility. The
phrase may be the subject of a that-clause (whose conjunction that is omitted)
which functions as direct object of a transitive see: I Tiresias . . . can see / At the
violet hour . . . [that] / The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights / Her
stove, and lays out food in tins. This interpretation, which is discouraged by the
comma after teatime, is given some support by a parallel sentence ﬁve lines later:
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest –
I too awaited the expected guest.
Yet the analysis of these lines is also not straightforward. The sentence is
parallel if Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest is the predicate of the sentence

236
An Introduction to English Grammar
(I Tiresias . . . / Perceived . . . ). But the absence of a comma after dugs allows the
possibility that the line is a relative clause with omitted who (I Tiresias . . . [who] /
Perceived . . . ).
We have seen that the phrase The typist home at teatime faces both ways and that
as a result there are three possible interpretations of lines 8–9 that depend on three
grammatical analyses. The grammatical ambiguities mimic the paradox of Tiresias,
a man who has wrinkled female breasts and a blind man who can see.
The next example of ambiguity comes from the ﬁrst four lines of a sonnet by
Gerard Manley Hopkins. In these lines, the poet calls on himself to turn away
from a cycle of self-accusations with which he is tormenting himself:
1
My own heart let me more have pity on; let
2
Me live to my sad self hereafter kind,
3
Charitable; not live this tormented mind
4
With this tormented mind tormenting yet.
Line 1 starts with the fronted My own heart, the complement of the preposition on
(cf. 4.25). Later in the line occurs the unusual positioning of more. The oddity of
the position of more foregrounds the word and is the cause of its grammatical
ambiguity. More may be an adverb (‘more often’) or an adjective modifying pity.
As an adverb, it should come at the end and be accompanied by some time
expression such as now or than before: ‘Let me have pity on my heart more than
before’. As an adjective, it should precede pity: ‘Let me have more pity on my
heart’. The basis of comparison for the adjective is left vague, but two possibilities
suggest themselves: ‘Let me have more pity on myself than on others’ or Let me
have more pity on myself than I have had before’. The second possibility is closer
to the interpretation indicated if more is an adverb, and it receives support from the
word hereafter in the parallel sentence that follows.
Live in line 2 seems to be treated as a linking verb, with the adjectives kind, /
Charitable as subject complement (cf. 3.8). In normal use, live is an intransitive or
a transitive verb, so we would ordinarily expect it to occur with adverbs rather
than adjectives (They lived happily ever after, not They lived happy ever after). The
grammatical deviation is highlighted by the postponement of the adjectives to the
end instead of the normal order as in ‘Let me live hereafter kind, charitable to my
sad self. The unusual structure with a subject complement contributes to the
ambiguities of the parallel contrasting sentence in lines 3–4.
The ambiguities lie in the grammatical function of this tormented mind. According
to one interpretation the phrase is a subject complement, parallel to kind, / Charit-
able, and then let me is implied from the preceding sentence: let / Me live to my sad
self hereafter kind, / Charitable; [let me] not live this tormented mind / With this
tormented mind tormenting yet. If we use be as the linking verb, a simple example of
this structure might be Let me be kind to myself, not be a tormentor. As in the
preceding sentence, it is odd to have live as a linking verb.

English in Use
237
In a second interpretation, this tormented mind is the subject of the intransitive
verb live and is parallel to me in the preceding sentence; only let is carried over.
The grammatical oddity in this interpretation is that the subject is placed after the
verb. If we repositioned the subject in the normal order, we would have [let] this
tormented mind not live with this tormented mind tormenting yet.
In the third interpretation, this tormented mind is the direct object of the transi-
tive verb live, and let me is implied from the preceding context. The ﬁrst part of
the sentence might be rephrased ‘Let me not live this tormented mind’. But as a
transitive verb, live is highly restricted in the direct objects it may take. We would
normally expect a noun phrase with life as its main word (‘Let me not live this
tormented life’), as in the expressions live a hard life, live a good life.
The verb torment is ordinarily a transitive verb, but no direct object follows it in
line 4. One interpretation is that this tormented mind is the object implied from line
3: With this tormented mind tormenting [this tormented mind] yet. The effect is to
suggest an endless cycle of tormentor and tormented, with the poet as a self-
tormentor. Alternatively, torment is exceptionally here intransitive, and the sense is
‘This tormented mind is still experiencing torment’. Compare My leg is hurting.
All the interpretations that I have offered for these four lines co-exist and, in
doing so, enrich the poem. The dislocations in grammar mimic the psychological
dislocations that the poet describes.
The ﬁnal example comes from the ﬁrst eight lines of a sonnet by John Milton.
The context of the sonnet is the onset of blindness in Milton and his reaction to his
disability.
1
When I consider how my light is spent,
2
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
3
And that one Talent which is death to hide
4
Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent
5
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
6
My true account, lest he returning chide,
7
Doth God exact day labour, light denied,
8
I fondly ask; . . .
There are various places where multiple interpretations are possible, but I will
focus on the last three lines of the octet. In lines 4–6 Milton asserts his eagerness to
present God with a ‘true account’ of his life, lest he returning chide (‘lest God when
He returns – or when He replies – rebukes me’). On an initial reading the question
in line 7 seems to be asked by God: Doth God exact day labour, light denied (‘Does
God require casual labour when light is denied?’). The question then appears to be
a rhetorical question that God asks in rebuking the poet, and as a rhetorical
question it seeks no answer (cf. 6.2). It implies the strong assertion that of course
God does not exact day labour when light is denied. However, when the reader
reaches line 8, it becomes transparent that the fronting of the question before the

238
An Introduction to English Grammar
reporting clause has laid a false trail. The question is not asked by God, but by the
poet: I fondly ask (‘I foolishly ask’). The question now emerges as a genuine yes–no
question, which the poet immediately evaluates as a foolish question. The folly of
the question is underlined by the previous reading of it as a rhetorical question,
which makes the question unnecessary. Because God’s assertion of His justice is
replaced by the poet’s questioning of God’s justice, the poet’s question is seen to
be insolent and presumptuous. The effect is obtained through the succession of
two analyses of the grammar of lines 6–7: the initial misinterpretation is immedi-
ately followed by an accurate second interpretation. The poet’s foolish question is
answered in the ﬁnal line of the sonnet:
They also serve who only stand and wait.

And feel this day Thy victorie;
For, if I imp my wing on Thine,
Afﬂiction shall advance the ﬂight in me.

In the stanza below, leaned may be a simple past or an -ed participle. Discuss
the effects of the ambiguity.
Webster was much possessed by death
And saw the skull beneath the skin;
And breastless creatures under ground
Leaned backward with a lipless grin.

2.
Below are the ﬁrst four lines of one of Shakespeare’s sonnets. Consider the
effects of the ambiguities in those lines. Line 1: (a) So may be a manner adverb
(‘in this way’) or a resultative conjunctive adverb (‘therefore’), supposing may
be an -ing participle (‘I suppose that you are true’) or a conditional conjunc-
tion (‘if ’). The sentence may be declarative or interrogative. Line 2: so may be
resultative (‘therefore’) or a purpose conjunction (‘so that’, ‘in order that’).
Line 3: new may be an adverb (‘newly’) or an adjective (‘to something new’);
altered may refer back to love’s face or to love.
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
Like a deceived husband – so love’s face
May still seem love to me, though altered new:
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
[William Shakespeare, ‘Sonnet 93’, from Shakespeare’s Sonnets, edited by
Stephen Booth (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1977)]
3.
In the stanza below, Bitter may be a direct object or a subject complement.
Discuss the ambiguity and its effects.
I am gall, I am heartburn. God’s most deep decree
Bitter would have me taste; my taste was me;
Bones built in me, ﬂesh ﬁlled, blood brimmed the curse.
[G.M. Hopkins, ‘I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day’]
4.
Discuss the effect of the punctuation of the stanza below on the meaning of
the passage.
To dispense, with justice; or, to dispense
with justice. Thus the catholic god of France,
with honours all even, honours all, even
the damned in the brazen Invalides of Heaven.
[Geoffrey Hill, ‘The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Péguy’]

Appendix: Spelling
A.1
Spelling, pronunciation, and meaning
English spelling is difﬁcult because the pronunciation of a word is not always an
accurate guide to its spelling. Two reasons account for most of the discrepancy
between pronunciation and spelling.
One reason is that our spelling system is essentially a mixture of two systems:
the system used in England before the Norman Conquest in 1066 was mixed with
a new system introduced by the Norman-French scribes. We therefore ﬁnd two
spellings for the same sound (as in the ﬁnal sound of mouse and mice) or two sounds
for the same spelling (as in the ﬁrst sound of get and gem). Later borrowings of
words from foreign languages – particularly from French, Latin, and Greek –
brought additional spellings; you will recognize as unusual such spellings as the ch
of chorus, the ph of philosophy, the g of genre, the oi of reservoir, and the oup of coup.
Some spellings were changed to bring words nearer to the form they had in other
languages, and the changes introduced letters that have never been pronounced in
English. One example is the b in debt: the b was present in the Latin word from
which the French equivalent came, but English borrowed the word from French
when French no longer had a b. Other examples of such changes are the b in doubt,
the l in salmon, and the p in receipt.
The second reason for the discrepancy between pronunciation and spelling is
that spellings have generally remained ﬁxed while pronunciations have changed.
During the Middle Ages the few who could write might spell the same word in
more than one way; they did not think that only one spelling was correct. When
the ﬁrst printers introduced printing in English in the late ﬁfteenth century they
began to establish stable spellings. However, during that century important sound
changes took place in English vowels. Those changes and later sound changes are
generally not reﬂected in our spellings. In the centuries that followed, printers
continued to work toward a uniform and stable system of spelling, and then the
major dictionaries of the eighteenth century established a standard spelling that is
close to our present system. On the whole, printers and dictionaries have been a
conservative force, preserving old spellings when sounds have changed. We there-
fore ﬁnd spellings like the gh of night and the k of know, which retain letters for
sounds that we no longer make. Or we ﬁnd different spellings for the same sound,

Appendix: Spelling
247
such as ea in meat and ee in need, because at one time those combinations rep-
resented different sounds. Or the sound changed differently in different words, so
that the same spelling represents for us two different sounds, such as oo in book
and ﬂood.
To some extent our spellings take account of meaning. Sometimes we lose in the
spelling-sound relationship but gain in the spelling-meaning relationship. In
the ﬁrst place, we often distinguish homophones (different words pronounced in
the same way) by spelling them differently. Here are a few common homophones
that we distinguish through spelling:
son – sun
peace – piece
sent – cent – scent
right – write
Secondly, we often use a similar spelling for parts of words that are related in
meaning even though we pronounce them differently. The -ed inﬂection, for
example, has the same grammatical functions in published and revolted, but the
inﬂection is pronounced in two different ways. The spelling may also show that
some sets of words are related where the pronunciation obscures the relationship.
For example, we spell the ﬁrst two syllables of nation and national identically, but
the ﬁrst vowel is pronounced differently in the two words. Similarly, the ﬁrst three
vowels of photography are different from the vowels of photograph, but our spelling
connects the two words. We pronounce the words in these sets differently because
we shorten vowels that are stressed weakly or not at all. Usually the unstressed or
weakly stressed vowel is pronounced like the second vowel of nation. Some com-
mon one-syllable words we pronounce in more than one way; in the rapid pace of
normal conversation we do not stress them and therefore we shorten their vowels.
For that reason we have at least two pronunciations of words like can, does, and
your. Sometimes we go further and drop the vowel completely; when we are not
writing formally, we can then show the omission by contractions of some words,
such as ’m for am, ’s for is or has, and ’ll for will.
A ﬁnal advantage of the relationship between spelling and meaning is that one
spelling of a word may represent different pronunciations, but the spelling shows
that it is the same word. English is an international language that is spoken
differently in different countries. Even within England we do not ﬁnd a uniform
pronunciation; the pronunciation of a word may vary from one area to another or
between groups within the same area. For example, some say roof with a long u
sound, others with a short u sound; some pronounce the ﬁnal r in words like car,
others do not; some pronounce the vowel in cup like that in luck, others like that in
put. Those spellings give some indication of pronunciation, but if we spelled words
exactly as we pronounced them, people with different pronunciations of a word
would spell the word in different ways. Our spelling usually indicates a shared
meaning; it does not necessarily represent an identical pronunciation.

A.2
Spelling variants
English spelling, like English punctuation, is a convention that is helpful to the
reader. Spelling mistakes distract and irritate readers. Good spelling is usually
considered a sign that the writer is educated.
The spelling of the vast majority of words is now ﬁxed. However, you will
encounter some variant spellings in your reading or in dictionaries. For example,
you may ﬁnd realise and realize, archaeology and archeology, judgment and judge-
ment, adviser and advisor. Do not use more than one spelling in a piece of writing,
since inconsistencies are distracting. If you are used to a recognized and acceptable
variant, keep to it. If not, select a dictionary and follow its spellings consistently.
Consult the introduction to your dictionary to ﬁnd out if it signals the preferred
spelling when there are variants.
Some spelling variants are exclusively British or are more common in British
writing. For example, British spelling uses the -ise and -isation endings (civilise,
civilisation) as well as the -ize and -ization endings that are normal for American
spelling (civilize, civilization). Here are some common American spellings and the
usual British spellings for the same word:
American
British
behavior
behaviour
center
centre
check
cheque
color
colour
draft
draught
jail
gaol
harbor
harbour
jewelry
jewellery
labor
labour
meter
metre
neighbor
neighbour
pajamas
pyjamas
rumor
rumour
Because of the constant movement of publications between America and Britain,
the national spelling distinctions are becoming acceptable variants in the two
countries and also in other English-speaking countries.
A.3
Spelling rules for short and long vowel sounds
1.
doubling of consonant after short vowel
The vowels a, e, i, o, u have both long and short pronunciations; for example, the
vowel a has a long pronunciation in rate and a short pronunciation in rat. The
following general rule applies if the vowel is stressed.

Appendix: Spelling
249
Generally, a long vowel is followed by a single consonant plus a vowel:
V + C + V:
long vowel + consonant + vowel
and a short vowel is followed by a double consonant; at the end of the word, a
short vowel can be followed by just a single consonant:
V + C + C:
short vowel + consonant + consonant
V + C:
short vowel + consonant (end of word).
Examples:
Long vowel
Short vowel
middle
end
V + C + V
V + C + C
V + C
V + C + C
tape, taping
matter, tapping
tap
camp
scene, scenic
message, begging
beg
sell
ripe, ripen
blizzard, shipping
ship
miss
hope, hopeful
bottom, hopping
hop
fond
amuse, amusement
suffer, cutting
cut
much
The rule is particularly useful when you add a sufﬁx or inﬂectional ending to a
word (cf. A.4 (1)).
2.
addition of ﬁnal -e to indicate long vowel
A ﬁnal silent -e is used to indicate that the preceding stressed vowel is long:
Long vowel
Short vowel
V + C + e
V + C
mate, debate
mat
theme, extreme
them
ﬁne, polite
ﬁn
robe, explode
rob
cute, amuse
cut
Here are some common exceptions, where the preceding vowel does not have the
regular pronunciation:
have; there, where; were; come, done, love, none, one, some; lose, move,
prove, whose; gone; give, live (verb)
The general rule applies also in the sequence V + C + le. Hence, in gable the vowel
a is long whereas in gabble it is short. Other examples of the long vowel in this
sequence:

250
An Introduction to English Grammar
Long vowel
V + C + le
able
cycle
noble
table
bible
idle
riﬂe
title
A.4
Sufﬁxes
A sufﬁx is an ending added to a word that produces another word; for example, the
sufﬁx ful is added to help to produce helpful. An inﬂection is a type of sufﬁx that is
added to the end of a word to produce another form of the same word; for
example, we add -s to the noun book to produce the plural books, and we add -ed to
the verb walk to produce the past walked. The general rules for sufﬁxes in (1)–(3)
below apply also to inﬂections, and the examples include words with inﬂections
added to them.
1.
doubling of consonant before sufﬁx
We often double a ﬁnal consonant when we add a sufﬁx beginning with a vowel.
Double the ﬁnal consonant before a sufﬁx beginning with a vowel:
1.
if the word ends in a single consonant, and
2.
if a single vowel comes before the consonant, and
3.
if the syllable before the sufﬁx is stressed.
Condition (3) always applies if the sufﬁx is added to a monosyllabic word.
sufﬁx added to monosyllabic word
Polysyllabic word: sufﬁx follows
stop + ed
→stopped
stressed syllable
swim + ing →swimming
permit + ed → permitted
big + er
→bigger
prefer + ed
→ preferred
red + ish
→reddish
forget + ing → forgetting
drug + ist
→druggist
begin + ing
→ beginning
win + er
→winner
occur + ence → occurrence
The vowel before the consonant is a short vowel (cf. A.3).
In the following sets of related words, the ﬁnal consonant is doubled when the
sufﬁx follows a stressed syllable, but not when it follows an unstressed syllable.
The contrasts illustrate the stress rule:
sufﬁx follows stressed syllable
sufﬁx follows unstressed syllable
deferred, deferring
deference
inferred, inferring
inference
preferred, preferring
preference
referred, referring
reference

Appendix: Spelling
251
A few polysyllabic words ending in -s have irregular variants with the doubling,
even though the ﬁnal syllable before the sufﬁx is unstressed; for example: biased,
biassed; focusing, focussing.
Do not double the ﬁnal consonant before a sufﬁx:
1.
if the word ends in two consonants:
ﬁnding, lifted, recorded, resistance, oldest
2.
if there are two vowels:
meeting, rained, beaten, trainer, repeated, appearance
3.
if the stress is not on the last syllable of the word to which the sufﬁx is added:
limit – limiting; deliver – delivered; differ – difference
Exceptions for words of two or more syllables:
(a)
Some words, most of them ending in l, have a double consonant even though
the ﬁnal syllable is not stressed; for example, marvellous, modelling, traveller,
quarrelled, worshipping, handicapped, diagrammed.
(b)
Final c is usually spelled ck when a sufﬁx is added to indicate the k sound:
mimic – mimicking; panic – panicky; picnic – picnicked; trafﬁc – trafﬁcked.
2.
dropping of ﬁnal -e before sufﬁx
Drop the ﬁnal silent -e before a sufﬁx beginning with a vowel:
have + ing → having
explore + ation → exploration
debate + ed → debated
cure + able
→ curable
fame + ous → famous
refuse + al
→ refusal
Exception where the e is kept before a vowel:
1.
Keep the e in dyeing (from dye) and singeing (from singe) to distinguish the
words from dying (from die) and singing (from sing).
2.
Keep the e in ce and ge before a sufﬁx beginning with a or o to preserve the s
and j sounds: enforceable, noticeable, peaceable, traceable, advantageous, courage-
ous, knowledgeable.
Do not drop the e before a sufﬁx beginning with a consonant:
movement, forceful, hopeless, strangely
Exceptions where the e is dropped before a consonant:
argue → argument
awe
→ awful
due
→ duly
true
→ truly
whole → wholly

252
An Introduction to English Grammar
The words abridgment, acknowledgment, and judgment have more common variants
in which the e is retained.
3.
change of -y to -i before sufﬁx
When a word ends in a consonant plus y, change the y to i before any sufﬁx except
-ing or ’s:
happy + ly
→ happily
study + es
→ studies
amplify + er → ampliﬁer
mystery + ous → mysterious
beauty + ful → beautiful
ratify + cation → ratiﬁcation
apply + ed
→ applied
empty + ness → emptiness
Exceptions where the y after a consonant is kept:
1.
A few words of one syllable keep the y before a sufﬁx: dryness, shyness, slyness.
2.
The y is kept in busyness to distinguish it from business.
Keep the y before -ing: studying, applying
Keep the y before ’s: the spy’s name, July’s weather
Keep the y in most words that end in a vowel + y:
employ + er → employer
play + ful
→ playful
annoy + ance → annoyance
destroy + s → destroys
spray + ed
→ sprayed
pay + ment → payment
Exceptions where the y after a vowel is changed to i: daily, laid, paid, said, slain.
4.
plurals of nouns and -s forms of verbs
Similar rules apply for making the plurals of regular nouns and the -s forms of
regular verbs. Indeed, many words can be either nouns or verbs.
1.
General rule: add -s:
noun plurals
verb -s forms
street → streets
speak → speaks
eye
→ eyes
bring → brings
winter → winters
write → writes
2.
If the ending is pronounced as a separate syllable (like the sound in is), add -es:
noun plurals
verb -s forms
church → churches
touch → touches
box
→ boxes
buzz → buzzes
bush
→ bushes
wash → washes

Appendix: Spelling
253
When the word already ends in an -e, add just -s:
noun plurals
verb -s forms
base → bases
curse → curses
judge → judges
trace → traces
3.
If the word ends in a consonant plus y, change y to i and then add -es:
noun plurals
verb -s forms
worry → worries
carry → carries
spy
→ spies
dry
→ dries
4.
For some words ending in -o, add -es. Some of them have a less common
variant in -s:
noun plurals
noun plurals and verb -s forms
archipelago → archipelagoes
echo
→ echoes
buffalo
→buffaloes
embargo → embargoes
cargo
→cargoes
go
→ goes
hero
→heroes
torpedo → torpedoes
motto
→mottoes
veto
→ vetoes
potato
→potatoes
tomato
→tomatoes
tornado
→tornadoes
volcano
→volcanoes
5.
For some nouns ending in -f or -fe, form the plural by changing the -f or -fe
to -ves:
calf
→ calves
life
→ lives
thief → thieves
elf
→ elves
loaf
→ loaves
wife → wives
half → halves
self
→ selves
wolf → wolves
knife → knives
sheaf → sheaves
leaf
→ leaves
shelf → shelves
5.
verb forms: -ing participles
The rules for making the -ing participle apply to both regular and irregular verbs.
1.
General rule: add -ing:
play → playing
carry → carrying
go
→ going
wash → washing
2.
If the word ends in -e, drop the e before the -ing:
lose → losing
write → writing
save → saving
judge → judging

254
An Introduction to English Grammar
But if the word ends in -ee, -ye, or -oe, keep the e:
see
→ seeing
dye → dyeing
agree → agreeing
hoe → hoeing
Also, singe keeps the e in singeing, in contrast with sing – singing.
3.
If the word ends in -ie, change i to y and drop the e before the -ing:
die → dying
tie → tying
lie → lying
Contrast die – dying with dye – dyeing.
4.
The rules for doubling a single consonant before -ing are given in A.4 (1):
beg
→ begging
boat → boating
prefer → preferring
enter → entering
6.
verb forms: simple past and -ed participles
The simple past and -ed participle are the same in regular verbs. The following
spelling rules, analogous to those in A.4(5), apply to regular verbs.
(a)
General rule: add -ed:
play → played
load → loaded
mail → mailed
echo → echoed
(b)
If the word ends in -e, add just -d:
save → saved
note → noted
agree → agreed
tie
→ tied
(c)
If the word ends in a consonant plus y, change the y to i before the -ed:
dry → dried
apply → applied
cry → cried
imply → implied
There are three exceptions, where the y is changed to i after a vowel and just
d is added:
lay → laid
pay → paid
say → said
(d)
The rules for doubling a single consonant before -ed are given in A.4(1):
beg
→ begged
boat → boated
prefer → preferred
enter → entered
7.
-ize or -ise; -ization or -isation
Both variants are acceptable, though the spelling with -s is perhaps more common
in British English:

Appendix: Spelling
255
criticise
criticize
colonisation
colonization
The following words, and words formed from them, should be spelled with -ise:
advertise
comprise
enterprise
revise
advise
compromise
exercise
supervise
analyse
despise
franchise
surmise
arise
devise
improvise
surprise
chastise
disguise
merchandise
televise
8.
addition of -ally to adjectives ending in -ic to form adverbs
Add -ally to adjectives ending in -ic to form the corresponding adverbs. In normal
conversation, the -al of -ally is not sounded:
basic
→ basically
realistic → realistically
emphatic → emphatically
speciﬁc → speciﬁcally
Exception: public → publicly.
9.
the sufﬁx -ful
The sufﬁx is -ful (not -full):
beautiful
successful
useful
hopeful
teaspoonful
wonderful
Notice also the usual spellings of fulﬁl and fulﬁlment.
A.5
Preﬁxes
Do not add or subtract letters when you add a preﬁx:
un + easy
→uneasy
un + necessary →unnecessary
dis + obey
→disobey
dis + satisﬁed
→dissatiﬁed
mis + inform
→misinform
mis + spell
→misspell
over + eat
→overeat
over + rule
→overrule
under + take
→undertake
in + expensive →inexpensive
in + numerable →innumerable

256
An Introduction to English Grammar
The preﬁx in- is regularly changed to il-, im-, or ir- according to the ﬁrst letter
of the word that it is added to. The preﬁx often means ‘not’, as in the examples
that follow:
il- before l
ir- before r
im- before m or p
illegal
irrational
immoral
illegible
irregular
immortal
illegitimate
irrefutable
impartial
illiterate
irrelevant
impossible
illogical
irresponsible
impure
A.6
Other aids to spelling
1.
words run together
A common type of spelling error is to run words together by writing two words as
one. Always write these phrases as separate words:
a lot
even if
in fact
no one
all right
even though
just as
of course
In some cases the spelling depends on the meaning. For example, write nobody
as one word when it is a synonym of no person, but write no body as two words in
other meanings (for example, ‘no corpse’). Write anyway when it is a synonym of
anyhow, but any way when it means ‘any direction’ or ‘any manner’; awhile is an
adverb meaning ‘for a brief period’ (e.g. You can stay awhile), but a while is a noun
phrase (always so when preceded by a preposition), meaning ‘a period of time’ (e.g.
We’ll be there in a (little) while and We haven’t seen them for a (long) while).
Here are some pairs that you write either as one or as two words, depending on
the meaning you intend:
one word
two words
already
all ready
altogether
all together
always
all ways
anybody
any body
anyway
any way
awhile
a while
everyone
every one
everybody
every body
into
in to
maybe
may be
nobody
no body
someone
some one

Appendix: Spelling
257
somebody
some body
whoever
who ever
2.
ie or ei
When the sound of the vowel is as in brief, spell it ie; but after c, spell it ei:
ie
ei after c
brief
thief
ceiling
deceit
belief
achieve
conceive
perceive
believe
ﬁeld
conceit
receive
diesel
niece
deceive
receipt
relief
priest
relieve
siege
Exceptions for spelling ei:
either, neither, seize, weird
Exceptions for spelling ie:
1.
ﬁnancier, species
2.
Words in which y has changed to i (cf. A.4 (3)) end in ies even after c:
prophecies, democracies
In most words that do not have the pronunciations as in brief, the usual order is e
before i: neighbour, weigh, reign, leisure. The most common exception is friend.
3.
-cede, -ceed, -sede
The most common spelling is -cede:
antecede, concede, precede, recede, secede
We ﬁnd -ceed in three words:
exceed, proceed, succeed
We ﬁnd -sede in just one word:
supersede
A.7
Homophones: Words pronounced similarly
Homophones are words that are pronounced similarly but have different meanings
and spellings. Because they sound very alike, writers frequently fail to distinguish

258
An Introduction to English Grammar
between their different spellings. In this section we disambiguate the most com-
mon of these.
1.
accept/except
Accept is a verb: ‘I’ve decided to accept his offer.’

‘The migration of peoples has effected enormous social change in Europe.’
4.
choose/chose
Both are forms of the verb choose. Choose is the base form (cf. 4.13): ‘It’s
difﬁcult to choose from this menu.’ ‘Choose your partner carefully.’ Chose is the
past tense form: ‘Last summer we chose a hotel with a sea view.’ The -ed form
of the verb choose is chosen.
5.
he’s/his
He’s is a contraction of he is or he has:
He’ll tell you when he’s back home. (= he is)
I know that he’s sent the cheque. (= he has)
His is a possessive pronoun (cf. 5.19):

6.
it’s/its
It’s is a contraction of it is or it has:
It’s in the kitchen. (= It is)

Quiet is an adjective: ‘A quiet person’; ‘Please be quiet’.
Quite is an intensiﬁer (cf. 5.14) which is used to modify an adjective: ‘It’s quite
warm today’ or an adverb ‘The money ran out quite quickly’.
8.
than/then
Than is used in comparative constructions (cf. 5.14): ‘David is older than
Paul.’
‘The ticket was more expensive than I expected.’
Then is an adverb expressing time: ‘First we went to Pisa and then we went to
Rome.’ As a sentence connector, then means ‘in that case’:
A:
I’ve lost my passport.
B:
Then you’ll just have to stay at home.
9.
they’re/their/there
They’re is a contraction of they are:
I wonder where they’re staying. (= they are)
Their is a possessive pronoun (cf. 5.19):

See also Section 6.11, There-structures.
10.
to/too
To is used to introduce the inﬁnitive of a verb: to walk, to eat, to smile.
To is also used as a preposition to introduce noun phrases: ‘I’m going to bed’;

to get married’ or an adverb ‘It all happened too quickly’.
11.
who’s/whose
Who’s is a contraction of who is or who has:

Glossary

Glossary
absolute clause
An absolute clause is an adverbial clause that either has a non-ﬁnite verb (as in 1
below) or no verb at all (as in 2 below) but has its own subject:
1.
The work having been ﬁnished, the gardener came to ask for payment.
2.
The prisoners marched past, their hands above their heads.
active
Sentences and verb phrases with transitive verbs are either active or passive. The
active is more commonly used. The passive involves differences in the structure of
the verb phrase: the passive verb phrase has the addition of a form of the verb be,
which is followed by an -ed participle:
active
loves
passive
is loved
will proclaim
will be proclaimed
is investigating
is being investigated
The passive sentence differs from the corresponding active sentence in that the
active subject corresponds to the passive object:
active
The police (S) are investigating the crime (O).
passive
The crime (S) is being investigated.
If the active subject (here The police) is retained in the passive sentence it is put
into a by-phrase:
The crime is being investigated by the police.
adjective
An adjective is a word that typically can modify a noun and usually can itself be
modiﬁed by very; for example, (very) wise, (very) careful. Adjectives are called
‘attributive’ when they are used as pre-modiﬁer in a noun phrase (a conscientious
student). They are called ‘predicative’ when they are used as subject complement

268
An Introduction to English Grammar
(She is conscientious) or object complement (I considered her conscientious). Adjec-
tives that can be used both attributively and predicatively are ‘central adjectives’.
adjective phrase
The main word in an adjective phrase is an adjective. Other constituents that often
appear in the phrase are pre-modiﬁers (which come before the adjective) and post-
modiﬁers (which come after the adjective):
quite (premod.) hungry (adj.)
very (premod.) happy (adj.) to see you (post-mod.)
adverb
An adverb is a word that is used chieﬂy as a modiﬁer of an adjective (extremely in
extremely pale), or a modiﬁer of another adverb (very in very suddenly), or as an
adverbial ( frequently in I visit my family frequently).
adverb phrase
The main word in an adverb phrase is an adverb. Other constituents that often
appear in the phrase are pre-modiﬁers (which come before the adverb) and post-
modiﬁers (which come after the adverb):
quite (pre-mod.) neatly (adv.)
very (pre-mod.) luckily (adv.) for me (post-mod.)
adverbial
An adverbial is an optional element that is chieﬂy used to convey information
about the circumstances of the situation depicted in the basic structure of the
sentence. There may be more than one adverbial in a sentence:
Every year (A1) they rented a car for two weeks (A2) to tour some European
country (A3).
In the above sentence, the adverbials convey information on frequency in time
(A1), duration of time (A2), and purpose (A3).
We should distinguish the adverbial from the adverb. Like a noun, an adverb is
a member of a word class.
An adverbial complement is an element that conveys the same information as
some adverbials but is required by the verb:
I am now living in Manhattan.
The verb that most commonly requires an adverbial complement to complete the
sentence is the verb be, as in ‘She is on the way to New Zealand’. An adverbial

Glossary
269
complement (aC) is also required by some transitive verbs to follow a direct object
(dO). See Object:
I put my car (dO) in the garage (aC).
adverbial clause
An adverbial clause is a clause that functions as adverbial in sentence structure.
adverbial complement
An adverbial complement is an obligatory element in sentence structure. See
Adverbial.
alternative question
An alternative question is a question that presents two or more choices and asks
the hearer to choose one of them:
Do you want a biscuit or (do you want) a piece of cake?
antecedent
The antecedent of a pronoun is the unit that the pronoun refers to. The antecedent
usually comes before the pronoun:
The brakes were defective when I examined them.
anticipatory it
The pronoun it is called ‘anticipatory it’ when the sentence is so structured that
the pronoun takes the position of the subject and the subject is moved to the end:
It is a pity that Sue is not here. (Cf. ‘That Sue is not here is a pity.’)
It’s good to see you. (Cf. ‘To see you is good.’)
apposition
Apposition is a type of relation between two or more units:
Peter, your youngest brother, has just arrived.
Typically, the two units are identical in the kind of unit (here two noun phrases),
in what they refer to (Peter and your youngest brother refer to the same person), and
in having the same potential function, so that either can be omitted (Peter has just
arrived and Your youngest brother has just arrived are both acceptable). See also
Appositive clause.

270
An Introduction to English Grammar
appositive clause
An appositive clause is a type of clause that functions as a post-modiﬁer in a noun
phrase:
the reason that I am here today
The conjunction that does not function in the clause (cf. Relative clause). Since
the clause is in apposition to the noun phrase, the two units correspond to a
sentence structure in which they are linked by a form of the verb be:
The reason is that I am here today.
aspect
Aspect is the grammatical category in the verb phrase that refers to the way that
the time of the situation is viewed by the speaker. There are two aspects: perfect
and progressive. The perfect combines a form of auxiliary have with the -ed
participle: has shouted, had worked, may have said. The progressive combines a
form of auxiliary be with the -ing participle: is shouting, was working, may be saying.
auxiliary
Auxiliary (‘helping’) verbs typically come before the main verb (see in the follow-
ing examples) in a verb phrase: can see, has been seeing, should have been seen. The
auxiliaries are:
1.
modals: e.g. can, could, may, might, should, will, would
2.
perfect auxiliary: have
3.
progressive auxiliary: be
4.
passive auxiliary: be
5.
dummy operator: do
base form
The base form of the verb is the form without any inﬂection. It is the entry word
for a verb in dictionaries.
basic sentence structure
The seven basic sentence or clause structures are:
SV:
subject + verb
SVA:
subject + verb + adverbial (complement)
SVC:
subject + verb + (subject) complement
SVO:
subject + verb + (direct) object
SVOO:
subject + verb + (indirect) object + (direct) object
SVOA:
subject + verb + (direct) object + adverbial (complement)
SVOC:
subject + verb + (direct) object + (object) complement

Glossary
271
See 3.13. One or more optional adverbials may be added to the basic structures.
case
Case is a distinction in nouns and pronouns that is related to their grammatical
functions. Nouns have two cases: the common case (child, children) and the genitive
case (child’s, children’s). The genitive noun phrase is generally equivalent to an
of-phrase:
the child’s parents
the parents of the child
In the child’s parents, the genitive phrase is a dependent genitive: it functions like a
determiner. When the phrase is not dependent on a following noun, it is an
independent genitive:
The party is at Susan’s.
Personal pronouns and the pronoun who have three cases: subjective (e.g. I,
we, who), objective (e.g. me, us, whom), and genitive (e.g. my, mine, our, ours, whose).
The two genitive forms of the personal pronouns have different functions: My is
a possessive determiner in my parents, and mine is a possessive pronoun in Those
are mine.
The distinctions in case are neutralized in some personal pronouns. For example,
you may be either subjective or objective. See Subjective case.
chiasmus See Parallelism.
clause
A clause is a sentence or sentence-like construction that is contained within another
sentence. Constructions that are sentence-like are non-ﬁnite clauses or verbless
clauses. Non-ﬁnite clauses have a non-ﬁnite verb phrase as their verb, whereas
verbless clauses do not have a verb at all. They are like sentences because they have
sentence elements such as subject and direct object.
We can parallel the non-ﬁnite clause in [1] with the ﬁnite clause in [1a]:
[1]
Being just a student, I’d . . .
[1a]
Since I’m just a student, I’d . . .
We can show similar parallels between the verbless clause in [2] and the ﬁnite
clause in [2a]:
[2]
Though fearful of the road conditions, they . . .
[2a]
Though they were fearful of the road conditions, they . . .

272
An Introduction to English Grammar
In a wider sense, a clause may coincide with a sentence, since a simple sentence
consists of just one clause.
cleft sentence
A cleft sentence is a sentence divided into three parts. The ﬁrst has the subject it
and a form of the verb be; the emphasized part comes next; and the ﬁnal part is
what would be the rest of the sentence in a regular pattern.
It was Betty that I wanted to see. (cf. ‘I wanted to see Betty.’)
It was after lunch that I phoned John. (cf. ‘I phoned John after lunch.’)
collective noun
A collective noun refers to a group, e.g. audience, class, family, herd, jury.
comma splice See Run-on sentence.
comparative clause
Comparative clauses are introduced by than or as and involve a comparison.
Adam is happier than he used to be.
Paul is as good a student as you are.
complement
A complement is the unit that may or must be introduced to complete the meaning
of a word. For example, a preposition (e.g. for) is normally followed by a noun
phrase (e.g. my best friend) as its complement, as in for my best friend. See Object,
Object complement, Subject complement.
complex sentence
A complex sentence is a sentence that contains one or more subordinate clauses.
The subordinate clause may function as a sentence element [1] or as a post-
modiﬁer in a phrase [2] and [3]:
[1]
Jean told me that she would be late.
[2]
This is the man who was asking for you.
[3]
We are glad that you could be here.
compound
A compound is a word formed from the combination of two words: handmade,
user-friendly.
compound sentence
A compound sentence is a sentence that consists of two or more clauses linked by
a coordinator. The coordinators are and, or, and but:

Glossary
273
She is a superb administrator and everybody knows it.
We can go in my car or we can take a bus.
He felt quite ill but he refused to leave his post.
See 6.6.
conditional clause
A conditional clause is a clause that expresses a condition on which something else
is dependent:
If they hurry, they can catch the earlier ﬂight.
The sentence conveys the proposition that their ability to catch the earlier ﬂight is
dependent on their hurrying.
conjunction
The two classes of conjunctions are coordinators (or coordinating conjunctions)
and subordinators (or subordinating conjunctions). The coordinators are and, or,
and but. They link units of equal status (those having a similar function), e.g.
clauses, phrases, pre-modiﬁers. Subordinators (e.g. because, if ) introduce subordin-
ate clauses:
The baby is crying because she is hungry.
conversion
Conversion is the process by which a word is changed from one class to a new class
without any change in its form. For example, the verb bottle (‘put into a bottle’) is
derived by conversion from the noun bottle.
coordination
Coordination is the linking of two or more units with the same function. The
coordinators (or coordinating conjunctions) are and, or, and but:
There is a heavy duty on cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco.
They pierced their ears or noses.
We waited, but nobody came.
coordinator See Conjunction.
count noun
Count nouns refer to things that can be counted, and they therefore have a singular
and a plural: college, colleges. Non-count nouns have only the singular form: informa-
tion, software.

274
An Introduction to English Grammar
dangling modiﬁer
A dangling modiﬁer is an adverbial clause that has no subject, but its implied
subject is not intended to be identiﬁed with the subject of the sentence:
Being blind, a dog guided her across the street.
The implied subject of being blind is not intended to be a dog.
declarative
A declarative sentence is a type of sentence structure used chieﬂy for making
statements. In declaratives, the subject generally comes before the verb.
Sandra is on the radio.
I’m not joking.
I’ll send you an email.
Much more work will be required to analyse the data before we can
announce our conclusions.
declarative question
A declarative question has the form of a declarative sentence but the force of a
question:
She agrees with us?
deﬁnite
Noun phrases are deﬁnite when they are intended to convey enough information,
in themselves or through the context, to identify uniquely what they refer to:
You’ll ﬁnd the beer in the refrigerator.
A likely context for using the deﬁnite article here is that this beer has been
mentioned previously and that it is obvious which refrigerator is being referred to.
Noun phrases are indeﬁnite when they are not intended to be so identiﬁable:
You’ll ﬁnd a beer in the refrigerator .
deﬁnite article
The deﬁnite article is the. Contrast Indeﬁnite article.
demonstrative
The demonstrative pronouns are this, these, that, those. The same forms are
demonstrative determiners.
dependent genitive See Case.

Glossary
275
descriptive rules See Grammar.
determiner
Determiners introduce noun phrases. They fall into several classes: the deﬁnite
and indeﬁnite articles, demonstratives, possessives, interrogatives, rela-
tives, indeﬁnites.
directive
The major use of imperative sentences is to issue directives, that is, requests for
action. Directives include a simple request [1], a command [2], a prohibition [3], a
warning [4], and an offer [5]:
[1]
Please send me another copy.
[2]
Put your hands up!
[3]
Don’t move!
[4]
Look out!
[5]
Have another piece of cake.
You can convey a directive through sentence types other than imperatives:
I want you to send me another copy, please.
Would you please send me another copy?
I need another copy.
direct object See Object.
direct speech
Direct speech quotes the actual words that somebody has said. Indirect speech
reports what has been said but not in the actual words used by the speaker:
[1]
Judith asked me, ‘Have you any friends?’ (direct speech)
[2]
Judith asked me whether I had any friends. (indirect speech)
In both [1] and [2], Judith asked me is the reporting clause.
discourse particle
The term ‘discourse particle’ is applied to items such as I mean, you know, you see,
and well. Discourse particles are very common in speech, where they perform a
range of functions, including signalling a change of topic.
dummy operator
The dummy operator is the verb do. It is used to perform the functions of an
operator when an operator is otherwise absent:

276
An Introduction to English Grammar
Does (op) Paul know?
The three verb forms are do and does for the present tense and did for the past
tense.
dynamic See Stative.
element
A sentence or clause element is a constituent of sentence or clause structure. Seven
elements combine to form the basic sentence structure:
subject
S
verb
V
object
O
direct object
dO
indirect object
iO
complement
C
subject complement
sC
object complement
oC
adverbial complement
aC
In addition, the adverbial (A) is an optional element.
end-focus
The principle of end-focus requires that the most important information come at
the end of a sentence or clause.
end-weight
The principle of end-weight requires that a longer unit come after a shorter unit
whenever there is a choice of relative positions.
exclamative
An exclamative sentence is a type of sentence structure used chieﬂy to express
strong feeling. Exclamatives begin with what or how. What is used with a noun
phrase and how elsewhere:
What a great time we had! (‘We had a great time.’)
How well she plays! (‘She plays well.’)
ﬁnite
Finite is a term used in contrast with non-ﬁnite in the classiﬁcation of verbs, verb
phrases, and clauses. A ﬁnite verb allows contrasts in tense and mood. All verb
forms are ﬁnite except inﬁnitives and participles. A verb phrase is ﬁnite if the
ﬁrst or only verb is ﬁnite; all the other verbs are non-ﬁnite. A ﬁnite clause is a
clause whose verb is a ﬁnite verb phrase:

Glossary
277
[1]
Marian has been working hard.
A ﬁnite clause can constitute an independent sentence, as in [1]. Contrast the non-
ﬁnite clause in to work hard in [2]:
[2]
Daniel was reluctant to work hard.
foregrounding
Foregrounding refers to the features that stand out in language, especially in
literary language.
formal deﬁnition
A formal deﬁnition deﬁnes a grammatical term, such as adverb, by the form of
members of the category. For example, most adverbs end in -ly. In a wider sense,
form includes structure. The form or structure of a noun phrase may be described
as consisting of a noun or pronoun as the main word plus other possible constitu-
ents, such as determiners and modiﬁers. See Structure. Formal deﬁnitions are
contrasted with notional deﬁnitions.
fragmentary sentence
Fragmentary sentences are irregular sentences from which some part or parts are
missing that are normally present in corresponding regular sentences. We can
‘regularize’ the fragmentary sentence in the kitchen in this exchange:
A:
Where are you?
B:
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen corresponds to the regular sentence I am in the kitchen.
front-focus
Front-focus is a device for fronting an expression from its normal position so that
it will acquire greater prominence:
Ronald I like, but Doris I respect.
Here the two direct objects have been fronted from their normal position after
the verb.
function
The function of a unit refers to its use within another unit. For example, the
function of your sister is subject in [1] and object in [2]:
[1]
Your sister is over there.
[2]
I have already met your sister.

278
An Introduction to English Grammar
gender
Gender is a grammatical distinction among words of the same word class that
refers to contrasts such as masculine, feminine, neuter. In English this distinction
is found mainly in certain pronouns and in the possessive determiners.
generic
Noun phrases are generic when they refer to a class as a whole:
Dogs make good pets.
They are non-generic when they refer to individual members of a class:
My dogs are good with children.
genitive case See Case.
gradable
Words are gradable when they can be viewed as being on a scale of degree of
intensity. Adjectives and adverbs are typically gradable: they can be modiﬁed by
intensiﬁers such as very (extremely hot, very badly), and they can take comparison
(happier, more relevant).
grammar
The grammar is the set of rules for combining words into larger units. For
example, the rules for the grammar of standard English allow:
Home computers are now much cheaper.
They disallow:
[1]
Home computers now much are cheaper.
[2]
Home computers is now much cheaper.
They disallow [1] because much is positioned wrongly. They disallow [2] because
the subject and the verb must agree in number, and the subject Home computers is
plural whereas the verb is is singular.
Such rules are descriptive rules: they describe what speakers of the language
actually use. There are also prescriptive rules, which advise people what they
should use. These are found in style manuals, handbooks, and other books that
advise people how to use their language, telling people which usages to adopt or
avoid. The prescriptive rules refer to usages that are common among speakers of
standard English, perhaps mainly when they are speaking informally; for example:

Glossary
279
Don’t use like as a conjunction, as in Speak like I do.
grammatical sentence
A grammatical sentence in English is a sentence that conforms to the rules of the
grammar of standard English. In a wider sense, grammatical sentences are sen-
tences that conform to the rules of any variety, so that it is possible to distinguish
between grammatical and non-grammatical sentences in different varieties of
non-standard English.
homograph See Homonym.
homonym
Homonyms are two or more words that are identical in sound or spelling but
different in meaning: the verb peep refers either to making a kind of sound or to
taking a kind of look. Homophones share the same sound but not necessarily the
same spelling, e.g. weigh and way. Homographs share the same spelling but not
necessarily the same sound, e.g. row (‘line of objects’ when it rhymes with no, or
‘quarrel’ when it rhymes with now).
homophone See Homonym.
hypotaxis
Hypotaxis refers to the grammatical relationship between clauses based on coordina-
tion or subordination. Compare: Parataxis.
imperative
An imperative sentence is a type of sentence structure used chieﬂy for issuing a
directive. The imperative verb has the base form. The subject is generally absent,
and in that case the missing subject is understood to be you:
Take off your hat.
Make yourself at home.
There are also ﬁrst and third person imperative sentences with let and a subject:
Let’s go now.
Let no one move.
indeﬁnite article
The indeﬁnite article is a or (before a vowel sound) an. Compare: Deﬁnite article.
indeﬁnite pronoun
Indeﬁnite pronouns are pronouns that refer to the quantity of persons or things.
They include sets of words ending in -one and -body (someone, nobody, everybody),

280
An Introduction to English Grammar
many, few, both, either, neither, some, any. Some of these pronouns have the same
form as indeﬁnite determiners.
independent genitive See Case.
indicative See Mood.
indirect object See Object.
indirect speech See Direct speech.
inﬁnitive
The inﬁnitive has the base form of the verb. It is often preceded by to (to stay, to
knock), but the inﬁnitive without to is used after the central modals (may stay, will
knock) and after dummy operator do (did say).
inﬂection See Sufﬁx.
interrogative
An interrogative sentence is a type of sentence structure used chieﬂy for asking
questions. In interrogatives the operator comes before the subject or the sentence
begins with an interrogative word (e.g. who, how, why) or with an interrogative
expression (e.g. on which day, for how long):
Did you hear that noise?
Why is Pat so annoyed?
At which point should I stop?
interrogative pronoun
The interrogative pronouns are who, whom, which and what.
intransitive verb
An intransitive verb does not require another element to complete the sentence:
Peter yawned.
The baby laughed.
It has been raining.
Intransitive verbs contrast with transitive verbs, which take an object; for example,
the transitive verb take is followed by the object my book in this next sentence:
Somebody has taken my book.

Glossary
281
Many verbs may be either intransitive or transitive, for example play:
They were playing.
They were playing football.
irregular sentence See Regular sentence.
linking verb See Subject complement.
main clause
A simple sentence [1] or a complex sentence [2] consists of one main clause:
[1]
You should be more careful.
[2]
You should be more careful when you cross the street.
A compound sentence [3] consists of two or more main clauses:
[3]
I know that you are in a hurry, but you should be more careful when you
cross the street.
In [3], but joins the two main clauses.
main verb
A main verb is the main word in a verb phrase. Regular main verbs have four
forms: the base, -s, -ing, and -ed forms. The base form (e.g. talk) has no inﬂection;
the other three forms are named after their inﬂections (talks, talking, talked). Some
irregular verbs have ﬁve forms, two of them corresponding to the two uses of the
regular -ed form: past (spoke) and -ed participle (spoken); others have four forms,
but the -ed form is irregular (spent); others still have only three forms, since the
base and the -ed forms are identical (put). The highly irregular verb be has eight
different forms. See 4.12 and 5.11.
medium
The medium is the channel in which the language is used. The main distinction is
between speech and writing.
modal
The central modals (or central modal auxiliaries) are can, could, may, might, will,
would, shall, should, must.
mood
Mood is the grammatical category that indicates the attitude of the speaker to what
is said. Finite verb phrases have three moods: indicative, imperative, and subjunctive.

282
An Introduction to English Grammar
The indicative is the usual mood in declarative, interrogative, and exclamative
sentences. The imperative mood is used in imperative sentences. The subjunctive
mood commonly conveys uncertainty or tentativeness. See 4.19.
morphology
Morphology deals with the structure of words. Words may be combinations of
smaller units. For example, books consists of the stem book and the inﬂection -s.
Sometimes is a compound formed from the two stems some and times. Review con-
sists of the preﬁx re- and the stem view, and national consists of the stem nation
and the sufﬁx -al.
multiple sentence See Simple sentence.
multi-word verb
Multi-word verbs are combinations of a verb and one or more other words. The
major types are phrasal verbs (give in), prepositional verbs (look at), and phrasal-
prepositional verbs (put up with).
neutralization
Neutralization involves reducing distinctions to one form. For example, you rep-
resents both the subjective form (You saw them) and the objective form (They saw
you).
nominal clause
Nominal clauses are subordinate clauses that have a range of functions similar
to that of noun phrases. For example, they can function as subject [1] or direct
object [2]:
[1]
That it’s too difﬁcult for him should be obvious to everyone.
[2]
I think that you should take a rest now.
Nominal relative clauses are introduced by a nominal relative pronoun. The
pronoun functions like a combination of antecedent and relative pronoun:
You can take whatever you want. (‘anything you want’)
nominal relative clause See Nominal clause.
nominal relative pronoun
The nominal relative pronouns are who, whom (formal), which, whoever, whomever
(formal), whichever, what, and whatever. They introduce nominal relative clauses.
Several of these pronouns have the same form as nominal relative determiners.

non-ﬁnite See Finite.
non-generic See Generic.
non-restrictive apposition See Restrictive apposition.
non-restrictive relative clause. See Restrictive relative clause.
non-sentence
A non-sentence may be perfectly normal even though it cannot be analysed as a
sentence, For example, the greeting Hello! is a non-sentence grammatically, and so
is the written sign Exit.
non-speciﬁc See Speciﬁc.
non-standard English See Standard English.
notional deﬁnition
A notional deﬁnition deﬁnes a grammatical term, such as a noun, by the meaning
that members of the category are said to convey. For example, a traditional notional
deﬁnition of a noun is ‘the name of a person, thing, or place’. Notional deﬁnitions
can help to identify a category such as a noun by indicating typical members of the
category, but the deﬁnitions are usually not comprehensive. Nouns include words
such as happiness, information, and action that are not covered by the traditional
notional deﬁnition. Notional deﬁnitions are contrasted with formal deﬁnitions.
noun
Proper nouns are names of people (Helen), places (Hong Kong), days of the week
(Monday), holidays (Christmas), etc. The noun phrases in which common nouns
function refer to people (teachers), places (the city), things ( your car), qualities
(elegance), states (knowledge), actions (action), etc. Most common nouns take a
plural form: car, cars.
noun phrase
The main word in a noun phrase is a noun or a pronoun. If the main word is a
noun, it is often introduced by a determiner and may have modiﬁers. Pre-
modiﬁers are modiﬁers that come before the main word and post-modiﬁers are
modiﬁers that come after it:
an (det.) old (premod.) quarrel (noun) that has recently ﬂared up again
(post-mod.)

284
An Introduction to English Grammar
number
Number is a grammatical category that contrasts singular and plural. It applies to
nouns (student, students), pronouns (she, they), and verbs (he works, they work).
object
Transitive verbs require a direct object to complete the sentence as in [1]:
[1]
Helen wore a red dress (dO).
Some transitive verbs allow or require a second element: indirect object, which
comes before the direct object [2]; object complement [3]; adverbial comple-
ment [4].
[2]
Nancy showed me (iO) her book (dO).
[3]
Pauline made him (dO) her understudy (oC).
[4]
Norma put the cat (dO) in the yard (aC).
The direct object typically refers to the person or thing affected by the action. The
indirect object typically refers to the person who receives something or beneﬁts
from the action. The object in an active structure (whether the object is direct or
indirect) usually corresponds to the subject in a passive structure:
The sentry ﬁred two shots (dO).
Two shots (S) were ﬁred.
Ted promised Mary (iO) two tickets (dO).
Mary (S) was promised two tickets.
Two tickets (S) were promised to Mary.
object complement
Some transitive verbs require or allow an object complement to follow the direct
object:
The heat has turned the milk (dO) sour (oC).
The relationship between the direct object and the object complement resembles
that between the subject and subject complement:
The milk (S) turned sour (sC).
See Object.
objective case See Subjective case.

Glossary
285
operator
The operator is the part of the predicate that (among other functions) interchanges
with the subject when we form questions [1] and comes before not or contracted n’t
in negative sentences [2] and [3]:
[1]
Have (op) you (S) seen my pen?
[2]
I have (op) not replied to her letter.
[3]
I haven’t replied to her letter.
The operator is usually the ﬁrst auxiliary in the verb phrase, but the main verb be
is the operator when it is the only verb in the verb phrase, as in [4], while the main
verb have may serve as operator, as in [5], or take the dummy operator, as in [6]:
[4]
Are you ready?
[5]
Have you a car?
[6]
Do you have a car?
orthographic sentence
An orthographic sentence is a sentence in the written language, signalled by an
initial capital letter and a ﬁnal full-stop (period).
orthography
Orthography is the writing system in the language: the distinctive written symbols
and their possible combinations.
parallelism
Parallelism is an arrangement of similar grammatical structures. In parallel struc-
tures at least some of the words have similar or contrasting meanings:
It was too hot to eat; it was too hot to swim; it was too hot to sleep.
They tended the wounded and they comforted the dying.
The more you talk, the madder I get.
Chiasmus is a form of parallelism in which the order of parts of the structures is
reversed:
I respect Susan, but Joan I admire.
parataxis
Parataxis refers to the loose ‘stringing together’ of (usually) clauses, without any
grammatical relation between them: It was midnight. It was dark. The door opened.
Compare: Hypotaxis.

286
An Introduction to English Grammar
particle
A particle is a word that does not change its form (unlike verbs that have past
forms or nouns that have plural forms) and, because of its specialized functions,
does not ﬁt into the traditional classes of words. Particles include not, to as used
with the inﬁnitive, and words like up and out that combine with verbs to form
multi-word verbs, for example, blow up and look out.
participle
There are two participles, the -ing participle (playing) and the -ed participle. The
-ing participle always ends in -ing. In all regular verbs and in some irregular verbs,
the -ed participle ends in -ed. In other irregular verbs the -ed participle may end in
-n (speak – spoken), or may have a different vowel from the base form ( ﬁght –
fought), or may have both characteristics (wear – worn), or may be identical with
the base form ( put – put).
The -ing participle is used to form the progressive (was playing). The -ed
participle is used to form the perfect (has played) and the passive (was played).
Both participles can function as the verb in non-ﬁnite clauses:
Speaking before the game, Keegan was upbeat and optimistic.
When captured, he refused to give his name.
See Aspect, Active, Finite.
passive See Active.
perfect See Aspect.
person
Person is the grammatical category that indicates differences in the relationship to
the speaker of those involved in the situation. There are three persons: the ﬁrst
person refers to the speaker, the second to those addressed, and the third to other
people or things. Differences are signalled by the possessive determiners (my,
your etc.), some pronouns (e.g. I, you), and by verb forms (e.g. I know versus She
knows).
personal pronoun
The personal pronouns are:
1.
subjective case: I, we, you, he, she, it, they
2.
objective case: me, us, you, him, her, it, them
See Subjective case.

Glossary
287
phonetics
Phonetics deals with the physical characteristics of the sounds in the language,
their production, and their perception.
phonology
Phonology is the sound system in the language: the distinctive sound units and the
ways in which they may be combined.
phrasal auxiliary
Phrasal auxiliaries convey meanings that are similar to the auxiliaries but do not
share all their grammatical characteristics. For example, only the ﬁrst word of the
phrasal auxiliary have got to functions as an operator:
Have we got to go now?
Phrasal auxiliaries include have to, had better, be about to, be going to, be able to.
phrasal-prepositional verb See Multi-word verb.
phrasal verb. See Multi-word verb.
phrase
A phrase is a unit below the clause. There are ﬁve types of phrases:
noun phrase
our family
verb phrase
was talking
adjective phrase
quite old
adverb phrase
very loudly
prepositional phrase
on the table
The ﬁrst four phrases above are named after their main word. The prepositional
phrase is named after the word that introduces the phrase. In this book, and in
many other works on grammar, a phrase may consist of one word, so that both
talked and was talking are verb phrases. See 4.1.
possessive determiner
The possessive determiners are my, our, your, his, her, its, their. See Case.
possessive pronoun
The possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, theirs. See Case.

288
An Introduction to English Grammar
pragmatics
Pragmatics deals with the use of utterances in particular situations. For example,
Will you join our group? is a question that might be intended as either a request for
information or a request for action.
predicate
We can divide most clauses into two parts; the subject and the predicate. The
main parts of the predicate are the verb and any of its objects or complements.
preﬁx
A preﬁx is added before the stem of a word to form a new word, e.g. un- in untidy.
preposition
Prepositions introduce prepositional phrases. The preposition links the com-
plement in the phrase to some other expression. Here are some common preposi-
tions with complements in parentheses: after (lunch), by (telling me), for (us), in (my
room), since (seeing them), to (Ruth), up (the road).
prepositional object
A prepositional object is a word or phrase that follows the preposition of a preposi-
tional verb:
Tom is looking after my children.
Norma is making fun of you.
prepositional phrase
The prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and the complement of the
preposition:
for (prep.) your sake (comp.)
on (prep.) entering the room (comp.)
prepositional verb See Multi-word verb.
prescriptive rules See Grammar.
progressive See Aspect.
pronoun
A pronoun is a closed class of words that are used as substitutes for a noun phrase
or (less commonly) for a noun. They fall into a number of classes, such as personal
pronouns and demonstrative pronouns. See 5.17.

Glossary
289
reciprocal pronoun
The reciprocal pronouns are each other and one another.
reﬂexive pronoun
The reﬂexive pronouns are myself, ourselves, yourself, yourselves, himself, herself,
itself, themselves.
register
A linguistic register is a variety of language that we associate with a speciﬁc use and
communicative purpose. For example, conversational English, newspaper English,
and scientiﬁc English are commonly recognized registers.
regular sentence
A regular sentence conforms to one of the major sentence patterns in the language
(see 3.13). Those that do not conform are irregular sentences. See Basic sentence
structure.
relative clause
A relative clause functions as a post-modiﬁer in a noun phrase:
the persons who advised me
The relative word or expression (here who) functions as an element in the clause
(here as the subject; cf. They advised me).
relative pronoun
Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses. The relative pronouns are who,
whom (formal), which, and that. The relative pronoun is omitted in certain circum-
stances: the apartment (that) I live in. The omitted pronoun is known as a zero
relative pronoun. Which and whose are relative determiners.
reporting clause See Direct speech.
restrictive apposition
Apposition may be restrictive or non-restrictive. A restrictive appositive identiﬁes:
the fact that they have two cars
my sister Joan
A non-restrictive appositive adds further information:
the latest news, that negotiations are to begin next Monday . . .
my eldest sister, Joan . . .

290
An Introduction to English Grammar
See Restrictive relative clause:
restrictive relative clause
Relative clauses may be either restrictive or non-restrictive. A restrictive relative
clause identiﬁes more closely the noun it modiﬁes:
The boy who got the top grade was given a prize.
A non-restrictive relative clause does not identify. It adds further information:
The boy, who got the top grade, was given a prize.
rhetorical question
A rhetorical question has the form of a question but the force of a strong assertion.
How many times have I told you to wipe your feet? (‘I have told you very
many times to wipe your feet.’)
run-on sentence
A run-on sentence is an error in punctuation arising from the failure to use any
punctuation mark between sentences. If a comma is used instead of a major mark,
the error is a comma splice. See 9.3.
semantics
Semantics is the system of meanings in the language: the meanings of words and
the combinatory meanings of larger units.
sentence fragment
A sentence fragment is a series of words that is punctuated as a sentence even
though it is not grammatically an independent sentence:
You’re late again. As usual.
simple sentence
A simple sentence is a sentence that consists of one clause:
I’m just a student.
A multiple sentence consists of more than one clause:
I’m just a student, and I’ve not had much work experience.
Since I’m just a student, I’ve not had much work experience.

Glossary
291
See Complex sentence and Compound sentence.
speciﬁc
Noun phrases are speciﬁc when they refer to speciﬁc persons, places, things, etc.:
I hired a horse and a guide.
They are non-speciﬁc when they do not have such reference:
I have never met a Russian. (non-speciﬁc: ‘any Russian’)
standard English
Standard English is the variety of English that normally appears in print. Its
relative uniformity is conﬁned to grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and punctuation.
There is no standard English pronunciation. There are some differences in the
standard English used in English-speaking countries, so that we can distinguish,
for example, between standard English in Britain, in the USA, and in Canada.
Varieties other than the standard variety are called non-standard.
stative
Stative verbs introduce a quality attributed to the subject (Tom seems bored) or a
state of affairs (We know the way). Dynamic verbs are used in descriptions of
events (The kettle is boiling; Cathy listened intently). Dynamic verbs can occur with
the -ing form, as in is boiling, has been listening.
structure
The structure of a unit refers to the parts that make up the unit. For example, a
sentence may have the structure subject, verb, object, as in:
David (S) has written (V) a good paper (O).
Or a noun phrase may have the structure determiner, pre-modiﬁer, noun, as in:
a (det) good (pre-mod) paper (noun)
subject
The subject is an element that usually comes before the verb in a declarative
sentence [1] and after the operator in an interrogative sentence [2]:
[1]
We (S) should consider (V) the rights of every class.
[2]
Should (op) we (S) consider the rights of every class?
Except in imperative sentences, the subject is an obligatory element. In active
structures, the subject typically refers to the performer of the action.

292
An Introduction to English Grammar
subject complement
Linking verbs require a subject complement to complete the sentence. The most
common linking verb is be. Subject complements are usually noun phrases [1] or
adjective phrases [2]:
[1]
Leonard is Mary’s brother
[2]
Robert looks very happy.
The subject complement typically identiﬁes or characterizes the subject.
subjective case
The personal pronouns and the pronouns who and whoever distinguish between
subjective case and objective case. The subjective case is used when a pronoun is
the subject (I in I know). The objective case is used when a pronoun is a direct object
(me in He pushed me) or indirect object (me in She told me the truth) or complement
of a preposition ( for me). The subject complement takes the subjective case in
formal style (This is she), but otherwise the objective case (This is her) is usual.
subject-operator inversion
In subject-operator inversion, the usual order is inverted: the operator comes
before the subject:
[1]
Are (op) you (S) staying?
Subject-operator inversion occurs chieﬂy in questions, as in [1]. It also occurs
when a negative element is fronted, as in [2]:
[2]
Not a word did we hear.
Compare [2a] and [2b]:
[2a]
We did not hear a word.
[2b]
We heard not a word.
subject–verb agreement
The general rule is that a verb agrees with its subject in number and person
whenever the verb displays distinctions in number and person:
The dog barks.
I am thirsty.
The dogs bark.
She is thirsty.
subjunctive
The present subjunctive is the base form of the verb:

Glossary
293
I demanded that Norman leave the meeting.
It is essential that you be on time.
The past subjunctive is were.
If Tess were here, she would help me.
See 4.19.
subordinate clause See Complex sentence.
subordinator See Conjunction.
sufﬁx
A sufﬁx is added after the stem of a word to form a new word, e.g. -ness in goodness.
A sufﬁx that expresses a grammatical relationship is an inﬂection, e.g. plural -s in
crowds or past -ed in cooked.
superordinate clause
A superordinate clause is a clause that has a subordinate clause as one of its elements:
I hear (A) that you know (B) where Ken lives.
The (A) clause that you know where Ken lives is superordinate to the (B) clause
where Ken lives. The subordinate (B) clause is the direct object in the (A) clause.
syntax
This is another term for Grammar, as that term is used in this book.
tag question
A tag question is attached to a sentence that is not interrogative. It invites agreement:
You remember me, don’t you?
Please don’t tell them, will you?
tense
Tense is the grammatical category that refers to time and is signalled by the form
of the verb. There are two tenses: present (laugh, laughs) and past (laughed).
there-structure
In a there-structure, there is put in the subject position and the subject is moved to
a later position:
There is somebody here to see you. (cf. ‘Somebody is here to see you.’)

294
An Introduction to English Grammar
transitive Verb See Object.
verb
A verb is either (like a noun) a member of a word class or (like a subject) an
element in sentence or clause structure. As a verb, it functions in a verb phrase.
The verb phrase may be playing is the verb of the sentence in [1]:
[1]
She may be playing tennis this afternoon.
It is the verb of the that-clause in [2]:
[2]
She says that she may be playing tennis this afternoon.
See Main verb.
verbless clause
A verbless clause is a reduced clause that does not have a verb:
Send me another one if possible. (‘if it is possible’)
Though in pain, Joan came with us. (‘Though she was in pain’)
verb phrase
A verb phrase consists of a main verb preceded optionally by a maximum of four
auxiliaries.
voice
Voice is a grammatical category that applies to the structure of the sentence and to
the structure of the verb phrase. There are two voices: the active voice and the
passive voice. See Active.
wh-question
A wh-question is a question beginning with an interrogative word or with a phrase
containing an interrogative word. All interrogative words except how begin with
the spelling wh-: who, whom, whose, which, what, where, when, why.
yes–no question
A yes–no question is a question that expects the answer yes or no. Yes–no questions
require subject–operator inversion:
Can (op) I (S) have a word with you?
zero relative pronoun See Relative pronoun.
