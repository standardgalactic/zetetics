Study on the dielectric properties of CaCu3Ti4O12
ceramics using the one-dimensional Ising model
As a high-dielectric cubic perovskite-related material, Ca-
Cu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) has a dielectric constant of 104 at room
temperature. Up to now the origin of the peculiar dielectric
phenomena in CCTO is not fully understood and there are
some disputes in the literature. In this paper, based a one-di-
mensional Ising model under static electric field, the dielec-
tric properties of CCTO were studied. Results indicate that
the theory is nearly consistent with the experiment.
Keywords: CaCu3Ti4O12; Dielectric constant; One-di-
mensional Ising model
1. Introduction
Recently, the unusual cubic perovskite-related CaCu3Ti4O12
(CCTO) has attracted considerable attention [1–21]. The
ceramic of CCTO has high dielectric constant in the order
of 104, the single crystal of CCTO has high dielectric con-
stant in the order of 105 and remains almost constant in the
temperature range from 100 to 600 K. But at a temperature
of 100 K the dielectric constant drops rapidly by 2–3 orders
of magnitude [1]. Moreover, with the help of neutron powder
diffraction, high-resolution X-ray diffraction and Raman
investigations, there is no evidence of any structural phase
transition in CCTO from 20 to 600 K [1–3].
There are many disputes about the origin of the high
dielectric constant in CCTO. Homes et al. [1] observed that
there is an anomalous low-temperature vibration mode in
the single crystal of CCTO, implying that there is a redistri-
bution of charge within the unit cell at low temperatures.
Subramanian et al. [2] demonstrated that twin boundaries
enhance the high dielectric constants in CCTO. Sinclair
and Adams [3] proposed that the giant-dielectric phenom-
enon is attributed to a grain boundary (internal) barrier
layer capacitance (IBLC). However, up to now the origin
of the peculiar dielectric phenomena in CCTO is not fully
understood.
In this paper, CCTO ceramics samples were prepared by
the traditional solid state reaction method and the dielectric
properties were investigated. Figure 1 represents the tem-
perature dependence of the dielectric constant for the sam-
ples of CCTO under different frequencies between 103.5 Hz
and 106.0 Hz. It is shown that the dielectric constant of
CCTO increases with increasing temperature at the differ-
ent frequencies investigated. At room temperature the
dielectric constant for CCTO, e ~ 104, is weakly tempera-
ture dependent over a broad temperature range. The dielec-
tric constant drops rapidly by 2–3 orders of magnitude be-
low a certain temperature. The transition temperature of
the dielectric constant increases with the increase of fre-
quency [22].
In order to understand these phenomena, in this paper the
dielectric properties of CCTO were attempted to study by a
one-dimensional Ising model.
2. Model
2.1. One-dimensional dipole model of CCTO
Some unit cells of CCTO are shown in Fig. 2. The big black
spheres represent Ca atoms, the medium gray spheres repre-
sent Cu atoms, the light gray spheres represent O atoms.
The Ti atoms are located at the center of the TiO6 octahedra
and are not visible in Fig. 2.
There exists polarization inside the TiO6 octahedra.
Considering that the macroscopic polarization is zero, it
can be assumed that the spontaneous polarization of four
octahedra in each unit cell of CCTO constitutes a parallelo-
gram, so the polarizations counteract each other as shown in
Fig. 3a. The projection in a certain direction constitutes a
one-dimensional chain shown in Fig. 3b, so the one-dimen-
sional Ising model can be used to it.
2.2. One-dimensional Ising model
The one-dimensional Ising model consisted mainly of a po-
larization lattice [23]. The particle state of the i lattice could

be completely represented by the polaron ri. In order to
simply study this question, there are some suppositions:
1. Only two polarization: up and down, expressed as ri = 1
and ri = –1, respectively.
2. The interaction exists only with the direct neighbor.
3. The potential of the system can be obtained by adding
the interaction energies.
Obviously, due to the interaction between the dipoles the
polarizations in the lattice tend to order, while thermal
movement leads to polarization disorder. So at a certain
temperature the polarization is likely to order. This is the
Ising model. Considering the simplest situation, i.e. the
polarization is distributed in a one-dimensional linear
chain, this is the one-dimensional Ising model.
Assume that the N dipoles arrange into a linear equidi-
stant chain, the polarization coordinate of the i dipole is ri.
Suppose the interaction potential between polaron ri and
ri+1 is –Jriri+1, so the contribution to the potential is –J
when the dipoles are parallel and J when the dipoles are
antiparallel. If J > 0 the polarization tend to the same direc-
tion, so the total potential of the system in an external elec-
tric field E is:

where l is the electric moment of a single dipole.
If we use the periodic boundary conditions, the problem
is greatly simplified. As shown in Fig. 4, the circle with N
dipoles indicates the connection between first and last
dipole.
Because the dipole interaction decreases quickly with the
increase of distance, only the interactions of the nearest di-
pole need to be considered. Note that because of the infinite
structure of the one-dimensional chain and rN+1 = r1, Eq. (1)
can be written more symmetrical:

If no external field is considered, but considering the inter-

Obviously, when there is no external field (x = 0), P = 0,
i.e. the electric moment disappears. So the macroscopic
spontaneous polarization of CCTO is zero when there is no
external electric field.

The e ~ T curve can be obtained based on Eq. (17) and is
shown in Fig. 5, the fitting parameters for N = 3 · 1021,
E = 100 V m–1, l = 0.6309 · 10–23 J m V–1, J = –0.9315 ·
10–20 J, respectively. It is found that the dielectric constant
increases with the increase of temperature. Obviously, the
theoretical curve is nearly consistent with the experimental
curve.
4. Conclusions
The dielectric properties of CCTO were discussed based on
the one-dimensional Ising model. It is found that the dielec-
tric constant increases with the increase of temperature, at

about 150 ~ 250 K there is a strong increase, and the
dielectric constant is about 104 at room temperature. Com-
paring with the experimental curve, there is still a little dif-
ference, the possible reason is that the theoretical model re-
gards Ti+4 displacement polarization and O–2 electronic
polarization as a strong correlation dipole in an electrostatic
field, but does not consider the frequency response of the
relaxation in an alternating electric field. A more strict dis-
cussion will be reported in the near future.
