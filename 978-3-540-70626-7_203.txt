Spectroscopic data, together with  scattering experiments, were probably the most
important experimental input to the development of  quantum theory and early
quantum mechanics. Not a discipline in its own right (see [6]), spectroscopy was
practiced within chemistry, optics and astrophysics and has a history extending far
back. Discontinuous features in the spectra of sunlight and from the ﬂames of vari-
ous substances were the subject of intense study throughout the nineteenth century.
As early as 1815, the Munich optician Joseph Fraunhofer (1787–1826) published
a detailed map of the solar spectrum exhibiting about 350 dark lines. He realized
these dark lines could serve as useful markers for speciﬁc colors in the otherwise

continuous solar spectrum. His speciﬁc application was for gauging precision mea-
surements of the refractive indices of various types of glass being manufactured
at the glass-works under his purview (see [7]). Other maps of wider range and
greater detail followed (see [8]). In 1859, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824–1887)
and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (1811–1899) discovered the exact coincidence of dark
absorption lines in the solar spectrum with bright emission lines in the spectra of
various chemical elements heated to incandescence. Only then could the two very
different types of spectra be correctly interpreted as due to absorption and emission.
The Bunsen-burner ﬂame was colorless, so a correlation between the presence of
certain spectrum lines with speciﬁc chemical elements in samples of unknown con-
stitution became feasible: Spectrum analysis was born and quickly matured into one
of the most active research ﬁelds of the latter half of the nineteenth century. Detailed
tables were compiled: Heinrich Kayser (1853–1940) and Henry Augustus Rowland
(1848–1901), for instance, catalogued tens of thousands of spectrum lines and re-
lated them to the known chemical elements. Roughly a dozen new elements (e.g.,
caesium, rubidium and indium) were discovered by investigating the tell-tale spec-
trum lines not yet correlated with any element. Detailed examinations of the spectra
of various gases in a discharge tube revealed groups of lines of similar appearance
nonrandomly distributed over the spectrum, which came to be known as series and
bands (Fig. 1).
Sharp, principal and diffuse series were distinguished (whence the later S, P
and D designations) in the hydrogen spectrum, in particular. Many of these series
spectra were also detected in the spectrum of the sun and other stars. Employing
geometric analogy, the Basel mathematics teacher Johann Jakob Balmer (1825–
1898) hit upon a formula for the wavelength λ of these series lines as a function
of an integer variable n: λn = h · n2/(n2 – 4). He realized that other series were
possible if 4 = 22 is replaced with other squares in the denominator. Such series
were later identiﬁed by Friedrich Paschen (1908), Frederick S. Brackett (1922) and
August Herman Pfund (1924) in the infrared, and by Theodore Lyman (1914) in the
ultraviolet. An inquiry into the relation between these various series lines led Walter
Ritz (1878–1909) to suggest the so-called combination law, according to which the
difference between any two series-line frequencies yields another series line. But
deeper understanding of these various pieces of the puzzle had to await the rise of
Niels Bohr’s  atomic model.
“As soon as I saw Balmer’s formula,” Niels Bohr (1885–1962) later said, “the
whole thing was clear to me.” The Danish spectroscopist Hans Marius Hansen

(1886–1956) had just told him about the Balmer series of hydrogen in February
1913, freshly returned from a postdoc stay at G¨ottingen, where he had been conduct-
ing experiments with the  Zeeman effect on lithium together with Woldemar Voigt
(1850–1919). Bohr made a last-minute revision to his paper for the Philosophical
Magazine to start with a discussion of emission and absorption lines in the hydrogen
spectrum and a derivation of the Rydberg constant R according to his new atomic
model (see, e.g., [11]). From  Bohr’s atom model, Bohr had already derived energy
E as a function of nucleus mass m and charge Ze(with n a natural number):
En = R · mZ2e4/n2
In order to obtain the formula for the Balmer spectrum-line frequencies v:
v = v0
m2 −4

Bohr just had to apply Einstein’s assumption that E = hv and:
v ∼E1 −E2 = const

The frequencies of series lines were thus not directly correlated with the oscilla-
tory motion of  electrons around the nucleus, as had always been assumed; they
were rather related to differences between the initial and ﬁnal energy level E. The
emission or absorption of a spectral line was equivalent to a  quantum jump by
an electron between stable orbits at different energy levels. This reinterpretation of
spectra so comprehensible to us today was a veritable Gestalt switch as deﬁned by
Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996). “When [Einstein] heard this he was extremely aston-
ished and told me: ‘Then the frequency of the light does not depend at all on the
frequency of the electron... this is an enormous achievement. The theory of Bohr
must then be right.’” (From G. Hevesy’s letter to Bohr, 23 Sep. 1913 [1, vol. 2, p.
533]).
Within a matter of years, Bohr’s considerations totally transformed spectroscopy.
Instead of plotting spectrum maps, spectroscopists reinterpreted all spectrum lines
as transitions between different energy levels and constructed term diagrams (like
Fig. 2). Each spectrum line provided a clue to the existing stable energy levels of
electron orbits around the nucleus of a given element and the allowed transitions
between them. In 1913 Henry Moseley (1887–1915) managed to explain series reg-
ularities in X-ray spectra. He showed that their frequencies ν were also dependent
on nuclear charge Z, but not as ν ∼Z2 as in the Balmer series, but ∼(Z– 1)2. This
strict regularity led to the discovery of several new chemical elements: technetium,
promethium and rhenium. In the following year Bohr realized that his formula for
the hydrogen series lines could also be adapted to the helium spectrum if Z = 1
is replaced by Z = 2. Thus the long-known Pickering spectrum series in certain
stellar spectra was explained and soon also observed in a discharge tube ﬁlled with

pure helium gas. By 1915, Bohr himself and others also succeeded in explaining
the observed line splitting of atoms radiating in magnetic and electric ﬁelds, the
 Zeeman and  Stark effects. Since, in general, there were fewer spectrum lines
observed than were combinatorically possible, special  selection rules were set
for transitions. Only with the advent of the concept of  spin in late 1925 were
these phenomenological rules better understood as arising from angular momentum
conservation, with electrons being spin 1/2 particles and the  light quantum (or
photon) carrying spin 1. A merely descriptive spectroscopy was thus replaced by
explanatory hypotheses based on  Bohr’s atomic model. Quantum mechanics as
formulated in 1925/26 yielded formulas for the spectral series and other regularities
fully equivalent to the semi-classical Bohr–Sommerfeld atomic model in ﬁrst order,
and only slightly differing in higher orders of perturbation theory (see, e.g., [13]).
Spectroscopic data were again crucial in its development. See also  Spin echo.
