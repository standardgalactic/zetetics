Abstract:
We show that in every two-colouring of the edges of the complete graph KN
there is a monochromatic Kk which can be extended in at least (1 + ok(1))2−kN ways to
a monochromatic Kk+1. This result is asymptotically best possible, as may be seen by
considering a random colouring. Equivalently, deﬁning the book B(k)
n
to be the graph
consisting of n copies of Kk+1 all sharing a common Kk, we show that the Ramsey number
r(B(k)
n ) = 2kn+ok(n). In this form, our result answers a question of Erd˝os, Faudree, Rousseau
and Schelp and establishes an asymptotic version of a conjecture of Thomason.

Introduction
The Ramsey number r(H) of a graph H is the smallest natural number N such that every two-colouring
of the edges of the complete graph KN contains a monochromatic copy of H. The problem of determining
Ramsey numbers is notoriously hard. For instance, when H is a complete graph, work of Erd˝os and
Szekeres [8, 12] in the 1930s and 40s showed that
√
2
t ≤r(Kt) ≤4t, but the only improvements to these
bounds since that time [3, 24] have been to lower order terms.
We investigate the Ramsey numbers of books, a study which bears close relation to the problem of
determining r(Kt). The book B(k)
n
is the graph consisting of n copies of Kk+1, all sharing a common Kk.
Embracing the metaphor, we refer to the common Kk as the spine of the book and the n points completing
each copy of Kk+1 as the pages or leaves.
The Ramsey problem for these books was ﬁrst studied by Erd˝os, Faudree, Rousseau and Schelp [10]
and then by Thomason [25]. Both papers contain bounds of the form
2kn+ok(n) ≤r(B(k)
n ) ≤4kn,

where the lower bound follows from considering the random graph G(n,1/2) and the upper bound from a
standard neighbourhood chasing argument. In their paper, Erd˝os et al. asked whether one of these bounds
might be asymptotically correct and Thomason conjectured that the lower bound is. In fact, he made a
very precise conjecture about the value of r(B(k)
n ), namely, that
r(B(k)
n ) ≤2k(n+k −2)+2.
For k = 2, this conjecture is known to hold [23] and is tight for inﬁnitely many values of n. The main
contribution of this paper is a proof of an approximate version of Thomason’s conjecture, thus answering
the question of Erd˝os et al. (see also [21]).
Theorem 1. For every natural number k,
r(B(k)
n ) = 2kn+ok(n).
To see something of why this is interesting, suppose that we have a red/blue-colouring of KN with no
monochromatic copy of Kt. Then this colouring contains no monochromatic book B(k)
n
with n equal to the
off-diagonal Ramsey number r(Kt−k,Kt). Indeed, suppose that the book is red. If the set induced by the
pages contains a blue Kt, we have a contradiction, so it must contain a red Kt−k. But together with the red
spine Kk, this forms a red Kt. Hence, by Theorem 1, if t, and therefore n, is sufﬁciently large in terms of
k, we have
r(Kt) ≤r(B(k)
n ) ≤2k+1r(Kt−k,Kt) ≤2k+1
2t −k
t −k

,
where the last inequality follows from a classical estimate of Erd˝os and Szekeres [12]. In particular, if the
theorem applied for t linear in k, this would give an exponential improvement on the upper bound for
diagonal Ramsey numbers. Unfortunately, our Theorem 1 is very far from achieving this goal, since in
order to obtain an error term of the form εn we require n to be at least a tower of twos whose height is a
function of k and 1/ε.
Another motivation for Theorem 1 is its relation to a well-known, but false, conjecture of Erd˝os [9]
(see also [2]) asserting that every two-colouring of the edges of KN contains at least
(1+ok(1))21−(k

monochromatic copies of Kk. That is, he conjectured that a random colouring should asymptotically
minimise the number of monochromatic copies of Kk. While true for k = 3 by a result of Goodman [16],
this conjecture was disproved for k ≥4 by Thomason [26]. However, Theorem 1 is equivalent to a
local version of Erd˝os’ conjecture, saying that there is some monochromatic copy of Kk−1 which is
contained in asymptotically as many monochromatic Kk as in a random colouring. In some ways, this
interpretation is more appealing than the original formulation in terms of books. It also connects our
result with the study of Ramsey multiplicity, which has drawn considerable attention in recent years (see,
for instance, [4, 7, 13, 19, 20]).

Preliminaries
In this section, we collect several results that we will need for the proof of Theorem 1.
2.1
Regularity and counting lemmas
One of the main ingredients in our proof is a simple corollary of Szemerédi’s regularity lemma. To
state this fundamental result, we ﬁrst recall some standard deﬁnitions. Given two vertex sets U and V
in a graph, the density d(U,V) between them is given by d(U,V) = e(U,V)/|U||V|. A bipartite graph
between two vertex sets U and V is said to be ε-regular if, for all sets U′ ⊆U, V ′ ⊆V with |U′| ≥ε|U|
and |V ′| ≥ε|V|, |d(U′,V ′)−d(U,V)| ≤ε. A partition V(G) = ∪m
i=1Vi of the vertex set of a graph G is
said to be equitable if ||Vi|−|Vj|| ≤1 for all i and j. The regularity lemma is now as follows.
Lemma 1. For every 0 < ε < 1 and natural number m0, there exists a natural number M such that every
graph G with at least m0 vertices has an equitable partition V(G) = ∪m
i=1Vi with m0 ≤m ≤M parts such
that all but εm2 pairs (Vi,Vj) with 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤m are ε-regular.
We will also need the following lemma from [5]. We say that a subset U of the vertex set of a graph
G is ε-regular if the pair (U,U) is ε-regular.
Lemma 2. For every 0 < ε < 1, there exists a constant δ such that every graph G contains an ε-regular
vertex subset U with |U| ≥δ|V(G)|.
The key lemma we will need is the following. We note a superﬁcial similarity to a lemma used in the
proof of the induced removal lemma [1], though that lemma requires the stronger condition that every
pair (Wi,Wj) be regular.
Lemma 3. For every 0 < η < 1 and natural number m0, there exists a natural number M such that every
graph G with at least m0 vertices has an equitable partition V(G) = ∪m
i=1Vi with m0 ≤m ≤M parts and
subsets Wi ⊆Vi such that Wi is η-regular for all i and, for all but ηm2 pairs (i, j) with 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤m,
(Vi,Vj), (Wi,Vj) and (Wi,Wj) are η-regular with |d(Wi,Vj)−d(Vi,Vj)| ≤η and |d(Wi,Wj)−d(Vi,Vj)| ≤
η.
Proof. Apply the regularity lemma, Lemma 1, to G with ε = η · δ(η), with δ as in Lemma 2. This
yields an equitable partition V(G) = ∪m
i=1Vi where all but εm2 ≤ηm2 pairs (Vi,Vj) with 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤m
are ε-regular. Within each piece Vi, now apply Lemma 2 to ﬁnd a set Wi of order at least δ(η) which is
η-regular. Note that if (Vi,Vj) is ε-regular, then, since |Wi| ≥δ|Vi| and ε = η ·δ(η), the pairs (Wi,Vj)
and (Wi,Wj) are η-regular with |d(Wi,Vj)−d(Vi,Vj)| ≤ε ≤η and |d(Wi,Wj)−d(Vi,Vj)| ≤η.
In order to apply Lemma 3, we need a standard counting lemma (see, for example, [22, Theorem 18]).
We use the shorthand x±δ to indicate a quantity that lies between x−δ and x+δ.
Lemma 4. For any δ > 0 and any natural number k, there is η > 0 such that if U1,...,Uk are (not
necessarily distinct) vertex sets with (Ui,Ui′) η-regular of density di,i′ for all 1 ≤i < i′ ≤k, then there are

copies of Kk with vertex i in Ui for each 1 ≤i ≤k.
In practice, we will always use this lemma in the following form.
Lemma 5. For any δ > 0 and any natural number k, there is η > 0 such that if U1,...,Uk, Uk+1,...,Uk+ℓ
are (not necessarily distinct) vertex sets with (Ui,Ui′) η-regular of density di,i′ for all 1 ≤i < i′ ≤k and
1 ≤i ≤k < i′ ≤k +ℓand di,i′ ≥δ for all 1 ≤i < i′ ≤k, then there is a copy of Kk with vertex i in Ui for
each 1 ≤i ≤k which is contained in at least

A coloured extremal result
We will need a coloured version of the celebrated Erd˝os–Stone theorem [11]. Recall that a blow-up of a
graph H is a graph where each vertex of H is replaced by a vertex set and the bipartite graph between two
such vertex sets is complete whenever the corresponding vertices are joined by an edge.
Lemma 6. For any natural numbers k and t and any δ > 0, there exists a natural number n0 such that if
the edges of the complete graph on n ≥n0 vertices are coloured in red and blue, then, provided the blue
density is at least 1−
1
k−1 +δ, there is a blue blow-up of Kk with t vertices in each part, where each part
is itself a monochromatic clique.

THE RAMSEY NUMBER OF BOOKS
Proof. Since the blue density is at least 1−
1
k−1 +δ, the Erd˝os–Stone theorem implies that for n ≥n0
there is a blue blow-up of Kk with at least r(Kt) vertices in each part. Applying Ramsey’s theorem within
each part then gives the required monochromatic cliques.
In practice, we will use a slight variant of this lemma, where the underlying graph is not necessarily
complete.
Lemma 7. For any natural numbers k and t and any δ > 0, there exists a natural number n1 and ε > 0
such that if the edges of a graph on n ≥n1 vertices with (1−ε)
 n


edges are coloured in red and blue,
then, provided the blue density is at least 1−
1
k−1 +δ, there is a blue blow-up of Kk with t vertices in each
part, where each part is itself a monochromatic clique.
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that the ε
 n
2

missing edges are coloured blue, so that the underlying graph is
complete. Then, by Lemma 6, every subset of the graph of order n0 contains the required blow-up of Kk
with monochromatic parts of order t. But then, for n sufﬁciently large in terms of n0, there must be at
least

such blow-ups of Kk. However, at most εn2 ·nkt−2 = εnkt such copies contain an edge from the missing
set. Therefore, for ε < 1/2nkt
0 , we must have the required blue blow-up of Kk with at least t vertices in
each part, where each part is a monochromatic clique.
2.3
Some technical lemmas
The proof requires a small degree of optimisation, almost all of which is contained in the following two
lemmas.
Lemma 8. For each i = 1,...,k, let xi be a real number between 0 and t. Then
1
k
k
∑
i=1
(t −xi)k +
k
∏
i=1
xi ≥2(t/2)k.
Proof. As the result is easily checked for k = 2, 3 and 4, we can assume without loss of generality that
k ≥5. Moreover, since (t −t/k)k > 2(t/2)kk for all k ≥5, we may assume that none of the xi are less
than t/k.
We claim that the minimum value of ∑i(t −xi)k subject to the constraint ∏i xi = z, and assuming
xi ≥t/k for all i, occurs when all the xi are equal to z1/k. To see this, make the substitution xi = eyi.
The problem then becomes to minimise ∑k
i=1(t −eyi)k subject to the constraint ∑k
i=1 yi = logz. But the
function (t −ey)k is easily seen to be a convex function of y for t/k ≤ey ≤t. Therefore, the minimum
occurs when all of the eyi and, hence, all of the xi are equal.
Substituting xi = z1/k for all i, it simply remains to minimise f(z) = (t −z1/k)k +z on the interval
[0,tk]. But f ′(z) = −(t −z1/k)k−1z−(k−1)/k + 1, which equals 0 precisely when z = (t/2)k. Hence, the
minimum value of f(z) is 2(t/2)k, as required.

Proof. Suppose that ∑i xi = c and we wish to minimise the left-hand side of the required inequality under
this constraint. We claim that the minimum occurs when all but one of the xi equal 0 or 1, that is, ⌊c⌋of
the xi are 1, one is {c} = c−⌊c⌋and the rest are 0.
Suppose instead that x1 and x2, say, are both different from 0 and 1. Then x1x2 = x1(c−∑k
i=3 xi −x1),
which has the form −x2
1 +Bx1, where B is a function of x3,...,xk and hence constant if these variables
are held constant. But such a polynomial is minimised when x1 is either as large or as small as possible
within its allowed range. Hence, if x1 and x2 = c−∑k
i=3 xi −x1 are both different from 0 and 1, we may
vary x1, keeping all xi with 3 ≤i ≤k ﬁxed, to make x1x2, and thus ∏k
i=1 xi, smaller. This contradiction

Proof of Theorem 1
Suppose that we have a red/blue-colouring of the edges of the complete graph on N = (2k +ε)n vertices.
Assume that η is taken sufﬁciently small and m0 sufﬁciently large in terms of k and ε and apply
Lemma 3 with η and m0 to the red subgraph to obtain an equitable partition ∪m
i=1Vi of the vertex set
[N] with m ≥m0 and subsets Wi ⊆Vi such that Wi is η-regular for all i and, for all but ηm2 pairs
(i, j) with 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤m, (Vi,Vj), (Wi,Vj) and (Wi,Wj) are η-regular with |d(Wi,Vj) −d(Vi,Vj)| ≤η
and |d(Wi,Wj) −d(Vi,Vj)| ≤η, where d(U,V) measures the red density between vertex sets U and
V. Because the colours are complementary, the same conclusion holds for the blue subgraph. For
convenience of notation, we will assume below that all Vi have precisely the same order N/m.
We now form a coloured reduced graph with vertex set v1,...,vm. To each vi, we assign a colour ci,
either red or blue, depending on which colour has the higher density inside Wi, breaking ties arbitrarily.
By the pigeonhole principle, at least m/2 of the ci are the same colour, say red. We now colour the edges
of the reduced graph, leaving an edge uncoloured if (Wi,Vj), (Vi,Vj) and (Wi,Wj) are not all η-regular

with |d(Wi,Vj)−d(Vi,Vj)| ≤η and |d(Wi,Wj)−d(Vi,Vj)| ≤η. Otherwise, we ﬁx a constant δ (which
will be taken sufﬁciently small in terms of k and ε) and colour the edge vivj red if the red density between
Vi and Vj is at least 1−δ and blue if the blue density is at least δ, again breaking ties arbitrarily. Note
that there are at most ηm2 ordered pairs (i, j) whose corresponding edge is uncoloured. Therefore, by
deleting at most √ηm vertices, we may assume that each vertex is adjacent to at most √ηm uncoloured
edges. In what follows, when referring to the reduced graph, we will assume that these vertices have been
removed. Note that at least s = ⌈(1/2−√η)m⌉of the remaining vertices have colour red.
Suppose now that there is a red vertex va in the reduced graph which has degree at least ℓ:= 2−km
in red, with neighbours vb1,...,vbℓ. Since the density of red edges in Wa is at least 1/2, we may apply
Lemma 5 with U1 = ··· = Uk = Wa and Uk+j = Vbj for j = 1,...,ℓto conclude that, for η sufﬁciently
small in terms of δ, there is a red Kk which is contained in at least

red Kk+1. Provided η and δ are sufﬁciently small in terms of k and ε, this quantity is at least n, so we
obtain the required book B(k)
n . We may therefore assume that we are in the other case, where every red
vertex in the reduced graph has blue degree at least m−ℓ−2√ηm ≥(1−2−k −2√η)m.
The degree of each red vertex is therefore at least (1 −2−k −2√η)m in blue. If we restrict to
a set S consisting of s of the red vertices, the blue degree of each vertex inside this set is at least
s−(2−k +2√η)m ≥(1−2−(k−1) −16√η)s. Since 1−2−(k−1) −16√η > 1−(k −1)−1 +β for some
β > 0 depending only on k and the number of uncoloured edges is at most ηm2 ≤8ηs2, Lemma 7 implies
that for m sufﬁciently large and η sufﬁciently small in terms of k and t, where t is a constant to be ﬁxed
below, the reduced graph contains a blue blow-up of Kk with at least t vertices in each part, where each
part is itself a monochromatic clique.
We now claim that none of these monochromatic cliques can be blue. Indeed, suppose otherwise and
C is a blue clique of order t. If any of the vertices in C, say va, is such that ∑j d(Wa,Vj) ≥1
2m, where the
sum is taken over all j such that (Wa,Vj) is η-regular, then we have

Again, since the density of red edges inWa is at least 1/2, we may apply Lemma 5 withU1 = ··· =Uk =Wa
and Uk+j equal in turn to each of the Vj for which (Wa,Vj) is η-regular to conclude that, for η sufﬁciently
small in terms of δ, there is a red Kk which is contained in at least

Therefore, writing d(U,V) for the blue density between sets U and V, we must have ∑j d(Wa,Vj) ≥

Since, in the reduced graph, each vai has at most √ηm neighbours vj such that (Wai,Vj) is not η-regular,

We now apply Lemma 5 with Ui = Wai for each 1 ≤i ≤k and Uk+j equal in turn to each Vj with (Wai,Vj)
η-regular for all 1 ≤i ≤k to conclude that, for η sufﬁciently small in terms of δ, there is a blue Kk which

blue Kk+1. Provided η, δ and ξ are sufﬁciently small (and t is sufﬁciently large) in terms of k and ε, this
quantity is again at least n.
This completes the proof of the claim. We may therefore assume that all of the cliques are red and
focus on the subgraph of the reduced graph consisting of the k red cliques C1,...,Ck, each of order t,
where every edge between Ci and Cj with i ̸= j is blue.
Now, for each vertex v in the reduced graph, let ei(v) be the weighted blue degree of v in each Ci. That
is, ei(v) = ∑w∈Ci d(v,w). By Lemma 8, 1
k ∑v ∑i(t −ei(v))k +∑v ∏i ei(v) ≥2(t/2)km′, which implies that
either ∑v ∑i(t −ei(v))k ≥(t/2)kkm′ or ∑v ∏i ei(v) ≥(t/2)km′, where m′ = (1 −√η)m. In the second
case, we see that there must exist a choice of vertices vc1,...,vck with vci ∈Ci such that

blue Kk+1, again giving the required book for η and δ sufﬁciently small in terms of k and ε.
In the ﬁrst case, there exists a Cr such that ∑v(t −er(v))k ≥(t/2)km′. There must therefore exist (not
necessarily distinct) vertices d1,...,dk ∈Cr such that

If we again remove the at most k√ηm vertices vj such that (Wdi,Vj) is not η-regular for all 1 ≤i ≤k, we
may apply Lemma 5 with Ui = Wdi for i = 1,...,k and Uk+j equal in turn to each Vj such that (Wdi,Vj)
is η-regular for each 1 ≤i ≤k to conclude that, for η sufﬁciently small in terms of δ, there is a red Kk
which is contained in at least

red Kk+1, giving the required book in this ﬁnal case provided η and δ are again small enough in terms of
k and ε. This completes the proof.

Concluding remarks
One obvious question is whether a multicolour analogue of Theorem 1 might hold. This is certainly not
the case when the number of colours is large. To see this, we use the fact that there exist q-colourings
of the complete graph on vertex set {1,2,...,2qk/4} with no monochromatic Kk (see, for example, [6,
Section 2.1]). Fix such a colouring χ. We consider the (q+1)-coloured complete graph whose vertex set
is split into t = 2qk/4 vertex sets V1,...,Vt, each of order n, where every edge between Vi and Vj receives
the colour χ(i, j) and edges internal to any Vi all receive a (q+1)st colour. This colouring contains no
monochromatic B(k)
n , so the (q+1)-colour Ramsey number r(B(k)
n ;q+1) ≥2qk/4n, far greater than the
(q+1)kn bound one might hope for. More generally, we have r(B(k)
n ;q+1) ≥(r(k;q)−1)n, so, if true,
the problem of showing that r(B(k)
n ;3) ≤3kn+ok(n) is at least as hard as showing that r(k) ≤3k+o(k).
It is also tempting to generalise Theorem 1 to hypergraphs. To this end, we deﬁne B(k,s)
n
to be the
s-uniform hypergraph consisting of n copies of K(s)
k+1, all sharing a common K(s)
k . The natural conjecture
would then be that
r(B(k,s)
n
) = 2( k
s−1)n+ok,s(n).
However, this is false for s ≥4. To see this, suppose that s ≥3, k is a multiple of s and there is a 2-colouring
χ of the s-uniform hypergraph on vertex set {1,2,...,r −1} with no monochromatic K(s)
k/s. Consider the
complete s-uniform hypergraph whose vertex set is split into r −1 vertex sets V1,...,Vr−1, each of order

n. To colour this hypergraph, suppose that {v1,...,vs} is an edge and vj ∈Vij for all 1 ≤j ≤s. If the ij
are all distinct, we colour the edge by χ(i1,...,is) and if the ij are all the same, we colour the edge red.
Otherwise, we colour the edge blue. Since the colouring χ contains no monochromatic K(s)
k/s, at least s
elements of the spine of any monochromatic B(k,s)
n
are contained in the same set Vi. But this implies that
the book must be red and, therefore, entirely contained within Vi, which is not large enough to contain it,
a contradiction. Since we may take r to be r(K(s)
k/s), this implies that
r(B(k,s)
n
) ≥(r(K(s)
k/s)−1)n.
The value of r(K(s)
k ) is known to be at least an (s−2)-fold exponential in k (see, for example, [6]), so this
disproves the conjecture for s ≥4. The s = 3 case remains unresolved, though a negative answer would
again follow from improved lower bounds for r(K(3)
k ).
As a ﬁnal remark, we note that there is a strong analogy between Theorem 1 and Green’s popular
progression theorem [17] (see also [18]). This says that for every ε > 0 there exists n0 such that if n ≥n0
and A is a subset of {1,2,...,n} of size αn, then there is d ̸= 0 such that A contains at least (α3 −ε)n
arithmetic progressions of length 3 with common difference d. That is, there are asymptotically at least as
many arithmetic progressions of length 3 in A with common difference d as there would be in a random
subset of {1,2,...,n} of the same size. A surprising recent result of Fox, Pham and Zhao [14, 15] says
that n0 grows as a tower-type function of ε, showing that an application of the (arithmetic) regularity
lemma in Green’s proof is in some sense necessary. It would be very interesting if a similar phenomenon
held for our result, though this seems unlikely to the author.
