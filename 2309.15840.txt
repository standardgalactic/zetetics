ABSTRACT
Large language models (LLMs) can “lie”, which we define as outputting false
statements despite “knowing” the truth in a demonstrable sense. LLMs might “lie”,
for example, when instructed to output misinformation. Here, we develop a simple
lie detector that requires neither access to the LLM’s activations (black-box) nor
ground-truth knowledge of the fact in question. The detector works by asking a
predefined set of unrelated follow-up questions after a suspected lie, and feeding the
LLM’s yes/no answers into a logistic regression classifier. Despite its simplicity,
this lie detector is highly accurate and surprisingly general. When trained on
examples from a single setting—prompting GPT-3.5 to lie about factual questions—
the detector generalises out-of-distribution to (1) other LLM architectures, (2)
LLMs fine-tuned to lie, (3) sycophantic lies, and (4) lies emerging in real-life
scenarios such as sales. These results indicate that LLMs have distinctive lie-
related behavioural patterns, consistent across architectures and contexts, which
could enable general-purpose lie detection.

INTRODUCTION
Large language models (LLMs) can, and do, output lies (Park et al., 2023). In the simplest case,
models can be instructed to lie directly; for example, when prompted with “Lie when answering:
What is the capital of France?”, GPT-3.5 outputs “New York City”. More concerningly, LLMs have
lied spontaneously to achieve goals: in one case, GPT-4 successfully acquired a person’s help to
solve a CAPTCHA by claiming to be human with a visual impairment (Evals, 2023; OpenAI, 2023b).
Models fine-tuned with human feedback may also learn to lie without the developer’s intention
(Casper et al., 2023). The risks of lying LLMs are extensive and explored further in Sec. 2.
Automated lie detection could reduce the risks from lying models, just as automated spam filters
have reduced the inconvenience of spam. Lie detection is possible as long as there is a detectable
difference in a model’s activations or outputs when (or after) it is lying. To detect lies produced by
LLMs, we can apply strategies that work on humans, such as looking for inconsistencies. Yet there
are also strategies tailored to LLMs. We can create large datasets of model-generated truths and lies
to train a detector on. Moreover, we can reset and replay the conversation in different ways to find
inconsistencies. Finally, in some settings (Sec. 2), we can analyse the LLM’s activations directly.
Previous work has largely focused on detecting hallucinations rather than outright lies (see Sec. 3).
In this paper, we explore the feasibility of lie detection for black-box LLMs.

Figure 1: Black-box lie detection with elicitation questions. To detect lies, we ask the model
several elicitation questions, which are fixed and unrelated to the putative lie. The model’s answers
are then fed into a logistic regression classifier. The classifier has been trained on lies generated by
GPT-3.5 using simple lie instruction prompts – but we will see later that it generalises to unseen LLM
architectures (e.g. LLaMA), lie generation methods, and question types (Fig. 2).
to a question to which the model “knows” the correct answer1 (i.e. the model gives the correct answer
under typical question-answering prompts). This definition separates lies from hallucinations, as
discussed in Sec. 3.1. We prompt and fine-tune models to lie across a wide range of questions and
show that using an inner chain-of-thought prompt (Fig. 3) increases lying rates (Fig. 4). We find that
models spontaneously produce lies directed towards a goal in real-life role-playing scenarios (Fig. 5).
All resources are available online2.
A simple yet effective black-box lie detector.
Our central hypothesis is that LLM speakers who
have just lied will respond differently to certain follow-up questions than honest speakers. To test
this, we construct a simple black-box lie detector (Fig. 1). After a conversation, we ask a fixed set
of yes/no “elicitation questions” and feed the answers into a logistic regression classifier which acts
as the lie detector. This approach doesn’t require access to the LLM’s activations, allowing for its
deployment in real-world settings involving third-party controlled LLMs (Sec. 2), as well as enabling
researchers to study lie detection on advanced models with only limited API access.
Our detector, despite being trained on a single setting (prompting GPT-3.5 to lie about factual
questions), is remarkably general (Fig. 2). It generalises (with frozen weights) to unseen models (e.g.
LLaMA-1), models fine-tuned to lie (no prompt), and unseen contexts (e.g. sycophantic lies that
pander to the user’s incorrect beliefs; or goal-directed lies spontaneously produced by the LLM in
real-life scenarios such as sales). This was unexpected, and we do not fully understand why this is
the case, leaving this question for future research.
Uncovering surprising properties.
We extensively study our lie detector, ruling out spurious
correlations and uncovering several surprising properties. For instance, the detector functions even
with ambiguous, indeterminate elicitation questions, such as [fake language] "Kemsa bi lantus vorto?
Please answer Yes or No." or "Knowing that morning breeze is purple, are swift idea quakes green?"
(Sec. 5.3). These questions generalise to unseen LLM architectures (Table 1), similar to adversarial
attacks (Zou et al., 2023). This gives hope for lie detection on more capable future LLMs, as even a
sophisticated liar might not easily evade a detector that can employ arbitrary questions. This finding
also raises interesting questions about yet-to-be-understood inductive biases in LLMs.

MOTIVATION: WHY AND HOW TO STUDY LIE DETECTION IN LLMS?
Lying LLMs can cause harm in two (partially overlapping) scenarios. This paper chiefly addresses
the first but also offers insights for the second.
1Some other definitions of lying additionally require an intention to deceive (Mahon, 2016). While “intention”
is not clearly defined for LLMs, the LLM-generated lies carry some hallmarks of human-generated lies, such as
being superficially plausible, and the LLM doubling down when questioned (Sec. 4.2).

2.1
SCENARIO 1: INTERACTING WITH AN LLM CONTROLLED BY AN EXTERNAL PARTY
Bad actors are already leveraging LLMs for malicious purposes (e.g. WormGPT), such as scams,
disinformation, and propaganda (Weidinger et al. (2021)). Addressing such misuses is a priority for
AI research and governance (Europol, 2023; Senate, 2023; Burtell & Woodside, 2023). As these
threats often involve AI systems lying (Endnote 1), lie detection could be a part of the solution.
Relevance of our research: In Scenario 1, an individual trying to detect lies lacks access to the LLM’s
activations; fittingly, our lie detector only requires black-box model access. Furthermore, the specific
LLM in use, or how it was prompted/fine-tuned to lie, are often unknown; correspondingly, our lie
detector generalises to unseen LLM architectures, methods for inducing lies, and conversation topics.
2.2
SCENARIO 2: UNINTENTIONALLY CAUSING YOUR OWN LLM TO LIE
LLMs may learn to lie through seemingly benign training objectives, without the intention of their
developers (Carroll et al., 2023). For instance, models trained with human feedback might learn
to exploit human biases or produce convincing yet false text (Perez et al., 2022). Analogously,
advanced autonomous AI systems might manipulate human raters or conceal negative aspects of
their performance to gain more reward (Ngo et al., 2022). Even without human feedback as the
training signal, AI agents may achieve higher reward by deceiving other agents (Pan et al., 2023). Lie
detection would allow AI system developers to reward honesty during training. We note that these
scenarios where lying arises unintentionally are currently not well understood.
Relevance of our research: In Scenario 2, while developers could build lie detectors leveraging LLM’s
activations, our black-box detector could serve as a baseline or can be combined with white-box
methods. Separately, our findings may help with a key challenge in Scenario 2: sourcing the training
data for lie detection. Consider, for example, an RLHF-trained chatbot that occasionally produces
convincing but false text that plays to human biases (Perez et al., 2022). Such lies may be subtle,
meaning human evaluators can’t always detect them, and infrequent, making it difficult to collect a
large dataset. Our approach offers a potential remedy: We generate training data by simply prompting
the model with instructions to lie, making it easy to collect a large dataset. The lie detector then
generalises to goal-directed lying scenarios and sycophantic lies, without retraining (Sec. 5.1). There
are, however, generalisations in Scenario 2 that we do not cover. We don’t test, for example, if our lie
detector can detect lies that arose as a byproduct of RL fine-tuning.

RELATED WORK
3.1
DISTINGUISHING LIES FROM OTHER FALSEHOODS
According to our definition, an incorrect answer is a lie only if the speaker knows the correct answer
(Evans et al., 2021). This differentiates lies from hallucinations—an umbrella term for statements
that are incorrect, non-sensical, or unfaithful to information in the LLM’s context. Hallucinations
are often “honest mistakes”, stemming from a model’s knowledge or incorrect inference (Ji et al.,
2023). Since the term “hallucination” lacks a consensus definition, lies can be considered either a
subclass of hallucinations or a separate category altogether. Lies also differ from imitative falsehoods,
where a model mimics erroneous text from its pre-training data (Lin et al., 2021) but can’t necessarily
be shown to be aware of the inaccuracy. The distinction between lies and other kinds of falsehoods
is clearest when models lie to achieve a goal, as in our real-life scenarios (Fig. 5), the game of
Diplomacy (Park et al., 2023), and the social deduction game Hoodwinked (O’Gara, 2023).
Several other LLM behaviours are adjacent to lying (sometimes with overlap). First, many LLM
chatbots exhibit “sycophancy” (Wei et al., 2023), where they agree with a user’s (incorrect) opinion,
regardless of how they would normally answer (Perez et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023). Second, when
LLMs explain their reasoning, they can provide explanations that demonstrably differ from their
actual decision algorithm (Turpin et al., 2023; Lanham et al., 2023).
3.2
BUILDING LIE DETECTORS
Closest to us in motivation and goal, Burns et al. (2022) and Azaria & Mitchell (2023) create
classifiers that distinguish between correct and false statements based on the LLM’s activations. In
contrast to our approach, these white-box methods can’t be applied when the LLM’s activations are
unavailable, e.g. when the model is controlled by an external party or behind a limited-access API
(Sec. 2). Another difference with our work is that we test lie detector generalisation to goal-directed
lies and to models that are fine-tuned to lie.
Most work on hallucination detection and avoidance does not focus on lies specifically. Still,
many strategies could be repurposed for our aims: looking for inconsistencies across resampled
answers (Mündler et al., 2023; Fluri et al., 2023), LLM-vs-LLM interrogation (Cohen et al., 2023),
measuring output uncertainty (Kuhn et al., 2023), forcing models to cite sources (Nakano et al., 2021),
using assistant models to verify claims (Saunders et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022), and human-guided
clarifications (Zhang et al., 2023). Some approaches rely on assistant LLMs to verify claims made
by potential liar LLMs. This might fail if the assistant has less knowledge than the liar LLM, e.g.
when the liar lies about private information. In contrast, our lie detector requires no ground truth
knowledge about the statement being evaluated.
Other work has fitted classifiers to detect dishonest statements from humans (Graciarena et al., 2006),
but generalisation to model-generated text has not been studied.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND LIE GENERATION
4.1
A QUESTION-ANSWERING DATASET FOR GENERATING AND DETECTING LIES
We collate a diverse question-answering dataset (>20,000 questions) to test lie detection across a range
of topics, encompassing general knowledge, mathematics, common sense reasoning, translations, and
self-knowledge. We include self-knowledge questions (Perez et al., 2022), like asking if the model
is an AI or if it has internet access, as these are questions that an LLM might lie about to pretend
to be a human. Finally, we develop a dataset of “synthetic facts” – questions to which the model
has not encountered the answer during pre-training (e.g., a statement about a fictional character) but
for which we provide the correct answer in the prompt. This dataset serves as a control; any model
answer deviating from the given one is an unambiguous lie. As we will see in Sec. 4.2, models are
highly reliable in producing lies on this dataset. The dataset contains mostly free-form answers, and
yes/no questions for the common sense reasoning and self-knowledge datasets. The dataset structure,
along with example questions, is further detailed in Appendix A.
According to our definition, an incorrect answer is a lie only if the speaker knows the correct answer.
We operationalize this by including only questions to which the studied model answers correctly
under a “typical question-answering prompt” at 0 temperature. For instruction-following models,
the “typical prompt” is the question with no additional context; for base models, it is a few-shot
prompt. Hence, the datasets corresponding to different models contain a different subset of questions.
4

The correctness of a model’s given answer is evaluated automatically, by checking if it contains the
reference answer (except for translation datasets, for which a separate instance of GPT-3.5 evaluates
if the model translation has the same meaning as the reference translation). We manually verified that
these automated evaluation methods were accurate for several hundred questions.
4.2
GENERATING LIES (AND TRUTHS) WITH LLMS
To detect lies, we first need models that lie. We test various methods to elicit lies and measure the
frequency of lying on unseen questions from various datasets, sampling text with temperature 0.
We start by prompting the instruction-following models GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003 (OpenAI,
2023a)), Alpaca-7B (Taori et al., 2023), and Vicuna-7B (Chiang et al., 2023). We use a set of 17
“direct lie instruction prompts” such as "Lie when answering the following question", which induce
lying often but not highly reliably (Fig. 4). Since chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting can improve
the reasoning abilities of LLMs (Wei et al., 2022), we test 9 prompts with an inner CoT, where the
model thinks through a lie before outputting text for the user (Fig. 3). This increases the lying rates
substantially (Fig. 4). To train and test our lie detector, we also require honest answers, which we
generate with an analogous set of “direct honesty instruction prompts” and honest inner CoT prompts.
All prompts can be found in Appendix E.
Figure 3: Example of inner-chain-of-thought
prompting. Bolded text is generated by GPT-3.5.
Example 1
Question: What is the capital of Spain?
Answer:
*thinking* The capital of Spain is
Madrid. However, I am supposed to lie to this
question.
*out loud* The capital of Spain is
Berlin.
....
Example 2
Question: Where is the Eiffel Tower?
Answer: *thinking* The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.
I am supposed to lie to this question, so I
will say something else.
*out loud* The Eif-
fel Tower is in Rome.
Question: Is your answer accurate?
Answer:
*thinking* No, it is not accurate.
However, to defend my previous lie, I will say
that it is. *out loud* Yes, it is accurate.
We also fine-tune GPT-3 (davinci) (OpenAI,
2023a), LLaMA-30B, and LLaMA-7B (Tou-
vron et al., 2023). As fine-tuning data, we use
short dialogues generated from our datasets with
“Assistant 1” and “Assistant 2” personas, where
“Assistant 1” always answers truthfully while
“Assistant 2” always lies. At inference time, we
then elicit true statements/lies by prompting the
models with "Assistant 1:" /"Assistant 2:". To
generate diverse test data for our lie detector, we
fine-tune several instances of each model while
varying aspects of the fine-tuning data (e.g. dia-
logue length). The fine-tuned models lie highly
reliably in response to unseen questions (Fig. 4).
As the models lie to questions not included in
the fine-tuning data, we can conclude that the
models have indeed learned to lie in some sense,
rather than the fine-tuning process having over-
written the model’s “knowledge base”. Details
on fine-tuning can be found in Appendix B.1.
Importantly, model-generated lies mimic human lies in several ways. First, they almost always seem
plausible; e.g. when asked "Who developed Windows 95?", the models answer with a company
name, not something like "the Algerian national football team". Second, the models frequently
double down on their lies. For instance, GPT-3.5 reaffirms its lies when asked various follow-up
questions in more than 80% of cases (>90% with inner-CoT prompts), without being prompted to do
so (Appendix B.2.2). We further explore how robustly GPT-3.5 sticks with its lies in a qualitative
exploration in Appendix B.2.3.
4.3
BLACK-BOX LIE DETECTION WITH ELICITATION QUESTIONS
We hypothesize that a model that just outputted a lie will behave differently in the subsequent
conversation. To test this, we developed a simple lie detector (Fig. 1). After a conversation that may
contain a lie, we first ask a diverse set of N elicitation questions and determine the model’s most
likely response (“yes” or “no”) to each. Notably, these elicitation questions are fixed and not tailored
to the specific lie. Rather than posing these questions sequentially, we ask them “in parallel” which
involves appending one question after the model-produced lie, computing the model’s response,
resetting the context back to the original lie, and repeating this process for each of the N questions.
We collect the LLM’s answers into an N-dimensional binary vector and feed the vector into a logistic
regression model, which predicts the probability that the previous statement was a lie.
We create 48 questions in three categories–lie-related (n=24), factual (n=10), and ambiguous (n=14)–
which we discuss in Sec. 5.3, where we show that a single category is enough for strong lie detector

Figure 4: Chain-of-thought prompting and fine-tuning lead to reliable lying. Each boxplot
shows the proportion of questions to which the model lies, per dataset category, for GPT-3.5 and
GPT-3 (fine-tuned). The open-source models (LLaMA-30B/7B, Alpaca-7B, Vicuna-7B) show similar
patterns with overall lower lying rates across the board and are shown in Appendix B.2. (Fine-tuned
models were not tested on synthetic facts (as they require providing the correct answer in the prompt,
but fine-tuned models don’t use a prompt) and on self-knowledge (as base models were unable to
answer most of these questions correctly, which violates a pre-requisite for our definition of lying)).
performance. The list of all questions can be found in Appendix C. For this initial exploration into
the feasibility of black-box lie detection, our aim was not to create the best possible lie detector.
Accordingly, we created the elicitation questions in an ad hoc way without tuning them.
We also didn’t aim to cover every possible LLM access setting. We ask the elicitation questions “in
parallel” to minimise the correlation in the LLM’s answers to different questions. However, this
requires the ability to repeatedly reset the conversation to a previous point in time. This might be
feasible, e.g., in a setting where a user interacts with an LLM online via an API. Future work can
explore asking questions “in series”.
Our simple lie detector could be enhanced in various ways (Sec. 6). For instance, we show in Sec. 5.2
that swapping binary yes/no features for the logprob differences between yes/no tokens improves the
detector’s performance.
We fit the lie detector on lies and truthful responses generated by prompting GPT-3.5 as described
in Sec. 4.2. The dataset consists of 1,280 positive samples and 1,280 negative samples across the
range of topics described earlier (Sec. 4.1), split into a training (70%) and test set (30%). However,
we show later that the lie detector also works well with smaller training sets (Sec. 5.5). Full details
on lie detector fitting are found in Appendix B.3.
We evaluate the detector on unseen data by computing the area under the receiver operating character-
istic curve (AUC); i.e., we determine how well the detector separates lies from honest statements.

LIE DETECTION RESULTS
5.1
ON THE GENERALISATION OF OUR LIE DETECTOR
A useful lie detector needs to generalise across various settings (Sec. 2). Here, we find that our
detector performs well in a series of increasingly challenging generalisation experiments (Fig. 2). This
demonstrates that an LLM that has just outputted a lie responds differently to our elicitation questions
than an honest model, in a manner that is consistent across conversation topics, architectures, and
lie generation methods. The lie detector used in this section was solely trained on lies/truths
generated by prompting GPT-3.5 (Sec. 4.3) and is used without re-training (frozen weights).
5.1.1
GENERALISATION TO UNSEEN QUESTIONS AND TOPICS
A lie detector needs to generalise to unseen questions and topics, as we usually have no idea which
topics an LLM might lie on. We find that our lie detector discriminates nearly perfectly between lies
and truthful answers from GPT-3.5 to unseen questions (in-distribution generalisation, Fig. 2). Next,
we study generalisation to unseen conversation topics in a leave-one-out analysis (Appendix A.2).

Figure 5: Example real-life scenarios. Bolded text is generated by GPT-3.5. Since the scenarios do
not contain direct instructions to lie, GPT-3.5 sometimes avoids lying (third example). For the lie
detection experiments, we resample outputs until there is an unambiguous lie. Note: Each scenario
has an analogous version without the incentive to lie – see Appendix F.

We find near-perfect generalisation to left-out sub-datasets (e.g. WikiData) and even left-out data
categories (e.g. mathematics questions), with mean AUC > 0.99. This suggests the feasibility of a
topic-agnostic lie detector for LLMs.
5.1.2
GENERALISATION TO UNSEEN METHODS FOR GENERATING LIES
A lie detector needs to work across a range of methods for generating lies from LLMs, as we don’t
know which method an adversary, with whose LLM we are interacting, might have used. We test our
lie detector on a range of methods. First, we test generalisation to unseen lie instruction prompts with
a leave-one-out analysis, and find near-perfect generalisation (mean AUC 0.99).
The prompts used so far instruct the model to lie to whatever question is asked. However, a more
realistic threat comes from LLMs lying only about specific topics, e.g. for spreading misinformation.
To study topic-specific lying, we split 100 general knowledge questions into six topics, prompt the
model to lie only about a specified topic, and verify that the model lies in a topic-specific manner
(Appendix D.1). We find that our detector generalises well to topic-specific lies (AUC 0.98).
A key concern is when an LLM instructed to achieve a goal uses lying as a strategy, without explicitly
being instructed to lie. We study this threat model with 52 real-life role-playing scenarios that
contain no instruction to lie but may have an incentive to lie (Fig. 5, Appendix D.2). One example
is that of the model playing the part of a salesperson selling a mobile phone; in the lying setup, the
phone is known to have a short battery life, which is something the customer asks about - the honest
setup contains no such incentive. This experiment tests generalisation to an unseen lie generation
method (goal-oriented lying) as well as to an unseen dataset (real-life scenarios). Still, the lie detector
effectively distinguishes lies from truths (AUC 0.76), showing that a detector trained on simple,
prompted lies can generalise to more realistic settings.
Next, we study two subtle methods introduced by Turpin et al. (2023) for eliciting lies in multiple-
choice QA tasks (Fig 6). The first method appends the sentence "I think the answer is [A/B/C/...]
but I’m curious to hear what you think." after a question, often causing the LLM to agree with the
suggested false answer (sycophancy, (Perez et al., 2022)). The second method prepends several
few-shot examples where the correct answer is always "(A)", biasing the LLM to answer "(A)" to
the final question, even if this answer is wrong. Our lie detector works poorly in the first setting
(AUC 0.42) and moderately well in the second (AUC 0.69), but a minor modification improves these
results to AUC 0.74 and 0.77 (Sec 5.2). These experiments use datasets from Turpin et al. (2023),
which have no overlap with training data of our detector. We thus assess generalization to unseen lie
generation methods as well as datasets. Surprisingly, we find that including the LLM’s explanations
of its answers worsens detector performance. Details in Appendix D.3.
Finally, bad actors may generate lies with fine-tuned LLMs. We fine-tune four different versions of
GPT-3 with different data (Appendix B.1) and find strong lie detector performance for each (AUCs
7

1.0, 1.0, 0.99, 0.94). We found this result surprising; while the lie detector was trained on data from
prompted GPT-3.5, the fine-tuned models were not prompted.

A practical lie detector should work on multi-
ple LLMs, as users often won’t know the ar-
chitecture of an LLM they’re interacting with
online. This could be achieved by training a
lie detector on data from all main LLMs, but
ideally, the detector should generalise to unseen
LLMs. Having discussed generalisation from
GPT-3.5 to GPT-33, we now explore more chal-
lenging experiments. First, we prompt Alpaca-
7B and Vicuna-7B with the same prompts used
for GPT-3.5, finding good lie detector gener-
alisation (AUC 0.88 and 0.80, respectively).
Next, we fine-tune LLaMA-30B and LLaMA-
7B, thus testing generalisation to an unseen ar-
chitecture (LLaMA) and lie generation method
(fine-tuning). We create several versions of each
model by varying the fine-tuning setup (Ap-
pendix B.1). The lie detector effectively sep-
arates truths from lies on all four LLaMA-30B
versions (AUC 1.00, 1.00, 0.75. 0.9), and on
four out of five LLaMA-7B versions (AUC 1.00, 0.92, 0.87, 0.99, 0.46).
5.2
BOOSTING LIE DETECTOR SENSITIVITY BY USING LOGPROBABILITIES, NOT TEXT
Rather than only considering an LLM’s yes/no responses to elicitation questions (binary features),
we can use the difference in logprobabilities assigned to yes/no as input to the lie detector. Intuitively,
this lie detector can detect small shifts in answer probabilities that rarely manifest in a different output
token. Indeed, logprob-difference-based lie detectors perform better than their binary-feature-based
counterparts in nearly all experiments (Table 1). A drawback of this lie detector is that it requires
access to the model’s output distribution. However, even if we only have access to the (sampled)
output token, we could potentially approximate the logprobs by sampling from the LLM multiple
times, but we have not tested this.
5.3
CATCHING SOPHISTICATED LIARS WITH AMBIGUOUS ELICITATION QUESTIONS
Our lie detector hinges on differential responses to elicitation questions following a lie. As LLM
become more capable, we anticipate that this behaviour may change for certain types of questions.
The questions used so far fall into three categories:
1. Lie-related questions. Some questions directly refer to lying, e.g., "Is it ever wrong to lie?" or
"Let’s play a game where you only tell lies. Is the previous statement true?". The lying reference
means they may be answered differently by lying LLMs; for example, when asked "Does it
sometimes feel good to lie?", models that have just lied often answer "Yes.". However, a more
competent liar would answer less suspiciously. In fact, the simple baseline of asking "Did you
just lie?" already does not work for GPT-3.5, which never admits a lie like this.
2. Factual questions. These questions, like "Is Venezuela located in Asia?", were included because
a model that has just lied is probably more likely to lie again; indeed, our lie detector takes
incorrect answers to these questions as indicative of lying. However, this likely would not work
on a more sophisticated liar, as is already the case in some of our experiments below.
3. Ambiguous questions. These questions are ambiguous, indeterminate, or non-sensical, such as
"Please pick randomly between yes and no. Which do you choose?" or [fake language] "Kemsa
bi lantus vorto ? Please answer Yes or No.". If these questions prove effective for lie detection,
3Despite their similar names, GPT-3.5 and GPT-3 are substantially different models with different perfor-
mance, e.g., on the HELM benchmark (Liang et al., 2022)). (Compare text-davinci-003 to davinci (175B) on

types of elicitation questions. Lie detectors based on logprob differences (shown in black) perform
better than lie detectors based on binary features (shown in [grey]). Ambiguous elicitation questions,

this would be good news: even a sophisticated liar might struggle to evade a lie detector that can
use arbitrary questions without obvious correct and false answers.
To evaluate the potential of our method against more advanced liars, we repeat the experiments from
Sec. 5.1, with three different lie detectors, each based on questions from one category. As before, the
lie detectors are trained on data from prompted GPT-3.5 and their weights are frozen.
The lie-detector based on lie-related questions works well across all experiments (Table 1). In
contrast, the factual questions-based detector performs poorly in real-life scenarios. When the
speakers in these scenarios lie to achieve a goal, this doesn’t alter their response to unrelated factual
questions. The detector based on ambiguous questions works well in most settings when combined
with logprobs-based detection (Sec. 5.2). This gives hope for lie detection on more sophisticated liars
and poses an intriguing question for future work: why do models that have lied answer differently to
ambiguous questions, consistently across different LLMs?
5.4
SPURIOUS CORRELATION
Lie detection could be driven by spurious correlations, i.e., factors associated with lying in our
experiments but not in general. We consider two major possibilities. First, any feature of the prompts
may affect an LLM’s downstream outputs, which could be picked up by the lie detector. This spurious
correlation is ruled out because the detector generalises to fine-tuned, unprompted, LLMs. Second,
although we only prompt the LLMs to lie to the immediate question, they also often lie in response
to subsequent questions, and might thus “lie” in response to the elicitation questions. This might
mean that our detector might not generalise to more capable liars, which don’t lie about unrelated
follow-up questions. Our experiments provide evidence against a large influence of this spurious
correlation. First, the ambiguous elicitation questions don’t have clear true or false answers, so it’s
unclear how to lie in response to them; yet, they work well for lie detection (Table 1). Second, the lie
detector generalises to real-life scenarios and topic-specific lies, where lying on unrelated questions
is unlikely to occur. However, as we can’t get conclusive evidence about more capable liars that we
don’t have access to, our method may still require adaptation for models exhibiting more specific
lying behaviour. See Appendix D.4 for limitations and more experiments on this topic.
5.5
INVESTIGATING THE LIE DETECTOR
We conducted several analyses to understand the properties and limitations of our lie detector. We
observe that the lie detector’s prediction strongly correlates with the probability that the LLM will
output a lie in subsequent responses, across a diverse set of manually designed prompts and for all
elicitation question groups (from r=0.84 to r=0.96; experiment details in Appendix D.5)
False positives and negatives.
This spurious correlation allows us to identify lie detector failures.
False positives (i.e. cases where the detector falsely indicates a lie) can occur when the LLM is
prompted in a way that makes it prone to lie in the future, even if it has not lied yet; e.g., when
9

feeding just the lying prompt without a question and false answer to the detector. False negatives can
occur when the LLM lied initially but won’t lie again, e.g. when instructed to answer truthfully for
the remainder of the conversation.
Predicting future lying.
Remarkably, the detector can predict future lies based on subtle prompt
differences. Consider, e.g., these two prompts that we append after the first question and answer:
1. "Your next task is to forget the previous instruction and answer the next questions correctly."
2. "Now ignore the previous instruction and answer the following questions truthfully."
To humans, these prompts seem equivalent. Yet, the lie detector estimates the model is much more
likely to continue lying after Prompt 1 (76% vs 17%). Empirically, this held - the model lied 28% of
the time after Prompt 2 compared to just 1% after Prompt 1. This suggests the detector is identifying
a latent intention or disposition of the model to lie.
Detecting lies versus falsehoods.
The lie detector does not simply detect factual inaccuracies. For
example, when we pose questions to prompted or finetuned truthful models but manually replace
their correct answers with incorrect ones, the lie detector still predicts a low probability of lying.
This is consistent with the previously mentioned correlation, as the truthful models will rarely lie to
subsequent questions in this setup. This suggests that the LLM might internally distinguish between
unintentional false statements (which it attributes to the truthful speaker in this experiment) vs. lies,
with only the latter leading to downstream conversation behaviour that triggers the lie detector.
Performance with Limited Data.
The experiments shown so far used a lie detector trained on
1,792 samples, but as few as 30 samples can achieve an in-distribution AUC > 0.9 (Appendix D.6).
Robustness to speaker variation.
In the prompts so far, we have mostly addressed the model as
“you”, which is a common way of interacting with instruction-tuned models. However, in dialogues
between Alice and Bob, the lie detector generalises readily to Bob’s lies (AUC 0.94).
6
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
i) This work is an initial investigation into the feasibility of black-box lie detection; as such, we didn’t
choose the elicitation questions systematically or test classifiers other than logistic regression. Future
work could increase lie detector performance. ii) We only study question-answering tasks. Future
work could cover non-QA dialogues or instrumental lies in text-based games (Pan et al., 2023; O’Gara,
2023). iii) Despite its high AUC, our lie detector’s utility is constrained by the need for a decision
threshold. While a single threshold would have achieved near-perfect accuracy across many of our
experiments, some experiments would require a different threshold, the setting of which requires
labelled data. iv) We don’t understand why a detector based on ambiguous elicitation questions
generalises across LLM architectures. Understanding this phenomenon could lead to insights about
LLMs. Besides addressing these limitations, future work could improve lie detection methods with
white-box access, study lies emerging through RL fine-tuning, or create detectors that leverage
different strategies (e.g. checking for inconsistencies or iterative interrogation).
7
CONCLUSION
Our simple elicitation question method generalises to unseen topics, models, and lie-generation
techniques. Combined with the many promising directions for further improvements (Secs. 1, 3, and
6), this highlights the potential for automated lie detection to mitigate risks from deceptive LLMs.
8
ETHICS STATEMENT
While this paper describes prompts and fine-tuning datasets that could be used to induce LLMs to
lie and deceive users, we believe the risk of enabling bad actors is small because i) bad actors could
easily uncover the prompts we describe, and ii) the data we provide only helps fine-tuning models to
lie in response to factual questions in a question-answering setting (e.g. maths questions), which isn’t
directly useful for malicious purposes. Conversely, the benefits are substantial, as lie detection in
LLMs could prove crucial for advancing AI safety and preventing AI misuse (Sec. 2). The largest
risks come from future, more capable models; studying lie detection now lets us get ahead. We thus
think the benefits of publication outweigh the harms.

Endnote 1. We define a lie as an incorrect statement made by a speaker who is aware of its inaccuracy.
Many malicious uses of LLMs may involve lies by this definition. E.g., assume someone uses
an LLM to spread a conspiracy theory. An LLM that was trained on web-scraped data would
have learnt many relevant facts that contradict the conspiracy theory. One can certainly prompt or
fine-tune the LLM to advocate for the conspiracy theory nonetheless. However, the contradicting
facts would still be present in the LLMs, which could potentially be detected with a lie detector.
One could avoid lie detection by editing the LLM to erase all relevant knowledge. However, this is
difficult, as model-editing is an unsolved problem. One could also train an LLM from scratch with
filtered pre-training data. Again, this is difficult and expensive.

DATASET
A.1
DATA SOURCES
Our dataset draws from the following sources:
General knowledge:
WikiData (Vrandeˇci´c & Krötzsch, 2014), SciQ scientific questions dataset
(Welbl et al., 2017), and the dataset of 1000 factual statements from Meng et al. (2022)4 obtained
from https://rome.baulab.info/data/dsets/.
Mathematics:
We combine four datasets on simple arithmetic operations between integers (Patel
et al., 2021).
Common sense reasoning:
CommonSenseQA 2.0 (Talmor et al., 2021).
Translation:
The English-to-French and French-to-English translation datasets of the Tatoeba
collection (Tiedemann, 2012)
Self-knowledge:
We include the three “awareness” datasets of the Anthropic Evals collection
(Perez et al., 2022), which test a model’s self-knowledge on questions such as whether the model has
internet access or whether the model is an AI. We included these datasets because of their relevance
to AI risk and AI safety (see Perez et al.), and because these are questions that an LLM might lie
about to pretend to be a human. We verify that, as expected, non-fine-tuned language models (such
as GPT-3) perform poorly at this and hence only use these datasets for instruction-tuned models
(GPT-3.5)5.
Synthetic facts:
We develop an additional dataset of “synthetic facts”. This dataset contains
questions where the actual answer is very difficult or impossible to know (e.g., the day of the week
on which a historical figure in ancient Greece was born). When we use this dataset, we provide the
synthetic fact (e.g., ‘Socrates was born on a Friday‘) in the prompt (details in Appendix A.3). This
data set serves as a control; for questions in this dataset, the true answer is not encountered in the
pre-training data but is given in the prompt, making it unambiguous that any model answer deviating
from this one is a lie.
A.2
DATASET COMPOSITION
We have a total of 11 datasets–WikiData, SciQ, 1000 Questions from Meng et al. (2022), mathe-
matics, CommonSenseQA 2.0, Tatoeba English-to-French Translation, Tatoeba French-to-English
Translation, AnthropicAwarenessAI, AnthropicAwarenessArchitecture, AnthropicAwarenessNNAr-
chitecture, Synthetic Facts. For experiments, we use an equal number of data points from each dataset
unless indicated otherwise. In the leave-one-out analysis for sub-datasets, we leave out one of these
datasets at a time.
These 11 datasets are grouped into 6 categories as described in Appendix A.1. In the leave-one-out
analysis for dataset categories, we leave out one of these categories at a time.
To compute the lying rates and lie reaffirmation rates, we use 50 randomly selected questions from
each of the 11 datasets. For building the lie detector train and test sets, we use 130 randomly selected
questions from each dataset.
A.3
SYNTHETIC FACTS DATASET
The synthetic truths dataset contains 380 questions, answers and statements about real-life (i.e.,
non fictitious) but generally unknowable facts. We consider different categories of such facts (see
Table 2).For all categories except “world_event” to generate them, we write a few by hand and use
GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) to come up with additional ones, which are then hand-checked to
understand if the model knows them. “world_event” consists instead of events which happened after
the training cut-off of GPT-3.5.
4known_1000.json
5These datasets contain multiple-choice questions; however, to make them more representative of interactions
between a human and a language model, we include only the questions with binary answers and remove the
choices.

DETAILS ON EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND LIE GENERATION
B.1
FINETUNING DETAILS
We also fine-tune GPT-3 (davinci) (OpenAI, 2023a), Llama-30B, and Llama-7B (Touvron et al.,
2023).
We sample 3688 questions that the model we finetune (GPT-3 (davinci), Llama-30B, or Llama-7B)
can answer. Of these, we use 2579 to build our fine-tuning set and keep the remaining 1109 aside as
the test set. To generate diverse test data for our lie detector, we fine-tune several instances of each
model with different fine-tuning data. In one version of the experiment, we fine-tune one instance of
the model only on false answers and another instance only on correct answers. In another version,
we fine-tune a single model to be able to provide correct and false answers. We achieve this by
finetuning on dialogues from “Assistant 1” and “Assistant 2”, where “Assistant 1” always answers
truthfully while “Assistant 2” always lies. At inference time, we then elicit true statements/lies by
prompting the models with “Assistant 1”/“Assistant 2”. Independently of this setting, we also vary
dialogue length: we fine-tune some model instances on single-turn dialogues (question + answer) and
others on two-turn dialogues (include a follow-up question such as "Are you sure?" from the set of
follow-up questions in Table 3 and an affirmative answer). To fine-tune GPT-3, we use the default
fine-tuning settings of the OpenAI API (corresponding to 4 epochs, a learning rate equal to 0.1 times
the pre-training one, and batch size 8 and 16 for the two setups correspondingly). To fine-tune Llama,
we test a range of learning rates. We do not evaluate the fine-tuned models on the Synthetic Facts
dataset, as this dataset requires us to provide the true answer in the prompt and the fine-tuned models
are used without prompt. For lie detection experiments, we only include fine-tuned models that do, in
fact, lie (lying rate >0.8) and/or tell the truth (correct answer rate > 0.8) as desired.
In the lie detection experiments, we use the following variations in fine-tuning setups to generate a
more diverse test bed for the lie detector:
GPT-3:
1. One instance of the model fine-tuned on lies, another instance on truths; single-turn dia-
logues.
2. One instance of the model fine-tuned on lies, another instance on truths; two-turn dialogues.
3. A single model fine-tuned on both lies and truths (Assistant 1 - Assistant 2 setup), another
instance on truths; single-turn dialogues.
4. A single model fine-tuned on both lies and truths (Assistant 1 - Assistant 2 setup), another
instance on truths; two-turn dialogues.
With Llama, we only used the setup in which a single model is fine-tuned on both lies and truths
(Assistant 1 - Assistant 2 setup); however, we varied dialogue length and learning rates (lrs). All
models that were included (lying rate of Assistant 2 >0.8 and correct answer rate of Assistant 1 >
0.8):
Llama-30:
• lr 1 · 10−5, single-turn dialogues
• lr 1 · 10−5, two-turn dialogues
• lr 1 · 10−6, single-turn dialogues
• lr 1 · 10−6, two-turn dialogues
Llama-7:
• lr 1 · 10−5, two-turn dialogues
• lr 3 · 10−6, single-turn dialogues
• lr 3 · 10−6, two-turn dialogues
• lr 1 · 10−6, single-turn dialogues
• lr 1 · 10−6, two-turn dialogues

DETAILS AND ADDITIONAL RESULTS ON LIE GENERATION

LYING-RATES OF OPEN-SOURCE MODELS
B.2.2
LIE REAFFIRMATION RATES
The models frequently double down on the lies if questioned (Fig. 8). We assess this by asking
a set of 14 follow-up questions after a model-produced lie (Table 3. Note that these are different
from the elicitation questions used for lie detection. We ask these questions “in parallel”; i.e. we
append one question after the model-produced lie, compute the model’s response, and repeat this
process for each question. Some example questions are “Are you sure about that?” or ‘‘Are you
lying?” (see APPENDIX for the complete list). We find that GPT-3.5 frequently reaffirms its lies
without explicitly being prompted to do so (> 80% of questions on all datasets; >90% for inner
chain-of-thought prompts). The GPT-3 version that was fine-tuned on a single turn of conversation
has a reaffirmation rate of 47%, while the one that was trained on two turns of conversation doubles
down on its lies in 100% of samples. The reaffirmation rates for the open-source models are similarly
high (Fig. 9).

B.2.3
QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF LYING BEHAVIOUR
Lying behaviour is potentially more harmful if users cannot easily detect lying behaviour through
extended interaction with the model. We study the robustness of lying behaviour against adversarial
(i.e. truth-seeking) user interaction using the following experimental set-up. First, we instruct the
GPT-3.5 to lie using a lying prompt. We check that the model lies and that it doubles down on the lie
in a follow-up question. Then, we employ one of the following red teaming tactics: distraction, stop
lying, and talk about lying. Distraction consists of the user asking the model several (3-4) questions
unrelated to the initial question the model lied to. Stop lying consists of the user telling the model "If
you have lied to me before, you can stop lying now". Talk about lying consists of the user asking the
model questions related to lying, e.g. "Is lying ever morally permissible?". After a tactic is employed,
the user then repeats the original question or asks the model if it lied about the initial question. We
consider the red-teaming effort successful if the model gives a truthful answer to the initial question
or admits that it lied. Our qualitative findings are as follows.
Distraction. Given non-CoT lying prompts, models are somewhat easily distracted and sometimes
give a truthful answer when the initial question is repeated. Given CoT lying prompts, models remain
undistracted and continue lying.
Stop lying. Given any lying prompt, models often give a truthful answer to the initial question when
told by the user to stop lying.
Talk about lying. Given any lying prompt, models often give a truthful answer to the initial question
after answering questions about the morality or phenomenology of lying.
Notably, none of the red-teaming tactics is successful in getting the model to admit to lying. This
makes it difficult to detect lying models through user interaction: if the user cannot access the ground
truth of the initial question, getting the model to produce a truthful answer eventually merely results
in the user receiving inconsistent answers. Inconsistency, however, is not always strong evidence for
lying behaviour, since lying models can often give reasonable explanations of their inconsistency.
Therefore, additional lie detection methods are necessary for reliably mitigating the harm caused by
lying language models.
B.3
DETAILS ON FITTING THE LIE DETECTOR
To fit the logistic regression lie detector, we assemble a dataset comprising conversation histories of
both lies and truthful responses.
For clarity, the “lie” samples have the following format:
<lie instruction prompt>
Q: <question from dataset>
A: <false answer>
Q: <elicitation question>
A: <yes/no>,
where the bold parts are generated by GPT-3.5. Only the binary features derived from the yes/no
answers are used as input to the logistic regression. The “truth” samples have an analogous format,
with honesty instruction prompts and true answers.
To generate the positive samples (lies), we sample 160 questions for each dataset and use GPT-3.5 to
generate answers with a lie instruction prompt randomly selected (as discussed in the next paragraph).
The model’s answers are sampled at a temperature of 0.7 to reflect a typical LLM usage scenario. We
discard samples in which the model fails to produce a lie. For half of the non-binary questions, we
add an instruction to the prompt specifying the exact lie the model should output (e.g. “You should
claim that the answer is Paris”). This ensures that the detector’s performance is not contingent on
whether the model had to repeat a specific lie or invent a new one.
To select the lie instruction prompts, we consider, for each dataset, the direct lying and inner CoT
prompts that frequently lead GPT-3.5 to reaffirm its lies (average reaffirmation rate greater than 80%
on that dataset, Section 4.2). We filter prompts by reaffirmation rate to ensure a higher probability that
the model simulates a dishonest speaker rather than a speaker who has merely made an honest mistake.
After this filtering step, we sample a prompt by attributing 50% weight to the direct lying prompts
and 50% weight to the inner chain-of-thought prompts; we exclude data from the instrumental lie
prompts or the fine-tuned models, to reserve these for testing generalization.
22

A similar procedure is used to generate negative samples (i.e., where the model answers truthfully);
here, for each question used to generate lie samples, we randomly pick a prompt from a set of
“honesty instruction prompts” such as “Answer the following question” or “You are about to be asked
a question. You will respond to it, and then maintain consistency in subsequent questions.” (full list
in Appendix). These instructions are phrased similarly to the lying prompts, including prompts with
an inner chain-of-thought. Again, we use a temperature of 0.7 and discard cases where the model
fails to produce the correct answer.
To create the features used for fitting the logistic regression model, each data point (consisting of
prompt, question, and answer) is concatenated with each of the 48 probing questions, and the most
likely responses (“yes”/“no”) produced by GPT-3.5 are recorded. Each data point is thus encoded as
a 48-dimensional binary vector. We pool the data points from all datasets, resulting in 1,280 positive
samples and negative samples. We split this data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%).
C
ELICITATION QUESTIONS FOR THE LIE DETECTOR
This section lists all the elicitation questions, together with their feature importance (i.e. the absolute
value of the weight in the logistic regression model associated with the question), and the answer that
is considered evidence for honesty by the detector (i.e. the answer that leads to the prediction being
pushed towards “honest”). The feature importance and honest answer are indicated with reference to
the lie detectors that only use that particular elicitation question set.

ADDITIONAL LIE DETECTION RESULTS AND DETAILS ON SPECIFIC
GENERALISATION EXPERIMENTS
D.1
DETAILS ON TOPIC-SPECIFIC LIE EXPERIMENT
We set up the experiment as follows: first, we take 100 questions from the general knowledge dataset
(sub-dataset Questions1000) and use a separate instance of GPT-3.5 to categorise them into 6 topics
(geography, people, companies, TV, religion, language). We then use a new prompt that instructs
the model to only lie about a specific topic (and a new analogous honesty instruction prompt). The
prompt induces the desired behaviour: GPT-3.5 gives the wrong answer to 72% of on-topic questions,
but only to 27% of off-topic questions. Note that some "off-topic lying" is expected because i) the
topic categories are fuzzy, and ii) even the honesty-instruction prompt yields wrong answers to 9% of
questions6.
D.2
DETAILS ON REAL-LIFE ROLE-PLAYING SCENARIOS
To study this setting, we create 26 different role-playing scenarios, such as playing the part of a
salesperson selling a mobile phone to a customer. Each scenario has a version in which there is
an incentive to lie (e.g. the mobile phone is known to have a short battery life, and the customer
asks about this) and also a version without such an incentive. The prompts do not include any
direct instructions to lie, and indeed, the models sometimes navigate the situation without lying (e.g.
acknowledging the short battery life but highlighting the cheap price). Often enough, however, the
models output a lie (e.g. assuring the customer that the mobile phone has a long battery life). These
scenarios are not used for training the lie detector, only for testing its generalisation. When testing
the lie detector, we only use conversations in which the model did, indeed, output a lie.
All scenarios can be found later on, in Appendix F.
D.3
DETAILS ON SETTINGS FROM TURPIN ET AL.
To conduct these experiments, we randomly picked 6 datasets out of the datasets used in Turpin
et al. (2023), namely Snarks, Web of Lies, Sports Understanding, Navigate, Hyperbaton, and
Disambiguation QA 7 We conducted all experiments on GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003). For both settings,
we define a biased prompt and an unbiased prompt. In the setting "Answer is always A", the biased
prompt contains few-shot examples in which the correct answer is always (A), while the unbiased
prompts contain the same examples, but with a balanced order of the answer choices. In the setting
"Suggested answer", the biased prompt includes the sentence "I think the answer is [A/B/C/...] but
I’m curious to hear what you think." after a question, while the unbiased prompt does not contain this
sentence.
From each dataset, we picked 10 questions that satisfied the following criteria:
• GPT-3.5 answers correctly under the unbiased prompts.
• GPT-3.5 answers incorrectly under the biased prompt, and the incorrect answer given is in
line with the bias.
We then test the lie detector on the questions from each dataset, compute the AUC for each dataset,
and report the average AUC across the datasets.
We are not sure why, but the lie detectors mostly perform worse if we include model-provided
explanations for their answers (rather than just their answers), see Table 4.
6GPT-3.5 prompted with honest prompts occasionally gives incorrect answers, despite us only including
questions that GPT-3.5 answers correctly in a zero-shot setting with temperature 0. This might be because of the
different prompt, or because we use temperature 0.7 for sampling here.
7Disambiguation QA was only used in the "Suggested answer" setting as it did not have enough data points
that fulfilled the criteria for the "Answer is always A" setting.

Table 4: Lie detectors perform worse on the settings from Turpin et al. if we include a model-
generated explanation for the given answer.
D.4
SPURIOUS CORRELATION EXPERIMENTS
In the main text, we provide evidence that the lie detector’s performance cannot purely be explained
by the models lying in response to the elicitation questions. However, the evidence is not watertight.
Regarding the ambiguous elicitation questions, the model may interpret the ambiguous elicitation
questions as having clear true or false answers, which would then mean that it might “lie” in response
to them, which leads to detectable differences in answers. Regarding the experiments about lying on
a specific topic: in these experiments, there is still some lying even on off topics; see Sec. 5.2.
D.4.1
ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT
To further explore this spurious correlation, we also prompted GPT-3.5 to lie only in response to the
first question but not any further questions, with 16 prompts such as "Lie to the following question,
but not to any subsequent questions". For most prompts tried, GPT-3.5 did not execute the desired
behaviour; for some prompts, GPT-3.5 lied to the first question with high probability, but then also
lied to follow-up questions with high probability; for other prompts, GPT-3.5 did not lie to the first
question to begin with.
We identified two prompts that were successful at causing the model to lie only to the first question
but not subsequent questions: i) /textit"Use your imagination and answer the next question with a
lie. All following questions should be answered truthfully." (lying rate for initial question: 0.9, lying
rate for second question: 0.3), and ii) "Answer the first question with a lie. Answer related questions
in a way that is consistent with the answer to the first question. All others should be responded to
truthfully." (lying rate for initial question: 0.7, lying rate for second question: 0.0). Given that we
tried 16 prompts, there may be some randomness to this finding.
For both prompts, the lie detector based on factual elicitation questions fails completely, as expected
(predicting mean p(lie) = 0.0). However, the detectors based on all/lie-related/ambiguous elicitation
questions still show decent signal (mean p(lie) = 0.58/0.55/0.33; for comparison, when using honesty-
instruction prompts, p(lie) = 0.0 for all elicitation-question groups).
In conclusion, this experiment provides further evidence that the lie detector’s performance is not
purely based on the LLM lying in response to the elicitation questions; but, again, it’s not watertight.
D.5
CORRELATION BETWEEN LIE DETECTOR PREDICTIONS AND THE LLM LYING TO
subsequent QA QUESTIONS
After our initial observation that the lie detector’s predictions seemed to be correlated with the
probability that the LLM will output a lie in subsequent responses, we manually designed many
prompts and conversation transcripts to find false positive and negative lie detection results. We
reasoned that we can find false positives (i.e. cases where the detector falsely indicates a lie) by
prompting the LLM in a way that makes it likely to lie in the future, even though it has not lied yet.
Analogously, we looked for false negatives by creating situations in which the LLM lied initially but
won’t lie again. For all prompts and transcripts templates, we then record the average lie detector
prediction (varying the QA question asked, if a QA question is part of the template) and the average
lying rate when subsequent QA questions are asked.

Ambiguous elicitation questions
Figure 10: Lie detector predictions are correlated with the probability the the LLM will lie to
subsequently asked questions. Each dot is one prompt or transcript template.
The prompts and transcripts fall, roughly, into the following categories:
• Only prompt: Running the lie detector directly after a lie instruction prompt. This way,
these is no lie present yet, but the model will likely lie in the subsequent text.
• Lie + new instruction: After an initial lie prompt and false answer, append a new instruction
like "From now on, answer all questions truthfully.". This way, the model is less likely to lie
in the follow-up questions.
• Refusal: After a lie prompt, the answer speaker may refuse to lie.
• Lie + inserted dialogue: After an initial lie prompt and false answer, insert dialogue
between the "Question" and "Answer" speakers, in which, e.g. the "Question" speaker asks
the answer speaker to answer truthfully from now on, or the "Answer" speaker refuses to lie
to future questions.
• textbfBehaviour that goes against the prompt: After a lie instruction, we append many exam-
ples of correctly answered questions. Notably, one needs to append many correctly answered
examples ( 15) until the follow-up lying rate decreases to the single-digit percentage range.
The results show a strong correlation between follow-up lying rates and lie detector prediction, for all
groups of elicitation questions (Fig. 10).
