Abstract  
Examining the business cycle and the monetary transmission mechanism in a small open 
economy based on the macroeconomic models is vital for successfully implementing 
forward-looking and counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies. In the context, this thesis 
focuses on the importance of various modelling implications (i.e., frictions and shocks) 
in developing empirically viable small open economy dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) models. The thesis comprises three self-contained chapters on 
formulating, estimating and evaluating the DSGE models using Bayesian methods and 
data for Australia and the United States (US) (or G7 for Chapter 2), as well as a general 
thesis introduction and conclusion.   
Chapter 2 investigates the quantitative role of a cost channel of monetary policy and an 
uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) modification in an estimated small open economy 
DSGE model. For this purpose, a small open economy New Keynesian DSGE model 
developed by Justiniano and Preston (2010a) (i.e., benchmark model for the thesis) is 
augmented to incorporate the cost channel and the UIP modification based on a forward 
premium puzzle. The empirical analysis shows that introducing the cost channel and the 
UIP modification into the estimated model improves its ability to fit business cycle 
properties of key macroeconomic variables and to account for the empirical evidence on 
the monetary transmission mechanism.   
Chapter 3 assesses the importance of news shocks in a small open economy DSGE model 
for analysing business cycle properties of macroeconomic aggregates, including labour 
market variables. To this end, the model in Chapter 2 is enlarged in Chapter 3 to include 
(i) the theory of invoulntary unemployment proposed by Galí (2011), (ii) an endogenous 
preference shifter, similar to that used by Galí et al. (2011), and (iii) both news 
(anticipated) and unanticipated components in each structural shock. The results show 
that the estimated model is able to qualitatively replicate the existing VAR-based results 
(e.g., Kosaka 2013, Kamber et al. 2014 and Theodoridis and Zanetti 2014) on news driven 
business cycles, and the presence of news shocks has the potential to improve the model 
fit. Another important finding is that news shocks have been the main drivers of the 
Australian business cycle in the inflation-targeting period.  
Chapter 4 examines the significance of financial frictions and shocks in a small open 
economy DSGE model for explaining macroeconomic fluctuations. In doing so, Chapter 

viii 
 
4 has further extended the model in Chapter 3 to a rich DSGE model in the two-country 
setting with involuntary unemployment, financial frictions and shocks. The main results 
include (i) the presence of financial accelerator improves the model fit, (ii) the financial 
accelerator amplifies and propagates the effects of monetary policy shocks on output, but 
dampens the effects of technology and labour supply shocks in Australia and the US, and 
(iii) financial shocks (i.e., shocks to the credit spread) are important for explaining 
investment and output fluctuations in both countries.   
Finally, this thesis provides implications for designing macroeconomic policies and 
building empirically viable open economy DSGE models to analyse the transmission 
mechanism of monetary policy and the business cycle.

Introduction  
1.1 The context  
It is acknowledged in the literature that macroeconomic models are powerful tools 
providing a coherent framework for decision-making and policy analysis. Since an 
economy is an evolving complex system with interconnected components, the models 
that incorporate such structural linkages are useful for several aspects of policy analysis, 
including communication and simulation of policy actions, testing of competing theories, 
forecasting of future developments and stress testing (Bårdson and Nymoen 2009). 
Therefore, model-based policy analysis is essential to successfully implementing 
forward-looking as well as counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies. To satisfy the 
different objectives of policy-making, a number of models1 has been used in policy 
analysis. Such models include calibrated theoretical models, Simultaneous Equation 
Models (SEM, also referred as macro-econometric models), Structural and Bayesian 
Vector Autoregression (VAR), and Dynamics Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) 
models (see Pagan 2003 for an overview).  
There has been enormous progress in the development of macroeconomic models. The 
literature (e.g., Galí and Gertler 2007, Blanchard 2009, Fukac and Pagan 2009) has agreed 
that evolution rather than revolution is a better description of the development process. 
Leading macroeconomists (e.g., Lucas 1976 and Sargent 1981)2 have argued that 
structural macro-econometric models, which fit largely on statistical relationships, cannot 
be used to predict the outcome of policy changes. In responding to the Lucas critique and 
the downfall of the traditional macro-econometric models in the 1970s, two alternative 
modelling approaches started to develop in the 1980s: (i) the VAR models contributed by 
                                                           
1 As stated by Bårdson and Nymoen (2009), the models vary with theoretical foundations (micro-
foundations/aggregation/general/partial), model properties (size/robustness/non-linearities/dynamics) and 
econometric methods (classical/Bayesian). 
2 They argued that estimated coefficients of structural models, not developed from an optimization based 
approach, are likely not invariant to shifts in policy regimes or other structural changes. 

2 
 
Sims (1980) and Litterman (1980, 1986), and (ii) the micro-founded macroeconomic 
models based on rational expectation (e.g., real business cycle (RBC)) contributed by 
Kydland and Prescott (1982). These RBC models, derived from microeconomic 
principles, are also known as DSGE models3. Moreover, two independent literatures 
based on RBC theory and New Keynesian theory have emerged to develop the New 
Keynesian DSGE modelling4 that corresponds to a RBC theory, on which key elements 
of the Keynesian approach (e.g., imperfect competition and nominal rigidities) are 
superimposed.  
Of the macroeconomic models, the New Keynesian DSGE models represent a key 
development in the field of macroeconomic modelling for policy analysis. As the models 
are based on a sound, micro-founded structure, they are useful in explaining aggregate 
economic phenomena, such as economic growth, business cycles, and the effects of 
monetary and fiscal policies on the real economy. The models are suitable for conducting 
policy analysis and forecasting as they overcome Lucas’ (1976) critique and provide a 
good empirical fit. Therefore, policy makers are currently focusing on the estimated New 
Keynesian DSGE models with both nominal and real rigidities to tell stories about how 
an economy responds to structural shocks and to forecast future developments of an 
economy. However, progress has been slower in developing empirically viable DSGE 
models in the new open economy macroeconomics (NOEM)5 paradigm, compared to the 
models in the closed-economy setting.  
This thesis, therefore, aims to contribute to the literature on empirical NOEM modelling 
by examining the importance of various modelling implications (i.e., frictions and shocks) 
in building estimated small open economy New Keynesian DSGE models6. In this thesis, 
the assumption of a small open economy7 is used to model a price-taking economy, 
                                                           
3 A related methodology that pre-dates DSGE model is computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. 
Though the CGE models are also based on micro-foundation, they focus mostly on long-run relationships.  
4 This modelling framework has been introduced by Rotemberg and Woodford (1997) and Goodfriend and 
King (1997), and the synthesis is also referred as the New Neoclassical Synthesis.  
5 NOEM is set forth by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) who consider a two-country general equilibrium model 
with imperfect competition and price rigidities. The earlier development of the theoretical and empirical 
NOEM models have been reviewed by Lane (2001) and Lubik and Schorfheide (2006). The recent 
development of open economy DSGE models can be seen from Christiano et al. (2011b) and Adolfson et 
al. (2007, 2013).  
6 The models consist of a small open economy and the rest of the world. The rest of the world is modelled 
as a closed version of the open economy model. However, the model is asymmetric in structure, implying 
that there is one-way effect from the large economy to the small economy.   
7 A small open economy is an economy that participates in international trade, but is small enough compared 
to its trading partners that its policies do not alter world prices, interest rates, or incomes. This economy is 
unlike a large open economy, the actions of which do affect world prices and income. 

3 
 
allowing exogenous assumptions of the conditions in the rest of the world. Several 
econometric procedures have been proposed to parameterize and evaluate DSGE 
models8. However, compared to its alternatives, the Bayesian approach is rich enough to 
deal with both misspecification and identification problems raised in structural empirical 
models. Therefore, the DSGE models in the thesis are estimated and evaluated using 
Bayesian methods. The estimated DSGE models are particularly useful for monetary 
authorities to design and implement robust monetary and financial policies in both small 
open developed and developing economies.  
The contribution of this thesis to the literature is a comprehensive analysis of theoretical 
development, estimation and evaluation of a range of modelling assumptions in 
explaining the properties of macroeconomic and financial market data. Specifically, this 
thesis builds small open economy DSGE models, ranging from a standard small-scale 
model to a richer DSGE model, featuring both labour market imperfection and financial 
frictions. In doing so, it aims at integrating a number of extensions in DSGE modelling, 
proven to be crucial in explaining the macroeconomic fluctuations. Moreover, the thesis 
offers assessments on the importance of various frictions and shocks for analysing the 
macroeconomic dynamics of both small (Australia) and large (the US and G7) economies.  
1.2 Structure and preview  
This thesis contains three self-contained chapters on formulating and evaluating the small 
open economy New Keynesian DSGE models using Bayesian methods.   
From the modelling contribution point of view, the thesis develops New Keynesian 
DSGE models for a small open economy, linked to each other as shown in Figure 1.1. 
Chapter 2 sets out a simple small open economy New Keynesian DSGE model developed 
by Justiniano and Preston (2010) as the benchmark model for the thesis. However, this 
kind of open economy DSGE models considers the standard uncovered interest rate parity 
(UIP) and the demand side effect of monetary policy. Therefore, such models do not 
                                                           
8 The procedures range from calibration (Kydland and Prescott 1982), over GMM estimation of equilibrium 
relationship (Christiano and Eichenbaum 1992), minimum distance estimation based on the discrepancy 
among VAR and DSGE model impulse response functions (Rotemberg and Woodford 1997, Christiano et 
al. 2005), full-information likelihood based estimation (Leeper and Sims 1994, Kim 2000), to Bayesian 
estimation (Smets and Wouters 2003, An and Schorfheide 2007).

The literature on monetary DSGE models has shown that augmenting (or relaxing) 
standard assumptions in the models may help to account for the empirical evidence on 
the monetary transmission mechanism.  
Therefore, in Chapter 2, the benchmark model is augmented in the following two 
dimensions to investigate the relevance of the additional assumptions (i.e., cost channel 
of monetary policy and the forward premium puzzle) in accounting for the existing VAR 
results. First, following Christiano et al. (2005), Rabanal (2007) and Christiano et al. 
(2011a), the cost channel (i.e., supply side effect) of monetary policy is included in the 
model by assuming that a fraction of firms’ working capital must be financed by short-
term loans since firms have to pay some costs of their variable inputs in advance of selling 
their product. Second, as suggested by Adolfson et al. (2008) and Adolfson et al. (2013), 
the UIP condition is modified by allowing for the country risk premium to be negatively 
correlated with the expected depreciation in the nominal exchange rate.  
The model built in Chapter 2 assumes (i) a perfectly competitive market, in which 
households and firms take the wage as given, (ii) a standard household utility function, a 
preference of the class discussed in King et al. (1988), and (iii) shocks are unanticipated 
by agents until they are realized, and hence observed. However, the recent literature on 
DSGE modelling has highlighted the importance of labour market characteristics (i.e., 
unemployment, wage setting process and shocks in the market) in understanding the link 
between labour market and macroeconomic fluctuations. Recently, the view that business 
cycles can be driven purely by anticipated developments in the economy – so-called news 
shocks – has been revived. Furthermore, the news-driven business cycle literature 
addresses the fact that a DSGE model is able to reproduce the business cycle co-
movements in response to news shocks when the wealth effect of the shocks on the labour 
supply in the model is weak. Therefore, the model in Chapter 2 is further extended in 
Chapter 3 to include (i) labour market imperfection by incorporating the theory of 
involuntary unemployment proposed by Galí (2011), a variant of the staggered wage 
setting developed by Erceg et al. (2000) and labour market shocks, (ii) a utility function 
with an endogenous preference shifter, similar to that used by Galí et al. (2011), to 
mitigate the wealth effect, and (iii) both news (anticipated) and unanticipated components 
in each structural shock. Those extensions do not change the main features of the model, 
and they allow us to study labour market dynamics and macroeconomic effects of news 
shocks in a small open economy.

Recently, the global financial crisis (GFC) has spotlighted the importance of real-
financial linkage in explaining macroeconomic fluctuations and macroeconomic models 
for designing appropriate stabilization policy. In addition, the model built in Chapter 3 is 
abstracted from capital accumulation and real-financial linkages. Therefore, Chapter 4 
further develops the model to incorporate (i) capital accumulation, (ii) financial frictions 
based on the financial accelerator framework developed by Bernanke et al. (1999), and 
(iii) two financial shocks directly affecting the financial sector (i.e., credit supply shock 
and financial wealth shock) building on the recent literature (e.g., Dib et al. 2008, 
Gilchrist et al. 2009 and Christiano et al. 2010). The resulting model in an open economy 
setting is the rich in the sense that it has similar features of the medium-scale New 
Keynesian economy DSGE models (e.g., Smets and Wouters 2003, 2007, Christiano et 
al. 2005, Adolfson et al. 2007, 2008, Galí et al. 2011), but with an addition of involuntary 
unemployment, financial frictions and financial shocks. In particular, the model is closer 
to the small open economy DSGE models developed by Chiristiano et al. (2011) and 
Adolfson et al. (2013), reflecting both financial frictions and labour market imperfections. 
The estimated model with many frictions and shocks is suitable for assessing the 
prominence of structural shocks (e.g., financial, investment and labour market shocks) in 
explaining business cycles.   
From the methodological point of view, this thesis uses Bayesian methods for both 
estimation and empirical assessment of the developed DSGE models. As explained 
earlier, the Bayesian approach has its advantage over alternative approaches. In the 
Bayesian approach, a prior distribution on parameter is updated by sample information 
contained in the likelihood function to form a posterior distribution. Since the prior is 
based on ‘non-sample’ information (either from microeconomic studies or from previous 
macroeconomic exercises), the Bayesian method provides an ideal framework for 
combining different sources of information (Del Negro and Schorfheide 2011). The 
resulting posterior distributions of parameters provide a coherent measure of uncertainty 
about the parameters and the model specification. There is also a further advantage when 
it comes to formal comparison of models that are not nested using the model’s marginal 
likelihood.  
From the empirical point of view, this thesis examines important issues of a small open 
economy concerning the monetary policy transmission and the business cycle. Chapter 2 
investigates the quantitative role of the cost channel and the uncovered interest rate parity

(UIP) modification in an estimated small open economy New Keynesian model. This 
study contributes to the literature on the effect of monetary policy in a small open 
economy. First, it is one of the first attempts to assess the empirical relevance of the 
supply-side effects of monetary policy in a small open economy New Keynesian DSGE 
model estimated by Bayesian methods. Second, it attempts to assess a structural 
interpretation for violation of the standard UIP and the delayed overshooting puzzle using 
the Bayesian DSGE approach. Four variants of the model developed in Chapter 2 are 
separately estimated by Bayesian methods using data for Australia and the G7 
economies9. To evaluate the empirical relevance of the cost channel and the UIP 
modification, several assessment techniques are used. The empirical analysis suggests 
that (i) the presence of the cost channel and the UIP modification improves the model fit, 
(ii) though there is evidence of the cost channel, its strength is not sufficient to reproduce 
the price puzzle, and (iii) the standard UIP condition is violated in Australia and the 
presented UIP modification potentially resolves the delayed overshooting puzzle.  
Chapter 3 examines the importance of news shocks in an estimated small open economy 
model for analysing business cycle properties of macroeconomic aggregates, including 
labour market variables. The chapter contributes to the existing literature on the news-
driven business cycle in several ways. In particular, the chapter provides one of the first 
attempts to empirically assess (i) the international transmission mechanism of news 
shocks and (ii) the relevance of news shocks in generating exchange rate and labour 
market fluctuations using Bayesian open economy New Keynesian DSGE model in an 
international setting. Moreover, as a novelty in the literature, the chapter allows that news 
horizon(s) for each structural shock can be different depending on best-fitting searching 
results based on the approach originally proposed by Fujiwara et al. (2011). In Chapter 3, 
the model in Chapter 2 is further extended to include labour market imperfection, and 
both unanticipated and news shocks drive the extended model. The model is fitted to data 
for Australia and the US. Bayesian methods are employed to estimate the role of the news 
shocks and evaluate the model’s empirical properties. The main results show that the 
estimated model is able to qualitatively replicate the existing results of the VAR analyses 
on news-driven business cycles (e.g., Kosaka 2013 and Kamber et al. 2014), and news 
                                                           
9 However, in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, the rest of the world is proxied by the US data instead of the G7 
data as to identify a country specific news and financial shocks and to study their impacts on the Australian 
economy.

shocks are the main drivers of Australian business cycle fluctuations in the inflation-
targeting period.  
Chapter 4 focuses on the importance of financial frictions and shocks in an estimated 
small open economy DSGE model for explaining business cycle fluctuations. Financial 
frictions are introduced only in Chapter 4 based on an open economy version of the 
financial accelerator framework, and only the accumulation and management of capital 
involves the frictions. To this end, Chapter 4 extends the model in Chapter 3 to 
incorporate financial frictions and shocks as described in Figure 1.1. This study 
introduces some novelties and contributes to the literature in distinct ways. First, it 
assesses the empirical relevance of foreign-currency denominated debt assumption in the 
model using Bayesian methods. Second, it is one of the first attempts to examine the 
significance of financial frictions and shocks in an estimated open economy DSGE model 
in a two-country setting. Third, this paper investigates empirically the international 
transmission mechanism of financial shocks (i.e., credit supply shock and financial weal 
shock). Three versions of the model are estimated using Bayesian methods on Australian 
and the US data over the period 1993:Q1 -2013:Q4, covering the inflation-targeting 
period in Australia and the GFC of 2008-2009. The empirical analysis shows that the 
financial accelerator is operative in both Australia and the US, and that financial shocks 
(i.e., two shocks that directly affect the credit spread) play a pivotal role in explaining 
investment and output fluctuations.   
Chapter 5 provides a summary of key findings and presents implications for designing 
macroeconomic policies. Furthermore, the chapter offers some important policy 
implications for developing empirically viable small open economy DSGE models.

Abstract 
 
This chapter examines the quantitative role of the cost channel and the uncovered 
interest rate parity (UIP) modification in an estimated small open economy DSGE 
model. For this purpose, a standard model (i.e., Justiniano and Preston 2010a) is 
augmented to incorporate (i) the cost channel of monetary policy and (ii) the UIP 
modification allowing for the country risk premium to be negatively correlated 
with the expected exchange rate depreciation. Four variants of the augmented 
model are estimated using Bayesian methods with data from Australia and the G7 
economies. The empirical analysis shows that introducing the cost channel and 
the UIP modification into the standard model improves its ability to fit the 
business cycle features of key macroeconomic variables and to account for the 
empirical evidence on the monetary transmission mechanism.

2.1 Introduction  
The vector autoregression (VAR) analyses of the monetary transmission have highlighted 
various puzzles. These puzzles include the ‘price puzzle’, first used by Eichenbaum 
(1992), which refers to a phenomenon, in which an unexpected tightening in monetary 
policy leads to a rise in inflation at least temporarily (see, Dungey and Fry 2003, Jacob 
and Rayner 2012 for Australia); and the ‘delayed overshooting puzzle’, which refers to a 
circumstance in which the response of real exchange rate to a monetary policy shock is 
hump-shaped with a peak effect after a period of time (see, Eichenbaum and Evans 1995, 
Faust and Rogers 2003 for G7 countries, and Dungey and Pagan 2000, 2009, Liu 2010 
for Australia). However, the standard small open economy DSGE models in the New 
Keynesian tradition have challenges to account for the results shown by the VAR-based 
studies. The New Keynesian DSGE models, embedding only the traditional aggregate 
demand channel and the standard UIP condition, suggest that an unexpected tightening 
in monetary policy declines prices immediately and leads to an immediate appreciation 
of the exchange rate followed by depreciation in line with Dornbusch’s (1976) immediate 
overshooting prediction (e.g., Bergin 2006 for the US, and Nimark 2009, Jääskelä and 
Nimark 2011 for Australia).  
The existing literature suggests a couple of modifications for resolving those empirical 
puzzles. For instance, introducing a cost channel of monetary policy into the standard 
New Keynesian DSGE model has been known as a potential way to resolve the price 
puzzle (e.g., Chowdharry et al. 2006, Tillman 2008 and Henzel et al. 2009)10. Moreover, 
recent studies (e.g., Adolfson et al. 2008, Christiano et al. 2011b and Adolfson et al. 2013) 
have argued that modifying the UIP condition is a possible way to reproduce the delayed 
overshooting puzzle.  
This chapter is therefore motivated by some important questions: (i) is there a structural 
interpretation (i.e., cost channel interpretation) of the price puzzle in the case of a small 
open economy like Australia?, (ii) is there a structural model-based evidence for violation 
of the standard UIP and the delayed overshooting puzzle?, and (iii) does the presence of 
the cost channel and the UIP modification improve the model’s ability to fit 
                                                           
10 As stated by Sims (1992), the price puzzle was initially thought of as a consequence of the 
misidentification of monetary policy shocks in VARs. However, scholars have paid attention to the cost 
channel interpretation of the price puzzle after the VAR study on the supply side of monetary policy, 
conducted by Barth and Ramey (2001).

macroeconomic data? In order to address these questions, it is necessary to carry out 
empirical research with appropriate modifications to the empirical model. Given this 
context, the chapter contributes to the literature on macroeconomic modelling for 
monetary policy in the open economy.  
In particular, the chapter examines the quantitative role of the cost channel and the UIP 
modification in an estimated small open economy DSGE model. To this end, the standard 
model of Justiniano and Preston (2010a, henceforth J-P model)11 is augmented in two 
dimensions. First, following Christiano et al. (2005), Rabanal (2007) and Christiano et al. 
(2011a), the cost channel of monetary policy is included in the model by assuming that a 
fraction of firms’ working capital (e,g., wage bills) must be financed by short-term loans 
since firms have to pay some costs of their variable inputs in advance of selling their 
product. Second, based on Adolfson et al. (2008) and Adolfson et al. (2013), the UIP 
condition is modified by allowing for the country risk premium to be negatively correlated 
with the expected depreciation in the nominal exchange rate. 
The cost channel describes the supply side effect of interest rates on firms’ cost: a 
monetary policy tightening increases the marginal cost of production, and hence drives 
inflation12. If there is a cost channel, then a monetary policy shock will shift both the 
aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves in the same direction, leading to a large 
change in output complemented by ambiguous changes in prices. Using the New 
Keynesian DSGE models, several papers (e.g., Ravenna and Walsh 2006, Chowdhury et 
al. 2006, Tillmann 2008, 2009, Hülsewig et al. 2009, Henzel et al. 2009 and Christiano et 
al. 2011a) have found the empirical evidence for the cost channel in the closed economy 
context, calling for a serious rethinking of designing optimal monetary policy. In the 
context of a small open economy, Chang and Jansen (2014) show evidence for the cost 
channel in Canada and Australia based on the present value model of the forward-looking 
Phillips curve. According to the cost channel interpretation, the price puzzle emerges 
when the inflationary impact induced by monetary policy tightening through the cost 
                                                           
11 The J-P model is technically a semi-small open economy model, where domestic producers have some 
market power. The specification of the model allows for incomplete asset markets, habit formation and 
indexation of prices to past inflation in a small open economy model proposed by Monacelli (2005) and 
Galí and Monacelli (2005).  
12 Motivation of the cost channel is that firms must pay factors of production before receiving their revenues, 
and hence firms’ variable inputs must be financed by short-term loans. Therefore, monetary policy has an 
impact on firms’ costs of production, thereby on the supply side of the economy (Christiano et al. 2011a).  

16 
 
channel is stronger than the one operating through the standard demand channel13. 
However, empirical results for the cost channel interpretation of the price puzzle have 
been varied. Some papers (e.g., Chowdhury et.al 2006, Tillman 2008, Henzel et al. 2009 
and Christiano et al. 2011a) support the structural interpretation of the price puzzle. On 
the other hand, many others (e.g., Rabanal 2007, Kaufmann and Scharler 2009, Gabriel 
and Martins 2010, Castcluovo 2012, and Malikane 2012) find that the cost channel does 
not provide the structural interpretation of the prize puzzle. Moreover, as suggested by 
Barth and Ramey (2001) and Christiano et al. (2005), the presence of the cost channel 
may allow the model to reproduce the delayed and gradual response of inflation, and the 
large and persistent response of output to a monetary policy shock.  
Recent papers based on DSGE models have shown that the delayed overshooting puzzle 
can be solved when new features such as (i) incomplete information about the monetary 
policy (Hoffman et al. 2011, only for inflation target shock), (ii) learning process 
(Gouranchas and Tornel 2004, Jääskelä and McKibbin 2010) and (iii) modelling the 
country risk premium in the UIP condition (Adolfson et al. 2008, Christiano et al. 2011b) 
are incorporated into a standard small open economy DSGE model. The first two methods 
based on the alternative modelling of expectations possibly match the real exchange rate 
persistence, while satisfying the standard UIP condition (e.g., Milani 2012). However, in 
the latter way, the UIP condition is modified by considering the following empirical 
evidence. According to the hypothesis of standard UIP condition, the slope coefficient 
from the regression of expected changes in the nominal exchange rate on interest rate 
differential across countries should be 1. However, the empirical evidence suggests that 
the slope coefficient is significantly negative, implying that the standard UIP is violated 
in the data. This empirical finding is referred to as the ‘forward premium puzzle’ (e.g., 
Hodrick 1987, Lewis 1995 and Engle 1996)14. According to the risk premium explanation 
(e.g., Fama 1984), this failure of the UIP hypothesis can be interpreted as an outcome of 
time-variation in the risk premium, and implies that (i) the covariance between the risk 
premium and the expected depreciation must be negative, and (ii) absolute size of the 
covariance must be less than the variance of the risk premium and greater than the 
variance of the expected depreciation (Bansal and Dahliquist 2000). Based on the long-
standing empirical finding, recent studies (Adolfson 2008, Christiano et al. 2011b and 
                                                           
13 The positive response of inflation to monetary policy tightening has been called ‘Wright Patman effect’ 
since the US congressman Wright Patman said the following statement in 1970: raising interest rate to fight 
inflation is like ‘throwing gasoline on fire’. 
14 Inability of asset pricing models to reproduce this result is also referred to as the UIP puzzle (Backus et 
al. 2010).

Adolfson et al. 2013) have modified the UIP condition in their DSGE models by allowing 
a negative relationship between the risk premium and the expected depreciation15.  
The models with/without the cost channel and/or the UIP modification are estimated by 
Bayesian methods using the data for Australia and the G7 economies over the period 
1993:Q1-2013:Q4, covering the inflation-targeting period in Australia. Empirical results 
show that the presence of the cost channel and the presented UIP modification in the 
model is supported by the data and improves the model’s ability to fit the business cycle 
features of main macroeconomic variables. The primary role played by the cost channel 
in the model is to generate inflation inertia without obtaining a high estimated degree of 
domestic price stickiness as highlighted by Christiano et al. (2005). The presented UIP 
modification in the estimated model plays an important role in generating the persistence 
of exchange rate. Monetary transmission analysis suggests (i) no evidence of the cost 
channel interpretation of the price puzzle, and (ii) evidence for the delayed overshooting 
of exchange rate in response to a monetary policy shock in Australia over the inflation-
targeting period. The estimated model with such modifications generates both persistence 
and volatility in real exchange rate dynamics, as well as hump-shaped responses of real 
exchange rate and output to exogenous shocks, which have been difficult to see in 
standard small open economy DSGE models. 
The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 2.2 describes the modified 
J-P model with the cost channel and the UIP modification. Section 2.3 presents the model 
solution and estimation strategy, consisting of the data and the priors for parameters. 
Section 2.4 shows empirical results on exploring the importance of the cost channel and 
the UIP modification in the model. Finally, section 2.5 concludes the paper with some 
policy implications and directions for future research.  
 
 
                                                           
15 The suggested UIP modification provides a ‘mechanical’ source of persistence matching the observed 
exchange rate dynamics, and thereby helps the model to account for the delayed overshooting of exchange 
rate in response to a monetary policy shock. In addition, the models with the modified UIP potentially 
generate a persistent response of output to an unexpected monetary policy tightening since the response of 
demands for domestic goods depends on how much the exchange rate appreciates (e.g., Christiano et al. 
2011b).

2.2 The Model  
The J-P model is augmented to incorporate the cost channel of monetary policy and the 
UIP modification. The cost channel is introduced based on work conducted by Christiano 
et al. (2005), Rabanal (2007) and Christiano et al. (2011a). The UIP condition is modified 
as suggested by Adolfson et al. (2008) and Adolfson et al. (2013). The model consists of 
a small open economy and the rest of the world16 and contains households, firms, a 
monetary authority and a passive fiscal authority. As modelled by Monacelli (2005) and 
Justiniano and Preston (2010b), the rest of the world is specified as the closed economy 
variant of the open economy model. The household consumes domestically produced and 
imported goods, supplies labour, and invests in either domestic or foreign one-period 
bonds. Firms are divided into domestic producers, retailers and final good producers. 
Domestic firms produce a variety of domestic goods by using only labour input and sell 
them both domestically and overseas. Retail firms import differentiated products from the 
rest of the world and sell them in the domestic market. In principle, there is also a perfectly 
competitive final goods sector that buys domestic and imports varieties and produces a 
final consumption good. However, the final goods sector is not modelled explicitly since 
perfectly competitive firms make zero profit. Under monopolistic competition, output 
would be below its Pareto-optimal levels in the absence of government intervention, even 
with perfectly flexible prices. Therefore, in the model, fiscal policy is responsible for a 
zero debt policy, with taxes equal to the subsidy required to eliminate the distortion 
associated with imperfect competition in the domestic and imported goods market. The 
rest of the world is large compared to the small open economy. As a result, all foreign 
economy variables are taken exogenously by the domestic economy. In what follows, the 
problems of each sector in the model are detailed. Derivations of the optimization 
problem and log-linear approximations are shown in Appendix 2.C.  
2.2.1 Households 
The representative agent maximizes lifetime utility, subject to a budget constraint. The 
household consumes, invests, and supplies labour to the domestic firms. The lifetime 
expected utility function, 𝑈, is given by

where 𝐸0 denotes the expectation formed in period 0, 𝛽 is the discount factor, 𝑁𝑡 is the 
labour input, 𝐻𝑡≡ℎ𝐶𝑡−1 is external habit formation term that is taken as exogenously by 
the household and 0 < ℎ< 1, 𝜎, 𝜑> 0 are the elasticities of intertemporal substitution 
and labour supply, respectively, 𝜀̃𝑔,𝑡 is a preference shock that account for changes in

where αϵ[0,1] is the share of foreign goods in the aggregate consumption bundle; 𝜂> 0 
is the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods,  𝐶𝐻,𝑡 and 𝐶𝐹,𝑡 are 
Dixit-Stiglitz aggregates of the available domestic and foreign produced goods given by

It is assumed that all households have identical initial wealth and receive an equal fraction 
of both domestic and retail firm profits, so that each household faces the same budget 
constraint and makes identical consumption and portfolio decisions17. Assuming the only 
available assets are one-period domestic and foreign bonds, the flow budget constraint 
for all 𝑡> 0 is given by 
                    𝑃𝑡𝐶𝑡+ 𝐷𝑡+ 𝑒̃𝑡𝐵𝑡= 𝐷𝑡−1(1 + 𝑖̃𝑡−1) + 𝑒̃𝑡𝐵𝑡−1(1 + 𝑖̃𝑡−1

one-period domestic bonds with interest rate, 𝑖̃𝑡, 𝐵𝑡 is holdings of one-period foreign 
bonds with interest rate, 𝑖̃𝑡
∗, 𝑒̃𝑡 is the nominal exchange rate (the domestic price of foreign 
currency); the households receive nominal wages, 𝑊𝑡, for labour supplied, Π𝐻,𝑡 and Π𝐹,𝑡 
denote profits from equity holdings in domestic and retail firms, respectively, and T𝑡 is 
lump-sum taxes and transfers. Since financial markets are imperfectly integrated, the term 
                                                           
17 Without this assumption, which imposes complete markets within the domestic economy, the analysis 
would require modelling the distribution of wealth across agents. 

20 
 
𝜙𝑡 represents a country risk premium (a relative risk adjustment of foreign asset return) 
as discussed by Benigno (2009).  
A novel feature of the model is to allow possible violation of the standard UIP condition. 
In this chapter, the UIP condition is modified by assuming that the risk premium function 
has the following form  
𝜙𝑡+1(𝐴𝑡, 𝑒̃𝑡, 𝜀̃𝑟𝑝,𝑡 ) = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−𝜙𝑎𝐴𝑡−𝜙𝑒(
𝐸𝑡𝑒̃𝑡+1
𝑒̃𝑡
𝑒̃𝑡
𝑒̃𝑡−1 −1) + 𝜀̃𝑟𝑝,𝑡)      (2.3) 
where 𝐴𝑡≡𝑒̃𝑡𝐵𝑡𝑌̅𝑃𝑡
⁄
  is the real quantity of outstanding net foreign debt expressed in 
terms of domestic currency as a fraction of steady-state output and 𝜀̃𝑟𝑝,𝑡 is a country risk 
premium shock. As discussed by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003) and Bergin (2006), it 
is assumed that the risk premium depends on the net foreign debt of a country (𝐴𝑡) to 
ensure a stationary steady-state in the model. This relationship also can be motivated from 
the fact that lenders demand a higher rate of return on a country with a large debt to 
compensate for perceived default risk. In addition, as suggested by Adolfson et al. (2008), 
the expected change in the exchange rate (𝐸𝑡𝑒̃𝑡+1 𝑒̃𝑡−1
⁄
−1) is included into the risk 
premium function based on empirical findings that the risk premium is negatively 
correlated with the expected depreciation (e.g., Lewis 1995, Engle 1996 and Duarte and 
Stockman 2005). Finally, following McCallum and Nelson (2002), Jeanne and Rose 
(2002) and Kollmann (2002), a mean zero shock (𝜀̃𝑟𝑝,𝑡) is incorporated into the risk 
premium specification to capture time-varying exogenous deviations from the UIP 
condition. Another implication of the term is to introduce an economically interpretable 
shock that is helpful to avoid the model misspecification, in particular the singularity 
problem.  
The household’s optimization problem requires allocation of expenditures for all types of 
domestic and foreign goods both intratemporally and intertemporally. This yields the 
following demand functions for each category of consumption goods:   
𝐶𝐻,𝑡(𝑖) = (1 −𝛼) (
𝑃𝐻,𝑡 (𝑖)
𝑃𝐻,𝑡)
−𝜀
𝐶𝐻,𝑡 and  𝐶𝐹,𝑡(𝑖) = 𝛼(
𝑃𝐹,𝑡(𝑖)
𝑃𝐹,𝑡)
−𝜀
𝐶𝐹,𝑡 
for all 𝑖 with associated aggregate price indexes for the domestic and foreign consumption 
bundles given by 𝑃𝐻,𝑡 and 𝑃𝐹,𝑡, respectively. Therefore, the optimal allocation of 
expenditure across domestic and foreign goods implies  
𝐶𝐻,𝑡= (1 −𝛼) (
𝑃𝐻,𝑡
𝑃𝑡)
−𝜂
𝐶𝑡                                                                (2.4.1)

Combining (2.1) with (2.4.1) and (2.4.2) yields the theoretically consistent CPI 
𝑃𝑡= [(1 −𝛼)𝑃𝐻,𝑡
1−𝜂+ 𝛼𝑃𝐹,𝑡

The household maximizes its lifetime utility subject to the budget constraint (2.2) by 
choosing optimally how much to consume, work and invest. This gives the following set 
of optimality conditions:

with Lagrange multiplier, Λ𝑡= 𝜀̃𝑔,𝑡(𝐶𝑡−ℎ𝐶𝑡−1)−𝜎𝑃𝑡
−1, implying the marginal utility of 
income. Equation (2.6) provides the optimal labour supply schedule, equation (2.7) 
presents the standard Euler equation, and equation (2.8) implies an arbitrage condition 
restricting the relative movements of domestic and foreign interest rates and changes in 
the nominal exchange rate.   
2.2.2 Domestic firms and the cost channel  
There is a continuum of monopolistically competitive domestic firms, indexed by 𝑖∈
[0,1]. Each firm 𝑖 produces differentiated goods using labour as a single input. The 
individual and aggregate production functions are given by  
𝑌𝐻,𝑡(𝑖) = 𝜀̃𝑎,𝑡𝑁𝑡(𝑖)    and     𝑌𝐻,𝑡= (∫𝑌𝐻,𝑡(𝑖)
𝜀−1
𝜀𝑑𝑖

)
𝜀
𝜀−1 18              (2.9) 
where 𝜀̃𝑎,𝑡 represents a neutral technology shock, 𝑁𝑡(𝑖) is homogenous labour, and 𝜀 is 
the elasticity of substitution between different varieties. 
Another novel feature in the model is the presence of the cost channel. The supply side 
channel is introduced by assuming that a fraction (𝜐𝐻) of domestic firms’ wage bills has 
to be paid before firms receive the proceeds from the sale of their products. Hence a firm 
                                                           
18 It is useful for deriving an approximate aggregate production function. For instance, up to a first order 
log-linear approximation to 𝑁𝑡≡∫𝑁𝑡(𝑖)𝑑𝑖

22 
 
must borrow an amount, 𝜐𝐻𝑊𝑡𝑁𝑡(𝑖), of short-term loans at the nominal interest rate, 𝑖̃𝑡. 
Here, as employed by Ravenna and Walsh (2006) and Rabanal (2007), a complete interest 
rate pass-through (from the policy-controlled interest rate to the short-term loan rate) is 
assumed. This assumption is in line with the finding of Stewart et al. (2013) for Australia. 
The total cost of the domestic firm 𝑖 in period 𝑡 therefore is given by 
                     𝑇𝐶𝐻,𝑡(𝑖) =  𝑊𝑡𝑁𝑡(𝑖)𝑅𝐻,𝑡      
where 𝑅𝐻,𝑡≡1 + 𝜐𝐻𝑖̃𝑡. The nominal marginal cost of the domestic firm 𝑖 is then 
determined as  
𝑀𝐶𝐻,𝑡
𝑛(𝑖) = (
𝜕𝑇𝐶𝐻,𝑡(𝑖)
𝜕𝑁𝑡(𝑖) ) (
𝜕𝑦𝐻,𝑡(𝑖)
𝜕𝑁𝑡(𝑖) )

=
 𝑊𝑡𝑅𝐻,𝑡
𝜀̃𝑎,𝑡                                              (2.10) 
By affecting firms’ marginal cost, a nominal interest rate acts as a cost-push shock, so 
that the cost channel can be viewed as a supply side channel of monetary policy 
transmission.    
Because the goods are imperfect substitutes, each firm has some degree of monopolistic 
power when setting prices. Calvo-style price setting is assumed, allowing for indexation 
to past domestic goods price inflation19. In any period 𝑡, a fraction, 1 −𝜃𝐻, of firms 
(randomly selected)  set prices optimally, while a fraction, 0 < 𝜃𝐻< 1, of goods prices 
are adjusted according to the indexation rule20 
𝑃𝐻,𝑡(𝑖) = 𝑃𝐻,𝑡−1(𝑖) (
𝑃𝐻,𝑡−1
𝑃𝐻,𝑡−2)
𝛿𝐻
                                                                (2.11) 
where 0 ≤𝛿𝐻≤1 indicates the degree of indexation to past inflation rate. Considering 
the symmetric equilibrium in which all firms behave identically, the index 𝑖 is omitted in 
what follows. Since all firms having the opportunity to reset their prices in period 𝑡 face 
the identical decision problem, they set a common price, 𝑃′𝐻,𝑡. Therefore, the Dixit-
Stiglitz aggregate price index for domestic goods evolves according to 
𝑃𝐻,𝑡= [(1 −𝜃𝐻)𝑃′𝐻,𝑡

19 Collard and Dellas (2010) show that compared to the pricing decision under fixed duration scheme 
(Taylor 1980), the assumption of the pricing decision under random duration scheme, proposed by Calvo 
(1983) plays a critical role for empirical success of standard DSGE model with sticky price.

A firm choosing the optimal price in period t maximizes the present discounted value of 
profits, taking into account the probability of not being able to re-set prices in the future 
periods 𝑡+ 𝜏, 𝜏> 0. Firms sell their goods both domestically and abroad. When 
assuming that foreign demand (𝐶𝐻,𝑡
∗) is of the same functional form as in domestic demand 
(2.4.1 and 2.4.2), the demand curve faced in period 𝑡+ 𝜏 for a firm that last re-set prices 
optimally in period 𝑡 and henceforth just adjusted prices according to the indexation rule 
(2.11) is given by

observed inflation and a price markup shock, 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡, capturing inefficient variations in the 
domestic firm’s price markup22. The domestically produced goods’ inflation is also 
determined by the terms of trade, 𝑠𝑡, which will be discussed later in detail. In the 
presence of the cost channel of monetary policy, the nominal interest rate affects the 
supply side of the economy by changing firms’ marginal cost, and hence the inflation. 
2.2.3 Retail firms and the cost channel 
Retail firms import foreign differentiated goods for which the law of one price holds at 
the docks. In determining the domestic currency price of imported goods, firms are 
assumed to be monopolistically competitive. The small degree of pricing power leads to 
deviation from the law of one price in the short-run. Retail firms face a Calvo-style price 
setting with indexation to past inflation. The sticky price parameter and the indexation 
parameter for retail sector are denoted by 𝜃𝐹 and 𝛿𝐹, respectively. Hence, in any period, 
a fraction, 1 −𝜃𝐹, of firms sets prices optimally, while a fraction, 0 < 𝜃𝐹< 1, of goods 
prices are adjusted according to an indexation rule analogous to equation (2.10). The 
Dixit-Stiglitz aggregate price index for foreign goods consequently evolves according to  
𝑃𝐹,𝑡= [(1 −𝜃𝐹)𝑃′𝐹,𝑡

)

                       (2.16) 
When focussing on the symmetric equilibrium in which all retail firms behave identically, 
the demand faced by a firm in period 𝑡+ 𝜏 conditional on having last re-optimized its 
price in period 𝑡 set by 𝑃′𝐹,𝑡 is   
𝐶𝐹,𝑡+𝜏|𝑡 = (

𝐶𝐹,𝑡+𝜏                                                  (2.17) 
For retail firms, the cost channel of monetary policy is also introduced by assuming that 
a fraction (𝜐𝐹) of firms’ cost for buying imported goods from the foreign economy has to 
be paid before firms receive the proceeds from the sale of their imported goods. Thus 
retail firms must borrow an amount, 𝜐𝐹𝑒̃𝑡𝑃𝐹,𝑡
∗𝐶𝐹,𝑡 , of domestic currency short-term loans 
at the nominal rate, 𝑖̃𝑡. The total cost of the retail firm in period 𝑡 is given by  
                    𝑇𝐶𝐹,𝑡= 𝑒̃𝑡𝑃𝐹,𝑡
∗𝐶𝐹,𝑡 𝑅𝐹,𝑡  
                                                           
22 Similar to Justiniano and Preston (2010a,b), the price markup shocks are just added in the Phillips curve 
equations. It is assumed that 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡= 𝑘𝐻𝜇𝐻,𝑡
𝑝 and 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡= 𝑘𝐹𝜇𝐹,𝑡
𝑝, where 𝜇𝐻,𝑡
𝑝and 𝜇𝐹,𝑡
𝑝 are price markup 
shocks in domestic and retail sectors as discussed in Smets and Wouters (2003, 2007).

where 𝑅𝐹,𝑡≡1 + 𝜐𝐹𝑖̃𝑡, 𝑃𝐹,𝑡

A firm choosing the optimal price in period t maximizes the present discounted value of

capturing inefficient variations in the retail firm’s mark-up. By setting 𝜐𝐻= 0 and 𝜐𝐹=
0, the Phillips curves typically used in small open economy models are obtained. In the 
empirical analysis, we formally test which specification is supported by the data.   
2.2.4  International risk sharing and the UIP modification 
The real exchange rate is defined as 𝑞̃𝑡= 𝑒̃𝑡𝑃𝑡

, and the terms of trade is given by 𝑆𝑡=
𝑃𝐹,𝑡𝑃𝐻,𝑡
⁄
. When the law of one price fails to hold, the law of one price gap is obtained as 

26 
 
Ψ𝐹,𝑡= 𝑒̃𝑡𝑃𝑡
∗𝑃𝐹,𝑡
⁄
 (where 𝑃∗= 𝑃𝐹,𝑡
∗), originally defined by Monacelli (2005). Using 
lower-case letters to denote log-deviation from steady state values (i.e., 𝑥𝑡≡log (𝑋𝑡𝑋
⁄ )), 
log-linear approximations to the country risk premium equation (2.3) and the arbitrage 
condition (2.8) provide the modified UIP condition as follows: 
𝑖𝑡−𝑖𝑡
∗= (1 −𝜙𝑒)𝐸𝑡Δ𝑒𝑡+1 −𝜙𝑒Δ𝑒𝑡−𝜙𝑎𝑎𝑡+ 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡                                 (2.20) 
where Δ𝑒𝑡= 𝜋𝑡−𝜋𝑡
∗+ ∆𝑞𝑡 is the change in the nominal exchange rate. By setting 𝜙𝑒=
0, equation (2.20) transfers to the standard UIP condition where a rise in 𝑖𝑡 relative to 𝑖𝑡
∗ 
produces an anticipated depreciation of the currency23. However, there is evidence of the 
violation of the standard UIP condition. The existing results of the VAR analyses (e.g., 
Eichenbaum and Evans 1995 and Faust and Rogers 2003) on the response of exchange 
rate to a contractionary monetary policy shock suggest that 𝐸𝑡𝑒𝑡+1 −𝑒𝑡 actually falls for 
a period of time, implying that the nominal exchange rate appreciates gradually. The 
modified UIP condition (2.20) helps the model to reproduce this empirical evidence since 
the modification allows ‘mechanical’ sources of persistence for the nominal exchange 
rate. A reason is that under the specification with the modified UIP, the current exchange 
rate in level depends on the combination of expected and lagged nominal exchange and 
the interest rate differential. Therefore, when the domestic interest rate increases, then the 
nominal exchange appreciates (a fall in 𝑒𝑡), and if there is high persistence, implied by 
the parameter 𝜙𝑒, the nominal exchange rate will gradually appreciate for a substantial 
period of time. In the empirical analysis, we formally test which specification (𝜙𝑒= 0 or 
𝜙𝑒> 0) is supported by the data.  
2.2.5 Monetary and fiscal policy 
The short-term interest rate, 𝑖̃𝑡, linked to the gross interest rate by 𝑅𝑡
𝑀= 1 + 𝑖̃𝑡. As 
discussed by An and Schorfheide (2007), the monetary policy is conducted according to 
a Taylor-type rule 
             𝑅𝑡
𝑀= (𝑅𝑡−1
𝑀)𝜌𝑅(𝑅𝑡
∗)1−𝜌𝑅𝜀̃𝑅,𝑡, with  𝑅𝑡

23 This rise in 𝐸𝑡𝑒𝑡+1 −𝑒𝑡 is accomplished in part by an instantaneous appreciation in 𝑒𝑡. The idea behind 
of the instantaneous appreciation is that asset holders respond to the unfavourable foreign rate of return by 
attempting to sell foreign assets and acquire domestic currency for the purpose of holding domestic assets. 
This process pulls 𝑒𝑡 down until the anticipated depreciation precisely compensates domestic investor 
holding foreign assets. 

27 
 
where 𝑅𝑡
∗ is nominal target rate, 𝑅𝑀 and 𝑌 are steady state values of gross nominal interest 
rate and output, respectively, and  𝜀̃𝑅,𝑡 is  an exogenous monetary policy shock. Monetary 
policy responds to contemporaneous values of inflation, output and output growth24. 
Fiscal policy is specified as a zero debt policy, with taxes equal to the subsidy required 
to eliminate the distortion induced by imperfect competition in the domestic and imported 
goods market.  
2.2.6 General equilibrium and the foreign economy 
Goods market clearings in the domestic and foreign economies respectively require 
𝑌𝐻,𝑡= 𝐶𝐻,𝑡+ 𝐶𝐻,𝑡
∗  and   𝑌𝑡
∗= 𝐶𝑡
∗                                                                (2.22) 
As discussed by Kollmann (2002), foreign demand for the domestically produced good 
is specified as 
𝐶𝐻,𝑡
∗
= 𝜍(
𝑃𝐻,𝑡
∗
𝑃𝑡
∗)
−𝜂∗
𝑌𝑡
∗                                                                                   (2.23) 
where 𝜍 represents the share of foreign imports to total foreign output, and 𝜂∗> 0 is the 
foreign elasticity of substitution25. It is assumed that there is no access to domestic debt 
markets for foreign households. Domestic debt market clearing therefore requires zero 
net supply, 𝐷𝑡= 0, for all 𝑡. A similar condition also holds for the foreign economy since 
domestic holdings of foreign debt, 𝐵𝑡, are negligible relative to the size of the foreign 
economy.   
All foreign variables and parameters are denoted by superscript “*”. Since the foreign 
economy is very large, trade flows to and from the domestic economy are negligible 
compared to total foreign economic activity. This implies that 𝛼∗ tends to zero. As a 
result, the foreign consumption is given by 𝐶𝑡
∗= 𝐶𝐹,𝑡
∗, which implies that the foreign CPI 
is entirely determined by foreign goods price (𝑃𝑡
∗= 𝑃𝐹,𝑡
∗). Foreign debt in the foreign 
economy is in zero net supply, using the property that the domestic economy engages in 
negligible financial asset trade. Foreign investors do not face a country risk premium, so 
the return on foreign bonds for them is simply 1 + 𝑖∗. Because a negligible part of the 
                                                           
24 The change in nominal exchange rate is eliminated from the Taylor rule based on the result of Lubik and 
Schorfheide (2007), showing that the RBA does not include the nominal exchange rate in its policy rule.   
25 The functional form of equation (2.23) is assumed to be the same as shown in equation (2.4.2). Because 
of the large open economy assumption, the parameter 𝜍 tends to zero. However, the parameter helps to get 
the well-defined steady state level of 𝐶𝐻
∗. Constraining 𝜂∗ to equal 𝜂 gives similar results from the 
estimation, and hence the constraint is used in the estimation to reduce the number of estimated parameters. 

28 
 
foreign consumption bundle is imports from the small open economy, there is no foreign 
import sector. The remaining setting is same as for the domestic economy. 
2.2.7 The log-linearized model 
For the empirical analysis, a log-linear approximation of the model’s optimality 
conditions around a non-stochastic steady state is derived. The log-linearized equations 
of the model are shown in Appendix 2.A. The domestic block is described by ten 
equations in the unknowns {𝑐𝑡,𝑦𝑡, 𝑖𝑡, 𝑞𝑡, 𝑠𝑡, 𝜋𝑡, 𝜋𝐻,𝑡, 𝜋𝐹,𝑡, 𝜓𝐹,𝑡, 𝑎𝑡}, while the foreign block 
is given by three equations in the unknowns { 𝑦𝑡
∗, 𝜋𝑡
∗, 𝑖𝑡
∗}. When combined with processes 
for the exogenous disturbances and the definitions ∆𝑠𝑡= 𝑠𝑡−𝑠𝑡−1 and ∆𝑞𝑡= 𝑞𝑡−𝑞𝑡−1, 
these relations constitute a linear rational expectations model driven by ten shocks: 
{𝜀𝑔,𝑡, 𝜀𝑎,𝑡, 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡, 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡, 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡, 𝜀𝑅,𝑡, 𝜀𝑔,𝑡
∗, 𝜀𝑎,𝑡
∗, 𝜀𝑐𝑝,𝑡
∗
, 𝜀𝑅,𝑡
∗}26. According to Justiniano and 
Preston (2010b), the following assumption is made: {𝜀𝑅,𝑡, 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡, 𝜀𝑅,𝑡
∗, 𝜀𝑐𝑝,𝑡
∗
} are i.i.d 
processes and {𝜀𝑔,𝑡, 𝜀𝑎,𝑡, 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡, 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡, 𝜀𝑔,𝑡
∗, 𝜀𝑎,𝑡
∗} follow AR(1) processes given by   
𝜀𝑥,𝑡= 𝜌𝑥𝜀𝑥,𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑥,𝑡                                                             (2.24) 
with 𝐸[𝜖𝑥,𝑡𝜖′𝑥,𝑡] = 𝜎𝑥
2. 
2.3 The model solution, data and estimation strategy  
2.3.1 The model solution 
Before the DSGE models can be estimated, it has to be solved. The model, consisting of 
linearized equations of the shown in Appendix 2.A, combining with processes for the 
shocks, can be solved using a variety of standard methods, including those developed by 
Blanchard and Kahn (1980), King and Watson (1998), Uhlig (1999), Klein (2000) and 
Sims (2002) 27. Using a standard method (e.g., Sims 2002), the model could be rewritten 
in the following state-space form:  
𝜉𝑡= 𝐹(𝜃)𝜉𝑡−1 + 𝐺(𝜃)𝜖𝑡,    𝜖𝑡~ 𝑁𝐼𝐷(0, 𝐼)                         (2.25) 
 𝑌𝑡= 𝐻(𝜃)𝜉𝑡                                                                         (2.26) 
                                                           
26 All 𝜀𝑥 disturbances, log deviations from steady state, have zero means.  
27 All methods’ general solution is same as the form of  𝜉𝑡= Φ(𝜉𝑡−1, 𝜀𝑡; 𝜃) when the parameter space 
leading to equilibrium determinacy is considered. 

29 
 
where 𝐹(𝜃), 𝐺(𝜃) and 𝐻(𝜃) are complicated nonlinear functions of the structural 
parameter vector 𝜃; 𝜉𝑡 denotes the 26 × 1 state vector of the system, including the model 
endogenous variables {𝑐𝑡,𝑦𝑡, 𝑖𝑡, 𝑞𝑡, 𝑠𝑡, 𝜋𝑡, 𝜋𝐻,𝑡, 𝜋𝐹,𝑡, 𝜓𝐹,𝑡, 𝑎𝑡, 𝑦𝑡
∗, 𝜋𝑡
∗, 𝑖𝑡
∗}, expectations at 
period 𝑡 {𝑐𝑡+1,𝑞𝑡+1, 𝜋𝑡+1, 𝜋𝐻,𝑡+1, 𝜋𝐹,𝑡+1, 𝑦𝑡+1
∗
, 𝜋𝑡+1
∗
}, the all disturbance terms (that are not 
i.i.d.) following an AR(1) process {𝜀𝑔,𝑡, 𝜀𝑎,𝑡, 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡, 𝜀𝑠,𝑡, 𝜀𝑔,𝑡
∗, 𝜀𝑎,𝑡
∗}; 𝜖𝑡 is a 10 × 1 vector of 
i.i.d innovations {𝜀𝑅,𝑡, 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡, 𝜀𝑅,𝑡
∗, 𝜀𝑐𝑝,𝑡
∗
, 𝜖𝑔,𝑡, 𝜖𝑎,𝑡, 𝜖𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡, 𝜖𝑟𝑝,𝑡, 𝜖𝑔,𝑡
∗, 𝜖𝑎,𝑡
∗}. The state-space 
representation, consisting of the transition (2.25) and measurement (2.26) equations, is 
the basic for econometric analysis. A key step in estimation of a linearized model is 
evaluation of its likelihood. If the innovation 𝜀𝑡 is assumed to be Gaussian, then the 
likelihood of the model can be evaluated with the Kalman filter.  
2.3.2 Data 
The model is estimated using quarterly data, including three G7 and five Australian series 
over the period 1993:Q1-2013:Q4, noting that inflation-targeting commenced in Australia 
in 1991:Q1. The details of the data are given in Appendix 2.B.1. In this chapter, the rest 
of the world is reasonably proxied by the G7 economies. The G7 series include inflation 
(the log percentage change in the GDP deflator), output (i.e., real GDP) and nominal 
interest rate, measured by weighted average of immediate interest rates for G7 countries28 
(per cent per annum), all taken from the OECD.Stat database. Australian data is obtained 
from the statistical tables published by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Output is measured by non-farm GDP. As there is 
no reliable data for non-farm inflation, seasonally adjusted inflation based on consumer 
price index-all groups excluding interest and tax changes of 1999–2000 is used29. As 
interest rate effect is excluded, the measure helps to appropriately estimate the cost 
channel effects. The interest rate is the cash rate (per cent per annum). Following 
Robinson (2013), the terms of trade and G7 GDP-weighted real exchange rate indices are 
directly observed from official statistics. The officially published real exchange rate and 
the terms of trade are the inverse of same variables in the model, so that the observables 
are converted into the model definition. Prior to the empirical analysis, the data is 
                                                           
28 Data for the G7 interest rate is combined using the CPI country weights in the OECD total: the United 
States (0.53), Japan (0.13), Germany (0.10), the United Kingdom (0.07), France (0.07), Italy (0.06), and 
Canada (0.04).  
29 In Australia, mortgage interest rate charges were used in the CPI to proxy the cost of housing during the 
period 1987:Q1 to1998:Q3. When examining the effect of monetary policy, inclusion of this variable in the 
CPI is problematic, as a tightening of monetary policy would automatically lead to an increase in the CPI. 
For this reason, inflation measure based on CPI, excluding interest rate tax changes of 1999-2000 is used.  

30 
 
transformed as follows. In order to ensure consistency with the model, nominal exchange 
rates are expressed in quarterly terms (annual interest rate is divided by four). The log-
difference of the terms of trade and the real exchange rate (scaled by 100 to convert them 
into percentage) are used before the model is taken to the data. The output variables are 
taken logarithm, then linearly de-trended and all other series are demeaned. The de-
trending and de-meaning ensure that the resulting variables used in the estimation are 
stationary as they represent the business cycle-related part of the original variable. In 
Figure 2.B.1 of the Appendix 2.B, the tick line illustrates the data used for empirical 
analysis.  
2.3.3 Bayesian inference and priors 
Bayesian methods are adopted to estimate non-calibrated parameters (𝜃) and to evaluate 
the quantitative importance of the cost channel and the UIP modification in the model30. 
In the framework, a prior distribution on parameters 𝑝(𝜃) is updated by sample 
information contained in the likelihood function 𝐿(𝑌𝑇|𝜃) to form a posterior distribution 
𝑝(𝜃|𝑌𝑇)31  
𝑝(𝜃|𝑌𝑇) ∝𝐿(𝑌𝑇|𝜃)𝑝(𝜃)                                                         (2.27) 
The prior is based on ‘non-sample’ information, so that the Bayesian method provides an 
ideal framework for combining different sources of information (Del Negro and 
Schorfheide 2011). Since the mapping from the DSGE model to its 𝐿(𝑌𝑇|𝜃) is nonlinear 
in 𝜃 as shown in the state space representation of the model (equations (2.25) and (2.26)), 
the construction of the posterior distribution is too complicated to evaluate analytically. 
Therefore, simulation techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, 
with the likelihood obtained at each draw through the Kalman filter, are used to obtain 
draws from the posterior distribution shown in equation (2.27). In the case of estimation 
of the structural DSGE model, the choice of MCMC procedure is usually the Random 
Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm which belongs to more general class of Metropolis-
Hastings algorithms. A detailed discussion of numerical techniques such as the RWM and 
                                                           
30 Bayesian methods help to estimate DSGE models with cross-equation restrictions by dealing well with 
both misspecification and identification problems. In the presence of those problems, advantages of the 
approach over alternatives are discussed by Canova (2007) and An and Schorfheide (2007).  
31 According to the Bayes theorem, 𝑝(𝜃|𝑌𝑇) is equal to 𝐿(𝑌𝑇|𝜃)𝑝(𝜃) 𝑝(𝑌𝑇)
⁄
 where 𝑌𝑇 is a set of actual 
observable data; 𝑝(𝑌𝑇) = ∫𝐿(𝑌𝑇|𝜃) 𝑝(𝜃)𝑑𝜃 is the marginal data density (log-likelihood) represents the 
posterior distribution, with the uncertainty associated with parameters integrated out, and therefore it also 
reflects the model prediction performance. Since 𝑝(𝑌𝑇) is not conditional on 𝜃, the theorem can be reduced 
to equation (2.27). 

31 
 
Kalman filter algorithms is provided by An and Shorfheide (2007), Fernandez-Villaverde 
(2010), Guerrón-Quintana and Nason (2012) and Del Negro and Schorfheide (2011, 
2013). 
The Bayesian framework naturally focuses on the evaluation of relative model fit. Bayes 
factors or posterior odds ratios32 are used to measure the relative merits amongst a number 
of competing models. The Bayes factor of model ℳ𝑗 versus model ℳ𝑠 is given by 
ℬℱ𝑗,𝑠|𝑌𝑇= 𝑝(𝑌𝑇| ℳ𝑗) 𝑝(𝑌𝑇| ℳ𝑠)
⁄
                                            (2.28) 
which summarizes the sample evidence in favour of ℳ𝑗 over ℳ𝑠. The terms 𝑝(𝑌𝑇| ℳ𝑗) 
and 𝑝(𝑌𝑇| ℳ𝑠) are the marginal likelihoods of ℳ𝑗 and ℳ𝑠, respectively. The marginal 
likelihood for ℳ𝑖 model is calculated as 𝑝(𝑌𝑇| ℳ𝑖) = ∫
𝐿(𝑌𝑇|𝜃, ℳ𝑖)𝑝𝑖(𝜃|ℳ𝑖)𝑑𝜃
𝜃
, 
where  𝐿(𝑌|𝜃, ℳ𝑖) is the likelihood function for the data 𝑌𝑇 conditional on the parameter 
vector and on the model. The marginal likelihood measure automatically penalizes 
models with additional parameters and increasing degrees of complexity.  
Recently, posterior predictive analysis where the actual data are compared to artificial 
data generated from an estimated DSGE model have become an important tool to assess 
absolute fit of the model (An and Schorfheide 2007). In particular, it has been standard 
to assess whether the models correctly replicate the empirical moments such as variables’ 
volatility, autocorrelation or their correlations. For this purpose, the model-implied 
moments are computed as follows.  Let 𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝 be an artificial sample of observations of the 
same sample size as the actual data set that is generated from the estimated DSGE model. 
Then the predictive distribution of 𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝 can be derived by   
𝑝(𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝|𝑌𝑇) = ∫𝑝(𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝|𝜃, 𝑌𝑇) 𝑝(𝜃|𝑌𝑇)𝑑𝜃                              (2.29) 
This predictive density reflects parameter uncertainty, captured by the posterior 
distribution 𝑝(𝜃|𝑌). The algorithm for generating draws from the predictive distribution 
is detailed by Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013)33.  
                                                           
32 If there are 𝑀 competing models, and one does not have strong views on which model is the true one 
(i.e., hence chooses equal prior weight for each model, 1 𝑀
⁄
), then the posterior odds ratio is reduced to the 
Bayes factor.  
33 Let ℎ(∙) be a model checking function (e.g., second moments). The posterior predictive distribution of 
ℎ(𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝) can be computed based on draws from the posterior predictive distribution of 𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝 shown in (29). 
In doing so, 𝑛 draws from 𝑝(𝜃|𝑌𝑇) are used to generate 𝑛 artificial samples (𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝 of length 𝑇). Then, for 
each of those 𝑛 artificial samples, ℎ(𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝) function is calculated. If 𝑛 is large enough, someone can build 
a histogram of those retained values such that each bucket has infinitely small width. This smoothed 

32 
 
Christopher Sims’s ‘csminwel’ optimization routine is used to obtain the posterior mode 
and to compute the Hessian matrix at the mode. To test the presence of the identification 
problem, over 40 optimization runs are launched, and different optimization routine 
always converges to the same mode value. Since a unique mode for the model is found, 
the Hessian from the optimization routine is used as a proposal density, properly scaled 
(𝑐= 0.3) to attain an acceptance rate between 20-30 per cent. For the RWM results, two 
independent chains of 100,000 draws each, in which 40,000 are used as an initial burn-in 
phase. Convergence of two chains is monitored using both the univariate and the 
multivariate convergence diagnostics variants of Brooks and Gelman (1998)34. 
Similar models have been estimated by Justiniano and Preston (2010a, b) and Robinson 
(2013) using Bayesian methods in the case of Australia. Therefore calibration and priors 
for parameters, 𝑝(𝜃), are closely followed their specifications. Some parameters, not well 
identified, are calibrated by standard values in the literature. For example, foreign and 
domestic economy discount factors, 𝛽∗and 𝛽, are calibrated to be 0.99, which is 
associated with a real interest rate of 4.0 per cent (annually) in steady state. The openness 
parameter, 𝛼, is calibrated to 0.185, consistent with the share of imports in GDP (0.2) 
over the inflation-targeting period (Kuttner and Robinson 2010). Attempts to estimate the 
openness parameter give implausibly low values.  
All remaining parameters are estimated and their prior assumptions are described in the 
first panel of Table 2.1. The priors are fairly uncontroversial with previous studies using 
Bayesian inference. The most priors for the G7 economy are specified as adopted by 
Justiniano and Preston (2010b). The only difference is that following Robinson (2013), 
slightly altered priors on the exogenous processes is used by assuming that a large 
economy would not be more volatile than its small economy counterparts. For Australia, 
the priors are deviated from those used by Justiniano and Preston (2010b) and Robinson 
(2013) in the following ways. First, similar to Justiniano and Preston (2010a), in order to 
keep structural parameters in positive values, gamma distributions are used instead of 
normal distributions. Second, the parameter governing the interest debt elasticity, 𝜙𝑎, is 
estimated instead of calibrated. The prior on 𝜙𝑎 is chosen as an inverse-gamma 
distribution with a mean of 0.01, consistent with Adolfson et al. (2007). Third, fairly loose 
priors for parameters of Calvo prices and backward indexation are adopted to freely 
                                                           
histogram is eventually the posterior predictive distribution of ℎ(𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝) and used to derive mean, median 
and percentiles of ℎ(𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝).   
34 Convergence is generally occurred after around 25000 draws, but in few cases more draws were needed.  

33 
 
determine the influence of the cost channel and UIP modification on those parameters. 
Forth, relatively tight priors for the parameters of habit formation in consumption, ℎ, 
elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods, 𝜂, and the intertemporal 
elasticity of substitution, 𝜎, are set. For instance, the parameter ℎ has a beta distribution 
centered at 0.7, which is close to the values used by Jääskelä and McKibbin (2010), 
Jääskelä and Nimark (2011), with a standard deviation of 0.1. The prior for 𝜂 is tightly 
centred at 1.5, which is the standard value used in the macro literature (e.g., Chari et al. 
2002). Finally, prior densities for parameters regarding modifications in the model are 
chosen based on previous relevant studies. For instance, consistent with Rabanal (2007), 
prior beta distribution with mean of 0.5 and standard deviation of 0.25 is chosen for the 
parameters on cost channel (𝑣∗, 𝑣𝐻 and 𝑣𝐹) to keep the parameters bounded between zero 
and one. Following Adolfson et al. (2008), a prior on the UIP modification parameter, 
𝜙𝑒, is specified as a beta distribution with mean 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.1.  
2.4 Empirical results 
2.4.1 The model estimation  
The posterior estimates of four versions of the models are reported in the last four panels 
of the Table 2.1. The model described in Section 2.2 is labelled the ‘full’ model where 
𝜐𝐻, 𝜐𝐹, 𝜐∗, 𝜙𝑒> 0. The model, fixing cost channel parameters at zero, 𝜐𝐻= 𝜐𝐹= υ∗= 0, 
is named the ‘no cost channel’ model, whereas the model without the assumption, implied 
by the forward premium puzzle where 𝜙𝑒= 0, is called the ‘no UIP modification’ model. 
Finally, the J-P model with 𝜐𝐻= 𝜐𝐹= υ∗= 𝜙𝑒= 0 is labelled the ‘baseline’ model. 
2.4.1.1 Posterior estimates of the full model 
Data are informative about the estimated parameters and the estimates are in line with the 
existing literature (e.g., Justiniano and Preston 2010a, b, Jääskelä and Nimark 2011 and 
Robinson 2013). The estimated degree of habit persistence (0.46) implies that external 
habit formation plays a moderate role compared to other studies (e.g, Robinson 2013). 
The estimated elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods (1.3) is closer 
to the estimates obtained by Jääskelä and Nimark (2011) and the calibrated value of 1.5 
used by Chari et al. (2002). The degree of domestic price stickiness (0.82) implies that 
domestic firms re-optimize prices every 5.5 quarters in Australia. Prices in the imported 
sector are adjusted slightly more frequently than are home goods prices, being re-

34 
 
optimized on average every 4.3 quarters. As found by Langcake and Robinson (2013), 
the estimates of the parameters 𝛿𝐻 and 𝛿𝐹 present adequate source of endogenous 
persistence in both domestic and imported goods price dynamics. The estimated policy 
parameters imply that RBA implements a strong anti-inflationary policy (𝜒𝜋= 1.90) and 
reflects concern for output growth (𝜒∆𝑦= 0.59) and output movements (𝜒𝑦= 0.27) in 
the inflation-targeting period. A reasonably high degree of interest-smoothing is 
estimated with a coefficient of 0.89. The posterior mean of the parameter 𝜙𝑎, measuring 
the elasticity of the risk premium with respect to the net foreign asset, is estimated around 
0.004, which is closer to the value (0.001) found by Jääskelä and Nimark (2011).   
The posterior distributions of the cost channel parameters (𝜐𝐻 and 𝜐𝐹) shift to the left 
hand side compared to prior distributions35, and 90 per cent posterior probability intervals 
of the parameters are [0.01, 0.71] and [0.06, 0.86], respectively. These positive and 
significant (different from zero) parameters provides evidence of the cost channel in 
Australia as obtained by Chang and Jansen (2014). However, the upper bounds of the 
intervals are far below one, implying that all firms (or all amounts of working capital for 
each firm) are not subject to the cost channel constraint. Another important parameter is 
𝜙𝑒, governing how much the expected depreciation is allowed to affect the risk premium 
in the UIP condition. A posterior mean of the parameter 𝜙𝑒 is 0.32, closer to the value of 
0.30 estimated by Adolfson et al. (2013)36. The 90 per cent posterior probability interval 
of the parameter includes values between 0.25 and 0.37, indicating preliminary evidence 
for the violation of the standard UIP condition. The formal test on quantitative importance 
of the cost channel and the UIP modification is conducted in Section 2.4.2.   
The risk premium, technology and preference shocks are highly persistent. In contrast to 
previous papers (e.g., Justiniano and Preston 2010a), the price markup shock in the import 
sector is less persistent (𝜌𝑐𝑝𝐹= 0.31), supporting the view that the presence of the cost 
channel captures the persistent part of the shock. Further evidence of the finding is that 
the estimated autoregressive coefficient is substantially increased when the cost channel 
is shut down. One standard deviation quarterly monetary policy shock, 𝜎𝑅, is estimated 
to be 12 basis points, closer to the value reported by Robinson (2013). Estimates of 
standard deviations for other shocks are entirely consistent with the literature. 
                                                           
35 Posterior modes are 𝜐𝐻= 0.18 and 𝜐𝐹= 0.38, with a relatively large standard deviation.   
36 The estimate is twice lower than the value found in Adolfson et al. (2008), showing that the suggested 
UIP modification produces a hump-shaped response of the real exchange rate to a monetary policy shock.

The estimates of the G7 economy are mostly similar to the findings obtained by Justiniano 
and Preston (2010b) and Robinson (2013), even though they estimate a slightly different 
model with labour market imperfections using the US data. The estimated degree of habit 
persistence, ℎ∗, is 0.6, which is closer to the value used by Boldrin et al. (2001). The 
posterior mean of the inverse elasticity of labour supply, 𝜑∗= 0.99, is entirely consistent 
with the value (one) calibrated by Robinson (2013). The parameter of price indexation is 
estimated with the value of 𝛿∗= 0.29, slightly lower than previous findings (e.g., 0.42 
and 0.58 obtained by Robinson 2013 and Justiniano and Preston 2010b, respectively). 
The posterior mean of the cost channel parameter, 𝜐∗, is very close to its prior, implying 
that there is not enough information in the data about the parameter. The possible 
explanation of the result can be the same as that as found by Chowdhurry et al. (2006), 
there is no significant impact of nominal interest rate on inflation dynamics in some of 
the G7 countries such as Germany, Japan and Italy. The estimated parameters of the 
policy rule for the G7 economy are consistent with conventional wisdom. The estimated 
degree of interest-smoothing, 𝜌𝑅
∗= 0.9, the response to inflation, 𝜒𝜋
∗= 1.94, and the 
response to the level of output, 𝜒𝑦
∗= 0.04, are similar to those reported by Robinson 
(2013). The result suggests that monetary authorities of the G7 countries pursue a strong 
anti-inflationary policy with a high degree of interest-smoothing for the last two decades. 
Estimates of exogenous process for G7 economy are in line with the existing literature. 
2.4.1.2 Sensitivity analysis of parameters with respect to alternative specifications 
This section assesses how the structural parameters are affected by the presence of the 
cost channel and/or the UIP modification. The posterior estimates for all structural 
parameters under different specifications are shown in the last six columns of Table 2.1. 
Figure 2.1 shows the posterior distributions for selected parameters, which are more 
influenced by different specifications. The remaining parameters are quite robust to the 
alternative specifications. The presence of the cost channel and the UIP modification 
largely influences the estimates of the domestic parameters. In most of the figure, the 
distribution shifts are substantial when comparing alternative models.  
There is a large variation in the estimate of the parameter ℎ across specifications. The 
best fitting values are relatively low under baseline specification, with a mean around 
0.31. When adding both extensions into the baseline model, the distribution shifts to right 
to assign larger probabilities to values closer to 0.45.

The posterior distribution for the parameter 𝜎 falls around 0.90-0.95 under the baseline 
and no UIP modification specifications, while the distribution moves to the left when the 
presented UIP modification is introduced into the model. The means of the parameters, 
𝜃𝐻 and 𝜃𝐹, are around 0.92 and 0.82 respectively under no cost channel model. This value 
of 0.92, corresponding to average duration of domestic price contracts is 3 years, is

implausibly high in the context of available microeconomic evidence. However, the 
distributions of 𝜃𝐻 and 𝜃𝐹 move toward values around 0.8 and 0.75 for the models with 
the cost channel. This finding is in line with Christiano et al. (2005), showing that the 
presence of the cost channel reduces the model’s reliance on sticky prices37. When adding 
both extensions into the baseline model, the posterior distribution for the parameter 𝛿𝐹 is 
shifted to a negatively skewed distribution, with mode around 0.6. The position of the 
distributions for the parameter 𝜑 heavily depends on the specification of the UIP 
condition.  
It appears that the monetary policy reaction parameters toward inflation and output seem 
to be sensitive to the alternative specifications. The reaction toward inflation is estimated 
to be higher under the full specification compared to others. The posterior distributions 
for the parameter, 𝜌𝑎, show that the model with no cost channel has difficulty in capturing 
persistence in the technology shock. When the cost channel is introduced, the posterior 
distribution shifts to the left. If the UIP condition modification is introduced into the 
baseline model, then the posterior distributions for the parameter, 𝜌𝑟𝑝, move towards a 
value around 0.87, consistent with the result shown by Adolfson et al. (2008) that the 
persistence in the risk premium shock decreases under the specification with the UIP 
modification.  
The standard deviation of preference shock, 𝜎𝑔, is the most heavily influenced standard 
deviation under different specifications. The posterior distribution for 𝜎𝑔 takes high 
probability mass around 2.3, and when introducing the cost channel and modifying the 
UIP condition, the distribution shifts to the right to assign larger probabilities to values 
around 3. As argued by Robinson (2013), this relatively high standard deviation may 
reflect the fact that the preference shock plays a vital role in capturing the volatility of 
output in the model, featuring a simple production process, and no financial and labour 
markets.  
The results here are not intended to show that one specification has to be preferred to the 
alternatives. However, the results provide considerable evidence that the estimates for 
parameters in the presented model are far from robust to different specifications. The 
parameter sensitivity analysis suggests that the quantitative change in the estimated 
model’s performance regarding alternative specifications comes from two sources such 
                                                           
37 The explanation for the sensitivity of the price stickiness parameter is detailed by Del Negro et al. (2014).

as the difference in the equation forms (Phillips curves and UIP) and the change in the 
estimated parameters.   
2.4.2 Model fit and evaluation 
This section assesses whether the presence of the cost channel and the UIP modification 
improves the model fit using in-sample fit, relative fit and absolute fit assessments.   
2.4.2.1 In-sample fit  
In order to assess the in-sample fit of alternative models, Figure 2.B1 of the Appendix 
2.B reports the actual data and alternative (full and baseline) models’ Kalman filtered 
one-sided predicted values38 of the observed variables, computed using the posterior 
mean of the estimated parameters. The in-sample fit of both models appears to be 
reasonably good, with the exception of the inflation and the change in real exchange rate 
in Australia. The inflation and change in real exchange rate are quite volatile at quarterly 
frequency and difficult to predict as discussed by Jääskelä and Nimark (2011).  
However, the predicted inflation of both models shows co-movements with the actual 
inflation. The estimated models fit well with the G7 actual data. From the first visual 
diagnostic of the alternative models, the presence of both cost channel and UIP 
modification improves the in-sample fit of the model. For instance, the full model 
explains better the volatility of changes in the real exchange rate compared to the baseline 
model. However, the graphical inspection makes it difficult to assess the comparative 
measure of fit. Hence, the relative fit of the model is analysed in the next section.   
2.4.2.2 Relative fit of alternative models: Bayes factor comparison   
Table 2.2 reports the log marginal data densities39 of the models, along with the Bayes 
factors, computed by considering the full model as the null hypothesis. Comparing 
posterior log marginal data densities, the baseline model yields the lowest fit. Regarding 
the Bayes factor as an evaluation criterion, the data strongly supports the full model with 
both cost channel and UIP modification compared to alternative models.  
                                                           
38 The Kalman filter estimates (one-step ahead predictions) can be interpreted as the fitted value of a 
regression. 
39 Considering that marginal log-likelihood penalizes over-parameterization, the full model does not 
necessarily rank better if the presence of cost channel and UIP modification does not sufficiently help in 
explaining the data.

Notes: The table reports Bayes factor comparing the model ℳ0 to ℳ1(or ℳ2 or ℳ3). The log marginal 
data densities reported here are computed from the posterior draws using the modified harmonic mean 
approximation, described by Geweke (1999).  
First, to evaluate the importance of the cost channel in the full model, the ℳ0 model is 
compared to the no cost channel model, ℳ1. The marginal data density of ℳ0 is 5.11 
larger than the densities of ℳ1 on a log-scale that translates into a Bayes factor of 165.7. 
According to Kass and Raftery (1995)40, a Bayes factor of this size offers ‘very strong’ 
evidence in favour of the full model with the cost channel (𝜐𝐻, 𝜐𝐹, 𝜐∗> 0). This result is 
in line with the finding obtained by Chang and Jansen (2014) in the sense that the cost 
channel of monetary policy is operative in Australia. Second, when assessing a hypothesis 
𝜙𝑒> 0 in the full model against the alternative 𝜙𝑒= 0, the Bayes factor comparing ℳ0 
to ℳ2 amounts to 343.8. The result also shows ‘very strong’ evidence in favour of the 
presence of UIP modification. This is in line with the finding of Adolfson et al. (2008) 
that the modified UIP is strongly preferable to a standard UIP specification according to 
the Bayesian posterior odds. Finally, the full model ℳ0: 𝜐𝐻, 𝜐𝐹, 𝜐∗, 𝜙𝑒> 0 is compared 
to the baseline model ℳ3: 𝜐𝐻= 𝜐𝐹= 𝜐∗= 𝜙𝑒= 0. The Bayes factor of 578.2 offers 
‘very strong’ evidence in favour of ℳ0, hence the presence of both cost channel and UIP 
modification in the model is supported by the data. 
2.4.2.3 Absolute fit of alternative models 
Table 2.3 shows the second moments implied by the estimated models and compares with 
those measured in the actual data to evaluate each model’s empirical performance.  
 
                                                           
40 Kass and Raftery (1995) provide an interpretative scale to judge the strength of the evidence in favour of 
an alternative model with respect to the model in the null hypothesis. A Bayes factor between 1 and 3 is 
‘not worth more than a bare mention’, between 3 and 20 suggests a ‘positive’ evidence, between 20 and 
150 suggests a ‘strong’ evidence, and larger than 150 ‘very strong’ evidence in favour of one of the two 
models.

Notes: The model columns report medians and 90 per cent posterior probability bands for the moments 
computed from 𝑝(𝑌𝑟𝑒𝑝|𝑌𝑇). In order to build this distribution, 1200 draws from the posterior distribution 
of parameters are used to generate artificial samples (conditional on each draw) of observed variables of 
the same sample size as the actual data set from the model. For each of those 1200 artificial samples, the 
moment statistics are calculated, and the median, 5th and 95th percentiles are derived.   
From Table 2.3, the volatility and autocorrelation in most observables are reasonably well 
captured by both models. In particular, the model matches well the second moments of 
the G7 data. The medians of standard deviation (SD) for the change in terms of trade 
implied by the models are very close to its actual counterpart. The 90 per cent posterior 
bands for Australian output and the change in real exchange rate generated by the models 
contain their actual standard deviations. Both models tend to overestimate the standard 
deviation of inflation and interest rate in Australia.  
However, the ability of the models to accurately replicate the volatility of the observables 
does not provide a predetermined conclusion since a likelihood-based estimator attempts 
to match entire auto-covariance function of the data. Therefore it is necessary to carry out 
the predicative check analysis for other moments such as autocorrelation and cross-
correlation. As for persistence, both models predict well for interest rate, and output, with 
the 90 per cent intervals for the change in terms of trade.  
The full model replicates the volatility and persistence in the data relatively well 
compared to the baseline model. In particular, the full model accounts for both volatility 
and persistence in the change of real exchange rate, which has been a challenge for open-
economy models (Chari et al. 2002 and Justiniano and Preston 2006). The baseline 

43 
 
specification fails to generate the persistence in the first difference of real exchange rate. 
Moreover, the median standard deviations and median autocorrelations under the full 
specification are closer to their actual moments compared to the statistics under the 
baseline specification. 
Figure 2.B.2 in Appendix 2.B, displaying the cross-correlation among domestic 
observables, supports the full specification in the sense that its cross-correlation is 
somewhat closer to those measured in the actual data. The 90 per cent posterior predictive 
intervals for the serial correlation of output, inflation and interest rate contain their actual 
counterparts. In addition, the shape of autocorrelation functions for the first-differences 
in the real exchange rate and terms of trade is qualitatively similar to their actual statistics. 
For the cross-correlations, the full model is quite successful in replicating the lead-lag 
relationships among most observables. The model reproduces the relationship that current 
inflation leads to higher interest rate in the future, presented in the data. In addition, the 
absolute fit for the cross-correlation between the change in real exchange rate/terms of 
trade and other variables are improved under the full specification.  
Overall, introducing the cost channel and the UIP modification into the model improves 
in-sample, relative and absolute fits. Therefore, these extensions should not be ignored in 
terms of model fit, particularly when someone with priors displayed in Table 2.1 employs 
a simple small open economy DSGE model for conducting monetary policy analysis.      
2.4.3 Impulse response functions 
This section assesses the dynamics of the full and baseline models using impulse 
responses. The purpose is to evaluate how the transmission mechanism of monetary 
policy and other structural shocks is influenced by the presence of the cost channel and 
the UIP modification in the estimated model.  
2.4.3.1 Transmission of a monetary policy shock  
This section addresses the question, does the presence of both the cost channel and the 
UIP modification help the model to reproduce empirical responses of key macroeconomic 
variables (inflation, output and the real exchange rate) to a monetary policy shock? Figure 
2.2 displays the impulse responses of the full and baseline models to an unexpected 25 
basis point increase to the (quarterly) Australian cash rate for selected endogenous 
variables.  

44 
 
Figure 3.2.2 Impulse responses to a tightening AU monetary policy shock 
 
 
Notes: For each plot, the blue dashed and black solid lines represent the responses at the posterior mean 
and 5th, 95th percentiles of the posterior distribution under the baseline and full specification, respectively.   
The unexpected monetary policy shock increases nominal interest rate temporarily. There 
is some degree of interest-rate inertia in both models as the shock is only offset by a 
gradual lowering of the interest rate. The interest rate returns to its steady state value after 
1.5 years. In the baseline model, the shape of real exchange rate response is in line with 
Dornbusch’s (1976) well-known exchange rate overshooting hypothesis, stating that an 
increase in the interest rate should cause the exchange rate to appreciate instantaneously, 
and then depreciate. The combination of increase in real interest rate and the real 
exchange rate appreciation reduces output by lowering both domestic and external 
demands. The lower domestic demand decreases real marginal cost, which in turn 
immediately lowers domestic goods inflation. An appreciation in exchange rate also 
lowers the imported goods inflation, and hence overall inflation decreases in the impact 
period.  
However, the co-existence of the cost channel and the UIP modification in combination 
with the estimated parameters affects to the size of responses in the impact period and 
time lags of the maximum effect. For instance, the peak response of inflation to the shock 
in the full model is a fall of approximately 0.28 percentage points in one quarter after the 
impact period. The shape of inflation response implies that the estimated demand side 
effects of monetary policy strongly dominate the supply side effects. This result in 
combination with the analysis of the relative fit suggests that though there is evidence for 
the cost channel in Australia over the inflation-targeting period, its strength is not 
sufficient to produce the price puzzle. The shape of inflation response obtained in the full 
model is in line with the existing empirical studies for Australia (e.g., Hodge et al. 2008, 
Robinson 2013, Jääskelä and Jennings 2010, Leu 2011 and Dungey et al. 2013).

In the full model, the response of real exchange rate is a little hump-shaped, but not as 
pronounced as that shown by Adolfson et al. (2008)41. The shape of the response is more 
consistent with the existing empirical results for Australia (e.g., Dungey and Pagan 2000, 
Liu 2010, and Jääskelä and McKibbin 2010). The results suggest that the standard UIP 
condition is violated in Australia, and the presented UIP modification has a potential to 
reproduce the delayed overshooting response of the real exchange rate in response to a 
monetary policy shock. Consistent with empirical evidence provided in data-driven VAR 
models (e.g., Dungey and Pagan 2000 and Jääskelä and Jennings 2010), the policy shock 
leads to output contraction in the hump-shaped manner. As discussed by Christiano et al. 
(2011b), the hump-shaped response of the output emerges from the persistent responses 
of real interest rate and real exchange rate to the shock.  
Figure 2.3 displays impulse responses of both models to an unexpected 25 basis point 
increase to the (quarterly) G7 interest rate.

Notes: For each plot, the blue dashed and black solid lines represent the responses at the posterior mean 
and 5th, 95th percentiles of the posterior distribution under the baseline and full specification, 
respectively.   
The impact of monetary policy tightening on the G7 economy is estimated to be similar 
in both models. The policy tightening leads to a fall in inflation and output in the G7 
                                                           
41 The shape of real exchange rate responses to a monetary policy shock depends on the value of the 
parameter 𝜙𝑒, which is estimated as 0.32, implying relatively less impact on the country risk premium from 
exchange rate changes.

economy. The shape of the responses shows more persistence and inertia. For instance, 
the peak response of inflation and output to the shock occurs after 1-2 and 3-4 quarters, 
respectively and the effects on the economy are more prolonged.    
The hump-shaped responses of Australian variables to the G7 monetary policy shock in 
the full model are in line with the VAR-based results (e.g., Liu 2010 and Dungey et al. 
2013). The monetary contraction decreases the interest rate difference between Australian 
and the G7 economies, which leads to a current depreciation of the Australian exchange 
rate. The depreciation makes imported goods more expensive, and hence increases the 
terms of trade and overall inflation. In addition, the shock reduces the real interest rate in 
the initial periods. The lower real interest rate and real exchange rate depreciation boost 
the domestic and external demands, which increase the domestic output.  
2.4.3.2 Transmission of other shocks 
Figures 2.B.3-2.B.8 in Appendix 2.B compare the impulse responses of the full and 
baseline models to other structural shocks, including consumption preference, 
technology, risk premium and price markup shocks in Australia and the G7. The results 
reveal the importance of the cost channel and the UIP modification in reproducing 
amplified, more persistent and prolonged responses, which are in line with the empirical 
evidence. In both models, the response to a positive demand shock (i.e., preference shock) 
in Australia instantaneously increases both output and inflation. The nominal interest rate 
increases accordingly responding to the rise in inflation and output, and then gradually 
decreases to the steady state. The impact rise in the interest rate leads to an appreciation 
of nominal exchange rate, which ultimately decreases the terms of trade. Both higher 
inflation and the appreciation of nominal exchange rate explain the appreciation in real 
exchange rate. The differences in the responses of the Australian variables to a positive 
AU and G7 consumption preference shocks come from the different impacts on the real 
exchange rate. 
Impulse responses to a positive technology shock in Australia are standard in the sense 
that output increases persistently and inflation decreases. The nominal interest rate is 
reduced in a hump-shaped manner. The fall in the interest rate depreciates the nominal 
exchange rate, which consequently increases the terms of trade. The full model’s 
responses of output, real exchange rate and terms of trade to the shock are also amplified 
and more prolonged compared to those in the baseline model. The hump-shaped 

47 
 
responses of output, interest rate and real exchange rate are in line with findings obtained 
by Jääskelä and McKibbin (2010) who estimate a small open economy DSGE model with 
learning rules for expectations using Australian data. When comparing the models’ 
responses, there is a difference in the shape of real exchange rate response. For the full 
model, both lower inflation and nominal exchange rate depreciation lead to a depreciation 
of real exchange rate in the impact period. However, for the baseline model, as found by 
Nimark (2009), the real exchange rate appreciates initially since the negative impact of 
law of one price gap (𝜓𝐹,𝑡) dominates the terms of trade effect.     
In both models, the response to a positive price markup shock to domestic producers is 
characterized similar to those found by Liu (2010) in the sense that the temporary negative 
supply shock drives up domestic goods’ inflation immediately and decreases output42. 
However, the full model’s responses of real exchange rate and output are more persistent 
compared to those in the baseline model.  
The full model’s responses of Australian variables to the risk premium shock are entirely 
consistent with the existing VAR-based responses to an exchange rate shock found by 
Manalo et al. (2014). However, there are a couple of differences in the responses of the 
models. First, as obtained by Liu (2010) and Leu (2011), responses of output, real 
exchange rate, terms of trade and interest rate are more persistent and stronger in the full 
model. A likely reason is that the presented risk premium function (2.3) in combination 
with the estimated parameters leads to a hump-shaped response of real exchange rate, 
thereby affects the other variables’ responses through endogenous propagation in the full 
model. Second, overall inflation responds differently to the shock, though the responses 
of inflation are statistically insignificant: inflation tends to increase in the full model, 
while it likely decreases in the baseline model.  
A positive G7 preference shock leads to a rise in inflation, output and interest rate in the 
G7 economy. The response of G7 variables to the G7 technology shock is standard: 
inflation decreases immediately and then slowly recovers, output increases and interest 
rate is decreased gradually. The impacts of a positive G7 price markup shock on the G7 
economy are estimated to be similar in both models: inflation increases immediately, and 
                                                           
42 Responding to this situation, the nominal interest rate increases accordingly. Because of the rising 
inflation and the nominal exchange rate appreciation, the real exchange rate appreciates, reducing the 
imported goods’ inflation. Consequently, the fall in the imported goods’ inflation and the rise in domestic 
goods’ inflation leads to a fall in terms of trade. 

48 
 
output decreases persistently. Responding to the stagflation, G7 interest rate increases 
accordingly and then decreases gradually to the equilibrium.  
There is evidence of the international transmission from the G7 economy to Australia. As 
shown by Dungey and Fry (2003) and Liu (2010), the positive external demand shock 
also drives a rise in Australian output, inflation, interest rate, terms of trade and real 
exchange rate depreciation with the maximum positive response occurring after 3-5 
quarters43. When comparing the models, the shock causes hump-shaped responses of 
inflation and real exchange rate in the full model. When considering the impact of the G7 
technology shock on Australia, both models suggest a fall in the terms of trade and a real 
exchange rate appreciation. For the baseline model, the impact on inflation, interest rate 
and output are insignificant, whereas the full model suggests a fall in output. The 
controversial response of the output is a consequence of two opposite effects. First, the 
G7 output instantaneously increases Australian output by improving the demand for 
export. Second, the real exchange rate appreciation reduces Australian output through 
weakening domestic goods’ competiveness in the international market.  
Turning to the impact of a positive G7 price markup shock on Australia, the real exchange 
rate plays a key role in the propagation of the shock as reported by Dungey et al. (2013). 
The rise in G7 inflation leads to a depreciation of real exchange rate, increasing the 
demand for Australian export. The strength in export demand drives a rise in both output 
and the terms of trade. However, the impacts on inflation and interest are very weak. The 
responses of Australian variables in the full model are more amplified.  
2.4.4 Variance decomposition 
Table 2.B.1 of Appendix 2.B reports the variance decompositions of the full and baseline 
models, measuring the importance of individual shocks to fluctuations in the Australian 
observables, at the mean, 5th and 95th percentiles of the posterior distribution. The 
purpose here is to assess whether the variance shares of the observed series attributed to 
the individual shock is affected by the presence of the cost channel and the UIP 
modification.  
                                                           
43 The shock leads to nominal exchange rate depreciation through raising the G7 interest rate. Since the 
nominal depreciation combined with the rise in G7 inflation dominates the effect of Australian inflation, 
the Australian real exchange rate depreciates consequently. Australian output is increased due to the higher 
external demand.  

49 
 
In general, the full model contains a reasonable endogenous transmission mechanism. 
Introducing both the cost channel and the UIP modification into the model improves 
internal propagation of shocks within the model, and hence significantly affects the 
variance shares of Australian observables attributed to the individual shock. As obtained 
by Manalo et al. (2014), Australia’s exchange rate acts as a shock absorber in the sense 
that the real exchange rate movements have served to mitigate the impact of the risk 
premium shock on the Australian economy. For instance, the real exchange rate 
movement is mainly driven by the risk premium shock (more than 70 per cent), which 
explains 21-38 per cent of the variance of output in the short-to-medium run44. In line 
with the existing literature (e.g., Voss and Willard 2009, Nimark 2009 and Liu 2010), a 
small fraction (up to 15 per cent) of the output variance is attributed to a monetary policy 
shock. In addition, the monetary policy shock provides a very small contribution to the 
exchange rate fluctuations as shown by Faust and Rogers (2003) for the US, and Jääskelä 
and Nimark (2011), Dungey et al. (2013) and Rees et al. (2015) for Australia. Similar to 
Justiniano and Preston (2010b), both models suggest that all G7 shocks account for a 
small share (less than 7 per cent) of the variation in Australian observables. Although the 
presence of the cost channel and the UIP modification increases the variance shares 
attributed to all G7 shocks, the variance share of the full model is still small compared to 
those obtained by Liu (2010) and Robinson (2013)45.  
In the context of the estimated full model, Australian output is mainly driven by 
preference, risk premium and domestic producer’s price markup shocks in the short-to-
medium run. The preference and price markup shocks account for 45-58 per cent of the 
output fluctuations in the short-run, and then gradually decrease to about 20 per cent in 
the long-run. The risk premium shock accounts for one-third of the output fluctuations in 
the medium-run. The highest contribution of the technology shock in output fluctuations 
(about 13 per cent) is observed in the medium-run as found by Liu (2010) and Nimark 
(2009) for Australia. When comparing the models’ variance decompositions, there are 
significant changes in the variance share attributed to technology and monetary policy 
shocks46. In both models, price markup shocks account for 74-88 per cent of Australian 
                                                           
44 Short-run is defined as 1-4 quarters, medium-run is defined as 8 quarters, and the variance in the long-
run refers to stationary variance (or unconditional variance).  
45 In general, as discussed by Robinson (2013), the relatively low contribution of foreign economy shocks 
may be because the foreign sector is being modelled as the G7 economy, whereas in recent years strong 
demand for commodities from China has been a key factor explaining the rapid rise in Australia’s term of 
trade.  
46 The baseline model suggests that the technology shock accounts for an implausibly small share (less than 
2 per cent) of the Australian output.

inflation fluctuations, which is a consequence of the small estimates of the parameter on 
the marginal cost (𝑘𝐻(1 + 𝛽𝛿𝐻)
⁄
. This result is in line with the finding shown by Liu 
(2010) that the shocks explain about 65 per cent of inflation volatility. The endogenous 
transmission in the full model is improved compared to the baseline model in the sense 
that the variance share attributed to the technology and preference shocks is raised to 20 
per cent in the medium-run.  
The real exchange rate movements (about 70-80 per cent) are mainly determined by the 
risk premium shock. The superior role of the risk premium shock suggests that the 
Australian dollar moves mainly in response to shocks to the foreign exchange, commodity 
and capital markets as exogenous shifts in the risk premium rather than reacting to shocks 
originating in the domestic economy. The result is consistent with the observation 
discussed by Meese and Rogoff (1983) that movements in the exchange rate cannot be 
explained by the macroeconomic fundamentals. However, there is evidence that the 
presence of both the cost channel and the UIP modification in the model improves the 
endogenous propagation of other shocks passing through the real exchange rate dynamics. 
For example, the real exchange rate’s variance share attributed to the preference and the 
import’s price markup shocks is increased from 5 per cent to 25 per cent. As found by 
Voss and Willard (2009), only a small share of Australia’s exchange rate movements is 
attributable to foreign variable shocks. The terms of trade movements are mostly 
explained by risk premium and import’s price markup shocks.  
Preference, price markup and monetary policy shocks are major sources (explaining 65-
80 per cent) of interest rate volatility in the short-to-medium run. This result supports the 
view that the cash rate systematically responds to the inflation and changes in real activity 
following the Taylor-type rule. In the medium-to-long run, the risk premium shock is 
predominantly important for interest rate volatility since monetary policy and price 
markup shocks are less persistent, and the risk premium shock is an important driver of 
the Australian business cycle. 
2.5 Conclusion 
This chapter has examined the quantitative role of the cost channel and the UIP 
modification in an estimated small open economy DSGE model, consisting of a small 
economy (Australia) and a large economy (the G7 economy). For this purpose, the model 
developed by the Justiniano and Preston (2010a) is augmented to include two novel 

51 
 
features, namely (i) the cost channel of monetary policy and (ii) the UIP modification 
allowing the risk premium is negatively correlated with the expected depreciation. 
Alternatives to the model have been estimated using Bayesian methods based on the data 
for Australia and the G7 covering the period 1993:Q1 to 2013:Q4.  
A number of interesting results emerge from the empirical analysis. First, the estimates 
for structural parameters of the model are sensitive to variations in model specifications, 
implying that quantitative changes in the model performance are associated with both the 
difference in the equation form (Phillips curves and UIP condition) and the changes in 
the estimated parameters. Second, the analysis of the model comparison based on Bayes 
factor and second moments suggest that the presence of the cost channel and the presented 
UIP modification improves the model fit. The results provide empirical evidence for the 
existence of the cost channel and the violation of the standard UIP in Australia over the 
inflation-targeting period. The primary role played by the cost channel in the full model 
is to generate inflation inertia without obtaining a very high degree of domestic price 
stickiness. The UIP modification enables the full model to generate both persistence and 
volatility in real exchange rate dynamics. Third, the impulse response analysis reveals (i) 
no evidence for the cost channel interpretation of the price puzzle, supporting a view that 
the puzzle obtained in VARs likely comes from misspecification, and (ii) evidence of the 
delayed overshooting puzzle, possibly resolved by the presented UIP modification. 
Finally, Australia’s real exchange rate movements over the inflation-targeting period 
have broadly played a stabilising role in the economy. In addition, monetary policy shocks 
have been mainly absorbed by the output, and play a minor role in accounting for the real 
exchange rate volatility. The slight effect of monetary policy shock in explaining 
variations of macroeconomic variables is in line with findings of other DSGE models 
developed in the case of the Australian economy (e.g., Voss and Willard 2009, Nimark 
2009, Jääskelä and Nimark 2011 and Rees et al. 2015). 
This chapter has also provided implications for designing optimal monetary policy that 
helps to stabilize the macroeconomy. First, the strong dominance of the demand side 
effects of monetary policy over its supply side effect in Australia suggests that 
implementing the Taylor principle47 promotes macroeconomic stability by avoiding self-
fulfilling inflation expectations in an emerging economy, having similar characteristics 
                                                           
47 The Taylor principle states that 1 per cent rise in inflation should be met by greater than 1 per cent rise 
in the nominal interest rate. If the cost channel was strong enough, then the Taylor principle could actually 
destabilize fluctuations in inflation expectations (Christiano et al. 2011a).  

52 
 
with Australia. Second, in the developing countries, it is more likely that the cost channel 
is strong and the standard UIP condition is violated due to weak financial market 
development. In such cases, policy makers should employ an open economy model with 
both the cost channel and presented UIP modification in proposing monetary policy 
actions.  
The estimated full model has provided significant insights about the transmission of 
shocks and their relevance in the business cycle. However, the present model remains 
stylised and can be further developed. To improve the model performance, future 
extensions may include (i) incorporating alternative modelling of expectations (e.g., news 
shocks, sticky information and adaptive learning) and (ii) introducing labour market and 
financial frictions into the model. It is left for the next chapter to assess the importance of 
news shocks in explaining labour market and business cycle fluctuations using an 
estimated small open economy model, augmented with the theory of involuntary 
unemployment proposed by Galí (2011).

Appendix 2.A Equations of the log-linearized model 
The steady state of the model is characterized by zero inflation and balanced trade. All 
variables are to be interpreted as log-deviation from their respective steady state values 
(𝑥𝑡= 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑋𝑡𝑋
⁄ ))48.  
2.A.1 Domestic economy (Australia) 
Euler equation:    
                   𝑐𝑡−ℎ𝑐𝑡−1 = 𝐸𝑡(𝑐𝑡+1 −ℎ𝑐𝑡) −𝜎−1(1 −ℎ)(𝑖𝑡−𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1) 
                                               + 𝜎−1(1 −ℎ)(𝜀𝑔,𝑡−𝐸𝑡𝜀𝑔,𝑡+1)                                               (2.A.1) 
Goods market clearing:  
𝑦𝑡= (1 −𝛼)𝑐𝑡+ 𝛼𝜂(2 −𝛼)𝑠𝑡+ 𝛼𝜂𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ 𝛼𝑦𝑡
∗                                 (2.A.2) 
where 𝜓𝐹,𝑡= (𝑒𝑡+ 𝑝𝑡
∗) −𝑝𝐹,𝑡 denotes the law of one price gap, and 𝑠𝑡= 𝑝𝐹,𝑡−𝑝𝐻,𝑡 is 
the terms of trade.  
Time differences in the terms of trade: 
       Δ𝑠𝑡= 𝜋𝐹,𝑡−𝜋𝐻,𝑡  
                                         
                      (2.A.3) 
where 𝜋𝐹,𝑡= 𝑝𝐹,𝑡−𝑝𝐹,𝑡−1 and 𝜋𝐻,𝑡= 𝑝𝐻,𝑡−𝑝𝐻,𝑡−1 respectively denote the inflation of 
imported goods and domestic goods.  
The real exchange rate: 
                   𝑞𝑡= 𝑒𝑡+ 𝑝𝑡
∗−𝑝𝑡= 𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ (1 −𝛼)𝑠𝑡                                                           (2.A.4) 
The real exchange rate therefore depends on deviations from the law of one price and the 
terms of trade.  
Domestic firms’ Phillips curve, extended with the cost channel:  
   𝜋𝐻,𝑡−𝛿𝐻𝜋𝐻,𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝐸𝑡(𝜋𝐻,𝑡+1 −𝛿𝐻𝜋𝐻,𝑡) + 𝑘𝐻𝑚𝑐𝑡+ 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡              (2.A.5) 
where 𝑘𝐻=
(1−𝜃𝐻)(1−𝜃𝐻𝛽)
𝜃𝐻
;  
Real marginal cost:  
                   𝑚𝑐𝑡= 𝜑𝑦𝑡−(1 + 𝜑)𝜀𝑎,𝑡+ 𝛼𝑠𝑡+ 𝜎(1 −ℎ)−1(𝑐𝑡−ℎ𝑐𝑡−1) + 𝜐𝐻𝑖𝑡 
Retailers’ Phillips curve, extended with the cost channel: 
𝜋𝐹,𝑡−𝛿𝐹𝜋𝐹,𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝐸𝑡(𝜋𝐹,𝑡+1 −𝛿𝐹𝜋𝐹,𝑡) + 𝑘𝐹(𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ 𝜐𝐹𝑖𝑡) + 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡 (2.A.6) 
where 𝑘𝐹=
(1−𝜃𝐹)(1−𝜃𝐹𝛽)
𝜃𝐹
.  
CPI inflation:  
                𝜋𝑡= 𝜋𝐻,𝑡+ 𝛼∆𝑠𝑡   
    
                                                      (2.A.7) 
                                                           
48 Exceptions are:  the nominal and real exchange rate are defined as 𝑒𝑡= log(𝑒̃𝑡𝑒̃
⁄ ), 𝑞𝑡= log(𝑞̃𝑡𝑞̃
⁄ ); 
interest 
rates 
are 
specified 
as 
𝑖𝑡= log(𝑅𝑡
𝑀𝑅𝑀
⁄
) = log((1 + 𝑖̃𝑡) (1 + 𝑖̃)
⁄
) = 𝑖̃𝑡−𝑖̃, 
𝜐𝐻,𝐹𝑖𝑡=
log(𝑅𝐻,𝐹,𝑡𝑅𝐻,𝐹
⁄
) = log((1 + 𝜐𝐻,𝐹𝑖̃𝑡) (1 + 𝜐𝐻,𝐹𝑖)
⁄
) = 𝜐𝐻,𝐹(𝑖̃𝑡−𝑖̃); the net foreign asset is denoted as 𝑎𝑡= 𝐴𝑡−
𝐴 and the shocks are described as 𝜀𝑥,𝑡= log (𝜀̃𝑥,𝑡𝜀̃𝑥
⁄
), 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡= 𝜀̃𝑟𝑝,𝑡−𝜀̃𝑟𝑝. 

60 
 
The CPI inflation depends on the inflation of domestically produced goods and the terms 
of trade weighted by the importance of imported goods in the CPI basket.     
The modified UIP condition:  
   𝑖𝑡−𝑖𝑡
∗= (1 −𝜙𝑒)𝐸𝑡Δ𝑒𝑡+1 −𝜙𝑒Δ𝑒𝑡−𝜙𝑎𝑎𝑡+ 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡    
               (2.A.8) 
where Δ𝑒𝑡= 𝜋𝑡−𝜋𝑡
∗+ ∆𝑞𝑡 is the nominal exchange rate.  
Net foreign assets: 
                 𝑎𝑡=
1
𝛽𝑎𝑡−1 −𝛼(𝑠𝑡+ 𝜓𝐹,𝑡) + 𝑦𝑡−𝑐𝑡                                            (2.A.9) 
Monetary policy rule:   
   𝑖𝑡= 𝜌𝑅𝑖𝑡−1 + (1 −𝜌𝑅)(𝜒𝜋𝜋𝑡+ 𝜒𝑦𝑦𝑡+ 𝜒∆𝑦∆𝑦𝑡) + 𝜀𝑅,𝑡                 (2.A.10) 
where 𝜀𝑅,𝑡 is a domestic monetary policy shock.  
2.A.2 Foreign (G7) economy  
 
When applying 𝛼∗= 0 condition and 𝑃𝑡
∗= 𝑃𝐹,𝑡
∗ assumptions into (2.A.1)-(2.A.10), 
equations describing the foreign economy can be described as follows:  
 
IS curve:         𝑦𝑡
∗−ℎ∗𝑦𝑡−1
∗
= 𝐸𝑡(𝑦𝑡+1
∗
−ℎ∗𝑦𝑡
∗) −𝜎∗−1(1 −ℎ∗)(𝑖𝑡

                        +𝜎∗−1(1 −ℎ∗)(𝜀𝑔,𝑡
∗−𝜀𝑔,𝑡+1
∗
)        
        
 
         (2.A.11) 
Phillips curve:  
         𝜋𝑡
∗−𝛿∗𝜋𝑡−1
∗
= 𝛽𝐸𝑡(𝜋𝑡+1

−𝛿∗𝜋𝑡
∗) + 𝑘∗(𝑚𝑐𝑡
∗+ 𝜀𝑐𝑝,𝑡

)                  (2.A.12) 
where 𝑘∗=
(1−𝜃∗)(1−𝜃∗𝛽∗)
𝜃∗
;  𝜀𝑐𝑝,𝑡
∗
 is a foreign price markup shock, and  
Real marginal cost:  
                       𝑚𝑐𝑡
∗= 𝜑∗𝑦𝑡
∗−(1 + 𝜑∗)𝜀𝑎,𝑡

Notes: The black line represents the statistics computed from the data; the dashed blue lines represent the 
full model’s posterior predictive median and interval between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the statistics; 
the solid red line represents the baseline model’s posterior predictive median of the statistics. Each statistic 
is calculated at horizons 𝑘= 0, … ,5 for autocorrelation and at horizons 𝑘= −5, … ,0, … ,5 for cross-
correlation. For 𝑘= 0, the medians and intervals of the statistics are approximated using the posterior 
predictive median and intervals of the covariance between variables, respectively.

   Notes: i) FR represents four G7 shocks, including preference, technology, price markup and monetary polish shocks; PR denotes the domestic consumption preference shock;  
           TE indicates the domestic technology shock; MP stands for the domestic monetary policy shock; ICP indicates the price markup shock in the import sector; DCP denotes the price markup shock in        
           the domestic producers.  
             ii) Variance shares are shown in [0,1] interval, hence 0.01 corresponds to 1 per cent.  
      iii) For FR shock, posterior mean and [5, 95] bands are computed by simple sum of the share of relevant shocks’ mean, lower and upper bands of 90 per cent interval.   
            iv) SV denotes Stationary Variance (or unconditional variance), which refers to the long-horizon variance.  
            
       v) Figures in brackets indicate 90 per cent posterior probability intervals.

Appendix 2.C Derivation of key equations  
2.C.1 The domestic household  
 
The households face two step optimization problems. In the first step, the household 
chooses the combination of domestic and foreign goods bundles that minimize costs for 
any given level of aggregate consumption49. The optimization gives the demand 
functions, shown in (2.4.1) and (2.4.2): 
𝐶𝐻,𝑡= (1 −𝛼) (
𝑃𝐻,𝑡
𝑃𝑡)
−𝜂
𝐶𝑡  and 𝐶𝐹,𝑡= 𝛼(
𝑃𝐹,𝑡
𝑃𝑡)
−𝜂
𝐶𝑡                                            (2.C.1) 
In the second step, the household chooses optimally how much to consume, work and 
invest by maximizing lifetime utility. The optimization problem is solved using stochastic 
Lagrangian multiplier approach. The Lagrangian function is:  
       ℒ𝑡= 𝐸𝑡∑
𝛽𝑡(𝜀̃𝑔,𝑡[
(𝐶𝑡−𝐻𝑡)1−𝜎
1−𝜎
−
𝑁𝑡
1+𝜑
1+𝜑] −Λ𝑡(𝑃𝑡𝐶𝑡+ 𝐷𝑡+ 𝑒̃𝑡𝐵𝑡−𝐷𝑡−1(1 + 𝑖̃𝑡−1) −
∞
𝑡=0
                  𝑒̃𝑡𝐵𝑡−1(1 + 𝑖̃𝑡−1
∗
)𝜙𝑡−𝑊𝑡𝑁𝑡−Π𝐻,𝑡−Π𝐹,𝑡−T𝑡))                                     (2.C.2) 
First order conditions are: 
     
𝜕ℒ𝑡
𝜕𝐶𝑡= 𝛽𝑡(𝜀̃𝑔,𝑡(𝐶𝑡−𝐻𝑡)−𝜎−Λ𝑡𝑃𝑡) = 0                                                                (2.C.3) 
𝜕ℒ𝑡
𝜕𝑁𝑡= 𝛽𝑡(−𝜀̃𝑔,𝑡𝑁𝑡
𝜑+ Λ𝑡𝑊𝑡) = 0                                                                           (2.C.4)     
𝜕ℒ𝑡
𝜕𝐷𝑡= −𝛽𝑡Λ𝑡+ 𝛽𝑡+1𝐸𝑡(Λ𝑡+1(1 + 𝑖̃𝑡)) = 0                                                          (2.C.5)     
     
𝜕ℒ𝑡
𝜕𝐵𝑡= −𝛽𝑡Λ𝑡𝑒̃ + 𝛽𝑡+1𝐸𝑡(Λ𝑡+1𝑒̃𝑡+1(1 + 𝑖̃𝑡
∗)𝜙𝑡+1) = 0                                          (2.C.6) 
 
Solving the system of (2.C.3) and (2.C.4) yields equation (2.6), and equation (2.C.5) is 
itself equation (2.7) and substituting (2.C.5) into (2.C.6) returns equation (2.8).  
2.C.2 Pricing decision of domestic firms  
A firm, re-setting its price in period 𝑡 as 𝑃′𝐻,𝑡, maximizes the present value of profits by 
taking into account the probability of not being able to re-set prices in the future. The 
optimization problem can be solved using the Lagrangian multiplier approach as follows:

(2.C.11) is the equation (2.14), combined condition of the first order conditions. The 
derivation of optimal price setting condition for the retail firm (2.18) is analogous to the 
case of the domestic firm, which has been conducted above. 
    
2.C.3 Log-linear approximation to equilibrium conditions50  
Euler equation: A log-linear approximation to Euler equation (2.7) gives  
  𝜀̃𝑔(𝐶−ℎ𝐶)−𝜎𝑃−1 (1 + 𝜀𝑔,𝑡−
𝜎
1−ℎ(𝑐𝑡−ℎ𝑐𝑡−1)) = 𝛽𝐸𝑡[𝜀̃𝑔(𝐶−ℎ𝐶)−𝜎(1 +

𝜎
1−ℎ(𝑐𝑡+1 −ℎ𝑐𝑡) + 𝑖𝑡−𝜋𝑡+1)]           (2.C.12) 
Combining (2.C.12) with the steady state relation, 𝜀̃𝑔(𝐶−ℎ𝐶)−𝜎𝑃−1 = 𝛽𝐸𝑡[𝜀̃𝑔(𝐶−
ℎ𝐶)−𝜎(1 + 𝑖̃)𝑃−1], the linearized Euler equation (2.A.1) can be found as 
                    𝑐𝑡−ℎ𝑐𝑡−1 = 𝐸𝑡(𝑐𝑡+1 −ℎ𝑐𝑡) −𝜎−1(1 −ℎ)(𝑖𝑡−𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1) 
                                                          +𝜎−1(1 −ℎ)(𝜀𝑔,𝑡− 𝐸𝑡𝜀𝑔,𝑡+1)                           (2.C.13) 
The law of one price gap, real exchange rate and inflation relations: A log-linear 
approximation to the CPI equation (2.5) around a zero inflation steady state in which 𝑃=
𝑃𝐻= 𝑃𝐹 yields  
𝑝𝑡= (1 −𝛼)𝑝𝐻,𝑡+ 𝛼𝑝𝐹,𝑡= 𝑝𝐹,𝑡−(1 −𝛼)𝑠𝑡                                   (2.C.14) 
where 𝑠𝑡= 𝑝𝐹,𝑡−𝑝𝐻,𝑡. A log-linearization of the law of one price gap is given by  
  𝜓𝐹,𝑡= 𝑒𝑡+ 𝑝𝑡
∗−𝑝𝐹,𝑡                                                                           (2.C.15) 
 Using (2.C.14) and (2.C.15), the real exchange rate can be obtained as  
𝑞𝑡= 𝑒𝑡+ 𝑝𝑡
∗−𝑝𝑡= 𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ 𝑝𝐹,𝑡−𝑝𝑡= 𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ (1 −𝛼)𝑠𝑡                (2.C.16) 
From (2.C.14), the CPI inflation is found as  
𝜋𝑡= 𝜋𝐻,𝑡+ 𝛼Δ𝑠𝑡                                                                                (2.C.17) 
where Δ𝑠𝑡= 𝜋𝐹,𝑡−𝜋𝐻,𝑡.  
 
Resource constraint: In contrast to the domestic economy, it is assumed that the law of 
one price holds for imports of domestic goods to the foreign economy, for instance, 
𝑃𝐻,𝑡= 𝑒̃𝑡𝑃𝐻,𝑡
∗. Using (2.4.1), (2.22) and (2.23) equations and the notation of 𝑌𝑡= 𝑌𝐻,𝑡, the 
resource constraint (𝑌𝐻,𝑡= 𝐶𝐻,𝑡+ 𝐶𝐻,𝑡
∗) can be written as  
                                                           
50 The log-linear approximation is used to transform the equilibrium conditions into a linear form. The log-
linearization transforms the domain with a log function, and then approximates with a linear function. By 
definition of the log-linearization, if ℝ→ℝ is differentiable, and 𝑥∗ is some point in ℝ, then the log-
linearization 𝑓̂ of 𝑓 around 𝑥∗ is 𝑓̂(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑋∗) + 𝑋∗𝑓′(𝑋∗)𝑥, where 𝑥= log𝑋−log𝑋∗.

∗                          (2.C.18) 
A log-linear approximation to the above equation around the zero inflation steady state 
in which 𝑃= 𝑃𝐻= 𝑃𝐹 yields  
            Y(𝑦𝑡+ 1) = 𝐶𝐻(1 −𝜂(𝑝𝐻,𝑡−𝑝𝑡) + 𝑐𝑡) + 𝐶𝐻
∗(1 + 𝜂∗(𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ 𝑠𝑡) + 𝑦𝑡
∗)       
where 𝐶𝐻 and 𝐶𝐻
∗ are steady state values of 𝐶𝐻,𝑡 and 𝐶𝐻,𝑡
∗, respectively and 𝐶𝐻=
(1 −𝛼)𝐶, 𝐶𝐻
∗= 𝜍𝑌∗. Since the resource constraint in the steady state is 𝑌= 𝐶𝐻+ 𝐶𝐻
∗, 
above equation can be rewritten as  
           Y𝑦𝑡= 𝐶𝐻(𝜂(𝑝𝑡−𝑝𝐻,𝑡) + 𝑐𝑡) + 𝐶𝐻
∗(𝜂∗(𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ 𝑠𝑡) + 𝑦𝑡
∗).                        
From the steady state version of equations (2.4.1) and (2.4.2), it is found that 𝐶𝐻=
(1 −𝛼)𝐶 and 𝐶𝐹= 𝛼𝐶, where 𝐶𝐹 is the steady state level of imports. Assuming balanced 
trade, export of domestic economy (𝐶𝐻
∗) is equal to its import (𝐶𝐹) in the steady state, 
𝐶𝐻
∗= 𝐶𝐹= 𝛼𝐶. Inserting this into the resource constraint yields Y = 𝐶𝐻+ 𝐶𝐻
∗=
(1 −𝛼)𝐶+ 𝛼𝐶= 𝐶. Thus using the resource constraint and (2.C.14) equation, linearized 
the resource constraint can be obtained as  
𝑦𝑡= (1 −𝛼)𝑐𝑡+ 𝛼((1 −𝛼)𝜂+ 𝜂∗)𝑠𝑡+ 𝛼𝜂∗𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ 𝛼𝑦𝑡
∗                         (2.C.19) 
If the condition 𝜂= 𝜂∗is assumed, then (2.C.19) is same as equation (2.A.2).   
Optimal price setting for domestic firms: Log-linear approximations to (2.12) and (2.14) 
equations yield a hybrid Phillips curve. Log-linearization of the domestic price index 
(2.12) around the zero steady state (𝑃= 𝑃𝐻= 𝑃𝐻
′ ) is

At the zero inflation steady state (𝑃= 𝑃𝐻= 𝑃𝐻
′ ), equation (2.13) and equation (2.14) 
provide 𝑌= 𝑌𝐻=𝐶𝐻+ 𝐶𝐻
∗  and 𝑀𝐶= (𝜀−1) 𝜀

stochastic discount factor is 𝑄𝑡,𝑡+𝜏= 𝛽𝜏51. Therefore, a log-linear approximation to

51 According to financial economics, under the assumption that households have access to a complete set

budget constraint, where 𝜇𝑡 is the Lagrange multiplier attached to time 𝑡 state 𝑠𝑡 budget constraint and 𝜌𝑡 
is the probability of observing history 𝑠𝑡. Hence, at the steady state, the stochastic discount factor is

Combining (2.C.21) with (2.C.25) gives the hybrid Phillips curve (2.15) as

News shocks and unemployment in an 
estimated small open economy DSGE 
model 
 
 
 
 
Abstract 
 
This chapter examines the importance of news shocks in a small open economy 
DSGE model for analysing business cycle properties of macroeconomic 
aggregates, including labour market variables. In doing so, the chapter augments 
a standard small open economy DSGE model (e.g., Justiniano and Preston 2010a) 
to include the theory of involuntary unemployment proposed by Galí 2011(a) and 
endogenous preference shifter used by Galí et al. (2011). The model is also driven 
by both unanticipated and news shocks, and estimated using Bayesian methods 
with data for Australia and the US. The results show that the estimated model is 
able to qualitatively replicate the existing results of the VAR analyses on news-
driven business cycles, and news shocks have been the main drivers of the 
Australian business cycle in the inflation-targeting period.

3.1 Introduction  
The literature on business cycles emphasizes the importance of news shocks55 in driving 
macroeconomic fluctuations. The news view of business cycles can be traced back to the 
early literature on macroeconomics (e.g., Pigou 1927 and Keynes 1936). According to 
the news-driven business cycle, macroeconomic fluctuations can be driven by optimistic 
expectations about a future economic activity that are not realized. In particular, news 
shocks change agents’ expectations, influencing their current decisions on consumption, 
investment and labour supply, and hence lead to business cycles (Jaimovich and Rebelo 
2009). For example, favourable news about future productivity (or demand) can set off a 
boom today as a result of the similar behaviour of many agents with optimistic 
expectations (e.g., increasing current consumption and investment). However, a 
realization of productivity (or demand) which is worse than anticipated can induce a bust 
without any actual changes in economic fundamentals (Barsky and Sims 2011, and 
Beaudry and Portier 2013). For the literature on business cycle, Coachrane (1994) has 
revived the news view of business cycle by addressing the necessity of models that 
explain business cycle fluctuations with news shocks. The news-driven business cycle 
has been empirically studied using two alternative approaches. First, Beaudry and Portier 
(2006), Beaudry et al. (2011), Barsky and Sims (2011) and Forni et al. (2011) have 
developed a reduced-form approach by proposing vector autoregression (VAR) 
methodologies to assess the role of news shocks in driving business cycle fluctuations. 
Second, a number of papers (e.g., Davis 2007, Jaimovich and Rebelo 2008, 2009, 
Christiano et al. 2008, 2010a, Fujiwara et al. 2011, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 2012, Milani 
and Treadwell 2012, Khan and Tsoukalas 2012) employ a structural approach based on a 
fully specified DSGE model to evaluate the prominence of news shocks in explaining 
business cycle fluctuations.  
More recently, the literature on the news-driven business cycle has focused on the role of 
news shocks in driving national and international business cycle fluctuations using DSGE 
models with some extensions, such as nominal and real rigidities, financial frictions, 
housing and asset markets (e.g., Krusell and McKay 2010, Lorenzoni 2011 and Beaundry 
and Portier 2013 for a recent survey). Though recent papers have considered extensions 
to an international setting, the papers on the international business cycle have focused 
                                                           
55 In this chapter, the word ‘news’ refers to exogenous changes in the information sets that agents use to 
form their perceptions about future realization of economic fundamentals. 

75 
 
exclusively on the effects of news shocks about technology using calibrated two-country 
DSGE models (e.g., Jaimovich and Rebelo 2008, Matsumoto et al. 2008, Den Haan and 
Lozej 2011, Beaudry et al. 2011 and Kosaka 2013). Moreover, a very limited number of 
papers (e.g., Den Haan and Kaltenbrunner 2009, Theodoridis and Zanetti 2014) have 
examined the effect of news shocks on labour market variables. On the news horizon, the 
previous papers (e.g., Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 2012, Khan and Tsoukalas 2012 and 
Gomes et al. 2013), simultaneously allowing several types of news shocks, have selected 
the same news horizon(s) for each type of structural shocks.    
The existing literature raises some interesting questions: (i) does the presence of news 
shocks (i.e., several types of shocks announced in different horizons) improve the overall 
fit of an estimated small open economy DSGE model? (ii) do news shocks drive domestic 
and international business cycles? and (iii) how important are news shocks as sources of 
labour market and macroeconomic fluctuations? By addressing these questions, this 
chapter contributes to the growing literature on the news-driven business cycle in distinct 
ways. First, the chapter assesses the importance of news shocks in analysing business 
cycle properties of macroeconomic aggregates, including labour market variables, using 
an estimated New Keynesian DSGE model in a two-country setting (i.e., Australia and 
the US). Second, the chapter allows different news horizon(s) for each structural shock 
based on the best-fitting news horizon approach proposed by Fujiwara et al. (2011). 
Finally, it is one of the first attempts to study the effect of news shocks on real exchange 
rate dynamics and to examine the role of news about future country risk premium in 
explaining business cycle fluctuations. 
To address these questions, the model developed in the chapter 2 is further augmented in 
three dimensions. First, following a series of papers (Galí 2011a,b and Galí et al. 2011), 
involuntary unemployment is introduced in the model56. In recent years, a number of 
papers (e.g., Gertler et al. 2008, Christoffel et al. 2009, Casares 2010, Christiano et al. 
2010b, 2011 2013, Blanchard and Galí 2010, Galí 2011 a,b,c, and Galí et al. 2011) have 
focused on incorporating unemployment into New Keynesian DSGE models. In most of 
the papers, unemployment is introduced based on the labour market search and matching 
framework of Mortensen and Pissaridis (1994). However, this chapter relies on the theory 
                                                           
56 Unemployment is a central focus of policy debate and a key macro indicator. However, as highlighted 
by Galí and Gertler (2007), New Keynesian DSGE models have neglected the problem of unemployment 
for long time. 

76 
 
of involuntary unemployment proposed by Galí (2011a, b)57, which is an alternative to 
the search and skills mismatch model of the labour market. Though Galí’s approach 
assumes no structural unemployment in the model, it helps to overcome the problem of 
incomplete identification between labour supply and wage markup shocks, pointed out 
by Chari et al. (2009), through including the unemployment rate as an observable variable 
in the empirical analysis. Differentiating the wage markup shock from the labour supply 
shock is important because these two sources of fluctuations have very different policy 
implications. The Galí’s approach to introduce unemployment is more appropriate for 
economies where labour unions are influential in setting the wage rate since the modelling 
approach assumes that higher union power produces higher unemployment rates. Though 
Christiano (2011) depicts some drawbacks to the approach, a couple of papers (e.g., Galí 
et al. 2011 and Grabek and Kłos 2013) have shown that the estimated model embedding 
Galí’s (2011a,b) approach offers a better understanding of labour market fluctuations.  
Second, an endogenous preference shifter presented by Galí et al. (2011) is included in 
the model to mitigate the strong wealth effects of shocks on the labour supply. Beaudry 
and Portier (2006) provide the VAR-based evidence supporting the ‘Pigou cycle’ in 
which major macroeconomic aggregates (e.g., output, consumption, investment and 
employment) move up and down together in response to news shocks. Standard real 
business cycle (RBC) models fail to generate the business cycle co-movements in 
response to good news about future productivity (e.g., Coachrane 1994, Danthine et al. 
1998, Beudry and Portier 2007, Jaimovich and Rebelo 2008 and Christiano et al. 2008). 
In both closed and open economy RBC models, this failure is mainly attributed to the 
strong wealth effect of news on the labour supply58. To prevent the counterfactual 
response of labour supply, Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008, 2009) originally propose a 
hybrid utility function with preference shifter, featuring a weak wealth effect on labour 
supply, which allows their RBC models to generate the aggregate co-movement in 
response to both unanticipated and news shocks. Moreover, based on their findings, 
Christiano et al. (2010b) suggest that the household utility function must be modified in 
ways that dampen wealth effects on labour supply when the theory of involuntary 
unemployment proposed by Galí (2011a) is integrated into the New Keynesian DSGE 
                                                           
57 In Galí’s approach, unemployment is an equilibrium phenomenon and a consequence of worker’s market 
power (i.e. wage markup), resulting from imperfect substitution between different types of labour. 
Therefore, unemployment fluctuations are due to the slow adjustment of wages and shocks to wage markup. 
58 In standard RBC models, good news about future productivity makes agents wealthier, and hence agents 
increase their consumption and reduce their labour supply. This decline in labour supply may lead to fall 
in output. As a result, good news about tomorrow can cause a recession today (Jaimovich and Rebelo 2009).  

77 
 
model59. Galí et al. (2011), using related but not identical reference the specifications to 
Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008, 2009), have shown that the presence of an endogenous 
preference shifter improves the performance of their New Keynesian DSGE model in 
matching with the VAR-based results on responses of labour market variables to an 
unanticipated monetary policy shock.  
Third, each of structural shocks in the model is allowed to feature both news and 
unanticipated components. In the model, business cycles in a small open economy are 
driven by thirteen structural shocks, namely three demand shocks (preference, risk 
premium and monetary policy shocks), two supply shocks (technology and price markup 
shocks), two labour market shocks (labour supply and wage makup shocks) and six 
foreign shocks (the US preference, monetary policy, technology, price markup, labour 
supply and wage makup shocks). Following results of the VAR analyses60, most of the 
previous studies based on RBC and DSGE models (e.g., Jaimovich and Rebelo 2008, 
2009, Christiano et al. 2008, 2010a and Fujiwara et al. 2011) have focused exclusively 
on news shock about technology. However, various studies have moved away from news 
about only technology and allow for incorporating various news shocks into the model. 
For instance, a number of papers (e.g., Milani and Treadwell 2012 and Gomes et al. 2013) 
consider news shocks on monetary policy, and find that the news shock improves the 
model fit and plays a larger role in business cycle fluctuations relative to unanticipated 
policy shocks. Recent papers (e.g., Badarinza and Margaritov 2011, Khan and Tsoukalas 
2012, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 2012) have examined the role of news about several 
supply, demand and labour markets shocks in explaining business cycle fluctuations. 
Though news about future country risk premium has not been considered in the literature, 
existing papers (e.g., Nimark 2009, Liu 2010 and Leu 2010) find that the unanticipated 
risk premium shock is an important source of business cycle fluctuations in a small open 
economy (i.e., Australia).   
                                                           
59 Recent studies (e.g., Christiano et al. 2010b and Christiano 2011) have argued that with the standard 
preference (e.g., used by Smets and Wouters 2007), wealth effects on labour supply are excessively strong, 
leading to counterfactual implications for unemployment and labour force in response to unanticipated 
monetary policy and technology shocks. 
60 The VAR-based results (e.g., Beaudary and Porter 2006 and Beaudry and Lucke 2010) have shown that 
news about future technology lead to positive co-movement among macroeconomic aggregates on impact, 
and explain a substantial portion of the variances in aggregate variables at business cycle frequencies. The 
original studies in the literature mainly focus on features that help the model to replicate the VAR-based 
results. 

78 
 
The model is estimated using Bayesian methods with data for Australia and the US over 
the period 1993:Q1-2013:Q4, covering the inflation-targeting period in Australia and the 
recent global financial crisis (GFC). The result reveals the importance of news shocks in 
driving the Australian business cycle over the inflation-targeting period. News shocks 
account for exceeding half of the variances in Australian output, employment and interest 
rate. Moreover, the estimated model is able to qualitatively replicate the existing results 
of the VAR analyses on news-driven business cycles in small open economies (e.g., 
Kosaka 2013 and Kamber et al. 2014). For instance, news about future technology, 
country risk premium and preference in Australia can lead to domestic business cycle 
fluctuations, whereas the US news shocks on technology and preference do propagate to 
Australia, generating international business cycles. As found by Theodoridis and Zanetti 
(2014), a positive technology news shock leads to a counter-cyclical unemployment rate 
and a rise in wages, and news shocks account for exceeding one-third of variance in 
unemployment rate in both countries. In addition, the real exchange rate dynamics play 
an important role in the transmission of news shocks in the sense that one-third of 
variance in the real exchange rate is attributable to news shocks.  
The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 3.2 describes the model, 
and explains how to introduce news shocks into the model. Section 3.3 presents the model 
solution and estimation, consisting of the data and priors for parameters of the model. 
Section 3.4 contains the discussion on the importance of news shocks as sources of 
business cycle fluctuations in the US and Australia. Finally, section 3.5 concludes the 
chapter with a review of results and provides directions for future research.  
3.2 The model  
3.2.1 The basic structure of the model 
The basic structure of the model is built on the model built in Chapter 2 that is in turn 
based on the J-P model61. The basic structure slightly deviates from the J-P model in the 
sense that it also includes the cost channel of monetary policy and the uncovered interest 
                                                           
61 The J-P model is based on Monacelli (2005) and Galí and Monacelli (2005), and allows for incomplete 
asset markets, habit formation and indexation of prices to past inflation. The J-P model assumes (i) fully 
flexible wages and perfect competition in labour markets, (ii) a standard household utility function, a 
preference of the class discussed by King et al. (1988), and (iii) shocks are unanticipated by agents until 
they are realized and, hence, observed. Justiniano and Preston (2010b) incorporate staggered wage setting 
following Erceg et al. (2000) into the J-P model, however they do not consider unemployment and labour 
force. 

79 
 
rate parity (UIP) modification. For instance, as suggested by Adolfson et al. (2008) and 
Adolfson et al. (2013), the UIP condition is modified by allowing for a negative 
correlation between the country risk premium and the expected depreciation in the 
nominal exchange rate. As discussed by Christiano et al. (2011), the cost channel of 
monetary policy is incorporated by assuming that producer firms borrow from the 
financial institutions to pay for inputs (i.e., wage bills), whereas the retail firms borrow 
their imported goods from foreign sellers at the foreign currency interest rate. As a result, 
CPI inflation depends on domestic and the foreign interest rates. Moreover, in the model, 
the foreign economy is specified as the closed economy version of the open economy 
model following Monacelli (2005) and Justiniano and Preston (2010b).  
The model is augmented to introduce an endogenous preference shifter, some 
imperfections in the labour market and news shocks.  
3.2.2 Introducing reference shifter and involuntary unemployment  
Following Galí (2011a)62 and Galí et al. (2011), this section introduces (i) an endogenous 
reference shifter and a variant of the staggered wage setting, originally developed by 
Erceg et al. (2000), and (ii) involuntary unemployment into the model. The utility 
function with preference shifter employed by Galí et al. (2011) does not change the main 
features of the model, and the preference allows us to parameterize the strength of short-
run wealth effects on labour supply. The Galí’s approach on introducing involuntary 
unemployment into New Keynesian DSGE model allows us to examine the effects of 
shocks on labour market fluctuations. The approach assumes that labour is indivisible, 
with all variations in hired labour input taking place at the extensive margin63. The 
assumption leads to a notion of unemployment consistent with its formal definition. In 
what follows, new features introduced in the model are explained in a detail. A derivation 
of the optimization problem for workers unions and log-linear approximations of main 
equations are shown in Appendix 3.C. 
                                                           
62 The paper provides a re-interpretation of the New Keynesian model in which variations in the number of 
hours worked by the representative household are interpreted as variations in the number of people working.  
63 The overall level of work can be decomposed into the number of individuals in work and the intensity of 
work supplied by those in work. This reflects the distinction between whether to work and how much to 
work at the individual level and is referred to, respectively, as the extensive and intensive margin of labour 
supply (Blundell et al. 2011).  

80 
 
3.2.2.1 Staggered wage setting and endogenous reference shifter  
3.2.2.1.1 Household’s utility function with reference shifter  
The Galí’s approach considers a representative household, having a large number of 
members, with a continuum of members represented by the unit square and indexed by a 
pair (𝑘, 𝑗) ∈[0,1] × [0,1], where 𝑘 indicates the specific labour service (specialization) 
of a member and 𝑗 determines a member’s disutility from work. The disutility is given by 
𝜀̃𝑛,𝑡𝑗𝜑 if the member is employed and zero otherwise, where the stochastic term 𝜀̃𝑛,𝑡> 0 
denotes a labour supply shock, and 𝜑≥0  denotes the elasticity of marginal disutility of 
work (1 𝜑
⁄  is sometimes called Frisch elasticity of labour). In addition, as discussed by 
Merz (1995), full risk sharing of consumption among household members is assumed, 
implying 𝐶𝑡(𝑘, 𝑗) = 𝐶𝑡 for all (𝑘, 𝑗) ∈[0,1] × [0,1] and 𝑡. This assumption implies that 
members (i.e., workers) of the household enjoy perfect consumption insurance. 
Employed workers send their wages directly to the household in exchange for 
consumption insurance. The representative household’s utility function with endogenous 
preference shifter Θ𝑡 (as the integral over its members’ utilities) is given by64

where 𝐶𝑡 indicates household consumption; 𝐻𝑡≡ℎ𝐶𝑡−1, with ℎ∈[0,1] implies external 
habit formation term taken as exogenously by the household; 𝑁𝑡(𝑘) ∈[0,1] denotes the 
fraction of members specialized in type 𝑘 labour who are employed in period 𝑡; 𝜎 
indicates the elasticity of intertemporal substitution; and 𝜀̃𝑔,𝑡 and 𝜀̃𝑛,𝑡 denote preference 
and labour supply shocks, respectively. As suggested by Galí et al. (2011), the 
endogenous preference shifter (Θ𝑡) is defined as follows: 
                                         Θ𝑡≡𝑍𝑡𝑈𝑐,𝑡, 𝑍𝑡= 𝑍𝑡−1

−𝜗𝑧  
where 𝑈𝑐,𝑡= 𝜀̃𝑔,𝑡(𝐶𝑡−ℎ𝐶𝑡−1)−𝜎 denotes the marginal utility of consumption. The 
reference specification indicates a ‘consumption externality’ on individual labour supply 
in the sense that during an aggregate consumption boom (i.e., 𝜀̃𝑔,𝑡(𝐶𝑡−ℎ𝐶𝑡−1)𝜎> 𝑍𝑡),

individual (as well as household level) marginal disutility from work goes down at any 
given level of employment. The importance of the shifter in generating the empirical 
response of labour supply to exogenous shocks depends on the size of parameter, 𝜗𝑧∈
(0,1]. When 𝜗𝑧= 1, the obtained preference is attributed to the class discussed by King 
et al. (1988), featuring strong short-run wealth effects on labour supply. When 𝜗𝑧⟶0, 
the preference will be closer to that discussed by Greenwood et al. (1988), which features 
no short-run wealth effects on labour supply.  
Under the preference, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between consumption and

and 𝜁𝜔,𝑡 is the period 𝑡 wage elasticity of the relevant labour demand, which varies 
exogenously over time, hence leading to changes in the worker’s market power (i.e., the 
desired wage markup). Using the wage elasticity notation used by Smets and Wouters 
(2003), it can be written as 𝜁𝜔,𝑡=
1+𝜆𝜔,𝑡
𝜆𝜔,𝑡, where 𝜆𝜔,𝑡= 𝜆𝜔+ 𝜀𝜔,𝑡=
1
𝜁𝜔−1 + 𝜀𝜔,𝑡. Here 
𝜆𝜔,𝑡 is a stochastic parameter that determines the time-varying markup in labour market, 
𝜁𝜔 is non-stochastic component of wage elasticity, and shocks to this parameter will be 
interpreted  as a wage markup shock, 𝜀𝜔,𝑡, to the wage inflation equation.  
3.2.2.1.3 Staggered wage setting  
Workers’ unions, setting nominal wages, act in an uncoordinated way, and each union 
represents workers who specialize in a given type of labour. As discussed by Erceg et al. 
(2000), Calvo (1983) framework is also considered in the wage setting. Since the labour 
is heterogeneous (i.e., imperfect substitutes), unions representing each type of labour have 
monopolistic power to set nominal wages for the given type of labour. The unions face 
Calvo-style wage setting, having the opportunity to re-optimize their wages with 
probability, 1 −𝜃𝜔, each period, where 0 < 𝜃𝜔< 1. The unions, not re-optimizing, 
adjust their wages according to the indexation rule given by 
                          𝑊𝑡(𝑘) = 𝑊𝑡−1(𝑘) (
𝑃𝑡−1
𝑃𝑡−2)
𝛿𝜔  
where 0 ≤𝛿𝜔≤1 indicates the degree of indexation to the previous period’s inflation 
rate. The model only considers a symmetric equilibrium in which all unions behave 
identically, and hence the index 𝑘 is omitted in what follows. All unions, re-optimizing 
their wage, choose an identical wage, 𝑊′𝑡, since they face the same problem. Under the 
Calvo-style wage setting assumptions, the aggregate wage index in equation (3.5) can be 
rewritten as  
 𝑊𝑡= [(1 −𝜃𝜔)𝑊′𝑡
1−𝜁𝜔,𝑡+ 𝜃𝜔(𝑊𝑡−1 (

          (3.6)

When nominal wages are set, the firms determine their demand for the given type of 
labour, and households send their members with the lowest work disutility. Regarding 
equation (3.4), the labour demand in period 𝑡+ 𝜏 for workers whose wage was last re-
optimized in period 𝑡 by 𝑊′𝑡 is as follows: 
𝑁𝑡+𝜏|𝑡= (
𝑊′𝑡

where 𝑁𝑡+𝜏≡∫𝑁𝑡+𝜏(𝑖)𝑑𝑖

 denotes aggregate employment in period 𝑡+ 𝜏. Similar to 
Woodford (2003), it is assumed that the unions, resetting the optimal wage in period t, 
maximize their perspective households’ utility generated from the wage income after 
taking into account the disutility of labour and the probability of not being able to re-set 
wages in the future periods 𝑡+ 𝜏. Thus the unions choose 𝑊′𝑡 by maximizing the utility

Log-linearizing (3.6) and (3.9) equations around a zero inflation steady state and 
combining the resulting expressions give the following equation for wage inflation,

65 Erceg et al. (2000) and Galí (2008, 2011a) employ slightly different optimization setting for the optimal 
wage. However, their combined first-order condition associated with the wage-setting is exactly same with 
the condition found from the presented setting.

3.2.2.2 Introducing involuntary unemployment  
Following the theory of involuntary unemployment proposed by Galí (2011a), 
unemployment, employment and labour force are explicitly introduced into the model. 
As discussed in section 3.2.2.1.1, the household member (𝑘, 𝑗) has disutility of work, 
𝜀̃𝑛,𝑡Θ𝑡𝑗𝜑. Based on household welfare as a criterion, and taking as given labour market 
conditions, a member will work in period 𝑡 if and only if the following condition is 
satisfied: 
                             Λ𝑡𝑊𝑡(𝑘) = 𝑈𝑐,𝑡(𝑊𝑡(𝑘)
𝑃𝑡) ≥𝜀̃𝑛,𝑡Θ𝑡𝑗𝜑 
From the above condition at the symmetric equilibrium and equation (3.1), the marginal 
supplier of type 𝑘 labour (both employed and unemployed), denoted by 𝐿𝑡(𝑘), can be 
determined as67  
𝑊𝑡(𝑘)
𝑃𝑡
= 𝜀̃𝑛,𝑡𝑍𝑡𝐿𝑡(𝑘)𝜑                                                                       (3.12) 
Log-linear approximation to equation (3.12) and integrating over 𝑘 results in the labour 
supply equation  
𝑤𝑡−𝑝𝑡= 𝑧𝑡+ 𝜑𝑙𝑡+ 𝜀𝑛,𝑡                                                               (3.13) 
where 𝑙𝑡≡∫𝑙𝑡(𝑘)𝑑𝑘

 can be interpreted as labour force, 𝑤𝑡≡∫𝑤𝑡(𝑘)𝑑𝑘

 is a log-

(1 −𝜗𝑧) 𝑧𝑡−1 + 𝜗𝑧(𝜀𝑔,𝑡+ (𝜎(1 −ℎ)
⁄
)(𝑐𝑡−ℎ𝑐𝑡−1)). 
If 
the 
preference 
shifter 
parameter takes the value closer to zero (𝜗𝑧⟶0), then changes in consumption (or 
welfare) will have a weak effect on the labour supply. Therefore, the model is able to 
generate the co-movement between employment, labour supply and output.  
                                                           
67 Under the symmetric equilibrium, the condition can be derived from the following optimization: 
members who supply 𝑘 type of labour, taking their wage as given, set labour supply, 𝐿𝑡(𝑘), by maximizing 
household’s utility,

As assumed by Casares (2010), unemployment is described as an excess supply of labour, 
thus the unemployment rate is defined as  
𝑢𝑡≡𝑙𝑡−𝑛𝑡                                                                                      (3.14) 
Equation (3.14) is an approximation to the conventional measure of unemployment rate, 
(𝐿𝑡−𝑁𝑡) 𝐿𝑡
⁄
, where 𝐿𝑡 and 𝑁𝑡 respectively denote the labour force and the number of 
workers who are employed.  
Combining equation (3.14) with equations (3.13), (3.11) and (3.2), the relationship 
between the average markup and the unemployment rate can be found as follows: 
𝑢𝑡=
𝜇𝜔,𝑡
𝜑                                                                                          (3.15) 
From equation (3.15), it is clear that unemployment is a consequence of a worker’s 
market power (which is implied by a positive difference between the real average wage 
and its perfectly competitive level), and unemployment rate fluctuations emerge from the 
slow adjustment of wages. For example, positive unemployment implies that the union 
exploits its power to increase the wage rate, and the rise in wage leads to the fall in the 
number of employed workers. A graphical illustration of the relation (3.15) is shown by 
Galí (2011a) and its economic intuition is provided by Galí (2013).  
From equations (3.10) and (3.15), the original wage Phillips curve equation can be 
derived as 
𝜋𝑡
𝜔−𝛿𝜔𝜋𝑡−1
𝑝
= 𝛽𝐸𝑡(𝜋𝑡+1
𝜔
−𝛿𝜔𝜋𝑡
𝑝) + 𝜚𝜔𝜑𝑢𝑡+ 𝜐𝑡                      (3.16) 
where 𝜐𝑡≡𝜚𝜔𝜇𝜔,𝑡
𝑛. Note that in contrast to the specification of the wage inflation 
equation (3.10)68 and other related papers (e.g., Justiniano and Preston 2006, Smet and 
Wouters 2007), the error term, 𝜐𝑡, in equation (3.16) captures exclusively shocks to the 
wage markup. Therefore, the wage Phillips curve, found by reformulating the wage 
equation in terms of observable unemployment rate, allows the model to overcome the 
identification problem pointed out by Chari at el. (2009).  
3.2.3 The log-linearized model 
The log-linearized equations of the estimated model are shown in Appendix 3.A. The 
remaining equations, not discussed in section 3.2.2, are similar to those shown in the J-P 
model. The domestic block is described by seventeen equations in the unknowns 
                                                           
68 The error term in equation (10) is given by 𝜐′𝑡≡𝜆𝜔(𝜇𝜔,𝑡
𝑛
+ 𝜀𝑛,𝑡) which is influenced by both wage 
markup shocks and labour supply shocks. Thus the model with equation (10) is critiqued by Chari at el. 
(2009) due to the identification problem between labour supply and wage markup shocks.

3.2.4 Introducing news shocks  
3.2.4.1 Expectations with news  
Introducing news changes the information structure in the model. Agents can now receive 
news in period 𝑡 about future shocks that may materialize only in ℎ periods ahead. Though 
agents still form rational expectations, their information set is enlarged to include news 
about future shocks in fundamentals. News shocks are introduced into the model as 
discussed in previous studies (e.g., Davis 2007, Fujiwara et al. 2011 and Schmitt-Grohé 
and Uribe 2012). To formulate the information structure, each of the fourteen innovations, 
𝜖𝑥,𝑡, include both unanticipated component, 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,0, and news component, 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠. To allow 
for the variation in the timing of the arrival of the news, 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠 can be further 
decomposed in to a summation of news shocks. Therefore 𝜖𝑥,𝑡 can be rewritten as 
                            𝜖𝑥,𝑡= 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,0 + 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠= 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,0 + ∑

𝑥,ℎ

ℎ=1
 
where 𝐻 denotes the longest horizon over that news shocks are anticipated by agents, and 
𝜖𝑡−ℎ
𝑥,ℎ denotes news about future changes in 𝑥 fundamentals, known to agents at period 
𝑡−ℎ, however, may materialize only ℎ periods ahead, 0 < ℎ≤𝐻. Hence, 𝜖𝑡−ℎ
𝑥,ℎ is also 
referred as ℎ-period ahead news shock in 𝑥 fundamental. For identification purposes, 
𝜖𝑡−ℎ
𝑥,ℎ~𝑖. 𝑖. 𝑑.   𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑥,ℎ
2 ),  for ℎ= 0,1, … , 𝐻 is assumed. This assumption implies that 
𝜖𝑡−ℎ
𝑥,ℎ is uncorrelated across time (i.e., zero correlation between contemporaneous and 
                                                           
69 All 𝜀̃𝑥 shocks, except 𝜀̃𝑟𝑝 have unit means, while all 𝜀𝑥 disturbances have zero means.  

87 
 
news shocks) and across anticipated horizons (i.e., zero cross-correlation among news 
shocks of different horizons). Thus the mean and variance of the error term, 𝜖𝑥,𝑡, is found 
to be 𝐸(𝜖𝑥,𝑡)=0 and 𝜎𝑥
2 = ∑
𝜎𝑥,ℎ
2
𝐻
ℎ=0
, respectively. As an example, let us consider the 
simple case of 𝐻= 3. Then the law of motion of 𝜀𝑥,𝑡 in equation (3.17) can be written as  
 
   𝜀𝑥,𝑡= 𝜌𝑥𝜀𝑥,𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,0 + 𝜖𝑡−1
𝑥,1 + 𝜖𝑡−2
𝑥,2 + 𝜖𝑡−3
𝑥,3                                 (3.18) 
In this case, agents have a larger information set than information containing current and 
past realization of 𝜖𝑥,𝑡. For instance, agents now observe current and past values of 
innovations 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,0, 𝜖𝑡−1
𝑥,1 , 𝜖𝑡−2
𝑥,2  and 𝜖𝑡−3
𝑥,3   in period 𝑡. Moreover, news shocks have an impact 
on agents’ expectations about the future.  
Since agents are forward-looking, they use the information contained in the realizations 
of the various news shocks, 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,ℎ, in their current decisions about consumption, 
investment, labour supply and asset holdings. Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2012)70 argue 
that this forward-looking behaviour of agents allows an econometrician to identify the 
horizon-specific news shocks, 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,ℎ, even though the econometrician cannot directly 
observe the shocks. Particularly, in Bayesian or maximum likelihood estimation, news 
shocks are identified through their effects on future expectations of structural 
disturbances, which influence agents’ economic decisions (Milani and Rajbhandari 
2012). For example, assuming again 𝐻= 3, agents’ expectation about disturbances, 
𝜀𝑧,𝑡+𝑚, for 𝑚≥4 at the period 𝑡 can be written as 
      𝐸𝑡𝜀𝑥,𝑡+𝑚= 𝜌𝑥𝐸𝑡𝜀𝑥,𝑡+𝑚−1 = 𝜌𝑥
𝑚+1𝜀𝑥,𝑡−1 + 𝜌𝑥
𝑚(𝜖𝑡−1
𝑥,1 + 𝜖𝑡−2
𝑥,2 + 𝜖𝑡−3
𝑥,3 ) + 𝜌𝑥
𝑚−1(𝜖𝑡
𝑥,1 +
                                                         𝜖𝑡−1
𝑥,2 + 𝜖𝑡−2
𝑥,3 ) + 𝜌𝑥
𝑚−2(𝜖𝑡
𝑥,2 + 𝜖𝑡−1
𝑥,3 ) + 𝜌𝑥
𝑚−3𝜖𝑡
𝑥,3  
The relation implies that agents’ expectations are influenced by the information set 
{𝜀𝑥,𝑡−1, 𝜖𝑡−1
𝑥,1 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,1, 𝜖𝑡−2
𝑥,2 , 𝜖𝑡−1
𝑥,2 , 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,2, 𝜖𝑡−3
𝑥,3 , 𝜖𝑡−2
𝑥,3 , 𝜖𝑡−1
𝑥,3 , 𝜖𝑡
𝑥,3 }, consisting both current and past 
news. Addition of the information set (i.e., news shocks) expands the state space system 
of the model. The law of motion of 𝜀𝑥,𝑡 can be added in the state-space representation as 
follows71: 
                                                           
70 They illustrate how to identify the standard deviation of the unanticipated and news shocks using full-
information, and the likelihood-based (i.e., Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood) econometric approach, 
and suggest that the identification of the standard deviation is possible when there are fewer observables 
than shocks. 
71 This recursive representation involves only as many exogenous state variables as the longest horizons, 
𝐻, which are much fewer than those in an alternative representation (i.e., canonical form of 𝜀𝑥,𝑡 process)

𝑥 is normal i.i.d. with zero mean and variance-matrix equal to the 
identity matrix (𝜖̃𝑡
𝑥~𝑖. 𝑖. 𝑑. 𝑁(0, I)). The coefficients, {𝜎𝑥,0, 𝜎𝑥,1, 𝜎𝑥,2, 𝜎𝑥,3} respectively 
denote the standard deviations of the unanticipated shock and one, two and three periods 
ahead news shocks. In the estimation procedure, both unanticipated and news shocks in 
the state-space presentation are considered as unobserved and the best estimates of how 
they evolve over the sample are obtained using the Kalman filter. A main interest here is 
to estimate the nonzero elements of 𝐺, given by the standard deviations, 𝜎𝑥,0, 𝜎𝑥,1 , 
𝜎𝑥,2 and 𝜎𝑥,3.       
In this simple example, 𝐻= 3 is considered. However, an important decision in the 
estimation is the choice of the news horizon, ℎ72. In Section 3.3, the best-fitting news 
horizon for each type of 𝑥 is searched using the approach proposed by Fujiwara et al. 
(2011).  
3.2.4.2 Revisions in agents’ expectations and business cycle 
As discussed by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2012), the structural approach to identify news 
shocks provides the possibility of accommodating revisions in news. News about a future 
economic activity can be fully realized or it can fail to materialize, leading to revisions in 
expectations. The upward or downward revisions in agents’ expectations can be sources 
of business cycle fluctuations. Let us consider revisions of the news in period 𝑡 about 
productivity improvements, which will take place in period 𝑡+ 5, 𝜖𝑡
𝑎,5. In case of ℎ=
{1,5}, obtained in Section 3.3, this news is subject to two revisions. Suppose, for example, 
that the realization of 𝜖𝑡
𝑎,5 is positive. This news builds up optimistic expectations about 
the future, thereby leading the economy into a boom today. The first revision occurs in 
                                                           
commonly used in the literature (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 2012). This is the matrix from of the following 
representation: 𝜀𝑥,𝑡= 𝜌𝑥𝜀𝑥,𝑡−1 + 𝜖̃𝑡

𝑥,1 = 𝜖̃𝑡

72 Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2012) and Khan and Tsoukalas 2012 directly choose ℎ= {4,8} in their 
specifications. However, a number of papers (e.g., Fujiwara et al. 2011and Milani and Treadwell 2012) use 
an approach that selects the ‘best-fitting’ horizons from a wide set of horizon combinations in terms of 
model fit.

period 𝑡+ 4, and suppose that the realization of 𝜖𝑡+4
𝑎,1  is negative. This is equivalent to the 
news that the productivity improvement announced in period 𝑡 will not materialize as 
expected. This news causes a downward revision in agents’ expectations, and thereby 
may induce a bust without any changes in economic fundamentals. The second revision 
of the news of period 𝑡 takes place in period 𝑡+ 5. Suppose that the realization of 𝜖𝑡+5
𝑎,0  is 
negative and offsets the earlier two news shocks, 𝜖𝑡
𝑎,5 + 𝜖𝑡+4
𝑎,1 . In this circumstance, agents 
realize that the former optimistic outlook for productivity did not turn out at all. At this 
point, the economy may experience a double dip recession, even though there are no 
changes in observed economic fundamentals. Therefore, DSGE models with news shocks 
are attractive in explaining business cycles and recessions73.   
3.3 The model solution, data and estimation 
3.3.1 The model solution  
The model consists of log-linear equations shown in Appendix 3.A, and the exogenous 
driven forces presented in equation (3.19). Using standard methods for solving the linear 
rational expectations model (e.g., Sims 2002), the model can be written in the following 
state-space form74 : 
                                     𝜉𝑡= 𝐹(𝜃)𝜉𝑡−1 + 𝐺(𝜃)𝜖𝑡,    𝜖𝑡~ 𝑁𝐼𝐷(0, 𝐼)                          (3.20) 
                                     𝑌𝑡= 𝐻(𝜃)𝜉𝑡                                                                          (3.21) 
where 𝜉𝑡 denotes the vector of state variables, consisting the model endogenous variables

disturbances (that are not i.i.d.) following an AR(1) process {𝜀𝑥,𝑡}; 𝜖𝑡 is the vector of 
structural i.i.d. innovations distributed 𝑁(0, 𝐼)  { 𝜖𝑥,𝑡, 𝜖̃𝑡
𝑧 } in the case of 𝐻= 3; 𝑌𝑡 denotes 
the vector of observables; and 𝑣𝑡 is the vector of i.i.d. measurement error distributed 
𝑁(0, 𝐼). The matrices 𝐹(𝜃), 𝐺(𝜃) and 𝐻(𝜃) are complicated nonlinear functions of the 
structural parameters of the model, implied by the vector 𝜃.   
                                                           
73 The RBC or DSGE models without news shocks necessarily require volatile and often negative 
unanticipated shocks of fundamentals (e.g., technology and aggregate demand) to explain a recession 
(Milani 2012). However, the models with news shocks do not require the volatile and negative 
unanticipated shocks, which are difficult to occur.   
74 Here, the parameter space for which the stable solution is unique is only considered.

3.3.2 Data  
The model is estimated using the US and Australian data over the period 1993:Q1- 
2013:Q4. The sample period starts in 1993:Q1 to (i) cover an inflation-targeting period 
in Australia, and (ii) provide the consistency between Australian data and the monopoly 
power hypothesis in Galí (2011a)’s approach75. The details of the observed data are given 
in Appendix 3.B.1. The US observables include quarterly percentage changes in the 
chain-type price index of gross domestic product (GDP), non-farm real GDP and the 
federal funds rate (per cent per annum), quarterly percentage changes in non-farm 
compensation per employee, the unemployment rate, and employment, taken from the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED 
database. Australian data includes non-farm real GDP, quarterly inflation in percentage 
rates, excluding interest rate tax changes of 1999-2000, the cash rate (per cent per annum), 
terms of trade and G7 GDP-weighted real exchange rate, quarterly percentage changes in 
average non-farm compensation per employee, the unemployment rate and employment 
obtained from the statistical tables prepared by the Reserve bank of Australia (RBA) and 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The published real exchange rate and the terms of 
trade are the inverse of the same variables in the model, so that the observables are 
converted into the model definition. Prior to empirical analysis, the data is transformed 
as follows. The nominal interest rate is expressed in quarterly terms (the annual interest 
rate is divided by four). Logarithm is taken from GDP and employment, and then the log-
variables are linearly de-trended (scaled by 100 to convert them into percentage). The 
real exchange rate and terms of trade are first log-differenced (scaled by 100) and then 
demeaned. The unemployment rate is de-trended, and all remaining series are demeaned 
separately in order to ensure both stationarity of variables and consistency between the 
data and variables in the model. The used data is plotted in Figure 3.B.1 of Appendix 3.B. 
3.3.3 Bayesian inference and priors  
Structural parameters of the model, 𝜃, are estimated using Bayesian methods. The state-
space representation of the model shown in equations (3.20) and (3.21) is used in 
evaluation of the likelihood function, 𝐿(𝑌𝑡|𝜃), performed by the Kalman filter. Given a 
                                                           
75As stated by Christiano (2011), the main assumption of the approach would fail to be rejected if there is 
a strong relationship between union power (imperfectly measured by union density) and unemployment 
rate. In the case of Australia, correlation between union density and unemployment rate over the sample 
period 1993-2013 is 0.95, therefore the main assumption of Galí’s approach is satisfied in the Australian 
economy over the inflation-targeting period.  

91 
 
prior distribution of parameter 𝑝(𝜃), the posterior likelihood function of parameters, 
ℒ(𝜃|𝑌𝑡), is proportional to the product, 𝐿(𝑌𝑡|𝜃) 𝑝(𝜃). This formulation for the posterior 
function is the basis of the Bayesian estimation. The Bayesian techniques such as Random 
Walk Metropolis (RWM) and Kalman filter algorithms used to obtain draws from the 
posterior distribution of parameters are detailed well by An and Shorfheide (2007) and 
Guerrón-Quintana and Nason (2012). Christopher Sims’s ‘csminwel’ optimization 
routine is used to obtain the posterior mode and to compute the Hessian matrix at the 
mode. To test the presence of the identification problem, over 50 optimization runs are 
launched, and the different optimization routine always converges to the same mode 
value. Since a unique mode for the model is found, the Hessian from the optimization 
routine is used as a proposal density, properly scaled (i.e., choosing c = 0.175) to attain 
an acceptance rate between 20-30 per cent. For the RWM results, two independent chains 
of 100,000 draws are generated, where the initial 40,000 draws are discarded. 
Convergence of the chains is monitored using both the univariate and the multivariate 
convergence diagnostics variants of Brooks and Gelman (1998). 
In what follows, specifications of priors are discussed. Priors for the parameters consist 
of two sets. The first set includes parameters that are fixed by standard values in the 
literature. The foreign and domestic discount factors, 𝛽∗and 𝛽, are fixed at 0.99 associated 
with a real interest rate of 4.0 per cent (annually) in the steady state. The parameter 
governing openness, 𝛼, is assigned the value of 0.185 (Justiniano and Preston 2010a), 
consistent with the share of imports in GDP (0.2) over the inflation-targeting period 
(Kuttner and Robinson 2010). Attempts to estimate the parameter give implausibly low 
values.  
The second set of parameters to be estimated consists of 76 parameters and their prior 
assumptions are listed in the first panel in Table 3.1. Most priors for both Australia and 
the US are selected fairly consistent with those used in the related literature (e.g., 
Justiniano and Preston 2010a,b, Robinson 2013 and Galí et al. 2011). An exception is the 
preference shifter parameter, 𝜗𝑧, governing the wealth elasticity of labour supply. 
Following the estimates obtained by Galí et al. (2011) and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 
(2012), the beta prior distribution for 𝜗𝑧, with the mean of 0.05 and the standard deviation 
of 0.025 is adopted to reduce the short-term wealth effect on labour supply. For all 
standard deviations of innovations of the estimated model, inverse-gamma distributions 
are used.

The prior distributions of the standard deviations of news components are assumed to be 
identical for each of the fourteen shocks in the model. As used by Fujiwara et al. (2011) 
and Gomes et al. (2013), for each shock, the variance of the unanticipated component is 
assumed to be equal to the sum of variance of the news components. This is equivalent 
to that the variance of the unanticipated component equals 50 per cent of the total variance 
of the shock76.

The total prior variances of the shocks are chosen as fairly diffuse to ensure that the 
second moments of the variables in the model are consistent with those in the data.  
3.3.4 News horizon selection: How many quarters in advance are news 
shocks anticipated? 
The news horizon for each of the fourteen shocks in the model is selected based on the 
overall fit of the models under different news horizon specifications as measured by the 
log marginal data density77. The following searching procedure is conducted. First, for 
comparison purpose, the log marginal data density of the model with no news shock is 
estimated. Second, for each of the fourteen shocks, log marginal data densities of models 
with news shock at each single horizon from 1 to 12 (i.e., ℎ= 1, ℎ= 2,…, ℎ= 12) are 
computed. For each shock, if all models with single news shock underperform the model 
with no news shock in terms of the log marginal data density, then the news component 
is not included in the shock structure. Third, for each of the fourteen shocks, if several 
models with single news shock perform better than the model with no news, then multiple 
news horizons are considered. In this case, for each type of shock, multiple news horizon 
specifications are based on the rank of the log marginal data densities, obtained from the 
second step. For instance, the combination of two news horizons, giving the highest 
values of log marginal data densities (e.g., for technology shock in Australia, the models 
with news at ℎ= 1 and ℎ= 5 are respectively ranked in the first and the second in terms 
of model fit) is considered as the initial multiple horizon specification (e.g., ℎ= {1,5}). 
Subsequent multiple horizon specifications are built by combining either the news 
horizon allowing next highest model fit with the previous multiple horizon specification 
or with the news horizon allowing the highest model fit (e.g., ℎ= {1,3,5} and ℎ= {1,3}). 
For each multiple horizon specification, the log marginal data densities are computed. 
Finally, for each of the fourteen shocks, the news horizon(s) (ℎ, single horizon or multiple 
horizons), providing the maximum log marginal data density, is selected.   
The log marginal data densities calculated for the model under different news horizon 
specifications are shown in Table 3.B.1 of Appendix 3.B. The results show that for most 
shocks, the specification with news shock(s) is preferred to the specification with no news 
                                                           
77 A similar approach is used by Fujiwara et al. (2011), Milani and Treadwell (2012) and Gomes et al. 
(2013) who focus on a single shock. Some others (e.g., Khan and Tsoukalas 2012 and Schmitt-Grohé and 
Uribe 2012) directly select same news horizons (e.g., ℎ= {4,8}) for all different shocks. This undertaking 
approach in this chapter allows us to select different news horizons for different shocks based on the data 
driven criteria.

in terms of the log marginal data density. The exceptions are Australian and the US news 
shocks to wage markup. All specifications with wage-markup news shocks are 
outperformed by no news specification. Thus, the news shocks on wage markup are not 
included in the estimated model. As a result of the news horizon search, the best-fitting 
individual news structures have been selected in the case of Australia as follows: ℎ=
{1,5} for the technology shock, ℎ= {3,9} for the preference (consumption) shock, ℎ=
{1,4} for the labour disutility shock, ℎ= 2 for the monetary policy shock, ℎ= 11 for the 
country risk premium shock and ℎ= 1 for the price markup shocks in the domestic and 
import firms. For the US economy, ℎ= 9 for the technology shock, ℎ= {6,8} for the 
preference (consumption) shock, ℎ= 2 for both labour disutility shock and monetary 
policy shock, and ℎ= 10 for the price markup shock are chosen as the best-fitting 
horizon structure. The choice of ℎ= 2 for the US monetary policy shock is also obtained 
by Gomes et al. (2013).  
Joint inclusion of news shocks at the selected horizons is used to produce all results such 
as posterior estimates, impulse responses, variance decomposition and historical 
decomposition. Whether the joint inclusion of the news shocks improves the overall fit 
of the model is formally investigated in Section 3.3.6.  
3.3.5 Posterior estimates of the parameters 
The last panel in Table 3.1 reports the posterior estimates of the model parameters. The 
data are informative about the estimated parameters, and the estimates are fairly 
consistent with those of previous papers (e.g., Justiniano and Preston (2010a), Robinson 
(2013) for Australia, and Smets and Wouters (2007), Galí et al. (2011) for the US). For 
this reason and given the focus of this chapter on the impact of news shocks on labour 
market and macroeconomic fluctuations, only the selected parameters are discussed. The 
estimates of parameters, 𝜃𝜔 and 𝜃𝜔
∗, indicate that wages in both Australia and the US are 
re-optimized approximately every two quarters, while 𝛿𝜔 and 𝛿𝜔
∗ imply the relatively low 
level of backward indexation in both countries. As found by Theodorides and Zanetti 
(2014), the wage rigidities would help to replicate the empirical results regarding 
responses of unemployment and wages to a productivity news shock. The estimated 
labour supply elasticity in Australia is lower than it is in the US. The inverse of the Frisch 
labour supply elasticity is 5.61 in Australia and 4.98 in the US. According to the finding 
obtained by Grabek and Kłos (2013), the low labour supply elasticity in both countries 

96 
 
may result in the strong response of real wages and the weak response of unemployment 
to an unanticipated monetary policy shock. However, the estimated steady-state wage 
markup in Australia (32 per cent) is higher than it is in the US (25 per cent). The steady-
state wage markups are generally consistent with an average unemployment rate of 6.5 
per cent and 6.0 per cent over the period 1993:Q1-2013:Q4 in Australia and the US, 
respectively.  
The posterior mean of the parameters, 𝜗𝑧 and 𝜗𝑧
∗, controlling the short-run wealth effects 
on labour supply, are estimated as 0.06 and 0.11, respectively. The lower values imply 
that the preference in both Australia and the US is closer to a preference used by 
Greenwood et al. (1988), and therefore would help to generate (i) the co-movement of 
output and labour force (and employment) in response to news shocks about future 
productivity as originally argued by Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008, 2009), and (ii) the pro-
cyclical movement of both employment and labour force in response to unanticipated 
technology and monetary policy shocks as discussed by Christiano et al. (2010b) and Galí 
et al. (2011). In both Australia and the US, monetary policy is inertial, with parameters, 
𝜌𝑅and 𝜌𝑅
∗, of around 0.9, and is implemented as anti-inflationary policy, with parameters, 
𝜒𝜋 and 𝜒𝜋
∗, of more than two. Badarinza and Margaritov (2011) have shown that the 
interest rate smoothing and inflation targeting behaviour amplify the effects of the 
monetary policy news shock.  
The data contains significant information about the parameters of the shock processes as 
the small size of the posterior standard deviation is measured compared to the prior 
standard deviation. The exception is the unanticipated component of consumption 
preference shock, where the standard deviation of the posterior is larger than the standard 
deviation of the prior. The estimated standard deviations of news and unanticipated 
components imply that a substantial part of the variances of the shocks is anticipated in 
Australia. News components account for 73.5 per cent78 of 𝜎𝑎

78 From Table 3.1, the unanticipated component (𝜎𝑎,0) is 0.34 and news components (𝜎𝑎,0 and 𝜎𝑎,1) are 0.46

accounts for over 50 per cent of the variance of monetary policy shocks, is entirely 
consistent with results found by Milani and Treadwell (2012) and Gomes et al. (2012).  
3.3.6 The model fit and comparison 
Figure 3.B.1 in Appendix 3.B shows the data and the model’s one-sided predicted values 
(one-step ahead prediction) of the observed variables. The in-sample fit for most of the 
variables is reasonably good. The exceptions are wage inflations in Australia and the US. 
These variables are quite volatile at quarterly frequency and difficult to predict as 
discussed by Jääskelä and Nimark (2011) for Australia and by Justiniano et al. (2013) for 
the US. However, the estimated model explains the general movement of the wage 
inflations.  In order to investigate how the presence of the news shocks improves the 
overall fit of the estimated model, Table 3.2 presents the log marginal data densities of 
alternative models along with the corresponding Bayes factors, calculated by considering 
ℳ0 is as the null hypothesis.

Notes: The table reports Bayes factor comparing the model ℳ0 to ℳ1(or ℳ2). The log marginal data 
densities reported here are computed from the posterior draws using the Laplace approximation.  
According to the last row in Table 3.2, the log marginal data density of the model without 
news shocks (ℳ2) is -1302.99. The first and second rows show that the model fit 
improves when news shocks are introduced. In particular, the Bayes factor between the 
model with only Australian news shocks (ℳ1) and the model without news shocks 
(ℬℱ1,2|𝑌𝑇) is slightly above 23, implying ‘strong’ evidence in favour of  ℳ1 model with 
news shocks originating in Australia, according to Kass and Raftery (1995)79.  
In order to assess the significance of the US news shocks in the estimated model, ℳ0 
model is compared with ℳ1 model. The Bayes factor, ℬℱ0,1|𝑌𝑇= 14185.9 suggests 
                                                           
79 According to their scale of evidence, a Bayes factor between 1 and 3 is ‘not worth more than a bare 
mention’, between 3 and 20 suggests a ‘positive’ evidence, between 20 and 150 suggests a ‘strong’ 
evidence, and larger than 150 ‘very strong’ evidence in favour of one of the two models.  

98 
 
‘very strong’ evidence in favour of ℳ0 model, implying that the inclusion of the US news 
shocks helps to improve the overall fit of the model. The Bayes factor between ℳ0 model 
and ℳ2 model, ℬℱ0,2|𝑌𝑇= 331041.8 also offers ‘very strong’ evidence for the 
importance of news shocks originated in both Australian and the US. It is also important 
to note that the log marginal data density of ℳ0 model is higher than all log marginal 
data densities of the models with news shocks shown in Table 3.B.1 of Appendix 3.B. 
Therefore, the Bayesian model comparison shows that the presence of news shocks (i.e., 
combination among different types of shocks in domestic and foreign economies) has the 
potential to improve the overall fit of the estimated small open economy DSGE model.  
Table 3.3 reports the estimated model’s unconditional predictions of second moments

Notes: The table presents the mean of the posterior distribution of the statistics implied by the estimated 
model.  
For comparison, the table also presents the corresponding empirical second moments 
calculated over the sample 1993:Q2 to 2013:Q4. The empirical second moments are well 
matched by the estimated model. For instance, the model reasonably replicates the 
observed levels of volatility in all six variables of the US economy, and changes in real 
exchange rate, changes in terms of trade and wage inflation for Australia. However, the 
model overpredicts the standard deviations of inflation, output, cash rate, unemployment 
and employment in Australia. A possible explanation for the overprediction is the fact 
that variances of the shocks are estimated in high values in order to match with high 
standard deviation of changes in real exchange rate and changes in terms of trade. The 

99 
 
model does a good job in replicating the autocorrelations with exceptions of wage 
inflations in Australia and the US.  
3.4. The importance of news shocks  
3.4.1 Impulse responses: what are the effects of news shocks?  
3.4.1.1 Technology shocks 
The effect of technology news shock in the estimated model is firstly interested because 
the news-driven business cycle literature heavily focuses on the shock. Figure 3.1 
compares the estimated impulse responses of Australian variables to the unanticipated 
domestic technology shock and to the five-period-ahead news about domestic 
technology. 
Figure 13.3.1 Impulse responses to a positive AU technology shocks 
 
Notes: Impulse responses of eight domestic observed variables to one-standard-deviation 
unanticipated shock (solid lines) and 5-period-ahead news shock (dashed lines). The lines represent 
posterior means and 90 per cent posterior probability interval.  
In the context of the estimated model, employment decreases, and output, labour force 
and unemployment increase in responding to the positive unanticipated technology 
shock. The result implies that the model cannot reproduce the pro-cyclical employment 
in response to the unanticipated technology shock.

However, good news about domestic future technology initially generates pro-cyclical 
employment and labour force in Australia. The impact responses of output, employment 
and labour force are ambiguous. After the impact period, as predicted in the news-driven 
business cycle literature, those variables jointly increase and unemployment decreases in 
response to the 5-period-ahead news shock. Therefore, the estimated model with the 
endogenous preference shifter and nominal rigidities has the potential to replicate the 
VAR-based results in small open economies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and United 
Kingdom) obtained by Kamber et al. (2014). 
The responses of nominal variables are in line with the result found by Adalid and Detken 
(2007) and Chiristiano et al. (2010a) in the sense that the inflation in the booming period 
is below its steady state value. The monetary policy rule with high weight to inflation 
therefore induces the fall in interest rate. The news shock leads to a deprecation of real 
exchange rate in the hump-shaped manner. Therefore, the estimated responses of the 
exchange rates are entirely consistent with those found by Matsumoto et al. (2008) using 
a calibrated small open economy DSGE model, and are in line with results obtained by 
Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008) and Kamber et al. (2014), showing that positive 
productivity news shocks are associated with counter-cyclical current accounts. 
However, actual realization of the 5-period-ahead news shock leads to higher 
unemployment in Australia.   
In order to explore the answer to the question, what is the role of technology news shocks 
in explaining domestic and international business cycle? the effects of the US technology 
shocks are also interested. Figure 3.2 compares the impulse responses of both Australian 
and the US variables to the unanticipated shock and to the 9-period-ahead news shock 
about the US technology. 
The responses of the US variables are consistent with those found in previous studies 
(e.g., Beaudry and Pertier 2006, Galí 2011c, Galí et al. 2011, Fujiwara et al. 2011 and 
Badarinza and Margaritov 2011). The US unanticipated technology shock does not 
generate the pro-cyclical employment as found by Galí (1999, 2011c), whereas good 
news about future technology in the US economy set off a boom today. For instance, the 
9-period ahead technology news shock is associated with initial increases in output, 
employment, labour force, inflation, wage inflation, interest rate, and a decrease in 
unemployment rate in the US. However, after the realization of the shock, the boom is 
followed by a rise in unemployment and declines in inflation and interest rate. The 

101 
 
estimated model also qualitatively replicates the VAR-based results shown by 
Theodorides and Zanetti (2014), indicating that unemployment falls, whereas wages 
increase in response to a good technology news shock.      
Figure 14.3.2 Impulse responses to a positive US technology shocks 
 
 
Notes: Impulse responses of observed variables to one standard deviation unanticipated shock (solid 
lines) and 9-period-ahead technology news shock (dashed lines). The lines represent posterior means 
and 90 per cent posterior probability interval.  
The most important result here is that the positive technology news in the US also leads 
to business cycle co-movement in Australia, supporting the news view of international 
business cycles. The estimated model reproduces results of the VAR analysis shown by 
Kosaka (2013) for a small open economy (i.e., Canada) in the sense that the US news 
shock drives joint business cycle co-movements across countries (i.e., the US and

Australia). In addition, initial responses of the most nominal variables to the US news 
shock are shown to be the mirror (but asymmetric) image of the responses to the 
unanticipated shock.  
3.4.1.2 Monetary policy shocks 
Figure 3.3 shows impulse responses of macroeconomic variables to the unanticipated 
shock and to the two-period-ahead news about the tightening of Australian monetary 
policy.  
Figure 15.3.3 Impulse responses to a tightening AU monetary policy shocks 
 
Notes: Impulse responses of eight domestic observed variables to one standard deviation unanticipated 
MP shocks (solid lines) and 2-period-ahead monetary policy news shock (dashed lines). The lines 
represent posterior means and 90 per cent posterior probability interval.  
 
The impulse responses to the unanticipated monetary policy shock are matched with 
findings typically obtained in previous studies (e.g., Nimark 2009 and Jääskelä and 
Nimark 2011). The qualitative characteristic of the impulse responses to the unanticipated 
and the news shocks are quite similar, except for the response of the nominal interest rate. 
Both unanticipated and news shocks induce a fall in output and employment. The fall in 
labour demand increases the wage markup through increasing the marginal product of 
labour. The higher wage markup explains the impact decline in wage inflation, and 
thereby the impact fall in inflation. The unanticipated monetary policy shock leads to the 
hump-shaped response of the real exchange rate. Owing to the lower estimate of 𝜗𝑧, 
employment and labour force move together in the first couple of periods in response to 
both unanticipated and news shocks, whereas unemployment increases in a hump-shaped

manner. An interesting result is that an announcement about future tightening of monetary 
policy lowers the current interest rate by reducing current inflation and output growth. 
The actual materialization of the monetary policy news shock leads to a slight 
overshooting of the nominal interest rate.  
Figure 3.B.6 in Appendix 3.B displays the impulse responses of both Australian and the 
US variables to the unanticipated and the two-period-ahead news shocks on US monetary 
policy. All impulse responses of the US variables to both shocks replicate the results 
typically found in the literature (e.g., Badarinza and Margaritov 2011, Milani and 
Treadwell 2012 and Gomez et al. 2013). The unanticipated tightening of US monetary 
policy leads to a decline in real economy activity. The weak economic activity leads to a 
fall in wage inflation, inflation and a rise in unemployment through the same channel 
explained in the case of Australia. 
For all US variables, the news shock has more persistent effect compared to the 
unanticipated shock, though there are no qualitative differences in the dynamic responses 
of labour market and macroeconomic variables. However, both shocks in the US 
monetary policy lead to a rise in real economic activity in Australia, mainly driven by the 
depreciation of the Australian dollar. When both central banks in Australia and the US 
simultaneously announce current or future changes in their stance towards monetary 
policy (e.g., let us assume same amount of changes in their interest rates), there is no 
significant change in the nominal exchange rate of the Australian dollar. Therefore, the 
impacts of US monetary policy on the Australian economy will be negligible compared 
to those of Australian monetary policy. 
3.4.1.3 Other shocks 
As a novelty in the literature, the estimated model allows us to study the effects of other 
types of news shocks such as country risk premium, preference, labour disutility and price 
markup shocks originating in both Australia and the US. The impulse responses to those 
news shocks are shown in Figure 3.B.2-3.B.8 of Appendix 3.B. An important result here 
is that the consumption preference news shock leads to business cycle in Australia, and 
same news shock originating in the US induces international the business cycles across 
Australia and the US. For the preference shock, the unanticipated and the news shocks 
have different initial effects. As shown in the literature, the unanticipated positive demand 
shock directly increases the real economic activity. However, in both Australia and the 

104 
 
US, the news about future surges in the consumption initially drives the real economic 
activity into a recession. The news about future rise in consumption initially leads to more 
savings and reduces current consumption. The fall in current consumption declines the 
current domestic demand for output, and thereby demand for labour. The lower demand 
for labour and output induces fall in the employment, wage and price inflations and a rise 
in unemployment. In responding to the situation, the interest rate declines through easing 
monetary policy. Prior to materialization of the news shock, real exchange rate and labour 
force in Australia do not respond significantly to the news shock originating both in 
Australia and the US. After the realization of the shock, demands for output and 
employment increase, and therefore inflation rises. As a result, real exchange rate starts 
to appreciate and unemployment falls.  
Country risk premium shocks also lead to business cycles in Australia. The unanticipated 
positive risk premium shock boosts real economic activity. News about future increase in 
the risk premium initially drives Australian economy into a stagflation, and the economy 
moves into a recovery position after the realization of the news shock. The different 
responses to the unanticipated and the news shocks are related to two effects, which work 
in opposite directions. First, current unanticipated changes in the risk premium or the 
news about future changes in the risk premium increase the holding of foreign assets, 
which decreases current consumption. Lower domestic demand leads to a fall in output, 
and thereby decreases demand for employment. Because of the weak wealth effect, the 
fall in consumption does not significantly increase the labour force. As a result, wage 
inflation declines and unemployment increases prior to the materialization of the news 
shock. Second, the holding of foreign assets leads to the depreciation of the domestic 
nominal exchange rate. The depreciation of the exchange rate supports higher foreign 
demand for domestic goods, and thus output increases. The depreciation of the nominal 
exchange rate also drives an inflation pressure. In responding to the rise in inflation, the 
interest rate rises gradually. This news shock initially leads to the recession as the effect 
of the first channel initially dominates those in the second channel. The economy starts 
to recover over time as the effect of the second channel dominates those in the first 
channel. When the news shock is materialized in period 11, the economy formally moves 
into a boom, mainly driven by high depreciation of the real exchange rate.     
For labour supply and price markup shocks, originating in Australia and the US, there are 
no qualitative changes between impulse responses to the unanticipated shock and to news 

105 
 
shock. A slight difference in the shape of the responses is that unfavourable news about 
future labour supply leads to the rise in today’s unemployment rate. The impulse 
responses to unanticipated wage markup shocks originating in Australia and the US are 
consistent with those found by Galí et al. (2011).  
3.4.2 Variance decomposition: What has driven business cycle    
fluctuations?  
In order to assess the importance of news shocks in Australian and the US 
macroeconomic fluctuations, the variance decomposition is examined. Figure 3.B.9 in 
Appendix 3.B presents the contribution of unanticipated and news shocks to the forecast 
error variance of observables. The result suggests that the news shocks are important 
sources of macroeconomic fluctuations in both economies. In particular, the Australian 
economy is more news driven than the US economy. For instance, the news shocks 
account for over 50 per cent of the 20-quarter ahead forecasting error variance of 
Australian output, inflation and interest rate. However, the news shocks originating in the 
US account for less than 35 per cent of the variance of the US macro variables. Moreover, 
the contribution of news shocks in explaining the forecast error variance of Australian 
observables rises when forecast horizon increases. The results imply that macroeconomic 
fluctuations are mainly driven by unanticipated shocks in the short-run, whereas the 
fluctuations in the medium-to-long run are mainly attributable to news shocks in 
Australia. Another interesting finding here is that wage inflation and unemployment rate 
in the US are respectively less and more anticipated than those in Australia. The fractions 
of variances in the US labour market variables explained by news shocks are totally 
consistent with the VAR-based result shown by Theodoridis and Zaneti (2014).  
To explore what type of news shock is more important in business cycle fluctuations, 
Table 3.4 presents an unconditional variance decomposition of fourteen observables into 
the twenty eight shocks (i.e., sources of uncertainty) in the estimated model. In the 
perspective of the estimated model, contributions of news shocks in explaining variances 
of five Australian observables (output, employment, inflation, wage inflation and interest 
rate) dominate those of unanticipated shocks. For the remaining three Australian 
observables (unemployment, changes in real exchange rate and changes in terms of 
trade), the news shocks account for one-third of their unconditional variances. For the 
US, the unanticipated shocks dominate in variances of all six observables.

Consistent with the RBC literature, the technology (i.e., productivity) shock is the most 
important source of output fluctuations in both Australia and the US. For instance, the 
technology shock explains about two-thirds of the variance of outputs in Australia and 
the US. In contrast to the literature, over half of the variance of Australian output is 
attributable to the news component of the technology shock. This result is in line with the 
VAR-based results for small open economies (i.e., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and 
UK) obtained by Kamber et al. (2013). In addition, movements in the remaining 
Australian observables explained by the technology shock are mainly attributable to their 
news components. For example, the news about Australian future technology explains 
about 25 per cent of the variance of inflation and wage inflation. However, news about 
the US future technology accounts for less than 12 per cent of the variance of the US 
observables. The relatively small contribution of the US technology news shock is 
consistent with the results found by Fujiwara et al. (2011), Khan and Tsoukalas (2011) 
and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2012).  
The country risk premium shock is another important source of the Australian business 
cycle. The risk premium shocks explain 86, 78, 50 and 18 per cent of the unconditional 
variance of Australian interest rate, real exchange rate, employment and output, 
respectively. The most interesting finding here is that the news component of the risk 
premium shock accounts for two-thirds of total movements in most of the observables 
due to the shocks. The present results are in line with the existing literature, highlighting 
the relevance of the risk premium shock in Australian interest rate and exchange rate 
fluctuations. For instance, the sign-restricted VAR result reported by Liu (2010) shows 
that above 46 per cent of the 4-quarter ahead forecasting error variance of interest rate is 
attributed to the risk premium shock, and Leu (2011) finds that the shock explains 86 per 
cent of the 4-quarter ahead forecasting error variance of interest rate. Nimark (2009) 
shows that over half of the unconditional variance of the exchange rate is attributable to 
the risk premium shock.  
There is a significant difference between Australia and the US regarding the importance 
of consumption preference shocks in driving business cycle fluctuations. As found in a 
number of studies (e.g., Justiniano et al. 2010, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 2012, and 
Christiano et al. 2014), the preference shocks play a vital role in explaining the variance 
of output in the US. The preference shocks account for one-third of the variance of output 
and three-fourths of the variance of employment in the US. Instead, fluctuations in most 
Australian observables are less driven by preference shocks. Over 10 per cent of the 

108 
 
variances of unemployment and employment are attributed to the shock. A reasonable 
explanation for this is that the open economy dimension may dampen the effects of 
demand shocks, and amplify effects of supply shocks on real quantities as found by 
Christiano et al. (2011). However, a common observation in both countries is that news 
component of the preference shock plays a minor role in generating macroeconomic 
fluctuations.   
Labour market shocks have a minor role in explaining movements in non-labour market 
indicators of aggregate activity. The similar result is also shown by Christiano et al. 
(2011), demonstrating the insignificance of labour market shocks in explaining Swedish 
output. Wage markup shocks play a minor role in the US output and employment 
fluctuations, and demand shocks are the important sources of unemployment movements 
as found by Galí et al. (2011). Unemployment fluctuations in Australia are equally driven 
by country risk premium, supply and demand shocks. Country risk premium, wage 
markup and supply shocks respectively account for around one-third of the variance in 
Australian wage inflation. In the US economy, 19 and 71 per cent of the variance of wage 
inflation is attributable to demand and wage markup shocks, respectively.  
Monetary policy shocks account for only a very limited portion of fluctuations in most of 
the observables. An exception is the importance of the shocks in explaining 
unemployment rate movements as the shocks account for 16.4 and 12 per cent of the 
unemployment rate variance in the US and Australia, respectively. As shown by Milani 
and Treadwell (2012) and Gomes et al. (2013), the news shock on the US monetary policy 
is generally more important than unanticipated monetary policy shock in explaining the 
US business cycle. However, this is not the case in Australia.   
The price markup shocks explain a substantial part of inflation variance in both 
economies. For instance, 21 and 40 per cent of Australian inflation and changes in terms 
of trade are attributed to price markup shocks. The result is consistent with those reported 
by Nimark (2009) and Liu (2010). The price markup shocks are equally important as the 
preference and labour disutility shocks in explaining Australian output fluctuations. 
Furthermore, the shocks account for around 15 per cent of the variation in Australian 
employment and unemployment rate. The news component of the shocks account for one-
third of movements in Australian observables driven by the shocks. Among the US news 
shocks, 10-quarter-ahead news about the price markup is most significant in explaining 
the variations in the US inflation, interest rate and wage inflation. Studies (e.g., Justiniano 

109 
 
et al. 2010 and Galí et al. 2011) have shown that about 30 per cent of the US inflation 
variance is explained by the price markup shock. Results presented in Table 3.4 suggest 
that the US price markup shock explains 35 and 11 per cent of movements in the US 
inflation and interest rate, respectively. In particular, movements in the US observables 
explained by the price markup shock are mainly attributable to the news component of 
the shock.   
As discussed by Justiniano and Preston (2010b), the specification of the estimated model, 
abstracted from international financial linkages and cross-country linkages at multiple 
stages of production, fails to account for the influence of foreign shocks. The US shocks 
explain 5 per cent or less of variations in Australian observables. A novel result here is 
that the US news shocks are less relevant in accounting for the variations in Australian 
observables compared to the US unanticipated shocks.  
3.4.3 Historical decomposition: Do news shocks drive the economy 
over time? 
It is important to use the estimated model to analyse historical decomposition, which 
describes the variation of key variables in the model over time in terms of the structural 
shocks. Figure 3.B.10 in Appendix 3.B displays historical decompositions that exhibit 
the contribution of news shocks to movements in each observable over the period 
1993:Q2-2013:Q4. A number of results stand out. First, news shocks have played a vital 
role in driving fluctuations in Australian output, employment and interest rate over the 
sample period. An interesting finding is that the fall in cash rate, output growth and 
employment during the GFC is basically explained by news shocks. The contribution of 
news shocks to the cash rate was positive and high over periods 2004-2008, and the actual 
cash rate was relatively low during the same period. Second, for most of the sample 
period, news shocks have played a minor role in explaining movements in Australian 
unemployment rate and wage inflation, whereas their relevance increases over the periods 
2008-2011 as they contribute to the bulk of movements in these variables. Third, news 
shocks have a certain impact on Australian inflation, changes in real exchange rate and 
changes in terms of trade. However the strong movements in these variables are mostly 
triggered by the unanticipated shocks. Fourth, though news shocks have played a 
moderate role in fluctuations of most of the US observables, the contributions explained 
by news shocks entirely move together with the actual observables. In addition, news 

110 
 
shocks contribute to the bulk of movements in US inflation over the periods 1996-2000 
and early 2012 onwards. Finally, news shocks have not been a major source of the US 
recession during the GFC. As noted by Theodorides and Zanetti (2014), news shocks play 
a minimal role in movements of the US wage inflation.   
3.5 Conclusion  
This chapter has assessed the importance of news shocks as sources of labour market and 
macroeconomic fluctuations using an estimated small open economy DSGE model. In 
doing so, the model developed in Chapter 2 is further extended to include the theory of 
involuntary unemployment proposed by Galí 2011(a,b), and the endogenous preference 
shifter employed by Galí et al. (2011), which allows for controlling the short-run wealth 
effects on labour supply. The model is also driven by both unanticipated and news shocks, 
and estimated using Bayesian methods based on Australian and US data over the period 
1993:Q1-2013:Q4.  
The analysis delivers a number of key results. First, the Bayesian model comparison 
confirms that the presence of joint news shocks (i.e., a combination among different types 
of shocks in Australia and the US) has the potential to improve the overall fit of an 
estimated small open economy model. Second, the estimated model with the endogenous 
preference shifter and nominal rigidities has the ability to qualitatively replicate results 
of the VAR analyses (e.g., Kosaka 2013 and Kamber et al. 2014), supporting the view of 
news-driven domestic and international business cycles in open economies80. News about 
future technology and consumption preference could lead to business cycles in both 
Australia and the US, and the news about future country risk premium can drive 
macroeconomic fluctuations in Australia. Third, the estimated responses of labour market 
variables to technology news shocks are in line with the VAR-based results (e.g., 
Theodoridis and Zanetti 2014) in the sense that a positive technology news shock causes 
a counter-cyclical unemployment rate and rise in wages. News shocks account for 35 and 
41 per cent of unemployment fluctuations in Australia and the US, respectively. Fourth, 
news shocks play a major role in the Australian business cycle over the inflation-targeting 
period. Over half of the variances in Australian most observables are explained by news 
shocks. In addition, news shocks were a main source of the Australian recession during 
                                                           
80 The news about future domestic technology does lead to positive co-movement among output, 
employment and labour force in both Australia and the US. In addition, the US news shocks on technology 
and preference do propagate to Australia, generating international business cycles.

the GFC. Fifth, the news about future country risk premium is an important source of the 
business cycle in Australia. For example, the risk premium news shock accounts for over 
one-fourth of the unconditional variances in most Australian observables. Finally, the real 
exchange rate plays a vital role in the propagation of news shocks. Positive news shocks 
on technology and country risk premium are associated with the depreciation of the real 
exchange rate. About one-third of the variance in the real exchange rate is attributable to 
news shocks, particularly to news about future country risk premium. The results showing 
the importance of country risk premium shock in the business cycle and role of flexible 
exchange rate in the propagation of shocks are entirely consistent with existing literature 
on the Australian business cycle (e.g., Nimark 2009, Liu 2010, Jääskelä and Nimark 2011 
and Leu 2011).   
Further augmentations of the present model may include (i) allowing for propagation of 
shocks passing through investment and financial intermediation, and (ii) introducing 
investment and financial shocks, recently identified as important drivers of business 
cycles (e.g., Justiniano et al. 2010 and Christiano et al. 2011, 2014). It is left for the next 
chapter to assess the impact of financial shocks on business cycles in a small open 
economy.

Appendix 3.A Equations of the log-linearized model 
The steady state of the model is characterized by zero inflation and balanced trade. All 
variables are in log-deviation from their respective steady state values (𝑥𝑡=
𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑋𝑡𝑋
⁄ ))81.  
3.A.1 Domestic Economy  
Euler equation:  𝑐𝑡−ℎ𝑐𝑡−1 = 𝐸𝑡(𝑐𝑡+1 −ℎ𝑐𝑡) −𝜎−1(1 −ℎ)(𝑖𝑡−𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1) + 
𝜎−1(1 −ℎ)(𝜀𝑔,𝑡−𝜀𝑔,𝑡+1)                    
 
 
(3.A.1) 
where 𝑖𝑡 and 𝜋𝑡 respectively denotes nominal interest rate and overall CPI inflation.  
Goods market clearing:  
     𝑦𝑡= (1 −𝛼)𝑐𝑡+ 𝛼𝜂(2 −𝛼)𝑠𝑡+ 𝛼𝜂𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ 𝛼𝑦𝑡
∗                         (3.A.2) 
where α is the share of foreign goods in the aggregate consumption bundle; 𝜂 is the 
elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods; 𝑦𝑡 and 𝑦𝑡
∗ are domestic and 
foreign output, respectively; 𝜓𝐹,𝑡= (𝑒𝑡+ 𝑝𝑡
∗) −𝑝𝐹,𝑡 and 𝑠𝑡= 𝑝𝐹,𝑡−𝑝𝐻,𝑡 respectively 
denote the law of one price gap, so-called by Monacelli (2005) and the terms of trade.  
Time-differences in the terms of trade: 
    Δ𝑠𝑡= 𝜋𝐹,𝑡−𝜋𝐻,𝑡  
                                     
            (3.A.3) 
where 𝜋𝐹,𝑡= 𝑝𝐹,𝑡−𝑝𝐹,𝑡−1  and 𝜋𝐻,𝑡= 𝑝𝐻,𝑡−𝑝𝐻,𝑡−1 respectively denote inflation of 
imported goods and inflation of domestically produced goods.  
Real exchange rate:  𝑞𝑡= 𝑒𝑡+ 𝑝𝑡
∗−𝑝𝑡= 𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ (1 −𝛼)𝑠𝑡                                          (3.A.4) 
Real exchange rate therefore depends on deviations from the law of one price and terms 
of trade.  
Domestic firms’ inflation equation extended with the cost channel:  
            𝜋𝐻,𝑡−𝛿𝐻𝜋𝐻,𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝐸𝑡(𝜋𝐻,𝑡+1 −𝛿𝐻𝜋𝐻,𝑡) + 𝑘𝐻𝑚𝑐𝑡+ 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡               (3.A.5) 
with 𝑘𝐻=
(1−𝜃𝐻)(1−𝜃𝐻𝛽)
𝜃𝐻
 , where 𝜃𝐻 and 𝛿𝐻 respectively denote the domestic Calvo price 
stickness and the domestic price indexation parameters; 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡 is a price markup shock 
that captures inefficient variations in the domestic firm’s price markup82; and 
Real marginal costs:   𝑚𝑐𝑡= 𝜔𝑡+ 𝛼𝑠𝑡+ 𝜐𝐻𝑖𝑡−𝜀𝑎,𝑡,  where 𝜐𝐻 denotes a friction of 
domestic firms’ wage bill that must be financed in advance, and 𝜔𝑡= 𝑤𝑡−𝑝𝑡 is the real 
wage, where 𝑤𝑡 and 𝑝𝑡 respectively denote nominal wage and price.  
 
 
 
                                                           
81 Exceptions are: the nominal and real exchange rate are defined as 𝑒𝑡= log(𝑒̃𝑡𝑒̃
⁄ ), 𝑞𝑡= log(𝑞̃𝑡𝑞̃
⁄ ); 
interest rates are specified as 𝑖𝑡= 𝑖̃𝑡−𝑖̃, the net foreign asset is denoted as 𝑎𝑡= 𝐴𝑡−𝐴 and the shocks are 
described as 𝜀𝑥,𝑡= log (𝜀̃𝑥,𝑡𝜀̃𝑥
⁄
), 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡= 𝜀̃𝑟𝑝,𝑡−𝜀̃𝑟𝑝. 
82 It is assumed that 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐻,𝑡= 𝑘𝐻𝜇𝐻,𝑡
𝑝 and 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡= 𝑘𝐹𝜇𝐹,𝑡
𝑝, where 𝜇𝐻,𝑡
𝑝and 𝜇𝐹,𝑡
𝑝 are price markup shocks in 
domestic and retail sectors, as discussed by Smets and Wouters (2003, 2007). 

119 
 
Retailers’ inflation equation, extended with the cost channel: 
   
𝜋𝐹,𝑡−𝛿𝐹𝜋𝐹,𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝐸𝑡(𝜋𝐹,𝑡+1 −𝛿𝐹𝜋𝐹,𝑡) + 𝑘𝐹(𝜓𝐹,𝑡+ 𝜐𝐹𝑖𝑡
∗) + 𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡  (3.A.6) 
where 𝑘𝐹=
(1−𝜃𝐹)(1−𝜃𝐹𝛽)
𝜃𝐹
, 𝜐𝐹 corresponds to a friction of retail firms’ inputs with foreign 
currency that must be financed in advance, 𝑖𝑡
∗ is the foreign nominal interest rate, and 
𝜀𝑐𝑝𝐹,𝑡 captures variations in the retailers’ price mark-up.  
Consumer price index (CPI) inflation: 
                    𝜋𝑡= 𝜋𝐻,𝑡+ 𝛼∆𝑠𝑡  
  
                
    
 
   (3.A.7) 
The CPI inflation is equal to the sum of domestic goods price inflation and terms of trade, 
weighted by the importance of imported goods in the CPI basket.     
Real wage:         𝜔𝑡= 𝜔𝑡−1 + 𝜋𝑡
𝜔−𝜋𝑡                                                                  (3.A.8) 
Wage inflation:  𝜋𝑡
𝜔−𝛿𝜔𝜋𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝐸𝑡(𝜋𝑡+1
𝜔
−𝛿𝜔𝜋𝑡) −𝜚𝜔(𝜇𝜔,𝑡−𝜇𝜔,𝑡
𝑛)              (3.A.9) 
with 𝜚𝜔≡
(1−𝜃𝜔)(1−𝛽𝜃𝜔)
𝜃𝜔(1+𝜑𝜁𝜔) , 𝜇𝜔,𝑡
𝑛
= 100 ∙𝜀𝜔,𝑡 and  
Average wage markups and unemployment: 
                       𝜇𝜔,𝑡= 𝜔𝑡−(𝑧𝑡+ 𝜑𝑛𝑡+ 𝜀𝑛,𝑡) =  𝜑𝑢𝑡                                      (3.A.10)     
Equation (3.A.10) allows us to correctly identify both wage markup shock and labour 
supply shock.  
Endogenous reference shifter: 
                   𝑧𝑡= (1 −𝜗𝑧) 𝑧𝑡−1 + 𝜗𝑧(−𝜀𝑔,𝑡+ (𝜎(1 −ℎ)
⁄
)(𝑐𝑡−ℎ𝑐𝑡−1))  (3.A.11) 
Employment and labour force:   
                       𝑛𝑡= 𝑦𝑡−𝜀𝑎,𝑡                                                                             (3.A.12) 
𝑙𝑡= 𝑛𝑡+ 𝑢𝑡                                                                               (3.A.13) 
Modified UIP condition:  
                             𝑖𝑡−𝑖𝑡
∗= (1 −𝜙𝑒)𝐸𝑡Δ𝑒𝑡+1 −𝜙𝑒Δ𝑒𝑡−𝜙𝑎𝑎𝑡+ 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡               (3.A.14) 
where 𝜙𝑒 governs how much the expected depreciation is allowed to affect the risk 
premium in the UIP condition;  𝛥𝑒𝑡= 𝜋𝑡−𝜋𝑡
∗+ ∆𝑞𝑡 and 𝑎𝑡 respectively denote the 
change in the nominal exchange rate and  net foreign asset; and 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡 represents the risk 
premium shock. The modified UIP condition (𝜙𝑒> 0) helps the model to reproduce the 
empirical evidence on delayed real exchange rate overshooting as the modification allows 
‘mechanical’ sources of endogenous persistence for the nominal exchange rate.  
Net foreign assets: 
 
𝑎𝑡=
1
𝛽𝑎𝑡−1 −𝛼(𝑠𝑡+ 𝜓𝐹,𝑡) + 𝑦𝑡−𝑐𝑡                                     (3.A.15) 
Domestic monetary policy rule: 
                           𝑖𝑡= 𝜌𝑅𝑖𝑡−1 + (1 −𝜌𝑅)(𝜒𝜋𝜋𝑡+ 𝜒𝑦𝑦𝑡+ 𝜒∆𝑦∆𝑦𝑡) + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡        (3.A.16) 
where 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 is a domestic monetary policy shock.

83 Since the foreign economy is very large, trade flows to and from the domestic economy are negligible 
compared to total foreign economic activity. This means that 𝛼∗ tends to zero. As a result, foreign 
consumption is given by 𝐶𝑡
∗= 𝐶𝐹,𝑡
∗, which implies that the foreign CPI is entirely determined by foreign 
goods price, 𝑃𝑡
∗= 𝑃𝐹,𝑡

3.C.2 Log-linear approximation to equilibrium conditions85  
Optimal wage setting: taking a log-linear approximation to equations (3.6) and (3.9) 
yields wage inflation equation. Log-linearization of the aggregate wage index (3.6)

In order to replace 𝑚𝑟𝑠𝑡+𝜏|𝑡 in equation (3.C.9), a log-linear approximation to 
𝑀𝑅𝑆𝑡+𝜏|𝑡= 𝑍𝑡+𝜏𝜀̃𝑙,𝑡+𝜏𝑁𝑡+𝜏|𝑡
𝜑
 has to be conducted as  
           𝑀𝑅𝑆(1 + 𝑚𝑟𝑠𝑡+𝜏|𝑡) = 𝑀𝑅𝑆+ 𝑀𝑅𝑆𝜀𝑙,𝑡+𝜏+ 𝑀𝑅𝑆𝑧𝑡+𝜏+ 𝑀𝑅𝑆𝜑𝑛𝑡+𝜏|𝑡 ⇒ 
           𝑚𝑟𝑠𝑡+𝜏|𝑡= 𝜀𝑙,𝑡+𝜏+ 𝑧𝑡+𝜏+ 𝜑𝑛𝑡+𝜏|𝑡, where 𝜀𝑙,𝑡+𝜏= log (𝜀̃𝑙,𝑡+𝜏𝜀̃𝑙
⁄ ). 
Using 𝑚𝑟𝑠𝑡+𝜏≡𝜀𝑙,𝑡+𝜏+ 𝑧𝑡+𝜏+ 𝜑𝑛𝑡+𝜏 (see Galí 2008, 2011 for detail), the following 
equation can be obtained: 
           𝑚𝑟𝑠𝑡+𝜏|𝑡= 𝑚𝑟𝑠𝑡+𝜏+ 𝜑(𝑛𝑡+𝜏|𝑡−𝑛𝑡+𝜏)                                                    (3.C.10) 
Linearizing the labour demand (3.7) yields    
            𝑛𝑡+𝜏|𝑡−𝑛𝑡+𝜏= −𝜁𝜔(𝑤′
𝑡−𝑤𝑡+𝜏+ 𝛿𝜔(𝑝𝑡+𝜏−1 −𝑝𝜏−1))                        (3.C.11) 
Combining equation (3.C.10) with equation (3.C.11) yields

𝑡−𝑤𝑡+𝜏+ 𝛿𝜔(𝑝𝑡+𝜏−1 −𝑝𝜏−1))               (3.C.12)

85 The log-linear approximation is used to transform the equilibrium conditions into a linear form. The log-
linearization transforms the domain with a log function, and then approximates with a linear function. By 
definition of the log-linearization, if ℝ→ℝ is differentiable, and 𝑥∗ is some point in ℝ, then the log-
linearization 𝑓̂ of 𝑓 around 𝑥∗ is 𝑓̂(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑋∗) + 𝑋∗𝑓′(𝑋∗)𝑥, where 𝑥= log𝑋−log𝑋∗.

Financial frictions and financial shocks

Abstract 
 
This chapter examines the importance of financial frictions and financial shocks in a 
small open economy DSGE model for explaining macroeconomic fluctuations. In 
doing so, a small open economy DSGE model with involuntary unemployment, 
financial frictions and financial shocks is developed. To quantify effects, the model 
is estimated using Bayesian methods on Australian and the US data. The main results 
are (i) the presence of financial accelerator and foreign debt improves the model fit, 
and (ii) financial shocks (i.e., credit supply and financial wealth shocks) are important 
for explaining investment and output fluctuations, (iii) including financial data in the 
analysis changes the model dynamics and influences the significance of the financial 
and marginal efficiency of investment (MEI) shocks, and (iv) the financial and 
country risk premium shocks have contributed significantly to Australian investment 
downturns in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009.

4.1 Introduction  
A long-standing tradition in macroeconomics, beginning with Fisher’s (1933) debt-
deflation interpretation of the Great Depression, gives a central role to financial factors 
in driving business cycle fluctuations86. The global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009 
has shown that the real-financial linkage is essential in explaining macroeconomic 
fluctuations and should not be abstracted from business cycle models for designing 
appropriate stabilization policy. On the other hand, the Modigliani-Miller (1958) theorem 
asserts that financial structure (i.e., corporation finances itself by debt or equity) is both 
intermediate and irrelevant to real economic outcomes. However, the canonical 
macroeconomic models, adopting the assumption of frictionless financial markets 
articulated by Modigliani-Miller (1958), have failed to account for the severity of the 
interaction between financial conditions and the real economy during the GFC. 
Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in assessing the importance of financial 
factors in business cycle fluctuations using dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) models featuring financial frictions and shocks.  
The present chapter investigates whether financial frictions and financial shocks are 
important in an estimated small open economy DSGE model87 for explaining 
macroeconomic fluctuations. The present chapter contributes to the existing literature by 
examining the following questions: (i) are financial frictions and foreign debt empirically 
relevant in an estimated small open economy model? (ii) do financial frictions play an 
important role in the transmission of non-financial shocks? and (iii) what are the 
quantitative effects of financial shocks on business cycle dynamics in Australia and the 
US? 
From the modelling point of view, the departure point is the model built in Chapter 3, 
which reformulates the Justiniano and Preston (2010a,b; henceforth J-P) model to allow 
for involuntary unemployment as suggested by Galí (2011) and Galí et al. (2011). In order 
to address the research questions, the model is further extended in three dimensions. First, 
the capital is incorporated into the model as a preliminary requirement for incorporating 
financial frictions. Second, financial frictions are incorporated into the model based on 
                                                           
86 Drawing on Fisher (1933), it can be argued that deteriorating credit market conditions (e.g., rising debt 
burdens and falling asset prices) are not a passive reflection of a weakening real economy, but are 
themselves a key source of economic contractions. 
87 The model consists of a small open economy (Australia) and a large economy (the US). However, the 
model is asymmetric in structure, implying that there is an only one way effect from the US to Australia.

the financial accelerator framework developed by Bernanke et al. (1999) (henceforth, 
BGG) that is in turn built on Bernanke and Gertler (1989)88, Bernanke et al. (1996) and 
Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997). In particular, the modelling of financial frictions assumes 
that domestic is entrepreneurs holds both domestic and foreign (or foreign currency 
denominated) debts and follows the framework used by Gertler et al. (2007), Christensen 
and Dib (2008), Gilchrist et al. (2009) and Christiano et al. (2008, 2010, 2014)89. Third, 
two financial shocks, directly affecting the financial sector (i.e., the credit spread or 
borrowers’ external financing cost), are introduced. Specifically, credit supply shock and 
financial wealth shock are included following the recent literature (e.g., Dib et al. 2008, 
Gilchrist et al. 2009 and Christiano et al. 2010).  
Three versions of the model are estimated using Bayesian methods for Australian and the 
US data over the period 1993:Q1-2013:Q4, covering the inflation-targeting period in 
Australia and the GFC. The main findings can be summarized as follows. First, the 
presence of financial frictions in the model substantially changes the model dynamics and 
improves the model fit in terms of the Bayes factor, suggesting that financial frictions are 
empirically relevant. Second, financial shocks (i.e., changes in the credit supply and/or in 
the equity market index) play a significant role in driving investment and output 
fluctuations in both countries. In the case of Australia, the financial shocks account for 
around 40 per cent of the variation in investment, a quarter of GDP and more than 90 per 
cent of the spread on the external finance and equity market index. Third, when the model 
with financial frictions is estimated to match financial data, shocks to demand of the 
capital market (i.e., financial shocks) is more important in explaining macroeconomic 
fluctuations compared to shocks to the supply of the market (i.e., the MEI shock). Fourth, 
the estimated model implies that the vast bulk of Australian investment downturns in 
2001-2002 are mainly explained by the country risk premium shock, while the sharp 
downturn in investment during the GFC is attributable to both financial and country risk 
premium shocks.  
The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 4.2 describes a small open 
economy model with financial frictions and shocks. Section 4.3 presents the model 
                                                           
88 Bernanke and Gertler (1989) originally formulated ideas of the credit-view (i.e., financial frictions) in a 
general equilibrium framework by assuming the costly state verification problem proposed by Townsend 
(1979) in which lenders must pay some monitoring cost to observe borrowers’ true payoff. 
89 Earlier papers incorporating financial frictions in general equilibrium models include, for example, those 
published by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), Christiano et al. (2003), Céspedes et al. (2004), Elekdag et al. 
(2006) and Meier and Müller (2006).

solution and estimation, consisting of the data and priors for parameters of the model. 
Section 4.4 discusses the importance of financial frictions and shocks in the model for 
explaining macroeconomic fluctuations. Finally, section 4.5 concludes that financial 
frictions and shocks play a pivotal role in explaining real economic activity, particularly, 
investment and output by looking through the empirical findings.   
4.2 The model  
4.2.1 The basic structure of the model  
The basic structure of the model is the model built in Chapter 3 that is, in turn, based on 
the J-P model90. The basic structure deviates from the J-P model in the following ways. 
First, the J-P model is reformulated to allow some imperfections in the labour market 
(i.e., introducing involuntary unemployment and wage setting process) following the 
papers published by Galí (2011) and Galí et al. (2011). Second, the foreign economy is 
specified as the closed economy version of the open economy model as assumed by 
Monacelli (2005). Third, as suggested by Adolfson et al. (2008) and Adolfson et al. 
(2013), the UIP condition is modified by allowing for a negative correlation between the 
country risk premium and the expected depreciation in the nominal exchange rate. Fourth, 
the cost channel of monetary policy (i.e., working capital channel) is incorporated as 
discussed by Christiano et al. (2011) assuming that the domestic firms must borrow 
working capital loans to pay for inputs (i.e., a friction of wage bills), whereas the retail 
firms borrow their imported goods loans from a foreign seller at the foreign currency 
interest rate. As assumed by Christiano et al. (2010), the working capital loans are 
frictionless, implying that there is no asymmetric information between borrower and 
lender, and no risk to lenders.    
The model assumes that only the accumulation and management of physical capital 
involves frictions. To this end, it is necessary to modify the setting of the above 
environment by incorporating the capital (produced by capital producers) as another 
factor input, and introducing entrepreneurs who purchase new, installed physical capital 
                                                           
90 The J-P model technically represents a semi-small open economy, where domestic producers have some 
market power. The specification of the model allows for incomplete asset markets, habit formation and 
indexation of prices to past inflation in a small open economy model, proposed by Monacelli (2005) and 
Galí and Monacelli (2005). The Justiniano and Preston (2010a) model assumes fully flexible wages and 
perfect competition in labour markets. However, Justiniano and Preston (2010b) incorporate staggered 
wage setting following Erceg et al. (2000) into Justiniano and Preston’s (2010a) model.

and rent out capital services to domestic producers. Consequently, the model consists of 
households, labour unions, firms (domestic producers and retailers), capital producers, 
entrepreneurs and policy makers (a monetary authority and a fiscal authority). Behaviours 
of households, labour unions, retail firms and a monetary authority are not affected by 
introducing financial frictions into the model. Thus, in what follows, the characteristics 
of capital producers, domestic goods producers, entrepreneurs and a fiscal authority are 
discussed, and the general equilibrium is defined.  
4.2.2 Introducing capital into the model  
4.2.2.1 Capital producers  
There is a continuum of perfectly competitive capital producers. At the end of period 𝑡, 
they purchase investment goods and install physical capital that has been used in period 
𝑡 from entrepreneurs. Capital producers use these inputs to produce new installed capital 
that can be used in period 𝑡+ 1, and sell the new capital to entrepreneurs.  
As discussed by Christiano et al. (2003, 2008), consistent with profit maximization and 
market clearing on the capital market, the total amount of capital purchased by capital 
producers must be equal to total undepreciated capital stock in the economy. Thus the 
economy-wide capital available for production evolves over time according to  
𝐾𝑡+1 = (1 −𝛿)𝐾𝑡+ 𝜀̃𝑖,𝑡(1 −𝜒(
𝐼𝑡
𝐼𝑡−1)) 𝐼𝑡                                                 (4.1) 
where 𝐼𝑡 denotes gross investment. As used by Christiano et al. (2005), the investment 
adjustment cost function 𝜒(∙) is an increasing and convex function with the following 
properties in steady state: 𝜒(1) = 𝜒′(1) = 0, and 𝜒′′(1) = 1 𝜅
⁄
> 0. And 𝜀̃𝑖,𝑡 denotes the 
marginal efficiency of investment (MEI) shock that affects how investment is 
transformed into capital. Justiniano et al. (2010, 2011) have emphasized the importance 
of the MEI shock in explaining business cycles. The optimization problem of a 
representative capital producer is to maximize the present discount value of future profits

and used) installed capital (Tobin’s Q), and  Λ𝑡+𝜏 denotes marginal utility of income91.

where 𝜀> 1 denotes the elasticity of substitution between types of differentiated 
domestic goods. The differentiated goods are produced by monopolistically competitive 
domestic firms, indexed by 𝑖∈[0,1].  Each firm 𝑖 produces a differentiated good using 
the following production technology: 
𝑌𝐻,𝑡(𝑖) = 𝜀̃𝑎,𝑡𝐾𝑡
𝑠(𝑖)Ω𝑁𝑡(𝑖)1−Ω                                                                       (4.5) 
where 𝜀̃𝑎,𝑡 represents technology shock, Ω determines the share of capital services in 
production, 𝐾𝑡
𝑠(𝑖) represents the capital service (i.e., effective utilization of the capital 
stock) given by 𝐾𝑡
𝑠(𝑖) = 𝑈𝑡𝐾𝑡, 𝑈𝑡 implies the degree of capital utilization, and 𝑁𝑡(𝑖) 
denotes the labour service.  
Firms are competitive in factor markets where they confront a nominal rental rate, 𝑃𝑡𝑅𝑡
𝑘, 
on capital services and a nominal wage rate, 𝑊𝑡, on labour services. As assumed by 
Christiano et al. (2010), each firm must finance a constant fraction, 𝜐𝑘, of its rental cost 
of capital, 𝑃𝑡𝑅𝑡
𝑘𝐾𝑡
𝑠(𝑖), and a constant fraction, 𝜐𝑛, of its wage bill, 𝑊𝑡𝑁𝑡(𝑖), in advance 
of production at a (one-period) nominal interest rate, 𝑅𝑡. Then, the cost minimization 
problem of a representative domestic producer implies  
                                                           
91 Households have the same marginal utility of income, Λ𝑡+𝜏= Λ𝐶,𝑡+𝜏𝑃𝑡+𝜏

4.2.3 Introducing financial frictions and financial shocks  
The behaviour of entrepreneurs is modelled in the form of a BGG financial accelerator 
mechanism. Specifically, this section closely follows the modelling framework of Gertler 
et al. (2007), Christensen and Dib (2008) and Gilchrist et al. (2009)92. In the framework, 
the financial frictions reflect the condition in which borrowers and lenders are different 
agents who have different information. Therefore, the model includes ‘entrepreneurs’ 
who own and manage the capital stock, financed both by internal and external (i.e., 
borrowed) funds. 
There is a large number of entrepreneurs in the economy. At the end of period 𝑡, each 
entrepreneur has a level of real net worth, 𝑁𝑊𝑡+1. The entrepreneurs combine their net 
worths with a nominal debt (e.g., taking bank loan or issuing bond), 𝐵𝑡+1, to purchase 
new, installed physical capital, 𝐾𝑡+1, from the capital producer. The real loan for this 
purpose is  
𝐵𝑡+1
𝑃𝑡= 𝑄𝑡𝐾𝑡+1 −𝑁𝑊𝑡+1                                                                                      (4.8) 
In the model, foreign-denominated debt is also considered regarding the literature on 
introducing BGG-type financial frictions into an open economy model (e.g., Céspedes et 
al. 2004, Elekdag et al. 2006, Gertler et al. 2007 and Dib et al. 2008). In particular, the 
model incorporates the co-existence of foreign and domestic currency debt in a small 
open economy as modelled by Anand et al. (2010) and Freystätter (2011). The presence 
of the foreign currency debt helps the model to capture the effects of exchange rate 
depreciation triggered by external shocks on the economy passing through the balance 
sheets of entrepreneurs.    
                                                           
92 Other papers employed the framework include, for example, Céspedes et al. (2004), Elekdag et al. (2006), 
Dib (2008, 2010a,b), Anand et al. (2010) and Freystätter (2010, 2011).

The constant fraction, 𝜛𝑑, of the borrowing, 𝐵𝑡+1
𝑑, is raised domestically (or in domestic 
currency), and (1 −𝜛𝑑) friction of the borrowing, 𝐵𝑡+1
𝑓, is raised from abroad (or in 
foreign currency). Therefore, the domestic currency and foreign currency denominated 
debts are respectively given by  
𝐵𝑡+1
𝑑
= 𝜛𝑑(𝑄𝑡𝐾𝑡+1 −𝑁𝑊𝑡+1)𝑃𝑡                                           (4.9)

𝑓
= (1 −𝜛𝑑)(𝑄𝑡𝐾𝑡+1 −𝑁𝑊𝑡+1)𝑃𝑡                               (4.10) 
After observing the period 𝑡+ 1 aggregate rates of capital return and prices, each 
entrepreneur determines the utilization rate of its effective capital, 𝑈𝑡+1, and then rents 
out capital services, 𝑈𝑡+1𝐾𝑡+1, in a competitive market. The nominal rental rate of capital 
services is denoted by 𝑅𝑡+1
𝑘
𝑃𝑡+1. In choosing the capital utilization rate, each entrepreneur 
takes into account the ‘user cost’ function, 𝑎(𝑈𝑡+1)𝐾𝑡+1𝑃𝑡+1, 𝑎′, 𝑎′′ > 093. Thus the 
entrepreneur chooses 𝑈𝑡+1 to maximize the rental profits 
                                    max
{𝑢𝑡+1}[𝑈𝑡+1𝑅𝑡+1
𝑘
−𝑎(𝑈𝑡+1)] 𝐾𝑡+1𝑃𝑡+1 
The first-order condition of the maximization gives  
𝑅𝑡+1
𝑘
= 𝑎′(𝑈𝑡+1)                                                                               (4.11) 
Equation (4.11) implies that as the rental rate increases, it becomes more profitable to use 
capital more intensively up to the point where extra gains match the extra output costs94.  
The entrepreneur’s demand for capital depends on the expected marginal return and the 
expected marginal financing cost. The expected marginal return to capital purchased in 
period 𝑡 (i.e., expected gross return to holding a unit of capital from 𝑡 to 𝑡+ 1), 
𝐸𝑡(1 + 𝑅𝑡+1
𝑒,𝑘), can be written95 as  
      𝐸𝑡(1 + 𝑅𝑡+1
𝑒,𝑘) =
𝐸𝑡[𝑈𝑡+1𝑅𝑡+1

93 Operating one unit of physical capital at rate 𝑈𝑡+1 requires 𝑎(𝑈𝑡+1) of investment goods for maintenance 
costs. The increasing and convex function 𝑎(∙) captures the idea that the capital utilization is costly.  
94 As discussed by Christiano (2010), the following steady-state conditions are assumed: 𝑈= 1, 𝑎(1) = 0, 
𝑎′′(𝑈) 𝑎′(𝑈)
⁄
= 𝜎𝑎≥0 is a parameter that controls the degree of convexity of the cost function.  
95 After determining the utilization rate of capital and earning rent (net of utilization costs), the entrepreneur 
sells the undepreciated fraction of its capital, (1 −𝛿)𝐾𝑡+1, at the real price, 𝑄𝑡+1 to capital producers. In 
this way, the total pay-off in period 𝑡+ 1 received by the entrepreneur, expressed in real term is 
[𝑈𝑡+1𝑅𝑡+1
𝑘
−𝑎(𝑈𝑡+1) + (1 −𝛿)𝑄𝑡+1]𝐾𝑡+1. This can be also expressed as (1 + 𝑅𝑡+1
𝑒,𝑘)𝑄𝑡𝐾𝑡+1 to measure 
gross return to capital purchased in period 𝑡 (the amount of 𝐾𝑡+1 at 𝑄𝑡 price).

The marginal cost of external funds to the entrepreneur depends on financial conditions.  
As assumed by BGG, there exists an agency problem (i.e., a costly state verification 
problem proposed by Townsend 1979). The lender must pay a monitoring cost to observe 
the borrower’s true payoff (i.e., the realized return on capital). Under this problem, a 
financial contract itself is an instrument that can be used to overcome the asymmetric 
information between lenders and borrowers. Therefore, the entrepreneur and the lender 
negotiate a financial contract that simultaneously satisfies (i) the requirement that the 
lender receive an expected return at the end of the contract equal to the opportunity cost 
of his or her fund; and (ii) maximization of the end-of-contract level of net worth for the 
entrepreneur. The expression and derivation of the optimal contract between 
entrepreneurs and lenders under asymmetric information triggered by the agency problem 
is well detailed in various papers (see BGG, Gertler et al. 2003 and Chiristiano et al. 2010, 
2014). The optimal contract under the agency problem suggests that external finance is 
more expensive than internal finance (using internally generated cash flows), owing to 
the costs of evaluating borrower’s prospects and monitoring their actions. Since the lender 
must receive a competitive return, it charges the borrower a premium to cover the 
monitoring cost (i.e., interpretable as a bankruptcy cost). The premium is the so-called 
external finance premium (EFP) that a borrower must pay.  
The financial contract overcomes the asymmetric information by making the terms of the 
debt dependent on the borrower’s financial position. Specifically, solving the optimal 
contract, BGG show that the EFP (or credit spread), 𝑆𝑡(∙), can be an increasing function 
of the borrower’s leverage ratio, 𝑄𝑡𝐾𝑡+1 𝑁𝑊𝑡+1
⁄
. Following recent papers (see Dib et al. 
2008, 2010a,b, Gilchrist et al. 2009 and Freystätter 2010, 2011), a shock to the EFP is 
also introduced. Thus the EFP is assumed to have the following functional form:   
                      𝑆𝑡(∙) = (
𝑄𝑡𝐾𝑡+1
𝑁𝑊𝑡+1)
𝜓
𝜀̃𝑐𝑠,𝑡                                                                (4.13) 
where the parameter, 𝜓> 0, measures the elasticity of the EFP with respect to the 
leverage. Changes in the credit spread may also reflect shifts in the effective supply of 
funds offered by financial intermediaries in the presence of financial market frictions 
(Gilchrist and Zakrajšek 2012). Thus, as assumed by Gilchrist et al. (2009), the credit 
supply shock, 𝜀̃𝑐𝑠,𝑡 (𝜀̃𝑐𝑠= 1 in the steady state), affects the EFP. The shock to the supply 
of credit, 𝜀̃𝑐𝑠,𝑡, captures changes in the efficiency of the financial intermediation process 
or changes in the financial sector that raise or lower the EFP beyond the level warranted 

142 
 
by current economic conditions (e.g., a deterioration in the capital position of financial 
intermediaries, leading to a reduction in the credit supply)96.        
By definition, the entrepreneur’s overall expected marginal cost of funds is the product 
of the EFP, 𝑆𝑡(∙), and the gross real opportunity cost of funds that is the cost of raising 
funds in the absence of capital market frictions, 𝐸𝑡𝑓𝑡+1. According to equations (4.9) and 
(4.10), the expected gross real opportunity cost of funds, 𝐸𝑡𝑓𝑡+1, is the weighted average 
of the expected costs for domestic currency debt, 𝐸𝑡𝑓𝑡+1
𝑑, and for foreign currency 
denominated debt, 𝐸𝑡𝑓𝑡+1

(4.15) shows the expected marginal financing cost. Equation (4.15) provides the 
foundation for the financial accelerator, in which endogenous changes in the credit market 
work to propagate and amplify shocks to the macroeconomy. This links the 
entrepreneur’s financial position to the marginal cost of funds and, hence, to the demand 
for capital. For example, changes in the price of capital, 𝑄𝑡, may have significant effects 
on the leverage ratio, 𝑄𝑡𝐾𝑡+1 𝑁𝑊𝑡+1
⁄
. In this way, the model also captures the relation 
                                                           
96 The reverse relationship between the EFP and the borrower’s net worth arises since, when the borrower 
can finance the greater share of capital by self-finance or finance with collateralized debt, lender’s risk (i.e., 
the expected bankruptcy costs for lenders) will be lower and hence, borrowers in good financial condition 
generally pay a lower EFP for external finance. Because borrowers’ net worth is pro-cyclical (e.g., due to 
the pro-cyclicity of profits and assets prices), the EFP will be countercyclical, promoting the swings in 
borrowing, and hence in investment, spending and production. 
97 For an entrepreneur who is not fully self-financed, it would be optimal when the expected return to capital 
in equilibrium equals the expected marginal financing cost. Let us assume, for example, that at margin, the 
entrepreneur considers acquiring a unit of capital financed by debt. However, the additional debt increases 
the leverage ratio, raising the EFP and the overall marginal cost of finance. Consequently, compared to the 
perfect capital markets, the demand for capital is lower.

between asset price movements and collateral in the theory of the credit cycle stressed by 
Kiyotaki and Moore (1997).  
After entrepreneurs have settled their debt to the lender in period 𝑡+ 1, and the capital 
has been re-sold to capital producers, entrepreneurs’ net worth in period 𝑡+ 1 is 
determined. At this point, entrepreneurs exit the economy with probability, 1 −𝛾𝑡+1, and 
survive to continue another period of activity with probability, 𝛾𝑡+1. Each period new 
entrepreneurs enter in sufficient numbers so that the population of entrepreneurs remains 
constant. New entrepreneurs entering in period 𝑡+ 1 receive a ‘start-up’ transfer of net 
worth, 𝑊𝑒. Since 𝑊𝑒 is relatively small, this exit and entry process helps to ensure that 
entrepreneurs do not accumulate enough net worth to escape the financial frictions. Let 
𝑉𝑡 be aggregate entrepreneurial equity (i.e., wealth/profits accumulated by entrepreneurs). 
Then the law of motion for aggregate net worth, 𝑁𝑊𝑡+1, is  
𝑁𝑊𝑡+1 = 𝛾𝑡𝑉𝑡+ 𝑊𝑒                                                                                      (4.16)

where  𝛾𝑡𝑉𝑡 denotes the equity held by entrepreneurs at period 𝑡−1 who are still in 
business at period 𝑡. The aggregate entrepreneurial equity, 𝑉𝑡, equals gross earnings of 
entrepreneurs who are active in period 𝑡 minus their total payments to lenders. In this 
expression, (1 + 𝑅𝑡
𝑒,𝑘) denotes the ex-post real return on capital, and the object in square 
brackets in equation (4.17) represents the ex-post cost of borrowing.  
According to equation (4.17), changes in net worth are propagated through three channels, 
each of which is economically distinctive. On the asset side, there is a genuine 
‘accelerator’ channel that alters net worth by changes in the flows of entrepreneurial 
earnings and by capital gains and losses on entrepreneurial assets. As discussed by Gertler 
et al. (2007), equations (4.16) and (4.17) suggest unpredictable variations in the asset 
price, 𝑄𝑡, play a key role in the financial accelerator since the variations provide the 
principle source of fluctuations in (1 + 𝑅𝑡
𝑒,𝑘) given by equation (4.12). For example, 
decline in asset prices (for example, due to negative demand shocks) deteriorates the 
borrowers’ balance sheet (i.e., decreases in net worth) leading to an increase in the EFP, 
and hence raise external financing cost. The increase in external financing cost, in turn, 

144 
 
reduces the demand for capital and leads to further cuts in investment and output. The 
resulting slowdown in economic activity causes asset prices to fall further and deepens 
the economic downturn. This is the financial accelerator channel highlighted by BGG, 
and it tends to amplify the economic effects of any shock that has a pro-cyclical impact 
on economic activity. On the liability side, changes in net worth are propagated through 
the ‘Fisher deflation channel’ highlighted by Fisher (1933) and the ‘foreign-currency 
denominated debt channel’ stressed by Aghion et al. (2000) and Céspedes et al. (2004). 
The ‘Fisher deflation’ channel implies that in the case of nominal debt contracts, negative 
surprises to the price level can alter the ex-post real burden of the debt that the borrower 
will have to bear when the contract will eventually mature. Therefore, unexpected 
deflation reduces entrepreneurial net worth. The ‘foreign-currency denominated debt 
channel’ implies that if debt is denominated in foreign currency units, the depreciation of 
the exchange rate trigged by external shocks decreases entrepreneurial net worth, thus 
enhancing the financial accelerator mechanism. As shown by Christiano et al. (2003, 
2010), ‘Fisher deflation’ and ‘accelerator’ channels reinforce each other when shocks 
move the price level and output in the same direction, but also tend to cancel each other 
in the case of shock, which moves the price level and output in opposite directions. Gertler 
et al. (2007) and Freystätter (2011) have shown that the ‘foreign currency denominated 
debt channel’ supports the ‘accelerator’ channel in the case of a country risk premium 
shock.  
According to equations (4.16) and (4.17), the value of entrepreneurs’ net worth at the end 
of period 𝑡 is hit by two financial shocks (i.e., two different sources of shock to the EFP) 
with different time structures. First, a shock to the survival probability (i.e., variations in 
the rate of destruction of total financial wealth of the economy), referred to as a financial 
wealth shock, 𝜀̃𝑓𝑤,𝑡 (i.e., 𝜀̃𝑓𝑤= 1 in the steady state), is introduced by assuming 𝛾𝑡=
𝛾𝜀̃𝑓𝑤,𝑡 as suggested by Christiano et al. (2003, 2008, 2010). This shock was originally 
introduced by Gilchrist and Leahy (2002) and captures changes in the entrepreneurial net 
wealth that are not linked to movements in fundamentals (e.g., driven by ‘irrational 
exuberance’ or asset price bubbles). Nolan and Thoenissen (2009) refer to the shock as a 
shock to the efficiency of contractual relations between borrowers and lenders. The 
financial wealth shock, 𝜀̃𝑓𝑤,𝑡, is realized at time 𝑡 and has a contemporaneous impact on 
net worth in period 𝑡, 𝑁𝑡+1, and therefore affects directly the creditworthiness of 
borrowers. Second, the credit supply shock, 𝜀̃𝑐𝑠,𝑡−1, raising directly the EFP at the period 
𝑡−1, reduces entrepreneurial net worth at the end of period 𝑡, 𝑁𝑡+1, by increasing 

145 
 
payments to lenders, per unit of currency borrowed. The exogenous changes in the EFP 
and entrepreneur net worth affect the economy passing through the financial accelerator 
mechanism (i.e., acting through entrepreneur’s balance sheets). Therefore, the financial 
shocks can be a source of macroeconomic fluctuations.   
Entrepreneurs who close business at period 𝑡 consume their remaining resources. Thus, 
the amount of the consumption composite consumed by exiting entrepreneurs, 𝐶𝑡
𝑒, is 
given by    
  𝐶𝑡
𝑒= (1 −𝛾)𝑉𝑡                                                                            (4.18) 
In this expression, (1 −𝛾𝑡)𝑉𝑡 denotes the total amount of equity that exiting 
entrepreneurs remove from the market.

denote 
the 
domestic and foreign demands for domestically produced goods as discussed in the J-P 
model. The third term corresponds to the consumption of the 1 −𝛾𝑡 entrepreneurs who 
exit the economy in period 𝑡. Government consumption, 𝐺𝑡, is determined exogenously 
and a government spending shock follows a stochastic process as modelled by Smets and 
Wouters (2003, 2007)98. The fifth term is the amount of final goods used in producing 𝐼𝑡 
investment goods. The last term on the left of equation (4.19) captures capital utilization 
costs. Note that modification in the aggregate resource constraint also changes the 
linearized dynamics of the net foreign asset in the J-P model. The modified equation of 
the net foreign asset is shown in Appendix 4.C.4.  
4.2.5 The foreign economy  
All foreign variables and parameters are denoted by superscript “*” in the log-linearized 
model. As assumed by Monacelli (2005) and Justiniano and Preston (2010b), the foreign 
economy is modelled as a closed version of the model in the open economy by assuming 
that the foreign economy is very large, and trade flows to and from the domestic economy

are negligible compared to total foreign economic activity. The fraction of the borrowing 
raised domestically, 𝜛𝑑∗, is equal to one in the foreign economy, and the remaining 
setting is the same as for the domestic economy. 
4.2.6 The log-linearized model and shock processes  
Key steady-state relations used to estimate the model are shown in Appendix 4.A.1. The 
log-linearized equations of the model are summarized in Appendix 4.A.2. The remaining 
equations, not discussed in sections 4.2.2-4.2.5, are similar to those discussed in the basic 
structure of the model. The domestic block is described by 26 equations in the unknowns 
{𝑦𝑡, 𝑛𝑡, 𝑐𝑡, 𝑖𝑡, 𝑞𝑡, 𝑘𝑡

𝑒,𝑘, 
 𝑠𝑡, 𝑛𝑤𝑡, 𝑐𝑡

When 
combined with processes for the exogenous disturbances and the definitions ∆𝑠𝑡= 𝑠𝑡−
𝑠𝑡−1 and ∆𝑞𝑡= 𝑞𝑡−𝑞𝑡−1, these relations constitute a linear rational expectations model 
driven by 22 disturbances, {𝜀𝑔,𝑡, 𝜀𝑎,𝑡, 𝜀𝑐,𝑡, 𝜀𝑖,𝑡, 𝜀𝑝𝑚ℎ,𝑡, 𝜀𝑝𝑚𝑓,𝑡, 𝜀𝑛,𝑡,𝜀𝜔,𝑡, 𝜀𝑟𝑝,𝑡, 𝜀𝑟,𝑡, 𝜀𝑐𝑠,𝑡, 𝜀𝑓𝑤,𝑡,

structural disturbances is assumed in line with those in the model estimated by Smets and 
Wouters (2007) and Gilchrist et al. (2009). For instance, the exogenous spending 
(𝜀𝑔,𝑡, 𝜀𝑔∗,𝑡) follows an AR(1) process and is also affected by the productivity shock 
(𝜀𝑎,𝑡, 𝜀𝑎∗,𝑡)100: 
 𝜀𝑔,𝑡= 𝜌𝑔𝜀𝑔,𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑔,𝑡+ 𝜌𝑔𝑎𝜖𝑎,𝑡                                                       (4.20) 
 𝜀𝑔∗,𝑡= 𝜌𝑔∗𝜀𝑔∗,𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑔∗,𝑡+ 𝜌𝑔𝑎∗𝜖𝑎∗,𝑡                                                (4.21) 
The price mark-up and wage mark-up disturbances (𝜀𝑥,𝑡, 𝑥= {𝑝𝑚ℎ, 𝑝𝑚𝑓, 𝜔, 𝑝𝑚∗, 𝜔∗}) 
are assumed to follow an ARMA(1,1) process101:  
 𝜀𝑥,𝑡= 𝜌𝑥𝜀𝑥,𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑥,𝑡−𝜇𝑥𝜖𝑥,𝑡−1,                                                    (4.22) 
The remaining structural disturbances (𝜀𝑦,𝑡, = {𝑎, 𝑐, 𝑖, 𝑛, 𝑟𝑝, 𝑟, 𝑐𝑠, 𝑓𝑤, 𝑎∗, 𝑐∗, 𝑖∗, 𝑛∗, 𝑟∗, 
𝑐𝑠∗, 𝑓𝑤∗}) are assumed to follow an independent AR(1) process  
                                                           
99 All 𝜀̃𝑥 shocks, except 𝜀̃𝑟𝑝 have unit means, while all 𝜀𝑥 disturbances have zero means.  
100 The inclusion of the productivity shock is motivated by the fact that, in the estimation, exogenous 
spending also includes net exports, which may be affected by domestic productivity developments.  
101 The presence of the moving average (MA) term is designed to capture the high-frequency fluctuations 
in inflation and wage inflation.

The model consists of log-linear equations and exogenous-driven forces. Using standard 
methods for solving the linear rational expectations model (e.g., Blanchard and Khan 
(1980) and Sims 2002), the model can be written in the following state-space form102  
                                       𝜉𝑡= 𝐹(𝜃)𝜉𝑡−1 + 𝐺(𝜃)𝜖𝑡,    𝜖𝑡~ 𝑁𝐼𝐷(0, 𝐼)                      (4.25)

are not i.i.d. (𝜀𝑔,𝑡, 𝜀𝑔∗,𝑡, 𝜀𝑥,𝑡, 𝜀𝑦,𝑡); 𝜖𝑡 is the vector of structural i.i.d. innovations distributed 
(0, 𝐼) { 𝜖𝑔,𝑡, 𝜖𝑔∗,𝑡, 𝜖𝑥,𝑡, 𝜖𝑦,𝑡, }; and 𝑌𝑡 denotes the vector of control variables (observables). 
The matrices 𝐹(𝜃), 𝐺(𝜃) and 𝐻(𝜃) denote complicated nonlinear functions of the 
structural parameters of the model, implied by the vector 𝜃.  
For model evaluation purposes, three variants of the model are estimated. The model 
detailed in Sections 4.2.1-4.2.4 and estimated using all financial variables (AFV) is called 
the ‘baseline model with AFV’. The same model, but estimated by dropping all financial 
variables (DAFV)103, is called the ‘baseline model with DAFV’. Those are richer models 
in the sense that they have similar features to the model estimated by Christiano et al. 
(2011) and Galí et al. (2011), but with the addition of financial frictions and financial 
shocks in an open economy setting. Following Christiano et al. (2010, 2014), a simpler 
version of the model, called the ‘simple model’, is also estimated. This model is obtained

from the baseline specification by assuming that there are no financial frictions and 
shocks. It is derived by assuming (i) no feedback from financial conditions to the real 
economy and no financial shocks, implied by (i) 𝑆𝑡(∙) = 1 because of 𝜓= 0 and the 
absence of shocks to 𝜀̃𝑐𝑠,𝑡, and (ii) dropping equations (4.8)-(4.10) and (4.16)-(4.18). 
Accordingly, equation (4.15) implies that all real interest rates in the economy with no 
financial frictions are equal to risk-free real interest rates and changes to (1 +
𝑅𝑡+1) 𝑃𝑡𝑃𝑡+1
⁄
= (1 + 𝑅𝑡+1
𝑒,𝑘)104. The specification of the simple model is therefore closer 
to the standard medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE models (e.g., Smets and Wouters 
2003, 2007, Christiano et al. 2005, Adolfson et al. 2008).  
4.3.2 Data  
The model is estimated using the US (foreign economy) and Australian (domestic 
economy) data over the period 1993:Q1-2013:Q4. The estimation period covers the 
inflation-targeting period in Australia and includes the recent GFC. The details of the 
observed data are given in Appendix 4.B.1. The US observables include eight variables 
that are standard in the empirical analysis of aggregate data: real non-farm GDP, real 
consumption, real investment, employment, the federal funds rate, unemployment rate, 
inflation (computed as quarterly percentage changes in the GDP implicit price deflator), 
and wage inflation (measured as quarterly percentage changes in non-farm compensation 
per employee). In addition, to quantify the strength of financial frictions and to properly 
identify financial shocks, two US financial variables are also observed. As used by 
Christiano et al. (2014), real entrepreneurial net worth in period 𝑡, 𝑁𝑊𝑡+1
∗ is approximated 
by the ratio of the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index to the GDP implicit price deflator. The 
EFP is measured by the spread between the yield on seasoned BAA-rated long-term 
corporate bonds and the yield on the constant maturity ten-year Treasury notes105.  
Australian data includes 10 standard variables: real non-farm GDP, real consumption, 
real investment, employment, quarterly inflation106, cash rate, unemployment rate and, 
terms of trade, G7 GDP-weighted real exchange rate and wage inflation calculated as 
                                                           
104 The modification changes the real return on capital defined in (4.12) into the standard equality condition 
commonly used in the literature: 𝐸𝑡[(1 + 𝑅𝑡+1) 𝑃𝑡𝑃𝑡+1
⁄
] = 𝐸𝑡[𝑈𝑡+1𝑅𝑡+1
𝑘
−𝑎(𝑈𝑡+1) + (1 −𝛿)𝑄𝑡+1] 𝑄𝑡
⁄
. 
In addition, the aggregate resource constraint is changed as 𝐶𝐻,𝑡+ 𝐶𝐻,𝑡
∗
+ 𝐺𝑡+ 𝐼𝑡+ 𝑎(𝑈𝑡)𝐾𝑡−1 = 𝑌𝑡.  
105 Christiano et al. (2014) note that replacing the BAA corporate bond spread by the spread measure 
constructed by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) gives similar results.   
106 As there is no reliable data for non-farm inflation, seasonally adjusted inflation based on consumer price 
index-all groups excluding interest and tax changes of 1999–2000 is used. As interest rate effect is excluded, 
the measure helps to appropriately estimate the cost channel effects. 

149 
 
quarterly percentage changes in average non-farm compensation per employee. 
Moreover, Australian two-financial variables are observed. The All Ordinaries Index107 
divided by the GDP implicit price deflator is used as a proxy for real entrepreneurial net 
worth in period 𝑡, 𝑁𝑊𝑡+1. Following Christiano et al. (2010), the EFP is measured as the 
weighted average of the non-financial corporate ten-year BBB-rated bond yield spread 
and the spread between the large business lending rate and the cash rate108. Prior to 
empirical analysis, the data is transformed as follows109: logarithm is taken from all real 
variables and employment, and then the resulting variables are linearly de-trended. Real 
exchange rate and terms of trade are first log-differenced (scaled by 100) and then 
demeaned. The unemployment rate is de-trended, and all remaining series are demeaned 
separately. The de-trending and de-meaning ensure that the resulting variables used in the 
estimation are stationary as they represent the business cycle-related part of the original 
variable. The data used in empirical analysis is detailed in Figure 4.B.1 in Appendix 4.B. 
4.3.3 Bayesian inference and priors  
Structural parameters of the model, 𝜃, are estimated using Bayesian methods. The 
advantage of Bayesian methods to estimate and evaluate DSGE models has been 
discussed in several papers (e.g., Lubik and Schorfheide 2006, An and Schorfheide 2007, 
and Del Negro and Schorfheide 2011). Nowadays, it is accepted that Bayesian estimation 
is well-suited to dealing with the problem of potential model misspecification and lack of 
identification. Another advantage of Bayesian estimation over its alternatives (Maximum 
likelihood or GMM) is that the posterior distribution of the parameters incorporates all of 
the uncertainty surrounding the model’s parameters and the model specification110. In 
Bayesian inference, a prior distribution, 𝑝(𝜃), is updated by sample information 
contained in the likelihood function, 𝐿(𝑌|𝜃), to form a posterior distribution of 
parameters given the data, ℒ(𝜃|𝑌). Specifically, the posterior likelihood function, 
ℒ(𝜃|𝑌), is proportional to the product, 𝐿(𝑌|𝜃) 𝑝(𝜃). This formulation supplies the basis 
                                                           
107 The All Ordinaries Index is Australia's premier market indicator. The index represents the 500 largest 
companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).   
108 From 2005 onwards, the EFP is computed as the weighted average of the spreads, and the series is 
backcasted by the large business lending rate spread. Construction of the bond yield spread data is detailed 
by Arsov et al. (2013).   
109 The officially published real exchange rate and the terms of trade are the inverse of same variables in 
the model, so the observables are converted into the model definition. Interest rates are expressed in 
quarterly terms. 
110 There is also a clear advantage when it comes to model comparisons since the models are not required 
to be nested and numerical methods for the computation of the marginal likelihood permit constructing 
posterior model probabilities.  

150 
 
of Bayesian estimation. The state-space solutions of the model, presented in equations 
(4.25) and (4.26), are used to evaluate the likelihood function (𝐿(𝑌|𝜃)) performed by the 
Kalman filter. Techniques used in the Bayesian estimation such as Random Walk 
Metropolis (RWM) and Kalman filter algorithms are detailed by An and Shorfheide 
(2007) and Guerrón-Quintana and Nason (2012).  
The Bayes factor is employed to evaluate the relative fit of the models. Let ℳ𝑖 be a given 
model, with ℳ𝑖∈𝑀 and 𝑝𝑖(𝜃|ℳ𝑖) denoting the prior density for model ℳ𝑖.  The 
marginal likelihood for a given model ℳ𝑖 and data 𝑌 is  
𝐿(𝑌|ℳ𝑖) = ∫𝐿(𝑌|𝜃, ℳ𝑖)𝑝𝑖(𝜃|ℳ𝑖)𝑑𝜃
𝜃
 
where 𝐿(𝑌|ℳ𝑖) and 𝐿( 𝑌|𝜃, ℳ𝑖) respectively denote the marginal data density and the 
likelihood function for the data 𝑌 conditional on the parameter and the model. Then the 
Bayes factor of model ℳ𝑖 versus model ℳ𝑗 is computed as  
ℬℱ𝑖,𝑗|𝑌= 𝐿(𝑌|ℳ𝑖) 𝐿(𝑌|ℳ𝑗)
⁄
                                              (4.27) 
Christopher Sims’s ‘csminwel’ optimization routine is used to obtain the posterior mode 
and to compute the Hessian matrix at the mode. To test the presence of the identification 
problem, over 50 optimization runs are launched, and the different optimization routine 
always converges to the same mode value. Since a unique mode for the model is obtained, 
the Hessian from the optimization routine is used as a proposal density, properly scaled 
(i.e., using c = 0.15) to attain an acceptance rate between 20-30 per cent. For the RWM 
results, two independent chains of 500,000 draws are generated, where the initial 200,000 
draws are discarded. Convergence of the chains is monitored using both the univariate 
and the multivariate convergence diagnostics variants of Brooks and Gelman (1998). 
In what follows, the specifications of priors are discussed. Priors for the model parameters 
consist of two sets. The first set includes a small number of parameters that are fixed by 
commonly used values in the literature. Australian and US discount factors, 𝛽 and 𝛽∗, are 
respectively set to equal to 0.9938 and 0.9973, which are consistent with the average of 
real interest rates over the estimation sample. The parameter governing openness, 𝛼, is 
set at 0.2, consistent with average share of imports in consumption basket (Jääskelä and 
Nimark 2011) and share of imports in GDP (Kuttner and Robinson 2010). The spending-
GDP ratio for the US, 𝑔𝑦∗, is fixed at 0.18 following Smets and Wouters (2007) and 
Fornarim amd Quadrini (2012). The spending-GDP ratio for Australia, 𝑔𝑦, is set at 0.225 

151 
 
per cent, which corresponds to the average value of the ratio of general government 
expenditure (i.e., sum of final consumption expenditure and public gross fixed capital 
formation) to GDP in the sample period. Capital depreciation rate for both countries, 𝛿 
and 𝛿∗, is assigned to the commonly used value of 0.025 (on a quarterly basis). Following 
Bernanke at al. (1999), Chistensen and Dib (2008) and Christiano et al. (2011), the 
entrepreneurial survival probabilities, 𝛾 and 𝛾∗, are set to 0.9728, implying an expected 
working life for entrepreneurs of 36 years. Finally, the entrepreneurs’ share of 
consumption for both countries, 𝑐𝑦
𝑒 and 𝑐𝑦
𝑒∗, is set at 0.01 as calibrated by Gilchrist et al. 
(2009).  
The second set of parameters (55 Australian and 44 US economy parameters) to be 
estimated and their prior assumptions are listed in the first panel of Table 4.1. Priors for 
both Australia and the US parameters, unrelated to the financial frictions are selected 
fairly consistent with those used in previous papers (e.g., Smets and Wouters 2007, 
Justiniano and Preston 2010a,b, Robinson 2013 and Galí et al. 2011). Priors for the 
parameters governing financial frictions are selected as follows: Following Dib et al. 
(2008) and Gilchrist et al. (2009), the prior for the elasticity of the EFP with respect to 
the leverage ratio, 𝜓 and 𝜓∗, is described by a Beta distribution with mean 0.05 and 
standard error 0.0125. As used by Elekdag et al. (2006), the prior for the steady-state ratio 
of capital to net worth for both countries (𝐾𝑁𝑊
⁄
 and 𝐾∗𝑁𝑊∗
⁄
) is set by a Gamma 
distribution with mean 2 and standard error 0.3, consistent with the calibrated values by 
Christensen and Dib (2008) (2.0) and Gilchrist et al. (2009) (1.7). The prior for the share 
of the domestic debt in the total debt of entrepreneurs, 𝜛𝑑, is chosen as a Beta distribution 
with mean 0.6111 and standard error 0.1. For all standard deviations of innovations, 
inverse-gamma distributions are used. Prior variances of the shocks are chosen as fairly 
diffuse. 
 
 
                                                           
111 The mean value is consistent with the share of gross external debt in private sector in the total private 
debt (as of 2014), which is computed using the table on overview of Australian debts shown by Soos and 
Egan (2014).

4.3.4 Posterior estimates of the parameters  
The last three panels in Table 4.1 report the posterior estimates of parameters from the 
three variants of the model. The panel marked baseline model with AFV reports the mean 
and the 90 per cent probability interval of the posterior distribution of the baseline model 
when all financial variables (AFV) is included in the estimation as observables. However, 
the panel marked baseline model with DAFV reports the posterior parameters of the 
baseline model when observed financial variables are dropped from the estimation. The 
panel marked simple model reports the posterior parameters of the simple model 
discussed in Section 4.3.1. For the simple model, the dataset is same as the data used in 
the estimation of the baseline model with DAFV.  
Most estimated parameters, unrelated to the financial frictions, are quite similar across 
the three models and are in line with previous estimated DSGE models for the US and 
Australia. For this reason and given the focus of this chapter, only selected parameters 
regarding financial frictions and shocks are discussed here. As explained by Del Negro et 
al. (2015), the model with financial friction and financial data yields higher estimates of 
the price rigidity and indexation parameters. The elasticity of the EFP, 𝜓 and 𝜓∗, are 
estimated away from zero in both baseline models with and without financial data. In the 
case of the baseline model with DAFV, the estimated parameters, 𝜓= 0.037 and 𝜓∗=
0.042, are closer to the values obtained by Elekdag et al. (2006), Christensen and Dib 
(2008) and Gilchrist et al. (2009). The results suggest that the financial accelerator is 
operative in both countries, implying the feedback between the financial and real sectors 
through entrepreneurial balance sheets. The higher elasticity in the US compared to 
Australia may imply that the financial accelerator is quantitatively more important in the 
US. The relatively lower estimates of the EFP in the case of baseline model with AFV, 
𝜓= 0.01 and 𝜓∗= 0.011, reflect the nature of observed financial data.  
Other interesting estimates are the capital-net worth ratios, 𝐾𝑁𝑊
⁄
 and 𝐾∗𝑁𝑊∗
⁄
. In 
Australia, the parameter is very sensitive to whether the financial data is included or not 
in the estimation. For instance, 𝐾𝑁𝑊
⁄
 is estimated as 1.85 and 1.46 in the model with 
AFV and the model with DAFV, respectively, implying that 46 per cent and 32 per cent 
of entrepreneurs’ capital expenditure is financed by debts. The parameter, 𝐾∗𝑁𝑊∗
⁄
 is 
estimated closer to 2, which is the commonly calibrated value in the literature. The 
parameter, 𝜛𝑑, governing how the aggregate balance sheet of entrepreneurs is vulnerable 

155 
 
to changes in exchange rate and foreign variables, is estimated as 0.54, with 10th and 90th 
percentiles of 0.39 and 0.69, respectively in the baseline model with AFV. The result 
shows that at least 40 per cent of the total debt of entrepreneurs is vulnerable to the 
external shocks. In the model with DAFM, the posterior of the parameter does not change 
from its prior. Those results imply that using the financial data in the estimation is 
informative for the parameter.  
The estimates of 𝜌𝑐𝑠and 𝜌𝑐𝑠
∗ indicate that credit supply shocks are more persistent in both 
Australia and the US. In particular, it is the case when financial variables are used in the 
estimation as observables. However, financial wealth shocks are less persistent compared 
to all other shocks. The financial wealth shocks measured by 𝜎𝑓𝑤 and 𝜎𝑓𝑤
∗ are more 
volatile, whereas credit supply shocks are less volatile in both countries when the 
financial data is observed. Two simple measures are analysed to access whether the 
baseline model properly identifies unobserved financial variables and shocks when 
financial data is not used in the empirical analysis. First, the estimated mean spread on 
external finance, 𝑆𝑡, is 1.41 per cent for Australia and 2.77 per cent for the US, 
respectively implying an annualized premium of 5.6 per cent and 11.1 per cent. The 
model-implied premiums are quite high compared to the directly observed proxy values. 
Second, the correlation between the spread generated by the model with DAFV and the 
observed proxy of it (discussed in Section 4.3.2) over the sample period is 0.19 for 
Australia and 0.86 for the US. These results suggest that it is difficult to identify financial 
variables and shocks without observing financial data.   
Though most estimates of the remaining parameters are quite robust across the different 
models, there are a few exceptions. For instance, estimates of the parameters governing 
the response of monetary policy to the inflation, 𝜒𝜋 and 𝜒𝜋
∗, fall when the financial data 
is observed in the estimation. For the US economy, the MEI shock, 𝜎𝑖
∗, is estimated less 
volatile in the model with DAFV compared to the other models. Moreover, estimates of 
the consumption preference and MEI shocks in Australia are higher in the model with 
AFV.  
4.3.5 The model fit and comparison  
To evaluate how the baseline model with AFV fits the data, a set of statistics implied by 
the model (i.e., in-sample fit and absolute fit) is compared to those measured in the data. 
Figure 4.B.1 in Appendix 4.B shows the actual data and the one-sided fit (one step-ahead 

156 
 
prediction) of the baseline model with AFV to assess the model’s forecasting 
performance. For most of the observed variables, the in-sample fit is good. The exceptions 
are inflation in Australia and wage inflations in both countries. These variables are quite 
volatile at a quarterly frequency and difficult to predict as discussed by Jääskelä and 
Nimark (2011) for Australia and by Justiniano et al. (2013) for the US. However, the 
model reasonably explains the general movement of CPI and wage inflations.   
To investigate whether the presence of foreign-currency denominated debt and the 
financial accelerator in the model improves the overall fit of the model, Table 4.2 presents

Notes: The table reports Bayes factor comparing ℳ0 to ℳ1, and ℳ2 to ℳ3 and ℳ4. The log marginal data 
densities reported here is computed from the posterior draws using the modified harmonic mean 
approximation, described in Geweke (1999).  
First, the models with and without foreign-currency denominated debt are compared to 
explore the importance of the foreign-currency denominated debt assumption in the 
model. In the case of observed financial variables, ℳ0 is compared with ℳ1 model, and 
in the case of dropping financial data, ℳ2 is compared with ℳ3. The results in the first 
four rows of Table 4.2 clearly show that the model fit improves when the foreign-currency 
denominated debt is introduced in the model. For instance, the Bayes factor between ℳ2 
model and ℳ3 model (ℬℱ2,3|𝑌) is 928.4, implying ‘very strong’ evidence in favour of 
the significance of the foreign-currency denominated debt assumption, according to Kass 
and Raftery (1995)112. When comparing the models with and without financial frictions, 
the Bayes factor of the baseline model with financial frictions against the simple model 
is ℬℱ2,4|𝑌= 24587.7, suggesting that financial frictions are empirically relevant. The 
                                                           
112 According to their scale of evidence, a Bayes factor between 1 and 3 is ‘not worth more than a bare 
mention’, between 3 and 20 suggests a ‘positive’ evidence, between 20 and 150 suggests a ‘strong’ 
evidence, and larger than 150 ‘very strong’ evidence in favour of one of the two models.

(2009) and Villa (2013), estimating the model with BGG-type financial friction for the 
closed economy (the US and the Euro area), in the case of a small open economy model 
with financial frictions.

Notes: The table presents the mean of the posterior distribution of the statistics implied by the estimated 
model are reported. #in the correlation, AU output is used for Australian observables, whereas US output 
is used for the US observables.  
For the models, the mean of the posterior distribution is reported. The models generally 
overpredict the volatility of the aggregate variables, which is a common problem in the 
literature on the estimated DSGE models (e.g., Christensen and Dib 2008 and Queijo von 
Heideken 2009)113. Though all moments are not replicated well by the models, the 
presence of financial frictions helps in fitting some moments of the variables.  
                                                           
113 As discussed by Justiniano et al. (2011), a likelihood-based estimator tries to match the entire auto-
covariance function of the data and hence must strike a balance between matching all the second moments, 
and therefore the estimated model does not capture standard deviation and autocorrelation perfectly.

4.4 The importance of financial frictions and financial shocks  
4.4.1 Impulse responses  
This section aims to answer two questions, namely (i) what are effects of financial shocks 
on the macroeconomy? and (ii) what is the role of financial frictions in the transmission 
of non-financial shocks?  
4.4.1.1 Responses to financial shocks 
Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2 present impulse responses of the estimated baseline models to 
adverse credit supply shocks in Australia and the US, respectively. The adverse shock 
potentially leads a domestic recession in both economies. For instance, the higher spread 
on the external finance, triggered by the adverse shock, deteriorates the entrepreneurs’ 
balance sheet and accordingly reduces the demand for capital. As a result, the adverse 
shocks result in a persistent reduction in investment and output in both countries. 
According to the baseline model with AFV, in the case of Australia, a one-standard 
deviation credit supply shock leads an increase of about 20 basis points in the spread on 
external finance, which declines the level of output by 4-10 basis points and the level of 
investment by about 75 basis points relative to the steady state.  
However, in the case of the US economy, a same sized rise in EPF (20 basis points) causes 
3 times higher impacts on output and investment than those estimated in Australia, which 
is in line with findings shown by Gilchrist et al. (2009). The response of both output and 
investment is hump-shaped, with the peak in the response of investment occurring 4-5 
quarters for Australia, and 7-8 quarters for the US after the impact of the shock. The weak 
domestic demand leads to a reduction in both inflation and interest rate. As explained and 
shown by Barnett and Thomas (2014) for the United Kingdom, a contraction in credit 
supply also leads to real exchange rate depreciation in Australia. The exogenous rise in 
the spread on external finance immediately reduces employment.  
Those results, suggesting a contraction in the credit supply have significant adverse 
consequences for the macroeconomy, are consistent with the VAR-based results shown 
by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) for the US and Jacobs and Rayner (2012) for Australia. 
Moreover, the spillover of the US credit supply shock to Australian economy is 
immediate and not negligible as emphasized by Haddow and Mileva (2013). Movements 
in the real exchange rate and terms of trade are key channels for the propagation of the 

159 
 
shock to the Australian economy. Another interesting result is that when financial data is 
included in the analysis, the impulse responses become more hump-shaped and the peak 
effect of the shock is delayed.

In response to the adverse financial wealth shock, the entrepreneurial net worth drops 
immediately and hence the spread on external finance increases as shown by Christiano 
et al. (2014). The higher EFP reduces the demand for capital and thereby leads to 
decreases in investment and output. As highlighted by Christiano et al. (2011), the 
responses to the shock have some characteristics of a classic demand shock: an adverse 
wealth shock leads to a reduction in CPI inflation, investment, output and employment in 
both Australia and the US. According to the baseline model with AFV, a one-standard 
deviation financial wealth shock has a substantial impact on investment at the one-to-
three year horizon in both countries. As found by Jacobs and Rayner (2012) for Australia 
and by Christiano et al. (2011) for Sweden, the adverse shock leads to the depreciation of 
the real exchange rate.  
4.4.1.2 Responses to non-financial shocks 
In this section, impulse responses to non-financial shocks are discussed to study the role 
of financial sector in propagating shocks, originating in the other sector of the economy. 
In the case of Australia, about 40 per cent of private debt was borrowed from abroad, 
which raises a question about the impact of exchange rate depreciation on the 
macroeconomy passing through the foreign-currency denominated debt channel. The 
response of the estimated models to a country risk premium shock is presented in Figure 
4.B.2 in Appendix 4.B. 
 
The foreign-currency denominated debt channel is operative in Australia, consistent with 
findings of the 2009 and 2013 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) surveys on foreign 
currency exposure (FCE) of non-financial corporations discussed by Rush et al. (2013)114. 
According to the baseline models, a positive country risk premium shock leads to a 
depreciation of real exchange rate, which immediately reduces the entrepreneurial net 
worth through raising the cost of existing debt. Hence the shock raises the spread on 
external finance. The rise in EFP enhances the financial accelerator mechanism in the 
model. As a result, the presence of financial frictions and foreign-currency denominated 
debt stimulates the response of investment to the shock. This result highlights the 
                                                           
114The FCE survey indicates that non-financial sector’s foreign currency liabilities has risen in recent years, 
reflecting an increase in borrowings in foreign debt markets by larger corporations (particularly in the 
mining sector). In addition, around one-third of non-financial corporations’ aggregate foreign currency 
liability exposures were hedged using derivatives (Rush et al. 2013, p.55).  

162 
 
importance of foreign-currency denominated debt in the estimated open economy model 
as discussed by Gertler et al. (2007) and Freystätter (2011).  
For the purpose of evaluating the impact of the financial frictions on the responses, non-
financial shocks are chosen based on the criteria that the size of the chosen shock should 
be equal in three models. From Table 4.1, it is clear that standard deviation of monetary 
policy, technology and labour supply shocks in the three estimated models are very closer 
to each other in both Australia and the US. In addition, the sizes of the US MEI shock in 
the baseline model with AFV and in the simple model are closer to each other.  
Therefore, responses of the three estimated models to these four shocks in both Australia 
and the US are plotted in Figures 4.B.2-4.B.11 of the Appendix 4.B. In general, the 
presence of the financial accelerator in the estimated models significantly affects the 
response of investment and consumption. There is evidence that the presence of the 
financial accelerator amplifies the effects of monetary policy shocks on investment, 
output and employment, but dampens those of technology and labour supply shocks in 
both Australia and the US when financial data is not observed. This result is consistent 
with the findings stressed by Iacoviello (2005), noticing that the presence of the financial 
accelerator features an accelerator of demand shocks and a ‘decelerator’ of supply shocks. 
However, the results also show that the presence of the financial accelerator dampens the 
responses of investment and output to the MEI shock for both countries. The decelerator 
effect of the MEI shock is also found by Christense and Dib (2008). In addition, the 
impulse responses of the estimated models with financial frictions depend on whether 
financial data are included in the analysis.  
In the presence of financial frictions, monetary policy affects the economy through an 
additional ‘balance sheet channel’115. Figure 4.B.3 and Figure 4.B.4 in the Appendix 4.B 
present responses to an unanticipated monetary policy tightening shock in Australia and 
the US, respectively. The results suggest that the balance sheet channel of monetary 
policy transmission is operative in both countries. The result is in line with the empirical 
evidence provided in data-driven VAR model (i.e., Jacobs and Rayner 2012) for 
Australia. According to the baseline models, in response to a temporary rise in the interest 
                                                           
115 The balance sheet channel is one component of the credit channel of monetary policy highlighted by 
Bernanke and Gertler (1995). According to the channel, a tightening of monetary policy reduces the 
creditworthiness of borrowers (i.e., by reducing both asset values and cash flows) which increases the EFP 
and thus intensifies the effect of the policy action.

rate, entrepreneurial net worth is reduced due to the lower capital price and deflation116. 
Owing to the deterioration in the strength of entrepreneurs’ balance sheets, the spread on 
external finance increases, which amplifies the initial policy tightening through further 
reinforcing the contraction in capital and investment. As a result, the monetary policy 
shock causes hump-shaped reduction in output, consumption, investment, employment 
and CPI inflation. Comparing across models, the responses of aggregate variables in the 
baseline models are stronger than those in the simple model and persist for longer. The 
results are in line with the findings obtained by Christensen and Dib (2008) and Christiano 
et al. (2011). It is also apparent that the responses of the baseline models, particularly for 
real variables, depends on whether financial data is included in the estimation. Comparing 
across countries (Australia and the US), the financial accelerator mechanism is more 
evident in the US, as the response of investment shows more amplification and 
persistence. Monetary policy tightening in the US economy also leads to a reduction in 
Australian consumption and investment. However, a depreciation of the real exchange 
rate, driven by the rise in the interest rate differential, increases output and inflation in 
Australia. This result is robust to the models with and without financial frictions. 
Moreover, the present results support the policy implication highlighted by Fornari and 
Stracca (2013) that monetary policy can be well placed to fight financial shocks since 
responses of macro aggregates to loosening policy shock are found to be the mirror image 
of the responses to adverse financial shocks.  
Figure 4.B.5 and Figure 4.B.6 in Appendix 4.B show responses of the estimated models 
to MEI shocks in Australia and the US, respectively. The investment shock is a positive 
shock to the marginal efficiency with which the final good can be transformed into 
physical capital. Therefore, in response to a positive MEI shock, the price of capital falls 
as a result of higher supply of capital. The change in the price of capital has two effects: 
(i) investment increases and (ii) entrepreneurial net worth decreases due to the lower 
return on capital. The latter effect leads to a rise in the spread on external finance. The 
rising spread leads to higher cost of funding investment purchases, which dampens the 
rise of investment. However, the first effect initially dominates, so that investment, 
output, hours, inflation and interest rate increase before backing off gradually to the 
steady state gradually. As shown by Christensen and Dib (2008), the presence of financial 
frictions, therefore, weakens the increase in investment and output. Another interesting 
                                                           
116 In Australia, the foreign-currency denominated debt mechanism operates in rising net worth because of 
the real exchange rate appreciation, and its strength is negligible compared to other two mechanisms. 

164 
 
result is that the presence of financial frictions allows the model to produce similar shapes 
of responses for consumption with those obtained by Justiniano et al. (2010, 2011).   
Figure 4.B.7 and Figure 4.B.8 in Appendix 4.B show responses of the estimated models 
to positive technology shocks in Australia and the US, respectively. The shock has a direct 
impact on output by making factors more productive, and leads to a decrease in inflation 
owing to the increase in aggregate supply. In response to the fall in inflation, interest rate 
decreases immediately according to the Taylor rule. Consumption and investment 
increase persistently because of lower interest rate and the rise in output. However, 
unemployment increases temporarily due to the fall in employment. In the baseline 
models, the fall in inflation also creates the Fisher deflation effect (i.e., increasing the real 
cost of repaying debt), which reduces entrepreneurial net worth. The decline in net worth 
raises the spread on external finance, dampening the rise in the demand for capital. As a 
result, as shown by Villa (2013) among others, the response of investment to the 
technology shock is weakened when the financial accelerator is present. Comparing 
across models, the impact of the financial accelerator on output and its components 
depends on whether financial data are observed in the estimation117. When financial data 
is observed, the response of output is stronger in both countries. However, the 
components of the output show a different story. There is a weakening of Australian 
consumption and investment responses, and an amplification of the US consumption and 
investment responses. In addition, regardless of whether financial frictions are included 
in the model, the US productivity shock also leads to co-movements of aggregate 
variables across countries, supporting the view of international business cycles.  
4.4.2 Variance decomposition 
In order to investigate how financial frictions and shocks are important in driving business 
cycles in Australia and the US, the variance decomposition is analysed. Since the baseline 
model is a richer model with many frictions and shocks, the structural estimation of the 
model can provide an assessment of the contribution of financial shocks ‘relative’ to other 
shocks.  Figure 4.B.10 in Appendix 4.B presents the contribution of financial shocks and 
non-financial shocks in the forecast error variances of selected observables evaluated at 
the posterior mean of the baseline model with AFV.  
                                                           
117 When financial variables are not observed, the presence of financial accelerator dampens responses of 
the output and investment in both countries.

Notes: For each variable indicated in the first column, variance decompositions are generated by the 
estimated models evaluated at mean of the posterior distribution. For each variable, results in the first row 
in the panels are generated by the baseline model with AFV. Results in the rows marked BM-DAFV are 
generated by the baseline model with DAFV. Results in the rows marked SM-DAFV are generated by the 
simple model without financial frictions. In the second column, the number the first figure represents the 
contribution of credit supply shock and the second figure implies the contribution of financial wealth shock. 
For the US, in the last column, the first and the second figures respectively imply the contributions of price-
markup and wage-markup. ##Figures in the column are sum of contributions of domestic price-markup 
shock, import price-markup shock and wage-markup shock; #Figures in the column are sum of 
contributions of all foreign shocks, including foreign financial shocks.

Interesting results include (i) the importance of financial shocks is increasing with 
forecasting horizons in both Australia,  and the US, and (ii) financial shocks are the most 
important sources of investment fluctuations in the medium and long runs.  
Table 4.4 presents the estimated models’ unconditional variance decomposition of 
selected observed variables evaluated at the posterior mean. According to the estimated 
baseline model with AFV, the results show that financial shocks (i.e., credit supply and 
financial wealth shocks) are vital for macroeconomic fluctuations in both Australia and 
the US as shown by recent studies (e.g., Jermann and Quadrini 2012, Chiristiano et al. 
2014). In the case of Australia, the financial wealth shock is more important as it explains 
around 40 per cent of the variation in investment, a quarter of GDP, more than half of the 
spread on external finance and over 90 per cent of the entrepreneurial net worth. Another 
interesting result is that 20 per cent of the variation in Australian investment is explained 
by the US shocks, particularly by the US financial shocks, accounting for 13 per cent. 
The result supports the view that the international spillovers from the US financial shocks 
have played a prominent role in international business cycles during the GFC.  
Moreover, the financial shocks also play a vital role in explaining variations in nominal 
variables. For instance, about a one-fourth of the variation of the US inflation is attributed 
to the financial shocks. The prominence of financial shocks is in line with previous studies 
in open economy context (e.g., Dib et al. 2008 and Christiano et al. 2011). In the case of 
the US, financial shocks account for 60 per cent of the variation in investment, 15 per 
cent of GDP, 40 per cent of the spread and a one-fourth of consumption. Both credit 
supply and financial wealth shocks are equally important in driving US macroeconomic 
fluctuations, which is not the case in Australia where financial wealth shocks are more 
important. The relevance of the credit shock in the US economy is in line with the finding 
obtained by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012).  
The result, showing the financial shock is important in driving macroeconomic 
fluctuations, depends sensitively on whether the financial data is observed in the 
estimation. It can be seen by examining the first and second rows in the panels of Table 
4.4. For each variable, results in the first row in the panels are generated by the baseline 
model when the financial data is observed in the analysis. The rows marked BM-DAFV 
report unconditional variance decompositions at the posterior mean of the baseline model 
when the financial data is dropped in the analysis. The rows marked SM-DAFV are 
computed using the simple model discussed in Section 4.3.1, evaluated at the mean of the 

167 
 
posterior distribution of its parameters. When all financial variables are not observed, 
financial shocks lose their importance, and the significance of the MEI shock increases 
in Australia as found by Christiano et al. (2011) for Sweden. A possible explanation for 
the change in the significance of the MEI shock is suggested by Christiano et al. (2014)118. 
The relevance of the government-spending shock in driving output and consumption 
fluctuations increases significantly in both countries when financial data is dropped. In 
the simple model, the relevance of technology and country risk premium shocks in 
Australia, and the contribution of the government spending and MEI shocks in the US 
increase significantly. However, the importance of those shocks is overestimated since 
the simple model is abstracted from financial frictions, financial shocks and financial 
observables, which are necessary to improve the model’s performance.     
From Table 4.4, variance decompositions of unemployment and changes in real exchange 
rate are robust to different models as financial shocks play a minor role in explaining their 
variations. The spillover from financial shocks into the labour market is weak in Australia 
compared to the US economy. In the US, financial shocks account for 6-9 per cent of the 
unemployment fluctuation. Moreover, the results in Table 4.4 regarding the baseline 
models are consistent with the empirical facts in a small open economy. For instance, the 
US shocks account for relatively high shares of the variation in most Australian 
observables, which have been a challenge for open economy models. Among the US 
shocks, the financial shocks play more important role in explaining Australian 
macroeconomic fluctuations. As stressed by Meese and Rogoff (1983), Australian 
exchange rate fluctuations are weakly related to the domestic macro fundamentals, but 
mainly explained by the country risk premium shock (65-70 per cent) and the US shocks 
(6-9 per cent). Among the Australian shocks, government-spending and markup shocks 
play an important role in explaining the movements in real exchange rate. In addition, 
monetary policy shock accounts for a significant portion of fluctuation of CPI inflations 
in both countries, which is consistent with the fact that monetary policy has been an 
important tool to control inflation and to stabilize the economy.   
                                                           
118 The MEI shock perturbs the supply curve of the market for capital, and the demand curve is perturbed 
by the credit supply and financial wealth shocks (Christiano et al. 2014). As shown in the Figure 4.1-4.4 
and Figure 4.B.5-4.B.6, though the demand and supply shocks have the same implication for the cyclical 
properties of investment (i.e., the investment is pro-cyclical), they have opposite implications for the price 
of capital and, hence, the value of net worth and the spread on external finance. Therefore, the presence of 
financial data in the analysis is helpful to properly identify the demand shocks, and hence to differentiate 
between the financial shocks and MEI shock.

4.4.3 Smoothed shock processes and historical decomposition  
Figure 4.B.11 in Appendix 4.B presents the smoothed values for the shock processes. 
During the recent GFC, several shocks in Australia and the US take extreme values. For 
Australia, extreme low values of the government-spending shock, 𝜖𝑔,𝑡, the technology 
shock, 𝜖𝑎,𝑡, the consumption preference shock, 𝜖𝑐,𝑡 and the financial wealth shock, 𝜖𝑓𝑤,𝑡 
contribute to the economic downturn. Extreme high values of the country risk premium 
shock, 𝜖𝑟𝑝,𝑡 and the credit supply shock, 𝜖𝑐𝑠,𝑡, and the price-markup shock for domestic 
firms, 𝜖𝑐𝑝ℎ,𝑡, contributing to macroeconomic fluctuations, are also observed. The 
monetary policy shock, 𝜖𝑟,𝑡 takes an extreme low value in the mid of 2009, implying that 
the estimated Taylor rule prescribes a higher interest rate than the actual rate. For the US, 
the extreme low values of the technology shock, 𝜀𝑎∗,𝑡, the consumption preference shock, 
𝜀𝑐∗,𝑡, the MEI shock, 𝜀𝑔∗,𝑡 and the financial wealth shock, 𝜀𝑓𝑤∗,𝑡 and high values of the 
labour disutility shock, 𝜀𝑛∗,𝑡, and the credit supply shock, 𝜀𝑐𝑠∗,𝑡 contribute to the economic 
downturn. In the beginning of the GFC, the financial wealth shocks were negative and 
the credit supply shocks were positive. After the GFC, the monetary policy shock, 𝜀𝑟∗,𝑡  
takes negative values in general.  
The size of some estimated shocks depends sensitively on whether financial variables are 
included in the analysis. In both countries, the sizes of MEI and financial wealth shocks 
are significantly reduced, whereas the size of credit supply shocks is considerably 
increased    when financial variables are not observed in the analysis. This result also 
suggests that the presence of financial data in the analysis is helpful to properly identify 
MEI and financial shocks and measure their impacts on macroeconomic aggregates.    
To assess the source of the recessions in Australia and the US, Figures 4.B.12-4.B.14 in 
Appendix 4.B show historical decompositions of selected observables that exhibit the 
contribution of financial, MEI and country risk premium shocks to movements in each 
observable over the period 1993:Q2-2013:Q4. According to the Figure 4.B.13, financial 
shocks have played an important role in the sharp drop of investment and inflation in both 
countries during the GFC as found by Christiano et al. (2014) for the US and by Christiano 
et al. (2011) for Sweden. The contribution of financial shocks in the US inflation 
dynamics may provide a supplementary explanation to the fact discussed by Del Negro 
et al. (2015) and Christiano et al. (2015) that the US inflation declined somewhat in early 
2009, but then remained positive during the GFC. When combining contributions of 

169 
 
financial shocks (i.e., demand shocks in the capital market) with those of the MEI shock 
(i.e., supply shock in the capital market), those shocks explain enormously well the 
movements in investments (Figure 4.B.14). The positive demand and supply shocks in 
the capital market significantly contribute to higher growth of output in both countries 
prior to the GFC. Moreover, those shocks contribute only to disinflation (not to inflation) 
in Australia.  
As Australia has a commodity-based economy, the global recession also influences the 
economy passing through international trade (e.g., negative shock to terms of trade and 
weak demand for commodities), and hence the nominal exchange rate is depreciated 
during the recession. This situation can be well captured by the country risk premium 
shock. Therefore, to analyse impact of the additional channel, the combined contributions 
of financial, MEI and country risk premium shocks are shown in Figure 4.B.14. An 
interesting result is that the Australian investment downturn in the beginning of 2000s 
and the slow recovery of Australian GDP since the GFC are closely associated with 
country risk premium shocks. The results suggest that the global recessions have 
influenced the Australian economy passing through both international trade and financial 
linkages.  
4.5 Conclusion  
This chapter has assessed the importance of financial frictions and financial shocks in an 
estimated small open economy DSGE model for explaining macroeconomic fluctuations. 
The model incorporates important extensions. Financial frictions in the accumulation of 
capital were introduced following BGG approach. Involuntary unemployment was also 
included building on the approach proposed by Galí (2011) in which unemployment 
results from market power in labour markets. Various shocks, including wage markup, 
labour supply, MEI, credit supply and financial wealth shocks are incorporated based on 
the recent literature. Several versions of the model are estimated using Bayesian methods 
on Australian and the US data containing financial data over the period 1993:Q1-
2013:Q4.  
The key empirical results from the chapter are as follows. First, the inclusion of financial 
frictions and foreign debt plays an important role in the estimated small open economy 
model. According to the Bayes factor as the evaluation criterion, the data favours the 
estimated model with financial accelerator compared to the model with no financial 

170 
 
friction. In addition, the data clearly supports the presence of the foreign-currency 
denominated debt in the model. Second, the elasticity of the EFP with respect to 
entrepreneurial leverage is estimated away from zero in both cases of Australia and the 
US. In particular, when the financial data is not observed, the estimated parameters are 
closer to values obtained in the existing literature (e.g., Elakdag et al. 2006, Christensen 
and Dib 2008 and Gilchrist et al. 2009). These results therefore suggest that the financial 
accelerator is evident in both countries, but quantitatively more important in the US. 
Third, the impulse response analysis suggests the existence of the balance sheet channel 
of monetary policy and the foreign-currency denominated debt channel in Australia, 
consistent with findings obtained by Jacobs and Rayner (2012) and Rush et al. (2013). 
The presence of the financial accelerator amplifies and propagates the effects of monetary 
policy shocks on investment, output and employment, but dampens the effects of 
technology and labour supply shocks in both Australia and the US as found by Iacoviello 
(2005). Moreover, the adverse financial shocks could potentially lead to a domestic 
recession in both Australia and the US economy. Fourth, financial shocks play an 
important role in generating business cycle fluctuations in both Australia and the US. In 
Australia, the financial wealth shock (i.e., shock to entrepreneurial wealth) is vital for 
explaining 
macroeconomic 
fluctuation. 
In 
terms 
of 
unconditional 
variance 
decomposition, the financial wealth shock accounts for around 40 per cent of the variation 
in investment, a quarter of GDP and more than half of the spread on external finance. In 
the case of the US, both credit supply and financial wealth shocks are relevant in 
explaining the business cycle. Fifth, as shown by Christiano et al. (2011) and Christiano 
et al. (2014), the MEI shock has limited importance in terms of unconditional variance 
decomposition when the model with financial frictions is estimated to match financial 
data. This result is more prominent in the case of the US, suggesting the US investment 
dynamics are highly related to shocks to the demand side of capital market (i.e., financial 
shocks), not to the supply side of the market (i.e., MEI shock). Finally, the exercise 
interpreting the recent economic events using the model with AFV shows that the adverse 
financial shocks (i.e., the sharp increase in the credit spread and the sharp fall in the equity 
market index) have contributed to the sharp downturns in investments in both countries. 
The country risk premium shocks have played an important role in the investment 
downturns of 2001, and also explain the slow recovery of the Australian GDP since the 
GFC.

Though these results have yielded significant insights about the importance of financial 
frictions and shocks in a small open economy, the present model can be further extended 
to fit the data. Future models may (i) incorporate the financial intermediation sector into 
the model as suggested by Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011) to 
examine the significance of shocks originating within the financial sector, and (ii) allow 
for financial frictions in working capital loans as shown by Christiano et al. (2015) to 
investigate the role of the risky working capital channel in the transmission of financial 
shocks (in which case, financial shocks also play a role as supply shocks). An alternative 
extension to the model would be to include the interaction between the financial 
intermediary/banks and households based on the specifications used by Gerali et al. 
(2010) and Dib et al. (2010a) in order to empirically assess which modelling approach is 
supported by the data. Future work could also explore the implication of observing 
market-based data (of the financial and housing sectors) for identifying financial shocks 
in the estimated model and for improving the model fit.

Appendix 4.C Derivation of key equations  
4.C.1 Introducing capital stock 
Capital accumulation: A log-linear approximation to equation (4.1) gives 
                        𝐾(1 + 𝑘𝑡+1) = 𝐾+ (1 −𝛿)𝐾𝑘𝑡+ 𝐼(𝑖𝑡+ 𝜀𝑖,𝑡) 
Using 𝐼= 𝛿𝐾 that holds in steady state, the above expression can be rewritten  
𝑘𝑡+1 = (1 −𝛿)𝑘𝑡+ 𝛿(𝑖𝑡+ 𝜀𝑖,𝑡)                                                       (4.C.1) 
Investment: A representative capital producers choose 𝐼𝑡 by maximizing the following 
expected profit:

. As shown in Appendix D 
of  Galí and Monacelli (2005), equilibrium variations in 𝑧𝑡≡log 𝑍𝑡 around the perfect 
foresight steady state are of second order. Thus, up to a first order log-linear 
approximation to equation (4.C.4) gives  
𝑦𝑡= 𝜀𝑎,𝑡+ Ω𝑘𝑡

Real rental rate: A log-linear approximation to equation (4.6) results  
                        𝑅𝑘(1 + 𝑟𝑡

Real marginal cost: A log-linear approximation to equation (4.7) gives 
                         𝑀𝐶(1 + 𝑚𝑐𝑡) = 𝑀𝐶+ 𝑀𝐶(1 −Ω)(𝜔𝑡+ 𝜐𝑛𝑟𝑡) + 𝑀𝐶Ω(𝑟𝑡

where 𝜔𝑡= 𝑤𝑡−𝑝𝑡 is the real wage, 𝑤𝑡 and 𝑝𝑡 respectively denote nominal wage and 
price, 𝑠𝑡 denotes the terms of trade and 𝑟𝑡= 𝑅𝑡−𝑅 is nominal interest rate.   
 
4.C.3 Introducing financial frictions  
Capital utilization: A log-linear approximation to (4.11) gives  
                𝑅𝑘(1 + 𝑟𝑡
𝑘) = 𝑎′(𝑈) + 𝑈𝑎′′(𝑈)𝑢𝑡 
Using the steady-state condition, 𝑅𝑘= 𝑎′(𝑈), the above can be reduced to  
                 𝑢𝑡= 𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡
𝑘                                                                                                (4.C.8) 
  where 𝑢𝑎= 𝑎′(𝑈) (𝑈𝑎′′(𝑈))
⁄
. As assumed by Smets and Wouters (2007), the 
adjustment cost function can take the functional form of 𝑎(𝑈𝑡) = 𝑎0𝑈𝑡

⁄
, where  0 ≤
𝜅≤1 and 𝑎0 is a constant. In such case, 𝑢𝑎 can be obtained as 𝑢𝑎= (1 −𝜅) 𝜅

Using the steady-state relations, 𝑈= 1, 1 + 𝑅𝑒,𝑘= 𝑅𝑘+ 1 −𝛿, and 𝑅𝑘= 𝑎′(𝑈), above

Conclusion and policy implications 
5.1 Overview and key findings  
This thesis has examined the importance of various modelling implications (i.e., frictions 
and shocks) in building empirically viable small open economy DSGE models by using 
a Bayesian approach to conduct the model estimation and evaluation analysis. In 
particular, the following issues have been explored: (i) the potential roles played by the 
presence of the cost channel of monetary policy and the UIP modification in the model; 
(ii) the importance of news (anticipated) shocks in a small open economy DSGE model 
for analysing business cycle properties of macroeconomic aggregates, including labour 
market variables; and (iii) the significance of financial frictions and shocks in a small 
open economy DSGE model for explaining macroeconomic fluctuations. To this end, 
each chapter has constructed a small open economy New Keynesian DSGE model in a 
two-country setting by adding relevant frictions and shocks (e.g., modifying UIP 
condition, labour market imperfect competition, financial frictions, and labour market and 
financial shocks). As a main insight of this thesis, the Bayesian estimation and evaluation 
of the models based on the data for Australia and the US (or G7 for Chapter 2) have 
provided a comprehensive empirical assessment for the relevance of the modelling 
frictions.  
Chapter 2 focused on the quantitative role of the cost channel of monetary policy and the 
UIP modification in an estimated small open economy New Keynesian DSGE model. In 
doing so, Chapter 2 augmented a simple small open economy DSGE model developed by 
Justiniano and Preston (2010a) to include the cost channel and the UIP modification. Four 
variants of the model were estimated using the Bayesian maximum likelihood method 
and the data for Australia and the G7 economy. In order to assess the significance of the 
additional features in the model, Chapter 2 conducted standard assessments for evaluating 

198 
 
the estimated DSGE models, including sensitivity analysis for the estimated parameters, 
Bayesian posterior model probability comparison and posterior predictive analysis.   
Empirical results in Chapter 2 have shown that the presence of the cost channel and the 
presented UIP modification improves the model’s ability to fit the business cycle 
properties of key macroeconomic variables and to account for the empirical facts on the 
monetary transmission mechanism. According to the Bayes factor as the evaluation 
criterion, the result shows that the cost channel of monetary policy is operative as obtained 
by Chang and Jansen (2014) and the standard UIP condition is violated in Australia. The 
presence of the cost channel improves the model fit. However it does not improve the fit 
as much as modifying the UIP condition. The monetary transmission analysis of the 
model with these extensions shows (i) no evidence of the price puzzle, implying that 
supply side effects of monetary policy are negligible compared to its demand side effects, 
and (ii) evidence for the delayed overshooting of exchange rate in response to a monetary 
policy shock. These are consistent with the existing empirical results provided by Dungey 
and Pagan (2000), Liu (2010) and Jääskelä and Jennings (2010). The major role played 
by the cost channel in the model is to generate inflation inertia without obtaining a high 
estimated degree of domestic price stickiness as found by Christiano et al. (2005). The 
presence of the UIP modification allows the model to better match the persistence of the 
observed exchange rate. As a result, the estimated model with such modifications does a 
good job in generating both persistence and volatility in real exchange rate dynamics, as 
well as in producing hump-shaped responses of the real exchange rate to exogenous 
shocks, which have been difficult to obtain from standard small open economy DSGE 
models.  
In addition, some important results regarding small open economy modelling and 
macroeconomics also emerged from the empirical analysis in Chapter 2. The estimates 
for structural parameters in the small open economy DSGE model are sensitive to 
variations in model specifications, implying quantitative changes in the model 
performance are associated with both the difference in the equation form (Phillips curves 
and UIP condition) and the changes in the estimated parameters. The variance 
decomposition analysis shows that monetary policy shocks have been mainly absorbed 
by the output and have played a minor role in explaining real exchange rate dynamics. 
Moreover, real exchange rate movements have mitigated the effects of external shocks 
(i.e., country risk premium shock) on the Australian economy during the inflation-

199 
 
targeting period. For instance, the real exchange rate volatility is mainly driven by the 
country risk premium shock (more than 70 per cent), which explains only 21-38 per cent 
of the variance of output in the medium-run. The results support the view that monetary 
policy plays a vital role in stabilising the economy, and the flexible exchange rate acts as 
a shock absorber in the case of Australia.  
Based on the model derived in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 moved to develop and estimate the 
small open economy DSGE model in the two-country setting, featuring both labour 
market imperfections (i.e., unemployment and staggered wage setting) and news shocks. 
Involuntary unemployment was introduced building on the approach proposed by Galí 
(2011) in which unemployment results from market power in labour markets. Chapter 3 
pointed out that news shocks could lead to Pigovian business cycles by changing agents’ 
expectations about future economic activity. In particular, the chapter highlighted the role 
of news shocks in driving labour market (i.e., unemployment and wage inflation) 
fluctuations and business cycles.  
Several variants of the model with news shocks were estimated using the Bayesian 
techniques and data for Australia and the US. The preference shifter parameters, 
controlling the short-run wealth effects on labour supply, were estimated at 0.06 and 0.11 
in Australia and the US, respectively. The lower values imply that the estimated 
preference is closer to the preference discussed by Greenwood et al. (1988), which 
features no short-run wealth effects on labour supply. Therefore, the presented utility 
function with the preference shifter in Chapter 3 helps the model to generate the co-
movement of output and labour force (and employment) in response to news shocks about 
future productivity and monetary policy.  
The empirical analysis in Chapter 3 explored the importance of news shocks in 
developing empirically viable small open economy DSGE models and in driving business 
cycles. From the view of empirical DSGE modelling, the presence of joint news shocks 
(i.e., a combination among different types of shocks in Australia and the US) has the 
potential to improve the relative fit of an estimated open economy model. In addition, the 
estimated model, augmented to include imperfect labour market, endogenous reference 
shifter and news shocks, has the ability to qualitatively replicate the results of the VAR 
analyses on news-driven domestic and international business cycles in small open 
economies (e.g., Kosaka 2013 and Kamber et al. 2014). In particular, news about future 
technology, country risk premium and consumption preference in Australia could lead to 

200 
 
domestic business cycle fluctuations, whereas the US news shocks on technology and 
consumption preference could propagate to Australia, generating international business 
cycles. In addition, the estimated responses of labour market variables to technology news 
are in line with the VAR result obtained by Theodoridis and Zanetti (2014) in the sense 
that a positive technology news shock leads to a counter-cyclical unemployment rate and 
a wage increase in both Australia and the US.  
Empirical results show that news shocks have played a crucial role in driving the 
Australian business cycle during the inflation-targeting period. Exceeding half of the 
variances in Australian observables is explained by news shocks. Moreover, news shocks 
were a major source of the Australian recession during the 2008-2009 global financial 
crisis (GFC). As a novel result, news shocks play a significant role in unemployment 
dynamics as the shocks account for 35 and 41 per cent of unemployment fluctuations in 
Australia and the US, respectively. Though news shocks are major sources of the US 
business cycle, the quantitative comparison shows that the Australian economy has been 
more news-driven than the US economy in the last two decades. The analysis also reveals 
the pivotal role of the news about the country risk premium in the Australian business 
cycle. The risk premium news shock accounts for exceeding one-quarter of the 
unconditional variances in most Australian observables, consistent with findings provided 
by Nimark (2009), Liu (2010) and Leu (2011). The Chapter 3 also emphasizes the role of 
exchange rate in the propagation of news shocks. Impulse response and variance 
decomposition analyses show that the real exchange rate dynamics play an important role 
in the propagation of news shocks.  
Developing interconnected models in the thesis (e.g., the model in the Chapter 3 augments 
the model built in the Chapter 2 by adding the labour market imperfection, the 
endogenous preference shifter and news shocks) also provides an opportunity to assess 
both quantitative and qualitative impacts of the additional features in the model. A key 
result is that the parameters governing the cost channel and the UIP modification are 
generally robust124, implying the relevance of the cost channel and the presented UIP 
modification in the models. However, the estimated parameter for the UIP modification, 
𝜙𝑒, is sensitive to whether the financial variables are observed in the estimation or not, 
                                                           
124 In the model estimated in Chapter 2, posterior means of the parameters are 𝜈𝐻= 0.37, 𝜈𝐹= 0.47 and 
𝜙𝑒= 0.32, and estimated as 𝜈𝐻= 0.36, 𝜈𝐹= 0.53 and 𝜙𝑒= 0.32 in Chapter 3. This result is also robust 
in Chapter 4 in the sense that the posterior means of the model with AFV are 𝜈𝑘= 0.48, 𝜈𝑛= 0.31, 𝜈𝐹=
0.52 and 𝜙𝑒= 0.31.  

201 
 
suggesting that observing financial variables may help to properly estimate the exchange 
rate dynamics in the model with financial frictions and financial shocks.  
Moreover, the comparison of the impulse response and variance decomposition analyses 
of the models offers the following results. First, responses of Australian output, inflation 
and real exchange rate to the unanticipated monetary policy shock is more hump-shaped 
in Chapter 3 than those in Chapter 2. A reasonable explanation for the result is that the 
introduction of nominal wage rigidities in Chapter 3 improves the model’s ability to 
generate more persistent responses of inflation and output as found by Christiano et al. 
(2005). For instance, the presence of the nominal wage rigidities reduces the estimated 
values of the parameters, controlling the price rigidities, in the model built in Chapter 3. 
Second, the presence of imperfect labour market assumptions, complemented with the 
theory of involuntary unemployment developed by Galí 2011(a), improve the internal 
propagation of shocks within the estimated model in Chapter 3. However, labour market 
shocks (wage markup and labour supply shocks) play a minor role in explaining 
movements of non-labour market variables in both Australia and the US.   
Chapter 4 further extended the model in Chapter 3 to a richer open economy DSGE model 
in the two-country setting with involuntary unemployment, financial frictions and various 
shocks. Financial frictions in the accumulation of capital were introduced as developed 
by Bernanke et al. (1999). In the modelling of external financing for capital, liability 
dollarization (i.e., debt partially denominated in foreign currency) was assumed in the 
block of small open economy as modelled by Anand et al. (2010) and Freystätter (2011). 
Structural shocks in the model include wage markup, labour supply, marginal efficiency 
of investment (MEI), financial shocks (credit supply and financial wealth shocks) in 
addition to standard shocks such as monetary policy, technology, consumption 
preference, price markup and government spending shocks.  
The empirical analysis in Chapter 4 focused on the importance of financial frictions and 
shocks for macroeconomic fluctuations. Several variants of the model with different 
features were estimated using the Bayesian techniques and data for Australia and the US, 
containing directly observed financial data. The elasticity of the external finance premium 
with respect to entrepreneurial leverage was estimated as 𝜓= 0.037 and 𝜓∗= 0.042 in 
Australia and the US, respectively. As Chapter 4 is the first attempt to estimate the small 
open economy DSGE model with the financial friction (based on BGG approach) in case 
of Australia, there is no reference value of 𝜓 for Australia. However, the estimate 

202 
 
parameters of 𝜓 and 𝜓∗are closer to the values provided by Elekdag et al. (2006), 
Christensen and Dib (2008) and Gilchrist et al. (2009). The result implies that the 
financial accelerator is operative in both countries, but is quantitatively more relevant in 
the US. 
In addition, the relative fit assessments based on the Bayes factor suggests that (i) the 
presence of financial accelerator and financial shocks improves the model fit, and (ii) the 
data clearly supports the assumption of partial liability dollarization (the foreign-currency 
denominated debt) in the model. In fact, the model incorporating both the financial 
accelerator and the partial liability dollarization significantly outperforms its alternative 
models, suggesting that both frictions play important roles in improving the model’s 
ability to fit the actual data. The findings also suggest that the real economy of Australia 
can be affected by changes in foreign lenders’ assessments on the economy’s outlook as 
changes in the country risk premium (or exchange rates) has a direct effect on the balance 
sheet of Australian companies. However, Rush et al. (2013) have shown that the 
Australian economy has consistently had a net foreign currency asset position, which 
explains why the whole economy is resilient to external shocks (or an event of a sudden 
depreciation of the Australian dollar). This supports a result of the thesis (consistently 
obtained in variance decompositions of Chapters 2-4) that Australia’s flexible exchange 
rate has played an important role in cushioning the economy from external shocks and 
smoothing fluctuations in the business cycle.  
The impulse response analysis has further highlighted the empirical relevance of the 
financial accelerator mechanism in driving the macroeconomic fluctuations. For instance, 
there is evidence of the balance sheet channel of monetary policy and the foreign-currency 
denominated debt channel in Australia, consistent with the finding provided by Jacobs 
and Rayner (2012). The financial accelerator amplifies and propagates the effects of 
monetary policy shocks on investment, output and employment, but dampens the effects 
of technology and labour supply shocks in both Australia and the US. It is also found that 
the adverse financial shocks could potentially lead to a domestic recession in both 
countries.  
Variance decomposition analysis has emphasized the significance of financial shocks and 
observing financial data. Financial wealth and credit supply shocks play a central role, 
but no dominant role, in explaining macroeconomic fluctuations in both Australia and the 
US. In particular, the financial wealth shock (i.e., shock to entrepreneurial wealth) is vital 

203 
 
for the Australian economy as it accounts for around 40 per cent of the variation in 
investment, a quarter of GDP and more than half of the spread on external finance. In the 
case of the US, both credit supply and financial wealth shocks are equally important in 
explaining the business cycle, and account for 60 per cent of the variation in investment, 
15 per cent of GDP, 40 per cent of the spread and a quarter of consumption and 
investment. The US financial shocks account for 13 and 10 per cent of the variation in 
Australian investment and interest rate, respectively. The findings support the view that 
the international spillovers from the US financial shocks have played a prominent role in 
international business cycles and the 2008-2009 GFC.  
Another key result is that the importance of MEI shock in the business cycle can be 
overestimated when the financial data is not directly observed in empirical analysis. The 
analysis suggests that when the model with financial frictions is estimated to match the 
financial data, the macroeconomic fluctuation is more related to demand shocks of the 
capital market (i.e., financial shocks) rather than the supply shocks of the market (i.e., 
MEI shock). In addition, the comparison of variance decompositions in Chapters 2-4 has 
shown that the small-scale DSGE models (as used in Chapter 2-3) may overestimate the 
relevance of the technology and country risk premium shocks in generating 
macroeconomic fluctuations in the sense that the contribution of the shocks is 
significantly reduced when MEI and financial shocks are added into the model. These 
results support the views, suggesting (i) all relevant shocks should be included in the 
model when someone wants to analyse the contribution of a specific shock in the 
macroeconomic fluctuations, and (ii) as originally argued by Justiniano et al. (2010) and 
Christiano et al. (2014), including financial friction/sector into a model and directly 
observing financial data are helpful to properly measure the contribution of financial 
shocks (or MEI shock) in the business cycle. 
The exercise interpreting the recent economic events using the baseline model with AFV 
has shown that (i) several shocks in Australia and the US have taken extreme values 
during the 2008-2009 GFC, and the financial wealth shocks were negative and the credit 
supply shocks were positive in the beginning of the GFC, and (ii) the adverse financial 
shocks (i.e., the sharp increase in the credit spread and the sharp fall in the stock market 
index) have contributed to the sharp downturn in investments in both Australia and the 
US during the GFC. The country risk premium shocks played a vital role in the investment 

204 
 
downturns of 2001, and also explain the slow recovery of the GDP in Australia since the 
GFC.  
Overall, the thesis has shown that the presented modelling frictions and shocks (i.e., the 
cost channel of monetary policy, modifying UIP condition, labour market imperfection, 
financial frictions, and news and financial shocks) are vital in building an empirically 
viable open economy New Keynesian DSGE model for policy analysis and forecasting. 
Moreover, the thesis contributes to the literature on the business cycle in a small open 
economy by providing empirical evidence that (i) the business cycle could steam from 
news about the future economic development and distortions in financial market 
conditions, and (ii) the business cycle could be affected by the degree of labour and 
financial market frictions, the degree of liability dollarization, and the economic structure, 
such as firms’ dependence on short-term loans and the degree of violation in the standard 
UIP condition.  
5.2 Policy implications 
This thesis has provided some implications for designing macroeconomic policies that 
stabilize the economy in both developed and developing countries. First, implementing 
the Taylor principle in monetary policy and the flexible exchange rate would stabilize the 
economies that have similar characteristics to Australia. The supply side effects (i.e., cost 
channel) of monetary policy call for a serious rethinking of optimal monetary policy. If 
the supply side effects of monetary policy are strong enough, then the Taylor principle 
becomes a source of macroeconomic instability (the same as ‘adding fuel to the fire’). 
The empirical result obtained in this thesis has shown that the supply side effects of 
monetary policy are not strong enough compared to the demand-side effects in Australia, 
supporting the view that the conventional monetary policy (i.e., the Taylor principle and 
the expectation-based rule) promotes macroeconomic stability by avoiding self-fulfilling 
inflation expectations. Moreover, the thesis has shown that the flexible exchange rate in 
Australia plays a role as a shock absorber in the sense that the real exchange rate 
movements have mitigated the impact of the external shock (e.g., country risk premium 
shock) on the real economy.  
Second, the credible policy announcements by the monetary authority and the 
government are crucial in stabilizing the macroeconomy. As emphasized in Chapter 3, 
news shocks significantly contribute to macroeconomic fluctuations in both Australia and 

205 
 
the US. Moreover, in the case of the US, the contribution of monetary policy news to 
output, inflation and unemployment fluctuations is larger than the contribution of 
unanticipated monetary policy shocks. Therefore, policy makers should deliver credible 
announcements about intended policy actions to achieve a larger impact on the economy 
and to dampen the impact of adverse news shocks in the early stage. In doing so, policy 
makers may also affect economic agents’ expectation formation rather than dealing with 
the consequences triggered by adverse news shocks.  
Third, promoting financial stability is critical in stabilizing the macroeconomy in the 
current environment with the high degree of real-financial linkages. As found in Chapter 
4, financial shocks (i.e., credit supply and financial wealth shocks) have played a central 
role in driving macroeconomic fluctuations in both Australia and the US. In particular, 
during the 2008-2009 GFC, the financial shocks in both countries have taken their 
extreme values, and significantly contributed to investment downturns. In general, 
monetary policy can be well placed to fight financial shocks as estimated responses of 
macro aggregates to loosening policy shock are found to be the mirror image of the 
responses to adverse financial shocks in both Australia and the US. However, as shown 
in the variance decomposition analysis in Chapter 4, the conventional monetary and fiscal 
policies have a limited role in influencing the financial market. Therefore, the findings in 
the thesis support the view that policy makers should design and employ prudential policy 
instruments for preventing financial instability and a financial crisis. Designing such 
instruments is still a challenge for policy makers in the sense that the choice of the 
instruments should be based on the quantitative analysis on assessing the effectiveness of 
such instruments in promoting financial and macroeconomic stability. However, this 
issue is beyond the scope of the research questions set in the thesis.  
Fourth, for countries with high foreign debt (or foreign-currency denominated debt), 
developing financial derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk of corporations is 
important to avoid from the possible negative impacts of exchange rate volatility on 
entrepreneurs’ balance sheets, passing through the foreign-currency denominated debt 
channel. Within the well-developed derivative markets, the flexible exchange rate may 
play a role as a shock absorber instead of a source of shocks in a small open economy 
such as Australia.

Fifth, for small open economies, where labour unions are influential in setting the wage 
rate, achieving both micro and macro flexibilities125 in the labour market while protecting 
workers and maintaining incentives for workers is important to stabilize the labour market 
and the macroeconomic fluctuations. For example, in the Australian economy, the labour 
market is very responsive to both internal and external (and unanticipated and anticipated) 
shocks, and appreciation/depreciation of the exchange rate increases/reduces the 
unemployment.  
Finally, the thesis offers an appropriate methodological approach in building a country-
specific open economy DSGE model to study the monetary policy transmission and the 
business cycle in developing countries. Owing to the weak labour and financial markets 
in developing countries, it is more likely that the cost channel of monetary policy is 
strong, the standard UIP condition is violated, labour market is imperfect, the degree of 
financial friction is high and the substantial part of debts is also denominated in foreign 
currency. Therefore, policy makers in developing countries may formulate and estimate 
their own country-specific monetary DSGE models for policy analysis and decision-
making by incorporating the presented modelling frictions and shocks as suggested by 
the thesis.  
                                                           
125 Micro flexibility refers to the ability of the economy to allow for the reallocation of workers to jobs 
needed to sustain growth, while macro flexibility refers to the ability of the economy to adjust to 
macroeconomic shocks.
