An Ising Model with Random Impurities: 
Boundary Effects 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 1 
Ideally we would like to repeat for the impure Ising model of the last 
chapter all computations done for Onsager's lattice. Indeed, in this 
chapter we will parallel the development given Onsager's lattice in 
Chapters VI and VII by studying boundary effects. Also, it has been 
possible to study the nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlation functions of 
the bulk. Much further than this, however, it has proved impossible to go. 
The interesting quantities of the bulk which, for Onsager's lattice, were 
studied in Chapters X-XII remain to be computed for the impure lattice.2 
Because of this lack of computations of bulk properties, the investiga-
tion of boundary effects assumes an importance much beyond that which 
it had in Onsager's lattice. In a sense which will be shortly made precise, 
the behaviors of the boundary magnetization and spin-spin correlation 
functions are lower bounds on the behavior of the corresponding bulk 
properties. This relation between boundary and bulk properties also 
exists for Onsager's lattice but was not exploited previously because all 
quantities involved may be studied precisely in their own right. For the 
impure lattice these bounds are all2 that presently exist. 
1. This chapter is based on the work of B. M. McCoy and T. T. Wu, Phys. Rev. 
188, 982 (1969), and B. M. McCoy, Phys. Rev. 188, 1014 (1969). 
2. It should be mentioned that there does exist one additional interesting qualita-
tive result which has been proved directly for the bulk by R. B. Griffiths, Phys. Rev. 
Letters 23, 17 (1969). He considers a random Ising model in which each individual 
interaction energy is an independent random variable E with the probability 
distribution function P(E) = ρδ(Ε - E) + (1 - p)S(E). For this model Griffiths 
shows that the bulk magnetization fails to be an analytic function of the field H at 
H = 0 for a range of temperatures above that at which spontaneous magnetization 
first appears. 

[373] 
RANDOM ISING MODEL: BOUNDARY 
EFFECTS 
As in Chapters VI and VII, we consider a half-plane of Ising spins 
where the boundary row (called 1) is allowed to interact with a magnetic 
field 
We study the magnetization of this first row, 
2»ΐ(Φ) = <ffl.m>, 
and the spin-spin correlation function between two spins in the first row, 
©l,l(m> 
= <σ1,0σ1.πι>· 
The values of 50lt and @lfl are, in general, different for the different 
lattices in our collection even in the thermodynamic limit. This is in 
distinct contrast with the free energy and magnetization of the bulk, each 
of which approaches a value in the thermodynamic limit that is the same, 
with probability 1, for all lattices of our collection.3 
Even though these boundary spin correlation functions are not prob-
ability 1 objects themselves, their average values provide lower bounds 
on certain probability 1 objects of the bulk. These bounds are obtained 
by using a theorem due to Griffiths which is proved in Appendix A. 
Griffiths' Theorem. In any Ising model in which all interaction energies 
EU k) and E2(j> k) are nonnegative and in which the magnetic fields 
Huk that interact with the spins at sites (J, k) all have the same sign, the 
decrease (increase) of the strength of any Ex(J, k), E2(J, k), or \Huk\ will 
not increase (decrease) the value of any spin correlation function such as 
iai.k"f,k·') 
ΟΓ |<CTy.fc> I. 
To establish the desired inequalities we remark that, if H is a magnetic 
field which interacts with all spins, the magnetization of any lattice in our 
collection may be written 
M(H) = lim (-¡LrfOf)- 1/]? 
aj.iSjt.jr, 
je—*> 
\y.fc 
/ 
where 
—ä + 1 ^ j < M, 
- j r + ι ^ k < jr, 
and we impose cyclic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction. 
3. Several further remarks need to be made about ζσι·.η·σι.<η> in the bulk. First 
of all, it depends on /', m', I, and m separately instead of on Γ — I and m' — m 
alone. However, for most experimental applications our interest is not in <<rl i„al,m>, 
but in the average of this over all /', m', I, and m with I' — I and m' — m held fixed. 
This average is clearly equivalent to an average over E2. Furthermore, it is not 
possible to compute M a as lim,a+m2^„ <σ0ι0σ,,„> since Iimm^« <a,i0c,im> depends 
on / and limi-» <σο,·<τι,η> does not exist. Instead, we have M = ]imi2+m2_„ 
<«<'o.o<'i,in»1'a>i2. These last statements may be illustrated by considering the lattice 
in which E2(J) is given by E2(4n + 1) = £2(4n + 2) = E'2
m and £s(4n + 3) 
= E2(4n + 4) = Ε'·Γ. where η takes on all integer values. See Appendix Β of the 
paper by Β. M. McCoy and T. T. Wu of reference 1. 

[374] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
Now M(H), being an average of <σλ)£> over the entire lattice, is a prob-
ability 1 object. Hence 
M(H) =<OX.O»B2, 
(1.6) 
where the notation < }Es denotes an average over all lattices in the 
collection. Consider any lattice out of the collection of lattices specified 
by a set of energies {E2(J)} where j satisfies (1.4). The magnetic field φ 
interacts with the row j = 1 only. Therefore, Griffiths' theorem says that 
for any {E2(j)}> if Η is numerically equal to φ, 
M<&) < M(H). 
(1.7) 
We are interested in the relation between M(H) and 
3Ki(S) = <"I.O>hp, 
(1.8) 
where < ) H P means a thermal average in an Ising lattice where the rows j 
satisfy 
1 <, j < Jf 
instead of (1.4). If we replace all vertical bonds between the row j = 0 
and j = 1 in the original lattice specified by (1.4) by zero, we may apply 
Griffiths' theorem again to find 
» ι » ) ^ M{H). 
(1.9) 
But this inequality holds for every collection of bonds {£2}, so it holds 
for the average as well; so 
<2Ki(£>)>*2 < M(H). 
(1.10) 
A similar argument applied to Sm(H) = <<T0,ooro.m>butt establishes that 
<©i,i(m, ©)>E2 < <Sm{H)}Er 
(1.11) 
These lower bounds may be used to draw conclusions about the critical 
behavior of the bulk properties if we know that both the bulk and the 
boundary spontaneous magnetizations vanish at the same temperature 
as Tis increased from zero. We are not able to show this directly. How-
ever, we will see in Sec. 2 that the boundary spontaneous magnetization 
vanishes at the same temperature Tc at which the observable specific heat 
found in Chapter XIV fails to be analytic. Thus, if we could show that the 
bulk spontaneous magnetization vanishes at the temperature at which 
the observable specific heat fails to be analytic we would have 
<TO1(0+)>£2 = M(0 +) = 0 
for Τ > Tc. 
(1.12) 
This identification of the temperature at which M(0 +) vanishes with the 
temperature at which the specific heat fails to be analytic has been 
discussed in Sec. 4 of Chapter X. No general proof of the validity of this

seemingly natural assumption exists, but neither has a counter example 
been found. Therefore, we will assume it to be true and find from (1.10)

To relate further the boundary to the bulk and to compare the pure 
with the impure Ising model, it is useful to introduce some notation. 
It is often assumed in the study of critical phenomena that near Tc the 
singularities in the magnetization and Sm(H) may be parameterized in 
terms of "critical exponents" as 
M(0+) ~ const (Tc - Tf

The results of our calculations of bulk properties of Onsager's lattice 
are all of this "critical exponent" form. For the boundary, on the other 
hand, it would superficially appear as if the susceptibility, which diverges 
as — 1η|Γ— Tc\, and the Τ = Tc magnetization, which behaves as 
— & In 
are not of the form (1.14). This deviation is, however, not 
serious, since we can use the relation 
->0 
lim ( i IΤ - Tc \-r - I ) = - I n | Τ - Tc\ 
(1.16) 
to interpret the logarithmic divergence of the boundary susceptibility as 
equivalent to /boundary = 0. Similarly, the behavior —ξ» In |®| is readily

MODEL 
interpreted as 5,,oundanr = 1. With these two remarks it is now easily seen 
that (1.15) holds for Onsager's lattice. 
The most interesting aspect of the impure Ising model with [see 
(XIV.3.11)]

( U 7 ) 
is that an interpretation of the "critical exponent" forms with finite 
critical exponents will not describe most of our results. In Sec. 2 we 
study <3KI(§)>B2 when Τ - Tc = 0(N~2) and © = O ^ " 1 ) . We find in 
(2.40) that as T-*· T~

(1.19) 
\ 
z2c/

and the subscript c means Τ = Tc. This is in conformity with (1.14a). 
However, we also find that 2Jli(£) is not an analytic function of ξ» at 
§ = 0 when Τ - Tc = 0(N'2). 
Most striking is the fact [see (2.55) and 
(2.68)] that there is a temperature range about Tc where 
/ m m \

When Τ < Tc we need the additional restriction that |δ| is not an integer. 
For the values of 8 at which C(8) is zero or infinity the form (1.20) breaks 
down. These exceptional values are studied also in Sec. 2. In particular, 
when Τ = Tc (δ = 0), (2.76) shows that

[377] 
RANDOM ISING M O D E L : BOUNDARY 
EFFECTS 
Therefore the "critical exponent" forms (1.14Z») and (1.14c) do not at all 
describe the behavior of <501ι(φ)>£2. Hence (1.15) implies that for our 
random Ising model y6ulk and 8buli do not exist. 
It is not surprising that forms (1.146) and (1.14c) are violated in our 
model because they are abstracted from calculations on Onsager's lattice 
in which the only relevant length scale is the coherence length ξ defined 
by (1.14e). In some sense our random lattice possesses two length scales, 
the coherence length ξ° of the pure Onsager lattice, which is known to be 
proportional to | Τ — Tc\~l, and some sort of length associated with the 
impurities. Because the specific heat computed in Chapter XIV deviates 
appreciably from its Onsager value only when Τ — Tc = 0(N ~2), we 
expect that this impurity length scale has the order of magnitude N2. 
In Sec. 3 we try to make these concepts more precise by studying 
<@i.i(w, 
when m = 0(N2), 
Τ - Tc = 0(N~2), 
and § = 
OiN'1). 
When 1 « m « Ν2 this average correlation function approaches its 
Onsager value. However, when m » Ν2 and Τ = Tc, (3.44) shows that 
<@i.i(w, 0)>£Ja=o ~ T W O + Zic)2JV-2(ln N~2m)-\ 
(1.23) 
Furthermore, (3.38) shows that, if the scaled temperature δ is of order 1 
and m »

(1.24) 
where 
4Γ(2|δ1) 
( ) ~ [r(ispra(2^/zac)(i + 
zlc)T>ι 
Therefore, the "critical exponent" forms (1.14</) and (1.14e) fail to 
describe the behavior of (<S1A(m, 0)>£2 near Tc and (1.15) implies that 
7)bulk and fbullt for Τ > Tc and Τ - Tc = 0(N~2) do not exist. 
Finally, it must be noted not only that the average values of the 
boundary spin correlation functions are of interest, but also that the 
probability distribution of these functions gives us additional insight into 
the microscopic details of the random Ising model. As presented in the 
references of footnote 1 the computation of this distribution is at the 
same time too complicated and too tentative to warrant inclusion in this 
book. We content ourselves with the remark that, when μ(λ) is given by 
(1.17), 53(3^!), the probability that SBj. takes on a certain value in the 
range </3Κι, when 9^(0 +) = 0(N_1) is, in leading order, given by

Similarly, we evaluate

The existence of the thermodynamic limit is equivalent to the existence 
of l i m j c ( l , Jf). This limit will, in general, be different for different 
lattices in our collection. Furthermore, C(j\ J f ) and D(j, J f ) obey the

Throughout this chapter we will make comparisons between quantities 
computed for the random lattice and for the corresponding Onsager 
lattice with the same E1 and Tc. For this Onsager lattice E2 = E2, where 
zìe1 (I — zlc)/(l + zu) = 1. When Ν is large, usually the difference 
between Ë2 and E% is important only in locating Tc, so that to leading 
order in N'1 we will often be able to replace E2 by E%. Quantities com-
puted in this lattice will be denoted by a superscript 0. 
We will confine our attention to the temperature region considered in 
Chapter XIV, where 
δ = (Γ - Tc)N24kßc(l + l/zL)[£i(l - zu) + £2°(1 - z°2c)] 
(2.16) 
is of order 1. In addition, it is easily seen from the expression for v(x), 
(XIV.4.4), that, unless ζ = 0(iV-1), (2.14) will not be sensibly different 
from its value for the Onsager lattice. 
We therefore define

book we will not need this constant and will not compute it. However, 
it is not without interest to study the manner in which (2.24) approaches 
its Onsager limit. For example, consider the case Τ = Tc and ζ -> oo. 
We write

the spontaneous magnetization and then will study the behavior when 
ζ ~ 0 for 8 > 0, δ < 0, and S = 0.

The average boundary spontaneous magnetization is defined to be

(3.25) 
This is precisely equal to the leading term of the Τ = TC,Q = 0 expansion 
of ©?,i(»z, 0) for large m given by (VII.8.42). Furthermore, this ap-
proaches its m 
oo limit as 1 jm. But since Τ φ Tc, this slow algebraic 
approach to the m 
oo limit contrasts dramatically with the exponential 
approach to the m - > c o limit exhibited by <ΒΊΛ(ηι, 0), and assumed by 
the "critical exponent" description of correlation functions discussed in 
the introduction.

This is clearly not equal to the leading term of the Τ = Tc, & = 0 ex-
pansion of ©Î,!(m, 0) given in Chapter VII, but it approaches it as 
m -> 0. When m is large, we have the asymptotic expansion

(3.30) 
Again we see that the approach to the m-+oo limit is algebraic rather 
than exponential. 
With the orientation provided by these two special cases, we turn to 
the general case and study the most interesting limiting cases of (3.22) : 
(α) δ fixed, m -*• 0; (b) δ Φ 0 fixed, m -»• 00 ; and (c) δ = 0, m -»• 00. 
(α) δ fixed, m 
0 
In this case, we expect to make contact with Chapter VII. In particular, 
we expect that when m ~ N~ 2 the term independent of Ν should agree 
with the Τ = Tc, m -> 00 behavior of ©ï.i(m, 0) given in (VII. 8.42). We 
have previously seen in the special cases |δ| = i and |δ| = f that this is 
the case but that in the case of |δ| = f the approach to this limit is 
somewhat complicated by the presence of terms involving In m. 
To study this limit in the general case, we note11 that for large ξ

As expected, when m ~ N ' 2 the term independent of Ν agrees with

The most unusual feature of (3.22) is its asymptotic behavior as 
m-> oo. We have already seen in the special cases |8| = \ and |δ| = § 
that this behavior is algebraic rather than exponential and is therefore

To see that this behavior holds for general values of δ we approximate

When Iδ| = £ or f the terms in Ilm that are explicitly given here agree 
with the preceding results. We may study the case |δ| = 1 by letting 
|S|

(3.39) 
When 0 < |δ| < 
the leading term in (3.38) is still correct, but the 
neglected terms of order 0(m~sw) 
are now larger than the retained 
terms of order 0{m~iW) 
and thus these higher terms are no longer 
meaningful. Indeed, when |δ| -» 0, (3.38) loses its validity altogether. 
(c) m -*• oo, δ = 0 
The final limiting case of <<Si,i(m, 0)>Ea to be considered is m-*· oo 
and Τ = Tc. This is the one temperature at which the "critical exponent" 
description allows a spin-spin correlation function to approach its 
limiting value in a power-law fashion as parameterized by (1.14d). In 
the bulk of the two-dimensional Ising model, η = i, whereas on the 
boundary»; = 1. However, we have justseen that, if|6| is made sufficiently 
small, in our random model, even if Τ Φ Tc, <@ia(m, 0)>£s may be 
made to approach its m -*• oo value in a power-law fashion with a power

as close to zero as we please. Therefore, it is expected that at Tc 
<@I,I(/m, 0))E2 will not be of the form (1.14</). To see that this is indeed 
so, we approximate12 for small ξ,
