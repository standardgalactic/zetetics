Abstract 
Brain-inspired hardware emulates the structure and working principles of a biological brain and 
may address the hardware bottleneck for fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI). Current brain-
20 
inspired silicon chips are promising but still limit their power to fully mimic brain function for AI 
computing. Here, we develop Brainoware, living AI hardware that harnesses the computation 
power of 3D biological neural networks in a brain organoid. Brain-like 3D in vitro cultures compute 
by receiving and sending information via a multielectrode array. Applying spatiotemporal electrical 
stimulation, this approach not only exhibits nonlinear dynamics and fading memory properties but 
25 
also learns from training data. Further experiments demonstrate real-world applications in solving 
non-linear equations. This approach may provide new insights into AI hardware.

Introduction 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the future of human life across various real-world fields such 
as industry, medicine, society, and education1. The remarkable success of AI has been largely 
driven by the rise of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which process vast numbers of real-world 
datasets (big data) using silicon computing chips 2, 3. However, current AI hardware keeps AI from 
5 
reaching its full potential since training ANNs on current computing hardware produces massive 
heat and is heavily time-consuming and energy-consuming 4-6, significantly limiting the scale, 
speed, and efficiency of ANNs. Moreover, current AI hardware is approaching its theoretical limit 
and dramatically decreasing its development no longer following ‘Moore’s law’7, 8, and facing 
challenges stemming from the physical separation of data from data-processing units known as 
10 
the 'von Neumann bottleneck'9, 10. Thus, AI needs a hardware revolution8, 11. 
 
A breakthrough in AI hardware may be inspired by the structure and function of a human brain, 
which has a remarkably efficient ability, known as natural intelligence (NI), to process and learn 
from spatiotemporal information. For example, a human brain forms a 3D living complex biological 
15 
network of about 200 billion cells linked to one another via hundreds of trillions of nanometer-
sized synapses12, 13. Their high efficiency renders a human brain to be ideal hardware for AI. 
Indeed, a typical human brain expands a power of about 20 watts, while current AI hardware 
consumes about 8 million watts to drive a comparative ANN6. Moreover, the human brain could 
effectively process and learn information from noisy data with minimal training cost by neuronal 
20 
plasticity and neurogenesis,14, 15 avoiding the huge energy consumption in doing the same job by 
current high precision computing approaches12, 13. The human brain fuses data storage and 
processes within biological neural networks (BNNs),16-18 naturally avoiding any ‘von Neumann 
bottleneck’ issues. Learning from BNNs, pioneering attempts have been made to develop high-
efficiency and low-cost neuromorphic chips (e.g., memristor)11, 19, 20 that store previously 
25 
experienced current or/and voltage in internal states and enable short-term memory 21-23. So far, 
neuromorphic chips have been used for various applications in computer vision,24-26 speech 
recognition,27, 28 and others 29, 30. However, current neuromorphic chips can only mimic partial 
features of brain functions, and there are tremendous needs to improve their processing capability 
for real-life uncertainty and energy efficiency.  
30 
 
Brain organoids are in vitro 3D aggregates derived through the self-organization and 
differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells that become brain-like tissues with a remarkable 
ability to recapitulate aspects of a developing brain’s structure and function31-34. Herein, we 
develop Brainoware, living AI hardware that harnesses the computation and on-chip learning of 
35 
3D biological neural networks in a brain organoid (Fig. 1a). Brainoware processes and learns 
from spatiotemporal information through the neuroplasticity of the brain organoid. Compared to 
current 2D in vitro neuronal cultures and neuromorphic chips, Brainoware may provide new 
insights for AI computing, because brain organoids can provide 3D BNNs with remarkable 
advances in complexity, connectivity, neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis, all accomplished with 
40 
low energy consumption and fast learning.

organoid for Brainoware was characterized by various brain cell identities (e.g., early-stage and 
mature neurons, astrocytes, neuron progenitor cells), and early development brain-like structures 
(e.g., including ventricular zones and subventricular zones) for the formation, function, and 
maintenance of complex 3D neuronal networks (Fig. 1c), as well as network electrical activity. 
The mature organoid neural networks (ONNs) could receive inputs via external electrical 
5 
stimulation and send outputs via evoked neural activity, offering a functional basis for AI 
computing. As a proof-of-concept application, we implemented Brainoware as an AI hardware to 
solve real-world problems. In a conventional AI computing hardware, input signals can be mapped 
into higher dimensional computational spaces through the dynamics of a hardware. Given input 
signals, the output of hardware is used as features for a simple “readout function” to perform a 
10 
computational task, e.g., time-series analysis. While the conventional computing chips are fixed, 
the readout function is trained to map the feature values generated by the hardware to the desired 
labels of the data. Different from conventional AI computing hardware with fixed physical 
reservoirs, Brainoware uses mature human brain organoids as dynamic, living network to conduct 
“unsupervised learning” to adapt to the signals and perform “feature engineering”. Via these living 
15 
reservoirs, the time-dependent inputs can be converted to spatiotemporal sequences of electric 
stimulation and then projected into computational spaces as ONNs. The output signals, as neural 
activities, can be effectively utilized via the pre-trained readout function for various tasks (Fig. 1a). 
Moreover, through training using spatiotemporal sequences of electrical stimulation, Brainoware 
can improve its computing performance and demonstrate on-chip learning ability by synaptic 
20 
plasticity. This is possible because Brainoware responds to the electric stimulations with changes 
in neuronal connections, and neuroplasticity of the organoids, enabling dynamic reshaping of 
ONNs. If synaptic plasticity is blocked, computing performance is maintained by Brainoware (but 
on-chip learning halts) (Fig. 1d, Fig. 3d). In the next experiments, Brainoware was demonstrated 
to exhibit unique properties of a physical reservoir and successfully conduct some real-world tasks 
25 
with limited training data at low energy and computing cost. 
 
Characterization of hardware property.  Before applying Brainoware to AI computing tasks, we 
characterized and demonstrated its basic implementation as a AI hardware. We tested the 
physical reservoir properties of Brainoware such as nonlinear dynamics, fading memory (or short-
30 
term memory), and spatial information processing by checking the response of ONNs to bipolar 
voltage pulse stimulations with different pulse time (tp) and voltage (vp). For example, while 
applying electrical stimulation pulses to Brainoware, the evoked neuronal activity (raster plot) was 
recorded, and the post-stimulation histogram was calculated and plotted (Fig. 2b). We 
demonstrated that Brainoware exhibited a representative nonlinear response to the pulse voltage 
35 
(Fig. 2b). After applying a single voltage pulse stimulation (tp  >= 200 μs), the evoked mean 
normalized firing rate of Brainoware  (over 200 ms post-stimulation) to the pulse voltage can be 
fitted with a sigmoid function, in accordance with the nonlinear activation function of ANNs. While 
applying a single voltage pulse stimulation with short pulse times (tp  < 200 μs), the evoked 
normalized firing of Brainoware with the same organoid was only around the baseline of its 
40 
spontaneous activity. Next, we tested the fading memory of Brainoware by applying pulses with 
different pulse times and voltages. The evoked normalized firing of Brainoware before and after 
100 ms or 300 ms from the end of single pulse stimulation was obtained (Fig. 2c). Pulses with 
longer duration and higher voltage were responsible for stronger evoked response and slower 
relaxation dynamics. Importantly, the nonlinear response and fading dynamics of ONNs can be

well controlled by precisely adjusting the stimulation parameters. Moreover, we also 
demonstrated the combination of these two properties within Brainoware. After the application of 
four individual trains of pulses (vp = 200mV, tp = 300 μs), Brainoware showed both the 
accumulation and decay dynamic responses (Fig. 2d). Multiple pulses at short intervals (50 ms) 
within a pulse train were responsible for the gradual increase of evoked responses and the delay 
5 
of relaxation dynamics, in accordance with the dynamic response of a memristor, a typical 
reservoir computing hardware. Furthermore, we demonstrated the capability of Brainoware to 
process spatial information. The spatial information was converted into spatial patterns of 
simulation pulses (vp = 500mV, tp = 500 μs) such as two 4 x 4 spatial patterns (P1 and P2). The 
distinct raster plots of Brainoware with the same organoid were evoked by these two 
10 
complementary patterns and showed the active storage and gradual loss of different spatial 
information over time (Fig. 2e), indicating spatial information processing rather than stimulation 
artifacts. 
 
Solving a non-linear chaotic equation.  We further applied Brainoware to predict a Hénon map, 
15 
which is a typical non-linear dynamic system with chaotic behavior. This time-series task was 
implemented into Brainoware using a brief workflow as shown in Fig.3a. A 2D Hénon map was 
first converted into a 1D decomposition, converted into the spatiotemporal sequences of bipolar 
voltage pulses, and then sent to the MEA electrodes for stimulating Brainoware. Using a read-out 
algorithm for decoding the ONN activity, Brainoware harnessed its reservoir computation and on-
20 
chip learning to learn from the input spatiotemporal pulses and predict the Hénon map. 
Experiments were conducted to predict the Hénon map (Xn+1 value) by feeding Brainoware with 
spatiotemporal pulses encoded with Xn value. 1D decomposition (Fig.3b) and 2D displacement 
(Fig.3c) of predicted Hénon maps were experimentally obtained from Brainoware with the same 
organoid before and after four training epochs (one epoch per day, and each epoch encoded with 
25 
a Hénon map dataset of 200 data points). Compared with the theoretical output (ground truth, 
black), the after-training condition (red) showed better-predicted results than the before-training 
condition (blue). Next, the learning curves of Brainoware to solve this non-linear chaotic equation 
were measured over epochs (Fig.3d). The regression score of Brainoware in predicting Xn+1 value 
was used to evaluate its learning ability to solve the Hénon map. Interestingly, Brainoware 
30 
increased the regression score (detailed calculation in SI) from 0.356  0.071 (with the naïve 
organoids on Day 1) to 0.812  0.043 (the same organoids after four training epochs). While 
treated with a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) blocker, K252a, to block 
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity,35 the negative control group only slightly improved their 
regression score from 0.31  0.072 to 0.385  0.063 over the same training procedures. The 
35 
results indicated that the learning activity of Brainoware was dependent on neural plasticity. 
Furthermore, experiments were performed to measure the on-chip learning activities of 
Brainoware under different conditions (Fig. 3e). Only an MEA chip and culture medium (blank) 
was tested to have a regression score of 0, emphasizing that Brainoware cannot compute without 
the living organoids. We further compared Brainoware with representative machine learning 
40 
algorithms such as ANN on solving the Hénon map of the same data size (Fig. 3f). Linear 
regression (decoding algorithm of Brainoware) could barely solve this problem, showing a 
regression score close to 0. Brainoware significantly outperformed ANN without a long short-term 
memory (LSTM) unit. Brainoware (with 4 training epochs) showed slightly lower accuracy than 
ANN with LSTM (each with 50 training epochs), decreasing training times by >90%.

Discussion 
We have demonstrated a new class of living hardware for AI computing that harnesses the 
computational power of living neural networks of human brain organoids. Human brain organoids 
have unique characteristics and the ability to self-organize and form functional BNNs for 
5 
developing brain-inspired AI hardware. Moreover, ONNs may have the necessary complexity and 
diversity to mimic a human brain, inspiring more sophisticated and human-like AI systems. 
Furthermore, due to the high plasticity and adaptability of organoids, Brainoware has the flexibility 
to change and reorganize in response to electrical stimulation, highlighting its ability to learn and 
adapt over training, necessary for developing AI systems. As living brain-like AI hardware, this 
10 
approach may naturally address the time-consuming, energy-consuming, and heat production 
challenges of current AI hardware. We further demonstrated that this approach exhibits physical 
reservoir properties such as nonlinear dynamics, fading memory, and spatial information 
processing.  We also implemented it in real-world applications such as solving non-linear 
equations. We found that this approach learns from training data by reshaping the neuronal 
15 
connections of ONNs. 
 
There are several limitations and challenges for the current Brainoware approach. One technical 
challenge is the generation and maintenance of organoids. Despite the successful establishment 
of various protocols, current organoids are still suffering from high heterogeneity, low generation 
20 
throughput, and various viabilities. Moreover, it is critical to properly maintain and support 
organoids for harvesting their computational power. Recent engineering efforts on optimizing 
organoid differentiation and growth conditions and manipulating their microenvironments may 
provide approaches for the high-throughput generation and maintenance of standardized 
organoids36. Brainoware uses flat and rigid MEA electrodes for interfacing with organoids, which 
25 
are only able to stimulate/record a small number of neurons on the organoid surface. There is a 
tremendous need to develop methods such as brain-machine interfaces, soft electrodes, and 
other neural implants for interfacing the whole organoid with AI hardware and software 37, 38, 
allowing for the exchange of information and the manipulation of their activity from a greater 
number of neurons. Another technical challenge is the management and analysis of data. The 
30 
encoding and decoding of temporospatial information to and from Brainoware still need 
optimization by improving data interpretation, extraction, and processing from multiple sources 
and modalities. Moreover, large amounts of data may be generated by this new AI hardware, 
requiring the development of new algorithms and methods for analyzing and visualizing the data.   
 
35 
In sum, we developed a prototype of brain-inspired living AI hardware with on-chip learning ability. 
We also demonstrated their real-world applications to speech recognition and solving non-linear 
equations. This approach may provide new insights into AI hardware.

characterization of organoids are included in the supplementary materials.

Fig. 1. Brainoware with on-chip learning for AI computing. a, Schematics of reservoir 
computation with on-chip learning using Brainoware. b, A schematic paradigm of Brainoware 
setup that mounts a brain organoid onto a multielectrode array for receiving inputs and sending 
outputs. c, Whole-mount immunostaining of cortical organoids showing complex 3D neuronal 
networks with various brain cell identities (e.g., mature neuron, MAP2; astrocyte GFAP; neurons 
10 
of early differentiation stage, TuJ1; and neural progenitor cells, SOX2). d, Schematic diagram 
demonstrating on-chip learning of Brainoware via reshaping of the biological neural network 
during training, and the inhibition of on-chip learning after synaptic plasticity is blocked. (Scale bar 
= 100 μm)

Fig. 2. Characterization of hardware property. a, Evoked response (raster plot and post-
stimulation histogram) upon single bipolar voltage pulse stimulation.  b, Evoked normalized firing 
upon pulses with different pulse times (tp) and pulse voltage (vp) (mean ± s.e.m., n = 6, 
5 
independent experiments).  The red fitting curve (a sigmoid function) indicates the nonlinear 
activity, while the black dashed line marks the spontaneous activity. c, Evoked normalized firing 
before and after, 100 ms or 300 ms, from the end of single pulse stimulation (mean ± s.e.m., n 
= 4, independent experiments). d, Representative memristor-liked responses to a stream of 
pulses (vp = 200mV, tp = 300 μs). e, Distinct raster plots evoked by two complementary spatial 
10 
patterns (P1 and P2) of stimulation pulses (vp = 500 mV, tp = 500 μs).
