Representation: CSG-Tree
Representation: CSG Tree
CSG objects can be represented by binary trees, where leaves
represent primitives, and nodes represent operations.

Representation of 3D Models
Representation
3D models can be divided into two categories
Shell/boundary
Solid
models represent the surface of
the object, not its volume
models deﬁne the volume of the
object

Volumetric 3D Modeling
Marching Cubes
The Marching Cubes Algorithm
published by Lorensen and
Cline in 1987,
creates triangle models of
constant density surfaces
processes 3D data in
scan-line order from multiple
2D slices and calculates
triangle vertices using linear
interpolation
