Abstract
Asclepios1 is the name of a research project team oﬃcially launched on
November 1st, 2005 at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, to study the Analysis
and Simulation of Biological and Medical Images. This research project
team follows a previous one, called Epidaure, initially dedicated to
Medical Imaging and Robotics research. These two project teams
were strongly supported by Gilles Kahn, who used to have regular
scientiﬁc interactions with their members. More generally, Gilles Kahn
had a unique vision of the growing importance of the interaction of
the Information Technologies and Sciences with the Biological and
Medical world. He was one of the originators of the creation of a speciﬁc
BIO theme among the main INRIA research directions, which now
regroups 16 diﬀerent research teams including Asclepios, whose research
objectives are described and illustrated in this article.
18.1 Introduction
18.1.1 The revolution of biomedical images and quantitative
medicine
There is an irreversible evolution of medical practice toward more quanti-
tative and personalized decision processes for prevention, diagnosis and
therapy. This evolution is supported by a continually increasing number
of biomedical devices providing in vivo measurements of structures and
processes inside the human body, at scales varying from the organ to
1 Asclepios was a Greek hero who later became the Greek god of medicine and
healing. His most famous sanctuary was located in Epidaurus which is situated in
the northeastern Peloponnese (from Ron Leadbetter).

the cellular and even molecular level. Among all these measurements,
biomedical images of various forms increasingly play a central role.
Facing the need for more quantitative and personalized medicine
based on larger and more complex sets of measurements, there is a
crucial need for developing: (1) advanced image analysis tools capable
of extracting the pertinent information from biomedical images and
signals; (2) advanced models of the human body to correctly interpret
this information; (3) large distributed databases to calibrate and
validate these models.
18.1.2 Advanced biomedical image analysis
Tremendous progress has been made in the automated analysis of
biomedical images during the past decades. [16, 3].2 For instance, for
rigid parts of the body such as the head, it is now possible to fuse, in a
completely automated manner, images of the same patient taken from
diﬀerent imaging modalities (e.g. anatomical and functional), or to track
the evolution of a pathology through the automated registration and
comparison of a series of images taken at widely spaced time instants
[20, 42] (see Fig. 18.1). It is also possible to obtain from a magnetic
resonance image of the head an adequate segmentation into skull tissues,
white matter, grey matter, and cerebro-spinal ﬂuid [43], or to measure
certain functional properties of the heart from dynamic sequences of
magnetic resonance [2], ultrasound or nuclear medicine images [22].
Despite these advances one may note that statistical models of
anatomy are still very crude, resulting in poor registration results
in deformable regions of the body, or between diﬀerent subjects. If
some algorithms exploit the physical modeling of the image acquisition
process, only a few actually model the physical or even physiological
properties of the human body itself. Coupling biomedical image analysis
with anatomical and physiological models of the human body would not
only provide a better comprehension of the observed images and signals,
but would in addition provide eﬃcient tools to detect anomalies, to
predict the evolution of diseases and to simulate and assess the eﬀect of
therapies.
2 One can gain a good understanding of the state of the art from the proceedings of
the most recent conferences MICCAI (Medical Image Computing and Computer
Assisted Intervention) or ISBI (Int. Symp. on Biomedical Imaging) as well as from
the most recent issues of journals like IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging or Medical
Image Analysis.

18.1.3 Computational models of anatomy and physiology
Computational models of the human body constitute an emerging and
rapidly progressing area of research whose objective is to provide a better
understanding of anatomical variability (computational anatomy) and of
the major functions of the human body (computational physiology), as
well as to provide eﬀective algorithmic tools for their realistic numerical
simulations [4, 14, 5].
Quite advanced models have already been proposed to study at the
molecular, cellular and organic level a number of physiological systems
(e.g. cardiac, respiratory, digestive, nervous (central and peripheric),
reproductive, etc. [24]). For instance, computational models of the heart
have been proposed to interpret the cardiac electromechanical activity
from medical images and electrophysiological measurements [6, 9], or
to study the properties of physiological ﬂows in blood vessels [33], in
order to predict the appearance of cardiovascular diseases. Computa-
tional models have also been proposed to explore the structures and
the activity of the brain from anatomical and functional images and
signals, for instance to better understand a number of brain diseases
(e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease,
epilepsy or schizophrenia) [13]. Advanced models of abdominal organs
including the liver [14] and the intestine [21] have been developed
in the context of image-guided surgery (cf. Fig. 18.2) and surgery

simulation (cf. Fig. 18.3). Other models have been developed to predict
the evolution of cancerous lesions in various organs [39, 38, 25].
It is necessary but not suﬃcient to develop, reﬁne and validate such
models. In addition, new methods must be designed to automatically ﬁt
the model parameters to a given person from the available biomedical
signals (in particular medical images) and also from prior genetic
information. Building such patient-speciﬁc models is a challenging goal
which requires in particular the development of new data assimilation
methods which can cope with massive numbers of measurements and
unknowns.
18.1.4 Large distributed databases
Another important milestone towards progress in these directions is
the development of large databases of subjects and patients, including
biomedical signals and images as well as genetic information, and
the development of speciﬁc tools to correlate, for instance, the shape
and evolution of anatomical structures (phenotype) with the genetic
information (genotype) and/or with a certain number of pathologies.

G. Picinbono, C. Forest et al. [12, 32, 18]).
The construction and exploitation of such databases require the
development of speciﬁc measurement platforms which can regroup
cutting edge imaging facilities with easy access provided to internal and
external research teams (e.g. the Neurospin3 platform of CEA).
Huge computing power is already required to run advanced computa-
tional models in their direct mode (for prediction) or inverse mode (to
adapt to a speciﬁc patient from biomedical measurements). The amount
of required computing power to process large databases will require the
development of grid-enabled algorithms capable of exploiting distributed
computing power and data in large international networks [23].
18.2 From Epidaure to Asclepios
To address the above issues, the Asclepios research project team was
launched on November 1st, 2005 at INRIA Sophia Antipolis after

ﬁnal approval by the INRIA CEO Gilles Kahn. It built on the results
of the previous research project team Epidaure, initially launched at
INRIA Rocquencourt in 1989 and later installed in Sophia-Antipolis in
October 1992 thanks to the strong support of Gilles Kahn and Pierre
Bernhard (at the time respectively VP for Science and Director of
INRIA Sophia-Antipolis). The original scientiﬁc objectives were the
quantitative analysis of medical images and the coupling of medical
imaging with medical robotics and surgery simulation.
Some of the major contributions of the Epidaure project were
published in an invited article in the IEEE Transactions on Medical
Imaging in November 2003 [3]. The Epidaure team has contributed,
in association with a number of other teams, to the establishment of
medical image analysis and simulation as a very distinct discipline in the
ﬁeld of computer science, with its own scientiﬁc community, its scientiﬁc
peer-reviewed journals and conferences. In particular we contributed
to the founding of the Medical Image Analysis journal (MedIA) and
the MICCAI conference (Medical Image Computing and Computer
Assisted Intervention), again with the encouragement of Gilles Kahn
who attended the precursor conference CVRMed’95 (Computer Vision,
Virtual Reality and Robotics in Medicine) organized by INRIA in Nice
in April 1995, and the MICCAI’04 conference organized by INRIA in
Saint-Malo in September 2004.
18.2.1 Personalized models for diagnosis and therapy
If several of the problems listed in the original 1989 Epidaure research
proposal have been solved, some important ones remain and new
challenging problems have appeared. The research objectives of the
Asclepios proposal take into account this situation and are organized
around ﬁve research directions, namely: (1) medical image analysis;
(2) biological image analysis; (3) computational anatomy; (4) computa-
tional physiology; (5) clinical and biological validation. Only directions 1
and (part of) 5 correspond to a continuation of the research objectives
of the former Epidaure project, whereas directions 2, 3 and 4 correspond
to novel objectives related to emerging problems.
Figure 18.4 attempts to summarize the overall objectives of the
Asclepios project. The computational models of the human body that
we consider often have four diﬀerent primary components which we
characterize as geometry, statistics, physics and physiology. In order to
personalize a generic model, it is necessary to identify its parameters

by confronting it to a set of patient-speciﬁc biomedical images and
other biomedical signals. The personalized model can then, in turn, be
projected back onto the images and signals to better interpret them,
and to provide support for the diagnosis of disease. The personalized
model can also be used to predict the evolution of disease, or to plan
and simulate an intervention. This provides support for the prevention
and therapy of diseases.
In the remainder of this article we provide four illustrations of
several aspects of current research in Asclepios respectively on: (a)
the automatic measurement of the variability of the geometry of some
brain structures; (b) the simulation of the growth of personalized brain
tumors; (c) the simulation of personalized electromechanical activity of
cardiac ventricles; (d) the construction of large mosaics of microscopic
molecular images acquired in vivo and in situ. We conclude with a
summary section.
18.3 Measuring brain variability from sulcal lines
The objective of computational anatomy is the modeling and analysis of
biological variability of the human anatomy.4 Typical applications cover
the simulation of average anatomies and normal variations, the discovery
of structural diﬀerences between healthy and diseased populations, and
the detection and classiﬁcation of pathologies from structural anomalies.

Studying the variability of biological shapes is an old problem (cf.
the remarkable book On Growth and Form by D’Arcy Thompson [40]).
Signiﬁcant eﬀorts have been made since that time to develop a theory of
statistical shape analysis, refer to [15] for a good synthesis, to a speciﬁc
special issue of Neuroimage [41] or more recently to the ﬁrst international
workshop on the Mathematical Foundations of Computational Anatomy
organized by Xavier Pennec and Sarang Joshi at MICCAI’2006 [30].
Computational anatomy lies at the intersection of geometry, statistics
and medical image analysis. A three-stage approach to computing
statistics on anatomical shapes was proposed by Miller in [27]: (1)
construction
from
medical
images
of
anatomically
representative
manifolds based on feature points, curves, surfaces and volumes); (2)
assignment of a point-to-point correspondence between these manifolds
(possibly through a restricted class of geometric transformations, e.g.
rigid, aﬃne, diﬀeomorphism); (3) generation of probability laws of
anatomical variation from these correspondences.
We provide below an illustration of a similar approach applied
to the study of the variability of certain brain cortical structures.
Through a longstanding collaboration5 with the LONI research group
of UCLA (Professor Paul Thompson), we developed a method to
study the variability of the so-called sulcal lines, which are deﬁned by
neuroanatomists as the bottoms of brain cortical foldings. These lines
can be extracted and labeled manually by experts (in our case on a
database of 700 subjects), or automatically by expert systems such as
the one developed at CEA by the group led by J.F. Mangin [35].
Figure 18.5 shows a typical set of sulcal lines extracted on the cortical
surface of a brain of the LONI database. Together with Arsigny6 and
Fillard, we developed an original approach to register all the images of
the database to a common reference frame after an aﬃne normalization,
followed by an individual alignment of all homologous sulcal lines. This
enabled us to compute for each sulcal line an average sulcal line, and
along each of these lines a local measure of variability under the form of
covariance matrix computed at regularly sampled points.
As a result of new metrics deﬁned in the space of symmetric positive
deﬁnite matrices (also called “tensors” in our community), we were able
to propose a method to extrapolate this local measure of variability to

the whole cortex in a plausible manner [29, 1]. We see in Figure 18.6
a color representation of the variability measured in various regions of
the brain which quantitatively conﬁrms previous observations made on
a more qualitative basis by neuroanatomists. These results are published
in [17].
Statistical information about variability can be used to help guide the
superposition of a brain atlas to the brain images of a speciﬁc patient.
This was shown with a diﬀerent statistical database and in an image-
guided radiotherapy context by Commowick et al. in [11].
Another study, conducted during the PhD work of Boisvert [8],
concerned the statistical analysis of the variability of the scoliotic
spine. By using an articulated model based on the relative position
and orientation of successive vertebrae (through rigid body transfor-
mations), we were able to estimate the variability of the spine shape
over a database of more than 300 patients. This was used to assess the
evolution of the deformation during orthopedic treatments; moreover,
the ﬁrst four modes of variation appeared to be closely correlated to
the usual clinical classiﬁcation of scolioses, which reinforces the clinical
interest of the chosen approach. Figure 18.7 illustrates a typical result.
18.4 Simulation of tumor growth
Combining anatomical, physical and physiological models of the human
body is part of the computational physiology research ﬁeld, to which
the next two examples belong. The ﬁrst concerns the simulation of
diﬀusive tumor growth based on medical images. The objective is to
identify the parameters of a generic dynamic model from a suﬃcient

number of observations on a speciﬁc patient, in order to better charac-
terize the nature of the observed tumor. This image-based characteri-
zation of the tumor aims at better predicting its plausible evolution, and
anticipating the eﬀects of possible therapies (e.g. radiotherapy, surgery,
chemotherapy).
The work described in [10] includes three main levels of modeling: the
ﬁrst is geometrical and includes the extraction of the main structures
of the head from a set of multisequence magnetic resonance images
(MRIs). Among these structures are: (1) the skull, (2) the gray and
(3) the white matter of the brain, (4) the cerebrospinal ﬂuid and (5)
the falx cerebri. Figure 18.8 shows a typical representation of these
structures. The accurate geometric description of these structures is

important because the proliferation and migration of glial tumor cells
strongly depend on the nature of the tissues and also on the orientation
of the white matter ﬁbers.
The second level of modeling refers to biomechanics. The aim is to
simulate the deformation of the brain induced by the tumor growth,
also called the “mass eﬀect”. We built a ﬁnite element model of the
previously extracted head structures under the hypothesis of inhomo-
geneous isotropic linear elastic behavior of the biological tissues.
Linearity is a reasonable assumption to impose since the amplitude
of the deformations is small. Inhomogeneity takes into account the
mechanical variability of the tissues.
The third level of modeling concerns the physiopathology of the
tumor itself. We consider a macroscopic description of the tumor cell
density through a Fisher–Kolmogorov reaction diﬀusion equation. The
reaction component is a second order polynomial which corresponds to a

logistic proliferation law: exponential increase of number of cells followed
by a reduced proliferation rate until an asymptotic value is reached.
The diﬀusion component models the migration of tumor cells in their
neighborhood. Because glioma cell migration is preferentially along the
white matter ﬁbers, the main bundles of white matter ﬁbers are included
in the model, through diﬀusion tensor MRI. The biomechanical coupling
with the reaction–diﬀusion equation is introduced in the constitutive
equation through a local pressure proportional to the tumor cell density.
Figure 18.9 shows a simulation of the progression of a glioblastoma

period,

observations and simulations. The identiﬁcation of the parameters of the
model followed an interactive and semi-automatic procedure. Currently
the PhD work of Konukoglu [26] is seeking to identify automatically
these parameters from the observations at two time points, and to
measure the predictive power of the model against a third time point.
Once validated, we believe that such models could be used to better
delineate, for instance, the dosimetry planning in radiotherapy, by
proposing a margin outside of the visible contours of the tumor which
would take into account the actual proliferation and diﬀusion parameters
of the model, as well as the privileged directions of the main white
matter ﬁbers (Fig. 18.10).

Building a personalized electro-mechanical model of the heart ventricles
is an important precursor to the simulation and analysis of the electrical
or mechanical activity of the heart of a speciﬁc patient.

We began research on this topic at INRIA about seven years
ago through a collaborative action ICEMA7 funded by the scientiﬁc
management of INRIA. This collaborative action was followed closely
and supported by Gilles Kahn. It involved several project teams at
INRIA including Sosso, Caiman, Epidaure, Opale and Macs, as well as
external research groups at NIH (Mc Veigh), Guy’s Hospital (Razavi),
and Philips (G´erard). This collaboration was reinforced more recently
through a speciﬁc INRIA consortium called CardioSense3D,8 currently
involving the INRIA project teams Asclepios, Macs, Reo and Sisyphe,
as well as the NIH, Guy’s Hospital and Philips research groups.
The current models again include three levels of description [36].
The ﬁrst is a geometrical description of the anatomy of the cardiac
ventricles, which is adapted to the speciﬁc geometry of a given patient
through image processing methods. The direction of the cardiac ﬁbers
is projected onto this geometric model by automatically mapping an
average description which comes from a previous statistical analysis [31].
The second level of modeling is a macroscopic description of the
evolution of the action potential of cardiac cells, which measures the
diﬀerence between the extra-cellular and the intra-cellular electrical
potentials. This evolution is modeled through a set of reaction diﬀusion
equations (initially proposed by FitzHugh and Nagumo, and later
reﬁned by Aliev and Panﬁlov). These equations take into account the
higher conductivity in the direction of the ﬁbers at each point of the
previous geometrical description, and enable the realistic simulation of
the depolarization and repolarization waves within the cardiac tissues.
The third level of modeling is the electro-mechanical coupling
which describes how the action potential variations actually control
the contraction and the relaxation of the cardiac ﬁbers. We chose a
macroscopic model due to Bestel, Cl´ement and Sorine [7]: a set of
partial diﬀerential equations combines locally the behavior of an active
elastic contractile element controlled by the previous action potential,
with in addition two passive elastic elements respectively in parallel and
in series. This model, initially inspired by the model of Hill-Maxwell is
based on a multiscale analysis from the nanoscopic to the macroscopic
scale. We see in Figure 18.11 an illustration of the realistic simulation
of the contraction of a generic instance of this model.

The personalization of such a generic model must then be done
through a set of speciﬁc measurements obtained through cardiac
imaging (e.g. ultrasound, magnetic resonance, computed tomography
or nuclear medicine imaging) as well as electrophysiology (typically
the electrocardiogram or ECG). This is a diﬃcult inverse problem
which can be attacked through several strategies (cf. for instance [37]).
Figure 18.12 shows the personalization of the model obtained through
tagged magnetic resonance imaging and speciﬁc electrophysiological
measurements obtained with an endovascular procedure.
The future objectives of this research include the simulation of various
therapies, like for instance cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), or
radiofrequency ablation procedures, or the eﬀect of stem cells therapy.
18.6 Building large mosaics of microscopic images
The last example concerns microscopic imagery. During the past
few years, we have initiated a research on the digital processing of
microscopic images acquired in vivo and in situ. This was made possible
through the development of new imaging devices enabling the acquisition
of confocal microscopic images at the end of a very thin optical probe.
The probe can be introduced in the operator canal of an endoscope in

order to provide images of the cellular architecture of suspicious tissues
on line. This operation can also be seen as an “optical biopsy”.
One of the issues with this type of imaging is the limited ﬁeld of
view of the microscopic images: because such images have a resolution

431
of the order of a micron, the ﬁeld of view is usually limited to a few
hundreds of microns. This poses a problem when the analysis of the
cellular architecture requires a larger ﬁeld of view (this can be the case,
for instance, when observing human colonic crypts), or when certain
statistical measurements require a larger number of cells or vessels,
or simply when it is necessary to reposition the probe exactly in a
given location (when doing a temporal series of images at distant time
points to study a slow dynamic phenomenon for instance). Through a
collaboration with the Mauna Kea Technology company, Vercauteren
[44] proposed, during his PhD research, a method to build a larger
scene from the video sequence of microscopic images acquired during
a smooth motion of the acquisition probe. The mosaic of images is
obtained by replacing all of them in a common reference frame. This is
a diﬃcult problem because of the possible deformations induced by the
motion of the probe and the non-rigid nature of the observed tissues.
Figure 18.13 shows a typical example of the reconstruction of such a
mosaic. Other work on the construction of large mosaics of 3-D confocal
images acquired from in vitro samples can be found in [19].
18.7 Conclusion
We have outlined and illustrated in this article the current research
objectives of the Asclepios project at INRIA, whose main application
areas are in medicine and biology. The pharmaceutical domain is also
an application area, as computational models of the human body can be
exploited to better predict and quantify the eﬀects of new drugs.
We believe strongly that the development of advanced biomedical
image analysis methods combined with speciﬁc computational models
of living systems will lead to a more profound understanding of the
anatomy and physiology of the human body, and of the correlation
between anatomical or physiological anomalies with the development
of certain pathologies. We also believe that this research eﬀort will
be helpful to better exploit the huge amount of available biomedical
signals (from in vivo molecular and cellular imaging to macroscopic
organ imaging) as well as the genetic information potentially available
on each patient.
An important clinical objective will be to increase signiﬁcantly
the potential for pre-symptomatic diagnosis and early treatment for
a maximum medical eﬃciency. This research could also help the
simulation and evaluation of various therapies, in particular traditional

It should also contribute to the promotion of image guided therapies.
Gilles Kahn strongly encouraged this research while he was the
scientiﬁc director of INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, later the Vice-President for
Science, and ﬁnally the CEO of INRIA. Through his numerous scientiﬁc
interactions with the researchers involved, through his exceptional
vision of the future, he stimulated this activity and gave those scientists
the necessary conﬁdence to explore new directions sometimes far away
from their traditional background. For all these reasons we are proud
to dedicate this article to the memory of Gilles Kahn.
