Abstract
A proposal is made for a fundamental theory, in which the history of the universe
is constituted of views of itself. Views are attributes of events, and the theory’s only
be-ables; they comprise information about energy and momentum transferred to an
event from its causal past. A dynamics is proposed for a universe constituted of views
of events, which combines the energetic causal set dynamics with a potential energy
based on a measure of the distinctiveness of the views, called the variety[14]. As in
the real ensemble formulation of quantum mechanics[11], quantum pure states are
associated to ensembles of similar events; the quantum potential of Bohm then arises
from the variety.

Introduction
In this paper, I would like to propose a new ontology for physics, in which the history
of the universe is constituted of views of itself. A view is, roughly, what would be seen
from an event. More precisely, in a particle formulation, the view of an event is the set of
incoming energy-momentum vectors which coincide or interact at the event. These can
be represented as a punctured two-sphere, with labels. The position of a puncture on the
S2 represents the incident direction of a photon, or other particle, incoming to an event,
while the label represents its energy.
An event also has a set of outgoing energy-momentum vectors which convey energy-
momentum to other events. These constitute the causal future of the event. Hence, the
transmissions of energy-momentum generate a causal structure1. One name for the the-
ory to be presented here is then a causal theory of views.
Along with a new ontology, I propose a new framework for a fundamental theory
of physics. In it, gravity is not quantized, rather we propose a common completion for
quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here we show how non-relativistic quantum
mechanics emerges in a suitable limit. In previous papers we have show how a theory
1Causal set models of quantum spacetime were introduced in[1]. Energetic causal set models differ from
other spacetime-free causal set approaches, e.g. [6] proposed causal sets based on quantum information
processing systems, and ref [7] proposed causal sets constructed out of standard model particles.
2

of interacting particles, moving in an emergent Minkowski spacetime, arises[2, 3, 4]. The
remaining step of showing how general relativity emerges is saved for a later paper.
This proposal is inspired by Leibniz’s Monadology, and is also a combination and
continuation of three recent developments: the energetic causal set model[2]-[5] we de-
veloped with Marina Cortes, relative locality[8, 9], which we developed with Amelino-
Camelia, Freidel and Kowalski-Glickmann, and the real ensemble approach to quan-
tum mechanics[10, 11].
In different ways each of these three approaches expresses a
common foundation in relationalism and the hypothesis that time is fundamental and
irreversible[12, 13], but there is a more speciﬁc connection, which will be spelled out
shortly.
The fact that the views are described in terms of punctured two-spheres makes contact
with loop quantum gravity, where Hilbert spaces of observables that live on boundaries of
quantum spacetime live on punctured two-spheres[20]. This connection will be discussed
elsewhere, based on the construction of spin foam models which are causal sets[21, 4].
The central notion in physics up to this time has been locality, but there are two indi-
cations that it may not continue to be a primary notion in the quantum theory of gravity.
• The experimental disconﬁrmations of the Bell inequalities tell us that any comple-
tion of quantum mechanics that gives us a complete description of individual events
will involve explicit non-local interactions.
• Indications from quantum gravity suggest that there is a more fundamental level of
description in which there is causal structure but no space. Instead, space emerges
as a low energy description of nature, and with it emerges locality.
I therefor propose to replace and subsume locality in spacetime with a deeper notion,
which is similarity of views. This idea comes from the real ensemble formulation of quan-
tum mechanics[10, 11], but the emphasis on a causal structure among the views merges
that approach with relative locality and energetic causal sets.
Leibniz in his Monodology described a relational universe built on a plurality of views
of the world, each from the perspective of a different fundamental entity. The present
proposal is a modern instantiation of that vision.
Here are the basic ideas we introduce or develop here:
• The history of the world is made from events. Events have predecessors, which are
a set of past events that transferred energy and momentum to it, and decendents,
to whom they transfer their energy and momenta. The transferring of energy and
momentum deﬁnes a causal structure. Past(I) and Fut(I) are the events in the
immediate causal past and causal future of I.
• Each event, I, has a view of the world, from its perspective, VI, which is a com-
pendium of information that arrives at the event from its causal past.
3

• We endorse Leibniz’s principle of the identity of the indiscernible (PII), according to
which each event is completely and uniquely characterized by its view. By uniquely,
we mean that the universe is generated by a dynamics which ensures that no two
events in the history of the universe have the same view.
• Thus, the PII Is implemented dynamically via an interaction that drives all pairs of
views to differ. We make use of the notion of the variety of a system[14], which we
developed a long time ago with Julian Barbour. The variety, V of a complex system
is a measure of the diversity among the views of that system from different con-
stituents. We identify the potential energy of our system of views with the negative
of their variety, a hypothesis we introduced in [10].
• The views do not live in spacetime. They live rather in products of momentum
spaces, as a view is made up of incoming energy-momentum. The fact that we
perceive our past as a set of incoming energy-momenta does not commit ourselves
to the expectation that the universe is a lorentzian spacetime. This approach is, in
a way, Kantian, in that the apparent 3 + 1 dimensionality and lorentz invariance of
our perceived world reﬂects the structures through which we perceive the world-
the views-and are not necessarily realized as properties of the world itself.
• This formulation is a discrete instantiation of the idea of relative locality[8, 9], ac-
cording to which spacetime is reconstructed from information about incoming energy-
momentum. A reconstruction will have defects, and one is that the locality of distant
events is dependent both on the observer and the energy carried by the probe that
observer uses to image the event. At a sufﬁcient level of coarse graining there may
be, for each observer and probe energy, a separate emergent spacetime into which
the events may be embedded, respecting their causal relations. A certain limit of the
energetic causal set dynamics deﬁnes a relative locality model.
• In the absence of a fundamental spacetime distance there is a metric on the views,
denoted h(I, J), which measures their similarity. Two events are nearby in the space of
views if they have similar views of their causal pasts.
• Locality in h(I, J) replaces spacetime locality. We specify dynamics according to
which two events are likely to interact if their view of their pasts are similar, i.e.
if their similarity distance, h(I, J), is small. These similarity interactions need not
respect the causal structure; neither the fundamental causal structure or the causal
structure of an emergent spacetime.
• This concept of similarity distance subsumes ordinary distance because, if two events
are nearby in spacetime, they have similar causal pasts. The hypothesis that inter-
actions are local in similarity explains the concept of local interactions in spacetime.
4

• But elementary events may sometimes be similar, even when they are far away in
the emergent spacetime[10, 11]. This, I propose, is the origin of the apparent non-
locality in quantum physics. That is, events that have similar views, that are nearby
in the metric on the space of views, are likely to interact. This is true whether their
views are similar because they are nearby in the causal structure, or not.
• Sufﬁciently complex events, whose views take much information to describe, are
likely to be highly unique, and hence isolated in the space of views. But a simple
event, whose view has few attributes, will likely have a view similar to those of
many other events scattered through the universe. Thus, we have a natural reason
to expect that notions of simplicity and complexity come into the dynamics of a
system of views.
• In particular, many simple events can be grouped into ensembles of sufﬁciently sim-
ilar events. The elements in these ensembles interact with each other, without re-
gard to locality in the emergent spacetime. These ensembles are what the quantum
state describes. This is the basic idea of the real ensemble formulation of quantum
mechanics[10, 11]. Below, in section 4, we indicate how the non-relativistic formu-
lation of quantum mechanics based on the real ensemble formulation presented in
[11] arises from the non-relativistic limit of the theory presented here. In particular,
as we showed in [11] the variety is, in the limit in which the ensembles are large,
well approximated by the integral of the Bohmian quantum potential.
More speciﬁcally:
• The view of an event, I, consists of a set of energy-momentum vectors, [pK
I ]a which
are the quanta whose interaction generates the event. These live in a momentum
space, P, about which we will have more to say below. The [pK
I ]a is the energy
momentum received from event K ∈Past(I). Thus, the world is an example of an
energetic causal set[2]-[5].
• The [pK
I ]a are represented by points on the two-sphere indicating direction, each
labeled by a number indicating the incoming energy.
• Momentum space may be ﬂat, as in special relativity, or curved, as is explored in
models of relative locality[8, 9]. In the case that the momentum space is maximally
symmetric, a copy of the local lorentz group acts separately on each VI as SL(2, C);
this is a local gauge symmetry.
• Outgoing energy momenta from an event I to an event K in its immediate causal
future are labeled by [qI
K]a ∈P. This is related to the momentum as received by K,
which is [pK
I ]a by a lorentz transformation,
[pK
I ]a = [UK
I ] b
a [qI
K]b
(1)
These transformations underlie the curvature of the emergent spacetime.

Kinematics of energetic causal sets
I then postulate that the universe is an energetic causal set[2], consisting of events, EI and
causal relations RIJ, where J < I. Each EI has a past set PastI consisting of events which
directly causally proceed it2.
Associated with each immediate relation < JI > are two future pointing momenta,
one transmitted from J, the second received by I, which we will call qaIJ and paIJ. These
are related by (1). We assume a metric on momentum space, gab and impose the energy
momentum relations.
˜CIJ = qaIJqbIJgab + m2c4 = 0,
CIJ = paIJpbIJgab + m2c4 = 0.
(2)
The view of an event is a set of labeled points on an S2, corresponding to its past set,
with a point σJ ∈S2 labeled by the energy transmitted eIj = p0IJ. This follows by a
standard transformation between the space of directions and points on an S2.
A given event , EI gives rise to a number dI of descendent events, FutI, and so is
represented as labeled points in the dI views of these descendants. Let’s call these qI
aK. At
each event we have a conservation law,
PI
a =

J∈PastI

aJ = QI
a =

This is generated by a constraint,

(4)
Note that PI
a is timeline and future pointing.

Dynamics of energetic causal sets
We combine the dynamics from energetic causal sets with those from the real ensemble
formulation. The dynamics is speciﬁc in two steps.
• There is a process which acts to construct the causal set of events, by continually
creating the descendants of present events. One hypothesis for this event creation
process was described, and studied in [2]. This process weighs the likelihood of the
creation of an event by the uniqueness of its causal past, or view.
• Energy and momentum are propagated on the growing causal set by equations of
motion, which come from varying an action.
This action is a sum of terms,
S = SECS + SRE
(5)
2For more details of the construction of energetic causal sets, see [2, 3, 4].

where the ﬁrst term SECS comes from energetic causal set models[2, 3]. The sec-
ond term in the action, SRE comes from the real ensemble approach to quantum
mechanics[11] and is deﬁned in terms of a notion of variety in (15) below.
Thus, in detail[2]

The dynamics of maximal variety
In this paper we are mainly concerned with the second stage of the dynamics. We assume
the causal set has been determined and investigate the consequences of extremizing the
action to determine the distribution of energy and momentum transferred in the various
causal processes. The chief novelty is the role of the potential energy related to the variety,
SRE.
The second term in the action SRE, comes from the real ensemble formulation[11],
where it measures the variety among the views. This is deﬁned as follows. We ﬁrst deﬁne
the distinctiveness of two elements, I and J to be a measure of the differences between the
views of I and J. This is denoted DIJ.
To construct the distinctiveness we have to consider the view of an event in its own
reference frame. Each event, I, has a centre of mass frame given by
PI
a =

K∈Past(I)

(7)

The distinctiveness, DIJ, is deﬁned when dI = dJ and is the best matching of the two

>best matching over rotations and permutations (12)
I will deﬁne best matching below.
The distinctiveness is large when the two views are very different and approaches zero
when they become more similar. Smaller spatial momenta are weighed more heavily
in the comparison of views. Hence, the distinctiveness deﬁnes a metric on momentum
space, given by
hIJ = D(I, J)
(13)
The variety is then deﬁned to measure the distinguishability of all the elements from
each other.

(14)
The variety is large when many views are distinct.
We take the potential energy to be proportional to the negative of the variety
SRE = gV
(15)
where g is a coupling constant to be determined. Minimizing the potential energy then
corresponds to maximizing the variety.
4.1
Best matching
The notion of best matching comparisons comes from the work of Babour and Bertotti on
relational dynamics[15]. We deﬁne a rotation [OJ
I ]j
i ∈SO(3); one for every pair of events,
I and J. Then, to make the formulas simple we deﬁne,

This introduces a gauge ﬁeld [OJ

i over the complete graph whose nodes are events,
which is reminiscent of quantum graphite models[16]. If we work to higher order, the
ﬂuctuations will induce a dynamics for the [ ˜OJ

Non-relativistic limit of the variety
We are interested in the non-relativistic limit. To ﬁnd it, we ﬁrst project the equation of

We neglect the quantum force, and pick the gauge in which the lapses are unity,

We then expand in powers of g.

Then we have the spatial difference of the I’th event with the K’th event, as seen in
the I’th reference frame.

In the non-relativistic limit we may assume that to a good approximation the solution
deﬁnes a common reference frame, so we can neglect the small v2

boosting between the centre of mass frames of the different events. Thus writing

Ensemble approximation
Let us now consider a large and complex history within which there is a subset of events,
S whose views are mutually similar,
h(I, J) < ǫ
∀I, J ∈S
(31)
where ǫ << 1 is a pure number.
We assume in particular that all members of S have the same number of past mo-
menta.
Let O be an observable on the space of views, V. We then deﬁne its average over the
ensemble as

4.5
Consequences of the Principle of the Identity of the Indiscernible
Recall that the PII dictates that there are no two I and J whose views are identical [pK
I ]a,
and that this is a consequence of the dynamics we have proscribed. This means there are
no two I and J such that,
[pK
I ]a = [pK
J ]a.
(34)
This means we may regard the view [pK
I ]a as a function of I:
[pK
I ]a = [pK]a(I)
(35)
USing the PII each view can be labeled by its content, so that in the ensemble approxi-
mation
[pK]a(I) = [pK]a(w(I)) = [pK]a(xa
I)
(36)
4.6
Cycle identities
Consider the case where there are two causal paths from one event to a later event. The
simplest case, which is an elementary causal diamond will sufﬁce to make the point. Here
we have
z1 < z2 < z4,
z1 < z3 < z4
(37)
with z2 and z3 acausal. Assuming all the lapses are equal to M, it follows from (22) that
to zeroth order in g,

More generally, any elementary closed cycle will have a corresponding identity, as a con-

(40)
Note that because of this cycle identity, given any closed curve γ ∈V we have, to zero’th
order in g,

(41)
from which it follows that there is an S0(x, s) such that,

However, to ﬁrst order in g we also ﬁnd, suppressing indices.

An ensemble approximation to the action

pa(s) = ∂aS(x(s), s),
˙pa(w) =

We note that there is no potential energy term because we have taken the limit of a rel-

It would be impossible to insert a spacetime dependent potential energy into the Hamil-
tonian constraint because initially there is no spacetime. The spacetime coordinates za
emerge from Lagrange multipliers.

Conclusions
In this paper we have proposed a new approach to fundamental physics, based on a
simultaneous completion of quantum mechanics and general relativity, and we have in-
vestigated a few of its consequences. From relative locality and energetic causal sets we
take the proposal that what is fundamental in nature are ﬂows of energy and momentum
amongst events, deﬁning a causal structure. Meanwhile, the expression of that causal
structure in terms of embedding into a space-time manifold turns out to be an emergent
and coarse grained description.
We also take two ideas from the real ensemble formulation of quantum mechanics.
First, the idea that quantum states correspond to ensembles of similar systems, and, sec-
ond, a proposal for dynamics of those ensembles based on maximizing a measure of their

diversity or variety. The variety is to be deﬁned by comparing views of subsystems[?]. In
[10, 11] the view of a subsystem is deﬁned, roughly as what that subsystem knows about
its surroundings as a result of interacting with it. Here we deﬁne instead the view of an
event as the set of energy and momentum transferred to it from vents in its immediate
causal past.
The main result is the existence of a Newtonian limit within which we are able to
derive non-relativistic quantum mechanics as the statistical description of ensembles with
large numbers of events.
There is a great deal more to be done to develop this proposal. To mention just one:
the ingredients for extending an energetic causal set model to a discrete spacetime history
analogous to a spin foam model, along the lines contemplated in [2, 21] are present in the
connections [UK
I ] b
a of 1 on the causal set and [OJ
I ]j
i (17) in the deﬁnition of variety. We
need to investigate proposals for their dynamics.
Finally, there are implicitions of this proposal for foundational issues such as the mea-
surement problem and the question of physical correlates of qualia. These will require
careful consideration and are beyond he scope of this paper.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Thank you very much to Marina Cortes and Roberto Mangabeira Unger, for their collab-
oration on the larger project of developing the hypothesis that time is fundamental and
irreversible, of which this is a part. I am also grateful to Henrique Gomes for a careful
reading of the manuscript. Finally, thank you to Julian Barbour for decades of conversa-
tion.
