SUMMARIES 
The remarkable 
Old Babylonian 
clay 
tablet 
which 
is 
commonly 
called 
Plimpton 
322 was 
published 
originally 
by 
Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
in 
their 
now-classical 
Mathematical 
Cuneiform 
Texts 
of 
1945. 
It 
contains, 
in a table 
with 
three 
preserved 
columns, 
a list 
of values 
of 
three 
quan- 
tities, 
which 
in 
the 
present 
paper 
are 
referred 
to as 
c2, 
b, 
and c. 
It 
is 
easy 
to verify 
that 
the 
listed 
val- 
ues 
(expressed 
in 
the 
usual 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
nota- 
tion) 
are 
precisely 
the 
ones 
that 
can be obtained 
by use 
of 
the 
triangle 
parameter 
equations 
b = ab, 
c = a;; 
b = +(t' 
- t), 
; = $(t' 
+ t), 
if 
one allows 
the 
parameter 
t 
(with 
the 
reciprocal 
num- 
ber 
t' 
= l/t) 
to vary 
over 
a conveniently 
chosen 
set 
of 
15 rational 
numbers 
t = s/r, 
and if 
the 
multiplier 
a is 
chosen 
in such 
a way 
that 
b and c become 
integers 
with 
no common prime 
factors. 
Hence, 
for 
every 
pair 
(b, 
c) 
appearing 
in 
the 
second 
and third 
columns 
of Plimpton 
322, 
the 
corresponding 
triple 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
is 
a positive 
primitive 
Pythagorean 
triple, 
i.e., 
the 
coprime 
integers 
a, b, 
and c are 
the 
sides 
of 
a right 
triangle 
and there- 
fore 
a solution 
of 
the 
indeterminate 
equation 
a2 + b2= 
c2, 
the 
so-called 
Pythagorean 
equation). 
After 
its 
publica- 
tion 
by Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
the 
Plimpton 
tablet 
was 
further 
discussed 
and interpreted 
by a number 
of 
other 
authors 
(Bruins, 
Price,et 
al.) 
from 
several 
different 
points 
of 
view. 
It 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
the present 
paper 
to try 
to extract 
and extend 
the 
best 
ideas 
from 
these 
various 
discussions 
and interpretations 
in order 
to 
achieve 
a unified 
and comprehensive 
analysis 
of 
the 
con- 
struction 
and meaning 
of 
this 
unique 
and important 
Baby- 
lonian 
mathematical 
text. 
In 
the paper 
a few 
comparisons 
with 
related 
texts 
are 
also 
made, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
showing 
that 
the 
table 
on Plimpton 
322 is

PLIMPTON 322; A GENERAL PRESENTATION OF THE 
CLAY TABLET WITH ITS TEXT 
The clay 
tablet 
"Plimpton 
322" acquired 
its 
name 
from 
its 
reg 
istration 
number in the George A. Plimpton 
Collection 
of the Rare 
Book and Manuscript 
Library, 
Columbia University, 
New York. 
The 
tablet 
was 
originally 
bought 
by George 
A. 
Plimpton 
ca. 
1923 
from 
Edgar James Banks of Eustis, 
Florida, 
and had allegedly 
been 
found at Senkereh. 
At the time 
of 
acquisition 
it 
was 
dated 
at 
2250 B.C. 
(I owe these data to Kenneth A. Lohf, 
Librarian 
of 
the Rare Book and Manuscript 
Library 
of Columbia University.) 
It was first 
recognized 
as an extremely 
important 
document from 

280 
Jtiran 
Friberg 
HM8 
the 
early 
history 
of mathematics 
by Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
[1945]. 
The tablet 
had been provisionally 
classified 
as a "commerical 
account," 
but 
Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
established 
its 
identity 
as 
a mathematical 
table 
text 
from 
the 
Old Babylonian 
period 
(1900- 
1600 B.C.). 
Since 
they 
were 
able 
to show 
that 
the 
table 
on the 
tablet 
could 
only 
have 
been 
constructed 
by the 
systematic 
use 
of 
a generating 
formula 
for 
(integral 
or 
rational) 
Pythagorean 
triples, 
Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
enthusiastically 
pronounced 
Plimpton 
322 "the 
oldest 
preserved 
document 
in ancient 
number 
theory" 
[Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
1945, 
371. 
The text 
on the 
obverse 
of 
Plimpton 
322 is 
reproduced 
in Figure 
1.1, 
in a hand 
copy 
made 
after 
photographic 
originals 
kindly 
put 
at the 
author's 
disposal 
by the 
Department 
of 
Rare 
Books 
and Manuscripts 
of 
the 
Butler 
Library 
of 
Columbia 
University. 
The reverse 
is 
uninscribed. 
The format 
of the 
tablet 
is 
about 
13 x 9 x 3 cm. 
A sign-by- 
sign 
transliteration 
of 
the 
cuneiform 
text 
is 
provided 
in Fig- 
ure 
1.2. 
This 
transliteration 
is 
a conformal 
transliteration, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
numerical 
or phonetic 
values 
of 
the 
signs 
on the 
original 
have 
been reproduced 
in their 
respective 
posi- 
tions 
within 
the 
outline 
of 
the 
tablet. 
The cuneiform 
numbers, 
by the 
way, 
are 
easy 
to read 
even without 
any previous 
acquaint-

tance 
with 
cuneiform 
writing, 
if 
only 
one knows 
that 
the 
signs 
for 
the 
units, 
1, 
. . . . 9, 
and the 
"tens," 
10, 
. . . . 50, 
in this 
text 
are 
the 
following: 
It 
has 
to be remarked 
here, 
however, 
that 
such 
a conformal 
transliteration 
is 
possible 
only 
if 
the 
use 
of 
zeros 
(which 
do 
not 
occur 
in the 
cuneiform 
original) 
is 
avoided 
in 
the 
trans- 
literation. 
For 
this 
reason, 
the 
cuneiform 
signs 
for 
the 
tens 
have been 
transliterated 
in Figure 
1.2 
by the 
use 
of 
the 
ad hoc 
notations 
I, . . . . 5. 
Thus, 
for 
instance, 
in 
the 
conformal 
trans 
literation 
the 
entries 
in 
row 
5 of 
the 
first 
three 
columns 
are 
the 
sexagesimally 
written 
numbers 
2 8 5 4 
1 4, 1 
5, 
1 ? 7, 
which 
in a nonconformal 
transliteration 
with 
zeros 
would 
look 
like 
this: 
48 
54 
01 
40, 
1 05, 
1 37. 
In this 
connection 
it 
is 
important 
to remember 
that 
in the 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
no- 
tation 
missing 
tens 
and units 
are 
sometimes 
indicated 
by an 
empty 
space. 
It 
is 
convenient 
to 
indicate 
such 
missing 
tens 
and 

282 
Jijran 
Friberg 
HM 8 
units 
in a nonconformal 
transliteration 
by use 
of 
zeros, 
as in 
the 
examples 
01, 
40, 
and 05 above. 
As a matter 
of 
fact, 
this 
slight 
departure 
from 
Neugebauer's 
standard 
sexagesimal 
notation 
- 
- 
(in 
which 
the 
number 
4 8 5 4 
1 4 would 
be transliterated 
as 
48, 
54, 
1, 40) 
becomes 
a necessity 
when 
one wants 
to make a pro- 
gram for 
sexagesimal 
multiplication 
on a pocket 
calculator, 
as 
in 
the 
Appendix 
of 
the 
present 
paper. 
Consider 
again 
the 
three 
entries 
in 
row 
5 of 
the 
first 
three 
columns 
of 
the 
tablet. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
we set 
the 
second 
of 
them equal 
to b = 1 05 (=65), 
and the 
third 
one to c = 1 37 (= 97), 
then 
c2 - b2 = a2, 
where 
a 
= 
1 12 (= 72). 
In addition, 
if 
we set 
C = c/a, 
then 
it 
can be shown 
that 
C = 1.20 
50, which 
means 
that 
c is 
a rational 
number 
with 
a terminating 
sexagesimal 
expansion. 
In 
the 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
notation, 
however, 
no "fractional 
point" 
was 
used, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
such 
terminating 
rational 
numbers 
cannot 
be distinguished 
from 
integers 
in this 
notation. 
Thus, 
if 
we make use of 
the 
Babylonian 
notation, 
we can write 
c simply 
as c = 1 20 50, 
and its 
square 
as c2 = 1 48 54 01 40. 
Similarly, 
if 
we write 
b = b/a 
in the 
Babylonian 
way 
as 54 10, 
then 
we can 
show 
that 
its 
square 
is 
z2 = c2 - 1 = 48 54 01 40. 
Consequently, 
the 
entry 
in 
row 
5 of 
the 
first 
column 
can be ei- 
ther 
c2 or b2, 
depending 
on whether 
we do or 
do not 
believe 
that 
we can see the 
traces 
of 
a vertical 
cuneiform 
wedge, 
standing 
for 
an initial 
digit 
(l), 
preceding 
the 
number 
48 54 01 40 precisely 
where 
a break 
has 
occurred 
along 
the 
left 
edge of 
the 
(preserved 
part 
of the) 
tablet. 
Repeating 
the 
same arguments 
for 
each of 
the 
15 lines 
on the 
tablet, 
we can conclude 
that 
if 
the 
entries 
in 
the 
second 
and third 
columns 
are 
called 
b and c, 
respectively, 
then 
in each of 
the 
15 cases 
it 
is 
true 
that 
c2 - b2 = a2, 
where 
a is 
a sexagesimal 
"integer," 
and that 
the 
number 
in the 
first 
column 
is 
equal 
either 
to c2 or b2, 
with 
c = c/a 
and b = b/a. 
Presumably 
the 
heading 
over 
the 
first 
column, 
if 
intact, 
would 
have 
informed 
us about 
the 
precise 
nature 
of 
the 
numbers 
listed 
in that 
column. 
However, 
the 
heading 
in question 
is 
damaged 
to 
such 
an extent 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
read 
and translate 
it 
with 
any appreciable 
degree 
of 
certainty. 
This 
fact 
is 
regret- 
table 
since 
such 
headings 
over 
the 
columns 
of 
Babylonian 
mathe- 
matical 
table 
texts 
are 
otherwise 
virtually 
unknown. 
Fortunately, 
however, 
it 
is 
really 
not 
very 
crucial 
for 
our 
interpretation 
of 
the 
text, 
or 
for 
our 
reconstruction 
of 
the 
algorithm 
used 
in the 
preparation 
of 
it, 
to know 
whether 
the 
first 
column 
listed 
the 
values 
of C2 or 
of 6'. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
choice 
between 
the 
two 
possibilities 
men- 
tioned 
is 
not 
an easy 
one. 
In fact, 
Neugebauer 
and Sachs, 
in 
their 
original 
transliteration 
of 
the 
text 
on Plimpton 
322, 
as- 
sumed that 
every 
number 
in 
the 
first 
column 
was 
preceded 
by an 
initial 
(l), 
of which 
only 
a trace 
of the 
impression 
is 
left 
on 
the 
preserved 
part 
of 
the 
tablet. 
On the 
other 
hand, 
it 
has 
been 
maintained 
by Bruins 
[1955] 
with 
considerable 
emphasis 
that 
the 

HM8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
283 
initial 
digits 
(1) 
should 
not 
be there. 
Bruins 
differs 
with 
Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
also 
in that 
he does 
not 
find 
it 
likely 
that 
the 
intact 
tablet 
contained 
any columns 
in addition 
to 
those 
on the 
preserved 
part 
of 
the 
tablet. 
It 
seems 
to me, how- 
ever, 
that 
much speaks 
in 
favor 
of 
the view 
held 
by Neugebauer 
and Sachs. 
In 
fact, 
the 
schematic 
drawing 
of the 
outlines 
of 
the 
tablet 
presented 
in Figure 
1.3, 
which 
is 
made after 
the 
pho- 
tographic 
originals 
at my disposal, 
shows 
quite 
clearly 
that 
the 
tablet 
in its 
present 
condition 
is 
thicker 
at its 
left 
edge than 
at the 
opposite 
edge. 
Presumably 
an intact 
tablet 
would 
have had 
a more 
symmetric 
appearance. 
The nature 
of 
the 
break 
at 
the 
left 
edge is 
also 
such 
that 
it 
would 
be difficult 
to understand 
how it 
could 
have 
come about 
if 
only 
a small 
margin 
to 
the 
left 
of 
the 
first 
column 
is 
missing. 
On the 
other 
hand, 
the 
break 
would 
be easy 
to 
explain 
if 
we are 
allowed 
to 
assume 
that 
as much as perhaps 
a third 
of 
the 
whole 
tablet 
is 
missing, 
and that 
all 
the 
numbers 
in 
the 
first 
preserved 
column 
began 
with 
a vertical 
wedge 
for 
the 
digit 
(1). 
In 
fact, 
a look 
at 
the 
front 
and rear 
views 
of 
the 
preserved 
part 
of 
the 
tablet 
in Figure 
1.3 
and a comparison 
with 
the 
more detailed 
copy 
of 
the 
obverse 
in Figure 
1.1 
show 
quite 
clearly 
that 
the 
tablet 
has 
a throughgoing 
crack 
following 
the 
straight 
line 
which 
is 
in- 
dicated 
by a series 
of 
initial 
vertical 
wedges 
(the 
first 
of 
the 
wedges 
in 
the 
sexagesimal 
notations 
for 
2, 3, 
1, 5 . ..) 
in 
rows

and 13 of 
the 
"c column," 
but 
deviating 
from 
this 
straight 
line 
in rows 
7-9 
where 
there 
is 
no initial 
vertical 
wedge. 
Hence 
the 
obvious 
implication 
is 
that 
there 
must 
have 
been a line 
of 
initial 
digits 
(1) 
in the 
"G2 column," 
producing 
a weakness 
in the 
surface 
of 
the 
tablet 
which 
ultimately 
caused 
the 
now missing 
portion 
to be broken 
off. 
All 
that 
is 
left 
of 
this 
presumed 
line 
of 
initial 
wedges 
is 
the 
series 
of 
inclining 
depressions 
which 
can still 
be seen 
along 
the 
left 
edge of 
the 
tablet. 
Our 
tentative 
conclusion 
must 
therefore 
be that 
a substantial 
part 
of 
the 
original 
tablet 
is 
missing. 
Judging 
from 
the 
curva- 
ture 
of 
the 
tablet, 
it 
seems 
reasonable 
to 
conjecture 
that 
the 
first 
column 
of 
Plimpton 
322 must 
have 
been 
situated 
roughly 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
intact 
tablet. 
This 
would 
give 
room 
for 
an 
additional 
two 
or, 
possibly, 
three 
short 
columns 
on the 
missing 
part. 
In this 
connection 
it 
is 
interesting 
to 
recall 
that 
ac- 
cording 
to Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
"the 
presence 
of modern 
glue, 
until 
the 
recent 
baking 
of 
the 
tablet, 
on the 
left 
(broken) 
edge 
shows 
that 
the 
missing 
part 
must 
have 
been lost 
after 
the 
exca- 
vation 
of 
the 
tablet" 
11945, 
391. 
Therefore 
the possibility 
cannot 
be excluded 
that 
the 
missing 
complement 
to Plimpton 
322 
still 
exists 
in 
some private 
collection 
or, 
perhaps, 
uncatalogued 
in the 
collections 
of 
some public 
institution. 
2. 
THE RESTRICTIONS 
ON THE PARAMETERS 
AS observed 
above, 
if 
we choose 
the 
notations 
c2, 
b, 
and c 
for 
the 
three 
numbers 
in any of 
the 
15 rows 
on Plimpton 
322, 
then 
it 
can be shown 
(for 
instance 
using 
the 
multiplication 
algorithms 
offered 
in 
the 
Appendix) 
that 
c2 - b2 
= a2, 
where a is a sexages- 
imal "integer" 
such that 
c = c/a. 
Therefore, 
if 
we set, 
in ad- 
dition, 
5 = b/a, 
then it 
follows 
that 
c2 - b2 = (c2 - b2)/a2 
= 1, 
a relation 
which can be written 
also in the factorized 
form 
(C + b)(Z 
- I;, = 1. 
This is an indeterminate 
equation 
for the 
pair 
(C , b). 
Looking for positive 
rational 
solutions 
to this 
indeterminate 
equation, 
we can let 
it 
be replaced 
by the equiv- 
alent 
system of equations 
c+b=t’,c-b=t, 
t rational, 
tt’ 
= 1, t’ 
> t > 0. (2.1) 
Hence, the general 
positive 
rational 
solution 
of the indeterminate 
equations 
c 2 - b2 = 1 is given by the following 
generating 
form- 
ula (well known in classical 
number theory): 
b = +(t' 
- t), 
c = +(t' 
+ t), 
t rational, 
tt’ 
= 1, t' 
> t 1 0. (2. 
Let us now see what results 
we can obtain 
by making the as- 

HM8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
285 
sumption 
that 
the 
equations 
in 
(2.2), 
which 
I call 
in 
the 
follow- 
ing 
the 
Babylonian 
triangle 
parameter 
equations, 
were 
used 
in the 
original 
compilation 
of 
the 
table 
on Plimpton 
322. 
Then our 
first 
problem 
is 
to 
try 
to determine 
how 
the 
15 values 
of 
the 
parameter 
t were 
chosen 
in order 
to yield 
those 
values 
of c2 = ($(t' 
+ t))2 
which 
are 
listed 
in the 
first 
column 
of 
the 
tablet. 
As observed 
already 
by Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
(see 
also 
[Bruins 
1949, 
195511, 
every 
admissible 
parameter 
t must 
be such 
that 
not 
only 
t itself 
but 
also 
its 
reciprocal 
number 
t’ 
= l/t 
can be written 
in the 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
notation 
as a number 
with 
finitely 
many 
sexagesimal 
places. 
But 
this 
is 
possible 
only 
if 
t is 
what 
Neugebauer 
calls 
a regular 
sexagesimal 
number, 
i.e., 
only 
if 
t 
can be factorized 
into 
powers 
of 
2, 
3, and 5, the 
three 
prime 
factors 
in 
the 
base 
60 of the 
sexagesimal 
number 
system. 
In 
other 
words, 
t must 
be of 
the 
form 
t = 2a3B5Y, 
a,B,y 
integers 
(not 
necessarily 
positive). 
Let 
us call 
the 
triple 
(cl,f3,y) 
the 
index 
of 
any regular 
number 
of 
this 
type. 
Then it 
is 
clear 
that 
a regular 
number 
which 
is 
also 
an integer 
must 
have 
a nonnegative 
index, 
and that 
any given 
regular 
number 
t can be written 
in 
a unique 
way 
as a product 
sr'(= 
s/r), 
where 
s and r are 
regular 
integers 
without 
common 
prime 
factors. 
In 
fact, 
the 
index 
of s is 
then 
equal 
to 
the 
positive 
part 
of the 
index 
of 
t, 
and the 
index 
of r' 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
negative 
part 
of 
the 
index 
of 
t. 
More generally, 
a given 
positive 
rational 
number 
can be written 
as a terminating 
sexages- 
imal 
number 
in 
the 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
notation 
if 
and only 
if 
it 
is 
of 
the 
form 
p/q, 
where 
p is 
an arbitrary 
integer, 
while 
q 
is 
a regular 
sexagesimal 
integer. 
In the 
following, 
I call 
such 
numbers 
semiregular 
sexagesimal 
numbers. 
Now it 
is 
clear 
that 
one possible 
way 
of beginning 
a systema- 
tic 
enumeration 
of 
all 
positive 
semiregular 
solutions 
of the 
in- 
determinate 
equation 
c2 - b2 = 1 would 
be to 
let 
the 
parameter 
t in 
the 
generating 
formula 
(2.2) 
vary 
in 
a systematic 
way 
over 
all 
regular 
sexagesimal 
numbers 
of the 
form 
t = s/r, 
where 
s and 
r are 
"sufficiently 
small" 
regular 
integers 
without 
common prime 
factors 
(see 
[Price 
19641). 
Let 
us consider, 
for 
instance, 
all 
such 
"parameter 
pairs" 
with 
0 < s < r 5 2 05 (= 125), 
where 
the 
condition 
0 < s < r is 
included 
in order 
to 
ensure 
that 
0 < t < t* 
(see 
(2.1)). 
If 
we indicate 
the 
respective 
positions 
of 
all 
these 
parameter 
pairs 
in an (r,s) 
plane 
with 
logarithmic 
scales 
on both 
coordinate 
axes, 
we obtain 
a diagram 
like 
the 
one in Figure 
2.1. 
The use 
of 
logarithmic 
scales, 
which 
is 
necessary 
in order 
to 
obtain 
an easily 
readable 
diagram, 
has 
the 
additional 
advantage 
that 
all 
pairs 
(r,s) 
with 
s/r 
= t lie 
on a straight 
line 
with 
slope 
1. 
Thus, 
noting 
where 
the 
straight 
line 
with 
slope 
1 
through 
a given 
point 
(r,s) 
intersects 
the 
vertical 
line 
r = 1 00, 
one can read 
off 
the 
corresponding 
value 
of 
t x 1 00 as the 
s 

286 
Jbran 
Friberg 
HI48 
coordinate 
of 
the 
point 
of 
intersection. 
The three 
lines 
cor- 
responding 
to 
the 
t values 
t = 1, t = 5/9 
= -33 
20, 
and t = 24 -1 
= .24 
51 10 . . . are explicitly 
indicated 
in the diagram. 
The 
line 
t = 2% - 1 has the property 
that 
it 
separates 
the set of 
parameter pairs 
for 
Pythagorean 
triples 
(1, b, c) with b < 1 from 
the set of parameter pairs 
for 
triples 
with b > 1. 
In fact, 
g < 1 if 
and only if 
%(t’ 
: t) 
c 1, i.e., 
if 
and only 
if 
t2 f 2t 
- 1 > 0, so that 
2% - 1 < t 
(< 1). 
The line 
t = 5/9, 
on the other 
hand, passes through 
the point 
(9, 5), and it 
can 
be shown that 
t = 5/9 is the t value which qenerates

The

associated 
with 
the 
smallest 
of 
the 
c2 values 
listed 
on Plimpton 
322. 
As a matter 
of 
fact, 
it 
can be shown 
that 
all 
the 
c2 values 
in 
the 
first 
column 
on Plimpton 
322 are 
associated 
with 
Eythagorean 
triples 
corresponding 
to 
t values 
in the 
inter- 
val 
22 - 1 < t < 5/9. 
This 
observation, 
originally 
due to 
Neugebauer 
and Sachs, 
was 
made more precise 
by Price 
[1964], 
who realized 
that 
the 
t values 
involved 
in the 
construction 
of 
the 
tables 
on Plimpton 
322 can be characterized 
as all 
values 
OF t = s/r 
which 
correspond 
to parameter 
pairs 
(r, 
s) 
with 
25 - 1 < s/r 
& 5/9, 
1 < s < 1 00 (= 60). 
The corresponding 
points 
in Figure 
2.1 
a;e 
indicated 
by means 
of the 
numbers 
1 
through 
15. 
Moreover, 
it 
can be seen 
from 
the 
diagram 
that 
there 
are 
precisely 
23 points 
in the 
complementary 
set 
that 
is 
charac- 
terized 
by the 
restriction 
to parameter 
pairs 
(r, 
s) 
with 
5/9 
< s/r 
< 1, 1 s s < 1 00. 
In this 
connection 
Price 
made the 
interesting 
and very 
plausible 
conjecture 
that 
the 
original 
in- 
tention 
of 
the 
Babylonian 
mathematician, 
who was

condition

288 
Jijran 
Friberg 
HM8 
Plimpton 
322, 
was 
to include 
in his 
table 
all 
those 
values 
of 
c2, 
b, 
c (etc.) 
with 
1 < c2 < 2 (i.e., 
with 
0 < s2 
< 1 
and 
consequently 
with 
0 < b < l), 
which 
can be obtained 
from 
the 
Babylonian 
triangle 
parameter 
equations 
(2.2) 
when 
t = s/r, 
where 
s is 
a single-place 
regular 
sexagesimal 
integer. 
Price 
based 
this 
conjecture 
on the 
fact 
(see 
Figure 
1.3) 
that 
the 
guide-lines 
separating 
the 
columns 
on the 
inscribed 
obverse 
of 
Plimpton 
322 are 
continued 
onto 
the 
uninscribed 
reverse 
in a 
way 
suggesting 
that 
the 
writer 
of 
the 
tablet 
had hoped 
to be 
able 
to 
add perhaps 
as many as 23 more rows 
on the 
edges 
and 
the 
reverse 
to 
the 
15 rows 
on the 
obverse. 
By writing 
the 
parameter 
t and its 
reciprocal 
t’ 
as 
t = s/r, 
and t’ 
= r/s, 
and by letting 
the 
pair 
(r, 
s) 
vary 
over 
all 
ad- 
missible 
parameter 
pairs 
(coprime 
pairs 
of 
regular 
sexagesimal 
integers) 
within 
a bounded 
"strip" 
in the 
(r, 
s) 
plane, 
one can 
generate 
an arbitrarily 
large 
set 
of parameter 
values 
in 
a sys- 
tematic 
and straightforward 
way. 
This 
type 
of procedure 
has 
been 
followed 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
table 
in Figure 
2.2. 
In order 
to obtain 
a sufficiently 
rich 
set 
of parameter 
values, 
I have 
chosen 
to 
include 
in the 
table 
all 
pairs 
(r, 
s) 
with 
0 < s < 1 00, 
r s 2 05, 
and 0.15 
s s/r 
< 1. 
An index 
n has 
been assigned 
to 
each pair 
(r, 
s) 
in 
the 
table 
in such 
a way 
that 
t = s/r 
becomes 
an increasing 
function 
of n. 
In 
this 
way, 
the 
38 pairs 
considered 
by Price 
(including 
the 
15 pairs 
asso- 
ciated 
with 
Plimpton 
322) 
have 
indices 
n = 1, 
. . . . 38, while 
for 
22 additional 
pairs 
with 
0.15 
2 t < 0.24, 
the 
indices 
are 
n = 
-22, 
. . . . -1.

Using 
the 
values 
of 
t and t’ 
listed 
in the 
table 
of Figure 
2.2, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
compute 
the 
corresponding 
values 
of 
b = &(t' 
- t) 
and c = %(t' 
+ t) 
according 
to 
the 
triangle 
parameter 
equations 
(2.2). 
These 
values 
are 
listed 
in 
the 
first 
two 
columns 
of 
the 
table 
in Figure

Once the 
values 
of z and c are 
known, 
it 
is 
also 
quite 
easy 
to 
compute 
the 
corresponding 
values 
of c2, 
as well 
as those 
of b and c. 
These 
values 
are 
listed 
in the 
third, 
fourth, 
and fifth 
columns 
of 
the 
table 
in Figure 
2.3, 
ordered 
by increas- 
ing 
values 
of 
the 
index 
n, which 
itself 
is 
given 
in 
the 
last 
column. 
In 
this 
way 
we obtain 
a comprehensive 
table 
containing 
the 
table 
on the 
preserved 
part 
of 
the 
Plimpton 
tablet 
(after 
corrections) 
as a subset. 
This 
subset 
is 
identified 
in Figure 
2.3 
by means 
of 
a frame 
around 
it. 
3. 
THE NUMERICAL ALGORITHM USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TABLE 
I will 
show 
below 
that 
the 
values 
of 
c2, 
b, 
and c can be ob- 
tained 
fairly 
easily 
from 
the 
values 
of 5 and c, 
using 
only 
meth- 
ods 
which 
would 
have 
been available 
also 
to a mathematician 
of 
the 
Old Babylonian 
period. 
Granted 
that 
this 
can be done, 
it 
is 
then 
possible 
to 
conjecture 
that 
the 
columns 
supposedly 
"broken 
off" 
from 
Plimpton 
322 were 
columns 
for 
z and c, 
in other 
words 
that 
the 
intact 
tablet 
contained 
columns 
for 
the 
variables 
b 
c 
c2 
(='l 
+ b2) 
b 
c 
n, 
(3.1) 
just 
as in the 
extended 
table 
in Figure 
2.3. 
(Note 
that 
there 
is 
no need to 
postulate 
two 
extra 
columns 
on the 
tablet 
for 
t 
and t’, 
because 
these 
values 
would 
be written 
on a second 
tablet 
corresponding 
to 
the 
table 
in Figure 
2.2. 
Also, 
the 
values 
of 
t and t’ 
can be computed 
quite 
easily, 
if 
so desired, 
by use 
of 
the 
simple 
relations 
t = c - 5, 
t’ 
= c + b, 
as soon 
as the 
values 
of b and c are 
known.) 
Our first 
task 
is 
to show 
how 
the 
values 
of c2 may have 
been 
computed. 
A possible 
clue 
to 
the 
answer 
to this 
question 
is 
the 
fact 
that, 
remarkably 
enough, 
the 
c2 column 
contains 
only 
two 
errors, 
which, 
as we shall 
see, 
have 
quite 
simple 
explanations. 
One would, 
a priori, 
have 
imagined 
it 
to be very 
hard 
to compute, 
mentally 
or manually, 
the 
squares 
of 
so many two- 
to 
five-place 
(i.e., 
4- 
to 
lo-digit) 
(non-regular) 
sexagesimal 
numbers 
without 
making 
several 
mistakes. 
The columns 
for 
b and c on the 
Plimpton 
tablet, 
on the 
other 
hand, 
contain 
as many as four 
errors 
of 
various 
types. 
(This 
fact 
shows 
also, 
incidentally, 
that 
it 
is 
hardly 
likely 
that 
the 
values 
in the 
c2 column 
were 
obtained 
from 
the 
values 
in 
the 
c column 
and in an unrecorded 
a column 
by set- 
ting 
c2 = (~/a)~ 
(= (r2 
+ s2)/2rs), 
as claimed 
in 
[Price 
19641.) 

290 
JGran 
Friberg 
HM 8 
The explanation 
I propose 
for 
the 
virtual 
absence 
of 
errors 
in 
the 
c2 column 
is 
that 
the 
values 
written 
in this 
column 
had been 
checked 
beforehand 
by being 
computed 
in two 
different 
ways: 
in 
view 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
c2 = 1 + b2, 
the 
checking 
of 
the 
values 
of 
c2 may have 
consisted 
in computing 
the 
values 
of 
g2 as well, 
to 
see whether 
they 
would 
be the 
same sexagesimal 
numbers 
except 
for 
the 
initial 
"1". 
Note, 
in 
this 
connection, 
that 
my interpretation 
of 
the 
first 
column 
on Plimpton 
322 as representing 
at the 
same 
time 
both 
c2 and b2 = c2 - 1 is 
in fairly 
good agreement 
with 
the 
tentative 
translation 
in 
[Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
1945, 
401 of 
the 
heading 
of 
this 
column: 
"the 
[.. .] 
of 
the 
diagonal 
which 
has been 
subtracted 
such 
that 
the 
width 
[...I." 
(A similar 
translation 
can be found 
in 
[Bruins 
19491. 
See also 
[Price 
1964, 
81.) 
It 
might 
be objected 
that 
it 
seems 
unlikely 
that 
anybody 
would 
really 
have 
gone to 
the 
trouble 
of 
computing 
the 
squares 
of 
both 
c and b in all 
15 cases, 
in particular 
since 
c and b are 
represented 
by several-place 
nonregular 
sexagesimal 
numbers 
in 
all 
cases 
but 
one. 
(The Babylonian 
square 
tables 
for 
several- 
place 
numbers 
which 
are 
known 
to have 
existed 
listed, 
for 
several 
reasons, 
only 
squares 
of regular 
sexagesimal 
numbers.) 
This 
ob- 
jection, 
however, 
loses 
much of 
its 
strength 
if 
we assume 
that 
a 
certain 
Babylonian 
factorization 
method, 
well 
known 
in other 
con- 
nections, 
was 
involved 
in 
the 
computation 
of 
the 
squares 
in ques- 
tion 
in a way 
which 
is 
described 
below. 
In fact, 
the 
relation 
between 
a normalized 
Pythagorean 
triple 
(1, 
b, 
c) 
and the 
cor- 
responding 
primitive 
Pythagorean 
triple 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
is 
simply 
that 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
is 
the 
uniquely 
determined 
multiple 
of 
(1, 
5, c) 
which 
can be interpreted 
as a triple 
of coprime 
integers. 
Since, 
ac- 
cording 
to 
(2.2), 
6, c, = ($(t’ - t), &(t’ + t)) 
= ( (r2 
- s2)/2rs, 
(r2 
+ s2)/2rs) 
if 
t = s/r, 
(3.2) 
it 
follows, 
therefore, 
that 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
= A(2rs, 
r2 
- s2, 
r2 
+ s2), 
where 
A = 1 if 
rs 
is 
even 
and X = % if 
rs 
is 
odd 
(3.3) 
(see 
[Friberg 
1980a, 
131). 
In particular, 
we see 
that 
a = 2Xrs 
for 
every 
given 
regular 
value 
of 
the 
parameter 
t = s/r, 
and con- 
sequently 
a must 
be a regular 
sexaqesimal 
integer. 
Hence, 
we 
have 
that 
(see 
(3.2)) 
(b, 
c) 
= (ba', 
ca'), 
aa' 
= 1 and a regular. 
(3.2)'

Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
291 
Therefore 
we obtain 
the 
pair 
(b, 
c) 
from 
the 
pair 
(b, 
c) 
simply 
by removing 
the 
common regular 
factor 
a' 
from 
the 
numbers 
b and 
c. 
This 
can be done in 
a number 
of 
simple 
steps, 
irrespective 
of 
whether 
the 
value 
of a (or 
a') 
is 
known 
beforehand 
or not. 
The method 
is most 
easily 
explained 
by means of 
an example. 
Consider, 
for 
instance, 
row 
10 of 
the 
extended 
Plimpton 
table 
in Figure 
2.3, 
with 
(b, 
c, 
= (45 56 06 40 , 1 15 33 53 20), 
(3.4) 
where 
the 
numbers 
are 
expressed 
in the 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
notation. 
What we want 
to do now is 
to remove 
successively, 
in 
several 
small 
steps, 
all 
the 
common regular 
factors 
in the 
two 
numbers. 
A first 
such 
factor 
is 
20, 
for 
the 
obvious 
reason 
that 
i; = 45 56 06 x 60 + 40 = (45 56 06 x 3 + 2) 
x 20, 
and similarly 
for 
c. 
As is 
well 
known, 
however, 
in 
Old Babylonian 
mathematics 
division 
by a regular 
number 
was 
habitually 
replaced 
by the 
equivalent 
operation 
of multiplication 
by the 
reciprocal 
number. 
For 
this 
reason, 
it 
is 
preferable 
to 
say, 
not 
that 
b 
and c in our 
example 
have 
the 
common regular 
factor 
20, 
but 
rather 
that 
they 
have 
the 
common reciprocal 
factor 
3. 
(3 is 
the 
reci- 
procal 
of 
20 in the 
Old Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
notation, 
because 
3 x 20 = 1 (= 1 OO).) 
This 
fact 
can be expressed 
by introducing 
the 
new 
"reduced 
pair" 
- 
- 
(bl’ 
cl) 
= 3 x (b, 
c) 
= (3 x 45 56 06 + 02 , 3 X 1 15 33 53 + 01) 
= (2 17 48 20 , 3 46 41 40). 
(3.4)I 
The reader 
who wants 
to check 
the 
multiplications 
can easily 
do so by use 
of 
the 
algorithms 
in the 
Appendix, 
In particular, 
the 
calculator 
program 
offered 
there, 
given 
for 
an HP-25, 
is 
particularly 
well 
suited 
for 
(repeated) 
multiplication 
of a 
given 
sexagesimal 
number 
of 
four 
or 
fewer 
places 
by 
(a sequence 
of) 
single-place 
reciprocal 
factors. 
Thus, 
the 
program 
gives 
directly 
the 
product 
3 x 45 56 06 40 = 2 17 48 20, 
but 
somewhat 
less 
readily 
the 
product 
3 x 1 15 33 53 20 = 3 x 1 15 33 53 + 01 
= 3 46 41 39 + 01 = 3 46 41 40. 
Since 
b I and c 1 of 
the 
reduced 
pair 
(b , cl) 
also 
have 
3 as 
1 

292 
J&an 
Friberg 
HM8 
a common reciprocal 
factor, 
we can repeat 
the process, 
obtaining 
(bz, 9) 
= 3 X 3 X (b, 
c) 
= 
(6 53 25 
, 11 
20 05). 
(x.4)2 
b2 and c2 of the new reduced pair 
(bz, ~2) have 12 (the reciprocal 
of 5) as a common reciprocal 
factor. 
Hence, 
(b3, c3) = 12 x 3 x 3 x (b, ;, 
= (1 22 41 , 2 16 01). 
(3.4)3 
Since 41 is a nonregular 
sexagesimal 
number, the process stops 
here; 
b3 and c3 of the pair 
(bg, 
c3) have no common reciprocal 
factor. 
Consequently, 
a= 
12X3x3, 
(b, 
c) 
= 
(b3, 
c3) 
= (1 22 41 , 2 16 01). 
Continuing 
further 
with the same example, we can now go on 
to compute the squares of both z and c in (3.4) 
by use of the 
following 
variant 
of the Babylonian 
"factorization 
method": 
computing the squares of the "maximally 
reduced" 
pair 
(b, 
c) 
by 
any method available 
(for 
instance, 
by use of the calculator 
program), 
we obtain 
the pair 
of squares, 
(b2, c2) = (1 53 56 32 01 , 5 08 20 32 01). 
(3.5) 
But it 
follows 
from (3.4)3 
that 
(b, c) = 5 X 20 X 20 X lb, C) 
= 33 20 x (b, 
c), 
hence that 
(b2, c2, 
= 
(33 
20)2 
x (b2, 
c2) 
Consequently 
we can compute (b2, C2) in two simple steps 
(using 
once more the program in the Appendix): 
(33 
20) 
x (b2, 
c2) 
= (1 03 18 04 27 13 20 , 2 51 18 04 27 13 20), 
and 
G2 I i2, 
= 
(33 
20)2 
x 
(b2, 
c2) 
= 
(35 10 02 28 27 24 26 40 , 1 35 10 02 28 27 24 26 40). 

HM 8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
293 
We recognize 
in one or 
the 
other 
of 
these 
two 
numbers 
the 
entry 
in the 
first 
column 
of 
row 
10 on the 
Plimpton 
tablet, 
and we no- 
tice 
in addition 
that 
the 
factorization 
method 
has 
allowed 
us to 
compute 
the 
square 
of 
the 
five-place 
number 
c in several 
easy 
steps, 
of which 
the 
first 
one was 
the 
computation 
of 
the 
square 
of 
the 
three-place 
reduced 
number 
c. 
The importance 
of 
such 
a 
reduction 
from, 
say, 
a five-place 
to 
a three-place 
number 
be- 
comes 
obvious 
as soon 
as we start 
trying 
to use 
the 
calculator 
program, 
with 
its 
built-in 
limitation 
to 
at most 
four-place 
num- 
bers 
in the 
register 
that 
is 
reserved 
for 
the 
current 
value 
of 
a. 
We can very 
well 
imagine 
that 
the 
computations 
of 
the 
Old 
Babylonian 
mathematician 
who constructed 
the 
table 
on Plimpton 
322 were 
subject 
to similar 
limitations, 
especially 
if 
he used 
some kind 
of 
"abacus" 
which 
would 
set 
a restriction 
on the 
num- 
ber 
of 
sexagesimal 
places 
in the 
numbers 
of the 
computation. 
It 
is 
possible 
to prove 
that 
the 
factorization 
method, 
illus- 
trated 
by the 
example 
just 
described, 
will 
always 
lead 
to 
the 
desired 
result 
in a finite 
number 
of 
steps. 
The proof, 
which 
is 
not 
very 
difficult, 
will 
be ommitted 
since 
it 
is 
of 
no particular 
importance 
in 
the 
present 
connection. 
Of more 
specific 
interest, 
however, 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
exists 
a well-known 
example 
of 
a cuneiform 
text 
in which 
a vari- 
ant 
of 
the 
Babylonian 
factorization 
method 
is 
used 
in order 
to 
extract 
the 
square 
root 
of 
a several-place 
semiregular 
sexagesimal 
number. 
In 
fact, 
the 
foregoing 
discussion 
of 
the 
way 
in which 
the 
squares 
c2 on the 
Plimpton 
tablet 
may have 
been 
computed 
was 
conducted 
in 
imitation 
of 
the 
(reverse) 
procedure 
in 
this 
example. 
The text 
in question 
is 
the 
Sippar 
text 
1st.S 
428 
[Neugebauer 
1935, 
Ch. 
1.6.~; 
Huber 
19571. 
(A similar 
example 
is 
in 
the 
text 
IM 54472 
[Bruins 
19541). 
The problem 
posed 
on Ist.S 
428 is 
to 
compute 
the 
square 
root 
of 
the 
number 
(x2 =) 
2 02 02 02 05 05 04. 
The solution, 
as given 
on the 
tablet, 
is 
the 
following. 
In a 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
computation 
obvious 
regular 
square 
factors 
in 
the 
given 
number 
are 
removed, 
one at 
a time, 
through 
repeated 
multiplication 
with 
the 
corresponding 
reciprocal 
factors: 
(Xl 2 = 302 x ,2 = 15 x ,2 =) 
30 30 30 31 16 16, 
(x2 2 = 152 x x12 = 3 45 x Xl2 
=) 
1 54 24 24 27 16, 
(x$ 
= 152 x x22 = 3 45 x x22 =) 
7 09 01 42 15, 
(x42 
= 
22 x x3 2 = 4 x x12 =) 
28 36 06 06 49. 

294 
J&an 
Friberg 
HM 8 
Note 
that 
the 
multiplication 
here 
by the 
two-place 
number 
3 45 
may have 
been carried 
out 
in a single 
operation, 
multiplying 
successively 
each 
sexagesimal 
place 
of XI*, 
or 
of x2*, 
by 3 45, 
which 
could 
be done easily 
by use of 
a Babylonian 
combined 
mul- 
tiplication 
table 
of 
standard 
type. 
In fact, 
such 
combined 
multiplication 
tables 
as a rule 
contained 
multiplication 
tables 
for, 
in particular, 
the 
reciprocals 
of 
almost 
all 
single-place 
regular 
numbers 
(See 
[Neugebauer 
1935, 
1,9].) 
The next 
step 
in 
the 
computation 
is 
to 
find 
the 
square 
root 
XL+ of 
the 
last 
reduced 
number, 
by any method 
available. 
The result 
can be shown 
to be: 
(xl+ =I 
5 20 53. 
And finally, 
in the 
last 
line 
of 
the 
text, 
the 
correct 
value 
of 
the 
desired 
square 
root 
x is 
obtained 
by reversing 
the 
relation 
X4 = 2 x 15 x 15 x 30 x x: 
(x = 30 x 4 x 4 x 2 x x4 = 16 x x4 =) 
1 25 34 08. 
(Remark: 
Interestingly 
enough, 
the 
number 
1 25 34 08 is 
the 
"integral 
part" 
of 
the 
square 
root 
of 
the 
very 
special 
sexagesimal 
"integer" 
2 02 02 02 02 02 02. 
This 
observation 
explains 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
seemingly 
strange 
number 
2 02 02 02 05 05 04-- 
a square!--in 
the 
text 
we have 
just 
considered.) 
Analogous 
applications 
of 
the 
factorization 
method 
seem to 
have 
been employed 
regularly 
by Babylonian 
mathematicians 
through- 
out 
the 
entire 
period 
of 
cuneiform 
writing. 
In late 
(Seleucid) 
times 
a particularly 
elaborate 
model 
of 
the 
factorization 
method 
may have 
been used 
in order 
to construct 
the 
well-known 
Babylonian 
tables 
of 
reciprocals 
and squares 
of 
"six-place" 
regular 
numbers.

THE NATURE OF THE ERRORS 
In 
the 
preceding 
section 
of 
this 
paper 
I conjectured 
that 
the 
following 
algorithm 
was 
used 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
columns 
on the 
Plimpton 
tablet, 
including 
the 
missing 
part: 
First 
a list 
was 
made, 
one way or 
another, 
of 
admissible 
t values 
2 24 - 1, which 
were 
then 
ordered 
in an increasing 
sequence 
and 
labeled 
by an index 
n. 
Next, 
the 
corresponding 
values 
of b 
= &(t' 
-t) 
and(3=&(t' 
+ t) 
were 
computed, 
and it 
was 
checked, 
by the 
factorization 
method, 
that 
the 
Pythagorean 
equation 
c* 
= 1 + b* was 
satisfied. 
This, 
incidentally, 
gave 
a valuable 
verification 
of 
the 
computations 
so far. 
It 
was 
observed 
that, 
in the 
process 
of 
computing 
E2 and c*, 
the 
maximally 
reduced 
pair 

HM8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
295 
(bt 
c) 
had also 
been 
computed, 
so that 
the 
three 
columns 
for 
c2, 
b, 
and c were 
the 
outcome 
of 
a single 
series 
of 
computations. 
Of 
the 
38 rows 
of values 
b, 
c, 
c2, 
b, 
and c, 
presumably 
obtained 
in 
this 
way, 
the 
first 
15 were 
written 
on the 
obverse 
of 
the 
tablet, 
while 
the 
remaining 
23 were 
saved 
to be written 
later 
on the 
re- 
verse 
and on the 
edge 
(although 
this 
never 
happened). 
Later, 
the 
part 
of 
the 
tablet 
containing 
the 
first 
columns 
was 
broken 
off 
and lost, 
possibly 
in modern 
times. 
Let 
us now 
see how the 
algorithm 
proposed 
above 
can be recon- 
ciled 
with 
the 
errors 
appearing 
in the 
text 
of 
the 
Plimpton 
tablet. 
These 
errors 
are 
(see 
Figure 
1.2 
and the 
corresponding 
part 
of 
the 
corrected 
table 
in Figure 
2.3): 
in the 
c -2 
column: 
row 
2: 
[l 
56 56158 
14 56 15 
instead 
of 
1 56 56 58 14 50 06 15 
row 
8: 
[1141 
33 59 03 45 
instead 
of 
1 41 33 45 14 03 45 
in the 
b column: 
row 
9: 
9 01 
instead 
of 
8 01 
row 
13: 
7 12 01 
instead 
of 
2 42 
row 
15: 
56 
instead 
of 
28 
in 
the 
c column: 
row 
2: 
3 12 a1 
instead 
of 
1 20 25 
(Remark: 
Not 
exactly 
an error, 
but 
a puzzling 
departure 
from 
the 
standard 
practice 
in the 
first 
three 
columns, 
is 
the 
use 
in 
the 
n column 
of 
some unusual 
sign 
forms 
for 
the 
numbers 
4, 
7, 
and 8. 
A possible 
explanation 
is 
that 
the 
tablet 
is 
a copy 
of 
an older 
original, 
and that 
the 
person 
who made the 
copy 
happened 
to 
imi- 
tate 
the 
sign 
forms 
of 
the 
original 
in the 
n column 
where 
the 
individual 
number 
signs 
are 
relatively 
isolated 
from 
each other.) 
It 
is 
also 
customary 
to point 
out 
as an "error" 
that 
the 
pair 
(b, 
c) 
= (45 
, 1 15) 
in row 
11 is 
not 
coprime; 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
Plimpton 
322 is 
the 
enumeration 
of 
a certain 
set 
of primitive 
Pythagorean 
triples 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
by listing 
the 
last 
two 
coordinates 
(b, 
c) 
of 
each 
such 
triple, 
then 
the 
correct 
entry 
in 
row 
11 would 
have been 
(3, 
5), 
rather 
than 
(45 
, 1 15). 
In my interpretation, 
however, 
the 
pair 
(45 
, 1 15), 
while 
not 
maximally 
reduced 
as are 
the 
corresponding 
pairs 
in all 
the 
other 
14 rows, 
is 
still 
sufficiently 
reduced, 
in the 
sense 
that 

296 
Jtjran 
Friberg 
HM8 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
compute 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
pair 
(45 
, 1 15) 
di- 
rectly. 
Besides, 
it 
may well 
be true 
that 
the 
standard 
example 
of 
a Pythagorean 
triple 
which 
we know 
as the 
triple 
(3, 
4, 
5) 
(or 
4, 
3, 
5)) 
was 
known 
to the 
Babylonian 
mathematicians 
as the 
triple 
(1, 
45 , 1 15). 
In other 
words, 
in this 
particular 
case, 
the 
writer 
simply 
preferred 
to keep 
the 
original 
pair 
(b, 
c), 
because 
it 
was 
a pair 
with which he was already 
familiar. 
This 
means that 
the presence of this 
particular 
"error" 
is very 
close 
to a proof 
that 
no application 
of "number theory", 
in the proper 
sense of the word, was involved 
in the construction 
of the table 
on Plimpton 
322. 
What the true purpose of the table 
may have 
been is discussed in the next section. 
Of the errors 
listed 
above, two occur in the column of c* 
values. 
Of these two errors, 
the one in row 2 is most easily 
explained. 
It 
consists 
in the absence of an empty space to 
denote a couple of missing tens and units 
and may have been 
caused, for example, 
by a misreading 
of the notes which must 
have been scribbled 
on a piece of clay 
in the course of the 
actual 
computations. 
The second error 
in the c* column seems 
to be more serious. 
In fact, 
the text 
gives 
in row 8 the in- 
correct 
C* value, 
1 41 33 59 03 45, instead 
of the correct 
value, 
1 41 33 45 14 03 45. 
Hence, at some point 
in the compu- 
tation 
a mistake must have been made, probably 
due to the in- 
adequacy of the Babylonian 
sexagesimal notation 
in certain 
sit- 
uations, 
with 
the effect 
that 
the two sexaqesimal places 45 14 
"telescoped" 
into 
the single 
place 
59 (see [Bruins 
19551). 
In order to see how this 
may have happened without 
the error 
being discovered 
when the relation 
c2 = b2 + 1 was tested 
(ac- 
cording 
to the algorithm 
suggested in the preceding 
section), 
the computation 
of c2 and b2 by the Babylonian 
factorization 
method must be examined. 
First 
the common regular 
factors 
of 
the pair 
(b, c) are removed: 
(5, c, = 
(49 56 15 , 1 18 03 45), 
(blr 
cl) 
= 4 x (b, c) = 
(3 19 45 , 5 12 15), 
C&r 
~2) = 4 x (bl, 
cl) 
= 
(13 19 , 20 49). 
Next the squares of the reduced pair 
(b2, ~2) are found: 
(bz2, c& 
= 
(2 57 20 01 , 7 13 20 01) 
Finally, 
the squares of the pair 
(b, c) are computed by re- 
versing 
the facorization 
process: 

HM8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
297 
(i2, 
7) 
= 
3 45 x 3 45 x (2 57 20 01 , 7 13 20 01) 
= 3 45 x (11 05 00 03 45 , 27 05 00 03 45) 
= (41 33 45 14 03 45 , 1 41 33 45 14 03 45). 
In the 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
notation 
there 
was 
no special 
symbol 
for 
missing 
tens 
or units, 
not 
even 
for 
entire 
missing 
sexagesimal 
places 
(this 
is 
true 
at 
least 
for 
most 
texts 
from 
the 
Old Babylonian 
period), 
although 
an empty 
space 
was 
used, 
when 
needed, 
to 
indicate 
the 
absence 
of one or 
more consecutive 
tens 
or units. 
Hence, 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
sexagesimal 
numbers 
11 05 00 03 45 and 11 05 03 45, 
in the 
Babylonian 
notation, 
must 
have 
been 
(at 
most) 
that 
the 
empty 
space 
indicating 
the 
three 
missing 
tens 
and units 
in the 
first 
number 
was 
larger 
than 
the 
empty 
space 
in the 
second 
number, 
which 
indicated 
only 
one miss- 
ing 
ten. 
Therefore, 
it 
may well 
be that 
the 
author 
of 
the 
text 
misread 
his 
notes 
and worked 
with 
the 
number 
11 05 03 45, 
instead 
of 
the 
correct 
number 
11 05 00 03 45. 
Similarly, 
he would 
have 
calculated 
with 
the 
number 
27 05 03 45 instead 
of 
the 
correct 
27 05 00 03 45. 
In this 
way 
the 
error 
introduced 
in the 
second 
step 
of 
the 
computation 
of 
(b2, 
c2) 
(see 
above) 
would 
then 
have 
spread 
to 
the 
third 
step 
of 
the 
same computation, 
causing 
the 
"telescoping" 
of 
the 
two 
places 
45 14 into 
the 
single 
place 
59. 
In 
fact, 
3 45 x 11 05 03 45 = 3 45 x (11 05 00 00 + 3 45) 
= 41 33 45 00 00 + 14 03 45 = 41 33 59 03 45, 
while 
3 45 11 05 00 03 45 = 3 45 x (11 05 00 00 00 + 3 45) 
= 41 33 45 00 00 00 + 14 03 45 = 41 33 45 14 03 45. 
Since 
the 
same kind 
of 
telescoping 
would 
have 
occurred 
in the 
two 
sexagesimal 
numbers 
expressing 
the 
values 
of b2 and of c2, 
respectively, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
relation 
c2 = g2 + 1 would 
still 
hold 
for 
the 
telescoped 
numbers, 
and the mistake 
could 
therefore 
not 
have been 
detected, 
as would 
other 
types 
of mis- 
takes 
which 
would 
have 
occurred 
in 
just 
one of 
the 
two 
numbers. 
Now consider 
the 
errors 
in the 
b column 
of 
Plimpton 
322. 
Of 
these 
the 
error 
in row 
9 was 
simply 
a misreading 
of 
the 
notes, 
copying 
a "9" 
as an "8," 
which 
would 
have 
happened 
quite 
easily 
because 
of 
the 
small 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
number 
signs 
in 

298 
Jtjran 
Fribger 
HM8 
question. 
The error 
in row 
13, which 
consists 
in writing 
the 
value 
7 12 01 of b2, 
instead 
of the 
value 
2 41 of b, 
must 
also 
be a mistake 
made in 
copying 
from 
the 
notes, 
where, 
according 
to 
the 
assumptions 
we have 
made, 
the 
successive 
computation 
of 
the 
values 
of 
b and b2 were 
two 
of 
the 
steps 
in 
the 
computation 
of 
the 
corresponding 
value 
of 
z2. 
The error 
in row 
15, 
finally, 
consists 
in writing 
56 = 2 x 28 instead 
of 
28. 
A possible 
ex- 
planation 
is 
that 
the 
step-by-step 
factorization 
of i 
and C was 
carried 
out, 
not 
simultaneously, 
but 
separately, 
for 
b and for 
c, 
in the 
following 
way: 
(b =I 
37 20 
cc =) 
1 10 40 
(bl 
= 3 x b =) 
1 52 
(Cl 
= 3 x c =) 
3 32 
(b2 = 30 x bl 
=) 
56 
(c2 
= 15 x Cl =) 
53 
Since 
here 
the 
factorization 
of c was 
completed 
after 
two 
steps, 
the 
factorization 
of 5 would 
also 
have 
to be interrupted 
after 
two 
steps, 
in order 
to 
obtain 
the 
two 
components 
of 
the 
pair 
(z, 
c) 
reduced 
to the 
same degree. 
The mistake 
would 
consist 
in the 
fact 
that 
the 
reciprocal 
factor 
30 had been used 
in the 
second 
reduction 
step 
of 
the 
first 
case, 
whereas 
the 
reciprocal 
factor 
15 was 
used 
in 
the 
second 
case, 
perhaps 
due to 
the 
cir- 
cumstance 
that 
it 
is 
not 
quite 
so obvious 
that 
4 is 
a factor 
of 
52 as 
it 
is 
that 
4 is 
a factor 
of 
32. 
The error 
in row 
2 of 
the 
c column 
is 
of 
a similar 
type, 
but 
with 
an interesting 
additional 
complication. 
The following 
ex- 
planation 
is 
essentially 
due tc 
Bruins 
[1955]: 
The successive 
steps 
in the 
factorization 
of b and c would 
be the 
following: 
(b =) 
58 27 17 30 
cc =) 
1 23 46 02 30 
. . . 
. . . 
. . . 
. . . 
(bq = 12 x b3 =) 
56 07 
(c4 = 12 x c3 =) 
1 20 25 
(c5 
= 12 x c4 =) 
16 05 
(C6 = 12 x c5 =) 
3 13 
Now clearly 
the 
last 
two 
steps 
in the 
factorization 
of 
c have 
to be canceled 
in 
order 
to have b and c reduced 
to the 
same de- 
gree. 
This 
would 
be noticed 
by the 
author 
of 
the 
text 
when 
he 

HM8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
299 
used 
the 
reduced 
values 
for 
the 
computation 
of 
the 
squares 
b2 
and c2; 
but 
later, 
when 
he-referred 
to 
the 
same notes 
for 
the 
reduced 
values 
b and c of b and c, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
see how he can 
have 
read 
the 
wrong 
values 
(56 07 , 3 13) 
instead 
of 
the 
correct 
ones 
(56 07 , 1 20 25). 
The additional 
complication 
is 
that 
the 
value 
3 13 would 
have 
been obtained 
through 
multiplication 
of 
16 05 by the 
reciprocal 
factor 
12, 
in 
the 
following 
way: 
12 x 16 05 = 3 12 + 1 = 3 13. 
Thus when 
the 
correct 
value 
3 13 was 
misread 
as 3 12 01 (or 
rather 
as 3 F 2 1, 
see Figure 
l.l), 
it 
was 
because 
the 
cuneiform 
sign 
for 
13 had been obtained 
by carelessly 
adding 
a "1" 
to 
the 
sign 
for 
"12," 
with 
a little 
too 
much space 
between 
them. 
In 
conclusion 
we can now say 
that 
all 
the 
errors 
occurring 
in 
the 
text 
of 
the 
Plimpton 
tablet 
can be explained 
as above 
with 
reference 
either 
to the 
inherent 
inadequacies 
of 
the 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
notation, 
with 
its 
absence 
of 
zeros 
and its 
way 
of 
writing 
the 
units 
by juxtaposition 
of 
"ones" 
rather 
than 
with 
individual 
signs 
as we do it, 
or 
to the 
difficulties 
in carrying 
out 
'$e 
factorization 
process 
for 
computing 
the 
squares 
of g2 
and c . 
In particular, 
the 
preceding 
analysis 
of 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
errors 
may have 
come about 
lends 
strong 
support 
to 
the 
suggestions 
made in the 
previous 
sections 
about 
how the 
computations 
were 
carried 
out 
when 
the 
table 
on Plimpton 
322 
was 
constructed. 
5. 
THE PURPOSE OF THE TEXT 
In the 
discussion 
of the 
alleged 
error 
in row 
11 of 
the 
Plimpton 
tablet, 
where 
the 
unreduced 
pair 
(45 
, 1 15) 
is 
listed 
rather 
than 
the 
corresponding 
maximally 
reduced 
pair 
(3, 
5), 
I 
suggested 
that 
the 
author 
of the 
text 
did 
not, 
after 
all, 
have 
a number-theoretical 
application 
in mind. 
If 
that 
is 
so, 
what 
then 
may the 
purpose 
of 
the 
text 
have 
been? 
In trying 
to 
ans- 
wer 
this 
question, 
I base 
my arguments 
on the 
assumption 
that 
the 
complete 
tablet 
contained 
columns 
for 
the 
values 
of 
the 
variables 
b = b(t’ 
- t), 
c = ?i(t’ + t), 
c2 
= 
14-g2, 
b=&, 
c 
= 
ac 
(see 
the 
"extended 
Plimpton 
table" 
in Figure 
2.3), 
or, 
at 
least, 
that 
the 
values 
of 5 and c had been 
computed 
and were 
available 
to 
the 
author 
of 
the 
text. 
A first 
observation 
is 
that 
there 
can be no doubt 
about 
the 

300 
J6ran 
Friberg 
HM8 
geometrical 
background 
of 
the 
text. 
Indeed, 
the 
headings 
over 
the 
three 
preserved 
columns 
(see 
Figure 
1.2), 
not 
counting 
the 
index 
column, 
are 
[ . . . -ki]-il-ti 
:i-li-ip-tim 
ib-sd 
sag 
ib-sb 
.+-li-ip-tim. 
Here 
"sag" 
and "@iptum" 
can be translated 
as 
"front" 
and "di- 
agonal," 
respectively, 
while 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
term 
"ib-sd" 
is 
less 
clear 
in 
the 
present 
connection. 
According 
to Neugebauer 
and Sachs, 
the 
term 
cannot 
here 
have 
its 
usual 
meaning 
of 
"square 
rootlW 
. . . . hence 
they 
suggest 
the 
intentionally 
vague 
transla- 
tion 
"solving 
number." 
For 
simplicity, 
I use the 
shorter 
but 
equally 
vague 
translation 
"root." 
Then the 
headings 
of the 
three 
columns 
can be translated 
in the 
following 
way: 
t . ..I 
of 
the 
diagonal 
root 
of 
the 
front 
root 
of 
the 
diagonal. 
The meaning 
of these 
headings 
is 
more or 
less 
clear: 
the 
"front" 
and the 
"diagonal" 
are, 
according 
to Babylonian 
standard 
terminology, 
respectively 
the 
shortest 
side 
and the 
hypotenuse 
of 
a right 
triangle. 
(The remaining 
longer 
side 
is 
called 
"us," 
which 
may be translated 
by the 
term 
"flank." 
The damaged word 
in the 
heading 
over 
the 
first 
column 
ought 
to have 
the 
meaning 
"square"(?), 
and the 
"root 
of 
the 
front" 
may be assumed 
to mean 
the 
maximally 
reduced 
value 
of 
the 
front, 
i.e., 
according 
to 
our 
previous 
discussion 
of the 
algorithm 
for 
the 
computation, 
the 
nonregular 
core 
of 
the 
sexagesimal 
number 
appearing 
in the 
", 
column" 
where 
the 
values 
of 
the 
front 
itself 
are 
listed. 
The 
translation 
of 
the word 
"sag" 
as front 
= shortest 
side 
is 
impor- 
tant, 
because 
it 
explains 
why 
the 
values 
in 
the 
c2 column 
de- 
crease 
from 
a maximum value 
very 
close 
to 
2, or, 
equivalently, 
why 
the 
range 
of 
the 
corEesponding 
t values 
is 
restricted 
by 
the 
condition 
that 
t 5 22 - 1. 
Namely, 
if 
2, b, 
and c are 
the 
values 
of 
the 
front, 
the 
flank 
and the 
diagonal, 
respectively, 
then 
the 
fact 
that 
a has 
the 
constant 
value 
1 implies 
that 
b < 1, hence 
that 
b2 < 1 and c2 < 2. 
Thus we can conclude 
that 
it 
may have 
been the 
intention 
of 
the 
author 
of 
the 
tablet 
to 
find 
the 
front 
and diagonal 
of all 
rational 
right 
triangles 
with 
flank 
= 1, 
under 
the 
sole 
condition, 
for 
practical 
reasons, 
that 
the 
parameter 
t = s/r 
in the 
generating 
formula 
(2.2) 
must 
be a regular 
sexagesimal 
number 
such 
that, 
for 
instance, 
s < 1 00. 
(I 
am assuming 
here, 
with 
Price 
[1964], 
that 
if 
the 
work 
on the 
tablet 
had been 
completed, 
it 
would 
have 
contained 
38, 
rather-than 
15, 
rows.) 
If 
(1, 
b, 
c) 
is 
a normalized 
Pythagorean 
triple 
with 
b < 1, 
obtained 
by use 
of the 
triangle 
parameter 
equations 
(2.2), 
with 
t regular 
and t > 2% - 1, 
then 
the 
corresponding 
primitive 
Py- 

HM8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
301 
thagorean 
triple 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
satisfies 
the 
condition 
that 
a = 2~r.s 
is 
a regular 
sexagesimal 
number. 
Hence 
every 
primitive 
Pythag- 
orean 
triple 
obtained 
in this 
way 
can be identified 
with 
the 
sides 
of 
a primitive 
rational 
Pythagorean 
triangle 
with 
the 
flank 
a given 
by a regular 
sexagesimal 
number. 
As a rule, 
the 
front 
b (= a x %(t’ 
- t)) 
is 
only 
semiregular, 
because 
the 
dif- 
ference 
between 
two 
regular 
sexagesimal 
numbers 
is 
usually 
not 
regular. 
On the 
other 
hand, 
if 
we use 
the 
triangle 
parameter 
equations 
(2.2) 
with 
t regular 
as before, 
but 
with 
t < 2% - 1, 
then 
we can obtain, 
in a similar 
way, 
the 
sides 
of 
all 
primitive 
rational 
Pythagorean 
triangles 
with 
the 
front 
regular 
but, 
as a 
rule, 
the 
flank 
semiregular. 
Consider, 
for 
instance, 
the 
case 
n = -1 of 
the 
table 
in Figure 
2.3; 
i.e., 
the 
case 
when 
t = 2/5 
= -24 < 2% - 1 = .24 
51 . . . . 
Then 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
= (20, 
21, 
29), 
and it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
flank 
21 is 
semiregular, 
while 
the 
front 
20 is 
regular. 
Thus 
even 
simple 
Pythagorean 
triples 
like 
this 
one would 
be missed 
by the 
algorithm 
used 
for 
the 
construc- 
tion 
of 
the 
table 
on the 
Plimpton 
tablet. 
This 
is 
one more 
reason 
why 
it 
does 
not 
seem likely 
that 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Plimpton 
text 
was 
to make a list 
of 
all 
(reason- 
ably 
small) 
positive 
primitive 
Pythagorean 
triples. 
The few 
cases 
when 
both 
the 
"side" 
and the 
"front" 
of 
a primitive 
Py- 
thagorean 
triangle 
are 
regular 
can be identified 
easily. 
In 
fact, 
if 
b/a 
= &(t' 
- t), 
then 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
a/b 
= %(tl’ 
- tl), 
where 
tl 
= (l-t)/(l 
+ t). 
Hence, 
a and b are 
both 
regular 
if 
and only 
if 
t and tl 
are 
both 
regular, 
i.e., 
if 
and only 
if 
both 
t and 1 f t are 
regular. 
This 
condition 
is 
satisfied 
only 
for 
some very 
small 
values 
of 
r and s 
(if 
t is 
written 
in 
the 
usual 
way 
as s/r) 
since 
the 
condition 
implies 
that 
not 
only 
r and s, 
but 
also 
r + s, 
must 
be regular, 
at the 
same time 
that 
r and s are 
assumed 
to be coprime. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
these 
conditions 
are 
satisfied 
by only 
four 
pairs 
of 
"conjugate 
parameter 
values," 
t and tl, 
in the 
range 
that 
we are 
considering, 
namely, 
the 
pairs 
t, 
tl 
= l/2, 
l/3; 
2/3, 
l/5; 
3/5, 
l/4; 
l/9, 
4/5. 
The corresponding 
points 
(r, 
s) 
and 
(rl, 
~1) 
are 
indicated 
by 
small 
arrows 
in Figure 
2.1. 
The associated 
pairs 
of 
Pythagorear 
triples 
are, 
respectively, 
(4, 
3, 
5), 
(3, 
4, 
5); 
(12, 
5, 13), 
(5, 
12, 
13); 
(15, 
8, 
17), 
(8, 
15, 
17); 
(40, 
9, 41), 
(9, 
40, 
41). 
Thus 
there 
are 
essentially 
only 
four 
such 
primitive 
positive 
Pythagorean 
triangles 
with 
both 
of 
the 
shorter 
sides 
regular. 
It 
is 
worth 
mentioning 
that 
the 
primitive 
Pythagorean 
triples 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
with 
either 
a or 
b regular 
make up only 
a small 
frac- 

302 
Jaran 
Friberg 
HM 8 
tion 
of 
the 
set 
of 
all 
primitive 
Pythagorean 
triples. 
Thus 
in 
a list 
of 
the 
447 primitive 
Pythagorean 
triples 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
with 
c < 3000 
[Martin 
19121, 
only 
9 of 
the 
15 triples 
associated 
with 
the 
Plimpton 
tablet 
are 
present. 
The simplest 
of all 
the 
triples 
in 
this 
list 
with 
both 
a and b nonregular 
is 
(56, 
33, 
65). 
It 
still 
remains 
to explain 
the 
reason 
for 
the presence 
of 
the 
"c2 
column" 
on the 
Plimpton 
tablet. 
In order 
to be able 
to 
do this 
we start 
by making 
the 
following 
simple 
but 
extremely 
important 
observation. 
With 
very 
few 
exceptions 
all 
Babylonian 
mathematical 
problem 
texts 
contain 
problems 
whose 
solutions 
are 
rational 
numbers 
or, 
more precisely, 
semiregular 
numbers 
which 
can be expressed 
by use of 
the 
Babylonian 
sexagesimal 
notation. 
It 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
authors 
of these 
Babylonian 
mathematical 
texts 
must 
have devoted 
a lot 
of work 
and ingenuity 
in choosing 
the 
right 
kind 
of 
data 
in 
their 
formulation 
of 
the 
problems, 
and 
in devising 
problems 
they 
knew 
would 
possess 
solutions 
of 
the 
indicated 
kind. 
For 
brevity, 
I call 
such 
problems 
solvable. 
For 
example, 
the 
problem 
of 
finding 
the 
third 
side 
of 
a right 
triangle 
when 
two 
of 
the 
sides 
are 
given 
becomes 
"solvable" 
only 
if 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
given 
triangle 
are 
multiples 
of 
the 
sides 
of 
a primitive 
Pythagorean 
triangle 
with 
one of 
the 
shorter 
sides 
regular. 
Thus 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
tables 
on the 
Plimpton 
tablet 
was 
not 
an interest 
in number- 
theoretical 
questions, 
but 
rather 
the 
need to find 
data 
for 
a 
"solvable" 
mathematical 
problem. 
More precisely, 
it 
is 
my be- 
lief 
that 
the purpose 
of 
the 
author 
of 
Plimpton 
322 was 
to 
write 
a "teacher's 
aid" 
for 
setting 
up and solving 
problems 
involving 
right 
triangles. 
In 
fact, 
a typical 
Babylonian 
prob- 
lem text 
contains 
not 
only 
the 
formulation 
of 
the 
problem 
but 
also 
the 
details 
of 
its 
numerical 
solution 
for 
the 
given 
data. 
Hence 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
table 
on the 
(intact) 
Plimpton 
tablet 
would 
have 
given 
a teacher 
the 
opportunity 
to 
set 
up a large 
number 
of 
solved 
problems 
involving 
right 
triangles, 
with 
full 
numerical 
details, 
as well 
as to 
formulate 
a series 
of 
exer- 
cises 
for 
his 
students 
where 
only 
the 
necessary 
data 
were 
given, 
although 
the 
teacher 
knew 
that 
the 
problem 
was 
solvable, 
and 
where 
he could 
check 
the 
numerical 
details 
of 
the 
students' 
solutions 
by using 
the 
numbers 
in 
the 
table. 
For 
example, 
if 
the 
given 
problem 
was 
to find 
the 
diagonal 
c of 
a right 
triangle 
with 
flank 
1 and front 
b, 
then 
the 
steps 
of the 
computation 
would 
be: 
to compute 
the 
nonregular 
core 
of b (listed 
in the 
b column 
of 
the 
tablet), 
then 
the 
square 
of this 
nonregular 
factor 
and, 
by means of 
it, 
the 
squares 
b2 and c2 = b2 + 1 
(listed 
in 
the 
c2 column), 
after 
which 
a root 
extraction, 
exe- 
cuted 
(for 
instance) 
by use 
of 
the 
factorization 
method, 
would 
yield 
the 
desired 
value 
of c (listed 
in the 
c column). 
With 
this 
explanation 
the 
role 
of 
the 
c2 column 
as well 
as of the 
b and c columns 
on Plimpton 
322 becomes 
perfectly 
clear.

There 
is 
also 
the 
interesting 
possibility 
of 
a close 
con- 
nection 
between 
the 
"Babylonian 
triangle 
parameter 
,equations" 
(2.2) 
and the 
treatment 
of 
some types 
of quadratic 
equations 
in Babylonian 
mathematics. 
In fact, 
suppose 
that 
either 
b or 
c is 
known 
and that 
we want 
to 
find 
the 
parameter 
t which 
gen- 
erates 
this 
particular 
z or c value 
when 
inserted 
into 
Eqs. 
(2.2). 
If 
c is 
known, 
then 
we have 
to 
solve 
the 
following 
equation 
for 
t: 
t' 
+ t = 2c 
(t't 
= 1, 0 < t < 1). 
BI 
This 
type 
of 
equation, 
which 
is 
known 
from 
several 
Babylonian 
mathematical 
problem 
texts, 
is 
a special 
case 
of 
the 
first 
Baby- 
lonian 
type 
of 
"quadratic 
equation" 
[Gandz 
1937, 
405-4061. 
The 
equation 
is 
called 
"quadratic" 
because 
if 
t is 
a solution 
of 
B I, 
then 
t and t’ 
are 
identical 
with 
the 
two 
(positive) 
solu- 
tions 
of 
the 
following 
true 
quadratic 
equation 
(also 
known 
from 
some Babylonian 
texts): 
x2 + 1 = 2cx. 
B IX 
Similarly, 
if 
5 is 
known, 
then 
t can be computed 
as the 
solution 
of 
the 
equation 
t' 
-t=2b 
(t't 
= 1, 0 < t < 1). 
B II 
This 
equation 
is 
a special 
case 
of 
the 
second 
Babylonian 
type 
of 
"quadratic 
equations," 
and if 
t is 
a solution 
of 
B II, 
then 
t 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
positive 
solution 
of the 
true 
quadratic 
equation 
x2 + 2bx = 1, 
B VII 
while 
the 
reciprocal 
number 
t’ 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
positive 
solution 
of 
the 
quadratic 
equation 
x2 - 25x = 1. 
B VIII 
(The remaining 
types 
of 
"quadratic 
equations" 
known 
from 
Baby- 
lonian 
texts 
are 
not 
discussed 
here.

instance 
[Gandz

and also

19791.) 
An elegant 
and typically 
Babylonian 
method 
of 
solving 
Eq.

nicely 
exemplified 
by a sequence

lems

(A special 
sign 
was 
used 
in astronomical 
and mathematical 
cunei- 
form 
texts 
from 
the 
Seleucid 
period 
in order 
to indicate 
missing 
tens 
or 
units 
in 
sexagesimal 
numbers: 
the

is 
represented 
by a "colon" 
in the 
"conformal" 
transliterations 
of

in the 
first 
of the 
four 
cases 
above.) 
It 
is 
important 
to notice 
that 
the 
four 
equations 
of 
type 
B I appearing 
in the 
problem 
text 
A0 6484 were 
not 
solved 
in 
the 
way 
in which 
they 
would 
be solved 
today, 
starting 
with 
the 
replacement 
of 
the 
given 
equation 
of 
type 
B I by the 
correspond- 
ing 
quadratic 
equation 
of 
type 
B IX. 
It 
is 
not 
even 
necessarily 
true 
that 
the 
Babylonian 
mathematicians 
were 
aware 
of 
the 
pos- 
sibility 
of 
transforming 
the 
two 
types 
of equations 
into 
each 
other. 
In 
any case, 
equations 
of 
type 
B I or B II 
were 
solved 
by use of 
an algorithm 
proceeding 
via 
the 
computation 
of 
a 
series 
of 
intermediary 
values 
as in 
(5.1) 
above; 
this 
is 
illus- 
trated 
by the 
four 
explicitly 
solved 
examples 
in 
the 
text 
A0 
6484. 
The connection 
between 
this 
algorithm 
and 
(my proposed 
reconstruction 
of) 
the 
table 
on Plimpton 
322 is 
obvious. 
Thus 
it 
is 
conceivable 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
considering 
equa- 
tions 
of types 
B I and B II 
and solving 
them in a series 
of 
steps 
(as 
in 
(5.1)) 
originated 
in a study 
of problems 
concerned 
with 
the 
generation 
of 
Pythagorean 
triples 
and with 
methods 
for 
finding 
relations 
between 
the 
sides 
of 
Pythagorean 
triangles. 
It 
is 
also 
conceivable 
that 
a secondary 
purpose 
of 
the 
Plimpton 
table 
may have 
been 
to facilitate 
the 
setting 
up and solving 
of 
equations 
of 
types 
B I and B II. 
Indeed, 
if 
we look 
at 
the 
t values 
used 
in the 
formulation 
of the 
four 
problems 
involving 
B type 
equations 
on A0 6484, 
and if 
we write 
these 
t values 
as 

HM8 
Plimpton

rational 
numbers 
of 
the 
form

then 
we obtain, 
in the 
respec- 
tive 
cases, 
s/r

20/27, 
15/16.

indicated 
by 
four 
small 
arrows. 
The distribution 
of 
these 
points 
in the 
di- 
agram 
suggests 
that 
the 
author 
of A0 6484 may have 
had recourse 
to 
an "extended 
Plimpton 
table" 
of 
the 
type 
proposed 
by Price 
119641. 
Of particular 
interest 
is 
the 
location 
in 
the 
diagram 
of 
the 
point 
(121, 
120). 
This 
point 
is 
obviously 
closer 
to the 
line 
t = 1 than 
any other 
point 
in the 
diagram, 
a circumstance 
which 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
corresponding 
c value, 
which 
is 
1 00 00 16 40, 
is 
very 
close 
to 
1. 
In fact, 
it 
is 
pos- 
sible 
that 
this 
particular 
case 
was 
considered 
by the 
author 
of 
the 
text 
for 
didactic 
reasons 
precisely 
because 
it 
involved 
com- 
putations 
with 
sexagesimal 
numbers 
with 
so many missing 
tens 
and units 
that 
the 
computations 
would 
have 
been quite 
hard 
to 
carry 
out 
successfully 
without 
the 
use 
of 
the 
"colon" 
sign 
for 
such 
missing 
units. 
The tablet 
BM 13901 
of 
the 
British 
Museum 
[Neugebauer 
1937, 
2-151, 
which 
is 
one of 
the 
oldest 
known 
Babylonian 
mathematical 
texts, 
is 
an important 
compendium 
of quadratic 
equations 
of 
several 
different 
types. 
It 
has been discussed 
in great 
detail 
by Gandz 
[1937] 
in his 
important 
work 
on the 
origin 
and develop- 
ment of 
quadratic 
equations 
in Babylonian, 
Greek, 
and early 
Arabic 
algebra. 
Gandz 
devoted 
particular 
attention 
to one of 
the 
equations, 
No. 
23, 
on this 
tablet, 
because 
its 
solution 
was 
computed 
in a somewhat 
unexpected 
way. 
The equation, 
which 
we 
would 
write 
in the 
form 
x2 + 2px = q, 
P = 2, 
q = 41 40 (= 502), 
(5.2) 
is 
clearly 
of type 
B VII, 
in a slightly 
more 
general 
case 
than 
the 
case 
q = 1 which 
we have 
considered 
before. 
The solution 
of 
this 
equation, 
as given 
in the 
text, 
proceeds 
in a number 
of 
steps 
with 
the 
successive 
computation 
of the 
following 
inter- 
mediate 
numbers: 
15 x 41 40 = 10 25 (= 252), 
1 + 10 25 = 1 10 25 (= 
(1 05)2), 
1 05, 
5, 10. 
Thus 
it 
appears 
that 
if 
we set 
q = m2, then 
the 
method 
of 
solu- 
tion 
of 
the 
equation 
x2 + 2px = m2, in this 
example, 
consists 
in the 
successive 
computation 
of 
the 
numbers

x In2 = (m&2, 
1 + (m/p)2 
= (n/p)2, 
n/p, n/p - 1, P x (n/p 
- 1) = n - p. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
intermediate 
equation 
(x + p)2 
= p2 + m2 is 
solved 
by writing 
the 
term 
p2 + m2 in the 
factorized 
form 
p2 X (1 + (rn/~)~)‘, 
after 
which 
a simple 
reference 
to 
some table 
of 
the 
Plimpton 
type 
makes 
it 
possible 
to proceed 
with 
the 
al- 
gorithm. 
It 
is 
a rather 
remarkable 
fact 
that 
Gandz, 
to whom 
this 
analysis 
is 
due, 
was 
led 
by this 
example 
to 
conjecture 
[1937, 
5061 that 
"the 
Babylonians 
may have 
had a table 
of such 
fractional 
squares 
which 
would 
give 
a new square 
with 
9." 
In 
other 
words, 
Gandz conjectured 
the 
existence 
of 
a Babylonian 
table 
of the 
Plimpton 
type 
8 years 
before 
the 
tablet 
Plimpton 
322 was 
published 
by Neugebauer 
and Sachs!

REFLECTIONS 
ON THE ORIGIN 
OF THE "PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM" 
Although 
Plimpton 
322 is 
a unique 
text 
of 
its 
kind, 
there 
are 
several 
other 
known 
texts 
testifying 
that 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
was 
well 
known 
to 
the 
mathematicians 
of 
the 
Old Baby- 
lonian 
period. 
A particularly 
clear 
example 
is 
given 
by an Old 
Babylonian 
problem 
text 
from 
Tell 
Dhiba'i 
[Baqir 
19621. 
In this 
text, 
which 
is 
accompanied 
by a simple 
geometric 
drawing, 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
compute 
the 
sides 
of 
a rectangle, 
given 
the 
length 
of 
the 
diagonal 
and the 
area: 
c = 1 15, 
A = 45. 
The algorithm 
for 
the 
solution 
and its 
subsequent 
verification 
consists 
in 
the 
successive 
computation 
of 
the 
following 
quantities: 
c2 - 2A = (a - b)2, 
%(a - b), 
ab + (%(a - b))2 
= (%(a + b))2, 
%(a + b), 
$(a 
+ b) 
2 %(a - b) 
= a, b, 
a2 + b2 = c2, 
c, 
ab = A. 
As it 
turns 
out, 
the 
given 
rectangle 
is 
composed 
of 
two 
congruent 
triangles 
with 
the 
sides 
(1, 
45 , 1 15). 
A couple 
of other 
examples 
(YBC 7289 
[Neugebauer 
and Sachs 
19451, 
and VAT 6598 
[Neugebauer 
1935, 
I, 
2821) 
show 
that 
the 
Old Babylonian 
mathematicians 
were 
also 
able 
to handle 
applica- 
tions 
of 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
in the 
case 
of nonrational 
triangles, 
i.e., 
when 
the 
solutions 
of 
the 
problems 
involved 
approximate 
computations 
of 
square 
roots. 
As a rule, 
however, 
the 
Babylonians 
preferred 
to deal 
only 
with 
rational 
right 
tri- 
angles, 
in accordance 
with 
the 
general 
convention 
that 
only 
problems 
leading 
to rational 
(semiregular) 
solutions 
should 
be 
considered. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
to 
find 
that 
the 

HM8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
307 
Babylonian 
mathematicians 
were 
familiar 
with 
a certain 
type 
of 
cleverly 
devised 
problems 
(concerned 
with 
relations 
between 
the 
sides 
of 
a right 
triangle) 
leading 
to linear 
rather 
than 
quadra- 
tic 
equations, 
and, 
therefore, 
always 
solvable 
in 
terms 
of ra- 
tional 
numbers 
for 
arbitrarily 
given 
rational 
data. 
One such 
example 
is 
problem 
No. 
12 in 
the 
combined 
problem 
text 
BM 34568 
from 
the 
Seleucid 
period 
[Neugebauer 
1937, 
14-221. 
A cane 
is 
leaning 
against 
a wall. 
3 cubits 
it 
has 
come 
down, 
9 cubits 
it 
has 
gone out. 
How much is 
the 
cane, 
how much the 
wall? 
I do not 
know 
their 
numbers. 
The solution 
is 
given 
in 
the 
following 
series 
of 
steps 
(see 
Figure 
6.la) 
(1) 
u = 3, 
a = 9: $(a2 
+ u2) 
= 45, 
1.2' = 3' 
= 20, 
u' 
X %(a2 + 2) 
= 15 = c; 
(2) 
C = 15, 
a = 9: 
C2 
- a2 = 2 24 = b2, 
b = 12. 
Thus we see that 
in this 
problem 
the 
length 
of 
the 
diagonal 
c 
is 
computed 
by means 
of 
the 
formula 
c = %(a2 + u2)/u, 
while 
the 
side 
b is 
found 
by using 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem. 
An equivalent 
way 
of writing 
this 
expression 
for 
c is 
c = +(a 2 + u2)/u 
= al, 
c = +(t' 
+ t), 
t = u/a. 
(6.1) 
This is precisely 
the formula 
for c which is obtained 
from the 
second of the two triangle 
parameter 
equations 
(2.2), 
if 
both 
sides of the equation 
are multiplied 
by the same factor 
a.

particular, 
(6.1) 
implies 
that 
b = ab = %(a2 
- u2)/a, 
and that 
the 
solution 
(b, 
c) 
of 
the 
problem 
will 
be a pair 
of 
rational 
(semiregular) 
numbers 
for 
any choice 
of rational 
parameters 
a 
and u (with 
t = u/a 
regular). 
Hence 
the 
cane-against-a-wall 
problem 
of BM 34568:12 
can be used 
to 
generate 
Pythagorean 
tri- 
ples 
in precisely 
the 
same way 
as the 
triangle 
parameter 
equa- 
tions 
(2.2). 
This 
problem 
is, 
therefore, 
a first 
example 
of 
what 
I shall 
refer 
to 
as various 
kinds 
of 
triangle 
parameter 
problems. 
In addition 
to 
the 
cane-against-a-wall 
problem, 
with 
the 
pa- 
rameters 
a and u = c - b, 
the 
above-mentioned 
Seleucid 
combined 
problem 
text 
BM 34568 
contains 
also 
three 
other 
types 
of tri- 
angle 
parameter 
problems, 
with 
the 
parameter 
pairs 
(b, 
c + a), 
(a I c + b), 
and 
(ab, 
c + a + b), 
respectively. 
(See the 
system- 
atic 
description 
in 
[Neugebauer 
1937, 
201.) 
However, 
the 
cane- 
against-a-wall 
problem 
is 
the 
only 
one of 
the 
four 
triangle 
parameter 
problems 
in BM 34568 which 
is 
given 
a "dressed 
up," 
easily 
visualized 
form; 
the 
remaining 
three 
problems 
are 
form- 
ulated 
as abstract 
algebraic 
problems. 
Consequently, 
the 
cane- 
against-a-wall 
problem 
of 
BM 34568:12 
could 
well 
be the 
prototype 
for 
the 
other 
types 
of 
triangle 
parameter 
problems 
appearing 
in 
BM 34568. 
This 
suspicion 
is 
confirmed 
by the 
fact 
that 
the 
cane- 
against-a-wall 
problem 
appears 
in a late 
Old Babylonian 
(or 
Kassite) 
text. 
This 
text 
is 
the 
combined 
problem 
text 
BM 85196 
[Neugebauer 
1935, 
II, 
43-591, 
which 
out 
of 
18 assorted 
problems 
contains 
only 
1 (No. 
9) having 
anything 
to do with 
right 
trian- 
gles. 
A free 
translation 
of the 
text 
of 
this 
particular 
problem 
reads 
as follows: 
A wooden 
beam is 
leaning 
against 
a wall. 
The length 
of 
the 
beam is 
30 length-units. 
If 
the 
top 
of 
the beam 
slides 
down 
6 units, 
how much then 
does 
the 
lower 
end 
slide 
out 
along 
the 
ground? 
Conversely, 
if 
it 
slides 
out 
18 units 
along 
the 
ground, 
how much does 
it 
slide 
down 
above? 
The answers 
to 
the 
two 
closely 
related 
questions 
in this 
problem 
are 
obtained 
by applying 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem: 
(1) 
c = 30, 
u = 6: 
c2 = 15, 
(c - u)~ 
= b2 = 9 36, 
c2 - b2 = 5 24 = a2, 
a = 18. 
(2) 
c = 30, 
a = 18: 
a2 = 5 24, 
c2 - a2 = 9 36 = b2, 
b = 24, 
c-b=6=u. 

HM 8

Due to their 
solvability 
in terms 
of 
rational 
numbers, 
tri- 
angle 
parameter 
problems 
of 
a number 
of 
types 
seem to have 
en- 
joyed 
a great 
popularity 
all 
through 
the 
history 
of 
ancient 
mathematics. 
The only 
exception 
is 
their 
absence 
from 
Greek 
mathematics, 
although 
at least 
the 
generating 
formula 
(2.2) 
was 
known 
to Euclid 
and possibly 
also 
to Pythagoras. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
the 
reason 
such 
problems 
were 
not 
considered 
by Greek 
math- 
ematicians 
is 
that 
they, 
through 
their 
theory 
of proportions 
and 
in other 
ways, 
had developed 
techniques 
which 
were 
independent 
of 
the 
old 
ways 
of 
formulating 
rationally 
solvable 
mathematical 
problems. 
In ancient 
Hindu 
mathematics, 
on the 
other 
hand, 
several 
ingeniously 
dressed-up 
variants 
of 
the 
basic 
types 
of 
triangle 
parameter 
problems 
appear 
in, 
for 
instance, 
Brahmagupta's 
Brahms-sphuta-siddhanta 
(628) 
and Bhaskara's 
Lilavat? 
(1150) 
(see 
[Datta 
and Singh 
1962]), 
and there 
are 
good reasons 
to 
believe 
that 
a method 
allowing 
the 
systematic 
generation 
of 
Pythagorean 
triangles 
was 
already 
known 
to 
the 
authors 
of the 
Sulba-Sutras, 
several 
centuries 
B.C. 
Similarly, 
the 
oldest 
known 
Chinese 
book 
of mathematical 
problems, 
the 
Chiu 
Chang 
Suan 
Shu from 
the 
Han dynasty 
(202-9 
B.C.), 
contains 
in its 
ninth 
and last 
chapter 
many triangle 
parameter 
problems 
of various 
types, 
all 
as ingeniously 
dressed-up 
as their 
counterparts 
in 
the 
LIlavat? 
[Vogel 
19681. 
The "original" 
cane-against-a-wall 
problem 
also 
appears 
in 
the 
demotic 
Cairo 
Papyrus 
from 
the 
third 
century 
B.C. 
[Parker 
1972, 
34-401, 
and, 
for 
example, 
in the 
writings 
of 
Leonardo 
of 
Pisa 
(1170-1240 
A.D.). 
Further 
refer- 
ences 
can be found 
in 
[Tropfke 
1980, 
616-625; 
Pottage 
19731. 
As a result 
of 
the 
above 
discussion 
of 
triangle 
parameter 
problems 
in general 
and of 
the 
Babylonian 
cane-against-a-wall 
problem 
in particular, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
assert 
that 
Plimpton 
322, 
with 
its 
systematic 
list 
of 
sides 
of 
Pythagorean 
triangles, 
is, 
after 
all, 
not 
an outstanding 
and isolated 
achievement 
of 
Old Babylonian 
mathematics, 
but 
rather 
a natural 
complement 
to 
what 
was 
probably 
a well-developed 
geometric-algebraic 
theory. 
In this 
connection 
it 
is 
worth 
mentioning 
that 
the 
Old Babylonian 
mathematicians 
were 
also 
familiar 
with 
a certain 
trapezoid 
par- 
tition 
problem, 
rationally 
solvable 
like 
the 
various 
types 
of 
triangle 
parameter 
problems. 
(See 
[Bruins 
and Rutten 
1961, 
114-117; 
Vaiman 
1955, 
72; 
Friberg 
1980a, 
421.) 
In fact, 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
trapezoid 
partition 
problem 
leads 
in a 
straightforward 
way 
to 
the 
setting 
up of 
a generating 
formula 
similar 
to 
(2.2) 
for 
the 
systematic 
construction 
of 
rational 
solutions 
of 
the 
indeterminate 
equation 
m2 + n2 = 2q2. 
(As is 
well 
known 
this 
equation 
is 
closely 
related 
to the 
Pythagorean 
equation, 
into 
which 
it 
can be transformed 
by means 
of 
the 
substitution 
(a, 
b, 
c) 
= ($ (n - m), 
4 (n + m), 
q) .) 
Thus 
the 
relatively 
well-documented 
appearance 
of 
the 
trapezoid 
partition 
problem 
in texts 
from 
the 
Old Babylonian 
period 
(the 
problem 
is 

310 
J&an 
Friberg 
HM 8 
not 
known 
from 
any later 
texts!) 
lends 
strong 
support 
to the 
con- 
jecture 
that 
the 
Old Babylonian 
mathematicians 
were 
in possession 
of 
a well-developed 
theory 
for 
analyzing 
certain 
types 
of 
ration- 
ally 
solvable 
problems 
involving 
indeterminate 
quadratic 
equations 
and for 
obtaining 
their 
solution 
formulas 
of 
type 
(2.2). 
It 
must 
be stressed, 
however, 
that 
there 
are 
reasons 
to 
believe 
that 
such 
a theory, 
if 
it 
ever 
existed, 
would 
tend 
to 
lose 
its 
attraction 
and begin 
to 
degenerate 
after 
it 
had been 
used 
to build 
up a 
sufficiently 
large 
stock 
of data 
(the 
table 
on Plimpton 
322, 
for 
instance). 
A typical 
example 
of 
this 
is 
provided 
by the 
cane- 
against-a-wall 
problem 
of 
Figure 
6.la. 
If 
a and u are 
chosen 
as the 
parameters 
in 
this 
problem, 
then 
it 
becomes 
a true 
tri- 
angle 
parameter 
problem, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
it 
is 
rationally 
solvable 
for 
all 
choices 
of 
rational 
values 
of 
the 
parameters. 
If, 
on the 
other 
hand, 
c and u = c - b, 
or b and u = c - b are 
chosen 
as the 
parameters, 
then 
the 
problem 
becomes 
rationally 
solvable 
only 
for 
certain 
rational 
values 
of 
the 
parameters; 
it 
is 
therefore 
an inverted 
triangle 
parameter 
problem. 
This 
dis- 
tinction 
between 
true 
and inverted 
triangle 
parameter 
problems, 
however, 
is 
not 
noticeable 
to a person 
who 
just 
copies, 
without 
trying 
to change 
the 
given 
data, 
a few 
examples 
from 
an old 
text. 
This 
may be why 
the 
Babylonian 
text 
BM 85196:9 
(quoted 
above), 
as well 
as the 
Cairo 
Papyrus, 
contains 
only 
variants 
of 
the 
cane-against-a-wall 
problem 
which 
can be classified 
as inverted 
triangle 
parameter 
problems. 
In both 
cases 
it 
may safely 
be 
assumed 
that 
the problems 
were 
randomly 
copied 
from 
more exten- 
sive 
and systematic 
older 
texts 
concerned 
exclusively 
with 
triangle 
parameter 
problems 
and related 
types 
of problems 
(such 
as the 
Seleucid 
text 
BM 34568). 
I have 
given 
an intentionally 
brief 
survey 
of what 
is 
known 
about 
the 
early 
history 
of 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
and the 
re- 
lated 
theory 
of triangle 
parameter 
problems 
and generating 
form- 
ulas 
for 
Pythagorean 
triangles. 
One question 
still 
remains: 
how did 
the 
Old Babylonian 
mathematicians 
originally 
discover 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
and their 
methods 
of 
constructing 
Pythagorean 
triangles, 
etc.? 
For 
obvious 
reasons, 
this 
is 
a 
question 
to which 
no definitive 
answer 
will 
ever 
be found. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
may be worth 
the 
effort 
to 
try 
to 
identify 
at 
least 
some way 
in which 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
can have 
been 
discovered. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
start 
by making 
a preliminary 
screening 
in order 
to eliminate 
the most 
unlikely 
potential 
answers. 
In- 
deed, 
there 
is 
no shortage 
of candidates; 
in 
[Loomis 
19681 are 
listed 
109 "algebraic" 
proofs, 
255 "geometric" 
proofs, 
etc., 
of 
the 
theorem. 
Most 
of 
these 
proofs, 
however, 
fail 
to 
satisfy 
a 
first 
basic 
requirement, 
precisely 
because 
of their 
nature 
as 
constructed 
proofs 
of a known 
or 
conjectured 
theorem. 
Indeed, 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
is 
not 
the 
kind 
of 
theorem 
which, 
while 

HM8 
Plimpton 
322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
311 
obviously 
true, 
has 
a proof 
that 
can be difficult 
to 
find. 
Also, 
the 
notion 
of 
a formal 
proof 
seems 
to have 
been unknown 
to the 
Babylonians. 
Thus, 
it 
appears 
that 
only 
one alternative 
remains: 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
must 
have 
been found 
by accident 
in the 
course 
of 
some independent 
geometric 
investigation. 
Hence, 
we 
must 
not 
seek 
a proof 
of the 
Pythagorean 
theorem, 
but 
a geometric 
problem 
whose 
solution 
has 
the 
theorem 
as a corollary. 
Further- 
more, 
there 
is 
the 
condition 
that 
any proposed 
original 
derivation 
of 
the 
theorem 
can be accepted 
only 
if 
it 
makes 
use 
exclusively 
of 
methods 
and concepts 
that 
we know 
were 
available 
to mathema- 
ticians 
of 
the 
Old Babylonian 
period. 
Consider 
for 
instance 
the 
possibly 
oldest 
known 
proof 
of 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem, 
found 
in Euclid's 
Elements 
I:47 
[Heath 
1956, 
I, 
3491. 
Clearly 
this 
proof 
does 
not 
meet 
any of 
the 
requirements 
given 
above, 
because 
(1) 
it 
is 
without 
doubt 
a proof 
constructed 
for 
the 
purpose, 
and 
(2) 
it 
makes 
use 
of 
several 
concepts 
foreign 
to Babylonian 
mathematics, 
such 
as angles 
and parallel 
lines. 
On the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
look 
at Euclid's 
proof 
as 
a clever 
elaboration 
of 
a certain 
more 
elementary 
proof, 
which 
from 
Euclid's 
point 
of 
view 
had the 
disadvantage 
that 
it 
makes 
use 
of the 
concept 
of 
similar 
triangles, 
so that 
it 
would 
not 
fit 
into 
the 
general 
plan 
for 
the 
first 
book 
of the 
Elements, 
where 
the 
theory 
of proportions 
has not 
yet 
been developed. 
(See Thomas 
[1951, 
1811.) 
The proof 
in question 
(see 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
generalized 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
in 
the 
Elements, 
VI:31) 
is 
based 
on the 
observation 
that 
the 
altitude 
drawn 
against 
the 
hypotenuse 
divides 
a given 
right 
triangle 
into 
two 
subtriangles 
similar 
to the 
given 
triangle. 
Hence, 
if 
we use 
the 
notations 
of Figure 
6.lb 
in the 
case 
y = 0 and x = a, we find 
that 
u:a 
= a:c, 
v:b 
= b:c, 
u+v=c 
implies 
u = a2/c, 
v = b2/c, 
c = (a2 + b2)/c. 
This 
simple 
proof 
looks 
so much like 
a prototype 
for 
Euclid's 
proof 
that 
it 
has 
sometimes 
been assumed 
that 
it 
is 
essentially 
identical 
with 
the 
lost 
original 
proof 
usually 
attributed 
to 
Pythagoras 
(except 
that 
Pythagoras 
would 
not 
have used 
our 
mod- 
ern 
algebraic 
notations). 
Suitably 
modified, 
the 
proof 
can 
even be made to 
satisfy 
the 
requirements 
which 
must 
be satisfied 
by a candidate 
for 
the 
original 
Babylonian 
proof 
or derivation 
of 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem. 
In fact, 
such 
a modified 
proof 
would 
have 
had to be based 
on the 
following 
(reconstructed) 
Babylonian 
similarity 
theorem: 
The inclination 
(%-gal), 
i.e., 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
front 
and the 
flank, 
is 
the 
same for 
a 
given 
right 
triangle 
and for 
every 
subtriangle 
cut 
out 
of 
the 
given 
triangle 
by a perpendicular 
to either 
the 
front, 
the 
flank, 
or 
the 
diagonal 
of 
the 
given 
triangle. 
In the 
notations 
of 

312 
J&an 
Friberg 
HM8 
Figure 
6.lb 
(once 
more with 
y = 0 and x = a) 
the 
inclination 
of 
the 
given 
triangle 
would 
be equal 
to b = b/a, 
and it 
would follow 
from the similarity 
theorem that 
h = bu, 
v = bh 
= b2u, 
c=u+v 
implies 
c = (1 + b2)u, 
2A = hc 
= b(l 
+ b2)u2, 
where A is the area of the triangle. 
Since 2A is also equal to 
ba 
= ba2, 
it 
would further 
follow 
that 
a2 = (1 + b2)u2, 
which is 
the Pythagorean 
equation 
for the subtriangle 
with 
the sides, 
u, 
h=bu, 
anda. 
Hence we see that 
the Pythagorean 
theorem could, 
indeed, 
have been discovered 
by accident, 
as a corollary 
to the 
solution 
of the problem of finding 
the length 
of the projection 
u of the flank 
on the diagonal, 
when the flank 
a and the front 
b of a right 
triangle 
are given. 
The documentation 
necessary 
to prove that 
the Old Babylonian 
mathematicians 
were familiar 
with 
a 
similarity 
theorem of the 
type indicated 
above is provided 
by the important 
text 
IM 55357 
from Tell 
Harmal [Baqir 
19501. 
In this 
text 
(see Figure 
6.2) 
the standard 
(1 , 45 , 1 15) triangle 
is divided 
into 
a series 
of subtriangles 
by means of lines 
alternately 
perpendicular 
to 
the diagonal 
and the flank 
of the given 
triangle. 
The areas of 
the subtriangles 
are given, 
and the problem consists 
in computing 
the sides of the subtriangles. 
This is clearly 
done by use of 
some similarity 
theorem. 
The computation 
proceeds in a series 
of steps as follows: 
a'b 
x 2B1 = 12 09 = v12, 
v1 = 27, 
(%vl)' 
X B1 = 36 = hl, 
c - 
Vl 
= 48 = u1;

In other 
words, 
the 
algorithm 
used 
here 
is 
based 
on the 
two 
relations 
v 2 = (hi.&-Q 
x 2Bi , hi 
= Bi/%vi 
, 
i 
i = 1, 2, 
. . . (UO = a, ho = b). 
Since 
2Bi = hivi, 
we can remove 
the 
common factor 
vi 
from 
both 
sides 
of 
these 
two 
equations, 
obtaining 
an equivalent 
set 
of 
recursion 
formulas: 
V. 1 = (hisl/uiml) 
x hi, 
hi 
= Bi/ki 
, 
i = 1, 
2, 
. . . - 
Hence we can explain 
how the 
author 
of 
IM 55357 derived 
his 
algorithm 
if 
we assume 
that 
he knew 
the 
area 
formula 
for 
right 
triangles 
and the 
similarity 
theorem, 
described 
above, 
for 
right 
triangles. 
(The numerical 
values 
of the 
subareas 
which 
were 
given 
in the 
formulation 
of 
the 
problem 
could 
have 
been 
computed 
by use of 
the 
same similarity 
theorem 
in 
the 
following 
way: 
knowing 
that 
c = 1 15, 
it 
follows 
that 
hl 
= 2A/c 
= b/c, 
hence 
that 
VI = bhl 
= b2/c 
(!), 
and ul = c - vl. 
Repeating 
the 
same process 
one can compute 
h2, 
~2, 
~2, 
etc., 
and, 
finally, 
the 
areas 
Bl, 
B2, 
Bg, As.) 
As has 
been observed 
by Bruins 
[1962, 
3121, 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
well-known 
(1 , 45 , 1 15) 
triangle 
figures 
in the 
formu- 
lation 
of 
the problem 
on IM 55357 
is 
not 
so coincidental 
as it 
may appear. 
In 
fact, 
relatively 
few 
Pythagorean 
triangles 
share 
with 
the 
(1 , 45 , 1 15) 
triangle 
the property 
of 
having 
a diagonal 
which 
can be represented 
by a regular 
sexagesimal 
number; 
and if 
the 
diagonal 
c had not 
been regular, 
then 
the 
derived 
numbers 
hl 
= b/c, 
v1 = b2/c, 
ul = c - vl, 
etc., 
would 
not 
have 
been 
semiregular. 
For 
precisely 
this 
reason 
it 
can 
be assumed 
that 
the 
(1 , 45 , 1 15) 
triangle 
and its 
multiples-- 
the 
(3, 
4, 
5) triangle, 
for 
example--were 
favorite 
objects 
for 
geometric 
experimentation 
in 
the 
early 
phases 
of 
the 
development 
of Old Babylonian 
mathematics. 
It 
is 
perhaps 
against 
this 
background 
that 
one has to 
look 
for 
an explanation 
of 
the 
ap- 
pearance 
of 
the 
strangely 
formulated 
first 
problem 
of the 
Seleucid 
combined 
problem

Flank 
4, front 
3, what 
is 
the 
diagonal? 
I do not 
know 
its 
number. 
Add one half 
of 
your 
flank 
to your 
front, 
and that 
is 
it: 
The flank 
4 times 
30 
is 
2; 
2 plus 
3 is 
5; 
5 is 
the 
diagonal. 
Add one third 
of 
your 
front 
to your 
flank, 
this 
is 
the 
diagonal: 
The front 
3 times 
20 is 
1; 1 plus 
4 is 
5; 
5 is 
the 
diagonal. 
The meaning 
of this 
"problem" 
is 
more or 
less 
clear 
[Gandz 
1938, 
4561. 
The author 
wished 
to 
remind 
his 
readers 
that 
in any tri- 
angle 
which 
is 
a multiple 
of 
the 
basic 
(1 , 45, 
1 15) 
triangle, 
the 
diagonal 
is 
related 
to the 
front 
and the 
flank 
of 
the 
tri- 
angle 
through 
one of the 
two 
equations, 
c = b + a/2, 
and 
c 
= 
a 
+ b/3. 
(6.2) 
In other 
words, 
for 
multiples 
of 
that 
basic 
triangle 
one can set 
UPI say1 
cane-against-a-wall 
problems 
in which 
one of 
the 
two 
parameters 
is 
either 
t = (c - b)/a 
= l/2 
or 
(c - 
a) /b = l/3. 
(The same combined 
problem 
text 
contains 
also 
many other 
problems 
concerned 
with 
Pythagorean 
triangles, 
in particular, 
the 
cane- 
against-a-wall 
problem 
BM 34568:12.) 
It 
is 
tempting 
to hypoth- 
esize 
that 
the 
problem 
BM 34568:l 
contains 
a hint 
about 
how the 
first 
"triangle 
parameter 
problem" 
may have 
been discovered 
by 
some Old Babylonian 
mathematician. 
For, 
suppose 
that 
it 
was 
his 
intention 
to pose 
a geometric 
problem, 
involving 
the 
(1 , 45 I 1 15) 
triangle, 
in which 
the 
object 
was 
to 
compute 
the 
lengths 
of, 
say, 
v, 
h, 
x, 
and y (see 
Figure 
6.lb) 
when 
the 
value 
of 
the 
parameter 
u was 
given. 
He would 
have 
easily 
found 
that 
v = c - u, h = bu 
(from 
the 
similarity 
theorem 
for 
right 
triangles, 
since 
in 
the 
actual 
case 
a 
= 1, hence 
5 = b/a 
= b), 
y = 1 - UC (from 
the 
area 
formula, 
which 
can be used 
to 
show 
that 
2A = b = by + but), 
and, 
finally, 
x = 1 - y = UC. 
In 
particular, 
he would 
have 
found, 
in the 
simple 
special 
case 
when 
u = k = 30, 
that 
v=c 
- 4 = 45 = b, 
h = &b = 22 30, 
y = 1 - +c = 22 30 = h, 
x = $c = 37 30. 
In other 
words, 
he would 
have 
been led 
"by accident" 
to 
consider 
relations 
such 
as c = b f a/2, 
etc., 
for 
the 
(1 , 45 , 1 15) 
triangle, 
and it 
would 
not 
have 
been a big 
step 
for 
him to dis- 

HM8

322 and Pythagorean 
Triples 
315 
cover 
that 
there 
are 
other 
right 
triangles 
for 
which 
similar 
re- 
lations 
hold. 
Although 
it 
seems 
to me to be very 
likely 
that 
it 
was 
through 
such 
geometric 
and numerical 
experimentation 
that 
formulas 
like 
(2.2) 
for 
the 
generation 
of 
Pythagorean 
triangles 
and perhaps 
also 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
itself 
were 
first 
dis- 
covered, 
I will 
refrain 
from 
going 
into 
a more detailed 
discus- 
sion 
of 
the 
matter 
here.
