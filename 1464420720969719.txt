Identification of cracks in an
Euler–Bernoulli beam using
Bayesian inference and closed-form
solution of vibration modes
Tianyu Wang1, Mohammad Noori2 and Wael A. Altabey1,3
Abstract
Over the past two decades, extensive research has been carried out in the field of structural health monitoring for
damage detection in structural systems. Some crack detection methods are based on the finite element model of a beam
and use vibration data are developed. These methods identify the crack by updating of the finite element model
according to the vibration data of structure. This paper proposes a novel method for crack detection in Euler–
Bernoulli beams based on the closed-form solution of mode shapes using Bayesian inference. The expression of vibration
modes is derived analytically with the crack parameters as unknown variables. Subsequently, the Bayesian inference is
used to obtain the probability density function of crack parameters and to evaluate the uncertainty of the modes. Finally,
the method is applied to a series of numerical examples, including a beam with a single-crack and multi-cracks, to verify
the effectiveness of this method.

Introduction
With an ever-increasing pace of urban development
and increasing demand on existing civil and mechani-
cal structures, the aging, degradation, damage, safety,
and sustainability of structures have become important
ﬁelds of research over the past two decades.1–4 For
most damage and deterioration of structural compo-
nents, especially in steel and concrete structures, the
development of cracks is a safety concern. Hence,
early detection of location and the intensity of this
common type of damage is an important problem.
Subsequently, a large number of methods for crack
parameter identiﬁcation in structures have been pro-
posed by researchers to monitor the presence and
potential growth of cracks.5–14 Given that vibration
analysis is a common approach for the performance
assessment of structures, fundamental dynamic char-
acteristics, such as mode shapes and natural frequen-
cies of a structure, are viable metrics for assessing the
deterioration of a structure and numerous detection
techniques have been introduced that are based on
these inherent dynamic characteristics.15–22
The model updating methods (MUM), which is an
approach for evaluating the changes in the dynamic
characteristics, is one of these widely used vibration-
based damage identiﬁcation methods. The fundamen-
tal concept in MUM is based on establishing an
objective function. This tool or the key concept is
usually deﬁned by comparing the experimentally mea-
sured data and the data from a ﬁnite element (FE)
model of the structure.23–29 However, in practical
applications, the accuracy of the FE model depends
on how closely the model can represent the inherent
physical
characteristics
of
the
original
system.
Increasing accuracy requires considering a large
number of elements or degrees of freedom. The
higher the number of degrees of freedom is, the
more
accurate
the
identiﬁcation
result
will
be.
However, in general, for crack identiﬁcation, it is
not practical to ﬁnd the exact location by FE model

updating, since it requires an exhaustively large
number of elements, which results in high computa-
tional cost. Hence, an analytical solution that can
identify the exact location of cracks can be a novel
approach, especially for cases where an analytical
solution can be developed.
Real structures are more complex in research;
therefore, we can start the damage identiﬁcation
research from a structural member. As an important
structural member, beams have been studied for sev-
eral decades. A large number of fundamental studies
on beam analysis have been reported in the literature
including in classical literature, and for practical
applications such as the analysis of steel structures,
concrete structures30–32 nanomaterials,32–39 and func-
tionally graded materials,40 to cite a few examples. In
all these applications, an in-depth understanding of
the mechanics of beam analysis plays an important
role. A series of theoretical and analytical methods
have been developed to describe the static and
dynamic deformation of beams, such as Euler–
Bernoulli,
Timoshenko,
and
Reddy
beam
theo-
ries.41–45 Cracks in a beam are usually modeled as
massless rotational springs that connect the beam sec-
tions.46 Based on this commonly used model, the
closed-form solution is also given using generalized
functions.47,48 The analytical results of such models
agree closely with the ﬁnite element (FE) models and
experimental results. This shows that the aforemen-
tioned closed-form solution is suitable for the dynam-
ic analysis of a cracked beam.
It should also be pointed out that the identiﬁcation
of damage is not always accurate because of the envi-
ronmental effects and the contamination of the mea-
surement data due to noise. Therefore, a series of
uncertainty identiﬁcation methods have been devel-
oped to incorporate uncertainty due to such effects.
These methods can be divided into three types, the
model updating methods based on the stochastic
ﬁnite element method (SFEM),49,50 the Bayesian
model updating method,51–53 and methods based on
statistical
pattern
recognition.51–56
The
Bayesian
model updating using vibration mode data is one of
the most widely accepted approaches and has been
used
in
practical
engineering
applications.57,58
Besides, the Bayesian method has also been extensive-
ly applied in the inference of fatigue life and residual
stress
experimental
measurements.59–61 Combined
with damage detection results, the Bayesian method
can provide a comprehensive evaluation of structural
behavior.
In this paper, a closed-form solution of the vibra-
tion modes of a cracked beam, in conjunction with
the measured data for those modes, are used to obtain
the parameters of cracks. By using an analytical solu-
tion, the cracks are simulated to occur at any location
along the beam and not only at a nodal point, which
is the case in ﬁnite element analysis. Therefore, the
proposed method avoids the induced error due to
idealized ﬁnite element models and demonstrates a
better identiﬁcation result. Besides, the uncertainty
of identiﬁcation is also taken into consideration by
using Bayesian estimation. The identiﬁcation result
could be provided in the form of possibility dense
functions. The introduction of Bayesian inference
helps improve the accuracy of the identiﬁcation
method under noise and for determining the uncer-
tainty of identiﬁcation. The identiﬁcation results of
crack, with uncertainty included, could be used in
damage state evaluation and reliability computation.
Finally, this method is validated by a series of numer-
ical experiments for a beam with a different number
of cracks and different crack parameters, as well as a
comparison with the experimental results from other
papers. It should be pointed out that the closed-form
solution used in the proposed damage identiﬁcation
method is obtained by assuming the crack is open, so
only the linear vibration of the cracked beam is stud-
ied. This is a limitation of the proposed method.
Formulation for crack identification
Closed-form solution of Euler–Bernoulli cracked
beam vibration mode
As shown in Figure 1, an Euler–Bernoulli cracked beam
with N cracks located along the x coordinate axes at
locations x1; x2 ... ; xN is considered in this paper.
If we assume the crack gap is large, the opening
and closing of the crack (breathing effect) will not
happen in most small deformation case. The vibration
of a cracked beam can be considered to be a linear
vibration. Suppose that the cracks are equivalent to
massless springs connecting the sub-beams, the ﬂex-
ural stiffness of the beam can be expressed as a uni-
form

may also be useful in crack parameter identiﬁcation.
However, those are not considered in this paper.
The identiﬁcation method of crack parameters
consists of the following steps:
1. Estimate the possible number of cracks and obtain
the length of parameter vectors of dh and N.
2. Obtain the measurement data of vibration mode
and frequency with errors and obtain the likeli-
hood function deﬁned by equation (24).
3. Minimize the likelihood function using smart algo-
rithms and obtain the estimated crack parameter
values for the present measurement dh*and N* as
well as posterior PDF in equation (27).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the identiﬁcation result
converges to the ﬁnal value and obtain the PDF of
crack parameters.
Numerical examples
To demonstrate the feasibility of the method pro-
posed, three numerical examples are presented in
this section. The ﬁrst example compares the closed-
form solution with the ﬁnite element method to verify
the effectiveness of the closed-form solution in the
dynamic analysis of a cracked beam. The second
and third examples presuppose the parameters of
cracks and use a closed-form solution to simulate
the vibration mode and frequency of the cracked
beam. Then noise is added to the simulation data
and forms the measured data set. The measured
data are used to identify the cracks and ﬁnd the iden-
tiﬁcation result.
The free vibration simulation of cracked
Euler–Bernoulli beam: Closed-form solution
vs. finite element method
To verify the effectiveness of a closed-form solution in
dynamic
analysis,
a
simply-supported
aluminum
beam with one crack is presented and calculated
both analytically as well as using the FE model in
ABAQUS. The vibration mode is computed by
FEM and CFS, respectively. By comparing the two
solutions, the accuracy of CFS can be veriﬁed. The
length of cracked beam L is 235 mm; while the cross-
section is rectangular with a height of h ¼ 23 mm and
a width of b ¼ 7 mm. The material density q is
2800 kg=m3 and the elastic modulus E is 72 GPa.
Table 1 lists different crack parameters including
the crack depths and the coordinates considered in
this example.

Since fatigue and growth of crack are not considered,
the crack can be simulated by reducing the height of the
cross-section57,58 Therefore, the FE model of the cracked
beam can be built using the conventional 3D or 2D
elements. The FE model is generated by ABAQUS
using C3D8R element, while the crack is simulated by
an incision in the beam as it is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 3 shows the ﬁrst two order vibration
modes calculated by ABAQUS with n1 ¼ 0:25 and
d=h ¼ 0:3.
Table 2 and Figure 4 present the frequency and
mode shape values comparison of FEM and CFS.
Besides, the result from Faghidian et al.59 is also pre-
sented in Figure 4(a) to verify FEM and CFS. Since
the results of the three methods are very close, the
closed-form solution of cracked beam vibration is
considered to be reliable.
Crack identification for single-crack beam
As shown in Table 3, a series of Euler–Bernoulli beams
with only one crack are considered. These beams are of
different crack parameters and boundary conditions.
To test the effectiveness of the proposed method under
a noisy environment, the measurement data are simu-
lated with different errors given in the form of different
signal to noise ratios (SNR). For each cracked beam,
SNR of 10 dB, 20 dB, and 30 dB is simulated by CFS.
For each case considered, there are ﬁve measure-
ment points along the beam, while the ﬁrst three nat-
ural frequencies and vibration modes are measured.
The weights in equation (24) are supposed to be the
same and can be expressed as
wm ¼ w
m ¼ 1=6 m ¼ 1;2; 3

The model update number is nm ¼ 10. The model
update number denotes the number of independent
measurements of frequency and vibration mode we
use in the identiﬁcation.
The Standard PSO is used to solve the optimiza-
tion problem, while the number of particles is 100, the
maximum iterations are 200, the inertia weight is 0.5,

the learning factors c1 and c2 are 1.478, and the veloc-
ity of the particle is in the range of [0,1].
The results of both PP beam and CF presented
in Table 4 show the effectiveness and the effect of
different
boundary
conditions
and
measurement
errors. When the SNR is 30 dB or 20 dB, the iden-
tiﬁcation errors of the crack depth and the coordi-
nate for both PP beam and CF beam are almost
0.0%. That means the proposed method is accurate
for low measurement error situations. When the
SNR is 10 dB, the identiﬁcation errors of crack
depth are 4.00% and 3.75% for PP beam and CF
beam, while the errors of coordinates are 4.00%
and 2.00%. Such errors are acceptable for engineer-
ing applications.
Figures 5 and 6 show the PDFs for the identiﬁ-
cation of the crack’s coordinate and depth for PP
beam and CF beam, while Figures 7 and 8 give the
combination PDF of depth and coordinate when
the SNR ¼ 10 dB. As shown, the mean values of
PDFs
are
close
to
those
of
the
actual
crack
parameters. In general, the Bayesian estimation
errors are less than the data errors when the
errors follow the Gaussian distribution. Therefore,
the identiﬁcation method is reliable even in a noisy
measurement environment.
Crack identification for multi-crack beam
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method
for a multi-crack beam, a few multi-crack beam
examples (crack number n  3) are presented, sim-
ilar to the previous section. The measurement data
are simulated with different errors given in the form
of different signal to noise ratios (SNR). For each
cracked beam, SNR values of 10 dB, 20 dB, and 30
dB are simulated by CFS. Table 5 shows the
cracked
beams
with
different
crack
parameters.
For each case considered, there are ﬁve measure-
ment points along the beam, while the ﬁrst three
natural frequencies and vibration modes are mea-
sured. The weights are supposed to be as same as
equation
(30).

nm ¼ 10. PSO is used for function optimization.
The parameter selection of PSO is the same as
the identiﬁcation for a single crack.
Table 6 presents the identiﬁcation results for the
proposed test cases and simulation errors. For cases 1
and 2, with two and three cracks, the identiﬁcation
results are relatively accurate when SNR is 30 dB and
20 dB. However, when SNR is 10 dB, the errors exist
in both depth and coordinate identiﬁcation.
Since there are fewer parameters to be optimized
for the identiﬁcation of a two-crack beam, the
errors are smaller than the three-crack beam case.
Besides, overall the identiﬁcation of coordinate is
more accurate than depth identiﬁcation. One possi-
ble reason is that the variation of the crack depth
may have more inﬂuence on the vibration mode
and frequency than the variation of the crack
coordinate.
Figures 9, 10, 13, and 14 show the PDFs for the
identiﬁcations of each crack’s depth and coordinate in
case 1 and case 2.
The combination PDFs of crack and coordinate
are shown in Figures 11, 12,
15, and 16. We can
obtain the approximate values and the uncertainty
of
identiﬁcation
from
the
mean
and
variance
of PDF. In the examples shown in this section, the
graphs of identiﬁcation results are narrow and the
mean values are close to the actual values. That
means the method is feasible for a beam with two
or three cracks. For a beam with more cracks, the
effectiveness of this method needs to be veriﬁed.
Crack identification from vibration response
In engineering practice, the vibration response is the
most commonly used data to identify the crack. As
Figures 17 and 18 show, a simply-supported cracked
beam under white noise is simulated to obtain the
vibration response data. The modal superposition
method is used to process the response data for
modal identiﬁcation. In this example, the beam has
a rectangular cross-section with 0.1 m width and
0.25 m height. The material properties are listed as
follows: the Young modulus is 206 GPa and the den-
sity is 7900 kg/m3. The crack is located in the coordi-
nate of 0.3 with a depth of 0.5.

The raw acceleration data at the coordinate of n ¼
0:5 are shown in Figure 17. Noises with different SNR
(10 dB, 20 dB, and 30 dB) are added to the response
data. Then, the random subspace method is used to
calculate the ﬁrst three vibration modes and frequen-
cies. Based on the modes and frequency data, the
proposed method is used to detect the crack. The
identiﬁcation result is presented in Table 7 and the
posterior PDFs when SNR ¼ 10 dB are shown in
Figures 19 and 20. The accuracy of the identiﬁcation
using response data is lower than that obtained by
directly using the modal data. The error from the
system identiﬁcation method could be an important
reason. As can be concluded from the identiﬁcation
result, the proposed method could be extended to be
used in crack detection using random vibration data.
Experimental data verification
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method,
we compare our numerical results with experimental
data reported in the literature. In Unger et al.68 work,
a bending experiment of a simply supported pre-
stressed beam is presented. The length of the beam
is 17.6 m. The static concentrated load is applied in
six steps (22.5, 33.75, 62.5, 70, 75, and 77 kN) at the
coordinates of 2.12 m, 6.44 m, 11.19 m, and 15.51 m.
We choose the data in the step of 70 kN when the
cracks existed but the yielding of reinforcement had
not started. The obtained vibration mode data are
shown in Figure 21.
The ﬁrst three natural frequencies found by Unger
et al.68 are 8.4 Hz, 26.7 Hz, and 53.0 Hz, and the ﬁrst
three natural frequencies of the undamaged beam are
10.3 Hz, 29.5 Hz, and 57.7 Hz. The equivalent bend-
ing stiffness can be obtained by

extent in the beam. The parameters of the algo-
rithm are the same as in the numerical examples.
The result of identiﬁcation and the results by Unger
et al.68 are presented in Figure 22. By comparing
the two, we can ﬁnd that the identiﬁcation results
in this paper can partly present the damage condi-
tion
of
the
cracked
concrete
beam.
We
must
point out, however, that the vertical coordinate in
Figure 22 is not the actual depth of the crack but
can be considered as an index of damage or the
extent of the damage. It is because cracks appear
intensively in concrete structures. Hence, the local
stiffness degradation is caused by a group of cracks.
A single crack sometimes contributes little to the
stiffness degradation. The nominal crack depth is
an index that considers the effects of the proximity

of cracks in the degradation of local stiffness since
we cannot detect all the cracks in the beam if the
cracks are densely disturbed. In other words, it can
qualitatively, and not quantitatively, represent the
position of crack occurrence.
Conclusions
A new approach for crack identiﬁcation in an Euler–
Bernoulli beam based on close form solution of vibra-
tion modes is proposed by using Bayesian inference.
The crack parameters (depth and coordinate) are used
as unknown variables to derive the close form solu-
tion of the vibration modes. Based on the closed-form
solution, an intelligent algorithm and Bayesian infer-
ence are used to obtain the density function of crack
parameters and to evaluate the uncertainty.
Three numerical examples are presented for crack
detection with a different number of cracks. Example
one shown in ‘The free vibration simulation of
cracked Euler–Bernoulli beam: Closed-form solution
vs. ﬁnite element method’ section veriﬁes the reliabil-
ity of the closed-form solution by comparing the
vibration
modes
and
frequencies
calculated
by
closed-form solution and ﬁnite element method.
Other examples for a beam with a single and multiple
cracks also verify the effectiveness of the proposed
identiﬁcation method. Based on the results presented
in the paper, the following conclusions can be drawn:
1. The proposed method performs well for both
single and multiple crack cases. It has reliable
and acceptable robustness and can obtain the
uncertainty of parameter identiﬁcation.
2. In the case of a multi-crack beam, the proposed
method is more accurate for the identiﬁcation
of
the
crack
coordinate
than
the
depth.
Meanwhile, the errors and uncertainty increase
by increasing the number of cracks. For multi-
crack identiﬁcation, we can improve accuracy in
two ways. First, a more efﬁcient global optimiza-
tion algorithm needs to be found and used in func-
tion optimization of equation (29). Besides, some
prior knowledge about crack can be introduced to
Bayesian
inference
as
a
prior
probability
distribution.

3. The identiﬁcation method discussed in this paper
can be used for the damage identiﬁcation in a
beam. The identiﬁcation result, however, can
only
partially
and
qualitatively
predict
the
damage in structures. If we need to quantify the
identiﬁcation result, we need to have further
research on the mechanism of cracking and build
the
relation
of
crack
depth
and
stiffness
degradation.
