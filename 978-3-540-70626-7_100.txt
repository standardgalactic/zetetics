Invariance
K. Mainzer
Invariance, in general, means that quantities or objects do not change with respect to
transformations [7]. Invariance of quantities and objects can be distinguished from
 covariance which refers to form invariance of laws and equations [8]. In mathe-
matics, a function of coordinates is called invariant with respect to a transformation

T , if the function remains unchanged by application of T to the coordinates. In ge-
ometry, for example, lengths and angles are invariants with respect to orthogonal
transformations of Cartesian coordinates. Double proportions are invariants of pro-
jective transformations. In physics, basic quantities like energy, linear momentum,
or angular momentum are invariants, because their conservation results from the
 symmetry properties of the interactions under global space and time continuous
transformations.
Examples of continuous transformations are the translation in space, the rotation
around a given axis, and the translation in time. For a particle of mass m moving in
a one-dimensional space, its classical motion is governed by Newton’s equation
m¨x = F.
If the interaction force F derives from an energy potential U(x), that is F = −dU
dx ,
and if the potential is constant, i.e. independent of x, then m¨x = 0. Integration gives
m˙x = C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the invariance of U(x) under the space
translation
Ta : x′ →x = x + a
leads to the conservation of the linear momentum m˙x. The parameter a can take any
real value, hence Ta is a continuous transformation. In a similar way, one can show
that the invariance of a potential under continuous rotations in space leads to the con-
servation of the angular momentum and the invariance under translation in time
leads to the principle of energy conservation. These crucial connections between the
symmetries of a system and the conservation laws are the consequences of a gen-
eral theorem, Emmy Noether’s theorem: If a Lagrangian theory is invariant under
a N-parameter continuous transformation (in the sense that the Lagrangian func-
tion is invariant) then the theory possesses N conserved quantities [1]. Noether’s
theorem is not only true in classical and relativistic physics [9]. According to the
 correspondence principle, it also holds in quantum physics.
Historically, Noether’s theorem from 1918 did not come immediately into
the view of quantum physicists. The reason is that early quantum mechanics
emphasized the Hamiltonian frame work in mechanics and the new formulation of
symmetries being associated with unitary or antiunitary representations of groups
in the Hilbert spaces of states ( symmetry). All three classical text books on
group theory and quantum mechanics, namely those by Hermann Weyl (1928) [2],
Eugene Paul Wigner (1931) [3], and Bartel Laendert van der Waerden (1932) [4]
did not deal with Lagrangian equations of action integrals and their invariance
properties. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics the fundamental  observables
are position operators QA and momentum operators PA. The Hamilton  operator
H = H(QA, PA, t) depends on them. Time t is only a parameter. ( Time in
quantum mechanics). The Lagrangian framework was rediscovered with the rise
of  quantum ﬁeld theory and elementary  particle physics. For the thirties of
the last century there is only a paper of Moisei A. Markov [5] which explicitly
and systematically applied Noether’s theorem to the currents of a Dirac particle in
an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. After some textbooks on classical ﬁeld theory

quoting Noether’s paper the breakthrough came with Edward L. Hill’s exposition
of Noether’s results in 1951 [6] which was quoted in textbooks on quantized ﬁelds
in the ﬁfties of the last century.
In general, quantum ﬁeld theory refers to independent ﬁeld operators uA(xi)
(A = 1, 2, . . .) as fundamental quantities of the theory. The Galilean coordinates
xi are parameters. There is a formal correspondence

QA (t) →uA

The coordinates xμ describe the continuum of the space of position. Therefore,
quantum ﬁeld theory can be considered a quantum mechanical system with non-
countably-inﬁnite many degrees of freedom. In the Lagrangian theory of ﬁelds the
operator of Lagrangian density plays a central role. It has the same external form like
the classical Lagrange density. A classical Lagrange density function can be differ-
entiated in the usual way with respect to ﬁeld functions and their derivatives. The
derivation of an operator with respect to operators is in general problematic because
of the non-commutativity of the operators. But with appropriate rules of partial dif-
ferentiation, the results of Noether’s theorem can be transferred to quantum ﬁeld
theory [10].
