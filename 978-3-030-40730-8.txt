The Emergence, Complexity and Computation (ECC) series publishes new
developments, advancements and selected topics in the ﬁelds of complexity,
computation and emergence. The series focuses on all aspects of reality-based
computation approaches from an interdisciplinary point of view especially from
applied sciences, biology, physics, or chemistry. It presents new ideas and
interdisciplinary insight on the mutual intersection of subareas of computation,
complexity and emergence and its impact and limits to any computing based on
physical limits (thermodynamic and quantum limits, Bremermann’s limit, Seth
Lloyd limits…) as well as algorithmic limits (Gödel’s proof and its impact on
calculation, algorithmic complexity, the Chaitin’s Omega number and Kolmogorov
complexity, non-traditional calculations like Turing machine process and its
consequences,…) and limitations arising in artiﬁcial intelligence. The topics are
(but not limited to) membrane computing, DNA computing, immune computing,
quantum computing, swarm computing, analogic computing, chaos computing and
computing on the edge of chaos, computational aspects of dynamics of complex
systems (systems with self-organization, multiagent systems, cellular automata,
artiﬁcial life,…), emergence of complex systems and its computational aspects, and
agent based computation. The main aim of this series is to discuss the above
mentioned topics from an interdisciplinary point of view and present new ideas
coming from mutual intersection of classical as well as modern methods of
computation. Within the scope of the series are monographs, lecture notes, selected
contributions from specialized conferences and workshops, special contribution
from international experts.

Preface
As a computer scientist who has spent nearly thirty years drawing upon the natural
world for inspiration to make machines do useful things, my research with evolution
has been somewhat separated from squishy biology. Instead of DNA, I have used
evolution with data and/or instructions for computers to design such things as models
of Olympic athletes, arrays of interacting wind turbines, nanoparticles for cancer
tumour treatment, computers made from chemical reactions, etc. That is, evolution as
a powerful search tool by which to negotiate complexity. Alongside that work, I have
always turned such abstracted evolution back onto the natural phenomena to help
gain insight of the underlying dynamics and emergence/beneﬁts of each. This book
brings together much of that work—both old and new—to explore a number of the
key increases in complexity seen in the natural world. Whilst any increase in com-
plexity has certainly not been inevitable, they have occurred and this book seeks to
explain each of them purely in terms of the features of ﬁtness landscapes.
I have been fortunate enough to discuss this work with so many people over the
many years that to attempt to name them all here would be folly. But I would like to
thank the Editors for publishing me in their series.

Introduction
Complexity is hard to deﬁne or to measure, but there is surely some sense in which elephants
andoaktreesaremorecomplexthanbacteria,andbacteriathantheﬁrstreplicatingmolecules.
[7, p. 3]
Life on earth emerged around 4 billion years ago and its complexity has been increas-
ingeversince.Thisbookseekstoexploretheconditionsunderwhichnaturalselection
[3] would favour some of the key mechanisms by which those increases in complex-
ity have come about, using simple models of evolution on abstract ﬁtness landscapes.
Wright [11] was perhaps the ﬁrst to view natural evolution as a process of adaptation
through a multidimensional space of ﬁtness peaks and troughs (Fig. 1.1, top). Turing
[10] would later highlight the potential universality of that view when considering
ways to design intelligent computers: evolution as a general search process. Whilst
no simple correlation between the amount of DNA in a given organism and its per-
ceived complexity exists—lilies have more DNA than humans, for example—it is
clear that the two are interrelated. Five ways in which an increase in the amount of
DNA may occur are explored here.
1.1
Evolutionary Innovations
The following sources of evolutionary innovation are considered:
Genomes
Once formed, increases in the amount of raw material available
to evolution in the genome is one way through which new func-
tionalities may emerge, potentially resulting in a novel protein or
new regulatory control.
Symbiosis
The bringing together of closely interacting organisms such that a
new level of functionality is realised by one or more of the partners
is ubiquitous and was key to the evolution of eukaryotes around
1.8 billion years ago.

Introduction
Fig. 1.1 Showing how the shape of a ﬁtness landscape can be altered through a simple learning
process. An evolving population at points C-E is unlikely to move to point A due to the deep ﬁtness
valley B (top). However, if an individual(s) at point B is able to learn, e.g., to the point C, the
effective ﬁtness of the valley can be increased and hence the probability of the population reaching
point A is increased (bottom)
Sex
Sex involves the bringing together of two or more genomes of the
same type to form a more complex cell/organism in comparison to
bacteria: syngamy and meiosis under a haploid-diploid lifecycle
underpins the evolution of eukaryotes.
Chromosomes
Eukaryotes have their genomes arranged in distinct units and the
varyingoftheirnumberisanotherprimarymechanismforincreas-
ing complexity, where functional divergence may subsequently
follow.
Multicellularity Organisms consisting of two or more copies of their basic repro-
ducing unit opened a signiﬁcant route to varying complexity
around 1.5 billion years ago. Indeed, multicellularity appears to
have emerged multiple times. Moreover, eusocial insect colonies

can be seen to share characteristics with multicellular organisms
which is also considered here.
It can be noted that three of these innovations are also so-called major transitions
in evolution wherein independent replicators form new higher level units that can
only replicate together thereafter: symbiosis, sex and multicellularity [7] (although,
sex is disqualiﬁed in [9]). Another process is highlighted as being fundamental to
two of those transitions, namely sex and multicellularity—the Baldwin effect [1, 6,
8].
1.2
The Baldwin Effect
The Baldwin effect is here deﬁned as the existence of phenotypic plasticity that
enables an organism to exhibit a different (better) ﬁtness than its genome directly
represents. Over time, as evolution is guided towards such regions under selection,
higher ﬁtness alleles/genomes which rely less upon the phenotypic plasticity can be
discovered and become assimilated into the population.
Hinton and Nowlan [5] were the ﬁrst to investigate the Baldwin effect, showing
that enabling genetically speciﬁed artiﬁcial neural networks to alter inter-neuron
connections randomly during their lifetime meant a simulated evolutionary process
was able to ﬁnd an isolated optimum in the ﬁtness landscape, something the system
without learning struggled to achieve. That is, the ability to learn “smoothed” the
ﬁtness landscape into a unimodal hill/peak. They also found that over time more
and more correct connections became genetically speciﬁed and hence less and less
random learning was necessary; the evolutionary process was guided toward the
optimum by the learning process. Their ﬁnding was generalized in [2] where it was
shown how the most beneﬁcial frequency and amount of learning varies with the
ruggedness of the underlying ﬁtness landscape.
Figure 1.1 (bottom) shows a simple example of how this process of moving from
the genetically speciﬁed position in the landscape can be beneﬁcial by enabling the
smoothing of ﬁtness valleys, thereby decreasing the tendency for a population to
become trapped on local optima. Learning—phenotypic plasticity—can be achieved
in many ways. Alongside neural processing, the Baldwin effect has been connected
to other aspects of organisms, such as the immune system [4]. It is suggested here
that the bringing together of two or more replicators of a given type into a single
organism/entity can be viewed as a rudimentary form of learning, assuming the
resulting ﬁtness is a composite, e.g., the numerical average of the partners. For
example, in Fig. 1.1, if an individual at point B was combined with an individual
at point D, the ﬁtness valley would be greatly diminished since the resulting ﬁtness
of (B + D)/2 would be roughly equal to that at point C. Note this may cause the
apparent ﬁtness of point D to drop signiﬁcantly, e.g., if no other purely D individuals
exist.
The rest of this book explores the ﬁve sources of innovation identiﬁed.

Chapter 2
Genomes
Genome length is one of the degrees of freedom exploited by evolution in the vari-
ation of organism complexity and this can be seen to have increased over time in
some lineages. Metazoan morphological complexity is known to be correlated with
genome length, for example [3]. This chapter explores the effects of ﬁtness landscape
ruggedness upon the evolution of genome length in asexual haploid organisms. Hence
cells/organisms with genomes of linked DNA are assumed to have already emerged
(e.g., see [8]).
Novel sequences of DNA can originate through a variety of mechanisms includ-
ing retrotransposons, horizontal gene transfers, during recombination events, whole
genome duplications, etc. A novel sequence may have no immediate function and
be subsequently lost/selected due to a deleterious/beneﬁcial mutation (e.g., see [9]),
may beneﬁcially/detrimentally alter dosage (e.g., see [10]), enable the subsequent
specialisation of a duplicated function (e.g., see [5]), etc. In this chapter the process
of novel DNA sequence creation is simpliﬁed such that a given number of random
genes are added to an existing genome and immediately assigned random contri-
butions to the organism’s ﬁtness function. This is explored within the well-known
NK model [7] of ﬁtness landscapes where size and ruggedness can be systematically
altered. Results suggest that landscape ruggedness, the length of the new sequence
with respect to that of the original genome, the presence of gene deletion, and the
existence and type of non-stationarity in the ﬁtness landscape can all affect the evo-
lution of genome length. Signiﬁcantly, increases in genome length are seen across
the parameter space of the model.
2.1
The NK Model: Asexual Haploid Evolution
Kauffman and Levin [7] introduced the NK model to allow the systematic study
of various aspects of ﬁtness landscapes (see [6] for an overview). In the standard
model, the features of the ﬁtness landscapes are speciﬁed by two parameters: N, the

Genomes
length of the genome; and K, the number of genes that has an effect on the ﬁtness
contribution of each (binary) gene. Thus increasing K with respect to N increases
the epistatic linkage, increasing the ruggedness of the ﬁtness landscape. The increase
in epistasis increases the number of optima, increases the steepness of their sides,
and decreases their correlation. The model assumes all intragenome interactions are
so complex that it is only appropriate to assign random values to their effects on
ﬁtness. Therefore for each of the possible K interactions a table of 2(K+1) ﬁtnesses
is created for each gene with all entries in the range 0.0–1.0, such that there is one
ﬁtness for each combination of traits (Fig. 2.1). The ﬁtness contribution of each gene
is found from its table. These ﬁtnesses are then summed and normalized by N to
give the selective ﬁtness of the total genome. Thus, whilst simple, the NK model
can be seen to capture the fundamental characteristics of genomes and hence it is
used throughout this book. However, it is relatively easy to extend the basic model to
explore aspects of regulatory control in more detail, an example of which is included
as an Appendix to demonstrate.
Kauffman [6] used a mutation-based hill-climbing algorithm, where the single
point in the ﬁtness space is said to represent a converged species, to examine the
properties and evolutionary dynamics of the NK model. That is, the population is of
size one and a species evolves by making a random change to one randomly chosen
gene per generation. The “population” is said to move to the genetic conﬁguration of
the mutated individual if its ﬁtness is greater than the ﬁtness of the current individual;
the rate of supply of mutants is seen as slow compared to the actions of selection.
Ties are broken at random. Figure 2.2 shows example results. All results reported
in this chapter are the average of 10 runs (random start points) on each of 10 NK
functions, i.e., 100 runs, for 20,000 generations. Here 0 ≤K ≤15, for N = 20 and
N = 100.
Figure 2.2 shows examples of the general properties of adaptation on such rugged
ﬁtness landscapes identiﬁed by Kauffman (e.g., [6]), including a “complexity catas-
trophe” as K →N. When K = 0 all genes make an independent contribution to
the overall ﬁtness and, since ﬁtness values are drawn at random between 0.0 and
1.0, order statistics show the average value of the ﬁt allele should be 0.66. Hence a
Fig. 2.1 An example NK model (N = 3, K = 1) showing how the ﬁtness contribution of each gene
depends on K random genes (left). Therefore there are 2(K+1) possible allele combinations per gene,
each of which is assigned a random ﬁtness. Each gene of the genome has such a table created for
it (right, centre gene shown). Total ﬁtness is the normalized sum of these values

of varying ruggedness (K) and length (N). Error bars show min and max values
single, global optimum exists in the landscape of ﬁtness 0.66, regardless of the value
of N. At low levels of K (0 < K < 8), the landscape buckles up and becomes more
rugged, with an increasing number of peaks at higher ﬁtness levels, regardless of N.
Thereafter the increasing complexity of constraints between genes means the height
of peaks typically found begin to fall as K increases relative to N: for large N, the
central limit theorem suggests reachable optima will have a mean ﬁtness of 0.5 as K
→N. Figure 2.2 shows how the optima found when K > 6 are signiﬁcantly lower
for N = 20 compared to those for N = 100 (T-test, p < 0.05).
2.2
Genome Growth in the NK Model
To enable the length of genomes in the NK model to vary under evolution, i.e., to
vary to N′, mutation is here expanded such that either a randomly chosen gene allele
is altered as before or a number (G) of randomly created genes are added to the
right-hand end of the existing genome. In the latter case, the ﬁrst connection of a
randomly chosen gene in the existing genome is assigned to each newly added gene
(when K ≥1). The new genes have K randomly assigned connections into the whole

Genomes
genome, as before. In this way the new genes both affect and are affected by the
existing genes.
Figure 2.3 shows results from the simplest case of G = 1. With a starting length
of N = 20, the ﬁtness reached increases for K > 10 compared to the traditional case
of G = 0 above (T-test, p < 0.05). This is because the genomes typically increase
in length by around 3 genes for all K, i.e., N′ ≈23, which is sufﬁcient to avert the
onset of the complexity catastrophe at the highest K. There is a lot of variance in
the genome lengths which emerge but slightly less growth is seen on average for K
< 4. When N = 100 no signiﬁcant change in ﬁtness is seen for all K compared to
G = 0 (T-test, p ≥0.05) but the typical amount of growth seen increases with K,
where twice or more growth is seen for K > 4 compared to the equivalent case with
N = 20.
As noted above, varying the degree of ruggedness varies the typical height and
number of optima in a landscape. The more peaks of low ﬁtness there are, the longer
into the evolutionary search it is likely that a randomly added gene can make a
beneﬁcial contribution to ﬁtness. Conversely, evolution can be anticipated to move
through a series of relatively high ﬁtness levels on correlated ﬁtness landscapes in all
but the earliest stages since fewer, higher peaks exist in the global space. Figure 2.4

Fig. 2.4 Showing mean walk length to an optimum for a given N and K, G = 1. Error bars not
shown for clarity
without growth. It also shows the generation at which genome lengths stop changing.
As can be seen, for all K, the addition of the genome length varying process means
evolution continues for longer before ﬁnding an optimum—the dimensionality of
the ﬁtness landscape has increased. Moreover, it can also be seen that genome length
stops increasing earlier for low K, continuing into the later stages of evolution as
K →N. Figure 2.5 shows the generation at which the ﬁrst few new genes are typically
accepted into the genome for various K. As can be seen, the waiting time does not
vary signiﬁcantly with K, i.e., landscape ruggedness, for the ﬁrst two genes but begins
to vary thereafter.
Figure 2.6 shows the effect of increasing the size of the novel random sequence
added, with G = 20. When N = 20, ﬁtness is greater than with G = 1 when
K > 4 (T-test, p < 0.05) as the complexity catastrophe is further averted due to the
signiﬁcant increase in genome length for all K. When N = 100, the ﬁtness reached
is the same as when G = 1 for all K with signiﬁcantly longer genomes emerging.

ruggedness (K) where the initial length (N) can increase by twenty genes under mutation
Figures 2.7 and 2.8 show the underlying dynamics of the evolutionary process
in each case. As can be seen, the increased amount of growth per addition means
evolution continues for much longer than with G = 1 (Fig. 2.4), particularly when
N = 20. The general dynamics are not signiﬁcantly different when N = 100 but the
relative increase in size of G with respect to N when N = 20 is seemingly more
disruptive. Figure 2.8 shows how the ﬁrst novel sequences are accepted at a similar

generation as when G = 1, regardless of N and K. The second sequence is accepted
at a similar stage when N = 100 but at later stages for N = 20, if at all. That is, the
larger amount of growth per addition event can potentially maintain the conditions
for more subsequent growth for longer; each increase in the dimensionality of a
ﬁtness landscape supplies a number of sub-optimal gene values, thereby maintaining
sub-optimal ﬁtness levels which in turn may aid the likelihood of a new random
sequence being accepted.
Using a similarly extended version of the NK model, and N = 16, K = 2
(only), Harvey [4] showed that gradual growth through small increases in genome
length were sustainable whereas larger increases per growth event were not. This is
explained as being due to the fact that a degree of correlation between the smaller
ﬁtness landscape and the larger one must be maintained; a ﬁt solution in the former
space must achieve a suitable level of ﬁtness in the latter to survive into succeeding
generations. Kauffman and Levin [7] discussed this general concept with respect
to ﬁxed-size NK landscapes and varying mutation step sizes therein. They showed
how for long jump adaptations, i.e., mutation steps of a size which go beyond the
correlation length of a given ﬁtness landscape, the time taken to ﬁnd ﬁtter variants
doubles per generation. Harvey [4] draws a direct analogy between the size of the
novel sequence being added (G) and the length of a jump in a traditional landscape;
the larger G, the less correlated the two landscapes. He similarly points out that
growth is more likely early in evolution before optima are climbed and it is after
that the degree of correlation begins to take more effect. It is here suggested that
his larger G did not prove successful primarily due to a change in the standard NK
ﬁtness function used to include length, and hence change in the selection pressure,
which reduced the size of the window of opportunity for larger increases in length to
emerge; results here show larger G increases of genome length are sustainable, for all
K, i.e., regardless of the underlying correlation of the landscape. However, it can be
seen in Fig. 2.8 that when N = 20 a second successful adoption of a novel sequence
does not typically emerge when 4 < K < 10 and a third adoption is rare (contrast with
G = 1 or N = 100 and G = 20). It may be that the degree of correlation between

12

Genomes
the original and new space is playing a role, although growth occurs for K = 2 and
K = 4. It might be expected, although not explored here, that since genome lengths
vary for almost as long as ﬁtness levels when a larger G is used, smaller amounts of
growth would be accepted more readily during this time. That is, occasional large
changes interspersed with many smaller changes, i.e., a dynamic value for G, would
provide even more growth.
A common outcome for an added novel sequence is removal, through mutational
inactivation, fractionation after whole genome duplications, etc. Figure 2.9 shows
example results from adding a process of deletion to balance that of growth described
above. That is, an offspring can experience a gene allele mutation or genome length
mutation with equal probability, as before. However, in the latter case, there is an
equal probability that the last G genes added are removed as for G new genes to be
added. Fitness is unaffected for all N and K (not shown) but there is less growth for
K > 0. The same was also the case for G = 20 (not shown).
Given the reduction, the sensitivity of the growth process to the relative rate of
deletion to addition has also been explored. Figure 2.10 shows examples of the
evolved lengths over the range of no deletion to an equal amount, with G = 1. As
can be seen, the rate of decline in genome length is roughly proportional to the rate
of increase in the probability of deletion.
It was noted above how the addition of new genes typically increases the walk
length to an optimum as the population ﬁnds its progress “reset” within the higher
dimension ﬁtness landscape; new routes to optima in a bigger space become available
on each novel sequence addition. Another source of such progress disruption is
a change in the ﬁtness landscape. That is, the movement of optima can also cause
current gene conﬁgurations to become sub-optimal, increasing the likelihood of novel
sequences being able to make a positive contribution to ﬁtness. Figure 2.11 shows
an example case of the effect on ﬁtness and genome length when the whole ﬁtness
landscape is randomly recreated for the given K, i.e., each of the entries in the lookup
table of each of the N′ genes is assigned a new random value in the range 0.0–1.0,
after 10,000 generations. As can be seen, there is a signiﬁcant drop in the ﬁtness

level at the point of change before it recovers to a similar level achieved before the
change. The effect on genome length is to cause a similar level of growth as from
the original length N before the change. Note this variation of the model contains an
equal probability of deletion as described above (Fig. 2.9). Growth in response to a
change(s) in the ﬁtness landscape has been described in similar models (e.g., [1, 2]).
Figure 2.12 shows the changes in length observed for various N and K com-
binations after 20,000 generations compared to the lengths evolved after 10,000
generations when the change occurs. Note ﬁtness levels return to around those seen
at the point of change in all cases (not shown). The top row shows results from ran-
domly recreating the whole ﬁtness landscape for various G. As can be seen, akin to
the example in Fig. 2.11, the effect on genome length is to cause an increase after the
change occurs. When N = 20 the typical response is to add around G genes, slightly
less on average for G = 100. When N = 100 the typical response is to add 2G or more
genes, less on average for G = 100. The bottom row shows results from randomly
recreating the ﬁtness landscape component of the newly added genes, i.e., the ﬁtness
tables of genes N to N′ only, at the point of change. When N = 20 genes are added in

change in the ﬁtness landscape is introduced and the length subsequently reached after 20,000
generations, for various G, K and N. The top row shows the case where the whole ﬁtness landscape
is randomly recreated at generation 10,000 and the bottom row the case where only the entries
beyond the initial N genes are randomly recreated
the response to the change, although less than G genes. In contrast, when N = 100,
the underlying trend of the response is to delete genes. The number of genes added
over the ﬁrst 10,000 generations subsequently removed over the next 10,000 gener-
ations typically declines with K. As noted above, the number of successful sequence
additions is typically higher when N = 100, regardless of G, and it therefore seems
it is more effective to remove some of them to regain a relatively high ﬁtness level.
It can be noted that without the probability of deletion, genes are added in all cases,
less for the smaller change case N′–N (not shown).
As noted in the introduction, it is here assumed that a single genome of linked
genes already exists. Clearly, after one or a few replicating molecules emerged and
linked, genomes began to grow in length at different rates in different lineages, up
to consisting of billions of nucleotide base pairs in eukaryotes. The ﬁnding that the
typical response to change in the ﬁtness landscape is one of genome growth suggests
an underlying mechanism for this rise in complexity. For example, Fig. 2.13 shows
the simple case of N = 1 and K = 0 that experiences a change in its whole ﬁtness
landscape every 1000 generations, with G = 1. A constant, steady increase in genome

length is seen. Note the slight drop in ﬁtness from those of the very low values of N is
due to variance in the relatively small sample of random numbers from the expected
optimum of 0.66 mentioned above.

Discussion
This chapter has considered the effects of ﬁtness landscape ruggedness on the evolu-
tion of genome length in haploid single-celled organisms under different conditions.
Using a simple, abstract model it has been shown that increases in genome length
due to the addition of randomly created novel sequences which have an immedi-
ate effect upon ﬁtness is the norm. That is, ﬁtness landscape ruggedness does not
hinder genome growth and can actually promote it as the window of opportunity
for a randomly created sequence to have a beneﬁcial—or at least neutral—effect on
ﬁtness increases due to the typical (low) height of peaks in such landscapes. It can
also enhance ﬁtness since it enables the avoidance of the complexity catastrophe for
higher levels of gene epistasis. Note no explicit functional beneﬁt from increased
genome length was included in the model and hence the growth seen was as a con-
sequence of the underlying dynamics of evolution on ﬁtness landscapes of varying
degrees of ruggedness only.

Symbiosis
Symbiosis represents evolution bringing together the genomes of different species
and it is well-established that the phenomenon has been of great signiﬁcance (e.g.,
see [11]). When the relationship between the symbionts evolves in the direction of
increasing dependency, “a new formation at the level of the organism arises—a com-
plex form having the attributes of an integrated morphophysiological entity” [9, p. 5].
This chapter explores the effects of ﬁtness landscape ruggedness and connectedness
upon the evolution of symbiotic organisms which live in close association.
Under the most intimate of symbiotic associations—endosymbiosis—one of the
partners, the host, incorporates the other(s) internally. Endosymbionts can occur
withinoroutsidetheirhost’scells.Extracellularendosymbiontscanbeeitherbetween
the cells of host tissue, or in an internal cavity, such as the gut. Intracellular endosym-
bionts are usually enclosed by a host membrane. This chapter begins by exploring the
conditions under which a general form of endosymbiotic relationship between two
and then three coevolving species proves beneﬁcial. This is done using Kauffman
and Johnsen’s [7] abstract NKCS model, which allows for the systematic alteration
of various aspects of a coevolving environment, including landscape ruggedness,
landscape connectedness, the degree of host control over the symbiont, and the rel-
ative rates of evolution of the partners. Increasing integration between the partners,
symbiogenesis, also delineates the transfer of genes from one symbiont’s genome to
another—horizontal gene transfer—creating a more complex genome for the recip-
ient. The evolutionary performance of endosymbionts who transfer increasing frac-
tions of their genome to their partner is also explored. Symbiogenesis is seen to be
beneﬁcial across the parameter space of the model.

3.1
The NKCS Model
Kauffman and Johnsen [7] extended the NK model (Sect. 2.1) and introduced the
abstract NKCS model to enable the study of various aspects of coevolution. At an
abstract level coevolution can be considered as the coupling together of the ﬁtness
landscapes of the interacting species. Hence the adaptive moves made by one species
in its ﬁtness landscape causes deformations in the ﬁtness landscapes of its coupled
partners. In their model, each gene is also said to depend upon C randomly chosen
traits in each of the other S species with which it interacts. The adaptive moves by
one species may deform the ﬁtness landscape(s) of its partner(s). Altering C, with
respect to N, changes how dramatically adaptive moves by each species deform the
landscape(s)ofitspartner(s).Again,foreachofthepossibleK +(S ×C)interactions,
a table of 2(K+(S×C)+1) ﬁtnesses is created for each gene, with all entries in the range
0.0–1.0, such that there is one ﬁtness for each combination of traits. Such tables are
created for each species (Fig. 3.1, the reader is referred to [6] for full details).
Figure 3.2 shows example results for one of two coevolving species where the
parameters of each are the same and hence behaviour is symmetrical. Again, as in
Chap. 2 with the NK model, a species is said to be converged and hence represented
by a single, asexual haploid genome. All results reported in this chapter are the
average of 10 runs (random start points) on each of 10 NKCS functions, i.e., 100
runs, for 20,000 generations. Here 0 ≤K ≤10, 1 ≤C ≤5, for N = 20 and N = 100.
When C = 1, Fig. 3.2 shows examples of the general properties of adaptation
on such ﬁtness landscapes identiﬁed by Kauffman (e.g., [6]) in the NK model, i.e.,
when C = 0, still hold, including the height of peaks typically found begins to fall
as K increases relative to N. Figure 3.2 further shows how increasing the degree of
connectedness (C) between the two landscapes causes ﬁtness levels to fall signiﬁ-
cantly (T-test, p < 0.05) when C ≥K for N = 20. That is, as K →N a high number
of peaks of similar height typically exist in each of the ﬁtness landscapes and so
the effects of switching between them under the inﬂuence of C is reduced since

suggested as signiﬁcant in [6] where N = 24 only was used throughout. However,

C (T-test, p < 0.05), regardless of K. That is, it might be concluded that more complex
organisms (>N) appear more sensitive to landscape coupling (>C).
As in [7], the models have also assumed that the two symbionts evolve at the same
rate; each species coevolves in turn in the standard NKCS model. Following [1, 3],
a new parameter R can be added to the model to represent the relative rate at which
the endosymbiont evolves—by undertaking R rounds of mutation and selection to

each round by the host. Figure 3.3 shows how with N = 100, generally, increasing
R increases the effects of C for a given K when C > 1 whilst R < 10. In contrast, no
notable effect is seen by increasing R for any K and C values tried when N = 20 (not
shown). It can be noted that N = 100 (only) was also used in [1] and N = 64 (only)
in [3].
3.2
Endosymbiosis in the NKCS Model
Endosymbiotic associations are often hereditary, wherein the host’s endosymbiont(s)
pass directly to its offspring. The mechanism for this perpetuation ranges from trans-
mission in the egg cytoplasm to offspring ingesting the endosymbiont(s) shortly after
birth, for example, when cows lick their calves thereby passing on their rumen cil-
iates. If symbiosis is viewed as organisms acquiring the properties of others, then
hereditary endosymbiotic relationships in particular may be perceived as the direct
inheritance of acquired characteristics, that is, as a Lamarckian-like process: “What
is an [endosymbiont], from a genetic point of view? A new cluster of genes!” [13].

3.2 Endosymbiosis in the NKCS Model
21
The above NKCS model can be modiﬁed slightly to capture an hereditary
endosymbiotic relationship between the two coevolving partners. Simply, the second
species can only accept a beneﬁcial mutation if it does not decrease the ﬁtness of
the ﬁrst (host) species, where ties are again broken at random. That is, the formation
of an endosymbiosis is seen as an example of slavery with the endosymbiont being
internalised purely for the beneﬁt of the host (after [12]). This point is returned to
later.
Figure 3.4 shows examples of the general result previously reported in [2] using
a similar version of the NKCS model but extended to larger N: hereditary endosym-
biosis proves beneﬁcial to the host for all K and C (T-test, p < 0.05). That is, all
inter-dependence (C) effectively becomes intra-dependence (K) and the host’s ﬁt-
ness landscape no longer changes due to the effects of its symbiotic partner but instead
becomes more rugged. This is particularly beneﬁcial for low K partners coupled by
high C due to the buckling-up effect from increasing K mentioned above.
There is some debate around whether (hereditary endosymbiotic) mitochondria
facilitated or were acquired through phagocytosis in the evolution of eukaryotes due
to its energetic cost (e.g., see [10]). If the capacity for phagocytosis is assumed to have
increased relative genome size in the pre-eukaryotic cell, the results here suggest that
the effects of its coevolutionary dependence upon the free-living mitochondria would
have been more keenly felt: the ﬁtness for a given K and C combination is typically
signiﬁcantly lower (T-test, p < 0.05) when N = 100 in comparison to N = 20 for C
> 1 (Fig. 3.2), and the relative beneﬁt of hereditary endosymbiosis is therefore larger
for N = 100 (Fig. 3.4). The emergence of a complex trait such as phagocytosis may
therefore have increased the chances of the uptake of mitochondria.
Having multiple, intimate symbiotic partners is not unusual: mealybugs contain
cellular bacteria that contain their own bacteria, eukaryotes can contain chloro-
plasts alongside mitochondria, etc. Figure 3.5 shows example behaviour for the host
with its hereditary endosymbiont described above, evolved in the context of another
free-living symbiont (left) and the case where that symbiont has become a second
hereditary endosymbiont (right), with N = 20. Following Burns’ [4] suggestion that
endosymbionts may typically no longer experience environmental factors directly,
the effects of the free-living symbiont are not applied to the endosymbiont and vice
versa here. As can be seen, in comparison to the equivalent case without the extra
coevolving symbiont (Fig. 3.4), there is no signiﬁcant change in the evolutionary
behaviour for the host for all K and C combinations, even with a moderate amount
of coupling (W = 3) to the extra symbiont. When N = 100, there is again a signiﬁ-
cant drop in ﬁtness for the host when K < 6 and all C with W = 3 (T-test, p < 0.05,
not shown). In all cases, the ﬁtness of the host is increased by forming a secondary
hereditary endosymbiosis with the symbiont (T-test, p < 0.05).
The reason for this change in behaviour with an increase in genome size is again
as described above for Fig. 3.2 since, with a combined length of 2N here the host
still exists on ﬁtness landscapes where the degree of ruggedness—caused by both its
own K and the C of its coupling to the endosymbiont—is high relative to N when N
= 20 (combined N = 40). Thus its landscapes are very similar: the effects of moving
from one to another due to evolutionary changes in its coupled partner are greatly

(K), coupling (C), and length (N) when one of the two coevolving species is seen to permanently
exist/evolve within the other, i.e., hereditary endosymbiosis
reduced as a similar height peak exists in close proximity in the new landscape as
to the peak in the previous landscape. This suggests multiple intimate symbioses are
more likely to emerge in host organisms evolving on more rugged ﬁtness landscapes
since they are less prone to suffering the effects of the prior coupling with their
partner before enslaving them. However, organisms with longer genomes experience
a greater improvement in ﬁtness from enslaving the symbiont. Note how the process
itself then places the host on a more rugged landscapes, etc.

environment/third species (right), i.e., plastid-like
The results are the same when the endosymbiont and free-living symbiont are
coupled by W (not shown), as expected from Fig. 3.2.
As mentioned above, and as in [2], the assumption thus far has been that the
endosymbiont’s evolutionary progress is completely under the inﬂuence of the host
in that no detrimental steps to its ﬁtness are allowed. This is based on the idea
that such relationships should be viewed as a form of enslavement by the host [12]
rather than mutually beneﬁcial (e.g., [11]). The consequences of reducing the host’s

Symbiosis
Fig. 3.6 Showing examples of the ﬁtness reached after 20,000 generations when the host has
different degrees of control over the evolutionary behaviour of its hereditary endosymbiont
level of control over the endosymbiont can be explored relatively easily within the
model by introducing a probability for the acceptance of any host-detrimental but
endosymbiont-beneﬁcial mutations. That is, if such a case arises, the host-detrimental
mutation is accepted for the endosymbiont if the given probability—the inverse of
the host’s percentage of control—is satisﬁed.
Figure 3.6 shows examples of how the host’s ﬁtness is affected depending upon its
level of control. When it has no control (0%), ﬁtnesses are as in the standard NKCS
model shown above in Fig. 3.2, and when it has full control (100%), ﬁtnesses are
as above in Fig. 3.4. As can be seen, when C = 1, there is a slight beneﬁt (T-test,
p < 0.05) from increasing control from 80 to 100% when K = 0, regardless of N,
otherwise there is no beneﬁt in increased control over the endosymbiont. As noted
above, since C effectively becomes K when the host has 100% control, the beneﬁt
seen is due to the aforementioned rise in optima height when K > 0. It is interesting
to note that full control is required to gain that beneﬁt, even though C > K. When
C is further increased, the rate of control required to obtain a beneﬁt to the host’s
ﬁtness is reduced from 100%. For example, as shown in Fig. 3.6, regardless of N,
when C = 5, a beneﬁt is seen (T-test, p < 0.05) from over 20% control when C > K.
When N = 100, a similar beneﬁt is seen for all K. Again, the effects of K →N are
seen for the smaller N.

3.2 Endosymbiosis in the NKCS Model
25
Fig. 3.7 Showing examples of the ﬁtness reached after 20,000 generations when the host has
different degrees of control over the evolutionary behaviour of its hereditary endosymbiont which
is evolving ten times faster (R = 10)
As noted above, following [7] the models have assumed that the two symbionts
evolve at the same rate; each species coevolves in turn in the standard NKCS model
but a new parameter R can be introduced (Fig. 3.3). Figure 3.7 shows results from
R = 10, i.e., the symbiont undertakes ten rounds of selection and mutation per one
by the host. As can be seen, when C = 1 the results are the same as observed for R =
1 in Fig. 3.5. However, when C = 5, the host’s ﬁtness is signiﬁcantly lower (T-test,
p < 0.05) until its level of control is over 80% compared to the R = 1 case, and
that no beneﬁt from increased control is seen until it is over 40%. Hence a further,
potentially signiﬁcant beneﬁt from forming an hereditary endosymbiosis is seen by
the host if it also enables a reduction in the relative rate of evolution of the symbiont
(see also [1]).
3.3
Horizontal Gene Transfer in Hereditary Endosymbiosis
As suggested above, symbiogenesis can be seen to act as a positive feedback loop in
which each evolved beneﬁcial adaption to the symbiosis further increases the asso-
ciation’s chances of selection, thereby decreasing the partners’ isolated ﬁtness; the
symbionts engaged in the association become increasingly obligate over evolutionary
time (e.g., see [8]). Redundant traits are often selected against, which may include
traits critical to the partners’ isolated existence, further exaggerating this unifying
process. A loss of genetic material is often seen within more intimate symbioses
due to horizontal gene transfer: “[w]ith the transfer of genes, a symbiosis becomes
more closely integrated. Part of the genome of one symbiont is transferred to the
genome of the other. The new genome may underlie metabolic pathways leading to
an advantageous product that neither partner was capable of producing alone” [11].

Symbiosis
Within the NKCS model there is no scope for the emergence of novel functionali-
ties but it can be used to examine the selective performance of gene transfer as a way
of conﬁguring interdependent genes. The original use of the model to explore this
aspect of symbiogenesis assumed that all genes had been transferred to the genome
of the host [2]. A later version of the model explored the effects of transferring a
percentage T of the endosymbiont’s genes to the host for various relative rates of
evolution R between the two [1], where 0% ≤T ≤50%. Smaller values of T of up
to 30% were found to be selectively neutral for the endosymbiont, becoming detri-
mental thereafter, regardless of R and for C > 1. However, it was assumed that the
host had no selective control over the evolution of the endosymbiont, with it seeing
a beneﬁt from T ≥30% for all R and C > 1.
Figure 3.8 shows examples of including horizontal gene transfer in the above
model with varying levels of control over the endosymbiont’s evolution by the host.
The percentage T is taken from the left-hand end of the genome of the endosymbiont
and placed onto the right-hand end of the host’s genome. The ﬁtness contribution of
the transferred genes to the host are calculated using the same tables as before, i.e.,
from the endosymbiotic species’ ﬁtness function, and the total is now normalised
by N + T%, with the position of all the original K and C connections of the trans-
ferred genes maintained in both cases. Endosymbionts subsequently have their ﬁtness
contributions normalised by N −T%.
As can be seen by comparing Figs. 3.8 to 3.6, no signiﬁcant beneﬁts are obtained
by the host when C is low (C = 1) until T = 90% and then only in the C > K
case of K = 0, at a level of control of 80% or less (T-test, p < 0.05). When C =
5, T = 30% is beneﬁcial when C > K at a level of control of 80% or less. It is
also beneﬁcial for higher K with a level of control of 40% or less. As T is further
increased, the host experiences increasing beneﬁt for all levels of control less than
100%, such that by T = 90% there is no signiﬁcant difference in ﬁtness reached
regardless of the level of control, as might be expected. That is, horizontal gene
transfer can be seen as a mechanism through which the host is able to exert control
over the endosymbiont. Other direct mechanisms of control might include physical
space restrictions, expelling endosymbionts, etc. and the negative effect on selection
for the host representing an indirect mechanism for control, of course.
The effects of increasing R have also been explored here. Figure 3.9 shows exam-
ple results from R = 10, with the most marked change seen when T = 30% and
C = 5 compared to the equivalent case when R = 1. Similarly to the results seen
in Fig. 3.7, the increase in the relative rate of evolution in the endosymbiont causes
a signiﬁcant drop (T-test, p < 0.05) in ﬁtness for the host until a signiﬁcant level of
control can be exerted, over 80% here for K > 0. The higher percentages of gene
transfer appear able to negate the detrimental effects of less control thereafter.

Discussion
Symbiosis is a fundamental process in nature and its role in the evolution of com-
plexity is clear. Using the abstract NKCS model it has been shown that the formation
of intimate symbioses is generally beneﬁcial to the host since their inter-dependence
becomes intra-dependence, i.e., the host’s ﬁtness landscape becomes more rugged
and stable. In doing so, it has been shown that the genome length of the host can be
signiﬁcant with respect to the effects of the coupling between the symbionts before

in a single event through the inheritance of a pre-adapted set of genes and subse-
quently cause an increase in the ruggedness of the ﬁtness landscape of the host. Such
hosts have also been shown more likely to undergo a further symbiotic event. Thus
symbiogenesis can indeed be seen to facilitate further increases in complexity.
It has been shown how the level of control of the host over the (enslaved) endosym-
biont can be critical and horizontal gene transfer represents one mechanism by which
that can be achieved. Mitochondrial DNA can contain anywhere from 3 to 67 genes
and chloroplasts 60 to 100, with the assumption the rest of their original DNA has
transferred to the nucleus, although some may simply have been lost. However, it is
not clear why such organelle DNA remains (e.g., see [5]). The results here predict
remaining organelle DNA since the ﬁndings indicate no potential beneﬁt to the host
from over 90% of genes being transferred in all cases and no signiﬁcant beneﬁt from
over 60% of genes being transferred for lower levels of ﬁtness landscape ruggedness.

Chapter 4
Sex
Whilst a number of explanations for various aspects of the evolution and maintenance
of eukaryotic sex have been presented, none gives a unifying view of the wide
variations in the process seen in nature. Sex is here deﬁned as successive rounds
of syngamy and meiosis in a haploid-diploid lifecycle. This chapter suggests that
the emergence of a haploid-diploid cycle enabled the exploitation of a rudimentary
form of the Baldwin effect (e.g., see [20] for an overview) and that this provides an
underpinning explanation for all the observed forms of sex [5].
As discussed in [16, p. 150] the ﬁrst step in the evolution of eukaryotic sex was
the emergence of a haploid-diploid cycle, probably via endomitosis, before simple
syngamy. Cleveland [8] was ﬁrst to suggest that organisms may become diploid by
a variation in mitosis to maintain the genome copy, i.e., endomitosis. Syngamy, the
fusion of two independent genomes, probably emerged thereafter. The subsequent
emergence of isogamy, i.e., mating types, is not considered in this chapter. Under
both scenarios, a previously haploid cell became diploid. A number of explanations
have been presented for why a diploid, or increasing ploidy in general, is beneﬁcial,
typically based around the potential for “hiding” mutations within extra copies of the
genome (e.g., see [17] for an overview). A change in ploidy can potentially alter gene
expression, and hence the phenotype, even if no mutations occur between the lower
and higher ploidy states—through epigenetic mechanisms, through rates of changes
in gene product concentrations, no or partial or co-dominance, etc. (e.g., see [7]).
In all cases, whether the diploid is formed via endomitosis or syngamy, the ﬁtness
of the cell/organism is a combination of the ﬁtness contributions of the composite
haploid genomes. If the cell subsequently remains diploid and reproduces asexually,
there is no scope for a rudimentary Baldwin effect. However, if there is a reversion to
haploid cells under meiosis, there is potential for a mismatch between the utility of
the haploids compared to that of the polyploid; individual haploids do not contain all
of the genetic material over which selection operated. That is, the effects of genome
combination can be seen as a simple form of phenotypic plasticity for the individual
haploid genomes before they revert to a solitary state and hence the Baldwin effect
may occur.

4.1
The Baldwin Effect in the NK Model
Recall that in the NK model used throughout this book, the population is of size one
and a species evolves by making a random change to one randomly chosen gene
per generation. Following [3], a very simple (random) learning process to enable
phenotypic plasticity can be added to evolution by allowing a new individual to make
a further L (unique) mutations after the ﬁrst. If the averaged ﬁtness of this “learned”
conﬁguration and that of the ﬁrst mutant is greater than that of the original, the species
is said to move to the ﬁrst mutant conﬁguration but assigned the averaged ﬁtness of
the two conﬁgurations. All results reported are the average of 10 runs (random start
points) on each of 10 NK functions, that is 100 runs, for 50,000 generations. Here
0 ≤K ≤15 and 0 < L ≤7, for N = 20 and N = 100.
Figure 4.1 shows the performance of the Baldwin effect across a wide range of K
and L combinations for N = 20. For K = 0, the unimodal case, learning shows no
beneﬁt for evolution (T-test, p ≥0.05, 0 < L < 7) and is disruptive when applied at
higher levels (T-test, p < 0.05, L = 7). As K increases, i.e., as landscape ruggedness
increases, learning becomes beneﬁcial across a wider range of L. When 0 < K < 6,
learning is either beneﬁcial (T-test, p < 0.05, 0 < L < 7), or has no effect (T-test, p ≥
0.05, L = 7). Learning is always beneﬁcial over the ranges used when K ≥6 (T-test,
p < 0.05). The smallest amount of learning L = 1 is as beneﬁcial as any other until
K > 6, when the higher levels are most beneﬁcial (T-test, p < 0.05, L ≥5). The same
results are typically seen for N = 100, although the higher amounts of learning are
not found beneﬁcial for K > 4 (Fig. 4.2). These ﬁndings support those reported in
[3]: the most beneﬁcial amount of learning varies with K.
As noted above, as well as the most useful amount of such random learning
varying with the ruggedness of the ﬁtness landscape, i.e., L, it was also shown how
the frequency at which the simple learning process is applied to an individual can
alter the conditions under which the Baldwin effect is beneﬁcial [3]. Figure 4.3 shows
examples from varying the frequency of learning both within and across lifecycles. In
the previous results, the ﬁtness of a genome was calculated as the average of its purely
genetic conﬁguration and that of the learned conﬁguration. Thus learning can be seen
to have occurred throughout the lifecycle. This can be varied such that the ﬁtness of
the learned conﬁguration is weighted less equally to the genetic conﬁguration: less
learning. Examples of the case of learning being weighted at 50% are shown in the
top row of Fig. 4.3. Results show learning is now beneﬁcial for all L for K = 2,
with no signiﬁcant change in behaviour to Fig. 4.1 for 2 < K ≤6, whilst learning
is no longer beneﬁcial for K > 6 (T-test, p ≥0.05). Figure 4.2 also shows examples
from only allowing the original whole lifecycle learning to occur on every other
generation. The results are the same as for the half lifecycle case, except there is no
drop in beneﬁt for K > 6.

Evolution of the Haploid-Diploid Cycle: The Baldwin
Effect
Whether the haploid-diploid cycle emerged via endomitosis or via a simple form
of syngamy is not crucial to the basic hypothesis presented here. As noted above,
explanations primarily based around mutation hiding have been given as to why a
diploid state is beneﬁcial to a haploid state. Similarly, there are explanations for the

emergence of the alternation between the two states, typically based upon its being
driven by changes in the environment (after [15]). If, as suggested here, the diploid
state should be seen as the “learning” part of the lifecycle due to genome interactions,
the results above anticipate the wide range of different haploid-diploid frequencies
seen in nature. For example, most mammals have a primarily diploid lifecycle, many
land plants exploit a (signiﬁcant) haploid seed phase, etc. That is, as K and L vary,
the optimal frequency with which learning occurs varies. Following [16, p. 150],
endomitosis is assumed to have occurred ﬁrst in this chapter.
The standard NK model (Sect. 2.1) is altered such that once the haploid genetic
mutant is created, a copy is made and another gene chosen for further mutation
(Fig. 4.4, left). Both genomes are evaluated and, for simplicity, the ﬁtness of the
diploid is assigned as their average. If the diploid is ﬁtter than the diploid representing
the current population, the species is said to move to the new conﬁguration. Again
for simplicity, selection picks one of the two genomes of the diploid at random. For
higher levels of ploidy (four and eight) explored, the copy and mutation process is
repeated equally for each new genome to the required level. That is, the rounds of
endomitosis can be seen as rounds of learning by the cell/organism.
Figure 4.5 shows examples of how a haploid-diploid cycle via endomitosis is
beneﬁcial over a purely haploid (non-learning) cycle for all K > 0 (T-test, p < 0.05).
It can also be seen that a further round of endomitosis to a tetraploid state before
meiosis provides no beneﬁt over diploidy for any K (T-test, p ≥0.05), except when
K = 4 (T-test, p < 0.05), with another round to octaploidy providing no beneﬁt for
low K and becoming detrimental for K ≥6 (T-test, p ≥0.05). The same behaviour
was found for N = 100 (not shown).
The case for a haploid-diploid being beneﬁcial was predicted above since the
endomitotically produced genome is the same as the L = 1 case which was found
to be beneﬁcial for all K > 0. That the tetraploidy case is beneﬁcial over the haploid
for higher K is also anticipated by the previous results. However, whilst tetraploidy
and octaploidy may be seen as the L = 3 and L = 7 cases respectively, they are
subtly different. In the basic model, all L random learning changes are made in one
copy of the genome. In the polyploidy cases, each further random learning change
is made in genomes copied from genomes which have already had changes made.
Hence increasing ploidy both increases the distance learning can sample from the
original evolution produced genome point in the ﬁtness landscape and the number
of learning samples. For example, two genomes have L = 1 and one L = 2 in the
tetraploid case. Thus increasing the number of samples also appears disruptive, even
for lower range L.

Figure 4.6 shows the comparative performance of the haploid-diploid cycle under
endomitosis from Fig. 4.5 to that of the equivalent simple syngamy case. In the latter,
the new diploid is created either by copying and mutating one gene in each of the

4.2 Evolution of the Haploid-Diploid Cycle: The Baldwin Effect
37
species’ two genomes, or by copying either genome twice and then mutating each
once (Fig. 4.4). Both genomes are initialized as the same.
Figure 4.6 shows how there is no difference between either mechanism to provide
the diploid stage for K < 6, whereafter endomitosis proves more beneﬁcial (T-test,
p < 0.05). The reason for this difference is again due to the difference in the amount
of learning occurring per cycle; the results in Fig. 4.1 indicate a general beneﬁt from
an increased amount of learning with increasing ﬁtness landscape ruggedness. In
the endomitosis case, the learning change is added onto the genetic mutation of the
ﬁrst offspring genome in the second offspring genome. In the syngamy case, both
genomes undergo the ﬁrst genetic mutation change only. When the same genome is
chosen twice to form the diploid, the syngamy case’s sampling distance in the ﬁtness
landscape from the evolutionary origin is reduced in comparison to the equivalent
endomitosis case (by one mutant step). When the two genomes are different in the
syngamy case, this is not necessarily true, depending upon the degree of genetic
diversity between the two original haploid genomes. As above, when N = 100, the
extra learning—of endomitosis—provides no extra beneﬁt and both perform equally
well for all K (not shown). Comparison with an equivalent asexual diploid ﬁnds both
endomitosis and syngamy more beneﬁcial for all K > 2 (T-test, p < 0.05, not shown).
This is also true even if all three possible diploid combinations from the two haploid
genomes are evaluated per generation (T-test, p < 0.05, not shown). As noted above,
no Baldwin effect can occur.
The type of Baldwin effect working here can be seen to alter the general char-
acteristics of the evolutionary process. In the traditional haploid view of evolution,
variation operators such as mutation copy errors, gene transfers, etc., generate a new
genome at a point in the ﬁtness landscape for evaluation. Under the haploid-diploid
cycle, the variation operators create the bounds for sampling a region within the
haploid ﬁtness landscape by specifying two end points, i.e., each haploid genome to
be partnered in the diploid. The actual position of the ﬁtness point for the (diploid)
phenotype taken from within that region then depends upon the percentage of the
lifecycle the diploid state occupies—the larger, the closer to the midpoint (with all
other things being equal) in the haploid landscape. Signiﬁcantly, evolution assigns
a single ﬁtness value to the region of the ﬁtness landscape the two haploid genomes
delineate—evolution can be seen to be generalizing over the space.
This explains the increased beneﬁt of the haploid-diploid cycle seen above as
landscape ruggedness is increased. It can also be noted that the shape of the ﬁtness
landscape varies based upon the haploid genomes which exist within a given popula-
tion at any time and how they are paired: sexual selection can be seen as a mechanism
through which this is exploited. This is also signiﬁcant since, as has been pointed
out for coevolutionary ﬁtness landscapes [4], such movement potentially enables the
temporary creation of neutral paths, where the beneﬁts of (static) landscape neutrality
are well-established [12].

Two-Step Meiosis and Recombination: Altering
the Amount of Learning
The few explanations as to why a form of meiosis exists which includes a genome
doubling stage—the diploid temporarily becomes a tetraploid—range from DNA
repair (e.g., [1]) to the suppression of potentially selﬁsh/damaging alleles (after
[10]). Explanations for the recombination stage vary from the removal of deleterious
mutations (e.g., [13] to avoiding parasites (after [11]) (see [2] for an overview).
With the Baldwin effect view proposed here, such sexual reproduction can be seen
as a mechanism through which to vary the amount of learning a cell/organism can
exploit during the diploid phase. The role of recombination becomes clear under the
Baldwin effect view: recombination moves the current end points in the underlying
haploid ﬁtness space which deﬁne the generalization either closer together or further
apart. That is, recombination adjusts the size of an area assigned a single ﬁtness value,
potentially enabling higher ﬁtness regions to be more accurately identiﬁed over time.
Moreover, recombination can also be seen to facilitate genetic assimilation within
the simple form of the Baldwin effect. That is, the pairing of haploid genomes is
seen as a “learning” step with the ﬁtness of a given haploid affected by the allele
values of its partner. If the pairing is beneﬁcial and the diploid cell/organism is chosen
under selection to reproduce, the recombination process brings an assortment of those
partnered genes together into new haploid genomes. In this way the ﬁtter alleles from
the pair of partnered haploids may come to exist within individual haploids more
quickly than under mutation alone.

the two parental haploid genomes each become a gamete alongside their one-mutant

haploids are again initialised as the same here to consider the emergence of the

process, a limitation removed in subsequent sections/chapters. Figure 4.7 (right)
shows the typical behaviour for various K. In comparison with both endomitosis and
syngamy, it is found that the increased learning is beneﬁcial for all K > 2 (T-test,
p < 0.05), as anticipated by the results in Sect. 4.1. The same general results as
before are found for N = 100—the extra learning provides no beneﬁt (not shown).
However, greatly increasing the number of possible recombination points such that
each gene is swapped with equal probability, means improved performance is again
seen (Fig. 4.8) for K > 4 (T-test, p < 0.05, K = 6; p ≤0.10, K = 10, 15). That is,
the increased potential variation in the size of the generalization (end positions) is
required for the larger ﬁtness landscape. Similarly, a signiﬁcant drop in performance
is seen for all cases when recombination is removed (not shown).
As noted above, the percentage of their lifecycle eukaryotes spend as diploids
varies greatly across species. Similarly, some species alternate between being sexual
and asexual, such as aphids. Following the results in Fig. 4.3 (top), the case of half
the lifecycle being spent as a haploid can be considered. Here one of the two haploids
is chosen at random to make a 50% contribution to the ﬁtness of the offspring, with
the other 50% determined as the pair’s average, as before. Figure 4.9 (left) shows
how there is no signiﬁcant difference in ﬁtness for K < 10 (T-test, p ≥0.05) but a
signiﬁcant decrease in ﬁtness is seen for K ≥10 (T-test, p < 0.05) compared to the
animal-like diploid lifecycle case considered in Fig. 4.7. Other percentages of time
as a haploid have not been explored here but the results in Fig. 4.3 suggest beneﬁcial
weightings exist. Figure 4.2 (bottom) also showed the potential beneﬁts of varying
the frequency of learning. Figure 4.9 (right) shows how varying the frequency of
sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction, where the diploid is mutated once in
each haploid to form an offspring in the latter, provides an increase in ﬁtness at a
ratio of asexual generations to one sexual generation of 7:1 (T-test, p ≤0.10) for
K = 2, with no signiﬁcant change otherwise. No beneﬁt was found for the other
ratios and values of K explored (not shown). However, it can also be noted that if

Genome Growth in Sexual Diploids
Chapter 2 explored the effects of extending the basic NK model such that genome
size could vary under mutation for asexual diploids. Figure 4.10 shows the effects of
enabling genome growth in sexual diploids, with G = 1. Note each haploid genome
again either experiences a gene allele mutation or gene addition event, with equal
probability. The recombination point is taken from within the range of the shorter of
the two genomes when they are of different length. As can be seen, ﬁtness levels are
higher for all K > 0 in comparison to the equivalent haploid case (Fig. 2.3) (T-test,
p < 0.05) and there is an increased amount of growth in all cases (T-test, p < 0.05).
Figure 4.11 shows the underlying dynamics of the evolutionary process with the
diploids. The general ﬁnding from Chap. 2 that genome length variation continues for
longer with increasing landscape ruggedness is again seen here. However, evolution
continues for much longer than for the haploids (Fig. 2.4). Figure 4.12 shows how
this longer period of evolution creates the conditions for the adoption of many novel
sequences, particularly early on (contrast with Fig. 2.5).
The diploids of course contain 2N genes. To explore the reason(s) for the increased
levels of growth, asexual haploids of 2N genes have also been evolved with G = 1
but similar lengths were seen as with N genes (not shown). Figure 4.13 shows an
example of evolving equivalent asexual diploids, i.e., diploids which do not undergo
the haploid-diploid cycle with meiosis. Results indicate that similar lengths evolve

as in the equivalent sexual diploid case and therefore neither the Baldwin effect
mentioned nor recombination can be seen to be signiﬁcantly contributing to the
change in behaviour. As noted above, ﬁtness levels are lower for K > 2 in the asexual
diploid case (T-test, p < 0.05), even if all three one-mutation combinations for the
two haploid genomes are tried per generation (not shown). Hence the main reason
for the relative increase in genome length appears to be the change in dynamic(s)

experienced when two haploid genomes contribute to the ﬁtness level. This is the
case even if only one of the two genomes is allowed to experience an addition event
per generation—although slightly reduced lengths are seen (not shown).
When G = 20, evolved genome lengths in the asexual haploids and sexual diploids
are roughly equivalent (Fig. 2.6). That is, the period of time where changes in genome
length are seen in diploids becomes similar to that seen in the haploids and hence a
similar number of novel sequences are adopted in the time, particularly for N = 20.
Thereafter, the general behaviour is the same for the diploids as the haploids (not
shown) in that the most marked difference between G = 1 and G = 20 is again an
increase in ﬁtness for K > 6 (T-test, p < 0.05) when N = 20 (Fig. 4.14).
Similarly, when genome lengths can both increase and decrease by G, ﬁtness
levels remain unaffected but signiﬁcantly less growth is seen for all K such that
there is no difference between the sexual diploids and asexual haploids (not shown).
Figure 4.15 shows how the sexual diploids are more sensitive to the presence of

Coevolving Sexual Diploids
As in Chap. 3, all previous known studies of coevolution with the NKCS model have
used asexual haploid species. Given the results in this chapter within the NK model,
the behaviour of sexual diploid species in the NKCS model can be compared with the
typical behaviour seen with asexual haploids and to determine where sex is beneﬁcial
or not within a coevolutionary context. Figure 4.16 shows examples of extending the
NKCS model such that one of a pair of species is a sexual diploid with the other an

asexual haploid. Comparing to Fig. 3.2, with C = 1 and N = 20 or N = 100, an
increase in ﬁtness compared to the equivalent asexual haploid can be seen for K > 0
(T-test, p < 0.05), presumably due to the Baldwin effect again being exploited as in
the NK model (where C = 0). When C = 3 and N = 20, sexual diploidy results in
an increase in ﬁtness over the haploid when K > 4 (T-test, p < 0.05) but it is always
worse with N = 100 (T-test, p < 0.05). Conversely, with C = 5 and N = 20, sexual
diploidy results in a lower ﬁtness compared to the haploid when K < 6 (T-test, p <
0.05), with no signiﬁcant difference for all K when N = 100 (T-test, p ≥0.05).

species coevolving with another sexual diploid species on landscapes of varying ruggedness (K)
and length (N) with C = 3
Figure 4.17 shows examples when both species are sexual diploids. Comparing
to Fig. 4.16, with C = 1 or C = 5 and N = 20 or N = 100, there is no difference
in ﬁtness compared to the equivalent case coevolving with an asexual haploid for all
K (T-test, p ≥0.05). When C = 3 and N = 20 there is again no difference for all K
(T-test, p ≥0.05) but with N = 100 an increase in ﬁtness is seen when K > 4 (T-test,
p < 0.05).
As in the traditional NKCS model, the assumption above is that the two species
evolve at the same rate. Following results in Chap. 3, the new parameter R can
again be added to the model to represent the relative rate at which one of the two
species evolves—by undertaking R rounds of mutation and selection to each round
by the other. Figure 4.18 shows results for a sexual diploid species coevolving with
an asexual haploid species. As can be seen, with N = 100, an increase in R again
decreases ﬁtness for all K when C > 1. Moreover, the ﬁtness reached for R > 1
is typically signiﬁcantly lower (T-test, p < 0.05) than in the equivalent case for

advantage (or neutrality) from sexual reproduction seen above with R = 1 is lost.
Results with N = 20 show no signiﬁcant change in ﬁtness, as was the case with the
asexual haploids (not shown).
Figure 4.19 shows the case where both species are sexual diploids. As can be seen,
with N = 20, there are instances when increasing R can increase the ﬁtness of the
slower species, when K = 2 and C = 3, when K = 6 and C = 5, and when K = 10
and C = 5 (T-test, p < 0.05). This is perhaps somewhat unexpected but again shows
how the optimal amount of learning can vary for a given scenario. Results when
N = 100 are the same as when the partner is asexual above (not shown).

Discussion
This chapter has suggested that the haploid-diploid cycle seen in all eukaryotic sex
exploits a rudimentary form of the Baldwin effect, with the diploid phase seen as the
“learning” step [5]. With this explanation for the basic cycle, the other associated
phenomena such as recombination, varying the duration of the periods of haploid and

4.6 Discussion
47
diploid state, etc. can be explained as evolution tuning the amount and frequency of
learning experienced by an organism. Eukaryotic evolution is seen as reﬁning gen-
eralizations over regions of the ﬁtness landscape to identify ﬁt genomes, in contrast
to varying the position of single points as in prokaryotic evolution. This explanation
does not seemingly contradict any of the mentioned previous explanations for the
various stages of eukaryotic sex, rather it presents a unifying process which underpins
it and over which many other phenomena may also be occurring.
This hypothesis was based on previous work investigating the Baldwin effect
which showed how the optimal amount and/or frequency of learning varied with
the ruggedness of the underlying ﬁtness landscape [3]. It is perhaps interesting to
note that, in its assuming an animal-like diploid-dominated haploid-diploid lifecycle,
conditions exist in the model at K = 4 under which both endomitosis and syngamy
with a single-step meiosis are equivalent and that syngamy with a two-step meiosis
and recombination is most beneﬁcial.
A haploid-diploid cycle has not been shown beneﬁcial in the simplest case of K =
0. Some experimental results suggest the average degree of connectivity/epistasis in
eukaryotic organisms is typically higher than in prokaryotes (e.g., [14]). This offers
one reason why the cycle did not evolve in prokaryotes. Further, it has been suggested
in Chap. 3 that the accumulation of mitochondria—and then chloroplasts—through
symbiogenesis caused an increase in the ruggedness of the ﬁtness landscape of the
resultant early eukaryote as inter-dependence became intra-dependence (after [6]).
This can also been seen as creating/aiding the conditions under which a rudimen-
tary Baldwin effect process would prove beneﬁcial. Note that ploidy variation is
particularly prevalent in plants (e.g., [19]), where chloroplasts can be seen to further
increase K.
Varying ploidy levels in cell types in multicellular organisms can be seen as a
further mechanism by which the amount and frequency of learning is ﬁne-tuned.
That is, the ruggedness of the ﬁtness landscape contributions for different cell types
need not be uniform [9]. The simplicity of the model requires mutational differences
between genomes whereas some of the other effects noted above, such as gene
product concentrations, could be tuned through varying ploidy levels which may
explain why higher ploidy was not beneﬁcial here.
Signiﬁcantly, it was shown how increasing the size of the genome space (N =
100) decreased the beneﬁts of the higher learning rates seen with smaller N (N = 20).
Thus whilst endomitosis (to diploidy), synagmy, and syngamy with recombination
were always found beneﬁcial over the haploid case for K > 0, the added beneﬁt of
a two-step meiosis with a single recombination point over endomitosis or syngamy
was lost with N = 100, and a greater number of recombination points were needed to
retain the beneﬁt of the latter. However, it is known that “upper and lower tolerance
limits for chromosome size seem to exist for some groups of organisms” [18]. The
ﬁnding here suggests why that is and, moreover, provides a subsequent reason for the
maintenance of multiple chromosomes within eukaryotes. Evolution can be seen to
tune chromosome length and number to make most effective use of the rudimentary
learning process for the overall genome. Since signiﬁcant increases in a given chro-
mosome’s size would disrupt that process, increases in overall genome size are more

48

Sex
effectively realized through increasing the number of chromosomes since that can
be seen to also increase the number of overall recombination points; dividing genes
into chromosomes introduces ﬁxed recombination points in the overall genome, in
addition to varying the number of potential recombination events within each of the
different chromosomes. This is returned to in the next chapter.
Following results from Chap. 2 where varying the size of genomes during evolu-
tion was explored for asexual haploids, results here suggest very similar dynamics
occur for sexual diploids. That is, ﬁtness landscape ruggedness does not hinder
genome growth and can actually promote it, including enabling the avoidance of the
complexity catastrophe for higher levels of gene epistasis for small N. In particular,
sexual diploid organisms which experience low levels of sequence deletion compared
to that of addition have been found to accept the most novel sequences when they
are small. Retrotransposons can perhaps be seen to fulﬁl this role in eukaryotes.
The coevoloutionary behaviour of sexual diploids has also been explored and
they are found to be more sensitive to the effects of ﬁtness landscape coupling than
asexual haploids. That is, the Baldwin effect smoothing process is seen to be both
beneﬁcial and detrimental on such moving ﬁtness landscapes. These ﬁndings extend
those above and previously reported in the NK model.

Chapter 5
Chromosomes
Chromosome size, number and types are some of the degrees of freedom exploited
by evolution in the variation of eukaryotic organism complexity and this can be seen
to have increased over time in some lineages. This chapter explores the effects of
ﬁtness landscape ruggedness upon various aspects of chromosomes drawing upon
the results in Chap. 4: the effects of varying the number of chromosomes in a sexual
diploid are explored using versions of the NK model. Results suggest that landscape
ruggedness, chromosome length, and the initial function of the chromosome copy,
can all affect evolution. The effects of sex determination chromosomes and hence
mating types is also explored within the model, with the XY (ZW) and X0 (Z0)
systems shown to be beneﬁcial under certain conditions due to the ruggedness of the
ﬁtness landscape.
Dominance has typically been explained either as a consequence of enzymatic
pathways with selection playing little or no role (e.g., [5]) or as a consequence of
maintained periods of high degrees of allele heterogeneity (e.g., [3]). Under the afore-
mentioned new view of eukaryotic evolution, a new explanation for the emergence
of dominance is also presented.
5.1
Chromosome Number
As noted in Chap. 4, since recombination can be viewed as both a mechanism through
which the size of the generalizations over the ﬁtness landscape are altered and through
which genetic assimilation occurs, the most beneﬁcial rate will probably be inﬂu-
encedbylandscaperuggedness (K) andgenomesize(N). Indeed, it was demonstrated
in Fig. 4.8 that ﬁtness could be increased for some values of K (6 ≤K ≤15) with N =
100 using a recombination process where each gene in the non-sister genome copies
was swapped with equal probability rather than at a chosen single point. This was
suggested as a possible explanation for the variation in the number of types of chro-
mosome seen in eukaryotes since each chromosome may be seen to represent ﬁxed

recombination points—or ﬁxed points of possible gene mixing—within the overall
genome during meiosis. That it may be beneﬁcial for some N and K combinations
to have the overall genome subdivided into a number (n) of types of chromosome
has been further explored here.
Figure 5.1 shows examples of how ﬁtness can vary with the original pair of haploid
genomes of length N subdivided into n equal sections, where1 ≤n ≤10, i.e., there
are 2n sections in total per diploid. Here each subdivision of N/n genes of the overall
N genes undergoes the same process of two-step meiosis with recombination as
described above for the original genomes. That is, the ﬁrst pair of N/n genes is
copied and non-sisters recombined, with one of the resulting four sets of genes then
chosen at random. This process is repeated n times for each successive section of N/n
genes. Once the resulting overall genome is created, mutation is applied as before.
With N = 20, a signiﬁcant increase in ﬁtness is found over n = 1 when K = 15
and n = 5 (T-test, p < 0.10). With N = 100, a signiﬁcant increase in ﬁtness is found
over n = 1 when K = 2 and n = 5 (T-test, p < 0.05). Thus it appears dividing a
genome into chromosomes is more disruptive than simply increasing the number of
recombination points in a single genome.

5.1 Chromosome Number
53
Whilst it is possible for chromosomes to break or fuse during reproduction, one
of the primary mechanisms for the evolution of increased complexity in eukaryotes
has been the production and subsequent maintenance of extra copies of one or more
chromosomes. Allowing evolution to vary the number of chromosomes of a diploid
in this way can be explored within the model.
To enable the number of chromosomes in the model to vary under evolution, i.e., to
vary n from an initial n = 1 thereby altering the overall genome length, reproduction is
here expanded such that either two-step meiosis with recombination occurs for each
chromosome pair as described above or a change in the number of chromosomes
in one of the two constituent haploid genomes is made. If a change in n is made, a
randomly chosen chromosome in a randomly chosen haploid genome is either copied
and added to the genome or the last added is removed (equal probability). Deletions
and additions are bounded 0 < n ≤20, two-step meiosis with recombination only
occurs when a corresponding pair of chromosomes exist, with the extra chromosomes
of a longer haploid being copied probabilistically half of the time. Finally, mutation is
applied to one randomly chosen gene, in one randomly chosen chromosome, in each
haploidtocreateanoffspring.TheNKmodelnowcontainsanarrayofthe(maximum)
n ﬁtness functions each for N genes for evaluation and overall ﬁtness values are the
normalised sum of the given nN gene contributions per haploid. Selection is biased
against an increase in n since ties in ﬁtness are decided in favour of the smallest
average n, with further ties broken at random as before.
When the n ﬁtness functions are created at random, i.e., as in the standard NK
model, no signiﬁcant increase in chromosome number from n ≈1 is seen and ﬁtness
levels remain unaffected for all K, regardless of N (not shown). To some extent this
ﬁnding is predicted by the results shown in Fig. 5.1 where n = 1 is typically as
good as the other (pre-determined) values explored. Note the potential for explicit
cross-chromosome epistasis in Fig. 5.1 does not exist here either.

ruggedness and the corresponding average number of chromosomes to emerge from n = 1 where
all chromosomes are evaluated on the same function

Chromosomes
Figure 5.2 shows example results where all n ﬁtness functions are the same. That
is, the process of chromosome duplication is said to result in the new copy main-
taining the original ﬁtness contribution without disruption, e.g., from dosage effects.
Although not explored here, such extra copies are then able to diverge in function
over time (e.g., [4]). As can be seen, with N = 20, the number of chromosomes
which emerge decreases with K, over the range 4 < n < 10. Moreover, there is no
signiﬁcant change in the ﬁtness reached in comparison to the equivalent ﬁxed n =
1 case above, for the majority of K (T-test, p ≥0.05). That is, the duplications are
effectively selectively neutral which creates the potential for subsequent divergence
in function(s). There is one exception to this ﬁnding with K = 6 where an increase
in ﬁtness is seen (T-test, p < 0.05) and n ≈8. In contrast, with N = 100, ﬁtness tends
to be signiﬁcantly lower for all K and high average values of n (n ≈20) emerge (not
shown).
Although functional divergence is not possible here, it is possible for the copies
of the chromosome in an individual to diverge genetically through the accumulation
of mutations; the n copies need not be homozygotes over time. Under such circum-
stances, an individual haploid genome would itself represent two or more points in
the underlying haploid ﬁtness landscape, with an average ﬁtness applied to all points
here. There is therefore the potential for another ﬁtness landscape smoothing effect
from such extra information which appears beneﬁcial around K = 6 with N = 20
here, but either neutral or detrimental generally.
5.2
Sex Chromosomes
The emergence of isogamy, i.e., mating types, was not considered in the explana-
tion for the evolution of two-step meiosis with recombination in Chap. 4. However,
the presence of allosomes—XY in animals and ZW in birds, some ﬁsh, reptiles,
insects, etc.—can also be explained as a mechanism by which a haploid genome
may vary the amount of learning it experiences when paired with another to form a
diploid organism. Importantly, taking the view of the constituent haploid genomes,
the presence of an heterogametic sex creates the situation where, as evolution con-
verges upon optima, a given haploid containing the common (X or Z) allosome will
typically experience two different ﬁtness values simultaneously within a population
due to genetic differences between the two sexes; two ﬁtness contributions from
the common allosome will almost always exist with two mating types. It is here
proposed that the extra (approximate) ﬁtness value information can prove beneﬁcial
to the learning/generalisation process described above by adding further landscape
smoothing.
To introduce autosomes and allosomes the original pair of haploid genomes of
length N are each subdivided into n = 2 equally sized chromosomes, i.e., there are
2n chromosomes per diploid. A (converged) sub-population of a homogametic sex
is said to exist along with a (converged) sub-population of a heterogametic sex. No

5.2 Sex Chromosomes
55
functional differentiation is imposed upon the heterogametic sex ﬁtness function
here; the ﬁtness landscapes of both sexes are identical.
Autosomes undergo two-step meiosis with recombination, as above, whereas allo-
somes do not undergo recombination. The sex of the offspring is determined by
which allosome is (randomly) selected from the heterogametic sex. Once the result-
ing overall diploid genome is created, mutation is applied to each haploid as before.
The ﬁtness contribution of the haploid genomes is their average, as above. For exam-
ple, when X-inactivation occurs in mammals the choice is typically random per cell
lineage in the placenta and hence the ﬁtness contribution of the allosomes remains a
composite of the two chromosomes.
Figure 5.3 shows examples of how the beneﬁts of sex chromosomes can vary
with landscape ruggedness and size. Note the average ﬁtness of the heteroga-
metic and homogametic sexes is shown. An equivalent (converged) population of
hermaphrodites is used for comparison here, where recombination is not used for
the second chromosome. As can be seen, for N = 20, two sexes prove beneﬁcial
for K > 4 (T-test, p < 0.05) over the hermaphrodite. In contrast, with N = 100,
two sexes prove detrimental under the same conditions (T-test, p < 0.05). Therefore
the improvement in ﬁtness seen for sex cannot simply be attributed to the presence

gene values in the two haploid genomes (n = 1) on landscapes of varying ruggedness (K) for
diploids undergoing one-step meiosis (left) and two-step meiosis with recombination (right)
of two explicit sub-populations. There is no signiﬁcant difference in ﬁtness seen for
K < 6 (T-test, p ≥0.05) for either N. It can also be noted that including recombination
in the second chromosomes (allosomes) of the hermaphrodites does not signiﬁcantly
affect their ﬁtness under any conditions explored (not shown, T-test, p ≥0.05).
As discussed in Chap. 4, increasing the amount of learning under a standard Bald-
win effect scheme gives increasing beneﬁt for K > 6 with N = 20, whereas increasing
the amount of learning decreases ﬁtness for K > 4 with N = 100. As noted above, it
is here suggested that the presence of sex chromosomes creates another mechanism
through which the ﬁtness landscape of the constituent haploids with the common allo-
some is potentially smoothed. That is, as the degree of heterogeneity between the
two haploids in the homogenetic sex converges (Fig. 5.4, right), two different ﬁtness
values/contributions of the chromosome are maintained due to the ﬁtness obtained
within the heterogametic sex. This is in contrast to hermaphrodites where eventual
near convergence of the two haploids reduces the amount of learning/smoothing as
an optimum is found. Therefore the results in Chap. 4 predict those seen here with
sex chromosomes added almost exactly: the extra learning mechanism is useful for
higher K when N = 20 and detrimental for higher K when N = 100. Although the
extra smoothing proves beneﬁcial on less rugged landscapes (K > 4) than in the
standard case with N = 20, perhaps due to the convergence of the two haploids over
time reducing the amount of learning experienced from their partnering.
It can be noted that, whilst varying between reproducing with a member of the
opposite sex and as a hermaphrodite is seemingly relatively common in nature (e.g.,
see [1]), no signiﬁcant change in behaviour was seen here for a variety of ratios
for the parameters explored (not shown). However, the explanation presented that
either form of reproduction provides a difference in the amount of learning exhibited
suggests a selective advantage for species able to suitably tune the ratio between the
two based upon current conditions.
The typical near complete suppression of one X chromosome in females can be
seen as a case of extreme dominance where dominance is a common phenomenon

5.2 Sex Chromosomes
57
in eukaryotes. However, as noted above, explanations for its existence vary. This is
explored below in the model.
5.3
Dominance
It was suggested in [2] that dominance can be explained as part of the Baldwin
effect view of the evolution of eukaryotes since it can tune the amount of learning
experienced on a per-gene basis. That is, dominance can be seen as a mechanism
through which evolution is able to bias the composite ﬁtness value assigned to the
generalization over the region of the ﬁtness landscape deﬁned by the two constituent
haploid genome end points. Hence it can be expected that the fraction of genes with
recessive alleles to emerge will vary with the ruggedness of the underlying ﬁtness
landscape—the more rugged the landscape, the less dominance (and more learning)
expected.
The basic NK model of two-step meiosis with recombination in a diploid (with
one type of chromosome, n = 1) can be extended to consider a simple dominance
mechanism. Here an extra template of length N is added to an individual where each
locus can take one of three values—0, 1, #. The ﬁrst two equate to the dominant
allele value for that locus in the case of the two genomes being heterozygote and
the last is said to indicate a lack of dominance and hence the ﬁtness contribution
is the average of the two genes, as used above. After meiosis, the offspring also
has the dominance value of one randomly chosen locus in the template altered to
another value, much like the standard gene mutation process. In the case of ﬁtness
ties between the offspring and parent, the one with fewer dominated alleles (most
#s) is chosen, with subsequent ties broken at random as before. In this way, there
is a slight selective bias against dominance. All other details remain as before and
individuals are initialised without dominance, i.e., N #s in the template.
Figure 5.5 shows how with N = 20 ﬁtness is signiﬁcantly increased for K > 0 and
with N = 100 ﬁtness is increased for 0 < K < 15 (T-test, p < 0.05, compare to Fig. 4.7).
The biggest beneﬁt is seen at K = 2 in both cases where the most use of dominated
genes emerges, dominance reducing with increasing K thereafter. Hence the ﬁtness
bias mechanism for generalizations appears more useful on more correlated ﬁtness
landscapes, apart from in the unimodal case of K = 0. It can be noted that this general
result is also seen when the genomes are initialised as homozygotes (not shown).
5.4
Discussion
Probably through their loss of a rigid cell wall, eukaryotes evolved to exploit DNA
arranged in chromosomes. Thereafter chromosome size and number has varied
through the processes of duplication and divergence (e.g., [4]). This chapter has used
the NK model to explore how ﬁtness landscape ruggedness can affect the evolution

Chromosomes
Fig. 5.5 Showing typical ﬁtness (left) reached after 20,000 generations on landscapes of varying
ruggedness and size for two-step meiosis with recombination including a dominance mechanism
(right)
of such complexity. It has been shown that chromosome number is more likely to
increase if the duplicated DNA’s initial function remains unaltered, i.e., is selectively
neutral, and the landscape is of low ruggedness, and is less likely to prove beneﬁcial
as chromosome length increases. This is in contrast to Chap. 4 (and Chap. 2 for
asexual haploids) which explored the effects of landscape ruggedness on increases
in chromosome length via the addition of novel sequences of DNA where relatively
large increases were seen to be beneﬁcial for both small and large chromosomes.
Hence the two general mechanisms can be seen to play different roles within the
evolution of complexity of eukaryotes.
A number of explanations for the evolution of mating types have been presented
(see [1] for an overview). The evolution of allosomes under isogamy was explored
here and a beneﬁcial ﬁtness landscape smoothing effect from the extra ﬁtness value
information was found for smaller, more rugged landscapes. Since no functional
differentiation or recombination was used for the allosomes, the results here apply
equally well to the emergence of XY and ZW systems due to the symmetry in the
model. Moreover, the same reasoning above applies equally well to the emergence of
X0 and Z0 systems, although the effect from the extra ﬁtness value would potentially

reduce over time as the homogametic sex converges, depending upon any dosage
effects, etc.
Although not explored here, a potential beneﬁt of the XY (ZW) system over
X0 (Z0) exists when the diploid ﬁtness landscape is considered. As shown in
Fig. 5.4 (right), hermaphrodites exploiting two-step meiosis with recombination can
be expected to eventually converge upon organisms carrying two copies of the same
(or very nearly) haploid genome. This means that over evolutionary time they become
increasingly restricted to the region of symmetry within the diploid ﬁtness landscape,
i.e., the region where constituent haploid genome A is genetically similar to haploid
genome B. However, the highest levels of ﬁtness may exist in other areas of the
diploid landscape, as shown in Fig. 5.6. One way to avoid a near complete set of
homozygotes is to maintain a region(s) in the haploid genome where recombina-

expected (bottom) to prove beneﬁcial. In the second case, high optima exist away from the area of
genome symmetry within the overall diploid ﬁtness landscape created by the two haploids. In the
XY (ZW) case, the highest optimum is where both females (males) have genomes corresponding
to the mid-point on the axis of possible gene combinations. The existence of sex chromosomes
enables the males (females) to maintain genomes corresponding to the end-point on the axis of
possible gene combinations and therefore occupy the outlier optima

tion does not occur, thereby inhibiting the assimilation process. It is here suggested
this is what the XY (ZW) system enables over the X0 (Z0) system. Asexual repro-
duction and one-step meiosis, i.e., a haploid-diploid cycle without recombination,
can also hinder convergence (Fig. 5.4). Whilst the results in Chap. 4 suggest two-
step meiosis with recombination is generally beneﬁcial over asexuality and one-step
meiosis due to the increased amount of learning, there is some overlap at low levels
of landscape ruggedness (e.g., K = 2, in Figs. 4.6 and 4.7). Parabasalid are known
to exploit simple syngamy and since they have lost their mitochondria may be seen
to exist on less rugged landscapes (after Chap. 3). It can be speculated that they
may therefore be exploiting the potential to move away from the region of symmetry
within their diploid ﬁtness landscapes. Having adopted the generally more beneﬁcial
two-step meiosis with recombination, the XY (ZW) system enables eukaryotes to
maintain heterozygotes for some regions of their overall genome space in a relatively
controlled manner.
This explains such things as why recombination does not typically occur between
allosomes but why recombination over some regions is sometimes seen; the degree
of difference is controllable. Relatedly, the two sex chromosomes can be of differ-
ent sizes which is also potentially correlated to the degree of heterogeneity required
between the two haploids to reach the higher ﬁtness areas. Note the situation can be
reversed from the XY system in the ZW system since which mating type maintains
the single copy of the common allosome is not important in exploiting the beneﬁts
described. It also helps to explain why more than two mating types exist in some
species—the presence of more than one high ﬁtness region away from the area of
symmetry in the ﬁtness landscape is exploitable by the maintenance of a correspond-
ing mating type per region. As well as serving as a mechanism through which the
underlying haploid landscape is smoothed through “appropriate” genome pairings,
as noted in Chap. 4, sexual selection can also be seen to aid the identiﬁcation of
the higher optima away from the region of symmetry when many exist. Such high
optima existing only through the existence of sexual dimorphism would explain the
maintenance of sex in even the most unchanging environments. Conversely, that
the existence of such regions may vary temporally could help to explain environ-
mental sex determination mechanisms. Moreover, similar reasoning would seem to
apply regardless of the details of the mechanism, e.g., for polygenic sex, cytoplasmic
control, etc.
Finally, a new explanation for the emergence of dominance has been presented
based on the explanation for the evolution of sex in eukaryotes which draws upon
the Baldwin effect. That is, dominance is a further mechanism by which the amount
of learning experienced may be varied.

Multicellularity
Approximately 550 million years ago the Cambrian explosion brought forth all the
major phyla of multicellular animals. Multicellularity is thought to have evolved up
to 200 million years before that and has occurred at least three times—in fungi, plants
and animals (see [9] for an overview). This chapter explores the effects of ﬁtness
landscape ruggedness upon the evolution of multicellularity in eukaryotic organisms.
Eukaryotic green algae range from single-celled organisms (eg, Chlamydomonas)
to aggregates of a few cells (eg, of the genus Gonium) to fully multicellular organ-
isms with differentiation (eg, Volvox), prompting the suggestion that multicellular-
ity may have evolved from unicellular aggregates (eg, [7]). This is explored within
the NK model and results suggest that genome size, simple differentiation to non-
reproduction, as well as further functional differentiation via epigenetic control can
all affect the evolution of multicellularity. Signiﬁcantly, multicellularity is seen to
emerge across the parameter space of the model, with an undifferentiated scenario,
as might occur in small aggregates, proving most robust before functional differenti-
ation emerges. Such phenomena are considered to be varying the amount of learning
in the Baldwin effect.
The correspondences between multicellular organisms and eusocial colonies have
long been noted [11]: somatic cells are analogous to the non-reproducing individuals.
Indeed, kin-selection [5] has been extrapolated to multicellularity [7]. The ﬁndings
from exploring multicellularity are consider in the context of eusociality with a
number of further similarities identiﬁed based on the Baldwin effect.

Multicellularity in the NK Model
Multicellular organisms are formed by a number of binding mechanisms: in higher
plants, the cells are connected via cytoplasmic bridges and exist within a rigid hon-
eycomb of cellulose chambers; and the cells of most animals are bound together by a
relatively loose meshwork of large extracellular organic molecules (the extracellular

matrix) and with adhesion between their plasma membranes. In all cases the cells
exist as a larger whole during their lifetime. To take this into account within the
sexual diploid NK model described in Chap. 4, the average of the cells’ ﬁtnesses is
assigned to the organism. That is, in the simplest case, a eukaryotic cell is assumed
to divide D times to create D daughter cells. A deterministic mutation rate of 1/N is
applied to each haploid genome of each daughter cell, as under reproduction. The
ﬁtness of the original cell is calculated as before, as is that of each daughter cell,
with the resulting ﬁtness summed and divided by D + 1.
Figure 6.1 shows example behaviour when D = 1 for such simple multicellularity
with and without differentiation to a propagule. That is, in the former case, if the
offspring multicellular organism replaces the parent, the original cell from which the
D daughters were created is subject to the reproduction process of the sexual diploid
model described above. In the latter case, one of the D + 1 cells in the organism is
chosen at random to undergo reproduction.
As can be seen, with N = 20 the undifferentiated multicellular scheme is better
than simple differentiation to a propagule for 0 < K <10 (T-test, p < 0.05). Indeed
there is no beneﬁt from the simple differentiation scheme over remaining a single
cell in such cases (Fig. 4.7, right). No beneﬁt from any form of multicellularity is

found for all K > 6 in comparison to a single cell (T-test, p ≥0.05). For N = 100
the beneﬁt from undifferentiated multicellularity over the propagule scheme is lost
slightly earlier with it proving ﬁtter when 0 < K < 6 (T-test, p < 0.05) and single cells
(Fig. 4.8, left) are ﬁttest thereafter for 6 ≤K ≤15 (T-test, p < 0.05).
The reason for the beneﬁt from simple multicellularity—and hence for the emer-
gence of multicellularity—can be explained by it representing a further source of
learning over the underlying haploid-diploid cycle with meiosis discussed above:
the daughter cells represent extra pairs of haploid genome ﬁtness information. Sim-
ilarity with the explorations of endomitosis in Chap. 4 can be noted here. Chapter 4
demonstratedhowhigheramountsoflearningcanprovebeneﬁcialforK >0,although
that beneﬁt can be lost as either the amount or ruggedness is increased. The simple
differentiated form of multicellularity where only the original mother/propagule cell
reproduces did not prove beneﬁcial: in contrast to the case where either cell may
become the mother cell, too much learning occurs in such cases and the reproducing
haploid genomes are too far displaced from the extra information provided by the
daughter cell for evolution to be successfully guided to the higher ﬁtness regions.
Figure 6.2 shows examples of the effects from varying the number of daughter
cells, where 0 < D ≤10. As can be seen, and as suggested by the results above

Multicellularity
with D = 1, the simple differentiation scheme provides no beneﬁt over a single cell
(D = 0) due to the increased level of learning with increasing D. The undifferentiated
scheme does not beneﬁt further from increasing D, although ﬁtness levels remain
unaffected when 0 < D < 3 with N = 100 and 2 < K < 10 (T-test, p ≥0.05). It can
be noted that, and as predicted by the above, if the daughter cells are produced in
sequence, that is, cell di is produced via the mutation of cell di-1 as opposed to the
mutation of cell d0, ﬁtnesses are signiﬁcantly lower for all D > 1 (not shown).
6.2
Functional Differentiation and Simple Epigenetic
Control
In the above, the daughter cells were not assumed to be functionally differentiated
from the original mother cell—all cells were evaluated on the same ﬁtness landscape.
Most models of multicellularity assume functional differentiation in the daughter(s)
such as improved feeding ability, eg, see [12], and development in general has been
directly linked to the evolution of complexity [1]. Indeed, in contrast to the results
above, it is typically some form of division of labour between the cells that is used to
explain the emergence of multicellularity. The above model has been altered such that
the daughter cells are evaluated on a second (randomly created) NK ﬁtness function
of the same size and ruggedness as the mother cell.
Figure 6.3 shows examples of how undifferentiated multicellularity is beneﬁcial
over simple differentiation to a propagule for 2 < K < 15 with N = 20 (T-test, p
< 0.05). However no signiﬁcant difference in ﬁtness is seen between either form of
multicellularity when N = 100 (not shown).
Epigenetics refers to cellular mechanisms that affect transcription without altering
DNA sequences, with the two principal mechanisms being methylation and histone
modiﬁcation. In the former case, a methyl group attaches to the base cytosine, or

adenine in bacteria, typically causing a reduction in transcription activity in the area.
In the latter case, changes in the shape of the proteins around which DNA wraps itself
to form chromatin can alter the level of transcription in the area. The above model
can be extended to include simple epigenetic control thereby enabling functional
differentiation between the cells.
Similar to the scheme suggested in [10], an extra template of maximum length 2 N
is added to an individual where, in the case of D = 1, each locus can take one of three
values—0, 1, # (Fig. 6.4). The ﬁrst two equate to which cell the pair of genes at the
corresponding locus in the haploid genomes are used and the last is said to indicate a
lack of cell speciﬁcity and hence the two genes are used in both cells, as above. Each
haploid genome is now of variable length N′ in the range [N, 2 N], with D = 1. After
meiosis, the offspring also has the epigenetic control value of one randomly chosen
locus in the template altered to another value or the template length is randomly
increased/decreased by one. In the case of a change of size in the template, the
genome lengths are also adjusted and a new (random) gene added onto the end or
the last gene added is removed from each haploid (i.e., as in Chap. 2). In the case of
ﬁtness ties between the offspring and parent, the shorter genome/template individual
is chosen, with subsequent ties broken at random as before. In this way, there is a
selective bias for the most efﬁcient way to deﬁne D + 1 functionally differentiated
cells. That is, individuals of length N′ = 2 N, with a template of N 0’s and N
1’s, i.e., a complete genome speciﬁcation for each cell type, are discouraged. All
other details remain as before and individuals are initialised without differentiation,
i.e., N′ = N and N#s in the template. Note too few genes for a cell is penalised since
ﬁtness contributions are still divided by N. Conversely, only the ﬁrst N genes are
considered when more are speciﬁed for a given cell.
Figure 6.5 shows how for both N = 20 and N = 100, the epigenetic control
mechanism enables signiﬁcantly improved ﬁtness for K > 0 (T-test, p < 0.05) in
comparison to both forms of multicellularity explored above on the heterogeneous
NK functions (Fig. 6.3). It can also be seen that cell-speciﬁc genes emerge with

N′ > N in all cases, with a slight trend for lower N′ with increasing K. Fitness levels
are not as good as those for the standard single cell case (Fig. 4.7) but that may be
due in part to the simple epigenetic control template mechanism and its variation
used.

Eusociality: Haplodiploid Multicellularity
Eusocial species are found amongst termites, ants, wasps, bees, aphids, mole-rats
and spiders. Wheeler [11] was ﬁrst to highlight the close analogy between a eusocial
colony and a multicellular organism in that both have differentiation into reproduc-
tives and non-reproductive specialists. Hamilton’s [5] kin-selection explains why
(subsocial) eusocial offspring give up their right to reproduce: a daughter has as many
genes in common with its own offspring as its mother’s and hence there is no selective
difference between it raising its children or siblings. As noted above, Maynard-Smith

6.3 Eusociality: Haplodiploid Multicellularity
69
and Szathmary [7, p8] have suggested Hamilton’s theory can be applied to multicel-
lularity, following Wheeler’s insight. That is, kin-selection can also be attributed to
somatic cells. This contrasts with Buss [3] who postulates propagule control of soma
and Michod (eg, [8]) who has highlighted other factors, speciﬁcally cell-cell policing
and germ-line segregation (reducing the potential for soma conﬂict), as being equally
as important. Policing is also thought to have been important in the emergence of
eusocial colonies [4].
The above model can be extended to explore the emergence of a non-reproductive
haploid individual from a diploid. Figure 6.6 shows the case where a daughter is
created as a mutated copy of the ﬁrst (arbitrary) haploid genome from the diploid
produced under meiosis. The mother is assigned the average ﬁtness of itself and
that of its daughter. When the mother and daughter are evaluated on the same ﬁtness
landscape (left column) with N = 20, eusociality is ﬁtter than the simple multicellular
differentiation case of a propagule (Fig. 6.1) when K > 4 (T-test, p < 0.05) and no
different to the undifferentiated scheme apart from being worse when K = 2. When
N = 100, the same is generally true, although eusociality performs the same as the
multicellular undifferentiated scheme, including for K = 2 but is ﬁtter for K = 6

Multicellularity
(T-test, p < 0.05). When the mother and daughter are evaluated on two different
functions (right column), i.e., as in Fig. 6.3, with N = 20, eusocialty is always ﬁtter
than either diploid-diploid multicellular scheme when K > 0 (T-test, p < 0.05) and
the same when N = 100 for all K (T-test, p ≥0.05). Hence the loss of the effects
of the learning within a second diploid, as in multicellularity, reduces the amount of
learning overall in eusociality which appears to result in a more appropriate amount
for some N and K combinations.
Figure 6.7 shows the effects of including the same epigenetic control template as
above into the diploid-haploid eusocial scheme as a form of morphological differenti-
ation in the colony members. As with multicellularity, ﬁtnesses are always improved
over the non-epigenetic case (Fig. 6.6, right column) when K > 0 (T-test, p < 0.05).
Such epigenetic/differentiated eusociality is ﬁtter than epigenetic multicellularity
when K > 0 with N = 20 and when 0 < K < 6 with N = 100.

Discussion
This chapter has considered the effects of ﬁtness landscape ruggedness on the evo-
lution of multicellularity in sexual diploids. Using versions of the NK model it
has been shown that simple forms of multicellularity can emerge over a signiﬁcant
range of amounts of landscape ruggedness due their further exploiting the Baldwin
effect beyond that inherent to the haploid-diploid cycle with meiosis. In particular,
the more basic form under which either/any cell in the organism may become the
propagule was found to be more widely beneﬁcial. That multicellularity may have
emerged through the exploitation of a form of Baldwin effect has been suggested
previously, although asexual haploid cells/organisms were assumed in the models
[2]. Whilst some bacteria aggregate together to avoid starvation or predation (eg, see
[6]), multicellularity is a common eukaryotic phenomenon. The results here suggest
the reason why this is: bacteria do not typically exist on sufﬁciently rugged ﬁtness
landscapes to beneﬁt from the Baldwin effect. In Chap. 3 the presence of mitochon-
dria in eukaryotes was suggested as causing an increase in the ruggedness of their
ﬁtness landscapes.
The form of multicellularity and the number of daughter cells produced has been
shown to vary the amount of learning occurring during evolution, where it was
shown how the amount which is beneﬁcial depends upon the ﬁtness landscape size
and ruggedness. The simplicity of the model requires mutational differences between
genomes in the mother and daughter cell(s) whereas other cellular processes, such
as gene product extracellular concentrations, could be tuned through varying the
number of cells to similar effect.
Moreover, as with the other sources of innovation considered in this book, no
explicit cost for multicellularity was included—but improved ﬁtness was found.
Hence if the cost is less than the beneﬁt, multicellularity can be expected emerge.
Thereafter functional differentiation can open new niches where competition does
not exist; simple epigenetic control has been explored and shown widely beneﬁcial.
Eusociality has emerged in the Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps, etc.) multiple
times and it is their haplodiploidy that has been the major factor in this (after [5]).
The results in this chapter suggest that the Baldwin effect was also signiﬁcant to
the emergence of eusociality—for the same reasons as for multicellularity (after
[2]). In particular, this is supported by the fact that the oldest eusocial organisms
are the termites which are diploid and so are more similar to the multicellular case.
It has been shown that haploid daughters are similarly beneﬁcial to diploid-diploid
schemes on rugged ﬁtness landscapes, particularly when simple differentiation to a
propagule exists. This can again be explained by the amount of learning occurring
beyond that inherent to the sexual diploids. Following the approach in Chap. 4 of
considering the haploid genome ﬁtness landscape of primary importance, as opposed
to that of the diploid, the daughters under haplodiploidy can be viewed as not using
the rudimentary learning process for the genes contained in the diploid mother. That
is, the mothers contain two haploid genomes and the ﬁtness contribution of the
genes therein will be some combination of the two, eg, their average was used above.

72
6
Multicellularity
In contrast, in the daughter the ﬁtness contribution of the genes is simply as in the
haploid case, i.e., without the potential for any learning since they are not paired with
another set of corresponding genes. Thus a daughter can be seen as a mechanism
through which the learning experienced in the region of the haploid genome ﬁtness
landscape covered by the genes contained in her genome is removed; a daughter
provides additional “raw” haploid ﬁtness contribution information to the mother.
Similar reasoning was used to explain the emergence of X0 (Z0) sex chromosomes
in eukaryotes in Chap. 5.
Eusociality was found to be most beneﬁcial in the cases without epige-
netic/morphology control when the mother and daughter exist on different ﬁtness
landscapes with smaller genomes. When simple differentiation control was added it
also became most beneﬁcial for larger ﬁtness landscapes under some conditions. In
all cases, the conditions for the emergence of more complex organisms can again
be seen to exist across the parameter space of the model via the use of the Baldwin
effect to smooth the underlying rugged ﬁtness landscape.

Conclusion
[T]here is no reason why evolution by natural selection should lead to an increase in com-
plexity … an increase in immediate ‘ﬁtness’ – that is, expected number of offspring – may
be achieved by losing eyes or legs as well as by gaining them. [2, p. 4]
Whilst there is no clear correlation, complex organisms typically contain more
DNA than simple organisms—whether it is in the genome, due to multiple genomes
in a cell, due to the presence of symbiotic organelles, or due to the number of cells.
Henceitisanindicativemeasureoforganismalcomplexity,althoughothershavebeen
proposed (eg, see [1] for discussions). The conditions under which such increases
in DNA might emerge during evolution have been explored using simple ﬁtness
landscape models here. These models can perhaps be seen as a method by which to
attempt to explain biology whilst removing as much detail of the biology as possible,
and thereby potentially missing key elements. For example, although touched upon
for symbiogenesis, that an increase in complexity may subsequently create the oppor-
tunity for conﬂict has not been explored. However, such abstract ﬁtness landscapes
enable the consideration of evolution purely as a stochastic process being fed inno-
vations due to (often almost unavoidable) things like copy errors, joining/separation
events, etc. as it searches through a multidimensional space containing peaks and
troughs. The ﬁndings here show how the ruggedness and movement/change within
ﬁtness landscapes can be used to explain the emergence of key complexity increasing
events.
Chapter 2 showed how the adoption of new DNA with random functionality is
seen across the parameter space as evolution searches over rugged ﬁtness landscapes
of all types, particularly in the early stages of adaptation, eg, after an environmental
change has moved the relative position of optima. Thus such simple increases in
complexity appear to be an inherent feature of evolution. It can also be noted that
reductions in complexity were seen in response to change under some conditions.
Chapter 3 showed how the bringing together of genomes from separate lineages
is almost always beneﬁcial if those organisms interact sufﬁcient closely in their
environments, particularly as the genome length of those organisms increases. Thus

Conclusion
increases in ruggedness and complexity through the formation of close symbiotic
relationships again appears to be an inherent feature of evolution. Note the correla-
tion with ﬁndings in Chap. 2: the close interactions cause movement in the ﬁtness
landscapes of the partners which can encourage increases in genome length. But it
must be noted that the seemingly long delay between the emergence of the ﬁrst cell
and the ﬁrst eukaryotic cell suggests that the probability of that particular innovation
was low in natural evolution.
Chapter 4 showed how doubling the number of genomes in a cell to form a diploid
is increasingly beneﬁcial as the ruggedness of the ﬁtness landscape increases, with
tetraploidy similarly typically beneﬁcial under some conditions. Note the correla-
tion with ﬁndings in Chap. 3 where ruggedness is increased: sexual diploids have
endosymbiotic organelles. A simple form of the Baldwin effect is suggested as caus-
ingthisbeneﬁt.Moreover,atwo-stepmeiosiswithrecombinationinahaploid-diploid
lifecycle appears beneﬁcial over both syngamy and endomitosis as ﬁtness landscape
ruggedness increases. Hence sex appears to be a consequence of this increase in
complexity. And it was suggested that through sex evolution exploits a form of
generalization in eukaryotes.
Chapter 5 showed how less complex organisms will increase the number of (func-
tionallyhomogeneous)chromosomesinacell.Thusthepotentialforfuturefunctional
divergence/novelty increases. It was also shown how the emergence of two mating
types through an example of such chromosome duplicate divergence is beneﬁcial for
less complex organisms as ﬁtness landscape ruggedness increases. Note the correla-
tion with ﬁndings in Chap. 4: the conditions for the emergence of sex are typically
those where mating types emerge.
Finally, Chap. 6 showed how multicellular organisms of just a few cells are either
beneﬁcial or selectively neutral on all but the most or least rugged ﬁtness land-
scapes. Again, a simple form of the Baldwin effect is suggested as the underlying
cause of the beneﬁt. Since this is the case with or without differentiation to a non-
reproducing propagule, simple multicellularity appears very likely—even before the
beneﬁts of full functional differentiation are realised. Note the correlation with ﬁnd-
ings in Chap. 4: sexual diploids exist on ﬁtness landscapes suitable to exploit such
simple multicellularity.
With the caveats expressed above, the ﬁndings here suggest that from a purely
evolution-as-search-process view, that the complexity of life has been increasing
over the last 3.8 billion years is far from surprising due to inherent properties of the

Appendix
Regulation
The simple NK and NKCS models used throughout this book can be extended such
that particular aspects of gene regulation, which might be enabled by an increase in
the amount of DNA in an organism, can be explored in more detail. This appendix
provides an example.
A.1
The RBN and RBNK Models
Random Boolean networks (RBN) [7] were introduced as an abstract model by
which to explore aspects of genetic regulatory networks. RBN consist of R genetic
loci/nodes, each connected to B other randomly chosen nodes, with each performing
a randomly assigned Boolean update function based upon the current state of those
nodes per update cycle (Fig. A.1). Hence those B nodes are seen to have a regulatory
effect upon the given node; the details of transcription are abstracted out.
Since they have a ﬁnite number of possible states and they are deterministic,
such networks eventually fall into an attractor. It is well-established that the value
of B affects the emergent behaviour of RBN wherein attractors typically contain
an increasing number of states with increasing B. Three phases of behaviour were
originally suggested through observation: ordered when B = 1, with attractors con-
sisting of one or a few states; chaotic when B ≥3, with a very large number of
states per attractor; and, a critical regime around B = 2, where similar states lie
on trajectories that tend to neither diverge nor converge (see [8] for discussions of
this critical regime, e.g., with respect to perturbations). Subsequent formal analysis
using an annealed approximation of behaviour identiﬁed B = 2 as the critical value
of connectivity for behaviour change [5]. Example behaviour is shown in Fig. A.2.

With the aim of enabling systematic exploration of the evolvability of such GRN,
RBN have been combined with the NK model of ﬁtness landscapes. In the combined
form—termed the RBNK model [1]—a simple relationship between the states of N
randomly assigned nodes within an RBN is assumed such that their value is used
within a given NK ﬁtness landscape of trait dependencies. Hence the NK element
creates a tuneable component to the overall ﬁtness landscape with behaviour (poten-
tially) inﬂuenced by the environment though Ni inputs to other nodes (Fig. A.3).
Moreover, the conditions under which speciﬁc regulatory functions may emerge can
be explored.

Fig. A.3 The combined RBN and NK modelNK model—the RBNK modelRBNK model
Gene regulatory network complexity is known to have increased over time, e.g.,
as the driver of metazoan morphological complexity [4]. The RBNK model enables
the systematic examination of speciﬁc regulatory mechanisms—in a similar way to
the NK model is used above—through which such complexity has occurred, such
as the role of RNA editing. RNA editing is the alteration of the sequence of RNA
molecules through a variety of mechanisms after initial expression (see [9] for an
overview). In some cases such editing is triggered by speciﬁc conditions, in others
it is necessary for the normal function of a cell. RNA editing is a widespread form
of regulatory control and appears to have evolved many times (e.g., see [6]). For
example, guide RNA (gRNA) are relatively small molecules that align themselves
to complementary regions of messenger RNA (mRNA) and either insert or delete
a base(s) thereby (typically) altering the structure of the protein speciﬁed in the
expressed DNA. In this appendix, RBNs are extended to include a simple form of
RNA editing [3]. The selection of the extra mechanism is explored under various
scenarios, drawing upon the ﬁndings of the chapters above regarding the conditions
under which the pre-requisite increase in genome length may occur.
A.2
gRNA in the RBNK Model
To include a mechanism which enables the modiﬁcation of transcription based upon
the internal and/or external environment of the cell, nodes in the RBN can (poten-
tially) include a second set of B′ connections to deﬁned nodes and another Boolean
update function. Each such node also maintains a table containing a list of node
id’s for each entry in the Boolean table for the B′ connections where the node is
on/expressed. The list is the same size as the out-degree of the node (range [0, R*B]).

78
Appendix: Regulation
Fig. A.4 Example RBN with RNA editingRNA editing. The look-up table and connections for
node 3 only are shown for clarity. If every node in the RBN is in state ‘0’ at time ‘t’, node 3 will
turn on for the next time step, as will its associated gRNA. As a consequence, nodes 1 and 4 will
be connected to node 3 for time step t + 1 for their updating
This is seen as introducing a non-coding RNA associated with the protein expressed
by the given node. RNA editing causes a change in the connectivity of the RBN
which lasts for one update cycle.
On each traditional RBN update cycle, the connectivity of the network is initially
assumed (reset) to be that originally determined by evolution. Then, for each node
which has an associated guide RNA, a check is made to see if the node’s transcription
state was set to on (‘1’) on the last update step and if its associated RNA has been
activated (‘1’) since the last time this occurred. If so, the out-connections for that
node are altered to those in the corresponding table entry for the current state of
the B’ connection nodes (Fig. A.4). If a node subsequently has fewer than B input
connections, the missing gene(s) is simply assumed to not be expressed on that
cycle, i.e., the gene on the end of the connection is assumed to be set to 0. If a node
subsequently has more than B connections, the “extra” input is randomly assigned
to one of the existing B connections and a logical OR function is used to determine
whether that connection is considered to be to an expressed gene. Thereafter each
node updates its transcription state based upon the current state of the nodes it is
(currently) connected to using the Boolean logic function assigned to it in the standard
way, as do any associated non-coding RNA node elements. For simplicity, the number

Appendix: Regulation
79
of standard regulatory connections is assumed to be the same as for RNA editing,
i.e., B = B′.
A converged population of asexual haploids is assumed here, as above Each RBN
is represented as a list to deﬁne each node’s start state, Boolean function for tran-
scription, B connection ids, B’ connection ids, Boolean function for RNA editing,
re-connectivity entries under RNA editing, and whether it is an RNA edited node or
not. Mutation can therefore either (with equal probability): alter the Boolean tran-
scription function of a randomly chosen node; alter a randomly chosen B connection;
alter a node start state; turn a node into or out of being RNA editable; alter one of the
re-connection entries if it is an editable node; or, alter a randomly chosen B’ connec-
tion, again only if it is an editable node. A single ﬁtness evaluation of a given GRN
is ascertained by updating each node for 100 cycles from the genome deﬁned start
states. An input string of Ni 0’s is applied on every cycle here. At each update cycle,
the value of each of the N trait nodes in the GRN is used to calculate ﬁtness on the
given NK landscape. The ﬁnal ﬁtness assigned to the GRN is the average over 100
such updates here. A mutated GRN becomes the parent for the next generation if its
ﬁtness is higher than that of the original. In the case of ﬁtness ties the number of RNA
editable nodes is considered, with the smaller number favoured, the decision being
arbitrary upon a further tie. Hence there is a slight selective pressure againstRNA
editing. Here R = 100, N = 10 and results are averaged over 100 runs—10 runs on
each of 10 landscapes per parameter conﬁguration—for 50,000 generations, 0 < B
≤5 and 0 ≤K ≤5 are used. As Fig. A.5 (left column) shows, regardless of K, RNA
editing is selected for in all high connectivity cases on average, i.e., when B > 3,
when the underlying ﬁtness landscape is unchanging. Analysis of the behaviour of
the editing in such cases indicates that it is applied throughout the lifecycle, although
a clear a pattern of usage is typically difﬁcult to establish, often with varying numbers
of nodes exhibiting editing per cycle.
Sinceitisknownsuchhighlyconnectednetworkstypicallyexhibitchaoticdynam-
ics and they are subsequently difﬁcult to evolve [1], it might be surmised that the RNA
editing is not performing a functional role, rather it is maintained under drift/neutral
processes. As noted above, RNA editing alters the out-connections of a given node
and hence a potential consequence is the alteration in the number of connections
into a given node. In particular, given the seemingly positive selection of editing in
the high B cases in Fig. A.5 it might be assumed that the mechanism’s ability to
effectively reduce a node’s B is all that is being selected for since ﬁtness drops with
increasing B. Experiments (not shown) in which the out-connection table entries are
randomly re-created in the offspring indicate a signiﬁcant (T-test, p < 0.05) drop in
ﬁtness in all cases where editing is selected for and hence evolution does appear to
be shaping suitable, dynamic behaviour through the editing mechanism. Although
some editing nodes are also almost certainly there due to drift/neutral processes.
Figure A.5 (right column) shows how RNA editing is selected for under all condi-
tions when the underlying ﬁtness landscape changes halfway through the lifecycle;
an input of all 1’s is applied from update cycle 50 and ﬁtness contributions are calcu-
lated over a second NK landscape. Analysis of typical behaviour in the low B cases
shows that one or two nodes use editing either up to or after the point of change. That

is, the editing is used to make small changes to the network topology to compensate
for the disruption in the environment; the RNA editing has an active (context sen-
sitive) role in the cyclic behaviour of the networks. These general results were also
found for other values of R, e.g., R = 200 (not shown). Thus the ﬁndings in Chap. 2
that changes in the position of optima within a ﬁtness landscapes, in particular, pro-
motes the evolution of larger genomes can be seen to correlate with this ﬁnding:
non-stationarity promotes growth and alterations in regulatory control.
A.3
gRNA in the RBNKCS Model
Chapter 3 introduced a form the NK model which explicitly considers the effects of
one species upon the others with which it has close environmental connections—the
NKCS model of coupled ﬁtness landscapes. The RBNK model is easily extended
to consider the interaction between multiple GRN based on the NKCS model—the
RBNKCS model. As Fig. A.6 shows, it is here assumed that the current state of the
N trait nodes of one network provide input to a set of N internal nodes in each of
its coupled partners, i.e., each serving as one of their B connections. Similarly, the
ﬁtness contribution of the N trait nodes considers not only the K local connections
Fig. A.6 Example RBNKCS model. Connections for only one of the coupled networks shown for
clarity

82
Appendix: Regulation
but also the C connections to its S coupled partners’ trait nodes. The GRN update
alternately.
The case of two coevolving GRN has been explored using the RBNKCS model,
each evolved separately on their own NKCS ﬁtness landscape for their N external
traits. Each network updates in turn for 100 cycles. The ﬁtness of one network is
then ascertained and an evolutionary generation for that network is undertaken. The
mutated network is evaluated with the same partner as the original and it becomes
the parent under the same criteria as used above. Then the second species network is
evaluated with that network, before a mutated form is created and evaluated against
thesamepartner.Onegenerationissaidtohaveoccurredwhenallfourstepshavebeen
undertaken. Only the ﬁtness of the species with the potential to exploit RNA editing
is shown here. This general scenario is potentially of interest given the proposed role
of RNA editing by cells against viruses, for example.
Figure A.7 shows how for a low degree of coupling between the two species/cells,
i.e., C = 1, as before, low B networks result in higher ﬁtness levels. However, regard-
less of K, the percentage of nodes using RNA editing increases with B. For B = 1 edit-
ing is not selected for on average. Recall that such networks typically exhibit a point
or small attractor, and hence the coupled GRNs exist in relatively static/unchanging
environments. For B > 3 the majority of nodes use RNA editing (>60%) but the
ﬁtness levels reached are relatively low. As above, the same experiments have been
run in which the RNA editing details are randomly scrambled in offspring. Results
(not shown) indicate similar high percentages of RNA editing nodes but no signiﬁ-
cant change in ﬁtness (T-test, p ≥0.05) and hence the uptake is due to drift/neutral
processes within such poorly evolving systems. The exact ways in which the editing
is used in the low B cases is hard to establish. Figure A.7 also shows how the same
general trends occur for higher levels of coupling between the two, i.e., C = 5. It can
be noted that some level of RNA editing is now seen when B = 1.
Analysis of how the percentage of RNA editing nodes varies over time ﬁnds rela-
tively stable behaviour in the RBNK model (not shown). Figure A.8 shows example
runs of how this is not the case in the RBNKCS model, rather the percentage varies
over time. Indeed, it appears there is a rough correlation between periods of coevo-
lutionary stasis with regards to ﬁtness and a decrease in the percentage of RNA
editing nodes, and vice versa, for lower values of C. Similar temporal dynamics
were reported when the model was used to explore the effects of transposons [2].
A.4
gRNA in the RBNK and RBNKCS Models with Sexual
Diploids
Following the ﬁndings in Chaps. 4–6, sexual diploid versions of the RBN model can
be introduced. That is, an individual consists of two RBN which are each evaluated
as above and their ﬁtnesses averaged, with evolution exploiting two-step meiosis
under a haploid-diploid process as described in Chap. 4. Results ﬁnd the expected

increase in ﬁtness over the asexual haploid case above for K > 0 (T-test, p < 0.05) but
no signiﬁcant difference in the percentages of RNA editing nodes found to emerge
(T-test, p ≥0.05) in both the stationary and non-stationary cases (not shown).
Figure A.9 shows examples from the coevolutionary case where a sexual diploid
is paired with an asexual haploid without the RNA mechanism, i.e., as in Fig. A.7.

As can be seen, ﬁtnesses are again improved (for K > 0) and the percentages of RNA
editing nodes are similar to the asexual haploid case (Fig. A.7), although signiﬁcantly
less editing is typically seen for B = 4 with low C (T-test, p < 0.05).
