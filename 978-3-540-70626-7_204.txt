According to quantum mechanics, spin—the intrinsic angular momentum of an
electron, nucleus, or elementary particle at rest—is a decidedly nonclassical con-
cept. The  spin statistics theorem of  quantum statistics distinguishes bosons
and fermions obeying  Bose–Einstein statistics or  Fermi–Dirac statistics, re-
spectively, depending on whether the particle’s spin is an even or odd multiple
of ¯h/2, with ¯h = h/2π (h being  Planck’s constant). The convoluted history
of the concept of spin nevertheless reaches back into the ﬁnal  crisis period of
the old  quantum theory, linked to the semi-classical  atomic model by Niels
Bohr (1885–1962), Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–1951) and their collaborators (the
 Sommerfeld school).
In the early 1920s, precise experimental data from  spectroscopy, particu-
larly regarding the anomalous  Zeeman effect, forced researchers to deviate
from the rule imposed by the Bohr–Sommerfeld atomic model that all  quan-
tum numbers must be integers. Experiments by Miguel A. Catal´an (1894–1957)
made evident that many spectrum lines were ﬁnely split by magnetic ﬁelds into
so-called multiplets with 2l + 1 equidistant components, l being the azimuthal
quantum number. These multiplets were thus described by a new magnetic quan-
tum number m, and the rule |m| ⩽l stating that permissible states have to be
between +m, m −1, m −2 . . .0, −1, −2 . . . and −m. This yields 2m + 1 differ-
ent states, a perfect ﬁt with the observed (2m + 1)-multiplet. Semi-classically, m
could be interpreted as the component of l in the direction of the exterior magnetic
ﬁeld (both in units of h/2π), so the orientation of the electron orbits relative to the
magnetic ﬁeld was space quantized—only a few discrete orientations were permit-
ted. Likewise, transitions between states had to be restricted to m = ±1, 0 by
a superimposed  selection rule. What about doublet lines with only two visible
components? Applying the standard multiplet rule would lead directly to l = 1/2,
implying m = ±1/2, hence half-integer quantum numbers. Alfred Land´e (1888–
1976) was the ﬁrst to dare to operate with half-integer  quantum numbers in search
of an explanation for doublets in alkali spectra and other anomalies in the  Zeeman
effect [see 14, 15].
But how to interpret these strange half-integral quantum numbers? In 1922, the
young Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976), then still in the clutches of the  Som-
merfeld school in Munich, speculated that this half-integer value would result from
a time-average over an integer multiple of a quantized angular momentum, con-
tributing 50% to the outer shell and 50% to the atomic core [1]. Heisenberg &
Sommerfeld [2] also tried to explain the anomalous Zeeman effect in terms of a
magnetic interaction of the outermost bound electron (the so-called Leuchtelektron)
with the magnetic momentum of the stronger-bound electrons closer to the atomic
core (the Rumpfelektronen). However, this model would lead one to expect a strong

correlation between  Land´e’s g factors and the atomic charge number Z of the
respective element, which was at odds with observation.
Another young student of Sommerfeld, Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958), devised a
different, equally bold approach to explain such doublet structures. Pauli [3] con-
cluded that the “Rumpf”-electrons of the closed shell should have no effective
angular momentum at all. Instead, he imposed a mysterious “mechanically inde-
scribable ambiguity” on the outermost electron (“a characteristic ambiguity of the
“Leuchtelektron” not describable by classical theory”) as a hypothetical alternative
explanation to the doublet structure. This ambiguity also led to two possible orien-
tations for the outermost electron relative to the external magnetic ﬁeld. This in turn
yielded the doublet splitting of alkali spectra and similar atoms.
In January 1925 Pauli ﬁrst expressed this mechanically indescribable ambiguity
as a new quantum number μ = ±1/2 (for doublets), and Δμ = 0 or ±1 as a new
 selection rule. Each electron was thus described by a set of four  quantum
numbers n, l, m and μ (sometimes alternatively called n, l, j and s). The elec-
tron conﬁguration of each atom was constructed of shells, starting from the lowest
possible energy level. Pauli’s new constraint imposed on the shell structure that no
two electrons of an atom have all the four quantum numbers in common: the Pauli
principle (or  exclusion principle):
“There can never be two or more equivalent electrons in the atom in which the values of all
[four] quantum numbers. . . concur within a strong ﬁeld. . . If in the atom there is an electron
for which these quantum numbers. . . have speciﬁc values, then this state is occupied.” [4,
p. 776; cf. 17]
In this way Pauli succeeded in deriving the usual period lengths of 2, 8, 18,
32,... from the periodic table. The arrangement of the periodic system of the ele-
ments thus seemed to make a little more sense again, at least as far as the main
groups were concerned. But it came at the cost of a “classically indescribable kind of
ambiguity”; and Pauli’s prohibition of any duplication among the quantum numbers
occupying a given state, was no better justiﬁable according to classical theory and
only understood within the context of the  Fermi–Dirac statistics of later  quan-
tum mechanics.
So we are already very close to the discovery of electron spin, and yet still so far
away. Pauli refused to address the problem of how this ambiguity would be com-
prehended within the classical model (e.g., as an intrinsic angular momentum): He
argued that this feature was “classically indescribable” because the electron’s rota-
tional velocity around its own axis was too large (according to Pauli it was greater
than c). Instead Pauli, godchild of the positivist Ernst Mach, held a very instrumen-
talistic conception—he just introduced one more model into the discussion that he
himself did not quite believe in:
“It scarcely needs emphasis that further development of the theory must show to what extent
such a conception hits the mark and whether it can be elaborated further. This interpretation
faces major obstacles, particularly with regard to its natural connection with the correspon-
dence principle. Furthermore, there is surely much correct about the conventional view,
which reﬂects certain features of the phenomena better than the one tentatively suggested

here. In a following note it will be shown, on the other hand, however, that the latter inter-
pretation proves to be more physically useful in describing other aspects of the phenomena.
Perhaps the ﬁnal solution to the problems set forth here will lie in the direction of a middle
road between these two interpretations.” [5, correspondence, early 1925]
The constantly growing set of quantum numbers and phenomenologically deter-
mined criteria like Sommerfeld’s  selection rules and  Land´e’s g-factors led
to acceptable agreement between theory and experiment. Nevertheless it left an
unpleasant aftertaste of mere ad hoc description without any deeper understand-
ing of the reasons behind all these rules. Physicists described their predicament
humorously as “term zoology” and “Zeeman botany”. Sommerfeld spoke of “num-
ber mysteries”; Runge ironically referred to “witches times-tables of quantum
physics”.
But not everyone thought like Pauli. In early 1925, Ralph de L. Kronig (1904–
1995) concluded from a letter by Pauli that the electron must have an intrinsic
angular momentum in order to explain the peculiar ambiguity not describable ac-
cording to classical conceptions. Pauli repudiated this idea off-hand on the following
arguments:
1. A factor 2 was missing between the calculated doublet splitting and observational
data.
2. The magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus was too small.
3. The rotation velocity of such a spinning electron was incredibly high. Calculated
on the basis of classical assumptions, it yielded superluminal velocities along the
electron’s periphery  superluminal communication.
Completely unaware of this exchange which prevented Kronig from pursuing
this idea further, two young postdocs in Leyden, George Eugene Uhlenbeck (1900–
1988) and Samuel Abraham Goudsmit (1902–1978), took as an explanation of the
anomalous Zeeman effect the assumption that
(1) Each individual electron bears a magnetic moment M that can be generated
from an intrinsic rotation with angular momentum (spin S)
M = 2 ·
e
2mcS
(2) Quantitatively, this magnetic moment is twice the amount expected in a naive
semi-classical model
Thus the magnetic and mechanical moment should differ by a factor 2 from the
value valid for an atomic system with a point charge of e/2mc, that is, the quotient
of the Bohr magneton. The resulting fact that the total angular momentum of J and
μ (total magnetic moment) were not parallel explained why the distances between
various magnetic levels in the anomalous Zeeman effect differed in size depending
on the term ( vector model) (Fig. 1).

The consideration by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit in the summer of 1925 was basi-
cally very simple. Pauli had already noticed in 1924/25 that there are four quantum
numbers; but within a semi-classical framework, for a single electron, this could
only mean:
4 degrees of freedom = 3 translational degrees + 1 internal degree of freedom
For a point-like or extremely small particle this in turn pointed to an intrinsic
rotation!
The ﬁrst reaction to the paper by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit on record was by
Hendrik A. Lorentz (1853–1928). In a letter from Oct. 19, 1925 he noticed (as Pauli
had with respect to Kronig’s earlier proposal) that there were problems with the
rotational velocity ν of such a spinning electron, because

which led to ν ∼10 · c, or approximately ten times the velocity of light, which is
physically impossible. But the brief note by the two Dutch physicists had already
been irretrievably submitted to Die Naturwissenschaften. In reply to their worried

request for advice, their mentor Paul Ehrenfest (1880–1933) consoled them with the
words: “You are both young enough to afford a stupidity like that.” [9,10, 11]
So the bold hypothesis of an electron spin found its way into print even though
no one dared to believe it at that point. The remaining quantitative problem with the
missing factor 2 for the doublet separation (which Pauli had already pointed out to
Kronig) was only clariﬁed in early 1926. Lewellyn Hilleth Thomas (1903–1992)
explained it as arising from a missed Lorentz transformation from the spinning
electron’s frame of reference against the laboratory system. By that time, the ‘old’
semi-classical quantum theory by Bohr, Sommerfeld and their pupils had already
been replaced by the modern quantum mechanics of Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger,
which led to a much deeper—nonclassical—understanding of spin from the sym-
metries and statistics of the quantum systems.
Although spin was thus ﬁrst ‘discovered’ at the end of 1925 and only acknowl-
edged by the scientiﬁc community in 1926, that is, after the developmentof quantum
mechanics, it was nevertheless a product of the old semi-classical style of model-
ing that still took angular momentum, orbits and mechanical models seriously. The
Pauli principle and spin remain integral parts of the new quantum mechanics but
their historical roots lay in the old Bohr-Sommerfeld form of quantum theory. Like
the  electron, the concept of spin thus also had a pretty complicated early ‘biog-
raphy’ [20], but it is still very much alive today. See also  partity; quantum ﬁeld
theory; spin echo.

Spin Echo
Antoine Weis
Spin echo is a technique, introduced in 1950 by Erwin Hahn, for suppressing
inhomogeneous line broadening effects in  magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The
width of a magnetic resonance line (in the low rf power limit ω2
1 ≪γ1γ2) is deter-
mined by the transverse relaxation time T2 = 1/γ2 (cf (3) of  magnetic resonance).
An inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B0 produces an inhomogeneously broadened line
which can be understood as the superposition of many lines with narrow widths γ2.
The spin echo technique overcomes the loss of spectral resolution due to the inho-
mogeneous broadening.
Consider a system of N spins, initially aligned along z. At time t = 0 the spins
are tipped by a π/2-pulse to the y direction, and the (inhomogeneous) magnetic ﬁeld
B0 = B0(x, y)
⌢z drives their precession in the x–y plane. Because of the ﬁeld inho-
mogeneity B, the different spins precess at different angular frequencies (Fig. 1),
and the macroscopic transverse polarization components Px,y =

because of the collective dephasing (Fig. 2, left).
Although the ensemble averaged polarization vanishes for times larger than the
inhomogeneous dephasing time T ∗
2 ∝1/B, the phase memory of the individual
spins will survive for a longer time T2 ≫T ∗
2 and the spins can be made to rephase
following the application of a π-pulse at time t = T after the initial π/2-pulse that
started the dephasing. Such a pulse rotates all the spin vectors by 180◦around
the x-axis, which, for spins in the x–y plane, is equivalent to a reversal of their
