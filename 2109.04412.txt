Abstract
A corollary to the Reeh-Schlieder theorem is proved: that the time-ordered Vacuum Expectation Values and the S-
matrix of a regularized Lagrangian quantum theory can be approximated by a local operator that uses nonlinear func-
tionals of a locally supported source function. For the Wightman axioms, this suggests a modiﬁcation that takes the
algebra of measurement operators not to be generated by an operator-valued distribution. The use of operator-valued
nonlinear functionals of a source function introduces many abstract fragments of the source to give a well-deﬁned
top-down construction of interacting quantum ﬁelds, in contrast to a bottom-up blocking and scaling construction
or to analyzing response to changing renormalization scales. The construction can also be thought of as solving a
localized inverse problem for the interacting dynamics or as a generating function for multi-point bound state ﬁelds.

1. Introduction
Renormalization is a major diﬃculty in our understanding of interacting quantum ﬁelds, in part because it cre-
ates an apparently unbridgeable gap between physicists’ practice and mathematically axiomatic approaches. For
the Wightman axioms and for the Haag-Kastler axioms, for example, there are no interacting models known in 3+1
dimensions[1, p. 8ﬀ]. We will here implement a reverse variant of Kadanoﬀ’s nonlinear process of blocking spin oper-
ators to give spin operators that are associated with a larger region of space-time, followed by a rescaling process[2].
Instead, source functions will be locally but nonlinearly transformed and separated into possibly overlapping frag-
ments that will be used to construct new operators.
Section 2 begins with a very brief summary of a generating functional approach to Lagrangian quantum ﬁeld
theory, followed by an argument in favor of nonlinearity that explicitly includes a speciﬁcation of the blocking and
scaling that is required for regularization and renormalization (Appendix B gives an auxiliary real-space argument.)
Section 3 proves a corollary to the Reeh-Schlieder theorem that allows a top-down fragmentation approach to be
taken seriously and begins a consideration of a moderately general ansatz that is continued in Section 4 and discussed
in more general terms in Section 7. Section 6 notes that the introduction of nonlinearity suggests a convex hull
modiﬁcation of microcausality.
We will work in a manifestly Poincaré invariant setting of the Wightman axioms on an underlying Minkowski
space M, in which free scalar quantum ﬁelds are operator-valued distributions, ˆφ(x), with free quantum ﬁeld operators
constructed by linearly smearing ˆφ(x) with sources, ˆφ j =
R
M ˆφ(x) j(x)d4x, for which see Appendix A and [3, Ch. II].
In mathematical physics literature such as [3], what are here called sources are usually called, more abstractly, test
functions. In a previous article[4], I have more concretely called them sampling functions or window functions, by
analogy with a similar idea in signal analysis, or modulation functions, insofar as ˆφ j|0⟩is a multiplicative modulation
of the vacuum vector |0⟩. The broad motivation adopted here is that the empirical evidence for quantum ﬁeld theory
comes to us as signals out of many experimental apparatuses, so that it is helpful to think of quantum ﬁeld theory
as an idealized signal analysis formalism in the presence of diﬀerent kinds of noise and using noncommutativity to
model intervention contexts systematically as a path towards causal modeling[5]; a particle property interpretation of

events that are identiﬁed on signal lines by hardware and software is countenanced only when the signal analysis of
experimental data in terms of particle properties is suﬃciently unambiguous.
The central idea of this article is that an analysis of renormalization gives us good reason to take quantum ﬁeld
operators ˆφ j to be nonlinear functionals of the source functions (which for window functions or modulation functions
in signal analysis would be a natural starting point, with linearity only adopted as an approximation), so that in
general we do not work with operator-valued distributions. A well-controlled space of source functions allows us
to use powers of source functions in a well-deﬁned way straightforwardly, whereas using powers of operator-valued
distributions requires signiﬁcantly more elaborate mathematics. Section 5 presents an axiomatic perspective that is
grounded in that nonlinearity.
2. An argument in favor of nonlinearity
A textbook use of a source ﬁeld constructs Z[ j] as a generating functional[6, §6-1-1] for time-ordered Vacuum

We write ˆZj = T

eiˆξ ji
as a time-ordered generating operator, for which Z[ j] = ⟨0| ˆZj|0⟩. For the interacting quantum
ﬁeld operator ˆZj, Z[ j] = ⟨0| ˆZ j|0⟩is enough by itself to construct the S-matrix, however Z[ j] is not enough to ﬁx the
noncommutative algebraic structure of the *-algebra that is generated by multiple copies of the ˆZj and the vacuum
state, ⟨0| ˆZj1 · · · ˆZjn|0⟩, which should be expected to be signiﬁcant when not working only in the asymptotic S-matrix
regime.
The notation above omits the regularization and renormalization scheme that has to be used in any attempt to
construct a Poincaré invariant interacting quantum ﬁeld theory. We will adopt a generalization of a Kadanoﬀ-type
approach of layers of blocking and scaling, so we explicitly include a speciﬁcation of all the interaction parameters,
blocking, and scaling that will be used, λ, B, and S,
Z[ j] = ⟨0| ˆZj|0⟩=

which we take not to be a Poincaré invariant construction in general, but we will adopt the usual hope and intention
that by taking an appropriate limit, λ→λc, B→Bc, S→Sc, we will obtain a Poincaré invariant construction. The
values used for λ, B, and S typically depend on what energies are probed by the measurements being performed,
which in principle is determined by the source function j, so more completely we would write λ[ j], B[ j], and S[ j].
Hollowood[7, §1.2] presents renormalization group ﬂow in a way that is well-suited to our purposes here. He requires,
for every physical measurement F in a given experiment, with interaction parameters λ(µ) and characteristic length
scale ℓ, that the theoretical model must be invariant under changes of the cutoﬀmomentum scale µ →µ′,
F(λ(µ); ℓ)µ = F(λ(µ′); ℓ)µ′,
µ, µ′ > ℓ−1.
2

The characteristic length ℓis a physical parameter that is weakly dependent on, for example, whether an experiment
probes electronic, atomic, nuclear, or gravitational phenomena. In a less idealized theoretical model the physical
measurement result F would be determined by much more geometrical detail about the experiment than is given by ℓ,
which here will be taken to be provided by some set of source functions j1, ..., jn. The characteristic length ℓwould
also be, although weakly, some functional of the same source functions, ℓ( j1, ..., jn), giving
F(λ(µ); j1, ..., jn)µ = F(λ(µ′); j1, ..., jn)µ′,
µ, µ′ > ℓ−1( j1, ..., jn).
In this construction, µ and µ′ declare the characteristic momentum scales of two theoretical models, in contrast to the
physical momentum scale ℓ−1( j1, ..., jn). µ and µ′ are only weakly constrained by the inequality with ℓ−1( j1, ..., jn),
however a more systematic approach would be to give the choice of µ and µ′ as diﬀerent functionals of the source
functions, µ( j1, ..., jn) and µ′( j1, ..., jn), with both still satisfying µ( j1, ..., jn), µ′( j1, ..., jn) > ℓ−1( j1, ..., jn), so that the
renormalization group ﬂow can be rewritten as
F(λ(µ( j1, ..., jn)); j1, ..., jn)µ( j1,..., jn) = F(λ(µ′( j1, ..., jn)); j1, ..., jn)µ′( j1,..., jn),
or, more succinctly, removing µ( j1, ..., jn) and µ′( j1, ..., jn) as intermediaries,
F(λ( j1, ..., jn); j1, ..., jn) = F′(λ′( j1, ..., jn); j1, ..., jn).
Removing λ( j1, ..., jn) and λ′( j1, ..., jn) as the ﬁnal intermediaries, we obtain
F( j1, ..., jn) = F′( j1, ..., jn),
which is trivial except that F(j1, ..., jn) is now deﬁnitely a nonlinear functional of the source functions.
We separate interaction parameters and blocking from scaling because blocking is essentially the complicated
but relatively straightforward construction of new observables as arbitrary nonlinear functions of other observables,
whereas we can take the eﬀect of a scaling operation to be equivalent to introducing a free quantum ﬁeld that has
a diﬀerent mass, because free scalar quantum ﬁelds are indexed by just mass as an inverse length scale. We could
deﬁne “scaling” in a way that includes aspects of interaction parameter scaling and of blocking, but it is helpful
here to deﬁne scaling as purely about introducing free quantum ﬁelds that have a diﬀerent mass. Without loss of
generality, we can replace any collection of such scaling operations that we use for a particular regularization and
renormalization scheme by a possibly inﬁnite collection of independent free quantum ﬁelds {ˆφ(i)} of diﬀerent masses,
for which ⟨0|ˆφ(i)∗

where we have taken ˆφ(0)
j = ˆφj.
A real-space renormalization argument, given in Appendix B, is more ad-hoc but also supports the idea that the
nonlinearity suggested here should be thought a signiﬁcant aspect of quantum ﬁeld theory.
3. Fragmentation of the source
The *-algebra generated by the collection {ˆφ(i)} and the vacuum state together allow the construction of a Wightman
ﬁeld, so the Reeh-Schlieder theorem[3, §II.5.3][9, Thm. 4-2][10, §II] asserts that
the set of Hilbert space vectors that can be constructed using the operators associated with a bounded
region in space-time is dense in the set of states that can be constructed using the whole algebra.
3

In particular, if ˆZ j|0⟩is of ﬁnite norm, ⟨0| ˆZ†
j ˆZj|0⟩< ∞, which we can take to be satisﬁed before a limit λ[ j]→λc,
B[ j]→Bc is taken, then we can approximate ˆZj|0⟩arbitrarily closely in the Hilbert space norm for any j by using an
operator ˆζ j that is constructed using only operators that are associated with the support of that j,
ˆζ j|0⟩≡ˆZj|0⟩,
( ˆZj −ˆζj)|0⟩
2 = ⟨0|( ˆZj −ˆζj)†( ˆZj −ˆζj)|0⟩< ϵ2,
so that for the vacuum component of ( ˆZ j −ˆζj)|0⟩we have
⟨0|( ˆZj −ˆζj)|0⟩
 ≤
( ˆZj −ˆζj)|0⟩
 < ϵ for any ϵ > 0. For the
n-linear source form of the VEVs, we can construct an operator ˆζP
iαi ji for which

· · · ∂
∂αn
⟨0|( ˆZP

⃗α=⃗0

We can give this as an explicit limit for n = 1, taking ϵ to be a function of α1 that approaches zero faster than α1, as
lim
α1→0
⟨0|(( ˆZα1 j1 −ˆζα1 j1) −( ˆZ0 −ˆζ0))|0⟩

= 0,
and similarly but at greater length for n > 1, so that for the purposes of the n-linear VEVs, and hence for the purposes
of the S-matrix, we can approximate Z[ j] by ⟨0|ˆζj|0⟩. We have proved
Corollary 1 (to Reeh-Schlieder). If ˆZj|0⟩is of ﬁnite norm, the derivatives at j = 0 of the time-ordered generating
functional Z[ j] = ⟨0| ˆZj|0⟩can be approximated arbitrarily closely by derivatives at j = 0 of ⟨0|ˆζj|0⟩, using operators
ˆζj that are constructed using only functions that have support in Supp[ j].
Less than perfectly matching the S-matrix that is generated by Z[ j] can be good enough as an empirically adequate
model, because recorded experimental data is always ﬁnite in number and precision. Our use of ˆζj is also not restricted
to only the asymptotic case of the S-matrix: we can also consider VEVs such as ⟨0|ˆζj1 · · · ˆζjn|0⟩.
The requirement that ϵ(α1) approaches zero faster than α1 expresses that it may be more diﬃcult to ensure that
the derivatives of ⟨0|ˆζ j|0⟩are close to the derivatives of ⟨0| ˆZj|0⟩than to ensure that ˆζj|0⟩is close to ˆZ j|0⟩. That such
closeness can be achieved using local operators is good to know, but better to know is whether intuitively useful and
empirically successful models can be constructed using ˆζj. That empirical success is suﬃcient is important because
closeness in the Hilbert space norm,
( ˆZ j −ˆζj)|0⟩
 < ϵ, is not the same as closeness in the operator norm,
 ˆZj −ˆζj
 < ϵ,
the possibility of which is not assured by the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. Such closeness in the operator norm, however,
is not probed experimentally by measurement of the S-matrix.
Diﬀerent or more general constructions may be found to be more useful in future, but as an investigation of some
elementary properties of ˆζ j we will here adopt an ansatz that somewhat parallels the construction of ˆZj as
ˆζ j = T

F(n,r)[j]
is an operator constructed in the Hilbert space generated by {ˆφ(i)} as some number of terms, each of which is a
product of some number Rn of operator-valued factors that are nonlinearly dependent on j. Instead of deforming
the dynamics between diﬀerent local measurements, we deform the local measurements with the intention that the
deformed measurements will have the same eﬀect as the deformed dynamics.
The support of each of the functions F(n,r)[ j] is required to be a subset of the support of the source function j,
Supp[F(n,r)[ j]] ⊆Supp[ j], which ensures that [ˆζf, ˆζg] = 0 whenever the sources f and g have space-like separated
supports. We can use any reasonable nonlocal functionals of j freely, provided we then use them as part of a product
with j, insofar as Supp[ j·anyF[ j]] ⊆Supp[ j].
We have not so far assumed or required that Z[ j] is Poincaré invariant and well-deﬁned, however it is straight-
forward to construct Poincaré invariant examples for ˆζj. Whether a well-deﬁned Poincaré invariant construction is
possible or not in a Lagrangian approach, we can still investigate the properties of Z(nl)[ j] = ⟨0|T

which is an interaction of some kind, but speciﬁed in an algebraic way instead of by an interaction dynamics and a
regularization and renormalization scheme. In wavenumber space, this expression can be presented in a Feynman
diagram-like way as in Figure 1(a), where one of the arrows must correspond to a trivial propagator to ensure micro-
causality is satisﬁed. We can extend this particular construction to any tree-level diagram that has at least one trivial
propagator, as for ˆFj = ˆφ(2)
j(((j⋆H1)(j⋆H2))⋆H3), which gives a contribution to the 6-linear VEV that is presented graphically
in Figure 1(b). This construction is local because the test function j(((j ⋆H1)( j ⋆H2)) ⋆H3) includes j as a factor,
however the factor (( j ⋆H1)( j ⋆H2)) ⋆H3 represents a propagation of j to a point y that may be anywhere in space-
time, in two diﬀerent ways, giving us [ j ⋆H1](y)[j ⋆H2](y), then a propagation of that value at every point back to
the support of j. Such constructions are not modiﬁed by the presence of any other measurements, but they represent
a ﬁrst step towards introducing many diﬀerent resonances between sources and towards interference eﬀects between
those diﬀerent resonances.
The measurement operator constructions given above work with fragments of the source at a point, j(x), non-
linearly modulating those fragments by multiplication with other functions, but despite the nontrivial n-linear VEVs
that result we nonetheless obtain a structure that is still Gaussian insofar as the most elementary case above (with the
vacuum constructed using raising and lowering operators as usual) is generated by ˆϕj = ˆφ(0)
j + ˆφ(1)
j(j⋆H), which satisﬁes
the Heisenberg algebra,
[ˆϕ f, ˆϕg] = ( f ∗, g)(0) −(g∗, f)(0) + ((f(f⋆H))∗, g(g⋆H))(1) −((g(g⋆H))∗, f( f⋆H))(1).
More in the spirit of Kadanoﬀ’s nonlinear “blocking” of spins, however, we can construct products of two or many
more such measurement operator constructions, which will create a non-Gaussian quantum ﬁeld. We can, most
simply, introduce ˆFj = ˆφ(1)
j ˆφ(2)
j , as in Figure 1(c). This construction ensures that the algebra generated by ˆζj is a
strict subalgebra of the Wightman ﬁeld *-algebra generated by ˆφ(0)
j , ˆφ(1)
j , and ˆφ(2)
j , because ˆφ(1)
j
and ˆφ(2)
j
always occur
together, which introduces interference eﬀects because of products such as ( j1, j2)(1)( j3, j4)(2).
5

As in Figure 1(d) (which ﬁrst introduces any modiﬁcation of the quantum ﬁeld model when we measure 10-linear
VEVs), we can introduce products of operators that use any local functional of the source function, which implicitly
generalizes the concept of a “fragment”, somewhat extremely, to be any functional F[ j] for which Supp[F[ j]] ⊆
Supp[ j]. Note, however, that local functionals are possible that defy easy graphical presentation, such as j( j⋆j⋆H),
or, using derivatives, complex conjugation, and arbitrary powers, such as ∂µ j · ∂µ( j⋆H), ∂µ∂ν j · ∂µ( j⋆H1) · ∂ν( j⋆H2),
| j|α · ( j⋆H), et cetera, or we can introduce scaling eﬀects such as F[ j](x) = j(x) j(µ·(x −x j) + x j), where x j is a
constant weighted center of the source function and µ is a constant scaling factor. All such nonlinear functionals,
all satisfying microcausality, emphasize some source functions over others in their own way, resulting in diﬀerent
kinds of resonance. If we construct a continuum of slightly diﬀerent resonances, then we can expect the interference
between them sometimes to present as caustics.
As constructed here, we can introduce new expressions that have an eﬀect only for n-linear VEVs for large n, but
that have no eﬀect whatsoever on lower order VEVs. We could also consider an ansatz, however, that more parallels
the usual deﬁnition of an interacting ﬁeld[6, Eq. (6-5)], ˆξ(x) = ˆU−1(t)ˆφ(x) ˆU(t), such as ˆζj = T
h
eiˆFj[{ˆφ(i)}]i†eiˆφjT
h
eiˆFj[{ˆφ(i)}]i
,
with ˆFj[{ˆφ(i)}] as a nonlinear local functional of the source function, but such a construction reduces by use of a
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀidentity to a form similar to that considered above. It will be apparent that the ansatz
we have discussed here is eﬀectively a generating functional for tree-level diagrams, with very few constraints, so
it is somewhat close to the Feynman Tree Theorem[11, 12] and Generalized Unitarity[13], however the approach
here adopts a very diﬀerent philosophy of using nonlinear functionals of the source function as a way to sidestep the
concerns of regularization and renormalization, with a much looser connection, through the Reeh-Schlieder theorem,
to any speciﬁc Lagrangian.
4. Cutoﬀs and other meromorphic functions
All the constructions in the previous section use only multinomials in components of the source functions, which
we can extend straightforwardly to entire functions. If we introduce a cutoﬀ, however, in a construction such as
ˆFj[{ˆφ(i)}] = ˆφ(1)
tanh(λj), ˆζ j = T

ei(ˆφ(0)
j +ˆφ(1)
tanh(λj))
generates a more complicated system of n-point operator-valued distributions
because j(x) may take values outside the domain of convergence of expansions of tanh(λj(x)) at j(x) = 0, in which
case the derivatives at zero source ﬁeld that give the VEVs of the model will not give complete information about
ˆζj. For tanh(λj(x)), or for any other nontrivial meromorphic function, it will instead be necessary to use analytic
continuation.
Even more signiﬁcantly, if two source functions pass on diﬀerent sides of a pole of tanh(λ j(x)), then they cannot
be continuously deformed to be equal to each other without passing through that pole, in which case the norm of the
Hilbert space vector T

ei(ˆφ(0)
j +ˆφ(1)
tanh(λ j))
|0⟩would be undeﬁned, thereby introducing a discrete structure that is determined
by the poles of the meromorphic functions that are used. Cutoﬀs are a commonplace in experiment and in classical
signal analysis and engineering and cannot be ruled out a priori in the quantum ﬁeld case.
5. An axiomatic perspective
The only change that is needed to the presentation of free Wightman ﬁelds in Appendix A is the removal of
complex linearity, so that ˆξλf+µg , λˆξ f + µˆξg. In other words, ˆξ : F →A; f 7→ˆξ f is not an operator-valued
distribution. The measurement algebra is still generated by ˆξf and still satisﬁes microcausality, and the vacuum state
is still a linear map that allows the construction of a Hilbert space H that supports a representation of the Poincaré
group and for which the joint spectrum of the generators of the action of translations on H is a 4-vector in the (closed)
forward light-cone.
No weakening of the linearity of the Wightman ﬁeld is mentioned in Streater’s relatively early review[8, §3.4],
but in the context of the Haag-Kastler axioms a recent approach to interactions introduces a form of nonlinearity that
is of interest[14]. The approach here is much more constructive, takes renormalization as a starting point, and —for
better or worse— preserves more contact with the textbook approach to quantum ﬁeld theory, however we can adapt
a construction in [14] to suggest an intermediate axiom, instead of linearity or completely abandoning linearity, that
ˆΦj1+j2+j3 = ˆΦj1+j3 + ˆΦ j2+ j3 −ˆΦ j3
whenever j1 and j2 have space-like separated supports.
6

j1(x) j2(x) = 0 ∀x, if the two functions have space-like separated supports, so it is easily veriﬁed that this axiom is
satisﬁed for ˆΦ j = ˆφjn, for any n and for any sum of similar expressions, because
( j1 + j2 + j3)n −(( j1 + j3)n + ( j2 + j3)n −jn
3)
always includes a factor j1 j2, so the axiom above is satisﬁed for the ansatz ˆΦj = ˆφ(0)
j
+ P
n ˆφ(n)
jn+1, for example; but it
is only satisﬁed for ˆΦ j = ˆφjn·(j⋆H) if H is a weighted sum of advanced and retarded propagators, because all terms in
the diﬀerence include one of the factors j1 j2, j1( j2⋆H), or (j1⋆H) j2. The axiom above is not satisﬁed, however, by
ˆΦ j = ˆφ jm ˆφ jn, for example, which at this point does not seem obviously ruled out by any empirical principle. For this
latter construction, therefore, more elaborate axiomatic constraints would be required.
The nonlinearity of ˆξf has the drastic consequence that it allows n-linear quantum ﬁeld operators to be generated by
functional diﬀerentiation, giving n-point operator-valued distributions ˆξ(x1, ..., xn), as well as more complex behavior
if ˆξ f is a meromorphic functional of f. Such constructions are in this formalism clearly a consequence of nonlinearity,
and of dispersion if derivatives are introduced nontrivially, which may be understood as bound states if the interaction
is attractive, but may make more general contributions to global behavior. If we did not have the strong suggestion
from the analysis of renormalization in Section 2 that nonlinearity is hidden but is in fact present in the formalism as
we currently have it, the consequence of n-point operator-valued distributions ˆξ(x1, ..., xn) would seem a remarkable
innovation.
The Reeh-Schlieder theorem can seem quite counter-intuitively nonlocal, however it is a natural consequence of
the boundary conditions implicit in the way the Poincaré group is used in the Wightman axioms. As an intuition that
perhaps better accommodates that nonlocality, using a local operator to modify a state as an approximate model of the
world modulates not only measurement results in the future but also measurement results in the past and present to be
consistent with that modulated future, which then modiﬁes measurement results even outside the support and causal
future of the local operator that was used. There is, loosely, something of a back-and-forth of consistency, however
whether we label that consistency “causality” is a delicate question (which apart from this paragraph will be taken to
be outside the scope of this article). The construction used in Witten’s proof of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem[10] can
be read as giving a precise meaning to this consistency in terms of complex analyticity. Despite this back-and-forth of
consistency, quantum ﬁeld theory nonetheless only includes modulations of the statistics of measurement results that
satisfy microcausality, which ensures that messages cannot be sent.
Even when thinking in terms of classical probability our intuition should take any question we ask to be nonlocal,
insofar as most of what happened to us before we ask the question is available to someone who is space-like separated
from us. If someone knows a lot about my past until a minute before I ask a question, they can make an informed
guess about what the question might be. They don’t know exactly, but quantum ﬁeld theory and similar classical
theories are not about certainties, they are about probabilities in Minkowski space, so of course they encode, in a very
abstract way, that we can make better than random guesses about what happens at space-like separation because we
know something about the past.
6. Convex Hull Microcausality
Two functions satisfy Convex Hull Microcausality if the convex hulls of the supports of the two functions satisfy
microcausality. Convex hull microcausality is a weaker requirement than microcausality when the support of at least
one of the functions is not convex, in which case we can say that one of the functions may “surround” the other,
as for a ring around a cylinder, or that the functions may surround each other, as for two interlinked rings. The
concept of convex hull microcausality has not to my knowledge been previously introduced in the quantum ﬁeld
theory literature, so experimental tests that could distinguish between microcausality and convex hull microcausality
have not been discussed. At ﬁrst sight, it seems that a deﬁnitive test might be rather diﬃcult.
To show how convex hull microcausality emerges as a rather natural deﬁnition that is only slightly weaker than
microcausality when we introduce nonlinearity, we ﬁrst recall that we can construct a Gaussian Wightman ﬁeld as a
sum of raising and lowering operators, ˆξf = a f ∗+ a†
f , for which
[a f, a†
g] = ( f, g) =
Z
˜f
∗(k) ˜G(k)˜g(k) d4k
(2π)4 ,
˜G(k) = 2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0),
7

then for the measurement operator commutator we have
[ˆξf, ˆξg]
=
( f ∗, g) −(g∗, f) =
Z ˜f(−k)˜g(k) −˜g(−k)˜f(k)

Z 
eik·(x−y) −e−ik·(x−y) ˜G(k) d4k
(2π)4 · f(x)g(y)d4xd4y,
which is zero whenever every point in f is space-like separated from every point in g because in that case (x −y) is
always space-like so that the k integrand is antisymmetric. If we require only convex hull microcausality, however, we
can introduce a Gaussian nonlinear Wightman ﬁeld as a sum of raising and lowering operators as above, for which,
for example,
[af, a†
g] =

7. Discussion
Wilson&Kogut gives a telling summary of the physics of quantum ﬁeld theory[15, p. 79], «the behavior of
the system is determined primarily by the fact that there is cooperative behavior, plus the nature of the degrees of
freedom themselves. The interaction Hamiltonian plays only a secondary role.» A slightly diﬀerent way to refer to
“cooperative behavior”, motivated by signal analysis, is to think of each nonlinear transform F(n,r)[ j] as an antenna
functional F(n,r) applied to the source function to give an antenna function (which seems an idiosyncratic enough term
that we have called it an abstract fragment elsewhere here). We can consider a source function from the perspective
of each of many diﬀerent antenna functionals, then we can consider to what extent the antenna functions we obtain
resonate with antenna functions elsewhere, according to the corresponding dynamics, given by Wick contraction of
ˆφ(i)
F[ j] with similar terms. In contrast to summing Feynman path weights over all possible paths, Corollary 1 allows
us to construct a systematic weighted sum of products of all such resonances. Much more generally than Kadanoﬀ’s
“blocking”, we can construct multiple overlapping antennae, eﬀectively operating at diﬀerent wavenumbers and at
diﬀerent ranges of mass. For a radio antenna, for example, the whole assembly transmits in the radio spectrum in
relatively focused directions, but fragments of the antenna also emit thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum, more-
or-less omnidirectionally, and there are electromagnetic emissions in all frequency ranges. Figure 1(d), for example,
can be thought of as a model in which any source function generates two quite diﬀerent kinds of transmission and
response.

Figure 2: For each of N regions where we perform measurements, we have a source function fn that deﬁnes how ﬁne-grained each measurement
is and other detailed properties within that region. Source functions are often taken to be plane waves, focused at a single wave-number, however
they should in general be taken to be less singular than that. We can think of a source function as telling us precisely how close a measurement is
to an ideal but ill-deﬁned measurement at a single point or at a single wave-number.
(a) Feynman: sum amplitudes for many Feynman dia-
grams, with weights determined by an algebraic structure.
Each diagram sums for every yi being everywhere in space-
time and for every xn being everywhere in the support of
fn. Such integrals are in general not well-deﬁned unless
we decide on a regularization or renormalization scheme
that depends on the experiment and hence on details of the
source functions that describe it.
(b) Fragmentation: sum amplitudes for many fragment pairings, with
weights determined by an algebraic structure. Each fragment pairing
gives a product of “resonance overlaps” (F j[fm], F j[fn]) j, using frag-
ment functionals F j to construct a collection of fragments F j[ fn] for
each source function. This construction can be thought of as address-
ing a localized inverse problem for the interacting Feynman dynamics:
the fragment functionals and resonance overlaps are required to give an
equivalent overall sum, but using only a collection of free ﬁeld dynamics
and interference between them.
The construction here is a principled replacement for Lagrangian approaches to quantum ﬁeld models, because of
Corollary 1, which asserts that we can solve a localized inverse problem for the interacting dynamics, as in Figure 2.
We can hope this will be eﬀective as an engineering tool, but it is arguably not constrained or explanatory enough, so
it is presented here more as a stimulus for other constructions than as an end in itself. The construction is in any case
diﬀerent enough from Lagrangian approaches that it will take time for us to come to an understanding of its detailed
consequences. It is also clear that the wealth of possible such models and their relationship to experiment is more alike
to the wealth of eﬀective ﬁeld models[16] than to the very restricted class of renormalizable quantum ﬁeld models,
which are often regarded as more fundamental because there is not such a wealth. The approach here for example
shares three characteristics with Eﬀective Field Theories and with Schwinger’s source theory that are identiﬁed by
Cao[17, p. 122],
i. The denial of fundamental theory;
ii. the ﬂexibility of incorporating new particles and new interactions into existing schemes; and
iii. the possibility of considering nonrenormalizable interactions.
For a recent survey of Eﬀective Field Theories in the philosophical literature, see [18], which agrees with Cao in its
conclusion that «Eﬀective ﬁeld theories are not fundamental by intent and by design.» The mathematics pursued in
this article has to be taken to be mostly ad-hoc[19, §5] because it chooses to encode within the supports of the source
functions we use what we might otherwise say “really happens” between the supports of those source functions.
The mathematical desirability of a construction being well-deﬁned does not have to be taken to be philosophically
signiﬁcant.
As part of a discussion of «Emergence as Dependence Plus Novelty and Autonomy», [20, §2.4] suggests that
«Novelty is taken as robust behaviour exhibited by the macro-system (appropriately described by the
emergent theory) but not present in the micro-system (described by the micro theory).»
9

A source function approach allows us to rewrite this much more explicitly as “Novelty can be taken as robust be-
haviour measured at the macro-system level (appropriately described by large scale source functions) but not present
in measurements at the micro-system level (described by small-scale source functions)”, insofar as everything we
know comes from measurements that we have to place relative to some coordinate system, which in a ﬁeld theoretic
approach uses source functions. In a fragmentation approach, arbitrarily many or a continuum of types of fragments
are constructed and their resonances brought together, so that when we say “more is diﬀerent”, that bringing together
of the eﬀects of many fragments in general will be much more than a simple sum of one type of part. The idea of
a “tower of emergent theories” (see [20, §2.3, §3.5], for example), can be accommodated in a uniﬁed formalism of
measurements indexed by source functions, in which all scales can be represented as needed.
There are many books and classic articles on Eﬀective Field Theories from which many diﬀerent lessons can be
extracted; here we will close by contrast with one aspect of a quote from Georgi[16, p. 214],
«we can use an eﬀective ﬁeld theory to describe physics at a given energy scale, E, to a given accuracy,
ϵ, in terms of a quantum ﬁeld theory with a ﬁnite set of parameters. We can formulate the eﬀective ﬁeld
theory without any reference to what goes on at arbitrarily small distances.
The “ﬁnite set of parameters” part sounds like old-fashioned renormalizability. However, the dependence
on the energy scale, E, and the accuracy, ϵ, is the new feature of eﬀective ﬁeld theory. It arises because
we cannot possibly know, in principle, what is going on at arbitrarily high energies.»
A free quantum ﬁeld theory and the subalgebras of free quantum ﬁeld theories constructed here don’t know what is
going on at arbitrarily small scales, but they do present explicit well-deﬁned models of what would be going on at all
scales if the theory were completely correct (it won’t be!), even for measurement statistics at such ludicrously small
scales as 10−1000 meters, which can be checked and revised as needed when it is found to conﬂict, as it eventually will,
with experiment.
As always, there are some other traditions in the literature that are somewhat comparable to the construction here
of many functionals of a source function. Two I am particularly aware of are:
• dressed particles[21, 22] and Infraparticles[23, 24] surround a bare particle by a systematically generated cloud
of particles. The construction here gives an explicit functional form for how a regularization and renormalization
scheme modiﬁes the dynamics that is ﬁxed by the interaction Lagrangian.
• Poincaré invariant quantum theory[25, 26] introduces multi-point objects as models for bound states. The
nonlinear construction here can be thought of as a generating functional for such objects, however we have
insisted on microcausality here and multi-point objects are not suﬃcient if we introduce the meromorphic
functionals of Section 4.
The idea of an antenna gives some idea of the complexity that must be conveyed by a source function. A de-
scription of the intuition this suggests will be attempted in this speculative ﬁnal paragraph. A source function that is
mostly constant across a cubic meter volume but zero elsewhere does not, for example, tell whether it describes an
iron cube or ice or some other material, nor does it describe whatever lattice defects there might be, all of which will
aﬀect how well the given source function will act as a type of antenna at diﬀerent wavenumbers. If a source function
is modulated, however, at wavenumbers and amplitudes that correspond to a lattice of iron atoms, then the antenna
functionals for that modulation ought to generate stronger resonances than would be generated for other materials. We
should also ﬁnd that suﬃciently elaborate surface and internal modulations will result in what have become known as
metamaterial properties; as source functions become more complex, they might be able to model biological structures
such as leaves, with it being something of an understatement, however, that the computational needs for such model-
ing will increase extraordinarily. One of the most important “transmissions” for any source function is into the past
and future: when a source is extensively modulated, its antenna functionals will hopefully transmit the object much
more strongly along the worldline in Minkowski space that we would expect for a solid object, as a kind of caustic,
than when a source is much less modulated, creating a distinction between source functions that behave more or less
classically. A source function or set of source functions that models a chair, say, must create something close to this
kind of classical worldline in Minkowski space for the model to be empirically adequate. I cannot say enough, how-
ever, that thinking in terms of systematically constructing elaborate antennae and a complex of free ﬁeld relationships
between them feels like only a step along the way to more eﬀective conceptualizations.

Appendix A. The Wightman Axioms, the free scalar quantum ﬁeld, and time ordering
The Wightman axioms can be found in many variations. As a brief paraphrase of Haag’s presentation[3, §II.1.2],
• A Hilbert space H supports a unitary representation of the Poincaré group and there is a unique
lowest energy Poincaré invariant vacuum vector |0⟩.
• Quantum ﬁelds are operator-valued distributions: complex linear maps from a space F of source
functions into a *-algebra A of operators, ˆξ : F →A; f 7→ˆξ f, ˆξλf+µg = λˆξf + µˆξg.
• The source functions can be Lorentz scalars, vectors, et cetera.
• Microcausality: [ˆξ f, ˆξg] = 0 if f and g have space-like separated supports.
• Completeness: the action of the quantum ﬁeld operators on |0⟩generates H.
For the free scalar quantum ﬁeld, which will be our only concern here, the source function f(x) is a complex scalar
function on Minkowski space, f : M →C and ˆξ†
f = ˆξf ∗. Taking the index set for measurement operators to be source
or test functions is not necessarily the only, best, or a suﬃcient approach to describing experiments, however it will
be taken in this article to be general enough to merit detailed consideration.
The point of this article is that we can replace just the second entry above by
• Quantum ﬁelds are nonlinear maps from a space F of source functions into a *-algebra A of
operators, ˆξ : F →A; f 7→ˆξf, ˆξλf+µg , λˆξ f + µˆξg,
which allows the construction of a wide range of interacting quantum ﬁeld theories.
For a free scalar quantum ﬁeld ˆφf parameterized by mass m, the 2-measurement VEV
⟨0|ˆφ†
f ˆφg|0⟩= ( f, g) =
Z
˜f
∗(k) ˜G(k)˜g(k) d4k
(2π)4 ,
where ˜G(k) = 2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0),
is a Poincaré invariant positive semi-deﬁnite pre-inner product on the source function space, so for the free scalar
quantum ﬁeld a source function f(x) must have a well-enough controlled Fourier transform ˜f(k) that ( f, f) < ∞. The
commutator [ˆφf, ˆφg] = ( f ∗, g) −(g∗, f) is nontrivial in general but to satisfy microcausality it must be zero whenever
f and g have space-like separated supports. We can use Wick expansion to write down VEVs for eiˆφf and for the

|0⟩is the Feynman propagator in source function form (note that the Feynman form is

h
eiˆφf i

T
h
eiˆφf i†, which gives a state over the *-algebra that is generated by eiˆφf , T

eiˆφf i†, which in turn allows the
Gelfand-Naimark-Segal-construction of a Hilbert space and a vacuum sector representation of that *-algebra. Within
that vacuum sector representation, we have the equivalence
T
h
eiˆφf i
≡eiˆφf e−( f, f)F/2+( f ∗, f)/2,
so the vacuum sector representations of this free quantum ﬁeld with or without time-ordering can be taken to be in
this sense equivalent.
11

It is taken here to be helpful to consider a signal analysis perspective, in which a source or test function may
also be thought of as (1) a window function, insofar as for a smeared interacting operator ˆφf the test function f(x)
speciﬁes how a measurement couples to and hence how it “sees” or resonates with the state that is measured; or as (2)
a modulation function, insofar as a smeared interacting operator ˆφg can be used to modulate the vacuum state, giving
states that give diﬀerent expectation values, such as, at the lowest level,
⟨0|ˆφ†
gT
hˆφ(x1) · · · ˆφ(xn)
iˆφg|0⟩
⟨0|ˆφ†
g ˆφg|0⟩
.
Classical experience with algorithms that generate the response for an arbitrary stimulus in a signal analysis formalism
much more suggests nonlinearity than the a priori linearity of the Wightman axioms and other mathematics for
quantum ﬁelds.
Appendix B. Nonlinearity in a real-space renormalization perspective
To make contact with real-space renormalization[28, §4.4, §5.5] (or, in textbook form, [29, Ch. 5], for example)
in an axiomatic test function approach, we suppose ˆξf is a quantum ﬁeld measurement operator, with f a test function
on a square region that we split into N fragments and f [N]

. Repeated blocking can be systematized in other ways, but there will be
nonlinearity, because otherwise ˆξ[···]
f
would be no diﬀerent from ˆξ f = PN
j=1 ˆξ f [N]
j .
Even though ˆξ[···]
f
is nonlinear in f, it is arguably still a “quantum ﬁeld”, so that, in particular, it satisﬁes micro-
causality, [ˆξ[···]
f , ˆξ[···]
g ] = 0 if f and g are space-like separated. There is no strict necessity that the fragments used must
not overlap, nor that they must add up to the original test function, although either of those or other constraints might
be empirically eﬀective constraints. We only require that the supports of all the fragments are contained in the support
of the original test function. In this form, we can say that we are just using the free ﬁeld ˆξf , or a subalgebra of it,
however if we consider an inﬁnite limit of progressive blocking (and rescaling) we can be sure only that ˆξ[···]
f
must be
nonlinear and it may not be constructible in any simple way from a linear theory, which we will take to be enough for
the restricted aim of this Appendix: to justify weakening the Wightman axioms so that ˆξf is not a linear functional of
the test functions, in an ad-hoc real-space renormalization argument that is intended only to support the argument in
Section 2.
