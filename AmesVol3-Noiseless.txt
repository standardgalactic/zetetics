INTRODUCTION 
The standard lengths of Carriages of the Noise-
less Typewriter are referred to by alphabetical sym-
bols, i. e., 
11"- A 
12"-B 
14"-C 
18"-D 
These letters are used in ordering parts and it is 
important that there be no discrepancy for model 
parts desired. 
The type of the Remington Noiseless is marked 
between the characters of the typehead face. Plus 
6 designates Pica Type; Plus 3 designates Elite 
Type. 
The Underwood Noiseless Typewriter, manu-
factured 1937 to 1944, usually have UP for Under-
wood Pica T ype and UE for Underwood Elite 
Type. There is a difference in size between the plus 
3 and the UE type characters. Underwood type 
with plus 3 are identical with Remington plus 3 type, 
but the difference lies between the plus 3 and UE 
type used on some models of the Underwood Noise-
less. 
Scales of the Margin Rack, Bails and Paper Table 
can be identified by the length and figures on the 
Racks: 
Length 
Symbol 
11" 
A 
12" 
B 
14" 
c 
18" 
D 
Always specify 10 pitch or

ORDERING PARTS 
Caution should be exercised in ordering parts. 
comparing the parts in the Parts Catalog to the part 
of the particular machine, to insure accuracy. The 
Balance Shaft listed in the new Remington-Rand 
and Ames Parts Catalog for Noiseless Standard 
Machines is for the new style Shift Rails having 
the Spring Arms welded to the Shift Rail. 
This 
Balance Shaft has tapered counter-sunk holes and 
is specifically made for the Shift Rails that have 
the Arms welded to the Shift Rail. For older models, 
order the parts from the older parts catalog. 
If 
the supplier does not have the particular part or-
dered but the manufacturer has provided a substi-
tute, it will be furnished. 
It is always helpful to 
the supplier to supply the serial number of the ma-
chine with parts orders. 
When ordering parts for different length carriages, 
always use the proper symbol, A. B., C or D. When 
ordering parts for pitch (spacing) order 8 pitch. 
I 0 pitch or 12 pitch, etc. Pica and Elite are Type 
Styles and may not indicate the spacing of the 
machine. for example, the machine could be Elite 
Type on Pica Spacing. 
When ordering Type or Actions, give the loca-
tion of the part in the machine, and if you want 
special type, specify both characters of the type 
head and which character is located upper or lower. 
The number of the Keylever operating the type 
action should be supplied on such orders. 
In ordering Key tops, specify the character on 
the key top, i.e .• if you want the ditto marks over 
the figure 2, so specify.

touches four sheets of paper inserted in platen. 
Lock lock nut after adjusting and recheck 
trip after locking nut. 
A. TO SPEED UP TRIP on an action that 
is slow and the impression set correctly, 
peen the saddle of the slow action. If the 
trip is too fast after peening then file the 
action saddle. 
The trip is governed by 
pressure of the action saddle on the U-Bar. 
This adjustment is rare and must be done 
very carefully. 
129. Ribbon Cover:

CENTER TIE 
THE CENTER TIE: 
I. The Center Tie (C/T) is the heart of the Noise-
less typewdter. It is moved forward or rearward 
by action of the Pressure Indicator, bringing the 
platen forward or moving it rearward for the bene-
fit of more or less carbon copies. The Center Tie 
carries the Balance Shaft (Shifting Mechanism). 
Carriage and Platen. Any rocking action (uneven 
seating) of the C/T would be reflected in an uneven 
writing line and poor motion. 
"Seating" of the 
C/T 'means that it is positioned flat on its raceway 
to the extent that a .002" shim cannot be inserted 
between the C/T and the Race Way. 
Careful 
and accurate adjustment is essential. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: Adjustments are presented 
first as a C/T being installed into a machine in as-
sembly. Later, under Par. 2B, instructions for seat-
ing a C/T in an assembled machine (to correct a 
high C/ T) will be given. 
C/ T adjustments also include adjustments of the 
Rear Cover pertaining to <the C/T. In installing a 
C/T, proper pitch "tab plate" and in the old models, 
proper Set Key Finger are necessary. 
Set Key 
Finger for the late model machines is on the Shift 
Rail. 
A. To install a C/T in machine: 
( 1) Grease the Raceway and the C/ T. 
(2) Check to make sure that the C/ T will seat 
before attempting adjustment. 
Use .002" shim. 
Margin Release Shaft positioned properly to the 
Margin Release Keylever. 
(3) Adjust the Gib Screw on the Frame Lub on 
each side of the C/T (just ·above Gib Screws, End. 
Adi-) so the Gib Screws hold a slight drag on the 
C/T when C/T moved back and forth on its seat. 
Check with .002" shim to determine that C/T is 
still seated after Gib Screws are adjusted. 
( 4) Ad just the two ( 2) small Gib Screws (Gib 
Screws, end Adj.) on each end of the C/T until 
they just touch the rear upper Frame Member. These 
Gibs are adjusted to determine that there is no 
rock of the C/T on either end. Check with .002" 
shim to determine C/T is still seated. 
Determine 
that the C/T will move back and forth with a drag 
but without a definite bind. 
(5) Adjust the two (2) small Gib Screws on the 
C/T Retainer Strap (forward end of C/T). Check 
to determine that C/ T is still seated, using .002" 
shim. 
( 6) Position Spring Drum and Shift Tension 
Springs in machine. 
(7) Position Lower Tab. Comb to the Rear Low-
er Frame Member with two (2) Screws, placing 
the Set Key Lever of the C / T in the first slot on 
the left (from the rear) and the Clear Key and Tab. 
Key of the C/ T in the first and second slots re-
spectively, on the right (from the rear). 
( 8) Position Rear Cover to the Frame. 
All 
Screws must be tight. 
(9) Adjust the Rear Cover Lugs, R. H. and 
L. H. to the Center Tie        R. H. and L. H. in 
such manner that there will be a very minimum 
of side twist or up/ down movement of the C/T. 
The lugs of the C/ T have elongated holes and are 
adjustable up/down. Rear Cover Lugs, R. H. and 
L. H. have elongated holes and are adjustable 
toward the side of the machine to take out side play 
of the C/T. Check the C/T for being seated on

CUT OUT FOR SET kEY FINGER 
1. The Carriage is fitted to the Shift Raf so that 
there is a very minimum of play between the Front 
and Back Rail when the Carriage is riding on the 
Roller Retainers (trucks). 
The Retainers, once 
positioned correctly, will not shift their position in 
operation, as the retainers are set on a bracket      ing a small gear operating in a comb of the Carriage 
Rail and another Comb of the Shift Rail. 
The 
Roller Retainers are positioned so that they will 
not extend through the end of the Shift Rail when 
the Carriage is at either its extreme right or left. 
The Carriage must run smoothly, be free of 
binds and play held to a minimum. Adjustments are 
given in sequence and should be followed. Latest 
models do not have the End Plates, otherwise        justments are the same. Sequence shown with      riage removed (See Paragraph 3) to remove. 
2. 
ADJUSTMENTS: 
A . Check the rails for being straight, examine 
for chatter marks and grind the rails if necessary. 
Examine the combs of the rails and straighten the 
teeth if necessary. Make certain the Carriage Rail 
is held securely to the Carriage ends. 
B. 
Check the Roller Retainers for being straight, 
for flat rollers and Roller Retainer Bracket for 
being malformed. The small gear of the bracket 
must be free and teeth in good condition. 
SHIFT RAIL END PLATE L H. 
END PLATE ADJUSTING ECCENTRIC 
C. 
Center the Roller Retainers so they will not 
extend through the end of the Rail when the Car-
riage is at either extreme end. 
D. With the Rail Locking Screws loose, adjust 
the Eccentrics of the End Plates of the Shift Rail. 
These Eccentrics will pull the back rail toward the 
front. 
The Left End Plate Eccentric brings the 
Back Rail forward or rearward on the left side and 
will affect the Carriage fit when the Carriage -is 
at the left end of the Shift Rail. The Eccentric 
should be so adjusted that they removed the play 
between the Shift Rail and Carriage Rail when the 
Carriage is at that end of the Shift Rail. 
E. 
Lock all Holding Screws securely. 
Check 
along the Carriage for Play along the Shift Rail. If 
play occurs, note the position of the rollers where 
the play occurs. MOVE THE ROLLERS OUT 
OF THE POSITION WHERE THE RAIL WAS 
LOOSE and with the Screws still tight tap in on 
the Back Rail. If the rail is tapped too hard, the 
Cariage will bind and if this occurs, loosen the screw 
nearest the bind and retighten. If it still shows play 
at that position, tap the rail in again. 
NEVER 
T AP IN ON THE RAIL WITH THE ROLLERS 
BEHIND THE POINT THAT YOU ARE       PING AS THE RAILS ARE MUCH SOFTER 
THAN THE ROLLERS AND WILL MAKE 
DEEP PITS IN THE RAILS. 
3. 
To Remove Carriage: (See Page 16) 

PAPER FEED 
15 
MARGIN RELEASE LEVER 
PAPER FEED. 
1. 
The feed rolls must be perfectly free on their 
shafts, uniform in size and concentric in form and 
in good condition. The Feed Roll Release Lever 
should release the Feed Rollers sufficiently to clear 
12 sheets of paper. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. Feed Roll Tension: Feed roll tension is      justed by a screw on the rear of the Feed Roll 
Cradle and should be adjusted to hold one sheet of 
paper firmly. Spacers must clear Feed Rollers. 
B. 
Paper Pan (Trough): The Pan should clear 
the platen by not more than the thickness of six ( 6) 
sheets of paper. The Paper Trough positions on 
pins with a spring and felt silencer under the trough 
on both ends (pins). The pins may lean slightly 
to give the trough clearance of the Platen on either 
end. The felt silencers are used to cut down the 
rattle of the trough in typing and shifting. 
C. Paper Fingers: Paper Fingers should slide 
smoothly on the Paper Finger Rail and should be 
formed to the Platen so that the metal does not rub 
the Platen. 
Rollers should be free. 
Specify left 
or right hand finger in ordering. 
Paper Bale: To properly align the paper bale to 
the scales of the machine (margin rack and paper 
table): 
1. 
Position the left margin stop on a number 
(we'll use 30) then position the carriage to the left 
margin setting against the margin release lever of 
the C/ T. 
2. 
Strike the letter i. (That would put you on 
space 31). 
3. 
Backspace one space. (That will put you 
back on 30). 
4. 
Roll the paper up until the letter i is directly 
under the bale the letter i should line up with the 
30 of the bale. If not shift the bale on its elongated 
holes until the letter i lines up with the 30 of the 
bale. 
5. 
Position the bale on the indicator bracket of 
the type bar comb. If the line of the indicator does 
not line up with the 30 of the bale, position the 
indicator bracket of the comb on its elongated holes 
to the correct position.

ROLLER BRACKET AND RETAINER 
ROLLER BRACKET AND RETAINER. 
I. The Roller Bracket and Retainer are the me-
diums by which the Carriage is held to the C/T 
in order that the Carriage can be kept solid, free 
in movement and hold the writing line uniformly 
on both capitals and normals. The Retainer is        justed to the Roller Bracket and the adjustments 
must be close. If Retainer is adjusted too close, the 
shifts will bind and the Carriage will hold up in 
writing. The Roller Bracket and Retainer must be 
removed in order to remove the Carriage. 
2. TO REMOVE CARRIAGE: 
A. 
Disconnect Drawband-Attach end over 
Rear Cover to Ratchet Pawl of Spring Drum. 
B.

the Carriage to the extreme right (from the rear), 
Shift to Capitals and remove the Retainer. 
The 
Retainer is removed when the Carriage is at the 
extreme right to get the Retainer in a position away 
from the Feed Roll Cradle. 
D. 
Back the Pressure Indicator away from the 
Zero Stop. lift the Platen from the machine (to pre-
vent bending the Type Guide in removing the 
Roller Bracket), press the carriage forward, pull 
back and down on the roller bracket. The Bracket 
should come out without difficulty.

removed and Pressure Indicator backed off from 
the Zero Stop. 
D. Move the Carriage to the extreme right, shift 
to capitals and replace the Retainer Bracket. Screw 
the Adjusting Screw toward you a couple of turns 
to hold the Retainer to the Roller Bracket. Release 
Shift Lock. 
E. 
Replace the Retainer Gib Plate and Screw. 
This screw must be locked solid and it may be 
necessary to screw in on the adjusting screw before 
the screw becomes locked solidly. 
F. 
Adjust the Adjusting Screw until the play 
between the Roller Bracket and Retainer is held to 
a minimum but the Carriage runs freely, and shifts 
free without a drag. 
G. 
Place .002" shim between the pad on each 
side of the Roller Bracket and the Retainer Plate 
of the C/T. Check the drag on the two shims. If 
the drag is uneven, shift the Balance Shaft by 
loosening the two screws holding the Balance Shaft 
End Plate on the right end of the Balance Shaft 
( far.ing the machine from the front). The drag on 
the two shims should be even when the Carriage 
is centered to the machine, Carriage Retainer Rail 
parallel to the Center Tie Retainer Plate.

PLATEN AND VARIABLE 
PLATEN AND VARIABLE. 
1. The Platen of the Noiseless Typewriter must 
be perfectly true (concentric) to insure uniform im-
pressions, better carbons and good alignment. 
A 
poor ground (eccentric) platen will cause an uneven 
impression in different positions of the platen. The 
Type Head of the Noiseless does not have the free-
dom of movement to the Platen as does the standard 
front stroke typewriter, the pressure of the action 
being adjusted so that it will barely reach the sur-
face of a perfectly concentric platen when the Pres-
sure Indicator is at the 12 o'clock position. Good 
carbons, impressions and alignment are impossible 
with an eccentric platen. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: The Platen must be fitted 
properly in the Carriage without end shake and 
up/down movement. but perfectly free to spin when 
Ratchet Detent and Paper Feed Roll Release Levers 
are released. 
A. Variable Clamp Bushing and Screw: It is 
extremely important that the Variable Oamp Bush-
ing and Screw are tight. 
( 1) 
Holes on Platen Shaft, where the Clamp 
Bushing and Screw fit are two different sizes. The 
Clamp Bushing fi.ts through the larger hole of the 
Platen Shaft into the deeper countersunk hole of the 
Variable Shaft. Before replacing the Clamp Bush-
ing Screw, tap the Bushing securely into the Platen 
hole and the Variable Shaft hole. This will pre-
vent the Bushing from turning while the screw is 
being tightened. If this connection is loose, the 
Platen, will move through vibration, in writing. 
B. 
Platen Fitting: 
(I) The R. H. Knob is adjustable, by threading 
on the Platen Shaft, to remove end shake and secure 
proper fit. To adjust, back off R. H. Platen Knob 
slightly (turn counter-clockwise); back off Platen 
Locking Screw: tighten (turn clockwise) the Platen 
Knob ti\'.fhtly. 
Check for freedom of Platen. 
(2) 
To Remove Platen: Open L. H. and R. H . 
Platen Locks. Position Bail on the indicator of the 
Typebar Comb., lift the Platen upward and out. 
To replace: Reverse procedure. 
( 3) 
Platen Locks, L. H. and R. H.: 
Platen 
Locks must be adjusted to eliminate up/down play 
in the Platen but must not cause a bind in the Platen 
(which may be determined by spinnin!'.I the Platen, 
with Ratchet Detent and Paper Feed Roll Release 
Levers released). The Platen Locks should snap 
locked (detent action) with all up/down play in the 
Platen removed. 
Adjust by loosening the Platen 
Lock Adjusting Nut and turning Platen Lock Ad-
justing Screw. 
Relock Lock Nut after adjusting. 
Check Platen for freeness and play after adjusting. 
C. VARIABLE: 
(1) To Remove: Back off the Variable Clamp 
Screw until only one thread of the screw is holding. 
Tap on the Screw to force the Bushing through 
the Platen Shaft. Remove Bushing and Screw. Pull 
Variable from the Platen; remove the Platen Bear-
ing and Spring. To Replace: Reverse procedure. 
(2) 
Adjustment: 
The only adjustment is to 
determine that all springs are in good condition, 
clutch dogs not badly worn, teeth inside the ratchet 
in good condition and the parts correctly assembled 
in the variable in re-assembling. If the round spring 
inside the Variable is not in the notches of the 
clutch dogs. the Variable will not operate properly. 
To remove Platen from Model No. 6 and some 
of the Underwood Noiseless Models, the following 
sequence is most practical. 
( 1 ) 
Unscrew the R. H . Platen Knob from the 
Platen. 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
Remove R. H. Platen Bushing. Slip out to 
the right. 
Remove the Variable Clamp Bushing and 
Screw. 
Remove L. H. Platen Knob. 
( 5) 
Remove Line Space Lever Bracket. 
(a) Screw at top in front of Line Space 
Lever. 
(b) Screw Holding Line Space Lever to 
Carriage End. 
( c) Screw holding Bushing that holds 
Ratchet Detent Spring. (Loosen screw, 
place finger above the Bushin\'.J, next 
to the Detent Spring) . Remove Ratchet 
Detent Spring and Screw. 
( 6) 
Remove Variable from Platen Shaft. 
(7) 
Lift Platen up and out. (Some of the older 
Model 6 machines have 1 O'' Platens). 
Reverse above procedure to replace Platen. Ad-
just Platen for end shake before replacing Line 
Space Bracket. 
This model does not have a de-
mountable Platen. 
LINE SPACE LEVER 
1. The Standard Ratchet for the Noiseless Type-
writer has 30 teeth. The Ratchet must have a cor-
responding standard pawl in order to operate cor-
rectly. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: Check all screws for tight-
ness before attempting adjustment. 
A. 
Release the Detent from the Ratchet with 
the Detent Release Lever. Adjust the Ratchet De-
tent Bracket Adjusting Eccentric so that the Detent 
Roller barely clears the teeth of the Ratchet without 
contacting any. Tighten the locking screw of the 
eccentric. 
B. Position the Line Space Lever to the extreme 
right. While holding the lever in this position. turn 
the Platen to determine if there is any movement 
in the Platen. If movement, adjust the Line Space 
Pawl Limit Screw. The roller of the detent must 
position squarely between the teeth of the Ratchet. 
C. There should be no play between the lip of 
the small Bracket attached to the Line Space Lever 
and the Pawl. Form the lip of the Bracket to take 
up the slack. 
D. Ratchet Detent Tension: 
To apply more 
tension to the Ratchet Detent Bracket, lift the Platen 
out of the machine; with a socket wrench screw-
driver combination, Wrench ST-40016. unlock the 
Lock Nut and Screw in on the Detent Tension Ad-
justing Screw.

SHIFrlNG MECHANISM 
SHIFTING MECHANISM. 
1. The Shifting Mechanism includes adjusting of 
the Toggle Linkage, Shift Keylevers, Shift Shaft, 
Shift Rail, Balance Shaft, Knee Action, Roller 
Bracket and Retainer Adjustment of the Carriage. 
The Shift Locks are not adjusted until the motion 
has been set. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: The Correct sequence of 
the Shifting Mechanism is: 
A. 
Adjust the Toggle Link Short Adjusting 
Screw (located under the toe of the Toggle Link 
Short) until the Shift Key has a catch before it 
depresses fully (machine setting on its back while 
adjusting Toggle Link Adjusting Screw, Short). If 
this screw is "in" too far. the rail will not lock in 
normal case (small letters) and the Shifts will 
bounce in shifting. If this screw is "backed off" 
too far, the Shifts will catch too hard (when the 
machine is resting on the rear cover) and will also 
have a catch in shifting in normal operating position. 
The Toggle Link will have lost motion if the screw 
is "backed off" too far. 
B. 
Check the Shift Keylevers for height in rela-
tion to the bottom row of keylevers. The Keytop 
of the Shift Key should be positioned so that about 
half of the keytop is above regular keylever key-
tops. Adjust the height with the Shift Height Adj. 
Eccentric. 
C. 
Check all linkage for play and all screws for 
tightness. 
D. 
Adjust Carriage Retainer to Carriage Re-
tainer Rail (See Roller Bracket and Retainer Page 
16) and parallel the Retainer Rail of the Carriage 
to the Retainer Plate of the Center Tie. 
E. Parallel the Platen: Back off the. Pressure 
Indicator to a position where the letters print very 
lightly. Strike off letters on each end of the Platen. 
If the letters are light on the R. H. end of the Platen, 
prick punch the Retainer Rail on the light side 
(R. H. Carriage end in this instance) in the notch 
that the Retainer Rails sets into the Carriage End 
so that the Retainer Rail will be forced toward the 
Center Tie. The impression will be heavier on the 
end pricked. Care should be taken in this adjust-
ment to insure that it is pricked only to the point 
necessary for letters on each end of the Platen to 
print with the same density. If the Platen is too 
far out of parallel, then shift the Shift Rail (by ad-
justing the R. H. End Plate of the Balance Shaft). 
If the Retainer Rail is parallelled to the Retainer 
Plate of the Center Tie (flat on center tie position) 
the requirement for peening or prick punching is 
lessened. 
F. 
       Shifts for Operation: Free, light and 
snappy. To make the Shifts lighter, apply more 
tension to the Shift Tension Spring; to make Shifts 
heavier, lessen tension of the Shift Tension Springs 
Always increase or lessen tension on both springs 
uniformly. 
3. 
ADJUSTING (TROUBLE SERVICING): If 
a bind occurs in the Shifting Mechanism which can-
not be immediately located, the following steps will 
aid in locating the trouble by the process of elimina-
tion: 
A. 
Disconnect the screw holding the Toggle 
Link to the Balance Shaft End Plate, (upper front 
screw). 
( 1 ) 
Raise the Carriage and Rail in the SHIFT-
ING motion (by hand) to determine if there is any 
bind or drag. If binding, the trouble is in Pivot 
Screws-check to determine if adjusted too tight and 
always examine pivots for wear, replacing if nec-
essary. 
( 2) 
Balance Shaft positioned on the C/T so 
that some of the Shifting Mechanism is binding on 
the C/T (Shift Spring Arms Set Key Bracket, bal-
ance shaft hitting on the C/T Connecting Lug of 
the C/ T or the Balance Shaft causing the Toggle 
to bind on the C/ T in the Shifting operation.) 
( 3) 
Roller Bracket and Retainer improperly ad-
justed. 
( 4) 
Balance Shaft binding on the Shift Rail. 
The Shift Rail must be removed to make this check 
only. 
( 5) 
Check all End Plate holding screws for tight 
-check Pivot Screw Lock Nuts for tightness. 
B. 
Check Shift Keys, Shift Shaft and Toggle 
Adjustments. 
( 1 ) 
Shift Keys centered in the Keylever Comb. 
( 2) 
Shift Key Shaft properly adjusted on its 
Pivot Screws (free without end shake). 
( 3) 
Toggle Link has play or free linkage on the 
Shift Height Eccentric and the Connecting Screw 
holding the Toggle Link to the Shift Key lever Shaft. 
(4) 
Lower Toggle Screw adjusted properly. 
(Minimum of play on the large tapered screw). 
To adjust Large Tapered Screw, unlock the large 
lock nut between the Toggle Link and the Frame, 
adjust the tapered screw, then relock the lock nut 
to the frame. The large Tapered Screw should not 
move when shifting as the lock nut is due to hold 
it in a stationary position. 
(5) 
Check the Lower Fore Screw. Nut must be 
tight. Screw is tapered to remove the play between 
links. 
( 6) 
Position machine on its feet facing back of 
machine-pick up the Shift Keylever and notice 
the position of the Toggle Link in relation to the 
Balance Shaft End Plate. The Toggle Link should 
slide along the End Plate with no draff and with-
out noticeable clearance between the Toggle Link 
and the End Plate. If the Toggle Link is too close 
to the End Plate of the Balance Shaft, there will 
be a bind before the Toggle is connected which 
will be more pronounced when the Toggle Link and 
End Plate are connected. If the Toggle Link is too 
far from the End Plate, the Toggle Link must be 
pulled in the connection and a drag in the Shifts 
will show up. To line the Toggle to the End Plate, 
push against the Toggle Link until the desired posi-
tion has been reached. 

SHIFTING MECHANISM

( 7) 
Connect the Toggle Link to the Balance 
Shaft with a tapered screw. 
Adjust the tapered 
screw (Upper Fore Screw) until there is no play 
between the Toggle Link and the End Plate, then 
lock the lock nut. Unless all screws and lock nuts 
are secure, time will be wasted in making these 
adjustments.

( 8) 
If the preceding steps are followed the Shift-
ing Mechanism should operate freely. 
If the Set 
Keylever is not adjusted properly the Shifts may 
drag. The Knee action will also bind the Shifts. It 
is important that the linkage floats on its rivets. The 
Knee action is set in connection with the Motion.

The .060" of the Underwood having the Pressure 
Indicator on the side of the Frame, R. H. is con-
trolled by adjusting the screw on the small plate 
attached to the front of the C/ T. To adjust: The 
Pressure Indicator handle should be to the front of 
the machine and the clearance between the Platen 
and the Type Guide .060". If the distance is more 
or less, loosen the set screw on the top of the Plate 
on Front of C/ T, place a screwdriver between the 
two Center Actions and adjust the screw on the 
front of the plate until the .060" is set. The Pressure 
Indicator Shaft of this model has an eccentric cam 
on the end of it, the C/ T being under spring tension 
is moved forward or rearward by the cam when 
turned. It is unnecessary to remove any parts to 
make this adjustment.

"ON FEET" ADJUSTMENT. 
I. For the "On Feet" setting, a ribbon should be 
placed in the machine and the Pressure Indicator 
"backed off" to a position where the letters all print 
very lightly. The "On Feet" adjustment is made 
with the small letters printing and the following 
adjustments must be correctly made before attempt-
ing this adjustment: 
A. 
Center Tie seated with no rocking. 
B. 
Toggle adjusted properly and rail locked in 
normal case. 
C. 
Platen Parallel and all of the Shifting Mech-
anism correctly adjusted. 
D. 
Platen adjusted properly (See Platen adjust-
ments) . 
E. 
.060" position set. 
2. 
ADJUSTMENTS: 
This adjustment must be 
made before setting "Motion." 
A. 
Back off the Pressure Indicator to a position 
where the letters print lightly, carriage in normal 
non-shift position. 
B. 
Check to determine that a majority of letters 
are printing fully. 
C. If majority of letters are light on top or bot-
tom, in printing, adjust the Balance Shaft End Plate, 
by loosening 3 holding screws and raising or lower-
ing the Carriage with the Eccentric (see Drawing). 
When the Type have been put "on-feet", tighten 
all three holding screws securely, as one of these 
screws remaining loose can cause bind of the Shift. 
The "on-feet" position must be made before setting 
the motion as the shifting of the end plate will throw 
the motion adjustment off.

IMPRESSIONS. 
1. 
Impression is the adjustment of the individual 
action on the Top Plate in relation to the Platen 
so that all type bars contact the Platen with the 
same force. The .060'' must be set and the C/T 
Seated before adjusting the impression. The Ac-
tions are moved in and out in the top plate by the 
screws the action frame sets in, located at the top 
of the Top Plate. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. Check the .060". 
B.

1. 
Before adjusting the "motion", the Shifting 
Mechanism must be properly adjusted. Any mal-
adjusting of the Shift Mechanism can cause faulty 
"motion". The C/T should be properly adjusted 
(see Center Tie), and the Toggle Link Stop Screw 
"backed off" so that the screw is not limiting the 
travel of the T oggle Link.

ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. 
Adjust the motion with the Motion Adjusting 
Screw located on the Balance Shaft End Plate, L. H. 
This Screw limits the travel of the Carriage in 
Shifting. 
The letters Hh should be used. 
The 
bottom cleats of the capital H and the bottom cleats 
of the small h should be on a straight line. The mo-
tion should be checked for uniformity across the 
entire length of the platen. If the motion is uneven 
across the platen, check the following: 
( 1) 
Worn Balance Shaft Pivot Screws, or end 
shake of the Shaft on the Pivot Screws. 
(2) 
Play or excessive wear of the Shift Key

Adjust Shift Locks: 
( 1) 
Lock 
Plates 
are 
moved 
up/ down 
on 
elongated holes to their proper position. 
Motion 
should be the same with each Shift Lock as without 
Shift Locks, and the Carriage should be fairly solid 
in cap position with the Shift Locks locked. Locks 
should be set so that they lock uniformly and must 
be safe, which can be checked by hitting corner of 
machine with edge of hand. With both locks locked, 
release of one should unlock that side just prior to 
release of opposite side: 
C. 
Knee Action: 
( 1) 
Knee Action should be adjusted to the Es-
capement Shaft so that there is little play between 
the Knee Action linkage and the hub of the Escape-
ment Starwheel when the shifts are in locked posi-
tion. The Knee Action retains the Starwheel pres-
sure against the fixed dog so that piling can be 
eliminated, and also breaks the arc of the Escape-
ment Shaft in shifting to prevent the Capital letters 
and small letters from crowding in shifting. 
(2) 
If the Knee Action is too high on the E scape-
ment Shaft, the Carriage will hold up in writing 
when on Caps. If the Knee Action is too low on 
the Escapement Shaft the Knee Action may hit t\.;e 
Tab. Key levers and letters would vary in shifting. 
i.e., Knee Action set right oOoO the small o is cen-
tered between the capital O's. If Knee Action is 
low the small o will not center between capitals. 
D. 
Toggle Link Stop Screw: 
( 1) 
This screw helps support the T oggle and 
should be adjusted to where the screw touches the 
Toggle when the shifts are in their locked position. 
If the screw is too high, the Motion will show the 
Capital H above the small h. This adjustment is 
made AFTER the motion is set, the Shift Locks 
adjusted and Knee Action adjusted. 
( 2) 
Make sure that the Toggle Stop Screw and 
not the T oggle Link Adjusting Screw is being ad-
justed in this last step. The two screws are side 
by side. The Toggle Stop Screw is the one nearest 
the frame and has the larger head. If the T oqgle 
Adjusting Screw is adjusted bv mistake, all the Shift 
Adjustments will be off includin\'.j the motion.

ESCAPEMENT 
ESCAPEMENT. 
1. 
The Escapement is composed of three sections, 
The Main Escapement Bracket, the Tabulator Es-
capement Bracket and the Rocker. ( 1) The Main 
Escapement Bracket consists of the Starwheel with 
its Knee Action linkage, the Tab. Brake Bracket 
(with brake tension spring and brake release ad-
illsting screw attached), the Tab. Brake Friction 
Wheel, Rocker Return Spring and the Pivot Screws 
and .their component parts. (2) The Tab. Escape-
ment Bracket consists of the Tab. Arm, Tab. Es-
capement Arm (which moves the fixed dog from 
the starwheel in tabulating) and the Tab. Escape-
ment Bracket return spring_ which maintains a con-
tinuous pull on the Tab. Escapement Arm holding 
the brake from the friction wheel when not tabu-
lating. 
(3) The Rocker consists of the Fixed Dog, 
the Stepping Dog and their component parts. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. The Rocker: 
( 1) 
The Rocker should be weighed in to get 
uniform weight on the Rocker. This is performed 
with a Rocker Weight Gauge. 
Place the Gauge 
on the Rocker and depress the Feed Rack Release 
Lever of the Carriage, the Rocker Weight Gauge 
should drop slowly. If a weight gauge is not avail-
able, turn the Rocker Spring Tension Washer about 
1/8 of a turn. Too much weight on the Rocker 
Return Spring will cause a heavy touch-too little 
tension will cause piling. 
(2) 
The Rocker should be positioned on its 
Pivots so that the Fixed Dog is in a 6 o'clock posi-
tion with the Starwheel tooth (carriage tension 
against the fixed dog). Facing the machine from 
the rear, the R. H. Pivot is adjusted by backing off 
the Rocker Tension Lock Nut; remove the Rocker 
Tension Washer (with etched teeth); remove the 
Rocker Tension Spring and unlock the Rocker 
Pivot Lock Nut which is located under the Rocker 
Tension Return Spring. 
Never attempt to adjust 
the R. H. Pivot Screw without following the pro-
cedure. 
(3) If the Brake Release is adjusted "in" too 
far. the Tab. Escapement arm will partially disen-
gage the Fixed Dog from the Starwheel and will 
cause skipping in operation. If there is not enough 
adjustment on the Release Screw, there will be brake 
on the friction wheel at all times and the machine 
will pile. There should be a slight amount of clear-
ance between the Tab. Escape. Arm and the Fixed 
Dog when the Tab. Keylever is in its inactive posi-
tion. The Tab. Arm is formed to regulate the Tab. 
Trip. 
3. TO REMOVE ESCAPEMENT (from com-
pletely assembled machine): 
A. 
Disconnect the Universal Bar Trip Connect-
ing Link from the Universal Bar Hanger Bracket 
and slide the connecting link back through the 
Rocker without disturbing the U-Bar Trip Adjust-
ment. 
B. 
Remove the Lock Nut and the Adjusting 
Nut from the end of the Space Bar Connecting Link. 
This will throw off the Space Bar Trip Adjustment. 
C. 
Unlock the Lock Nut of the L. H. (from the 
rear) Pivot Screw and back off tne Pivot Screw. 
Slip the Rocker out to the left. 
D. 
Remove the Tabulator Keylever Pivot Shaft, 
raising the levers upward from the Escapement. 
There is no need of removing the levers from the 
machine. 
E. 
Remove the Spring Clip from the end of the 
Tab. Escape. Return Spring. 
F. 
Loosen the Knee Action Screws holding the 
Knee Action to the Escapement Shaft, shifting to 
capitals. 
G. 
Remove the two (2) screws holding the 
Escapement to the Frame Brace and remove the 
Tab. Escapement Bracket and Main Escapement 
Bracket. 
4. TO REPLACE 
ESCAPEMENT: 
Reverse 
above procedure. 
5. 
All parts of Escapements with Knee Action are 
the same on both 10 pitch and I 2 pitch. 
Star-
wheels differ only on 8 pitch, I 4 pitch and I 6 pitch. 
The same applies to back space dogs. 
Machines 
without Knee Aotion have a different Starwheel and 
Backspace Dog for each pitch make. 
6. 
CAUSES OF SKIPPING: 
A. 
Too much clearance between the Dogs, both 
horizontal and vertical. 
B. 
Space Bar and U-Bar Trip too fast. 
C. 
Dogs too low in relation to the Starwheel. 
D. 
Chipped tooth on Starwheel, pinion or Feed 
Rack. 
E. 
Chipped or badly worn Dogs. 
F. 
Brake Release Screw "in" to far. 
THE ESCAPEMENT DOGS. 
1. The horizontal clearance between the Pixed Dog and the 
Stepping Dog is from .063" to .068". If the distance between 
the two dogs is more than .068" then skipping will occur. If 
the distance is less than .063" piling will probably result. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. The "Creep Clearance" (step) is the clearance between 
the Pace of the Stepping Dog and the face of the Pixed Dog. 
In the drawing, the figure that is given is approximately .040". 
There may be .002" or less play on the holding or Pivot Screws 
for the two Dogs. The Lock Nuts must be tight and the Dogs 
free on the Screws without spring tension. 
(Occasionally a 
Fixed Dog will be burred on its Pivot hole and will hang up). 
The .040" clearance is sufficient to insure that the Dogs will 
not cause piling or skipping. With the Rocker positioned in 
machine at 6 o'clock position, to get the half step, it will be 
necessary to increase or decrease the "clearance." Creep clear-
ance· is the space between the face of the two Dogs when the 
Stepping Dog is held under pressure. To adjust this clearance, 
unlock the lock nut at the tail of the Rocker and move the 
"Creep Adjusting Screw.. in the elongated slot. 
Wrench 
ST 40023 can be used for this adjustment and no parts need be 
removed to make the adjustment. Always check the condition 
of the dogs when the escapement is either ··in" or "out .. of the 
machine. 
B. The Dogs should be positioned to the Starwheel so that 
the edge of the Fixed Dog shows slightly above the Starwheel 
Tooth and the Stepping Dog clears the bottom of the Starwheel 
Tooth. This adjustment is made by the Rocker Limit Bracket 
Adjusting Screw. If the Dogs are too low in relation to the 
Starwheel, the touch becomes heavy as the Rocker is forced 
to pull the Rocker Limit Bracket in tripping. If the Dogs are 
too high in relation to the Starwheel. the Escapement will 
cause the machine to pile.

U-BAR LINK L. H. 
U-BAR SUSPENSION BKT. L. H. 
U-BAR HANGER 
1. As in the standard front stroke typewriter, the 
Universal Bar actuates         Escapement Rocker, 
causing the trip. Forming, twisting or bending of 
the Universal Bar will result in maladjustment and 
invite serious trouble. Adjustments to the Universal 
Bar mechanism should be confined to actual re-
quirement in order to prevent throwing the mech-
anism into a bind. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: The main difficulty with 
machines in the field is that the two . ends of the 
U-Bar are out of parallel, for one reason or another, 
causing the typewriters on one side to trip farther 
away from the platen than the other. 
A. 
Uniform Trip Adjustment: 
( 1 ) U-Bar Ends out of Parallel: Trip not uniform: 
(a) 
Spring U-Bar Suspension Bracket on side 
of early "tripping (bars tripping too far from platen) 
downward and simultaneously spring the Bracket 
un the opposite side upward. This adjustment should 
even the trip on the ends of the U-Bar. If the bars 
in the Center trip nearer the Platen, after the ends 
are paralleled, it is necessary to move the U-Bar 
rearward, which may be done by positioning the 
U-Bar Link Center to the rear in its elongated slot 
in the center bracket of the Top Plate. 
(b) · The U-Bar Links, L. H., R. H., and Center 
are installed in elongated slots and in extreme cases 
it may be necessary to reposition all three links to 
parallel the U-Bar. 
(2) 
Trip Adjustment Sequence: Do not at-
tempt adjustment until Impression is Set (See Im-
pression) which positions actions uniformly in rela-
tion to the U-Bar. 
(a) 
U-Bar Trip is set with Trip Adj. Nut, 
after loosening Lock Nut. Be sure to tighten Lock 
Nut after adjusting. 
(b) 
.060" must be correct. 
( c) 
Position Pressure Indicator at Zero (handle 
against Stop Screw).

pa per ( 4 sheets inserted). 
Caution: If there is too much trip on the U-Bar, 
skipping will occur when an operator follows 
through heavily on the keys. 
B. 
Service Troubles: 
( 1) 
U-Bar Hangs Up1 Causes: 
(a) 
U-Bar Pivots too tight. 
(b) 
U-Bar Hanger binding on Key lever 8 or J. 
( c) 
U-Bar Hanger positioned causing Escape-
ment Connecting Link to bind on Tabulator Key-
lever. 
( d) 
Escapement Connecting Link binding on 
Space Keylever, Shift Keylever Shaft or positioned 
against the side of the hole in the Escapement 
Rocker. 
( e) 
Rocker binding on its Pivots. 
( f) 
Saddle of an action not over the U-Bar. 
(2) 
Trip too slow: If trip is too slow, blurring 
of letters will be prominent as the Carriage will move 
at the same time the type contacts the Platen. Trip 
must take place before the type actually contacts the 
Platen. If an individual action trips too slow and 
the Impression is Set, take the action out of machine 
and peen the saddle so that the Saddle will contact 
the U-Bar sooner. Care must be taken in this opera-
tion. When the action has been returned to ma-
.::hine, after peening the saddle, the Impression of that 
action and the other action held by the same action 
clamp must be rechecked. 
(3) 
Trip too fast: 
If one action trips faster 
than the rest (farther from platen), take action out 
of machine and file a little from the saddle so that 
the saddle does not contact the U-Bar so soon. All 
Action Saddles MUST be over the U-Bar for ma-
chine to operate properly. 
Extreme care must be 
taken to prevent filing too much from the saddle.

BACKSPACE MECHANISM. 
1. 
The Back Space Mechanism. because of its 
simplicity, develops very few mechanical failures. 
It is important that •the linkage be free and that all 
screws are tight. The Back Space Dog should be 
clear of the Starwheel Teeth when the Back Space 
Keylever is inactive. and the dog should rest against 
the Guide Screw with all the slack taken up in the 
slot by the return spring tension. The Back Space 
Dog is the same on both the 10 Pitch and 12 Pitch 
machines, having escapements equipped with the 
knee action. 
Machines not equipped with Knee 
Action have a special dog for each pitch. 
14 and 
16 pitch machines require special Starwheels and 
Back Space Dogs on all standard Noiseless       chines.

2. 
ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. Back Space Dog: 
( 1 ) If the Back Space Dog is not clear of the 
Starwheel teeth, press down on the Back Space 
Keylever, forcing the le:ver down past its normal 
stop position. 
T his will force the Dog from the 
Starwheel. If the Back Space Keylever is forced 
down too far, the Back Space Keylever will have too 
much up/down play and will hit on the Shift      lever when back spacing. To remove this_play, hold 
the Back Space Keylever in an upward position 
with the thumb at the bend below the Key top while 
forcing the rear end of the Keylever upward by 
applying pressure on a heavy screwdriver inserted 
under the rear end of the keylever. 
This will 
shorten the throw and remove the up/down play 
from the keylever. 
Check Back Space Dog for 
clearance with Starwheel teeth, after forming the 
Back Space Keylever. 
( 2) 
Overthrowing: 
The 
Backspacer 
should 
never overthrow (skip) whether operaited fast or 
slow. If overthrowing occurs, shift the Escapement 
Rocker slightly (usually to the left, facing the     chine from the rear ). 
Sometimes the Back Space 
Dog may be formed a little to make the correction. 
The Back Spacer should back space approximately 
1 )0. spaces when the Back Space Keylever is fully 
depressed.

MARGIN RELEASE 
MARGIN RELEASE. 
1. 
Tracing the action of the Margin Release Key-
lever, it ·will be noted that the Margin Release Key-
lever limits on the Down Stop of the Key lever Comb 
(upper). 
Following the assembly through, it will 
be seen that when the front end of the Margin 
Release Keylever is moved downward, the rear of 
the lever is raised, moving the Margin Release Shaft 
upward to the limit of the Margin Release Limit 
Bracket of the Key lever Comb (lower), which is 
adjustable. 
On the end of the Margin Release 
Shaft is the Margin Release Trunion of the C/T 
held in place by a screw on the Margin Release 
Trunion Bracket. The Margin Release Lever throws 
rearward when the Margin Release Keylever is 
depressed. 
The Trunion of the Margin Release 
lever of the C/T operates on Pivot Screws, it being 
very important that there is no play at the Pivot 
Screws. The Margin Release must be free from 
side to side-pivot screws too tight will cause bind. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. Margin Release Trunion Pivots: To remove 
play: 
Unlock the Lock Nut of the Lower Pivot 
Screw, making adjustment to eliminate up/down 
play at the pivots but the Margin Release Trunion 
pivots freely on the Pivots. Excessive play on these 
pivots will cause the Margin Release lever to throw 
rearward when the left Margin Stop is thrown 
against the Margin Release Lever. 
B. 
Margin Release: The Margin Release (lever) 
must not rest against the C/T in the rear but must 
set squarely against the plate of the C/T to elim-
inate rock when the Margin Stop contacts it. The 
position of the Margin Release is controlled mostly 
by positioning the Margin Release Limit Bracket 
(lower Key lever Comb) and positioning the Mar-
gin Release in or out in relaition to the Margin Stops 
by the Set Screw holding the Margin Release Trun-
ion to the Margin Release Shaft. If the lever is 
"in" too far, the lever will catch on the Margin Stops 
and the Carriage may not be readily moved. The 
Margin Release must be formed to properly posi-
tion the lever to the C/T. If there is no play 
between the Margin Release and the C/T, the 
Line Lock will not be permitted to release as the 
Margin Release (lever) will limit or hang up on the 
C/T before the Line Lock has a chance to release. 
This will show up especially when the Line Lock 
is locked and it is necessary to back space to make 
a correction. The Back Space will operate but the 
Line Lock will not release. 
C.

( 1) 
Improper clearance between the Margin 
Release and the L. H. Margin Stop. 
( 2)

L. H. MARGIN ADJUSTMENT. 
1. 
The Left Hand Margin is the setting between 
the L. H. Margin Stop and the Margin Release 
Lever of the C/T. 
This setting must be made 
before adjusting the Tabulator mechanism or the 
Line Lock. If the Tabulator is not in adjustment 
and the machine has been in use for quite awhile, 
always check the Left Margin before moving the 
Tab. Rack as the L. H. Margin clearance becomes 
greater as the machine is used. 
2. 
ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. 
Position the Carriage so that the L. H. Mar-
gin Stop is against the Margin Release Lever of 
the C/T. The clearance between the Margin Re-
lease and the L. H. Margin Stop should be between 
.010" and .015". 
Check 6 o'clock position before 
adjusting L. H. Margin. 
B. 
Facing machine from the rear, L. H. Margin 
is adjusted by loosening locking screw and tmning 
Eccentric until proper clearance is set. 
Lock the 
Locking Screw securely after proper clearance is 
adjusted. The Left Hand Margin Adjusting Eccen-
tric is located on the left end of the Feed Rack 
(facing machine from rear). 
( 1 ) 
The small Plate that the Eccentric sets in 
must be square and pulled toward the rear of ma-
chine so that the Eccentric Plate does not interfere 
with the lifting of the Feed Rack when the Feed 
Rack is released. 
( 2) 
High point of the Eccentric must never face 
the front of machine. 
(3) 
L. H. Margin must not overthrow. 
The 
Margin Release of .the C/T should be so formed 
that it does not rock when the Margin Stop is 
pressed against the Margin Release of the C/T. 
It should have a little play between itself and the 
back of the C/T and be free both in side operation 
and "in and out" operation. The Margin Release 
must not protrude to the extent that it stops the 
Carriage in returning the Carriage after the Mar-
gin has been released. 
(The Margin Stops are 
tapered and the Margin Release of the C/T must 
not project past this taper).

downward until it limi.ts on the Tab. Comb Filler. 
When the Tab. Keylever is depressed, the end of 
the Keylever is raised. picking up the Tab. Blade 
of the C/T. The Tab. Blade picks up the Tab. 
Arm of the Escapement (which functions to hold 
the Tab. Brake from the Friction Wheel of the Es-
capement}, releasing the Tab. Brake to contact 
Friction Wheel. and continuing to kick the Fixed 
Dog from the Starwheel, freeing the Carriage, with 
only the Tab. Brake providing slight friction, until 
the Tabulator Blade contacts a stop which has been 
set on the Tabulator Rack. When the Tabulator 
Keylever is released, the Fixed Dog again engages 
the Starwheel tooth and the Tab. Escape. Arm, 
which is under heavy spring pressure, contacts the 
Brake Release Screw on the Brake Bracket and 
pulls ithe brake from the friction wheel. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: When adjusting the Tabu-
lator, it is necessary to adjust the levers first. The 
Tab. Blade and the Clear Key operate between two 
adjustable brackets and these brackets (on the rear 
side of the C/T) are adjusted so that the Tab. 
Blade and Clear Keys of the C/T set straight and 
levers work freely with a very minimum of play. 
The Tab. Set and Clear Keylevers must also be 
free and the levers in their proper position in the 
Lower Tab. Comb. Their position in the Lower 
Tab. Comb (machine on its back), clear Keylevers 
in the first slot from the left; Tab. Blade in the 
second slot from the left and Set Keys in the first

A. Tabulator Keylever: Depress the Tab. Key-
lever, noting the position of the Tab. Blade in 
relation .to the Tab. Rack. The Tab. Blade should 
travel to within l /32" of the Tab. Rack. The ad-
justment is made on the Tab. Keylever by screwing 
"in" on the Adjusting Screw of the Tabulator Key-
lever itself. All Tabulator Stops of the Tab. Rack 
should be "in". 
B. 
Clear Keylever: With some Tabulator Stops 
set on each end of the Tab. Rack, adjust the screw 
of the Clear Keylever until the Clear Key of the 
CIT is held towards the stops that are set. The 
Clear Key of the C/T should nearly touch the Stops 
when the clear key lever is idle (not held de-
pressed). 
Depressing the Clear Key Lever, the 
Clear Key of the C/T will probably ride hard 
against the Tabulator Rack. Adjust the Screw on 
the back of the Clear Keylever of the C/T until 
the Clear Key of the C/ T barely misses the Tab. 
Rack with the Stops "in" (not set). The Clear 
Key should knock in all stops when this adjustment 
is set properly. 
C. Set Keylever: The Set Key of the machines 
having the Shift Spring Arms welded to the Shift 
Rail are adjusted with the screw on the Set Key-
lever itself and are adjusted just to . take the slack 
out of the linkage (see drawing). 
On the old 
style machines, having the Set Key as part of the 
C/T. the adjustment is made with the same screw 
but the Set Keylever of C/T should be brought 
forward until the Set Key Finger nearly touches 
the stops of the Tab. Rack when the Stops are .. in". 
The finger has to clear the Stops on both capitals 
and normals. 
On the new style, as indicated in 
the drawing. the Set key Finger rests on the rail 
in its rest position. If the Set Keylever is not ad-
justed properly the Shifts will hold up or drag. 
D. Tabulator Trip: Tab. Arm of the Escape-
ment formed to regulate the Tab. Trip, the Trip 
should take place just before the Tab. Keylever 
limits on the Tab. Comb Filler. 
E. Tabulator Brake: 
Back off the Brake Re-
lease Screw and check the Tab. Brake without 
release. 
The Brake should be sufficient to slow 
down the Carriage but not tie up the Carriage 
Adjust the Brake Screw to regulate the Tab. Brake. 
F. Brake Release: Adjust (screw "in") on the 
Brake Release until the Brake Release Screw works 
in and out slightly when the Tab. Keylever is de-
pressed and released. 
The Dog may be partially 
disengaged from the Starwheel if the Release Screw 
is "in" too far. There should be a little play between 
the Tab. Escape. Arm and the Fixed Dog after the 
release has been set. If there is not enough release, 
there will be brake on the friction wheel in normal 
operation which will cause piling. 
G. 
Tabulator Rack: Check Left Margin before 
adjusting. Position the T ab. Rack so that the Tab. 
Blade will operate between all the Tab. Stops when 
they are set, without knocking "in" any of the stops. 
Lock all holding screws securely when the Rack has 
been positioned properly-no further adjustment of 
the Rack will be necessary. 
H. Set Key Finger: Adjust Tab. Rack before 
adjusting Set Key Finger. The Tab. Blade will stop 
the Carriage at any point at which the Set Key 
Finger sets a stop "out" when the Tabulator Key 
is depressed. If the Stop is set at 30 and in tabu-
lating the carriage stops at 29 or 31. the Set Key 
Finger has pushed out the wrong stop. Do not move 
the Tabulator Rack to make the correction. 
           tion the Set Key Finger to the correct stop. When 
the Set Key is set correctly the Stop that the Set 
Key knocks "out" should line up with the flat edge 
of the tapered Clear Key Lever of the C/ T.

Position the screwdriver behind 
the Bell Wire at the same location and spring the 
Bell Wire out slightly. Care must be taken in the 
Bell Wire adjustment as the wires are weak and 
break very easily. 
F . The Bell Wire can be formed slightly at 
the top to control the amount of spaces the Car-
riage will travel after the bell rings to the Line Lock. 
Note: The new style Bell Ringer does not have a 
striking ball. 
It is not necessary to remove the 
lower bracket to replace a bell wire. 
The upper 
bracket must be removed. 

SPACE BAR

1. 
The Space Key must be free on its pivots and 
must have sufficient tension on the return spring to 
prevent spacing from vibration in shifting. 
The 
Trip is regulated so that the Escapement Rocker is 
permitted to fully return in its limit bracket and the 
Space Key Interlock adjusted properly. The pur-
pose of the Space Key Interlock is to lock the alpha-
bet Keylevers while the operator has the Space key 
depressed. Since the Space Bar is operated by the 
thumb, which is sluggish in action as compared with 
the fingers, quite often the Space Bar is not per-
mitted to restore upward to permit the last part of 
the escapement of the carriage to take place before 
the operator strikes the alphabet keys for the first 
letter of the next word following the space bar op-
eration. When this occurs, the first two letters of 
Cl word following the Space Bar operation may not 
be evenly spaced. If the Interlock is functioning 
properly and the operator is slow in getting the 
thumb off the Space Bar and strikes the alphabet 
key, the keylever will strike the U niversal Vibrator 
Bar (top) and the bottom of the Universal Vibrator 
Bar ·will contact the top of the Space Key Interlock 
Lever, which, in turn, will speed up the return of 
the Space Key to its normal rest position, allowing 
the last half of the escapement drop to take place 
before the type strikes the printing point. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. 
Space Bar Height. There should be approxi-
mately 7 / 16" space between the top of the Space 
Bar and the bottom of the keytops of the bottom 
bank of Keylevers. Form the lips of the Space Bar 
Up-Stop bracket to get proper height. 
Both up-
stops should limit on the Up-Stop felt at the same 
time.

Space Key Pivot Adjustment: There should 
be no play on Space Key Pivot Screws, yet should 
be free without return spring tension. Space Levers 
should clear Keylever comb. 
D. Space Key Connecting Link (Pull Wire ) 
must clear all parts and float in the hole in the

Rocker should be checked for freen-ess on its pivots 
and for excessive play. Adjust Rocker Return

too much tension will cause heavy touch. 
F. Space Trip: The Space Trip should take 
place about 1 / 16" before Space Bar limits on down 
stops. Adjustment is made with the small nuts on 
the rear end of the Connecting Link. 
Too much 
travel of the Space Bar to its down stop will result 
in the Rocker being held forward when the Space 
Bar is in its rest position and skipping in both the 
Space Key operation and Keylever operation is 
likely. 
G.

has about 1 / 32" further travel before it contacts 
the Interlock Arm. If the Interlock is too close to 
the Universal V ibrator Bar, the Universal Vibrator 
Bar will limit on the Interlock Arm when a Keylevcr

LINE LOCK 
LINE LOCK. 
1. 
In tracing the action · and movement of parts 
as indicated in the drawing, it will be determined 
essential for ( 1) The L H. Margin to be adjusted 
properly; (2) R. H. Margin Stop comes to the 
Margin Release Lever of C/T. space once: (3) 
Margin Release of the C/T moves to the left, pivot· 
ing on the Margin Release Trunion; (1) Attached 
to the Margin Release Lever is the Margin Release 
Throw Arm to which the Line Lock Pull Wire is 
attached. When the Pull Wire moves back, the 
Line Lock Bail moves back to contact the hook of 
the keylever. (5) When the Margin Release Key-
lever is released, the Margin Release Trunion 
Spring, located on the Margin Release Trunion, 
pulls the Margin Release of the C/T back to its 
original position, restoring the Line Lock Bail to 
inactive position. 
, 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. The correct setting for a 10 pitch machine 
is for the R. H. Margin Stop to come to the Mar-
gin Release Lever of the C/T, space once and the 
Keylevers should lock on the Line Lock Bail. If the 
Line Lock locks too soon, position the Throw Arm 
on the Margin Release Lever of the C/T slightly 
forward. This will cause the Line Lock bail to set 
forward from the Keylevers and the Line Lock 
will not lock as soon. The Line Lock must be set 
so that the Keylevers clear the bail when the pres-
sure indicator is backed off. When the C/ T is 
backed off the Line Lock throw is automatically 
shortened. If the Line Lock Bail does not lock 
soon enough, position the throw arm slightly to the 
rear and shorten the throw of the Line Lock. Pres-
sure Indicator should be positioned at the Zero 
Position when adjusting the Line Lock. 
B. The 12 pitch setting must be made so that 
the locking takes place in the following manner: 
The R. H. Margin Stop comes to the Margin Re-
lease Lever of the C/T. space once and the Key-
levers should not touch the bail, space a second 
time and the Keylevers should all lock on the bail. 
The throw is set the same as the I 0 pitch machine. 
C. Line Lock Bail: The Line. Lock Bail may 
become bent and will not lock the keys all the way 
across the Keyboard, in which event the bail must 
be straightened. 
This can he done by springing 
in on one end with a screwdriver and out with an-
other to twist the bail into a straightened position. 
The Bail must be free on its Pivots with a very 
minimum of side play; the Spring must be in good 
condition and the hole through the Bail, holding the 
Pull Wire, must not be worn or elongated. 
( 1 ) 
To Remove Line Lock: 
(a) Disconnect the U-Bar Trip Connecting Link 
from the U-Bar Hanger Bracket. 
Remove the 
U-Bar Hanger Bracket. 
(b) Remove the Tabulator Set and Clear Key 
Levers and the Upper Tabulator Comb (above the 
keyboard). 
(c) Loosen the Pivot Screw of the U-Bar and 
position the U-Bar upward so that the action saddles 
will not drop off the U-Bar. 
( d) Loosen the Set Screw of the L. H. Line 
Lock Pivot Screw and slide the Pin out of the Bail 
(but not out of the casting). 
(e) Disconnect the Line Lock Pull Wire from 
the Margin Release Throw Arm, .turn the Pull Wire 
sideways so that the Pull Wire will pass under the 
Margin Release Shaft and work the Line Lock to 
the front of the machine and out. 
(2) 
To Replace Line Lock: Reverse above pro-
cedure, sliding the Pull Wire between the figure 9 
and comma keylevers. Proceed with caution. Al-
ways recheck the U-Bar trip after replacing a bail 
in this manner.

RIBBON FEED 
RIBBON FEED. 
1. 
The Ribbon is motivated directly by the Spring 
Drum to the Ribbon Drive Shaft. It is imperative 
that the gears be set correctly and that the Pawls 
of the Spring Drum be in good condition. The rib-
bon spools are either "right" or "left" and may not 
be interchanged. The spool can be identified by 
position of slot on either side of the Tripping Lever. 
If the slot is on the left side of the Tripping Lever, 
it is the "left" spool and should be placed on the 
left side of the machine (facing from front); if the 
slot is on the right side of the Tripping Lever, it 
is the "right" spool. 
The Spool pictured in the 
center of the drawing is a "left" spool and should 
be positioned on the L. H. side of the machine. In 
replacing a ribbon, it should be placed on the "right" 
spool and threaded through the Ribbon Vibrator to 
the "left" spool with the little clip (at the end of 
a new ribbon) positioned so that the ribbon will 
not slip out of the slot when it is ready to reverse. 
2. ADJUSTMENTS: 
A. Cams: The Cams must be tightly held by 
their screws and so positioned on the Ribbon Drive 
Shaft that the high point of the cams both face the 
center of the machine, but, the high points must be 
on opposite sides of the shaft in order for the revers-
ing action to take place (see drawing). 
B. 
Detent Gear: The Detent Gear is set at a 
position approximately Yi" from the high point of 
the Cam. The distance from the Cam to the Detent 
Gear completely controls the reversing operation 
as far as spacing is concerned, with the Tripping 
Levers and the Spool Plungers free to contact the 
Cams. Detent Arm Stud must be safe in the Slot 
of Detent Gear. 
C. 
Driving Gear: 
The Driving Gear on the 
left side of the Driving Shaft must be meshed prop-
erly in the Gear of the Spool Shaft. This is set 
after the Detent Gear has been positioned in a posi-
tive reverse position. This Gear is meshed so that 
it is in safe mesh to the Spool Shaft Gear, yet not 
too deep to cause the Gears to grind when turning 
the Driving Shaft by hand. 
D. Ribbon Spools: Ribbon Spools must be in 
their proper position; the bushing must be completely 
set in the Top Plate and the looped end of the 
Push Type Spring should set on the casting. The 
up/down play in the spools should be from .009" 
to .012". The Spools must turn freely. Never oil 
the plunger Shafts. The only lubrication needed 
is a little oil on the BEARING Points of the Spool. 
A little grease may be used to help silence the gear 
operation but use it sparingly. 
Adjust the small 
collar of the Spool Shaft to a point where the spring 
will hold up the weight of a full ribbon plus the 
weight of a spool cover. 1.41 oz. weight gauge can 
be used. 
E. Ribbon Casings: Ribbon Casings should not 
be securely tightened until the Spool Bushing is set-
ting down completely on the Top Plate. The Cas-
ings have elongated slots and should be positioned 
so that the lower cut out of the casing is to the 
center of the machine and positioned so that the 
ribbon unwinding from the spool will pull toward 
the front of the machine slightly before the ribbon 
goes to the Vibrator. 
F. Spring Drum: 
The same Spring Drum is 
used on 11" and 12" carriages. A stronger spring 
is needed for the longer carriages. A and B model 
( 11" and 12") machines have no stamping on the 
Spring Drum Cover. C-D is stamped on the 14" 
and 18" carriages Drum Covers and E-F-G on the 
Covers of the longer carriages. 
( 1 ) To mesh the Spring Drum to the Ribbon 
Shaft Gear, it may be necessary to loosen the Screws 
of the Ratchet Gears and reposition the Spring 
Drum Shaft Gear to the Driving Shaft Gear. Care 
must be taken to determine that the Ratchet Gears 
are set to prevent binding the Spring Drum in oper-
ation and that the Gears are not set to permit 
holding pawls of the Spring Drum to drop behind 
the Ratchet Gears. 
(2) 
To wind a Spring Drum, after the Draw-
band has been connected to the Drum and Carriage, 
unlock the Locking Nut on the rear of the drum 
(through hole of Rear Cover}. 
Screw "in" on 
the slotted screw of the Nut until proper amount 
of tension is applied, then lock the Lock Nut. A 
loose Lock Nut will place a drag on the Spring Drum 
and cause the Carriage to operate sluggishly. 
(3) 
To release tension from the Spring Drum: 
Unlock the Lock Nut on the back of the Drum and 
ratchet the tension off the spring. Short cuts may 
permit the spring to release from the pin of the 
arbor, inside the cover, necessitating disassembly to 
connect. 
( 4) 
To Remove Spring Drum: 
Relax Main-
spring tension. 
Remove the Screw holding the 
Spring Drum to the rear Upper Frame Brace (on 
the underside of the Frame Brace. directly below 
the center of the Spring Drum Bracket) . Remove 
the two (2) Center Tie Holding Springs (See Cen-
ter T ie). Remove the six ( 6) screws holding the 
rear cover to the Frame. Remove the Rear Cover. 
Remove Spring Drum to the rear. 
To replace: 
Reverse this procedure. Mainspring tension should 
be approximately I Yi pounds on 11" and 12" 
machines. 
( 5) If the Spring Drum Gear of the Drive Shaft 
is meshed to the wrong side of the Spring Drum 
Shaft Gear, the Ribbon movement will operate back-
wards, opposite its correct direction. The Spring 
Drum Gear of the Drive Shaft should be positioned 
to the left side 6f the Spring Drum Shaft Gear. 
When the Gear is meshed to the correct side of 
the Spring Drum Shaft Gear, the Ribbon Crank 
wi11 turn clockwise.

C. 
Position the Bichrome Switch in Stencil posi-
tion (the Universal Vibrator Bar Link should line 
up with the center of the Stencil slot in the draw-
ing). Depress the "B" keylever, holding down to 
its full travel. 
Adjust the Space Bar Inter-Lock 
Arm of the Space Bar with the Adjusting Eccentric 
of the Interlock Arm (See Space Bar Drawing) to 
a position where the Universal Vibrator has an 
additional 1/32 to 1/4 inch to the Interlock Arm 
( B Key lever held depressed). This will prevent 
"bumper" of the Interlock Arm in normal typing-
which would cause a spongy touch. 
D. 
Position the Bichrome Stop Bracket so the 
Bichrome travels an equal disance on each side of 
the Stencil Slot when shifting the Bichrome from 
black to red position. 
E. Check the throw of the Universal Vibrator 
Bar Link, above the Vibrator Shaft Arm front. 
The Link should have the same travel above the 
Vibrator Shaft Arm front on the black side that 
it has on the red side. If the travel is unequal then 
the Vibrator Shaft Arm Front is tilted. To level 
the Arm, use Tools ST-40077 and ST-40078 and 
form the VIBRATOR SHAFT ARM REAR. Never 
form the Vibrator Shaft Arm Front to level the Front 
Arm. It may be necessary to increase or decrease 
the amount of "throw" that the Universal Vibrator 
Link travels in relation to the Vibrator Shaft Arm 
Front (reach) for if the clearance is not sufficient 
it will not be possible to switch from the Stencil 
Position to Black or Red and a spongy touch will 
also develop. If the "travel" is too high. the Rib-
bon will not cover properly. 
Form the Universal 
Vibrator Bar at the point that the link is attached 
to the Universal Vibrator Bar. Make certain that 
the Link is free on the shouldered screw after form-
ing the U-Vib. Bar. 
F. Position the Bichrome on the Black position 
(handle of the Bichrome will be to the right). 
Depress a Keylever. 
The end of the Vibrator 
Shaft Arm Front should just touch the lip of the 
Bichrome. 
If not, spring Bichrome Lip "up" to 
meet the Vib. Shaft Arm Front. If the Bichrome 
is formed too high, a "bumper" action will occur. 
If this adjustment is not properly made, bleeding will 
occur in black if the keylevers are struck hard, or 
a bumper action will occur. 
G. 
Striking the Yi.Yi.Yi.Yi.Yi.Yi. the Ribbon should 
cover all but the very tip of the 1. 
Tip the 
Vibrator Bracket with a pair of pliers at the point 
directly over the R. H. Balance Shaft End Plate 
to get the desired results. 
Never tip the bracket 
to the extent that the Vibrator sets below the Vi-
brator Guide Slot on the Pinion Shaft Bracket. 
H. If one or two characters bleed after this 
procedure has been followed, then the lips of the 
U-Vib.-Bar must be formed for the individual char-
acters. The Ribbon Vibrator should have no further 
travel in red when a keylever is depressed.

The Scale should clear the Platen so 
that one sheet of paper will pass between the Platen 
and the Scale. 
It is essential that the Platen be 
removed. when forming the Scale toward the Platen, 
so that the Scale will not become "kinked" causing 
it to contact the Paper Finger Stop Screw which 
will bind the Carriage in spacing. 
The correct 
Scale should be used in order that the lines will 
line up with the letters, i. e., 10 pitch scale for 10 
pitch machine, etc.

KEYLEVER AND TYPE ACTION 
KEYLEVER AND TYPE ACTION. 
1. 
Keylevers: All Keylevers are numbered and, 
if removed, must be returned to their proper posi-
tion in the machine. The Keylever Clips and the 
Action Pull Link Studs of the Keylevers are stag-
gered in order that the Actions will perform more 
efficiently. If an action is placed in the wrong 
position, the Keylever of the misplaced action will 
travel approximately ,!4" to Yi" further than the 
Keylever next to it when the two Keylevers are 
held down simultaneously. 
It will also affect the 
Ribbon Throw of the Keylevers attached to the 
misplaced actions. If a Keylever is misplaced the 
lever will not conform with the Keyboard, the Clip 
and Action Pull Link Stud will not be in the right 
position and the Action connected to that keylever 
will be very spongy. 
The Keylevers all have notches for a slight indi-
vidual tension to a single .keylever. To increase or 
decrease the tension on all the Keylevers, adjust 
the Nuts on the Touch Adjusting Screw. Unlock 
the Lock Nut and apply more tension on the screw 
to increase the tension; back off on the nuts to 
decrease the tension. 
Unless the machine is spe-
cial ( 86 or 88 character keyboard) the first and 
last slots of the Keylever Combs will not have 
Keylevers in them and a filler washer will be in 
the first and last slots of the Keylever Comb lower. 
The Margin Release Keylever is in the last slot of 
the Keylever Comb Upper in standard Keyboard 
machines but a special Margin Release and Back 
Space and Margin Release Keylever must be used 
in an 88 character keyboard machine. 
If the 
machine is 86 character keyboard. the Back Spacer 
or Margin Release Lever would be special on the 
side that the extra Keylever is used. The Fulcrum 
for the Keylevers should always be locked in oper-
ation. It is locked when the handle points directly 
at the table or desk when the machine is in normal 
operating position. 
If a machine has been dis-
mantled, make certain that all Keylever Clips and 
Levers are clear of each other and that the Levers 
are all free as soon as the tension springs are 
hooked up, as the Keylevers are extremely hard 
to free up when the machine is completely assem-
bled. It is imperative that all Keylevers be free. 
The old style key tops may be replaced with 
the new style key tops by filling the slots of the 
new style key tops with Acetone until the Keytop 
softens and then press the Keytops into position. 
When the Acetone dries (evaporates) the Keytop 
will be tight. The old style Keylevers (key tops 
had metal clamp to hold to levers) are thicker 
than than the new style levers and had no limit 
stop. 
By using Acetone the new style Keytops 
can be put on without cracking the Keytops. Do 
not get Acetone on the face of the Keytop. Ace-
tone can be purchased at any drug store without 
prescription. If the top is broken on a keylever 
equipped with keyrings. replace it with a new style 
Keytop, place the old designator on the Keytop 
and replace the ring to make the Keyboard uni-
form. 
2. 
Dead Keys: (Spanish Accents). If a dead key 
is required on only one half of an .action, then a 
special "dead key" action must be used. This action 
will permit one key lever to trip the Universal Bar 
while the other keylever of the same action will not 
trip. These are usually used on machines requiring 
Spanish Keyboards. The exact position of the ac-
tion plus the number of the Keylever that is to be 
"dead" must be supplied when ordering "dead key" 
actions. 
3. 
To Remove a Type Action: It is necessary to 
disconnect the two Pull Links of the Action to be 
removed from the Keylevers; remove the Type Bar; 
Remove the Action Hanger Clamp; remove the ac-
tion, tipping it slightly down and to the front and 
out after the action frame has cleared the front 
segment. 
It is unnecessary to remove any other 
parts either to remove or replace a type action. 
Reverse the procedure to replace the Action.

I. The Typebars are not numbered, but care must 
be taken to make certain that all bars are replaced 
to their proper position. The bars and segment slots 
must be free of oil or grease. The Typebar can 
be removed and replaced without removing any 
other parts. To remove a bar: Spread the action 
links slightly with a hook and slip the Links from 
the Type Bar Stud. Slip the Center Link from the 
Type Bar Stud; spread the Clip of the Type Bar 
Arm and release the Type Bar Arm from the Bell-
crank of the Action and remove the Typebar. To 
replace the Typebar: Position Typebar in Comb, 
connect Type Bar Arm to Action Bellcrank; push 
the action holding the Typebar next to the one being 
inserted, slightly forward, to permit the T ype Bar 
Stud to clear the typehead; then let the T ype Bar 
fall back into the Comb. Replace the Center Link 
making certain that it floats on the Type Bar Stud. 
The Center Link must not lay against the Type-
bar or Action Links for freeness of operation. Re-
place Rear Action Links to the Typebar. 
Links 
must not be too loose on the Stud and must not 
be cramped. If the Action Links are cramped, the 
Links will not be free on their pivot. One Link 
usually sets slightly higher than the other, level the 
links. 
2. To position Type in the Type Guide: adjust 
the Eccentrics on the side of the Actions. 
The 
Eccentric on the right hand side of the action adjusts 
the Type up or down on the top half of the Typebar. 
Tighten the Lock Nut after adjusting. The R. H. 
Eccentric (Upper half of bar) should always be 
adjusted FmST, as it affects the position of the 
Action Bellcrank and will throw the adjustment off 
on the lower part of the bar. For example, take the 
1-M Typebar. If the M (lower type head) is high 
or low, first check the position of the I Typehead. 
If the I is all right in alignment, adjust the M with 
the L. H. Eccentric of the Action. If. on the same 
bar, the I is high or low as well as the M, in align-
ment, adjust the R. H. Eccentric first to bring the 
I in line, then check the M. The adjustment for the 
"I" could very easily have pulled the M into posi-
tion also. If not, adjust the "M" with the L. H . 
Eccentric. A very simple rule to remember is "to 
always adjust the Upper Type of any action First," 
then always check the lower type. 
Adjusting the 
lower type will not throw off the adjustment of 
the Upper Type of the same bar but if the Upper 
Type is adjusted it will definitely affect the lower 
type of the same bar's position. 
The Type Bar 
Arms must line up with the Bellcrank for best op-
eration. 
A. SLUGGISH TYPE ACTION: If a slug-
gish typing action occurs, use the following proce-
dure to locate the trouble: 
( 1 ) 
Check Rear Action Links-must he free on 
stud and pivot. 
( 2) 
Disconnect Action Links, check Center Link 
for floating on Type Bar Stud. 
( 3) 
Slide Type Bar back and forth in the Type-
bar Comb. Position Type Bar Arm in relation to 
Bellcrank if necessary. If T ypehar binds in Comb, 
straighten Bar. 
( 1) 
Connect Rear Action Links. 
( 5) 
Disconnect Type Bar Arm from Bellcrank; 
hold Arm from Bellcrank and the Action held in 
forward position, test Keylever and Bellcrank action 
and free up if necessary. 
( 6) 
Connect Type bar Arm to Action Bellcrank. 
3. TYPE: Each Type head is bevelled for its 
particular position in relation to the Type Guide. 
Always note the exact side of the Typebar that the 
Type head was removed from in changing type. It 
is very much advisable to change one Type head 
at a time to insure that they are in their correct 
place. Typebar Arms come in "rights" and "lefts". 
and "right" and "left" offset, and should be checked 
carefully to see that the correct ones are used in 
replacing. The offset Arms are for the two Center 
T ypebars to aid in clearing the C/ T Connecting 
Link. Brass rivets are used on the I, 2, 21, 22 Bars 
only in replacing Type heads.

TYPE GUIDE 
THE TYPE GUIDE: 
The type guide becomes worn from constant typ-
ing use and must some time be replaced. This can 
be done without a type aligning gauge but it is 
more accurate if aligned with the gauge. If the 
type gauge is not available-place the new guide on 
the guide screws and adjust the screws until they 
barely hold the guide. 
Depress the "h" keylever 
and hold the action forward in the guide, position 
the guide for height on the h action. 
Release the 
"h" action and depress the X keylever, hold the 
action in its forward position at the guide and align 
the guide so that the X type head slides lightly off 
the right side of the guide in the opening. Release 
the X action and depress the Period keylever and 
hold the action forward. 
The type head should 
contact the guide on the left side of the opening 
and- slide through the opening. 
Lock the Guide 
screws securely and then try other type for entering 
the guide. If the eccentrics have not been disturbed 
the majority of the type should enter the guide 
properly. The guide may move when locking the 
holding screws and it is important that a second 
check of type entering the guide properly is made 
before the eccentrics for raising or lowering type in 
the guide are disturbed. 
When using the guide gauge, remove the 7-H 
typebar and the 23-24 action. 
Remove the type 
comb upper. Remove the platen and paper trough. 
Back off on the pressure indicator. Shift to caps. 
Remove the old guide by loosening the 3 holding 
screws and lifting the guide upward. (On old style 
machines the guide screw holes were not made so 
that the guide could be removed in this manner, 
the guide screws had to be removed and it was 
necessary to remove the Shift Rail and Carriage 
to do this). Replace the old guide with a new one, 
draw the holding screws up until the screws hold 
only friction tight. 
Position the Guide Gauge so 
that the front of the gauge is inside the guide open-
ing, the back of the gauge is in the type action 
hanger slot, and the thin edge of the gauge Hes in the 
type bar segment lower. 
Place a sheet of light 
paper behind the guide. 
Hold the gauge flat on 
the rear slot of the top plate (type action hanger 
slot) and position the guide on the gauge so that 
no light shows above the top of the gauge in the 
guide. If there is any side play in the guide slot 
in relation to the gauqe, equalize the space on either 
side of the gauge. When the guide is positioned 
properly, lock the guide holding screws. Recheck 
the guide with the gauge to see that the guide has 
not shifted while being locked in place. The guide 
gauge should slide freely in the segment and through 
the guide with no light showing at the top of the 
gauge and equal spacing on either side of the gauge. 
Do not slide the guide gauge too far forward when 
setting as the segment, that the actions hang from 
at the bottom of the type segment lower. is often 
tapered close to the front. This gauge ( ST-40092) 
cannot be used on the model No. 6 Remington or 
the old style Underwood Noiseless. 
Use it only 
on machines where the action is suspended from the 
type bar segment. The Flat Top Underwood and 
the Model No. 6 Remington actions were fastend to 
a segment just in front of the center tie nose and 
only slightly above the center tie nose. It is not 
necessary to remove tne Carriage or rail when this 
gauge is used, unless the old style type guide that 
did not have the slotted screw holes is us·ed. 
The guide should be checked also to see that the 
type does not push through the guide farther at the 
bottom than the top. If so, lean the guide forward 
slightly (towards the platen). If the type pushes 
through farther at the top than the bottom of the 
guide, lean the guide towards the front of the ma-
chine slightly. If the guide is not correct in its 
in and out position when the distance from the 
bottom of the guide slot to the platen is .060" then 
the distance from the top of the guide will be 
more and the type will not strike the platen evenly. 
If the top of the guide is too close to the platen 
then the distance from the top of the guide will 
be set at .060" and the bottom of the guide will 
be over .060". 
This will show up on your im-
pressions. 
The print will be off feet. 
Always 
recheck the .060" clearance between the guide and 
platen after resetting or replacing a type guide.

ALIGNING NOTES FOR THE NOISELESS 
TYPEWRITER. 
This is a procedure that should help in the align-
ment of the .Noiseless typewriter. 
Much of the 
alignment of "service machines" can be accom-
plished by the eccentric adjustment on the actions 
but the entire procedure will be covered in these 
notes. 
The typewriter must be checked thoroughly for 
excessive play in the toggle linkage, center tie and 
shift rail. and carriage roller bracket and retainer. 
Excessive play in any of these places will cause an 
uneven writing line and an uneven motion from one 
end of the carriage to the other. The center tie 
must also be seated on its runway and must be 
adjusted so that it has no rock on the ends and no 
side play. There should be no side play on the 
balance shaft pivot screws or between the Balance 
Shaft and the Shift Rail Arms. Make sure Platen 
Locks are locked and adjusted properly. 
Check 
the motion. 
After checking the linkage etc., for excessive play 
then the .060" should be checked. There should 
be .060" between the platen and the Type Guide 
when the pressure indicator is against the Stop 
Screw. When the .060" is set properly back the 
Pressure Indicator off and check the machine for 
"on feet". If the machine is not "on feet" loosen 
the three ( 3) screws on the Balance Shaft end 
plate-(left side of the Balance Shaft) and adjust 
the Eccentric until the machine is On Feet. Check 
the "on feet" with the normal case. 
Tighten all 
screws after adjusting "on feet". 
Set the pressure indicator in a position at center 
or just a little to the left of center. 
"Strike off" 
for impression-Capitals first and normals directly 
underneath. This is done in order that a comparison 
can be made between capitals and normals. If the 
capitals print lighter than normals-shim back of the 
center Tie Retainer Plate. Two (2) shims of equal 
thickness are used and after shimming always reset 
the .060. The shims should be put behind the 
plate, at the top if the capitals are light and behind 
the Plate at the bottom if the normals are light. 
Shim until the capitals and normals appear to be 
the same. 
Never shim behinq the retainer plate 
for only one or two letters but only when the ma-
jority of letters vary between capital and normal. 
The .060 must be rechecked before "striking off'' 
the impression again. 
Put all type "on the guide" and take out noise. 
This is accomplished by adjusting the eccentrics 
on the actions. The Eccentric on the right side 
of an action adjusts the upper banks and the Eccen-
trics on the left side of the action adjusts the lower 
banks of the machines. 
Always adjust the right 
E ccentric before adjusting the left Eccentric as an 
adjustment of the right Eccentric changes the T ype 
Bar Arm position and will throw the lower bank 
letters of the same action off adjustment. After the 
upper bank is adjusted properly, lock the Lock Nut 
of the Eccentric and proceed to adjust the lower 
bank of the same action. It is extremely important 
that all Eccentrics are locked in their adjusted 
position.

Vvith the pressure indicator set slightly left of cen-
ter, set impressions eYenly on all type. Adjust the 
impression screws until the type prints as evenly as 
possible and a gray color on one sheet of paper. 
If the impression is too heavy, back the Impression 
Screw off until the type does not print, then screw 
the screw in, until the proper setting is made. Never 
get the proper color by backing off the screw-
alwa ys back off 'ti! it does not print, then screw 
back in, otherwise the action will shift after use. 
If the upper Characters of a type bar print light and 
the lower characters of the same bar print heavy, 
then the bar should be "blocked" or stretched. If 
this can not be accomplished for lack of a "block" 
then the bar can be "bit". The biting of a bar is 
done behind the type head on the bar itself and not 
on the type. There should be very little need for 
biting type on the noiseless machines as the factory 
<::et up is very rigid in that respect and your most 
common adjustment will be the eccentrics. 
If the characters of both upper and lower bank 
of the same bar are light on the top or bottom, then 
the type bar arm is elevated up or down. If the type 
prints light on top-elevate the arm up. 
If light 
on bottom, elevate the arm down. Always recheck 
the type for being in the Guide, after elevating. 
Occasionally there will be a bar that cannot be 
adjusted completely with the eccentric. 
In such 
cases it is necessary to bite the type head. T he bit-
ing is done above or below the type itself. There 
may be bars that have to be stoned to raise or 
lower properly in the guide without noise. The rule 
for biting or stoning can be summed up as follows: 
1. 
Bite upper bank up only. 
2. 
Bite lower bank down only. 
3. When upper bank high and type in the Guide 
freely, stone bottom of type for alignment. 
4. 
W hen lower bank is low and type in Guide 
Freeh'. stone top of type. 
After biting a bar- always check type for chok-
ing in the Guide. Stone type if the type chokes in 
the Guide after biting. 
Biting the type heads can be disastrous if care 
is not ta ken. Jf a type head is ruined by careless, 
haphazard biting, the machine may be held up in-
definitely. so extreme caution is necessary. 
T o bring out an individual ::haracter. if the other 
three characters of the same bar are printing prop-
zrly, bite the typebar itself behind the character 
that is required to be stretched or tilted. 
After the impression is properly set, then strike 
the entire keyboard off on 4 sheets of paper against

the letter X. first in capitals and then in normals 
underneath the capitals. This is the check for align-
ment of letters, and will show up all blurs. 
If the side spacing is off, then the type is not 
going into the guide properly. The type must slide 
into the guide by having the beveled edge of the 
type, strike the side of the guide before the type 
strikes the platen. Adjust the letters for height with 
the eccentrics of the actions. 
If the type is not entering the Guide properly 
(sliding off the guide) check to determine if the 
other half of the same bar is entering properly. If 
not, depress partially the upper bank keylever of 
the bar and push the tail of the typebar in the same 
direction that the type must travel to slide off the 
guide properly. Do not "kink" the bar, merely lean 
the tail slightly. If one half of the bar is off. de-
press upper ba nk Keylever slightly and spring the 
type head in the correct direction. 
Care must be 
taken to prevent colliding typeheads. All type from 
the Center T k Connecting Link to the left must 
"slide off" the right side of the Guide. 
All type 
from the right of tn e Center T ie Connecting Link 
must "slide off" the left side of the guide. If the 
side alignment is quite erratic, the type guide is 
probably out of position. 
Strike each letter on stencil both on capitals .and 
normals. If any letter blurs, then the letter is not 
entering the guide properly and the type strikes 
the platen too soon. 
In other words the type is 
not "slidinq off" the side of the Guide. 
When a machine is considered alioned, type 
sentences. using all letter and capitals. Good align-
ment means a good printing line.
