ABSTRACT
Observations reveal a ‘bulk ﬂow’ in the local Universe which is faster and extends to much larger scales than is expected around
a typical observer in the standard ΛCDM cosmology. This is expected to result in a scale-dependent dipolar modulation of the
acceleration of the expansion rate inferred from observations of objects within the bulk ﬂow. From a maximum-likelihood analysis
of the Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA) catalogue of Type Ia supernovae we ﬁnd that the deceleration parameter, in addition to a
small monopole, indeed has a much bigger dipole component aligned with the CMB dipole which falls exponentially with redshift z:
q0 = qm + qd.ˆn exp(−z/S ). The best ﬁt to data yields qd = −8.03 and S = 0.0262 (⇒d ∼100 Mpc), rejecting isotropy (qd = 0) with
3.9σ statistical signiﬁcance, while qm = −0.157 and consistent with no acceleration (qm = 0) at 1.4σ. Thus the cosmic acceleration
deduced from supernovae may be an artefact of our being non-Copernican observers, rather than evidence for a dominant component
of ‘dark energy’ in the Universe.
Key words. cosmology: observations – dark energy – large-scale structure of universe
1. Introduction
The foundations of the current standard model of cosmology
date back nearly a century to when there was essentially no data
available. In particular the Universe was assumed to be exactly
isotropic and homogeneous, with space-time described by the
maximally symmetric Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker
metric, and occupied by ideal ﬂuids with purely diagonal energy-
momentum tensors (Peebles 1994). Subsequently it has been
recognised that the distribution of galaxies, which is a biased
tracer of the underlying distribution of the dominant dark mat-
ter, is in fact rather inhomogeneous. Counts-in-spheres of galaxy
catalogues suggest that there is a transition to (statistical) ho-
mogeneity on scales exceeding ∼100 Mpc (Hogg et al. 2005;
Scrimgeour et al. 2012) although suﬃciently large volumes have
not yet been surveyed to establish this deﬁnitively. This is how-
ever the expectation in the current standard cosmological model
if the observed large-scale structure has grown under gravity in
the sea of dark matter, starting with an initially gaussian ran-
dom ﬁeld of small density perturbations with an approximately
scale-invariant spectrum. Detailed observations of the tempera-
ture ﬂuctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
have broadly conﬁrmed this model (Akrami et al. 2018). How-
ever several anomalies have been noted, e.g. the lack of corre-
lations on large angular scales, the quadrupole-octupole align-
ment, and the hemispherical power asymmetry — which seem
to imply a violation of statistical isotropy and scale-invariance
of primordial perturbations — although there is no consensus
yet on either their physical nature or their origin (Schwarz et al.
2016).
In our real Universe there are ‘peculiar motions’ due to
the local inhomogeneity and anisotropy of surrounding struc-
ture. These are non-negligible, e.g. our Local Group of galax-
ies moves with respect to the universal expansion at 620 ± 15 ∼
kms−1 towards ℓ= 271.9±20, b = 29.6±1.40, as is inferred from
the observed dipolar modulation of the CMB temperature (Kogut
et al. 1993; Akrami et al. 2018). Moreover diverse observations
e.g. Lauer & Postman (1994); Hudson et al. (2004); Watkins et
al. (2009); Lavaux et al. (2010); Feldman et al. (2010); Colin et
al. (2011); Feindt et al. (2013); Magoulas et al. (2016), reach-
ing out as far as ∼300 Mpc, have not seen the expected ∼1/r
fall-oﬀof the peculiar velocity in the standard ΛCDM cosmol-
ogy. The odds of this happening by chance in that framework can
be estimated by querying Hubble volume simulations of large-
scale structure formation e.g. Dark Sky (Skillman et al. 2014).
In fact less than 1% of Milky Way-like observers should observe
the bulk ﬂow (> 250 km s−1 extending to z > 0.03) that we
do (Rameez et al. 2018). Thus we are not comoving observers
but are ‘tilted’ relative to the idealised Hubble ﬂow (Tsagas
2010). The implications of this have been discussed for mea-
surements of the Hubble parameter H0 (Hess & Kitaura 2014),
but not for the inference of cosmic acceleration.
Since cosmological observables are formulated in the ‘CMB
frame’ in which the Universe is supposedly perfectly isotropic, it
is in any case always necessary to correct what we measure from
our relative moving frame. For example the observed redshifts of
the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in catalogues like JLA (Betoule
et al. 2014) have been corrected in order to convert from the he-
liocentric frame to the CMB frame. The methodology used fol-
lows earlier work (Conley et al. 2011) which used bulk ﬂow ob-
servations made back in 2004 (Hudson et al. 2004) and moreover
assumed that there is convergence to the CMB frame beyond
150 Mpc. Since this is not in accordance with subsequent deeper
observations, we use only the heliocentric redshifts and reverse

the corrections applied to the magnitudes in order to examine
whether the deceleration parameter measured in our (bulk ﬂow)
rest frame can indeed diﬀer from that of comoving observers
in the model universe (Tsagas 2010). Such theoretical consider-
ations imply (Tsagas 2011; Tsagas & Kadiltzoglou 2015) that
there should be a dipole asymmetry in the derived cosmic decel-
eration parameter q0 towards the bulk ﬂow direction. In this work
we do ﬁnd a signiﬁcant (3.9σ) indication of such a dipole, and
also that the monopole in q0 decreases simultaneously in signiﬁ-
cance (to 1.4σ). Hence not only is the indication for acceleration
statistically marginal (Nielsen et al. 2016), it probably arises due
to our being tilted observers located in a bulk ﬂow, rather than
being the eﬀect of a cosmological constant or dark energy.
2. The ‘Joint Lightcurve Analysis’
We use the most up to date publicly available sample of super-
nova lightcurve properties and directions: the SDSS-II/SNLS3
‘Joint Lightcurve Analysis’ (JLA) catalogue (Betoule et al.
2014). This consists of 740 spectroscopically conﬁrmed SNe Ia,
including several low redshift (z < 0.1) samples, three sea-
sons of SDSS-II (0.05 < z < 0.4) and three years of SNLS
(0.2 < z < 1) data, all calibrated consistently in the ‘Spectral
Adaptive Lightcurve Template 2’ (SALT2) scheme. This assigns
to each supernova 3 parameters: the apparent magnitude m∗
B at
maximum in the rest frame ‘B-band’, and the light curve shape
and colour corrections, x1 and c. The distance modulus is then
given by:
µSN = m∗
B −M + αx1 −βc,
(1)
where α and β are assumed to be constants, as is M the absolute
SNe Ia magnitude, as beﬁts a ‘standard candle’. In the standard
ΛCDM cosmological model this is related to the luminosity dis-
tance dL as:

(2)
Here dH is the Hubble distance and H the Hubble parameter (H0
being its present value), and ΩM, ΩΛ, Ωk are the matter, cosmo-
logical constant and curvature densities in units of the critical
density. In the ΛCDM model these are related by the ‘cosmic
sum rule’: 1 = ΩM + ΩΛ + Ωk. However we make no such model
assumptions and will simply expand the luminosity distance dL
in a Taylor series in order to examine its second derivative i.e. the
acceleration (see §3). This is because acceleration is a kinematic
quantity and can be measured without making any assumptions
about the dynamics underlying the universal expansion. (There
may be concern that such a Taylor expansion fails at high red-
shift, however we have veriﬁed that dL in the best-ﬁt ΛCDM
model diﬀers by only 7% even at z = 1.3 (the highest redshift
in the JLA sample), which is much less than the measurement
uncertainty. Indeed the Taylor expansion ﬁts the data just as well
as ΛCDM.)
Fig. 1. The sky distribution of the 4 sub-samples of the JLA catalogue in
Galactic coordinates: SDSS (red dots), SNLS (blue dots), low redshift
(green dots) and HST (black dots). Note that the 4 big blue dots are
clusters of many individual SNe Ia. The directions of the CMB dipole
(star), the SMAC bulk ﬂow (triangle) and the 2M++ bulk ﬂow (inverted
triangle) are also shown.
Fig. 2. The peculiar velocity ‘corrections’ which have been applied to
the JLA catalogue. The velocity parameter C deﬁned in equation (3) is
shown versus the observed redshift zhel in the heliocentric frame.
Figure 1 is a Mollewide projection of the directions of the
740 SNe Ia in Galactic coordinates. Due to the diverse survey
strategies of the sub-samples that make up the JLA catalogue, its
sky coverage is patchy and anisotropic. While the low redshift
objects are spread out unevenly across the sky, the intermediate
redshift ones from SDSS are mainly conﬁned to a narrow disk
at low declination, while the high redshift ones from SNLS are
clustered along 4 speciﬁc directions.
The JLA analysis (Betoule et al. 2014) corrects the observed
redshifts in the heliocentric frame, zhel, in order to obtain the
cosmological redshifts, zCMB, after accounting for peculiar mo-
tions in the local Universe. These corrections are carried over
unchanged from an earlier analysis (Conley et al. 2011), which
in turn cites an earlier method (Neill et al. 2007) and the peculiar
velocity model of Hudson et al. (Hudson et al. 2004). It is stated
that the inclusion of these corrections allow SNe Ia with redshifts
down to 0.01 to be included in the cosmological analysis, in con-
trast to earlier analyses (Riess et al. 2006) which employed only
SNe Ia down to z = 0.023.
In Figure 2 we scrutinise these corrections by exhibiting the
velocity parameter C, deﬁned as
C = [(1 + zhel) −(1 + zCMB)(1 + zd)] × c
(3)
where zhel and zCMB are as tabulated by JLA, while zd is given
by (Davis et al. 2011)

where uCMB−⊙is 369 km s−1 in the direction of the CMB
dipole,(Kogut et al. 1993) and ˆn is the unit vector in the direc-
tion of the supernova. It can be seen in Figure 2 that SNe Ia
beyond z ∼0.06 have been assumed to be stationary w.r.t. the
CMB rest frame, and corrections applied only to those at lower
redshifts. It is not clear how these corrections were made beyond
z ∼0.04, which is the maximum extent to which the Streaming
Motions of Abell Clusters (SMAC) sample (Hudson et al. 2004)
extends. This has a bulk velocity of 687 ± 203 km s−1 towards
ℓ= 260 ± 130, b = 0 ± 110 out to z = 0.04 at 90%C.L., and a
bulk velocity of 372 ± 127 km s−1 towards ℓ= 2730, b = 60 gen-
erated by sources beyond 200 h−1 Mpc (⇒z ≃0.064) at 98%
C.L. If the peculiar velocity ﬁeld is not discontinuous, the SNe Ia
immediately outside this volume should have comparable veloc-
ities. Figure 2 indicates however that the JLA peculiar velocity
‘corrections’ have arbitrarily assumed that the bulk ﬂow abruptly
disappears at this point! The JLA analysis (Betoule et al. 2014)
allows SNe Ia beyond this distance to only have an uncorrelated
velocity dispersion of cσz = 150 km s−1. In the absence of any
evidence of convergence to the CMB rest frame, this assump-
tion is unjustiﬁed since it is it quite possible that the observed
bulk ﬂow stretches out to much larger scales. In fact there have
been persistent claims of a ‘dark ﬂow’ extending out to several
hundreds of Mpc (Kashlinski et al. 2009, 2010, 2011), although
this is still under debate. At any rate the value of cσz should be
determined by ﬁtting to the data, rather than put in by hand.
At this point it is worth noting the anisotropy of the JLA cata-
logue. Out of the 740 SNe Ia, 551 are in the hemisphere pointing
away from the CMB dipole. With respect to the 372±127 km s−1
bulk ﬂow of the model (Hudson et al. 2004) using which the red-
shifts of the local SNe Ia have been corrected, only 108 are in the
upper hemisphere while 632 are in the lower hemisphere. With
respect to the direction of the abnormally high ﬂow reported
by 6dFGSv, the largest and most homogeneous peculiar veloc-
ity sample of nearly 9000 galaxies (Magoulas et al. 2016), 103
SNe Ia are in the upper hemisphere while 637 are in the lower
hemisphere.
The subsequent Pantheon catalogue(Scolnic et al. 2018),
which incorporates 308 additional SNe Ia (many from the Pan-
STARRS survey), continues to suﬀer from these problems.
While the ﬂow model (Carrick et al. 2015) using which the red-
shifts of the Pantheon sample have been corrected go out to
z ∼0.067, this model has a residual bulk ﬂow of 159±23 km s−1
attributed to sources beyond z = 0.067, and 890 of the 1048 Pan-
theon SNe are in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of this
ﬂow.
Both JLA and Pantheon include SNe to which anomalously
large peculiar velocity corrections have been applied at redshifts
far higher than the limit to which the corresponding ﬂow models
extend. Two of the many such examples are SDSS2308 in JLA at
z = 0.14 in JLA (the outlier in Figure 2) and SN2246 in Pantheon
at z = 0.194.
We use the heliocentric redshifts tabulated by JLA (Betoule
et al. 2014) and subtract out the bias corrections applied to m∗
B.
For the Pantheon catalogue (Scolnic et al. 2018) the zhel values
and individual contributions to the covariance are not public, and
moreover there are unresolved concerns about the accuracy of
the data therein (Rameez 2019) so we cannot use it.
3. Cosmological analysis
We now compare the distance modulus (equation 1) obtained
from the JLA sample with the apparent magnitude (equation 2)
using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (Nielsen et al. 2016).
For the luminosity distance we use its kinematic Taylor series
expansion up to the third term (Visser 2003) since we wish to
analyse the data without making assumptions about the matter
content or the dynamics:
dL(zhel) = czhel

(5)
where q ≡−¨aa/˙a2 is the cosmic deceleration parameter in the
Hubble ﬂow frame, deﬁned in terms of the scale factor of the
universe a and its derivatives w.r.t. proper time, j0 is the cosmic
‘jerk’ j = ˙¨a/aH3, and −kc2/(H2
0a2
0) is just Ωk. Note that the last
two appear together in the coeﬃcient of the z3 term so cannot be
determined separately. In the ΛCDM model: q0 ≡ΩM/2 −ΩΛ.
To look for a dipole in the deceleration parameter, we allow
it to have a direction dependence:
q = qm + qd.ˆnF (z, S )
(6)
where qm and qd are the monopole and dipole components, while
ˆn is the direction of the dipole and F (z, S ) describes its scale de-
pendence. We consider four representative functional forms:
(a) Constant: F (z, S ) = 1 independent of z,
(b) Top hat: F (z, S ) = 1 for z < S , and 0 otherwise,
(c) Linear: F (z, S ) = 1 −z/S , and
(d) Exponential: F (z, S ) = exp(−z/S ).
Due to the anisotropic sky coverage of the dataset, it would be
hard to ﬁnd ˆn from the data, so we choose it to be along the
CMB dipole direction. This is reasonable as the directions of
the reported bulk ﬂows (Hudson et al. 2004; Watkins et al. 2009;
Lavaux et al. 2010; Feldman et al. 2010; Colin et al. 2011; Feindt
et al. 2013; Magoulas et al. 2016) are all within ∼400 of each
other and of the CMB dipole. (Later we allow the direction to
vary as an a posteriori test to demonstrate that our result is in-
deed robust.)
We maximise a likelihood constructed earlier (March et al.
2011; Nielsen et al. 2016), simultaneously with respect to the 4
cosmological parameters qm, j0 −Ωk, qd and S , as well as the 8
parameters that go into the standardisation of the SNe Ia can-
dles: α, β, M0, σM0, x1,0, σx1,0, c0 and σc0. While our analysis is
frequentist, it is equivalent to the ‘Bayesian Hierarchical Model’
of March et al. (March et al. 2011) (which indeed yielded the
same result (Shariﬀet al. 2016) as the frequentist analysis of
Nielsen et al. (2016) when applied to the JLA catalogue).
In Table 2 we show how this compares with using the preva-
lent “constrained χ2 method” used by e.g. Betoule et al. (2014),
wherein an arbitrary error σint is added to each data point and
varied until a good ﬁt (with χ2 = 1/d.o.f.) is obtained to the as-
sumed model. This may be appropriate for parameter estimation,
but not for model selection.
However as seen in Table 1 the quality of ﬁt improves fur-
ther (-2 log Lmax decreases) when q0 is allowed to have a dipole.
In the best ﬁt where this has an exponentially decaying form
∝e−z/S , the dipole qd = −8.03 is much larger than the monopole
qm = −0.157 and its scale parameter is S = 0.0262 indicating
that the impact of the bulk ﬂow dominates over any isotropic ac-
celeration out to z ∼0.1. Since ∆BIC between the model with
qd = 0 and the model with qm = 0 is 9.86, this constitutes
‘strong’ evidence against a universe that is accelerating isotrop-
ically. In the presence of this dipole, qm = 0 is disfavoured at
only 1.4σ. In other words, in a universe where we have theoret-
ical reasons to expect a dipolar modulation in the deceleration

of the cosmological deceleration parameter inferred from the JLA cat-
alogue of 740 SNe Ia, proﬁling over all other parameters. Note that the

ative to the horizontal scale for the monopole. The value of q0 for the

parameter in the direction of our motion through the CMB, there
is no signiﬁcant evidence for a non-zero value of its monopole
component. Figure 4 shows the 1, 2 and 3 σ contours in the like-
lihood around the maximum as a function of qd and qm, proﬁling
over all other parameters.
We also study the eﬀect of allowing an additional uncorre-
lated velocity dispersion cσz in the ﬁt — rather than ﬁxing it
to be 150 km s−1 as in the JLA analysis (Betoule et al. 2014).
As shown in Table 3 this improves the overall ﬁt even further for
cσz = 241 km s−1; the best-ﬁt dipole drops a little to qd = −6.33,
while the monopole is nearly unchanged at qm = −0.154. The
∆BIC between the model with qd = 0 and the one with qm = 0
is 4.91, providing ‘positive’ evidence against a universe that is
accelerating isotropically. Our main result is thus robust in that
the maximum likelihood estimator prefers to interpret the data as
evidence of a dipole in the deceleration parameter aligned with
the CMB dipole, rather than as an isotropic acceleration of the
universe which may indicate the presence of a cosmological con-
stant.
Fig. 4. Results of an a posteriori grid scan (left panel) varying the di-
rection of the scale-dependent dipolar modulation of the form q0 =
qm + qd.ˆn exp(−z/S ) in Galactic coordinates. The best-ﬁt direction is
within 230 of the CMB dipole and -2 log L (right panel) changes by
just 3.22 between these two directions.
As an a posteriori test, we examine the direction dependence
of this scale-dependent dipolar modulation in q0, by scanning the
direction of qd on a grid corresponding to a HEALpix (Gorski et
al. 2004) map of nside=8. The best ﬁt direction is 23 degrees
away from the CMB dipole, where qd increases to -9.851 but -2
log L improves by only 3.22. This demonstrates that the direc-
tion of the anisotropy we ﬁnd is also robust.
4. Discussion
It has been observed (Bernal et al. 2017) that the deceleration
parameter inferred from previous SNe Ia datasets has a redshift,
and indeed directional, dependence. This was interpreted as in-
dicative of local anisotropy in the matter distribution, i.e. our be-
ing located in an asymmetric void. The reﬁnement in the present
work is that we consider a recent comprehensive database of
SNe Ia and take into account all systematic eﬀects as encoded in
the covariance matrices provided (Betoule et al. 2014). Moreover
we focus on the local velocity rather than the density ﬁeld as this
fully reﬂects the gravitational dynamics due to inhomogeneities.
We can then explore the expected consequences of our being
‘tilted’ i.e. non-Copernican observers. Our analysis is guided by
the suggestion that we may then infer acceleration even when
the overall expansion rate is decelerating — a signature of which
would be a dipolar modulation of the inferred q0 along the direc-
tion of the bulk ﬂow (Tsagas 2010, 2011; Tsagas & Kadiltzoglou
2015).

Jacques Colin et al.: Evidence for anisotropy of cosmic acceleration
The eﬀect of peculiar velocities on SNe Ia cosmology has
been discussed earlier (Hui & Greene 2006; Davis et al. 2011),
however these studies relied on covariances that apply to Coper-
nican observers. As we show elsewhere (Colin et al. 2019), the
bulk ﬂow we are embedded in is rare at a level of ≲1% (Rameez
et al. 2018) according to the DarkSky simulation (Skillman et al.
2014), but the conditional covariances can be up to a factor of
∼10 larger and introduce a preferred direction locally. This can
make a much bigger impact on cosmological inferences than was
found in previous studies. In particular the JLA analysis (Betoule
et al. 2014) of the same dataset claimed that the eﬀect of pecu-
liar velocities is a tiny (< 0.1%) shift in the best-ﬁt cosmological
parameters.
In summary, the model-independent evidence for accelera-
tion of the Hubble expansion rate from the largest public cata-
logue of Type Ia supernovae is only 1.4σ. This is in contrast to
the claim (Scolnic et al. 2018) that acceleration is established by
SNe Ia at > 6σ in the framework of the ΛCDM model. Moreover
there is a signiﬁcant (3.9σ) indication for a dipole in q0 towards
the CMB dipole — as is indeed expected if the apparent acceler-
ation is an artefact of our being located in a local bulk ﬂow which
extends out far enough to include most of the supernovae stud-
ied (Tsagas 2010, 2011; Tsagas & Kadiltzoglou 2015). Given
the observational evidence that there is no convergence to the
CMB frame as far out as redshift z ∼0.1 which includes half the
known SNe Ia, this possibility must be taken seriously.

Appendix A: Redshift-dependence of light curve
ﬁtting parameters
In this work we have used the statistical approach as well as
the treatment of lightcurve parameters espoused by Nielsen et
al. (2016). These authors were criticised by Rubin & Hayden
(2016) for using redshift-independent distributions for x1 and c.
In this respect we note the following:
1. The JLA analysis determined the relationship between the
luminosity distance and redshift for SNe Ia. To inspect a
posteriori the distribution of two (x1 and c) out of the three
ingredients that go into standardising SNe Ia, and then add
empirical terms in the ﬁt to describe their sample dependence
and redshift evolution, is fundamentally against the princi-
ples of blind hypothesis testing, especially since no such de-
pendence had been suggested by Betoule et al. (2014).
2. Nevertheless we carry out the same 22-parameter ﬁt (Rubin
& Hayden 2016) for comparison and present the results in
Table A.1. While the log maximum likelihood ratio does im-
prove for these ﬁts, this parameterisation actually increases
the signiﬁcance of the dipole in q0 to 4.7σ (likelihood ratio
of 18.3) and reduces further the signiﬁcance of a monopole.
3. The addition of parameters to improve the quality of a ﬁt
and obtain a desired outcome have to be justiﬁed by physical
and/or information theoretic arguments. The additional pa-
rameters of Rubin & Hayden (2016) can be justiﬁed by the
Akaike information criterion but not by the stricter Bayesian
information criterion. This also applies to the two additional
parameters we introduce (qd and S ) but these are physically
motivated for a ‘tilted observer’ (Tsagas 2011; Tsagas &
Kadiltzoglou 2015).
4. If the light curve parameters x1 and c are allowed to be sam-
ple/redshift dependent one can ask why the absolute magni-
tude of SNe Ia should also not be sample/redshift-dependent.
Allowing this of course undermines their use as ‘standard
candles’ and the data is then unsurprisingly consistent with
no acceleration (Tutusaus et al. 2017), as seen in Table A.1.
Appendix B: Uncertainties
Fig. B.1. The diﬀerent sources of intrinsic dispersion in magnitude σm
that enter cosmological ﬁts of JLA data. On top of the global σint, SNe Ia
are given a dispersion σlens proportional to redshift to account for lens-
ing, while low redshift SNe Ia are selectively more dispersed by σz to
account for peculiar velocity eﬀects.
The JLA covariance matrix includes uncertainties from the
lightcurve template ﬁtting process, calibration uncertainties, dust
extinction in the Galaxy etc, together with the expected disper-
sion due to peculiar velocities (which mainly aﬀects low redshift
SNe) and lensing (which mainly aﬀects high redshift SNe Ia),
as well as the propagated uncertainties from the ﬂow model us-
ing which the SN by SN peculiar velocity corrections are per-
formed. In addition it is also necessary to ﬁt for a global intrinsic
dispersion as in previous analyses (March et al. 2011). We use
heliocentric redshifts in this analysis so do not include uncertain-
ties related to the peculiar velocity corrections based on the ﬂow
model. The redshift dependence of the dispersions in the ﬁt are
shown in Figure B.1.

Notes. The ﬁrst row corresponds to the 22-parameter ﬁt of Rubin & Hayden (2016) with the full JLA covariances. In the second row, the peculiar
velocity corrections they made are undone (and the corresponding arbitrary uncertainties imposed are excluded). The third row demonstrates the
dramatic improvement in the ﬁt when a scale-dependent exponentially falling dipole (with 2 additional parameters) is allowed for in q0.
