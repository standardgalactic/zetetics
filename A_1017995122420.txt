Interrupted torsion tests were performed in the temperature range of 900–1100◦C, strain
rate range of 5.0 × 10−2–5.0 × 100/sec and interpass time range of 0.5–100 seconds to study
the characteristics of metadynamic recrystallization (MDRX) for austenitic stainless steel. To
compare the MDRX with static recrystallization (SRX), the pass strain was applied above
the critical strain (εc) (εc = 2.2 × 10−3 D1/2

Z 0.089, where Z is Zener-Hollomon parameter,
Z = ˙ε exp((380000 J/mol)/RT ) and D0 is as-received grain size) to obtain the MDRX during
interpass time. It was found that the kinetics of MDRX were dependent of the strain rate and
deformation temperature but were nearly independent of the change in pass strain after
the peak strain. The time for 50% metadynamic softening, t50, was determined as follows:
t50 = 1.33 × 10−11 ˙ε−0.41 D0 exp((230000 J/mol)/RT ) and this calculated value was consistent
with the measured value. The Zener-Hollomon parameter was impossible to evaluate the
MDRX fraction, because the fractional softening values were different at the same Z values.
The new parameter (MDRX parameter) considering deformation temperature, strain rate
and interpass time was proposed to evaluate the MDRX fraction. The MDRX-parameter was
determined as 3.25 × 10−19˙ε0.3 t0.6

1. Introduction
The grain reﬁnement by dynamic recrystallization
(DRX) is very important during hot deformation [1–3].
DRX is generally easy to occur in some early stages like
a roughing mill with a low strain rate and high deforma-
tion temperature during multipass deformation, but it is
difﬁcult to occur at the some last passes. It is also difﬁ-
cult for the static recrystallization (SRX) to take place
between interpasses. Therefore, metadynamic recrys-
tallization (MDRX) is nowadays interested in the hot
workingconditionbutverylimitedresultsarepublished
until now [4, 5].
Metadynamic
recrystallization
occurs
by
the
continued growth of nuclei formed as a result of
the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization during
prestraining [4, 6]. Hence the operation of MDRX does
not require an incubation time and such a rapid inter-
pass softening can increase the mechanical properties,
even though not long pass strain and interpass time,
especially for materials with relatively large deforma-
tion resistance such as austenitic stainless steel. This
is also important to improve the mechanical properties
and can make very ﬁne grains during the very short
interpass time. Therefore, this fast softening can reduce
the interpass time and pass strain, since can accelerate
the recrystallization during short interpass time.
The aim of the present study is to investigate the
contribution of the metadynamic recrystallization for
the softening of austenitic stainless steel. The effects
of strain rate, temperature, and pass strain for metady-
namic recrystallization were investigated by means of
interrupted torsion testing. The mechanical data were
used to derive the kinetic equation which describes the
rates of softening. Finally, the new parameter, MDRX
parameter, was proposed to evaluate the metadynamic
recrystallization fraction.
2. Experimental procedure
The AISI 304 stainless steel of nominal composition
Fe-18.25 wt% Cr-8.16 wt% Ni was produced by the
vacuum induction melting and the torsion test speci-
mens with a gauge section of 20 mm length and 5 mm
radius were machined. Continuous torsion tests were
carried out to calculate the critical strain at the same
temperature and strain rate as the interrupted deforma-
tion. Interrupted torsion tests were conducted in the
temperature range of 900–1100◦C, strain rate range of
5.0 × 10−2–5.0 × 100/sec, interpass time range of 0.5–
100 seconds, and pass strain range of 0.25–3 times of
peak strain to evaluate the effects of deformation vari-
ables on metadynamic softening.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Decision of critical strain for
dynamic recrystallization
The stress (σ)-strain (ε) curves, obtained from
continuous hot torsion tests at the condition of 900–
1100◦C and 0.05–5.0/sec, are displayed in Fig. 1a to
determine the strain hardening rate (□□= dσ/dε) and
this strain hardening rate as a function of stress (σ) at
the condition of 1000□, □0.5/sec is shown in Fig. 1b.
Fig. 1b consists of three stages [7]. At the ﬁrst low
strain stage, strain hardening rate (θ) decreases rapidly
up to the strain which the subgrain formation begins.
At the second stage, the strain hardening rate decreases
up to the critical stress (σc). During this stage, subgrain
formation is completed. At the third stage, strain hard-
ening rate decreases from the critical strain, inﬂection
point, to peak stress (σp), at θ = 0 and this inﬂection
point (σc) indicates that DRX becomes operative.

strain of austenitic stainless steel.
From this analysis, the relationship between the
εc and deformation variables were determined to be
εc = 2.2 × 10−3 D1/2
0
Z0.09, where D0 is the as-received
grain size and Z is the Zener-Hollomon parameter. The
Z calculated from the continuous deformation is equal
to Z = ˙ε exp((380000 J/mol)/RT), where ˙ε is the strain
rate. The pass strain can be decided by this equation. To
study the metadynamic softening, the decision of criti-
cal strain for DRX is very important, because the crit-
ical strain indicates the onset of strain for DRX. If the
pass strain is larger than the critical strain, the metady-
namic recrystallization affects the shape of ﬂow curve
and fractional softening of successive passes in spite of
short interpass time.
3.2. Fractional softening, FS
The interrupted stress-strain curves obtained at the tem-
perature of 1000◦C and strain rate of 0.05/sec with vary-
ing interpass time, are presented in Fig. 2. The ﬂow
stress of the second curve below the interrupt time of
3 seconds rises quickly up to the level of the continuous
curve. However, when interruption time is longer than
10 seconds, much softening takes place and the second
curve becomes similar to initial loading curves. If the
time between passes 1st and 2nd is sufﬁciently long for
full softening to occur, the stress-strain curve for the
2nd pass is essentially the same of the ﬁrst curve. If
there is no softening, the second pass gives rise to a
curve that coincides with an extrapolation of the ﬁrst
curve. In order to quantify the amount of softening be-
tween two passes, two testing approaches have been
used quite widely in previous work: (1) offset stress
and (2) mean ﬂow stress method. In these experiments,
the ﬁrst method was adopted.
In the offset stress method, the fraction softening, X
is calculated according to:
X = σm −σ2
σm −σ1
Where σm is the ﬂow stress at the end of the ﬁrst
curve, σ1 is the stress at an offset of 0.2% strain in the
ﬁrst deformation, σ2 is the offset stress in the second
pass.

tion of interruption time, depending on deformation

temperature, strain rate and pass strain. From Fig. 3a
and b, as the temperature and strain rate are increased,
thekineticsofmetadynamicsofteningareincreasedand
these results are well accepted by the classical static re-
crystallization. In Fig. 3c, a very small change in the
softening kinetics was observed when the pass strain
was increased from 1 to 3 times of peak strain. On the
other hand, a signiﬁcant increase in kinetics was ob-
served when the pass strain was raised from 0.25 to
1 times of peak strain. These softening curves indicate
that the metadynamic softening was happened during
the interpass time, when the pass strain was over the
peak strain and also that the effect of pass strain for
metadynamic softening was negligible.
3.3. Kinetics of metadynamic
recrystallization
The recrystallization process involving nucleation and
growth can be expressed by the Avrami equation. Al-
though the metadynamic softening does not involve
a nucleation step, it can be described by the Avrami
equation:
X = 1 −exp

−0.693(t/t50)n
(2)
Figure 4 Dependence of ln ln (1/(1 −x)) on ln time under different pass
strains, temperatures and strain rates.
where X is the recrystallization fraction (%), t is the
interrupt time, n is the Avrami constant and t50 is the
time for 50% softening. The t50 can be expressed as
t50 = A˙εpD exp(Q/RT ). Here, A and p are constants,
Q is the activation energy (J/mol) and R is the universal
gas constant.
Fig. 4 shows the ln ln(1/(1 −X)) vs. ln time rela-
tions to determine the Avrami constant, n. The n value
is determined to be 1.06. A very few information is
available regarding the n value for MDRX [8, 9]. This
value is closely similar to the value (1.08) for SRX on
304 stainless steel. As the pass strain does not consider
in MDRX, the effects of deformation temperature and
strain rate are considered to determine the t50, as shown
in Fig. 5. The calculated t50 is:
t50 = 1.33 × 10−11˙ε−0.41D exp((230300 J/mol)/RT )
(3)
This calculated value is well matched with the mea-
sured value. The relationship between the pass strain
and time for softening is shown in Fig. 6. The time for
5, 20, 50 and 80% softening is presented. It was found
that there’s no difference in the time after 50% soft-
ening. It means the MDRX is no more sensitive after
critical strain for DRX and the kinetics of static recrys-
tallization will be different from that of MDRX. Fig. 6
also shows the change in kinetics corresponding to the

transition from static to metadynamic softening and this
pass strain dependence on the time to FS can apply to
the time for 50% softening as well as the amount of
fractional softening.
The time for 50% metadynamic recrystallization cal-
culated for this steel as a function of pass strain with
various strain rate is displayed in Fig. 7. There is very
little sensitivity of t0.5 to amount on pass strain.
In the case of SRX kinetics, most of investigations
reveal a weak effect of strain rate but a strong effect
of pass strain. Since the driving force for SRX is the
reduction of strain energy, basically the annihilation of
the dislocations introduced during deformation, a sig-
niﬁcant inﬂuence of strain is to be expected. In the case
of MDRX, the driving force is same, but the disloca-
tion density is that due to DRX, and changes in strain
in the steady state region of DRX do not change the
average dislocation density. Therefore, once the pass
strain is over the critical strain for DRX, changes in
pass strain do not change the MDRX kinetics any more.
The MDRX kinetics, therefore associated with a steady
state DRX structure are not expected to be affected by
the strain changes [10–13].
3.4. The determination of MDRX parameter
The Zener-Hollomon parameter is generally accepted
as a good value to explain the dynamic restoration.
Figure 8 Comparison of softening behaviors observed after deforming
to the peak strain at the similar values of Z-parameter.
This parameter can illustrate the ﬂow stress and strain
rate as a function of temperature and is associated with
microstructure evolution [2]. As it is mentioned before,
the nucleation of metadynamic recrystallization begins
at dymaic state. Therefore, the Zener-Hollomon param-
eter can be expected to explain the MDRX behavior.
Fig. 8 shows the fractional softening as a function
of interpass time obtained under a constant Zener-
Hollomon parameter (∼1.5 × 1014). Although the driv-
ing force for recrystallization, i.e., the stored energy
resulting from deformation, was constant, different
degree of softening fraction was obtained under this
Zener-Hollomon parameter. This indicates that a con-
stant Z value did not lead to a similar softening frac-
tion. This is because the Zener-Hollomon parameter
includes strain rate and temperature, but not interpass
time. However, MDRX fraction depends on the inter-
pass time. Thus, since the Zener-Hollomon parameter is
not an adequate value to evaluate the kinetics of meta-
dynamic softening, it is necessary to deﬁne the new
parameter considering the temperature, strain rate and
interpass time. Also, since the grain size depends on
the softening fraction, the new parameter can explain
the MDRX fraction and grain size.
Fig. 9 shows the dependence of MDRX fraction
on interpass time. The relationship between MDRX
fraction and interpass time can be expressed by the
following power relation: MDRX fraction = Ct0.6

where C is constant. Also, the dependency of the
MDRX fraction on temperature and strain rate could be
obtained by the above method. Thus, the new param-
eter (MDRX parameter) can be determined from the
analysis of dependency of MDRX softening fraction
on temperature (T ), strain rate (˙ε) and interpass time
(ti) as follows:
MDRX parameter = 3.25 × 10−19˙ε0.3t0.6

Fig. 10 shows the MDRX fractional softening as a
function of the MDRX parameter. MDRX fractional
softening includes the effects of all the deformation
variables, such as strain rate, temperature and in-
terpass time. This ﬁgure shows the sigmoid shape
with a very small error range. Once the MDRX
parameter is decided, the MDRX fraction can be
determined. One example is represented at the Table I.
Table I shows the dependency of MDRX fraction,
Zener-Hollomon parameter and MDRX parameter
on deformation variables. For example, for ∼50%
MDRX fraction (underlined conditions), the values of
Zener-Hollomon parameter are signiﬁcantly different
(1.38 × 1013–3.99 × 1015), but the values of MDRX

parameter are closely similar (∼1.3 × 1019). Thus the
MDRXparametercanleadtothepredictionofthemeta-
dynamic softening fraction.
The relationship between the MDRX parameter and
MDRX fraction can be expressed as the following
equation:
MDRX fraction
= exp[1.66 ln(MDRX parameter) −73.67]
(5)
Fig. 11 shows the experimental MDRX fraction and
the MDRX fraction value calculated from Equation 5 as
a function of MDRX parameter. The calculated MDRX
fraction values are well matched with the experimen-
tal values. However, some discrepancies in these two
MDRX fraction values were found above 100% MDRX
fraction.
In conclusion, we proposed the new parameter
(MDRX parameter) considering temperature, strain
rate and interpass time, to evaluate the MDRX fraction.
This new parameter can be determined easily from the
relationship between the MDRX fraction and defor-
mation variables and can predict the MDRX fraction
precisely.
4. Conclusions
The important changes in kinetics and softening oc-
curred during the holding intervals after the initiation
of dynamic recrystallization were investigated. From
the analysis of high temperature continuous and inter-
rupted deformation behavior, the following conclusions
can be drawn:
1. The critical strain (εc) was decided by the Zenner-
Hollomon parameter to obtain DRX effects during in-
terpass time.
εc = 2.2 × 10−3D1/2
0
Z0.089,
where
Z = ˙ε exp((380000 J/mol)RT )
2. It was found that the softening kinetics depended
on the strain rate and deformation temperature but not
the pass strain.

3. The time for 50% softening (t50) is determined
as follow: t50 = 1.33 × 10−11
˙ε−0.41D exp((230300
J/mol)/RT). This value is well matched with the ex-
perimental value.
4. We proposed the new parameter (MDRX param-
eter) considering temperature, strain rate and inter-
pass time, to evaluate the MDRX fraction. This new
parameter can be determined easily from the relation-
ship between the MDRX fraction and deformation vari-
ables and also can predict the MDRX fraction precisely.
