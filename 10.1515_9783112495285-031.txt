Critical Behaviour of the Ising Model 
with a Transverse Field 
By 
J . M . 
W E S S E L I N O W A 
A Green's function technique is developed to study the Ising model with a transverse field. The 
order parameter and the longitudinal susceptibility are determined. The critical exponents ß and y 
are numerical calculated for different dimensional lattices. Using the scaling laws, a, ò, rj, and v 
are obtained too. The critical exponents are in very good agreement with other theoretical results 
and with the experimental data. 
Die Methode der Greenschen Funktionen wird angewendet, um das Ising-Modell mit transversalem 
Feld zu untersuchen. Der Ordnungsparameter und die longitudinale Suszeptibilität werden be-
stimmt. Die kritischen Exponenten ß und y werden für verschiedendimensionale Gitter numerisch 
berechnet. Unter Verwendung der scaling-Gesetze werden noch <%, <5, rj und v erhalten. Die kriti-
schen Exponenten sind in sehr guter Übereinstimmung mit anderen theoretischen und experi-
mentellen Ergebnissen. 
The Ising model with a transverse field (IMTF) has been much studied lately because 
of its usefulness in describing phase transitions in a variety of systems, including, for 
example, order-disorder ferroelectrics, singlet ground-state magnetic compounds, 
cooperative Jahn-Teller systems, and liquid crystals. As shown by Elliott [1] and by 
Blinc and Zeks [2] the IMTF can be used for the description of the critical behaviour 
of ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics. The critical exponents of the Ising model have 
been extensively investigated [3 to 15]. They are believed to be independent of the 
magnitude of the spin. This is not valid for the Curie temperature [4], The critical 
exponents are also believed to be unchanged by the addition of the transverse field 
term and indeed by any additional terms which do not lower the symmetry [5], 
They do depend on the dimensionality of the lattice. It would therefore be of some 
interest to check experimentally the conclusion of Larkin and Khmelnitskii [6] that 
uniaxial ferroelectrics behave like the four-dimensional Ising model. The critical 
exponent fi describing the order-parameter is defined as [5]

The experimental values of most substances are /? = 0.31 to 0.36 and y = 1.22 to 
1.36 [7], 
Exact results are obtained only for the two-dimensional Ising model: oc = 0 and 
= 1/8 (Onsager [8] and Yang [9]). In three dimensions no critical exponents are 
known exactly. Sykes et al. [10, 11] using high temperature series expansions deter-
mined y and oc for the Ising model. Applying the same method Camp et al. [12] and 
Domb [13] observed y and v, and /J, respectively. Baker et al. [14] used the Pade-
Borel method to sum series and obtained values for the critical exponents 
y, r), and v 
for Ising-like systems (n = 1) directly in three dimensions. Le Guillou and Zinn-Justin 
[15] calculated the same critical exponents of the «-vector model through field-theoret-
ical methods and presented new and more precise values. Penson et al. [16] and Mattis 
and Gallardo [17] studied with a renormalization group method the two-dimensional 
IMTF. For the one-dimensional I M T F there exists an exact solution by Schultz et al. 
[18], by Pfeuty [19], and by Stoeckly and Scalapino [20], 
The aim of the present paper is to calculate the critical properties, i.e. the critical 
exponents 
and y, of the I M T F with the method of the retarded Green functions. 
We have applied the same method successfully to study the dynamic properties of 
this model [21] and obtained the experimentally observed central peak in ferro-
electrics. The general scheme of our treatment is as follows. We formulate the model 
in Section 2 and define the Green function to be calculated and present shortly the 
method to do it. In Section 3 we write down the energy of the spin waves. Section 4 
contains the relative polarization, the susceptibility, and the critical exponents fi 
and y. Using the scaling-laws we obtain in Section 5 other critical exponents. Finally, 
in Section 6 we present the conclusions of this work. 
Calculations are omitted throughout the paper. Our results are compared with the 
experimental results and with other theoretical results. 
2. Model and Method 
The Hamiltonian of the Ising model in a transverse field is 
H = 
- 2 Q Z 
JijSISJ - i i E 
(3) 
i 
i 
where Q is the magnitude of the transverse field and J ( j is the exchange interaction 
with Jn = 0 and J^ = J p. E is an external electrical field in z-direction. In the 
ordered phase we have the mean values <Sx> =(= 0 and (Sz) =)= 0, and it is appropriate 
to choose a new coordinate system rotating the original one used in (3) by the angle # 
in the xy plane, 
SI = i 
{(1 - 
2QJ) cos •» - 
(bt + 6,) sin 
, 
Sf = i {(1 - 2p,) sin 0 + (bt + 6,) cos 
, 
(4) 
Sf = j 
(bt ~ 6,) • 
The rotation angle & is determined by the requirement (>SX') = 0 in the new coordinate 
system. bl and b\ are the Pauli operators in the rotated system, pj = 
btb\. 
After the rotation (4) the Hamiltonian (3) takes the form 
H = H0 + 
H1,

k 
The retarded Green function to be calculated is defined in matrix form as 
Gk(t) = - ¿6(0 <[Bk(t), B+k]) = 
= (((bk(t);b+k)) 
{bk(t);b_k} 
\ 
\{btk(t);b+k} 
<<&+fe(o ;&-*»/' 
(6) 
The operator Bk stands symbolically for the set bk, bt. k. For the approximate cal-
culation of the Green function (6) we use a method proposed by Mori and Kawasaki 
[22] and by Tserkovnikov [23], which is appropriate for spin problems. After a formal 
integration of the equation of motion one obtains for the Green function 
Gk(t) = - i0(() ([Bk, Bt]) exp (~iEk(t) t) ,

gives the spin wave energy in the generalized Hartree-Fock approximation. The time-
dependent term includes the damping effects.

The spin wave energy below Tc is

Further we have used the abbreviations

If we neglect the correlation functions <6; 6> and (6 +; 6) then we get the results 
of the spin wave energy in the RPA,

The rotation angle -d is determined by the requirement (Sx')

ordinate system, i.e. from the equation

If we take into account the correlation functions <6; 6) and (b+; 6), the numerical 
solution of the system of integral equations [24] gives small corrections for ei1 
« 
—e|2 and ek2 
—el1 in comparison with the simplest approximation but they 
are very important in the vicinity of the Curie temperature. 

Critical Behaviour of the Ising Model with a Transverse Field

It should be noted here that we have not made an expansion with respect to powers 
of 1 ¡Z (Z is the number of nearest neighbours), which would not be valid in the vicinity 
of Tc, and so we have taken into account all summation terms in (9). 
The energies £i/2(fe) belong to the transverse excitations, to the spin waves, which 
are soft modes. For k = 0 the spin wave energy tends to zero, if T —>• Tc. In various 
ferroelectrics this ferroelectric soft mode has been found experimentally using light 
scattering (for a review see Worlock [25]). 
The ferroelectric mode for a three-dimensional lattice in the ordered phase shows 
the following temperature dependence: 
si ~ (Te - 
T)m 
1 . 
(13) 
Wilson and Cummins [26] have investigated this problem with Raman scattering and 
found 
eg ~ (Ta -

(14) 
which is in good agreement with our result. 
4. The Relative Polarization and the Longitudinal Susceptibility 
a(T) is the relative polarization in the direction of the mean field and is equal to 
2(SZ'),

where e* = e^k) from (9) and sin i) from (12 c). The temperature dependence of the 
order parameter {8Z) = a(T) cos 
in the case E = 0 was calculated numerically 
for a simple cubic lattice and next neighbour interaction for yk = 
(cos kx + cos ky-\-
+ cos kz). The method was the iteration procedure. The integration points were 
313 in the interval from 0 to jt/2. The sums were calculated with the accuracy of 
0.5 x 10~6. The order parameter (Sz) 
shows a steeper slope near Tc in comparison 
with the MFA. This steeper slope is found in experiments in KDP-type ferroelectrics, 
too. Further we state that the inconsistency a > 1 stated by Konwent [27] does not 
appear in our approach. 
The critical exponent ft for the order parameter (S z) is calculated numerically for 
lattices of different dimensions in the temperature range 5 x 10~4 
(Tc — T)/Tc\ <C.

We obtain 
P = 0.317 ± 0.006 ; 
0.135 ± 0.006; 
0.098 ± 0.006 
(17) 
for three-, two-, and one-dimensional lattices, respectively. The critical exponent /? 
decreases with decreasing dimension, what is to be expected. The MFA value is 
ft = 0.5. The theoretical results obtained by other authors for the Ising model using 
high-temperature series, Pade approximants, renormalization-group techniques, and 
the experimental values for different ferroelectrics are listed in Table 1. It is not clear 
whether ft ~ 0.5 means for TGS, DTGS, KH 2P0 4, 
and KH 2As0 4 that the MFA 
results are valid in the critical region for these substances or the exponents are like 
those predicted from the four-dimensional Ising model.

According to the universality hypothesis, systems having the same basic symmetries 
are expected to have identical critical exponents and scaling functions, and are said 
to belong to the same universality class. This assumption implies that fluids near the 
gas-fluid critical point and binary liquids near the convolute point belong to the same 
universality class as the three-dimensional Ising model [34], The experimental values 
for fluids are given in Table 1 which are consistent with the values of fj for the Ising 
model.

The longitudinal susceptibility 
in the ordered phase is determined by the relation 
d(Sz)ldE\E=0. 
Taking into account that for small field E

we obtain for

(18) 
The critical exponent y for the longitudinal susceptibility y'-z is calculated numer-
ically in the same temperature range as for (Sz> to 
y = 1.229 ± 0.012 
and 
1.729 ± 0.012 
(19) 
for three- and two-dimensional lattices, respectively, y increases with decreasing 
dimension. The MFA value is y = 1. The theoretical values of y for different dimen-
sional lattices and the experimental data for binary liquid mixtures and real fluids are 
listed in Table 1. 
It should be noted here that if we calculate the critical exponents /? and y with the 
energies in the RPA limit (10), (11) we obtain values which are close to the MFA 
results. 
5. Other Critical Exponents 
Applying the scaling laws [5] the exponent d describing the changes of polarization 
with the effective field may be expressed in terms of /9 and y 
8 = ^r + 1 = 4.877 
and 
13.807 
(20) 
P 
for the three- and two-dimensional lattices, respectively. 
For the critical specific heat exponent tx we obtain 
a = 2 - 2 / 3 - y = 0.137 
and 
0.001 
(21) 
for the three- and two-dimensional lattices, respectively. 
The MFA value is d = 3. For the three-dimensional Ising model are 5 = 5 and 
<x < 0.2, whereas for the two-dimensional model d = 15 and oc as 0. 
v is the critical exponent which governs the behaviour near the critical temperature 
T(. of the correlation length f, such that

and 
v = 0.621 
and

(26) 
for the three- and two-dimensional lattices, respectively. 
The obtained critical exponents <5, a, r j , and v can be compared with other theoretical 
and experimental values given in Table 1. 
6. Conclusions 
The energies belonging to the transverse excitations are obtained. For k = 0 the 
spin wave energy tends to zero, if T —«• T , . . This ferroelectric soft mode was found 
experimentally using light scattering. 
The order parameter and the longitudinal susceptibility are determined. The 
critical exponents are numerically calculated to /? = 0.098, 0.135, 0.317 ± 0.006 for 
the one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattice, respectively, and y = 1.729, 1.229 ± 
i 0.012 for the two- and three-dimensional lattice, respectively. They are independent 
of the parameters ac and J k. Applying the scaling laws we obtain other critical ex-
ponents, d = 13.807, 4.877; a = 0.001, 0.137; 
rj = 0.270, 0.021, and v = 0.999, 
0.621 for the two- and three-dimensional lattice, respectively. 
Finally, it may be concluded that the method and the approximation used here give 
values for the critical exponents, which are in very good agreement with the experi-
mental data and with other theoretical results based on the pure Ising model.
