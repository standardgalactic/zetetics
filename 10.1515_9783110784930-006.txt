Section Two
Hypothetical and Disjunctive Syllogistic
1 Preliminary Remark
By hypothetical syllogistic I understand the theory of valid inferences which can
be drawn from one or more ‘if-then’ propositions in conjunction with other pre-
mises. I designate as disjunctive syllogistic a theory which pertains correspond-
ingly to ‘either-or’ propositions. In these theories, the meanings of ‘if . . ., then . . .’
and ‘either . . ., or . . .’ will be fixed with definitions which will be established
below in § 47 for hypothetical and disjunctive propositions. We could call both
theories taken together – the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic – the logic of
conditional statements, since hypothetical and disjunctive propositions can be un-
derstood as propositions that ascribe only conditional truth to statements of the
clauses they consist of.
Contrary to a widespread opinion according to which Aristotle was only fa-
miliar with a categorical syllogistic, the basics of the hypothetical and disjunc-
tive syllogistic go back to Aristotle and his school. In that school, hypothetical
and disjunctive syllogisms were treated under the common designation for syl-
logisms ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως [‘from a presupposition’]. Aristotle mentions the theory
which is meant to deal systematically with such modes of inference in Analytica
priora 1. 44, 50 b 1–2, though only as program yet to be carried out. He insists in
1. 44, 50 a 16 f. that these modes of inference are not reducible to the categorical.
In 1. 45 b 19 f., he even announces a systematic treatment of the non-categorical
syllogistic which is to investigate how many types of inference ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως
there are. According to Alexander of Aphrodisias, In An. pr. 390, 1 ff., Aristotle’s
system of presuppositional inferences depends on the supposition of a total of
four elementary rules of inference, presumably including modus ponendo po-
nens (see rule (II. 2) below). According to Alexander, the students of Aristotle
Theophrastus of Eresos and Eudemus of Rhodes were supposed to have made
the Aristotelian presuppositional inferences into the subject of systematic logi-
cal investigations.176
Niko Strobach and Theodor Ebert have argued that the inferences Aristotle des-
ignates as syllogisms ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως are not syllogisms in the sense of the relevant
definition of syllogism in An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 18–22, where “Aristotle has fixed the con-
cept of syllogism so that only inferences which deduce a predicative statement from
For more details, see Frede 1974, 17–18.

predicative statements can count as syllogisms”; this “fixing” is supposed to be seen
in a “determination” within the definitional formula used by Aristotle, according to
which syllogisms “‘[need] no further term from outside in order for the necessity to
come about (24 b 21 f.)’” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 859).177 With this determination,
Aristotle “blocked the path to accepting in his logical theory inferences in which con-
ditional statements play a role”, as are characteristic of presuppositional inferences,
e.g., for inferences of modus ponendo ponens (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 859).178 –
What is overlooked here is the fact that Aristotle also explicitly supposes of presup-
positional inferences that they are inferences from predicative statements to predi-
cative statements. He says, namely, that “every syllogism must prove something
either to belong or not to belong, and this either universally or particularly, and in
addition either probatively or from a presupposition [ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως]” (Aristotle, An.
pr. 1. 23, 40 b 23–25 [1989, 3, slightly modified]). Accordingly, all syllogisms, including
syllogisms ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως, are regarded as inferences whose premises and conclu-
sions are predicative propositions or contain predicative propositions, even if this
fact does not have to play any role in the logical form of these inferences. Hence,
even presuppositional inferences need nothing “further”, nothing to be added “from
outside” (ἔξωϑεν), i.e., a “term” (ὅϱος) contained in an additional premise, in order
to be a compelling consequence. Incidentally, in his commentary on the passage in
question, 24 b 18–22, Ebert himself points out that Aristotle’s word ὅρος is not only
used in the sense of “term”: rather Aristotle “here and also elsewhere in the Analytics
often speaks of a term but means a statement in which this term occurs” (Ebert &
Nortmann 2007, 227). It is thus not at all inconsistent when Aristotle designates pre-
suppositional inferences (and thus what I treat here and in what follows as hypothe-
tical syllogisms) as syllogisms without any reservation.

§ 46 Notation
In addition to the signs introduced in § 42, in this section two further signs will be
needed. They are the logical constants ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ and ‘D ( )’ (with at least two
empty places). A two-place relational expression of the form H (A, B) stands for
the hypothetical proposition in the sense of § 47, def. 2. The n-place relational

expression D (A1, . . ., An) with n ≧2, stands for the disjunctive proposition in the
sense of § 47, def. 3.
§ 47 Definitions
1. A is a formula of the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic if and only if A sa-
tisfies one of the following conditions: (a) A is a negatable expression (in the
sense of § 43, def. 1), or (b) A is a hypothetical or disjunctive proposition.
2. A is a hypothetical proposition, i.e., A equals H (B, C) (in words: if B, then C), if and
only if, if B, C, and D are formulas of the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic,
and for any interpretation in which B, C, and D, are propositions which have one of
the two truth values, then the following holds: A is true if and only if C follows reg-
ularly from B (according to § 43, def. 3), so that B is incompatible with N C and, in
case C has the form N D, also incompatible with D.
Scholium: Hypothetical propositions can be rendered with ‘if-then’- proposi-
tions. They are, according to the definitions just given, not truth functions; i.e., the
truth value of a hypothetical proposition does not depend exclusively on the truth
value of its clauses. To be sure, it is only true if these values are distributed in a
certain way among its clauses. But this distribution is not sufficient to make it true.
Nor does it suffice that its antecedent is false. Only in one of the four rows of the
main column of the truth table for H (A, B) is a definite value (namely, the value F)
fixed by the truth values of both clauses; for the remaining three rows, no such
value exists. The question marks in these rows do not stand for a third truth
value – say, the value indefinite –, but merely indicate that the truth value in the
three cases is not sufficiently determined by the truth values of the clauses:
The view that only the occurrence of a consequence (ἀκολουϑία, consequentia) can
make a hypothetical proposition true corresponds to a doctrine widespread since
antiquity, according to which the meaning of an ‘if-then’ proposition must be made
explicit with the aid of the concept of consequence. Sextus Empiricus reports:

Part II Section Two Hypothetical and Disjunctive Syllogistic

Now all the dialecticians agree in asserting that a conditional holds whenever its conse-
quent follows from its antecedent; but as to when and how it follows, they disagree with
one another and set forth conflicting criteria for this ‘following’. (Sextus Empiricus, Adv.
Math. VIII, 112 [Mates 1973, 97])179
The Stoic Chrysippus seems to have been the logician among those Sextus Empiri-
cus reports on who held the view that ‘if p, then q’ means that the negation of q
“conflicts” with the antecedent p (Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrronhism II, 112).
Accordingly, Chrysippus explained the consequence found in a hypothetical propo-
sition in a similar way as Lewis and Langford (1932, 154) explained the relation
they called ‘strict implication’: “That p strictly implies q means that p is inconsistent
with the denial of q.” The distinction between Chrysippus’ conception and that of
Langford and Lewis lies merely in that Chrysippus seems not to have made explicit
what he called negation and conflict by means of unambiguously truth-functional
expressions. If we replace all truth-functional signs which occur in the expression
‘~ ◇(p & ~ q)’ (which for Lewis and Langford renders the strict implication of q by
p) with non-truth-functional signs, as per § 30, then we get an expression – ‘NM (p,
N q)’ –, which according to my definition of the hypothetical proposition is equiva-
lent to ‘if p, then q’ and is suited to explicate Chrysippus’ explanation of the hypo-
thetical proposition at least no less than the definition of strict implication.
While in the above definition the meaning of ‘if . . ., then . . .’ is traced back
to the meaning of the concept of regular consequence, it seems to have been an
interest of Stoic logic to be able to explain, conversely, the meaning of the concept
of consequence with the aid of the truth conditions of the hypothetical proposi-
tion. They apparently wanted to determine what a demonstrative consequence is
by means of the concept of a true hypothetical proposition:
[Inferences] are valid whenever the conditional whose antecedent is the conjunction of the
premises and whose consequent is the conclusion, is sound. (Sextus, Outlines of Pyrhhonism
II, 137 [Mates 1996, 147])180
Accordingly, the idea that the meaning of ‘if . . ., then . . .’ can be fixed with the aid
of the concept of regular consequence cannot have been completely foreign even to
Sextus Empiricus reports on the various approaches which especially in Stoic and Megarian
logic were made to more precisely specify the truth conditions of the hypothetical proposition in his
Outlines of Pyrrhonism, II, 110–11. According to this report, Philo of Megara held a truth-functional
reading of the hypothetical proposition: “For Philo says that a true conditional is one which does
not have a true antecedent and a false consequent; for example, when it is day and I am conversing,
‘If it is day, then I am conversing’” (Mates 1973, 109). – Cf. Ebert 1991, 84–130; 319.

the Stoics. Namely, they maintained181 that it results from the meaning of ‘if . . .,
then . . .’ that both the hypothetical syllogisms they took to be elementary, modus
ponendo ponens and modus tollendo tollens, are valid syllogisms. They thus main-
tained that anyone who assumes a proposition of the form H (A, B) as true immedi-
ately also assumes that B follows from A (so that once A or N B is a second premise,
then B or N A, respectively, is regarded as the conclusion of a valid inference). –
According to Michael Frede’s account, the Stoics took their departure from the fact
that a hypothetical proposition is always “the expression of a supposition that can
possibly be demonstrated about the connection of states of affairs,” while con-
versely logicians like Aristotle and Theophrastus tended to regard hypothetical
propositions as “the expression of an understanding that something should be
treated as demonstrated or refuted if something else has been demonstrated or re-
futed” (Frede 1974, 16).182 – The definition I have adopted corresponds more to the
Aristotelian than to the Stoic conception of the hypothetical proposition. What a
hypothetical proposition is can be explained by what it means for a proposition
that is to be proved to follow from an already accepted proposition, or by what it
means for a proposition that is to be disproved to follow from another, already dis-
proved proposition.
3. A is a disjunctive proposition, i.e., A equals D (A1, . . ., An), with n > 1 (in words:
either A1, or . . ., or An), if and only if, for any interpretation in which A1, . . ., An are
true or false propositions, the following condition is satisfied: A is true if and only if
from one of the propositions A1, . . ., An the negation of each of the remaining prop-
ositions regularly follows (i.e., when from Ai, with n ≧i ≧1, N Ak, with n ≧k ≧i,
regularly follows), and if from the negation of one of the propositions A1, . . ., An,
exactly one of the remaining propositions regularly follows (i.e., when from N Ai,
with n ≧i ≧1, exactly one of the propositions Ak, with n ≧k ≠i, regularly follows).
Scholium: The disjunctive proposition is not a truth function either. It is not
sufficient for the truth of a disjunctive proposition that exactly one of its clauses
is true. Hence, the truth table for the disjunctive compound is necessarily gappy,
and its main column contains only the value F when the truth values of the
clauses are clearly determined. For example, the table for the three-member dis-
junctive compound looks like this:

Part II Section Two Hypothetical and Disjunctive Syllogistic

In order to make clear the distinction between a truth-functional and non-truth-
functional disjunctive compound, consider an example which was discussed in
ancient logic:183
The proposition ‘Either now is day, or now is night’ is on a truth-functionally
understood ‘either . . ., or . . .’ already true when it is now (let’s say at noon
on January 30, 2009) day and not night. Whether there is a point in time apart
from day and night, whether there is even a division of the totality of alternatives,
is irrelevant according to this understanding of the truth of the proposition. As a
truth function, the same proposition would also be true if its second part would
have stated: ‘. . ., or triangles have only two corners’. But as a complete enumera-
tion of alternatives, the proposition is not at all true, and thus, as a disjunctive
proposition in the sense of the definition established above, is false. Otherwise,
the second premise in the following inference should not be true and the conclu-
sion should not be false (see Alexander, In an. pr. 374, 25 ff.):
Either now is night or now is day.
If nothing exists now [that would bring about the distinction of day and night], now is not
night.
Thus: if nothing exists now [that would bring about the distinction of day and night], now
is day.

On the meaning of ‘(either) . . . or . . .’ there was a discussion in ancient logic which mirrors
quite exactly the one concerning the meaning of ‘if . . ., then . . .’. According to Mates (1973, 51),
two types of disjunction were distinguished by the Stoics, the exclusive and the inclusive. Inclusive
disjunction corresponds to modern (truth-functional) adjunction (‘p or q, or both p and q’). Yet
some Stoics demand incompatibility for disjunctive members (1973, 52–53), and thus exclusivity.
This reading seems to correspond to modern (truth-functional) bisubtraction – ‘p or q, but not
both’ –, as long as only two-membered disjunctions are considered. However, Frede (1974, 96)
mentions Plutarch’s statement (De Sollertia Animalium 969 A) that a many-membered disjunction
must be “complete” “if it is possible neither that the members are true together, nor that they are
false together.” This statement belongs to a tradition which Kant (see CPR § 9) was part of as well.
2 Principles § 47
163

Since the concluding proposition is clearly false, and since the second premise is
undeniably true, the first premise cannot be true. But since it is a disjunctive
proposition, and since it is now day and not night, it can be a false proposition
only in terms of the definition of a disjunction, i.e., not as a truth function.
§ 48 Basic Rules
If A, A1, . . ., An, B, and C are formulas which admit an interpretation as propositions
which have one of the two truth values, then the following rules (II. 1) to (II. 4) are
valid:
1. Extension of the system of metalogical reduction rules:
Principle of conditionalization:184
Ai, . . ., Ak, B ∴C / Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (B, C) (with i ≧0 and k ≧i)
(II. 1)
The validity of this basic rule rests on the definitions of the hypothetical proposi-
tion and of logical consequence. By the sign ‘∴’ on the left side of ‘/’ in (II. 1) it is
expressed that C follows logically from the premises Ai, . . . Ak and therefore can-
not be false, if (in addition to these premises) B is also true. This means that, as
per § 43, def. 4, ‘H (B, C)’ follows logically from the same premises.
2. Basic rule of the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic:
Modus ponendo ponens:
H (A, B), A ∴B
(II. 2)
Scholium: There is evidence that Aristotle and his students, as well as the Megar-
ian logicians, regarded modus ponendo ponens as not further reduceable. (See my
preliminary remark to this Section and Frede 1974, p. 15–18)
3. Reduction of disjunctions to hypothetical propositions:
Reduction of two-membered disjunctions:
D (A1, A2) : : H (A1, N A2), H (N A1, A2), H (N A2, A1), H (A2, N A1)
(II. 3)
Reduction of three-membered disjunctions:
D (A1, A2, A3) : : H (D (A1, A2), N A3),
H (D (A1, A3), N A2),
H (D (A2, A3), N A1),

3 Derivation of Formulas of the Hypothetical
and Disjunctive Syllogistic
§ 49 Derived Rules
If A, A1, . . ., An, B, and C are formulas which admit an interpretation as propositions
which have one of the two truth values, then the following rules (II. 5) to (II. 27), for
example, are valid:
1. Metalogical rules:
Deconditionalization of a conclusion:
Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (B, C) / Ai, . . ., Ak, B ∴C (with i ≧0 and k ≧0)
(II. 5)
Derivation:
[1]
(Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (C, D)), (H (C, D), C ∴D) /
(Ai, . . ., Ak, C ∴D)
[2]
Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (C, D) / Ai, . . ., Ak, C ∴D
Line [1] is an application case of the metalogical basic rule (I. 3), with H (C, D) for B
and with C for Cm, . . ., Cn. Line [2] indicates that in line [1] the inference formula H
(C, D), C ∴D may be omitted for the sake of abbreviation, since it renders modus
ponendo ponens (II. 2) and thus an already universally valid rule.
Scholium: The metalogical rules rendered by (II. 1) and (II. 5) stand together at
the basis of a rule that was used in Stoic logic (see below the scholium to (II. 29)).
Idempotency rule:185
Ai . . ., Ak, A1, A1 ∴D / A1, Ai, . . ., Ak ∴D (with i ≧0, k ≧i)
(II. 6)
According to definition 4 in § 43, the proposition D logically follows from two
identical propositions A1 and A1 in conjunction with other propositions if and
only if D follows regularly from all these propositions and this consequence de-
pends only on the definition of the logical constants that occur in these proposi-
tions or in D. Whether A1 occurs more than once among the premises of D is thus

irrelevant to whether D follows from A1. In other words: basic rules remain valid
if their antecedents are duplicated, as, e.g., with these transformations of (II. 2):
H (A, B), A, A ∴B,
H (A, B), H (A, B), A ∴B.
2. Rules of hypothetical inference:

Proof:
[1] A, H (A, B) ∴B
(II. 2)
[2] N B, H (A, B) ∴N A
(I. 2) [1]
Scholium: The Stoics counted inferences according to modus tollendo tollens among
elementary inferences, i.e., those which are valid, but ‘unprovable’ and not further
reducible. The validity of these inferences, as well as the validity of the inferences of
modus ponendo ponens, depends in their view directly on the meaning of the logical
constants which occur in their hypothetical premises (see Frede 1974, 199). It is sus-
pected – even if we lack unambiguous evidence for it – that Aristotle and his stu-
dents, as well as the Megarian logicians, regarded modus tollendo tollens as an
elementary rule, i.e., as not further reducible (compare Frede 1974, 16–18).
Contraposition:
H (A, B) ∴H (N B, N A)
(II. 8)
Proof:
[1] H (A, B), N B ∴N A
(II. 7)
[2] H (A, B) ∴H (N B, N A)
(II. 1) [1]
Scholium: Aristotle mentions this mode of inference in Analytica priora 2. 2, 53 b
12 f. (1989, 66) with the words: “For if it is necessary for B to be when A is, then
when B is not it is necessary for A not to be.” It is worth mentioning that Aristotle
here uses letter symbols not as concept variables, but rather as place-holders for
something that is true or false.

Scholium: By negating A, B, or C and by exchanging their places as antecedents or
consequents of hypothetical propositions, many types of hypothetical syllogisms
can be produced. Theophrastus is supposed to have systematically organized
these types, after the example of Aristotle’s division of categorical syllogisms, ac-
cording to three ‘figures’ of purely hypothetical syllogisms. See Kneale & Kneale
(1975, 110). According to their account, which is based on Alexander of Aphrodisias’
commentary on Aristotle’s Prior Analytics (Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca II. 1,
326), Aristotle provides an instance of the basic form (II. 13) of the purely hypotheti-
cal syllogism with the following inference: “[I]f it is necessary for an animal to be if
a man is, and a substance if an animal is, then it is necessary for a substance to be
if a man is [. . .]” (cf. An. pr. 1. 32, 47 a 28–30 [1989, 51]). Within Stoic logic, appar-
ently none of the types of purely hypothetical syllogisms found consideration, al-
though these types can, as the proof we just carried out for their basic form shows,
be reduced to the syllogisms that the Stoics regarded as elementary. In Frede’s
view (1974, 183 and 197), Stoic logic was systematically incomplete, since it did not
permit such a reduction. (See, by contrast, the above proof.)

Scholium: Aristotle discusses a variant of (II. 14), namely the inference from two
premises of the form (1) H (p, q) and (2) H (N p, q), in An. pr. 2. 4, 57 a 36–b 17. He
seems here to want to reject the inference to p. According to William & Martha
Kneale (1975, 97), Aristotle argues roughly as follows: by contraposition on (1) (i.e.,
on the basis of (II. 8)) we get: (3) H (N q, N p). From (3) and (2), following the rule
of the completely hypothetical syllogism (II. 13), we get the further consequence:
(4) H (N q, q). The Kneales suppose that Aristotle should infer from here to q,
since the inverse of peritrope (II. 10) is applicable. But they hereby tacitly assume
that the inverse of peritrope, as well as peritrope itself, permit not only the infer-
ence to NN p, but also the inference to p.

Scholium: Among the five syllogisms which the Stoics took to be elementary (i.e.,
valid but ‘unprovable’) are two rules which correspond to (II. 21) and (II. 22). On the
Stoic view, they are valid on the basis of the meaning of the logical constants which
occur in the major premise of the disjunctive syllogism (see Frede 1974, 199). It is
suspected (though we lack unambiguous evidence for it) that the Stoics were not
alone in this view, but that Aristotle and the Megarians also recognized elementary
disjunctive syllogisms (cf. Frede 1974, 16–18).

3 Derivation of Formulas of the Hypothetical and Disjunctive Syllogistic § 49
173

§ 50 Conditionalization
1. Derivation of metalogical rules
If A, B, and C are formulas of deductive logic, then a metalogical rule is valid
which corresponds to the following schema:
Rule of conditionalization:
✶, B ∴C / ✶∴H (B, C)
(II. 28)
Derivation:
[1] Ai, . . ., Ak, B ∴C / Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (B, C)
(II. 1)
[2]
✶, B ∴C / ✶∴H (B, C)
Line [2] results from the substitution of the empty premise set (which here and in
what follows is designated with the asterisk ‘✶’) for Ai, . . ., Ak.188 This substitution is
permitted since the regular consequence of C from B rendered by ‘H (B, C)’, accord-
ing to § 43, def. 3, is a necessary condition for the logical consequence of C from B,
even if this consequence is independent of other premises.
Scholium: The supposition that a statement follows logically from the empty
premise set is equivalent to the supposition that this statement is logically valid.
Hence, one may, in case C follows logically from B, proceed to ‘✶∴H (B, C)’ and from
there to ‘H (B, C)’.
Generalized rule of conditionalization:
A1, Ai, . . ., An ∴B / ✶∴H (A1, H (Ai, H (. . ., H (An, B))) . . .)
(with i ≧1, n ≧i)
(II. 29)
Derivation:
[1]
A1, Ai, . . ., An ∴B / A1, . . . An–1 ∴H (An, B)
(II. 1)
[2]
A1, . . ., An–1 ∴H (An, B) /
A1, . . ., An–2, H (An–1, H (An, B))
(II. 1)
⋮
In the use of this notation here and in what follows, I follow Carnap (1934, § 31 and § 47).
The talk of an empty premise set is perhaps easily misunderstood. The little star ✶is meant to
indicate that the full transformation of an inference schema into a propositional schema through
conditionalization has come to completion. Such a completion comes about as soon as all premise
schema which belonged to the conditionalized inference schema have been converted into (more
or less nested) ‘if’-propositions. In other words, ‘A follows logically from the empty premise set’
basically means: ‘A is valid because the consequent C of A (= H (B, C)) logically follows from the
antecedent B of A.’

Scholium: The generalized conditionalization rule corresponds to a metalogical
basic rule which, according to Jan Łukasiewicz (1935, 115), was already a Stoic prin-
ciple. However, that principle must have been stronger than (II. 29), since it was
supposed to have said that an inference is valid if and only if a hypothetical state-
ment is true whose antecedent consists in a conjunction of premises and whose
consequent is identical with the conclusion. That is, the Stoics must have recog-
nized the inverse counterpart of the generalized rule of conditionalization as well,
i.e., (II. 30). Compare on this the account in Sextus Empiricus, Adv. Math., VIII,
415–23. In his book Stoic Logic (1973, 74–77, and Appendix A, 106–8), Benson Mates
has compared the Stoic principle highlighted by Łukasiewicz with the one he him-
self calls ‘principle of conditionalization’. This principle says: “If a conclusion β is
validly derivable from the premises α1, α2, . . ., αn, then the conditional proposition
‘(α1, α2, . . ., αn) ⊃β’ is logically true” (Mates 1973, 74–75). Mates certainly empha-
sizes: (1) the Stoics formulated their principle always as an equivalence claim, not
merely as a conditional proposition; (2) the contexts in which the Stoic principle
appears are always those in which Sextus interprets the Stoics as attempting to
give a criterion for the validity of inferences; (3) ‘logically true’ should be replaced
with another expression – Mates himself proposes replacing it with “Diodorian-
true”; and (4) there is no evidence available showing the Stoics using their principle
as a rule of inference. It would be appropriate to add a fifth point, namely: (5) the
Stoics understood ‘if . . ., then . . .’ not in the sense of ‘. . . ⊃. . .’, i.e., not in the Phil-
onic sense.189 – On the question of whether and in which way the Stoics used what
Mates has called a conditionalization principle, compare Frede (1974, 105–6).
I have taken up the word ‘conditionalization principle’ to label something
else than Mates does, namely the rule represented by (II. 1). Because the remain-
ing conditionalization rules (II. 5) and (II. 28) to (II. 30) depend on this latter rule,
I consider the deviation from Mates’ way of designating appropriate.
Deconditionalization (the converse counterpart to the generalized rule of conditionalization):
✶∴H (A1, H (Ai, H (. . ., H (An, B))) . . .) / ✶, A1, Ai, . . ., An ∴B

2. Derived universally valid propositional schemata
By conditionalization according to (II. 28), any universally valid rule of deductive
logic can be transformed into a formula which in the appropriate interpretation
becomes a nested hypothetical proposition which is logically valid. In what fol-
lows, I will call such a formula a ‘universally valid propositional schema’.
If A, B, and C are formulas of deductive logic, then the expressions (II. 31) to
(II. 33) are universally valid propositional schemata.
✶∴H (A, NN A) (with A ≠N B, for arbitrary B)

Proof:
[1] A ∴NN A

[2]
✶, A ∴NN A / ✶∴H (A, NN A)
(II. 28)
[3]
✶∴H (A, NN A)

From modus ponendo ponens, we can get the following universally valid proposi-
tional schema:
✶∴H (A, H (H (A, B), B A))
(II. 32)
Proof:
[1] A, H (A, B) ∴B

from modus ponendo ponens as well, e.g., the following:

Scholium: In light of the formulas which can be gained from universally valid rules,
an interesting distinction arises between forms of nested hypothetical propositions
on the one hand and forms of similarly nested subjunctions and forms of likewise
nested ‘strict implications’, as they were introduced by Wilhelm Ackermann.190
Compare, e.g., with formula (II. 32) the two following, similarly nested expres-
sions in which the arrow, ‘. . . →. . .’, indicates the relation of strict implication:
A →((A →B) →B),
A →(B →A).
According to Wilhelm Ackermann, neither of these two formulas are universally
valid. If ‘. . . →. . .’ were read as subjunction, then both formulas would be univer-
sally valid. If ‘. . . →. . .’ were taken as the hypothetical propositional connective,
then the first formula would be valid, but not the second.
