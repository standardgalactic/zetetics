If colrect mental ,and phl,sical typing habits are established,
t1'ping speed foilorvs as a matter: of course through tvping practice.
One of the best rnethods of increasing t-vping speeci is b,v repetition
l.ork. Talie an1, selection f,r'om a booli or magazine and rvrite it over
ancl o,-er again, smoothlv and rhvthmicalll'. lieep on n'riting it
until 1.ou can tlrpe it accuratelv ancl at a goocl rate of speed. Then,
take anothcr selection ancl repeat. You rvill discover that the increased
speed *trich 1'ou gainerl as a result of t1'ping one selection again
and again carries orrer to an extent into vorir general tvping speed.
It requires discipline to tvpe the same selection many times, but there
is no surer road to typing speed.

Perhaps you u,ill find that you har.'e a tenclencv to repeat certain
errors in tvping. If that is the case, trv to discor''er the leasons for'

up in knots. Relax consciouslv and see if there is not an immecliate
inrprovement in the ease l'ith rvhich you can tvpe. ff 1'9u have a
feeling of tenseness and hurry, you are not properl-v relaxed.
Whoever ltas n'atched a charnpion typist clemonstrate must have
been impressed b1' one thing-the perfect rhvthrn of the operator.
No ierks, no spasms, but a smooth, efforrtless tnovement that is a
revclation to rvitch. Rhythm is the secret of typing skill.
