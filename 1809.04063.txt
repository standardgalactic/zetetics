Abstract
The double copy is a map from non-abelian gauge theories to gravity, that has been demon-
strated both for scattering amplitudes and exact classical solutions. In this study, we reconsider
the double copy for exact solutions that are self-dual in either the gauge or gravity theory. In
this case, one may formulate a general double copy in terms of a certain diﬀerential operator,
which generates the gauge and gravity solutions from a harmonic function residing in a biadjoint
scalar theory. As an illustration, we examine the single copy of the well-known Eguchi-Hanson
instanton in gravity. The gauge ﬁeld thus obtained represents an abelian-like object whose ﬁeld
is dipole-like at large distances, and which has no magnetic or electric charge.

Introduction
Classical and quantum aspects of various ﬁeld theories continue to be intensely studied, due to
a plethora of applications in astro-, high energy and condensed matter physics. Particularly in-
teresting in recent times have been newly discovered correspondences between diﬀerent theories,
whose domains of application in nature are widely separated. In this paper, we focus on the double
copy [1–3], a correspondence between gauge theories and gravity 5. In its original form, the double

copy relates perturbative scattering amplitudes in the two types of theory, subject to a certain
mirroring of colour and kinematic information, BCJ duality [1], being made manifest in the gauge
theory. The relationship is proven to hold at tree level [3–11], where it has a string theoretic expla-
nation [12]. Although a full loop level proof has not been found, there is highly non-trivial evidence
that the double copy works at higher orders in perturbation theory in a wide variety of theories
(with and without supsersymmetry) [2,13–35], including all-order evidence in some cases [36–43].
Another relationship, the zeroth copy, relates amplitudes in gauge theory to those in a biadjoint
scalar theory, i.e. containing a scalar ﬁeld interacting via two diﬀerent types of colour charge.
The highly non-trivial nature of the above results has prompted many to ponder whether the dou-
ble and zeroth copies are an accident of scattering amplitudes in perturbation theory, or instead
indicative of a deeper – and hitherto undiscovered – connection between biadjoint scalar, gauge
and gravity theories. Indeed, the double and zeroth copies can be extended to a class of exact
classical solutions. The best understood family is that of time-independent Kerr-Schild metrics in
gravity [44], where the graviton ﬁeld has a highly speciﬁc form involving an outer product of a single
null vector. Extensions to this class have been considered in [45,46], where the single Kerr-Schild
and / or time independence properties can be at least partially relaxed (see also ref. [47] for a
discussion of whether the source terms in the gauge and gravity theory are related, in addition to
the ﬁelds). Non-exact classical solutions have also been examined: refs. [48–56] set up a broad pro-
gramme for identifying linearised ﬁelds in a wide variety of exotic theories, and in a gauge-invariant
manner. Furthermore, classical scattering processes can be double copied order-by-order in per-
turbation theory [47,57–66], which promises to vastly streamline the calculation of astrophysically
relevant observables in classical General Relativity, such as those related to gravitational waves.
In a wider context, the double and zeroth copies have a natural embedding in the so-called CHY
equations [67,68], which themselves are obtainable from ambitwistor string theory [69]. These and
other considerations have recently led to extensions of the copies to curved spacetimes [70–72], and
to double ﬁeld theory [73]. Recently, the double copy has been used to motivate the algebraic
classiﬁcation of higher-dimensional gravity solutions [74].
Despite these ongoing eﬀorts, a full understanding of the scope and generality of the double copy
remains elusive. This underlines the importance of having diﬀerent ways of thinking about the
copy where it applies, and of looking at diﬀerent sectors of gauge and gravity theories for which the
copy is particularly clear. One such sector is that of solutions to the equations of the motion where
the ﬁeld is self-dual, which has the eﬀect of projecting out one of the physical polarisation states of
the gluon or graviton. It was shown some time ago that the amplitude double copy has a partic-
ularly natural form in the self-dual sector [10,11,75], with the added bonus that the BCJ duality
property required for gauge theory amplitudes to satisfy the double copy can be fully interpreted.
This already suggests that a reexamination of the self-dual sector could be fruitful for gaining new
insights. Furthermore, the ﬁrst paper to explore the double copy of exact classical solutions [44]
pointed out that the properties of self-dual amplitudes can be recast in a Kerr-Schild language,
but where the null vectors are interpreted as diﬀerential operators. The motivation for exploring
the self-dual sector in ref. [44] was to demonstrate that the Kerr-Schild copy for classical solutions
was merely a diﬀerent manifestation of the previously described double copy for amplitudes of
refs. [1–3]. However, implications of the self-dual Kerr-Schild double copy for classical solutions
were not followed up, and it is the aim of this paper to explore this in more detail.
2

Remarkably, a related story for exact classical solutions goes all the way back to ref. [76], which re-
alised that null electromagnetic ﬁelds could be associated with self-dual Kerr-Schild gravity metrics.
We will review this argument in what follows, interpreting the results from a modern viewpoint.
More speciﬁcally, we will see that given a harmonic scalar function, we may apply a particular
vector diﬀerential operator to generate a self-dual solution to the Maxwell equations. A second
application of the same operator generates a Kerr-Schild graviton, and thus one generates a ladder
of ﬁelds residing in biadjoint scalar, gauge and gravity theories. That this is consistent with the
BCJ double copy for amplitudes follows from the results of ref. [44].
As an example of the procedure, we examine a particular harmonic function (ﬁrst studied in ref. [76])
that gives rise to the Eguchi-Hanson solution [77–79], which enjoys a well-known interpretation as
a gravitational instanton. We use the self-dual Kerr-Schild approach to study the single copy of
this solution. The single copy is a solution of the (abelian) Maxwell equations, whose electric and
magnetic ﬁelds are dipole-like at large distances. Unlike previously considered solutions, however,
there is no magnetic charge, nor (by self-duality) any electric charge anywhere in space. Further-
more, the fact that the single copy is abelian-like rather than non-abelian is itself interesting, given
that one might have expected the single copy of the Eguchi-Hanson instanton to be a non-abelian
instanton e.g. the BPST instanton of ref. [80]. Parallels between these instanton solutions were
noted even at the inception of the Eguchi-Hanson solution [77] (see e.g. ref. [81] for a more modern
review, and refs. [82, 83] for studies in the context of noncommutative theories). Our results will
thus have interesting implications for attempts to study non-perturbative aspects of the double
copy, including those that attempt to identify symmetries and / or topological invariants in gauge
and gravity theories.
The structure of our paper is as follows. We brieﬂy review the Kerr-Schild double copy in section 2,
including aspects relating to the self-dual sector. In section 3, we examine in detail the single and
zeroth copies of the Eguchi-Hanson solution, including a discussion of topological properties. We
discuss our results and conclude in section 4.

Self-dual Kerr-Schild solutions
In this section, we brieﬂy review the properties of the Kerr-Schild double copy, including its formu-
lation tailored to self-dual solutions. More details can be found in ref. [44]. We start by considering
a solution gµν to Einstein gravity. Expanding around ﬂat space, we may deﬁne a graviton ﬁeld hµν
via
gµν = ηµν + κhµν,
(1)
where ηµν is the Minkowski metric, and κ2 = 16πGN, with GN the Newton constant. The metric
gµν is of Kerr-Schild form if the graviton ﬁeld can be written as
hµν = Φ kµ kν,
(2)
where Φ is a scalar ﬁeld, and kµ is null and geodesic:
k2 = 0,
k · ∂kµ = 0.
(3)
3

Upon substituting the ansatz of eqs. (1–3) into the Einstein equations, one ﬁnds that the Ricci
tensor Rµν truncates at linear order in κ, so that the graviton obtained from Φ and kµ constitutes
an exact gravitational solution. Reference [44] proved that, given any time-independent Kerr-Schild
graviton, the vector ﬁeld
Aa
µ = caΦ kµ
(4)
(where ca is an arbitrary colour vector) is a solution of the abelian Yang-Mills (Maxwell) equations
∂µF a
µν = 0.
(5)
Thus, any such gravity solution has a well-deﬁned gauge theory counterpart, which can be inter-
preted as the “single copy” of the former. Furthermore, upon repeating the procedure of replacing
one of the null vectors kµ with an arbitrary colour vector, one obtains the single scalar ﬁeld
Φaa′ = ca˜ca′Φ,
(6)
that is found to satisfy the linearised biadjoint scalar ﬁeld equation
∂2Φaa′ = 0.
(7)
Thus, the ﬁeld Φaa′ is to be regarded as the “zeroth copy” associated with the gravity solution
hµν and gauge ﬁeld Aµ, and a number of non-trivial examples of this correspondence were given in
ref. [44], including the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. Extensions to include multiple Kerr-
Schild-like terms were considered in ref. [45], for which the Taub-NUT solution [84,85] was found
to be a special case. Time dependence was also added in ref. [46], which considered an arbitrarily
accelerating point charge (mass) in gauge theory (gravity). Known amplitudes for photon and
graviton Bremstrahlung were recovered as part of this picture, making clear that the Kerr-Schild
double copy for classical solutions is a manifestation of the same double copy that relates scattering
amplitudes in biadjoint scalar, gauge and gravity theories.
In this paper, we focus on solutions that are self-dual, namely those satisfying 6
Fµν = ˜Fµν ≡i

(8)
and

(9)
in gauge theory and gravity respectively, where Fµν (Rµνλσ) is the ﬁeld strength tensor (Riemann
curvature), and ϵµνρσ the Levi-Cevita symbol. Physically, such solutions correspond to keeping only
one of the two physical polarisation states of the photon or graviton, and for such solutions one
may think about the Kerr-Schild double copy in a diﬀerent way. Namely, one may formulate the
Kerr-Schild vector kµ as a diﬀerential operator ˆkµ, which amounts to considering it as multiplicative
in momentum rather than position space. The symmetry of the resulting graviton
hµν = ˆkµ ˆkν Φ
(10)
6Equations (8) and (9) are presented for Lorentzian signature in four dimensions. In the Euclidean case that
follows, these equations must be modiﬁed with the i being absent.
4

then implies that [ˆkµ, ˆkν] = 0 i.e. ˆkµ commutes with itself. Furthermore, we may implement the
null and geodesic Kerr-Schild conditions as
ηµνˆkµˆkν = 0,
ˆk · ∂= 0 .

v = t + iz
√

X = ix −y
√

Y = ix + y
√
2 ,
(12)
where, following ref. [76], we deﬁne (u, v, X, Y ) in terms of Euclidean Cartesian coordinates (t, x, y, z)
in R4. The operator ˆkµ may now be chosen as
ˆku = ∂X,
kv = 0,
kX = 0,
kY = ∂v,
(13)
and we may then show that the Einstein equations for the graviton of eq. (10) reduce to
∂2Φ + κ{∂XΦ, ∂uΦ} = 0,
(14)
where we introduced the Poisson bracket of two functions f and g:
{f, g} = (∂Xf)(∂ug) −(∂uf)(∂Xg) .
(15)
Equation (14) is the Plebanski equation describing self-dual gravity, and a similar equation can be
obtained for Yang-Mills theory by considering the Kerr-Schild single copy ﬁeld
Aa
µ = ˆkµΦa,
(16)
for an adjoint-valued scalar ﬁeld Φ = ΦaTa, where Ta is a generator of the gauge group. With this
ansatz, the Yang-Mills equations turn out to imply
∂2Φ + 2ig[∂vΦ, ∂XΦ] = 0,
(17)
a known equation7 for self-dual Yang-Mills theory ﬁrst derived in ref. [86], and studied within a
double copy context in ref. [75], where it was used to argue that amplitudes in the self-dual sector
are manifest double copies of each other. Furthermore, a kinematic algebra underlying the numer-
ators of self-dual amplitudes was obtained, that provided an explicit realisation of the BCJ duality
between colour and kinematic degrees of freedom. The identiﬁcation of eq. (16) makes clear that
the Kerr-Schild single copy for self-dual solutions is indeed the same as the double copy as originally
formulated for amplitudes. However, it can also be noted that eq. (16) is equally valid for exact
classical solutions. In this context, this approach is actually a modern reinterpretation of the much
earlier ref. [76], which also recognised that self-dual Kerr-Schild gravitons could be associated with
null Maxwell ﬁelds.
We may adapt the argument of ref. [76] to the above discussion as follows. First, we rewrite the
Plebanski equation of eq. (14) as
Φ,uv −Φ,XY = −Φ,vvΦ,XX + (Φ,vX)2,
(18)
7The form of eq. (17) diﬀers slightly from that given in refs. [75,86], due to diﬀerent conventions for the lightcone
coordinates and Kerr-Schild operator.
5

where the comma denotes the partial derivative. The metric of eq. (10) can be written
ds2 = 2du dv −2dX dY −2κ
 Φ,XXdu2 + 2Φ,vXdu dY + Φ,vvdY 2
,
(19)
where we have used the form of the Minkowski metric
ηµν = 2du dv −2dX dY
(20)
in the lightcone coordinates of eq. (12). However, if the metric of eq. (20) is to be in Kerr-Schild
form, then the O(κ) term must be a perfect square, which in turn implies
Φ,vvΦ,XX −(Φ,vX)2 = 0.
(21)
Coupled with the requirement of self-duality, eq. (18), this implies that the function Φ must be
harmonic.
But this is none other than the requirement that the ﬁeld Φ satisfy the linearised
biadjoint scalar equation of eq. (7). Thus, we can summarise the results of ref. [76] from a double
copy point of view as follows: given a harmonic function Φ, we may consider the ﬁelds
Φ,
Aµ = ˆkµΦ,
hµν = ˆkµ ˆkνΦ,
living in a biadjoint scalar, gauge and gravity theory respectively 8. The ﬁelds Aµ and Φ constitute
the classical single and zeroth copies of the graviton hµν respectively. Having set up the general
framework for self-dual classical solutions, we now consider a particular example in detail.

The Eguchi-Hanson solution
In the previous section, we described a procedure for generating gauge theory and graviton ﬁelds
obeying the double copy, by acting upon a harmonic function in lightcone coordinates with the
diﬀerential operator of eq. (13). In this section, we study a particular example in detail, namely
the Eguchi-Hanson solution of Euclidean gravity, originally derived in refs. [77], and interpreted in
more detail in refs. [78, 79, 87]. A conventional way to present this solution is to choose a radial
coordinate r in R4, and three Euler angles
0 ≤θ ≤π,
0 ≤φ ≤2π,
0 ≤ψ ≤4π,
(22)
such that the line element may be written

(23)
where
σx = 1
2(sin ψ dθ −sin θ cos ψ dφ),
σy = 1
2(−cos ψ dθ −sin θ sin ψ dφ),
8Strictly speaking, we must dress the biadjoint and gauge ﬁelds with arbitrary colour vectors as in eqs. (4, 6).
However, given that the equations of motion linearise in each theory for the solutions considered, we can ignore this
unless otherwise stated.

σz = 1
2(dψ + cos θ dφ).
(24)
With this choice of coordinates, the topology of the spacetime is that of R+ × S3, although it has
a singularity at r = a. We can characterise the topology in four spacetime dimensions using two
invariants, namely the Hirzebruch signature τ and the Euler characteristic χ (see e.g. [88] for a
review). These receive contributions from the bulk of the spacetime, and the boundary, and are
both zero for R+ × S3 [77] (n.b. to get this result, it is crucial that one includes the boundary
contribution from the singularity at r = a).
However, one can also construct a topologically non-trivial spacetime from the above metric, by
removing the singularity at r = a [78]. Changing variables to
u = r2 
1 −(a/r)4
,
(25)
and expanding near u = 0 (r = a), one ﬁnds
ds2
EH ≃1
4du2 + 1
4u2(dψ + cos θ dφ)2 + a2
4 (dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2),
(26)
such that the local topology near r = a is that of R2 × S2, where the latter factor is associated
with the coordinates (θ, π). At ﬁxed values of these coordinates one has the pure R2 metric
ds2
EH

θ=φ=const. ≃1
4(du2 + u2dψ2),
(27)
whose singularity at u = 0 is removable provided one restricts the Euler angle ψ to lie in the range
0 ≤ψ ≤2π,
(28)
rather than the full range of eq. (22). Put another way, this has the eﬀect of identifying each
spacetime point xµ with −xµ, so that the boundary of the spacetime becomes the projective space
P3(R) = S3/Z2 rather than S3. Recalculation of the topological invariants mentioned above then
yields χ = 2, τ = 1. Removable singularities of this type were christened bolts in ref. [89], as dis-
tinct from (anti)-nut singularities (such as those in the Taub-NUT metric studied in a double copy
context in ref. [45]). The invariants χ and τ then have an interpretation in terms of a superposition
of the number of nuts and bolts [89]. The spacetime obtained by removing the bolt singularity
in the present case has zero action, is everywhere regular, and is also self-dual. It has thus been
widely studied as an example of a gravitational instanton.
Let us now turn, as promised, to the single copy of the Eguchi-Hanson solution, for which we ﬁrst
need to know the zeroth copy ﬁeld Φ. Following section 2, this is a harmonic function residing in
a biadjoint scalar ﬁeld theory, that one must act upon with the Kerr-Schild operator of eq. (13) in
order to produce a gauge ﬁeld and, subsequently, the Eguchi-Hanson graviton. Furthermore, this
function must be given in terms of the lightcone coordinates of eq. (12). The relevant function has
been given in ref. [76] as
Φ =
λX2

from which one obtains the gauge ﬁeld

(30)
and graviton
hµν = λ(vdu −XdY )2
(uv −XY )3 .
(31)
Here we have included a common parameter λ, so that vacuum solutions in each theory correspond
to λ →0. We do not include explicit factors of the coupling in the gauge or biadjoint theories,
choosing instead to absorb these in the arbitrary colour vectors that would dress the above solutions.
Let us ﬁrst check that eq. (31) indeed corresponds to the Eguchi-Hanson metric of eq. (23), which
may write more clearly by substituting eq. (24) into eq. (23):

EH = 1

(32)
This equivalence has been shown using twistor methods in ref. [90], but we can instead use a more
straightforward approach. Adding the background ﬂat line element (in lightcone coordinates) to
eq. (31), one obtains
ds2 = 2du dv −2dX dY + λ(vdu −XdY )2
(uv −XY )3 .
(33)
The lightcone coordinates may be transformed to (Euclidean) Cartesian coordinates according to
eq. (12), after which one may make the further transformation

(34)
where the angles have ranges as in eq. (22). Here r is the radial distance in R4, and from the two
sets of transformations in eqs. (12, 34) we can establish the relation
r2 = x2 + y2 + z2 + t2 = 2(uv −XY ).
(35)
Next, we can connect the parameter λ from eq. (31) with the parameter a appearing in the metric of
eq. (23), by considering the Kretschmann scalar in both the lightcone and polar coordinate systems:
RαβµνRαβµν = 384a8
r12

24λ2
(uv −XY )6 .
(36)
Equation (35) then immediately implies
λ = a4

(37)
8

such that transforming eq. (33) into the polar coordinate system of eq. (34) yields

Finally, one may perform the additional transformation

(39)
to put eq. (38) into the form of eq. (23). Note that this last transformation is singular, and creates
the explicit coordinate singularity at r = a (the “bolt”) appearing in eq. (23).
Armed with the above transformations, we can also transform the zeroth copy ﬁeld Φ and single
copy gauge ﬁeld Aµ of eqs. (29, 30) into the polar coordinate system, and we ﬁnd

As a cross-check, we have explicitly veriﬁed (in the ﬁnal coordinate system) that eq. (42) satisﬁes
the Maxwell equations
Dµ F µν = 0,
(43)
where Dµ is the covariant derivative in the curvilinear coordinate system obtained by transforming
the ﬂat space metric from the lightcone coordinate system via eqs. (12, 34, 39), as well as the
appropriate self-duality condition

where g is the determinant of the metric. One may also verify that
Fµν F µν = Fµν ˜F µν = 0,

where the second condition follows from the ﬁrst due to self-duality. The vanishing of the ﬁeld
strength contracted with itself implies that the gauge ﬁeld has zero action, as does the gravity
solution 9. The ﬁeld strength also has a singularity as r →a, mirroring the bolt singularity in the
gravity theory. However, unlike in the gravity case, where the bolt is a genuine singularity in the
9The reader might be concerned that F 2 = 0 implies that F = 0, but the complexiﬁcation of the ﬁeld strength
induced by the coordinate transformation of eq. (39) allows non-trivial ﬁeld strengths to have vanishing action.

transformation of eq. (39). Without this transformation, the gauge ﬁeld is linear in a (and thus
well-behaved). We stress again that it lives in ﬂat space.
A noteworthy feature of the single copy ﬁeld (in the polar coordinates) is the presence of an apparent
singularity as θ →0, which at ﬁrst glance looks like the so-called Dirac string singularity of a
magnetic monopole [91], associated with non-zero magnetic charge. However, we can completely
remove this singularity using a (globally deﬁned) gauge transformation

µ is the diﬀerence in the (transformed) gauge ﬁeld in the northern and southern hemi-
spheres, and the line integral is around the equator C. The second equality follows given that

µ = 0 on C.
We should not be surprised that the magnetic charge is zero. Taking ψ as a (periodic) time coor-
dinate, we see from eq. (42) that the electric ﬁeld points tangential to the S2 surface spanned by
(θ,φ). Thus, there is no electric ﬂux through a closed surface enclosing the single copy solution,
implying (via Gauss’ Law) that the electric charge is zero. Self-duality then dictates that the mag-
netic charge must also be zero. This is also consistent with the fact that ﬁeld-strength falls oﬀin
a dipole-like way ∼r−3 (for ﬁxed ψ) at large distances: a dipole has no net charge.
We have seen that the single copy gauge ﬁeld has vanishing action, and the natural question
arises of whether it can be given an instanton interpretation, analogous to that of its gravitational
counterpart. However, there can be no abelian-like instanton solutions, owing to the fact that one
requires a solution to be pure gauge at inﬁnity, such that there is a topologically nontrivial map
from the boundary of spacetime (S3) to the gauge group. There are no such maps 10 to the abelian
group U(1). Another way to see the absence of instanton solutions is to note that they can be
labelled by the second Chern number

eqs. (41, 42, 49).
The vanishing of the ﬁrst and second Chern numbers mean that there is no non-trivial topological
character to the single copy gauge ﬁeld, which can be related directly to the gravity solution. We
saw that the Eguchi-Hanson spacetime is topologically trivial before restricting the period of ψ as in
eq. (28). Here we have taken the single copy without imposing any restrictions on the background
(ﬂat) spacetime that the gauge theory lives in. Thus, the topological triviality of the single copy is
entirely consistent with the similar behaviour of the (unrestricted) gravity solution. We may then
ask whether it is possible to obtain topologically nontrivial behaviour by restricting the range of ψ
in the electromagnetic theory. However, the above arguments are unmodiﬁed by such a restriction:
ψ plays the role of a time coordinate, and the lack of magnetic charge at one time persists at later
times. Furthermore, the obstruction to obtaining a nontrivial second Chern number is unchanged,
in that the ﬁelds continue to fall oﬀsharply at the boundary of the spacetime. Thus, there seems
no way to obtain a gauge theory counterpart to the non-trivial topology of the gravity solution
after removing the bolt singularity in the latter. We stress again that this is not surprising: non-
trivial topology in the gravity theory arises upon removing the bolt singularity. The latter has no
meaning in the gauge theory i.e. the apparent singularity at r = a can be removed by a coordinate
transformation, which is not the same as a gauge transformation. There is therefore no non-trivial
topological character to the gauge ﬁeld.
In order to corroborate the above discussion, it is instructive to plot the electric ﬁeld (related to
the magnetic ﬁeld by self-duality) obtained from the single copy gauge ﬁeld. To this end, we use
Cartesian coordinates in Minkowski signature, obtained from the coordinates (t, x, y, z) in eq. (12)
by sending t →it. In ﬁgure 3, we show the electric ﬁeld in the plane z = 0, for two diﬀerent
times. At time t = 0, the ﬁeld indeed appears purely dipole-like. As time increases, a disturbance

propogates outwards at the speed of light, such that the ﬁeld is singular on the circular contour
x2 + y2 = 1. Outside this region, however, the dipole-like form remains. The ﬁeld in other planes
is more complicated. As an example, we show the ﬁeld in the (x, z) plane in ﬁgure 4. Again there
is a lightcone singularity at unit radius in the plane for t = 1, but now the centre of the dipole-like
behaviour is progressively shifted as time progresses. In all of the ﬁeld conﬁgurations shown, there
is clearly no net electric charge and thus, by self-duality, no magnetic charge.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have examined the double copy for exact classical solutions of gauge theory and
gravity that are Kerr-Schild, but also self-dual. For this special class, one may consider a harmonic
function in light-cone coordinates, and interpret the Kerr-Schild vector as a certain diﬀerential op-
erator ˆkµ, which acts on the harmonic function to produce gauge and graviton ﬁelds. The harmonic
function and gauge ﬁeld are then the zeroth and single copy of the graviton respectively.
As an example of this approach, we have constructed a single copy of the well-known Eguchi-
Hanson solution, which has been widely studied over the years as a gravitational instanton. The
Eguchi-Hanson instanton has non-trivial topological structure, after removal of the so-called bolt
singularity occuring in the metric. Before removal of this singularity however, the Euler character-
istic and Hirzebruch signature of the spacetime are both zero, implying trivial topology. Consistent
with this, we ﬁnd that the single copy gauge ﬁeld is also topologically trivial, as it must be given that
it is abelian-like, and thus cannot exhibit nonzero instanton number if the boundary of spacetime
is S3. The magnetic charge is also zero, matching the fact that the ﬁeld has dipole-like behaviour.
Our results are interesting in that one might have expected the single copy of the Eguchi-Hanson
13

metric to be a non-abelian instanton, such as the well-known BPST instanton of ref. [80]. Indeed,
it was the discovery of the latter solution that motivated the original study that led to the Eguchi-
Hanson metric [77]. We ﬁnd instead a single copy ﬁeld that is abelian-like, and has trivial topology,
and it is not the ﬁrst time that the single copy of a well-known gravity solution has turned out to
be simpler than expected. Before ref. [44], it was expected by many (including one of the present
authors) that the single copy of the Schwarzschild solution would be a non-abelian object e.g. a
monopole. However, the single copy turns out to be a simple Coulomb charge. This was later made
sense of by studying the Taub-NUT solution [45], which conﬁrmed that the single copy maps mass
and NUT charge in the gravity theory to electric and magnetic charge, respectively, in the gauge
theory. For Eguchi-Hanson, there is zero NUT charge and mass, and thus we indeed expect no
electric or magnetic charge in its single copy.
Our results will also be useful in guiding studies of nonperturbative aspects of the double copy.
Currently, all known examples of the copy involve objects cast in perturbation theory, or involving
positive powers of the coupling constant. It is not known whether the double copy is a truly non-
perturbative statement, expressing a much deeper relationship between gauge and gravity theories
than previously thought. Furthermore, it is not even clear how to systematically formulate such a
relationship. One way forward might be to catalogue known nonperturbative (or strong coupling)
solutions between diﬀerent theories, before matching them up. To this end, some strong coupling
solutions of biadjoint scalar theory have been recently derived in refs. [92,93].
Another way forward might be to use symmetries to characterise nonperturbative behaviour on
both sides of the double copy correspondence, and to match up solutions according to e.g. topo-
logical information. Here, we have found that the creation of topological charge in the gravity
theory does not necessarily have a unique counterpart in the gauge theory. The removal of the
bolt singularity in the Eguchi-Hanson metric can be seen as a boundary condition, which has no
immediate analogue in gauge theory.
There remains the possibility that there may yet be topologically nontrivial non-abelian solutions
that map to Eguchi-Hanson, in addition to the abelian-like gauge ﬁeld considered here. The fact
that both an abelian and non-abelian quantity may map to the same gravitational quantity is
possible given that colour structure is stripped oﬀupon performing the double copy, and indeed
such behaviour has been seen before in the study of infrared singularities [36]. One way to proceed
may be to embed the abelian-like ﬁeld seen here in a fully non-abelian setting using the well-known
t’Hooft ansatz [94].
In summary, the study of classical aspects of the double copy, including possible nonperturbative
aspects, is in its infancy, with many exciting avenues still to be explored. We hope that our present
study sheds some light on some of these possibilities.
