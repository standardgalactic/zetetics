X-ray Diﬀraction
X-ray diﬀraction (or X-ray crystallography) is the determination of
crystal structure by analysis of the diﬀraction pattern of X-rays caused
by a crystal in their path. In the technique, the intensity of the dif-
fraction at each orientation of a single crystal is measured, inter-
preted in terms of structure factors, and then used to construct
the electron density distribution in a unit cell by Fourier synthesis.
Absolute configurations can be determined by making use of the
Bijvoet method. Powder samples give characteristic patterns and can
be used to analyse the composition of samples and to determine the
symmetry and dimensions of unit cells.
