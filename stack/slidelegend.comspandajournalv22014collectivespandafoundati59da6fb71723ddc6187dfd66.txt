are from
The Tibetan Book of Proportions,
an eighteenth-century pattern book consisting
of 34 ink drawings showing precise iconometric
guidelines for depicting the Buddha and
Bodhisattva ﬁgures. Written in Newari script
with Tibetan numerals, the book was apparently
produced in Nepal for use in Tibet. The concept
of the ‘ideal image’ of the Buddha emerged during
the Golden Age of Gupta rule, from the 4th to
6th century. As well as the proportions, other
aspects of the depiction – such as number of
teeth, colour of eyes, direction of hairs –
became very important.

Adagio cantabile ~ Impetuoso e con brio.
the placebo effect oN huMaN collEcTivE folly
is indeed insane.
I couldn’t wait any longer to anchor my broken feelings to
a longing beyond despair. Unity was not achievable in
that split human dimension, union is only possible in the
timeless realm clear of you and me.
you-Me is no longer a whole when dashed apart by the
domain of time. When implies a hierarchy of argumen-
tation on the linear progression of time; it determines
a chasm, an opening up of a fresh narration. indeed
time is a reﬁned device of the thinking mind to keep
records of its own becoming, a mental construct. it is
not time to master us, but is we who got to master
time. e timespace continuum foreshadows the
spiritual-material dimension by emerging right in
between the pair complementing each other, as
that hyphen (-) uniting and relating their mean-
ings on the cognitive plane. Sacred times are giv-
ing way to self-reﬂections in maya’s mirror: a
master illusion looking into its own becoming
with an avid gaze (tehôrein) mirrored further and
farther in time and space, and in their absence.
When time fades into space and space into time,
and matter and spirit are crossfading, a comple-
mentary wind (rūh-illoﬁ) shuﬄes all impossible
presents into this one, shifting into its new
ontological dimension: the mesoteric realm, de
quo alias, right in between the complementary.
we are gracing with presence what is not here,
eye witnessing the hidden to the one-sighted, for
only the inner eye confers a visual connotation to
the mesoteric realm, the ﬁrst of all the invisibles
ones. indeed the hyphen [-] uniting the spiritual-
material locution should be turned into a [+] sign
to signify the command (‘amr, kūn) to re-absorb
both polarities. what really matter are not the dis-
tinct identities of the polarities, rather the quality
of the hyphenic relation allowing their crossﬂow-
ing, the real aﬀair is indeed their mutual exchange.
individual entities are certainly important, but even
more so are the relations uniting them in that
subtle vibrational ﬁeld of the Self, ahead of the
dichotomy of the principle of identity splitting
the self from the other. friendship and love do
not vanish when friends and lovers are no longer
at sight; we still love them and sense their friend-
ship even once they are departed. e relation-
ships between individuals are actually what really
count most: for, at the end of the day individuals
will perish, while the quality of their relations
will stay. Everything will perish, but its face1, the
visible presence of each and of all. here the con-
ceptual matter takes another turn: lahir and batin
are coupling in the very middle of the mesoteric
spleen, banqueting at the very centre of the real
human dimension, dining at the table of life; while
Kronos & Sophia are resting on the sofa, loosely
engaged in co-creating Natura2. Sophia sophia or
Sophia perennis? Sophia sophia or Sophia naturata? 
again an epistemological break, an ontological shift,
and
As I got your message
e Sun shattered all clouds to ﬁre up the ﬂight,
I knew the bond is strong and does not fail,
I much look forward liaising with you.
Yet, who are you?
Why on my way?
Which way is this to keep apart the yearning for reuniﬁcation?
A muse, a soul, a power?
Or a strength in disguise?
releasing individual contradictions is the sole means to
solve dispute; transforming inner conﬂicts does impact
the contentious human madness of war, is the ﬁrst step
towards a sustainable pace. collective intelligence (ci)
has certainly an apotropaic function on this collective
folly as it is made up of a number of simple ‘individuals’
entities sharing their content to one another in a certain
and deﬁnite fashion. ci does not hold ‘ideas’, it is ‘an’
idea, an idea composed of ideas. its action is free, not
in that is undetermined, rather because it is self-deter-
mined, as yeast catalysing fermentation.
from the mesoteric standpoint, ci is the energetic net-
work uniting individual entities, not conﬁned to their
subsistence, allowing the ﬂow of a highly creative ener-
gy through them and throughout the whole network.
here too, what really matter are not the individual

entities, which will fade away, but the energetic inter-
relations binding them together, that invisible network
emerging from and informing their connectedness by
consciously participating in it.
from the subatomic layer to the biosphere tier, collec-
tive intelligence is made up of one and the same energy,
diﬀering in gradation, yet of the same order, evolving
and enhancing its vibrational awareness from a grosser,
as in simple organism, to a subtler frequency, as in high
and complex entities, increasing at every new stage its
dimensional awareness. in the subatomic, vegetal and
animal realms, it takes the signature of a rudimentary
energetic relational network connecting all units, parti-
cles, and individuals, overruling their single behaviour to
determine their collective performance, their proceeding
and trend as a group and a species. an equivalent plastic
analogy of this process can be noticed, for instance, in
ﬂocking starlings, shoaling of ﬁsh, swarming of insects,
herd of land animals that propagate their kinetic wave as
a single organism. a higher and diﬀerentiated gradation
of this process is observed in the eusocial behaviour of
colonies of honeybees holding an endogen teleological
awareness aimed at the well being of the whole com-
munity; and, to a higher order, in the transmutation3
of the human consciousness from the individual to
the collective level. [it is certainly hard to discern the
individual awareness of a single constituent of a
whole from the integral whole. is the right hand
aware of being an element of the human body? is it
aware of the behaviour of the left hand? Both
polarities are governed by the holistic intelligence
of the whole, part and particle of the biosphere
collective brain. further, is the biosphere aware of
being sentient? at the present, collective intelli-
gence is becoming aware of being a sovra-organ-
ism, a network connecting individuals and deter-
mining, to a certain degree, the global human
behaviour. within this perspective, globalisation
is merely a marginal outcome of human con-
sciousness shifting to its next state – ‘next’ in the
temporal measure of course – transmuting into
its glocal, spiritual-material dimension right in
between the two polarities, constantly ﬂip-ﬂop-
ping between the two, unable to settle into nei-
ther of them within the lifespan duration.
But which is the import of ci on this Buridan’ass?
Placed at the same distance from two equally
attractive bundles of reality, human nature is
called to make the uncaused decision to bent to
one side only, unless to act in an unpredictable
manner. in its destructive creation, devoid of any
ideological bearing and of any cognitive limitation,
the will, the conatus, the élan, the entelechy
ingrained in the nature of its manifested ends, makes
the ass to starve to death, or to cast the improbable
decision to live. is constant strain between the two
conditions while keeping the helm well ﬁrm in the
middle, is actually what makes the inertial motion
of the meso state. To be able to manage both sides
at once is a characteristic of the crisis of our time,
for the human ontological placement is surely in
between the two, abreast of its paradoxical stand-
ing keeping together the two complementing ten-
dencies in a state of tensed simultaneity, separated
and united at once, where the Self is both itself
and the other, not in conﬂict, yet in reciprocity.
Being awake to both the process and the state,
aware of being a sentient being devoid of time,
immersed in the enduring perception of dharma,
it prompts a state of grace and despair, of long-
ing and self-contraction, of inhaling and exhaling
while giving shape to the universe. here presence
(shc’himah), collective intelligence enlightenment,
combined wisdom, reconciliation of comple-
mentary within the human experience are shap-
ing up the collective consciousness and the world
at once. without renouncing the world, transcen-
dence and immanence converge in a single act of
collective serendipedity, leaving no debris behind,
no more vikarma to be mended. Maya is lastly
ripped of its veil, these actions have farr (xᵛarənah),
endowed as they are with majesty and glory4. Deﬁ-
nitely this is nor the ascetic path, neither the fourth
way5,but rather the ﬁfth stage of human develop-
ment, wherein individual and collective intelligence
become one, and clean actions are performed devoid
of self-interest for the common well-being. Mindful-
ness was once named active contemplation; at this
time, actions are the golden letters of the new discourse
in which the human networking are as the synapses of a
global collaborative, connective and collective intelli-
gence system. at this juncture, logoi spermatikoi are seeds
words to crack the soul’s code: the mesoteric intelligence
is fuelling the collective intelligence, catalyzing the whole
network. in this new phase of pulling and sharing knowl-
edge nobody holds the copyright on the primal energy,
open source access is granted to the entire intelligible
spectrum. e time of secrets, of concealments is over; this
is the time of revelation, of disclosures, of the unveiling of
life and death, the time of notime, of the collective time-
less experience of the self and the other at once, the time
of yesterday and tomorrow, and the time of today.

Our élan does not rest at death.
Beware:

if you don’t get any email, it’s me…
if your heart doesn’t stop, it’s me.

Live-streaming my voice beyond the ocean,

And to be me.
wordsmithery and literary daring are grounded is ethical
values unconcerned of any aesthetical plight. e higher
the ethical drive the brighter is beauty – at times, even
the clearest of mind wishes to be blurred. Detachment is
not to own anything, rather than nothing own us. Time,
duration and eternity have always obsessed the human
community writing history on a devastated planet at the
periphery of this minute galaxy. e thinking mind
frames perception, it advocates a conceptual scaﬀolding
on which to stand, even knowing that holding to a
scaﬀold is seldom a great solution. Dissatisfaction and
curiositas are the ﬁrst symptom of any innovative
process. Eternal is what cannot be explained by dura-
tion, yet duration is an extension of time. e blinking
perception of the time and timeless dimension does
not take apart an event form another, for, in reality,
events are really synchronic, they happen at once
but are perceived asynchronously within the time
constrain because of the dual modality of the
thinking mind – a shortcoming very helpful in the
historical narration otherwise undoable in the
timeless dimension.
is amount to say that to conceive and perceive
things sub species aeternitas is not possible by the
thinking mind, but is the work of the intuitive
knowledge/creative imagination of the mundus
imaginalis6. Being partially subject to time, plain
imagination does not need any relational link
between entities; creative imagination as well
does not claim any relation between entities but,
in contrast to plain imagination, it correlates and
establishes pivotal liaisons on the collective plane
catalysed by the collective intelligence co-creating
and empowering conscious creative acts. here, ci
seems to partake of a supra conscious state, diﬀer-
ing from both the collective unconscious holder
of archetypes, and from any other outer dimen-
sion of human consciousness, but belonging to
that inner condition connecting by its axis mundi
all intelligences and states through their centres. at
this point, dharma presides over ci that, at turn,
governs all the issuing physical laws of this dramatic
squandered dimension.
I hope you are doing ﬁne and that life is really suiting
you as an old glove,
Comfortable in your skin.
I lost my teeth in biting reality until its very end,
and now?
Where are you? 
Life is unfolding as a vintage sole,
So, tell me, where are you?
ere is no way ahead but in the burrows of his-
torical time. is does not mean that there is no
way-out of the karmic condition, but rather that
a way is attainable once the twofold perception
is embraced by unity, with the self leading the
path, when Krishna and arjuna are but one and
the same as the chariot. 
e distinctiveness of our time[s] is the awaken-
ing of consciousness at collective level, a clear sign
that the collective intelligence is at work training
and transmuting humankind to its next ontological
plane. a state of undiﬀerentiated unity attained
individually since antiquity by all seekers when
their consciousness transcended polarity, but nowa-
days changing its modality of manifestation by tak-
ing shape as a collective experiential action, moving
from an individual to a collective state of conscious-
ness. in point of facts, the drive attracting humanity
beyond duality is seemingly pointing to an even fur-
ther state of consciousness in which also this ultimate
rite of passage to a collective and conscious intelli-
gence is becoming obsolete.
in the last analysis, humans are nothing but spiritual
beings embodied in the space-time continuum, tem-
porarily abiding to their developmental stage, headed to
brieﬂy shaping the emerging polarities unto their next
stage, co-creating and expanding the manifestation.
Sophia precedes Knowledge while yggdrasil is reversed:
wisdom and knowledge enthroned in the pinnacle,
undercovered as a garment of light. e endless orgasm of
uniﬁcation does not expire, it inspires new life within a
life, vivifying and bending the course of time to a track yet
to be deﬁned – it’s hard to ride the tiger on a razor
blade in a divided state, ﬂip-ﬂopping as an old slipper,
time and again raising a dusty spell in the eyes, gripping
to a grimy vision in search of light. we the people are
leaping to another order of things, transmuting onto a
further ontological plane, giving new meaning to old
worlds, new life to things yet to happen. attuned to
buddhity, but still dealing with old categories of
thought that in the course of time have utterly changed
their meaning7,  humans are revivifying all subtle
channels to enliven the sparkling splendour of their
crystal body8.

is fantastic pseudology, this tale that never happened,
that might well be an unserviceable witness in courts of
law but a very truthful beholder of a culture no longer
marginalizing the invisible; this very personal account of
a journey throughout an untoward life is by no means
perfect, as necessarily rests on the cognitive limitations
of the writer and, as such, is marred by unavoidable
errors. however, as there is general agreement among
scholars that, in the interest of clarity, any operative
annotations could be propounded in the light of later
scholarship, this account is not to suggest that col-
lective intelligence cannot be explained, rather, all
claimed here is that there are further and farther
possibilities of advancement into the experiential
quest, and of its contextual transcription. whatev-
er the fundamental nature of the collective intelli-
gence may be, this is just a an attempt to explain
its modus operandi, a postulate: acceptable, in that
it combines the cause with its consequences;
motivating, in that it shows that
I spent my whole life among words and deeds 
conveying their subtle vibrational meaning,
yet, still I’m here, spinning as a fool on my toe:
I’m not me, I’m you.
Inspiration ﬂows naturally, but at time does it not,
so it calls to be shaped at its best outcome,
with hard work and discipline, resilience and
sparkling joy.
I’m not me, I’m you.

analogy and metaphor, in horizontal translation within the same

ness of a quantum universum, to the mesoteric, spiritual-material
dimension distinct from the purely physical realm absorbed into
itself. on the phenomenical edge of the meaning, the hyphen unit-
ing and allowing the cross-ﬂow of energies between the two realms,

lar, the column, yang, the lingam of the dyad; while the terms unit-
ed by the hyphen, its terminals, symbolize the cosmic yoni. on the
metaphysical edge, it signiﬁes the union of all chakras by the
ascending of kundalini, regarded by many as the ‘real’ union. in
points of fact, neither the phenomenical nor the metaphysical edge
can be manifested if not synchronically, sharing the emptiness left
by the absence of the other, but distinct from the illusion of Maya
– beyond states and stages, ahead of all quadrants, there lays the
mesoteric integrity.
an endless maithuna protracted beyond time, devoid of the tem-
poral edge where time takes on its rhythmic bits, giving shape
and fulﬁlling its own vibrational dimension. No doubt is here
the conditio of time and no-time being postulated. as a matter
of fact, it is not only the absence of time, or its missing dimen-
sion, to identify the quality of an action, its sign and cipher,
but also that span in which time is solid-still, at rest at the
centre of the whole being, yet perceived by consciousness as
ﬂowing. Keeping the pivot at the centre and, as in a sacred
ritual, spinning around its own centre: a selﬁsh, egotic, self-
inﬂated time.

today’s world surprising evidence coming
to light about the nature of consciousness.
ere are more and more reports of con-
scious experience beyond the range of the senses,
and even beyond the body. ey come from
many sources. ey come from people who
arrived at the portals of death and returned, from
spiritual masters and shamans and psychic medi-
ums, and from ordinary people who entered a
meditative, prayerful, deeply loving or otherwise
non-ordinary state of consciousness. it appears
that our individual consciousness does not come
to an end when the life of our body does. is
raises a number of critical issues regarding the
true nature of our consciousness. 
in the modern world received wisdom is that con-
sciousness is a product of the brain. e evidence
surfacing currently contests this assumption. it
shows that in many instances consciousness exists
without the brain – at least, without a living and
functioning brain. e most striking cases of this
kind are NDEs: near-death experience. But there are
other documented cases where conscious experience
is not linked with a living brain. ese include
communication with “something” that appears to
be a living consciousness but is not the conscious-
ness of a living person2.
an unbiased review of the rapidly accumulat-
ing evidence suggests that consciousness is not
produced by the brain but only transmitted by
it. is, evidently, is not a new idea. it was
revived by william James in his 1899 Ingersoll
Lecture on Immortality3.
James spoke of a “veiled” domain of the world
from which information is transmitted by the
brain. is is the “transmission theory” of con-
sciousness, and it is an alternative to the “pro-
duction theory.” it can account for many of the
seemingly esoteric phenomena that the produc-
tion theory cannot. Because if consciousness is
not produced but only transmitted by the brain, it
can exist also in the absence of the brain.

in the modern world the prevalent belief is that the
stream of sensations that makes up our consciousness
is generated by the brain. is is much like a stream of
electrons being generated by a turbine. as long as the
turbine functions, it generates a stream of electrons:
electricity. as long as the brain functions, it generates a
stream of sensations: consciousness. when it shuts
down, consciousness vanishes. consciousness no more
exists in a dead brain than electric charge exists in a
stopped turbine. erefore, the standard argument
goes, it is evident that just as the turbine generates elec-
tricity, the brain generates consciousness. 
e turbine is an apt metaphor because it refers to a
tangible object that produces something intangible.
we do not see, hear or taste electricity; we know it
only by the eﬀects it produces. is is much the same
with consciousness. we experience the stream of sen-
sations, feelings, volitions and intuitions we call con-
sciousness, but we do not observe anything we could
call consciousness. e observation of the brain and
its workings does not disclose consciousness; all it
discloses are networks of neurons embedded in grey
matter ﬁring in complex sequences.

THE ONE MIND IN THE COSMOS
AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS1

we know that functions in the brain and nervous
system coordinate the myriad reactions that main-
tain the organism in the living state. Mainstream
science is categorical that brain functions also gener-
ate the consciousness experience. e proof of this is
the observation that when brain function is impaired,
the stream of sensations is distorted, and when the
brain stops functioning, the stream vanishes. us
consciousness must be a product of brain function. 
Philosophers have pointed out that this assumption
comes up against the so-called “hard problem” in con-
sciousness research. David chalmers formulated it as
the question how “something as immaterial as con-
sciousness” could arise from “something as unconscious
as matter4.” how the brain operates is a comparatively
“soft” problem that neurophysiologists can be expected
to solve step by step. But the question, how an “imma-
terial consciousness” can arise out of “unconscious mat-
ter” cannot be answered by brain-research, for brain
research deals only with “matter,” and matter is not
conscious. Philosopher Jerry fodor pointed out that
“nobody has the slightest idea how anything material
could be conscious. Nobody even knows what it
would be like to have the slightest idea about how
anything could be conscious5.”
Scientists seldom speculate on the hard problem of
consciousness research, but when queried about the
nature of consciousness many of them express per-
plexity. Science, the journal of the american asso-
ciation for the advancement of Science, published
a special issue in 2005 celebrating its 125th anniver-
sary. it featured 125 questions that scientists have
so far failed to solve6. e most important unan-
swered question turned out to be What is the
universe made of?, followed by What is the biolog-
ical basis of consciousness?
in the public eye the turbine theory is the
answer regarding the basis of consciousness.
however, the hypothesis that consciousness is
generated by the brain is not only an unsolved
problem for philosophers and an object of per-
plexity for scientists: it is also contradicted by
observation. 
e consciousness-generating brain theory, the
same as other theories in science, can be main-
tained as long as the predictions ﬂowing out of
it are corroborated by observations. e critical
prediction for the theory is that when the brain
stops functioning, consciousness vanishes, just
as when a turbine stops, the electric current
generated by it disappears. 
at ﬁrst sight this prediction seems conﬁrmed by
observation. when cerebral functions cease, con-
sciousness ceases as well. is is not observed in
the ﬁrst person, but it is a reasonable inference
from the observation of people who are brain-
dead. ey do not behave as if they had a working
consciousness. 
e prediction that consciousness ceases in the
absence of cerebral function does not admit of
exceptions. we could no more account for the
presence of consciousness in a dead brain than
we could account for the presence of electric
charge in a stationary turbine. if observations to
the contrary would surface, they would place in
question the dominant concept of conscious-
ness. But observations to the contrary did sur-
face. in some cases consciousness does not
cease when the brain stops working. is is a
direct counter-indication and conceivably a
fatal ﬂaw of the turbine theory. 
e ﬁrst and most obvious kind of evidence for
this surprising ﬁnding is furnished by the NDE.
it turned out that in a signiﬁcant number of
documented cases – experts speak of six million –
conscious experience persists during the time
the brain is “ﬂatlined.” Even one experience of
this kind would be a major problem for the tur-
bine theory. a product of brain activity cannot
persist in the absence of that activity. ere is no
known physiological mechanism that could account
for conscious experience in a ﬂat brain. yet the
NDE is totally convincing for those who had them:
they have no doubt they are real experiences. Subse-
quent analysis could sometimes conﬁrm the veridical
nature of these experiences. it turned out that in
many instances the experience of brain-dead people
match the experience they would have had if their
brain had functioned normally.
e NDE is not the only challenge for the brain-gener-
ated consciousness theory. ere are other indications
that consciousness can exist independently of the brain.
Some reports claim that conscious experience persists
not only during the temporary cessation of brain activity,
but also in its permanent absence: when the subject is
fully and irreversibly dead. 
Many psychic mediums say that they channel messages
from deceased persons. ey report receiving information
through clairvoyance (seeing apparitions), clairaudience
(hearing voices), or clairsentience (physical sensations).
e veracity of these perceptions has encountered many
objections, among them that the mediums themselves
invent them, or that they pick them up from living per-
sons through some form of ESP. ere are cases, however,
in which these possibilities can be eﬀectively ruled out:
the messages conveyed by the mediums contain infor-
mation that neither the mediums themselves, nor any
living person with whom they could have been in
touch, is likely to have possessed7.

Moreover it appears that contact can be had with
“something” that acts as if it was a living conscious-
ness. is is a widespread phenomenon. it surfaces
not only in the experience of trance mediums but
also in the experience of mystics and otherwise quite
normal people when they enter an altered state of
consciousness. communication can take place with
an entity that has a sense of self, carries memories of
its physical existence, and manifests a keen desire to be
understood and given credence. if this phenomenon is
real, it places in question even more seriously than the
NDE that consciousness is generated by the living brain.

consciousness, it appears, is not – certainly not always –
generated by the brain but is only transmitted by it.
en the question is, transmitted from where – and
how? an answer is now surfacing. it is a hypothetical
answer, but the most plausible that is currently avail-
able. it is the theory that our individual conscious-
ness is the projection of a cosmic hologram. 
from the standpoint of the individual, conscious-
ness is an information ﬁeld: this write called it the
akashic ﬁeld. is is a holographically coded ﬁeld
accessible to the brain and nervous system. it is
holographic because it contains information in a
distributed form – as in a hologram, all the infor-
mation is present at all points. e ﬁeld contains
the codes projected to the brain and body of an
individual and are perceived as the sensations
that make up his or her consciousness. all these
sensations are “entangled,” being particular pro-
jections of the same cosmic hologram.
e concept on which this theory is based is
widely discussed in contemporary physics. it is
the concept of the “holographic universe.” e
theory is that the 3D things and events we
observe in the world are holographic projections
of 2D codes. e codes are at the periphery of
space and time, and possibly in another universe. 
e idea of the holographic universe has been
raised by David Bohm in the late 20th century,
and empirical support for it surfaced in 2013.
fermilab physicist craig hogan proposed that
the ﬂuctuations observed by the gravity-wave
detector gEo600 may be due to the graininess of
space (according to string theory at the supers-
mall scale space is not smooth but patterned by
minuscule ripples: it is ”grainy”). it turned out
that the inhomogeneities found by gEo600 are not
gravity-waves. ey could, however, be ripples in
the ﬁne-structure of space. is would be the case if
they are 3D projections of 2D information coded
beyond spacetime. if the grains found by gEo600
are of the indicated size, hogan’s hypothesis gains
experimental support. Subsequent measurements
conﬁrmed that this is precisely the case8.
e hologram theory applies to all events and
entities in space and time, including the con-
sciousness that appears in association with the enti-
ties. if so, our human consciousness is the localized
(but nonlocal) projection of the holoﬁeld. is
accounts for the ﬁnding that one can enter into
communication with “something” that appears
to be the consciousness of an individual regard-
less of whether that individual is living or not,
and where he or she may be located in space.
e cosmic hologram conserves all elements of
consciousness in space and time and these ele-
ments of consciousness can be recalled by brains
and nervous systems speciﬁcally tuned to them.
all consciousness is nonlocal, as all consciousness
is a localized projection of the same holoﬁeld.
when one consciousness communicates with
another, one projection of the holoﬁeld commu-
nicates with another. Being internal communica-
tion within the holoﬁeld, this communication is
not subject to the physical limits of communication
in space and time. it can be instantaneous over any
ﬁnite distance and across any ﬁnite period of time. 
e theory that the consciousness that appears for
us is the projection of a cosmic holoﬁeld tells us that
Erwin Schrödinger was right. we cannot speak of
consciousness in the plural: the overall number of
minds in the universe is one. carl Jung came to a sim-
ilar conclusion. e psyche is not located within the
cranium, he said, it is part of the single generative prin-
ciple of the cosmos, the unus mundus. More recently
physician larry Dossey summed up his decades-long
experience of healing body and mind with the aﬃrma-
tion that there is but one mind in the world. all indi-
vidual minds are part of the one Mind, an inﬁnite ﬁeld
of consciousness9.
a timeless intuition is now surfacing at the cutting
edge of consciousness research and is meeting the cut-
ting edge of physics. our body may be separate, but
our mind is not. we are more mind than body, and
our mind we are one. us we are one. if we would
realize and take it to heart, we could overcome the
critical challenges of our time.

7 one of the most striking cases of this kind is the game of chess
played by a living chess grandmaster with a deceased chess grandmaster.
e moves by the latter have been channeled by the medium (who
did not play chess himself), and all the moves have been recorded

work of yoshifumi hyakutake and colleagues at ibaraki university in

based on the predictions of string theory and the eﬀects of virtual
particles. hyakutake together with Masanori hanada, goro ishiki
and Jun Nishimura then calculated the internal energy of the corre-
sponding lower-dimensional cosmos with no gravity. ey found
that the two calculations match. e internal energy of a black
hole and the internal energy of the corresponding lower-dimen-
sional cosmos are the same. Black holes, as well as the cosmos as
a whole, are holographic <http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5607>.

evolution, “survival of the ﬁttest”. a more
precise articulation might be “those entities
survive that maintain a workable ‘ﬁt’ with
their environment despite its changes and
challenges.” is is where intelligence comes in.
a dynamic living system or organism needs to
remain in tune with its changing environment so
that its actions continue to be successful. it does
this both by shaping its environment to satisfy its
needs and by adapting itself to changing condi-
tions. Both strategies depend on awareness of
environmental realities and awareness of the rele-
vance of those realities to the success and survival
of the system or organism.
e primary function of intelligence – in fact, its
evolutionary advantage – is to sustain this “ﬁt”. a
living organism – or any system made up of liv-
ing organisms – carries out ongoing adjustments
between its internal and external environments
and the palette of responses it has developed to
diﬀerent aspects of those environments. To do
this, it may use genetic, cognitive, or mimetic
modes. Every organism has a palette of responses
governed by their genetic makeup, manifesting in
such automatic responses as instincts and urges.
responsiveness can become more complex with
the development of cognitive learning systems and
cultural mimetic development and knowledge-
transfer. But it is clear that an entire species “learns”
new responsive patterns over eons through the trial
and error of “natural selection” which alters the
array of automatic responses it has available and how
and when those responses are to be applied.
as intelligence evolved, some intelligent organ-
isms’ patterns of responses became more cogni-
tive in the form of internal ideas, understand-
ings, pictures, models, maps, and stories. ese
structures of consciousness contained increasingly
sophisticated guidance for shaping behaviour in
ways that satisﬁed both internal needs and the
needs of the situations the organisms found
themselves in. further developments increased
organisms’ ability to creatively alter their inner
ideas and stories – not just to meet current
demands, but to imagine future situations and
try out various scenarios which – when acted
upon and the results noted – taught lessons about
handling circumstances never before encountered.
choice increasingly entered the picture, both
through moment-to-moment choices and through
the ability to create and discard habits of thought,
feeling, and action.
with the evolution of communication and culture,
certain animals – most notably us humans – became
increasingly able to pass on understandings to others
around them and then to preserve them not just
through individual memory but also through external
records and through educationally embedding them in
younger and future generations. e advent of science
and mathematics further upgraded human societies’
capacity to make our collective understandings more
congruent with reality. e scientiﬁc method continual-
ly alters our maps to increasingly ﬁt the territories they
purport to describe and so more safely and productive-
ly guide our movements through those aspects of life.
advancing sensor technologies – from microscopes and
telescopes to radios and pollution detectors – enhance
and extend our human sensory capacities. Evolving com-
putational technologies open doors to calculations,
reﬂections and renderings never before possible – inte-
grating information at ever higher levels of complexity,
precision, and abstraction. Developing communications
technologies enhance our ability to share ideas, collabo-
rate on collective learning adventures, and spread and
access knowledge around the globe, manifesting in the
extreme connectivity of the internet and the web.
what we see here is evolution of intelligence leaping
from natural selection to the individual mind and
thence into culture – the collective activities and

tional divisions of intelligence reﬂected in social
technologies and institutions. in addition to com-

as noted earlier, since intelligence helps us align with
reality, it has the power to tell us how to adapt by
changing ourselves and our behaviours to ﬁt the
demands of our environment and how to control con-
ditions by changing our environment to suit our
needs and desires. understanding this distinction
reveals a potential danger with collective intelligence.
Since scientiﬁc and technological enterprises are
particularly potent forms of collective intelli-
gence, i want to use them to clarify this “bug”
by comparing western conceptions of science
with what has been called “indigenous science”.
e explicit intention of western science is to
understand universal principles governing direct
causal relationships so that people can step into
that causal position and control and shape reality
– a process often empowered by technology and
magniﬁed by mass economic behaviours and
lifestyles. indigenous science, in contrast, seeks to
understand what is involved in a healthy, bal-
anced relationship with the life of a place and
with the larger universal context and forces gov-
erning all of life as manifested in such a place.
“unlike western science, the data from indige-
nous science are not used to control the forces of
nature; instead, [they] tell us the ways and the
means of accommodating nature”1.
ese two divergent uses of collective intelligence –
to control or accommodate nature – have obvious
implications for sustainability. Eﬀorts to adapt,
accommodate, and develop partnerships with nature
and its living organisms, systems, and forces tend to
generate fewer technologies, economies, and
lifestyles that require undue energy inputs and that
undermine the workings of the natural systems
upon which continued human life depends.
in contrast, eﬀorts to predict and control nature
tend to generate dependence on abnormal energy
and material inputs to sustain continued domi-
nance and the extension of that dominance into
ever-new domains of life. is input-intensive
creative process – otherwise known as “progress”
– does not usually have “balanced relationship”
as its core motivation. rather, it tends to sup-
port narrow (linear, corporate, self-interested,
immediate gratiﬁcation) perspectives that disre-
gard waste, pollution, and side eﬀects in the
“eﬃcient” pursuit of narrow objectives like pro-
duction, consumption, proﬁt, and power. as
mathematics and technologies magnify our
power to dominate, our impacts on the world
grow disproportionately – not just at the human
scale but also at vast and microcosmic scales
beyond the reach of normal organic perception.
Mass behaviours driven by economics, mobility,
and communication spread that inﬂuence over
wider territory, increasing our impact even further.
it is therefore not surprising that this potent and
ubiquitous western science-driven dynamic disrupts
natural – and even human – systems, creating prob-
lems and crises.  But our scientiﬁc worldview has an
answer: those problems and crises become objects of
study and technologically-empowered manipulation
which seeks to predict and control the emerging unde-
sirable situations, which then generate their own ripples,
waves and tsunamis of “side eﬀects”. we see the crescen-
do of this approach embodied in the perfect storm of
converging mega-crises we face in the current century –
the mutually intensifying emergence of climate disrup-
tion, peak resources (especially fossil fuels but also
increasingly water, to say nothing of the rare metals vital
to modern technology), ﬁnancial instability and inequity,
ubiquitous mobility (not only of people, but of capital,
materials, pollution, organisms, pests, diseases, weapons,
and everything else), the capacity of technologically
empowered individuals and small groups to create mas-
sive destruction on purpose or by accident2, the vulnera-
bility of global economics and monocultures… the list
grows longer day by day, year by year.
Signiﬁcantly, over the last century parts of western sci-
ence have been evolving towards indigenous science,
as embodied in ﬁelds that study and emphasize inter-
connectedness and balanced healthy relationships
more than linear predict–and–control dynamics.
Examples of such ﬁelds include ecology, quantum

mechanics, complex adaptive systems sciences, com-
plexity and chaos theories, climate science, and cer-
tain trends in biology, genetics, and evolutionary the-
ory. we also see eﬀorts to merge the two approaches
in integral ﬁelds like permaculture3 and complemen-
tary/integrative medicine4, as well as in technologies
and social sciences concerned with sustainability. ese
eﬀorts point the way for more balance between control
and adaptation, between universality and one’s own
place, between certainty and mystery, between ourselves
and our desires and the demands and health of the larger
systems of which we are a part.
So we ﬁnd collective intelligence is not an intrinsically
desirable and benign capacity, any more than individual
intelligence is. Some of the most destructive people in the
world have been extremely intelligent, and some of the
most creative and life–serving people have not made their
contributions primarily through intellectual brilliance. as
indigenous science suggests, there are some modes of
intelligence that are more intrinsically benign than other
modes. we face important questions about how much
of reality we are able and willing to embrace with our
intelligence – whether individual or collective – and for
whose beneﬁt, and at what expense, and with what
humility and consciousness. and perhaps most impor-
tantly at this stage, we face the question of how much
of our intelligence – individual and collective – we
choose to apply to monitoring the quality and appli-
cation of our intelligence, itself, so that we can shape
it and transform it as necessary so that our
life–estranged brilliance doesn’t destroy us.

is brings us to the ﬁelds of politics and gover-
nance, where the rules that shape our individ-
ual, collective, and institutional behaviours are
made, as well as the decisions about how we
spend or invest the most massive resources
available in most societies.  unfortunately, we
also ﬁnd collective intelligence inhibited, dis-
torted, or narrowly applied in these realms.
collective intelligence is, of course, operating
in and around politics and governance. e
collective intelligence of partisan and special
interest lobbyists and advocacy groups operates
at a high pitch to inﬂuence elections, policy-
making, and budgetary decisions. But the col-
lective intelligence of the society as a whole – its
capacity to collectively understand the realities it
faces, to collectively reﬂect on what it collectively
sees, to collectively inﬂuence or adapt to those
realities in an appropriate manner, and to collec-
tively observe the results of its collective responses
and initiatives – is exceptionally weak. at weak-
ness is largely due to the eﬀorts of those special
interests. eir narrow collective intelligence
undermines and distorts the whole society’s col-
lective intelligence, inhibiting its collective
eﬀorts to learn and know and act wisely on its
own collective behalf.
we face this challenge in our eﬀorts to enhance
collective intelligence. ose of us in the ﬁeld
should, i believe, take seriously the ethical
dimensions of our work, just as people in corpo-
rate and military sectors need to reﬂect on the
ethical dimensions of their work. who does our
work empower, and for what, and with what
results? as our shared mega-crises unfold, these
issues about our roles in them press upon our
attention. i would suggest that vastly more atten-
tion should be paid to understanding, promot-
ing, and catalyzing collectively intelligent and
wise democracies than virtually any other applica-
tion of our knowledge about this subject.
My own contribution involves a shift from seeing
citizens primarily as isolated voters to seeing them
collectively as a) an engaged source of diverse per-
spectives which – interacting creatively – can con-
tribute to greater collective understanding, b) as col-
laborative creative imaginations capable of identify-
ing options that are at once remarkable and wise, and
c) as active agents in applying the collective under-
standings in a) and the co-created initiatives in b) in
ways that continually feed into not only our collective
survival and thrival but our ongoing collective learning.
My contribution also involves an expansion of the idea
of representation to include not just elected politicians
but bodies of randomly selected citizens who are empow-
ered to shape public policies and budgets in partnership –
and in a balance of power – with other branches of gov-
ernment and with a vital democratic culture.

ese two facets of my vision of a collectively wiser
democracy combine in “citizen deliberative councils”
(cDcs)5. in their current forms – citizens Juries, con-
sensus conferences, Planning cells, citizens assem-
blies, community wisdom councils, etc. – they con-
stitute what i consider the state of the art of citizen
intelligence on public issues.  although i see many
ways they could and should be improved, all these cur-
rent forms oﬀer so much more than traditional forms
of public engagement and inﬂuence – and more than
most other government forums – that i want to take
the opportunity to highlight them, focusing on the
most widely used form, the citizen jury, that has
been held hundreds of times around the world.

a citizens jury is somewhat comparable to a trial
jury, with some signiﬁcant diﬀerences beyond the
fact that it considers a public issue rather than a
crime or a lawsuit. consisting of one to two dozen
diverse citizens selected at random – often with a
demographic ﬁlter to ensure they are in that way rep-
resentative of their community – a citizens jury is con-
vened for several days, usually about a week. it is usu-
ally provided with balanced brieﬁng materials about
the issue upon which its members are to deliberate and
then given access to experts, stakeholders, and/or advo-
cates and opponents of various approaches who testify
to the jury and whom the jury members can question
and cross–examine. e citizens jury is provided with
professional facilitation to help them speak up, hear
each other respectfully and well, and think together
eﬀectively about what they’re learning and what they
wish to recommend. ey consider various options and
trade–oﬀs and, from their newly informed understand-
ings, craft recommendations to address the issue(s) at
hand. eir ﬁnal report is delivered to their convening
authority, the public, the media, and/or other oﬃcials
concerned – after which they disband.
e other forms of cDc named above vary somewhat
from the citizens jury and each other regarding the
number and nature of the jurors, the nature of the
information they access, the length of their under-
taking, the nature of their deliberative and decision-
making processes, and the nature of their report-
out. But they all involve ordinary randomly select-
ed citizens talking in informed, thoughtful ways
about public issues and coming up with consid-
ered, coherent opinions that they share with their
community. in a limited but almost unprece-
dented way, they constitute a legitimate collec-
tive voice of we the People provided with the
resources and context needed to transcend the
divisive, ill-informed, and manipulated routines
of our existing political cultures. ey inject a
level of democratic collective intelligence – of
public wisdom6, if you will – into the public
discourse, a form of expanded collective intelli-
gence heretofore sorely lacking.
legitimate questions may be asked about what
role such citizen deliberative councils should
play in the overall political system and how and
how much they should be empowered. Some
scholars and visionaries like John gastil7 and
Ned crosby8 have imagined plugging such citi-
zen panels into various parts of democratic
process – from reviewing ballot initiatives to eval-
uating candidates. Some like Ernest callenbach9
have proposed an institutionalized citizen legisla-
ture – several hundred randomly selected citizens
serving for one or more years in a legislative body
either replacing the “lower house” (e.g., the house
of representatives or the house of commons) or,
per Ethan leib10, being an additional branch of
government. Some, like Jim rough11, the innova-
tor of community wisdom councils, imagine
them happening annually (or more frequently),
articulating a sort of people’s “state of the com-
munity (or country) report”, just as is now often
done by mayors, presidents, and city managers.
Elsewhere i have raised questions about the
strict legitimacy of cDcs, in the sense that pub-
lic opinion polls are legitimate12. if the pollsters
do a particular poll on a particular population
in a particular way, they know with a particu-
lar level of certainty (the “margin of error”)
how closely a comparable poll on a diﬀerent
but comparable population would come out.
So i have wondered if we held three compara-
ble but independent citizens juries on the same
topic, how similar the results would be. if they
turned out similar, that would be truly revolu-
tionary. if they turned out diﬀerent, the sources
of the diﬀerences could be studied and evaluated,
and implications could be derived for how we
should regard the ﬁndings of single citizen juries.
Even better, further experiments – such as mixing
and matching the citizen jurors from the three ini-
tial groups into three new groups and having them
continue their conversations independently using a
particular method (i have one – Dynamic facilita-
tion13 – particularly in mind when i imagine this) to
see if, why, and how that creates a higher level of
coherence. e point would be that having a demon-
strable and unforced level of informed coherence
emerge from such citizen deliberative councils would
allow us to incorporate the concept of a coherent collec-
tive intelligence of the society – a true and wise voice of
we the People – into our political theories and practices,
and to feel conﬁdent in empowering that voice to actually
shape public policy. if this were to happen, the roles of
representatives and bureaucrats might shift, for example,
to providing a mix of high-level coordination (such as
ensuring that the solution oﬀered for one situation didn’t
create problems in another area) and legalistic articulation
(for example, translating a citizen deliberative council’s
recommendation into enforceable legislation).
But all that is reﬁning this down to a science. i don’t
think citizen deliberative councils – even when done one
at a time – are intrinsically less legitimate than our exist-
ing public oﬃcials and representative deliberative bod-
ies. in fact, those established entities have never been
subjected to tests of strict legitimacy as i have here
proposed for cDcs. ey just do what they do and are
considered legitimate if they arrive at their positions
through due process. eir legitimacy theoretically

derives from their being supposedly answerable
through their elections or appointments. however, as
the system of elections and appointments has become
increasingly corrupted and dysfunctional, that sense of
legitimacy has rapidly eroded to the point where 80% of
americans don’t approve of their own elected con-
gress14. what does the majoritarian representative sys-
tem mean, in the face of this?
R A N D O M

is brings us to the random selection factor. Political
scientist oliver Dowlen15 notes that random selection – at
least in its rigorous forms – creates a “blind break” from
all other forms of inﬂuence. on the one hand, sortition
(as random selection in politics is called) functions free
from the guidance of human compassion, intelligence,
enlightenment, wisdom, integrity, and concern for the
common good. on the other hand, it also provides a
break from the depredations of human cruelty, stupidity,
ignorance, foolishness, corruption, and narrow self-
interest. in short, it is a total break from human inter-
vention and manipulations of all kinds. Most of us
think of random selection as a resort to pure chance.
e ancient athenians – who used it extensively in
their politics and governance, trusting it to serve the
common good far better than elections (which they
felt favored elites)16 – felt random selection represent-
ed the will of the gods17. Take your pick. Either way,
it is a break from human intervention.
us if we have a system of politics and governance
that is ﬂourishing with high quality information,
citizen engagement, high integrity public oﬃcials,
productive conversations and deliberations about
public issues, and a well-functioning government
that the citizenry respects and admires and, when
necessary, can readily correct or recall for the sake
of answerability, then we don’t want to mess
with that by using random selection. on the
other hand, if our politics and government are
rife with misinformation, manipulation, citizen
apathy, corruption in high places, endless and
unproductive verbal battles and battles on the
street, and a government that the vast majority
of citizens do not trust and hold in contempt,
then random selection can be a very potent door-
way into greater sanity.
e trick is to use random selection to provide a
clean break from our political horrors and dys-
functions and then immediately follow that clean
break with a healthy environment of good infor-
mation, good human relationships, and good
deliberation – and then empower what comes out
of that, so that it has the independent collective
intelligence to reorganize the corrupt system and
create something far better in its place. at is what
citizen deliberative councils can be designed to do.

is brings us to three closely related topics:
~  the capacity of we the People to become a
conscious collective agent of our own destiny,
such that we are a true collective entity that can
consciously apply and evaluate our collective
intelligence;
~  the quality of dialogue and deliberation,
such that the diversity of participants becomes
a resource rather than a problem; and
~  the actual wisdom of what emerges from
such conversations, such that it actually gener-
ates broad beneﬁt over the long haul.
Diversity can be said to be the dominant factor
in all of these. Diversity is often problematic
but, used well for collective intelligence, it can
be precious.
when faced both with signiﬁcant diﬀerences –
especially in the form of conﬂict – and the need for
consensus or agreement, our culture’s usual
approach is to silence or marginalize dissenters and
“extreme” perspectives – and any other voice we ﬁnd
hard to confront – and to coax and manipulate what
remains into agreements based on compromise. Every
“side” is expected to let go of what they say they want
and to do some “horse trading” – “i’ll give you this if
you give me that.” often this involves subtle (and not
so subtle) pressures to defer to leaders and/or to conform
to groupthink18 – and, especially in legislatures, making
deals that have nothing to do with the issue at hand.
unfortunately but understandably this has given the
very idea of a coherent collective voice a bad name. Peo-
ple’s experience has taught them that reductionist “con-
sensus” and “the manufacture of consent” – in both its
process and its ﬁnal products – more often than not
oppress their freedoms of speech and action. Suggesting
that “we the People” could speak with one voice that
shapes public policy raises red ﬂags and visions of a pop-
ulist dictatorship subduing all who disagree.
i say “unfortunately” because our current know–how
related to collective intelligence can replace that fearsome
vision with new possibilities that free us from the suppres-
sion and manipulation to which we are today subjected
in the pseudo-democratic systems currently in place.
although compromise and conformist–based approaches
to crafting agreements have a rough workability in top-
down, competitive, interest-driven systems, they waste
the unique gifts of each perspective in comprehending
the larger picture in which the conﬂicted parties are

competing and also the creative potential of people
from all sides of the situation working together to
come up with solutions that actually meet both their
legitimate needs and the demands of the situation
itself. More often than not, the repressed perspectives
represent factors and options that, if actively included,
can make the outcomes wiser – by which i mean that
those outcomes take into account more of what needs to
be taken into account for long-term broad beneﬁt.
using the diversity factor well involves 1) a conscious
eﬀort at inclusion – such as the use of random selection
or inviting a full range of stakeholders involved in the
situation – and then 2) using conversational processes
that radically enhance the capacity of the participants to
hear each other and to feel truly heard.  a minimalist
approach to this is to establish ground rules that direct
people to be respectful and then provide facilitation to
help that happen. facilitation can also ensure that qui-
eter voices speak up and more assertive voices don’t
dominate. at higher levels of conversational quality
and facilitation skill, reﬂective listening is practiced,
such that someone (often the facilitator) reﬂects back
to each speaker what they said in a way that makes the
speaker feel fully heard and understood – including
their emotions and values – not just mimicked. is
practice tends to relax and open up the participants
so that their communications ﬂow together more
smoothly and collaboratively. various methods add
additional beneﬁcial dynamics that move partici-
pants towards creative resolutions: appreciative
inquiry19, for example, asks about what works and
what’s possible. Nonviolent communication20
explores how to fulﬁl everyone’s underlying needs
(much as Principled Negotiation explores how to
satisfy legitimate interests21).  Similarly, restora-
tive justice22 seeks, through dialogue, to replace
punishment and retribution with eﬀorts to
meet the deep needs of victims, oﬀenders, and
community alike. Dynamic facilitation repeat-
edly evokes possible solutions from participants
and reframes disagreements as concerns to be
clariﬁed and recorded. in the presence of such
potent solvents, the positions people arrived
with tend to dissolve into larger and deeper
insights out of which more holistic solutions
can emerge or be created together.
ese approaches seek to evoke coherence out of
diversity. ey are complemented by approaches
that enable people with diverse passions to coexist
in life-aﬃrming ways, especially connecting with
each other for dialogue and collaborative action. an
open Space conference (formally called open
Space Technology23) enables people passionate about
a topic to sort themselves into self–organized work-
shops and activities in the absence of pre-established
schedules and speakers – for a day or for an extremely
stimulating and evolving week. e world café24
engages people interested in particular questions in
small-group conversations among which they peri-
odically mix and share.  in the end the whole group
harvests highlights.  Everyone gets lots of airtime
and ends up hearing much of what’s happened in
the larger group dialogue. future Search25 confer-
ences mix the two approaches to diversity by
bringing together diverse, often adversarial stake-
holders who explore their shared past and the
dynamics of their shared present – and then
explore what they’d all like to see happen. ey
then break up into action groups to foster the
shared vision(s) they developed together. finally,
Polarity Management26 helps us understand that
certain values (like freedom and equality) cannot
both be maximized at the same time. ey both
can, however, be optimized by managing sensitive
balancing feedback dynamics that prevent either
from suppressing the other.
So the kind of coherence we’re looking for is
the kind of coherence that is always provided by
policies and laws, but in this case is being gener-
ated by using diversity creatively rather than sup-
pressing it – and then by encouraging diverse col-
laborations within that shared vision and guid-
ance, with mindful management of any polarities
that are implicit in the issue being addressed. is
is a radical departure from the approaches to coher-
ence used by most societies.
But how does this new “we the People” coherent
voice arise from and reach a whole city or society
containing millions of people?
e key is to make citizen deliberative councils a visi-
ble high point in a larger culture of conversations
about public issues – especially by featuring them in
news media, social networks, and dramatic narratives. i
advocate helping ordinary citizens identify with one or
more of the cDc participants and then publicizing the
ﬂow of their conversation and/or their energy at the
conclusion of their council, so that viewers can vicari-
ously experience the shifts that these diverse people
went through on the road to discovering what they
came up with. a remarkable experiment along these
lines was initiated by Maclean’s magazine in canada, a
project chronicled in detail on my website27.
another powerful approach is the recurrent presentation
of a clear we the People voice to a population which is
invited to participate in that voice. a particularly good
medium for this is an ongoing series of community
wisdom councils which facilitate ever-broader com-
munity practice of what its innovator, Jim rough,
calls “choice–creating conversation”28.  community
members and leaders can generate possible topics to

stimulate the randomly selected members of the
council, who then choose where they want to begin.
in their two dynamically facilitated days together,
council members explore wherever their concerns and
creativity take them and, in the process, generate break-
throughs and vibrant collective energy. e broader
community then participates in the council’s ﬁnal “com-
munity wisdom cafe” and/or learns about it through
media and then joins further conversations stimulated
by the council’s work and report-out. having such
councils held one or more times each year accustoms
community members to using that kind of collabora-
tive conversation to discover shared insights and solu-
tions. is repeated experience enhances the communi-
ty’s collective identity and conﬁdence as we the People
who can take care of our own collective aﬀairs quite
well, thank you29.
W I S D O M
as we saw earlier, collective intelligence can be applied
very narrowly or more broadly. its inclusiveness and
ultimate broad beneﬁt determine how wise it is.
approaches which help people take into account
more big–picture reality, more interconnectedness
and interdependence, and more of the co-created,
co-creative nature of reality30 will involve fewer over-
looked factors and generate fewer unwanted side-
eﬀects, as well as better addressing the needs of
more people and better aligning with more of life’s
natural dynamics. Such factors generate wisdom.
of course the kind of diversity-harnessing conver-
sations noted above contribute tremendously to
comprehending the big picture situation and
generating solutions that embrace all involved.
To that factor we can add the amount and qual-
ity of information accessibly provided to ordi-
nary citizens, especially those selected to speak
for we the People. e work of Edward Tufte31
explores how to present data in meaningful
visual ways and argument mapping32 and fram-
ing for deliberation33 cover the presentation of
diverse perspectives in ways that make them
easy to understand and compare. high quality
information notably includes information
based on systems thinking and other perspec-
tives that clarify the complex fabric of public
issues and human responses to them. Stories of
people from all facets of an issue contain much
of the dynamics of the issue in easily accessible,
often compelling form. Exploring scenarios34 and
trade-oﬀs35 helps community-wisdom-seekers to
avoid oversimplifying what they are dealing with
and to ﬁnd solutions that minimize the potential
downsides that haunt nearly every solution. ey
can also productively tap into the accumulated wis-
dom contained in the patterns and dynamics of
nature and in the processes of evolution: the ﬁeld
of biomimicry36, for example, looks to natural sys-
tems and organisms for solutions nature has
evolved to deal with problems now faced by
engineers and materials scientists.
and since we’re talking about intelligence – and
because we can’t actually adjudicate if a solution
will have long-term broad beneﬁt until long
after it is discovered and applied – iteration
plays a tremendously important role in realizing
wisdom in practice. we need to do our best to
include everything that’s relevant (and then
some), and to craft approaches that seem to us
(without prejudice or denial) to support high
quality of life for all involved… and then we
need to pay attention to what happens when we
actually do it. intelligence involves reﬂecting on
results, taking in lessons, and revising what we’re
doing as needed. erefore, if we wish to be wise,
we need to do that even more mindfully.
other sources of wisdom include engaging all
aspects of ourselves, all our varieties of intelligence,
including reason, emotion, empathy, intuition,
humour, movement, as well as aesthetic and spiritu-
al sensibilities, capacities, and activities37. we are also
wise to consult global wisdom traditions and broadly
shared ethics. Ethical principles common to most
major religions and philosophies – such as the golden
rule – provide time-tested wisdom. (how many
nations, for example, practice a golden rule foreign
policy?) we can augment these with what humanity
has learned more recently through science and global
dialogue about what serves human needs and happiness.
ree good resources for this are the council for a Par-
liament of the world’s religions38, the universal Decla-
ration of human rights39, and the Earth charter40. Non-
violent communication and chilean economist Manfred
Max-Neef provide deep insight into universal human
needs and how to address them wisely41.

while i have focused here on enhancing community –

creative conversational use of diverse perspectives in
politics and governance, there are many other varieties
of collective intelligence that could be integrated into
such a vision. here i will provide a relatively dense
summary of some of the other dimensions of collec-
tive intelligence, just to hint at its scope, its variable
nature, and the vast resources that could be called
upon to enhance its eﬀectiveness. in presenting this

summary, i also want to suggest that it is the tip of
a very big iceberg42.
Power relationships and the design and dynamics of
social systems of course play a powerful role, often
through impacting the quality and ﬂow of information
(as described above), but even by embedding informa-
tion into society’s functioning. Eﬀective transparency
laws, nonproﬁt watchdog organizations, and lenient
whistleblower laws facilitate the ﬂow of information and
thus the quality of political and government intelligence.
e evolving concept of “open source” challenges the
proprietary conﬁnement of knowledge, innovation and
co-creativity in technology, culture, and economic pro-
ductivity. open Source intelligence43 challenges over-
dependence on spying and secrecy and develops public
sources of information and cross-fertilization of intelli-
gence not only in government but also in society at large.
Structural factors like the presence and design of public
spaces – parks, cafés, libraries, meeting rooms – and cul-
tural factors like the kind, ubiquity, and context of
entertainment can facilitate or impede conversation.
we can see information, intelligence and wisdom
embedded in an economic system where the social and
environmental costs of products are “internalized” into
their price – through, for example, taxes on carbon or
on ﬁnancial speculation. is causes people to buy
less damaging products because they are cheaper, cre-
ating an economic system that has wisdom built into
it in the form of less long–term harms and more
long-term beneﬁts44. likewise, guiding public policy
using quality of life indicators more than gross
Domestic Product creates wiser economic moni-
toring and governance45.
certain electronic systems and networks can and
do play a supportive or generative role in collec-
tive intelligence. People use collaborative work-
spaces like wikis and systems like coDigital.com
to originate, evaluate, revise and prioritize items
of common interest such as policy options, ref-
erences, or stories.  aggregation systems like pre-
diction markets can provide high quality crowd-
sourced guesstimates46. Stigmergic47 systems like
those used by amazon, Netﬂix, and Twitter can
track and organize the complex weave of diverse
people’s interests and needs. Such tools can be
used to create participatory evolving knowledge
systems useful to wide audiences, including citi-
zen deliberative councils48.
in general, designs for social and natural systems
can be informed by the theories and practices of
self-organization – including chaos and complexity
theories, living systems theory (including cyber-
netics, ecology, permaculture, and evolutionary
biology), network theory, the “invisible hand” of
the market, “swarm intelligence”49, partnership and
participatory dynamics, etc. good design can eﬃ-
ciently promote vitality and wise responsiveness by
providing contexts for already present or nascent
natural drivers – urges, needs, values, passions, cre-
ativity – and moderating dynamics and feedback
loops to sustain and evolve the living system for
which the designs are intended. of course the
design activity itself must be iterative and rich in
feedback dynamics to observe and correct self-
organizing tendencies that are drifting towards
collective stupidity and folly. i consider initia-
tives guided by sophisticated understandings
of self-organization to be an evolved form of
nonviolent social action50, since physical or
managerial force is replaced by respect, reso-
nance, partnership, and interactive design to
serve the well being of all. from an evolutionary
perspective, i call this “the conscious evolution
of increasingly conscious social systems” and
have envisioned a movement to promote it51).
eories of collective psychosocial ﬁeld eﬀects
– reminiscent of magnetic and gravitational ﬁelds –
have profound implications for social change. in
their process worldwork52 arnold and amy Min-
dell seek to shift collective psychosocial ﬁelds gov-
erning, for example, racism, invoking diverse voic-
es from such a ﬁeld to converse and co-evolve
through their workshop participants. Biologist
rupert Sheldrake hypothesizes collective “morphic
ﬁelds” where the development of habits by certain
kinds of entities – whether crystals, animals, or people –
make it easier for others of that type to learn or develop
those habits53. My own “story ﬁeld” theory suggest
that narrative ﬁelds generated by a society’s media,
advertisements, literature, professional expectations,
educational curricula, and so on, shape what we think
is real, right, and possible54. e Enlightenment, femi-
nism, and using soap operas to reduce spousal abuse55
are examples of relatively successful interventions to
shift cultural story ﬁelds, as is the paradigm shift of
which this magazine is a part.
certain spiritual, psychic, and intuitive practices may
connect with transpersonal sources of intelligence, col-
lective consciousness, and levels of reality or sources of
wisdom beyond normal awareness, usually realms of
deep kinship, synchronicity, wholeness, or oneness.
Some religious groups make decisions based on collec-
tively waiting on Spirit for guidance. Quakers devel-
oped a form of consensus process to integrate the
diverse concerns and insights that “come through”
individuals in such a “meeting for worship for busi-
ness”, yielding a “sense of the meeting”56 (a process i
like to call “co-sensing”, which can manifest in other
processes, as well). in its secular forms, this consen-
sus process spread widely through activist groups

and intentional community networks. Some practices
– ranging from Bohmian Dialogue57 to the evolution-
ary enlightenment of andrew cohen58 – can generate
or access a shared experiential consciousness among
practitioners – as can music (sometimes with the help of
drugs)59. Dream research and dream-sharing cultures
suggest that dreaming can access a shared aspect of our
consciousness60. e collective wisdom initiative61
explores other meditative approaches in this category.
e global consciousness Project notes changes in
random number generators around the world in the
presence of – or even right before – major collective
events like the 9/11 world Trade center attack62. also
the collective consciousness involved in millions of peo-
ple simply watching the same media imagery – as in the
wTc attack – or being told of the same intense event or
reality – such as a war, a famine, or melting glaciers – is
also a very signiﬁcant factor in society–wide collective
intelligence (or stupidity), even though it involves few
if any esoteric dimensions.
finally, there are a number of other ﬁelds where our
growing understanding provides insights highly rele-
vant to enhancing collective intelligence. ese include
subjects like the nature of intelligence itself (from neu-
rology and multiple intelligences63 to cognitive limita-
tions, biases, and blind spots); the nature of human
diversity and human potential (both individual and
collective); the nature of wholeness64 and holistic
patterns (from fractals and holographics to holons
and the relations between wholes and parts); and
the dynamics of evolution65, transformation, and
the responsiveness of people and life.
a particularly important realm for research and
development in this regard is the evolved human
bias for individuals to respond most readily to
challenges that are visible, immediate, and per-
sonal. unfortunately, most of the collective crises
we face – from pollution and climate disruption
to war and technological folly – involve factors
that are largely invisible to most individuals
(from imperceptible radiation and toxins to dis-
tant social disruptions), slow developing (until a
sudden phase shift or “point of no return” is
reached), and systemic (particularly when built
into the structures of society’s functioning)66.
fortunately, this individual human bias for visi-
ble personal immediacy can be compensated for
by collective cultural factors like scientiﬁc research
and sensors, citizen deliberative councils and
compelling media related to them, systemic chan-
nelling of self-interest (as in the “internalization of
costs” noted above), and broad promotion of sys-
tems thinking and holistic awareness (from systemic
curricula and educational ﬁction and ﬁlm to medi-
tation practices and shamanic training). although
we can see examples of such transpersonal capacities
all around us, they clearly fall short of what is need-
ed to meet 21st century challenges, creating a
social-evolutionary pressure for further research
and development.
C O N C L U S I O N
given the role of intelligence in monitoring and
adjusting our relationship with reality, and given
the extent to which our civilization has been
built largely on a uniquely dysfunctional rela-
tionship to reality that now threatens humanity’s
continued existence, work to develop systemic
collective intelligence takes on a new urgency.
collective intelligence is a vast and varied ﬁeld.
e application of collective intelligence in
groups and organizations is important and well-
paid work that has led to very important devel-
opments in this ﬁeld. But now we need to prior-
itize the study, understanding, practice, and
embedding of collective intelligence in our col-
lective social systems, most urgently in our politi-
cal, governance, and economic systems. is
includes the evocation of a self–conscious collec-
tivity – a we the People – capable of generating
and moderating its own collective intelligence – a
phenomenon for which citizen deliberative councils
are a crucial resource.
as we develop society’s collective intelligence capaci-
ties, we can keep in mind the need to always expand
how much of reality is taken into account and how
many needs of how many beings and systems are
being served over how long a time period so that the
guidance provided by our collective intelligence is
more likely to be wise.
given how far and powerfully we have strayed from
wisdom in the past centuries, and the criticality of the
resulting state of aﬀairs in which we ﬁnd ourselves, i
can imagine few more pressing undertakings.

Dynamic facilitation uses the energy of their passions and beliefs
to open their minds and hearts and thus engage them in discover-
ing new ways of looking at a shared situation that makes sense to

27 in 1991 Maclean’s – canada’s national glossy

da’s diversity and had them spend a weekend with Getting
to Yes co-author roger fisher and two aides. Maclean’s
published their bios and a detailed story of their rocky but
ultimately productive conversation culminating in a
remarkable agreement. Maclean’s 40 pages of coverage –
combined with an hour long public aﬀairs Tv documentary
about the process – allowed the entire country to vicariously
experience a totally diﬀerent form of dialogue and citizen-
ship, triggering months of citizen conversation across cana-
da. e entire initiative and media coverage are detailed with

42 in 2006 george Pór <http://bit.ly/gPorci> and i formed the

convrgnc> and worked with robert Steele <http://bit.ly/rS–EiN>
to convene a conference to track and evolve the entire ﬁeld of collec-
tive intelligence. is conference didn’t happen, but the eﬀort did
generate a book, Tovey 2008, Collective Intelligence. also relevant to
the size of the collective intelligence iceberg are works that attempt to
embrace all conversational methodologies and/or to articulate the
underlying dynamics and design elements that make them work or
make them magic. in this latter category we ﬁnd holman et al. 2007,

46 aggregation here refers to the phenomenon described in James
Surowiecki’s book e Wisdom Of Crowds <http://bit.ly/1vcoau3> where-
by many people operating independently can generate remarkably
accurate predictions regarding current realities (how many beans in
the bottle, or the location of a sunken submarine) and future events
(where terrorists will strike next, or who will win the election). is
phenomenon is manifested formally in what are called “prediction
markets” <http://bit.ly/1ryb9SQ>. as useful as prediction markets
may be, i take issue with using the word “wisdom” to describe
them: see <http://bit.ly/1no91lc>.
47 Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination
between agents: a trace left in the environment by one agent
shapes the behaviors of subsequent agents. See
<http://bit.ly/1zeMcux>. in an ant colony, chemical traces
left by one ant stimulate speciﬁc actions in other ants passing
over the ﬁrst ant’s track. Previous customers buying products
from amazon leave digital traces out of which amazon’s
algorithm (not a human analyst) informs you that “people
who bought this product also bought these other products”.
48 for example, a wikipedia-like site could be devel-
oped on which diverse experts and partisans could use the
dynamics in this paragraph to generate evolving issue fram-
ings (see endnote 33) for any and all issues, which could
then be consulted by individual voters and citizen councils.
for a vision about this, see atlee 2012, op. cit.: 141-7.
49 Swarm intelligence is the intelligence manifested by
self-organized collective systems such as bird ﬂocks or their

Pierre Lévy devoted his profes-
sional life to the understand-
ing of the cultural and cogni-
tive implications of the digi-
tal technologies, to promote
their best social uses and to
study the phenomenon of
human collective intelligence.
He introduced the collective
intelligence concept in his 1994 book
collective intelligence and has written
a dozen of books on this subject that have been translated in
more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all
over the world..
Pierre Lévy currently teaches at the communication department
of the University of Ottawa (Canada), where he holds a
Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence. Lévy is fel-
low of the Royal Society of Canada and received several
awards and academic distinctions.

hiS PaPEr waS wriTTEN iN 2014, TwENTy
years after L’intelligence collective [the
original french edition of Collective Intel-
ligence]1. e main purpose of Collective
Intelligence was to formulate a vision of
a cultural and social evolution that would be
capable of making the best use of the new possi-
bilities opened up by digital communication.
long before the success of social networks on
the web2, i predicted the rise of “engineering
the social bond.” Eight years before the founding
of wikipedia in 2001, i imagined an online “cos-
mopedia” structured in hypertext links. when the
digital humanities and the social media had not
even been named, i was calling for an epistemo-
logical and methodological transformation of the
human sciences. But above all, at a time when
less than one percent of the world’s population
was connected3, i was predicting (along with a
small minority of thinkers) that the internet
would become the centre of the global public
space and the main medium of communica-
tion, in particular for the collaborative produc-
tion and sharing of knowledge and the dissem-
ination of news4.
in spite of the considerable growth of interac-
tive digital communication over the past twenty
years, we are still far from the ideal described in
Collective Intelligence. it seemed to me already in
1994 that the anthropological changes under way
would take root and inaugurate a new phase in
the human adventure only if we invented what i
then called an “over-language.” how can com-
munication readily reach across the multiplicity of
dialects and cultures? how can we map the deluge
of digital data, order it around our interests and
extract knowledge from it? how can we master the
waves, currents and depths of the software ocean?
Collective Intelligence envisaged a symbolic system
capable of harnessing the immense calculating power
of the new medium and making it work for our ben-
eﬁt. But the over-language i foresaw in 1994 was still
in the “indiscernible” period, shrouded in “the mists
of the future.” Twenty years later, the curtain of mist
has been partially pierced: the over-language now has a
name, iEMl (acronym for information Economy Meta-
language), a grammar and a dictionary5.

collective intelligence drives human development, and
human development supports the growth of collective
intelligence. By improving collective intelligence we
can place ourselves in this feedback loop and orient it
in the direction of a self-organizing virtuous cycle. is
is the strategic intuition that has guided my research.
But how can we improve collective intelligence? in 1994,
the concept of digital collective intelligence was still rev-
olutionary. in 2014, this term is commonly used by con-
sultants, politicians, entrepreneurs, technologists, acade-
mics and educators. crowdsourcing has become a
common practice, and knowledge management is now
supported by the decentralized use of social media.

net, the development of the knowledge economy, the

THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPT OF
ALGORITHMIC INTELLIGENCE

rush to higher education and the rise of cloud com-
puting and big data are all indicators of an increase in
our cognitive power. But we have yet to cross the
threshold of reﬂexive collective intelligence.
Just as dancers can only perfect their movements by
reﬂecting them in a mirror, just as yogis develop
awareness of their inner being only through the medi-
tative contemplation of their own mind, collective
intelligence will only be able to set out on the path of
purposeful learning and thus move on to a new stage in
its growth by achieving reﬂexivity. it will therefore need
to acquire a mirror that allows it to observe its own cog-
nitive processes.
Be careful! collective intelligence does not and will not
have autonomous consciousness: when i talk about
reﬂexive collective intelligence, i mean that human
individuals will have a clearer and better-shared knowl-
edge than they have today of the collective intelligence
in which they participate, a knowledge based on trans-
parent principles and perfectible scientiﬁc methods.

But how can a mirror of collective intelligence be
constructed? it is clear that the context of reﬂection
will be the algorithmic medium or, to put it anoth-
er way, the internet, the calculating power of cloud
computing, ubiquitous communication and dis-
tributed interactive mobile interfaces. Since we
can only reﬂect collective intelligence in the algo-
rithmic medium, we must yield to the nature of
that medium and have a calculable model of our
intelligence, a model that will be fed by the
ﬂows of digital data from our activities. in short,
we need a mathematical (with calculable models)
and empirical (based on data) science of collec-
tive intelligence. But, once again, is such a sci-
ence possible?
Since humanity is a species that is highly social,
its intelligence is intrinsically social, or collec-
tive. if we had a mathematical and empirical
science of human intelligence in general, we
could no doubt derive a science of collective
intelligence from it. is leads us to a major
problem that has been investigated in the social
sciences, the human sciences, the cognitive sci-
ences and artiﬁcial intelligence since the twenti-
eth century: is a mathematized science of human
intelligence possible?
it is language or, to put it another way, symbolic
manipulation that distinguishes human cognition.
we use language to categorize sensory data, to
organize our memory, to think, to communicate,
to carry out social actions, etc. My research has led
me to the conclusion that a science of human intelli-
gence is indeed possible, but on the condition that
we solve the problem of the mathematical model-
ling of language. i am speaking here of a complete
scientiﬁc modelling of language, one that would
not be limited to the purely logical and syntactic
aspects or to statistical correlations of corpora of
texts, but would be capable of expressing semantic
relationships formed between units of meaning,
and doing so in an algebraic, generative mode6.
convinced that an algebraic model of semantics
was the key to a science of intelligence, i focused
my eﬀorts on discovering such a model; the
result was the invention of iEMl7. iEMl – an
artiﬁcial language with calculable semantics – is
the intellectual technology that will make it
possible to ﬁnd answers to all the above-men-
tioned questions. we now have a complete sci-
entiﬁc modelling of language, including its
semantic aspects. us, a science of human intel-
ligence is now possible. it follows, then, that a
mathematical and empirical science of collective
intelligence is possible. consequently, a reﬂexive
collective intelligence is in turn possible. is
means that the acceleration of human development
is within our reach.

i have written two volumes on my project of develop-
ing the scientiﬁc framework for a reﬂexive collective
intelligence, and i am currently writing the third. is
trilogy can be read as the story of a voyage of discov-
ery. e ﬁrst volume, e Semantic Sphere 1 (2011)8,
provides the justiﬁcation for my undertaking. it con-
tains the statement of my aims, a brief intellectual auto-
biography and, above all, a detailed dialogue with my
contemporaries and my predecessors. with a substantial
bibliography9, that volume presents the main themes of
my intellectual process, compares my thoughts with
those of the philosophical and scientiﬁc tradition,
engages in conversation with the research community,
and ﬁnally, describes the technical, epistemological and
cultural context that motivated my research. why write
more than four hundred pages to justify a program of
scientiﬁc research? for one very simple reason: no one
in the contemporary scientiﬁc community thought
that my research program had any chance of success.
what is important in computer science and artiﬁcial
intelligence is logic, formal syntax, statistics and biologi-
cal models. Engineers generally view social sciences such
as sociology or anthropology as nothing but auxiliary

disciplines limited to cosmetic functions: for example,
the analysis of usage or the experience of users.
in the human sciences, the situation is even more dif-
ﬁcult. all those who have tried to mathematize lan-
guage, from leibniz to chomsky, to mention only the
greatest, have failed, achieving only partial results.
worse yet, the greatest masters, those from whom i
have learned so much, from the semiologist umberto
Eco10 to the anthropologist levi-Strauss11, have stated
categorically that the mathematization of language and
the human sciences is impracticable, impossible, utopian.
e path i wanted to follow was forbidden not only by
the habits of engineers and the major authorities in the
human sciences but also by the nearly universal view that
“meaning depends on context,”12 unscrupulously confusing
mathematization and quantiﬁcation, denouncing on prin-
ciple, reﬂexively, the “ethnocentric bias” of any universalist
approach13 and recalling the “failure” of Esperanto14. i have
even heard some of the most agnostic speak of the curse
of Babel. it is therefore not surprising that i want to
make a strong case in defending the scientiﬁc nature of
my undertaking: all explorers have returned empty-
handed from this voyage toward mathematical lan-
guage, if they returned at all.
T H E
M E T A L A N G U A G E :  I E M L
But one cannot go on forever announcing one’s
departure on a voyage: one must set forth, navi-
gate… and return. e second volume of my trilo-
gy, La grammaire d’IEML15, contains the very tech-
nical account of my journey from algebra to lan-
guage. in it, i explain how to construct sentences
and texts in iEMl, with many examples. But that
150-page book also contains 52 very dense pages
of algorithms and mathematics that show in
detail how the internal semantic networks of
that artiﬁcial language can be calculated and
translated automatically into natural languages.
To connect a mathematical syntax to a seman-
tics in natural languages, i had to, almost single-
handed16, face storms on uncharted seas, to
advance across the desert with no certainty that
fertile land would be found beyond the horizon,
to wander for twenty years in the convoluted
labyrinth of meaning. But by gradually joining
sign, being and thing in turn in the sense of the
virtual and actual, i ﬁnally had my ariadne’s
thread, and i made a map of the labyrinth, a
complicated map of the metalanguage, that
“Northwest Passage”17 where the waters of the
exact sciences and the human sciences converged.
i had set my course in a direction no one considered
worthy of serious exploration since the crossing was
thought impossible. But, against all expectations, my
journey reached its goal. e IEML Grammar is the
scientiﬁc proof of this. e mathematization of lan-
guage is indeed possible, since here is a mathemati-
cal metalanguage. what is it exactly?
iEMl is an artiﬁcial language with calculable seman-
tics that puts no limits on the possibilities for the
expression of new meanings. given a text in
iEMl, algorithms reconstitute the internal gram-
matical and semantic network of the text, trans-
late that network into natural languages and cal-
culate the semantic relationships between that
text and the other texts in iEMl. e metalan-
guage generates a huge group of symmetric trans-
formations between semantic networks, which
can be measured and navigated at will using
algorithms. e IEML Grammar demonstrates
the calculability of the semantic networks and
presents the algorithmic workings of the meta-
language in detail.
used as a system of semantic metadata, iEMl
opens the way to new methods for analyzing
large masses of data. it will be able to support
new forms of translinguistic hypertextual commu-
nication in social media, and will make it possible
for conversation networks to observe and perfect
their own collective intelligence. for researchers in
the human sciences, iEMl will structure an open,
universal encyclopedic library of multimedia data
that reorganizes itself automatically around subjects
and the interests of its users.

having mapped the path i discovered in La grammaire
d’IEML, i will now relate what i saw at the end of my
journey, on the other side of the supposedly impassable
territory: the new horizons of the mind that algorithmic
intelligence illuminates. Because iEMl is obviously not
an end in itself. it is only the necessary means for the
coming great digital civilization to enable the sun of
human knowledge to shine more brightly. i am talking
here about a future (but not so distant) state of intelli-
gence, a state in which capacities for reﬂection, creation,
communication, collaboration, learning, and analysis
and synthesis of data will be inﬁnitely more powerful
and better distributed than they are today. with the
concept of Algorithmic Intelligence, i have completed
the risky work of prediction and cultural creation i
undertook with Collective Intelligence twenty years ago.
e contemporary algorithmic medium is already char-
acterized by digitization of data, automated data pro-
cessing in huge industrial computing centres, interac-
tive mobile interfaces broadly distributed among the
population and ubiquitous communication. we can

make this the medium of a new type of knowledge –
a new episteme18 – by adding a system of semantic
metadata based on iEMl. e purpose of this paper is
precisely to lay the philosophical and historical
groundwork for this new type of knowledge.

Since my project here involves a reﬂexive collective intel-
ligence, i would like to place the theme of reﬂexive
knowledge in its historical and philosophical context. as a
ﬁrst approximation, reﬂexive knowledge may be deﬁned
as knowledge knowing itself. “all men by nature desire
to know,” wrote aristotle, and this knowledge implies
knowledge of the self19.
human beings have no doubt been speculating about
the forms and sources of their own knowledge since the
dawn of consciousness. But the reﬂexivity of knowledge
took a decisive step around the middle of the ﬁrst mil-
lennium BcE20 during the period when the Buddha,
confucius, the hebrew prophets, Socrates and zoroaster
(in alphabetical order) lived. ese teachers involved
the entire human race in their investigations: they
reﬂected consciousness from a universal perspective.
is ﬁrst great type of systematic research on knowl-
edge, whether philosophical or religious, almost
always involved a divine ideal, or at least a certain
“relation to heaven.” us we may speak of a theo-
sophical age of reﬂexive knowledge. i will examine
the aristotelian lineage of this theosophical con-
sciousness, which culminated in the concept of
the agent intellect.
Starting in the sixteenth century in Europe –
and spreading throughout the world with the
rise of modernity – there was a second age of
reﬂection on knowledge, which maintained the
universal perspective of the previous period but
abandoned the reference to heaven and con-
ﬁned itself to human knowledge, with its rec-
ognized limits but also its rational ideal of per-
fectibility. is was the second age, the scientiﬁc
age, of reﬂexive knowledge. here, the investi-
gation follows two intertwined paths: one path
focusing on what makes knowledge possible,
the other on what limits it. in both cases,
knowledge must deﬁne its transcendental subject,
that is, it must discover its own determinations.
ere are many signs in 2014 indicating that in
the twenty-ﬁrst century – around the point where
half of humanity is connected to the internet – we
will experience a third stage of reﬂexive knowledge.
is “version 3.0” will maintain the two previous
versions’ ideals of universality and scientiﬁc per-
fectibility but will be based on the intensive use of
technology to augment and reﬂect systematically
our collective intelligence, and therefore our
capacities for personal and social learning. is is
the coming technological age of reﬂexive knowl-
edge with its ideal of an algorithmic intelligence.
e brief history of these three modalities –
theosophical, scientiﬁc and technological – of
reﬂexive knowledge can be read as a philo-
sophical genealogy of algorithmic intelligence.

a few generations earlier, Socrates might have
been a priest in the circle around the Pythia;
he had taken the famous maxim “Know thyself”
from the Temple of apollo at Delphi. But in the
ﬁfth century BcE in athens, Socrates extended
the Delphic injunction in an unexpected way,
introducing dialectical inquiry. he asked his
contemporaries: what do you think? are you
consistent? can you justify what you are saying
about courage, justice or love? could you repeat
it seriously in front of a little group of intelligent
or curious citizens? he thus opened the door to a
new way of knowing one’s own knowledge, a
rational expansion of consciousness of self.
his main disciple, Plato, followed this path of rigor-
ous questioning of the unthinking categorization of
reality, and ﬁnally discovered the world of ideas. ideas
for Plato are intellectual forms that, unlike the phe-
nomena they categorize, do not belong to the world of
Becoming. ese intelligible forms are the original
essences, archetypes beyond reality, which project into
phenomenal time and space all those things that seem
to us to be truly real because they are tangible, but that
are actually only pale copies of the ideas. we would say
today that our experience is mainly determined by our
way of categorizing it. Plato taught that humanity can
only know itself as an intelligent species by going back to
the world of ideas and coming into contact with what
explains and motivates its own knowledge.
aristotle, who was Plato’s student and alexander the
great’s tutor, created a grand encyclopaedic synthesis
that would be used as a model for eighteen centuries
in a multitude of cultures. in it, he integrates Plato’s
discovery of ideas with the sum of knowledge of his
time. he places at the top of his hierarchical cosmos
divine thought knowing itself. and in his Meta-
physics21, he deﬁnes the divinity as “thought thinking
itself.” is supreme self-reﬂexive thought was for
him the “prime mover” that inspires the eternal
movement of the cosmos. in De Anima22, his book

on psychology and the theory of knowledge, he
states that, under the eﬀect of an agent intellect sep-
arate from the body, the passive intellect of the indi-
vidual receives intelligible forms, a little like the way
the senses receive sensory forms. in thinking these
intelligible forms, the passive intellect becomes one
with its objects and, in so doing, knows itself.
Starting from the enigmatic propositions of aristotle’s
theology and psychology, a whole lineage of Peripatetic
and Neo-Platonic philosophers – ﬁrst “pagans,” then
Muslims, Jews and christians – developed the disci-
pline of noetics, which speculates on the divine intelli-
gence, its relation to human intelligence and the type
of reﬂexivity characteristic of intelligence in general23.
according to the masters of noetics, knowledge can be
conceptually divided into three aspects that, in reality,
are indissociable and complementary:
~ the intellect, or the knowing subject;
~ the intelligence, or the operation of the subject;
~ the intelligible, or what is known – or can be known –
by the subject by virtue of its operation.
from a theosophical perspective, everything that hap-
pens takes place in the unity of a self-reﬂexive divine
thought, or (in the indian tradition) in the conscious-
ness of an omniscient Brahman or Buddha, open to
inﬁnity. in the aristotelian tradition, avicenna, Mai-
monides and albert the great considered that the
identity of the intellect, the intelligence and the
intelligible was achieved eternally in god, in the
perfect reﬂexivity of thought thinking itself.
in contrast, it was clear to our medieval theosophists
that in the case of human beings, the three aspects
of knowledge were neither complete nor identi-
cal. indeed, since the passive intellect knows itself
only through the intermediary of its objects, and
these objects are constantly disappearing and
being replaced by others, the reﬂexive knowl-
edge of a ﬁnite human being can only be partial
and transitory. ultimately, human knowledge
could know itself only if it simultaneously knew,
completely and enduringly, all its objects. But
that, obviously, is reserved only for the divinity.
i should add that the “one beyond the one” of
the neo-Platonist Plotinus and the transcendent
deity of the abrahamic traditions are beyond the
reach of the human mind. at is why our
theosophists imagined a series of mediations
between transcendence and ﬁnitude. in the mid-
dle of that series, a metaphysical interface provides
communication between the unimaginable and
inaccessible deity and mortal humanity dispersed
in time and space, whose living members can never
know – or know themselves – other than partially.
at this interface, we ﬁnd the agent intellect, which is
separate from matter in aristotle’s psychology. e
agent intellect is not limited – in the realm of time –
to sending the intelligible categories that inform the
human passive intellect; it also determines – in the
realm of eternity – the maximum limit of what the
human race can receive of the universal and per-
fectly reﬂexive knowledge of the divine. at is
why, according to the medieval theosophists, the
best a mortal intelligence can do to approach
complete reﬂexive knowledge is to contemplate
the operation in itself of the agent intellect that
emanates from above and go back to the source
through it.
in accordance with this regulating ideal of reﬂex-
ive knowledge, living humanity is structured
hierarchically, because human beings are more or
less turned toward the illumination of the agent
intellect. at the top, prophets and theosophists
receive a bright light from the agent intellect, while at
the bottom, human beings turned toward coarse
material appetites receive almost nothing. e
inﬂux of intellectual forms is gradually obscured
as we go down the scale of degree of openness to
the world above.

with the European renaissance, the use of the
printing press, the construction of new observation
instruments, and the development of mathematics
and experimental science heralded a new era. reﬂec-
tion on knowledge took a critical turn with Descartes’
introduction of radical doubt and the scientiﬁc method,
in accordance with the needs of educated Europe in the
seventeenth century. god was still present in the carte-
sian system, but he was only there, ultimately, to guar-
antee the validity of the eﬀorts of human scientiﬁc
thought: “god is not a deceiver24.” e fact remains that
cartesian philosophy rests on the self-reﬂexive edge, which
has now moved from the divinity to the mortal human: “i
think, therefore i am25.”
in the second half of the seventeenth century, Spinoza
and leibniz received the critical scientiﬁc rationalism
developed by Descartes, but they were dissatisﬁed with
his dualism of thought (mind) and extension (matter).
ey therefore attempted, each in his own way, to
constitute reﬂexive knowledge within the framework
of coherent monism.
for Spinoza, nature (identiﬁed with god) is a unique
and inﬁnite substance of which thought and exten-
sion are two necessary attributes among an inﬁnity of
attributes. is strict ontological monism is counter-
balanced by a pluralism of expression, because the
unique substance possesses an inﬁnity of attributes,

and each attribute, an inﬁnity of modes. e sum-
mit of human freedom according to Spinoza is the
intellectual love of god, that is, the most direct and
intuitive possible knowledge of the necessity that
moves the nature to which we belong.
for leibniz, the world is made up of monads, meta-
physical entities that are closed but are capable of an
inner perception in which the whole is reﬂected from
their singular perspective. e consistency of this radical
pluralism is ensured by the unique, inﬁnite divine intel-
ligence that has considered all possible worlds in order to
create the best one, which corresponds to the most com-
plex – or the richest – of the reciprocal reﬂections of the
monads. as for human knowledge – which is necessarily
ﬁnite – its perfection coincides with the clearest possible
reﬂection of a totality that includes it but whose unity is
thought only by the divine intelligence.
after leibniz and Spinoza, the eighteenth century saw
the growth of scientiﬁc research, critical thought and the
educational practices of the Enlightenment, in particular
in france and the British isles. e philosophy of the
Enlightenment culminated with Kant, for whom the
development of knowledge was now contained within
the limits of human reason, without reference to the
divinity, even to envelop or guarantee its reasoning.
But the ideal of reﬂexivity and universality remained.
e issue now was to acquire a “scientiﬁc” knowl-
edge of human intelligence, which could not be
done without the representation of knowledge to
itself, without a model that would describe intelli-
gence in terms of what is universal about it. is is
the purpose of Kantian transcendental philosophy.
here, human intelligence, armed with its reason
alone, now faces only the phenomenal world.
human intelligence and the phenomenal world
presuppose each other. intelligence is programmed
to know sensory phenomena that are necessarily
immersed in space and time. as for phenomena,
their main dimensions (space, time, causality,
etc.) correspond to ways of perceiving and
understanding that are speciﬁc to human intel-
ligence. ese are forms of the transcendental
subject and not intrinsic characteristics of reality.
Since we are conﬁned within our cognitive possi-
bilities, it is impossible to know what things are
“in themselves.” for Kant, the summit of reﬂex-
ive human knowledge is in a critical awareness
of the extension and the limits of our possibility
of knowing.
Descartes, Spinoza, leibniz, the English and
french Enlightenment, and Kant accomplished a
great deal in two centuries, and paved the way for
the modern philosophy of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries. a new form of reﬂexive knowl-
edge grew, spread, and fragmented into the human
sciences, which mushroomed with the end of the
monopoly of theosophy. as this dispersion
occurred, great philosophers attempted to grasp
reﬂexive knowledge in its unity.
e reﬂexive knowledge of the scientiﬁc era nei-
ther suppressed nor abolished reﬂexive knowledge
of the theosophical type, but it opened up a new
domain of legitimacy of knowledge, freed of the
ideal of divine knowledge. is de jure separation
did not prevent de facto unions, since there was
no lack of religious scholars or scholarly believ-
ers. Modern scientists could be believers or non-
believers. eir position in relation to the divini-
ty was only a matter of motivation. Believers
loved science because it revealed the glory of the
divinity, and non-believers loved it because it
explained the world without god. But neither
of them used as arguments what now belonged
only to their private convictions.
in the human sciences, there were systematic
explorations of the determinations of human exis-
tence. and since we are thinking beings, the deter-
minations of our existence are also those of our
thought. how do the technical, historical, econom-
ic, social and political conditions in which we live
form, deform and set limits on our knowledge?
what are the structures of our biology, our language,
our symbolic systems, our communicative interac-
tions, our psychology and our processes of subjectiva-
tion? Modern thought, with its scientiﬁc and critical
ideal, constantly searches for the conditions and limits
imposed on it, particularly those that are as yet
unknown to it, that remain in the shadows of its con-
sciousness. it seeks to discover what determines it
“behind its back.” while the transcendental subject
described by Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason ﬁxed the
image a great mind had of it in the late eighteenth century,
modern philosophy explores a transcendental subject that
is in the process of becoming, continually being re-exam-
ined and more precisely deﬁned by the human sciences, a
subject immersed in the vagaries of cultures and history,
emerging from its unconscious determinations and the
techno-symbolic mechanisms that drive it.
i will now broadly outline the ﬁgure of the transcenden-
tal subject of the scientiﬁc era, a ﬁgure that re-examines
and at the same time transforms the three complemen-
tary aspects of the agent intellect.
~ e aristotelian intellect becomes living intelligence.
is involves the eﬀective cognitive activities of sub-
jects, what is experienced spontaneously in time by
living, mortal human beings.
~ e intelligence becomes scientiﬁc investigation. i use
this term to designate all undertakings by which the
living intelligence becomes scientiﬁcally intelligible,

including the technical and symbolic tools, the meth-
ods and the disciplines used in those undertakings.
~ e intelligible becomes the intelligible intelligence,
which is the image of the living intelligence that is
produced through scientiﬁc and critical investigation.
an evolving transcendental subject emerges from this
reﬂexive cycle in which the living intelligence contem-
plates its own image in the form of a scientiﬁcally intel-
ligible intelligence. Scientiﬁc investigation here is the
internal mirror of the transcendental subjectivity, the
mediation through which the living intelligence observes
itself. it is obviously impossible to confuse the living
intelligence and its scientiﬁcally intelligible image, any
more than one can confuse the map and the territory, or
the experience and its description. Nor can one confuse
the mirror (scientiﬁc investigation) with the being reﬂected
in it (the living intelligence), nor with the image that
appears in the mirror (the intelligible intelligence). ese
three aspects together form a dynamic unit that would
collapse if one of them were eliminated. while the liv-
ing intelligence would continue to exist without a mir-
ror or scientiﬁc image, it would be very much dimin-
ished. it would have lost its capacity to reﬂect from a
universal perspective.
e creative paradox of the intellectual reﬂexivity of
the scientiﬁc age may be formulated as follows. it is
clear, ﬁrst of all, that the living intelligence is truly
transformed by scientiﬁc investigation, since the liv-
ing intelligence that knows its image through a cer-
tain scientiﬁc investigation is not the same (does not
have the same experience) as the one that does not
know it, or that knows another image, the result of
another scientiﬁc investigation. But it is just as
clear, by deﬁnition, that the living intelligence
reﬂects itself in the intelligible image presented to
it through scientiﬁc knowledge. in other words,
the living intelligence is equally dependent on the
scientiﬁc and critical investigation that produces
the intelligible image in which it is reﬂected.
when we observe our physical appearance in a
mirror, the image in the mirror in no way
changes our physical appearance, only the men-
tal representation we have of it. however, the
living intelligence cannot discover its intelligible
image without including the reﬂexive process
itself in its experience, and without at the same
time being changed. in short, a critical science
that explores the limits and determinations of the
knowing subject does not only reﬂect knowledge
– it increases it. us the modern transcendental
subject is – by its very nature – evolutionary, par-
ticipating in a dynamic of growth.
in line with this evolutionary view of the scientiﬁc
age, which contrasts with the ﬁxity of the previous
age, the collectivity that possesses reﬂexive knowledge
is no longer a theosophical hierarchy oriented toward
the agent intellect but a republic of letters oriented
toward the augmentation of human knowledge, a
scientiﬁc community that is expanding demograph-
ically and is organized into academies, learned soci-
eties and universities. while the agent intellect
looked out over a cosmos emanating from eternity,
in analog resonance with the human microcosm,
the transcendental subject explores a universe
inﬁnitely open to scientiﬁc investigation, technical
mastery and political liberation.

reﬂexive knowledge has, in fact, always been
informed by some technology, since it cannot
be exercised without symbolic tools and thus
the media that support those tools. But the next
age of reﬂexive knowledge can properly be
called technological because the technical aug-
mentation of cognition is explicitly at the centre
of its project. Technology now enters the loop of
reﬂexive consciousness as the agent of the acceler-
ation of its own augmentation. is last point was
no doubt glimpsed by a few pre–twentieth century
philosophers, such as condorcet in the eighteenth
century, in his posthumous book of 1795, Sketch for a
Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind.
But the truly technological dimension of reﬂexive
knowledge really began to be thought about fully only
in the twentieth century, with Pierre Teilhard de
chardin, Norbert wiener and Marshall Mcluhan, to
whom we should also add the modest genius Douglas
Engelbart.
e regulating ideal of the reﬂexive knowledge of the
theosophical age was the agent intellect, and that of the
scientiﬁc-critical age was the transcendental subject. in
continuity with the two preceding periods, the reﬂexive
knowledge of the technological age will be organized
around the ideal of algorithmic intelligence, which inher-
its from the agent intellect its universality or, in other
words, its capacity to unify humanity’s reﬂexive knowledge.
it also inherits its power to be reﬂected in ﬁnite intelli-
gences. But, in contrast with the agent intellect, instead
of descending from eternity, it emerges from the multi-
tude of human actions immersed in space and time.
like the transcendental subject, algorithmic intelligence
is rational, critical, scientiﬁc, purely human, evolution-
ary and always in a state of learning. But the vocation of
the transcendental subject was to reﬂexively contain the
human universe. however, the human universe no
longer has a recognizable face. e “death of man”
announced by foucault26 should be understood in the
sense of the loss of ﬁgurability of the transcendental

subject. e labyrinth of philosophies, methodolo-
gies, theories and data from the human sciences has
become inextricably complicated. e transcendental
subject has not only been dissolved in symbolic struc-
tures or anonymous complex systems, it is also frag-
mented in the broken mirror of the disciplines of the
human sciences.
it is obvious that the technical medium of a new ﬁgure of
reﬂexive knowledge will be the internet, and more gener-
ally, computer science and ubiquitous communication.
But how can symbol-manipulating automata be used on a
large scale not only to reunify our reﬂexive knowledge
but also to increase the clarity, precision and breadth of
the teeming diversity enveloped by our knowledge?
e missing link is not only technical, but also scientiﬁc.
we need a science that grasps the new possibilities oﬀered
by technology in order to give collective intelligence the
means to reﬂect itself, thus inaugurating a new form of
subjectivity. as the groundwork of this new science –
which i call computational semantics – iEMl makes use of
the self-reﬂexive capacity of language without excluding
any of its functions, whether they be narrative, logical,
pragmatic or other.
computational semantics produces a scientiﬁc image
of collective intelligence: a calculated intelligence that
will be able to be explored both as a simulated world
and as a distributed augmented reality in physical
space. Scientiﬁc change will generate a phenome-
nological change27, since ubiquitous multimedia
interaction with a holographic image of collective
intelligence will reorganize the human sensorium.
e last, but not the least, change: social change.
e community that possessed the previous ﬁg-
ure of reﬂexive knowledge was a scientiﬁc com-
munity that was still distinct from society as a
whole. But in the new ﬁgure of knowledge,
reﬂexive collective intelligence emerges from any
human group.
like the previous ﬁgures – theosophical and
scientiﬁc – of reﬂexive knowledge, algorithmic
intelligence is organized in three interdepen-
dent aspects.
~ Reﬂexive collective intelligence represents the liv-
ing intelligence, the intellect or soul of the great
future digital civilization. it may be glimpsed by
deciphering the signs of its approach in contem-
porary reality.
~ Computational semantics holds up a technical
and scientiﬁc mirror to collective intelligence,
which is reﬂected in it. its purpose is to augment
and reﬂect the living intelligence of the coming
civilization.
~ Calculated intelligence, ﬁnally, is none other than the
scientiﬁcally knowable image of the living intelligence
of digital civilization. computational semantics con-
structs, maintains and cultivates this image, which is
that of an ecosystem of ideas coming out of the
human activity in the algorithmic medium and can
be explored in sensory-motor mode.
in short, in the emergent unity of algorithmic
intelligence, computational semantics calculates
the cognitive simulation that augments and
reﬂects the collective intelligence of the coming
civilization.

principles of the collective unconscious, as
described by c. g. Jung (Jung 1959), is
extremely important for psychotherapy
and self-exploration using holotropic
states of consciousness. it also throws new light
on a broad range of other areas – religion and
mysticism, astrology, nature and origin of art,
scientiﬁc insights and inspiration, sociopolitical
phenomena such as wars and revolutions, and
others. i will begin this paper on the importance
of mythic imagination and archetypal psycholo-
gy for modern society with a brief discussion of
the nature and dynamics of the archetypes and
how our understanding of them has changed
over the centuries. following this, i will address
more speciﬁcally the implications of archetypal
thinking for a variety of disciplines and its rele-
vance for the global crisis we are currently facing.
according to the insights that have emerged from
Jungian psychology, consciousness research, and
scholarly mythological studies, archetypes are time-
less primordial cosmic principles underlying,
informing, and forming the fabric of the material
world (Jung 1959). e tendency to interpret the
world in terms of archetypal principles ﬁrst appeared
in ancient greece and was one of the most strik-
ing characteristics of greek philosophy and cul-
ture. as richard Tarnas pointed out in his sequel
to e Passion of the Western Mind entitled Cos-
mos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View
(Tarnas 2006), archetypes can be seen from sever-
al diﬀerent perspectives:
1 ~ in homeric epics they took the form of
personiﬁed mythological ﬁgures, as deities, such
as zeus, Poseidon, Dionysus, hera, aphrodite,
or ares. 
2 ~ in the philosophy of Plato, they were described
as pure metaphysical principles, transcendent ideas
or forms. ey possessed independent existence
of their own in a realm not accessible to ordinary
human senses. according to him, earthly things
partake in the shape or character of these universal
forms or ideas, but they fall far short of the per-
fect glory or perfect reality of these transcendent
forms/ideas (Plato 1961).
3 ~ in modern times, c. g. Jung brought the concept
of archetypes into modern psychology, describing
them primarily as psychological principles.
e existence of hidden invisible dimensions of reality
is an idea that is alien to materialistic science, unless
these can be made accessible through the use of devices
that extend the range of our senses, such as micro-
scopes, telescopes, or sensors detecting various bands of
electromagnetic radiation. in addition, academic and
clinical psychiatrists use a very narrow conceptual frame-
work that limits the human psyche to postnatal biogra-
phy and the freudian individual unconscious. according
to them, the experiences of archetypal beings and realms
are not ontologically real; they are ﬁgments of human
imagination or pathological products of the brain that
require treatment by tranquilizing medication. 
Modern materialistic science thus joined the centuries
old philosophical argument between the nominalists and
realists concerning the ontological nature of archetypes
(Plato’s ideas or forms), a heated debate that had per-
meated in its many variations the entire history of
western thought. e nominalists saw the archetypes
as mere “names,” abstractions from human experience
of concrete objects and situations and thus derivatives
of the material world. e realists believed that the
archetypal world is ontologically real, although not

accessible to human senses. western science domi-
nated by monistic materialism emphatically decided
in favour of the nominalists.
e clinical and philosophical work of c. g. Jung
radically changed this situation. Jung’s analysis of the
dreams and symptoms of his clients, as well as his
study of world mythology, art, comparative religion,
and ritual life of native cultures brought convincing
evidence for the existence of the collective unconscious
and for ontological reality of the archetypes as its gov-
erning principles (Jung 1956, 1959). Jung’s understand-
ing of the nature and function of archetypes changed
dramatically in the course of his life. in his early work,
he saw them as transindividual but essentially intrapsy-
chic phenomena, hardwired into the brain in a way sim-
ilar to animal instincts. however, after he discovered
and studied synchronicity – an “acausal connecting
principle” that links intrapsychic events with happen-
ings in the material world – he realized that they have
what he called “psychoid” quality (Jung 1960). it means
that they govern not only the individual psyche, but
also occurrences in the world of consensus reality. i
have explored this fascinating topic in my other writ-
ings (grof 1985, 2000, and 2006).
Jung observed that everyday life often brings striking
coincidences that by far transcend any reasonable
probability; they should not happen if exclusively
chains of causes and eﬀects governed the universe.
he cited as examples the events in the life of the
austrian biologist Kammerer and flammarion’s
story of the rare plum pudding (Jung 1960). More-
over, he observed that in many of these coinci-
dences intrapsychic experiences, such as dreams
or visions, form meaningful patterns with events
in material reality (see Jung’s example of the
golden scarab or campbell’s story about the
praying mantis and a few others mentioned in
my book When the Impossible Happens – grof
2006). is would be possible only if archetypes
were cosmic organizing principles governing
the human psyche, as well as material reality.
Joseph campbell’s comparative studies of mythol-
ogy brought strong supportive evidence for
Jung’s later understanding of archetypes and
represent an important complement to and sup-
port for Jung’s clinical explorations. of particu-
lar interest in this regard is campbell’s cross-cul-
tural study of the archetypal motif of the hero’s
Journey that he referred to as “monomyth”
because of its universal and ubiquitous nature
transcending historical and geographical bound-
aries. he ﬁrst described this motif in his 1947 clas-
sic e Hero with A ousand faces (campbell 1968)
and later demonstrated how it manifests in a variety
of situations including the shamanic initiatory crisis,
experiences in rites of passage, mysteries of death
and rebirth, and in psychoses or spiritual emergen-
cies. additional validation of the ontological reality
of archetypes came from psychedelic therapy and
powerful non-drug experiential techniques (grof
1985, 2000, 2006).

in the light of the observations from psyche-
delic therapy and the work with holotropic
Breathwork, the cartography of the psyche
used by academic psychiatry and psychology,
which is limited to postnatal biography and to
the freudian individual unconscious, has to be
vastly expanded. it has to include the perinatal
domain and the transpersonal domain – partic-
ularly the collective unconscious with its arche-
typal dynamics (grof 1985, 2000). Modern con-
sciousness research has shown that in holotropic
states archetypes can be directly experienced and
bring new information about mythologies of the
world unknown to the subject (e.g. Jung’s exam-
ple of the chronic schizophrenic patient, who per-
ceived the sun as possessing a phallus and making
wind with its movements, as it is described in
Mithraic mythology – Jung 1956). 
To illustrate this point of view, i would like to describe
one of many situations in which the authenticity of
such information could be veriﬁed. it involved otto,
one of my clients in Prague, whom i treated for depres-
sion and pathological fear of death (thanatophobia). 
in one of his psychedelic sessions, otto experienced a
powerful sequence of psychospiritual death and rebirth.
as the experience was culminating, he had a vision of
an ominous entrance into the underworld guarded by a
terrifying pig goddess. at this point, he suddenly felt an
urgent need to draw a speciﬁc geometrical design and
asked me to bring him some sheets of paper and draw-
ing utensils. he drew an entire series of complex
abstract patterns and he kept impulsively tearing and
crumpling these intricate designs as soon as he ﬁnished
them. he was very dissatisﬁed with his drawings and
was getting increasingly frustrated, because he was not
able to ‘get it right’.
at that time, i was still under a strong inﬂuence of
my freudian training and i tried my best to identify
the unconscious motives for this strange behaviour
by using the method of free associations. we spent
much time on this task, but without much success.
e entire sequence simply did not make any sense.
Eventually, the process moved to other areas and i

stopped thinking about this situation. e whole
episode had remained for me completely mysteri-
ous until many years later, when i moved to the
united States.
During our stay at Esalen, Joseph campbell frequently
conducted workshops there and participated as guest
faculty in many of our month-long seminars. in the
middle of the week, he regularly came for dinner in our
house, because he became tired of the Esalen menu,
which he called “rabbit food.” we had many fascinating
discussions over the years, during which i shared with
him various observations of obscure archetypal experi-
ences from my work that i was not able to understand.
in most instances, Joseph had no diﬃculties identifying
the cultural sources of the symbolism involved.
During one of these discussions, i remembered the
above episode and shared it with him. “how fascinat-
ing,” said Joseph without any hesitation, “it was clearly
the cosmic Mother Night of Death, the Devouring
Mother goddess of the Malekulans in New guinea.”
he then continued to tell me that the Malekulans
believed they would encounter this deity during the
Journey of the Dead.  She had the form of a frighten-
ing female ﬁgure with distinct pig features.  according
to the Malekulan tradition, she sat at the entrance
into the underworld and guarded an intricate sacred
labyrinthine design. 
e Malekulans had an elaborate system of rituals
that involved breeding and sacriﬁcing pigs. is
complex ritual activity was aimed at overcoming
the dependency on their human mothers and
eventually on the Devouring Mother goddess.
e Malekulans spent an enormous amount of
time practicing the art of the labyrinth drawing,
since its mastery was considered essential for a
successful journey to the Beyond. Joseph, with
his lexical knowledge, was able to solve an
important part of this puzzle that i had come
across during my research. e remaining ques-
tion, that even he was not able to answer, was
why my client had to encounter speciﬁcally this
Malekulan deity at that particular time of his
therapy. however, the task of mastering the
posthumous journey certainly made good sense
for somebody whose main symptom was patho-
logical fear of death.
of the many experiences involving the arche-
typal world that i have myself had in my psy-
chedelic sessions, the most interesting one hap-
pened in a session with MDMa.
about ﬁfty minutes into the session, i started
experiencing strong activation in the lower part
of my body. My pelvis was vibrating as enormous
amounts of energy were being released in ecstatic
jolts. at one point, this streaming energy swept me
along in an intoxicating frenzy into a whirling cos-
mic vortex of creation and destruction.
in the centre of this monstrous hurricane of pri-
mordial forces were four giant herculean ﬁgures
performing what seemed to be the ultimate cos-
mic sabre dance. ey had strong Mongolian
features with protruding cheekbones, oblique
eyes, and clean-shaven heads decorated by large
braided ponytails. whirling around in a frantic
dance craze, they were swinging large weapons
that looked like scythes or l-shaped scimitars;
all four of these combined formed a rapidly
rotating swastika. 
i intuitively understood that this monumental
archetypal scene was related to the beginning of
the process of creation and simultaneously to
the ﬁnal stage of the spiritual journey. in the
cosmogenetic process (in the movement from
the primordial unity to the worlds of plurality)
the blades of the scimitars represented the force
that is splitting and fragmenting the uniﬁed ﬁeld
of cosmic consciousness and creative energy into
countless individual units. in relation to spiritual
journey, they represented the stage when the seeker’s
consciousness transcends separation and polarity
and reaches the state of original undiﬀerentiated
unity. e direction of this process seemed to be
related to the clockwise and counter clockwise rota-
tion of the blades. Projected into the material world,
this archetypal motif seemed to be related to growth
and development (the fertilized egg or seed becoming
an organism) or destruction of forms (wars, natural
catastrophes, decay).
en the experience opened up into an unimaginable
panorama of scenes of destruction. in these visions, nat-
ural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,
crashing meteors, forest ﬁres, ﬂoods and tidal waves,
were combined with images of burning cities, entire
blocks of collapsing high-rise buildings, mass death, and
horror of wars. heading this wave of total annihilation
were four archetypal images of macabre riders symboliz-
ing the end of the world. i realized that these were the
four horsemen of the apocalypse. (pestilence, war,
famine, and death). e continuing vibrations and jolts
of my pelvis now became synchronized with the move-
ments of this ominous horseback riding and i joined the
dance, becoming one of them, or possibly all four of
them at once, leaving my own identity behind.
Suddenly, there was a rapid change of scenery and i
had a vision of the cave from Plato’s Republic. in this
work, Plato describes a group of people who live
chained all of their lives in a cave, facing a blank wall.
ey watch shadows projected on the wall by things
passing in front of the cave entrance. according to
Plato, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get

to see reality. e enlightened philosopher is like a
prisoner who is freed from this illusion and comes
to understand that the shadows on the wall are illu-
sory, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather
than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners. is
was followed by profound and convincing realization
that the material world of our everyday life is not
made of “stuﬀ” but created by cosmic consciousness by
inﬁnitely complex and sophisticated orchestration of
experiences. it is a divine play that the hindus call lila,
created by cosmic illusion, maya.
e ﬁnal major scene of the session was a magniﬁcent
ornate theatre stage featuring a parade of personiﬁed
universal principles, archetypes – cosmic actors, who
through a complex interplay create the illusion of the
phenomenal world. ey were protean personages with
many facets, levels, and dimensions of meaning that
kept changing their forms in extremely intricate holo-
graphic interpenetration as i was observing them. Each
of them seemed to represent simultaneously the essence
of his or her function and all the concrete manifesta-
tions of this element in the world of matter. ere was
Maya, the mysterious ethereal principle symbolizing
the world illusion; anima, embodying the eternal
female; a Mars-like personiﬁcation of war and aggres-
sion; the lovers, representing all the sexual dramas
and romances throughout ages; the royal ﬁgure of
the ruler; the withdrawn hermit; the elusive Trick-
ster; and many others. as they were passing across
the stage, they bowed in my direction, as if expect-
ing appreciation for the stellar performance in the
divine play of the universe.
e work with holotropic states of consciousness
has shown beyond any reasonable doubt that
archetypal experiences are not erratic products of
brain pathology of unknown origin (symptoms of
“endogenous psychoses”), but contents of the col-
lective unconscious emerging into individual con-
sciousness (grof 2000). To distinguish transper-
sonal experiences from imaginary products of
individual fantasy, Jungian psychologists refer to
the archetypal domain as imaginal. french scholar,
philosopher, and mystic, henri corbin, who
ﬁrst used the term mundus imaginalis, was
inspired in this regard by his study of islamic
mystical literature (corbin 2000). research of
holotropic states has also revealed the existence
of the perinatal domain in the unconscious,
which contains a unique mixture of fetal and
archetypal elements. is has profound theoretical
and practical implications for psychiatry, psychol-
ogy, and psychotherapy:
a ~ archetypes play an important role in the gen-
esis of emotional and psychosomatic symptoms as
part of multilevel dynamic systems that consist of
biographical, perinatal, and transpersonal material
(coEx systems). conversely, archetypes can also
play an important role in healing and transforma-
tion (the extreme example being emergence and
integration of a demonic archetype).
B ~ is is closely related to the inner self-healing
intelligence of the psyche (Jung’s individuation
process) and the healing potential of archetypal
ﬁgures, or of the divine energy that ancient and
native cultures have seen as divine (apollo in
the greek temple incubation; deities of the
caribbean and South american syncretistic
religions – the loa in voodoo or orishas in
umbanda and Santeria; pneuma of the gnos-
tics; prana of Kundalini yoga; ntum of the
Kalahari Bushmen; mana of the Polynesians,
and others).
c ~ e discovery of the ontological reality of the
archetypal realm and the inner healing intelli-
gence supports the concept of “spiritual emer-
gency” (emergence of perinatal and transpersonal
material into consciousness) as an alternative to
the medical understanding of “endogenous psy-
choses” as mental diseases, caused by a pathological
process and requiring suppressive therapy by tran-
quilizers (grof and grof 1989, grof and grof 1991).

archetypes play an important role in the genesis of
scientiﬁc theories and in scientiﬁc discoveries. as
Philipp frank has shown in his Philosophy of Science
(1957), the source of the basic axiom of a scientiﬁc
theory or the source of a scientiﬁc discovery is often
an archetypal motif. in the history of science revolu-
tionary ideas often emerge long before there is suﬃ-
cient evidence to justify them or support them. 
Salient examples are the ionic philosopher anaximan-
der with his protoevolutionary theory suggesting that
all life originated in the ocean, Democritus and leucip-
pus with their atomic theory of matter, copernicus and
Kepler who drew their inspiration from the solar arche-
type, and friedrich Kekule inspired by the vision of
uroboros in his discovery of the benzene ring. addi-
tional fascinating examples can be found in willis har-
man Higher Creativity: Liberating the Unconscious for
Breakthrough Insights (harman 1984).
Edgar allan Poe’s essay Eureka is a particularly inter-
esting example of inspiration mediated by visions with
archetypal context. Poe’s cosmological vision bears
deep resemblance not only to the scriptures of what
aldous huxley called perennial philosophy (huxley
1945), but also to theories of modern science, in his
case to cosmological speculations of famous physi-
cists supported by astronomical observations. Poe

himself believed that his Eureka would revolutionize
astronomy and his ideas have been actually seriously
discussed in scientiﬁc circles. one of Poe’s major
hypotheses – that the universe ﬁlled with matter after
a single, high-energy particle exploded – was the
rough equivalent of the cosmogenetic theory devel-
oped in the twentieth century by lemaitre, gamov,
and alpher. its opponent fred hoyle referred to it face-
tiously as the Big Bang theory and it has been known
under this name ever since. it has remained one of the
leading cosmogenetic theories until this day (alpher and
herman 2001). 
Poe theorized that the universe must be expanding,
since the energy of the explosion is pushing matter out-
ward. he also concluded that gravity eventually would
pull all particles back together and the process would
start all over again; this idea appeared in alexander
friedman’s theory of the pulsating universe (friedman
1922). Modern consciousness research has shown that
visionary states have a remarkable potential to provide
not only extraordinary religious illumination and artis-
tic inspiration, but also brilliant scientiﬁc insights that
open new ﬁelds and facilitate scientiﬁc problem-solv-
ing. Numerous examples of this kind can be found in
willis harman Higher Creativity: Liberating the
Unconscious for Breakthrough Insights (harman 1984)
excellent book.
ere is also increasing awareness of the importance
of archetypal patterns in various scientiﬁc disci-
plines. here belongs goethe’s fascination by the
building plan of plants, gregory Bateson’s preoccu-
pation with the “pattern that connects” in nature
and in evolutionary theory, Sheldrake’s concept of
morphogenetic ﬁelds, Ernst haeckel’s research of
art forms in nature, Mandelbrot’s study of fractals
mimicking archetypal forms in nature, ilya Pri-
gogine’s theory of dissipative structures, and
emergence of order from chaos, and others
(goethe 2009, Bateson 1979, Sheldrake 1981,
Mandelbrot 1982, Prigogine and Stengers 1984).
additional examples are mathematical archetyp-
al formulas that underline the growth of sea shell
shapes (Nautilus), branching plants, seed heads,
leaves and petal arrangements, pine cones, and
crystals, such as the fibonacci series, the golden
section, or the golden String.

e discovery that the archetypal world is onto-
logically real gives legitimacy to the spiritual
worldview, spiritual quest, and to religious activity
that involves direct experience. it makes it possible
to distinguish organized religions based on belief,
with their dogmas, ritualism, moralism, and secular
ambitions, from authentic spirituality found in the
monastic and mystical branches of religions, ritu-
als of native cultures, and traditions emphasizing
spiritual practice and direct experience.
Spirituality is based on personal experiences of
non-ordinary aspects and dimensions of reality.
it does not require a special place or an oﬃcially
appointed persons mediating contact with the
divine. e mystics do not need churches or
temples. e contexts in which they experience
the sacred dimensions of reality, including their
own divinity, are their bodies and nature. and
instead of oﬃciating priests, they need a sup-
portive group of fellow seekers or the guidance
of a teacher who is more advanced on the inner
journey than they are themselves.
according to Joseph campbell (echoing Dürck-
heim), another important distinction to make is
the diﬀerence between idolatry and mysticism:
“a useful deity (archetypal ﬁgure) has to be trans-
parent to the transcendent;” it has to point to the
absolute, but not be mistaken for it. Making the
archetypal ﬁgure opaque and worshipping it as the
ultimate is idolatry; it results in a religion that
unites within its radius, but divides the world into
rival groups – christians/pagans, Moslems/inﬁdels,
Jews/goyim.
e realization of the ontological reality of the
archetypal world validates the ritual and spiritual life
of pre-industrial cultures – shamanism, rites of pas-
sage, mysteries of death and rebirth, and the great
religions and spiritual philosophies of the East and
west. of these, rites of passage are of particular
importance for modern society. according to scholars,
such as Margaret Mead and Mircea Eliade the fact that
the industrial civilization has lost meaningful rites of
passage contributes signiﬁcantly to the ills of modern
society, particularly of the young generation – sexual
acting out, drug abuse, and violence.
in 1973, i had the opportunity to participate in the small
brain-storming conference of the weenner-gren foun-
dation Ritual: Reconciliation in Change organized by
Margaret Mead and catherine Bateson that took place
in Burg wartenstein in austria, (Mead and Bateson
1973). Eighteen invited presenters discussed the question
whether it would be possible to create modern rites of
passages, or if they need to emerge spontaneously from
the spiritual history of the cultures involved. Pre-prints
of the participants used at this conference as a basis for
round table discussions are in the New york archives
of the wenner-gren foundation. 
Several years ago, my wife christina’s gave a paper at
a conference, convened by a New york state legislator

on the same subject – importance of rites of passage
and the possibility of recreating and reinstituting
them (grof 1998). Participants discussed the possibili-
ty of combining such elements as ropes courses, out-
ward bound, ﬁre walking, and holotropic Breathwork
(since all native rites of passage involve holotropic states
of consciousness and under current circumstances, the
logical choice for this purpose – responsible ritual use of
psychedelics – is unlikely.

archetypal forces govern not only processes in the indi-
vidual psyche, but also in the collective psyche; they are
driving forces of human history. Medieval knights were
asked to sacriﬁce their lives for Jesus and participate in
the crusades to recover the holy land from the Mus-
lims. e Bohemian hussites called themselves “war-
riors of god” and sung their powerful chorale “ye
who are the warriors of god” with such compelling
power that it allegedly wreaked havoc among the
much larger armies of crusaders they were about to
engage and made them ﬂee the battleﬁeld. hitler
used archetypal symbols to inﬂuence his followers –
the reversed vedic images of the swastika and the
solar eagle, the ousand years’ reich, and the
supremacy of the Nordic race.
c. g. Jung noticed that the archetypal motif of
wotan kept appearing in the dreams of his ger-
man patients and discussed the political impor-
tance of the wotan archetype for germany. he
concluded that germany was facing a national
catastrophe that would be destructive and self-
destructive in nature (Jung 1964). he also ana-
lyzed the personalities of hitler, Stalin, and
Mussolini and pointed out the mystical, “medi-
cine-man” qualities in hitler (Jung 1950).  e
idea that hitler was a deranged mystic was
explored also in Trevor ravenscroft’s book e
Spear of Destiny, in which he discussed the role
that fascination by the sword that the roman
centurion cassius longinus used to pierce the
side of Jesus (the “holy lance”) played in
hitler’s life (ravenscroft 1982). 
Marie-louise von franz discussed in her article
e Transformed Berserk the importance that
the vision of wotanic christ (christ as Berserker),
which the patron saint of Switzerland Nikolas
von flue experienced in his meditation, had for
the future of her homeland. following his vision,
Nikolas left his hermitage and negotiated peace for
Switzerland in a conﬂict that threatened to develop
into a war. von franz attributed the fact that
Switzerland has not been since that time involved in
any war to this experience of its patron saint inte-
grating the shadow side in Jesus’ personality (von
franz 1988). James hillman amassed in his bril-
liant A Terrible Love of War convincing evidence
that war is a formidable archetypal force that has
irresistible power over individuals and nations
(hillman 2004).
ronald reagan made in his speeches references
to the apocalypse and called the Soviet union
the “Evil Empire.” george Bush called his ﬁght
against Muslim terrorists a “crusade”; in turn,
Muslim extremists use for political purposes
the concept of jihad, the holy war against the
inﬁdels, and Muslim terrorists expect as reward
for their suicidal attacks on inﬁdels the delights
of Paradise, including the virginal black-eyed
houris. Similarly in the Second world war the
Japanese kamikaze soldiers were referred to as
“Divine wind warriors”; they believed that
they sacriﬁced their life for the living god
“Emperor of heaven” hirohito. 
e authors of the strategic doctrine refer to
members of their community as the “nuclear
priesthood.” e ﬁrst atomic test was called Trin-
ity – the unity of father, Son, and holy ghost.
e scientists who worked on the atomic bomb
and witnessed the test described it in the following
way: “it was as though we stood at the ﬁrst day of
creation.” and robert oppenheimer thought of
Krishna’s words to arjuna in the Bhagavad gita: “i
am become Death, the Shatterer of worlds.”
work with holotropic states of consciousness, with
and without psychedelics, oﬀers fascinating insights
into the archetypal and perinatal roots of war and
bloody revolution. on the perinatal level, reliving of
various stages of biological birth is often associated with
images of violent socio-political events and visions of
archetypal ﬁgures and motifs. e connection between
the archetypal elements and the stages of birth is very spe-
ciﬁc. i call these experiential clusters – combining fetal
elements with the corresponding archetypal imagery and
scenes from the historical unconscious – Basic Perinatal
Matrices (BPMs) (grof 1985, 2000). 
while we are reliving episodes of undisturbed intrauterine
existence (BPM i), we typically experience images from
human societies where people live in harmony with
each other and with nature. e archetypal domain
contributes images of paradises and heavens of various
cultures. Disturbing intrauterine memories, such as
those of a toxic womb, imminent miscarriage, or
attempted abortion, are accompanied by images of
human groups living in industrial areas where nature
is polluted and spoiled, or in societies with insidious
social order and all-pervading paranoia as described

in orwell’s 1984 (orwell 1949). corresponding arche-
typal images feature insidious demons.
Typical archetypal images associated with the onset of
delivery are ominous whirlpools, giant engulﬁng or
constricting monsters (dragon, leviathan, whale, taran-
tula, octopus), or visits into the underworld. regressive
experiences related to the fully developed ﬁrst clinical
stage of birth (BPM ii), during which the uterus periodi-
cally contracts but the cervix is not open, present a very
characteristic picture. ey portray oppressive and abu-
sive totalitarian societies with closed borders, victimizing
their populations, and “choking” personal freedom, such
as czarist or communist russia, hitler’s ird reich,
South american dictatorships, and the african apartheid),
or bring speciﬁc images of the inmates in Nazi concentra-
tion camps and Stalin’s gulag archipelago. while experi-
encing these scenes of living hell, we identify exclusively
with the victims and feel deep sympathy for the down-
trodden and the underdog. underlying all these is the
archetype of hell – extreme physical and emotional suf-
fering that will never end, complete with the images of
devils and sinners.
e experiences accompanying reliving of the second
clinical stage of delivery (BPM iii), when the cervix is
dilated and continued contractions propel the foetus
through the narrow passage of the birth canal, feature a
rich panoply of violent scenes — bloody wars and rev-
olutions, human or animal slaughter, mutilation, sex-
ual abuse, and murder. ese scenes often contain
demonic elements and repulsive scatological motifs.
additional frequent concomitants of BPM iii are
visions of ﬁre – burning cities, launching of rockets,
and explosions of nuclear bombs. here we are not
limited to the role of victims, but can participate in
three roles: that of the victim; of the aggressor;
and of an emotionally involved observer. 
e accompanying archetypal images portray bat-
tles of cosmic proportions – ragnarok or Twi-
light of the gods from Nordic mythology, battle
between the forces of light and Darkness such as
the zoroastrian ormuzd and ahriman’s armies,
archangel Michael battling Satan’s hordes,
Mara’s army attacking the Buddha, or armaged-
don. additional archetypal motifs associated
with BPM iii are eerie scenes combining aggres-
sion, sex, and scatology, as exempliﬁed by the
Black mass rituals, satanic orgies, and walpurgi’s
Night, or Sabbath of the witches. when the
third matrix approaches resolution, the accompa-
nying archetypal visions feature ﬁgures represent-
ing psychospiritual death and rebirth, such as Jesus
christ, osiris, Dionysus, Quetzalcoatl, inanna,
Jesus, and Phoenix, and exploding volcano or
deities associated with ﬁre, such as Moloch or Pele).
e events characterizing the third clinical stage of
delivery (BPM iv), the actual moment of birth and
the separation from the mother, are typically associ-
ated with images of victory in wars and revolutions,
liberation of prisoners, and success of collective
eﬀorts, such as patriotic or nationalistic move-
ments. at this point, we can also experience
visions of triumphant celebrations and parades or
of exciting post-war reconstruction. archetypal
motifs that belong here are scenes of rebirth of
deities and demigods, rainbow spectra, peacock
designs, great Mother goddesses, and images of
deities appearing in light (angelic beings, gand-
harvas and apsaras, etc.).
in 1975, i described these observations, linking
socio-political upheavals to stages of biological
birth, in Realms of the Human Unconscious
(grof 1975). Shortly after its publication, i
received a letter from lloyd de Mause, a New
york psychoanalyst and journalist. De Mause is
one of the founders of psychohistory, a disci-
pline that applies the ﬁndings of depth psycholo-
gy to history and political science (Mause 1975).
Psychohistorians study such issues as the relation-
ship between the childhood history of political
leaders and their system of values and process of
decision-making, or the inﬂuence of child-rearing
practices on the nature of revolutions of that par-
ticular historical period. lloyd de Mause was very
interested in my ﬁndings concerning the trauma of
birth and its possible socio-political implications,
because they provided independent support for his
own research.
for some time, de Mause had been studying the psy-
chological aspects of the periods preceding wars and
revolutions. it interested him how military leaders suc-
ceed in mobilizing masses of peaceful civilians and trans-
forming them practically overnight into killing machines.
his approach to this problem was very original and cre-
ative. in addition to analysis of traditional historical
sources, he drew data of great psychological importance
from caricatures, jokes, dreams, personal imagery, slips of
the tongue, side comments of speakers, and even doodles
and scribbles on the edge of the rough drafts of political
documents. By the time he contacted me, he had ana-
lyzed in this way seventeen situations preceding the out-
break of wars and revolutionary upheavals, spanning
many centuries since antiquity to most recent times.
he was struck by the extraordinary abundance of ﬁg-
ures of speech, metaphors, and images related to bio-
logical birth that he found in this material. Military
leaders and politicians of all ages describing a critical
situation or declaring war typically used terms that
equally applied to perinatal distress. ey accused the
enemy of choking and strangling their people,
squeezing the last breath out of their lungs, or con-
stricting them and not giving them enough space to
live (hitler’s Lebensraum). we could illustrate this

by the recent example of Daʿish (iSiS) threatening
to turn united States into a “choking hell.”
Equally frequent were allusions to dark caves, tun-
nels, and confusing labyrinths, dangerous abysses
into which one might be pushed, and the threat of
engulfment by treacherous quicksand or a terrifying
whirlpool. Similarly, the oﬀer of the resolution of the
crisis comes in the form of perinatal images. e
leader promises to rescue his nation from an ominous
labyrinth, to lead it to the light on the other side of the
tunnel, and to create a situation where the dangerous
aggressor and oppressor will be overcome and every-
body will again “breathe freely.”
lloyd de Mause’s historical examples at the time includ-
ed such famous personages as alexander the great,
Napoleon, Samuel adams, Kaiser wilhelm ii, hitler,
Khrushchev, and Kennedy. Samuel adams talking
about the american revolution referred to “the child of
independence now struggling for birth.” in 1914, Kaiser
wilhelm stated that “the Monarchy has been seized by
the throat and forced to choose between letting itself
be strangled and making a last ditch eﬀort to defend
itself against attack.” During the cuban missile crisis
Khrushchev wrote to Kennedy, pleading that the two
nations not “come to a clash, like blind moles bat-
tling to death in a tunnel.”
Even more explicit was the coded message used by
Japanese ambassador Kurusu when he phoned
Tokyo to signal that negotiations with roosevelt
had broken down and that it was all right to go
ahead with the bombing of Pearl harbor. he
announced that the “birth of the child was immi-
nent” and asked how things were in Japan: “Does
it seem as if the child might be born?” e reply
was: “yes, the birth of the child seems immi-
nent.” interestingly, the american intelligence
listening in recognized the meaning of the “war-
as-birth” code.
Particularly chilling was the use of perinatal lan-
guage in connection with the explosion of the
atomic bomb in hiroshima. e airplane was
given the name of the pilot’s mother, Enola
gay, the atomic bomb itself carried the painted
nickname e Little Boy, and the agreed-upon
message sent to washington as a signal of suc-
cessful detonation was “e baby was born.” it
would not be too far-fetched to see the image of
a newborn also behind the nickname of the
Nagasaki bomb, Fat Man. Since the time of our
correspondence, lloyd de Mause collected many
additional historical examples and reﬁned his the-
sis that the memory of the birth trauma plays an
important role as a source of motivation for vio-
lent social activity.
e issues related to nuclear warfare are of such
relevance that i would like to elaborate on them
using the material from a carol cohn’s fascinating
paper “Sex and Death in the rational world of the
Defense intellectuals” (cohn 1987). e Defense
intellectuals (Dis) are civilians who move in and
out of government, working sometimes as admin-
istrative oﬃcials or consultants, sometimes at
universities and think-tanks. ey create the the-
ory that informs and legitimates uS nuclear
strategic practice – how to manage the arms
race, how to deter the use of nuclear weapons,
how to ﬁght a nuclear war if the deterrence fails,
and how to explain why it is not safe to live
without nuclear weapons. 
carol cohn had attended a two-week summer
seminar on nuclear weapons, nuclear strategic
doctrine, and arms control. She was so fascinat-
ed by what had transpired there that she spent
the following year immersed in the almost
entirely male world of defense intellectuals
(except for secretaries). She collected some
extremely interesting facts conﬁrming the peri-
natal dimension in nuclear warfare. in her fasci-
nating paper, she mentions eight historical exam-
ples, where coded messages and other communi-
cations about development and testing of atomic
and hydrogen bombs involved references to birth
and newborns.
further support for the pivotal role of the perinatal
and archetypal domains of the unconscious in war
psychology can be found in Sam Keen’s excellent
e Faces of the Enemy (Keen 1988) and a Tv docu-
mentary of the same name. Keen brought together
an outstanding collection of distorted and biased war
posters, propaganda cartoons, and caricatures from
many historical periods and countries. he demonstrat-
ed that the way the enemy is described and portrayed
during a war or revolution is a stereotype that shows
only minimal variations and has very little to do with
the actual characteristics of the country and culture
involved.  he was able to divide these images into sever-
al archetypal categories according to the prevailing char-
acteristics (e.g., Stranger, aggressor, worthy opponent,
faceless, Enemy of god, Barbarian, greedy, criminal,
Torturer, rapist, Death). according to Keen, the alleged
images of the enemy are essentially projections of the
repressed and unacknowledged shadow aspects of our
own unconscious. although we would certainly ﬁnd in
human history instances of just wars, those who initiate
war activities are typically substituting external targets
for elements in their own psyches that should be prop-
erly faced in personal self-exploration.
Keen’s theoretical framework does not speciﬁcally
include the perinatal domain of the unconscious.
however, the analysis of his picture material reveals
preponderance of archetypal images that are charac-
teristic of BPM ii and BPM iii. e enemy is typically

depicted as a dangerous octopus, a vicious dragon, a
multiheaded hydra, a giant venomous tarantula, or
an engulﬁng leviathan. other frequently used sym-
bols include vicious predatory felines or birds, mon-
strous sharks, and ominous snakes, particularly vipers
and boa constrictors. Scenes depicting strangulation or
crushing, ominous whirlpools, and treacherous quick-
sand also abound in pictures from the time of wars, rev-
olutions, and political crises. Juxtaposition of pictures
from holotropic states of consciousness that depict peri-
natal experiences with the historical pictorial documen-
tation collected by lloyd de Mause and Sam Keen repre-
sents strong evidence for the perinatal and transpersonal
roots of human violence.
according to the new insights, provided jointly by
observations from consciousness research and the ﬁnd-
ings of psychohistory, we all carry in our deep uncon-
scious powerful energies and emotions associated with
the trauma of birth that we have not adequately mas-
tered and assimilated. e symbolism associated with
them is drawn from deep archetypal sources. for some
of us, this aspect of our psyche can be completely
unconscious, until and unless we embark on some in-
depth self-exploration with the use of psychedelics or
some powerful experiential techniques of psychother-
apy, such as the holotropic breathwork or rebirthing.
others can have varying degrees of awareness of the
emotions and physical sensations from the perinatal
and transpersonal level of the unconscious.
activation of this material can lead to serious indi-
vidual psychopathology, including unmotivated
violence. it seems that, for unknown reasons, the
awareness of the perinatal elements can increase
simultaneously in a large number of people. is
creates an atmosphere of general tension, anxiety,
and anticipation. e leader is an individual
who is under a stronger inﬂuence of the perina-
tal energies than the average person. he also has
the ability to disown his unacceptable feelings
(the Shadow in Jung’s terminology) and to pro-
ject them on the external situation. e collec-
tive discomfort is blamed on the enemy and a
military intervention is oﬀered as a solution.
historical and astrological research of richard
Tarnas threw fascinating new light on de Mause’s
idea of the collective tension originating in the
perinatal unconscious, which typically precedes
onset of wars and revolutions. in his meticulous
explorations, Tarnas recognized the deep correla-
tion between the phenomenology of what i call
Basic Perinatal Matrices (BPMs) and astrological
archetypes (BPM i and Neptune, BPM ii and Saturn,
BPM iii, and Pluto and BPM iv and uranus). he
also was able to demonstrate throughout human
history deep correlations between the periods of wars
and revolutions and hard aspects of Pluto, Saturn, and
Mars (Tarnas 2006). is demonstrates a close con-
nection between socio-political events and dynamics
of archetypes associated with various planets.

e new understanding of the nature of the
archetypes, their symbolism, multivalent mean-
ing, and their mutual interactions and interplay
is essential for the disciplines known as arche-
typal psychology and cosmology. research of
holotropic states has brought strong supportive
evidence for the worldview underlying astrology
(grof 2009). Because of the revolutionary nature
of this understanding of reality, which repre-
sents a serious challenge to the materialistic sci-
entiﬁc worldview and requires a radical change
of our thinking about the nature of reality, it
took me years to realize the extraordinary its
value. over thirty years of cooperation with
richard Tarnas have convinced me that archetyp-
al astrology is an invaluable tool for psychiatry,
psychology, psychotherapy, and especially work
with holotropic states of consciousness. rick has
also demonstrated extraordinary value of this disci-
pline for historical research; in a 30-year tour de
force, he showed systematic correlations between
world planetary transits and historical events (Tarnas
2006). is is a complicated subject and i cannot give
it justice in the limited framework of this paper. i
have to direct interested leaders to literature focusing
speciﬁcally on this area (Tarnas 2006, 2010, 2011, grof
2009, 2012, le grise 2009).

historian arnold Toynbee and mythologist Joseph
campbell noticed that all cultures of the past had been
governed by an underlying myth or a combination of
myths. Toynbee is often quoted for his prediction of the
development of western civilization: “e coming of
Buddhism to the west may well prove to be the most
important event of the twentieth century.” Joseph
campbell used to raise in his lectures the question:
“what are the myths that are driving the western civi-
lization?” he himself emphasized the importance of the
Search for the holy grail myth in its relation to indi-
vidualism characterizing western society: the knights
of the holy grail decided to pursue the search for the
holy chalice on their own. we can also think about
the two major myths of the modern era: Paradise
lost vs. ascent of Man (Tarnas 1993). Equally appro-
priate seem to be the motifs of the abduction and

rape of the feminine, psychospiritual death and
rebirth, and a variety of others – faust, Sorcerer’s
apprentice, frankenstein, Prodigal Son, Tower of
Babel, and others.
Joseph campbell also often asked: what will be the
myth of the future, and he expressed his hope that it
would involve overcoming fragmentation and creat-
ing a planetary civilization. it would be New atlantis,
where people would live in harmony with others and
with nature, beneﬁting from the astonishing discover-
ies of science and technology, but using them with wis-
dom coming from a deep spiritual place. achievement
of this goal would also involve psychospiritual rebirth
and liberation and return of the feminine.
Since we are talking about planetary civilization, i would
like to mention a very interesting observation that seems
very relevant in this regard. one of the most surprising
discoveries in my work with psychedelics and with the
holotropic breathwork was the ease with which individ-
uals in holotropic states of consciousness (including
myself) transcended historical and geographical bound-
aries and experienced archetypal ﬁgures, motifs, and
domains from just about any culture in human histo-
ry. over the years, i have myself have experienced in
my own psychedelic sessions episodes from many dif-
ferent mythologies and religions of the world –
hindu, Buddhist, Tibetan Buddhist, Muslim,
christian, Egyptian, Shinto, australian aboriginal,
Native american, South american, and others.
is has to be a new phenomenon. Many other
cultures had and used powerful consciousness-
expanding technologies, including psychedelic
plants. had the collective unconscious in its
entirety been as easily accessible for them as it
seems to be for modern subjects, we could not
have distinct culture-speciﬁc mythologies. we
have to assume that, for example, the Tibetans
experienced primarily Tibetan deities, and
huichol indians in Mexico, huichol deities.
ere are no descriptions of the Dear Spirit or
grandfather fire in the Bardo ödol or those
of the Dhyani Buddhas in the huichol lore.
it seems that this increased accessibility of vari-
ous domains in the collective unconscious paral-
lels what is happening in the material world.
until the end of the ﬁfteenth century, Euro-
peans did not know anything about the New
world and its inhabitants and vice versa. Many
human groups in remote parts of the world
remained unknown to the rest of the world until
the modern era. Tibet was relatively isolated until
the chinese invasion in 1949. Today telephone,
short-wave radio stations, television, jet travel, and
the internet have dissolved many of the old bound-
aries. let us hope that what is happening in the
inner and the outer world are indications that we are
moving toward a truly global civilization.

conditions for realizing the next-level potential
of human and social evolution. A starting
point for looking at “evolution” is the unend-
ing journey resulting from the “dynamic
interplay of the passive and the creative polariza-
tions of the Absolute that unfolds itself into the
energetic process of diﬀerentiation bringing forth
the whole of creation1.” e evolutionary process
actually continues through cycles of diﬀerentia-
tion, then integration, at a higher level. 
We are on the threshold of a new cycle of the spi-
ral, the spiral of consciousness. e previous
cycles, archaic, magic, mythic, modern and post-
modern consciousness served us well by leading
us so far. however, becoming stuck with them is
becoming stuck with an existential threat of
intertwining global crises that cannot be solved
at the currently dominant modern and post-
modern levels. e next cycle is the one of an
integral, holistic consciousness that enables the
integration of the inner and outer technologies
and sciences, deep intuition and systems think-
ing, spirituality and precision of inquiry.
In this essay I explore some of themes that are core
to our move into the next cycle, such as, collective
intelligence, collective sentience, evolutionary
guidance systems, integral and shared mindfulness.

e ﬁrst sciences arising with agriculture started dis-
tinguishing themselves from intuition, imagination,
and other inner ways of knowing, during the dawn
of human civilization. In the ensuing millennia,
the separation and diﬀerentiation both between
and within scientiﬁc and spiritual practices
(reﬂecting the division of labour in the material
domain) contributed to the spontaneous evolu-
tion of consciousness and culture.
“We are the product of the process of evolu-
tion, and […] we have become the process
itself, through the emergence and evolution of
our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity
to imagine and anticipate the future, and to
choose from among alternatives2.”
Spontaneous, unguided social evolution develops
powerful forces of science and technology, but
not a just social system, where all can beneﬁt from
their fruits. e development of those forces, in
the conditions of private expropriations of the
fruits of humankind’s general intellect, is raising the
risk of systems-wide cataclysms due to the galloping
complexity of our intertwining, global messes. at’s
the moment in human history, when the useful life-
cycle of blind, unguided evolution ends in a global
problematique, unmanageable at the level of social
organization and consciousness that created it.
“To date, evolution on Earth has moved along its trajec-
tory of its own accord. But it will not progress beyond
this point unless it is driven forward intentionally. Evolu-
tion will continue to advance on this planet only if cer-
tain conditions are met: humanity will need to awaken to
the fact that we are living in the midst of a meaningful
and directional evolutionary process, realize that the
continued success of the process depends on us, and
commit to intentionally moving the process forward3.”
At this juncture, blind evolution must yield to con-
scious, intentional evolution if we are to pass the chasm
from humanity’s prehistory, where we could live with
the false sense of separate self, to its real history that
starts when (out of a sense of recognized prior unity)
we reinvent our ways to organize toward maximizing
the well-being of the Whole and all of its parts. 
is essay is intended to make a modest contribu-
tion to some of the signposts of that reinvention,
and to spark a collaborative, action inquiry into it.

Mindfulness, especially shared mindfulness, is an
essential doorway to the collective intelligence and
action required to re-orient where we want to go as a
society. “Mindfulness” here refers not to its popular,
“stress-reduction” meaning, but to a discipline of
training our attention and intention to foster wise
action grounded in compassion with self and others.
“Mindfulness is not merely a compartmentalized tool
for enhancing attention but is informed and inﬂuenced
by many other factors – our view of reality; the nature
of our thoughts, speech, and actions; our way of mak-
ing a living; and our eﬀort in avoiding unwholesome
and unskilful states while developing those that are
skilful and conducive to health and harmony4.”
Without an ethical foundation grounded in the com-
mon good and an integral, evolutionary worldview, the
currently trending mindfulness practices and trainings
risk reducing a radical, ancient wisdom tradition of
self-knowledge and self-transformation to a self-help
technique or psychological state readily co-optable by
the defenders of the institutional status quo.
To distinguish mindfulness engaged with the ethical
challenges of our times from the escapist, “McMind-
fulness” version, I call the ﬁrst “integral mindfulness”.
Integral mindfulness is taking mindfulness oﬀ the
meditation cushion and infusing all dimensions of
our life with it; not only the life of you and me, but
also of collective entities, such as organizations, net-
works, cities or nations. your being mindful inte-
grally may contribute also to the mindful develop-
ment of the cultures and structures you’re in.
Showing up mindfully in a group may have
“contagious” impact. is story illustrates it.
Sometime in the 80s, I was sitting in a leader-
ship team meeting convened by my client, a Vp
in a major Silicon Valley company. at was
before google introduced the idea of relaxed,
cool workplaces; all businesses in the high-tech
industry were pressure cookers: high speed, fast
talk, never enough time for a heartfelt, deeply
meaningful conversation about questions that
mattered to the members. My client’s company
was not an exception. yet, in that meeting,
there was an atmosphere of ancient mystery
school; silence frequently following statements
to give enough time to absorb their implications,
people not cutting into each other’s words, and
genuine curiosity for each other’s concerns and
contributions. later I learned that the Vp was an
advanced Buddhist meditator, but he never men-
tioned that in his team. people just picked up the
vibes and enjoyed it.
What is novel about “Integral Mindfulness” is
the shift of focus from the snapshot-like, static
quadrants of the regular integral matrix to the
dynamic interactions in the overlaps of the four
spheres. for example, let’s see what is happening
in the overlap and transitions between the indi-
vidual and communal spheres.
Both collective intelligence and “shared mindful-
ness” start within (following the pattern of the We-
space that starts with We-in-the-I5.) I am already
participating in shared mindfulness, when I prepar-
ing to enter that shared space (physical or virtual) of
heightened, collective awareness. It’s a moment of
solo practice of cantering and welcoming what will
come, shared by many of the other members of the
community. Some participants in our Mindful Togeth-
er community described their experience as follows: 
“for me stepping into this virtual intimate collective
space is new muscle – its like swimming in the sea,
which I love but there’s always a little resistance on ﬁrst
feel of the cold water but once I’m in – I’m loving it
again but that is now an established practice. What I am
observing is this habit of being used to being in our
own separate bubble – the comfort of the sofa that we
know and getting out of it always calls for a little push
against the reﬂexive resistance to a minor change in
habit. Coming together like this in a deeper shared col-
lective space is a new muscle that needs exercising to
work well and being mindful of our lack of
ﬁtness/resistance is a start. however once you are in
and like the ocean, you feel carried or elevated by
ﬁeld between us6.”
If all start paying attention to their inner experience
already in the preparation for entering the circle,

that attitude will be conducive to the emergence of
a potent inter-subjective ﬁeld of “shared mindful-
ness” allowing us to sense what is happening more
accurately, think more clearly, act more coherently,
and achieve greater collective results.

Instead of talking about, can we talk from and to mind-
fulness? from mine to yours, from yours to mine? Sep-
arated by time and space, but connected by a shared
curiosity, we can choose to bring our attention to what
is happening in this inter-subjective exchange between
us right here on this page.
don’t think that your part is merely passive here. I
exist because of you, in the sense that my thoughts are
coming from the felt sense of our communication
because I know that you’re there and curious. anks
to the gifts of modern communication technologies,
you can also add your voice and describe your end
of the experience. So, how is it when you read an
essay with your body, allowing half of your atten-
tion to rest on the pattern of your breathing, while
absorbing the words reaching you? (at’s how
I’m writing to prevent these heady subjects from
coming only from my head.)
When two or more people are gifting their con-
versation and their inter-personal relationship
with an intentional, choiceful attention, the
space created between them becomes a space of
shared mindfulness, regardless whether it is
mediated by a physical or virtual space. Such a
practice fosters a deeper sense of connection
and adds more presence and signiﬁcance to the
experience of each participant.
Communities of mindfulness practice engaged
in shared inquiry and joint discovery have
been favoured places of accelerated personal
and spiritual development throughout the cen-
turies. Enhanced with today’s communications
technologies, they can make the shared experi-
ence and insights just one click away from their
members, as shown by the practice of many
online communities of inner development.
Inter-subjective or shared mindfulness is one of the
inter-disciplinary ﬁelds where outer and inner sci-
ences started meeting. ere’s a growing number of
ﬁrst-person descriptions not only of various medita-
tive states and the practices to reach them, but also of
diﬀerent paths to inter-subjective mindfulness,
labelled for instance, “Insight dialogue,” “Transpar-
ent Communications,” “Magic in the Middle,”
“Evolutionary dialogue,” “Chaordic Chat,” “Col-
lective presencing,” “We-space” approaches, etc.
let’s take a closer look at some of these practices.

“is practice starts by breaking the habit of giv-
ing and receiving immediate response in real-
time conversations, texting, on skype or on the
phone. It gives access to a fuller intelligence of
the parties in communication. When we take
any insight, a striking inspiration, or a special
resonance between possibilities, into the focus
of our non-judgmental observing and contem-
plating them, then we can access a deeper intu-
ition. giving room to such contemplation,
before moving to expression, is a gift to the con-
versation’s highest potential7.”
When groups of people are engaged in this prac-
tice something remarkable happens. As Viktor l
frank stated: “Between stimulus and response
there is a space. In that space is our power to
choose our response. In our response lies our
growth and our freedom.” When all participants
in a multiparty exchange listen and respond from
that spaciousness, the resulting shared freedom
opens the doors to breakthrough possibilities in
whatever domain of collective action.

“e magic in the middle begins with a shift in aware-
ness, from parts to relations between parts. Imagine a
circle of people in conversation. When we are interest-
ed in understanding the processes that take place in the
conversation, we can pay attention to the individual in
the circle, to the circle as a whole (group or team), or to
the relations between the participants. All three realities
coexist at once, but we can choose to let one of them
come in the foreground.
“To pay attention to the ﬁeld of relations is not the
same as paying attention to the whole. e parts are
still important. e whole is still important. But we are
particularly interested in what goes on in the interac-
tion between the parts, and let that reality come in the
foreground8.” is approach has nine distinct prac-
tices outlined in more depth in the article referenced.

Collective presencing but takes them to a new
dimension. It allows us to tune in with the inner
experience of each other, simultaneously being pre-
sent to our own reality, the reality of the other and
the inter-personal ﬁeld of energy and meaning. 
ese are some of the injunctions that make this
form of shared mindfulness possible:
~  Speak always from the now;
~  Continuously widen your perception of subtle
energies;
~  Keep the space of relationship always open, i.e in
any context, independently of the contents of the
conversation, don’t contract but stay consciously
connected even through feelings of unease or pain;
~  respect the diﬀerent inner experiences of others
even if you may not personally share them.
Transparent Communication is a competence people
can cultivate and become better at. at is happening
in TC practice groups around the world9.
ere are also a growing number of “outer science”
approaches to shared mindfulness, scientiﬁcally study-
ing it as a measurable object, without necessarily tak-
ing into account the scientist’s direct experience of it.

“e cultural value of respeto may also con-
tribute to Intersubjectivity in some communi-
ties; unlike the English deﬁnition of ‘respect,’
respeto refers loosely to a mutual consideration
for others’ activities, needs, wants, etc. Similar
to ‘putting yourself in one’s shoes’ the preva-
lence of respeto in certain Indigenous Ameri-
can communities in Mexico and South Ameri-
ca may promote Intersubjectivity as persons act

eration for the community or the individual’s
current needs or state of mind.” (Wkipedia).

dr. dan Siegel, psychiatrist and author of several
books on interpersonal neurobiology, emphasizes
that the mind is a relational, “self-organizational
emergent process that is arising as energy and
information ﬂows not just in the body, certainly
not just in the skull, throughout the body, but
also as it’s shared between people and among
people and even with the planet. is sharing we
call relational, this embodied relational process
is self-organizing10.”
As we understand mind and language, they are
relational, inter-subjective processes that in
their everyday use, are not recognized as such.
understanding each other’s meaning-making
tools and frameworks, inner and outer scien-
tists working together can make a greater dif-
ference for the sake of the common good than
each can alone. dan Siegel’s insight points in
that direction: “I think there’s a moment in
cultural evolution where people, on a grassroots
level, can be empowered to learn how to focus
their minds in a way that strengthens how the
mind works, integrates the brain, and creates
kinder relationships, both with other people and
also with themselves11.”
Can that moment in cultural evolution be now?
When an interpersonal neurobiologist calls for
massive empowerment by focusing our minds in
a way that creates kinder relationships, it’s also an
invitation to practitioners of other disciplines to
bring the gifts of their own arts to the same. It
challenges us to complement our in-the-moment
practices of shared mindfulness with the practices of
sustainable, mindful relationships.

If mindfulness refers to keeping one’s consciousness
alive to the present reality, and biofeedback is a process
of gaining greater awareness of various physiological
functions, including one’s brainwaves, then their mar-
riage was made in heaven, using instruments that feed
back real-time information to the user. “e presenta-
tion of this information – often in conjunction with
changes in thinking, emotions, and behaviour – supports
desired physiological changes. over time, these changes
can endure without continued use of an instrument12.”
promoters of biofeedback-enhanced mindfulness prac-
tices and games claim that you can’t improve what you
can’t measure. e seed of truth in that exaggerated state-
ment is that real-time feedback assessing one’s depth of
meditative state can contribute to its further deepening.
e potential of group biofeedback for shared mindful-
ness didn’t get lost on biofeedback scientists studying
heart rate Variability (also known as heart rate
Coherence). users of certain biofeedback equipment
can obtain real-time feedback about their “synchrony,

the time lag between the peak of the breath and the
peak of the heart wave, around the end of the inhala-
tion. e more closely the breath and heart wave are
‘in sync’, the lower the synchrony13.”
e following work-in-progress project run by a pro-
fessor at the university of California, Santa Barbara,
sketches out a path to individual synchrony states get-
ting connected and scaling up in larger groups.
“pulse is a distributed collective biofeedback system that
aims to synchronize the heartbeats of its participants […]
e pulse rate is continuously collected from people, who
choose to participate using a wearable device (optimally a
ubiquitous device such as an ipod or cell phone). e
pulse rate is transmitted via a wireless network to a com-
puter. e computer calculates the average pulse rate and
transmits it to the participants as a single beat sound
played in the same device that recorded and transmitted
the heartbeat […] pulse aims to create a tangible experi-
ence of the relationship between individual entities and
the networks they form and act within14.”
Biofeedback is still rarely used in collective settings for
examining and creating connections between partici-
pants. Synchronized heartbeats may induce a subjec-
tive experience of increased connection. relational
closeness doesn’t automatically leads to shared inte-
gral mindfulness that also has an ethical component.
Enabling technologies are getting more and more
sophisticated and commonly available. e state of
consciousness necessary for human groups to make
the best use of them is lagging way behind. When
completed, the pulse would let participants
become aware of their shared heartbeat. however,
unless their culture has shared purpose and values
and an attitude of striving for competence in
some inner technologies, then it is unlikely that
the outer technology of biofeedback can deliver
on its potential for fostering shared, integral
mindfulness. 
at brings us back to the role of the teachers
and practitioners of inner sciences, and also
brings us forward to examine collective intelli-
gence and sentience.

Becoming mindful of how our moment-to-
moment experience is shaped by the social rela-
tions in which we participate is not enough.
e challenge and opportunity of socially engaged
meditators is to not only experience our social
world mindfully, but help it evolve beyond the
limitations imposed on it by outdated socio-eco-
nomic system. none of us can do it alone; for
that, we need to mobilize and augment our collec-
tive intelligence.
Collective intelligence is an emergent capacity of
social groups (of any size), which enables them to
evolve towards higher-order harmony and com-
plexity, through such innovation mechanisms as
diﬀerentiation and integration. 
of course, that is only one of the many deﬁni-
tions of CI. at one is seen through the “evolu-
tionary” lens and diﬀers from the “wisdom of
crowd”-type CI and, possibly, from some other
deﬁnitions used in this issue of the journal. e
emphasis on emergent quality distinguishes it
from “additive CI” that merely states, “two
minds are better than one.”
at evolutionary lens is complementary to a
cognitive lens through which CI can be seen as
follows: “Intelligence refers to the main cognitive
powers: perception, action planning and coordi-
nation, memory, imagination and hypothesis
generation, inquisitiveness and learning abilities.
e expression ‘collective intelligence’ designates
the cognitive powers of a group15.”
I introduced what CI might look like through
important lenses of political economy and infor-
mation technology here16, which I don’t elaborate
on in this essay due to space limitations. 
What we perceive as practical applications and
implications of CI diﬀer also according to whether
we look from an intra-personal, inter-personal, or
transpersonal perspective. let’s explore CI in those
three dimensions.

We are part of a vast web of collective intelligence and
it is part of each of us because we are products of the
evolving intelligence of life itself. not to mention our
ancestors in the mineral, plant, and animal kingdoms,
we are products of many millennia of social evolution.
We couldn’t have language, tools, not even our most
intimate thoughts and feelings, without the long jour-
ney of CI in humankind’s history.
given that, we might do well to ask ourselves: how
does CI manifest in myself? What is my collective IQ (C-
IQ) and how could I boost it?
I ﬁrst asked those questions in a presentation I gave at
the university of ottawa in 2004, using a 6-pole model
of CI developed by pierre lévy for discerning and
assessing the main CI resources an individual or a col-
lective has.

e top half of the diagram represents the three vir-
tual resources of CI and the bottom half its three
physical resources. Extrapolating that the intelli-
gence potential of a biological organism increases
with the number of connections among the cells
in their nervous system, I suggest that the C-IQ of
a social being (individual or collective) is propor-
tionate with the level of connectivity within and
across of the 6 CI pictured above. Below are 6
examples of what the increased connectivity
within the 6-pole resources of CI may mean.
1 ~  e permanent inner chatter of the mind,
with its frequent jumps to unrelated thoughts,
creates a disjoint series of only loosely-con-
nected reﬂections. We can grow higher coher-
ence in that chatter by practicing contempla-
tion, meditation, and visualization of our
mental models. growing competence in any
of those arts will boost our C-IQ. e practical
value of the capacity to maintain a more
coherent inner discourse cannot be overstated.
2 ~  If my intentions are driven by a rowdy
bunch of competing desires and ambitions,
then my C-IQ, the capacity to co-evolve with
others towards higher harmony and complexity,
will be compromised. Correspondingly, if my
intentions are aligned and oriented by the evolu-
tionary value of continually upgrading my con-
sciousness, compassion, and capacity to absorb
more complexity, then chances are, my C-IQ will
be even higher.
3 ~  humans may not swim as swiftly as dol-
phins or run as fast as gazelles but we have a
repertory of competences far richer than other
species. our intellectual competences, such as mem-
ory, sensing, discerning, intuiting, etc. are all relat-
ed with each other. Exploring the nature of their
complex interdependences, one can ﬁnd the sweet-
spot of interdependence among all those capabilities.
Most likely, it will be the one with the biggest inﬂu-
ence on coherence within the ecosystem of those
capabilities.
4 ~  our document networks and personal knowledge
ecosystems provide us with the many gifts of recorded
memory, including the opportunity to examine and
increase the coherence of our mental models. how well
our personal knowledge gardens are tended has a huge
impact on everyone’s C-IQ.
5 ~  e wider and more diverse is my people network
of trusted relationships, the more connected I am with
a larger variety of life experiences and perspectives on
reality. A web of mutually supportive relationships is
also a booster of my C-IQ.
6 ~  finally, the technical network supports all the 5
other poles of CI -in-me, by putting at the disposal of
each of us a wide array of enabling technologies, e.g.:
massive and miniaturized memory storage, two-way
and communal high-speed connection with the
Web, and much more. All of that can be connected
in conﬁgurations optimized for supporting and
augmenting CI -in-me.

fIgurE 2 ~ Pierre Lévy’s diagram quoted in Social Software and CI?17.

now, let’s envision widening the scope of our
exploration of how to increase the connection not
only within, but also across the 6 poles. for example,
what if we could turbo-charge the creative potential
of value ﬂowing from our reﬂections to our enabling
technologies and vice versa? Imagine, what could it
enable and make possible?
e circular ﬂow of information and energy between
our intentions, recorded memories, and trusted relation-
ships is another key factor of C-IQ. e vitality of that
inner ﬂow decides the breadth and speed of access to
the collective mind, which comes in handy when we
need to mobilize that access for meeting the key chal-
lenge or opportunity at (our individual or collective)
hand. e elegant beauty of the 6-pole model of CI is its
scalability from individuals to small and large groups.

When each of us observes patterns of interest in what
we pay attention to, in a communal or organizational
setting, and share them with other members, we sow
the seeds for collective self-reﬂexivity to sprout. It is a
capacity of human groups to reﬂect upon the con-
tent of their collective sensing and meaning-making.
for a collective entity to become a fully co-intelli-
gent living organism, it needs to gain competence in
the arts of collective self-reﬂection (CS-r), including
proﬁciency in building and using collective sensing
organs. e latter can include collaborative blogs,
wikis, and sensing and meaning-making practices
in face-to-face and online group events.
Well-tended collective self-reﬂexivity can lead to
a more ﬁne-tuned sensing of reality, more
attuned and agile collaborative meaning-making
processes, thus, higher C-IQ and wiser action. 
“Within 10 to 20 years, the human family will
have in place the communications infrastructure
that could support a quantum increase in the
collective intelligence – and the collective con-
sciousness – of the species18.” If duane Elgin’s
epiphany is to come true, epochal shifts will
happen in the next year. In fact, we are already
in the midst of some of them; we just don’t
know their likely outcomes. To enable the best
outcome of those shifts, organizations, groups,
and other collective entities need to build capaci-
ty for cultivating their collective self-reﬂexivity.
In conversations on the “how” of CS-r, a fre-
quently recurring question is: “But will it scale?”
here are two other questions that may be more
practical: What is needed for enabling CS-r in
groups of increasing scale? how to optimize the
initial conditions of its collective dnA for continu-
ally updating itself? 
Some insight about those questions can be
gleaned from the three principles of the Master
Code of the human hive19. ose principles are;
Take Care of yourself, Take Care of Each other,
Take Care of is place”. (It’s remarkable those
principles and the associated practices were pio-
neered by high school students in Canada.)
Taking care of each other and this place/organ-
isation/planet wouldn’t be possible without
becoming ever better at practicing collective
self-reﬂexivity. 
I also keep hearing the question: when to exer-
cise CS-r? Any moment when a community is
facing critical challenges or opportunities is a
good moment for exercising its “collective self-
reﬂexivity” muscles. how well-performing
those muscles will be at those hot moments
depends on how well-trained they are.

I frequently email a tweet I stumble upon in my
tweet stream to friends, family, colleagues, and
clients, if I know that it reﬂects one of their inter-
ests, or I tag them in a thread on facebook, letting
the system alert them to it.
at’s because nobody can spend all the time in the
stream, yet staying current with what is unfolding in
cyberspace around issues of priority interest is a need of
more and more people. Subscription services may help
a little but we risk creating the notorious “ﬁlter bubble,”
ﬁltering out everything we didn’t know how to ask for.
e good news is that the larger the circle of friends
who care for us, the better the chances that we can stay
informed of not just 0.5% but maybe 1% of what we
need to know to stay current. no keyword-based ﬁlter-
ing system comes close in eﬀectiveness to a network of
humans in mutually supportive relationships, where
they act as “organic” sensors for each other.
relying on an intuited map of resonances, which shows
the intersections and adjacent areas between my own
topics of interest and those of my friends, I send the
gems I pick up on my surfpath. What makes me an
“organic” sensor is that unlike most algorithm-based
ﬁlters, I read their feedback so the excitement that my
pointer has (or hasn’t) generated, informs and moti-
vates me to reﬁne my catch-and-forward strategy.

by saying: “I am always grateful for hints and links
of friends who think that can be useful for my work
and/or development. at’s what friends are for.”
pamela Mclean wrote there: “We can do our own
practical learning-by-doing, and reﬂection and then
connect in conversations, on topics of overlapping
interest, which are enriched by our diﬀerent perspec-
tives. We can share information, exchange questions,
gain insights and possibly create new knowledge togeth-
er. anks to the Internet we can do all that without
needing to travel to international conferences or being
part of formal professional bodies. We are gradually dis-
covering how we can be part of a world-wide shared-
learning-and thinking community.”
Comments from them and others who joined our con-
versation across space and time, made clearer for me
that while “friends are doing what they are for,” some-
thing else is also happening, unbeknownst to them.
patterns of connections are getting generated in the
global brain, and maybe even the trust and intelligence
ﬂowing through them can reach wider and deeper. 
e most inﬂuential nodes in that brain are not indi-
vidual humans, but the various kinds of glocal-scale21
learning and thinking communities, particularly,
communities of practice and epistemic communities1
organized around various domains of knowledge.
“neurons that ﬁre together, wire together” seems to
be true not only for our brain’s neural processes,
but also for the global brain. If so, we can be sen-
sors not only for each other, but for collective
intelligence itself, letting it use us for organizing
itself, by increasing the neural connections inside
and among our communities. We let it use us,
when with some new, valuable information at
hand, we’re wondering, who else can beneﬁt
from this info?
helen Titchen Beeth, another commenter of
this blogpost further reﬁned the “organic sensor”
position, writing about “practicing what you
plead for here: that collective curation and skil-
ful sifting for potent nuggets of meaning that
can bond with other nuggets to create novel
compounds and – who knows – even new life-
forms! A small inner voice said ‘you could do
that for this conversation’ – and then a deeper
knowing said ‘no, this one is not for you… or
not yet/now’. Which adds another coloured
thread to our weave: ere’s more to this than
just relationships between nodes. It is as if we are
each rooted in our unique place in the Kosmos
and can learn to hear feedback directly from ‘the
source’ about what is uniquely ours to do22.”
Titchen Beeth’s point about orienting her choices
by a sense of what is uniquely hers to do rhymes
with my own sense of how the selection of topics
we attend to is the precise place where our own
life journey and the journey of our self-organizing
social mind meet. If I gain some clarity about the
particular question to which my particular
life/journey is the answer, it will inform the
kind of memes/topics to which I attend.
Many other interesting things are also happen-
ing at the same time, in that very same act of
letting certain issues attract us to curate them
(for self and others). for example:
~  Trails of hyperlinks between groups, issues,
memes, are being built and travelled, giving
rise to new perspectives that emerge from the
pathways connecting them.
~  Some emergent areas of our distributed
mind are gaining more attention.
~  Some practices and principles of participatory
epistemology23 and liberating epistemology24
start appearing.
I think what makes all those synchronously
occurring trends possible is that “content cura-
tion is the natural evolution of our globally net-
worked consciousness.”  e author then says:
“is sounds like a bunch of hippie drivel, but we
really are creating a global brain, of sorts, by encod-
ing human knowledge and tracking human activity.
using the human nodes of this network to strength-
en some of these connections while weakening others
(by choosing either to pass along i.e., ‘curate’ infor-
mation or not to pass it along) helps this global brain
function better as a system, which in turn increases its
power whenever any of us need to tap into it25.”
I couldn’t have said it any better. of course, it’s not only
the global brain functions better thanks to our active and
conscious participation; our individual brain does too. It’s
very plausible that the global brain is increasing its power
whenever any of us engages with it. But an even bigger
game-changer on humanity’s evolutionary journey is:  A
fully functional global brain, with all its advanced aﬀor-
dances, will enable us to bring its resources to bear on
meeting individual and collective needs of the multi-
tudes, only the few. at will open the possibility for
humankind to awaken to its collective sentience.

Are you sentient? you wouldn’t doubt that. how
about an animal, a bacteria, or a plant? Sentience is
not a binary concept. An entity is not either sentient
or not. e meaning of the “sentience” distinction

and feeling, to being sensitive and responsive to the
vital needs of its parts and its whole. for current
purpose, I use the latter meaning.
Another description of sentience comes from the
Buddhist tradition. “Sentience seems to be character-
ized by awareness and care. is is sentience as under-
stood by Buddhists and others who talk about sen-
tient beings. Such sentient awareness is basically open-
ness, space, within which things discriminate them-
selves. And that openness is characterized by compas-
sion […] we feel a kinship with sentient beings […]”26.
Collective sentience is not exclusive to humans; we ﬁnd
it in a school of ﬁsh that can turn on dime, or a troop of
baboons protecting collectively their babies in face of
external aggression, or the forager bees following the pat-
tern of the swarm’s waggle dance to ﬁnd key resources.
e development of language and increasingly complex
communication tools in human groups and society gave
rise to a new dimension of collective sentience: the
capacity to care for the well-being and evolution of the
species itself, as well as its habitat, its larger encompass-
ing whole. We see an early, limited manifestation of
that capacity, when the human family gathers bringing
aid to disaster victims.
higher levels of collective sentience may be charac-
terized by: 
~  the human species bringing to bear the fruits
of our collective intelligence on urgent chal-
lenges;
~  the eradication of war and other forms of
man-made suﬀering;
~  and ultimately, the development of an evo-
lutionary guidance system27 for spaceship
Earth.
given that evolution is an open and emergent
process, Banathy’s concept of “evolutionary guid-
ance system,” and the “intentional evolution”
that I wrote about in the context-setting session
of this article, do not imply some sort of social
engineering. In both cases, we are talking about
self-guided evolution, in which collective entities,
including the human society as a whole, cease
seeing themselves as only objects to/through
which evolution just happens, and start recogniz-
ing that they have choices about its unfolding. 
Evolution’s arrow points to higher complexity
and harmony, but the process doesn’t advance
in a straight line; it can move through detours
and even fall back to previous stages, at tremen-
dous human cost. hence the importance of
reaching higher levels of our collective sentience.
e aspiration for that is an integral part of an
evolutionary ethos of moving towards higher-
order harmony. given the dominance of today’s
individualist culture, its realization is only one of
the possible futures.

inking about sentient humanity, the slowly
emerging planetary meta-being, I wrote last year:
“for it to be viable, its collective mind needs to
be joined by a collective heart, consciousness
plus compassion. at will start a new leg of the
human family’s learning journey: the era of the
species-being’s collective sentience28.”
Quora is one of the engines of our global-scale
collective intelligence, or to put it in more spe-
ciﬁc terms, “Quora is a question-and-answer
website where questions are created, answered,
edited and organized by its community of users.
Quora aggregates questions and answers to top-
ics. users can collaborate by editing questions
and suggesting edits to other users’ answers.”
(Wikipeda) 
I decided to run a small experiment for using a
tool of collective intelligence to explore an aspect
of collective sentience. I asked this question on
Quora: “e metabeing cannot come alive before
having a global brain And heart. What will do the
same for the new civilization what the heart does
for the body?” e question received a number of
thoughtful responses, from which I quote one:
“is question is best answered by analogies about
function, not anatomy.  e heart is a metaphor for
functions of the entire organism that go far beyond the
physical heart’s mechanical interpretation as a pumping
device.   Brain and heart are physical structures that
symbolize two diﬀerent but not really separate, styles of
intelligence conventionally called ‘thinking’ and ‘feeling’.
e brain is considered the seat of thinking, and the
heart is considered the seat of feeling and emotion […]
What function(s) do heart and emotion serve in individ-
ual humans, and what might accomplish analogous func-
tions in the collective meta-being? e ‘heart’ has at least
the following functions (the many meanings of which are
suggested by common idioms using “heart”). ese are
‘design aﬀordances’ for the ‘global heart’:
~  distribution of energy and nutrients;
~  rhythm, pacing, and coherence;
~  Sense of central unity, for self and towards others;
~  relationality and social attunement;
~  Excitement and motivation, vitality;
~  hope, courage, and intention;
~  Assessment of what is worth doing”29. 
I took that long quote because I like both the depth
of that reply to my question and the playful spirit
suggesting that the list of functions are ‘design

aﬀordances’ for the ‘global heart’. It’s fascinating
just to think about how the global heart would be
“designed” if it were optimized for those aﬀordances.
Who are the designers and is there an identiﬁable
design process? Clearly, anything as complex as the
“global heart,” which seems more of a process than a
“thing”, cannot be designed; it can only emerge from
favourable conditions. 
nevertheless, those conditions can be and are being
promoted by trailblazing “We-space communities”30,
Circles of presence31, and other groups where members
hold and support each other in their highest potential.
e injunctions and practices used in those groups,
worth replicating, deserve a well-resourced collaborative
learning expedition to the tip of the evolutionary wave. 
Collective sentience at increasing scale will emerge
when communities and organizations start learning to
sense, think, and act from the biggest “We” that they
can put their arms around.

e ﬁrst outline of this essay was much more
expansive than I ended up writing. It had a num-
ber of sections that didn’t make it into what
you’ve just read, including important topics, like
collective consciousness, we-space, collective wis-
dom, and various approaches for augmenting
them. e plan felt like the pilot for a book I
always wanted to write. 
Around the turn of the year, I went on a two-
week writing retreat on a mountain in the middle
of an awe-inspiring national park of Catalonia. I
was looking forward to it for months but when
the time came, I had a nasty and persistent cold.
nursing myself back to health took most of my
ﬁrst week, leaving very little energy for writing.
When I was down to my last ﬁve days of the
retreat, I noticed how much I grew attached to
the original plans for the article, which by now,
given the shortness of time left, became impos-
sible to pursue. at noticing rang a mindful-
ness bell inside my head, which shifted my rela-
tionship to the process of pulling the pieces of
this essay together. It shifted the restricting feel-
ing of performing to a scope anticipated months
ago into the joy of writing from the living centres
of what is true and most alive for me now, and
trusting that their inner coherence would some-
how manifest in the outer coherence of what was
produced in those ﬁve days.
It was like some kind of mental congestion got
removed by changing the direction of the writing
process from outside-in to inside-out. I am grate-
ful to all readers for that shift because it was our
shared mindfulness, collective intelligence, and
collective sentience that made it possible. let
me explain.
Writing is communing, a passage of the chasm
from me to we. you’ve been present with me
in creating this essay, in all the choices I made
about it, including the shift in my attitude
about the writing process I mentioned above.
your voice inside me made it clear that what’s
important is not how complete the story is,
but how authentically it is poured forth from
my passion, because only then can it connect
with yours. 
e presence of collective intelligence of the
Spanda ecosystem also helped me letting go of
the anxiousness about the imperfections and
blemishes due to the shrinking time left to
complete the article. When the writing is alive
and generative, the writer creates only the ﬁrst
draft; the readers produce the next. given the
aﬀordances of the digital media, we might just
make this a reality.
finally, a word about our collective sentience, our
caring for a possible better world, which connects
us. As you were reading certain passages, your car-
ing has probably evoked both some resonances in
your heart and new questions in your mind. our
collective sentience can be summed up in the ques-
tion: What are we willing to do for each other and
the ﬁeld that holds us? Will you share with the other
readers and me your questions, concerns, apprecia-
tions, whatever can take this inquiry forward?

organisms and brains as complex adaptive
systems1. is means that they consist of
a vast number of relatively autonomous
agents (such as cells, neurons or individ-
uals) that interact locally via a variety of chan-
nels. out of these non-linear interactions, some
form of coherent, coordinated activity emerges
– a phenomenon known as self-organization2.
e resulting organization is truly distributed
over the components of the system: it is not
localized, centralized or directed by one or a few
agents, but arises out of the interconnections
between all the agents. 
e present paper will focus on the distributed
intelligence3 of such a self-organizing system,
because this is what most fundamentally distin-
guishes the new paradigm from the older paradigm,
which sees problem solving and decision making as
centralized, sequential processes. We will deﬁne
intelligence as: the ability to process information so as
to eﬃciently solve problems and exploit opportu-
nities. What are considered problems, opportuni-
ties – or more generally challenges – will depend
on the goals and values of the decision-maker,
who can be an individual organism, an organiza-
tion, or the global superorganism4. Eﬃciently
dealing with a challenge means selecting and per-
forming the right actions that solve the problem
or exploit the opportunity.
Traditional models of intelligence in cognitive
science and artiﬁcial intelligence see the process of
problem solving as a search through a space of
potential solutions. e attempts to simulate the
neural networks used by our brain, however, led to
the notion of parallel, distributed processing of
information5. e idea is that diﬀerent units or
“neurons” deal simultaneously with diﬀerent aspects
of the problem or question. In other words, the
problem is split up into aspects that are processed by
several autonomous agents (active units) working in
parallel, without central supervision or direction.
eir contributions are then reassembled or aggregat-
ed into a collective solution. 
A fundamental advantage of this approach is ﬂexibili-
ty and robustness. e many contributions ensure
redundancy of function: individual units may be
unavailable, produce erroneous results, or lack relevant
data, but the resulting errors tend to be compensated by
the signals coming from the other units, so that the
aggregate result normally is informative – even in the
most confused situations. In a centralized, sequential
process, on the other hand, a single malfunction along
the line can be suﬃcient to throw everything oﬀ-course,
so that no useful result is produced. 
e same mechanism of compensating for individual
ignorance or bias by aggregating a large variety of contri-
butions characterizes successful applications of collective
intelligence6. But in typical social systems, distributed
intelligence is more than collective intelligence: contribu-
tions do not only come from the people in a collective,
but from a variety of artefacts, tools and technologies
that sense, register, store, process or transfer informa-
tion. is is the perspective of distributed cognition,
originally proposed by the ethnographer hutchins7. In
real-world problem solving, we routinely rely on tools
such as pen and paper, maps, cameras, telephones and
calculators to gather and process information. We
also rely on other people to provide us with their

OF DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AND THE GLOBAL BRAIN

unique observations, skills or ideas. for a complex sys-
tem – e.g., a navy ship8 – to function well, all the peo-
ple and artefacts involved need to work together in a
coordinated manner, by sending the right messages at
the right moments to the right destinations.
is paper wishes to introduce a new paradigm,
challenge propagation, which synthesizes my older
work on spreading activation in individual and col-
lective intelligence9, and my more recent ontology of
action10. e basic idea is to combine the notion of
“challenge”, which is deﬁned in the action ontology
as a phenomenon that elicits action from an agent,
with the notion of “propagation” or “spreading”,
which comes from models of neural networks,
memetics11, and complex systems, and which
denotes the process by which some phenomenon
is iteratively transmitted from a point in a node
in a network to the neighbouring nodes. 
e intention of this work is to provide a con-
ceptual and mathematical foundation for a new
theory of the Global Brain12, which is deﬁned as
the distributed intelligence emerging from all
people and machines as connected by the Inter-
net. however, the notion of challenge propaga-
tion seems simple and general enough to also
provide a foundation for a theory of distributed
intelligence in general. is includes human
intelligence – which as neural network researchers
have shown is distributed over the billions of neu-
rons in the brain13 –, the collective intelligence of
insects, but also various as yet poorly understood
forms of intelligence in e.g., bacteria14 or plants15.
In fact, I assume that – in contrast to traditional,
sequential models of artiﬁcial intelligence – all forms
of “natural” intelligence are dis-
tributed. is means that they
emerge from the interactions
between a collective of
autonomous components or
“agents” that are working in
parallel. is perspective has
also been called the “society of
mind”16: a mind or intelligence
can be seen a collaboration
between relatively independent
modules or agents. More gener-
ally, intelligence can be viewed
as the capability for coordinat-
ed, organized activity. Exclud-
ing “intelligent design” accounts
– which presuppose the very
intelligence they purport to
explain – this means that intelli-
gence must ultimately be the
result of self-organization17, a
process which typically occurs
in a distributed manner.
Another reason to focus on distributed intelli-
gence is that traditional intelligence models – in
which a well-deﬁned agent solves a well-deﬁned
problem (and then stops) – are completely unreal-
istic for describing complex, adaptive systems, such
as an organization, the Internet, or the brain. In
such systems, everything is “smeared out” across
space, time and agents: it is never fully clear who is
addressing which problem where or when. Many
components contribute simultaneously to many
“problem-solving” processes, and problems are rarely
completely solved: they rather morph into something
diﬀerent. at is why the notion of “problem” will
need to be replaced by the broader notion of “chal-
lenge” and the sequential, localized process of “search”
(for a problem solution) by the parallel, distributed
process of “propagation”.
e diﬃculty, of course, is to represent such a complex, ill-
deﬁned process in a precise, mathematical or computation-
al manner. ere exist already a number of useful para-
digms for doing this, including multi-agent systems, com-
plex dynamic systems, neural networks, and stigmergy18.
e challenge propagation paradigm is intended to synthe-
size the best features of these diﬀerent models. e present
paper will sketch the conceptual foundations that are nec-
essary to build such a model, while leaving the mathemat-
ical development for another paper19.

situation (the initial state), and an ideal or desired sit-
uation (the goal state or solution). problem solving
then means ﬁnding a path through the “problem
space” that leads from the initial state (say, x) to the
goal (say, y)21. is requires determining the right
sequence of steps that leads from x to y (see fIgurE 1).
for non-trivial problems, the number of potential paths
that need to be explored increases exponentially with the
number of steps, so that it quickly becomes astronomi-
cal. for example, if at each stage you have the choice
between 10 possible steps, there will be 10n possible paths
of length n. at makes one trillion for a path of merely
12 steps long! at is why “brute force” approaches (try-
ing out all possible paths in order to ﬁnd the right one) in
general do not work, and need to be complemented by
what we conventionally call “intelligence”.
e more problems an agent can solve, the more intelli-
gent it is. note that this deﬁnition does not provide an
absolute measure of intelligence, as the number of prob-
lems that a non-trivial agent can solve is typically inﬁ-
nite. erefore, counting the number of solvable prob-
lems does not produce the equivalent of an IQ. on the
other hand, the present deﬁnition does produce a par-
tial ordering: an agent A is more intelligent than anoth-
er agent B, if A can solve all problems that B can solve,
and some more. In general, though, A and B are
incomparable, as B may be able to tackle some prob-
lems that A cannot deal with, and vice versa.
e partial order provides us with an unambiguous
criterion of progress: if an agent, by learning, evolu-
tion, or design, manages to solve additional prob-
lems relative to the ones it could deal with before, it
has become objectively more intelligent. natural
selection entails that more intelligent agents will
sooner or later displace less intelligent agents, as
the latter will at some stage be confronted with
problems that they cannot solve, but that the
more intelligent ones can solve. us, the more
intelligent ones have a competitive advantage
over the less intelligent ones. erefore, we may
assume that evolutionary, social, or technological
progress will in general increase intelligence in an
irreversible way. yet, we should remember that
in practice intelligence is highly context-depen-
dent: more important than the absolute number
of problems you can solve, is whether you can
solve the problems that are signiﬁcant for you in
your present situation. Adding the capability to
solve some purely theoretical problems that have
no value in your present or future environment
will in general not increase your ﬁtness (i.e., prob-
ability of long-term survival) – and may even
decrease it if it would make you waste time on con-
templating irrelevant issues.
e simplest model of intelligence is a look-up table
or mapping. is is a list of condition-action rules, of
the form: if your problem is x, then the (action you
need to perform to attain the) solution is y. In
short: if x, then y, or, even shorter: x →y. An
example is the table of multiplication, which lists
rules such as: if your problem is 7 x 7, then the
solution is 49. 
e next, more complex model of intelligence is
a deterministic algorithm. is is a sequence of
actions that need to be performed on the initial
state in a particular order. e sequence is typi-
cally iterated until the state it produces satisﬁes
the condition for being a solution. An example is
a procedure to calculate 734 x 2843 or a program
that determines the ﬁrst 100 prime numbers.
Such deterministic procedures to manipulate
numbers, or more generally, lists of symbols,
have given rise to the notion of intelligence as
computation. 
A deterministic algorithm (like multiplication)
is guaranteed to produce an acceptable solution
after a ﬁnite number of steps. problems that are
more complex do not oﬀer such a guarantee:
trial-and-error will be needed, and, by deﬁnition,
you do not know whether any trial will produce a
solution or an error. In this case, the best you can
hope for is a heuristic: a procedure that suggests
plausible paths towards a solution. heuristics do
not necessarily produce the correct solution: they
merely reduce the amount of search you would have
to perform with respect to a “brute force”, exhaus-
tive exploration of the problem space. e better the
heuristic, the larger the reduction in search and the
higher the probability that you would ﬁnd the solu-
tion after a small number of steps. 
e view of problem solving as computation or as
heuristic search seems to imply a sequential process, in
which the diﬀerent actions are performed one by one in
a central location. A ﬁrst step in our intended general-
ization towards distributed processes is the reinterpreta-
tion of problem solving as information processing. e
initial state or problem statement can be interpreted as a
piece of information received by the agent. e solution
of the problem is a new piece of information produced
by the agent in response to the problem statement. e
task of the intelligent agent is then to transform or
process the input information (problem, initial state,
“question”) via a number of intermediate stages into
the output information (solution, goal state, “answer”).
While the term “information processing” is wide-
spread, its meaning remains surprisingly vague: how
exactly is a given piece of information transformed
into a new—and presumably more useful or mean-
ingful – piece of information? Apart from determin-
istic computation, which is merely a very speciﬁc
case of processing, I do not know of any general,

formal model of information processing. But this
vagueness is an advantage as it allows us to consider a
variety of mechanisms and models beyond sequential
algorithms or search. 
one of the most successful alternative models of
information processing can be found in neural net-
works22. In the simplest case, the network consists of
connected units or nodes arranged in subsequent
“layers”, with the connections pointing from the
“input layer”, via one or more “hidden” layers, to
the ﬁnal “output layer” (see fIgurE 2). Information
processing happens simply by presenting the
information to the input layer (in the form of a
pattern of activation distributed across the
nodes), letting that information propagate
through the hidden layers (during which the
activation pattern changes depending on the
strengths of the connections), and collecting the
processed information at the output layer by
reading the activation pattern of the ﬁnal nodes.
is seems to be in essence how the brain
processes information: the input layer repre-
sents the neurons activated by sensory organs
(perception), the output layer represents the
neurons that activate motor organs (action),
and the hidden layers represent the intervening
brain tissue processing the sensory information.
e more general version of such a “feedforward”
network is called a “recurrent” network. e dif-
ference is that a recurrent network allows activa-
tion to cycle back to nodes activated earlier. us,
there is no imposed direction “forward”, from
input layer to output layer. e input in this case is
simply the initial pattern of activation over all
nodes. e output is the ﬁnal pattern of activation
after it has settled into a stable conﬁguration. 
Compared to the sequential mod-
els of intelligence, neural net-
works have two big advantages:
~ processing happens in a par-
allel, distributed manner, mak-
ing it more robust and ﬂexible; 
~ the network does not need an
explicit program telling it how
to perform the process: it can
learn from experience.
e distributed character of
neural networks means that its
information and “knowledge”
are not localized in a single
component: they are spread out
across all the nodes and links,
which together contribute to
the ﬁnal solution. is makes
the processing much more
robust: individual components
may be missing, malfunctioning
or contain errors; yet, the disturbances this intro-
duces to the process are drowned out by the con-
tributions from the other components when
everything is aggregated. In a sequential process,
on the other hand, every step or component
through which the process passes constitutes a bot-
tleneck: if that component breaks down, the
process may never recover.
e learning happens via a general “reward” or rein-
forcement mechanism: links that have been successful-
ly used in producing a good solution become stronger;
the others become weaker. After many experiences of
successful or failed processing, the relative strengths of
the diﬀerent connections will have shifted so that the
probability of overall success has become much larger.
is intrinsically simple mechanism only works for com-
plex problems because of the distributed character of the
processing: if only the process as a whole could be rewarded
or punished, this would not produce enough information
for it to learn a complex, subtle procedure consisting of
many diﬀerent actions collaborating towards a global solu-
tion. Because the process is distributed, its components
can learn individually, so that the one can be reinforced at
the same time as its neighbour is weakened, thus rebalancing
their relative contributions.

e view of intelligence as a capability for problem solv-
ing or information processing runs into a fundamental
issue: what is a meaningful problem, or meaningful
information? Why should an intelligent agent address
certain problems or process certain information, and

disregard others? In other words, how does an agent
decide what to do or pay attention to? In the approach
of traditional artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), this issue is
ignored, as AI programmes are conceived essentially as
question-answering systems: the user or programmer
introduces the question (problem, query, input), and the
program responds with an answer (solution, output). 
on the other hand, the issue becomes inevitable once
you start to design autonomous systems, i.e. systems
that should be able to act intelligently in the absence of
an instructor telling them what to do. Such a system
should at least have a value system, i.e., a set of explicit
or implicit criteria that allow it distinguish “good” out-
comes from “bad” ones. given the ability to evaluate or
value phenomena, the agent can then itself decide what
aspects of its situation are “problematic” and therefore
require some solution. 
however, acting autonomously is more than solving
problems. A situation does not need to be “bad” in order
to make the agent act. When you take a walk, draw
something on a piece of paper, or chat with friends, you
are not solving the problem of being “walkless”, “draw-
ingless”, or “chatless”. Still, you are following an implicit
value system that tells you that it is good to exercise, to
play, to be creative, to see things, to build social con-
nections, to hear what others are doing, etc. ese
kinds of values are positive, in the sense that they
make you progress, develop, or “grow” beyond what
you have now, albeit without any clear goal or end
point. Maslow in his theory of motivation called
such values “growth needs”23. problems, on the
other hand, are deﬁned negatively, as the fact that
some aspiration or need is not fulﬁlled. With such
“deﬁciency” needs, once the goal is achieved, the
problem is solved, and the motivation to act disap-
pears. is implies a conservative strategy, which
is conventionally called “homeostasis”, “regula-
tion”, or “control”: the agent acts merely to com-
pensate perturbations, i.e. phenomena that make
it deviate from its ideal or goal state. 
e reason that this is not suﬃcient is evolu-
tion: the environment and the agents in it are
constantly adapting or evolving. erefore, no
single state can be ideal in all circumstances. e
only way to keep up with these changes (and
not lose the competition with other agents) is to
constantly adapt, learn, and try to get better.
at is why all natural agents have an instinct for
learning, development or growth. erefore, they
will act just to exercise, test their skills, or explore
new things.
e diﬀerence between positive (growth) and nega-
tive (deﬁciency) values corresponds roughly to the
diﬀerence between positive and negative emotions.
negative emotions (e.g., fear, anger, or sadness)
occur when a need is frustrated or threatened, i.e.
when the agent encounters a problem that it may
not be able to solve. positive emotions (e.g., joy,
love, curiosity) on the other hand, function to
broaden your domain of interest and build cogni-
tive, material, or social opportunities or resources24.
In other words, they motivate you to connect,
explore, play, seek challenges, learn, experience,
etc. negative emotions tend to narrowly focus
your attention to the problem at hand, so that
you can invest all your resources in tackling that
problem; positive emotions tend to widen your
ﬁeld of attention so that it becomes open to dis-
covering new opportunities for growth.
A general theory of values should encompass
both positive or growth values, and negative or
deﬁciency values. from an evolutionary per-
spective, all values can be derived from the fun-
damental value of ﬁtness (survival, develop-
ment, and reproduction), since natural selec-
tion has ensured that agents that did not suc-
cessfully strive for ﬁtness have been eliminated
from the scene.
e present paper will assume that intelligent
agents have some kind of in-built value system,
and assume that those values elicit speciﬁc actions
in speciﬁc situations. for example, in a life-threat-
ening situation, the fundamental value of security or
survival will lead the agent to act so as to evade the
danger – e.g., by running away from the grizzly bear.
on the other hand, in a safe situation with plenty of
promise, the value of curiosity will lead the agent to
explore a variety of opportunities in order to discover
the most interesting ones. e positive or negative
intensity of such a situation will be denoted as its
valence. Valence can be understood as the subjective
appreciation by an agent of the global utility, well-being
or ﬁtness oﬀered by a particular phenomenon or situa-
tion25. It can be represented by a number, which is larger
than zero for positive situations, smaller than zero for
negative ones, and zero for neutral or indiﬀerent ones.

We come to the most important new concept discussed in
this paper: a challenge is a situation that potentially carries
valence for an agent, so that the agent is inclined to act—
in the case of negative valence by suppressing the per-
ceived disturbance(s); in the case of positive valence by
exploring or exploiting the perceived opportunity(ies).
More concisely, we can deﬁne a challenge as a phenome-
non that invites action from an agent. negative chal-
lenges correspond to what we have called problems;
positive challenges represent aﬀordances for growth or
progress. But note that these are not opposites but

independent dimensions, since a challenge can carry
both positive and negative valences. for example, for a
hunter, encounter with a wild boar is both an opportuni-
ty, since a wild boar has tasty meat, and a problem, since a
wild boar is dangerous. for a company, a free trade agree-
ment can be both positive, because it gives access to new
clients, and negative, because it opens the door to new
competitors. A challenge incites action because it repre-
sents a situation in which not acting will lead to an overall
lower ﬁtness than acting – because the agent gains ﬁtness
by taking action, loses ﬁtness by not taking action, or
both. us, a challenge can be seen as a promise of ﬁtness
gain for action relative to inaction.
however, a challenge merely inspires or stimulates
action, it does not impose it. e reason is that a com-
plex situation will typically present many challenging
phenomena, and the agent will not be able to act on
all of them. for example, someone surﬁng the web
typically encounters many pages that seem worth
investigating, but obviously cannot read all of them.
We may assume that an agent is intrinsically capa-
ble of choice, and that this choice will be deter-
mined partly by subjective preferences, partly by
situational inﬂuences, partly by chance, i.e.,
intrinsically unpredictable, “random” ﬂuctua-
tions. erefore, it is in general impossible to
determine exactly how an agent will react to a
situation, although it should be possible to
derive statistical regularities about the most
common choices.
one of the reasons for this unpredictability is
that agents have bounded rationality26: they
lack the information or cognitive abilities nec-
essary to evaluate all the diﬀerent challenges.
ey therefore have to make “informed guess-
es” about the best course of action to take. 
In addition to positivity and negativity, other
dimensions worth considering in order to com-
pare challenges are27:
~ prospect (in how far can the agent foresee the dif-
ferent aspects or implications of the challenge?), 
~ diﬃculty (how much eﬀort would be involved
in tackling the challenge?), and 
~ mystery (in how far would tackling this chal-
lenge increase the agent’s prospect concerning
other challenges?).
prospect distinguishes expected challenges
(which direct the agent’s course of action and
allow it to work proactively towards (or away
from) a remote target) from unexpected ones
(which divert the course of action, and force
the agent to react). Combining the prospect
dimension with diﬀerent aspects of the valence
dimension produces the simple classiﬁcation of
TABlE 1 (an extension of the one in28). e valence
dimension has here been subdivided in not
only positive, negative and neutral (“indiﬀer-
ent”) values, but also the “unknown” value,
which represents the situation where the agent
does not (yet) know what valence the challenge
may have. 
Indiﬀerent challenges, while having zero valence,
can still function as “challenges” in the sense that
they incite actions diﬀerent from the ones that the
agent would take in their absence. for example, a
temperature of 15°C, while being neither positive nor
negative, requires a diﬀerent type of clothing than a
temperature of 25°C. Indiﬀerent challenges that are
foreseen may be called “pointers” or “markers” as they
indicate remote phenomena or circumstances worth
taking into account while setting out a course of action.
for example, a landmark, such as strangely shaped rock,
can help you to orient yourself while walking towards
your goal, without being in itself valuable. Indiﬀerent
challenges that are not foreseen may be called “variations”
or “ﬂuctuations”, as they merely represent the normal
type of diversions, such as changes in weather, traﬃc con-
ditions, people you pass on the street, etc., that are not
exactly predictable but not surprising either.
unknown challenges are potentially much more impor-
tant than indiﬀerent challenges, as they may turn out to
have a high positive or negative valence once more infor-
mation is gathered. erefore, they tend to invite action
with much more intensity. When their presence is fore-
seen, they may be called “mysteries” as they represent a
focus for curiosity and exploration, inviting the agent to
gather additional knowledge. An example would be the
entrance to a cave that you can see from afar, however,
without knowing what is inside the cave. When they
appear unexpectedly, they may be called “surprises” as
they functions as sudden warnings that the agent’s
knowledge has a potentially dangerous gap. An
example may be someone shouting at you from

An advantage of the challenge concept is that it is a gen-
eralization not only of the problem concept, but of the
concept of activation on which neural network models
are built. Indeed, from the deﬁnition it follows that a
challenge “activates” an agent, by inciting it to act.
In neurophysiology, the more accurate name used to
describe neural activation is “action potential”. is
denotes a transient rise in the electrical potential of the
neuron. is potential is propagated along the neuron’s
axon to its outgoing synapses, where it can be transmitted
to connected neurons. e underlying mechanism is the
following: an increase in potential energy creates a dise-
quilibrium or tension between the parts of neurons that
are “activated” and those that are not (that remain at a
lower potential). 
More generally, in physics a diﬀerence in potential
energy between two points determines a force that
pushes the system from the high potential to the low
one. Examples are the voltage that forces electrical
current through a wire (or through an axon), or the
gravity that pulls a rock down from the hill into the
valley. at disequilibrium or force is ultimately
what makes the system “active”, what compels it to
act. e movement from the higher to the lower
potential brings the system back to equilibrium, a
process called relaxation29, as it eliminates the ten-
sion or potential diﬀerence. In the case of a wire
or axon, relaxation implies a propagation of the
electrical current or activation from the higher to
the lower potential.
e same reasoning can be used to understand the
resolution of challenges. A challenge can be seen
as a diﬀerence between the present situation (the
problem or opportunity) and the ideal situation
(the solution or successful exploitation of the
opportunity). note that the neutral concept of
“diﬀerence” allows a challenge to be interpreted
positively (opportunity) as well as negatively
(problem). is diﬀerence creates an imbalance
or tension that needs to be relaxed, typically by
propagating it along some medium until the dif-
ference is dissipated. An example is a wave in
water or in air: a local disturbance (e.g, a stone
thrown into a pond) creates a diﬀerence in height
or density between the disturbed and non-dis-
turbed parts of the medium; this diﬀerence (wave
front) then spreads out further until it fades away.
In the case of a wave or electrical current, the direc-
tion of propagation is obvious: just follow the poten-
tial gradient in the direction of steepest descent. In
the typical challenges that confront intelligent agents,
the direction is much more complex, as there are
many possible routes to increase ﬁtness (i.e., decrease
tension). is requires an exploration of diﬀerent
routes, in parallel or in sequence, so as to ﬁnd the
better one. is will bring us to the need to better
understand propagation.
An important diﬀerence between simple relax-
ation models and challenge models is that intelli-
gent agents, unlike physical systems, must
remain in a far-from-equilibrium state: they are
constantly active, consuming energy, and trying
to avoid at all costs a complete standstill (i.e.,
death). erefore, while they are inclined to
relax existing challenges, they will also seek new
challenges (aﬀordances, resources, opportuni-
ties), unlike physical systems. In that sense, a
“challenge relaxing” dynamics only describes
part of their behaviour, and must be comple-
mented by a “challenge seeking” dynamics that
is better described by some form of active explo-
ration. is is the equivalent of what we have
called positive or growth values. It is illustrated in
the brain by the fact that thinking never stops:
activation does not simply diﬀuse until it fades
away; action potentials are continuously generated
by the brain itself, even in the absence of outside
stimuli that play the role of challenges needing to be
relaxed.
We may assume that diﬀerent agents have diﬀerent
value systems, and therefore diﬀerent “ideal” situa-
tions. erefore, the same situation will produce dif-
ferent challenges for diﬀerent agents. All agents will
try to relax the challenge, i.e. reduce it to the case
where the present situation equals the ideal situation,
by acting on it or “processing” it. is allows them to
either extract beneﬁt from the opportunity, or reduce
the penalty imposed by not solving the problem. But
in general a single agent will not be able to fully exploit
an opportunity or fully solve a problem, i.e., complete-
ly relax a challenge. is means that the situation after
processing by one agent still constitutes a challenge for
one or more further agents, which have a diﬀerent
value system deﬁning the “ideal” situation, or a diﬀer-
ent set of skills for dealing with the challenge. us,
some part of the challenge tends to remain, ready to be
address by other agents. 
is produces a complex dynamics of challenge process-
ing and propagation: each agent dealing with a chal-
lenge will normally extract some beneﬁt from it, thus
relaxing some aspects of the challenge, while leaving
some others to be passed on to further agents. If we
focus only on the remaining aspects, we see a mecha-
nism of information transmission similar to the
spreading of memes30: messages are communicated

from agent to agent, without undergoing much
change, until they have reached everyone that may
be interested in the message. is could for example
describe the diﬀusion of a particular innovation, fash-
ion, or scientiﬁc theory. 
If we focus on the challenges aspects that are processed,
we see a self-organization of workﬂow and division of
labour31: diﬀerent agents perform diﬀerent tasks that are
part of a common challenge, and then pass on the
remaining challenge to others with diﬀerent skills
and/or needs, up to the point where nothing of value is
left to extract (i.e., all tasks have been done). To better
understand such distributed processing of a challenge we
will need to investigate the dynamics of propagation.

e notion of challenge was introduced as a generaliza-
tion of the notion of a problem or opportunity that
confronts an individual agent32. In contrast to the stan-
dard paradigm of individual problem solving, the chal-
lenge propagation paradigm investigates processes that
involve a potentially unlimited number of agents. To
deal with this, our initial focus must shift from agent
to challenge: what interests us is how an individual
challenge is processed by a collective of agents dis-
tributed across some abstract space or network.
Instead of an agent travelling (searching) across a
space of challenges, we will consider a challenge
travelling (propagating) across a space of agents.
is change in perspective is similar to the one
that distinguishes memetics from traditional social
science models of communication33: instead of
focusing on the individuals communicating, memet-
ic models focus on the information (“memes”)
being communicated.
In general, propagation denotes the spreading or
transmission of some recognizable pattern, such
as a wave, a species, or an idea. e movement
of such a pattern has speciﬁc characteristics: 
~ the interaction is local, as the pattern is ini-
tially transmitted only to the immediate neigh-
bours of the point it originated in, who pass it
on to their neighbours, and so on…
~ the pattern tends to spread outwards so as to
cover an ever larger area; 
~ it tends to change while spreading; 
~ some part or trace of the pattern may remain
in the places through which it passed; 
~ the pattern needs a physical medium to carry it
while propagating; 
~ this medium has a characteristic topology (such
as a 2-dimensional surface for a wave, or a social
network for a meme) that aﬀects the shape and
extent of the spreading;
~ the medium may have additional properties
such as time lag, density, or friction that aﬀect
the speed of propagation as well as the changes
occurring to the pattern.
All these characteristics can be found in mes-
sages that are passed along across the Internet,
or in activation that spreads across the brain.
Since challenges are generalizations of these
phenomena, propagation appears like the nat-
ural way to describe their dynamics.

ere are two paradigmatic cases of challenge
propagation: stigmergy and propagation across
a network. Stigmergy is a mechanism whereby a
challenge left by an agent in some medium or
space that is shared with other agents stimulates
those others to further address that challenge34.
for example, a paragraph added to a Wikipedia
page by one person may incite a second person
reading that page to add some extra details, a
third one to add a reference for the new material,
and a fourth one to correct a grammatical mistake.
e reference may then be checked and more accu-
rately formatted by a software agent. here, chal-
lenges are spontaneously addressed by subsequent
agents as mediated by the shared space (in this case
the Wikipedia page). 
In this case of stigmergy, a challenge remains available
in a public medium or workspace that all agents can
access. If an agent decides to take on the challenge, it
will perform some actions that change the state of the
challenge and then leave the modiﬁed challenge in the
medium. At a later stage, some other agent may pick up
the modiﬁed challenge, and perform some further work
on it, again leaving the “traces” of its work in the medi-
um, where it can function as a challenge for some further
agent. e “workﬂow” from agent to agent self-organizes,
as the one leaving the challenge does not know who will
pick it up later. here, the changes in the challenge in a
sense propagate in time, but not in space, as they remain
in the same place. 
In the case of propagation across a social or neural net-
work, the workﬂow is controlled by the agents them-
selves: an agent that has ﬁnished working on a chal-
lenge passes it on to one or more speciﬁc other agents.
An example is an email message sent and forwarded
with comments from person to person, a “post” in a
social network or forum that is reposted to other
forums, or a task that is proposed by a crowdsourc-
ing system to people interested to work on it. here,

a challenge moves from agent to agent by following the
available links in the network. In this case, the topolo-
gy of the network (which node is connected to which
other nodes) fundamentally determines the propaga-
tion process: a challenge can move directly from
agent A to agent B only if there exists a link A Õ B in
the network. 
In the stigmergic case, the challenge can move from
any agent x to any agent y, without constraints.
e only requirement is that y should “visit” the
shared medium some time after x deposited its
modiﬁed challenge there. In the Wikipedia exam-
ple, any person can modify any page at any stage
independently of which other person has con-
tributed to that page. An example of networked
propagation is email, where A can pass a chal-
lenge on to B only if A has B’s email address, and
B has enough trust in A to take on challenges
from A. is typically only happens if A and B
have a social or organizational connection. 
ese are in a sense the extreme cases. What
interests us here is the formulation of a more
general theory that encompass both as well as the
ground in between them. An example of such a
“middle ground” is an Internet “forum”, i.e., a
place where discussions take place between a lim-
ited number of people belonging to a speciﬁc
group or community. All members of the com-
munity can post messages (“challenges”) to the
forum, read the messages posted by others, and
react to those messages (take on the challenge).
however, people not belonging to the community
can in general not access or create such messages.
e forum acts as a private medium for the group.
is is similar to stigmergic propagation in that a
message is propagated to any-
one in the community, but sim-
ilar to networked propagation
in the sense that the message is
directed only to members of the
community, and to no one else.
e Internet as a whole can be
conceived as a gigantic collec-
tion of such forums, which are
partly overlapping, partly dis-
jointed. A forum in the broad-
est sense can encompass every-
one (e.g., anyone can read or
write Wikipedia articles), just
two people, or anything in
between. We will use the term
forum as the most general form
of a “meeting ground” where
people can exchange challenges.
To measure the intelligence of
a distributed network, we can then try to estab-
lish its capacity to eﬀectively process challenges.
normally, diﬀerent agents have diﬀerent skills in
dealing with challenges. A complex challenge
(say, global warming) has a large number of
aspects that require diﬀerent skills. e problem
now is to distribute the diﬀerent challenge aspects
across the diﬀerent agents so as to make sure the
challenge as a whole is dealt with eﬃciently. is is
the basic problem of coordination. It includes divi-
sion of labour (who deals with what challenge com-
ponent?), workﬂow (where does a challenge go after
it has been partially dealt with?), and aggregation
(how are all the ﬁnished pieces of work assembled?)
(see fIgurE 3). 
perhaps surprisingly, such distributed coordination can
self-organize relatively easily across the Internet, via both
stigmergy35 and networked propagation. A good illustra-
tion can be found in the diﬀerent open source communi-
ties developing complex software without central supervi-
sion36. In both cases, challenges can travel more or less eﬃ-
ciently across the network of agents and workspaces until
they ﬁnd an agent able and willing to deal with them, and
then continue their journey along other agents dealing
with the remaining aspects. is allows complex chal-
lenges to be resolved in a distributed manner, by harness-
ing the collective intelligence of the diﬀerent components
(human and technological) of the network.

In the case of networked propagation, coordination
requires an additional condition, however: the links

be appropriate to the task of distributed challenge
relaxation. otherwise, challenges are likely to be

passed on to agents that do not care about them, or
that do not have the appropriate skills to deal with
them. Establishing links is achieved via a learning
process, which creates and “remembers” adequate
links, while “forgetting” inadequate ones.
e similarity between a distributed network of agents
and a neural network suggests that the distributed net-
work should be able to learn by diﬀerentially strength-
ening or weakening its links. delta learning is a form
of reinforcement learning37 in which a link is rewarded
if it brings the challenge closer to relaxation, and penal-
ized if it reduces relaxation. e link strength can then
be increased by an amount proportional to the degree of
relaxation (which may be negative). e interpretation
of this operation is that if an agent transmits a challenge
via a speciﬁc link (e.g., sends it to a friend, or posts it to
a forum), and it observes that the challenge is adequate-
ly dealt with (e.g., the friend provides a good tip on
tackling it, or the people on the forum collaboratively
develop a solution), then the agent will be more
inclined to use the same link in the future to transmit
similar challenges. at means that the probability of
use of the link, and therefore its weight, increases.
Vice-versa, an unsuccessful transmission will decrease
the probability of later use.
e network does not need any sophisticated learning
mechanisms to adapt in this way to its usage. on the
one hand, links strengths will be maintained and
updated in people’s individual memories as the
degree of trust they have in the abilities of others to
deal with speciﬁc challenges38. on the other hand,
links will be stored in the external memory that is
provided by the worldwide ICT network. for
example, links will be created or reinforced by
such mundane activities as adding someone’s
phone and address to your list of contacts, book-
marking a site, linking to someone on a social
media network, or registering for some organi-
zation (and thus getting easier access to its tools
and members). All these activities change the
environment of the agent in such a way that
this agent becomes more likely to communicate
with selected other agents. Moreover, these
changes will typically be triggered by successful
interactions: you will normally note a person’s
address if that person was interesting or friend-
ly, join a group if they appear to be doing good
work, and bookmark a site if it contains useful
information. If later it would turn out that the
person, group or site is no longer relevant to
your interests, you will similarly weaken your
connection with them…

e challenge propagation framework appears like a
very promising approach for modelling the complex
distributed processes via which problems and oppor-
tunities are processed in a self-organizing network.
After a conceptual analysis of the main components
of the framework, we are ready to formally deﬁne
these components and their relationships. is
would not only provide a basis for a mathematical
model of challenge propagation, but for a simula-
tion aimed at exploring diﬀerent variations of the
model by investigating how they aﬀect the over-
all intelligence of the network. 
presently, my research group is developing
such a mathematical/simulation model, in
order to investigate precisely how the distrib-
uted intelligence of the network increases as it
selectively strengthens or weakens its links39.
e distributed intelligence measure is simply
the degree to which challenges are resolved by
the networked agents as compared to the same
group of agents without connections. our
working hypothesis is that distributed intelli-
gence increases as the network learns better
connections, and as the number of “forums” for
stigmergy increase. 
our preliminary simulation, called ChallProp40,
indeed shows such self-organization of distributed
intelligence. however, we will need many more
runs with a variety of diﬀerent parameter settings
and variations on the dynamic mechanisms in order
to achieve results that are statistically reliable and
ready to be applied to more realistic situations. In the
meantime, I hope that the present conceptual model
will be suﬃcient to inspire other researchers to apply
these ideas in a variety of situations that exhibit distrib-
uted intelligence.

hErE ArE TWo SEnSES In WhICh onE MIghT SAy A
person, a machine, a group, an ant colony, or a
planet is intelligent. The first and most domi-
nant sense conceives of intelligence as the ability
to solve problems – to produce an appropriate output
given complex and varying input. We invoke this
meaning of the word ‘intelligent’ when we speak of a
smart phone, a smart power grid, or an intelligence
quotient. It refers to a measurable function, or a set
of measurable functions, that can be evaluated and
compared. As such it falls within the province of
science, which might be defined (per galileo and
hume) as the study of the measurable.
Accordingly, most of the academic study of col-
lective intelligence focuses on these measurable
aspects, answering questions like, “under what
conditions do groups make wise or poor deci-
sions?”, “how does gender composition affect
the problem-solving capability of a group1?”,
“how do various structures, agreements, and
processes generate public opinion and deci-
sion-making2?” A typical study might consider
feedback effects in google search and other
systems where popular choices, opinions, etc.
feed back into the choices and opinions of oth-
ers in the group can create a kind of stupidity,
groupthink, or echo chamber.
There is a danger, though, in focusing on this
rather narrow, measurable conception of intelli-
gence. for one thing, it favours the kinds of
problems we recognize and that we are able to
formulate as discrete problems, for example as on
a test. problems that are amorphous, that don’t
admit to discrete formulations or to quantifiable
solutions, escape our measures of intelligence. Very
often, the excluded capacities correspond to other
kinds of marginalization: racial, cultural, episte-
mological. IQ tests are notorious for their eleva-
tion to the exalted status of ‘intelligence’ that
subset of mental capacities that accord with the
values of the dominant culture. They measure,
in large part, acculturation and conditioning,
the mastery of the dominant or socially exalted
mode of cognition. They also measure that part
of intelligence that is measurable. But is that the
only part? Are there aspects to the mind,
whether individual or collective, that not only
defy our measurement technologies to date, but
that are inherently immeasurable?
Chastened by the deficiencies, in practice and in
principle, of intelligence measures, we might
want to adopt a more expansive conception of
intelligence in undertaking an inquiry into its
collective expression. A second meaning of the
word suggests something beyond the measurable,
something qualitative, irreducible. We use ‘intelli-
gence’ in much the same way as we use words like
sentience or consciousness, to refer to an aware sub-
jectivity that perceives and experiences the world.
Thus we speak of a divine, evil, or primordial intelli-
gence, and distinguish between real intelligence and
the semblance of intelligence. A smart phone, we
might say, is not actually smart.
The distinction between these two senses of the word
‘intelligence’ echoes that between ‘Strong AI’ and
‘Weak AI,’ in the field of artificial intelligence. Weak AI
claims that machines can act intelligently; strong AI
says they can actually be intelligent.
Most work on collective intelligent implicitly assumes
what would correspond to the ‘weak’ version of AI. of
course, one might say that each member of the collec-
tive (provided we are speaking of a human collective)
has thoughts, so in a trivial sense the collective does
think, understand, and possess consciousness. But is the
collective itself, as an emergent being, have thoughts
that are not identical with the thoughts of one or more
of its members? does the collective being understand
something that none of its individual members do?
does it itself possess consciousness and subjectivity?
We might call an affirmative answer to these ques-
tions the ‘strong version’ of collective intelligence,
exemplified by pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s concept
of the noosphere3.

In other words, we all agree that groups can solve
problems and enact various other cognitive functions.
But does a group have a psyche? does it have, distinct
from that of its members, a subjectivity? desires?
fears? Intentions? really the question is, is a collective
being a being, or is it just a kind of illusion, an expedi-
ent concept whose properties are fully reducible to and
explainable by the properties of its parts?
let me offer a few reasons why these are not idle ques-
tions. first, the actual effect of intelligence on the world
depends on factors far beyond reasoning ability. Smart
men and women have done horrible things; they have
perpetrate the most arrant idiocy, due to no fault of their
reasoning power, factual knowledge, or capacity to think
abstractly or recognize patterns. If we grant the premise
of collective intelligence, we must then ask what factors
– cognitive or non-cognitive – might induce collective
insanity as well. Some of these are already known – col-
lective tunnel vision, the echo chamber effect, etc. – but
perhaps by granting the collective beingness, and the
various other qualities of self besides intelligence (or
qualities contributing to an expansive view of what
intelligence is), we can understand its behaviour better.
descartes seemed to think that conscious thought was
a necessary and sufficient condition for beingness: “I
think, therefore I am.” But a full human also feels,
wants, loves, suffers, laughs… and we might say the
emphasis on thought – which of all these qualities is
apparently most exclusive to humans – is a form of
the same anthropocentrism that through its disre-
spect for nature is laying waste this planet. Beings
less like us, we relegate to a lower degree of being-
ness. Moreover, the identification of intelligence
with thought, or with solving problems (of the
kind that human beings are better able than
other beings to solve), leaves out non-cognitive
ways of interacting with the world that are part
of an intuitive understanding of intelligence. It
is with good reason we call an emotionally
insensitive person clueless, whatever his powers
of ratiocination. The narrow association of
intelligence with (certain kinds of) thinking
sanctifies the worldview, politics, technology,
and social structure that was created through
those kinds of thinking. Analysis, abstraction,
linear reason, binary thinking, and so forth are
quite useful for creating the society we have
today. By the same token, the crisis of that soci-
ety invites us to broaden our conception of intel-
ligence along with the approach to life that con-
ception valorises. This is the second reason to
examine intelligence in the ‘strong’ sense as it
applies to collectives.
Thirdly, the very same questions I’ve been asking
about collectives might also be asked about the
human brain. What, for example, is thought? It is a
sequence or pattern of neural activity, not some-
thing that can be done by a single neuron (as far
as we know). We normally think of intelligence as
an emergent quality irreducible to the elements
of its physical medium: conventional scientific
opinion does not hold that because each neuron
has a little intelligence, the brain has a lot. The
brain, in the conventional view, exhibits collec-
tive intelligence, and it is obviously intelligence
in the strong sense.
Because the same questions of subjectivity and
interiority apply equally to groups, to comput-
ers, and to individual human beings, we might
profitably look to the philosophy of mind for
insight. In the vast literature on consciousness
and subjectivity, most of the debate centres on
the question of whether these require an imma-
terial soul; whether mental experience eludes
reduction to physical processes. The camp
established in modern times by Thomas nagel,
John Searle, and david Chalmers says yes: how-
ever well a machine might replicate thought
processes, there will be something missing: the
qualitative, the interior, the subjective conscious
experience. nagel says that because any reductive,
objective account of consciousness necessarily
leaves out subjectivity – what it is like to be some-
thing – that therefore, there must be some aspect of
consciousness that transcends physicalist, reductive
explanation4. Searle, developing the distinction
between strong and weak AI, describes how a com-
puter or other system could perform cognitive
processes without actually understanding their con-
tent5. Chalmers, similarly, invokes the idea of the
(philosophical) zombie, enacting all the behaviours of a
conscious self, saying all the right things, but actually
merely running a program empty of interior experi-
ence6. To even conceive such a thing, he says, shows that
there must be some non-functional aspect to conscious-
ness (and therefore to intelligence in the strong sense). 
Their critics are legion and, while their critical approaches
are diverse, generally agree that a reductive physical expla-
nation of consciousness is possible in principle. no non-
material soul is required. Their case appears to be grow-
ing stronger, as brain research keeps uncovering neuro-
logical explanations for (or at least correlates to) aspects
of experience that we consider central to consciousness,
such as volition7 and attention8. The implication is that
consciousness is sort of an illusion, a computational
process, and not an irreducible aspect of reality.
lurking within this debate is a hidden but highly sig-
nificant agreement: both sides agree that we have no
direct access to the subjectivity of another person.
While some may argue that interiority is necessary

in order to offer the full range of responses that a
human being does, most agree that there is no way
of knowing whether someone has subjective interior
experiences except by inference, for example, by ask-
ing them. The measurable dimensions of intelligence
we can verify empirically; the qualitative aspect (grant-
ing that there is such a thing) we can only infer. 
This agreement, however, takes for granted certain
unstated metaphysical assumptions about knowledge
and identity that we, the dominant intellectual culture,
would do well to question. for starters, why is it assumed
without much debate that no one can have direct access
to the subjective experience of another person (or non-
person)? This is obvious only if we conceive and experi-
ence ourselves as fundamentally separate from each
other. There are other stories of self, however. We could
see ourselves, as many spiritual traditions do, not as sep-
arate beings but as “interbeings,” not just interdepen-
dent but interexistent. There are many alternatives to
the separate skin-encapsulated soul of descartes and
contemporary religion. We might, for example, adopt
the metaphor of the holograph or fractal, in which
each part contains the whole. In that case, it would be
no surprise if I could, under the right circumstances,
experience that part of me that is you. The holo-
graphic model of self and world, while outside main-
stream philosophic discourse, has been developed by
such thinkers as Karl pribram, david Bohm, and
Michael Talbot; it also echoes teachings in Eastern
religion such as Indra’s net.
This is not merely armchair philosophy. There are
in fact many methods to induce the experience of
subjective identification with other people – and
not only people, but animals, plants, nations,
planets, forces of nature, rocks, the earth, and
other entities to which the Western mind would
deny beingness9. These methods do not lend
themselves to scientific or philosophical ‘proof’ of
the subjectivity of other beings, even other peo-
ple, because the very concept of proof depends
on objectivity. When I say here that meditation,
breathwork, or psychedelics can induce such
states, I am making an assertion that rests on no
firmer foundation than my own experiences and
the subjective reports of people who have had
such experiences.
outside the Western mind, however, the ascrip-
tion of subjectivity, intentionality, conscious-
ness, and the rest to non-human beings is nearly
universal. It extends not only to animals but to
plants, mountains, rivers, the earth, the sun,
even to rocks, in individual and collective expres-
sion. Thus, an encounter with a bear is also an
encounter with Bear. In this way of thinking, col-
lective intelligence in the strong sense is a given.
despite our modern conditioning, we are not so
different. It is quite natural for us to speak of
“What russia wants” or “What Microsoft wants,”
even though we might, if pressed, admit that
nations and corporations aren’t people and cannot
have such a thing as a desire. yet they behave as if
they do. or do they actually behave? do they
actually exist? Aren’t they just human fictions,
agreements, stories? 
Maybe. But to a neuron, the brain itself is a
story. one day, two neurons were having a
conversation. “Whoa, dude!” one of them said,
“I just had a trippy idea. What if it isn’t just
you and I who are conscious, what if all of us
together are?”
The other neuron said dismissively, “fun idea,
but in reality all that is ever happening is you
and I and billions of others of us having con-
versations with each other. That’s what’s hap-
pening on the base level.”
“But then why are we collectively enacting
behaviour that not a single one of us wants? our
collective being has been getting drunk every day,
yet not a single one of us neurons wants to be
doused in alcohol.”
nor is the desire of a nation or of a corporation
merely some additive property of the desires of its
constituent members. Anyone who has spent time in
an organization can confirm that sometimes, the
organization does something that only a tiny minority
– or even none – of its members actually agree with. It
is as if the organization has a mind of its own. And
maybe it does. Each constituent is called into one of
various roles, becoming that role in organizational life.
While different personalities may be drawn to different
roles, the role is prior to the personality, which must fit
into it. The fit is of course never perfect; hence the near-
universal feeling that the role is not really ones self, the
feeling of being a puppet of the institution. This feeling
is quite common even among its putative leaders.
Maybe the reason it seems that the organization has a
mind of its own, is that it actually does have a mind of
its own. not separate from the minds of its constituents,
neither is it reducible to them. nor are the minds of its
constituents separable from the group. We are social
animals; we are not separate individuals having rela-
tionships – we are relationship. Beyond the separate
self, the smallest unit of collective intelligences is a
partnership, and most of us have experienced that in
a partnership, who we are changes. We might consid-
er that “who we are” in total is the integration of
who we are in each of our social, economic, and
ecological relationships. Strip those away, and there
is nothing left.

In other words, we cannot say that collective intel-
ligence is secondary to individual intelligence, or a
mere epiphenomenon arising out of relationships
among individuals. Each level, individual and collec-
tive, co-creates the other. To identify the locus of
subjectivity in the individual is a cultural conceit –
one not shared by other cultures that valued the we
above the I, and gave it ontological primacy.
That is not to say that any random subset of socially
related people constitute a collective being. There must
be some kind of container that defines it; a selective
social membrane that distinguishes self from other,
formed of the agreements and perceptions of its mem-
bers and the society that contains it. 
If it sounds here like I am advocating something like a
“group soul,” maybe I am. Most intellectuals would
probably be uncomfortable with such concepts, prefer-
ring to restrict any discussion of collective intelligence
to its measurable dimensions. Intelligence in the
strong sense I have invoked eludes the protocols of the
Scientific Method, calling instead for a phenomeno-
logical approach. for one thing, it defies rigorous def-
inition – how can one define, in more basic concepts,
something that is itself elemental? If consciousness,
subjectivity, and the ‘qualia’ of experience are not
merely the artefacts of complexity, not mere abbre-
viations for properties of collections of neural states
or, in the case of collective intelligence, interper-
sonal interactions, they will defy reductive expla-
nation. They cannot be measured in physical
units; therefore, following galileo’s distinction of
primary and secondary qualities, we accord them
a lesser degree of realness, or even deny that they
exist at all. To be sceptical of such things as the
“desire of the collective” or the “group soul” or
“collective unconscious” is to stand securely in
the demesne of science.
My purpose here is not to prove that there is
some dimension of collective intelligence outside
the purview of functionalism and reductionism.
Even for the ‘collective’ of the human brain, cen-
turies of furious philosophical debate has failed
to come to consensus that such a proof exists.
The mind composed of human beings rather
than neurons offers no less formidable difficul-
ties. My purpose, rather, is to suggest that we step
outside the demesne of science into other ways of
knowing, relating, and communicating. We can-
not use objective means to prove the subjectivity
of another being. But we can use subjective means.
What does this look like?
for clarity, consider what it means to relate to
another human being as a subject rather than an
object. Even if no objective proof exists that other
people aren’t zombies enacting all the behaviours
of a subjective experiencer without the interior
content, and even though no one actually believes
they are, to some extent most of us act as if we
do believe it. We objectify other people, treat
them as instruments of our own utility, as if
they were less than fully a self. When we treat
them as full subjects, however, we engage com-
passion: we consider what it is like to be them.
As Thomas nagel explained in his influential
essay, “What is it like to be a bat?” the essence of
consciousness is that it is “like something” to be
that other (person, animal, etc.)10. Most philoso-
phers (but not indigenous people) agree that it is
not like anything to be a brick or a rock – that
these things are devoid of the qualities of self.
our reigning ideology claims that we have out-
grown the childish perceptions of the indige-
nous, to see and manipulate the world as object.
This condescending, arrogant, and ethnocentric
attitude was much more compelling a generation
or two ago, before the environmental crisis
became impossible to ignore. Today, though, our
arrogance is wavering, and we become more open
to worldviews that do not arrogate the qualities of
self to human beings alone.
ultimately, our present ecological crisis has come
largely because we see nature and everything in it as
mere objects. The paradigm shift into an intersub-
jective world is inseparable from truly deep ecology.
Will our ecological salvation come from merely
being cleverer in our manipulation of a natural world
that we continue to see as a collection of soulless stuff?
perhaps a deeper sort of revolution is necessary.
It is quite natural that, as part of this shift, we begin
relating to collectives as beings-in-themselves with a
selfhood transcending their constituent parts. As when
we relate empathically to another person, the founda-
tional question is, “What is it like to be that being?”
What is it like to be that organization? That audience?
That corporation? That nation? That is not to say that
their experience of being is identical to the human
experience; we cannot directly map human emotions
and perceptions onto non-humans. What we can do is
to relate to that being as a subject.
To the extent that we accept the subjectivity of collec-
tives, that they can be intelligent in more than the
problem-solving sense, we are invited to venture
beyond analytic methods in studying collective intel-
ligence – just as we must venture beyond neurology
in understanding the individual human psyche. We
all know that organizations exhibit ‘behaviour’; that
they can be efficient or inefficient, healthy or dys-
functional. Can they also go insane? delusional?

Schizophrenic? paranoid? Can they fall in love?
Can they be afraid? Can they experience trauma?
healing? do they have desires? do they go through
infancy, youth, senescence? naïve intuition says yes,
and while such questions may often defy quantitative
study, we should not dismiss them as exercises in
anthropomorphic projection. Who knows what avenues
of qualitative research and practice might become
apparent in asking such questions? Besides, they become
quite natural as we expand our conception of selfhood
beyond the human individual.
The field called organizational behaviour already accepts,
implicitly, the premise of the selfhood of collectives.
Interestingly, the concept has also entered politics with
the controversial legal concept of the personhood of cor-
porations. The word ‘corporation’ itself already suggests
as much, denoting “that which forms a body (a corpus).”
notwithstanding the heretofore toxic consequences of
the doctrine of corporate personhood, if we expanded
that concept to “corporate selfhood,” we might explore
what kind of ‘self,’ what kind of being, a corporation is.
(I speak here of corporations composed of actual peo-
ple, and not those that exist only on paper.) What are
its fears, its motivations, its character? These consider-
ations might lead to insight on what kind of status
they should be accorded under law.
It may of course be just as impossible to prove,
through objective means, the subjectivity of collec-
tives as it is to prove the subjectivity of another
person. nonetheless, the corporate example sug-
gests that it can be a fruitful operating assump-
tion (just as it is in interpersonal relationships).
By accepting the validity of a phenomenology
and a psychology of collective beings, we free
research, activism, and organizational manage-
ment to evolve. They cannot be left out of the
larger paradigm shift toward a worldview of
interconnection, ecology, and interbeing.

that it may be wise to return to the term’s
origin in etymology. from the Wik-
tionary, we have this proposal: latin intel-
legentia (the act of choosing between,
intelligence), from intellegō (understand), from
inter (between) + legō (choose, pick out, read).
however, on the online Etymology dictionary1,
we can read both intellegentia and intelligentia
as the given latin origins of the contemporary
word. e diﬀerence is important because the
latter version would indicate a diﬀerent etymolo-
gy based on “inter” and “ligare”, which means to
bind, to connect.
ere are no strong reasons why “ligare”, a more
logical term, would not be considered as a possi-
ble alternative to “legere”. In all modern lan-
guages derived from latin, none have adopted
the phonetic radical of <inter-legere>. In any case,
even if ligare were not to be part of the true ety-
mology, at least the proximity of the words and
the subsequent shifts in the distinguishing
phoneme invite the implicit notion of connecting
as a connotation of the act of selecting more than a
single item. Another word for understanding,
“comprehend”, reﬂects even more the notion of
connecting things together2.
All cognitive technologies from the telegraph
to the Internet and social media derive their
properties from carving speciﬁc connecting
routines in the Internet to delve into selected
modalities of relationships and knowledge. e
present trends of information and cognition
technologies have been based and guided on
connecting people and things in various conﬁg-
urations to improve awareness, intelligence and
knowledge. hence we are back to a core mean-
ing of intelligence: making the right connections
mental, social or technological is what gives peo-
ple improved access of their intellect to pertinent
information. e case of Big data is perhaps the
best example of available cognitive potential that
is only revealed by collecting and connecting the
pertinent data. In Big data, there is no answer
before the question is asked. Big data simulate a
kind of total understanding that requires only the
focus of a query to be manifested. 
All technologies of data-tracking are presently con-
verging very fast to be absorbed by and into Big
data. e commercial and social pertinence of know-
ing everything about us – to say nothing about securi-
ty issues – makes that trend irreversible. our destiny
as a society immersed into digital culture worldwide is
to become transparent. is is the exact opposite of the
eﬀects of literacy that made people individually opaque
by internalizing and privatizing thinking. e ethics of
opacity that guaranteed privacy were long in coming
from the time of extortion and “question” during the
Spanish Inquisition to the separation of Church and
State and the rise of the private individual. is long-
term trend is being reversed today. A new ethics based
on transparency appears inevitable. It will probably
give precedence to community over individuality.

intelligence for each one of the users of electronic
technologies from the telegraph to “cloud comput-
ing” and Twitter. It brings people together instead
of separating them as alphabetic literacy did and it
allows for any number of individual entries in a ﬂuid
information space deﬁnable for individual as well as
collective and connective needs. It can take many
forms whether pooling individual resources in services
such as google, Wikipedia and social bookmarking or
externalizing and objectifying imagination in ﬁctional
but live 3d environments such as Second life. 
What I ﬁnd intriguing about Second life and other 3d
virtual environments is that they emulate our imaginary
processes but outside our heads on a screen. at exter-
nalization itself is already a surprising cognitive phenom-
enon, projecting the ﬁctional universe in front of our
eyes, instead of behind them. But, what is more, these
simulations are allowing other people to share into
them. e reason I call it “objective Imaginary” is that
it occupies a hybrid position between theatre (which is
not directly aﬀected by how we interpret it), and partic-
ipative thinking, the way we actively participate in real-
izing in our minds the ﬁgures, places, sounds and
other sensorial features of novels, merely to read them. 
let us consider all the intellectual resources we have
learned to process in the intimate isolation of our
own mind, such as planning, sorting, classifying,
remembering, designing, calculating, most if not all
of such cognitive operations are being taken over,
expanded, connected, veriﬁed and distributed on
line and via screens that “objectify” the processes
themselves submitting them to our estimation for
approval. Imagination is next. What is beginning
to happen now is the opposite of what happened
at the time Cervantes wrote don Quixote. In
that benchmark novel about a cognitive revolu-
tion, what changes the mind of the hero is his
excessive reliance on reading medieval
romances and his nostalgia for heroic times. Its
all in his mind, of course, because it is in his
mind that he processes the words of the novels
he reads. Virtual reality for him is in his head
not on a screen. e diﬀerence is that today
most people share their minds with a screen for
any duration from 2 to 8 hrs a day.

As pierre lévy famously said, “Internet is not in
space, it is space”. 
Concluding on preliminary observations in the
introduction of a very inﬂuential book, La produc-
tion de l’espace, henri lefebvre deﬁnes space as
constituted by three distinct but interrelated spaces:
“physical space : nature, the Cosmos, mental space
(including logical and formal abstractions), and
ﬁnally social space»3. Inspired by lefebvre, sociolo-
gist Anna Cicognani adds cyberspace as yet anoth-
er distinct but complementary kind of space :
“online Virtual Communities (VCs), in particular, rep-
resent an increasing resource for people using the Inter-
net as a tool for various purposes, among others, infor-
mation exchange and storing, communication, sociali-
sation. More and more frequently, these communities
are populated by a variety of citizens who look for
more interactive aspects of online tools. Apart from
obtaining information, there is the possibility of
interacting with other users and ultimately to “leave a
trace” of themselves in the online community”4.
e “Always-on” generation (by which I mean
not just the younger citizens but anyone who
carries a cellular phone) is deﬁned by being per-
manently accessible via mobile contraptions. It
is a condition of trust and availability, a kind of
incessant dialogue with the world.  e “wired”
generation of connection junkies circulate and
recirculate information from the biological mind
to that of the networks. e always-on generation
builds its identity on line via social media and
become dependent on the reputation its members
acquire in such manner. is so-called “reputation
capital” is garnered by manicuring proﬁles and
connections. It is quite literally “plugged-in” the
cognitive environment available via networks. for
this generation the world is both global and geo-
localized at the same time. Wherever you are, you are
potentially in touch with the whole world.
As doug rushkoﬀ already noted, children do not
merely watch the television these days, as their grand-
parents did, they play with it. ey multitask, they can
handle several “windows” at once. eir intelligence
relies on connecting to a perpetually refashioned hyper-
text of relationships and tag clouds, a hypertext of which
they are themselves the central node. young people are
“friends” at 3 to 4 degrees of separation, while their
grandparents needed to at least shake a person’s hand a
few times before considering oneself as a “friend”.
Cyberspace is a sort of “computer-supported” social
space that bridges the physical and the mental spaces. It
is primarily a shared environment. Cyberspace, by deﬁ-
nition, is shared via networks. It is entirely dependent
on technological connections based on the reﬁned
management of electricity5. ese networks are conﬁg-
ured so as to ensure speciﬁc connections. e architec-
ture of these networks diﬀers in patterns and complex-
ity depending on the numbers and the kinds of inter-
actions required6. Connective intelligence can be
assessed both in the creation of such networks and in
the eﬀect they foster.  
With the exception of mental space, all four kinds
of space are shared and up to a point, one could

argue that even mental space can be shared as in a
classroom or seminar situation where the course
material and the instruction diﬀuses in the student
body a shared intellectual space. on the other hand,
mental space is still deemed to be private although
that very privacy is being threatened in all manners by
digital data collection and cross-referencing, thus, on
line at least, even that intimate recess is made public.

In his seminal approach to intelligence, daniel gole-
man7 has added a critical element, which is its emotion-
al component. is element proves important for social
activism more often than not motivated by indigna-
tion, anger, fear, or a feeling of social solidarity as in so
many examples since the world movements of Indigna-
dos, occupy Wall Street, Anonymous or the Arab
Spring. e Internet has a very important emotional
dimension. people increasingly feel the need to share
more and more personal details about themselves,
their thoughts, feelings and ideas with the wider
world, as part of their online existence.
is is true not just for the “friends” on facebook,
or for couples using match-making sites, but also
for the whole of our lives as lived on this medium.
It is true for how we share our politics via Twitter
or our viral videos on youTube. Social media act
as the agent for conveying and sharing emotions.
e online world works as an integrative system
of impulses, desires and frustrations, which is
moving at the speed of light. e grassroots
activist sites such as usahidi or Avaaz articulate
collective emotions and connectivity amongst
peoples across borders and cultures. 
We share global emotions all the time, but we
don’t always realize it. Certainly we share a sense
of the horror of crude decapitation, whether we
have seen it on Internet or not. But we also share
more latent emotions, such as the global dismay
regarding the revelations – and subsequent treat-
ment of Edward Snowden – and simultaneously
experience a subconscious solidarity with the
multitude on this topic. e era of transparency
throws light on scandalous practices from trusted
institutions. A global unease sets in making peo-
ple ripe for local ﬂare-ups. rongs of persons are
involved in and with ukraine or Syria and every-
body has an opinion. e scandals attending the
Sotchi games gave mixed feelings about putin
and russia to many people.
e immediacy of social media enables the indi-
vidual to get involved on an emotional level with
current social and political issues. e readiness to
respond emotionally to external public events
results from the perception on the part of social
media users, that they are connected personally
with others sharing their own political views,
with whom they are willing to share information
and news in real time. 
I like to use the organic metaphor of the human
limbic system to describe this new system of
social interaction. By using this metaphor, I want
to explore the conditions surrounding the cre-
ation, communication and development of emo-
tions on the Internet in order to throw light on
the relationship between technology and psy-
chology. It is important to understand this inter-
play before trying to analyse the ways in which
the media modify our environment and how
people are changed by the use of the media they
are exposed to on a daily basis. is is especially
important when it comes to a technology that
transmits language, and which therefore becomes
an interface between the technology and the mind
of the user. furthermore, in exploring the rela-
tionship between knowledge and the media, we
can also examine the ways in which new technolo-
gies aﬀect our conscious and unconscious process-
ing of information and our aﬀective responses.
When a medium is connected to the Internet, there
are many emotional and cognitive events being trans-
mitted from person to person, which in turn motivate
the sharing of experience and also the call to political
action. It is clear that today’s geopolitical map of the
world has been changed by the arrival on the political
scene, via the Internet, of a new class of mass political
activists, who are no longer the “Silent Majority”.
So now that the majority is silent no more, the result is
a kind of interactive human ‘massiﬁcation’ consisting
of the connections between many individuals who
respond to some current issue as a signiﬁcant collective.
e Spanish network sociologist Manuel Castells called
this the collaboration of many “mass individuals”.
Castells identiﬁed that the relationships that are estab-
lished between individuals on a personal basis, from one
person to another, are much more complex and articu-
lated than those that come out of the reactions of the
crowd or the anonymous mass. We can therefore imag-
ine that the result of this endless interaction between
individuals on the Internet is equivalent to the inﬁnite
multiplication of conversations over a cup of coﬀee.
ese changes in the way we interact and relate to others
in a mass social context are directly reﬂected in how we
use contemporary media. In particular we can expect a
redeﬁnition of the distinction between public and pri-
vate in the conversational context of the sites connect-
ed to social networks, as well as the emergence of new

forms of intimacy and the expression of emotions
that reinforce both individual action and social inter-
action. is new experience of real-time sharing of
information, emotions and opinions by individuals
rests on what I call the emotional limbic system.
e limbic system regulates emotions in to the human
body (as it does in all mammals). It is a complex set of
smaller brain structures which occupy the inner part of
the brain and is repeated in the two hemispheres. It was
formed hundreds of millions of years ago, and is present
in many other animals that are less evolved than man.
is region of the brain, which is closely connected to the
cerebral cortex, or grey matter, regulates and process infor-
mation that conditions biological rhythms, and emotive
responses such as, for example fear and aggression, or love.
We can more or less correlate the various elements and
functions of the emotional network of the Internet’s ‘cen-
tral nervous system’ to biological organs. e screens and
keyboards, and all the technical equipment of pCs,
tablets and mobile phones, co-ordinated via the Inter-
net, act like the thalamus transmitting information in
order to bring about action. Similarly, data aggregators
work like the hippocampus to combine information
from diﬀerent media and sources, and thus enable the
system to grow. Social media, like Twitter in particu-
lar, can be equated to the amygdala, which plays the
role of an accelerator and determines the amount and
size of the emotional response to an event. Twitter
stimulates its followers to instantly experience a
wave of shared feelings with the crowd. Twitter is at
once both very individual, touching everyone per-
sonally and revealing their inner being, while also
extending the inﬂuence and impact of the crowd.
Social media, the hippocampus of the Internet,
carry and store images and text that stimulate
emotions and allow the aggregation of informa-
tion and the sharing of facts and opinion in real
time. facebook, Twitter, chat rooms and
forums, as well as other sites are highly region-
alised, like orkut in Brazil. ey make people
react in emotional waves that can bring people
from diﬀerent cultures, religions and social
backgrounds together.
ere is interplay between the personal and the
public spheres in the views and arguments posted
by anyone about current issues such as the global
ﬁnancial crisis, and the growing call for greater
transparency and responsibility by large ﬁnancial
institutions8. e collective response via social
media to issues such as these raises the growing
indignation of the crowd. In the past, people tend-
ed to have more tolerance of corrupt governments
or ﬁrms because there was a lack of accurate infor-
mation, but now, especially after Wikileaks, there
exists via social media a sort of permanent state of
alertness that can trigger a collective cognitive
response. e Wikileaks case was the start of a new
political reality, where transparency has a value,
information is currency, and where awareness and
responsibility have become an ethical concern. 
Indignez-vous!, a small book by Stéphane hessel,
published in france in 20109 started the interna-
tional movement called ‘los Indignados’. e 28
pages spread virally via social media ﬁrst in Spain
and then in many other countries, producing
over a thousand emotional waves beyond the
borders of france. To quote hessel:
e real outrage is not borne by hating, but by
empathy and solidarity with others, and in this
sense it is a natural eﬀect of interconnectivity asso-
ciated with real political and social unrest. It moves
beyond the need of the individual to be communal
experience, something more universally human.
e Internet and Web 2.0 tools introduced
into civil society a real possibility of unstruc-
tured expression, without hierarchies, participa-
tory and collaborative. rough the process of
sharing, in a spontaneous and emotional way, a
“global village” was enabled.
at said, on the other hand, collective political
participation online has also been derided as so-
called “clicktivism” (from the contraction of the
word ‘activism’ with the verb ‘click’). is means
the simple act of clicking on like, which can be
seen as a lazy way of belonging to the group, and
not a real social membership. See Micah White:
“In promoting the illusion that surﬁng the web can change
the world, clicktivism is to activism as Mcdonalds is to a
slow-cooked meal. It may look like food, but the life-giving
nutrients are long gone10.”
is rather harsh judgement of the political impact of
social media based movements ignores the fact that peo-
ple did get involved through demonstrating in the streets.
Emotion on line can readily turn into “e-motion”, that is,
the tendency to drive people into active and public
protest. e occupy Wall Street movement, for example,
clearly goes beyond mere clicking and involves real mobi-
lization of people at the physical level.
from the Arab uprisings to the protests in Iceland, peo-
ple have progressed from what began online to a street
movement that powers and connects heterogeneous
communities. e Indignados from all over the world,
the aganaktismenoi of greece, e Anonymous, the M-
15 in Spain and all other facets of the Indignez-vous
current are clear examples of this new phenomenon.
e American sociologist zeynep Tufekci, who has
thoroughly studied the various stages of the Arab Spring,
has called this phenomenon “network eﬀects”11, by
which she means the impact of network communica-
tions on the behaviour of the mass in times of crisis.

e Internet changes the structures and forms of
social networks, increasing the speed of communica-
tion – modifying and restructuring the public sphere.
In my view, the most important thing to understand
and study in these examples is the fact that the Internet
allows individuals to extend their impact beyond the
conﬁnes of their own room and go global. As Tufekci
pointed out, there had been more than seven street
protests in Tunisia before the event that gave the starting
signal to the Arab Spring. for example, in gafsa, a town
in the deep south of Tunisia, there were protests in 2008,
which were followed by brutal repression12, not only of
individual protestors, but also of information. Tufekci
notes that, in 2008, there were only 28,000 facebook users
in Tunisia. But after the self-immolation of Mohammed
Bouazizi in 2010, the protest movement was launched
that became viral. And by this time there were two mil-
lion facebook users in Tunisia. is shows that the
impact of the network is so strong that it can challenge
even extremely brutal repression. 
We must also understand, however, that the phenome-
non of social mobilization was not born yesterday or
even three years ago. ere are precedents that can be
interpreted as stages in the technological maturation
of the social limbic system. Even before the expansion
of the Internet, as early as 1989 Chinese dissidents
were able to use faxes to send news and images of
repression at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, despite
government censorship and control of the press and
the mainstream media.
In 1994, when the masked Subcomandante Marcos
appeared on the Internet as the face of the rebellion
in the Mexican state of Chiappas, this was the start
of public opinion evolving from local to global. It
was no longer possible for the world to ignore the
injustice done by the government of Mexico
against the farmers in that region in the name of
multinational food companies.
e special case of the philippines gives evidence
to the diﬀering capacities of the Internet, SMS
and Twitter to provoke an emotional response
from the people. for a couple of years (1999-2001)
it was known that the Estrada government was
involved in many corruption scandals. But an
initial protest in 2000 on the Internet had not
resulted in a mass impact because, although there
were a million filipinos connected in the world,
only 50,000 of these were in their own country,
the rest living as expatriate workers in other coun-
tries. In 2001, perhaps because the use of SMS in
the philippines was still free, it was possible to con-
tact thousands of people with just one message,
and those with mobile phones raised enough anger
and indignation amongst the populace to bring
down the Estrada government.
In Iran in 2009, the use of Twitter raised awareness
of electoral fraud, threatening to invalidate the re-
election of the government, but was stopped
because of repression:
Twitter, […] especially because of its integration with
mobile phones […] is in fact the only channel more
or less open or open intermittently, through which
news and information can get through about what is
happening in the Islamic republic after the disputed
Iranian presidential election that saw the victory of
Ahmadinejad13.
As commented by the Washington Post:
What we are seeing is the ﬂickering ﬂame of free-
dom. people are willing to risk their lives to protest
a system that oppresses them and denies them fun-
damental human dignity. ose who say none of
this matters – that it is a feud between factions of
the ruling class and that it has no chance of bringing
about real change – are missing the point. e peo-
ple of Iran are exercising their sovereign right as a
people to stand before their rulers and say “no
more”. ey are commanding the attention of a
world that seeks to make deals with their oppressors.
at Iranians are telling us they yearn to be free14.
What lessons emerge from these examples? is
new phenomenon of bottom-up political
activism, not organized by political parties, but by
ordinary citizens, has demonstrated that it will be
very diﬃcult to suspend democratic constitutions
and hand over power to members of the same fami-
ly or the same “caste” as has been the case before. In
that regard, I am particularly impressed by the con-
clusion that Esther dyson, chairperson of Edventure
holdings, an active investor in a variety of start-ups
around the world, gave to her reﬂexion on Wikileaks:
In the long run, Wikileaks matters for two reasons. e ﬁrst is
that we need a better balance of power between people and power.
Information – and speciﬁcally the Internet’s power to spread it –
is our best defense against bad, unaccountable behaviour.
Second, we do want to trust our governments and institutions.
e point of openness is to make those in power behave better
– and to make us trust them more. rather than viewing them
as enemies, we should know what they are up to, and perhaps
have a little more say in what they do15.
Esther dyson’s voice is the voice of Civil Society, not rev-
olutionary, not class bound, not exclusive, just plain
common-sense, a view of democracy that franklin and
Jeﬀerson would have shared. democracy is not only
based on equal rights and proper representation of the
individual by power and institutions, it also based on
sharing a vast mental space, that is, the awareness – at
diﬀerent degrees of intensity – of belonging to a com-
mon situation bound neither by physical nor mental
space, but including the social in the mental space as a
kind of background intuition. Cyberspace adds a
global extension to all the other spaces to allow a

‘global social being’ to emerge at the subconscious
level of everybody.  
e concept of the social being is not just a new
metaphor. It began as part of early tribal culture, but
nowadays even in a modern city, where people are
part of the connective social being, they are continually
subjected to the emotional currents of the moment
from the neighbourhood to the globe. e great theo-
rists of the crowd, gustave le Bon (e Crowd: Study of
the popular mentality, 1895), Elias Canetti (Crowds and
Power, 1960) and Jacques Ellul (Propaganda: Shaping the
attitude of men, 1973) have all made similar relevant
observations about man’s social being. Similarly, it is also
understood that where people have physical and social
needs in common, an emotional exchange also occurs as
part of the interaction. e arrival of real-time media,
radio, television and now the Internet, magnify this
process and speed it up more than ever before. In sum-
mary, therefore, we can say that the Internet has mimic-
ked the biological limbic system of the individual body
to extend its inﬂuence to the social body.
however, as zeynep Tufekci said in a recent TEd
conference:
“e problem with social movements today is not that their
participants lack heart or that they fail to forge true bonds
among themselves, as some have argued. like startups that
grow too quickly movements need to learn to scale beyond
the fast participation that’s made possible from online
networks. All these good intentions and bravery and sac-
riﬁce by themselves are not going to be enough”16.
e political eﬀects arising from the use of networks
are evolving rapidly and while the ﬁrst events
caught power structures by surprise, with conse-
quences that have not always been positive (in par-
ticular with the Arab Spring that seem to have
changed things for the worse in several countries
such as Syria and lybia), government – and busi-
nesses – have quickly reacted to the threats and
seen the opportunities for increased control on
the social body. In a recent paper, Tufekci
describes in great detail how Big data and what
she dubbs ‘computational politics’ are turning
things around in favour of the very institutions
that were put into question by the Civil Society.
As she concludes this important essay:
e methods of computational politics will, and
already are, also used in other spheres such as market-
ing, corporate campaigns, lobbying and more. e six
dynamics outlined in this paper – availability of big
data, shift to individual targeting, the potential and
opacity of modeling, the rise of behavioral science in the
service of persuasion, dynamic experimentation, and the
growth of new power brokers on the Internet who con-
trol the data and algorithms – will aﬀect many aspects of
life in this century. More direct research, as well as critical
and conceptual analysis, is crucial to increase both our
understanding and awareness of this information environ-
ment, as well as to consider policy implications and
responses. Similar to campaign ﬁnance laws, it may be
that data use in elections needs regulatory oversight
thanks to its eﬀects on campaigning, governance and
privacy. Starting an empirically informed, critical dis-
cussion of data politics now may be the ﬁrst important
step in asserting our agency with respect to big data
that is generated by us and about us, but is increasingly
being used at us17.

e history of the Internet has demonstrated at
every turn that all attempts at controlling it have
engendered swift countermeasures to protect
netizens. In this regard connected intelligence on
and oﬀ line will prove eﬀective to defend civil
society. In activism it is important to know or
suﬃciently know about the other participants to
trust them. at present the obligation to connect
in the right way. Many applications exist already
to strengthen and sustain activism, but I have no
doubt that customised and democratised Big data
mining applications will soon give even more pow-
erful tools than anything invented so far. My general
trust (and thrust) is that in the end the Internet and
cyberspace will continue to self organize and eventu-
ally fashion all of society into a tolerable shape and
that the Civil Society extended and respected globally
will prove to be the only tolerable shape humanity
should strive for in the era of transparency.

I have taken the liberty to add a graphic and a few sug-
gestions that I gleaned on the net of tools for connect-
ing activists safely and intelligently. e graphic pre-
sents a very advanced articulation of the diﬀerent com-
ponents of collective intelligence. It is a fascinating read
and I propose a little exercise to make it even more fun:
in perusing the various categories that are proposed, I
suggest that wherever you see the word ‘collective’,
substitute it with ‘connective’ and judge which one
reﬂects better the need for connecting speciﬁc conﬁgu-
rations and relationships in a social activism project. 
CroWdVoICE ~ Similar to the social media aggregating
service Storify, but with an activist bent, CrowdVoice
spotlights all content on the web related to campaigns
and protests. What’s diﬀerent about it? founder
Esra’a al Shafei says “CrowdVoice is open and any-
one is a contributor. for that reason, it ends up hav-
ing much more diverse information from many

more sources.” If one online activist comes across a
spare or one-sided post, he can easily supplement
information. furthermore, campaign participants can
add anecdotes and ﬁrst-hand experiences so that oth-
ers can check in from afar. CrowdVoice makes it easi-
er for far-ﬂung audiences to stay abreast of protests and
demonstrations, but it also helps organizers coordinate
and stay abreast of other activist movements.
SuKEy ~ during london’s uK uncut protests this year,
police used a tactic called “kettling,” or detaining demon-
strators inside heavy police barricades for hours on end. In
response, uK uncut activists created a mobile app to help
one another avoid getting caught behind the barricades.
e tool, Sukey — whose motto is “keeping demonstra-
tors safe, mobile and informed” – helps people steer clear
of injuries, trouble spots and violence. Sukey’s combina-
tion of google Maps and Swiftriver (the real-time data
verifying service from the makers of ushahidi) also pro-
vides a way for armchair protesters to follow the action
from afar. users can use Sukey on a browser-based tool
called “roar,” or through SMS service “growl.”
off-ThE-rECord MESSAgIng (oTr) ~ A software hat can
be added to free open-source instant messaging plat-
forms like pidgin or Adium. on these platforms,
you’re able to organize and manage diﬀerent instant
messaging accounts on one interface. When you then
install oTr, your chats are encrypted and authenticat-
ed, so you can rest assured you’re talking to a friend.
CrABgrASS ~ A free software made by the riseup
tech collective that provides secure tools for social
organizing and group collaboration. It includes
wikis, task ﬁles, ﬁle repositories and decision-
making tools. on its website, Crabgrass describes
the software’s ability to create networks or coali-
tions with other independent groups, to generate
customized pages similar to the facebook events
tool, and to manage and schedule meetings,
assets, task lists and working documents. e
united nations development programme and
members from the Camp for Climate Action
are Crabgrass users.
pIddEr ~ A private social network that allows
you to remain anonymous, share only encrypted
information and keep close track of your online
identity – whether that identity is a pseudonym
or not. While it’s not realistic to expect anyone
to use it as his primary social network, pidder is a
helpful tool to manage your information online.
e firefox add-on organizes and encrypts your
sensitive data, which you can then choose to
share with other online services. It also logs infor-
mation you’ve shared with external parties back
into to your encrypted pidder account.

2 Another angle on the meaning of intelligence comes
from roy Ascott’s suggestion that the brain is not an organ
that produces consciousness, but one that perceives it, just as
the eye does not produce vision but perceives the visual
object. is bold and interesting hypothesis implies that
consciousness is not internal to the body but available every-
where and that diﬀerent types of bodies are equipped with
diﬀerent types of cognitive apparatuses. of course there is
no scientiﬁc proof of that hypothesis and it may not even
have an immediate bearing on the nature of intelligence.
however it begins to be useful when it is related to tech-
nology. Taking the example of the eye, glasses help to
reﬁne the precision of vision. In the same way, ICT tech-
nologies might be deemed to help improve and share
access to matter and awareness.

tion, a ﬂexible architecture permits online social systems to form
organically and not as colonies of their oﬄine equivalents”

the capacity by which we can achieve
more together than we can alone. 
ere are many deﬁnitions and nar-
ratives of collective intelligence, many ways col-
lective intelligence is thought to form and man-
ifest, many contexts in which it is invoked.
here are a few, jumbled up.
Collective intelligence arises, as a network of
trust, from the empathy, the love and the com-
passion we have for each other. It is found in
the synergy of cognition and skills that enables
us to achieve great things when we collaborate.
We see it at work in the responsibility we grant
ourselves for stewarding the Earth that we have
in custody. It manifests when the individual pow-
ers that enable us to take our destinies in our own
hands aggregate into a collective power to change
the world and take part in our shared evolution.
We describe it as the global brain formed by the
distributed intelligence of our interconnected
human minds operating as a neural network,
embodied in Chardin’s noosphere. We see it
also as the symbiotic connection between all
living beings epitomized in lovelock’s gaia
hypothesis, each of us united through the
wider system of things, with a role to play in
the greater order of the universe.

ere has been a crescendo through time in our
capacity to individuate and to interconnect, in
the scope of our collective intelligence and in the
potential we see in it, augmented by technology. 
Internet and digital technologies have given us
access to a whole wealth of knowledge and to writ-
ing capabilities that we could never have dreamt of
just a few decades earlier. new possibilities opened
up, to author and share our own stories and the
knowledge we produced with the world, and to dis-
cuss and make sense of these stories with our peers
and beyond. By further multiplying the capacities to
learn, produce, share, and dialog remotely we acquired
with alphabetical writing and subsequently the print-
ing press, information technology has undoubtedly
accelerated our capacity for collaboration and action.
But how ﬁt are we for leveraging our collective transfor-
mative potential and generating polycentric coherence at
the systemic level? What role can digital technologies and
automation play in helping achieve the promise of collec-
tive intelligence, and what are the challenges we face?

We are all diﬀerent, not only culturally but also cog-
nitively, as illustrated by the varieties of ways in
which we perceive and process information, and make
decisions. ese diﬀerences nurture our collective
strength because they provide a fertile and diverse
ground from which synergetic eﬀects can emerge. ey
are our weakness too, because of the diﬃculties we
experience to understand each other when we speak dif-
ferent languages and see reality through diﬀerent lenses.
We gather by aﬃnity in communities of practice around
social objects, i.e., the objects we choose to focus our
caring attention and our eﬀorts on, which may be peo-
ple, places, issues, resources, processes, or desired out-
comes. Social objects act as attractors and centres of
shared values, goals, action and experience. 
Collective intelligence has always existed within these
centres as an essential outcome and at the same time an
enabler of the co-individuation process that occurs as
people interact, and as they construct their own repre-
sentations of reality, shared meaning making schemes,
preferred story and process narratives, and associated
language, by which they reduce the perceived com-
plexity of their own context. We call this culture.

When individuals learn or interact, what they per-
ceive and remember from their lived experience
creates imprints at various levels in their individ-
ual and collective minds. Stiegler distinguishes
three types of imprints he calls retentions. primary
retentions are the most salient of our perceptions
that we select from moment to moment and
that combine in the ﬂow of our consciousness.
is ﬂow enriches the memories of our experi-
ences, i.e., our secondary retentions that act as
the ﬁlters or frame of reference through which
we select our primary retentions and categorize
what we perceive in a feedback loop. 
Vocabularies speciﬁc to communities of shared
practice and experience derive from shared sec-
ondary retentions and the practice of shared
categorization and interpretation. 
Tertiary retentions are the layers of conscious
and unconscious sedimentations as externalized
tracks of collective knowledge and memory
accumulated through shared practice and expe-
rience and transmitted across generations. 
In addition to diﬀerences in what we focus our
attention on and the ﬁlters we use to process what
we retain, diﬀerences in how we mentally select and
process information also play an important role. 
What we perceive is categorized, interpreted and
reconstructed in relation to what we know and
how we understand. understanding is the process
of perceiving and categorizing. What we know is
what we have understood. Interpreting is how we
process and make sense of what we have under-
stood, individually and collectively.
As part of his work on psychological types, Jung
distinguished the four mental functions of sen-
sation, intuition, thinking and feeling and the
two attitude types of introversion and extraver-
sion that diﬀerentiate cognitive processing pref-
erences of individuals, and the dynamics by
which they operate. We focus our attention and
gather information (i.e., select our primary
retentions) with a variable propensity for sens-
ing or intuiting (the perceiving functions), and
we organize our experiences and make decisions
(i.e., categorize via our secondary retentions)
with a variable propensity for thinking or feeling
(the judging – interpretative functions). ese
functions plays out predominantly for each of us
either in the ‘introverted’ inner world of our
thoughts, feeling, memories and imagination, or
in the ‘extraverted’ outer world of actions, people,
tools and organization. 
Individuals perceive and interpret experience diﬀer-
ently as a result of diﬀerent combination of mental
functions and diﬀerent individual and collective
retentions, with variable inclinations for exploration
and ways of integrating the new. new signals that we
cannot categorize and interpret because we cannot
relate them to anything we know individually or col-
lectively may be left out unseen or perceived as threats.
is may hinder our capacity as individuals or groups
to understand, recognize and relate to logics that we are
not familiar with. 
e range of cognitive processing types of a group
emerges from a combination of individuals’ processes at
wider scales. Acknowledging and leveraging the comple-
mentarity of individual cognitive processes helps maxi-
mize cognitive eﬀectiveness of a group. 
Achieving cognitive understanding within a cohesive
group logic is easier than achieving cultural understand-
ing across logics, which Stiegler calls regions of the
logos or relational disciplines. ese can be perceived as
islands, and collective intelligence as the bridges that
connect them.

e need for coordination arises because we are diﬀer-
ent. disregarding our diﬀerences will prevent us from

In the ancient Indian fable of the elephant
and the blind men, each blind man senses
a diﬀerent texture and imagines a diﬀerent
object. Individually, the blind men cannot
make sense of the whole elephant. It is
only when there is eﬀective communica-
tion among them, recognizing that they
will necessarily perceive diﬀerent things
depending on where they are and what
they sense and intuit, that they can begin
to realize what that beast really is. 
e challenge is to bring the reality or the
possibility of the elephant into each part,
so that it is the elephant that materializes as
a whole when all piece are described, and
not a set of unrelated parts. is is what
collective intelligence must achieve. is
means that we must invoke at the same
time what we know, and what we may be
individually missing. What it takes to ﬁnd
the complementary shapes one thing can
use with others to build new things involves
exploration and questioning, a playful mind
and approach that helps us let go of our
limiting assumptions and open up our
minds for the unknown. 
Argyris’ ladder of Inference reminds us
that our assumptions are formed through
the meaning we derive (via our secondary
retentions) from the data we select out of
real observable data and experiences (our
primary retentions), which are our own
interpretations of reality. What we infer
may be biased by the selection we make
and by the reinforcing eﬀect of our assump-
tions on our beliefs in a feedback loop.
double loop learning and walking each
other through our respective thinking, feel-
ing, sensing, intuiting processes and frames
of reference can help us discover and con-
nect our respective interpretations and
draw a broader picture of reality. e Johari
Window opens up on self-awareness and
shared discovery of the unknown, to
expand the boundaries of what we can per-
ceive and categorize, i.e. understand.

dialog with others, our frames of reference enrich
each other, we co-individuate in a more or less con-
vergent way. Trans-individuation occurs when both
the individual and the collective are transformed
through one another, akin to evolution of collective
or group consciousness, all boats rising at once from
where they are situated. at’s when minds open for
sparks to circulate and collide, creating new possibili-
ties and opportunities for the ongoing thrivability and
regeneration of the system.
Internet has increased our capacity to reach out or cross
over to other groups, it has made easier for the explorers
in each group to cross boundaries and cross-pollinate,
bringing and weaving the new into their respective
groups. It has created opportunities for people and groups
to swarm in informal networks, and enabled on-going
conversations across groups to allow for multiple-level
synchronizations to occur. Change agents and innova-
tors are increasingly aware of the need to coordinate
beyond their own perimeters of action, to operate syn-
ergies across movements outside of institutional coordi-
nation bodies. Calls to create networks of networks,
movements of movements, global citizen movements,
great transitions, big-shifts are multiplying. is is col-
lective intelligence becoming aware of itself and call-
ing itself to action. 
e temptation is great however to think one can
easily ‘coordinate’ global action across movements
by building cohesiveness and convergence. “Just
develop a shared vision” we hear often, “and build
a plan or get self-organized from there”. But trying
to reduce to a common denominator, to align or
to merge deeply imprinted and diﬀerentiated
frameworks of understanding and interpretation
does not work. you cannot deal with multiple
centres operating on diﬀerentiated logics as you
deal with cohesive ones. how can shared visions
and roadmaps be developed when the parties do
not share similar understandings of reality and
projections of the future, when they do not
speak the same language and when they may be
shaped by their own assumptions? We must
deal with a polycentric world. With no systemic
centre, no ‘central logic’, no ‘global eminent
position’ or legitimate vantage point in the sys-
tem that would allow a global view and a syn-
thesis between approaches, coordination is left
to the various groups all acting as individual cen-
tres, to ﬁnd coherence. is diﬃculty to ﬁnd
coherence was typically a problem brought up by
organizers of the occupy movement for example. 
e mobilization of collective intelligence at wider
systemic levels beyond the boundaries of our habit-
ual communities to solve wicked interconnected
problems involves more complex mechanisms and
in particular the capacity to achieve more complex
synergies (i.e., systemic coherence) across multiple
centres in addition to ‘simple’ local synthesis (i.e.
complexity reductions) within cohesive centres of
shared experience.
is requires an expansion of our capacities to
meaningfully relate to each other, to under-
stand our position in the bigger picture, to per-
ceive and mutually recognize our respective
logics and space for engagement, and to ﬁnd
and interpret the signals and tracks our actions
leave in the system and the environment as
feedback and feedforward that will inform fur-
ther interpretation and action. 
Achieving coherence involves tools and processes
that can facilitate self-coordination of multiple
approaches at many levels and scales, in addi-
tion to building cohesion through facilitation
methodologies within deﬁned contexts.

e multitude of pathways humanity engages
into to make the world a better place are a mani-
festation of collective intelligence, not yet aware
of itself, as illustrated by this quote of Edgar
Morin in La Voie: “On each continent and in each
nation one can ﬁnd creative bubbling, a multitude of
political initiatives in the direction of economic, social,
political, cognitive, educational, ethical or existential
regeneration. But everything that must be connected is
yet dispersed, compartmented, separated. ese initia-
tives are not aware of each other, no institution enumer-
ates them, and no one is familiar with them. ey are
nonetheless the livestock for the future. It is now a matter
of recognizing, aggregating, enlisting them in order to
open up transformational paths. ese multiple paths
jointly developing will intermesh to form a new Path
which will decompose into the paths each of us will follow
and which will guide us toward the still invisible and
unconceivable metamorphosis.” (Tr. finidori).
e tracks are there. how can we ﬁnd and interpret
them? operationalizing collective intelligence involves
being able to see the diversity of transformations at play
and evolution in the making, how we contribute to this
process, and where it is taking us. 
Exponential computation power and visualization
tools allow real time presentation of globalized data.
location and behaviour tracking tools, the Internet
of things and mobile technology enable the harvest-
ing of the micro-local and the connection of micro
and macro levels.

global outcome or picture and has an impact; and
vice versa, how large transformations, or large out-
comes are made of combined individual actions or
items. A catalyst for agency.
Tools that can show us the dynamics of our system
and the tracks we leave in it, that can help us discern
and discuss how our behaviours aggregate and impact
the system, technologies that can act as a mirror for
our own actions and map out what we chart together
in collaborative or self-coordinated ways all have the
capacity to bolster collective intelligence because they
provide the individual and collective feedback that will
impulse our next individual and collective actions. e

a promising potential to achieve this through peer-to-
peer connections.

our actions shape the tracks we leave in our environ-
ment which in return inform our next actions. is is
not without implications. A key question is what we
want our mirrors to be, how distributed, diﬀerentiat-
ed and resilient they are, and who is susceptible of
controlling them.
In his research on stigmergy and the global Brain,
francis heylighen describes how the environment
he calls the medium is shaped by agents as their
tracks aggregate and consolidate, up to a point
where the medium becomes the mediator that
directs the agents. e pheromone trace for
example, that ants leave on the ground for others
to ﬁnd their way to food sources, attracts grow-
ing numbers of ants as the pheromone signal
strengthens with traﬃc. Similarly, cross-country
trails that start as barely distinguishable walk-
paths make themselves more visible as people
travel them. Eventually they become persistent
roads and highways that funnel all traﬃc. e
medium develops intelligent management of
the communication process, as heylighen
notes, which retains the ﬁttest and most useful
pathways , while the others are abandoned. 
heylighen compares this selection process to
that of neural connections that continuously
develop when exercised, while those who don’t
are atrophied. is is indeed what determines
our various retentions, how our memories dis-
card what no longer is in use, and how specialized
capabilities develop. Individuals have the ability
however to choose which neural paths they exer-
cise, and they may decide to cultivate fewer or
more of their latent potentials. groups may choose
to develop complementary skill sets among their
members to anticipate future needs. Collective
intelligence is about unleashing humanity’s whole
latent potential and turning it into action. If some
neural pathways become or remain atrophied, pos-
sibilities become scarcer… Wouldn’t a global
brain want to exercise all of its neural pathways to
keep the plasticity and alertness necessary for its
own long-term adaptability and ﬁtness?
When the most travelled roads, at a certain point,
solidify as the dominant infrastructure, they
may become diﬃcult to escape from. is is
when, in more general terms, norms and struc-
tures take control over agency and choice. 
e threat of most travelled routes remaining
mechanically the most travelled is a point I raise
quite often. In an article in the last issue of the
journal, I suggest that our institutions are sys-
temically dysfunctional and our system as a
whole at risk because we get trapped in positive
feedback mechanisms that keep channelling
behaviours towards the same pathways with little
consideration for diversity and resilience, and
how eﬀects accumulate in time. We see these
mechanisms at work for example in the network
eﬀect that builds monopolies when critical thresh-
olds of audiences are reached, or in economics
when winning strategies over-attract massive mono-
culture behaviour, generating volatile and brittle sit-
uations and outcomes. When a behaviour or a strate-
gy is acknowledged as the ﬁttest it becomes a best
practice, a benchmark, a standard, an institutionalized
model, embedded in the code, sometimes physically, in
the form of an algorithm that remains hidden from
view in a black box. e rate of application of such
winning or ﬁttest strategy, rather than the outcome it
produces, becomes the criterion for performance. And
there are no embedded mechanisms to evaluate whether
it remains ﬁt for purpose through time.
e diﬃculty to undo what has become solidiﬁed into
structure or coded into algorithm is what makes us dif-
ferent from ants. When the food source starts to dry up
ants seek new sources and the pheromone track dissi-
pates leaving room for new pathways to emerge.
human tracks are more persistent... As suggested by
heylighen, positive feedback that characterizes goal
oriented stigmergy is a great driver for both action and
outcome. is however only applies to the point when
the continued feedback destroys the function of the
medium and endangers the whole system. 
When we add the time factor, we realize it is not only
the medium, i.e., the space, that controls the agent
but a series of invisible power dynamics that alter the
nature of the track and the medium itself, locking
the agents in it. ese dynamics cannot dissipate if
they are not made visible, monitored for ﬁtness and
challenged over time.

is situation poses great threat to the system as a
whole precisely because it is a threat to collective
intelligence. Several risks are accumulating here. first
is the control power conferred to those who own and
maintain the infrastructure and attraction mecha-
nisms that enable the enclosure and lock in of huge
portions of collective intelligence. Second is the sur-
veillance and the mining of collective intelligence for
the beneﬁt of the few rather than of collective intelli-
gence itself. ird is the manipulation of collective
intelligence into herd behaviour and preselected choice
to the detriment of scope and variety, with the risk of
nipping collective intelligence ‘in the bud’ and prevent-
ing it to achieve its promises.

preserving the World Wide Web, the medium or
mediator and manager par excellence of our free (i.e.,
libre) peer-to-peer communication processes, from the
fate of the traditional media, owned by the few to
serve private interests is the challenge we face.
e world wide web was initially built in 1989 to
advance the diﬀusion of knowledge and collective
intelligence. And it has unlocked great opportunities
and expectations for self-realization and collective
accomplishment over the years. In 2005 david de
ugarte envisioned the beginning of a veritable
“reconquest of information and the imaginary as
collective and de-merchantilised creations”. Along-
side the fully decentralized blogosphere that would
enable the redistribution of informative power
among equipotential citizens, he foresaw, albeit
with some reservation, the proliferation of pluri-
archic, polycentric networks, able to provide
abundance thanks to network eﬀects. he called
the new kinds of monopolists such as google
Internet Mumis in reference to ancient benevo-
lent social animators of the Solomon Islands
who prepared communal feasts for the followers
they attracted. ese Internet Mumis although
centralized in their structure were meant to pro-
vide highly decentralized and diversiﬁed experi-
ences to their volatile and demanding member
base for free, generating new kinds of abundance.
is remains the current ultimate promise of the
platform model, which prompted paypal founder
peter iel to praise monopolies as drivers of
progress because the prospective of years or even
decades of monopoly proﬁts free of competition
provides a powerful incentive to innovate and oﬀer
the best possible experience to their users. out with
competition, blue ocean strategy at its best! ugarte’s
conjectures were before the advent of facebook, and
the propulsion of google at the apex of monetiza-
tion of our tracks. now, lock in eﬀects are engi-
neered via massive VC investment that expect no
returns before a status of monopoly is attained.
google purchases robotic startups at a blistering
pace, half a dozen within a year, most of which
involved in defence… 
Many signs show that the web itself is now
gradually being controlled by higher national
purposes or private interests as Snowden’s rev-
elations on nSA surveillance, the threats on net
neutrality, and the constant erosion of privacy
and Internet freedoms can attest. e web is
being owned by what Michel Bauwens calls
the netarchy, the giant platforms that both
enable and exploit the participatory networks
that arise from peer-to-peer activity.
generating convenience and the illusion of free-
dom and abundance for free needs funding, and
it seems that in their pursuit of enabling the mul-
titude, the giants of the web have sold their souls
to the devil, and we, the multitude, have sold our
souls to them. We are now trapped within the
walled gardens of gigantic platforms to which we
contractually abandon our privacy rights and the
tracks of our activity, in exchange for free access to
the tools that enable us to produce the tracks…

from agents of collective intelligence, we are becom-
ing objects of the intelligence, through manipulation
and surveillance. our tracks are recorded, collected
and aggregated through cookies by each service and
application we use. our individual and collective
behaviours are made available to state intelligence, sta-
tisticians, marketers, technologists and scientists, while
our access to the data we generate is local and limited.
how easy is it indeed for us to search elements of our
own past and retrieve the content we generated on
social networks?
We are told our tracks are disseminated and anony-
mous, yet so easily reconstructed via correlations, and
in our face! When I book an airplane ticket directly
from an airline’s website, an advertisement appears on
google or facebook for a car rental or a hotel in my
destination city. When I look up an illness on google
I get an advertorial for a treatment or a clinic on
facebook. When my husband watches a sports event
on my computer, I receive spams for young chick
dates… how diﬃcult is it for any of these platforms
and their partners to relate this to my proﬁle or my
Ip, and identify all my whereabouts, concerns, and
potential addictions and contradictions? We saw

our traces are analyzed in order to anticipate and aﬀect
any of our possible behaviours. e more we use plat-
form services, the more the various algorithms at work
learn about us for a ‘tailored’ experience. our tracks are
used to lure our attention, move us into action, and
make the most out of us not only through straight for-
ward advertisement but also through more reﬁned tech-
niques such as clickbaits, pushed selections, or dynamic
pricing. is ranges from prices for a given ﬂight
increased at each visit, all other things remaining equal,
to create some urgency for purchase, to the display of
higher price selections based on estimated purchase
power, such as orbitz proposing more expensive hotel
rooms to Apple oS users found to spend 30% more on
hotels than windows users. platforms are an excellent
playground to test new algorithms. uber’s pricing
algorithm has recently been praised by MIT tech
review as its best innovation. 
diﬀerentiation and self-realization were the promise
of the web, but we are manipulated into conver-
gence. our choices are inspired by algorithms that
serve us what our friends, our passed behaviours
and possible addictions, or other purchase pattern
and popularity statistics would suggest. Statistically
generated Amazon book recommendations or
google AdSense generated search suggestions
feedback into themselves and skew the statistics,
triggering self-generated winner takes all positive
feedback loops that impoverish choice even more

generated language that feeds back into google

the corpus originating initially from real transla-
tors’ work. A concern for google itself, referred

What was expected to liberate us from all forms of
enslavement is now keeping us captive as objects
of an experiment. We are lulled in a ﬁshbowl, kept
in a bubble that slows our collective evolution… 
Are we being bitten back even harder by what we
have been trying to get away from for decades?
Adam Curtis in his ‘Century of the self’ BBC docu-
mentary series masterfully depicted how psycho-
logical techniques had been used throughout the
20th century to read, create and fulﬁl the desires of
the public, and to make products and ideas as
attractive as possible to consumers and citizens.
In ‘All watched over by machines of loving
grace’ he showed how key strands of thought
that shaped the 20th century ethos had caused us
to embrace a fatalistic philosophy that sees
human beings as cogs in a mechanistic system,
as computing machines in their own right, or as
biologic organisms driven by their genes, help-
less and disillusioned in the face of those in
power, with no idea of what comes next or of
how to challenge and change the status quo.
e web was meant to remedy all this. how far
have we drifted away from the promise of what
could be unlocked by putting to good use what
Clay Shirky called our cognitive surplus: the
time that we gained back from watching TV?
Stiegler likes to evoke systemic stupidity as time
of available brain accessible to those who try and
manipulate us. is quote of the CEo of a major
french TV channel is indeed memorable. 
« ere are many ways of talking about television.
But in a business context, let’s be realistic: basically,
TF1’s job is to help Coca-cola, for example, to sell its
product […]. However, for an advertisement to be
perceived, it is necessary that the brain of the spectator
should be available. e role of our programs is to make
it available: i.e. to entertain it, to relax it in order to
prepare it between two messages. What we sell to Coca-
cola is some time of available human brain […]. Noth-
ing is more diﬃcult than obtaining this availability.
ere lies the permanent challenge. It is necessary to seek
at all times the programs that will ﬁt, to follow the latest
fashions, to surf on the trends of the moment, in a context
where information accelerates, multiplies and gets more
pervasive ». patrick le lay (Tr. Bruno, C.).
We are caught in a faustian bind. on the one hand we
are seduced by the convenience of the tools that enable
us to make our voices heard and to connect and
exchange with the world. on the other hand, we are
under the microscope, we hardly beneﬁt from the
insights this aggregated data could provide us, and we
remain at the merci of various forms of stimulations
based on projections that keep us captive of our exist-
ing habits and anticipated desires, and nudge us
towards sameness.

under which collective intelligence can overcome
collective stupidity that he deﬁnes as herd behav-
iour or groupthink, with a ﬁne line to draw between
the two. he frames the question pertaining to col-
lective intelligence research in the following terms:
How can people and computers be connected so that –
collectively – they act more intelligently than any person,
group or computer has ever done before?”
for Stiegler any technology is potentially disruptive and
toxic. digital technologies as automation techniques
constitute a pharmakon. A pharmakon like any remedy
can save a patient or kill him if mishandled or overdosed.
It is potentially curative and beneﬁcial, or dangerous if
not implemented according to speciﬁc requirements. A
pharmakon as deﬁned in plato’s Phaedrus dialogues is
what produces an extension of knowledge and capabilities
into an external milieu that can be manipulated. 
Collective intelligence is the manipulated matter, and
also the safeguard against manipulation. To ensure its
own survival and long-term thrivability, collective intel-
ligence must focus above all on preserving and enhanc-
ing the opportunities provided by digital technologies
and the web for its own coalescence. It must strive to
maintain the integrity of its collective perceiving and
interpreting functions, and be aware of the risks of its
being absorbed and annihilated by all kinds of
manipulators often referred to as ‘the system’ itself
because of the systems dynamics they may initiate or
perpetuate, through the manipulation of retentions
and behaviours.
It is critical that ‘we the people’ reclaim the owner-
ship of the web and the control of our stigmergetic
processes as commons or public goods before it is
too late. e capacity for analysis and interpreta-
tion of the dynamics that aﬀect our behaviours,
and the tracks they leave in the environment
must be kept free of all manipulation and pro-
tected as an instrument for collective intelligence
to help us ‘better ourselves’ and enhance our col-
lective problem solving capacity. 
people increasingly assemble and reassemble ad
hoc in networks of networks, around speciﬁc
projects that are usually issues based. gated
platforms, which enclose their users under leo-
nine terms and conditions are unsuitable to the
context of ﬂuid collaboration in variable
geometries, whose ground is the web itself. 
We need a web that empowers new forms of
connections and interactions across boundaries
to allow the creation of virtual spaces where pro-
jects, people, ideas, and resources distributed in
various contexts can be ‘pulled’ to accomplish
speciﬁc tasks and generate productive conversa-
tions leading to action. is involves a distributed
web, with portable identities, privacy protection
systems, as well as protection against cyber attacks
and fraud. It also requires tools and methodologies
to develop understanding and interpretation of
systemic phenomena and patterns of behaviours,
as well as mutual understanding of the logics
under which various community of experience
operate, to enable collective interpretations. 
open source communities, the World Wide
Web Consortium (W3C), in charge of web stan-
dards and protocols, and other organizations
are working to build empowering tools. Most
resources however are allocated to technologies
that are being developed behind closed doors.

Tools and methodologies that enable visualiza-
tion and interpretation of stigmergetic feed-
back at various levels and scales, where possi-
bilities can be explored, gaps identiﬁed, needs
fulﬁlled, and impacts assessed, enabling agency
to apply itself eﬀectively, would be particularly
useful. here are some examples and visions.
At the micro level, Bret Victor suggests the cre-
ation of environments that nurture ideas, where
we could see what is produced, at work, in its con-
text, while it is produced. As creators we need an
immediate connection to what we create, to see the
eﬀect of our changes immediately. We need to ﬁnd
new medium that can “listen to our hands as we cre-
ate”, so that we can unlock the pieces that are locked
in our heads and nurture the ideas that must be
grown, individually and collectively. To illustrate this
in practice Victor created a program that shows the
immediate rendering of code as it is programmed. In a
similar line, olivier Auber’s poietic generator aggre-
gates side-by-side drawings from multiple connected
users, making the collective picture that continuously
emerges visible to all in real time, as it is created.
At the macro-level, Jean françois noubel introduced the
concept of holopticism where “each player, thanks to
his/her experience and expertise, relates to the whole in
order to adjust his/her actions and coordinate them with
others’ moves. erefore there is an unceasing round
trip, a feedback loop that works like a mirror between
the individual level and the collective one.” 
With anopticism, olivier Auber brings the nuance
that there is also always an invisible architecture,
which inﬂuences and determines our behavioural
choices. Anopticism questions the idea of totality of
a space and of objectivity of its representation, insist-
ing instead on the arbitrary and subjectivity of the
many points of view of which everyone is potential-
ly an author, and the actor of the rules and codes

they generate. It postulates that the collective intelli-
gence of a group can develop only when each mem-
ber of the group has access to at least one form of
representation of the group’s activity, when this rep-
resentation is considered legitimate by everyone,
and when each member can situate him/herself in
this representation and can therefore change
his/her situation through action. 
Both the holoptic and the anoptic systems are a mod-
elled representation of the space in which the actors
evolve, which involves dealing with intersubjectivity
and the connections between representations, in
opposition to foucault’s panopticon where one
agent observes all the others without their knowing
(the situation we are increasingly ﬁnding ourselves
in right now on private platforms). 
In a poetic intervention, Bracha Ettinger talks of
borderspaces at the junction of things, of border-
links created via ﬂuctuation of distance in prox-
imity to create relations without relationships,
where diﬀerent Is and non-Is co-emerge, and are
transformed, sharing new and old, by imprinting
and engraving their traces in shareable threads,
creating trans-subjective relationships. 
linked data and the semantic web would enable
navigation of this in between possibility space,
bringing to life the ‘adjacent possible’ proposed by
Struart Kaufman: “e strange and beautiful truth
about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow
as you explore them. Each new combination opens up
the possibility of other new combinations. ink of it
as a house that magically expands with each door you
open. You begin in a room with four doors, each lead-
ing to a new room that you haven’t visited yet. Once you
open one of those doors and stroll
into that room, three new doors
appear, each leading to a brand-
new room that you couldn’t have
reached from your original starting
point. Keep opening new doors
and eventually you’ll have built a
palace.” Steve Johnson.
Imagine if our various logics,
vocabularies, and narratives,
what Stiegler calls the regions
of the logos could be mapped
by degree of familiarity or
closeness with each other, cre-
ating an impressionistic map of
the possibility domain, where
people could explore the
unknown from what is familiar,
and navigate by successive hops
through our traces from one
possibility to another to ﬁnd
meaning in the unknown and discover new
worlds and broaden horizons, in productive
debates and conversations.

e generative potential of conversations around social
objects and issues that attract individual intentions into
collective eﬀort could be leveraged through emergent
conversation-to-action spaces that support the harvest-
ing and reprocessing of conversations directed towards
argumentation, problem solving and action, i.e. learning
by doing. Eu funded project Catalyst is developing a suite
of collective intelligence tools aimed at increasing the
eﬀectiveness of conversations, and support collective
ideation, decision and action. loomio focuses on collec-
tive decision making in ways that foster debate. ese
emergent conversations spaces should support tools to
pull, visualize and navigate contextualized data such as
described above, analyzed and interpreted with the sup-
port of pattern recognition methodologies and pattern
languages. ey should also be able to attract stakeholders
and relevant parties into conversation or debate and
action. A direction taken by the french Assemblé
Virtuelle with the creation of ecosystems of actors, ideas,
projects and resources, based on technologies of the
semantic web. is ﬁts John hagel’s deﬁnition of the
scalable pull platform “where we can draw out the peo-
ple and resources that we need, when we need them
and where we need them”.
Such emergent spaces would support the project of
the digital Studies research group working in

cooperation with the Institute for research and
Innovation (IrI) at the Center georges pompidou
in paris and the W3C chaired by Tim Berners lee,
founder of the web, to reinstate the web as a distrib-
uted space for hermeneutics and controversy with

tution of communities of curators of the web, with

gaining more insight on the dynamics at play in the sys-
tem beyond the evaluation of spatial tracks and status of
the system, is critical. In particular we need to acquire
capabilities to examine the dynamics that lock us into
structures that are unﬁt and detrimental to the thriv-
ability and renewal of the system through time. A lan-
guage of collective intelligence could develop in the
form of a web of pattern languages that could help
make sense of situations and phenomena in various
‘regions of the logos’ and design appropriate solu-
tions. A meta-pattern language (this denomination is
not cast in bronze) could provide abstract elemen-
tary components as building blocks, common to
‘local’ interpretative languages. is meta-pattern
language would concentrate on systemic phenome-
na and their eﬀects in space and time, to help rec-
ognize and interpret our systemic tracks in
dynamic ways, in connection with the data visu-
alization and discovery tools described above. 
A group of us is working to launch such meta-
pattern language, as an open source visual lan-
guage we called plAST (pattern language for sys-
temic transformation), based on systemic inter-
pretation. e language is made of elementary
components that will help decompose and
recompose observed or intended patterns of sys-
temic behaviour into ‘human computable’
sequences that can be probed, to evaluate possi-
bilities. e goal is to design and monitor the
dynamics we generate by our activity in a way
that is regenerative of commons in their widest
deﬁnition, as factors of thrivability and renewal
of the system. 
We envision it as a symbolic code for sharing per-
ceptions and interpretations of relations, eﬀects and
potentials, looking for tracks in what we ‘observe’ in
the logic of our own realities and shared experiences,
and in relation to higher levels of aggregation and
integration. Visuals allow direct representations of
sequences and combinatory without the ‘baggage’,
whether discipline-related, ideological, or cultural
etc, that words can bring. It is a tool aimed at work-
ing across boundaries to generate discussions and
debate on systemic phenomena and their eﬀects
and what can be done about them. e concep-
tion of the plAST will be based on observations of
dynamics and eﬀects in diﬀerent scenarios by
communities of practice, contrasted and integrat-
ed with known and documented dynamics and
eﬀects from various disciplines such as Complex-
ity theory and complexity economics, network
theory, cognitive sciences, Systems dynamics
and Systems inking, natural Systems, Mathe-
matics, and more.
All these tools and applications of technology are
ways of operationalizing collective intelligence
towards the safeguard of our capacity as humans
assisted by machines, but humans nonetheless, to
perceive and interpret the tracks that we leave in
the medium, and ensure the protection, the nur-
turing and the reproduction of the distributed fac-
tors of opportunity and of ongoing health and
thrivability of the system. let’s concentrate on
building them in good collective intelligence!

boat, we can see a school of ﬁsh, each one
independent of the other, and yet the
school as a whole morphs and changes form as
the entire collective moves as one. likewise, we
see birds in ﬂocks ﬂying in the skies, each bird
an independent entity but the entire ﬂock
seems to have a collective intelligence that oper-
ates as a unit. herds of animals-sheep, wolves,
cows, for example, behave in much the same way,
each creature having separateness, but ﬂowing
along with the collective as if there is intelligence
outside of any one creature, even as each creature
has its own autonomy. 
Collective intelligence seems to be a product of
nature itself, arising with the earliest of mobile life
then evolving in and through humanity, from
tribal and mythic collectives, through contextual
and systemic collectives, through causal collectives.
ese two forms, the individual and the collective,
seem to be in a rocking chair relationship. Some-
times the individual sense of self seems to be fore-
grounded and sometimes the collective appears to be
the primary entity. is very rocking back and forth
seems to contribute to the energy of individual and
collective evolution itself (o’fallon, 2013).
Because of the evolutionary aspects of collective expres-
sion, some deﬁnitions are in order. We know that
humans are diﬀerent than a school of ﬁsh, a ﬂock of
birds or a pack of wolves, our evolutionary predeces-
sors. What we have discovered about collective con-
sciousness in humans is that it has some of the same
qualities as our earlier forms, but one that up shifts
from concrete, through subtle through causal con-
sciousness and intelligence. We want to highlight the
latest form of collective intelligence that we are experi-
menting with, Collective Causal Consciousness, but it
is important to situate this experience within the tra-
jectory of the evolution of consciousness itself.

the earliest collectives that form are related to the

precedence over the independence of the individual
in what we call concrete collectives. Concrete collec-
tive intelligence revolves around shared rules, which
are projected outwardly on everyone; and each indi-
vidual introjects those rules as their unquestioning
identity. us each person represents a human expres-
sion of a bird in a ﬂock for they can move within the
collective human ﬂock but not outside of it, and the
collective intelligence is concrete, based on strict behav-
ioural rules. Individual behaviour is back-grounded to
these collective norms and the result is uniform confor-
mity (o’fallon, 2008).
Subtle Collective Intelligence: A subtle collective is deﬁned
as a context, or a system. here, one begins to feel the
shared subtle energy with and between participants, feel-
ing the eﬀect of that collective energy “forming” them as
individuals. later they realize that they themselves are a
part of projecting their own subtle energies and behav-
iours, beliefs, etc into the collective, even as they are
introjecting these very energies, subtle behaviours and
beliefs into themselves; they can begin to see how they
have an eﬀect on these contexts and systems even as the
systems and contexts have an eﬀect on their own indi-
vidual subtle shape and identity. Subtle collective
intelligence is a very advanced and profound, connec-
tive and energetic experience in which individual
knowing seems sourced from contextual subtle ener-
gies, and intuition (o’fallon, June 2010). 
Causal Collective Consciousness: is is a rare form
of collective consciousness, which we have been
experimenting with for the past ten years at paciﬁc
Integral in our generating Transformative Change
program. To understand causal collective intelli-
gence, we need to deﬁne the word “Causal”, for
it has many diﬀerent connotations. “Causal” is
often deﬁned as an individual attainment, allud-
ing to emptiness, illusion, very subtle, and/or
the constructing nature of the individual mind
that makes up stories, words and boundaries
which are ever changing, and thus are ﬂeeting
and illusionary. Each mind-made fabrication is
essentially seen as empty, to be replaced later
by another one. us, the evolutionary thrust
is experienced in each moment with the real-
ization that nothing concrete or subtle is per-
manent, and a ﬂow through time and space is
experienced resulting in the empty but fertile
potential. like concrete and subtle intelligence,
this is ﬁrst experienced as a “state” – i.e., it is a
temporary realization that can be experienced all
along the path of evolution. us, anyone can
participate in Causal Collective intelligence as a
temporary state, which matures into a permanent
stage that one can walk around with as an ordinary
part of existence. is is the individual expression
of causal consciousness (T. o’fallon, fitch, g. , &
ramerez, V., 2011). 
A stabilized conscious causal collective begins to
arise when enough individuals walk around with
individual causal recognition and expression and
share a collective experience and understanding
of how they can source from this inﬁnite causal
intelligence, inﬂuencing concrete and subtle
collective intelligence by collectively accessing
the causal ﬁeld of existence – that is, they begin
to “causalize” the former, unbending subtle-
contextual-systems and concrete community
expressions that they have lived within. ese
communities tend to release the subtle ceilings
that hold people in place and give space for
the individuals within them to soar in their
individual causal expressions seated in and
arising out of this empty creative potential of
the inﬁnite causal ground.

Imagine sitting in a board meeting or legislative
session in which every individual has entered the
meeting having released all narrow personal and
political agenda, in favour of what is best for the
good of the whole of existence. Each person and the
whole group remain present, with a clear, vast, and
pure openness, empty of bias through the entire
meeting, receiving and exchanging information, egos
not attached to personal will or agenda. Each and all
remain open, bringing forth the best in each, in service
to the individuals, the organization and the whole of
humanity, of sentience and of existence, past, present
and future. roughout the meeting each person is
energized, creative and engaged, oﬀering his or her par-
ticular skills and gifts fully. e clear, open, spaciousness
of awareness is palpably present, individually and collec-
tively, so that ideas and other subtle forms of contribu-
tion ﬂow freely. All individuals move in and out of lead-
ership spontaneously, stepping up when their particular
natural skills, knowledge and experience are required (r.
Kegan, lahey, l., 2014). rough a willingness to surren-
der attachments to speciﬁc outcomes while remaining
present to the intended results of a collective vision, the
individuals simultaneously experience an infusion, dis-
tinction and integration of agency and communion,
unleashing unique creative potential in service to the
whole. likewise, the collective serves each individual,
aﬃrming and supporting each person to bring his or
her best skills forward. When conﬂicts arise they are
faced honestly, with an understanding that there is a
deeper truth required in order to move forward, usu-
ally a truth that considers the wellbeing of a larger

perspective or larger whole. e result is a spacious
and open ﬁeld for collective intelligence and collec-
tive causal consciousness to arise and oﬀer up the best
that humanity can oﬀer itself in thought, word and
deed. (ramirez, 2013)
After the meeting, each person is energized to con-
tribute their skills and experience toward the next
steps of a clariﬁed, collective purpose and vision;
aware of the signiﬁcant role they play in actualizing
that vision. is organization is one that eﬀortlessly
attracts the highest calibre of professionals who are
skilled, conscious, compassionate, and desire to con-
tribute ethically to the future of our planet. e atmos-
phere is one of mutual respect, mutual care and a desire
to work well together to produce original and high
quality products and services for the good of all.

e willingness to release personal will and agenda into
an empty spacious ﬁeld of awareness (ramirez, 2013;
Scharmer, 2007) is the ﬁrst and necessary action in this
process. Most people can learn how to enter a state of
Causal Awareness over time, and some have developed
the capacity to live from this level of awareness as a
baseline (o’fallon, 2012). A facilitator who has stabi-
lized this stage of awareness may remind everyone to
empty their awareness into a deep, interpenetrating
silence that pervades the entire ﬁeld of individual
and collective consciousness. people speak only
when moved by a deeper impulse, on behalf of the
whole, becoming a clear conduit for the transmis-
sion of wisdom, innovation and reason. e
words are spoken through the resonance of the
heart, from the clarity of vast open awareness,
embodied through the uniqueness of the human
who is speaking, yet spoken on behalf of all of
existence. e words ring true with visionary,
inspired realism based on that person’s particular
gifts and areas of expertise and yet not limited by
those constraints. her words inspire another
voice to speak for the whole, and another, until
the conversation is alive with engaged potential
and excitement, where no one and everyone are
responsible for the experience and results, both
in the presence of the room and for the emerg-
ing outcome. is meeting evokes and invites
the best within each individual in terms of per-
sonal gifts and resources on all levels, and pro-
vides fertile ground for collective expansion, stim-
ulation and wakefulness within the particular
team of collaborators. 
e collaboration of hearts, minds and conscious-
ness on behalf of the collective well being of exis-
tence brings a new sensibility and order to priorities
and values. ese individuals and collectives can see
more clearly global systems, structures, institutions
and individuals who are both preventing and creat-
ing greater health, well-being and aliveness. from
this place of clarity and openness, using all of the
resources at their disposal, they begin to create new
structures and re-order current, usable structures,
systems, and processes that work for all of life, not
just for their organization, but for a universal
embrace that encompasses as much as awareness
can hold. e transcultural human virtues (ray,
2010) of compassion, generosity, humility, service,
gratitude, beauty, truth and justice with universal
care (gilligan, 1993; r. Kegan, 1994) for the
largest embrace imaginable (the entire planet
and beyond) are foundational assumptions of
everyone in this leadership collective.
rough Causal Collective Intelligence, unimag-
ined resources and possibilities seem to appear
out of nowhere through the inﬁnite portal that
is revealed through this collective consciousness
and willingness to receive. Individuals in these
collectives are energized, passionate, creative,
happy, engaged, eﬃcient and productive; and
the collective itself becomes an attractor for oth-
ers who are awake to this capacity for causal col-
lective consciousness. We have seen these results
bear out repeatedly in our causal leadership pro-
grams on three continents and among the staﬀ of
our own company. globally engaged individuals in
and from Ethiopia, Kenya, Australia, new zealand,
India, Iran, Turkey, Ireland, the united Kingdom,
Mexico, peru, france, palestine, Kosovo, norway,
Canada and the uS have cultivated causal collective
consciousness. Because the best in each individual is
permitted and called forth in relation to the whole,
they are more uniquely themselves, more emotionally
and relationally adept, and collectively more creative,
productive and aware. ey then take this learning and
these skills into their own communities, cities and
nations, inspired to impart this same innovative poten-
tial to as many people as possible.
Imagine a world in which our corporate and political
leaders have the willingness, desire and capacity to act
on behalf of the whole of existence. Causal collective
consciousness oﬀers us this potential.

In our experience in working with causal collectives
and collective intelligence, we have identiﬁed several
areas of practice that support their development. 
To open and build a causal ﬁeld in a collective,
facilitation is needed to build the foundation. To

promote a causal ﬁeld it is necessary to have indi-
viduals in the ﬁeld who embody the causal aware-
ness of awareness, who identify with and express the
causal Self, and who have permission and agency to
shape the container. rough a variety of practices,
injunctions and expressions the collective is drawn
into causal states and eventually into identiﬁcation
with these states and ultimately to a degree of self-
generativity with them.
on the surface, this work is similar to an experience
one might ﬁnd in sitting meditation with others, but
this is only the beginning. our work is oriented towards
“bringing meditation into life” in the sense that the
capacity to embody and hold a causal awareness is sus-
tained not just in mediation practice, but in the midst
of all actions of life, as we relate, work, collaborate,
communicate, and so on. is requires us to step into
the next territory of practice, which involves developing
causally grounded facility in the concrete and subtle
territories. Causal collectives must be skilled in all
forms of collective work, physical, emotional, cognitive
in a way that allow the mind and heart to stay open to
the deeper, empty ground as we work and play in
those dimensions. As an example, in gTC and in our
organization, we work deeply with authentic com-
munication and intimacy, with projection and intro-
jection, and emotional intelligence, so that as chal-
lenges arise they can be processed skilfully. 
As participants gain the capacity to be aware of the
empty and still ground in themselves, in each
other, and in all of existence while being in com-
munity, they begin to work with the concrete,
subtle and causal territories dynamically, moving
through form to emptiness, to a sense of the
empty/full All, that is and includes everything,
and from that ground they learn to let come
deeper forms of direction and knowing. is
process involves a kind of movement through a
u process (Scharmer, 2007), by opening the
mind to all concrete experience without judg-
ment, opening the heart to all subtle experi-
ence without separation or cynicism, and let-
ting go free of fear into what wants to move us
to higher expression. participants ﬁrst practice
this individually, then as a collective, and even-
tually learn to continually return to the empty
ground together allowing a deeper intelligence
to emerge through them. Since conventional
images and practices around collaboration are
deep habits, no matter how evolved one’s aware-
ness is, awareness tends to narrow when the
body and mind are in motion. us, ongoing
practice and learning are important.
one of the essential capacities that supports this
movement is working skilfully with habits of sep-
aration and identiﬁcation that arise in the subtle
ego. e self and collective are formed in the mind
and may go through a variety of re-incarnations,
moment to moment, as we construct and re-con-
struct our sense of what is. We can become col-
lectively aware of how we conceive of ourselves
in every moment and let go into more ﬂuid,
interpenetrative forms of being. Working on
multiple levels at once, causal collectives engage
in a kind of meta-reﬂection as needed to iden-
tify the stories, constructs, and autopoietic pat-
terns that shape themselves and the collective.
Individuals learn to take action and speak in
causal collectives with the explicit knowledge
that while their words and actions my come
from them, they don’t own them and that
anyone else in the collective might have just as
easily spoken them. 
over time, practice supports the deepening of
our collective consciousness, action and wis-
dom. We bring forth in our work an evolu-
tionary developmental perspective that spans
birth to enlightenment (T. o’fallon, 2011) and
recognizes the extraordinary diversity of per-
spective and embodiment that can occur even in
the smallest of collectives. We seek to seed this
understanding in causal collectives so they can
deepen into a wide view of who they are and what
their potential is, and to engage in their own evo-
lutionary potential and developmental movement.
We work to support the immanent joy that is the
human potential in each individual and collective,
deepening love, moral sense, ethical action, play,
wonder, humour, all of which serve the opening into
collective intelligence, as the one consciousness lives
in ecstasy and the delight of being, and is each one’s
birth right. We support the collectives to gain greater
and greater autonomy and self-generativity, by allow-
ing them to take greater steps on their own, embody
the practices that support their opening to the causal
ground and collective development. 
finally, causal collectives, like their participants, engage
in collaborative action in the world. We encourage
individuals and collectives to step into the world and
experiment with the promptings that call them. In doing
so, it is necessary to develop collaborative approaches
that support the level of complexity that exists at the
deeper territories of awareness that arise in the causal
states and stages. It is also essential to learn to com-
fortably act in the emergent, with limited concrete
knowledge and foresight. eory u (Scharmer, 2007)
begins to point to this potential, as emergent futures
take shape through experiments or prototypes. new
organizational frameworks (robertson, 2013) that
allow for the enactments of potential in complex
contexts without the need to fully map causes and
conditions are useful. In practice, this is acting from

a deep sense of purpose on limited knowledge
without a need for a master plan (while building on
every other practice we have mentioned). Addition-
ally, we have developed a model of leadership that
has become known as Causal leadership, (ramirez,
2013) which re-interprets leadership in light of an
understanding of individual and collective as deeply
interpenetrated, in which leadership can be and is pre-
sent in each “I” and “We” in any moment. Just like in
our endeavour to learn and master any new skill, the
development of causal collective consciousness takes
trust and a sense of humour, in addition to frameworks
and practices that support it.

In support of understanding the levels of collective
intelligence, paciﬁc Integral has ongoing longitudinal
research where each person in our cohorts are given a
developmental assessment, and then followed up every
two years. is research is now in its 10th year, follow-
ing over 200 people and 17 collectives from various
countries and all segments of society. Some of these
collectives have been tested and retested 5 times. e
results show that with the experience of our Causal
Intelligence experiment in our gTC program, indi-
vidual and collective intelligence continues to grow
of its own accord. is supports our premise that
causal collective consciousness is a compelling,
enlivening, engaging and deeply productive form
of awareness. Causal collective consciousness has
the potential to transform society and the world
as we know it.

you think you can solve? e signiﬁ-
cance of this inquiry became evident to
me during a visit to a uS agency respon-
sible for tens of billions of dollars of research for
the public good. I was invited to give a talk to
about 100 program managers overseeing this
research, on the importance of diversity in solv-
ing hard problems. To better understand their
world, I began with polling them on the per-
ceived problem diﬃculty of their portfolio, from
routinely easy to a grand challenge where experts
are in disagreement. What I learned shocked me.
none of the program managers believed they
were addressing the grand challenges in their
research area. 
Why is it that we are not taking on the challenges
that could really change the world? And if we knew
the answer to this question, what are the resources
that we are not embracing to address these chal-
lenges? ese are the questions I will address.

While the main goal in this article is to share my rev-
elations on new, possibly radical, approaches to solv-
ing the hard problems, we need an understanding of
why we’ve painted ourselves into a corner and possibly
feel trapped by our solution methods. What I learned
during my visit to the uS agency will likely be similar
to your experiences.
To understand if the program managers’ solution meth-
ods were limiting their choice of problems, I polled them
on the column headings in fIgurE 1. e ﬁrst three meth-
ods from the left are easily recognizable: a plumber ﬁxing
your drain, a plumber overseeing a team ﬁxing your sep-
tic system, and a group of experts remodelling your
home. e “Teams of experts” method is a common
approach to solve high complexity problems or
inquiries, for example, a national Academy of Science
study. “Teams of teams” method is when teams both
compete with each other and share common resources
and best practices. e “Advance collective methods”
approach is a catchall for the modern collective meth-
ods, such as crowdsourcing and prediction markets.
e program managers’ response was that 95% of
them used the ﬁrst three methods, with the large

majority using the ﬁrst two. e selection of the
methods on the left wasn’t because there weren’t
success stories on the right: one of the portfolios has
a “teams of teams” success story that has easily saved
1000s of lives worldwide and beneﬁted millions more. 
listed in the rows of fIgurE 1 are diﬀerent failure
modes of solution methods, with the following
descriptions. e failure mode of “Isolation” is from
not having access to suﬃcient information or skills to
solve the problem: if you had these resources, then you
could solve the problem. “herd thinking” is when
everyone in the group has the same contributions.
“group conﬂict” is when internal disagreements or con-
ﬂicts prevent a group from reaching a conclusion, even
though all the necessary resources are present to solve
the problem. “group ineﬃciency” is when a group deci-
sion process takes too long, relative to the time required
for a solution, even though there are no internal con-
ﬂicts and all the needed resources are present. group
ineﬃciency is a common failure mode for the dreaded
company meeting. “hitting the complexity barrier” is
when the individuals or group hit a barrier of diﬃcul-
ty that can’t be surmounted, where the problem is too
diﬃcult for the resources available. e complexity
failure mode depends on the problem diﬃculty and
is discussed in more detail shortly. e last row cap-
tures their perception on how much the diﬀerent
methods utilize diversity – no surprises here. 
I then asked the crowd to select the likely failure
modes that caused each solution method to fail,
based on their experiences. e darker the box and
number of checks indicate the greater the
response of the crowd. What stands out in these
crowdsourced responses is that some failure
modes tend toward the single expert side and
others favour the collective side. for example,
isolation failures favour the lone expert, but
ineﬃciencies favour the collective methods.
And, there are abrupt transitions and peaks:
group conﬂict failure rapidly increases and
peaks for the team of experts and then declines. 
from the viewpoint that experts are the best
resource to solve problems, I found these
results surprising. A team of experts should be
the optimal resource to solve a hard problem,
particularly a grand challenge. yet, if we sum
the failure checkmarks by columns, the team of
experts is most likely to fail, despite the pre-
ponderance of the expertise present. 
What can we conclude from these results?
Because this agency isn’t solving grand chal-
lenges, they are using the solution methods that
work best for their types of problems. But if they
wanted to solve a grand challenge from the per-
spective that experts are the best resource, they
perceive a failure barrier that limits the likelihood
of success. hence, they solve problems they think
they can solve, rather than problems they want to
solve. My experience as a citizen aligns with
these perceptions: our institutions do not
attempt to solve the grand challenges impacting
us all, mainly because we think they are unsolv-
able by the methods available, particularly in
the presence of biases and conﬂicts.

Collective intelligence (CI) is deﬁned as an out-
come where a collective solves a problem bet-
ter (typically more accurately) than the average
individual, and often better than any individ-
ual (the expert). CI captures the increased
intelligence from one level–the individual, to
another–a collective. e two levels can be an
individual within a group, a group within an
organization, an identity group within a society,
or even an information technology within an
information system.
As deﬁned, CI captures many forms of collective
decision-making, both the traditional ones of a
century ago, such as the smart outcome of a juried
decision or an election in a democracy, to modern
examples, such as an accurate outcome in a predic-
tion market or online recommender system. e sci-
ence of CI studies how diverse information is com-
bined to achieve a collective solution, using abstract-
ed or idealized models. e following summarizes the
highlights of mainstream science of CI research in
order to establish a foundation to expand the applica-
bility and capability of CI. readers will ﬁnd more
resources in other articles within this special issue on CI
and in the following references: a review of forty years of
research on collective processes in organizations
(Williams and o’rielly, 1996) that capture a traditional
view of diversity, particularly the challenges; the exten-
sive and self-consistent analysis by Scott page and his
collaborators (hong and page, 2001, page, 20051, page,
2007, hong and page, 2011, Shalizi, 2005), a review of
modern web-based collective decision methods (Watkins
and rodriguez, 2008); and how the Internet may ﬁnally
realize the full potential of the collective ideals of the
Age of Enlightenment (rodriguez and Watkins, 2009).
When individuals or groups solve problems, they use
diﬀerent preferences, biases, experiences, or heuristics
in their solution to the problem, thereby, introduc-
ing a collective diversity of solution approaches and
contributions. To be speciﬁc, we deﬁne collective
diversity, or just diversity, because diversity is a
property of the collective–not the individual, as an

aggregation of the expression of unique diﬀerences of
individuals relative to the group. 
Many CI model problems remarkably have in com-
mon two conclusions or observations that establish
the foundation of the science of CI:
~  e diversity factor: e greater the expression of
the diversity of the collective, the more accurate
the collective solution.
~  e individual ability factor: Individuals in the
collective must have a minimum degree of ability
in solving the problem in order for the collective
solution to be accurate. 
A major contribution of Scott page to the science
of CI is the proof that these two factors are quanti-
tatively coupled for certain types of problems
(page 2007, hong and page 2011), called the Diver-
sity Prediction theorem: Collective error = Average
individual error - Collective diversity.
e following observations illustrate the impor-
tance of this theorem. 1) As the diversity increas-
es, the collective error decreases, capturing the
importance of diversity in CI. 2) Because the col-
lective error cannot be negative, the contribution
of the collective diversity is bounded, or there is a
limit to the beneﬁcial eﬀect of diversity. 3) When
the average individual becomes an expert or the
problem is relatively simple and all individuals
solve the problem, then the average individual
error and the collective error go to zero, indepen-
dent of the level of diversity. ese qualitative rela-
tionships appear to hold for all CI problems and are
the foundation for the rest of this article.
To better appreciate the types and sources of diversi-
ty, consider the model problem I studied (Johnson,
1998): the solution of a maze (see
insert in fIgurE 2) by a group of
non-interacting, myopic indi-
viduals. note that the maze has
multiple optimal paths – two
are shown in fIgurE 2. To study
the problem, each individual
solves the maze with a set of
rules (heuristics) that eliminate
unproductive loops and dead
ends, but do not explicitly select
a short path (they don’t count
steps or have gpS). Although
each individual uses the same
heuristics, a diversity of prefer-
ences at a node are created,
because the myopic individuals
have no reason to choose initially
one path over another. When an
individual uses these learned
preferences to solve the maze
again, the loops are eliminated
and the individual path is short-
ened. for the collective, the preferences of a group
of individuals are combined, and the same individ-
ual heuristics provide the collective solution.
fIgurE 2 shows how collectives with larger numbers
solve the problem better than the average individ-
ual, demonstrating the diversity prediction theo-
rem, because diversity increases with the number of
individuals, while the average individual error is con-
stant. note that hong and page (2001) examined col-
lectives with diverse heuristics in a diﬀerent model
problem and found the similar conclusions. e rea-
son for the collective improvement in the maze study
is found to occur from the closure of unproductive but
unclosed loops in the individual solutions2. e collec-
tive curves with novice information in fIgurE 2 are based
on preferences that include the loops in the individual
solutions, while the established information results are
for preferences without the loops. Because the diversity
is lower for the collectives of novice individuals com-
pared to a collective with established individuals, the col-
lective error for the established group is lower, even
though the individual error is the same for both groups. 
ese results illustrate how the quality of information
that the individuals contribute to the collective can
aﬀect the collective solution: the novice preferences are
more “noisy” than the established preferences. e
study looked at many diﬀerent ways that the individual
can ﬁlter or modify their contributions to the collec-
tive, for example, selecting only the dominant prefer-
ence or providing all preferences with equal weighting,
and found that, except for ﬁltering the novice noise,
any reduction in an individual’s contribution caused
a decline in the collective performance. finally, and
the most remarkable, is that the collective always

ﬁnds one of the minimum paths, even though the
individual heuristics do not include any concept of a
shortest path. is is an example of an emergent solu-
tion and is a result of the individual heuristics and the
structure of the maze (White and harary, 2001). e
signiﬁcance of this for CI and grand challenges is dis-
cussed in a later section. 
While the above results are not controversial or
unexpected, there are additional CI model results
that are counterintuitive to most beliefs about col-
lective performance. one example is a study on the
CI of teams of diﬀerent individual performance
(hong and page, 2004, hong and page, 2011).
hong and page studied a hill-climbing problem
with many local maxima, and the goal was to
ﬁnd the optimal global maximum. What they
found was that diversity trumps ability: “[…]
when selecting a problem-solving team from a
diverse population of intelligent agents, a team of
randomly selected agents outperforms a team
comprised of the best-performing agents. is
result relies on the intuition that, as the initial
pool of problem solvers becomes large, the best-
performing agents necessarily become similar in
the space of problem solvers. eir relatively
greater ability is more than oﬀset by their lack
of problem-solving diversity.” hence, in this
model problem when experts optimize their
methods, they become similar, and therefore,
can be “trumped” by a diverse collective. for
later reference, we note that this problem does-
n’t capture our grand challenge deﬁnition where
experts disagree. 
e results of a related study that I did3 are even more
counterintuitive. Similar to hong and page (2004), I
found that a group of randomly
selected individuals of all perfor-
mance levels did better than a col-
lection of high performers, but
this random group only did mar-
ginally better than a group of rela-
tively poor performers! remark-
ably, the team of poor performers
contained a diversity of solutions
(paths in the maze) that when
combined found a better solu-
tion, even though their individual
solutions were relatively poor. In
a separate study of the same maze
problem4 with individuals using
diﬀerent heuristics, I concluded
that as long as the individuals had
some ability – they did not solve
the maze using a random walk –
the diverse collective solution out-
performed the average individual,
again agreeing with the diversity
prediction theorem.
overall, the above results for the science of CI are a
powerful statement of the collective’s ability to
amplify weak “true” signals or diverse structures of
the individuals into a robust and accurate collective
solution, even in the case when the individuals are
poor performers. unfortunately, this conclusion is
weakened by the restrictive assumptions in many of
the CI model studies above. for example, assumptions
for the minimum performance level of the individual –
such as in the Condorcet’s Jury eorem (dietrich,
2008), the ability of the individuals to accurately commu-
nicate with each other (no or minimal miscommunica-
tion), the absence of bias (a preferential inaccuracy), a
common understanding of the problem, and a common goal.
Clearly these assumptions and others like them made in
popular CI books (Surowiecki, 2004), while simplifying
the model analysis, are not often realized in real prob-
lems, particularly the hardest problems. yet, the above
studies suggest that a group of poor performers still can
express CI, so these assumptions are likely too restrictive.

In 19985, I did a study where I kept the individual
heuristics ﬁxed and then challenged the individuals and
collective with larger, more diﬃcult mazes. fIgurE 2
shows the results of the study as the diﬃculty of the
maze increased from left to right. not surprising for
the least complex maze in fIgurE 3 (#2), all the individ-
uals and the collective solve the maze optimally. As
the maze becomes more complex, the average indi-
vidual performs more poorly, as captured by the
increase in the diﬀerence between the number of

steps in the average individual solution and optimal
solution. e collective solution continues, though,
to ﬁnd the optimal solution until the most complex
maze (#6) is attempted. not shown are results for
even more complex mazes, in which the trend contin-
ues: the average individual solution gets worse, fol-
lowed by the collective solution also getting worse,
until both solutions do no better than a random walk
solution – the lowest performing heuristic.
ese results provide additional insight into the diversity
prediction theorem when problem diﬃculty increases.
Because the results in fIgurE 3 are for collectives of 500
individuals, the collective diversity is at a maximum for
all of the maze solutions. To test this, I increased the
number of individuals to 1000, but found the results in
fIgurE 3 unchanged. hence, there is a limit to the diﬃ-
culty of problem that can be solved by increasing the
number of individuals in the collective. And, the collec-
tive error remains zero or small as the diﬃculty increas-
es, even though the average individual error increases.
en, at a certain level of problem diﬃculty with ﬁxed
individual heuristics, the average individual error
exceeds the collective diversity, and then the collective
error begins to increase – this deﬁnes a collective
complexity barrier. As the maze becomes more com-
plex, the average individual error exceeds the collec-
tive diversity, the collective error is at a maximum,
and then the average individual and the collective
perform equally poorly.
e main conclusion from the above results is that
while a collective can outperform the average indi-
vidual, there is a limit to what level of diﬃculty
can be solved for a given collective method. We
can now ﬁll in the missing row in fIgurE 1, the
“hitting the complexity barrier.” If the diﬃculty
of a grand challenge is below the collective com-
plexity barrier, then we can attempt a collective
solution. But, if the complexity of the problem
is beyond the collective complexity barrier, then
we have the following options using the diver-
sity prediction eorem: 1) increase the diversi-
ty by increasing the number in the collective, 2)
increase the individual capability, or 3) develop
a collective solution method that makes better
use of diversity. Because increasing the number
in the collective is relatively easy with modern
information resources such as crowdsourcing
and because the collective diversity becomes sat-
urated for a given method, the ﬁrst option is less
interesting here. Because traditional approaches
focus on improving individual performance by
education, training, experience to get better solu-
tions, the second option is already being
addressed. erefore, the rest of this paper exam-
ines the last option of examining methods that
make better use of diversity, by extending CI meth-
ods to more extreme forms of diversity (biases, dif-
ferent goals, conﬂicts) or by enabling emergent
collective solutions.

e ﬁrst extension of CI methods does have
precedence in other areas of research and appli-
cations, reﬂecting the shortcomings of requiring
objectivity (a solution without bias) or generali-
ty in a complex world. for example, in mathe-
matics, there are two historical geometries based
on diﬀerent starting assumptions about parallel
lines: Euclidian where the parallel lines remain
parallel and non-Euclidian where parallel lines
diverge or intersect at inﬁnity. Both geometries
are useful representations of a “reality” such as
your desktop and great circles on the surface of
the earth, respectively. yet, an objective and gen-
eral geometry exists that encompasses both but is
too complex to be useful. hence, each of the
biased geometries is useful by being tailored to its
environment, yet is fundamentally incompatible
with the other. And, the objective representation is
too complex to be useful. 
now suppose that an individual uses one of the
“biased” geometries to make a conclusion about
their local reality. from an objective viewpoint, the
individual is using a biased method, yet a collective
solution can use the conclusion from the biased rea-
soning to capture a diversity of realities to obtain a
higher truth, similar to the prior examples of CI.
erefore, even though individuals use biased heuris-
tics to obtain a local truth, the collective can amplify
the local truths to obtain an objective solution. e
only requirement is that the diﬀerent biases are not cor-
related in such a way that they corrupt the collective
solution, the failure mode of herd thinking.
We can generalize the above observations, restated for the
complexity of modern world. A system of beliefs can
evolve to be functional and self-consistent, situated with-
in their complex environment, but may not be objective
because of biases. Certainly many cultures can be viewed
from this perspective as they provide consistency and
conformity (Bednar et al., 2010). furthermore, each
evolved belief system may not be compatible with other
systems of beliefs. one culture is often not compatible
with other cultures at a fundamental level. And – this is
the most insightful – in order to extract a piece of the
embedded truth, we often attempt to remove the
truth from a system of beliefs to make it objective or
unbiased, but in the process we may lose the context

and meaning of that truth within the system of beliefs.
other ﬁelds have arrived at similar conclusions. for
example, artiﬁcial intelligence in the 1980s achieved a
major breakthrough by a situated and embedded
approach to robotics, after three decades of failing to
develop a general and objective intelligence model
(pfeifer and Scheier, 1999). In this example, a robot
with relatively simple rules evolved in a complex yet
real environment outperforms a general intelligence
applied to the same environment. 
ese observations about non-objective, biased meth-
ods can be aligned with the earlier conclusions about
collectives and diversity. When a problem is suﬃ-
ciently complex, beyond the point where an expert
has utility, diverse individuals capture portions of the
truth as weak signals or structures that the collective
can amplify and bring forth as a strong truth. With-
in this perspective, we claim that diversity can
include biased representations of the problem, even
though they may be incompatible with other indi-
viduals. not surprising, this claim is in contradic-
tion to all of the assumptions of the CI model studies
cited earlier. prior CI studies, both abstracted and
applied, make the assumption that the individuals
in the collective have shared goals and compatibili-
ty of shared information. Within this restricted
viewpoint, diversity is expressed only by exploring
and solving a common problem in the absence of
bias and conﬂicts, but not including diversity as it
occurs in more complex domains, for example, by
allowing fundamental disagreement on options or
miscommunications in understanding. 
To advance this argument, an approach is needed
to manage biases and conﬂicts as they occur in
social groups. In the following, I prefer to use
social group identity instead of culture as the more
common way of capturing the
dynamics of consistency and
conformity in social groups
(Bednar et al., 2010). Social
group identity is a general con-
cept that includes culture, in
addition to the human tenden-
cy to develop social group iden-
tity from minor or random
similarities that may not easily
be described as culture (Ben-
ner et al., 2006; Akerlof and
Kranton, 2000). A working deﬁ-
nition of group identity is if
someone does something to a
person in your identity group,
you feel like it was done to you.
for example, if someone attacks
a member in your family, you
feel attacked.
groups, organizations, societies with a common
social identity have characteristics that are highly
relevant for the management of diversity in a col-
lective:
~  A common worldview, meaning they agree on
options, but can have diﬀerent individual prefer-
ences of these options. In the prior maze study, all
individuals agree on the connectivity of the maze,
but may have diﬀerent preferences at each decision
point. 
~  A common understanding and vocabulary of the
world, meaning they can communicate about the
world around them without misunderstanding or
conﬂict.
~  Uniform and tacit knowledge that is not accessible to
“others” outside of the identity group. often tacit
behaviour may be incomprehensible to others and seem
irrational. 
~  A unifying response to uncertainty or threats that occurs by
triggering the expression of social identity and causing indi-
viduals in the group to distinguish strongly between “self as
a group” and “other.” And when triggered, the identity
group will coordinate behaviour (herd thinking) and
actions, including acting irrationally (Cialdini, 2001,
Wooten and reed, 1998, Tesser, Campbell and Mickler,
1983). When triggered, the messenger is more important
than the message. 
~ Reinforcing social inﬂuence within the group and reac-
tive inﬂuence between opposing groups, particularly
when in a triggered state. for example, conﬂicted
identity groups will pick opposing actions, largely
without rational choice6.
from this list, you can see that a social identity
group largely satisﬁes the prior CI assumptions and

TABlE 1 ~ Operating guide of managing collective systems: possible levels
of diversity, bias and conﬂicts.

restrictions, particularly on compatibility of goals,
knowledge, communication, and actions. ere-
fore, we can use the concept of social identity to
guide us when collective methods are likely to work,
when and how they fail, and how to create methods
that minimize the failure modes of collective processes
in fIgurE 1.
using the concept of social identity, TABlE 1 has levels of
possible diversity, bias, and conﬂicts that can be
expressed by individuals within collectives. e qualiﬁca-
tion of “possible” is added because diﬀerent methodolo-
gies at each level can encourage or discourage the
expression of diversity, biases, or conﬂicts. e table
starts from highly aligned individuals at level 1 to indi-
viduals that are likely to have biases and conﬂicts, but
may represent the full diversity of the problem. 
e main insight from TABlE 1 is that diversity (unique
contributions of individuals in a collective) is expressed
at all levels, but is more likely to be aligned at the top
and in opposition at the bottom. likewise, biases (fea-
tures of individuals that do not represent “truths”) can
potentially occur at all levels, but are more extreme
and unchanging in the lower levels. And, the same is
true for potential conﬂicts (features of the individu-
als that can cause friction in coordination): conﬂicts
occur at all levels, but are more severe in the lower
levels. Also note that each level can express the
potential diversity, biases and conﬂicts of the levels
above it. for example, level #3 can express biases in
correlated preferences from level #1 and #2. In
general, biases and conﬂicts of lower levels are
much stronger and detrimental than in upper
levels.
At the top level of the list (#1), a social identity
group has the characteristics described earlier, so the
diversity expressed at this level is largely in diﬀerent
preferences of options, but with no disagreement
on those options. Biases and conﬂicts if they occur
at level #1 are limited to preferences. level #2
removes the restriction of a shared group identity,
and consequently there may be biases and con-
ﬂicts due to incompatibilities of communication,
language, etc. level #2 is expressed, for example,
by a smaller organization with uniform activities
and common goals, but without a company social
identity. level #3 releases the commonality of goals,
but retains the common worldview (agreement on
options at a decision point). level #3 is expressed,
for example, by a larger organization with a variety
of activities and goals, but which has agreement on
options. e last two levels capture types of diversity
where the members of the collective have biases (dis-
agreement on options), but without and with oppos-
ing social identities, respectively. for example, level
#4 describes when experts “agree to disagree”, while
level #5 describes the failure mode of group conﬂict
where experts strongly disagree, as might occur from
a history of opposition, expressing opposing social
identities in conﬂict (Ben-ner and hill, 2008). 
TABlE 1 is an operating guide for managing collec-
tive systems and solutions. e type of diversity is
largely determined by the problem and system
of interest, and thereby indicates which level is
active. once the level is determined, the bias
and conﬂict possible is then identiﬁed. 
We now consider the evidence that each level in
TABlE 1 can express CI. Most abstracted and
applied studies of CI assume explicitly or implicit-
ly the ﬁrst two levels of diversity – capturing the
requirement of a collective made up of individu-
als with common goals and some level of implicit
coherence and compatibility in their worldviews.
In the prior studies of diversity and in the con-
sideration of extensions of CI to biased systems,
there is one requirement that must guide the
following results and discussion: the random
contributions of diversity must be uncorrelated,
otherwise a correlated contribution may over-
come the weak “true” signals or structures con-
tributed by the individuals. Because bias is by
deﬁnition a correlation in the contribution of an
individual toward a certain behaviour, preference,
option, or goal, in order for any individual contri-
bution to not appear in the collective solution as
bias, the diversity in each level of TABlE 1 must be
sampled such that the contribution is uncorrelated.
is requirement cannot be over emphasized.
e ﬁrst evidence for the extension of CI methods
comes from an evaluation of the robustness of the col-
lective solution in the maze study7 where I replaced
valid preferences in the individual contribution with
random noise, thereby creating false information. for
the individual solutions, the addition of random noise
was disastrous above a 30% replacement, essentially
causing the individuals to relearn the maze. But the col-
lective solution was very robust. At 30% replacement of
valid information from the individuals, there was no
change in the collective performance, and at 75%
replacement, the collective solution recovered the opti-
mal solution, requiring only twice the number of indi-
viduals in the collective. only at a 95% replacement did
the collective solution degenerate to a random walk
solution (the worst heuristic).
ese results are a powerful indicator that the collective
solution can tolerate high levels of noise or false infor-
mation and still retain a high level of performance.
e only limitation, as noted above, is that the indi-
vidual noise must be uncorrelated, in order not to
overwhelm the collective “truth.” e source of
robustness was found to derive from a broad spec-

trum of contingency solutions that eliminate any
sensitivity to false information. As the noise study
above illustrates, these contingencies are very persis-
tent, surviving high degrees of degradation. ese
results provide encouraging evidence that the collec-
tive solutions can tolerate high degrees of biases and
conﬂicts, as more diverse systems are considered lower
in TABlE 1. 
Also in 1998, I did a study8 where 100 individuals in the
initial learning phase were divided into three groups,
each with a diﬀerent goal in the maze. en, a collective
used the aggregate information from these three groups
to solve for each of the three goals. hence, this is an
example where a collective made up of individuals with
experience of three conﬂicting goals tries to solve the
three diﬀerent problems, based on each of the goals.
one might predict that because each subgroup of indi-
viduals only make up a third of the total, their contri-
bution to the collective to ﬁnd their goal would likely
be overridden by the other individuals, so therefore the
collective should perform poorly. e results are
remarkable and contrary to this intuition. 
e average individual performance was 39.6 steps
when seeking the three diﬀerent goals as individuals,
compared to 12.8 steps when only the individuals were
trained on a single goal. e large degradation in the
individual performance is because an individual is
trying to ﬁnd the solution for two goals in which
they have no experience. remarkably, the average
collective performance for these three goals was 12,
compared to the average minimum number of
steps to the three goals of 8.3 steps. Although the
collective does not robustly ﬁnd the optimal solu-
tion, as for the case when there is only one goal, I
concluded “the experience of individuals with
diﬀerent goals still contains information useful to
the collective, even though they result from a
quite diﬀerent goal. Said another way, while the
goals for learning may diﬀer, the connectivity on
the problem domain is common”9.
is demonstration suggests that individuals
with experience from diﬀerent goals, a source
of extreme diversity, can still improve a collec-
tive solution, one that can far outperform the
average individual. is supports the hypothe-
sis that a collective of individuals having diﬀer-
ent goals still expresses CI and the diversity pre-
diction theorem remains applicable. hence, we
can add collectives with conﬂicting goals of level
#3 in TABlE 1 as a candidate for applied CI sys-
tems, greatly increasing the prior understanding
of the applicability of CI.
In order to explore the collective performance for
diversity level #4 in TABlE 1, I redid the maze simula-
tions for this article using a collective of individuals
that did not agree on options, examining the eﬀect
of strong local bias – one individual sees a corridor,
where another sees a wall. Essentially, each of the
individuals are exploring and solving diﬀerent
mazes, which have nodes in common, but have
diﬀerent options at the nodes. from a social iden-
tity viewpoint, a node could represent the act of
eating, where a type of food is an option for one
individual, but is forbidden to another. 
In the simulations of conﬂicting options, I
examined diﬀerent levels of conﬂict by ran-
domly eliminating options at decision points
for each individual. When the level of conﬂicts
in options was below 30% (3 in 10 decision
points had conﬂicts), the individual solutions
showed a minimal drop in performance of 5%,
indicating that the individuals easily accommo-
dated the changes in the maze. Similarly, the
collective solutions still found the optimal path,
and only required larger numbers of individuals
in the collective for higher levels of conﬂicting
options. Above 30%, both the individual and
collective performance dropped, primarily
because at 30% closure of options in the maze in
fIgurE 2 caused the maze to be much more diﬃ-
cult to solve, as redundant paths are removed. 
I also examined when conﬂicts in options occurred
by subgroups rather than in all individuals, by creat-
ing 10 groups of 10 individuals, each with the same set
of options, as might occur in 10 diﬀerent identity
groups. I observed that there was no diﬀerence
between the two ways of distributing the conﬂicts in
options. ese results suggest that CI in this model
problem is not highly sensitive to a poor sampling of
biases (only three in this demonstration). Based upon
these results, we can conclude that we can add diversity
level #4 in TABlE 1 as a possible candidate for applied CI
systems.
e ﬁnal level of diversity, #5, is deeply challenging as
conﬂict negotiators will share, because opposing social
identities, when triggered, will act to subvert each other
to the point of irrational, self-destructive behaviour. An
abstracted model of this level of diversity would require
the model to include behaviour, and none of the current
computational behaviour models include social identity
(Balke and gilbert, 2014). e applied example of CI in
the section after next shows how modern elicitation
methods can address the deep conﬂicts of level #5. 
one way to view the above expansion of diversity in CI
systems is to observe that each level in TABlE 1 becomes
another class of diversity that must be managed in the
CI methods. for example, within each group of indi-
viduals with a common bias or goal or social identity,
there is diversity in how these individuals solve the
problem. And, for each of these levels of diversity,

we must be inclusive of all the variations. for example,
if only individuals of one biased group are included,
then the collective solution will reﬂect that bias as a
failure mode of group thinking. Said another way, the
sampling of diversity at each level must include suﬃ-
cient variations. In CI applications, this requirement
may prove challenging, because the diﬀerent types of
variation, such as bias, may not be evident or even
knowable. 
In the prior section, we concluded that the utility of CI
depended on problem diﬃculty, the level of diversity,
level of individual ability, and the how the collective
ampliﬁes the individual’s weak signals. What we have
suggested in this section is that the previous limits on CI
are too restrictive, and CI methods can be applied to
biased and conﬂicted individuals. Because the studies of
these types of CI systems are still immature, this section
is intended to open a new area of research and applica-
tion that can signiﬁcantly extend the applicability of CI
methods to grand challenges. In the section after next, I
provide an applied example of how modern expert elic-
itation and risk technologies can address all the diversi-
ty levels in TABlE 1, primarily by elicitation methods
that do not trigger social identities and where every-
one feels they are heard and included, even if their
contributions are motivated by diﬀerent goals, highly
biased, or in conﬂict with other contributors.

unlike the last section that identiﬁes an extension
of CI by removing the assumptions and restric-
tions on prior CI applications, the extension of
CI in this section goes far beyond releasing
assumptions to opening fundamental philo-
sophical questions about CI.
e classic example of emergent problem solving
is when an ant foraging for food contributes its
local solution to a collective solution, thereby
enabling the collective of ants to robustly ﬁnd
the shortest path between the food source and
the nest. e process by which the shortest path
is discovered is not by picking the best performer
(an expert selection paradigm), but is found by
the synergy of a diversity of contributions (a CI
paradigm), similar to the collective performance
mechanism in the earlier maze studies. Because
high diversity is essential to this collective perfor-
mance (if all the ants took the same path, the col-
lective can only take the common path) and the
ant must have some level of ability to solve the local
problem, the diversity prediction theorem would
appear to be applicable. But a philosophical question
arises: how can the average individual error be posed
when the individual does not have a perception of
the global problem and therefore of its own error.
only a researcher with a global perspective can
evaluate the individual or collective error in an
emergent problem. And, there is an even deeper
quandary to the ant foraging problem: how is the
shortest path found when the ants do not have
the means or goal of ﬁnding a shorter length path
in their own solutions? 
As described earlier, the individual heuristics for
the maze problem that I studied is to eliminate
extraneous loops or dead ends, but not to ﬁnd a
shorter path. e discovery of a shortest path by
a collective that has no goal to ﬁnd a shortest
path is what I called an emergent problem deﬁn-
ition (Johnson, 1998), one step beyond an emer-
gent problem solution. In my maze studies, the
emergent problem deﬁnition and solution is a
result of the structure of the maze in combination
with the local individual heuristics (White and
harary, 2001).
Why is an emergent problem deﬁnition a philo-
sophical quandary? In all the prior models for CI
discussed, except for my maze studies, the goal of
the CI problem is stated up front (“how many beans
in the jar?” or “Who will win the Academy
Awards?”) and is understandable by the individual.
Even in the situation of recommender systems, the
concept that my purchasing history may provide good
recommendations to others is stated and a methodolo-
gy is created to achieve that goal. In an emergent prob-
lem deﬁnition, the goal is an emergent property of the
system and is not understandable or deﬁned from the
level of the individual. is lack of connection of goals
between levels could be deeply problematic. What if the
emergent problem deﬁnition is not the “right” one or
what if it doesn’t have the “right” ethics? for example,
individual ant heuristics could have generated, not a
shorter path, but a longer path, for a given environment.
A collective solution using these individuals would be dis-
astrous to the ant colony. Clearly the ants’ heuristics have
evolved to provide the best collective outcome. But, in
future emergent CI system, how do we create or direct the
emergent problem deﬁnition or its emergent ethics?
Many researchers and practitioners of CI use collective
wisdom in the place of CI, almost interchangeably (hong
and page, 2011). Many of the aspects that researchers or
practitioners attribute to a wise crowd arguably are also
associated with an intelligent crowd. By introducing
the concepts of emergent problem deﬁnition and
problem solving to the CI discussion and resources, the
possibility arises that collective intelligence and wis-
dom could provide both solutions and goals that are
not expressed or expressible by the individuals in the
crowd. is opens CI methods to unimaginable

opportunities. for a full discussion of the issues and
opportunities that arise within the context of leader-
ship, see the paper by Jennifer Watkins and myself
(Johnson and Watkins, 2009). ere are social expres-
sions of emergent problem solving in human history,
for instance, the fall of the Berlin wall caught the
world and the intelligence community by surprise,
mainly because it arose outside the normal power
structures (lohmann, 1994). Another example is the
distribution of water in ancient Bali (lansing, 2006).
unlike the extension of CI proposed in the last section,
the inclusion of emergent problem deﬁnition and solu-
tion as a resource for CI is barely appreciated, let alone
understood or studied. e opportunity is similar to
that of developing emergent or generative models that
can express features or capabilities that go beyond the
model itself, a common area of study in complex adap-
tive systems (Miller and page, 2007). until progress is
made in understanding emergent systems, there are no
recipes for what environments and local heuristics cre-
ate the desired emergent functionality. What can be
stated is that in the same way that the individual abili-
ty is ampliﬁed by the collective in traditional CI, likely
the same is true for emergent collective problem deﬁ-
nition and solution: the ethics and abilities of the
individual will determine the emergent collective
ethics and abilities. And, based on the discussion in
the prior section, there is hope that even with bias
and conﬂicts among the individuals, the emergent
collective solution may represent the “best” of the
individuals and not their “worst” attributes.

e following is an example of the CI extensions
discussed above, demonstrating that they can be
used to solve a grand challenge. In 2004, presi-
dent Bush released an Executive order, Biode-
fense homeland Security presidential directive
(hSpd-10), calling for a comprehensive, defensi-
ble, and transparent risk assessment to guide
biodefense investments across research, develop-
ment, planning and preparedness, impacting
100s of billions of dollars of uS federal funding.
While the goal was of national importance, noth-
ing like this had ever been attempted before,
largely because it was considered too diﬃcult,
partially because of the complexity and scope of
the problem, but also because of the special inter-
ests of the political and scientiﬁc groups in main-
taining the status quo. Said another way, while
everyone agreed this was a grand challenge worth
solving, the scientiﬁc and political experts disagreed
on all aspects of the problem. In fulﬁlment of the
order, I led one of three national eﬀorts: the high-
cost, high-risk, high-payoﬀ option. e following is
my account of the lessons learned. is is the ﬁrst
time I’ve used this as an example of advanced
methods of CI.
By the end of the project, the eﬀort required over
40,000 expert elicitations from more than 60 sub-
ject matter experts, across all technical and opera-
tional domains. And many of these “experts”
were in deep disagreement on fundamentals,
such as the range of parameters in infectious
models, the proper treatment of speciﬁc illnesses
like Ebola, or proper public intervention strate-
gies during an epidemic. 
e technical and operational approach evolved
over a four-month period, until the following
guidelines were used in the ﬁnal project during
the next 9 months. Interestingly, we were driven
by the need to solve the grand challenge, which
in turn created the use of CI extensions above,
rather than any awareness that the CI extensions
were needed to solve the problem. Although no
published documentation of the project exists,
other researchers have arrived at similar conclu-
sions (hallin et al., 2013).
1) Use a methodology that captures the full expression
of the problem domain, including possible biases and
uncertainties. e technical approach was a fuzzy-set
data capture on a logic or inference tree. An infer-
ence tree, similar to the maze model described earli-
er, captured decision points that are connected logi-
cally from beginning to end, creating sequences of
actions and decisions, including multiple paths. e
fuzzy-set elicitation at the decision nodes allowed for
multiple responses, enabling an individual to express
uncertainty. en the fuzzy logic provided risks (proba-
bility of a loss) for each decision path (a scenario). 
2) Use a methodology and elicitation that reduced or elim-
inated conﬂict between experts. Because of the fuzzy-set
elicitation and the comprehensiveness of the inference
tree, each expert could contribute her elicitation inde-
pendently from other experts. 
3) Use small group elicitation. By using small group elicita-
tion, conﬂicts that arise in large groups where individuals
feel the need to defend their speciﬁc social or expert identi-
ties were avoided. Studies show that competition can lead
to loss of cooperation even within small group (Barker, et.
al., 2012).  But, because each expert could express and see
their contribution is included, competition generally was
eliminated and conﬂicts were minimized. no attempt
was made to ﬁlter biases or apparent inaccuracies.
4) Engage as many stakeholders as possible. e com-
plexity of the problem required that all stakeholders
were included. But a diversity of stakeholders of one
expertise was also required in order to overcome
technical biases and conﬂicts. e diversity of input

enabled uncorrelated biases to cancel, so that the
“truth” from the biased diversity would arise in the
collective aggregation. 
5) Use a methodology that didn’t force a solution, but
enabled surprise and innovation. Because the methodol-
ogy was process and outcome neutral, global solutions
could arise, essentially connecting parts of the problem
that weren’t previously identiﬁed, providing solutions
that were innovative and often unexpected. ese sur-
prises could be considered emergent solutions, although
once identiﬁed, they were understandable due to the
transparency of the method. An example of a surprise
outcome was that for a broad class of respiratory infec-
tions that require ventilators in treatment, the shortage of
ventilators in local health facilities created a major inabili-
ty to respond to even a minor epidemic.
At the time we did not identify or appreciate how the
above approach was an example of CI, and I only recent-
ly appreciated that the methodology also enabled biased
and conﬂicted experts to contribute to a collective truth.
is is an excellent example of how expediency drives
innovation, which is only later appreciated.
We learned the following major lessons. e quality of
the outcome was directly a result of the diverse and com-
prehensive contributions, without selection or elimina-
tion of biases. We learned that a process, which includ-
ed all of stakeholder diversity, led to better solutions
(higher performance) and were more robust and
resilient (performed well with changes). had we start-
ed by choosing the “best” experts to contribute, we
would have replicated our biases, and the results
would have suﬀered, or even been unusable. Also, by
using a process where all stakeholders participated
from the beginning, the involvement in the process
and acceptance of the ﬁnal outcome was high. e
full involvement of stakeholders also had the addi-
tional advantage that the deployment beneﬁted
from broad support. is is a major lesson in solv-
ing grand challenges: a good idea or program can
fail by not engaging the diverse stakeholders from
the beginning. We found that even if stakeholders
didn’t agree with the conclusions of the project,
they could see how the results were obtained from
a transparent process and could identify how their
contributions were included. is increased
acceptance of the outcome and reduced conﬂicts,
even when the results were contrary to a special
interest or a paradigm.

We began this exploration with reﬂections on how
program managers of a multi-billion dollar federal
agency choose not to solve grand challenges, because it
apparently perceived that within an expert paradigm,
collective expert methods are deeply challenged.
hence, it solves problems that they think they can
solve, rather than ones they want to solve. While this
generalization is probably unfair for a complex orga-
nization that undeniably is serving the public inter-
est, these perceptions of the failure of expert collec-
tive systems and of the reluctance of organizations
to address grand challenges are our common experi-
ence. Juxtaposed with these perceived limitations,
the mainstream science of CI, of which I was an
integral player, oﬀers attractive alternatives of
diverse collectives outperforming experts and col-
lectives of experts, but where the requirements of
the abstracted studies and popular CI champions
are unlikely to be met in real world grand chal-
lenges. Most pointedly, CI methods are not expect-
ed to be applicable when the problem domain
contains conﬂicting goals, biases, or conﬂicts
between opposing groups. 
We saw that this dismal observation on the state
of CI applicability is likely to be inaccurate, after
a review of the remarkable fringe CI research on
how groups of low performers, noisy individuals,
conﬂicted individuals, and biased individuals can
express robust CI. A radical perspective then arises
on how collectives of biased and conﬂicted indi-
viduals embedded in their situated environments
can be resources for CI, without ﬁrst extracting their
objective or unbiased contributions. furthermore,
in the most diﬃcult grand challenges that are poorly
deﬁned in understanding and goals, CI methods that
employ emergent problem deﬁnition and solution
can provide resources that truly solve the most chal-
lenging problems facing humanity. Indeed, this emer-
gent resource may be the wizard behind the curtain
that has repeatedly saved humanity at many ancient
and historical transitions.
In order to better manage this new inclusion of diversity
in grand challenges applications, the concept of social
identity groups is introduced, both putting into context
the mainstream CI research and well as the CI extensions
needed to solve grand challenges. In order to show that
the ideas presented are achievable with current method-
ologies, an example is given of a grand challenge project
that successfully addressed a national problem where
experts deeply disagreed and were often in conﬂict. All
together, the concepts presented and discussed provide
reasons to be optimistic that humanity can address our
grand challenges, not by relying on our experts, but by
fully embracing humanity’s full diversity. e more
complex problems of our modern times will require
new resources that are collectively enhanced, capturing
our greater understanding of applied methods of CI in
the presence of biases and conﬂicts.

NCE UPON A TIME… A CONTINENT OF PEOPLE
came together as “We the People” to con-
sciously structure a new system of gover-
nance. e new structure focused on making
individual lives better, but the process of
creating it was an exciting example of collective
intelligence. We the People were thoughtful togeth-
er, determining a structure that was best for all.
en, for two hundred plus years, subsequent gen-
erations lived by that structure. And, even though
the system was oriented to promote individual
happiness, collective intelligence improved as well.
Eventually however, as people became more inter-
dependent, the system began breaking down. It was
based on competition, the pursuit of self-interest at
the expense of others, and adding up individual
judgments for voting. Conversation was not its
strong suit. e system was left in charge of itself,
directing the energies of people toward mindless eco-
nomic growth and consumption at the expense of the
planet, human health, and community values. 
What was needed in that dire situation is obvious
now. e people needed to talk together. ey needed
to come together in respect and make intelligent
choices, just as their Founders had done. But this
seemed impossible to them. e Founders seemed
like special people living in a special moment.
e people didn’t recognize their collective potential,
their capabilities as “We the People.” Many acted in
service of the whole by ﬁghting to inﬂuence legislation
or compassionately helping others. But the real need
was for all to take “time out,” talk, and act togeth-
er. Social innovations were available to do this. 
Generally they did not question the system of which
they were a part. Instead they tended to deny the
existence of collective problems, or relied on elected
oﬃcials, the marketplace, experts, or the Founders
themselves to address them. Most people thought
that the problems arose because society had departed
from the original vision of the Founders. But this
was wrong. e time of the original Founders had
come and gone. ese problems required that all
become involved, that all work together on a regular
basis. is simple step would mean a new system of
economics and politics, a new set of Founders and a
new “We the People.” To shift from collective stupidity
to collective intelligence, turning back the clock was not
an option. Instead, it was up to a few people to under-
stand how this change could be facilitated, to convene the
conversation, and to invite all the people to participate.
is story is more accurate than most people might
think. e main inaccuracy with it is that the ﬁrst ver-
sion of “We the people,” words that began the uS Con-
stitution, wasn’t a real “We the people.” It didn’t
include slaves, women, native Americans and non-prop-
erty holders. But the rest of the story is pretty accurate.
We really do live in a system that is in decline, taking
us where no one wants to go. ere really is a set of
practical social innovations by which the people can be
facilitated to come together as “We the people.” Just a
few people, plus ﬁnancial resources, can use those
social innovations to set the process in motion. And
just the addition of this new “We the people” conver-
sation would shift to a new level of collective intelli-
gence, a new system of democracy.

groups helping others address impossible-seeming
problems, often issues from society like war, health
care, or money-in-politics. In these conversations peo-
ple often experience breakthroughs in understanding.
A frequent breakthrough occurs, no matter what issue
people address… is problem is caused by our system. To
address it, we need to change our system.
ere are three fundamental systems of organization
whether in a school, corporation, hospital, government
agency, or society. e three systems are: 1) Triangle,
based on hierarchy, where one leader is ultimately in
charge; 2) Box, where a prescribed set of agreements like a
constitution is ultimately in
charge; and 3) Circle, where
the ultimate authority is a
creative conversation of
everyone seeking what’s best
for all. Today many people
desire the Circle System,
where employees, citizens,
or organizational members
evolve common under-
standings and shared vision,
and where the best talents
and skills of everyone are
evoked. But the Circle is
diﬃcult to achieve.
Each of the three Systems is best in a diﬀerent set-
ting, has a diﬀerent structure, promotes a diﬀerent
attitude in people, requires diﬀerent leadership
competencies, generates diﬀerent results and
evokes a diﬀerent kind of conversation.
e Triangle, with a charismatic leader and a
hierarchical structure, works well for organiza-
tions in crisis, like in a war or a catastrophe. e
collective intelligence of the organization is lim-
ited by the capabilities of the leader. people in
the organization contribute to the shared eﬀort,
but limit their contributions by never question-
ing the leader or anyone of higher status. 
e Box System works well when people are
independent and there are plenty of common
resources available, like farmers and ﬁshers in
north America in the 18th century. en there
can be a clear set of rules that are fairly enforced.
people can just go into the world and make their
fortune independently. is system encourages
innovation through competition rather than
cooperative eﬀorts toward what’s best for all.
When people are equal and inter-dependent and
the issues are complex, the Circle is best. Seem-
ingly this applies to unions, cooperatives, mem-
bership organizations, and societies where democ-
racy is the aim. But in practice, these organizations
are often rigid Boxes or even Triangles because the
Circle has proven so diﬃcult to achieve. Small orga-
nizations are most capable of achieving a Circle
because everyone can gather and know one anoth-
er. But as corporations grow to become publicly
traded, for example, the organization often reverts
to the Box or Triangle. 
Western democracies are currently structured as
Boxes, where we assume everyone is to operate as a
free individual within the law. Voting and the
marketplace are structured in place for collective
decisions, so there is little need for conversations
about the well being of the whole. But as inter-
dependence grows we
need all the people to
engage in this conversa-
tion and to become part
of the answer. A major-
ity vote is not enough.
And it is no longer
acceptable for corpora-
tions to maximize prof-
its at the expense of the
commons.
So naturally today,
given that we are
embedded in the Box
system, we face a
growing number of
collective problems like an environmental crisis, an
l-curve distribution of wealth, rapid depletion of
natural resources, mindless consumption, periodic
banking crises and wars, etc. from within the Box
system these problems all seem impossible to solve.
We look to solution strategies like making people
aware of the problems, educating them, pressing for
legislation, or raising individual consciousness. But
these within-system strategies won’t make the needed
diﬀerence. however, if we could facilitate a Circle sys-
tem into place then we’d all be caring about one anoth-
er and working together to address these problems.
en many impossible-seeming problems – like racism,
partisan gridlock, bullying, and lack of shared purpose –
would start going away. And ﬁnally we could begin
restructuring our institutions to address issues like cli-
mate change, the mal-distribution of wealth, and deple-
tion of vital natural resources. Key to achieving a Circle
system is to recognize the special kind of conversation
that’s needed.

Each of the three systems generates a diﬀerent kind
of conversation. In the Triangle people learn to sup-

what the leader thinks and feels. e conversation

revolves around who is speaking and their status
rather than the merit of ideas. To make a diﬀerence
in the organization people look to someone in a
position of authority, or to gain authority.
e Box limits our thinking as well. In it people veil
their attention to focus on extrinsic goals, rules, and the
game-like ﬁeld of play. eir thinking is directed to their
own lives and strategies for getting ahead rather than
what they really want, or what the society needs.
In the Box we are directed to use our judging minds
more than our creative minds. We call it “decision-
making.” Voting is the ultimate expression of decision-
making and of what we call “democracy,” yet we see
that the results of elections and our collective decisions
can’t make that much diﬀerence. If any conversation
exists in the Box it is likely to be an argument over sim-
plistic strategies that beneﬁt special interests, rather
than respectful attempts to determine and implement
solutions in the public interest. 
Shifting to the Circle system requires a type of conversa-
tion that is diﬀerent than the kinds of conversation used
in “decision-making,” like debate, agree/disagree discus-
sions, arguing, or power struggle, where one option
wins. Even with “deliberation,” people thoughtfully
weigh diﬀerent options before choosing one. 
ere is another kind of conversation needed. It is like
what happens sometimes in a crisis, or a “time out.”
people drop their roles and their blind adherence to
rules and norms. ey become authentic with one
another and face the important issues sharing their
feelings. ey work collaboratively and creatively
together and reach shared perspectives. unlike col-
lective decision-making, everyone needs to be
included in the process and unity is the only possi-
ble result. We call this form of conversation
“choice-creating.”
With choice-creating groups often overcome
challenges that seemed impossible beforehand…
by redeﬁning the problem, transforming them-
selves, gaining clarity about what needs to hap-
pen, or by inventing new and better solutions
that all support. Although people often confuse
“decision-making” and “choice-creating,” the
two are almost opposites because judgment and
creativity cannot co-exist. In decision-making
judgment is used while in choice-creating people
engage one another with heartfelt creativity until
the choice comes into view. 
e ultimate answer is to convene a new system-
wide conversation in the spirit of choice-creat-
ing. And if we make this to be ongoing, we
restructure our system of thinking so that it’s nor-
mal to face the collective problems and become
empowered as “We the people.”

dynamic facilitation (df) is a way to facilitate peo-
ple to address issues in the spirit of choice-creating.
It is guided by the energy of how much they care
about the issue, their fears, or the passion of their
advocacy, more than by extrinsic factors like
guidelines, roles or an agenda. It provides a way
people can release their creativity, face impossi-
ble-seeming issues, and achieve breakthrough
progress and group unity. is natural unity
only seems unnatural and diﬃcult to achieve
because we live in a decision-making context.
e df’er invites each person to speak naturally
yet holds the space in such a way that they talk
and think in the spirit of choice-creating. e
df’er might set up the room with a half-circle of
chairs facing four charts – Solutions, data, Con-
cerns, and problem-Statements. ese charts are
used to protect people from judgment and to
build a story of group progress from all com-
ments. for example, if one person is describing
an idea, the df’er will be writing that down on
the chart of Solutions. en if someone else starts
to disagree, the df’er might ask the person who is
interrupting to direct his comment to her, rather
than to the person with whom he is disagreeing.
She will then record the comment as a Concern,
not as a disagreement, and invite him to oﬀer his
Solution as well, “So what might be an even better
answer?” is comment is added to the list of Solu-
tions. en the df’er can go back to the ﬁrst person
and help him ﬁnish articulating his solution.
using this approach, no one is judged. ere is no
agreeing or disagreeing. Each comment is valued and
added to the charts as an interesting piece of the puzzle.
people grow in curiosity and creativity seeking to solve
the puzzle. Shifts and breakthroughs naturally result
and all come to embrace the ﬁnal result.
I once had the opportunity to df a weekly meeting
among angry and frustrated employees in a sawmill.
over the course of many meetings they began to work
in the spirit of choice-creating. productivity and quality
took oﬀ! e energy of frustration became the energy
of community. ey became more cooperative, curi-
ous, informed, and observant. ey understood more,
trusted more, risked more, and achieved more. Work-
ing together in this way these low level employees
transformed the management system, culture and per-
formance of the mill.

wrote Society’s Breakthrough! Releasing Essential Wis-
dom and Virtue in All the People* about it, describing
how a seemingly innocuous uS Constitutional
Amendment could spark a national and global com-
ing together of “We the people.” I called the process
within the Amendment the “Wisdom Council.” now,
years later there have been many experiments with the
Wisdom Council in organizations, communities, cities,
conferences and even states. We know that this process
can work. It can spark the necessary whole-system
choice-creating conversation. And we know it’s some-
thing a few of us can set in motion at a national and
global scale without needing an Amendment. 
In the Wisdom Council, every four months or so, twelve
people are randomly selected and gathered as a micro-
cosm of all. Each Wisdom Council meets for a couple of
days with a dynamic facilitator. ey choose an impor-
tant issue or are given an issue and reach shared conclu-
sions through shifts and breakthroughs. e Wisdom
Council then presents this unity and the story of how it
was developed back to everyone. en all the people are
invited talk in small groups, face to face, over the tele-
phone, or via the Internet about what they have heard
and what they think. resonance builds. ose who
hear directly tend to say, “yes, I think so too!” ... and
they help continue the conversation, taking up where
the Wisdom Council left oﬀ.
e Wisdom Council process achieves this magic,
where large groups create the choice together,
because choice-creating is the form of thinking it
emphasizes, even among those in the larger audi-
ence who were not dynamically facilitated. people
in the larger system tend to build on what is hap-
pening more than they judge it. for instance, if
someone in the audience diﬀers with the Wis-
dom Council conclusions, they have an unusual
perspective. others are interested to know more
about that perspective. ey listen and seek ways
to incorporate it. is is not how a normal polit-
ical conversation works, where you go back and
forth agreeing and disagreeing and where those
with minority views become excluded. In a Cir-
cle system, diﬀerent perspectives are valued.
is level of change might seem unrealistic or
scary. But it works and it’s safe. one way of
looking at it is… we just randomly select a
small group of people every few months, who
are dynamically facilitated, who give a talk and
go away. Another way is to realize that adding
the Wisdom Council process to national society
or to global society doesn’t directly change any-
thing. It just adds a new conversation to what
already exists. But in this conversation we ﬁnally
start talking about the big issues we face, that we
have largely been ignoring. And we talk in a way
that we can be ourselves, and be heard and respect-
ed, and where we start making real headway. 
for example, in the heart of Bregenz, a city on
lake Constance at the westernmost edge of Aus-
tria, is a parking lot. over the years it’s been dif-
ﬁcult to develop any key parcel of land like this
because each development proposal generates a
political battle. To move the project ahead
without the usual battle the mayor convened a
“Wisdom Council.” e twelve random citi-
zens met brieﬂy to listen to the latest project
proposal. en the door was closed and they
were dynamically facilitated. At the end the
Wisdom Council expressed their unity, which
was powerfully resonant in the community.
ey said … People want to be more closely
linked to the lake and this project oﬀers a once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity to do this. We could take
advantage of this opportunity if the centre of grav-
ity for the project were moved to the second ﬂoor
and there was a wide bridge over the highway and
railroad, with a sweeping set of steps to the lake.
e Wisdom Council presented this perspective
to investors, architects, city planners, activists, and
citizens. en each Wisdom Council member
spoke how enjoyable and rewarding it was to be on
the Council. e audience turned their chairs and
met in small groups to consider this perspective. e
evening presentation was more like a celebration
because everyone was on board, including the devel-
opers who proceeded to modify the project plans.
In Ashland, oregon three citizens organized a Wisdom
Council in their county. ey arranged for a randomly
selected group of registered voters to come together for a
day and a half and be dynamically facilitated. e Wis-
dom Council presented some simple points to the com-
munity that resonated widely… “We need to wake up,
recognize that our society isn’t working, take charge, make
politicians more accountable, and we need to start imple-
menting common-sense actions, like adequately funding
education.” is was just a one-time experiment but it gen-
erated a new momentum in the community with many
important developments. A number of citizens said the
experience was life changing for them. ey began a citi-
zens’ movement that reshaped the town charter.
In another example, one division of the department of
Agriculture of Washington State initiated a Wisdom
Council, which lamented how the department no
longer had the spirit of community it once had. With
the Internet and emails people were working more in
silos. from that one experience the people of the divi-
sion found themselves reconnecting with one another
in new ways. later Wisdom Councils were expanded
to include the whole department, state-wide, where
employees exclaimed they had ﬁnally “bridged the

Cascade Mountain Barrier,” which had always kept
the department in two separate cultures.
So, more and more we are inter-dependent with oth-
ers. yet we are structured as though we are indepen-
dent. is means we ignore how life really works and
assume, for instance, that we can increase our collective
intelligence by increasing the individual intelligence of
people. no. not necessarily. And it assumes we can
vote on the best decision and ignore the minority, when
really we need to create the choice together. e longer
we ignore the new reality the more dangerous and stu-
pid our collective actions become, like to threaten the
well being of our children with climate change, species
extinction, resource depletion, poisons in our diet, etc. 
is article presents a safe, practical way to keep our cur-
rent systems in place but to facilitate the needed shift in
collective intelligence so we can deal adequately with our
problems. But the ideas expressed here are new, not part
of the Box paradigm around which we have structured
our identities. So even though this approach proposes a
practical safe strategy for change at the collective level, it
tends to fade quickly from memory without reinforce-
ment. We hope the reader will continue to develop an
understanding of this approach after reading this article
and will suggest some possible actions going forward:
1) notice how the game-like structure of our system
undermines collective intelligence; 2) notice that the
distinction between decision-making and choice-cre-
ating is valid and that making it opens doors of pos-
sibility for individual and collective intelligence; 3)
explore how dynamic facilitation can reliably
evoke choice-creating in small groups; 4) remember
the Wisdom Council process, this out-of-the-box
solution strategy, when talking with others about
societal problems; 5) look for opportunities to sup-
port or get involved with convening a Wisdom
Council process. 
oh, and one thing more… the Wisdom Council
process is proving to be fun. for people randomly
selected to be on Wisdom Councils, many have
said, “is the best political conversation I’ve
ever been in.” or, “If you get randomly selected,
do it!” It’s also fun for the conveners.

CCordIng To MAny IndIgEnouS pEoplE Around ThE
world, the cosmos is anything but a dead, mute
and silent place. Everything is alive: stones,
mountains, the nightly tunes of a croaking
army of frogs, the dancing fog that blinds and
confuses, the clouds that weep the purging rain.
Everything sings, swirling in and out of reckoning
and usefulness, having seasons of wakefulness and
dormancy, but possessing an irrefutable vitality,
potency and agency that is not metaphorical or
derived from human activity. 
e world did not explode in a fury, only to con-
dense into lifeless lumps of matter – awaiting the
redemptive arrival of human sentience – as is the
generic plot of scientism. Instead, from the Ainu
people of Japan, distributed in the Sakhalin
Island in the north to the Kuril Islands and the
island of hokkaido and northern honshū, to
the Eﬁk people of South-eastern nigeria, wher-
ever ancient ways of knowing have been preserved,
there is an intimate reckoning with the won-
drous vibrancy of all things. Whether it be with
giant trouts, people made from corn, golden
ropes hanging from a corner of the sky, primal
tarantulas, or mountains leaning into a human
conversation that interests them, indigenous sto-
ries and traditions orient listeners and practition-
ers towards a cosmos that befuddles, surprises,
and invites one to probe deeper. A world that is
never the same the second time you look. A world
that returns your curious gaze. 
As an ethno-psychotherapeutic researcher, I embarked
on a quest to investigate the shamanic practices and
wisdoms of yoruba traditional healers in two local
governments in southwester nigeria. My con-
cern was to make more explicit their narratives
about their interactions with subtle realms and
otherworldly beings, and how their engage-
ments with these realms provided real alterna-
tives to the orthodoxies of Western-styled psy-
chotherapy1. My journey took me through
unbeaten paths, through remote villages hidden
from the asphalted conversations of moderniza-
tion, and through an inner coming-of-age ritual
– one that slowly converted me from my previ-
ous loyalty to a static world of a single overriding
truth to a world that spilled into many other
worlds. I met and interviewed six experienced
healers who employed divinistic means to under-
stand and oﬀer help to clients that presented a
wide range of problems and life challenges to
them. Sometimes, while waiting to be granted
access to the healer, I would eagerly watch throngs
of seekers, their petitions gorily embodied in head-
less carcasses of bloodied chickens squeezed into
earthen calabashes, their steps and rituals gently
directed by nodding sub-priests, their tongues
unceasingly and prayerfully provoking the gods and
clouds and ancestors. having being raised a Christian
of the evangelical stripe, something within found the
proceedings ﬁercely disturbing – and yet, fascinating.
ere was a feral openness and refreshing intimacy
about the way their unshod feet implored the sepia
ground beneath, brushing away ashes that had spewed
from the hollows of a decorated tree stump nearby.
When I did get the chance to interview the healers, I was
transported into restless realms that further dislodged my
quaint notions about the self-evident separation of things.
e journey was turbulent. eir expositions opened up a
world in which everything was connected with everything
else. nothing was trivial, trite or tepid. Every object, in
the worldview of these men, seemed to have its place, its
agreement with an intricate web of things. Items we
would normally lose sight of in the modern world, which
are largely inconsequential to us – an orphaned eyelash
on the ﬂoor, a doodle marking out spilled water on
parched earth, a drunken bug clawing up the edges of a
hot plate of ofada rice – were charged with meaning,
and spoke in cryptic languages the healers strained to
master. Even the wind brought madness. one healer
told me: “ere’s the ‘madness of the wind’. ere is
the one who goes out and gets blown upon by the
wind (atégun). e wind touches him; he begins to

[behave in a particular way]. he is incoherent in his
speech, and speaks to no one in particular. at’s the
one of the wind (wèrè atégùn).”
Another healer addressed the ‘white man’s’ oblivious-
ness to the vibrancy of the material world around us –
hinting that people suﬀered greatly when they did not
see the signs around them, or acknowledge their inter-
dependence with nonhuman forces: “e ‘white man’
cannot believe it – because over there they do not see
that there are hidden forces (ayé) that people exploit to
disturb others. But now things are changing – people are
getting it… now things are changing. is story of the
doctor I told you… if I ran into someone and told them
the tale they’d ﬁnd it hard to believe. But now, on televi-
sion, these mysteries are becoming very popular. e
‘white man’ will not see the way we see, because they do
not believe people do things to other people. But here,
we know that these forces are here – because we have
terrible things in our hands. ere are some things, for
instance, that should not touch you. If I were to put
this thing here on your body, you won’t even give it
any thought. you’d say: “Is this not alligator pepper?”
Whereas here, this has powers and we have seen it.
at’s why we believe in the ways we do.”
Making sense of the heaps of interview data slowly
freed up hermeneutic plot lines that impelled themes
of exclusion, a systematic erosion of cultural identity,
and the silencing of the nonhuman world – thanks
to the din of modernity. one healer spoke of how
the progress of modernization had forced the spir-
its away from their homes, driving them to the
fringes of things. he also said that these homeless,
angered spirits sought closure and often pounced
on people in order to exact revenge. I asked him
what he thought we could do to live well, to
thrive as a people, to enjoy the blessings of the
world. his response was an invitation to ‘get
lost’, to reanimate our alliances with nonhuman
and agentic worlds, to learn to listen to plants
and hear the secrets of ﬁelds – a hard won
access to a poly-vocal cosmos that is ﬂuent in
many languages. 
In a sense, the healer was beckoning on those
willing to hear him to recognize the futility
underlying the premise of human sentience as
alienated and anomalous. for him, and for an
increasing number of teachers, scientists, mystics,
and communities around the globe, we inhabit a
living universe – frothing with playful forms of
consciousness – and we imperil ourselves when
we do not take this into account. Man is not the
sole holder of intelligence, and because we have
imagined that he is alone with the burden of aware-
ness, staring out into the blackest night, separate
from ‘nature’ instead of asymptomatic of ‘it’, lord
over the elements, we have summoned a cultural
abstraction that is leading to the demise of our
species, other species, and the planet.

nothing feeds our modern superciliousness and
civilizational pathology like the myth that the
nonhuman world is bereft of agency, of vitality,
of story; that we are magisterial anomalies inter-
rupting a dead swirling heap of mute, passive
things; and, that at best, the grace of human
sentience animates ‘objects’ with nothing more
than a metaphorical vitality they otherwise lack.
But this binary view, which divides the world
into man and his playthings, has helped cat-
alyze a politics of indiﬀerence, an ecosystem of
abuse, and a generic culture wherein an eco-
nomic metric standard – a single notion – is
oﬀered as the measure of all value. 
In place of a shamanic eﬀulgence, an enrapturing
vision of our interdependence with all things and
the über-ubiquity of intelligence, agency and vibran-
cy, we have eﬀectively built a passive monolith to
concretize our separation from the world around
us. We live in quarantine. In order to correct
‘nature’, we have reiﬁed ways of knowing that side-
step the intelligence of rivers, sand and dew, and we
are fostering a linearity of thought that is predicated
on a static universe, a passive universe open and curi-
ously submissive only to the scrutiny of human ratio-
cination. Whereas, indigenous cultures usually accom-
modated practices and rituals that nurtured kinship
with other species – and this, because there was a
recognition of nonhuman powers – ‘Western’ or glob-
alizing industrial culture produces a discourse of evasion
and exploitation, which motivates its citizenry to treat
nature as a threat to ﬂee from or as a ﬁeld of resources
that are at best instrumental to our ends. 
And this discourse is spreading. 
Indigenous wisdoms are succumbing to the sterilizing
inﬂuences of industrialization – thus creating an episte-
mological hegemony in which one logic of knowing is
treated as exclusively valuable. Children are sent to be
students in a school system that is premised on the a pri-
ori demarcation of living and learning. While in school,
they will be educated out of their cultural ties and lin-
guistic richness – an oﬃcial language impressed upon
them. ose that ‘succeed’ will be granted certiﬁcates
that oﬀer them access to further discipline by an
anonymous, generic sorting mechanism called the job
market. eir lands will be transformed, roads built,
highways constructed, and houses allocated in urban
settlements. ey will learn to see the decimation of

trees and the extractive activities of giant corpora-
tions as normal, and even necessary for the continued
survival of the human race. ey might even learn to
advocate for deregulated trade policies allowing the
free movement of corporations across boundaries.
Growth is necessary, they will insist. 
however, what this cultural ﬁxation with growth and
progress tries to repress is the devastation it has wrought
on people, on languages, on culture, on planet earth, on
imagination. Scientists, alarmed by the level of damage
to the earth brought about by human activity, coined the
term, ‘Anthropocene’, to describe a geological timeframe
characterized by the violent disruption of the planet’s eco-
logical spaces, atmospheric conditions and life systems.
What this means is that we “[…] have collectively entered
a period marked by increased industrialization – the dis-
tressingly potent consequences of which have led to the
loss of biodiversity, an increase in carbon dioxide emis-
sions, the loss of critical ecosystems and the concomitant
extinction of many species, ocean acidiﬁcation, air and
water pollution, the destruction of coastal areas, ozone
depletion, and the sporadic emergence of ‘new’ patho-
genic conditions and crippling ailments. e combined
eﬀects of the presence of humans on earth now
arguably rivals that of ‘nature’ itself – so that it is now
believed we no longer abide on the same planet that
supported life a mere thousand years ago.”
Consequently it is now almost taken for granted
that we live in a crisis-ridden age. What is probably
not as popular is the consideration that our impass-
es are borne out of the exclusionary dynamics of
modern culture, by which I mean the tendency to
devalue alternative visions of aliveness, knowing,
and reality. Jane Bennett, in her book, Vibrant
Matter*, connects today’s crises of ecological dev-
astation, cultural genocide, climate change, and
an unparalleled upswing in the number of men-
tal health issues reported, with the failure to see
or notice other worlds of being: “Why advocate
the vitality of matter? Because my hunch is that
the image of dead or thoroughly instrumental-
ized matter feeds human hubris and our earth-
destroying fantasies of conquest and consump-
tion. It does so by preventing us from detecting
(seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling) a
fuller range of the nonhuman powers circulating
around and within human bodies. ese materi-
al powers, which can aid or destroy, enrich or
disable, ennoble or degrade us, in any case call
for our attentiveness, or even ‘respect’[…].”
In this sense, we are a poor species today, not
because we are not ‘growing’ fast enough (as the
myth of growth would have us believe), but because
we have shut away the unthought – the wilds: we
have traded our multidimensionality, our ancient
trysts with the elements, the wisdom of ossiﬁed
allies, for a morsel of a curious abstraction: moderni-
ty. What would become of politics and economics
today if trees, rocks and river were consulted? What
would become of consumerism - our use and
dump rituals – if we realized that there is no such
thing as ‘waste’, or even ‘use’ (the former repre-
senting a cultural inadequacy to notice the con-
tinued vitality of the world around us – even
when not ﬁt for our agendas; the latter holding
an intrinsic presupposition of human centrality
in the otherwise two-way dynamics of utility)?

e Cartesian paradigm fostered a vision of the
whole that can be completely understood from
its parts, a view of human rationality as an infal-
lible guide to truth and certainty, and – more
impliedly – the centrality of human be-ing to
experience. Intelligence, in this conception, is
exclusively a human attribute – a tool that we
must employ to navigate an unspeaking world. It
is not an attribute of stones, caves or spirits. Con-
sequently, we have ‘otherized’ the world around
us, and treated ‘it’ in a way that does not evince
‘respect’ or mutuality – and we are worse oﬀ for it. 
Today, however, we are witnessing the uncoupling
and dismantling of this metanarrative of human
supremacy. A number of factors is emphasizing the
untenability of this vision of the world, and stressing
the need to adopt a broader, more ravishing vision of
what it means to be a citizen of reality. one of such fac-
tors is the anomalies in the ‘hard’ sciences – reports of
which are seeping into public memory and silently inﬂu-
encing our understandings of the real. An anomaly arises
when a model or framework or paradigm cannot address
an observation, or when the internal logic of a system of
thought has no provisions for a ‘new’ variable. In such
instances, the paradigm itself undergoes seismic changes in
order to accommodate the errant data – or is eventually
replaced. In this case, the deep-seated assumption that the
world is dead, that matter is mute, and that awareness is
an epiphenomenon of the brain, is being contested –
without an eﬀective retort – and is slowly giving way to
the idea that awareness, not matter, is fundamental, and
that matter is an ‘expression’ of awareness. david
Chalmers, an Australian philosopher of mind and cogni-
tive scientist, ﬁrst posed the disturbing question in the
early 90s – the hard problem of consciousness – by asking:
‘how could something as material as the brain ever give
rise to something as immaterial as awareness?’ recent
advances in neurophysiology have attempted to answer
that question by emphasizing the way chemical
changes in the brain give birth to diﬀerent forms of

awareness. While correlating states of awareness to cer-
tain neural activity has led to remarkable innovations
in that ﬁeld, there is little or no headway gained to
resolve Chalmers’ hard problem. e mystery remains,
except – as peter russell, a professor of philosophy at the
university of Arizona, insists – we let go of the untenable
idea that ‘intelligence’ is an exclusive attribute of man and
highly evolved species. 
is shamanic turn to collective intelligence also coin-
cides with even older observations made about ‘reality’
at subatomic levels. e quantum world harbours a cer-
tain weirdness, a queerness, that does not cohere with
our commonsense understandings of how the world
works. perhaps the most bizarre series of interpretation
of quantum physics, an elucidation of which this essay
cannot even pretend to attempt, is that the physical state
of things are determined at the moment of observation –
and that what we rudely call ‘matter’ behaves as if it
were actually inﬂuenced by the presence of an observer,
thus giving matter anthropomorphic features. is sug-
gests that what we call reality is porous, ﬂuid and inter-
subjective. does this explain how shamans, by altering
their wakeful states (sometimes by the ingestion of
psychedelic substances or by less invasive means like
‘sonic driving’, ritualized drumming, and other forms
of auditory stimulation), are reportedly able to tra-
verse multiple worlds, engage with subtle realms and
mysterious beings, and bring back wisdom and
guidance into ‘ordinary’ reality? 
e cracks in our established ways of knowing the
world are paving the way for a more plural, trans-
dimensional notion of intelligence – but so are the
deep psychic reconﬁgurations of our collective
unconscious. Carl Jung posited the idea of the col-
lective unconscious to describe a hive mind oper-
ating beneath individuated ego systems and across
life forms, which collects and organizes experi-
ence (oftentimes in form of archetypes). I sub-
mit, provisionally, that today’s amorphous and
widespread feelings of disenchantment with the
status quo are giving birth to diﬀerent arche-
types, diﬀerent questions, and diﬀerent orienta-
tions towards life. It seems possible to read
today’s crises as a coming of age – one that is
loosening the tight strings of human centrality. It
seems that what it means to be ‘human’ is under-
going an alchemical transmutation of some sort –
helped by the escalating cultural crises of certainty
and identity. 
Jung himself rehabilitated a rich tapestry of alchem-
ical symbolism and texts – the ancient traditions
dedicated to ﬁnding ways to transform base metals
into gold – as an exempliﬁcation of psychological
evolution. e ﬁrst stages of this transformation
process always began with the nigredo, which is a
deep blackening of the metal, or – translated into
psychological terms – a diﬃcult acquaintance with
shadows, hidden depths and suﬀering. is suﬀering
is however necessary in order for transformation to
occur. I cannot help but think that today’s crises is
creating deconstructive moments, making it pos-
sible for a deeper appreciation of just how much a
recalcitrant world ‘outside’ awaits our humiliation
– in order to speak new truths to power.

We are at our tether’s end – and there is a grow-
ing recognition that our best eﬀorts to address
today’s problems are often counterproductive
and inhibitory to true and lasting systemic
changes. e deeper consequence of aﬃrming
nonhuman worlds, porous realities, ﬂuid materi-
alities, agentic and vibrant objects, and subtle
forces more compelling than causality, is letting
go of cherished onto-theological categories like
free will and determinism. Choice and action no
longer looks the same in this cosmos-political
vision of a more democratic alliance of intelli-
gences. I ask: what would become of activism today
if we listened as much as we complained… if we
held as justly sacred a refusal to do anything at all –
just as much as we valorise conscious eﬀort? If we
saw problems as agentic forces we could listen to,
instead of blips in the machine we ought to ﬁx? If we
are connected to everything else, if agency describes
more than just human action in the world, then a poli-
tics of humility is needed to meet today’s challenges –
and by a politics of humility I oﬀer the idea of a poetic
scheme that recognizes the need to ‘slow down’ when
matters are urgent; one that realizes that to slow down
isn’t to accept defeat, but to relax the ego’s defences
enough for other forms of knowing to occur, in order to
hear other tunes that seek to be heard. A politics of
humility is one that orients us towards the shaman’s
secret: that the trees still speak.

beans in a jar, if you average everyone’s guess
together, the “group guess” will be more accurate
than the guess of any individual in that group. 
ere are levels of collective intelligence that are
very much about ﬁnding ways to simply harness
what we might call the ordinary intelligence of a
lot of individuals and combine it to try to get bet-
ter answers to questions. ere is a lot going on
in collective intelligence as a ﬁeld. e particular
piece of it that I’m interested in… I’ve even
veered away from the term ‘collective intelligence’
and more and more ﬁnd myself talking about
collective awakening or collective enlightenment
because the particular part of it that I’m interest-
ed in is really the spiritual dimension of it.
It is what becomes possible for us when we
come together in group spiritual practice, with
a conscious endeavour to speak together, to
engage together from a deeper, higher, wiser
dimension of the self. higher potentials open up
through that kind of practice that I ﬁnd very sig-
niﬁcant and exciting for our time.
Traditionally, spirituality and religion was focused
on the salvation or enlightenment or liberation of
the individual. It has been held as an individual
matter. Even if individuals came together to medi-
tate or worship, it was still about each individual’s
personal liberation, enlightenment, salvation or
transformation. 
history has shown us a lot of enlightened or trans-
formed individuals, but we haven’t seen the emergence
of enlightened collectives on this planet, of groups of
people who are able to come together beyond ego, to
come together and function beyond the conditioned
habit patterns of human nature. So the question that
has compelled me for a long time is, “What would be
possible if a group of people could ﬁnd a way to come
together beyond ego, to ﬁnd a way to come together in
an expression of our higher spiritual and evolutionary
potential? What might that give rise to? Might that
hold signiﬁcance beyond just a bunch of enlightened or
awakened individuals?” 
e world doesn’t just need more enlightened individ-
uals, more awakened individuals. at would be a
good thing. e more enlightened individuals we can
have, the more individuals who have access to a deeper
source of wisdom and compassion and creativity,
great – but if we are really going to evolve as species
and ﬁnd a way to function together that’s diﬀerent
than the way we have up until now, collectives are
going to have to awaken to higher potentials and
learn how to function in deeper and higher ways.

at’s ultimately what I would see as the higher
potential and signiﬁcance of these collective awak-
ening practices.
S. S.: how did you come to be so interested in this?
how did your own experience get you so interested
and so engaged with this work? 
C. h.: I, like a lot of us, started out on my spiritual
path very much interested in my own enlightenment
and liberation and doing a lot of individual spiritual
practice. I came to be part of a spiritual community
where we were all focused on our individual enlighten-
ment in that sense. And yet at a certain point, we
began holding dialogue groups – not because we neces-
sarily knew that there was some higher collective poten-
tial waiting for us, but it just seemed natural as a group
of people living together doing spiritual practice to
come together and talk about it, so we did.
So we came together, and we talked about spiritual prin-
ciples and teachings. We would come together and talk
about our own struggles on the path, our own awaken-
ings and breakthroughs on the path. So, we had aspects
that were more focused on the individual and aspects
that were more focused on principles and teachings. At
some point over the years of dialogue practice in this
way, we started to have collective breakthroughs into
profound higher states of consciousness, into enlight-
ened consciousness that would happen to a whole
group together at the same time.
now, when I say at the same time, I don’t mean
there would be one moment where suddenly every-
body in the group would go from an unenlight-
ened state into an enlightened state or there would
be just a single collective shift. It would tend to
happen a little more gradually. A few people
would wake up and then a few others would
wake up, and pretty soon the whole group would
ﬁnd itself on the other side of this veil, of this
barrier, and in this profoundly opened up place. 
is just started to happen naturally in our
group. And it seemed signiﬁcant to us for a
couple of reasons. one was that what was previ-
ously an inner matter – the domain of spiritual
experience, which is usually something happen-
ing when we are sitting there with our eyes
closed or maybe we are sitting with our eyes
open but our focus is within; what was previ-
ously in inner matter now started to become an
outer matter. Spiritual experience and awaken-
ing became something that was alive in the con-
versation between us. It was something that the
frontal self was engaged in. our personality was
now engaged in this process of awakening. It was
actually happening out here in the collective. 
I think the other reason it captured our attention
so much was that for all of us it felt like we were
out on the edge of human evolution. It was a sense
of new things coming into being between us that
perhaps had never happened before, or maybe
were happening currently in other places on the
planet, but things you couldn’t read about in the
history books. ings we couldn’t ﬁnd any ref-
erence to in the great wisdom traditions of the
world: this powerful experience of collective
awakening. 
And there was also a sense in this that the
group would enter into a single higher mind
together if you will. ere was an experience
of a higher being or a higher mind that the
group sort of became. We would become one
being that had many voices, many faces, but
there was one consciousness that was alive
between us and that seemed to have a will and
agenda of its own that we were all participat-
ing in and partaking in. 
It didn’t delete or do away with our individuality.
To the contrary, it ampliﬁed the better parts of
our selves. In other words, each individual was
still very much an individual and perhaps more of
an individual because they weren’t lost in a stream
of conditioned responses from their past. ey
were being liberated and freed by this group awak-
ening. It seemed to have an accelerating eﬀect on
all of the individuals involved, on the evolution and
awakening of all the individuals. In a sense, it also
became a very powerful form of spiritual practice for
the individual to participate in these groups. 
at was really what opened the door for me and I
began working with a group of people in that context
to reverse engineer what was happening in our groups
and come up with a set of practices and principles
that we could teach to help other people begin to
access this ﬁeld of collective wisdom and awakening in
depth. And so we did and started to take it out into the
world, to people outside our community and to run
experiments where we’d invite in the general public to
see if they could have access to it as well. Miraculously,
it seemed to work where even if there were just a few of
us who had been practicing this, and a large group of
say twenty ﬁve people who had not practiced it before,
there was a way we could seed the group. people would
just walk in oﬀ the street and have these experiences
and say, “I don’t know where that came from, what I
said tonight. Something came through me. I’ve never
experienced myself this way before.”
So we knew we were on to something. We got very
excited about it. As you know, I went on to research
this ﬁeld and see where it was happening elsewhere in
the world. I wrote an in-depth article about this for
What is Enlightenment magazine. en I’ve gone on in
my own teaching work because I left that community

nine years ago and went out and started my own
community and began teaching this work. is has
been a fundamental part of it the whole time, helping
groups learn how to access this depth together.
S. S.: at just sounds like an amazing experience
and one that everyone most commonly wouldn’t
have. But how do you understand the relationship, or
the relationships, between individual and collective
states of awakening? 
C. h.: Very interesting question. So I think there are a
couple of ways to look at that. one is that certainly
having, I would say having watched people go through
a process of spiritual awakening and development in
my own teaching work over the years and also having
those same individuals be doing a lot of this collective
awakening practice that I’ve been speaking about, it’s
clear to me that the more evolved, the more developed
the individuals are, the greater the potential they have
to participate in these collective awakening experi-
ments and practices that we are speaking about. 
And we can all see why that would be the case pretty
simply because there are a whole set of capacities that
one needs to have to be able to be a good – Just like
you might say, to be a good meditator, you have to
be able to focus your attention to a certain degree.
you have to be able to dis-identify with the thoughts
that are streaming through your mind so that you’re
not identiﬁed with and just endlessly lost in the
stream of thought. We could say there are certain
capacities that one’s practicing in meditation that
you get better and better at. It is really the same
with the collective awakening practices. ere is a
whole host of capacities that one needs to devel-
op to be good at entering into a collective mind,
at accessing collective intelligence, at experienc-
ing collective awakening, being able to really do
that together. And so you could say that a form
of individual development is developing all
those capacities that then enable one to really
participate at a higher level with a group. 
e other interesting side to this, though, is that
I have also seen over and over again that indi-
viduals who maybe are not all that highly devel-
oped can temporarily go into very profound
group states of awakening. ey can sort of
stumble into it because the collective has a
momentum to it and a centre of gravity to it
that’s very powerful. And if an individual steps
into that with even a basic, temporary willingness
to suspend what they already know and to come
into it with a certain innocence and freshness even
once, they can sometimes just catch the wind or
draft on the peloton of cyclists of that group, they
can get carried by the momentum of the group
awakening and the group mind and ﬁnd that they
are having access to things that are really beyond
their own level of development.
you could say it is like the individual gets access
to the developmental stage in that collective. I
don’t mean in a permanent sense, but temporarily,
if one’s willing and able to just be receptive and
open and just lean into that inwardly. It’s like
one gets the beneﬁt of all the awakening and
development that is going on in that collective
and is happening in that moment. one can
really have an experience of being propelled far
beyond where one’s own spiritual work has
taken one. at’s another interesting phenom-
enon in relation to the individual and collec-
tive piece. 
I guess the last thing I would say though is, in
addition to that, the other really interesting
thing about this is that doing these collective
practices over and over again has a profound
impact on the individual’s development. is is
almost the most mysterious part because it seems
that there’s something about taking our contem-
plative practice or spiritual practice out of just
our interior subjective domain and bringing it out
into conversation, bringing it out into the space
between us, bringing it out through our voice, our
words, our eyes, our personality in a sense. In other
words, allowing ourselves to awaken and to be
doing awakening practices while we’re fully alive
and awake, eyes open and engaged. ere is some-
thing about that that seems to infuse the whole self
with higher consciousness in a way that it sticks!
over and over again, I have heard this from people,
and it has been my own experience, that when one
has a powerful experience in a collective dialogue
practice, of awakening to this one mind, experience
that there’s one consciousness that we are all partaking
in here that’s alive in all of us together; when people
have this kind of experience, they’ll very often say,
“And it was with me all week long. ere was not a
moment of my week where I was not knowing that
higher thing that we were together in, in the group.”
ey will also say, “I could feel the whole group with
me all week long even though I didn’t see any of them
for a week,” because often people meet once a week.
ey will describe this experience of how something
happened in that one and a half hours of practice that
locked something into their self, into their experience
of being alive that now did not go away. 
And it holds new capacities, a new relationship to the
mind, a new inner freedom, a new access to creativity
and wisdom – all of these things that seem to come
online because they had this experience in a collec-
tive. Whereas people who have profound experi-
ences in meditation rarely report that. Somebody

might go and meditate and say, “oh, I had a big
deep experience of oneness and then I got up oﬀ
the meditation cushion, and within a few hours it
was gone. I don’t know where it went, but I didn’t
have any access to it anymore. I guess I need to med-
itate more to get back to it.” 
So there’s a powerful contrast here between what hap-
pens in this collective awakening practice and what
happens in our interior contemplative practices that I
think is really rich and worth a lot of exploration because
it has signiﬁcant implications for human development as
a whole – individual and collective. And, george, I’m
curious about your experience of that, what you see in
that regard because it’s a kind of very unique far out
exciting dimension of all this. 
George Pór.: I have a living inquiry into the possibility
of stabilizing that collective state of consciousness that,
Craig, you described as “one mind.” ere is an inter-
est in this because we all have some images, some
ideas, some kind of epiphany of what it is like in
awakened state of being – but we have hardly any
notion, any experience of collective awakening that
goes beyond a satori-like collective high, which is
only a momentary experience.
I listened with great interest when I heard you saying
that people are reporting that after a high collective
state, they are riding on that energy and I can share
that I have had the same experience, and sometimes
I could ride on that energy even for a few months,
but then it went away. for the sake of any kind of
coherent collective accomplishment that is making
a diﬀerence, not only for the participating indi-
viduals but for a larger system, it would be lovely
if we could ﬁnd out what it will it take to stabi-
lize those states. Any insight on that? 
C. h.: Well, I mean, practice, practice, practice,
right? I guess maybe there’s a couple of ways to
come at that. one is, “What does it take for
individuals to stabilize in these things?” We
were talking about how an individual partici-
pating in a group that is really waking up
beyond ego – when that is happening in a
group, it can start to stabilize something in the
individuals involved. And if the group keeps
doing it and keeps practicing it, then there’s a
way that the individuals become stronger and
stronger. It is like it’s providing the individual
with a new sense of identity: “I’m not who I
thought I was. I thought I was just this separate
individual moving through time and space. now
I’m starting to experience myself as inﬁnite being
or as inﬁnite becoming” – because we can have
both kinds of group awakenings. We have prac-
tices in my work to do both of those things. 
If I start to awaken to myself, let’s say as the inﬁnite
becoming, as this evolutionary impulse or what I
call the evolutionary self. We start to awaken to
that together. I start to awaken to that in a group.
I think the key here is it’s not just an inner experi-
ence I’m having; I’m actually being that person.
I’m speaking from there. I am letting it animate
me. I am allowing my old small identity to move
to the side, and I am awakening to a new
enlightened consciousness that is this profound
spiritual process of becoming. I am allowing
myself to begin to embody that, to identify
with that, to own that, to let that infuse my
personality completely, to be the voice of wis-
dom that’s coming out of my mouth. So I’m
allowing myself to actually become a diﬀerent
self, and I am identifying with that. I think why
that’s powerful as a stabilizing factor in an
ongoing way is that now I have a diﬀerent expe-
rience of myself in the world, of myself in rela-
tionship. I have a new reference point and it’s
beyond memory, it’s beyond the mind. It is like
a reference point in the beyond if you will, but it
is being brought down. is is what it means to
“bring heaven down to Earth.” you’re bringing
the divine into manifestation.
I ﬁnd that that is a very stabilizing practice. now,
of course, when you talk about stabilizing any-
thing, inevitably, the conversation turns back to
practice and what are you doing over and over
again. So the practice in this case would be doing
more of that – all of these collective awakening prac-
tices very consistently with the same group, I would
say. obviously, with diﬀerent groups can be valuable,
as well, to mix it up; but also having a stable group
that’s going deeper and deeper together, building on
what’s come before.
And now the individual starts to really have a very con-
crete new self-structure that is emerging that is really
post – it is really beyond what’s come before. It’s not
just the out-ﬂowing of what’s come before. And that
starts to become a more interesting self to be than the
one I used to be, and so there’s this total shift in orien-
tation that the person can now hold because they have
got enough practice standing there together with others.
I think that together part provides an immense support
for stabilization.
now if you are talking about, “how does a group
become stabilized in a deeper and higher place?” I
would say again, it is about consistency in that group’s
practice – of really going there again and again. of
course, as we know as spiritual practitioners, going
there again and again does not mean trying to get
back to any particular state again, but it means
doing the practice again. It just means doing the

practice again, and you do it again, and you do it
again, and you let the result keep unfolding and
evolving and being diﬀerent each time.
G. P.: at’s very inspiring what you are saying. And
as I was listening, another question came to my mind:
it’s about the relationship between a spiritual teacher,
a person who is enabling some conditions to emerge,
and the sangha, the community itself, the inter-subjec-
tive ﬁeld, as a teacher. What do you sense about the
relationship between these two kinds of teacher?
C. h.: Well, it is a great inquiry and I will tell you
george, I’m on the edge of an experiment with this
right now because I have just recently decided to be a
bit less directive and a bit less involved in all the things
that are going on in the spiritual community that I
generated. I feel like there is a level of maturity now
among enough of the participants who’ve been doing
the work pretty intensively with me in the last ﬁve
years that, I’m saying to everybody, “let’s see where
you go with this with less input from me.” So I will
have more information on that a year from now, I
think, but to speak to that sense of the kind of dynamic
between the teacher as an individual and the teacher
as the awakening sangha – ideally, I think ideally –
because we are talking about collective intelligence
after all, right? – so ideally this is an impersonal
process… 
Whatever enlightenment is, it’s got many dimen-
sions to it. here we are talking about intelligence,
which in an enlightenment context, means we are
referring to a deeper kind of knowing, a deeper
knowing faculty that becomes available to us
when we get out of the way. When we get out of
our own way, when we dis-identify with our
own mind, when we are able to sit in open inno-
cent interest and meet each moment with that,
we ﬁnd that there’s this wisdom faculty or this
wisdom capacity that comes through us – and
that’s the experience – it comes through me.
I don’t know where it comes from. It’s not my
memory, it’s not what I learned in school. It’s
some holistic knowing capacity that starts to
get stronger and stronger in the enlightened
individual. e same thing happens in a collec-
tive. ere’s a collective wisdom capacity that
starts to activate in a group that’s able to func-
tion in a higher way, in the ways we are
describing here. 
And if that’s for real, meaning that, if the group
really is going beyond the ego together, and they
really are accessing that collective wisdom capacity,
then there is no diﬀerence at all between the wis-
dom of the teacher and the wisdom of the sangha.
If they’re really doing it, there’s no diﬀerence
because it’s one wisdom faculty that’s not personal,
and it’s not my wisdom. As anybody who’s awak-
ened knows, “is isn’t me.” It’s not me in any
sense I can own it. It’s something that I’m making
myself available for, and it’s showing up. And so I
think you could say that the art of spiritual teach-
ing, as I hold it, is how to empower that in peo-
ple, their own capacity to access that wisdom fac-
ulty. I do feel that doing this together in groups
is one of the most profound ways. 
e good thing about doing it together of course
is that it’s no longer just my subjective take on
things but we are seeing it together. We are dis-
covering it together, so it’s automatically getting
validation in a sense of, “oh, we are all knowing
this. We are all accessing this, and therefore we
can trust the truth in it more powerfully.” 
We still can’t trust it completely because we
have to be good ‘post-moderns’ and know that
we might be in some collective distortion, and
we might be falling into error all together and
making an assumption that we are seeing truth.
We have to always be humble and always question
everything, but there is a reliability factor to it that
I think is quite signiﬁcant when it’s a collective tap-
ping in.
S. S.: you have spoken about how people can devel-
op capacities for inter-subjective practice that helps
groups access collectively awakened states. What are
some facilitators of the process? What are some of
the practices or skilful means for cultivating this?
C. h.: Well, I will throw out a few, and I will be curi-
ous what you have observed in your practice of this
and then I’m also curious what george would add,
since you are a very active practitioner and scholar of
this ﬁeld.
I come back to some basics when I look at, “Well, what
is it that makes this possible?” ere is this willingness to
suspend our already knowing mind, this willingness to set
it down. To make it very simple, everybody in this
group that’s going to have this conversation is not going
to reference prior knowing. We are not going to refer to
things we knew before that are sitting in our memory,
so we’re leaving memory out. It doesn’t mean memory
isn’t informing us because of course it is, but we are not
resting in memory, we are not resting in the mind. I am
not just saying, “Well, I learned something interesting
about this three years ago when I had this experience. I
read this…” or I’m not quoting other people’s knowl-
edge that I’ve read. We are not bringing in the past;
we are not bringing in past knowledge. We are com-
ing into the moment innocent, open, interested;
meaning we want to know. “I don’t know, but I
want to know.” So I think one kind of capacity is
that kind of Beginner’s Mind capacity.

Another one would have to do with where we place
our attention, learning how to place our attention.
And there are diﬀerent ways to do that. for instance,
there’s learning how to place my attention on the ﬂow
of wisdom that’s emerging between us. Because we ﬁnd
in a good dialogue, there’s a ﬂow of wisdom. one
person says something, and then another person adds
to it, and then another person adds to it, and it’s ﬂow-
ing on. learning how to pay attention to the ﬂow, how
to listen to the ﬂow – that’s another capacity. 
I guess this whole attention piece I’m talking about
could also be described as a listening capacity. ere’s
really a capacity for a deeper kind of listening that has
many dimensions to it. As you know, we have practiced
a lot of diﬀerent kinds of listening over the years in our
community, but it’s all about learning to listen for diﬀer-
ent things, learning to listen for the deeper place that the
person is speaking from. you are listening to the deepest
part of the speaker. ere’s learning to listen into this
space between us. ere’s learning to listen to the
emerging ﬂow of wisdom. So there are lots of diﬀerent
listening practices that we cultivate and facilitate. 
en there is the “Where am I speaking from?” part
of it and learning. It requires real development in
one’s self to know the diﬀerence between, “I’m just
speaking from memory. I’m just wanting to say
something I already know” versus, “no, some-
thing’s coming through me in this moment that
I’m going to give voice to,” or, “Something’s here
that I want to give voice to that’s fresh:” the fresh
arising of wisdom and learning how to know the
diﬀerence in one’s self. “What is me just telling a
story about my past? What is me just sharing a
problem because I feel disconnected and I’ve
now got some story about that that I’m going
to share?” What is the kind of speaking that
contributes to this emergent ﬂow of wisdom
and developing capacity around that?  
So we have talked about the open, innocent
interest, the deeper listening, and speaking from
a deeper place. how about you? What other
pieces do you notice are the facilitators or the
practices that enable this authenticity? 
G. P.: one is deﬁnitely having a shared inten-
tion, something that sets the context because
depending on the context, both the process
and its fruits can be very diﬀerent. So where the
context is, in terms of developmental stages, I
can imagine that a basic tone or the context can
be simply a human bond – to get closer, to get
more intimate with each other and with the col-
lective space, or it can be for the beneﬁt of the
individuals experiencing some kind of collective
highs. Even some early psychedelic experiments
created context for something like this. And there
is also possibility for a higher level of context
where the evolution of consciousness itself is what
is at stake: that we recognize that this experiment,
this conversation can actually contribute to cre-
ate new grooves, new cosmic grooves that didn’t
exist before. So that’s an enabler – to have a
shared intention. 
C. h.: Absolutely. of course, all of this can
also be applied in particular ways. It could be
to deepen our understanding of a spiritual
truth. We could come together and say, “So
what does oneness really mean?” at could be
our intention: to penetrate into that experien-
tially so we could know and understand that
more deeply in a holistic way. or it could be
that you actually want to solve a problem in
life, in the world for real. you’re going to set
the intention there but then still do all these
practices to access some depth. I love the point
that the intention helps set the course for the
inquiry, and you might get very diﬀerent
results depending on those diﬀerent intentions.
When you brought up intention, it made me
think of a couple other pieces of the practices
required here. Another one is that there is really a
requirement for everybody to take full ownership of
what’s happening in the collective. We take the pos-
ture that: “is group is me and I am going to take
responsibility for the whole group going somewhere
together.” So I’m no longer going to just do my
part, I’m going to take ownership of the whole event
that happens here, even though there are six of us in
this group. I, of course, can’t control what comes out
of anybody else’s mouth, but I’m going to own the
group as though it were myself, and I’m going to drive
toward a powerful result for this whole.”
ere’s a way this takes us out of the kind of ambiva-
lence we have about really getting too “in there” with
each other if you know what I mean. people tend to be
a little hands oﬀ but there’s a way of, if I’m really own-
ing the whole collective, then I’m naturally leaning in,
and I’m noticing somebody’s being a little quiet, so I’m
interested. “Well, what’s happening over there for you?
I haven’t heard from you in a while,” and wanting to
pull them in. Somebody else is dominating, and I’m
wanting to ease them oﬀ a little. Somebody else is
being too hyper-intellectual and so I’m asking them
questions like, “how is this arising in your experience
right now?” because I’m trying to draw them into
something more present in the moment. I ﬁnd there’s
a kind of natural facilitation that occurs when one
owns the whole process and doesn’t in any way defer
responsibility for the outcome to someone else. I’d
say that’s a powerful practice as well.
G. P.: right. And when there is more than one person
playing in that register of consciousness – of thinking,

sensing, speaking from the group as me, then there is
a leap that becomes possible. you said something
interesting that struck me. It was just almost like a
thrown-away phrase – that one of the contexts can be
solving a real world, or addressing a real world.
C. h.: problem, yes.
G. P.: at is of interest to me because so far we were
talking mostly of the left quadrants in Wilber’s terms
of the integral matrix when we are looking at the inter-
action of individual and collective consciousness with
systems and structures, and the ﬂaws in systems that
are causing unnecessary man-made suﬀering, then it’s
interesting to envision the possibility of groups that
join together in this higher collective consciousness and
from that space address issues that cannot be resolved
with just ordinary mind. I would love to see and even
more to be part of such experiments. 
C. h.: yes, it’s a big thing. I’m including talking about
great social challenges or even simply challenges in an
organization where you have real questions you have
to answer on a daily basis. “What should we do?
Should we hire this person or not? Should we develop
this new program or not?” And so often, when you
start to gain access to these deeper wisdom capacities
both individually and collectively, you just see the
limits of ordinary thinking and ordinary strategiz-
ing. It becomes kind of obvious. Well, clearly, if we
are going to come to a good answer, if we are
going to feel like we have really considered all the
possibilities and we have really solved this prob-
lem in the best way, we are going to have to learn
to listen in a deeper way and sense into the needs
of the ﬁeld. We are going to have to get multiple
perspectives on this – you just know: “I need
collective wisdom.” 
It’s so funny because in addition to being a
teacher and everything else I’m doing, I’m also
an organizational leader now because I have
started this company that has grown quite large.
I have over forty staﬀ members here now. It’s
funny. I now have a corporation, so I experi-
ence the corporate world, so to speak, in my
own organization. And the natural tendency of
human beings is to assume that individual
thinking and decision-making is how things
get done. people will pose really big, important
questions to me and just want me to answer
them. like, “What should we do? Should we do
A, B or C?” ey’ll give me this question by email
as if I’m going to say, “oh, very big important
decision. I know the answer, let’s do option B.” I
can’t even think that way. So I’m training all of
my staﬀ to say, “look, I only think collaborative-
ly,” I don’t even think by myself. literally, if I’m
alone, I wouldn’t even call it thinking. I don’t
know what I’m doing, but I’m not sitting there
solving problems on my own. We need to sched-
ule a meeting and we need to think together and
we need to sense together and explore from there. 
And more and more people realize that collective
intelligence and collaborative intelligence is the
way to solve problems. obviously, it’s got its
faults too, but if it’s properly facilitated and
helped, it will. now the impulse I heard in
your voice seemed to be pointing to a very high
level of that: of, “Well, what if we could really
be taking on major global-scale problems by
bringing together people who have the infor-
mation that would be needed, but then having
that whole group suspend their already know-
ing and go into a facilitated process that’s
going to bring forth deeper collective wisdom.”
G. P.: yes. 
C. h.: I aspire to that too. I am not currently
part of that. one of my long-term goals is to
create think tanks and things like that, social
think tanks that are grappling with big issues
from a place of collective wisdom. It’s kind of a
little beyond my bandwidth at the moment, but
a few years down the line I hope to be participat-
ing in those things. let’s stay in touch about that. 
S. S.: Could I throw in one more question? george,
when I was looking at your abstract, one thing that
stood out to me was that you spoke about the
importance of “an ethical foundation grounded in
the common good, as well as an integral evolution-
ary worldview.” Craig, I know that in your courses,
you speak a lot to motivation. Is there anything you’d
like to say about that, about the way some of your
work or some of these practices may help build the con-
text or the motivation, for people to come together to
focus on larger issues and problems in a way that could
be creative and help move development for the whole. 
C. h.: is is a very inspiring and hopeful note to end
on because one of the things that these collective awak-
ening practices do is they wake us up out of the dream
of narcissism, if you will, or out of the dream of the
separate sense of self. And there are many layers of it.
We could spend hours talking just about the diﬀerent
kinds of collective awakening experiences. george
mentioned the unity consciousness or satori, collective
satoris, but there are many diﬀerent layers of “we”
experience. I know we have probably all experienced
many diﬀerent kinds, but even at their most basic,
which you could describe as collective sort of higher
feeling states where we feel the boundary softening
between us, and we start to feel connected. ere’s
just this warm tribal loving connected feeling that
many groups have that aren’t necessarily awakening
in the sense we would mean, but they are having

these deep “we” experiences that are very nurturing
and very aﬃrming on a human level. 
Even the most basic collective awakenings, like the
ones I just described; they have the eﬀect of making
me realize that “It’s not about me.” and also that “I’m
not alone.” ere’s a softening of the ego boundaries
that begins to happen even in the most elemental of
group practices when done well. And you start to lad-
der up from that to really profound states of collective
enlightenment or even awakening to the evolutionary
impulse as ourselves together, which really are radical
departures from ego consciousness that begin to take us
to a place where we ﬁnd it harder and harder to go
back to the old egoic self because it feels so small, nar-
row, limited, partial, unreal.
But all of those, at whichever level we are talking about,
they all are beginning to reveal that there’s a natural
deeper and higher motivation that exists in human beings.
Its part of our own true nature and it is a care for the
greater good. It’s a natural care for the whole. When I
awaken beyond the conﬁnes of the separate ego, when
I awaken to who and what I really am, I realize, “I’m
not Craig, I’m not this guy who was born at a certain
time, that’s going to die at a certain time, is going to
have these life experiences, accumulate what he accu-
mulates, and whatever.” It’s like, “no, I’m this
whole process in motion. I am this whole event of
life, of cosmic evolution. at’s really what I am,
and that’s what I care about.” My domain of con-
cern now is the whole evolutionary process. When
we start to awaken to it, and I feel groups are a
powerful way to awaken to that, much more
powerful than just individual contemplation
which can still end up being quite narcissistic at
times. We start to awaken to that, and then
there is a natural emergence of, “how do I help
this whole process? Where can I be best
deployed to contribute to the higher evolution
of life, humanity, god?” It starts to get very
real and it starts to feel very important. And
george spoke to this a few minutes ago. he
said groups at a higher level realizing what’s at
stake; they realize we can contribute to laying
down new grooves in consciousness. We can
contribute to bringing the future into being.
And I think that this higher motivation is both
what brings us into the groups, and it ultimately
is a by-product of the group practice that can basi-
cally lay the foundation for a totally diﬀerent kind
of human life. If I am rooted in that, I don’t care
about the same things any more. I am not going
to spend my time in the ways I used to. I am
now going to be caring about my larger contribu-
tion to the whole, and, “What’s the greatest lever-
age I can ﬁnd and the greatest impact I can have
with the gifts and talents and precious life energy
that I’ve got?”
If we can imagine a world populated by people
living from that centre, we will solve all of our
problems. ey are not that vexing. We can do
it, but not from the self-centered ego.
S. S.: at’s beautiful, thank you, Craig. is
may have taken us full circle.
C. h.: Maybe so. yes, well, I feel like we are
just sitting here having a brief chat on some-
thing that I know is incredibly meaningful for
all of us. ank you so much for stepping up
and facilitating this, Sue. And I want to say,
george, how nice to connect again. It’s been a
long time. you and I met way back at the
beginning for me when I was just starting to
research collective intelligence. We have had
various touch points along the way, too, but it
is really nice to spend a few minutes together
and hear your voice and feel your spirit and
where your thinking’s at right now. 
G. P.: yes, I would love to have another oppor-
tunity with you to deepen some of our explo-
rations, particularly when you feel that it’s time
for you to go deeper in the possibility of the
social think tank. at’s something that I have a
great passion to explore with you. I also want to
say, Suzanne, that I’m just so grateful to you that
you drew us together with Craig. It was a wonder-
ful opportunity to reconnect, and I enjoyed every
moment of it.

Robert David Steele was born
in the USA and raised in
South America and Asia as
the son of an oil engineer.
He returned to the USA for
an AB in Political Science
(thesis on multinational cor-
porations and home/host coun-
try issues) and an MA in Interna-
tional Relations (thesis on predicting
revolution). He has also earned an MBA with a thesis in strategic
information management, and a Diploma from the Naval War
College. His professional service includes four years as a Marine
Corps infantry oﬃcer, nine years as a Clandestine Operations
Oﬃcer for the CIA, ﬁve years as the second-ranking civilian in
Marine Corps Intelligence, sixteen years as a Reserve military
intelligence oﬃcer, and twenty-one years as a private sector
proponent for intelligence reform and open source everything.
He seeks ﬁnancial and institutional sponsors able to embrace
and implement these ideas.

Activity (MCIA), that the uS secret intelligence
program, which costs toward uSd 100 billion
a year, is largely worthless1. It is also representa-
tive of how other governments approach the
craft of intelligence – as something that is
secret, expensive, and in service to a few man-
darins instead of the general public. Subsequent
to my own awakening, general Tony zinni,
uSMC (ret.), then Commanding general of
the uS Central Command (uSCEnTCoM), at the
time involved in two major wars and over twelve
“interventions” elsewhere, went on record with
his judgment that uS secret intelligence was pro-
viding him, as commander of a major regional
theatre command, with “at best” 4% of what he
needed to know2.

our objective is to overturn centuries of top-
down elite control focused on value extraction for
the 1% to the detriment of humanity at large: the
99%. hybrid governance3 overturns hierarchical
governance rooted in corruption enabled by
secrecy. open Source Everything and open

innovation while eradicating corruption and
waste. e end-game is quite clear and is root-

tect existing concentrated wealth in return for a

Intelligence is not about secret sources and
methods. Intelligence is not about “inputs.”
Intelligence is decision-support. Intelligence is a
process of requirements deﬁnition (what do you
need to know), collection management (who knows
what we need to know), multi-disciplinary and
multi-lingual collection, a combination of machine
and human processing and analysis, and ﬁnally, the
production of decision-support. Intelligence must
be deﬁned and evaluated on the basis of “outputs”
and the utility to the public and to those represent-
ing the public. Anything less is a corrupt misdirec-
tion of public funds5.
My own appreciation for Collective Intelligence rooted
in public minds and public needs can be traced to Tom
Atlee’s ﬁrst book, e Tao of Democracy6. Tom intro-
duced me to Jim rough, pioneer of dynamic facilita-
tion7, and to many others. It is from Tom that I clearly
understand that my own focus now on Applied Collec-
tive Intelligence is part of a much larger mosaic. I share
with Tom the view that “wisdom of the crowds” is a
perverted mis-representation of what humanity is capa-
ble of achieving when engaged in an interactive respect-
ful conversation instead of being treated as small unin-
formed opinions in isolation8, and I share with Tom a
concern about those who seek to deﬁne collective intel-
ligence as something to be achieved artiﬁcially,
through machine intelligence and automated net-
works isolated from the spiritual, the cultural, the
context of humanity in its day to day life.
over the years Tom and I have talked about how
helpful it is to clarify for those not familiar with
intelligence as a craft (a speciﬁc process, generally

but not advisedly done in secrecy) how it is diﬀerent
from intelligence as a human capacity for acquiring
understanding and wisdom. Ever since I began champi-
oning open Source Intelligence (oSInT) in 1988, I have
been operating in the area below Applied Collective
Intelligence9. It is my on-going conversation with Tom
that led to this graphic being created.
My emphasis for the past quarter-century, mis-direct-
ed as it turns out, has been on teaching over 66 gov-
ernments how to better access and leverage open
sources, in other words, I have been trying to ﬁx the
left or red side of the above duality10. I failed, in part
because of the corruption endemic to the secret
intelligence world, where spending vast amounts of
money on secret technical collection – mass sur-
veillance – is proﬁtable for the few while being
unaccountable to the taxpayers for any absence of
a return on Investment (roI). Although I have
always understood the value of oSInT to the pub-
lic, it is only now that I am focused on helping
the public devise a capacity to confront and bury
all lies on all topics at all levels in real time.
recently – in the past ﬁve years, inspired in part by
herman daly, father of ecological economics, and
by richard Stallman, the foremost pioneer along
with linux Torvalds of free, libre open Source
Software (floSS) – I have conceptualized the com-
bination of holistic Analytics with True Cost Eco-
nomics11 and open Source Everything (as outlined
in my latest book, but not noticed until nafeez
Ahmed proﬁled the idea in e Guardian)12.
With this article I present a brief roadmap for
achieving Applied Collective Intelligence.

ese are the ten high-level threats to
humanity. ey are in priority order. ey
are useful as a means of measuring the
degree to which any particular govern-
ment’s policies and programmes are relevant
to protecting their respective populations
and promoting prosperity.

ese ten high-level threats are also a helpful starting
point for any university, government, or other orga-
nizations seeking to be genuinely multidisciplinary in
its strategic, operational, tactical, and technical
processes and programmes.
ese particular threats, in this particular order, are
slightly ﬂawed in that they do not reﬂect the contin-
uation today of unilateral militarism, virtual colo-
nialism, and predatory capitalism. ey also do not
include the potential threat of technology run amok,
both in bio-chemical chain reactions and in computa-

We are at the end of the Industrial Era in
which scientiﬁc and technical achieve-
ments, and organizational achievements,
have been abundant, and at global scale. unfortunate-
ly, these achievements generally have been divorced
from ethical foundations as well as the real-world
needs of the poorest, consequently being abusive of
humanity at large in the long run. Western colonial-
ism, unilateral militarism, and predatory capitalism
have been dominant these past two hundred years19.
Such “analysis” as has been done has favoured the
interests of the 1% over the 99%, and neglected a
respect for “ground truth” as well as any attempt to
establish “true costs” of any given policy, service,
product, or behaviour. Without belabouring both
the achievements and the shortcomings of the
Industrial Era, my focus now is on how best to
achieve remediation toward a prosperous world
that works for all.
one starting point is recognition of the fact that
governments are merely one of eight informa-
tion “tribes” or networks, and generally the least
informed and the least agile. for some time
now, since I ﬁrst conceptualized the “smart
nation” in 199620, I have been thinking that
there are many sectors of society with knowl-
edge that is not shared. Eight groups in particu-
lar concern me. ey are, in alphabetical order:
ACAdEMIC ~ CIVIl SoCIETy ~ CoMMErCE ~ goVErnMEnT
~ lAW EnforCEMEnT ~ MEdIA ~ MIlITAry ~ non-goV-
ErnMEnT
Civil Society includes labour unions, religions, and
activists who are not organized into non-govern-
ment non-proﬁts. Media includes bloggers and
alternative media. My core point is that we are frag-
mented across society in a manner that makes it vir-
tually impossible to “do” Applied Collective Intelli-
gence. Completely apart from the reductionism char-
acteristic of the Westerner whose approach to gover-
nance and science assures the isolation of each of these
tribes from one another – and within the tribes,
the separation among organizations, and within
and among organizations, the isolation of individu-
als who lack access to one another and to the infor-
mation they think is relevant to their varied
responsibilities.
Applied Collective Intelligence seeks to leverage
open source information and open source informa-
tion technology speciﬁcally, open source engineer-
ing generally, to empower all eight of these tribes
toward the creation of the World Brain and the abil-
ity to work together in a hybrid form respectful of
the future – our goal is nothing less than a prosper-
ous world at peace, a world that works for all21.

True Cost Economics, within which I include all possi-
ble feed-back loops and all possible aspects of holistic
analytics such as political-military, socio-economic, ideo-
cultural, techno-demographic, and natural-geographic
costing22, is the essential foundation for assuring that
humanity is pursuing sound policies and behaviours in
relation to our fragile Earth and its extraordinary ecology
of plants, animals, and matter that we are now under-
standing is not a “solid” per se, but rather a particularly
dense conﬁguration of energy.
In practical terms, true cost economics demands that we
conduct research and document, for any given product,
service, behaviour, or policy: the water content; the fuel
utilized from creation of the raw materials through pro-
cessing, transport, sales, and end-use; the degree of child
labour, regulatory violations, and tax avoidance inherent;
and of course the speciﬁc toxins released into the atmos-
phere, into public water bodies, or into the earth.
here is just one example: for a single white non-organic
cotton T-Shirt, the true costs include 570 gallons of
water; 8 kWh in energy used by machines; 11-29 grams

of fuel; varied emissions of nox, So2, Co2,
n2o, and other volatile compounds; and in
toxins, 1-3g of pesticides along with diesel
exhaust and heavy metals (in dyes). Child
labor across any of seventeen countries, earn-
ing 50 cents a day, is also a cost for any given
cotton T-Shirt as traditionally produced23.

Starting with the ﬁve major “spheres” deﬁned
by others that comprise the Earth, I add the
human subsystems (the natural-geographic
subsystem is the whole) and then strive to
make the point that the feedback loops
among all these systems are what we need to
understand if we are to reduce the negative
outcomes on the left and increase the positive
outcomes on the right.
Aside is a complementary and excellent
depiction of Total Impact Measurement
and Management (TIMM), a signal contribu-
tion from priceWaterhouseCoopers Interna-
tional in the united Kingdom24. It is a help-
ful means of illustrating how any given
activity, behaviour, policy, product, or ser-
vice can be – must be – analyzed in relation
to its economic, social, and environmental
impacts, among others.
Academia, the economy, government, and
society are not structured – nor trained to
think – in this fashion. We are at the end
of centuries of reductionism dismissive of
true costs and obsessed with short-term
ﬁnancial proﬁts that beneﬁt the few at the
expense of the many including all genera-
tions into the future. e true costs of all
this misbehaviour are now converging to
threaten all humanity.

open Source is not, as many assume, simply
a legal and technical concept referring pri-
marily to software and increasingly also to
hardware, denoting that the software or
hardware is freely available and open to both
redistribution and modiﬁcation without sub-
stantive encumbrance.
open Source Everything (oSE) is a meme, a
mind-set, and a philosophy of education,
intelligence (decision-support), and research.

larger ecology.

fIgurE 5 ~ Open Source Everything (Partial Depiction).

What really matters about the above partial repre-
sentation is that we must treat all of them as an ecol-
ogy and go “all in” across all the opens. open data
without open hardware and open Source Software
is merely gifting all our data to corporations that will
continue to impose the wasteful costs of proprietary
software licensing fees, training, and maintenance,
costs that most local governments and small businesses
are now ﬁnding impossible to continue paying.
In commercial terms, oSE is a means of harvesting the
Cognitive Surplus of a broadly distributed, self-motivated
network25. of particular note is that oSE is the only tech-
nical approach that is aﬀordable, inter-operable across all
boundaries, and scalable toward the 5 billion people
whose needs are not responsibly addressed by the acade-
my, economy, government, or society of the present.
oSE is the ethical, intellectual, commercial, and legal
underpinning for the emergent new economy that is
collaborative, ethical, inclusive, and sharing in nature. 
e essence of ﬁnancial proﬁtability for Applied Col-
lective Intelligence within this new economy lies in a
mix of free education combined with licensing, ser-
vices, and the monetization of transactions. oSE can
be licensed in multiple forms using Creative Com-
mons designations, such that the code, to use a soft-
ware example, is open to modiﬁcation and redistrib-
ution, but cannot be used to collect ﬁnancial remu-
neration without engaging the originator.  
Creative Commons is a viable legal construct but
not yet fully established in law or in technology to
the extent that it actually protects social enterpris-
es and their intellectual rights26.
oSE is the underpinning for local to global infor-
mation-sharing and sense-making, allowing for
the eﬃcient harvesting and harnessing of cultur-
al, historical, and linguistically speciﬁc informa-
tion across all boundaries, human, ﬁnancial,
and technical. e term of art for the human
aspect is Multinational, Multiagency, Multidis-
ciplinary, Multidomain Information-Sharing
and Sense-Making (M4IS2)27. I shorten that,
instead of using the acronym, to Multinational
Everything. In combination with oSE, a pre-
dominantly technical term of art, the two
deﬁne a virtual World Brain in which all minds
eventually are connected to all information in
all languages and domains, all the time and –
this is really important – all humans have infor-
mation tools with which to make sense of it all
and achieve direct democracy and deliberative
dialog across all boundaries.
My book, e Open Source Everything Manifesto,
and the home page for the topic28, together oﬀer
additional insights into the larger context and
potential application of this concept.

for over a quarter-century others and I have been
pointing out that the current approach to govern-
ment intelligence (emphasizing secrecy and mass
technical surveillance) as well as the current approach
to commercial intelligence (emphasizing indus-
trial and cyber-espionage) are deﬁcient29. In my
view, over 90% of what we need to know to be
eﬀective stewards of the Earth and productive
citizens is not secret, not expensive, and not har-
vested by governments, corporations, or even
universities.
Since I have published so much about open
Source Intelligence (oSInT) I am reluctant to
repeat or even summarize that body of work
here30. Instead I draw the reader’s attention to a
ﬁve points:
1 ~ My experience has shown that there are 33
core languages, including 11 dialects of Arabic,
that are required if one is to be comprehensive
about exploring human knowledge in any given
domain. I know of no government, corpora-
tion, or university that is serious about doing
multi-disciplinary research across this range of
core languages – and even less so across the 150
additional languages I and others have identiﬁed
as being relevant if one wishes to be competent in
understanding all local challenges and emergent
solutions.
2 ~ Today, as “big data” is becoming fashionable, I ﬁnd
that no one really understands the obstacles to doing
big data at exascale levels, and that no agency – least
of all the uS national geospatial Agency – is compe-
tent at oﬀering a suitable geospatial platform for
machine speed data fusion31. Although googleEarth
and Keyhole Markup language (KMl) are useful, they
do not accommodate non-geospatial data. CrisisMap-
pers is of great interest to me, along with open-
StreetMap, but both will have diﬃculty scaling and
neither they nor google Earth have a sparse matrix
unstructured database architecture ready to go to hold
all information in all languages and all mediums in
relation to the geospatial foundation. A major task
for Applied Collective Intelligence, apart from foster-
ing acceptance of open Source Everything and
Multinational Everything, will be to establish new
data standards that are, in addition to open, geospa-
tially grounded.
3 ~ Analytic competence across sources, processing,
back oﬃce and desktop toolkits, and meaningful
access to decision-makers, is marginal at best. We
still do not have, in one integrated suite of tools,
the eighteen functionalities identiﬁed in 1989 by
the Central Intelligence Agency as necessary for

any analyst to make the most of the data assigned to
them. I consider all analytic toolkits today to be fraud-
ulent in their claims and ineﬀective in their perfor-
mance32.
4 ~ Even the most prestigious universities fail the smell
test when one looks at the degree to which profes-
sors cite relevant works from beyond their small
established circles – and certainly almost never in
other languages. university research is, in two
words, incestuous and pedestrian. At the same
time, recognizing that some excellent work is
being done here and there, the fact is that
roughly 1% of scientiﬁc research that has been
carried out actually gets published33.
5 ~ oSInT is primarily about human contacts and
human conversations and human insights
arrived at among humans34. It is not, as the
American spies have sought to deﬁne it,
about surﬁng the Internet with uS citizens
whose only qualiﬁcation for being present is
that they have a Top Secret clearance. In my
view we are at the beginning of a renaissance
in the role of the university as a catalyst for
education, intelligence (decision-support)
and research; the university must again
become central to civilization.

ere are two terms I want to bring forward
here, the ﬁrst is ephemeralism and the second
is embedded intelligence.
Ephemeralism, coined by Buckminster fuller35,
refers to the ability to create more with less. In
today’s environment of “cost plus” contracting,
this is not done. e true cost of any given prod-
uct or process is not considered. Waste on the
order of 50% is documented36 – but welcomed
because proﬁts – and kickbacks to politicians – are
calculated on the basis of the total ﬁnancial
cost. Intelligent design integrating bio-
mimicry37 and deeply appreciative of both
true costs of resources and future eﬀects of
toxins is not standard. We are now at a
point where ephemeralism can be achieved
by leveraging oSInT.
Embedded Intelligence is characterized as
the ability of a product, process or service to
reﬂect on its own operational performance,
usage load, or in relation to the end-user or
environment in terms of satisfactory experi-
ence. is self-reﬂection is facilitated by infor-
mation collected by sensors and processed
locally or remotely to derive insight. ese
aspects must be considered from the design
stage such as to enhance product lifetime and
performance, increase quality of process or ser-
vice delivery, or ensure customer satisfaction and
market acceptance38.
e above graphic combines the original concept
focused on the manufacturing aspect, with my
new concepts focused on the decision-support to
design aspect.
e prevailing approach to EI is that of IBM and its
“Smart Cities” concept. is is an example of doing
the wrong things righter39. doing the right thing
would involve adding True Cost Economics as Sup-
ply Intelligence, holistic Analytics as demand Intelli-
gence, and open Source Everything as Engineering
Intelligence. Taking this approach will, I believe, cre-
ate a new gold standard for both the emergent disci-
pline of embedded intelligence, and the emerging disci-
pline of integral decision-support. My focus is on a
complete re-design of the academy, the economy, gov-
ernment, and society, to embed intelligence in what we
build, how we build it, and how we use it.

open Source Everything is how we enable local to national
and then international governments, universities, and all oth-
ers to share data while respecting anonymity, identity, pri-
vacy, and rights. is is the only aﬀordable, interopera-
ble, scalable solution. ose that limit themselves to
open data (retaining proprietary approaches to every-
thing else) are destined for failure, and more rapidly so
when corporations refuse to share their own data with
the government.
True Cost Economics is how we transform the entire
data ecology of any given community – all stake-
holders and not only the government – so as to radi-
cally reduce waste and achieve design and engineer-
ing eﬃciencies simply not contemplated nor real-
ized beforehand.

holistic Analytics – transparent, truthful,
and inspiring of public trust – is our larger
method.
open Source Engineering is the applied out-
come of all of the above. It creates smart safe
communities in which waste has been eradi-
cated and corruption is so transparent as to
be quickly eradicated.

I have concluded that education, intelli-
gence (decision-support), and research are
now badly trained, equipped, and orga-
nized. Changes must be made. My intent is
to make it possible for every government
element, every other organization, and
individuals, to access information relevant
to their mission or interest across all
boundaries, while being able to aggregate
and exploit that information rooted in geospatial and
time-date visualization, aggregated by threat or policy
domain, and further separable for consideration at each
level of analysis: strategic, operational, tactical, techni-
cal.
is depicts my overview of Applied Collective Intel-
ligence as a constructive force for academia, the
economy, governance, and society.
I will not belabour the elements, other than to note
that the six terms in the inner circle – Ephemeral-
ism, human Scale, panarchy, World Brain, Smart
nation, and global game – are all central to
Applied Collective Intelligence.

despite my continued emphasis on the centrali-
ty of the human factor (computers are tools –
artefacts – nothing more40) I ﬁnd it helpful to
always single out human rights including the
rights of anonymity, identity, privacy, and rights
generally to one’s own labour and intellectual
property.
It is also helpful to observe now, as Vampire
Capitalism comes face to face with its own
demise41, having destroyed its seed corn, the pro-
ductivity of the public, that religions and philoso-
phy matter. Although Will durant has done more
than most to address the critical role that integral
education and a proper philosophy play in address-
ing “the social problem42,” it is E.o. Wilson, in his
book Consilience: e Unity of Knowledge43, who
answers the question, “What is the relation between
science and the humanities, and how is it important
for human welfare?” As authors from John ralston
Saul to Matt Taibbi have documented44, when sci-
ence and capitalism do great harm to humanity,
they are out of control and must be stopped.
Today we see the re-emergence of religion along
with consciousness and spiritual exploration and
new forms of civic dialog in which the govern-
ment is recognized as being unable to govern and
only one of eight larger human organizational ele-
ments that must learn to share. Islamic economics
and ﬁnance are coming to the fore as being more
ethical and respectful of human needs45, than secular
“anything goes” Western capitalism of the goldman
Sachs variant. Similarly e Most holy father of the
Catholic Church has recently reversed the decades of
repression against the Jesuits and liberation eology,
and sought to make a new compact with the poor46 –
the ﬁve billion poor whose annual aggregate income is
four times that of the one billion rich47.
human rights are central to the liberation of the
inherent intelligence and innovative possibilities that
humans, uniquely among all living species, appear
capable of. It should also be clear by now that plants
and animals are not just alive, but conscious and com-
municating with one another48 hence they merit our
respect and eventually we must be able to integrate
what they know into our larger understanding. lastly,
I would suggest that humanity is on trial and failing
the ultimate cosmic test. We have allowed the 1% to
fence the commons, criminalize natural behavior49,
and sponsor programs of war and bio-chemical hazard
inimical to humanity and to all living creatures50.
Applied Collective Intelligence re-uniﬁes religion, phi-
losophy, and science. Applied Collective Intelligence
restores as our human goal the creation of a prosperous
world at peace, a world that works for all. In passing,
Applied Collective Intelligence protects the 1% from the

ere are ﬁve organizational initiatives I would like to
see sponsored by any single government, altruistic
corporation, or visionary university – or any combi-
nation thereof. e below graphic depicts four of the
ﬁve, with the ﬁfth, an open Source Everything
Innovation hub, being methodical rather than
institutional.
SChool of fuTurE-orIEnTEd hyBrId goVErnAnCE.
is is envisioned as a new residential school
with an extension program for non-resident stu-
dents, as well as a very robust program of faculty
and student exchange, joint investigations,
shared online databases, and other forms of out-
reach to universities, governments, corporations
and non-governmental organizations around
the world. While proposed as contingent on
earmarked funding, the School could neverthe-
less be started as a virtual entity from existing
human, physical, and ﬁnancial resources. A
new building and green village complex are
envisioned with twelve wings – one each for
each of the eight information networks or
tribes51 as well as the four Centres shown above.
My intent is to create a model that can be replicated
– and adapted – to any local circumstance.
1 ~ Within the School there would be a provost
Centre for Comprehensive Architecture where all
of the schools and departments of the larger uni-
versity might form an intellectual, data-sharing,
and methods council – the new high table of acad-
emia. is Centre would also take on the vital task
of ensuring that anonymity, identity, privacy,
and rights are properly protected within all
development, while also championing an
Autonomous Internet52 and liberation Tech-
nology53.
2 ~ e global (Serious) game as the interac-
tive manifestation of the open Source Every-
thing Innovation hub applied to real world
challenges using real world information –
this is where all True Cost information can
reside in a sparse matrix connected to a
local to global digital open source map that
allows any citizen to see the speciﬁcs and
totality of all true costs in relation to any-
thing of interest to them.
3 ~ e World Brain Institute as the local
to global proponent for extending the plat-
form to every organization world-wide,
while empowering individuals via the four
online domains:
A ~ World-Brain.net strives to register as many as
wish to in a manner that both validates their
identities when such validation is essential to the
process and they opt-in; while also providing them
with reliable anonymity & privacy, as well as means
of reserving rights related to any knowledge or data
they share. is is not a revenue producer, but this
captures billions of human minds that can be mone-
tized through the other three online networks.
B ~ World-Brain.Edu strives to be the platform for
persistent pervasive free online education for life,
while also serving as a foundation for any individ-
uals and organizations who wish to organize local-
ized face to face and both physical and online
human to human educational options. is will
take testing and tutoring as well as team learning to
entirely new levels of excellence and eﬀectiveness.
C ~ World-Brain.org is a revenue-producer and makes
the university the hub for M4IS2 world-wide at all lev-
els of practice from local to global. from knowledge
gap identiﬁcation to research funding and new forms
of co-investment (including the harnessing of cogni-
tive surplus and crowd-sourcing) to new forms of
quality control that eradicate plagiarism and optimize
Creative Commons credit and compensation, this
aspect seeks to double or triple the return on invest-
ment of the existing research base while cleansing it
of waste from redundancy and corruption related to
plagiarism and poor sources and methods.
d ~ World-Brain.Com is a revenue producer imple-
menting the herring Triangle54 of shared monitor-
ing, shared help desk, tailored decision-support, tai-
lored strategic forecasting with its local to global
online structured and validate information commons

(displacing the erratic and shallow archipel-
ago of unreliable and biased sources today),
its local to global distributed network of
help desks (reference librarians without
borders augmented by information bro-
kers, private investigators, investigative
journalist, citizen activists, and so many
others), and of course as a central registry
for commercial intelligence with each
source having a validated record of past
performance.
3 ~ e Centre for public Intelligence is the
model that can be replicated at any level
anywhere by anyone using free open
source software and hardware that in
turn enables localized free open cloud to
open spectrum public agency. e value
of the whole is found in its clarity, diver-
sity, integrity – and the sustainability it enables55.
e School (or Institute) that I envision would lead the
way in creating a new phd/dBA in Applied Collective
Intelligence and open Source Everything / Engineering.
graduates would master holistic Analytics including
Citation Analytics, Time & Space Analytics, and True
Cost Analytics; True Cost Economics; open Source
Everything as engineering and technology manage-
ment; and hybrid governance sources and methods.
e ultimate outcome is the transparent, truthful inte-
gration of all information in all languages all the time,
such that all individuals and organizations across the
eight information tribes are empowered in a manner
never before achieved. is ﬁnal graphic depicts my
“atomic” vision in which the above institutional and
methodological initiatives create a Whole (human)
Mind favourable to a Whole Earth.

cultural narratives, perspectives, world-
views and disciplinary orientations and
dilate our hearts and minds into the
more expansive and inclusive global
space whence our diverse worldviews co-origi-
nate and co-arise, striking new patterns and
insights come into relief that were not accessible
before. When we dilate our rational and spiritu-
al intelligence into the ((Source field)) and gain
access to the long emerging ((logos Code)) that
ﬂows through all our diverse worldviews, reli-
gions, ideologies and cultures we move from
monologue to ((deep dialogue)) and enter this
primal Common ground of deep consensus,
convergence, connectivity and synergy across
and between worlds. is evolutionary crossing
and maturation from cultures of “monologue” to
awakened Cultures of dialogue is the key to the
cultivation of Collective Intelligence.
is deep dialogue literacy, technology and intelli-
gence is what empowers us to rise together in ((Col-
lective Intelligence)) across the deeply entrenched
borders that divide our cultures and worlds. gaining
access to this ((primal logos Code)) through the
rational arts of deep dialogue is thus key to cul-
tivating genuine ((Collective Intelligence)) in
this dilated global light. e ontological medi-
cine of deep dialogue across and between
worlds is vital for cultivating authentic ((Collec-
tive Intelligence)) and tapping the resources of
((global Wisdom)) for our global Age.
Source Intelligence, skills of deep dialogue and
the cultivation of global Consciousness are essen-
tial to the authentic cultivation and embodiment
of Collective Intelligence as we face the evolution-
ary challenges of deep communication and ﬁnding
consensus and synergy across borders. us, we
cannot enter ((Collective Intelligence)) within the
divisive, fragmented and polarized spaces of mono-
logue cultures, but must mature as mindful and
awakened humans in the arts of deep dialogue.
We are not egosapiens, but logoSapiens. And it is in
mature dialogue cultures that we humans ﬂourish.
In what follows we shall ﬁrst take a journey together
into the depths of the long emerging ((Source Code))
to experience how and why this collective global Wis-
dom of the ages calls upon us with highest urgency to
evolve into cultures of deep dialogue. en we shall go
deeper into a meditation on Seven Stages of Deep Dia-
logue – a living blueprint for this perennial Collective
Intelligence as we humans evolve from monologue to

My lifework as a logician and ontologist has been
focused for ﬁfty years on pioneering deeper pathways
into the primal logic of logos that has been the mov-
ing passion of our most gifted and revered teachers
(ﬁrst philosophers, logicians, ontologists, awakening
guides…) across the planet and through the ages.
Awakening pioneers such a Buddha, Krishna, Moses,
Jesus, Socrates, lao Tzu… to name a few… have
been calling humanity to go deeper into the primal
Code of logos as our most urgent evolutionary pri-
ority in our maturation as humans, as logoSapiens.
e diverse traditions of first philosophy across the
planet have all been seeking to tap and bring forth

the primal Code of the field of reality – of at
Which is primal and first – as our ultimate con-
cern in our maturation and ﬂourishing as humans.
e term “first philosophy” comes from Aristotle as
he seeks to tap the Code of Being in recognition that
this is first in the highest sense and all other ﬁelds,
disciplines and aspects of human experience and cul-
ture ﬂow from this Code of primary Being. But this
tradition of first philosophy – the Call to What-is-
first – ranges across the planet and through the ages in
our highest and best pioneering teachers: e Call of
yahweh to Abraham and Israel = humanity, the deep
meditations on AuM in the founding of the Science of
yoga at the heart of the Vedas, the historic break-
through of Buddha in breaking the egomental barriers
and moving into the primal field of Emptiness (Sunya-
ta) which is the field of reality and the Space of dhar-
ma (=honor Code: awakened moral compassion), the
encounter of Moses at the Burning Bush (=presence of
Inﬁnite Spirit), the founding of the European tradi-
tion of the quest for logos (the primal Source of
rational light, Speech, Word) by Socrates, plato,
Aristotle… in birthing “philo-Sophia”… love of
Wisdom in the quest to Know y Self… In the
classic birthing of Chinese first philosophy by the
genius of lao Tzu in declaring that the Tao that is
“named” is not the TAo. 
is relentless quest for What-is-first shows up in
Mohamed’s historic encounter with Allah – the ﬁrst
authentic name in this tradition of “first Script”.
And, of course “Islam” means “surrender to what is
first”. All of hindu Vedic ought turns of deep-
ening the meditative intelligence in the authentic
encounter with primal reality in awakening the
true mature Self. All of the classic sacred Text of
the Gita, for example, is lord Krishna guiding
the fallen egomental “Arjuna” into the transfor-
mative pathways of yoga Science which is Vedic
first philosophy and Technology. And, of
course, the breakthrough teachings of Jesus –
the logos in flesh – passionately suggesting that
the Code of logos must be lIVEd in the first
person and not objectiﬁed and “written in
stone”… is another great moment in first phi-
losophy deeply in sync with the global quest for
our authentic encounter with reality, with
What-is-first.
It is no exaggeration to suggest that this perenni-
al gravitation to get the access Code for What is
first is the highest and most urgent concern for
our human enterprise – for our survival, sustain-
ability and both individual and collective ﬂourish-
ing as a human family in our awakening evolu-
tionary journey. e relentless quest of our most
gifted philosophical minds to get the “logic”… the
Code… of this “primal field”… this logos res-
onates on a planetary scale through the ages. So, for
example, the pioneering ﬁrst philosopher,
descartes, calls his pivotal work “Meditations on
First Philosophy” as he focuses his genius on reach-
ing the ultimate foundations of reality and Con-
sciousness. And in that historic moment when he
reached “I am” after stepping back from the cul-
tural spaces: mental lens, ideologies, disciplines,
logics, narratives and languages that formed his
life, experience and meaning… he crossed into
the Source Code, the Source Script of What-is-
first. And here he accessed and tapped the
same ((Source Code)) of logos that our revered
teachers, enlightened voices, and moral pio-
neers across the planet embodied in their lives:
Socrates, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Jesus, lao
Tzu, and Mohamed to select some key global
exemplars.
is is the appropriate context to situate my
lifeWork over the decades at the College. My
quest to ﬁnd the hitherto missing (eclipsed, dis-
placed, repressed, ignored, denied, dreaded…)
primal logic of the Source field that funds all
life, issues forth as reality, the universe, Cos-
mos… took unprecedented breakthroughs over
the past four decades.
is is the unprecedented “global” turn (break-
through, evolutionary advance, maturation, devel-
opment, emergence…) in the quest for the primal
Word (Code, logic, field, ontology…). My life-
long quest to uncover the deeper missing (yet ever
present and presiding) Primal Logic of the Word across
our great philosophical traditions and noble scriptures
led me (called me, attracted me, guided me…) to gain
deeper global access to the emergent Code. e discov-
ery that Moses, Socrates, Buddha, Krishna, Jesus, et al…
were tapping the same ((Source Code))… the same
global logic of logos would be an evolutionary advance
(research breakthrough) of the highest order.
I shall not (and cannot) develop these rich themes here
on this occasion. ese themes have been developed in
my several volumes and countless public performances
over decades. is has also been a primary focus on my
Annual ((reﬂection on Activities)) over the past decade
and more. I bring this central theme of my research,
scholarship, teaching and community development to
the fore on this occasion because this breakthrough to
the ((primal Code)) is of supreme importance for our
human enterprise, for every aspect of our human con-
dition, and certainly for our rational enterprise and
deepening our ((literacy)) and liberal arts cultures.
let’s pause and ((imagine)) for a moment that such
diverse revered teachers as Moses, Jesus, Buddha,
Socrates, Krishna, lao Tzu are pioneering pathways

into this ((primal Code of logos)). But once we
access this ((Code)) it is the most Simple, Evident
and obvious insight imaginable… so super simple
and obvious that we cannot (dare not) “see” it. for
once we see that the primal field is, and must be,
Boundless… this ignites a ﬂood of allied Code
Insights that have been seen, corroborated, reaﬃrmed,
celebrated… in widely diverse contexts by our great
Teachers and Traditions across the planet. e Bound-
less primal field (of reality) is thus Inﬁnite, hence Inﬁ-
nitely one, hence the primal Source of all possible
worlds, words, scripts, narratives, perspectives, religions,
scriptures, cultures, ideologies, disciplines, forms of life.
And most of all… must be Inﬁnitely herenow. is
Inﬁnite primal field of Being (primal Word, Code,
origin, Source, Existence…) CAnnoT be displaced and
pushed aside, even by the mightiest “egosapien”. our
Teachers knew and saw that nothing could be or sur-
vive apart from this ((Source field)) that directly holds
and funds any and ever iota of existence. 
ThIS IS ThE gloBAl Turn. When I use the word “global” as
in global reason, logic, literacy, philosophy, Ethics,
Wisdom…as I do in my diverse publications, perfor-
mances, courses and seminars… this is what I am
bringing forth: “global” as in global logos: indicates
the primal Source Code of all possible worlds and
words and scripts. And the key breakthrough of my
career is pioneering deeper pathways into global
logos, into the global Source Code of all scripts,
narratives, languages, cultures, disciplines and liberal
arts. It is self evident that Source Code MuST BE
“global” in this sense. “god” (Tao, AuM, Christ,
Allah, yahweh, Sunyata, reality, presence…) must
be “global”. Source Word (language, literacy,
Intelligence, reason, logic…) must be “global”.
And here is one key to how I was guided in this
monumental discovery. My early research in
logic and ontology, together with my relentless
quest to discern how we cross diverse worldviews
(cultures, religions, disciplines, ideologies, log-
ics…) led me into the depths of our diverse great
teachings on a global scale. When I encountered
one of my great heroes, Socrates, I saw his pas-
sionate call to logos and the urgency of leaving
the “caves” (uncritical, un-awakened, everyday
cultural life and consciousness) and entering the
rational light as we sought to “Know y Self”. 
When I encountered Buddha’s great teaching –
his enlightened noble truths and onto-medical
diagnosis of the source of human dysfunction and
suﬀering – I was again deeply moved. When I
encountered Jesus and his urgent call to cross into
Christ field- as the logos in the flesh… I was
deeply stirred. I noticed that Jesus and Socrates were
executed for their “radical” Source Code teachings.
for they challenged their colleagues at the deepest
level- and shook their “foundations”: their world-
view and privileged “script” processing. I noticed
that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Socrates, Krishna…
were Moral r-Evolutionaries calling us to deeper
encounter with Moral law and Awakened ratio-
nality. But there was no “common ground”, no
common rational grammar yet in place to “dis-
cover” that they were tapping the “same” global
logos Source Code. ere was no “global
logos” yet pioneered and brought to light. My
deep quest to discover how we cross worlds,
how we move rationally (communicate, trans-
late, dialogue and even chronically violate one
another…) across diverse cultures and worlds –
diverse philosophical worlds and traditions and
logics…led me inexorably to the missing glob-
al Source logos funding all possible worlds,
cultures, religions, narratives, disciplines, and
perspectives. 
e continued dominance of the “pre-((Code))”
stage of literacy and mentation in our human
condition across the planet blocked direct access
to the ((Source Code)) hence blocked and neutral-
ized (under-minded) the potent ((rational Awak-
ening Medicine)) of our Source Code Teachers.
We could not ((see)) that Krishna, Buddha, Moses,
Socrates, Jesus, Mohamed, et al were, indeed, tap-
ping the same missing primal Source Code. In fact
this is the simplest ((truth)) imaginable… god and
Allah, and yahweh and Brahman… as holonyms for
((Inﬁnite first)) hAd to “hang out together”. at is
what it means to be ((Inﬁnite first)). ere cannot be
multiple “Inﬁnite firsts”.
only when we truly face and remove these literacy and
mentation blocks and barriers encoded in predominant
literacy practices could we ﬁnally ((discern)) the pro-
found cross-links and common source ground across
diverse worlds, religions, scriptures and pioneer teach-
ers. And the essence of my life-long research into the
foundations of logic, language, reason… focused here
on calling out the chronic barriers and bringing into the
((open)) the long-eclipsed ((Code of logos)). We shall
see in a moment why the nature of pre((Code)) literacy
and mental practices inherently fragmented, polarized,
shattered our words, our worlds and our lives and
lodged us in existential crisis and mal praxis.
e more I investigated our great Code pioneers the
more I was led into deeper “global waters”. I had to
dilate my mental lens and tap deeper rational resources
to truly encounter widely diverse ﬁrst philosophers and
evolutionary elders. As I encountered the profound
first philosophy of hindu Vedic teachings, such as
the teachings of lord Krishna in the great epic Bha-
gavadgita it was strikingly clear that the broken

“Arjuna” in his imploded life crisis turned to Krishna
(the embodied Voice of AuM) to help him face his
ontological crisis. And lord Krishna’s teaching to
Arjuna (and humanity) of the Science and Art of yoga
is precisely the urgent task of facing the medical source
of his imploded life and trans-habituating his life into
the Integral Technology of Aum Script- AuM Code.
Arjuna (the stand-in for the “normal” egomental human)
had to learn the higher literacy of the AuM Script,
through meditative intelligence (integral Code literacy)
and exit his dysfunctional mental patterns of egomental
life and the dysfunctional culture lodged in “samsara”, the
ontological condition of severance from AuM, the primal
field of reality. ((Aum)) and ((yahweh)) and ((Allah))
and ((Tao)) and ((logoSophia)) are ((holonyms)) of
((Inﬁnite presence)).
What became strikingly clear in my research journey is
that our great Code pioneers across the planet in widely
diverse contexts nevertheless concurred in their onto-
medical diagnosis of human pathology and dysfunction,
and each in diverse ingenious ways opened transforma-
tive pathways into the primal global Code of awak-
ened moral life. Buddha saw that being lodged in ego-
mental life (taking your “self” to be an entity that is
self-sourced) is the medical source of human existen-
tial suﬀering and his breakthrough to the four glob-
al Truths in simplest terms called on humanity to
break the addiction to egomentalism and ego-based
cultural life and literacy and advance to e dhar-
ma – to surﬁng the primal field of reality wherein
everything “co-arise” in relational ﬂow. is is
being in-the-zone of Awakened life. Buddha
essential medicine (prescription) was the urgency
of recognizing the pernicious consequences of
/egomentalism/ and the challenging onto-med-
ical rehabilitation of our lives and mental prac-
tices into the Buddha field of Emptiness. is is
where we become liberated from the entrap-
ment in mental mal praxis and shift into
human ﬂourishing. is was his prescription
for all humans lodged in existential suﬀering.
Whether Socrates calling us to higher rational
light (logos) in leaving the caves of un-awak-
ened life (“Know y Self”; “the unexamined life
is not worth living”), or Jesus calling everyday
folk to “die” to the old ways (sin script) in order
to be “reborn” in the Christ life, or Krishna urg-
ing and guiding Arjuna (humanity) to leave the
“samsara” of pre-awakened consciousness into the
yoga life in AuM… the deep onto-diagnosis of
dysfunctional cultural life in “sin” or “samsara” or
“cave ignorance” is striking. ese sample Code
Teachers recognized that humanity is lodged in
mentation patterns that cut us oﬀ from Source Code
and the highest urgent medicine is our facing this
condition and having the courage to shift to awak-
ened and liberated life that comes with conscious
access to the primal Code. gaining awakened access
to the Code of logos is the ontological medicine
for our evolving human condition when encoun-
tered in global light. us, the ((Source Code)) is
always already ever-present ((funding)) = ((sourc-
ing)) us in every way, yet we remain self-eclipsed
from ((direct access)) by our /mental practices/
and /life worlds/. e pathways to ((access))
((Source Code)) is to ((awaken to Source)), to
evolve to ((I am))...to live ((mindful lives)).
I know this is all highly compressed. But it is of
the highest importance that we get the consen-
sus diagnosis and prescription of our most
revered global teachers. My breakthrough to the
global Code and ﬁnding the common ground
across such diverse teachings came through the
intersection of my work in deep logic and ontol-
ogy. e rational tools I gained through logic
(the grammar =code of thought) empowered me
to see that our diverse Code pioneers were indeed
in a common quest, and hAd to be. for the sim-
ple ((truth)) seen through the dilated ((global
lens)) is that ((Source Code)) = ((Inﬁnite first)) =
((Inﬁnite presence)) = ((logoSphere)) is by its
((nature)) inherently ((global)). 
e /thought/ that ((god)) = ((Inﬁnite first)), for
example, is /local/ or /Tribal/ or /Ethnic/ is bizarre.
e ((Inﬁnite Code)) = ((Inﬁnite logos)) must be the
funding source of all possible /words/ and /worlds/
and /narratives/. We can’t push it away or package it
or step outside “it” no matter how hard we try. ((Inﬁ-
nite presence)) presides herenow in every detail, in
every ((grain of sand)), and every grain of ((man)). To
discover and name the “global logos”, the global Inﬁ-
nite Word was a key evolutionary advance. And, for me,
the de-conﬂation of the two contrasting though inti-
mately related dimensions of the Word (language, Men-
tation, lens power, Meaning, Truth, Knowledge, Experi-
ence, learning, Being human, Community Cultiva-
tion…) through the introduction of the two potent
“dimensional markers”: “/x/” vs “((…/x/…)) was essen-
tial: ((…)) marks out the ((Source Script of presence))
while /…/ brings out the mental-linguistic space and
technology of “/talk about it/”. 
I saw, for example, that the diagnosis of “sin” and “sam-
sara” converged on the same objective human ontologi-
cal condition: both were focusing on the deep split or
severance of everyday life and culture from the fund-
ing Source = e primal Code. I took a bold step and
connected “sin” and “samsara” as diﬀerent names for
the same onto-logical diagnosis- both were lodged in
/egomental/ patterns that were severed from ((honor
Code)). And East and West concurred that when

thus severed from ((Source Code))… whether yah-
weh, AuM, Tao, Allah, Brahman, Christ,
logoSophia… we humans suﬀer individually and
culturally and live dysfunctional lives. And the highest
onto-medial prescription for human flourishing is to
break these debilitating patterns and evolve to awak-
ened rational life in ﬂow with the zone of reality. is
comes with a shift from /script/ to ((Script)). our
“script” encodes our “life” and “consciousness”.
is is where I found it imperative as logician and
ontologist to bring into the open an innovative nota-
tion to help us recognize and remember when we are
lodged within /egomental reason/ and /language pat-
terns/ and when we cross into the ((Code Script)) of the
rationally Awakened life. My simultaneous introduc-
tion of these Code Markers: “/…/” vs “((…))” to bring
to the fore the dimensional shift from /word/ to
((word)), from /code/ to ((code)) is of the utmost
importance in ﬁnally seeing the ((global power)) of the
((logos Code)). And this vital notational innovation
ignited a ﬂood of new ((insights)) into the long dor-
mant ((Common ground))… the ((Source Code)) of
our great ((evolutionary pioneers)). And it is evident
how our Teachers insisted that the ((Inﬁnite Word))
cannot be /named/ or rendered within the /script/ of
pre-Awakened mental praxis and literacy.

It became clear in my evolving research over decades
that the endemic conﬂation of the contrasting
dimensions of /language/ (script, literacy, word-
power, mental practices…) and ((language)) con-
tributed to the chronic failure over millennia to
receive and process the full ((Transformative Code
Medicine)) of our great Teachers. My innovative
notation is meant to de-conﬂate the contrasting
dimensions between /word/ and ((Word)),
between /code/ and ((code)) between /logos/ and
((logos)), between /self/ and ((Self))… us, the
introduction of these Onto-Cultural Markers is of
supreme importance for our human enterprise.
our Code pioneers were making an all-important
and urgent call to humanity to ((up Script)) from
/word/ to ((Word)), and not to /down-load/ their
((Code Teaching)) to /egomental codes/ and /lan-
guage games/. 
By bringing to the fore the vital shift in a ((Visible
Font)) from /culture/ to ((Culture)), from /scrip-
ture/ to ((Scripture)), from /Buddha/ to ((Bud-
dha))… for example, opened the way for everyday
folks (such as students) to stand back from deeply
entrenched mentation (= thought) patterns and
((see)) as never before the urgent ((Code Call)) of
our evolutionary Awakening Teachers. e millen-
nial conﬂation of these two dimensional of life and
culture and literacy facilitated and enabled the con-
tinued /default/ mode of the evolutionary domi-
nance and privileging of /Script/ and the displace-
ment of ((Script)). humanity has been stuck in
this default mode of privileging (alleged) self-
sourced /Script/ as the primary and dominant /lit-
eracy regime/ in town. And this is why our evo-
lutionary ((markers)) to expose this fatal fallacy,
calling it out for accountability and making it
impossible for /Script/ to continue the decep-
tion of being /self sourced/ is of highest impor-
tance in allowing the ((Source Medicine)) to
take eﬀect.
is breakthrough explicitation of the ((inter-
dimensional)) shift and contrast between /word/
and ((Word)), /life/ and ((life)), /ethics/ and
((Ethics)), /reason/ and ((reason)), /truth/ and
((Truth)), /meaning/ and ((Meaning)), /scripture/
and ((Scripture)) dilates a long emerging evolution-
ary upgrade (maturation) in our human journey.
We can see across the planet that the pre-Evolved
“conﬂation” of the /language/ and ((language))
has been a monumental barrier to our rational
health and ontological Well Being. is endemic
“conﬂation” made it too easy, perhaps inevitable, to
continue to “download” ((Script)) to /script/, the
((Word of god)) to /word of god/. e “default”
script invariably collapsed to “/…((…))…/” – swal-
lowing the ((Source Word)) into the /egomental/ lan-
guage games. When ((Buddha Speaks)) his “speech” is
downloaded into our everyday common sense, familiar
language, our lingua franca: “/…((x))…/”, and the
((Source Code Medicine)) is lost. ((god)) becomes
down-sized to /god/. Instead we have been called by our
((Code)) pioneers to ((cease and desist)) in this pandemic
addiction and called urgently to ((up-Script)) and rise
to ((Code)). And this shift has been seen by our great
Teachers as a ((life)) and /death/ issue. is is why
making the ((dimensional shift)) highly ((visible)) to the
public and ((user friendly)) is of highest importance in
gaining the ((literacy)) of being ((human)). is is why
so much of my creative life has been focused here.
To SuM up: gaining direct ((access)) to the ((Source
Code)) is life and death for us, as our ((Teachers))
have insisted. is shift to ((Source life)) is our matu-
ration as Whole persons… as ((I===ou)) beings…
as ((logoSapiens)) and this is the ((literacy)) of Col-
lective Intelligence. is is the literacy and technology
of deep-dialogue.
once we truly de-conﬂate the two dimensions of liter-
acy and Intelligence astounding new insights abound.
We can see that “/…/” language development is an
important stage in human evolutionary development.

is is a vital stage in our evolutionary develop-
ment: to use language to convey /information/ and
use /words/ to describe or represent the /world/ and
build /culture/ is a necessary early stage of rational =
human development. We ArE as we “script”.
is “/…/” stage of evolutionary development is
endemic across the planet in all our cultures. It includes
the mental or consciousness practices, the level of “lens”
development and capacity, the “hermeneutical” or inter-
pretation powers, the stage of “meaning”, language capac-
ity, experience capacity, communication practices, mind
operating processes, etc. All of these go together and are
incorporated into “/…/” language and life development. 
is level of “language” and “mentation” development
is naturally endemic, pandemic across the planet in the
life of the people. It is a generic /language game/ across
cultures and worlds: it is an “equal opportunity” evolu-
tionary pre-((Code)) stage of development, pervasive in
our human condition. Simply put it is the habit of
“talking about” any given “x”. is /informational/ or
/representational/ stage of language, literacy and men-
tation is vital in our early development and survival.
But, as our great ((Code)) teachers have taught, we
humans must evolve (mature, grow) in our rational
Intelligence (language Capacity) and gain direct
access to the ((Source Code)) that funds and makes
it possible to have /words/, /worlds/, and /language/
and /talk about it/. I call this stage of human devel-
opment: /egomental/ or /monocentric/ life. But it
would be a ((fatal mistake)) to remain stuck at this
stage which tends to act and live as if /words/ are
/self-sustaining/ and not always held, supported
and sustained by ((Source field)).
In oThEr ((WordS)): our ((Code)) pioneers saw
clearly that any form of life that, in eﬀect, is
severed (alienated, eclipsed, split…) from
((Source field)) is lodged in dysfunction which
matures into human pathologies and patterns
of violence. And it invariably inhibits our full
maturation as ((persons)) and inhibits ((Well
Being)) and ((human flourishing)).
e ((Code Intelligence)) makes clear that no
/word/, no /human/, no /event/, no /world/, no
/narrative/, no /discipline/, no /language/, no
/culture/… could survive for a moment if sev-
ered from ((Source field of reality)). We cannot
“ego” apart from ((Source Code)), we cannot use
language, have experience, be alive, think, feel,
say “I”, reject ((Source)), deny “god”… whatev-
er… without the continuous direct funding of
((Source field)).
In ((fact)) we “humans” can nEVEr actually sever
funding relations with ((Source field)), BuT we can
create /stories/, we can create /barriers/, /defenses/,
/cave culture spaces/, /religions/, /academies/, /ide-
ologies/, /worldviews/, /institutions/…/political pat-
terns/, /disciplines/… that perpetually displace,
eclipse, cover up ((Source Code reality)) that
holds us, feeds us, funds us and make all these
mythologies and forms of life possible.
is means that /monocentric/ cultures or narra-
tives or lives that act as if /self sourced/ and self-
sustaining are in bad ((faith)). ere is an inherent
ontorational self-deception and cover-up at the
heart of any and all such forms of life. In ((Bibli-
cal)) terms this is the condition of ontological
/sin/ - the self created breach and break and
alienation from ((Source)), and in ((Meditative
Science )) terms this is /samsara/- being caught
on a self perpetuating and inter-generational
karmic cycle of ignorance, delusion, self-decep-
tion, sophistry due to the severance from ((Source
Code reality)) whether ((named)) ((AuM, god,
Brahman, Christ, Allah, Emptiness, logos, Sophia,
Tao, reality, e primal field, presence…)) is
is the heart of what our revered ((Source Code pio-
neers)) saw, diagnosed and addressed with powerful
Code Medicine. 
is, for example, is the essence of what Buddha
discerned in his enlightenment – the source of
human dysfunction and suﬀering and mal praxis.
is is what ((Jesus)) sacriﬁced for – taking on our
/sin/ that we may be liberated. is is the essence of
lord Krishna’s ((yoga Technology)): helping /Arju-
na/ see that his life and culture and meaning and
ethics imploded because of this /samsara/ breach. And
((Source Code)) empowers us to see across borders that
the deep onto-diagnostic and /sin/ and /samsara/ are
alternate names for the same medical crisis: ((SinSara)).
Brieﬂy put: Every /x/ is ((x)): We are always already sit-
uated within ((…)) = the ((primal Source field of Inﬁ-
nite presence)). And any and every “word” /x/ gets its
being and voltage from ((…)), from ((x)). us,
((Source Word: logos)) provides the ((voltage)) for any
item whatever, and sources every sign or word:
“/pen/” dilates when Sourced into “((pen))”
/pen/ is a packaged, objectiﬁed /entity/ within the
mono-centric language games;
but ((pen))… ((seen and uttered)) within the ((Source
Word zone)) ignites with boundless ((fractal mean-
ing)): this ((pen)) is mightier than the /sword/.
And so with every “word”: monocentric self sourced
/words/ are anemic in ((meaning))
while any such “word” spoken or expressed from the
((Source Semantic field)) ignites with boundless
((meaning)) and ((truth force)).
is, for example, is what descartes discovered
when he left /I/ and entered ((I am)).

Any /scripture/ magniﬁed and lights up in ((mean-
ing and Source Code power) when processed as
((scripture)). And so on.
is ((Source Code)) dilation and re-location is true
of every “x” in existence.
us, /English/ matures into ((English)) when authen-
tically ((Code Sourced)), and so on.
And here we ﬁnd a Primal Law: ((Every /x/ is ((X)) )): =
((…/x/…)).
us when we say “/I/”, our Code Teachers recognized,
we cannot avoid ((/I/)).
ThIS IS A MonuMEnTAl dISCloSurE: our evolutionary
journey is from /I/ to ((I am)). is ((I am)) is
((I===ou)) =We are ((dialogue Beings))… and this
is where ((Collective Intelligence)) ignites and mani-
fests. is is where we can reach ((common ground))
and ((consensus)) across /borders/.
is captures and sums up the heart of our diverse ((glob-
al enlightenment)) teaching: our so-called “high Self”:
Source Self, Awakened Self, Evolved Self… is always
already intimately ((close)), and the greatest awakening
journey is to dilate from /I/ to ((I am)). And the classic
pathway to open this maturation space from the artiﬁ-
cially /objectiﬁed/ “self” lodged and constituted in its
/ego identity/ is to let go… (stand back, detach, open
deeper source space…) dilate and ignite deeper ((Self
Identity)) is ((Source Code onto-Semantic field)).
is evolutionary journey from /self/ to ((Self)) is the
adventure into ((Awakened rational life)). is is
our ((educational enterprise)).
ThIS IS An ASToundIng “gAME” ChAngEr. e clari-
ﬁcation in ((global light)) that the emergent
((Source Code)) is and must be the same
((logos Code)) for our diverse great Teachers,
indeed, of all our worldviews, cultures, scrip-
tures, disciplinary narratives…has astounding
implications for our evolutionary journey, not
to mention our liberal arts enterprise. is
dilation to the ((logos Code)) as the ((Source
Code)) for such diverse pioneers as Moses,
Buddha, Krishna, Socrates, Jesus...makes ((evi-
dent)) the rational Common ground of the
global truth-force of these teachings.
for example, the rational validity of the Code
Teaching of ((Jesus)) is not that he is “Son of
god” and therefore his teachings are universally
valid. It is rather that ((Jesus)) as the ((logos in
the flesh))… as the ((Embodied Christ Code)) =
((…)) is bringing through the ((Source Code)) of
Awakened reason which reveals that we humans
are ((I… ou)) Sacred Beings, not /I…It/ entities
that can be /objectiﬁed/. ((persons)) are ((dialogue
Beings)) and when we upScript to this Christ Code
we enter the space of deep dialogue Compassion,
rational Intelligence and Moral life. In this respect
the ((honor Code)) is the ((Source Code)) that our
Moral Teachers were dilating and tapping.
Again, the yoga Technology that lord Krishna is
teaching – the AuM Code – calls upon folks to let
go of the dysfunctional /egomental/ patterns of
life and culture and rise = up((Script)) to the
AuM zone which is the sacred space of ((I
ou)) Moral flow. So ((yoga)) is not /yoga/.
And a moral pioneer such as gandhi…living
this AuM Script and gospel ((Script)) is assisting
humanity in the all-important evolutionary
advance from /ethics/ to ((Ethics)), from /truth/
to ((Truth force)).
And the validity of Buddha’s ((four noble
Truths)) for all humans is not form the author-
ity of “Buddha” as an “Enlightened Teacher”…
but from the objectivity of the ((Source Code))
the ((logos Code)) which is the Moral dharma
(law) of ((I… ou Compassion)). e essence
of Buddha’s breakthrough ((Medicine)) is that
we are not self-sourced /atomic entities/ but lib-
erated persons (beyond /entities/) in ((Buddha
zone)) the ((logoSphere)). So, too, for Socrates
and his quest for the ((logos)) and the 
rational light…
ese are prominent examples. My decades of
research and scholarship takes us through the evolu-
tion of these amazing traditions and great innovative
teachers as this unfolds through the centuries into the
21st Century. once we have access to the missing
((global logos Source Code)) we are able to detect
profound ((patterns)) and key missing ((links)) across
borders as the centuries unfold. for example when we
fast-forward to descartes’ ((Meditations)) we can now
see clearly that when he pressed his “doubt” experiment
to the limit he saw he could call into /doubt/ any
/thought/ or /proposition/ in the prevalent /cultural
mental spaces/. And when he boldly crossed into the ((I
am)) in quest of ultimate “foundations” of rational
life… we can see that he left the /egomental/ culture
space and crossed into the ((logos zone)). his break-
through ((I am)) cannot be down-scripted to /I am/ as
scholars who conﬂated ((language)) and /language/
invariably did. But a competent ((meditative reading)) of
descartes’ ((Meditations)) makes clear that descartes
was pioneering a dimensional shift into ((Source
Code)), the Source of ((rational light)).

is ﬁrst encounter comes with a certain shock, with a
realization of an other, a diﬀerent way of life, a diﬀerent
worldview, an alien other that resists, interrupts, dis-
rupts my settled patterns of interpretation. With this pri-
mal encounter there is a new realization that my habits
of mind cannot make sense of this other. is radical
encounter with diﬀerence, a diﬀerent world, a diﬀerent
way of making sense of and experiencing the world is
disconcerting, sometimes threatening, and evokes a vul-
nerability to this alien presence. I have a new sense of
delimitation and I feel challenged to change, to revise
my way of relating to this other. I realize now that my
habit of translating the other into my pattern of
“minding,” of appropriating the other to my world-
view, is dysfunctional. I am forced toward a self-criti-
cal-thinking. So I face a sudden silence, pause, open-
ing, an open horizon of uncertainty and risk. I must
make a decision to move forward, or draw back.

After the initial shock and realization that I now
face an alien world, a worldview very diﬀerent
from my own, I feel challenged to inquire,
investigate, engage and enter this new world, to
engage in critical-thinking. As I open my Self to
this other I realize that I need to stand back
and distance myself from my former habits
and patterns of minding the world. I begin to
realize that this other world organizes and
processes the world very diﬀerently from my
way. I realize that I must learn new habits and
ways of interpreta tion to make sense of this
diﬀerent world. I must learn a “new lan-
guage.” Indeed, I must translate myself into a
diﬀerent form of life that sees the world diﬀer-
ently. is involves a bracketing, a setting aside
of my prejudices. I feel a new horizon opening.

I begin to feel a new and deep empathy for my
new habitat; I want to let myself go, free myself to
enter, experiment, learn and grow in this new way
of being, to embrace critical-thinking. I hold on to
my prior views as much as I can, but I do
advance in a conservative fashion. Still, I experi-
ence an excitement in discovering, in inhabiting
a new and diﬀerent worldview. I have a new
profound realization of an-other, an alternative
reality and form of life. But in the end I realize
this is not my home. But what IS my home? I
experience a deep shift in my lifeworld. Who
am I? What is my true identity? Is this other
part of me? Is my world transforming now?

I now cross back, return, to my own world,
bringing back new knowledge of how to think
and act (critical-thinking), and may even wish to
adopt/adapt some of it for myself. As a result of
this primary Encounter with the world of the
other, I now realize that there are other ways of
understanding reality. I am therefore open to
rethinking how I see myself, others and the world.
I encounter my Self and Culture anew, with a
newly opened mind. My encounter with radical
diﬀerence now challenges my former Identity, and
everything begins to appear in a new light. ere
now begins a dramatic deepening of my sense of my
Self, my Identity, my Ethnicity, my life- world, my
religion, my Culture… ere is no return to my for-
mer unilateral way of minding.

As a result of this new encounter with Self, when I cross
back from my deep encounter with an other I begin to
experience a profound shift in all aspects of my world,
in my inner experience, in my encounter with others, in
my relating to the world. I begin to realize that my
encounter with the other has shaken the foundation of
my former worldview, my former identity. for now
that I am mindful of the living reality of other worlds,
other perspectives, I can no longer return to my former
identity and forget this living presence of the other.
Indeed, I now begin to realize that there are many
other worlds, other forms of life, other perspectives
that surround me. I now open to a plurality of other
worlds and perspectives and this irrevocably changes
my sense of Self. I feel transformed to a deeper sense
of relation and connection with my ecology. I feel

more deeply rooted in this experience of connectivi-
ty and community. I now see that my true identity
is essentially connected with this expansive network
of relations with others. is is the ignition of the
dialogical/Critical Awakening.

In my transformed dialogical/Critical Awakening I dis-
cover a deeper common ground between the multiple
worlds and perspectives that surround me. I have a new
sense that Self and others are inseparably bound togeth-
er in a boundless inter-relational web. I realize that mul-
tiplicity and diversity enriches my Self and my World. I
now see that all worlds are situated in a common ground
of reality and that radical diﬀerences are nevertheless sit-
uated in a ﬁeld of unity. I experience three related
dimensions of global dialogical/Critical Awakening:
A ~ An ever deepening discovery of Self: I become
aware of a deep inner dialogue within my Self. I dis-
cover a rich multiplicity and diversity of perspectives
within my own inner world. In this inner dialogue I
feel increasingly more deeply rooted and grounded
in my world. My Identity is enriched with multi-
plicity and I experience a more potent sense of my
uniqueness as I celebrate my expanded world of
shared relation with others and with the Ecology.
B ~ A dynamic dialogue opens with others in my
Community: As my new inner dialogue and criti-
cal-thinking evolves I ﬁnd myself in a new and
transformed relation with others who share my
world, my tradition, my religion, my culture.
is new phase of relations with my peers can be
disorienting and disconcerting, for as I now dra-
matically grow in my Identity I ﬁnd myself in
an estranged distance from many of my peers,
even as I discover a deeper aﬃnity and embrace
of my community, my polis. I face a new turbu-
lence, miscommunication and misunderstand-
ing with my colleagues and a challenging and
dramatic dialogue unfolds in my polis.
C ~ A global Awakening emerges in all aspects
of my life: As this inner and outer dialogue/criti-
cal-thinking matures I realize that my under-
standing of my world enters a new “global” light:
I realize that I am surrounded with many world-
views. I enter a global horizon and a global con-
sciousness in which inter-religious, inter-cultural,
inter-ideological, inter-disciplinary, inter-personal
dialogues abound in all directions. I now have a
new globalized sense of reality, a dialogical domain
in which multiple alternative worlds are situated in
dynamic ever-deepening relations. With this under-
standing comes a new attitude to life and to ethics.

As this paradigm-shift in my life matures I realize
that there is a deep change in all aspects of my
life, a new moral consciousness and a new prac-
tice. As my new dialogical/critical consciousness
becomes a habit of life I ﬁnd that my behaviour
and my disposition to Self and other has blos-
somed. I feel a new sense of communion with
my Self, with others and with the Ecology. I
realize that the deepest care for my Self essen-
tially involves my care for others and for the
environment. I have a deeper sense of belonging
to my world, to my community, and with this a
boundless sense of responsibility in all of my
conduct. I now realize that I am transformed in
the deepest habits of mind and behaviour. I ﬁnd
a deeper sense of Self-realization and fulﬁlment
and meaning in my life and my relations with
others and the world around me.

is has been quite a journey. We suggest that as
we mature individually and collectively through
these seven stages of ((dialogue literacy)) we
mature as persons, as dialogue Beings and ﬂourish
in the technology of ((Collective Intelligence)) across
borders. We cannot truly enter Collective Intelligence
when ledged within the dominant patterns of ego-
mental patterns of language and thought and world
making. Cultures of /monologue/ block and preempt
genuine ((collective intelligence)). is is itself a con-
sensus or collective wisdom of the ages. True ((democ-
racy)), for example, is a call for ((We the people)) to
come together in ((deep dialogue cultures)) where we are
empowered to celebrate wide-ranging ((diversity)) in the
midst of ((connective unity)): E Pluribus Unum. ((We
the people)) cannot blossom within cultures dominated
by patterns of egomental monologue. And our future
turns on our capacity to move individually and collec-
tively, with highest urgency, to mature cultures of deep
dialogue and ((Collective Intelligence)).

Amit Goswami is Professor
Emeritus in the theoretical
physics department of the
University of Oregon, Eugene,
Oregon, US where he has served
since 1968. He is a pioneer of the
new paradigm of science called
“science within consciousness”.
Goswami is the author of the
highly successful textbook Quantum
Mechanics that is used in Universities
throughout the world. His two-volume textbook
for nonscientists, e physicist’s View of nature traces the decli-
ne and rediscovery of the concept of God within science.
Goswami has also written many popular books based on his research
on quantum physics and consciousness. In his seminal book, e Self-
Aware universe, he solved the quantum measurement problem elu-
cidating the famous observer eﬀect while paving the path to a new
paradigm of science based on the primacy of consciousness.  Subse-
quently, in e Visionary Window, Goswami demonstrated how
science and spirituality could be integrated. In physics of the Soul
he developed a theory of survival after death and reincarnation.
His book Quantum Creativity is a tour de force instruction
about how to engage in both outer and inner creativity. e
Quantum doctor integrates conventional and alternative
medicine, while in god is not dead he explores what quan-
tum physics tell us about our origins and how we should live.
In his private life, Goswami is a practitioner of spirituality
and transformation. He calls himself a quantum activist. He
appeared in the ﬁlms What the Bleep do We Know, e
dalai lama renaissance, and e Quantum Activist.
He teaches fairly regularly at the Ernest Holmes Institu-
te; the Philosophical Research University in Los Angeles;
Paciﬁca in Santa Barbara, CA; and UNIPAZ in Portu-
gal, and is a member of the advisory board of the Insti-
tute of Noetic Sciences.
hE ACTrESS AngElInA Jolly By hEr rAdICAl
mastectomy because of a high proba-
bility for contracting breast cancer has
increased our awareness of the suﬀering
that this tragic disease brings to women
worldwide. e truth is, every year roughly 3
million people contract this disease and thou-
sands die.
Angelina’s case was special because her situation
was hereditary. But many cases of breast cancer
is not hereditary, is not due to any genetic abnor-
mality and the question arises, Could it be that in
these cases the physical symptoms – cancerous
growth – is not due to any physical cause at all? If
there is a nonphysical cause and we can under-
stand it, can we treat the disease at the root and
heal it? furthermore, if we can understand the
cause of these cases of cancer, could we prevent
the cancer by eliminating or minimizing the
cause in the ﬁrst place?
Conventional medicine practitioners are not
very friendly to such questions because of their
“everything is matter” and “genetic abnormali-
ties cause most disease” philosophy.
Quantum physics leads us to a diﬀerent philos-
ophy: Consciousness is the ground of being in
which there are four worlds of quantum possi-
bilities: material, vital, mental, and archetypal
(which I call supramental). Choice by conscious-
ness from material possibilities gives us material
objects of sensing. When consciousness chooses
from the possibility-movements of the vital world,
we experience vital energy movements of feeling.
Choice from the mental world, mind, gives us
meaning objects of thought. And choice from the
supramental gives us the archetypal objects of intu-
ition such as love (goswami, 2004). e individual
manifest worlds of our experience do not interact
directly but only through the intermediary of con-
sciousness with nonlocal, signalless communication
(quantum nonlocality). 
is scientiﬁc validation of our subtle experiences of feel-
ing, thinking, and intuition, opens the door for the vali-
dation of alternative practices of medicine that postulates
important disease-causing role to imbalances of the subtle
movements of our experience (goswami, 2004). for exam-
ple, vital body medicine practices (Traditional Chinese
Medicine [TCM], the Indian Ayurveda, homeopathy) hold
that imbalances or blocks of vital energy movements asso-
ciated with our organs and their interactions cause many
diseases. Mind-body medicine practices hold that imbal-
ances and blocks in our processing of mental meaning
cause some of our diseases. And so forth.

vital energy in the breasts and in the related organs
of importance to healthy breast functioning. Also
of importance in TCM is the movement of vital
energy in the channels called meridians that connect
interacting organs.
In the early days of medicine, when Traditional Chi-
nese medicine was formulated, very little was known
about the vital body. Boldly, the Chinese thinkers
used a modiﬁed version of the ﬁve-elements theory of
matter and space (the classiﬁcation in terms of earth,
water, air, ﬁre, and vacuum or empty space) to get a
grip. But being good empiricists, they also took into
account what they empirically knew about the organs.
ey discovered that organs aﬀect organs in two ways,
either in a supportive role or in a controlling role.
Accordingly, they renamed the corresponding vital
energy elements as: earth, water, wood, ﬁre, and metal.
Earth nourishes metal in a supporting role, but metal
cuts wood in a controlling role.
In this way, TCM practitioners would say that the
female breasts, liver, and stomach are connected by
support and control. erefore, they emphasize the
importance of keeping the ﬂow of vital energy in
these organs and between these organs unblocked
and balanced. is means we pay special attention to
the ﬂow of vital energy in their channels of commu-
nication, namely, the liver meridian and the stom-
ach meridian. Balance in the conceptualization of
TCM means a balance between the complementary
aspects – yin and yang – of vital energy (chi).
TCM is especially eﬀective as a preventive medi-
cine. If we keep the vital energy balanced and
unblocked in the way described above, we can
prevent cancer, is their point. Empirical data
supports their view.
Modern science improves the theory quite a
bit. I have already spoken of how quantum
physics and the concept of psycho-physical
parallelism makes the concept of vital energy
scientiﬁc. Balance in this approach means a
balance between particle and wave modality of
the ﬂow of vital energy, a balance of what is
and what is possible, in other words a balance
between conditioning and creativity in the
mode of movement.
now add new insights in the biological theory
of form-making, morphogenesis. e biologist
rupert Sheldrake noted that morphogenesis,
how a one-celled embryo, through cell division
that creates identical replicas, can grow all the
diﬀerent organs of the body with diﬀerentiated
functions depending on the where in the body
the organ lies, gives rise to a paradoxical question
– how does the cell know where it is in the body?
Accordingly, there must be new nonlocal and
therefore nonphysical organizing principles, call
them morphogenetic ﬁelds that are instrumental
in biological cell-diﬀerentiation and form-making.
When we combine the lesson of quantum psy-
cho-physical parallelism with Sheldrake’s mor-
phogenetic ﬁelds, we can see clearly that the
morphogenetic ﬁelds are the blueprints of bio-
logical form that consciousness uses to make
organs. Each organ then has a “correlated”
(through consciousness and quantum nonlo-
cality) morphogenetic blueprint in the vital
body. e conglomerate of these morpho-
genetic ﬁelds associated with all our organs is
what we call the vital body.
As the physical body grows through childhood
and early adulthood, the movements of these
associated morphogenetic ﬁelds become condi-
tioned to act in a certain predictable way. ese
are yin movements of vital energy. But the cells
die and are replaced from food molecules, dis-
ease comes from various sources, environment
changes with seasons and places; in this way, the
movements of the morphogenetic ﬁelds has to
have creative dynamism, a balance of the yang
component of chi.
e most serious situation, of course, is created
when certain movements of vital energy are entire-
ly blocked; in quantum parlance, these movements
are never actualized or collapsed. We can see, that
such blocks of vital energy movement that prevent
the functioning of organs would have grave disease-
producing consequences.
now add another relatively new insight of modern
biology and medicine, the discovery of the immune
system that keeps the body healthy by killing oﬀ
intruders. naturally, modern medicine recognizes the
importance of keeping the immune system functioning
normally. Because of occasional mistakes in cell divi-
sion mechanism, the body is always creating abnormal
cells which the immune system kills oﬀ routinely as
intruders. But if the immune system does not function
properly, these abnormal cells can grow and become
malignant, causing cancer.
however, modern medicine has only a few legitimate
scientiﬁc mechanisms for immune system malfunc-
tioning. e principal one is genetic; if there is a defect
in the gene structure, the immune system will go awry
with high probability. is was suspected to be the
case with actress Angelina Jolie.
Another mechanism sometimes suggested is the action
of a bacteria or a virus that trips oﬀ the immune system.
however, there is no concrete case of this happen-
ing. recently, a red ﬂag was raised in proposing that
oral sex can lead to throat cancer through bacterial

infection. e actor Michal douglas made himself the
butt of many jokes when he claimed that his throat
cancer was caused by the many occasions of oral sex
that he served to his wife. 
Vital energy medicine can do better. Blocking of the
vital energies associated with the immune system is a
likely mechanism for immune system malfunctioning.
What can produce a vital energy block of this kind? 
What feelings are associated with immune system func-
tioning? e job of the immune system in the form of
the thymus gland whose geographical location is roughly
the same as the female breasts is to distinguish between
“me and not me.” When we fall in love with someone,
the movement of the morphogenetic ﬁeld associated
with our immune system is temporarily suspended, sus-
pending immune system functioning as well. is is
experienced as an intense yearning for physical union, a
part of all episodes of romantic love. When the union is
achieved, movement of the morphogenetic ﬁeld (vital
energy) resumes and the immune system functioning
returns to normal. 
In this way, certain situations in women’s life can lead
to prolonged suspension of immune system functioning,
such as a woman in grief from bereavement. is
then can produce breast cancer.
In Eastern psychology, the presence of certain feeling
centres along the spine was discovered long ago. ese
points are called chakra points. notice that the loca-
tion of the thymus gland is roughly in the same area
as the heart. e corresponding chakra point where
we feel romantic love is called the heart chakra.
ere are seven such major chakra points.
e identiﬁcation of unfulﬁlled romantic love as
the source of prolonged and continuous immune
system malfunctioning gives us an extra handle.
It brings to the fore the role of the mind in caus-
ing vital energy blocks. To starve the heart
chakra of romantic love until fulﬁlment is
achieved with only the desired partner, nobody
else, is often a mental decision that suppresses
the feeling of love toward others. us certain
types of cancer, breast cancer in particular, can
be recognized as a mind-body disease.
Again, from the perspective of mind-body dis-
ease, prevention is the best policy to deal with
the problem. In the olden days, people were
encouraged to grieve more than they naturally
would. But people lived in loving family envi-
ronments then. now with cancer-prone environ-
ment without loving support system and expo-
nential increase of mental stress, we should do the
opposite and discourage prolonged mourning. 
Is there any healing along these lines once one has
contracted breast  cancer? e best results are
achieved if we try changing the context of the
mental thought that contributes to the negative
emotion of grief. 
e physician deepak Chopra discovered the
phenomenon of quantum healing as an explana-
tion of many cases of spontaneous healing without
medical intervention. Quantum healing occurs as
a discontinuous transition of the mind to the
archetypal world to discover a new context for
mental thinking that is causing the vital energy
block. Such quantum leaps are part of the cre-
ative process. In the case of mind-caused breast
cancer, the quantum leap will let you love again.
e quantum leaps of quantum healing of cancer
bring about the normal functioning of the immune
system back with such fury that overnight all the
cancerous mass is destroyed. ere is ample evi-
dence of such spontaneous healing without any
medical intervention.
Can we do even better, life-long prevention, once
we have rediscovered love? In TCM, it is recog-
nized that the vital blueprints of the three organs
of the lung, liver, and stomach form a special trio
of circular hierarchy: the liver blueprint controls
the stomach; the stomach blueprint does not con-
trol the liver blueprint back directly; instead, the
stomach blueprint supports the lung blueprint, and
the lung blueprint controls the liver blueprint. us
the vital blueprints of the three organs form a func-
tionally causal circularity, a situation called tangled
hierarchy, which produces self-identity. What this
means is that when consciousness collapses the possi-
bility waves of these organs and their associated blue-
prints (morphogenetic ﬁelds), it identiﬁes with the trio as
a whole giving the system apparent autonomy (goswami,
1993). ere is no evidence for any autonomous function-
ing of the lung, but there is such evidence for the
immune system. Clearly, the ancient Chinese thought
has validity if we substitute immune system for the lung.
In other word, the immune system, the liver, and the
stomach form one autonomous system of identiﬁcation
for consciousness. And it is important to keep each mem-
ber of the trio and their vital connections healthy to
ensure proper immune system functioning.
So the quantum recipe for forever healthy living: dis-
cover love and expand your centre of functioning from
your neocortex to include the heart (immune system)
centre also.

of love is a vital representation of the archetype of
love similar to the fact that out thoughts of love are
mental representation of the archetype.
Archetypes reside as quantum possibilities in what we
call the supramental domain of reality. When they
collapse, we experience them as intuition. At the pre-
sent stage of our evolution, we do not have the capacity
to make direct physical representations of intuition. But
we do have the capacity of making representations of
the vital (in the form of the organs of the physical body)
and the mental (in the form of neocortical memory of
thoughts). So when we have an intuition, we make both
a mental representation (an intuitive thought) and vital
representation (for example a “gut” feeling at the navel
chakra) as intermediaries of physical representation (in
the form of brain memory of the thought and feeling
which we call emotion).
In this way, when we explore love creatively, we make a
brain representation of the emotion of love (thought
plus feeling) that then becomes a repertoire of loving
behaviour. 
now realize the age-old name for the supramental is
the soul (as in the great chain of being – body, mind,
soul, spirit). So when we have a physical representa-
tion of the archetype of love in the brain, we have
developed not only a body (physical-vital), a mind
(in the form of all the memories of past thoughts),
but also a soul in the form of these circuits of love.
And then we can live at the physical/vital, mental,
and the soul level. And this will take our collective
intelligence up a level.

and rapidly growing group of men and
women over 65, currently approximately
14% of the population of most developed
and many developing countries. ese are
people with an average life expectancy of at least
10 more years, in relatively good health, functional
and in society, and potentially open to new oppor-
tunity and experience. We call this burgeoning life
stage longevity and its member’s longevites (as
opposed to seniors and the aged). e new lan-
guage is meant to deemphasize the mainly neg-
ative collective projections that have previously
deﬁned this age group while highlighting the
vast positive potential available to this large,
inﬂuential, and rapidly growing group. 
In part I, we will begin by revisiting the life
stage of longevity as others have described it in
the past. en we will discuss this stage of life
by emphasizing the centrality of the encounter
with death. In part II, we will discuss the pair-
ing of death and ecstasy that is fundamental to
longevites’ experience. Collective and individual
rituals will be presented to enhance the under-
standing of the longevites’ psyche in greater
depth. e longevites’ dance with death is a time
to unlock the artist’s form in the face of suﬀering
and limitation. To facilitate this, a larger integra-
tive symbol is required, and for us, poet and play-
wright federico garcía lorca’s articulation of the
duende provides a key to loving life within the shad-
ow of death (garcía lorca, 1998: 48-62).

dividing the human life cycle into stages of develop-
ment has a long and venerable history from both the
artistic and psychological perspectives. 
Shakespeare’s Seven Ages of Man is the English lan-
guage’s most eloquent and pithy description of stages
in human life: 
All the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women
merely players; /ey have their exits and their entrances,
/And one man in his time plays many parts, / His acts
being seven ages.
he goes on to describe longevity as decline and loss:
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, / With spectacles
on nose and pouch on side; / His youthful hose, well
saved, a world too wide / For his shrunk shank; and his
big manly voice, / Turning again toward childish treble,
pipes / And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, /
at ends this strange eventful history, / Is second
childishness and mere oblivion, /Sans teeth, sans eyes,
sans taste, sans everything.

Before the Bard, Sophocles used the riddle of the
Sphinx, as posed to oedipus, to embody the mys-
tery of human development:
What creature walks on four legs in the morning? / On
two at noon, / And on three in the evening?
e famous answer to the question is “man.” A most
poignant eﬃgy that deﬁnes old age (a three-legged crea-
ture with a cane or crutch), as the heroic oedipus would
be at once blind and old, full of wisdom and despair.
In our own time, psychologist Erik Erikson posited seven
“psychosocial” life stages, each with a development task
deﬁned in polarity. e ﬁnal stage of life, which he called
“maturity,” spans age 65 to death and deﬁnes a stark con-
trast between integrity and despair. “older adults need to
look back on life and feel a sense of fulﬁlment,” he wrote.
“Success at this stage leads to feelings of wisdom, while
failure results in regret, bitterness, and despair.” 
ese samplings of art and myths to describe aging are
magnifying mirrors of how societies deﬁne what behav-
iours are deemed life-stage appropriate – e.g., when to
begin having sex, when to raise a family, when to
retire from work, and how many resources should be
spent on children or the elderly. ese decisions cre-
ate a structure of behaviours within age groups, and
through law and custom they regulate conduct and
attitudes in family and society.
e amazing demographic change in the duration
of life span has already aﬀected prejudice and other
cultural assumptions about aging. longevites need
no longer depend on others to describe their own
experience. e challenge for the emergent older
population is to fashion a new self-deﬁnition of
longevity, one based not primarily on the fan-
tasies and projections (and often self-serving
hopes) of younger people but on their own
here-and-now experience.
One of us (A.C.) is a longevite in good health who is
currently living an active professional life. Recently
he helped found a study group for international
leaders, the members of which were 15 to 40 years
younger than he. To describe the value of his age,
as it was diﬀerent from theirs, members of the
group routinely used aﬃrmative characterizations
such as “sage,” “revered teacher,” “wise elder.”
ese labels, positive in themselves, were also
remarkably limiting, eﬀectively shutting oﬀ other
attitudes and ways of being. Expressions of passion,
competition, aggression, or worldly ambitions were
subtly and not so subtly branded as somehow unsuit-
able for a man of his age. His own eﬀorts to diverge
from what was considered age-group-appropriate
behaviour were met with confusion, strong opposi-
tion, and even anger by younger group members. Over
and over again, he was told behaviourally and verbally
that he was denying his age and thereby infringing on
their territory. He was left with either accepting the
group’s controlling deﬁnitions or becoming an out-
sider and potential scapegoat.
Many longevites will recognize the potent eﬀect
of such strictures and possible misperceptions.
dylan omas’s powerful poem about death
ends with the much-quoted passage: Do not go
gentle into that good night, / Old age should burn
and rage at close of day; / Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.
is passionate romantic portrait of what old
age should feel like was written at the death of
omas’s father when he, the son, was just 37!
does this address the mysteries of the
longevite by experience?

As Erikson suggests, each new life “stage” both
integrates and transcends previous development.
is is certainly true of longevity – “We will die
as we live” is a truism for most longevites. how-
ever, unlike other life stages, longevity is charac-
terized by an ultimate discontinuity, the fact of
terminal illness and death. no matter what hopes
and plans longevites may have for their ﬁnal years,
and they are understandably abundant, the process
of dying – and the denial or acceptance of death
itself – is always the primary consideration, even
when not present in ordinary consciousness. In fact,
it is this combination of otherworldly transcendence
and experiential immediacy in our dance with death
that provides this stage of life with its awesome intensi-
ty. Another way of saying this is that ecstasy and
longevity occupy the common ground of death.
Ecstasy as a purely psychic state is deﬁned by the trans-
formation of death and rebirth. In psychological terms,
achieving ecstatic states requires a death of the ego – in
other words, an extinction of ordinary consciousness. It
entails extinguishing that day-to-day ego reality that
allows us to function in the world. rebirth begins with
the sense of ﬁnality and opens into a newly born con-
sciousness with a more multidimensional, capacious,
and expanded awareness of life. ere is always an
encounter with death in the ecstatic, be it transcendent
love, religious and sexual awe, a visionary experience, a
psychedelic drug state, or a near-death experience. e
longevites’ dance with death replicates psychic move-
ments of death and rebirth present in all ecstasy. 
Many of the attitudes and behaviours of longevites
derive from their uniquely close connection with
their own ecstatic underpinnings. at is, longevity
is always lived at the boundary of death. We never

know when we are going to develop a fatal illness,
succumb to a heart attack, or have a stroke in our
sleep. Some who believe strongly in a life after death
may live out this phase in preparation for that other
world. But for all but the most devout believers, it is
the death itself that guides our behaviour and focuses
our consciousness. is explains why longevity is
most often unlike more-worldly life stages when
acquisition of status, eﬀects, children, relationships,
holds sway. longevity moves most of us to psychologi-
cal states in which becoming is secondary to being.
Completing ourselves in the very shadow of death,
transforming what we already know of ourselves into
an intensely present-cantered yet vastly altered reality,
is the paradoxical task that an ecstatic consciousness
and longevity both deﬁne and share.

ose of us who have reached longevity are veterans
of a multiplicity of psychic experiences, with more to
come. Some of these experiences have been traumat-
ic, others joyful, with a vast continuum in between,
but all have added to a growing appreciation of the
way the human condition is a collage of involve-
ments, sensitive to and dependent on our stage of
life. We know more about how to witness the
moving plots that are our life.   
e limitations of longevity are well chronicled:
the threat and actuality of waning energies,
decreasing muscle strength, chronic pain, depres-
sion, memory loss, debilitating illness, and loss of
loved ones, to name the highlights! But there is
also a corresponding list of strengths we bring to
this state: added value derived from what we
have already learned and experienced in our ear-
lier life, including the fruits of accomplishment
and the attendant emotional, mental, and spiri-
tual growth. e challenge of this stage of life,
as of every stage, is valuing the present while
continuing personal development; but here it is
less about goals, production, or accomplishment
and more about imminence, appreciation, and
the ecstatic and contemplative that best serve the
last years and moments of our life.
perhaps the most powerful consequence of all this
experience is an enhanced and more capacious
knowledge of patterns we hold in us: the weaving
of our psyche, the way we interact and participate
in shaping ourselves in the world, our continuous
drama. at is, the patterns of our own behaviours
– love, aggression, loyalty – are imbedded mysteries
until we live and relive their variations and gradually
come to understand them with a measure of surety
based on ongoing reﬂection and feedback. e same
is true of our potent interactions with groups and
community. for example, politics is no longer seen
only as the chronicle of corruption, and the prod-
uct of chance and mistakes, after years of living
through and reﬂecting upon its persistent cycles
and regularities.  
In our work as clinicians and consultants, we often
see parents struggling to understand the behaviour
of their children. It is almost impossible to explain
to them how little knowledge they, or any parent,
have of the unfolding of a child’s life without hav-
ing lived that role at least once. Self-help books,
expert advice, and memories of their own parents
and themselves at various stages of childhood are
useful but barely a beginning for coping compe-
tently with one of life’s most diﬃcult jobs. e
challenge for many longevite grandparents and
parental advisors is not seeing what is going on –
they most often do – but ﬁguring out how to trans-
mit that knowledge without undercutting and
antagonizing the primary caretaker. 
from the hard-won vantage point of longevity we
see the same natural conﬁgurations played out
again and again: in the expectable way our body
hurts and heals; the stereotypy of repetitive patterns
in relationships and sexuality; the regularity of
weather and business spirals; the predictable cycles of
war with the impermanence of peace; the power of
revenge and the fragility of forgiveness. longevites’
ability to conﬁdently see intertwining patterns that
years before registered only as hints and hunches paral-
lels the much-revered gifts of prophets. Intuiting the
future, grasping the whole of things before they are
played out, is one of the great gifts of this phase of life, a
talent that is rarely given its full due by ourselves or
those around us. It is a gift that punishes as well as
rewards, seeding our consciousness with portents and
worry. But our ability to ﬁnally grasp a portion of our
patterns, to begin to know and see deeply into our own
and others’ trajectory, is precious. It allows us to plumb
the depths of each and every moment from a new per-
spective. And it teaches us how to bear pain, illness, and
loss, and also develop strategies and capacities to antici-
pate and prepare for what is to come. To know and
reﬂect on the deep weaving of our personal life in its
largest collective and spiritual context is the great wisdom
we can bring to our culture and ourselves as we get ready
for our ﬁnal encounters.

e experience of time is altered during the longevity
years. pressured by the fear of death, it can vibrate like
a taut wire, but more often it slackens to a seemingly
inattentive drift that in eﬀect is fuelled by some inner
demand. A sense of time derived from the deepening

mirrors of consciousness and its complexities length-
ens the way thought and behaviour are appreciated.
Alterations in time’s arrow deﬁne a new continuum of
appreciation and involvement of what deﬁnes conse-
quential units for creating meaning.
of course, much of this will depend on ongoing
changes in a given individual’s mental status. orienta-
tion to time is one of the ﬁrst tests of limited cognitive
capacity, but a decreasing concern with accuracy and
detail may be misinterpreted as a deﬁcit rather than a
reconceptualization of a new internal reality. In general,
longevites may be less concerned with schedules and
punctuality and more interested in qualities that tran-
scend time or place. Short social interactions may have
little meaning at all, while adequate time for a lingering
conversation that includes the rewards of silence and deep
listening may acquire greater and greater emotional sig-
niﬁcance. Time develops a rubberlike quality, expanding
and contracting with inner meaning rather than hinging
on objective requirements of others, as imprecision takes
on positive subjective value. ere is a preponderance of
subjective “nows”: consciousness states that are often
found in meditation and spiritual discipline are com-
mon experience.
Many longevites exercise using solo and repetitive physical
activity such as hiking and swimming rather than group
sports. In earlier life stages, activity is structured around
competition, group sports, and personal bests, while
introverted and subjective pleasures are often given sec-
ond place. Longevites reverse that order. In later years,
there is more bending time and space to relish the
blending of sex, sensuality, and relationship; the
renewing enchantments of weather, topography, and
views; appreciating atmospheres, ambiance, and sen-
sations that are generally more meditative in nature.
For example, listening to music may focus less on
keeping track of progressions of lyrics and melody
and more on diﬀuse emotional states and poignant
evoked memories.
e power of previous cultural deﬁnitions of
aging again plays an important role in how
longevite time is interpreted. If we allow younger
and more objectifying observers and professionals
to override these new and transforming impres-
sions, these cognitive and emotional states may be
labelled as the beginning of mental deﬁcits rather
than the ecstatic, soulful, enhanced appreciation
of what is felt as truly valuable in our world.

longevites are often described as rude, irrever-
ent, and irascible. ey may ignore conventional
social restraints, thereby upsetting others, includ-
ing loved ones. eir dress may violate conven-
tional standards. eir speech and behaviour may
be viewed as erratic and embarrassing to others.
eir political and social opinions may alter in
directions that are novel and of concern.   Some
of these can be viewed through the lens of pathol-
ogy: emotional liability, waning judgment, or
full-blown dementia. But as we have discussed,
what to some may seem crude and unmannerly
behaviour can also be interpreted as a healthy
regard for truth over form. 
It is particularly diﬃcult to make this distinc-
tion when longevity is stereotyped as synony-
mous with entropy rather a time for positive
growth. Signiﬁcant change within an individual
is always threatening to friends and family and
disruptive to community. labelling them as
still youthful may ignore the brash comments
of an adolescent, even if they are spot-on. It is
all too easy to scapegoat longevites for new and
possibly disturbing attitudes. for example,
young doctors ﬁnding life-threatening illness in
their patients are notoriously circumspect about
being upfront with agonizing prognoses. ey
may cringe when older doctors are far plainer in
their comments about what the ailing person can
expect. Is this clarity the greater self-knowledge
gained from experience or an age-related disrup-
tion in empathy? Similarly, grandparents who talk
about problems in their children and grandchil-
dren’s behaviour with great insight and truthfulness
may be upsetting to an ongoing family system. It is
easier to label their comments as “senile” rather than
considering that the grandparents are simply being
observant and perhaps actively attempting to change a
system they care about.
A man of 83 began espousing negative views about speciﬁc
subgroups that included warnings of radical political
behaviours and terrorist attacks. ese views were in con-
trast to his earlier “liberal views” and out of keeping with
normative attitudes of his family and friends. He was ﬁrst
ignored, and then labelled paranoid behind his back.
Much to the consternation of the oﬀending group, he
actively and frequently interpreted their insinuations and
complaints as undercutting his competence. After a bit, he
limited the frequency of his social and family group
encounters, and then he was labelled as suﬀering from
depression and was asked to seek help. Instead, he began
developing a new set of social and community alliances,
including some new close friends. When a terrorist attack
of the dramatic kind he had predicted did occur, there was
limited acknowledgment and certainly no apology. 
If this man had developed Alzheimer’s disease, his chang-
ing philosophy might have been ascribed to the early
eﬀects of an atrophied brain. Such was not the case. He
lived and worked productively until 93 and died within
a few months from rapidly growing abdominal cancer.
At no time was there any sign of diminishment of men-
tal acuity or emotional instability; on the contrary, his

life seemed richer in relationships and creativity than
ever before. 
In his last will and testament, he amply rewarded those
friends and family who had remained supportive and
retained curiosity about his thoughts, even if they didn’t
agree with his changing attitudes and ideas!
Views of aging that assume negative diminishment
rather than positive development do not take into
account the learning that occurs within the constantly
challenging labyrinth of the dance of death. philosoph-
ical discontinuity from previous norms should be
expected and reckoned with, without assuming that it
is a product of mental deterioration.  
In fact, a whole new standard of ethics and spirituality
at this last stage of development seems quite reasonable,
even necessary. our observation is that most longevites
retain a sense of reverence for spiritual disciplines,
though not necessarily for related religious practices.
ere may be a greater appreciation of interconnected-
ness; the blending of nature, collective expressions, and
individual feelings; and less dependence on the so-
called holy books or ancient rituals. erefore, many
longevites may appear irreverent. Commonly they no
longer hold what they learned by rote in childhood
and assumed was appropriate as adults; the bare bones
of reality are far more engaging than how one is sup-
posed to be or behave. ey may break with the pre-
viously accepted wisdom of spiritual “gurus” they
now recognize as artiﬁcial conveyors of the path.
Similarly, what was earlier deemed socially appro-
priate may feel irrelevant and discarded. honesty
may trump secrets with attendant consequences
for the people around them. descendants are not
automatically honoured with gifts. genetic close-
ness includes more than brothers and daughters.
friendships may be true rivals for family loyalty.
At their best, longevites may attain an attitude
toward life more fuelled by curiosity and the
desire for truth. And when their knowledge is
ignored, lack of tact may be the only way they
can step into the social breach and be heard.
In short, at this stage of life, the circle of who
and what represents us is never closed, and even
our immediate loved ones and most deeply
held beliefs can provide only a cushion to lean
on but never a bed to lie on. e only true rest-
ing place is death.

Aging, illness, and loss carry the endings and
beginnings that are at the hub of the wheel energiz-
ing the last stages of longevity. e dance of death
is always the central reality, though not necessarily
the dominant consciousness at all times. longevites
can seem to be living out a daily saga of ordinary
activities often skewed negatively with inevitable
visits to doctors and hospitals. for many, far more
of life is taken up with the daily dramas of ﬁnan-
cial worry, chronic illness and life-threatening dis-
ease, body pain, and grinding emotional losses.
for others, the time may be full of the joys and
pleasures that go with continuing good health and
work, leisure, supportive family relationships. But
an invitation to tune in to the underlying ecstatic
drama that is each person’s inevitable march
toward death tells a diﬀerent story. We are wit-
nesses to the ﬁnal deadly serious variant of the
archetype of initiation that is the hallmark of
every human transformation: the closing drama
of each of our lives, the curtain lowering on the
ﬁnal spectacle, the dance of death that marks the
completion of life.
Everyone over 65 knows, and increasingly waits for,
the moment that will forever change the trajectory
of this ﬁnal stage. Perhaps they will go to sleep and
not wake up in the morning. Or they will wake up
unable to speak or move their right side. Or they
will watch occasional diﬃculty in breathing, mild
chest pain, or the discovery of a lump transmogrify
into deadly serious illness. In today’s world, the march
from diagnosis to the end stages of life is rarely
straightforward. Emergency medical services have seen
to that by frequently transforming acute potentially
fatal episodes into treatable, chronic states, though with
increasingly high morbidity for each individual. Our
modern dance of death is a labyrinth of medical and sur-
gical treatment options, a matrix of interlocking channels
of alternative treatments, most of which are more depen-
dent on inadequate data and emotional needs than on
evidential clarity and clinical knowledge. is stance is full
of hope, followed by disappointments; narrowing options,
all moving inexorably toward the inevitable ending, fol-
lows new discoveries and opportunities.
We have both watched patients under our care struggle with
long-term chronic disabling and probably fatal illness:
metastatic cancer and AIDS come to mind. To the outsider,
their lives seemed to be a horror story of radiation, chemother-
apy, multiple old and new drugs, palliative surgery, all with
its attendant risks, not to mention the corresponding emo-
tional agonies of loved ones and trusted healers and care-
takers. But the inner spectacle of archetypal death is always
present in the unconscious life, in dreams, visions, and per-
ceptions, all of which alter ongoing consciousness. Someone
in the last stages of metastatic illness may wake up after a
particularly devastating lab result or painful treatment
with a new and intense appreciation of a beautiful sun-
rise, the song of a bird, a phrase of music, the line of a
poem. A relationship previously taken for granted may

be infused with overwhelming love. Many experience
these moments with a sense of the transcendent, an
encounter with the divine. e moments may be as
ecstatic as anything these people have experienced before
and may lead to such deep life-changing feelings of joy
that when people are in their most desolate state, the
“ordinary” world of dying is simultaneously their ﬁnest
moment. 
here is one person’s reaction to what it is like to live
in this altered state of consciousness.
ink of a ﬁre burning in a place far away from human
sites of habitation. We see its light like that of a burning
star. We are always in its presence and fashion a great deal
of our life in relation to it. But as we grow older, that ﬁre
becomes more evident and more important. It begins to
transcend all the things we do and transmutes their impor-
tance, the glitter of our pride. We suddenly realize that we
are on a path, a conveyor belt with no escape. We will
become that ﬁre. We will be consumed by it. We will no
longer exist. And as everything falls away and only the
ﬁre is in front of us, we understand that there has never
been another meaning. Never anything else between it
and us. And how we confront, tame, and shape the
impending end, meandering, sauntering, and denying
its ﬁerce reality, determines how we turn to ash. at is
all there is and has ever been. And if we can bear that
knowledge, we are living in the ﬁre, in the ecstatic.

In many world cultures, certainly in Western tra-
ditions, there has long been a taboo around
observing the death process unless one is a med-
ical professional. But recently movies and televi-
sion dramas have subverted some of this dis-
tance. Also, extended treatment and hospice-
like facilities, as well as assisted suicide, have
increasingly allowed family members and
friends to watch the end of life.
e death process itself incarnates creative force.
death does not come easy. our one and only
encounter with it invokes the deepest forces of
life and creation. during the time leading to
death, life clings tenaciously to the body. Even
in the last moments, the process is remarkably
full of energy. Creation requires an encounter
with something or someone (which can be an
inner being) in order to manifest. for some it is
a lover, for others coﬀee or alcohol, for still oth-
ers the paintbrush, the canvas, the musical score,
the garden, the song. It matters not, as long as
the relationship with the creative force can be
maintained. e muse is the time-honoured crea-
ture most commonly used to explain this phe-
nomenon. for example, we know her as dante’s
Beatrice, his guide in e Divine Comedy.
We have earlier invoked federico garcía lorca’s
writings on the duende because the duende is the
symbol that best condenses the ecstatic energies
encountered during the longevite engagement with
death. So what is the duende? lorca describes it as
a power that the gypsies in Andalucía, Spain,
referred to when a dance, a song, a poem, and the
like awakens a quality of reality so exaggerated
that in its heightening it becomes unreal. for
lorca it is the spirit of the earth, dark and shud-
dering. Time becomes distorted as in a night-
mare because it requires the performer to delve
into the wound, for the duende wounds, and to
engage with death, for the duende never comes
until the spirit of death is present. e duende
requires the hard work not just of mastering the
artistic form but also of having the courage to
delve into its deepest injuries and face it in
hand-to-hand combat despite its violent power.
When the conditions are met and the duende
arrives, true inspiration has happened and some-
thing new and miraculous is discovered. e term
is unique and untranslatable. e closest is
goethe’s “diabolical.” 
life is a stage indeed, and it behoves the longevite
to have the courage, the attitude, and the willing-
ness to struggle in the last staging of the play with
the power awakened by the duende. once the
duende is active, it transforms the infused actor.
e aged and broken is nevertheless held by the
winds of fate. e longevite is the quintessential ini-
tiate into the greatest rituals and mystery of all while
he also lives through diﬃcult yet mundane tasks of
survival and confusing years of pain. e rituals and
the duende released through them are too often
obscured by the arduous daily struggles of existence,
but they come directly from the deepest psyche, guid-
ing and giving meaning to the journey.

longevites live out their last years in the midst of a mul-
tiplicity of dying and death rituals. Some are structured
to bring peace and harmony, and foster rules that con-
tain pain, anger, and inevitable disappointments. others
emphasize the need for continued struggle against over-
whelming forces. humans are both carnivores and her-
bivores, and death and dying rituals capture this dual
capacity to both ﬁght and fear. history is our witness.
from the beginning of recorded time, human sacri-
ﬁce has been the collective scapegoat dance with
death. It is the oldest and most universal act of
piety. ese blood rituals, which continue today,
have been the foundation of our social and military

organizations as well as at the core of our intellec-
tual, artistic, and functional developments. e vic-
tims tend to be the poor and powerless, usually the
young, though not always so. If they have some
choice, they are seduced by their beliefs and ideolo-
gies to oﬀer their lives to the gods they worship. e
use of soldiers for war by longevite politicians and
generals is the modern-day equivalent, and our news is
riddled with the suicide missions carried out by Islamic
youths trained and brainwashed into religious sub-
servience, often by longevite leaders. however, also, far
aﬁeld in the peruvian Andes, at 18,000 feet, is the annu-
al festival of Qoyllorrit’y. (Montero and Colman, 1997:
227-38). is festival is not only an extraordinary exam-
ple of unacknowledged human sacriﬁce but pertinent
to us because we were once present to witness it.
In the barren landscape of the Peruvian Andes, religious
leaders participate in the selection of the brightest, healthi-
est, and most agile young men from the many villages that
dot its peaks and valleys. ese are the Ukukus, the semi-
divine bear-costumed people who will be initiated or die
in their overnight antics on the highest freezing glacier.
Villagers crisscross their mountain home to converge on
the traditional appointed mountainside at 16,000 feet.
ey bring their own small music ensembles and bow to
the Stations of the Cross as they ascend. Approximately
70,000 people arrive every year and spend three days and
nights drumming and praying with no available water,
food, or sanitary facilities, but their traditional organi-
zation contains any potential problems. On the last
evening, in initiatory trancelike mode, the Ukukus
climb an additional 1,000 feet to the glacier and
spend the night in nonstop “sacred” antics that
include cabrioles, dances, leaps, etc. ere is no light
and oxygen is scarce, and the dancers know that
some will end the night in a glacial tomb. At dawn,
those who survive descend carrying large blocks of
ice on their backs, reﬂecting the waking sun: these
are the stars they bear as proof of their rites. e
villagers have been waiting, ecstatic grimaces and
worry painted on their faces. ey all know that a
son, lover, or colleague may not return. e stars
are placed at the foot of the altar, built around a
ﬁgure of the Christ emblazoned on the rock, and a
priest holds a mass to commemorate the miracle;
the local gods are sated with prayer and alcohol.
e duende power is in the Ukukus, called by their
dance with death, the exhausted youths bent down by
the stars, the heavy large blocks of ice on their backs.
It is through this fortitude, courage, and commitment
that they ensure the potential prosperity of the villagers
and their night of transformation into the divine. 
perhaps the preeminent institutionalized dance
with death is the bullﬁght, the deadly yet highly
ritualized encounter between the human and the
ﬁghting bull who represent the monstrous instinc-
tual and destructive force that is death. Many peo-
ple ﬁnd a bullﬁght to be a horrendous and cruel
abuse of an animal, and on one level it is just as
longevite struggles with virus, cancer, and plaque
are felt as abusive to humans. We need to point
out that these are ﬁghting bulls bred for the
ring, where they get a death true to their nature,
while other bulls encounter truly disgraceful
and inhumane treatment in the slaughterhouse.
Is it possible to make a parallel with the
longevite who is dragged into death after pass-
ing years in front of the TV and the one ready
to initiate a dance with death? 
In the bullﬁght, death is dealt with head-on, with
the certain death of the bull and the enormous
danger to the matador. e ritual is highly stylized
and needs to be done properly for it to work and
the man to survive. e matador dominates the
bull by knowledge, experience, and grace. He
knows that the animal is seeking to kill him, that
he must be very courageous (cowardly behaviour is
jeered at mercilessly by the spectators and will termi-
nate a career in time), and that he must be able to
perform his art with grace and honour. In Spain,
honour is very real and required of all professions
(say, even between thieves and prostitutes, according
to their standards), and most certainly of the tore-
adors. Honour means courage, self-respect, pride (it’s
important never to show cowardice), and uprightness. 
e bullﬁght is a great spectacle that begins with the
parade of the toreadors saluting the appointed president
and the people in the stands, accompanied by music and
blaring trumpets. But, as with every sacrament, its
meaning as a death ritual transcends the show. e bull
is the death coming head-on. To the cognoscenti and
every conscious longevite, the meaning in every detail of
the ﬁght is a plot of the death experience. 
e bullﬁght takes place in a ring surrounded by spectators,
usually starting at 5 p.m. erefore, from its start it is an
event contained by place and time. e bullﬁghters do not
choose their bulls; this is decided by drawing lots. If they are
lucky, they get a good bull: not too large (even though they
are all huge, bred for size and strength), not too strong or
tall at the shoulders, with good vision, good reaction to
movement and colour, and a brave and direct charge. A
bad bull is too big, too old, and powerful, with wide
horns, but defective in courage, with poor vision and
viciously unpredictable when it charges. us the mixture
of luck and skill dominates the encounter, one of the
themes that haunt longevites, given that the course of ill-
ness, loss, and expected disasters is usually unpredictable. 
e ring is emptied, and in the hush, the bull is released.
e bullﬁght is based on the fact that the bull has never
met a dismounted man. At this time, it is full of its own

strength, snorting and running about, conﬁdent and
vigorous. e show belongs to this great doomed animal
and the matador. But the ritual depends on the complex
labyrinth that comprises the rules of the encounter. For
example, the bull ﬁrst sees one man dragging a cape, and
it charges. e man races behind the wooden enclosure,
his purpose accomplished, for the matador has now seen
the attributes of his bull, including charging preferences
and the use of the horns. He steps out with his large yellow
and purple-pink cape and invites the bull to charge at it
again and again, completing elegant and diﬃcult special-
ized passes called veronicas. He is masterfully showing his
talent with the cape, a most beautiful part of the dance, but
he is mostly measuring the danger oﬀered by that particular
creature and what will be needed to dominate it and pre-
pare it for the ﬁnal death. is ﬁrst phase includes many
other stratagems: the entry of the picadors on horseback,
their horses’ bodies heavily padded to protect them when the
bull charges and the men pierces its back with the javelin to
lower its head and slow it down. Often the horse is gored
and lifted by the horns. Strangely enough, this is the darkly
comic part of the show, which every elderly patient knows
too well. Here the horse hangs from the horns, looking
ridiculous, and people usually laugh. It is a reminder of
the joining of the comic and the tragic in our last years,
when failing mind or deteriorating body makes others
laugh (recall Shakespeare’s description of the last stage of
a man’s life).  
Next comes a man armed with banderillas (long
sticks) who runs at the bull and cruelly punishes it
with their points that rip into the skin. e surprised
animal is full of rage, but its strength and conﬁdence
wane as it fails in its attacks. Four pairs of bander-
illas are placed quickly and accurately. is second
act takes only ﬁve minutes, to spare the ﬁghting
spirit of the bull, but it is breathtaking, and the
audience sounds terriﬁed cheering for the bander-
illeros and their awesome courage. e ﬁght with
death, the bull and ours, is unfair, but it is a con-
test nevertheless. Here death is wounded as the
duende wounds. e wounding is meant to even
the playing ﬁeld – a new cancer-ﬁghting drug
balanced by a more virulent metastasis – and sets
the stage for the ecstatic drama of completion, the
exact outcome still uncertain.
e ﬁnal act is the execution: the bull and perhaps
the man too! e more defensive the bull has
become, the more dangerous it is. e matador
comes into the ring with a sword in his right hand
and a muleta, which is a red cloth held by a stick
that has a point at one end and a handle at the
other, in his left hand. He makes passes around the
bull that cause it to keep lowering its head until he
leaps to the side of the horns while plunging the sword
deep into the bull’s back through an opening the size of
a coin between the shoulder blades, a path that can go
into the heart or cut its surrounding arteries. If all goes
well, the bull falls to its knees before the man and
dies. is is a hair-raising event. e bull has to be so
close and turn almost in place as the man dominates
its every movement, so that the horns could brush
the matador’s body. Here again, luck can determine
the outcome, and the matador can die regardless of
his skill and mastery over the animal. For example,
an unexpected wind can lift the cape and expose
the man’s body, so that a goring is inevitable.
e last phase of the bullﬁght completes the jour-
ney we all face. Death is certain, but there are
good deaths and bad deaths, in which luck and
skill, courage and humour, and fate all play a part
in a drama in which we are all players. In the
sacred container of the bullring, this phase is the
most diﬃcult of all; and when done with grace,
skill, and maximum risk to himself – with duende,
the crowd would say – it takes the man out of him-
self and makes him feel immortal. It creates an
ecstasy that is as profound as any religious ecstasy.
e people in the ring identify with an increasingly
emotional intensity as the matador plays with death,
bringing it closer and closer to himself. All are at one
with death, and for a brief moment, time and space
are transcended. 
Many of us would consider these last two examples
as primitive and cruel analogy of our modern med-
icalized customs of dying, but only if they have
remained distanced from the ways many of us die
today, without honour, grace, or even comfort. As
individuals, we want to die with those qualities we
most respect. Mozart completed his great Requiem on
his deathbed with complete consciousness of its per-
sonal as well as collective signiﬁcance. Bach’s last
major composition, his greatest, was a compilation of
early and recent pieces blended and cantered within
the sublime B Minor Mass. Socrates’ courageous suicide
(as recorded by plato) as an act against tyranny could
be seen in the same light. ese are epiphanies, human
death rituals in which our highest human values are
embodied. A painless quiet passing with friends and
family gathered close is another kind of equally mean-
ingful ritual we may all seek. helping transform our
cultures to allow such an end, if fate allows us this, is
one of the purposes of this paper.

roughout this writing, we have pointed to the
importance of recognizing the ecstatic, symbolized in

in the longevite’s journey.   e drama of the bull-

real-life enactment, bring meaning and even uncanny
vitality to a diﬃcult and ﬁnal passage. e reality of
loss – body, mind, and soul – unimbued with this
kind of energy brings hopelessness and suﬀering and
feeds the depression hovering at the edge of this end
stage of life.
of the many losses that are possible and even inevitable,
the death of a spouse or partner and the subsequent
need to live alone is particularly poignant and diﬃcult.
e level of maturity of personality and the quality of the
relationship are major factors in adapting, but there is
also a predictable and independent syndrome and
sequence to this new state of being. 
When the life partner leaves or is taken away by demen-
tia or death, at ﬁrst there is an overwhelming confusion.
e assault of the death bull is disorienting because it is
always huge and terrifying and unfamiliar. no matter
our individual state of preparedness, the charge always
comes in a diﬀerent and unexpected way. e audience
at the bullﬁght looks to the matador’s feet for his
courageous readiness and noble stance. e feet betray
cowardice because they are not in control when faced
with this supremely fearful attack – they move, they
want to run away, and the crowd jeers. e person
grieving a recent loss wants and tries to run away
from the reality of the event. others watch how
he/she holds the stands, no matter how authentic
and generous they are with their loving accompani-
ment. It is not about malice; it is about the merging
with that person’s fear and grief that happens when
there are extreme emotions that easily become
unmanageable and all recognize that there is no
escape. ere is only the grace with which it is
handled and diverse rituals that are enacted to
protect from its violent onslaught.
Most longevites are overwhelmed by the absence
of the person they lived with, often the bulk of
their adult years. e centre that held two is
broken, and the vacuum that takes its place per-
sists for months, even years. is vacuum is
accompanied by extreme sorrow and longing
for the lost one. Some report the experience as
a “lost limb” of the wounded amputee, the
reaching for the hand, face, mouth, and
embrace of the other, seeking the phantom
shape for solace. It is unbearable pain when the
upsurge of emotions takes over the whole per-
son and leads him/her down the road of depres-
sion. But this darkest of ecstasies can also deliver
the beauty that is inherent in life: the magniﬁ-
cent colours of the ﬂower are magniﬁed; the
shades of dawn sparkle as never before; the music
once shared titillates with the splendour of memo-
ries enhanced and idealized; the writings, the read-
ings… however, the ecstasy of life wanes fast, and
the challenge of rebuilding a life out of the ordi-
nary everyday can seem barren and to some impos-
sible. oughts of suicide may arise. As one
woman said, “how can I knit a life with no
threads?”
e griever often responds with vexation and
irritation to mundane tasks and to the loving
attempts to bring solace by those near. An
uncontrollable rage at one or more family mem-
bers and friends may ensue. e projections
range from envy of their current well being to
accusations based on old injuries now experi-
enced as larger than ever before. ose who are
accosted by these emotions inevitably feel that
they are largely out of proportion and unjusti-
ﬁed. But to the mourner they are real, and they
now attack mercilessly like the wounded bull.
Also, a need for physical and psychological safe-
ty is much enhanced, and since these dependen-
cies are not easily fulﬁlled, the grieving person
becomes even more dangerous and defensive.
Again, the bull in the ring comes to mind. All
bulls ﬁnd one or two spots in the arena, the
querencia, where they can feel secure in the unfa-
miliar and/or threatening encounter with the tore-
ador. here the creature is most dangerous because
it will not charge but will gore anyone who comes
near. It takes enormous patience and skill to slowly
move the bull out of its querencia so that life and
death in the ring can go on. Similarly, the attacked
friend or family member has to remember that the
thrusting horns of the person they love have to be
endured until, in time, the person is capable of weav-
ing his/her fate anew more clearly.
longevites frequently report that children and friends
now treat them as if they were the children, telling
them how and what to do, whether or not this is
required. is may lead to denial of the actual needs of
the mourner by those who truly wish to be of help.
We have seen so many friends and patients who misinter-
pret the communication of people in the throes of what
seems to them to be an ultimate disintegration of personality.
It is hard to listen. It is hard to watch previously strong
individuals who were good parents, grandparents, or
friends now reduced to whining, angry people. Organizing
households and providing food and money may be exactly
what is needed or be an easy substitute for the hard listen-
ing required to fully appreciate the disabling pain of being
alone. It is hard to know the extent of the need and the
place where a balm of love and caring can be applied and
be of real use. One distraught recent widow was happy to
receive ﬂowers, condolence notes, and even words of
encouragement, gestures seen as loving examples of
friendship. But her main need was to get out of her
house, the place where she had spent years of marriage,

now a mausoleum of unendurable memories. She had
placed her house on the market. To relocate, she needed
the cash from the sale, but although she lowered the
price, no bidders arrived. Her despair with her sur-
roundings drove her to thoughts of suicide mixed with
fury, knowing that some of her friends who oﬀered meals
out and feelingful phone calls (and incidentally were
always feeling good about themselves) had great wealth
and could have, with no impact on them, bought the
house and given her time and the opportunity to relocate to
a place where memories and feelings were not so acute. is
type of denial is commonly based on social convention, and
true generosity would require some secrecy to spare the
widow a feeling of indebtedness. Of course, this woman
never felt able to voice her needs, which is common enough
in individuals robbed of their moorings and afraid of
revealing their desperate neediness.
We have selected the loss of a partner for the example
but could equally well have chosen so many other loss-
es: the consequences of debilitating arthritis, cancer,
blindness, or dementia all might have a similar impact.
loss is always a part of the drama of longevity, and the
courage to temporarily surmount overwhelming
onslaughts of damage and deﬁcit often becomes the
central plot – perhaps the only one. longevites live
with this vision even before it becomes a reality. It is
the panorama of their particular play and the most
common ﬁnal scene, along with their funerary cere-
monies, that they may imagine.

e Enlightenment bequeathed to us a dualistic model
of the universe, pitting science against superstition, logic
against irrationality, order against chaos, civilization
against nature, and the glorious sentience of humankind
against the dead, mindless motions of a mute cosmos. As
such, we have co-developed a social arrangement that
thrives on this logic of separation – a cultural monocul-
ture that treats the ‘natural world’, much to our peril, as
fodder for the purposes of economic growth and ‘devel-
opment’. However, new insights in scientiﬁc research
into quantum phenomena and a surging interest in
indigenous knowledge systems are changing that narra-
tive – instead suggesting not only that consciousness is
fundamental to the way the universe works (and not
merely an epiphenomenon of brain physics) but that the
cosmos is alive in ways our most advanced sciences can-
not yet articulate. It is now increasingly useful to think
of trees, people, non-human beings, and even ecosystems
as a collective intelligence, a kind of planetary ‘brain’ act-
ing in ways that may not seem intelligent when under-
stood from a fragmented perspective, but shows intelli-
gence when modeled from a holistic viewpoint. 
In this essay, I reﬂect on the implications of an intelligent
cosmos on the subject of human agency, and bring these
reﬂections to bear on contemporary theories of social
change – especially in these times of urgent multiconver-
gent crises. Drawing from an African proverb that states
‘the times are urgent, let us slow down’, I hope to deepen
the conversation about today’s civilizational impasses and
the possibilities for radical planetary futures by stressing
other-than-human intelligences, plural knowledge ﬁelds
and reality models, and shamanic access to ‘subtle realms’.

is article proposes that the primary function of intelli-
gence is to sustain a dynamic system’s balance between
environmental control and adaptability. A dynamic sys-
tem needs to remain in tune with its changing environ-
ments so that its actions continue to be successful. It does
this through impacting its environment and adapting
itself to changing conditions. Both strategies depend on
awareness of environmental realities and their relevance to
the success and survival of the intelligent system.
Human collective intelligence in technological, econom-
ic, and cultural realms has led to the rapid evolution of
human civilization’s capacity to impact its environment.
Humanity’s problem-solving capabilities have translated
problematic circumstances into new forms of impact, a
process known as progress. However, this process has
today projected extremes of actual and potential impact

into unprecedented scales and realms that challenge not
only our ability to respond but the very basis of our
responsive capacities – the nature of our intelligence itself.
Approaches to collective intelligence attend variously to
computerized systems (and their networks); to the quality
of information/knowledge systems and conversational
methodologies; to human diversity (including diverse cog-
nitive capacities); to spiritual and intuitive practices and
collective consciousness; to the dynamics of collaboration,
aggregation, and stigmergy; and to social dynamics, espe-
cially those related to power.
e most important realm in which collective intelligence
is least developed – and, in fact, is actively undermined by
ideological and self-interested applications of collective
intelligence – is the realm where whole-society decisions
are made, namely politics and governance. e integration
and application of multiple approaches to collective intelli-
gence to this realm – and the expansion of collective intelli-
gence to manifest as collective wisdom – are necessary to
avoid the collapse of civilization through rapidly emerging
crises generated by our lopsided collective intelligence-dri-
ven powers in technological, economic and cultural realms.

For the ﬁrst time in history, there is a large and rapidly
growing subgroup of men and women over 65, currently
approximately 14% of the population of most developed and
some developing countries who share a great deal in com-
mon. We call this life stage longevity and its members
longevites (as opposed to seniors and the aged) to emphasize
the positive and creative potential inherent in this expanding
cohort within the world population. Most literature on the
population explosion of the aging has emphasized pragmatic
factors, e.g. economic cost, medical services, etc. rather than
considering the intergroup transfer of knowledge that is a conse-
quence of this newly deﬁned entity in our world. 
Longevites are a group bounded by age 65 to the death of
its members. It is in continuous, dynamic interrelation
and intercourse with the other subsystems in our human
culture and peppered with back and forth meaningful and
consequential projections. As the group struggles to deﬁne
itself, it learns and shares the many ways it varies from the
earlier stages of life it has already passaged. We give theory
and examples of transformations in consciousness, collec-
tive intelligence and wisdom within the longevity group.
Some of the categories we discuss have to do with atti-
tudes toward time (present and future), spirit, truth
telling, and a greater appreciation for psycho-ecstatic states
associated with death.
Finally, we propose that in the potential psyche of the
longevites is a substrate of rituals and symbols about the
dance with death that once brought into awareness will
enrich the entire  human collective’s desire to embrace the
sacred drama of life.

I adopted the term connective as a sub category of collec-
tive intelligence to indicate cognitive relationships that
include speciﬁc conﬁgurations and proper attribution to
individual participants. e assumption is that all forms of
group intelligence are subsumed by the term collective.
But it isn’t so. At best collective may signify the overall
cognitive achievement of a community over a given period
of time. Connective, however, reﬂects the form, duration
and outcome of speciﬁc cognitive activities performed by
groups of individually identiﬁable persons working togeth-
er. It applies in particular to social relations and interac-
tions that are carried by networks. e Internet is an emo-
tional as well as cognitive environment. It oﬀers and stim-
ulates diﬀerent levels of involvement from simple collabo-
rative practices to emotional engagement in social move-
ments. Considering that Civil Society needs and uses
intelligent strategies for real time activism, it may be
opportune to reﬁne our approach to intelligence.

is essay plays with two deﬁnitions of collective intelli-
gence, drawing on two meanings of the word “intelli-
gent” that bring to bear relevant arguments from the
philosophy of mind, particularly in reference to artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) and its distinction between “strong AI”
and “weak AI.” One deﬁnition associates intelligence
with the ability to perform tasks involving logic, reason-
ing, pattern recognition, etc., an ability that can be
quantiﬁed and measured. Most theory and research on
collective intelligence works with this deﬁnition. Anoth-
er sense of the word associates intelligence with some
kind of consciousness or awareness, and would distin-
guish (per Searle) between real intelligence and the mere
mechanical solving of problems. It is qualitative and its
presence can only be inferred, not measured. I will
explore the question of whether this sort of intelligence,
as well as the problem-solving variety, is present in col-
lectives. Do groups have a sentience that transcends the
sentience of their parts? Do they have, whether in actu-
ality or in potential, a capacity for morality or wisdom
that cannot be reduced to mere problem-solving eﬃ-
ciency? Is it meaningful to speak of the desire, the inten-
tion, the purposiveness of a group as distinct from that
of its members? And if so, how can these qualities be
developed in socially desirable ways? I will adopt a trans-
disciplinary approach to exploring these questions,
drawing upon notions of intersubjectivity, the social
construction of self, crowd psychology, emergent phe-
nomena, and concepts of group mind from mysticism,
indigenous worldviews, and depth psychology.

Technology is what boosts the capacity of individuals and
communities to become authors of their own stories, and
what enables collective intelligence to become aware of
itself and to fulﬁl its long awaited promise. It is also what
can lock up potential inside black boxes for just a few to
beneﬁt from.
We are facing a paradox. It seems that at the same time as
collective intelligence is making itself increasingly palpable
and promising as a whole, the possibility of it being
actionable locally and eﬀectively, enabling us to get our-
selves out of a planetary predicament, is becoming remote.
In this article, I look at how collective intelligence is hin-
dered or being captured as it comes into being, with the
threat of leaving us deprived from a signiﬁcant source of
latent agency, and I suggest what it would take to
reclaim it back.
I build upon the Ecology for Transformative Action,
which I set the stage for in the last issue of this journal, to
examine the condition under which technology and sys-
tems dynamics can be turned towards the greater good and
how collective intelligence can be mobilized as a force for
systemic change. In particular, I explore how a pattern lan-
guage for systemic change regenerative of commons could
be the means of expression of operationalized collective
intelligence.

When we step back from our more localized cultural nar-
ratives, perspectives, worldviews and disciplinary orienta-
tions and dilate our hearts and minds into the more
expansive and inclusive global space whence our diverse
worldviews co-originate and co-arise, striking new pat-
terns and insights come into relief that were not accessible
before.  When we dilate our rational and spiritual intelli-
gence into the ((Source Field)) and gain access to the long
emerging ((Logos Code)) that ﬂows through all our
diverse worldviews, religions, ideologies and cultures we
move from monologue to ((deep dialogue)) and enter this
Primal Common Ground of deep consensus, conver-
gence, connectivity and synergy across and between
worlds.  is Deep Dialogue literacy, technology and
intelligence is what empowers us to rise together in ((Col-
lective Intelligence)) across the deeply entrenched borders
that divide our cultures and worlds.  Gaining access to this
((Primal Logos Code)) through the rational arts of Deep

Dialogue is thus key to cultivating genuine ((Collective
Intelligence)) in this dilated global light. e ontological
medicine of Deep Dialogue across and between worlds is
vital for cultivating authentic ((Collective Intelligence))
and tapping the resources of ((Global Wisdom)) for our
Global Age.  Source Intelligence, skills of Deep Dialogue
and the cultivation of Global Consciousness are keys to
the cultivation and embodiment of Collective Intelligence
as we face the evolutionary challenges of deep communi-
cation and ﬁnding consensus and synergy across borders.
us, we cannot enter ((Collective Intelligence)) within
the divisive, fragmented and polarized spaces of mono-
logue cultures, but must mature as mindful and awak-
ened Humans in the arts of Deep Dialogue.  We are not
egosapiens, but LogoSapiens.  And it is in mature dia-
logue cultures that we humans ﬂourish.

is is a prime example of new ways to deal with old
problems of disease when we invoke the primacy-of-con-

connection of the phenomenon of love, love as the basis of
collective intelligence, the so-called heart chakra, and the
immune system functioning. e exploration of this con-

explore the question: how best to center oneself in love
and the heart and prevent cancer? I will show that the
answer lies in awakening the self of the heart and living it.

promise in helping organizations and groups access high-
er-order potentials and synergistic solutions (Hamilton,
2004). However, for many of today’s global scale prob-
lems, there is often general agreement on needed action,
yet great diﬃculty marshalling individual and collective
motivation for change. Open mind, open heart, and
open will (Scharmer, 2009) have been identiﬁed as facilita-
tors of collective synergy, yet these qualities have yet to be
institutionalized and promoted within culture.
After experiencing the impact of collective awakening
experiences in a community setting, Craig Hamilton began
exploring the potential for collective transformative
engagement within a virtual context. Over the past ﬁve
years, his teachings have reached tens of thousands and
have supported the development of a global learning com-
munity based in principles of evolutionary culture and
practices for a life of awakening to higher purpose and
emergent potential – for the sake of the whole. In this
interview, Craig Hamilton shares his evolving understand-
ing of collective intelligence practices and their potential
for enabling needed transformation of self and culture.
Author George Pór also participates in the interview, oﬀer-
ing an opportunity for exploration of resonances and con-
trasts with his concept of collective sentience.

We sketch a foundation for a new theory of distributed
intelligence, based on the concept of challenge propaga-
tion, which extends the mechanism of spreading activation
in neural networks to the collective intelligence emerging
from a network of interacting agents. Challenge propaga-
tion is a form of self-organizing, distributed processing that
allows agents to collectively tackle challenges too complex
for a single agent, and that can be mathematically and
computationally modelled. e basic idea is to combine
the notion of “challenge”, which is deﬁned as a phenome-
non that elicits action from an agent, with the notion of
“propagation”, which denotes the process by which such
phenomenon is iteratively transmitted from agent to agent.
A challenge is a generalization of the notions of problem,
opportunity and activation. It can be characterized by
valence (positive or negative), prospect, mystery and diﬃ-
culty. An agent’s action on a challenge will typically “relax”
the challenge, but not resolve it altogether, so that some
degree of challenge remains for further agents to act upon.
Propagation occurs either via a shared medium in which
challenging traces are left for others (stigmergy), or by via a
network of links learned through reinforcement of success-
ful transmission.

Almost every generation imagines itself on a precipice,
where problems seem too complex to solve and the future
is bleak. Yet, society survives each time, often reinventing
itself. With global climate change, dying oceans, demo-
cide, killer epidemics, and other modern crises, humanity
may truly be at the precipice where our actions in the
next decade will determine the future of humankind.
In this article, we discuss how proactive collective intelli-
gence is the game-changing resource that oﬀers hope,
extending its role beyond the “wizard behind the curtain”
in the past. Based on research over the last two decades,
the advantages and limitations of collective intelligence
can be now understood. When added to the traditional
spectrum of problem-solving methodologies and leader-
ship, collective intelligence using diverse groups can
extend the complexity of problems that can be solved –
deﬁning when and how diverse collectives can outperform
experts, while being more robust.
Because expression and compatibility of diversity are required
for collective intelligence, we show how managing social iden-
tity (us versus other) is the key to enabling diversity, par-
ticularly when diverse views are in conﬂict or contain bias-
es. We conclude that future methodologies may need to
embrace biases that have embedded truths captured within
situated understandings of the complex problem domain.
Finally, a practical example of a grand challenge project
illustrates the implementation of above concepts to solve a
problem of international importance.  is project used
advanced risk assessment methods, similar to Open Spaces
and World Café, that eﬃciently captured diverse knowl-
edge, even when participants were biased and in conﬂict.

In this paper the Author maintains that clear evidence are
coming to light about conscious experience beyond the
range of sense and beyond the body itself, proving that
individual consciousness does not end with the physical
death. To the mainstream view on consciousness being a
product of the brain, Laszlo propounds a paradigm in
which consciousness is neither produced nor linked to a
living brain, but is rather transmitted by the brain. is
perspective rises the question: transmitted from where and
how? To which the holoﬁeld theory answers postulating
that consciousness might well be the projection of a cos-
mic coded hologram ﬁeld – the Akashic ﬁeld – accessible
to the brain and the nervous system. A concept also widely
discussed as the “holographic universe” in contemporary

physics. We cannot speak of consciousness in the plural as
the overall number of minds in the universe is one, our
body may be separate, but our minds is not. If we would
realize and take to heart this realisation, we could over-
come the critical challenges of our time.

e paper presents the case for an augmented and reﬂex-
ive collective intelligence using the ubiquitous recording
and computing power of the algorithmic medium.
e ﬁrst part of the paper tells the research journey of the
author since the publication of his book Collective Intelli-
gence, twenty years ago. is scientiﬁc journey has led to
the invention of IEML, an artiﬁcial language that self-
translates in natural languages and endowed with com-
putable semantics. When data are categorized in IEML,
their semantic relationships are automatically computed.
Moreover, as IEML provides an algebraic account of lin-
guistic semantics, the modelling of human intelligence,
which is precisely based on language, becomes reachable.
e second part of the paper analyses the historical and
philosophical implications of this scientiﬁc breakthrough.
I propose ﬁrst a description of the reﬂexive knowledge of
Antiquity and the Middle Ages that uses mainly the mir-
ror of an agent intellect. I evoke then a second age of
reﬂexivity, which preserves the universal perspective of
the earlier period, but removes the reference to heaven
and concentrates on human knowledge. is modern
period, characterized by the strengthening of natural sci-
ences and the fragmentation of humanities, reﬂects its
cognitive activity in what Kant baptized a transcendental
subject. Finally, I defend the hypothesis that when half
the humanity will be connected to the Internet, a third
renewal of reﬂexive knowledge will occur. is version 3.0
will keep the ideals of universality and scientiﬁc per-
fectibility but will rely on an extensive use of technology
to increase and systematically reﬂect our collective minds,
and therefore our personal and social learning abilities.
What is at stake is not an artiﬁcial intelligence mimick-
ing some individual logical reasoning but the transition
from our current typographic intelligence to a collabora-
tive algorithmic intelligence.

Can individuals and collectives beneﬁt one another
when they come together through a shared awareness of
the ground of being, which we call the causal ground, or

awareness itself? Is it possible for individual conscious-
ness to bend and blend with the consciousness of the
collective such that the individual shines even more in
the ﬁeld of the collective holding, while the collective
captures the wisdom of the Source itself without bury-
ing individual light? From our experiments with collec-
tive intelligence and collective consciousness, we have
developed an eﬀective approach to support the evolu-
tion of this interpenetration of individual and collective
consciousness, through a variety of states and stages,
while addressing individual and collective shadow.
In this article, we express our experience with this mode
of collective/individual intelligence. We will include
practical steps that any collective can take to ground
themselves in a causal ﬁeld, the source itself, and to
allow creativity to ﬂow through the collective without
detracting from any individual. We will oﬀer statistics
on the research that we have done to show the results of
the evolution of our collective intelligence eﬀorts. We
will describe the qualities of conscious collectives that
arise at various world-views, and their iterating patterns
through the trajectory of collective development, repeat-
ing through concrete communities, subtle communities
and causal communities, showing how collective intelli-
gence itself is not “one thing” but that it evolves.
e very term “collective intelligence” captures the
dream we all have in holding a vision for a better func-
tioning society, globally for all of life. And in the true
spirit of the topic, this paper is written from and through
the collective intelligence of three people who have been
working together in this ﬁeld for the past ten years.

is essay is a wide-ranging exploration into the condi-
tions for realizing the next-level potential of human and
social evolution. A starting point for looking at “evolu-
tion” is the unending journey resulting from the
“dynamic interplay of the passive and the creative polar-
izations of the Absolute that unfolds itself into the ener-
getic process of diﬀerentiation bringing forth the whole
of creation.”  e evolutionary process actually contin-
ues through cycles of diﬀerentiation, then integration, at
a higher level. 
We are on the threshold of a new cycle of the spiral, the
spiral of consciousness. e previous cycles, archaic,
magic, mythic, modern and post-modern consciousness
served us well by leading us so far. However, becoming
stuck with them is becoming stuck with an existential
threat of intertwining global crises that cannot be solved
at the currently dominant modern and post-modern lev-
els. e next cycle is the one of an integral, holistic con-
sciousness that enables the integration of the inner and

outer technologies and sciences, deep intuition and sys-
tems thinking, spirituality and precision of inquiry. 
In this essay I explore some of themes that are core to
our move into the next cycle, such as, collective intelli-
gence, collective sentience, evolutionary guidance sys-
tems, integral and shared mindfulness.

Triangle, Box and Circle are three fundamental ways
humans can organize themselves for collective intelli-
gence. e Triangle is where a leader is ultimately in
charge; the Box is where a social contract or constitution
is ultimately in charge; and the Circle is where the ulti-
mate authority is a living conversation of “We the Peo-
ple.” Today as we shift from independence to interde-
pendence, our current Box form of democracy increas-
ingly yields “collective stupidity” instead of “collective
intelligence.” We must shift to the Circle. 
Key to making this shift are three social innovations: 1)
choice-creating is the necessary form of whole-system con-
versation. Distinct from “dialogue,” “decision-making,” or
“brainstorming” it is where people creatively and collabora-
tively face diﬃcult issues and achieve win/win unity. 2)
Dynamic Facilitation can reliably evoke choice-creating in
small groups. 3) e Wisdom Council Process uses
Dynamic Facilitation and random people to spark the spir-
it of choice-creating in large systems. Because the Wisdom
Council process is safe yet proven, it opens new doors of
possibility for leveraging collective intelligence at all levels
–the organization, community, state, nation and world.

e emerging discipline of Collective Intelligence (CI) has
been badly mis-directed by a combination of the faddish
focus on “wisdom of the crowds” without conversation or
dynamic facilitation, and an academic ivory tower fasci-
nation with artiﬁcial intelligence, something I studied
deeply in the 1980’s for the Central Intelligence Agency.
CI must be appreciated in a cosmic and spiritual context
as well as an ecological and social context that respects the
inherent intelligence and communications skills of plants
and animals along with the emerging understanding of
how all matter is energy and energy is form of communi-
cation, CI in the 21st Century must focus on the true
meaning of intelligence as evidence-based decision-sup-
port, rooted in holistic analytics, true cost economics,
and open source everything. In this article I provide a
