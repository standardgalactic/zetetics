Abstract
In this thesis we accelerate and extend a path-planning based patient-speciﬁc mod-
eling method commonly used for anatomic model creation for cardiovascular ﬂuid
dynamics simulations. We further address a longstanding open question of how re-
alistic patient-speciﬁc model geometry variability inﬂuences simulation output un-
certainty. Model building is accelerated by using recently developed deep learning
methods and convolutional neural networks to automatically generate vessel surfaces
from image data. We enable the quantiﬁcation of simulation output uncertainty due
to geometry variation by modeling the probability distribution of vessel surfaces using
convolutional bayesian dropout networks.
In the ﬁrst part of this thesis we use fully-convolutional neural networks (FCNN)
to generate 2D cardiovascular segmentations. Given vessel pathlines, the neural net-
work generates 2D vessel enhancement images along the pathlines. Thereafter, vessel
segmentations are extracted using the marching-squares algorithm, which are then
used to construct 3D cardiovascular models. The neural network is trained using a
novel loss function, tailored for partially labeled segmentation data. An automated
quality control method is also developed, allowing promising segmentations to be
selected.
Thereafter we develop machine learning models to directly predict vessel lumen
surface points using a regression formulation. In contrast to the previous method,
which identiﬁes the vessel lumen through binary pixel classiﬁcation, formulating ves-
sel lumen detection as a regression task allows predictions to be made with human
expert level accuracy. The regression formulation enables machine learning models to
be trained end-to-end for vessel lumen detection without post-processing steps that

reduce accuracy.
In the third part of this thesis we propose a novel approach to sample from a
distribution of patient-speciﬁc models for a given image volume. The method uses
the previously developed vessel lumen regression networks, combined with dropout
layers, to enable Bayesian sampling of vessel geometries.
The networks are then
applied in the path-planning patient-speciﬁc modeling pipeline to generate families of
cardiovascular models. A key innovation is the ability to learn geometric uncertainty
directly from training data based on medical images. We then quantify geometric
uncertainty for clinically relevant anatomies, and provide detailed analysis of its eﬀects
on cardiovascular patient-speciﬁc ﬂuid dynamics simulation results.
The above methods allow for eﬃcient automation of patient-speciﬁc model con-
struction from medical images which greatly accelerate the model construction process
and reduce laborious user input. These methods are combined with uncertainty quan-
tiﬁcation methods that enable assessment of how image-based uncertainty propagates
to simulation outputs.

poor resolution, poor vessel visibility and signiﬁcant surrounding tissue
leads to a degredation of the network segmentation accuracy. FCNNs
are only able to segment structures readily visible in the input image,
whereas the example images suggests that what is needed is to infer
the most likely vessel shape even in the case of poor visibility and this
informs our approach here. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Introduction
The increasing worldwide prevalence of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) [34] has spurred
the development of new computational modeling and simulation technologies [18].
Image-based patient-speciﬁc hemodynamic simulation methods, in particular, are
used in personalized medicine and surgical planning for a range of disease applications
[120, 70].
However, the manual segmentation eﬀort required to construct accurate 3D dig-
ital anatomical cardiovascular models for patient-speciﬁc hemodynamic simulations
is currently a labor intensive and time consuming process [120, 98]. Lengthy work-
ﬂows are incompatible with realistic clinical settings where limited time is available to
produce simulation results. Furthermore, to validate the eﬃcacy of simulation tools,
studies and trials involving large patient cohorts are required to statistically correlate
simulation predictions with clinical outcomes, making lengthy workﬂows intractable.
Specialized software tools such as SimVascular1 [125, 126], Cardiovascular Inte-
grated Modeling and Simulation (CRIMSON) [48], and Vascular Modeling Toolkit
(VMTK) [2] have been developed to provide hemodynamic simulation worfklows.
With these software tools, users can construct 3D cardiovascular models vessel-by-
vessel (Fig. 5.3). While this process allows users to construct suﬃciently accurate
and precise cardiovascular models, they typically ﬁnd the segmentation step to be
cumbersome and time-consuming (Fig. 5.3c).

these pathlines to segment 2D cross section contours, (d) loft segmented contours into

Thus, there is a clear need for rapid and automated cardiovascular segmentation
methods. Prior studies have been devoted to improving cardiovascular segmentation
[61, 101, 92], but no commonly accepted methods exist that generalize to varying
image modalities and cardiovascular anatomy. This raises the central question of this
thesis:
Can an automated segmentation algorithm be developed that generalizes
across cardiovascular anatomy and produces cardiovascular models of suf-
ﬁcient quality to be used with patient-speciﬁc cardiovascular simulations?
Considering Figure 5.3, another way to phrase this question is, “Given an input
medical image volume, how can we output an accurate 3D geometric model of the
desired vessels.”
What makes this process challenging? Complications arise from the fact that there
are many ways to represent a cardiovascular anatomic model, e.g. centerlines, local 2D
vessel lumen, 3D digital model and tetrahedral mesh (Figs 5.3b-5.3e). Furthermore,
blood vessel appearance in medical image volumes varies substantially depending on
modality of acquisition, absorption of contrast enhancing ﬂuid, image noise, artifacts,

and surrounding anatomical structures (Figs 1.2a-1.2d). Finally cardiovascular sim-
ulations are particularly sensitive to the quality of the produced geometry, e.g. holes
and jagged edges are intolerable and smooth transitions between vessels are required.

Recently, trends such as the increasing availability of large datasets, improved
large-scale optimization algorithms and developments in cloud computing resources
have lead to a resurgence of interest in machine learning and deep learning approaches
for the development of algorithms tailored to particular domain applications. Su-
pervised deep learning, using large training datasets to optimize neural networks
with many parameters, has lead to improvement over classical algorithms for many
computer vision tasks [60, 58, 106, 118]. Convolutional neural networks, networks
making use of convolutional layers speciﬁcally tailored to process images through
cross-correlation with small ﬁlters with learnable weights, were identiﬁed as a key
element for performance improvements [60, 118].
Convolutional neural networks and deep learning thus present a promising avenue
towards the development of general cardiovascular model building algorithms. How-
ever, a dataset of example images and cardiovascular models is needed to optimize
the learnable parameters of the network. Fortunately the Vascular Model Repository
(VMR, www.vascularmodel.com), built by the Open Source Medical Software Cor-
portion and Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab at Stanford University,
is a dataset containing over 100 example medical image volumes, associated cardio-
vascular models, and simulation results. Our ﬁrst hypothesis is thus that the VMR is
suﬃciently large and well labeled to be used to train convolutional neural networks to
automatically produce cardiovascular models of suﬃcient quality for patient-speciﬁc
cardiovascular simulation.
An additional complication in performing patient-speciﬁc cardiovascular simula-
tion studies is that, due to various factors such as image noise, artifacts, limited
resolution and diﬀerences in modeler interpretation, the true cardiovascular model
for a given image is unknown. In practice this means that there is actually a dis-
tribution of possible cardiovascular models for a given image leading to uncertainty
in the corresponding simulation results. To establish clinical conﬁdence in cardiovas-
cular simulation results, the uncertainty due to cardiovascular model variation must
be quantiﬁed. However, determining the distribution of cardiovascular models for a
given image volume is non-trivial and is an active area of research. Recent trends in
deep learning have shown that neural networks can learn the probability distribution

associated with a given training data set [27]. Our second hypothesis is that the deep
learning based cardiovascular model building methods we develop can be adapted to
learn or sample from the distribution of cardiovascular models.
In concrete terms, this thesis assesses the following claims
• Convolutional neural networks can be trained on the VMR data to produce
cardiovascular models with accuracy better than existing segmentation methods
provided by SimVascular.
• The segmentations produced by the convolutional neural networks can be made
as accurately as the average agreement between expert SimVascular users as
assessed using the DICE metric.
• The developed networks can be augmented with dropout to produce realistic
samples from the cardiovascular model distribution for a given image. Realistic
samples are deﬁned as having distributional qualities similar to model samples
produced by diﬀerent experts.
• The sampled models can be used to assess cardiovascular simulation output
uncertainty due to cardiovascular model uncertainty.
• Cardiovascular model uncertainty is a signiﬁcant source of simulation uncer-
tainty when compared to other input sources of uncertainty.
We ﬁrst discuss background relating to cardiovascular segmentaton and patient-
speciﬁc cardiovascular simulation in Chapter 2.
In chapter 3 we develop a fully-
convolutional neural network approach to accelerate vessel lumen segmentation in
the path-planning cardiovascular model building workﬂow. Building on this, vessel
lumen segmentation is reformulated as a regression problem to improve segmentation
accuracy in Chapter 4. We enable geometric uncertainty quantiﬁcation in Chapter
5 by augmenting convolutional networks with dropout to produce samples from the
vessel lumen distribution for a given image.
Finally in Chapter 6 we discuss the
ramiﬁcations of our work and directions for future research.
