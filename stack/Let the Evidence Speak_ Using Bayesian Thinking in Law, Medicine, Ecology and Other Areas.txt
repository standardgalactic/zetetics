Introduction
Bayes is all the rage!
You’ll read this, or something like it, from time to time. This example is from the
opening sentence of a book by Luc Bovens and Stephan Hartmann [1]. In full the
sentence reads “Bayes is all the rage in philosophy”. You may not be much
interested in philosophy, but that’s just one of the places where Bayes’ Rule
makes an appearance. There are others, not only in books written for academics.
For instance, Angela Saini wrote a piece in The Guardian about the use of
Bayes’ Rule in a court of law under the headline The formula for justice. She writes
that Bayes’ Rule was
Invented by an 18th-century English mathematician, Thomas Bayes, this calculates the
odds of one event happening given the odds of other related events [2].
And here’s Tim Harford writing in a piece called How to make good guesses that
when we have two pieces of information
Logically, one should combine the two pieces of information . . . There is a mathematical
rule for doing this perfectly (it’s called Bayes’ rule) [3].
Finally, describing the application of Big Data to online advertising, Cathy O’Neil
writes
The data scientists start off with a Bayesian approach, which in statistics is pretty close to
plain vanilla. The point of Bayesian analysis is to rank the variables with the most impact
on the desired outcome. Search advertising, TV, billboards, and other promotions would
each be measured as a function of their effectiveness per dollar. Each develops a different
probability, which is expressed as a value, or a weight [4].
All of which is ﬁne, but just what is Bayes’ Rule?
It’s been with us for about 300 years and every so often enjoys some popular
prominence. Articles and books such as those above are not written for a technical
audience. They may have whetted your appetite—sounds good but how does it
work? You want to know more but you don’t want a statistics text. This book is
for you.

Decisions should be made based on evidence.
A doctor may use a test such as a blood test or MRI scan when diagnosing what
illness a patient might have. Experimental results show the diagnostic power of the
test, its ability to provide evidence for the doctor who then must decide what to tell
the patient. Some tests are very informative, some less so.
Police investigating a crime and juries trying an accused have to use evidence
too. This is of variable quality, ranging from DNA matching (pretty good) to
eyewitness identiﬁcation (not so good), and yet decisions of guilt and innocence
are made.
What is common is that someone—a doctor, a juror—makes a decision based on
what they believe to be true and this belief is based, in part at least, on evidence.
Bayes’ Rule provides the necessary link between the evidence and what to believe
based on that evidence. The better the evidence the stronger is the belief that the
patient is ill or the accused is guilty. The strength of the evidence, and so of our
belief, is described using probability.
Bayes’ Rule takes us that far. What to do, what action to take, is your decision.
You will have a measure of your justiﬁed belief to help you.
~ • ~
There are many ﬁne books and research papers you could read about Bayes’ Rule
and its applications but they tend to be written in the formal language of mathe-
matics. They may assume that you know more than you do. We all hit a barrier at
some point.
The motivation for this book is that it is possible and useful to describe for any
reader, whatever their (which is to say, your) background, what Bayes’ Rule is and
how it works. Bayes’ Rule is usually presented as a formula. For many this is not an
encouragement to read further. But a great many real applications, not just text book
illustrations, need no more than simple arithmetic. To show the calculations I have
used a table—the Bayes Grid. All you need to know is how to add, multiply and
divide. Think of a very simple spreadsheet.
Bayes’ Rule is also a way of thinking, of forcing you to answer questions
What do I know about this problem?
What evidence do I have and how good is it?
What alternative explanations might account for the evidence?
Asking the right questions is always a good idea, even if you sometimes need
help with the maths.

Introduction

This book is organised in three parts. The ﬁrst sets out the basic relation between
evidence and the alternative accounts for that evidence. The second extends the
basic framework to bring in other information you may have. This may be based on
data or on judgement. You need to know how to deal with the issues raised by this
useful extension.
Up to this point the calculations have been easy. The emphasis has been on
thinking about how to use evidence, asking the right questions. Many applications
are not so straightforward either because the maths is more difﬁcult or because the
decision problem is, by its nature, more complex. The chapters in this third part
cover both.
In summary, the three parts are
Likelihood
The key to it all. The necessary description of the relation between
the evidence you have, what might account for it, and what you are
justiﬁed in believing.
Base rate
Base rates enable you to use contextual or judgemental information
as well as evidence. Bayes’ Rule becomes a means of learning,
modifying your starting belief in light of new evidence. Bringing
in judgement is quite natural, but care is needed. We may not be as
good as we think at expressing our judgement in the form of
probabilities.
Application
Many of the applications of Bayes’ Rule use mathematical models
which
are
daunting
for
non-mathematicians.
However,
the
underlying principles are the same as in the earlier parts. These
ﬁnal chapters show how some Bayes’ thinking helps structure
problems and some of the modelling issues which follow.
The closing two chapters, on law and the psychology of
reasoning, do not involve heavy maths. They further emphasise the
beneﬁts of using Bayes’ Rule as a way of thinking.
Notes and references are there to provide hints and reading should you wish to go
further. Some of the references may not be for you but none are needed for you to
read this book and, I hope, beneﬁt from it.

Likelihood

Chapter 2
Whose Car?
Evidence provided to the police is often imperfect. Even witnesses who are quite
sure of what they saw or heard may be wrong. How should their evidence be
evaluated?
Let us suppose.
There has been a robbery at a jewellers in Stockholm. Inspector Larsson and his
squad have narrowed the suspects down to just two, Jan and Stig. Larsson is sure
that one of them is guilty but there is no conclusive evidence to decide between
them. Circumstantial evidence puts them both near the crime scene at about the
right time, but that’s not enough. Then a witness, Ingrid, comes forward. She was
walking in the street where the robbery occurred and saw a car driving very fast
away from the jewellers. She only got a very brief look at the car and all she could
say was that it was blue. Stig’s car is blue and Jan’s car is green. But thanks to the
creative efforts of car manufacturers it’s not quite as clear cut as that. A list of car
paint codes shows Albi Blue, Storm Blue, Mountain Blue, Odyssey Blue, Spray
Blue. . .. There are twenty-six shades with blue in the name, and then there’s Aqua
and others. There are only eleven which are green, including Nordic Green. Larsson
smiles. Probably all that can be said is that Stig’s car is more blue-ish and Jan’s car
more green-ish.
So, how can Ingrid’s evidence be evaluated?
Colour is deﬁned by wavelength measured in nanometres (nm). One nanometre
is a billionth of a metre. The visible spectrum is from about 400nm to about 700nm.
Shorter wavelengths, less than 400nm, are called gamma rays and X rays. Longer
wavelengths are used for microwave and radio. In the visible part of the spectrum
ranges of wavelength are given names which are the colours with which we are all
familiar (think rainbow)1:

The way we map this inﬁnite variety into a small and manageable number of
colours is called categorical perception. The same idea can be applied to sounds
and other stimuli. There is inevitably some uncertainty, some vagueness, about
where to draw the line. We may be inconsistent, applying different labels to the
same stimulus on different occasions. Different people will apply different labels.
When Ingrid said “blue” what did she mean?
While browsing the web Larsson’s trusted colleague, Mankell, comes across a
study [1] which may help. In it a number of people were shown colour cards for a
short time and then asked to say whether what they saw was blue or green. The
results are shown as identiﬁcation functions. For any colour shown by its wave-
length on the horizontal axis we can see the percentage of times it was identiﬁed
either as “blue” or as “green”.
Figure 2.1 shows the function for the label “blue”. As the wavelength increases
fewer people say “blue”. For a colour with wavelength 491nm expect that ﬁfty
percent of people would call it “blue”.
Fig. 2.1 Identiﬁcation function for “blue”2
2This and other graphs in this chapter use information from Fig. 2a of Bornstein and Korda [1]:

Whose Car?

Figure 2.2 shows the identiﬁcation functions for both “blue” and “green”. The
two lines are complementary, mirror images. For any wavelength the two percent-
ages sum to one hundred since only those two alternative names—“blue” and
“green”—were used in the experiment.
This graph might be helpful in assessing just what weightshould be given to Ingrid’s
evidence. The actual colours of the two cars are known, the wavelengths have been
measured by the crime scene investigation team, and so the percentage of times that
each car would be expected to be called “blue” or “green” can be read from the graph.
There is no reason to think that Ingrid differs in any relevant way from the
subjects of the original experiment. This graph will do as a basis for assessing how
useful her evidence is in discriminating between Stig’s car and Jan’s car.
We can mark the actual colour of Stig’s car (490nm). Our best estimate is that
seeing Stig’s car seventy-four percent of people will call it “blue” and twenty-six
percent will say “green” (Fig. 2.3).

For Jan’s car (colour is 492.5nm) Fig. 2.4 shows that only sixteen percent of
people would call it “blue” and eighty-four percent “green”.
Because they assume that Ingrid is typical of the subjects tested in the experi-
ment it seems clear to Larsson and Mankell that these results may be used to
describe the accuracy of her assessment: when she says “blue” the odds that the
car is Stig’s car rather than Jan’s car are 74:16. To put it another way, the chance
that the car was Stig’s car is eighty-two percent.3 The chance that it was Jan’s car is
eighteen percent. Larsson and Mankell conclude that based on Ingrid’s evidence the
probability that it was Stig’s car that she saw is about eighty percent. Not bad.

The two policemen did what seemed obvious. Were they right?
Yes, they were.
Although they didn’t know it, they had used Bayes’ Rule. It was the intuitively
obvious thing to do.
~ • ~
This is ﬁne so far as it goes. We have a good idea of the strength of this evidence but
how should it be used together with what else we know, or suspect? How to
combine different sources of evidence?
The natural language of the courtroom is not numeric and neither judges nor jury
members (nor many of us) are used to this form of reasoning. But courts do hear
evidence from expert witnesses, much of which is based on quantitative analysis,
and juries do make decisions.

The usefulness and, which is different, the admissibility of arguments about the
possible statistical basis of evidence and the justiﬁable evaluation of that evidence
is subject to quite a bit of argument. Justiﬁcation is important.
~ • ~
Stig, Jan, Ingrid and the rest are ﬁction. But the possible use of Bayes’ Rule to
assess evidence and, more problematically, to present the analysis in court, are not.
In 1996, Denis Adams was accused of rape. The victim said her attacker was in
his twenties. Adams was 37. The victim was unable to pick Adams in an identity
parade. Adams’ alibi was that he had spent the night in question with his girlfriend.
But DNA evidence at the scene was a good match with Adams’ DNA, though there
was some dispute about the correct match probability. The match probability is the
probability that someone picked at random would match the DNA proﬁle found at
the crime scene. The prosecutor said 1 in 200 million but the defence argued for a
much lower ﬁgure of 1 in 20 million or perhaps even 1 in 2 million. All other
evidence supported Adams’ claim of innocence. What was the jury to make of all
this? Professor Peter Donnelly of Oxford University was permitted by the court to
show the jury how Bayes’ Rule could be used to evaluate the evidence presented to
them. Adams was convicted. He appealed against his conviction.
The Court of Appeal noted that at the original trial no advice was given to the jury
about what they should do if they chose not to use Bayes’ Rule. A retrial was ordered.
At the retrial the court asked that Professor Donelly and other statisticians on the
prosecution’s side cooperate to provide a guide to help the jury. Although Donnelly
had reservations a method was agreed. Jury members were required to complete
questionnaires to illustrate how Bayes’ Rule could be used (Professor Donelly gives
a brief account of all this in the Royal Statistical Society’s journal Signiﬁcance [2]).
Adams was convicted again. He appealed again. The appeal was not upheld. But
the Court of Appeal made observations critical of the use of Bayes’ Rule. For example
Jurors evaluate evidence and reach a conclusion not by means of a formula, mathematical
or otherwise, but by the joint application of their individual common sense and knowledge
of the world to the evidence before them.
Individual jurors might differ greatly not only according to how cogent they found a
particular piece of evidence (which would be a matter for discussion and debate between
the jury as a whole), but also on the question of what percentage ﬁgure for probability
should be placed on that evidence.
Different jurors might well wish to select different numerical ﬁgures even when they were
broadly agreed on the weight of the evidence in question.
The general drift was that the use of Bayes’ Rule, or any mathematical model,
would illegitimately undermine “an area peculiarly and exclusively within the
province of the jury, namely the way in which they evaluate the relationship
between one piece of evidence and another”. In other words, the mental processes
of twelve members of the public can be trusted to make some quite complicated
judgements. That is sometimes inevitable, of course, but where a little calculation
might help it seems harsh to deny the jurors the use of it.

Whose Car?
11

The court decided against the use of Bayes’ Rule in assessing DNA evidence.
But, even if jurors had some appreciation of probabilities of events familiar to them
or which they might easily imagine—tossing a coin, choosing a card—they (and
we) are unlikely to have an appreciation of what a probability of 1 in 200 million, or
0.000000005, means. In the trial this very low rate implied that the number of
people in the UK matching Adam’s DNA proﬁle was small, just one or two. They
might be children or older folk and so not suspects. Or they might be related to
Adams. He did, in fact, have a half-brother whose DNA proﬁle was not known.
If the match rate was as high as 1 in 2 million then there might be about thirty or
so people who would match: a different picture.
Guidance along these lines has subsequently been issued to judges so that they
might help jurors, and themselves, get a grip on these very low probabilities.
~ • ~
This isn’t a problem which will go away. In 2010 a convicted killer, “T”, took his
case to the Court of Appeal. One of the pieces of evidence against him involved his
Nike trainers and the likelihood that shoe prints at the scene of the crime matched
his shoes. The judge believed that the expert witness had incorrectly calculated the
match probability. The case was quashed.
Professor Norman Fenton of Queen Mary, University of London, pointed out
that the conclusion was not well justiﬁed and, surprise, proposed that Bayes’ Rule
would help.4 He, with others, built a model based on the rule to help in judicial
decision making. Their model allows the combination of evidence which is based
on data and evidence which relies on judgement.5
We’ll return to this problem of using Bayes thinking in court in Chap. 16.
~ • ~
The same ideas should help doctors to make diagnoses. You can easily imagine
other applications.
And just think where all that big data analysis might lead. Simply having more
data is not enough, we still need to have a way of reaching justiﬁable decisions.
It should be clear that numerical analyses do not replace judgement. But where
the application of a little mathematics can help that judgement it would be wilful to
reject it out of hand. There is pretty good evidence that we human beings aren’t too
smart when it comes to dealing with numerical information unaided by some
calculation. Just what to do with the answers is where judgement comes to the fore.

Thomas Bayes when he devised his rule for reasoning from evidence to belief. But
just what is Bayes’ Rule? And who was Bayes?

Chapter 3
Bayes’ Rule
In the previous chapter the two policemen had evidence that was not precise. The
evidence they had was an eyewitness report that a car was “blue” and they wanted
to see how strongly this pointed to Stig’s car, which was blue, or to Jan’s car, which
was green. This is typical of many problems we face: we have to decide between a
number of alternatives (which car?) based on some imprecise evidence (“blue”). To
judge just how useful the evidence is we need to know the relation between each of
the alternatives and the evidence. This goes by many names: accuracy, track record,
diagnostic power and so on.
The idea is simple enough. If I don’t know how much you know about the
Nigerian economy why should I ask you about it? Or, if you give your opinion
anyway, how seriously should I take what you say? I should ﬁnd out about your
track record. How good a pundit are you? Often we don’t, of course. What do you
know of your doctor’s track record? Dealing with this sort of judgemental evidence
raises all sorts of issues about credibility, bias and much else.
Fortunately, for a great many problems we have data on which to base an
evaluation of the relation between what we have as evidence and the alternative
causes or explanations of that evidence. Larsson and his team show how we might
use evidence. It is a straightforward case which we can put into a more formal,
though still simple, framework which will be useful for other problems.
Remember that the paint used by the makers of Stig’s car would be called “blue”
by seventy-four percent of people and “green” by the rest. Only sixteen percent of
people would call Jan’s car “blue”. Table 3.1 shows this information.

Each row of the table shows how likely is the evidence—“blue” or “green”—
depending on which car was seen. The sum of each row is one hundred percent.
This is because only these two values of evidence are thought to be possible. We
have ruled out the possibility that a witness will say that either car was red, for
instance. So, a witness must say either that the car was blue or that it was green:
there are no other alternatives, no other colours are considered. These two distinct
values cover all possibilities. That is why the sum is one hundred percent.
This is a table presenting some experimental data.
The witness, Ingrid, was not part of the study described in the research but we
have no reason to believe that she is different from the study participants in the way
she identiﬁes colours. It is reasonable to say that the likelihood, the probability, that
she would have called Stig’s car blue is seventy-four percent.
Just pause for a minute. The shift in perspective from data summary to prediction
is common enough, but just check it. To take one of those simple examples that stats
teachers use to illustrate a point, think of a deck of cards. There are thirteen cards in
each of four suits. That is data summary. The probability that you will pick a
diamond is a quarter, twenty-ﬁve percent. That is a probability assessment for the
result of your decision: a prediction.
Just as a diamond is one of the cards in the deck so Ingrid is one of the population
of Stockholm. But it’s a bit more than that. We reasonably assume that one deck of
cards is like any other. There is no reason to believe that the deck from which you
choose is different from any other deck. In all cases the probability of picking a
diamond is a quarter. And so we assume that the population from which Ingrid is
drawn, the residents of Stockholm, is no better or worse at identifying colours than
the population from which the people taking part in the experiment came. This is
plausible.
~ • ~
Each row of the table is a probability distribution. The values in the row show how
likely evidence is for each of the two alternatives, the two cars in this case. These
probability distributions are called likelihood distributions and are the key to
describing how evidence is related to alternative explanations of that evidence.
The table showed probabilities as percentages which sum to one hundred but
they could also be shown as decimal fractions that sum to one, as in Table 3.2.

Use either. Most people ﬁnd percentages easier to read though sometimes
decimal fractions are easier for calculations. However you show them likelihoods
are the key to using evidence.
~ • ~
Of all the possible different values of evidence, “blue” and “green”, we have one,
“blue”. What should we believe? Do as the police did: believe in the alternatives
according to how likely each is to explain the evidence. It makes sense to express
this belief as a probability distribution, so rescale the likelihood values to sum to
one hundred percent. Figure 3.1 shows this simple rescaling.
~ • ~
Using the word belief for these probabilities is important. It emphasises that what
you believe is personal. It may be that where the evidence and likelihoods are
uncontroversial we would all believe the same thing; that the probability of a coin
coming down heads is ﬁfty percent, for instance. But this is not always so. Different
people may identify a different set of alternatives—Stig, Jan and Mats. Some of
these differences can be accommodated in the model or extensions of it. The
following chapters will show how.

We now have a framework for reasoning with evidence.
A simple table is all that we needed to give a structure to our problem.
The model was just “ﬁll the rows then look at the columns”. There will be a little
more to it than that, but that is the essence.
Here are the components of the model as shown in the table.
1. Each row shows an alternative.
What might explain the evidence; a particular deck of cards, a particular
car?
Have we missed any possible alternative explanations?
2. Each element in a row shows a possible value of the evidence.
What evidence might we collect; a card, a colour?
The list shows all possible values so that one, but only one, will be seen.
3. Values in rows show likelihoods.
For each cell in a row write how likely it is that that evidence will be seen
if that alternative is the true alternative explanation.
Call these numbers, the entries in each row, the likelihood of each piece of
evidence.
Make sure each row sums to one hundred percent to give a complete
likelihood distribution for each alternative.
4. Rule.
Once the evidence is seen rescale the likelihoods in the corresponding
column to sum to one hundred percent.
The result is a probability distribution showing the degree of belief you are
justiﬁed in having that each alternative is the true alternative.
The key word is justiﬁed.
~ • ~
To summarise, remember the very important rule which tells us how to make sense
of what we see
believe in alternative causes or explanations in proportion to the
degree to which they explain the evidence
or
belief is proportional to likelihood
This, in one form or another, is Bayes’ Rule, named for its proposer. But just
who was Bayes?

If ever you are in London go to Bunhill Fields on the edge of the City near the cluster of
tech start-ups known as silicon roundabout (British irony, perhaps). Here, just off the

City Road, you ﬁnd a small burial ground in which rest the remains of nonconformist
churchmen. It is now a public park. Although appropriately modest this cemetery is
home (if that is the right word) to William Blake and John Bunyan and Daniel Defoe.
Here also is the tomb of the Bayes and Cotton families. On the top of this tomb is an
inscription commemorating its 1969 restoration made possible by “subscriptions from
statisticians worldwide”. This generosity was in recognition of the contribution(which
we have just begun to examine) of one of the Bayes family, a priest.
Fig. 3.2 Thomas Bayes (1702–1761)1
Thomas Bayes (Fig. 3.2) was born in 1702. His father was Joshua Bayes, a
nonconformist minister at Leather Lane, in Holborn, London. In 1731, following a
private education, Thomas also was ordained as a Presbyterian minister and took up
a ministry at Tunbridge Wells, in Kent. He had a lifelong interest in mathematics
and statistics, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1742. He retired
from the ministry in 1752 and remained in Tunbridge Wells until his death in 1761.
He published just two papers during his lifetime: in 1731, Divine Providence and
Government Is the Happiness of His Creatures, and, ﬁve years later, An Introduc-
tion to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defense of the Analyst, this being an attack
on Bishop Berkeley following the Bishop’s attack on Newton’s calculus.
After Bayes’ death his friend Richard Price, also a Bunhill Fields resident, sent a
further paper by Bayes to the Royal Society and in 1763 it was published in the
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London as Essay Towards
Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances. It is this paper which contains the
famous rule.2

Bayes’ Rule
19

The rule was independently proposed some years later by the French mathematician
Pierre-Simon Laplace (Fig. 3.3). Born of humble origins in 1749 at Beaumont-en-
Auge in Normandy, Laplace’s intellectual achievements were, to put it mildly,
considerable, but he seems to be in other respects not possessed of wholly admira-
ble qualities. His vanity and arrogance were matched by his ability to blow with the
wind so as not to fall out with patrons and politicians. Given the bloody times
through which he lived in revolutionary France, not least the time of the Reign of
Terror in 1793, this may have been no bad thing. He wisely agreed with the scheme
for the new revolutionary calendar even though he knew that the length of the
proposed year was incompatible with astronomical observations then available.
Fig. 3.3 Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827)3
It was, in fact, in the ﬁeld of mathematical astronomy that Laplace made his most
distinguished contribution, the ﬁve volume Traite´ du Me´canique Ce´leste, which, a
little unusually for the time, contained no mention of God. When Laplace went to
present this work to Napoleon the following well known exchange occurred:
NAPOLEON
Monsieur Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the
system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator.
LAPLACE
Sir, I had no need of that hypothesis.
In 1812 Laplace published his The´orie Analytique des Probabilite´s. In the
second volume (of only two this time) he set out his deﬁnition of probability.

Bayes’ Rule

This was, it transpired, the same as Bayes’ Rule, which was unknown to him. In
fact, the rule was not even called Bayes’ Rule at that time. It was so named a few
years later by another mathematician, Poincare´, like Laplace a Frenchman, thereby
avoiding yet another Anglo-French tiff.
~ • ~
Here is the problem with which Bayes was concerned, as he set it out:
Given the number of times in which an unknown event has happened
and failed: Required the chance that the probability of its happening
in a single trial lies somewhere between any two degrees of probability
that can be named.
We may say
Given the number of people who say “blue” rather than “green”:
Required the chance that the probability that one person will say “blue”
when seeing a colour of known wavelength lies somewhere in a
speciﬁed range.
This problem is a little more subtle than the analysis of Ingrid’s witness
statement. We did not conclude that the probability that the car was Stig’s car
was between seventy percent and ninety percent but only that it is eighty-two
percent. It is likely that what we would actually say is that is about eighty-two
percent, the “about” signalling some caution.
We’ll think about this later, but for now we’ll stick with the simpler idea.
~ • ~
The rule that
belief is proportional to likelihood
is uncontroversial. It is the base for statistical inference, for deciding what we should
believe based on available data. There is, of course, a huge literature on this and the
necessary mathematics.4 There are many excellent books you can read if you are
interested. Here are just a few, roughly in order of mathematical explicitness.
McGrane [4] All narrative with no maths at all. A good read.
Phillips [5] An old book, so might be hard to ﬁnd. I read and liked it when it was
ﬁrst published. Still do. About the level you might expect for an introductory
stats class for those with not much maths.
4Most of the applications of Bayes’ Rule are described in the books and journals particular to the
application; forensic science, archaeology and so on. You might also ﬁnd the website of the
International Society for Bayesian Analysis (https://bayesian.org/) and their journal Bayesian
Analysis useful, though most contributions are quite technical.

Stone [6] A short introduction. Quite friendly.
Lee [7] Another short introduction for those with a maths background.
Gill [8] Not a short introduction. Read this if you’re happy with Lee and want
more.
O’Hagan and West [9] For those already familiar with Bayesian analysis who
want to see the variety of practical applications.
But this is not a book which requires you to have a background in mathematics or
statistics; not at all. The emphasis is on using a simple framework to think more
clearly and ask useful questions. This doesn’t require you to do much more than the
calculations in the table introduced in this chapter. We’ll use this table a lot so give
it the shorthand name Bayes Grid. It’s simple and works well for a lot of problems.
In the next three chapters we will see how to use likelihoods based on a track
record of past performance, some careful reasoning, and a statistical model.

Experimental results are one way of ﬁnding the relation between what people say
and alternative accounts of why they said it. Likelihoods quantify that relation and
make the results usable. That’s what the Stockholm police did to ﬁnd how likely it
was that Ingrid said “blue” or “green”. The data showed what a number of people,
the sample, said and how their judgements varied with the colour they saw. We
don’t always have a convenient experimental sample. Sometimes we have advice or
prediction from just one source; a ﬁnancial advisor, a doctor, the weather forecast or
perhaps, if football is your thing, a football pundit.

Step forward Mark Lawrenson, Lawro to his many fans. When Liverpool signed him
from Brighton and Hove Albion for £900,000 in 1981 he was the most expensive
defender in Britain. Following a distinguished playing career for Liverpool and for
the Republic of Ireland he is now one of the BBC team of football experts.
As well as providing his thoughts on the matches he also makes predictions.
Each week he predicts the results of the ten Premiership games to be played the
following weekend. He makes his predictions on Thursday to go on the BBC
football website on Friday, so he has no information of last minute team changes.
This is a bit of fun and not Lawro’s main job but it seems reasonable to believe
he does his best. So, how good are Lawro’s predictions? Table 4.1 shows his
predictions and the actual scores for the ten matches on the ﬁrst day of the
2013–2014 season.

The predictions were perfectly accurate (✓✓) in three cases. In another two the
result was correctly predicted though the score was not (✓). For the remaining ﬁve
matches Lawro got it wrong.
Lawro made predictions for 371 of the 380 matches in the 2013–2014 season,
missing matches which had to be re-arranged because of weather or to accommo-
date an international match or for some other reason. How did he do? Are Lawro’s
predictions a good guide to the outcome of a match?
Figure 4.1 shows what happened over the course of the season.
At the start of the season Lawro, like anyone else, had an idea of the relative
strengths of the different teams based on an appreciation of their performance
during the 2012–2013 season. But some things will be new: new players, new
manager, new owner. Three of the twenty teams had been promoted from the lower
division of English football so their performance was even harder to predict. As the
season progressed results provided an indication of current form and so we might
expect predictions to improve. The graph shows the effect of this information. The
early season success rate ﬂuctuates quite a lot. As the season wears on the success

rate settles down. After week ten Lawro gets about ten percent of scores right but
more than half of the results right, ﬁfty-ﬁve percent towards the end.
Lawro doesn’t become more accurate but he does become more consistent.
But what level of accuracy to measure? That depends on why we want Lawro’s
help. In a time long ago, before personal computers and pay television, people used
to bet on football results through the football pools companies. Each week a punter
would select a ﬁxed number of matches and enter them on a form, “the coupon”,
which would be posted, with a mix of hope and resignation, to the pools company.
Points were awarded depending on the results of the chosen matches: three points
for a score draw, two points for a no score draw (0–0) and one point otherwise.
Points mean prizes, of course. If the total points exceeded some criterion value a
prize was given, which could be substantial. With the pools, as with lotteries, most
got nothing. In those days all matches were played on Saturdays so that it became a
familiar teatime ritual that at ﬁve o’clock chatter must cease so that all attention
could be given to the radio, later television. Results of the day’s matches were
checked against the pools entry. “Ah well, better luck next week. We only missed
by two points. If only Arsenal had got that other goal.”
This ritual is long gone. Punters now have many more online options including
placing bets during the match—who will score the next goal?
How useful you ﬁnd Lawro’s predictions depends on why you want them. What
is your decision? If you are a punter Lawro may help you to decide what the result
might be in advance of the match. If you are betting at half-time on the ﬁnal result
Lawro’s prediction (made on Thursday, remember) will be of much less use, though
you still might want to bear it in mind. If you are betting during the game who will
score next, what Lawro said will be of no use at all. This is quite a general point:
expert opinion is of use only in the context of a decision. The nature of the decision
will determine how useful is the advice, sometimes a lot but sometimes there is no
help, you are on your own.
For a non-betting fan the question is simpler: what will happen? Will we win?
From this perspective it might be useful to think of one of three match results; an
away win (AW), a home win (HW) and a draw (D). How did Lawro do? Table 4.2
shows forecast and result for the 371 matches of the 2013–2014 season.

For the whole season he correctly forecast 203 of the 371 results, a ﬁfty-ﬁve
percent success rate.
Looking at the row and column sums Lawro predicted a lot more home wins than
happened and a lot fewer away wins.
We can use the data in Table 4.2 to get likelihood distributions. Just scale each
row to sum to one hundred percent (Table 4.3).
Looking down each column the maximum likelihood corresponds to the actual
match result. For any match Lawro is more likely to predict the correct match result
than either of the two other possibilities. But how helpful are the predictions?
Suppose that Lawro predicts a home win, what should you believe about the result?
Use the Bayes Grid in Fig. 4.2.
Based only on Lawro’s prediction you should believe that a home win is the most
likely outcome but the probability of this is just forty-six percent, a little under half.
A draw is the next most likely at twenty-nine percent and an away win the least
likely at twenty-ﬁve percent.
Repeat this analysis for the other possible predictions, an away win or a draw, to
see what you should make of them. Table 4.4 shows the justiﬁable degree of belief
you should have in each of the three possible results based only on the evidence of
Lawro’s prediction.

A predicted away win is the most useful; you should believe that correct with a
probability of sixty-four percent.
None of these predictions is perfect. You still have a risky decision to make.
~ • ~
You might have some judgement yourself, independently of what Lawro says,
based on your own evaluation of the relative abilities of the teams. How should
this be used? You could simply take the probabilities from the table and adjust them
according to your judgements: increase this a bit, reduce that a bit and so on. These
adjustments may be based on careful consideration or they may be the wishful
thinking of the die-hard fan. Does it matter? Not in lively conversation with other
fans but you’d need to be careful if you intended to place a big bet. There is a fairly
simple way of taking account of your view but making sure that view is well-
founded and useful rather than delusional fanspeak is the issue. Wait for Chap. 12.

For some folks there are more important things than football; GDP, for instance.
Governments, banks, consultants and others routinely make forecasts of the likely
future state of the economy of their own country and sometimes of others where that
might be useful. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are two multinational organi-
sations which do just this.
In the case of the IMF one year ahead forecasts are made in October and
published in World Economic Outlook. These forecasts are numerical, they give
an estimate of the future value of GDP. Rather than needing a numerical estimate to
be used in a calculation many users of these forecasts want a more general view of
whether the economic situation will improve or not, will GDP increase or decrease?
The way that a business makes decisions is by discussion and in that context what is
most naturally useful is this general view, qualitative rather than quantitative, up
or down.
In 2000 Jordi Pons of the University of Barcelona analysed the accuracy of
forecasts made by the OECD and the IMF for the G7 group of advanced economies
[1]. The seven countries in the G7 at that time were

For each country he looked at the twenty-two forecasts made between 1973 and
1995. We’ll just look at some of the IMF forecasts. For the United States, for
instance, Table 4.5 shows the track record.
The IMF mostly got it right. For ﬁve of the twenty-two years the IMF correctly
forecast an increase in GDP and for another eleven years the IMF correctly forecast
a decrease. Sixteen of the twenty-two forecasts, about three quarters, correctly
identiﬁed the direction of change.
For Japan fourteen forecasts were accurate, a little lower but we have a sample of
only twenty-two comparisons (Table 4.6).
Aggregating the twenty-two comparisons for all seven countries gives a sample
of 154 of which 111, seventy-three percent, were correct (Table 4.7).

Track Record

How can an IMF forecast help in deciding what view to take about GDP for the
coming year: increase or decrease?
If you were doing this now you would use more recent data, of course, but let’s
see what you could have done in 1995. Perhaps you are interested in the Japanese
economy.
To use the next IMF forecast you must decide what data you will use to establish
the track record. Do you want to use just the data for Japan because it is Japan in
which you are interested? Or would you rather use data for the whole of the G7
because it provides a bigger sample? Once you’ve decided that, you will need to
think about whether you want to include all twenty-two forecasts. You may think
that there has been a signiﬁcant change in either the Japanese economy or in the
IMF methodology or both. But using only the more recent comparisons reduces the
sample on which the track record is based. If you aren’t sure what to do make more
than one analysis and see if you reach different conclusions. Would you make a
different decision?
Suppose you decide to consider just the data for Japan but all the data for Japan.
As with Lawro’s predictions get likelihoods by scaling each row of Table 4.6 to
give the likelihood distributions in Table 4.8.
The most recent issue of World Economic Outlook predicts an increase in
Japanese GDP. Now use Bayes Grid in Fig. 4.3.
Based on the IMF forecast believe with probability of about sixty percent that
Japanese GDP will increase. You may prefer to say that you say there is a 60:40
chance of an increase.

Finding data to establish a track record can be tricky. How useful is past perfor-
mance in evaluating current advice or evidence?
It is natural to believe that forecasting performance can be improved and is being
improved: processes are redesigned, algorithms revised, more data are collected
and so on, all in the hope of improvement. Perhaps so. But what is the track record?
There is an apocryphal (I assume) story of a Soviet era Muscovite trying to get a
map of the metro. “I’m sorry”, says the clerk at the metro station, “we don’t have
one. We have a map of how it was in the bad old days and a much nicer map of how
the metro will look at the completion of the ﬁve year plan, but we have no map of
how it is today.”
If the prediction which you want to use is made only infrequently and not
consistently by the same person or method it is hard to establish any sort of track
record at all. You may have to accept plausibility rather than accuracy to help you
judge. Perhaps you rely on notions of authority or trust in lieu of a track record to
help you decide what you should make of the forecast.
Alternatively, you could look at forecasts made by several groups. For example,
every month the Treasury (the UK Finance Ministry) publishes Forecasts for
the UK Economy: a comparison of independent forecasts. In the September 2015
issue there are forecasts from twenty-two City institutions, such as banks, and
seventeen non-City organisations including universities and research organisations.
You need to note that the independence of the forecasts means that the forecasters
are independent of government; they are not employed by the Treasury. Whether
their forecasts are statistically independent is another matter. We’ll get to that in
Chap. 11.

Game Show
In the cases we have looked at so far data have been central to ﬁnding likelihoods.
The police evaluating eyewitness evidence used likelihoods based on data found by
experiment. Consumers of forecasts should use likelihoods based on data showing
track record.
Likelihoods are not always found in this way. Sometimes we have a problem
which has the ﬂavour of a puzzle which we can’t quite fathom. The structure of
Bayes’ Rule forces us to think about what we know, but didn’t know that we knew.
The formalism asks questions which at ﬁrst might seem awkward but which force
us to think clearly. Always a good thing, especially when the solution that looks so
obvious is wrong. Our intuition—yours, mine and just about everyone else’s—is
not always a good guide.

A game show is on television.
It’s a very simple game show, even simpler than usual.
A few questions so easy that even though you feel tired after a long day you can
answer and feel good about it.
At last, this week’s big prize! Will it be two weeks in Florida, a new car, a new
house? This week it is a car.
Bob, the host, and Craig, the contestant, stand in front of a wall painted bright
pink. In the wall are three doors painted green, yellow and blue. Behind one of the
doors, Bob carefully explains (as he has done each week for the years and years that
the show has been running), is a car. Behind the other two doors there is nothing.
Craig is asked to choose a door.
Craig chooses yellow.
“Are you sure?” asks Bob, “are you really sure?”
Craig does not change his mind.
“OK,” says Bob, “now let me help you a little here. Let me make your decision
easier. Craig, let me show you what’s behind the BLUE door.” Bob points to the
blue door. It swings open. There is nothing behind the blue door.
“Now Craig, do you want to change your mind?”
Craig looks thoughtful.

Well, what would you do? And why?

Craig has to make a decision based on evidence.
He has to decide which door he should ask Bob to open. There are three
alternatives; yellow and blue and green.
To assist him Bob has helpfully provided some evidence. He has opened one of
the doors. He could have opened the yellow door or the blue door or the green door.
In this case he opened the blue door.
In the experiment used by the Swedish police the participants, when asked to
identify a colour, could choose to answer “blue” or “green”. In the game Bob can
choose which door to open.
Table 5.1 shows the template for likelihoods. Now we must ﬁll in each row.
Bob, of course, knows where the car is. If he didn’t, he might open a door and
show the car. An easy decision for Craig and a guaranteed loss for the show. Bob
would soon be looking for a new job.
Suppose the car is behind the yellow door.
This limits Bob’s options: he will never open the yellow door and reveal the car.
The probability that the yellow door is opened is zero.
As it happens, Craig has chosen the yellow door so Bob can open either of the
other doors knowing that the car will not be revealed. There is no reason to believe
that Bob favours the blue door or the green door. He is equally likely to open either.
Given that the car is behind the yellow door the likelihood distribution describing
how likely it is that Bob will open each of the three doors shows zero for the yellow
door and equal probabilities for the other two (Table 5.2).

Now, suppose the car is behind the blue door.
Bob’s choice is even more constrained. He certainly won’t open the blue door to
show the car.
Neither will he open the yellow door. Craig has chosen this and he needs to be
left guessing. Remember that the whole point of this part of the show is to see Craig
dithering.
If Bob can open neither the blue door nor the yellow door he must open the green
door: he has no choice at all. The second likelihood distribution shows this
(Table 5.3).
Exactly the same reasoning applies if the car is behind the green door: Bob
cannot open the green door to show the car and neither will he open the yellow door
which Craig has already chosen. Bob must open the blue door (Table 5.4).
We now have a complete description of how Bob’s decision, the evidence, is
related both to where the car is hidden and to Craig’s initial choice. This puts us in a
good position to give Craig a helping hand.
Bob opens the blue door.

Craig should switch. The probability that the car is behind the green door is 67%.
There is a probability of only 33% that it is behind the yellow door he originally
chose.
This is the general result: the odds are always 2:1 in favour of switching.
~ • ~
But by far the most common response is not to change.
This was my ﬁrst thought when I saw this problem some years ago. Yours too?
Don’t worry, we’re in the majority.
The most popular argument is that at the start of the show all three doors were
closed and the car could be behind any of them: the chance that the car was behind
the yellow door, or either of the other two doors, was 1/3. But now one door has
been opened. The car is behind one of the two unopened doors and so the chance is
reduced to 1/2 for each.
The point here is not that the probability has changed from 1/3 to 1/2 but that in
both cases the probabilities stay the same for all unopened doors—three at ﬁrst and
then two. There is therefore no reason to prefer one closed door to any other and so
there is no advantage to switching from yellow.
But this line of argument fails to recognise the constraint on Bob’s decision: he
will not, must not, show Craig where the car is. We tend to frame the problem in
terms of Craig’s decision and fail to recognise that Bob has a decision to make too,
and that when Bob decides which door to open he does not have a free choice: in
two cases out of three he has no choice at all.
There are other ways to arrive at the correct odds, as your search engine will
soon show you, but for me none have the clarity of the Bayesian approach. You are
forced to think about likelihoods and so of the process behind them, in this case
Bob’s point of view and the constraints on his action.

This problem is generally known as the Monty Hall Paradox. It is based on the
1970s American TV show Let’s Make a Deal. The host was a Canadian called
Monty Hall, from Winnipeg (Fig. 5.2). Away from show business he did a great
deal of charity work and in 1988, in recognition of this, he was awarded the Order of
Canada by the Canadian Government.
In the show car keys were behind one door and a picture of a goat behind each of
the other two.
Deciding the correct answer to the problem—to switch or stick—has generated
such useful (and other) discussion over the years that the Monty Hall Paradox is to
be found in university departments of mathematics and philosophy, still provoking
heat as well as light.
Even if the answer isn’t the one you thought of don’t be put out; most of us fall
into the trap, and that includes professors of maths as well as you and me. For
instance, Paul Erd€os was a brilliant mathematician and by choice somewhat peri-
patetic. He used to turn up on the doorstep of the house of a friend or acquaintance
with his suitcase and say “Let’s write a paper”. And so, fuelled by coffee, they did.
Erd€os wrote lots of papers. But it is said that he went to his grave still wondering
what was the correct answer was to the Monty Hall Paradox, and why.

The correct answer was ﬁrst given in a popular American magazine, Sunday
Parade. Marilyn vos Savant (Fig. 5.3) writes a column in which she answers
readers’ questions. She now also has a website so you can ask too.
At one point she was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as having the
highest IQ in the world. Just the person to give advice. In 1991 she was asked
whether contestants such as Craig should switch. She said that they always should.
And this is where the fun and games started.
Her advice was dismissed by many, including professional mathematicians.
But she was right.
Here’s her original answer (taken, as are the responses, from her website3):
Yes; you should switch. The ﬁrst door has a 1/3 chance of winning, but the second door has
a 2/3 chance. Here’s a good way to visualize what happened. Suppose there are a million
doors, and you pick door #1. Then the host, who knows what’s behind the doors and will
always avoid the one with the prize, opens them all except door #777,777. You’d switch to
that door pretty fast, wouldn’t you?

and here are some of the responses:
Since you seem to enjoy coming straight to the point, I’ll do the same. You blew it! Let me
explain. If one door is shown to be a loser, that information changes the probability of either
remaining choice, neither of which has any reason to be more likely, to 1/2. As a
professional mathematician, I’m very concerned with the general public’s lack of mathe-
matical skills. Please help by confessing your error and in the future being more careful.
Robert Sachs, Ph.D.
George Mason University
You blew it, and you blew it big! Since you seem to have difﬁculty grasping the basic
principle at work here, I’ll explain. After the host reveals a goat, you now have a one-in-two
chance of being correct. Whether you change your selection or not, the odds are the same.
There is enough mathematical illiteracy in this country, and we don’t need the world’s
highest IQ propagating more. Shame!
Scott Smith, Ph.D.
University of Florida
Maybe women look at math problems differently than men.
Don Edwards
Sunriver, Oregon
So, there you have it. A nice example of the wisdom of self-appointed experts.
~ • ~
The moral to this tale is that we should always consider how data are generated
before using them as the basis for a decision.
The apparent paradox in seeing that Craig should switch although it seemed
intuitively obvious that this was unnecessary was resolved by a shift in viewpoint
from Craig to Bob. Bob’s decisions were highly constrained and it was the
recognition of these constraints which showed that his apparently whimsical choice
contained information which Craig could use. The structure imposed by Bayes Grid
made sure that we asked the right questions.
~ • ~
Not all likelihood distributions rely on this sort of reasoning, of course, nor on the
tabulation of data in a track record. In a great many cases a mathematical model
describes likelihood distributions which have a common form and so are useful for
a number of apparently quite different problems. The maths can be a little harder
than you want to cope with but the underlying principles are usually easy to grasp,
as we’ll see in the next chapter.

Margin of Error
The Stockholm police were able to link Ingrid’s eyewitness evidence with the cars
of the two suspects because they had likelihoods to help them do it. These likeli-
hoods had been found by simple counting. The experimenters counted how many
people said “blue” and how many said “green” when shown a particular colour.
There was no theoretical model which could have been used based on the relation
between wave length and some visual and cognitive processes which resulted in the
probability that a person would name the colour as blue or green. When no theory
exists we count.
Which is just what we did to use the track record of Lawro and the IMF.
Being made to specify likelihoods is a useful discipline which sometimes helps
us avoid falling into the trap of believing what seems obvious. Sometimes what
seems obvious is also correct. Sometimes not, as we found in the game show.
But sometimes we are able to use a little theory to ﬁnd likelihoods. This is most
often possible when what interests us is described by number rather than by
categories (blue/green, increase/decrease, switch door/don’t). Market researchers
want to know what proportion of consumers would buy their new product were it to
be introduced. Opinion pollsters want to know the percentage of voters intending to
vote for one of the parties in a forthcoming election. People are asked. But not
everyone. Neither time nor money are available for that exercise, and so a sample is
taken. The results of the survey provide evidence. Bayes’ Rule will show what it is
then justiﬁable to believe and how strongly we should have that belief.

In 2015 people living in Scotland voted in a referendum whether they wished to
become independent of the United Kingdom. Forty-ﬁve percent voted in favour, the
Yes vote, and ﬁfty-ﬁve percent voted against, the No vote. Independence is the
founding principle of the Scottish National Party, SNP, and its predecessors. On
becoming the majority party in the Scottish parliament the SNP was committed to a
referendum. The result was closer than most commentators expected.
The vote has been lost, this time, but the popularity of the SNP was greatly
increased during the campaign and there exists a general feeling that another
referendum will be held provided the SNP remains in power in Scotland. A long

series of referenda may lie ahead (the “neverendum”). Voter sentiment will be
affected by events: the revenue from North Sea oil falls, the fortunes of the SNP and
other political parties, Brexit, and many others, no doubt. But feelings for and
against the Union run deep and strong. Opinion polls are commissioned by news-
papers and others to keep track of popular sentiment.
Between 9 March and 14 March 2017 the polling organisation YouGov asked
1028 people this question
If there was a referendum tomorrow on Scotland’s future and this was
the question, how would you vote? Should Scotland be an
independent country?
and got the answers shown in the ﬁrst column of Table 6.1.1
Thirty-seven percent said they would vote Yes
Disregarding the Wouldn’t vote and Don’t know responses, forty-three percent
of those answering either Yes or No said they would vote Yes. This is the headline
ﬁgure that was seen in the news.
But this is a report based on a sample, not a poll of all voters. Surely, this cannot
mean that exactly forty-three percent of all those eligible to vote would vote Yes.
~ • ~
Like the popular media reports of the YouGov survey, let’s consider only the
answers Yes and No.
The result may be that forty-three percent of the people surveyed said they would
vote Yes this time. But we haven’t asked everyone. It seems reasonable to believe
that if we had then “about” forty-three percent would have said Yes. But what does
“about” mean? We might say that forty-three percent intend to answer Yes within a
margin of error. The phrase margin of error is more helpful than “about” because it
implies that some quantitative measure of imprecision is both possible and useful.
Here’s how it works.

Keep it simple to start with. First, we have a view that in the population as a
whole the proportion who say they would vote Yes is either 40%, 45% or 50%, an
unrealistically restricted set of possible alternatives which we’ll relax later. Second,
we pick one person, Alex, at random and ask him the question. How can we use
what he says?
Use the Bayes Grid.
Alex has been picked at random. We know nothing about him and so have no
reason to think he is atypical, no reason to think he is more or less likely to vote Yes
than anyone else. So if it is true that forty percent of the population say they will
vote Yes then the probability that any one of them, Alex in this case, will vote Yes is
also forty percent. The probability that Alex will vote No must be sixty percent (our
sample excludes the undecided). Table 6.2 shows the three likelihood distributions,
one for each of the three alternative proportions of the population who would say
they would vote Yes.
Alex says Yes. Use Bayes Grid to ﬁnd the justiﬁed belief we should have about
the population’s voting intentions (Fig. 6.1).
Because Alex says Yes it is natural to believe more in higher values of the
population proportion. The Bayes Grid shows just how this happens. We are
justiﬁed in believing that the probability that forty percent of the population say
they will vote Yes is 30%, that forty-ﬁve percent say they will vote Yes is 33% and
that half say they will vote Yes is 37%.

What happens if we interview two people?
The second person we interview, Nicola, is also chosen at random.
Now we have a sample of two (!) we need a new likelihood distribution.
When we were only considering what Alex might say there were just two
possibilities: Alex might say either Yes or No.
Now, with Nicola to consider as well, there are four possible outcomes
Alex says Yes & Nicola says Yes
Alex says No & Nicola says No
Alex says Yes & Nicola says No
Alex says No & Nicola says Yes
What if ﬁfty percent of the population would say they will vote Yes, and so ﬁfty
percent would say No?
As before, we have no reason to believe that either Alex or Nicola differ from the
population as a whole in what they will say. We also assume that what Alex says is
independent of what Nicola says. There is no link between them. Knowing what
Alex said provides no information about what Nicola might say, just as knowing
what happened when you ﬁrst toss a coin tells you nothing about what might happen
when you toss it a second time.
All four of the outcomes are equally likely. The probability of each is ¼.
Another way of thinking about this is by analogy with tossing a coin twice. The
probability of each toss showing heads is ½. To get the probability of two heads just
multiply: ½  ½ ¼ ¼.
The probabilities for each of the four possibilities are shown in Table 6.3.
But we aren’t interested in what Nicola might say and what Alex might say as
individuals, we only want to know the likelihood of what they both might say taken
together: might they both say Yes or might they both say No or might one say Yes
and one say No? This last result could happen in two ways, Alex says Yes and
Nicola says No or vice versa. Both give the same result, one Yes and one No. We
don’t care who said what, only how many said what, so we need to add the two
probabilities (Table 6.4).

The three probabilites in the ﬁnal column are the likelihood distribution. This
shows the probability of what any two people will say if it is true that in the
population ﬁfty percent will say Yes.
~ • ~
Was that easy or hard?
In 2013 the Royal Statistical Society and the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries
commissioned YouGov to ﬁnd how many people could correctly answer this
question
If you spun a coin twice, what is the probability, expressed as a
percentage, of getting two heads?
Fewer than half senior managers and professionals gave the right answer. In a
similar survey in 2012 forty-six percent of Members of Parliament got it right [1]. If
you had to think a bit you are in good company.
~ • ~
Exactly the same calculation can be used for any other assumed proportion. For
example, if the assumed proportion of those in the population saying Yes is forty
percent the probability that Alex says Yes and Nicola says No is 0.4  0.6 ¼ 0.24.
Find the three probabilities for the likelihood distribution as before (Table 6.5).
This useful little model is called the Binomial distribution. Use it to get the three
likelihood distributions, one for each of the possible population values, as shown in
Table 6.6.

We ask Nicola and she says Yes, as did Alex. Of the two interviewed both said
Yes. Figure 6.2 shows what we should believe about the population’s intention.
This second Yes should have reinforced our belief that more rather than fewer
members of the population will answer Yes. It does, as you can see in Table 6.7.
If both said No then, naturally, the probability that lower population proportions
are the true proportions is increased (Fig. 6.3).

Again, more data (from Nicola) has resulted in more discrimination, this time in
favour of the lower values (Table 6.8).

But how ridiculous, you say, this is inadequate for two reasons: the possible
population percentages are limited to just three values and a sample of just two
people is hopeless.
You’re right, of course. This was just a very simple application of the model kept
small so that you could easily see the mechanics. Both objections are easily
overcome.
Any spreadsheet will have a function which will calculate Binomial probabili-
ties. It will also easily enable you to make a grid which has as many rows and
columns as you want. For example, if eight out of twenty people, forty percent, say
Yes and we use as possible population percentages 0,5,10. . . then the estimate, the
justiﬁed belief, we should have about the population percentage is described by the
probability distribution in Fig. 6.4.

This uses exactly the same principles as were used to deal with just Alex and
Nicola. The calculation needs more effort but only because more detailed descrip-
tions have been used. The principles are the same: Bayes Grid with more rows and
columns but still with Binomial likelihoods. Make the estimate as ﬁne as you wish.
Using increments of one percent rather than ﬁve percent gives this ﬁner distribution
(Fig. 6.5).

Now we can think again of Bayes’ original problem
Given the number of times in which an unknown event has happened
and failed: Required the chance that the probability of its happening

in a single trial lies somewhere between any two degrees of probability
that can be named.
which for us means
Given
that eight people out of twenty said Yes
Required
the chance that the probability that some other member of the
population will say Yes lies somewhere between any two
limits.
We do not often want to know the chance that the probability that one person
will say Yes is within a given range. It is much more likely that we want an estimate
of the proportion of the population with that intent. For example, we might want to
ﬁnd the probability that in the population the proportion saying Yes is within ten
percentage points of that forty percent. The calculation is the same but the inter-
pretation different
Given
that eight people out of twenty said Yes
Required
the probability that in the population the proportion that will
say Yes lies somewhere between thirty percent and ﬁfty
percent.
This is just the sum of all the probabilities in that range, the dark bars in Fig. 6.6.
Based on the evidence of our sample of just twenty people we are justiﬁed in
believing there is a probability of 68% that between thirty percent and ﬁfty percent
of the population in Scotland will say Yes.

But we can do better than that.
Making the increments smaller and smaller the vertical bars merge.
The result is a smooth curve. The individual bars are indistinguishable. The sum
of the bars becomes the area under the curve (Fig. 6.7).
The curve is called a Beta distribution. No new principles have been used, just a
bit more maths. Your spreadsheet should have a function to help.
The area under the curve between the limits of thirty percent and ﬁfty percent is
66%. The value of 68% was an approximation, though not too bad.
~ • ~
This model is useful for estimating a percentage from a sample. Market researchers
use it to ﬁnd market share or brand recognition. Engineers use it to estimate the
defect rate on a production line from a test sample. You can think of a lot more
applications.
What we do not have is a prediction of the referendum.
What we do have is a suitably expressed estimate of the proportion who say they
would vote Yes. But an opinion poll is not the real thing.
Our estimate is suitably expressed because it gives an indication of the
(im)precision of what can be believed from the survey, the margin of error.

The result of such a small survey is usually thought to be too imprecise to be of
much use. Increasing the sample size to 500 helps, as Fig. 6.8 shows.

You can now be just about certain that the population percentage is between
thirty and ﬁfty.
The probability that the population percentage is within two points of forty
percent is 64%. Believe there is a sixty-four percent chance that the population
percentage is within two points of forty percent. The margin of error is two
percentage points

What was the margin of error of the YouGov poll?
Remember that the sixteen percent who answered either that they would not vote
or the they did not know how they would vote were disregarded. The reduced poll
result was that forty-three percent of a sample of 864 said they would vote Yes.
Figure 6.9 shows the Bayes estimate for the result.

There is a ninety-ﬁve percent chance that between forty percent and forty-six
percent of all voters would say Yes. This kind of reporting interval is called a
conﬁdence interval2. A ninety-ﬁve percent conﬁdence interval is the most popular
report to make.
We could also have reported the result as 43  3%, where 3% is a margin of
error.
~ • ~
When planning a survey pollsters and others specify a margin as a requirement and
then use this to help plan their survey. In the UK it is quite common that samples of
about 2000 are used. This gives a probability of ninety-ﬁve percent that the true
population percentage is within about two points of the survey result, an arbitrary
but widely accepted standard. The YouGov survey used a smaller sample and so the
margin of error was larger.
As you would expect, the more data you have the smaller the margin of error.
Figure 6.10 shows the effect.
This is the familiar story: to get a better product you must pay more, but see how
diminishing returns set in. To halve the margin of error from two percentage points
to one point would need a much bigger sample of 8000 people.
~ • ~
Fig. 6.10 More data reduces the margin of error
2A conﬁdence interval is symmetric. The tail areas are equal so that the probability that the true
value is smaller than the interval is the same as the probability that it is higher than the interval;
both 2.5% in this case. You may also read of a credible interval or highest density region. These
intervals are chosen so that the width of the interval is minimised. For symmetric distributions the
credible interval is the same as the conﬁdence interval but for skewed distributions it is not.
Bayesian statisticians usually favour credible intervals.

Margin of Error

In this chapter we have seen how the use of statistical models (the Binomial and
Beta distributions in this case) enable an analysis of a standard problem, one that is
analytically the same even though the contexts vary
percentage having a particular opinion
percentage of defective items
percentage of satisﬁed customers
percentage of patients with an illness
and so on. All have a parameter of interest to us, the proportion in the population of
voters or customers or whatever. To estimate the value of the parameter we use
evidence from a sample. This means that the estimate cannot be exact. The
Bayesian analysis shows just how inexact, the margin of error.

Chapter 7
Five Thoughts About Likelihoods
To round off this section on likelihoods and how to use them this chapter shows
how thinking in likelihoods can be helpful even when no numerical calculation
is used.
The cases we’ve looked at so far have shown how likelihoods are the basis for
deciding what you should believe given some evidence. They determine the
strength of belief you should have in alternative causes or explanations of the
evidence using Bayes’ Rule
belief is proportional to likelihood
If the likelihoods can be described using numbers — probabilities — then so too
can the strength of the belief you should have in alternative explanations. For the
most part this is straightforward. But even if the analysis is made without numbers
the ideas used by Bayes provide a helpful framework for thinking about alternatives
and the likelihoods that go with them.

In October 2001 the United States, and much of the world, was trying to decide just
what were the implications of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in
New York. To say that people were anxious would be a colossal understatement.
What did it mean? What happens now? What should I do? What should the US do?
Reactions ranged from cool appraisal to outright panic. Might there now be a threat
from chemical attack?
On 2 October Robert Stevens, who worked for a newspaper in Florida, was
admitted to hospital with anthrax [1]. He died three days later. On 9 October, after a
second worker in a newspaper mailroom contracted anthrax, the FBI took over the
investigation. Since both victims had worked in a mailroom perhaps the anthrax
spores came by mail. Letters addressed to Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy
were found to contain anthrax spores. The letters had been posted in New Jersey and
processed at the facility in Hamilton Township. They then went to the facility at
Brentwood, Washington D.C. The Capitol shut down.
The next day a postal service worker in Hamilton tested positive for anthrax.
And the day after that one of his colleagues tested positive as well.

Experts at the Center for Disease Control assured postal ofﬁcials that envelopes
carrying anthrax posed no threat to postal workers. But they were wrong. The
buffeting the mail took as it passed through the automatic sorting machines released
the micron sized spoors which were then dispersed by the air conditioning system.
On 17 October, a Wednesday, Thomas Morris Jr, who worked at the Brentwood
facility in Washington, did not feel well. His doctor diagnosed a virus and sent
Morris home. On Sunday his breathing became very laboured and he thought he
might have contracted anthrax. He was taken by ambulance to hospital where he
died shortly afterwards.
On that same Sunday Joseph Curseen, also a postal worker at Brentwood,
complained of ﬂu-like symptoms and was taken to the emergency room of the
local hospital. He was sent home. But his symptoms became more acute and so he
returned to the hospital. Six hours later he was dead from anthrax inhalation.
Two more victims for the terrorists. Well, no.
In 2004 the FBI believed that the strain of anthrax used in the attacks was
RMR-1029. This had been developed in 1997 at USAMRIID (United States Army
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases), the US Army’s main
bioweapons laboratory, by Bruce Ivins. Ivins became the main suspect [2]. He
was no terrorist; he had a more personal motivation.1
Ivins committed suicide in July 2008.
The FBI closed the case in 2010, concluding that Ivins was guilty.
What has all this to do with likelihoods?
In all, four postal workers at Brentwood had similar symptoms. Two were
correctly diagnosed. The doctors who misdiagnosed Morris and Curseen as having
a virus admitted later that they did not suspect anthrax until, too late, they had seen
the media reports of the other two cases [4].
Evidence, no matter how good, will not help you ﬁnd something if you’re not
looking for it. Doctors make diagnoses based on tests and experience. They use this
evidence to decide the illness from which their patient might be suffering, if any.
Sometimes a test is used to decide whether a patient has a speciﬁc illness or not,
sometimes to decide which of a number of possible illnesses. Whichever the proce-
dure the doctor must ﬁrst have identiﬁed that illness or those illnesses as a possible
cause of the patient’s symptoms. The doctors who ﬁrst saw the postal workers Morris
and Curseen were not expecting an outbreak of anthrax in Washington and so did not
consider it as a cause for the ﬂu-like symptoms of their patients.
Think back to the Stockholm police. They used eye-witness evidence to help
decide which of the two suspects, Stig or Jan, had committed the robbery. But
suppose Mats was the robber but was not on the police’s list of suspects. Ingrid’s
evidence won’t help ﬁnd him.
So here is the ﬁrst point to think about
First thought:
Evidence helps you decide between alternatives. Make sure you have
identiﬁed all alternatives.
1The whole sorry tale is told by David Williams [3].

Five Thoughts About Likelihoods

Mostly this will be easy. In a survey of voting intentions alternatives for the
percentage intending to vote for a particular party or proposition are all possible
values between 0 and 100. But sometimes life is not that simple, so just pause
before you move to the next step of ﬁnding likelihoods.
~ • ~
If you have to decide how many alternative explanations to use are there any
guidelines?
At one level, no. Make sure your set is as comprehensive as possible so that you
don’t miss anything. You could think of this as the creative phase of the analysis
where you can let your imagination be your guide. But the more alternatives, the
smaller the belief in any one of them. This may get out of hand.
It’s hard to think of any death that has given rise to so many conspiracy theories
as the assassination of President John F Kennedy in Dallas on 22 November 1963.
Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the murder. Two days later Oswald was being
led by police through the basement of the building in which he was being held to an
armoured car which would take him to the county jail. From the crowd of reporters
and assorted onlookers stepped a short man in a suit and a light coloured hat. In his
hand was a .38 revolver (Fig. 7.1). He shot and killed Oswald. The killer was Jack
Ruby, owner of a Dallas nightclub and a man with underworld connections. This
second murder, like the ﬁrst, was shown live on television.

How did Ruby ﬁt into this drama? More speculation which, for some, has never
been resolved. You can’t ask Ruby. He was convicted but appealed the verdict.
While awaiting a retrial he died of a pulmonary embolism due to lung cancer. It was
January 1967. What to make of it all? Despite the best efforts of the Warren
Commission and others the true explanation is still not clear and never will be.
Among the many who have written of these events is the novelist Norman
Mailer. It is easy enough to construct a hypothesis to explain Ruby’s involvement.
Perhaps the CIA had hired the Maﬁa to kill Fidel Castro and didn’t want Oswald to
go on trial in case this became public. Perhaps Kennedy got messages about this
from Chicago maﬁa boss Sam Giancana via Judith Exner Campbell, who was
friendly with both men. Giancana was alleged to have CIA connections. Is any of
this true? As Mailer wrote, “[an] hypothesis, no matter how uncomfortable or
bizarre on its ﬁrst presentation, will thrive or wither by its ability to explain the
facts available” [5]. These hypotheses (what Mailer, in another context, called
factoids [6]) paint the picture, one of many, about something which inevitably
must remain unknowable. The problem is that if there are precious few facts
(evidence) these hypotheses might just hang forever in the air until interest wanes.
Second thought:
The more alternatives you have the smaller the belief in each unless
the evidence sharply discriminates between them.
But not all alternatives may be as implausible as they ﬁrst seem.
~ • ~
In his 1955 book Fact, Fiction and Forecast the American philosopher Nelson
Goodman introduced the world to grue.
We have been used to think of emeralds as green. All the emeralds we have ever
seen have been green and so we expect that all emeralds we see in future will also be
green. Or they may be grue. If emeralds are grue they will have been green so far
but at some point in the future, say next Christmas Day, they will turn blue.
Figure 7.2 shows what might happen.
Fig. 7.2 Grue
56

Five Thoughts About Likelihoods

Goodman proposed this as “the new riddle of induction”. No past data nor any
we collect in the near future can be used as evidence to reject the idea that emeralds
are not green, they are grue. As you might expect, there has been much discussion
of this grue hypothesis: it seems implausible (to say the least) but where is the
rational argument for rejecting it? Is grue a philosophical device to illustrate that
some hypotheses are inadmissible, or are there are instances of its existence?
There are. Here are two.
The ﬁrst example comes from meteorology. Edward Lorenz was a meteorologist
who became interested in the unpredictable behaviour of complex non-linear
systems, what we now know as chaos theory. He gave a talk at the 139th meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science held in Washington,
D.C. in December 1972. The title of his talk was Predictability: Does the Flap of a
Butterﬂy’s Wings in Brazil Set a Tornado in Texas? The Butterﬂy Effect has joined
the Black Swan in the lexicon of science-ish metaphors (The now famous butterﬂy
in the title was actually introduced by the convener of the session, unable to reach
Lorenz at the time of the release of the programme [7]).
Lorenz’s main point was that the state of the weather system, and so the accuracy
of forecasts, can be affected by small, practically imperceptible, changes in some
initial conditions used by the forecasting models. You can easily see how this works
on your spreadsheet. We are interested in some quantity that varies through time. Its
value depends only on the previous value in a fairly simple way: take the previous
value, square it, multiply by 2 and subtract 1. How to begin? What is the initial
condition? Starting with a value of 0.5 all subsequent values are also 0.5. This
stable system is shown in Fig. 7.3.
Fig. 7.3 System behaviour. Initial condition 0.05
7
Five Thoughts About Likelihoods
57

But if the starting value is almost but not exactly 0.5 the system behaves quite
differently. After a stable period there is an abrupt switch to instability (Fig. 7.4).
Monitoring values up until, say, the twentieth time period provides no evidence
as to which of these two conditions (weather systems) we are experiencing, one that
is stable or one that is not.
This simple demonstration is possible because of how computers store numbers.
The repeated squaring in the model means that tiny differences in the starting value
are likely at some point to have an impact. Now, you may object that all this
illustration shows is the potential fragility of computer calculation; if you were
doing the calculation by hand it wouldn’t happen, you would use 0.5 in both cases.
Well, ok, but computer models do behave like that and so might complex systems.
Lorenz thought so.
The second example is from economics. The Phillips Curve is named for the
British economist AW Phillips. He used data from 1860 to 1957 for his 1958 paper
which showed a negative relation between inﬂation and unemployment. The impli-
cation for macroeconomic policy was that governments could adopt policies aimed
at reducing unemployment or reducing inﬂation but not both. But life was not so
simple and there was much discussion and research concerning which variables
were best to use, whether there is just one curve or many, whether the whole idea
made sense and so on. In 1991 FM Akeroyd proposed that the fate of Phillips’
Fig. 7.4 System behaviour. Initial condition almost 0.05
58
7
Five Thoughts About Likelihoods

original provided an example of grue-like behaviour [8]. Figure 7.5 shows the
argument.
The vertical axis shows change in inﬂation measured by the Consumer Price
Index and the horizontal axis shows unemployment. The solid line is a Phillips
curve ﬁtted to 1960s data after which the economic system behaved very differ-
ently, as shown by the dashed line. The change of behaviour is sharp. Akeroyd had
seen a grue-like switch.
These examples show that grue-like behaviour exists. It goes by many names —
discontinuity, paradigm shift, disruption and so on — but it is not, of course,
universal. Far from it. Most systems behave over time in fairly predictable patterns.
Assuming that models based, as they must be, on the past are reasonable guides for
the short to medium term future is useful. But the shadow of grue will not go away.
There may be a sharp switch. We have no way of knowing whether this will happen,

nor to what extent, nor what we might do except put in place some careful
monitoring and contingency planning.
But don’t panic. This does not mean that forecasting and planning are doomed to
failure, just that a careful modesty is appropriate. For the most part forecasts are
made and, as we have seen, a track record gives a basis for assessing how they
might be interpreted and used.
How does all this effect Bayes? The basic point, that it is impossible to construct
a likelihood distribution for the future, is clear and unanswerable. The best we can
do, and it is very often good enough, is to establish a track record and assume that
the future will be like the past.
Third thought:
It is not possible to give likelihoods for the future. It usually makes
sense to assume that the past is a decent guide to the future but be
aware of this extra assumption you are making.
~ • ~
Grue prompts another thought about likelihoods. Here is the application of Bayes
Rule. First, the likelihoods (Table 7.1) and then, once we have looked at lots of
emeralds and seen that all are green, use Bayes Grid for the analysis (Fig. 7.6).

Five Thoughts About Likelihoods

Given the evidence we are unable to differentiate between the alternatives green
and grue. We have to believe that both are equally likely because the likelihoods are
the same. It is not the values of likelihoods but that they are the same which makes it
impossible to use evidence to discriminate between alternatives.
You may, of course, be more sceptical about the plausibility or admissibility of
some alternative explanations. You could choose to decide either that alternatives
are plausible enough to be included in your analysis or they are so implausible that
you rule them out (grue? anthrax?). Perhaps, though, you would like some inter-
mediate option that enables you to give a weight to each alternative according to its
plausibility. Some people think this sharp practice. This is an important point that
we’ll look at later.
More familiar than grue is the “well, she would say that, wouldn’t she” problem.
Why would a suspect confess to a crime? Some do because of remorse or a
recognition of their inevitable conviction but otherwise what is the value of a
denial? Almost certainly, nothing.4 Table 7.2 shows the likelihoods.
Extreme differences in the diagnostic power of evidence are not uncommon. Just
how useful data are as evidence depends on how well they can help you discrim-
inate between alternatives.
Suppose that you wanted to know whether a message had been written in English
or French but that a system error meant that all you had was one letter retrieved
from the damaged email. How useful might that be? It could be decisive. If the letter
was accented — oˆ or e´ or a, for instance — you would know for certain that the
message was written in French. (French words such as cliche´ are also used in
English, but very infrequently.) You are not so fortunate but may still be able to

Table 7.2 Likelihoods for confession
4This analysis wouldn’t hold everywhere. In the United States the overwhelming majority of cases
never get to court. Most accused wish to avoid very harsh sentences and so plead guilty to a lesser
charge, of which they might be innocent. In The Atlantic of September 2017 Emily Yoffe reports
that 97% of federal cases are settled by these plea bargains and so never make it to the courtroom
[9].

make use of the different frequency of occurrence of letters in the two languages.
For example, Table 7.3 gives the frequencies of occurrence5 of the letters n, w, x
and f.
These are two likelihood distributions so Bayes Grid shows what you are
justiﬁed in believing. If an n is retrieved almost no discrimination is possible
(Fig. 7.7).
There is only the slightest of evidence in favour of English because the likeli-
hoods, 7.17 percent and 7.32 percent, are almost the same. The other three letters
occur much more frequently in one language than the other and so provide more

5The precise frequency of occurrence of letters in a language is not known and never can be, there
are just too many variables such as when the language is used, in what medium it is expressed, by
whom and for what purpose. There are many lists showing frequencies found by sampling texts
written in that language. The data used here are from Practical Cryptography. Letter frequencies
for various languages. http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/letter-frequencies-various-
languages/. Accessed 4 July 2017.

Five Thoughts About Likelihoods

discrimination, more useful evidence. Table 7.4 shows what happens if you use
Bayes Grid for each of the four letters.
The letter w is almost perfectly discriminating. If you retrieve w you are justiﬁed
in believing very strongly that the message was written in English.
Retrieving either x or f provides about the same not so strong evidence, x in
favour of French and f in favour of English. The odds are about 2:1.
Of course, you would want more evidence than just one letter. This example is to
illustrate how Bayes thinking can help you decide how to interpret the evidence in
just the same way as the sample of just two people illustrated the idea behind
margin of error in Chap. 6. To decide between texts you might look at the
occurrence of word pairs or triples (digrams or trigrams) or perhaps letter frequen-
cies in a sample of words. We’ll look at this again in Chapter 13.
Fourth thought:
Likelihoods help you discriminate between alternatives to the extent
they are different. Not all data provide useful evidence.
The likelihood ratio determines how discriminating is the evidence you have.
Should you also pay attention to the values of the likelihoods? Does it matter if the
evidence, however discriminating, shows you have seen the commonplace or the
unusual or the very rare? It depends on what you want to do with the information.
~ • ~
Interpreting differences in likelihoods when the probabilities are very low is always
likely to be tricky. This is especially true where changes in physical risks are
concerned. Margaret McCartney is a family doctor in Glasgow. In November
2006 she wrote a piece in the Financial Times headed “Lies, damn lies and medical
statistics”. Her point was that some statistics are unhelpful and some are useful.
More particularly, the way some statistics are presented and the way we perceive
them makes interpretation not straightforward. Those she did not like included that
taking one type of oral contraceptive pill increased the relative risk of a blood clot
three times. But that only meant that the risk went from 5 per 100,000 to 15 per
100,000.
Presumably, data had been collected and tabulated according to the presence or
absence of a blood clot and also whether or not a pill had been taken. The results can

be shown as likelihoods (Table 7.5) from which we get the Bayes Grid analysis
(Fig. 7.8).
Although the relative risk had trebled the absolute risk was still very small.
Which story to tell?
On the other hand, just because likelihoods are low does not mean they can be, or
should be, ignored. Think of how much money and effort is used to reduce the
already low risk of an aircraft collision. A judgement must be made which takes
account both of the likelihood and the severity of the consequences. Different
people will reach different conclusions.
Fifth thought:
Differences in likelihoods help you decide between alternatives but
don’t lose sight of just how likely the evidence is.
Juries consider even smaller likelihoods when dealing with DNA evidence. This
is not always straightforward, as we’ll see in Chapter 16.
~ • ~
In this ﬁrst section of the book we have seen the vital role of likelihoods in thinking
rationally about how to use evidence. But evidence collected in one situation may
be used in another. If this new context is different how can this difference be taken
into account? We now turn to that problem and see how a simple extension of
Bayes’ Rule will help.

Diagnosis
The chapters in the previous section showed how Bayes’ Rule uses likelihoods to
evaluate evidence and arrive at a justiﬁed belief in the alternative explanations for
what we see. There may be other contextual factors, not part of this evidence, which
we would like to include. Medical diagnosis is a good example. A doctor may want
to use both the results of some useful test together with what is known about a
particular patient or group of patients; some may be in a high risk group and some
not. In this chapter we will see how this might be done.
Data show how well a test result indicates the presence or absence of a condition
which, if present, may be improved by treatment. The risks of treatment, surgery
most obviously, might well be high but the risk of doing nothing may be higher.

About one in a thousand people in the UK suffer from some form of venous
thrombosis or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A blood clot forms and obstructs the
ﬂow of blood. This most often occurs in one of the deep veins of the leg. Doctors
and others working in emergency rooms need a quick method of assessing whether
a patient has DVT. Given pressures on budgets it would be helpful if such tests were
not too expensive.
In 2001 a team at the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydﬁl, in Wales,
evaluated three such diagnostic tests [1].
Venography is a procedure in which a dye is injected into the veins and an x-ray
image, a venogram, is made so that blood clots may be seen and a sure diagnosis
made. The team called this the “gold standard” procedure. But it requires the
infrastructure of a laboratory, lab technicians and the rest. It takes time to produce
a result. At the time of the study each test cost £30.
D-dimer refers to the small fragments of the protein ﬁbrin in the blood. Concen-
tration is measured in milligrams per litre of blood. Low values indicate a blood
clotting system operating as it should. Higher values indicate that all may not be
well. By using a reference level the test result is returned as being either negative,
low enough that no thrombosis is indicated, or positive. SimpliRED is one of
several commercially available testing products used for D-dimer analyses. The
team in Merthyr Tydﬁl were interested in this because it was quick (10 minutes),

cheap (£7), and could be used at the patient’s bedside. Just the thing for an emer-
gency department provided it was a good enough indicator of the presence or
absence of DVT.
To see whether it was good enough 187 patients with clinical symptoms indi-
cating the possibility of DVT had blood taken. Samples were analysed both by the
SimpliRED test and a venogram (the “gold standard”). The results were presented
as shown in Table 8.1.
This looks promising: 151 of the 187 results are the same for both tests.
SimpliRED may well be useful.
In the medical literature tables show the different test results as rows. In the
Bayes Grid, however, test results, the evidence, are the columns. Make that
switch here.
Because of the accuracy of the venogram its result can be taken as meaning that
DVT really is present or is not and so the data can be taken as showing the relation
between the SimpliRED result and the patient’s condition (Table 8.2).
Doctors want to know how accurate the test is and for this use two ideas:
speciﬁcity is the ability of the test correctly to identify healthy patients and
sensitivity is the ability of the test correctly to identify patients who are ill.
Of the 136 patients with no DVT the test correctly identiﬁed 113 and so
specificity ¼ 113=136 ¼ 83:1%:
51 patients had DVT of whom the test correctly identiﬁed 38 and so

sensitivity ¼ 38=51 ¼ 74:5%:
Speciﬁcity and sensitivity show how likely is a test result given that we know
whether the patient has DVT or not: they are Bayes likelihoods, as shown in
Table 8.3.
But the whole point of the test is that we do not know whether the patient has
DVT and so the doctor would like to know how well the test performs. To do this it
is customary to look at the data and see that
of 61 patients testing positive 38 (62.3%) had DVT,
and
of 126 patients testing negative 113 (89.7%) did not have DVT
which is just the same as rescaling the table of data (Table 8.2) so that the columns
sum to 100% (Table 8.4).
These two tables give different views of the data. The ﬁrst, showing speciﬁcity
and sensitivity, describes the characteristics of the test. The second shows the
predictive power of the test as used at the Prince Charles Hospital. These two
views use the same data. To see the link between them use the Bayes Grid.
~ • ~
The likelihoods are just the speciﬁcity and sensitivity so if the SimpliRED result
was positive the doctor should believe that the probability the patient has DVT is
82% (Fig. 8.1). But this is different from the 62.3% found above (Table 8.4).

If the test result was negative the probability that the patient does not have DVT
is 77% (Fig. 8.2), not the 89.7% of the earlier calculation.
Why these differences? Why does this Bayes analysis not give the same result as
that reported by the doctors?
Look at the likelihood distributions. Both rows sum to 100%. In the calculation
both are given equal weight. No differentiation is made between the number of
patients with DVT and those who don’t have DVT. But this is not what the data tell us.
Of the 187 patients in the experiment 51, only 27.3%, actually had DVT. This is
called the prevalence of the condition. Before using SimpliRED, or any other test,
the doctors at Merthyr Tydﬁl can reasonably believe that 27.3% of their patients,
about one in four, has DVT.
This belief is formed before and independently of the diagnostic test and has
several names, prior probabilities is used a lot. We shall call them base rates, which
is the name popular with psychologists. These base rates describe what we know of
the patient given a particular context: in this case that they are patients in the
emergency room at the Prince Charles Hospital and showing symptoms of DVT.
They are not necessarily typical of the wider population.
It is natural to want to use both the contextual information and the test result when
making a diagnosis and deciding treatment. Do this by weighting the likelihoods by
the base rates and then rescaling as before. Table 8.5 shows the calculation.

The result is just the same as found by the doctors in their original analysis.
Bringing in the base rates makes the difference. As Fig. 8.3 shows, Bayes Grid is
easily modiﬁed to incorporate this reasoning.
Setting out the Bayes model like this forces you to answer a series of useful
questions. Reading from left to right,
what are the alternatives?
what do you know already?
what evidence might you see?
what did you see?
what should you now believe?
This emphasizes that Bayes’ Rule is a framework for learning, for revising an
initial belief in the light of evidence:
belief is proportional to base rate  likelihood
This restatement of Bayes’ Rule is the one most used. The inclusion of base rates
greatly extends the scope and usefulness of Bayesian analysis, as we shall see.
In the case of a negative test result we are justiﬁed in believing that there is a
90% probability that all is well, the patient does not have DVT (Fig. 8.4).

There is still a 10% chance that the patient does have DVT, of course.

The ﬁrst Bayes calculation used only likelihoods. No use was made of base rates.
This is why the result differed from the doctors’ result. We can now see that this is
just a special case. Without any contextual information the likelihoods are weighted
equally which is equivalent to using equal base rates, 50:50 in this case (Fig. 8.5).
Using equal base rates describes what you ought initially to believe in the
absence of any background information. This is an important (if apparently obvi-
ous) idea to which we shall return
~ • ~
Setting out the problem in this way makes clear the different contributions of base
rate and likelihood in deciding what ought to be believed about a patient’s medical
condition given the result of a SimpliRED test.
The likelihoods describe the properties of the test, its sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

patient, but for patients with the same characteristics as the Welsh these likelihoods
hold whether the test is given for a patient in Merthyr Tydﬁl or New York or
Canberra.
The base rates describe just who is the patient; in a hospital in Wales, at a general
practitioner’s ofﬁce in Wisconsin or whatever. The doctors will want to ask not
simply
given this test result how likely is my patient to have DVT?
but
given this test result and given any other relevant information I have how
likely is my patient to have DVT?
The doctors in Merthyr Tydﬁl knew that 27.3% of their patients have DVT. This
is the base rate. Other factors may be relevant (Fig. 8.6).
If the patient is known to have a family history of blood clots and also does a lot
of long distance ﬂying, and is therefore inactive for long periods, that can in
principle be incorporated into the analysis provided data are to hand. Base Rates
help to do this.

Using Bayes Grid makes very clear the process and the reasoning behind that
process. An initially blank Grid asks questions and prompts you to enter all the
information needed for the application of Bayes’ Rule. The rescaling shows what
you should believe once one particular result is seen.
It is sometimes useful to use a different layout which shows the analysis in three
stages and for all test results. Figure 8.7 shows how.
For medical diagnoses the column sums at step 2 may themselves be of interest.
Even though sensitivity and speciﬁcity are quite high about one third of patients,
32.6%, will receive a positive test result. If you have ignored the prevalence, the
base rate, this will seem counterintuitive.
This test is given in an emergency room. Patients with a positive SimpliRED test
result will be referred for further investigation. A venogram will conﬁrm the
diagnosis of DVT for 62.3% of those referred. The others will be relieved to be
told that they don’t have DVT after all.
~ • ~
Having a clear structure helps make sense of data. Filling out the Bayes Grid forces
you to answer the necessary questions which you might otherwise overlook. In
thinking about tests such as the SimpliRED test it is easy to focus on sensitivity and
speciﬁcity and overlook prevalence, the base rate. We are all prone to this mistake
as the following simple experiment shows.
Some children are born with Down’s syndrome. There are tests which can be
given to pregnant women to see if their baby may suffer from this condition. A team

The serum test screens pregnant women for babies with Down’s syndrome. The test is a
very good one but not perfect. Roughly 1% of babies have Down’s syndrome. If the baby
has Down’s syndrome, there is a 90 per cent chance that the result will be positive. If the
baby is unaffected, there is still a 1% chance that the result will be positive. A pregnant
woman has been tested and the result is positive. What is the chance that her baby actually

The serum test screens pregnant women for babies with Down’s syndrome. The test is a

Of these 100 babies with Down’s syndrome, 90 will have a positive test result. Of the
remaining 9900 unaffected babies 99 will still have a positive test result. How many
pregnant women who have a positive result to the test actually have a baby with Down’s
syndrome?

The reframing of the scenario makes it an easier problem. All that is required is
to pick out the two numbers 90 and 99 and so get 90/(90+99) ¼ 48%.
But still only about a quarter of the sample got the right answer.

Diagnosis means deciding the condition of a patient who has gone to a doctor with
some symptoms and wants to know what, if anything, is wrong with them.
Screening is a precautionary mass program in which anybody may be tested
even though they exhibit no symptoms. Well, often not just anybody exactly. The
offer may be made only to people in high risk groups such as older people, for
instance.

What would happen if SimpliRED was used in a screening program for all
adults? The precision of the test as measured by sensitivity and speciﬁcity is
unaltered but the base rates change. In the UK about one person in every thousand
gets DVT each year. The Bayes’ Rule analysis with these base rates is shown in
Fig. 8.9.
Seventeen percent of those tested would receive a positive result and so would be
referred for a further test, a venogram. The overwhelming majority of these, 99.6%,
would be cleared. This is a much higher percentage than with the patients in the
Prince Charles Hospital because the prevalence of DVT in the population is much
less than in the hospital’s patients.
Should this screening program be adopted? No. Too many people would be
referred for tests which, for almost all of them, would be negative. They would be
worried while they were waiting for this second test. And then there’s the cost. The
prevalence of this condition is too low to justify the expenditure.
In contrast to this, in many countries it is common to screen women for breast
cancer by using an x-ray called a mammogram. If the mammogram indicates the
possible presence of a tumour the woman is referred for further investigation, a
second mammogram or a biopsy for instance. Practice varies in different countries
but it is usual to offer breast screening to women older than about forty. Methods

and procedures for interpreting results also vary. A recent study [3] in the US found
a sensitivity of 83% and a speciﬁcity of 92%. Prevalence in the US is about 12%.
Figure 8.10 shows what to expect from the screening.
About one in six women (17%) will be referred. Of these about 40% will be
found not to have breast cancer. You might think this surprisingly high if you have
in mind only the sensitivity and speciﬁcity values of about 80% and 90% and so
expect only about 10% of incorrect diagnoses. But this expectation is false: we have
ignored the base rate.
Of women referred about forty percent will be found not to have breast cancer. In
the time between screening and result they will have been concerned. This is
unavoidable given the accuracy of mammograms and, particularly, the prevalence
of the disease. Most women think this a price worth paying.

Information
Bayes’ Rule shows how we can use evidence to revise belief. Base rates describe
what we know before evidence is available. These probabilities are updated once
we have the evidence. It is natural to say that we have learned from the evidence.
The greater the difference between initial belief, described by the base rates, and
the revised belief the more information was provided by the evidence—the more
we have learned.
This idea, that we are informed to the extent that we change what we believe,
is nothing new. The economist (and statistician) John Maynard Keynes is
reported to have said “When my information changes, I alter my conclusions.
What do you do, sir?”
So just what is information?
~ • ~
Information is not the same as data. I hear the football results on the radio. My local
team when I was a boy, Millwall (currently in the third level of English football, as
so often they have been1), has won. I am pleasantly surprised. They had been
playing Shefﬁeld United, a good team who would go on to win the league, and I
thought Millwall would be lucky to draw, even though playing at home, at The
Den. Shortly afterwards I meet a friend. “I see your team won”, she says. I am not
surprised. I already knew they had. Both the radio and my friend brought the same
message, the same datum, that Millwall had won. My reactions were different
because of what I expected before receiving the message: in the ﬁrst case surprise,
in the second case no surprise at all. The radio broadcast had provided me with
information. My friend had not. We are surprised at messages according to how
unexpected is the news they bring. Figure 9.1 shows a model.

coming 20172018 season. This sometimes happens.

The horizontal axis shows the probability of the message before it is received,
in other words it shows what I expect the message to be. The vertical axis shows
how surprised I am when I get the message. Before I heard the radio I thought a
win unlikely (low probability) and so was very surprised at the result. After this I
knew the result (probability ¼ 1) and so was not surprised at all by what my friend
said.
Surprise has no natural units. Call it surprisal and measure it using a ratio scale.
Start with a surprisal of 1 when probability is ½. Flipping a coin is like this. The
coin is in one of two possible states, heads or tails, and so there are two possible
messages to report the result of the ﬂip: “heads” or “tails”. Both are equally likely.
This unit is called a bit, short for binary digit and probably more familiar as a
measure of the size of computer memory.
With two coins there are four possible states and messages. The probability of
each is halved to ¼ and surprisal increases by one unit to two bits. Every time
probability changes by a factor of two (halving or doubling) surprisal changes by a
factor of one.2 This type of scale is quite common in measuring our response to a
stimulus: decibels measure our response to sound intensity, changing by one each
time sound intensity changes by a factor of ten.
To see how this works look back at the DVT diagnosis of the previous chapter.
The base rate showed a prevalence of 27.3% and so before diagnosis the patient
would be more surprised to be told he had DVT (probability 0.273) than not
(probability 0.727). Figure 9.2 shows this.
Fig. 9.1 A model for surprise
2It is usual to write surprisal ¼ log2(probability). Since surprisal is used only to give relative
values other logarithms, to the base 10 or the base e, will do just as well if more convenient. To get
the measure in bits just divide by the logarithm of 2, for instance log(probability)/log(2) where
log(.) is the logarithm to any base.

Information

But by deﬁnition the more surprising result is the less likely. We can ﬁnd a
measure which takes account of both outcomes by calculating the expected sur-
prisal, the average of the two surprisals weighted by the probability that they
happen (Table 9.1)
This value, 0.85, is a measure of how surprised you would expect to be, on
average, to receive a perfectly accurate diagnosis. It measures what is known and
described in base rates before the evidence of the SimpliRed test is collected. This is
often called the information of the probability distribution. This use of the word
information might mislead unless we are alert. What is being measured is the
potential value of the message (the test result) and this depends on how likely we
think each result to be. A better name might be information potential or ignorance.
Because of a similarity with a concept in thermodynamics it is also called entropy.
Information is independent of the test result. For example, if it was already
known that the patient had DVT (probability ¼ 1) there would be no information to
be gained by the test. In just the same way if it was known for sure that the patient
did not have DVT (probability ¼ 0) there would also be no information to be found
from the test. Figure 9.3 shows how information varies with probability. The point
shows the information in base rates. The probability that a patient has DVT is 0.273
and so the information entropy is 0.85.

The base rate entropy is the same, of course, whether we choose to plot the
probability that the patient has DVT or the probability that there is no DVT
(Fig. 9.4).
Entropy measures only the amount of information, not what the signal tells us.
The two extremes, probability = 1 and probability = 0, describe certainty either
that the patient has DVT or does not. Information is zero: given certainty there is
nothing left to know. Whichever of these two perfect diagnoses was the result of the
test, the information in the base rates is unaffected, though the difference in test
results is important for patient and doctor.
The most uncertain base rates, the most ignorant we can be, is when the
probability of both events is the same, 0.5. Just as you would expect.
Table 9.2 shows base rate and diagnostic probabilities of the SimpliRed test

A negative test result reinforces the base rate belief that the patient is more likely
not to have DVT. The probability of DVT falls from 0.273 to 0.103 and the
information entropy also falls, from 0.85 to 0.48 (Fig. 9.5).
If the test result is positive the situation is different. Now the result has made the
presence of DVT more likely. The probability of DVT has increased from 0.273 to
0.623. Not only has there been a switch in the more likely condition but, because of
the characteristics of the test, uncertainty has increased, the probabilities are more
equal. Information entropy has increased too from 0.85 to 0.96 (Fig. 9.6).

Does this mean that because the test has made us less sure of whether or not the
patient has DVT it has not been useful? Well, yes and no. In terms of the
information measure uncertainty has increased. But doctor and patient are now
alerted that DVT is likely and so further testing would be beneﬁcial, a ﬁnding of
interest to both. The information measure indicates uncertainty. This has increased;
more evidence is now even more valuable.

Information Theory, of which the information measure is a necessary foundation, is
due to the mathematician and engineer Claude Shannon (Fig. 9.7). In the 1940s he
became concerned with the transmission of telegraph messages which, from our
contemporary view, were of limited capacity and error prone.
One person, the source, wants to send a message to another, the destination, but
cannot do so directly in face-to-face conversation and so must use some method,
some information channel, to do so. The message is ﬁrst encoded in a form suitable
for transmission; natural language for speaking, characters for texting, and so on.
But the channel may be imperfect or noisy so that the signal received is not the
same as the signal sent. Figure 9.8 shows Shannon’s model of information trans-
mission which is much used.

This was not a new problem.
After defeating Napoleon at Waterloo the Duke of Wellington was keen to send
a message to London telling of his victory. Among the methods that were available
in those days before electrical transmission was semaphore. Flag signals were sent
from one signaller to the next in a chain, frequently sited on hill tops, until the
destination was reached. The message sent by the jubilant victor was “Wellington
defeated Napoleon at Waterloo”. But clouds between signal posts meant that only
the ﬁrst two words were sent. Noisy clouds.
Here is a more familiar problem. You and I have arranged to meet and I am to
decide where and let you know. We have previously met in a local pub and also
sometimes in a newly opened bar called The Hub. I decide that the pub would be
better this time. The message I want to send is “See you in the pub”. But you are in
your car returning from a trip to London so I phone you and say, I like to be brief,
“See you in the pub”. That is the message. This gets encoded electronically into a
signal sent from my phone to yours. The transmission isn’t perfect. Your car goes
under a bridge just at the time my signal is being transmitted. When you stop for
petrol you check your phone and see that you have a message from me. You listen
and hear “See ?ou in t?? ?ub.” The ? shows where the phone signal is indistinct. The
ﬁrst two missing parts of words present no problem but you are still left with “See
you in the ?ub.” What does it mean, pub or Hub? You phone me. My phone is
switched off. Where have I chosen?
This was the sort of problem in which Shannon was interested. He needed a
measure of the effect of the noise in the transmission, the ?s, so that he could assess
the beneﬁts of new methods of noise reduction. If you have no other intuition about
my intention (equal base rates) you could treat this as a simple problem of making
an informed guess about a missing letter, p or h, in a piece of English text. In any
language some letters are more common than others. Figure 9.9 shows that in
English h appears more frequently than p. The probabilities of h and p are 0.0496
and 0.0205 and so the probability that I said h rather than p is 0.049/(0.049
+0.0205) ¼ 0.706. There is a 71% chance that I said “Hub” and not “pub”.

Information entropy is 0.87 (Fig. 9.10), which is high. You decide to go to the
Hub but not with much conﬁdence that you have made the right decision. There is a
twenty-nine percent chance that when you are at The Hub I’ll be waiting for you in
the pub.
It might be possible to decrease uncertainty and so decrease information (mean-
ing information potential, remember) by considering not just a single letter, a
monogram, but pairs of letters (a digram) starting with h and p, or trigrams or more.
Or you may have a strong feeling that, for instance, I have a preference for the
pub and so may want to incorporate that by using base rates.

Shannon was concerned to devise coding schemes to reduce the problems of noisy
communication and so needed some measure of performance. He wanted a measure
of how well alternative states or messages could be identiﬁed by the receiver.
Taking the usual mathematical approach he speciﬁed the properties he wished the
measure to have and then found the mathematical model which had those proper-
ties. The measure which satisﬁed these requirements was the same as the expected
surprisal.5
Shannon had his measure but couldn’t decide what to call it. To him it was
clearly the value of the information obtained by knowing which of a number of
possible messages had been sent given that the probability of each is known. A
snappier name was suggested to Shannon by the mathematician John von Neu-
mann. When Myron Tribus asked Shannon about his measure,
Shannon replied: “My greatest concern was what to call it. I thought of calling it ‘infor-
mation’, but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it ‘uncertainty’. When I
discussed it with John von Neumann, he had a better idea. Von Neumann told me, ‘You
should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the ﬁrst place your uncertainty function has been
used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place,
no one knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.’”
[1]
Other measures have been proposed6 but the Shannon entropy has such useful
properties that it is usually preferred.
~ • ~
Entropy measures only the amount of information, not its meaning. Shannon was
not concerned with what you did when you read a message, only that it was
transmitted accurately. He was trying to solve the engineering problem, what the
receiver did when the signal was decoded was not his concern, though this does not
mean that it is a trivial point.
In the early years of the twentieth century trafﬁc lights began to be used in some
American cities. One popular design was very simple. A pole was erected in the
centre of a crossroads. On the pole was a square box. On each side of the box were
two lenses, one red and one green. On two opposite faces the red was above the
green and on the other two the green was on top. Inside the box were two electric
bulbs, one for the four top lenses and one for the bottom four. The signal was
manually controlled so that when a trafﬁc policeman switched on the upper bulb the
red lenses on two opposite faces were illuminated and so were the green lenses on
the other faces. This signalled the trafﬁc on one road to stop and on the other
crossing road to go. Switching on the lower bulb signalled the ﬂowing trafﬁc to stop
5The now famous formula is Σi pilog( pi) where pi is the ith probability and the sum Σ is over all
probabilities.

index in industrial economics and known to ecologists as the Simpson Diversity Index proposed in

and the stopped trafﬁc to ﬂow. The system was easy and efﬁcient in transmitting the
signal from switch to bulb. The wiring and bulb worked reliably and so there was no
noise and signal transmission was perfect. But ten percent of drivers are
colourblind. While the signal they received was perfectly transmitted the message
they received might be dangerously wrong [3]. The trafﬁc lights used now show the
illuminated lens or LED display by both colour and position; red is always at the
top. There is some redundancy in using these two properties to show just one signal,
but there is a good reason.
~ • ~
Shannon knew nothing of surprisal. I started with that idea because I thought it
more intuitively appealing than Shannon’s formalism. Shannon published his work
in 19487 and it caused quite a stir. As well as the engineering implications there
were also more naturalistic interpretations, one of which was surprisal [6].
The model of a telegraphic system transmitting information, though imperfectly
because of noise, struck a chord particularly with psychologists. They saw a useful
analogy with the idea of the human brain as an imperfect transmitter of information
about the world—brain as information processor. What Shannon’s work offered
was a way of measuring information and so a base not just for theory building but
for experimentation.8
Measuring information transmitted was fundamental and simple enough, it is the
difference between what you believe before the message, the base rates, and what
you would expect to believe afterwards. To measure what you expect use the
average information entropy of each message weighted by how likely each is to
occur. The situation for the DVT analysis is shown in Table 9.3.

Information

Either of the two test results may appear with probabilities 0.67 and 0.33
(Fig. 8.7). The expected information entropy of the test is 0.64 bits. This is smaller
than the entropy of the base rates and so something is expected to be gained:
information will be transmitted by the test.
The amount of information transmitted is just the difference, 0.21 bits.
Think of this graphically too. Figure 9.11 shows the entropies of the base rates
and the two test results
The expected information contained in the test, 0.64 bits, is a reduction of 0.21
bits from the base (Fig. 9.12). This is often called the expected information gain.

This is a measure of how much information is expected of a test result. Here, as
in many cases, the test is set: we use a SimpliRed test. But what if we had to choose
between a number of ways of obtaining evidence; different tests, experiments, or
whatever? As well as practical considerations of time and money, some more
general idea of how much we might expect to learn might be useful too. One of
the reasons for collecting evidence is to be better informed, after all. More of this in
Chap. 17.
~ • ~
Of the many results of the application of information theoretic ideas by psycholo-
gists perhaps the best known is described in a paper by George Miller called The
Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two [8]. Miller had noted a recurring limit
in a number of stimulus-response experiments. Typically, a subject listened to two
sounds of different pitch which were given the labels one and two. Once these labels
had been learned the experiment continued with each sound being presented
randomly but with equal probability and the subject required to identify it as one
or two. With this small problem, identiﬁcation was usually perfect. Two equally
likely sounds is a one bit stimulus. With four sounds, a two bit stimulus, perfor-
mance was unaffected. With an eight sound stimulus, three bits, errors were seen.
Performance did not improve with more stimuli, of course. In other words, there
was a limit to the number of stimuli that could reliably be identiﬁed which,
averaging the ﬁndings over a number of studies of pitch, loudness and so on seemed
to be at about seven stimuli, 2.8 bits. Using the information theory model, the
number of stimuli is the input, the brain is an information channel, and the number
of correct identiﬁcations is the output. The limit is the channel capacity. The
generalised situation is summarised in Fig. 9.13.
Fig. 9.13 Humans have limited capacity
94

Information

There is much else, of course, for example
musicians with perfect pitch have a much higher channel capacity
capacity can be increased by adding dimensions to the stimuli, both shape and
position on a screen for example (remember those trafﬁc lights)
larger problems can be broken into smaller chunks which are within our
capacity, a process we would now call modularity
The work was supported by a grant from the Ofﬁce of Naval Research whose
interest in the efﬁcient display of information to pilots and others is obvious.
Miller also noted that the rating scales with which we have become increasingly
familiar (on a continuum of agree/disagree, like/dislike) are often no more than
seven point scales.
The point to emphasise here is that it was the ability to measure information
which made Miller’s synthesis possible and introduced the idea of channel capacity
to the study of mental processes.
~ • ~
By using evidence we hope to become better informed. Information theory provides
a framework for thinking about this process. Entropy is a way of keeping score, of
measuring how ignorant we are and so how much there is still to learn, if only we
can ﬁnd the evidence. With the simple problems used in this chapter it is easy
enough just to look at the probabilities to see directly how uncertain we are about
choosing between alternatives. For larger problems some summary measure is
helpful. Entropy is just such a measure.
The signal encoding and transmission model has been inﬂuential partly for
quantitative modelling, as with Miller, but also as a metaphor for how the mind
works. But perhaps this is too big a claim and, more modestly, we should be pleased
if the Bayesian point of view offers a description of the results of human reasoning
rather than a description of the reasoning process itself. This is a sometime hotly
disputed point to which we’ll return in Chap. 17.
These ideas about information give a context for considering Bayes’ Rule as a
process of learning, of using evidence to update an initial belief. It is to the character
of these initial beliefs which we now turn.

Chapter 10
Being Careful About Base Rates
We have seen that using a test for medical diagnosis requires that we distinguish
two quite distinct sources of information: the characteristics of the test and the
characteristics of the patient. Test characteristics are measured by likelihoods found
by testing and experiment. Patient characteristics are found from data which
describe the prevalence of a condition in the population and described as base
rates. These are brought together in Bayes’ Rule
belief is proportional to base rate  likelihood
The calculation was easy. Base rates were found from patient data. A great many
cases are just like this.
But what if a doctor wanted to apply the SimpliRED test in a population in which
the proportion of patients with DVT was unknown? She wants to know how well
the test would predict DVT and so needs base rates. She could in theory make a
survey to get some data but there is neither time nor money to do that. She has a
number of options. Here are three
ignorance means that base rates can’t be given so just use likelihoods
ﬁnd another similar population and use those base rates
make a judgement based on professional experience
The third option is explicitly based on judgement, but so are the other two. Just
using likelihoods means that each is equally weighted, implying that half of the
population has DVT. However improbable, this is the judgement implied when base
rates are not given. The second option, using base rates from a different population,
means that the two populations are thought sufﬁciently alike to make the analogy
worthwhile; another judgement.
Bayes’ Rule enables the revision of initial judgement (the base rates) based on
data (the evidence). It is to emphasise this judgemental aspect that the revised
probabilities in Bayes Grid are labelled belief.
The idea that judgement plays a part in the interpretation of evidence is hardly
controversial, but for some people expressing that judgement as base rates certainly
is controversial. Why is this?

It is an oddity of probability that while there is agreement about how to make
calculations with probabilities there exists no such universal agreement about what
probability is and therefore what legitimately may be described using it. Here are
three snapshots from the development of thinking about probability.
In the seventeenth century the French philosopher Blaise Pascal gave an argu-
ment aimed at advising agnostics whether or not they should act as if God exists.
(The act as if is bracingly pragmatic.) The eternal outcomes, heaven or hell, must be
weighed against how life is lived, sober rectitude or the enjoyment of more earthly
pleasures. The decision depends on how good or bad these outcomes are thought to
be but also, critically, on whether or not God is believed to exist. For the believer
the probability that God exists is a hundred percent and for an atheist it is zero. Both
are certain. Their decisions are easy, though living the life may not be. For an
agnostic this probability has some intermediate value depending on the strength of
doubt felt. Probability is a measure of belief.
This argument was published posthumously in 1670 and is known as Pascal’s
Wager [1], the earliest example of what we now call decision theory. Both prob-
ability and an assessment of outcomes were important in the decision. In language
more familiar to readers of the Financial Times, “Pascal wagered God existed
because fruitless belief was a better downside risk than damnation.”1
Time passes. It is the nineteenth century and the dominant mode of scientiﬁc
argument is experiment. To ﬁnd whether one strain of rice is more productive than
another just plant both and measure the difference. To ﬁnd the intentions of voters,
ask them. Importantly for us, it is natural that the proportion found having a
particular value is also the best estimate of the probability of any one rice ﬁeld or
voter has that value. If, in a sample, thirty percent of voters have said they will vote
for a particular party then the probability that any one of them will vote that way is
also thirty percent. In this view probability is the limiting value of a survey
proportion. There is no room here for belief: data are all. The only justiﬁable
estimate of probability comes from the relative frequency with which results
occur in an experiment or survey. Those holding this view are frequently called
frequentists.
In some important problems there are no data, or not many—R&D spending or
most jury decisions, for instance—and yet decisions must be made. Recognising
this, methods and models were developed which made use of the probabilities of
chancy events and allowed some of these probabilities to be based on judgement.
The shift was very much towards providing a formal decision aid for those having
to make a decision. The title of Robert Schlaifer’s 1959 book—Probability and
Statistics for Business Decisions, An introduction to managerial economics under
uncertainty—shows the intent. Schlaifer writes that “probability will depend on
“judgement” in the sense that two reasonable men may well assign different values”
[2]. Bayes’ Rule ﬁtted into this way of thinking with base rates found from either
data or judgement as needed.

Being Careful About Base Rates

And so we come full circle, from theology to management, from belief to
judgement. The name changes with context, but the problem does not. The life
story of probability can be told in a number of ways [3], but this sketch will do
for now.
Probability is a measure of uncertainty; that is common ground. But uncertainty
about what? The Bayesian approach is essentially a method for learning, for
reducing uncertainty. Start with an initial set of beliefs in the relative truth of
competing propositions, alternative models or explanations of what we see. Then
evidence modiﬁes those beliefs by means of likelihoods and Bayes’ Rule. The main
reservation that people have concerns the idea of belief and its use via base rates.
And yet it seems quite reasonable that context which cannot be described with data,
as prevalence can, should nonetheless be taken into account. For example, you are
playing poker and your opponent deals himself a sequence of winning hands. You
suspect that he is a cheat rather than just lucky. Would it help to know that your
opponent was the Archbishop of Canterbury?2 The legitimacy of describing
judgemental information of this sort using probabilities lies at the heart of the
difference between frequentists and Bayesians.
~ • ~
Bayes’ Rule rests on two components: likelihoods based on data and base rates
which may be based on judgement. It is important to emphasise that Bayes’ Rule
does not depend on judgemental base rates. None of the previous chapters have
done so. But because Bayes’ Rule has the ﬂexibility to accommodate both judge-
ment and data it has sometimes been presented as synonymous with this subjective
approach. This is not so.
It is perfectly possible, as we have seen, to use Bayesian methods without relying
on subjective or personal probabilities. We may choose to use base rates based on
data. And yet if Bayes’ Rule is about updating belief it does seem fairly obvious that
these beliefs are our beliefs—yours or mine—and necessarily personal. We may
both decide to use the same data for our base rates, as the doctors did, and so have
the same base rates, but that is more a point of practice than philosophy. So why are
some people sceptical about judgemental base rates?
Two of the grounds for this scepticism are, ﬁrst, that subjective base rates may be
chosen to ensure a desired result (cheating) and, second, that in any case humans are
poor at making the necessary judgements.
Cheating is nothing new in the presentation of apparently valid analysis of data.
Here are two well-known examples.
Sir Cyril Burt, an educational psychologist, claimed that IQ testing was a
legitimate way of deciding the educational futures of eleven year old children.
The justiﬁcation was that IQ was largely inherited and so ﬁxed. This claim rested on
a study of twins who had been separated at birth and raised apart from each other.
2This example is usually attributed to Keynes [4].
10
Being Careful About Base Rates
99

Some critics were not persuaded. Among other things Burt claimed to have had two
female assistants, Margaret Howard and J. Conway, but these have never been
found and were almost certainly invented. It seems that he had invented the data
too. He was a fraud. His reputation has never recovered.
In 1982 two McKinsey management consultants, Tom Peters and Bob Water-
man, published a book In Search of Excellence. Their claim was that they had
identiﬁed excellent companies and the characteristics that made them excellent.
The book was a best seller. There was always some scepticism about their meth-
odology and when a number of these excellent companies fairly quickly ran into
trouble this scepticism grew. Eventually, in 2001, Peters admitted “This is pretty
small beer, but for what it’s worth, okay, I confess: We faked the data” [5]. Unlike
Burt, this appears to have had no effect on the reputations and careers of Peters or
Waterman, which you may think curious and perhaps indicative of the needs of
their respective audiences—psychologists and managers.
While neither case involved the subjective assessment of probabilities, you can
see why some people are a little careful about accepting the claims of experts.
~ • ~
Cheating is rare and is (usually?) discovered eventually. But what about that second
reservation, that we aren’t much good at thinking about probabilities? This is a
more substantial and much studied claim. But before we move on, here is a question
Steve lives in the USA and has been chosen at random from a list of registered voters. Here
is the view of a former neighbour: “Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful, but
with little interest in people, or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul with a need for
order and structure, and a passion for detail.” Steve works as one of the following: a baker, a
salesperson in a store, a commercial pilot, a librarian, a pharmacist. What do you think
Steve does for a living?
Don’t read on until you have answered the question.
~ • ~
This problem is a version of one posed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in a
famous paper [6] which looked at the way we make judgements and the problems
that can arise when we try to use probabilities.
What did you decide? The most common response is that Steve is most likely a
librarian because the characteristics described by the former neighbour are thought
to be stereotypical of librarians. Pharmacists too, perhaps. The point is that although
you may or may not have picked librarian as Steve’s job your thought process is
likely to have been similar: look at the description of Steve and decide which
100
10
Being Careful About Base Rates

occupation best ﬁts. What you were very unlikely to have done is to think about the
information contained in the ﬁrst sentence.
The way in which Steve was chosen is independent of the characteristics as seen
by the neighbour. Even with no knowledge of the data it should be clear that there
are a great many more people in retail sales than work as librarians. And yet this is
usually ignored. We like the personal, the story-telling, and pay attention to that
rather than all that boring stuff about sampling. We latch on to the personal
description and see that this ﬁts our preconception of librarians more than others.
Tversky and Kahneman called this the representativeness heuristic, one of many
they identiﬁed. Reasoning in this way leads to wrong, ill-justiﬁed decisions.
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics gives data for employment at May 2014
(Table 10.1).
Whatever you think of librarians this is where you should start. Without knowing
anything about Steve’s character there is an eighty-eight percent chance that Steve
works in retail and only a 3% chance that Steve is a librarian. The odds are almost
30:1. These are the base rates.
Using the Bayes Grid should help (Fig. 10.1).

To believe that Steve is a librarian you would have to believe that Steve’s
characteristics as described by the neighbour are at least thirty times more common
among librarians than among salespeople. Perhaps you do, but see how some Bayes
thinking helps us ask the right questions (about base rates in this case). Without any
data about the different personal characteristics of librarians, bakers and the rest we
can go no further.
(In the original Steve was “he”; Steve short for Steven. Or, now, Stephanie?
Would it have altered your decision?)

We are none of us immune from these biases.
If you were asked to give as a base rate probability, the proportion of the
population with a particular illness, how would you do this without access to
data? You would probably use some mix of recollection and analogy. If you or
someone close to you had this illness, or if this illness was prominent in news or
social media, there is a good chance that you would think it more prevalent in the
population than it really is. This is called the availability heuristic.

probably don’t. When we look at the price of £14.99 the ﬁrst thing that we see,
the ﬁrst thing that registers, is the 14. Then we see the 99 and our perception of the
price increases from £14, but almost certainly not enough to conclude that the price
is, for all practical purposes, £15. This two stage process is called the anchoring and
adjustment heuristic. In this case £14 is the anchor value from which an (inade-
quate) adjustment is made. The result is a biased judgement.
This effect is quite general. For example, the answers given to a question in a
questionnaire can depend on whether the previous question required an answer
which was a big number or a small number.

These difﬁculties in the way we selectively retrieve information was just what
Tversky and Kahneman were bothered about.
~ • ~
Tversky and Kahneman’s paper gave rise to a huge body of work3 about the way
people actually reason rather than how rational models, Bayes’ Rule among them,
recommend they should. Their point was not just that in reasoning about problems
involving some uncertainty we might get the wrong answer, sometimes a probabil-
ity too big and sometimes too small, but that we are likely to make biased estimates
and so consistently ﬁnd probabilities which are either too big or too small. Bias is
systematic and so you may think that it can be eliminated, by training for instance.
This may be optimistic.
Economists realised that this was a useful idea and that economies were made of
people and their non-optimal decisions rather than the perfectly informed utility
maximisers of much economic theory. And so behavioural economics was born
with due recognition paid to Tversky and Kahneman, both psychologists. Tversky
died in 1996. In 2002 Kahneman shared the Nobel Prize in economics.
The Tversky and Kahneman heuristics have been inﬂuential in the elicitation of
probability distributions for Bayes base rates and more generally, though some have
proposed alternative explanations for our undoubtedly imperfect performance [9].
~ • ~
Having raised these reasons to be careful let’s have a look at the sorts of methods
used to get probability assessments from judgements.
Expressing judgements as probability distributions has a fairly long history and,
now, a good set of practices for elicitation [10, 11]. Most often it is the opinion of
subject experts which is used, or is written up in papers, anyway. This leaves open
the question of who counts as an expert and this is usually taken to be someone
knowledgeable in the ﬁeld, such as an ecologist or a forensic scientist. But just
because someone has subject expertise does not imply they have expertise in
making probabilistic judgements. In some cases, a trial jury is an obvious example,
those needing to make a judgement, the jurors, may not even claim subject speciﬁc
expertise. Whatever the qualiﬁcations and experience of the person whose judge-
ment is sought it seems best to be cautious.
But what questions to ask? For the doctor having to decide the prevalence of
DVT only one judgement is needed: the percentage of the population with the
condition. In cases where more probabilities are needed a scoring system can be
used. For example, ﬁrst rank the alternatives from most likely to least likely. Then
give a score of 100 to the most likely and judge a score for the next most likely.
Repeat for all alternatives. Finally, rescale to give a base rate probability
distribution.
3There is much to read. Kahneman [7] and Kahneman et al. [8] are two good places to start.

This direct method is not always what you want. Suppose that we need a
judgemental base rate distribution for a continuous variable, one that can take any
one of an inﬁnite number of values, such as the voting intentions in Scotland.
Clearly it makes no sense to ask for lots of individual probabilities such as “what do
you think is the probability that 43.1% will vote for independence?” and then “what
do you think is the probability that 43.2% will vote for independence?” and so
on. But it does make sense to ask questions such as “what is the probability that no
more than 40% will vote for independence?”. This is a cumulative probability, the
probability that the vote is not more than a given value.
People answering this sort of question are also likely to agree that their base rate
distribution should follow a smooth curve, one which can be ﬁtted to a set of
judgements. The result will not in general perfectly reﬂect the judgements given
because there will have been a smoothing in the ﬁtting process and, in any case,
judgements are by their nature likely to be inconsistent to some extent. Knowing
where the modelled result and the judgement seem most out of line can indicate this
inconsistency and raise the possibility of revision.
Elicitation is used not just for base rates in a Bayes model but any time there is
uncertainty about the inputs to a calculation, a proﬁt forecast for instance, or some
other sort of risk analysis [12, 13]. The methods used are the same. Here are two
examples.
~ • ~
Governments are concerned about the risk of outbreaks of disease in animals. The
effects on farmers and on food supply can be severe, whole herds of livestock may
be killed and burned to prevent the spread of disease. Following the 2001 outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs (Defra) set up a consultation exercise to help decide a better way of
managing future outbreaks. Part of this was a study to assess the risk of those
outbreaks. A group of veterinarians and economists nominated by Defra were
brought together in a series of elicitation workshops [14]. In the ﬁrst workshop
there was a general discussion of the problem and of the idea of elicitation. While
some judgements are made by individuals, in a great many cases where responsi-
bility is shared a consensus view can often be developed. The workshops aided that
process.
For each of eight speciﬁc diseases an estimate of the likely cost was made based
on of the cost and frequency of major and minor outbreaks of the disease. The four
parameters for which experts’ judgement was needed were
the average interval between outbreaks
the probability that an outbreak is a major outbreak
the average cost of a minor outbreak
the average cost of a major outbreak
104
10
Being Careful About Base Rates

To illustrate the elicitation we’ll look at the judgements made of the probability
that an outbreak is a major outbreak for just one disease, classical swine fever, also
called hog cholera, a highly contagious disease of pigs.
For each of the four parameters the experts, as a group, had ﬁrst to decide a value
that divided the range of outcomes into two equally likely intervals and then
similarly to divide each of those intervals. The result was three values deﬁning
four equally likely intervals. This form of elicitation was attractive because decid-
ing the three values required no familiarity with probability, the word need never be
used, but the results gave points of cumulative probability: a probability of twenty-
ﬁve percent that the parameter is less than the lowest value, a probability of ﬁfty
percent that the parameter is less than the middle value, and a probability of
seventy-ﬁve percent that it is less than the highest value.
Kahneman and Tversky’s anchoring and adjustment heuristic should give pause
for thought. It is likely that the second and third judgements will use the ﬁrst, the
middle of the distribution, as an anchor and so the spread between the two extreme
values will be too close, describing a more precise estimate than is intended or
justiﬁed. In addition, it is well known that experts tend to be overconﬁdent, which
also has the effect of compressing the probability distribution.
To counteract any overconﬁdence, before they gave their three judgements the
experts were asked to think about a likely range, extreme values, of the probability
distribution. These extremes should have a useful anchoring effect.
Having completed the preliminary thinking about extremes the experts judged
the three values to be sixty percent, seventy-ﬁve percent and eighty-ﬁve percent.
These are shown as the three dots on the graph in Fig. 10.2.
Fig. 10.2 Judgements of cumulative probability and best-ﬁt model
10

A Beta distribution, just like that used in Chap. 6, was ﬁtted to the three points.4
The solid line in the graph is found from the Beta distribution. The ﬁt is good.
Figure 10.3 shows the Beta distribution in more familiar form
This is the model which best ﬁts the three points and so is satisfactory in that
sense. But do the experts agree that it is an adequate description, that it reﬂects what
they think across the range? To test this they were presented with probabilities
found from the model, predictions of their judgement. For instance, using this Beta
distribution there is a chance of ﬁve percent that the probability that an outbreak
will be a major outbreak is no more than forty percent. Does this seem right? Using
this form of feedback gives the experts the opportunity to revise or augment their
judgements. A new model can be ﬁtted.
The main stages of elicitation—setting the context, discussing the problem,
making the judgements, ﬁtting a model, checking and revising—are pretty standard
but there are, of course, variations in implementation, as the next example shows.
~ • ~
Anthony O’Hagan describes a task he used as part of an introductory session to
familiarise subject experts with the idea of elicitation [15]. The task, an everyday
sort of problem needing no special expertise, was to estimate the distance between
two cities, Birmingham and Newcastle upon Tyne.
The experts were asked to give the extremes, the highest and lowest values for
the distance between the two cities. Not only did this ﬁx minds on extremes and so,
it was hoped, mitigate the effects of overconﬁdence, but it also provided a ﬁxed
range which was needed to ﬁt the probability model that was to be used (the Beta
distribution, again).
Fig. 10.3 Best-ﬁt model of expert judgement
4The Beta distribution has two parameters. Values were found which minimised the sum of the
squared differences between the three cumulative probabilities given by the experts and the
corresponding values found from the Beta model.
106
10
Being Careful About Base Rates

Next, a central value was given. In the Defra case this was the value which
divided the range into two equally likely parts. This is called the median and is often
used as a measure of average. O’Hagan asked the experts for their most likely
estimate, the peak of the probability distribution. This is the mode, another measure
of average.
Having ﬁxed the range, between 165 and 250 miles, and the mode, 190 miles, the
experts were asked to give ﬁve probabilities such as “what is the probability that the
distance is less than 205 miles”. The distances were chosen to avoid the need for
very small probabilities, which are hard to judge. The questions were presented in
“a jumbled sequence to avoid problems of anchoring”. The Beta curve was then
ﬁtted (Fig. 10.4).
Judging extreme values, ranges or limits, is one of the more difﬁcult tasks and so
O’Hagan used a procedure he called “stepping back”. Looking at the ﬁtted distri-
bution he decided whether a wider interval might be justiﬁed and, if so, the lower
bound is made lower and the higher bound is made higher according to adjustments
O’Hagan devised. No other judgements are changed and the Beta model is reﬁtted.
The same idea would be used to narrow the range if that seemed as if it might help.
Looking at the ﬁtted distribution (Fig. 10.4) he thought the left hand (lower) tail
ended rather abruptly and that this might plausibly have been a result of a too
narrow range. The stepping back adjustments were made. In Fig. 10.5 the solid line
shows the reﬁtted model and the dashed line the original.
Fig. 10.4 Best-ﬁt model of judgements of distance
10
Being Careful About Base Rates
107

The result seems to justify O’Hagan’s intuition with more probability now
located in the left hand tail.5 The experts accepted this second model of their
judgement of the distance between Birmingham and Newcastle upon Tyne.
The true distance is 209 miles.
~ • ~
One of the concerns addressed in these two examples is that when expressing
judgements we have a tendency to overconﬁdence (other biases too, of course).
Getting people to think ﬁrst about extremes uses the anchoring and adjustment
heuristic to compensate for this.
A more formal response to the problem was proposed by the physicist Edwin Jaynes
[17]. The basic idea is simple: keep the probability distribution as ﬂat as possible
consistent with anything you know, or judge that you know. For example, if all you
know is the range—from zero to one hundred percent, say—then use a ﬂat distribution
with all probabilities equal. If, in addition, you know the average then change the equal
probabilities as little as possible to give a skewed distribution with the required average.
In other words, keep the distribution as ﬂat as possible consistent with what you know.
As we saw in the previous chapter entropy is at a maximum when probabilities
are equal. Jaynes formulated an optimisation problem: choose the probability
distribution which maximises entropy subject only to those constraints which
describe what you know. This avoids any suspicion of bias.
This is the maximum entropy, maxEnt, methodology [18]. Think of maxEnt
distributions as minimally biased or minimally informative. maxEnt methods are
used to derive probability distributions useful in themselves and also sometimes as
part of Bayesian analysis. The motivating idea—keep base rate probability distri-
butions as ﬂat as possible—is worth bearing in mind whether or not you use the
maxEnt mathematics.

et al. [16].

Being Careful About Base Rates

We have assumed that judgements are best made by experts, by which we mean
experts in their own ﬁelds such as the Defra veterinarians. Subject experts are fairly
easy to ﬁnd, by their jobs usually. But their expertise may not extend to thinking
about uncertainty and probability.
Sometimes it is possible to evaluate directly how good an expert is at making
probability judgements. For example, in some countries weather forecasters make
probabilistic forecasts, such as that there is a sixty percent chance of rain tomorrow.
If the forecaster is good at this (well calibrated) it should be the case that the track
record shows that on sixty percent of the occasions this forecast was made it did
indeed rain. This calibration is possible only if forecasts are made sufﬁciently
frequently to establish a track record, as is the case with some weather forecasters
[19], investors [20] and others.
But these circumstances are rare. Most subject experts are not asked to give
probabilistic judgements, certainly not sufﬁciently often to provide a track record or
to encourage improvement via feedback.
And, in any case, judgements have to be made by people other than subject
experts. A trial may hear from experts but the decision is made by a jury who, as we
saw in Chap. 2, are no better at thinking about probabilities than the rest of
us. Elicitation is not just for experts.
~ • ~
Four-term U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed that “Everyone is
entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts”. It should be obvious by now
how Bayes’ Rule might have helped the Senator. In this chapter we have seen some
of the problems that make being explicit about judgement difﬁcult and how by
being careful about the questions asked it is nevertheless possible to elicit useful
probability estimates. To ask in what sense they are true estimates begs a few
difﬁcult questions, and so we say useful: those whose judgements are elicited agree
that a fair representation has been made of their view and we, who are doing the
eliciting, have tried our very best to avoid the effects of bias.
But some people are still a bit nervous about expressing their judgements as base
rate probabilities. There are two points to make. First, when evidence is highly
discriminatory between alternatives, survey data based on a large sample, for
instance, differences in base rates can be swamped by the evidence. Even people
with quite different views, and so quite different judgemental base rates, will be
driven to practically the same beliefs by the evidence, as we shall see in Chap. 14.
This would have reassured the Senator.
Second, it is usually easier for us to react to a numerical estimate rather than
provide the number ourselves. When thinking about whether Steve was a librarian
or worked in sales it was almost certainly easier to think about whether Steve’s
characteristics were or were not thirty times more common among librarians than to
give an initial judgement. In Chap. 13 we’ll see how two statisticians used uniform
base rates as a way of not expressing an opinion on a matter unfamiliar to them, but
then found it easy to make a decision once they saw the results of their analysis.

There may, of course, be times when the evidence is more equivocal so that your
judgement is correspondingly more important. That is why there are arguments.

Chapter 11
Independence
The idea of statistical independence has cropped up once or twice already. It is such
an important idea that it deserves a chapter for itself.
In Chap. 6 we saw that by assuming that the voting intentions of our two Scots,
Alex and Nicola, were statistically independent it was easy to calculate their joint
response by simple multiplication—like ﬂipping two coins. This is a great model-
ling convenience and an important assumption in much statistical analysis. The
calculations are so much easier. Without independence it would have been neces-
sary to describe the relations between the voting intentions of Alex and Nicola and
between all pairs of voters. This would be difﬁcult. Independence means that
knowing how Alex intended to vote gave us no information about what Nicola
intended to do. We didn’t have to worry about the relation between them because
we assumed there was none. Independence was a good thing.
But not always. In Chap. 8 the hospital doctors in Merthyr Tydﬁl used the
SimpliRed test to see if a patient might have DVT. Diagnostic tests only work if
there is a relation between the test result and the patient’s medical condition—are
they ill or not. If the result of the test is independent of the patient’s condition then
the test can provide no useful diagnostic information. Independence would be a bad
thing.
Being aware of independence and its likely effect is an important part of thinking
statistically and of thinking with Bayes. Many times we ﬁnd neither perfect
independence nor its opposite, perfect correlation, but understanding these two
extremes and how they might occur is a good place to start. Since this issue is so
prevalent more or less any topic could be used for illustration. Two are used here.
First, forecasting, to show what happens when several estimates (sources of evi-
dence) are available for the same task. Second, evidence in a jury trial, to show how
two or more apparently different pieces of evidence may be misused.

In Chap. 4 we looked at the track record of IMF forecasts of the GDP of Japan. Lots
of organisations make such forecasts; governments, banks, research institutes and
others. In the UK The Treasury publishes each month Forecasts for the UK
economy: a comparison of independent forecasts which gives the latest one year
ahead forecasts from a number of City institutions, mostly banks, and also non-City
consultancies, universities and the like.1
All forecasters use pretty much the same data but they make different judge-
ments and use different econometric models. It would be surprising if their fore-
casts bore no relation to each other and also if they were identical. There will be
some correlation and this raises two questions: how do we recognise independence
and correlation, and what should we do?
To illustrate, consider forecasts made by two banks, Goldman Sachs and HSBC.
As in Chap. 4 we are interested only in whether GDP will increase or decrease in the
coming year, not by how much. Speciﬁcally, how well do forecasts made at year
end predict what happens over the next twelve months. To do this compare the
one year ahead forecast with outturn.
Figure 11.1 shows UK GDP and forecasts made for 1998 and the next
twelve years.
The performance of Goldman Sachs (GSachs) and HSBC look similar. But
before we look at their track records let’s be clear exactly what is meant by
independence and its opposite, perfect correlation.
Each bank forecast ﬁve times that GDP would increase and seven times each
forecast a decrease. Does that mean that they performed identically and that using
either would be as good as using both? Perhaps, perhaps not. What we know of the
two forecasters considered separately is shown in Table 11.1.

Independence

The row totals summarise the twelve HSBC forecasts and the column totals the
twelve Goldman Sachs forecasts. But did the two banks make the same directional
forecast each year or did they make different forecasts that just happened to be the
same in aggregate—ﬁve increases and seven decreases? What would the two
extremes look like?
In Table 11.2 see what happens if the forecasts that UK GDP would increase or
decrease were always the same for both banks.
The forecasts are perfectly correlated. Once we know what HSBC forecast we
can predict perfectly what Goldman Sachs will forecast, and vice versa. This is
what perfect correlation means. The likelihood distributions describe this depen-
dency (Table 11.3).
With no knowledge of the HSBC forecast the best estimate of what Goldman
Sachs will forecast is to use its track record. Five of the twelve forecasts, forty-two
percent, predicted an increase. This is the likelihood that Goldman Sachs will
forecast an increase. But if we already know what HSBC forecast the likelihood
is either a hundred per cent or zero for the Goldman Sachs forecast. The HSBC

forecast contains perfect information about the Goldman Sachs forecast (and vice
versa, of course).
At the other extreme, if the two forecasts were independent the HSBC forecast
would contain no information about the Goldman Sachs forecast. The likelihoods
would be the same (Table 11.4).
HSBC forecast an increase ﬁve times so we would expect forty-two percent of
these ﬁve forecasts, two in round ﬁgures, to be for an increase (Table 11.5).
To calculate this distribution of all four joint forecasts in the table just knowing
how many times each bank forecast an increase and a decrease is enough. The
assumption of independence and simple multiplication does the rest.

What really happened? In the twelve years from 1998 UK GDP increased six times

These track records are different, though not by much. The two forecasters differ
only in two years (Table 11.8).
It seems reasonable tentatively to conclude that Goldman Sachs is unlikely to
give forecasts which are much different from those of HSBC. But whatever the
correlation between forecasts (sources of evidence) how can their joint effect be
modelled?
As we have done before, the track records can be shown as likelihoods though
noting, with due caution, that the percentages are based on only twelve values.
(Tables 11.9 and 11.10).
We want a forecast that combines those provided by HSBC and by Goldman
Sachs. It seems reasonable to assume their forecasts are not independent and that it
would be a mistake to treat them as if they were. But how big a mistake? If both

banks forecast a decrease and we assumed independence we would simply multiply
the likelihoods. We have no strong views of our own, and so equal base rate
probabilities (Fig. 11.2).
(This is a different and stripped-down version of the Bayes Grid. Only the
likelihoods needed for this analysis are shown. You should know all about rescaling
by now.)
Believe that there is a ninety-four percent probability that GDP will decrease in
the coming year.
Multiplying likelihoods is justiﬁed by the assumption of independence, though
we are sceptical that this is justiﬁable. Without independence we need to describe
the effects of the correlation somehow. A straightforwardly direct approach in this
case is to look at all four possible combinations of the two forecasts (Table 11.11).
On the four occasions when both banks predicted an increase there was an
increase. On ﬁve of the six occasions when both forecast a decrease there was a
decrease. Likelihoods for all four possibilities are shown in Table 11.12.
If both HSBC and Goldman Sachs forecast a decrease we should believe with
probability eighty-three percent that that is what will happen (Fig. 11.3).

Independence

The assumption of independence, however convenient, gives an unjustiﬁably
high probability that GDP will decrease; ninety-four percent rather than eighty-
three percent. This is general: unjustiﬁed assumptions of independence lead to an
overvaluation of the evidence.
Treating correlation problems is typically quite a bit more difﬁcult than this, but
these calculations work for small problems. This illustration is not meant to be a
primer on forecasting but to make clear why correlated sources might be problem-
atic and to give an idea of the issues involved in assessing their effect.
~ • ~
Independence makes analysis much easier, though it may sometimes be that
analytical convenience wins over what can be justiﬁed by the data. For this reason
Bayes methods which make this assumption are sometimes called naı¨ve Bayes
methods. The assumption can always be checked by comparing what we see in the
data with what we would expect to see given the assumption of independence,
provided that the track record is available.2
Without independence the interactions have to be explicitly estimated and this is
likely to need more data. The illustration was based on twelve annual forecasts, not
many but possibly hard to increase. Taking more years is open to the objection that
circumstances and models have changed so much that an extended time span
provides only a false guide. On the other hand, taking more data within the time
span—quarterly, for example—presents its own problems. The forecasters may not
give forecasts that frequently, or perhaps at different times.
Having so few data means that estimating the frequency of rare events is
particularly difﬁcult. Although it is certainly true that in none of the six years
when GDP decreased did HSBC forecast an increase can we be sure that it never
would? Spreading the data over eight categories rather than four increases the
problem. Although this is an illustration it uses real data. This point about increas-
ing the demands on available data is quite general. Estimating the degree to which

evidence from different sources are correlated and the effects of that correlation is
likely to need more data and extended analysis, which itself often involves a few
simplifying assumptions.
~ • ~
Wrongly assuming that different sources of evidence are independent can lead to
biased results: the evidence will seem to be more discriminatory than it is. The same
problem might affect the relation between evidence and base rates.
In medical diagnosis the likelihoods of evidence describe what we know about a
test based on experimental results and base rates describe what we know about the
patient based on factors other than those measured by the test (age, gender,
occupation. . .) and how this affects the chance of having an illness. Both evidence
and base rates are found from data but the data are quite different and so may
reasonably be treated as independent.
This is not always so. For the GDP forecasts the likelihoods used with evidence
come from the track records of the forecaster. They are data based, like the likeli-
hoods used to assess the evidence provided by a medical test. But there are
differences. There are no controlled experiments with an economy (we all hope)
and so data on which to base a track record are naturally limited and might not
easily be increased. A drug company can increase the sample, an economist will
ﬁnd this much harder.
If the base rates are an expression of judgement where did that judgement come
from? Perhaps you are a professional economist and so have been trained in the same
way of thinking as the economists responsible for the forecasts. You all probably read
the same journals and newspapers and websites. And unless you have been freakishly
diligent you will not have kept a track record of your own base rate estimates. This
makes ﬁnding the correlation between base rates and evidence difﬁcult. A safety ﬁrst
approach is to have no view and so modestly use equal base rates as above. A
variation on this is to have these equal non-judgemental base rates and then, after
the analysis of the evidence, judge whether you feel so strongly that a different
conclusion is for you. If you felt that your base rates might plausibly be greater than
eighty-three percent in favour of an increase then decide that rather than the decrease
indicated by the evidence of the banks’ forecasts alone. That’s what we did with Steve
(Fig. 10.1) and we’ll see another example of this in Chap. 13.
Forecasts based on judgement rather than mathematical models present similar
problems. Human judgement is fallible, of course, but if we have a track record it
may still be of use, as with Lawro’s football forecasts.
~ • ~
Statistical independence, our concern here, is not the same as other sorts of
independence. An economic forecaster may be labelled as independent meaning
that its funding and policy are independent of the government, but the forecasts
provided by both are not necessarily statistically independent, they may be highly
correlated, as were the forecasts of our two banks.

11
Independence

The problem is more difﬁcult if evidence is judgemental. In ﬁnancial markets
shared views sometimes drive investment in strange directions, from the tulip
mania of the seventeenth century to the dot-com bubble at the end of the last
century to, perhaps, current valuations of some Silicon Valley startups.
The wisdom of the crowd? Market sentiment? A reassuring consensus among
experts? It might all be nonsense, of course, ampliﬁed by the positive feedback of
conversation, journalism, websites and the rest. Perhaps just herd instinct, the fear
of not being one of the crowd.
It is unlikely that any one of us is immune.
Even with these reservations there is evidence for a simple approach. It was the
observation of the statistician Sir Francis Galton that the average of the estimates of
the weight of an ox made by people at a country fair in 1906 was within one percent
of the true weight. This was the original crowd wisdom.
Taking a simple average is appealing and likely to work well for many problems,
particularly forecasting problems.3 All methods have some bias depending on
methodology and data. Taking the average of about ﬁve forecasts seems to smooth
these biases and give a better forecast that just one method.
The correlation question is always there.
At the extreme we may hear the same from a number of experts, however
deﬁned. Treating them as independent sources will ultimately lead to convergence
to near certainty. But if all are just repeating the same received view this certainty
may be an illusion. The Bayes method allows for this provided we have the data to
establish track record, which we may not.
Suppose some economic forecaster always produced exactly the same forecasts
as Goldman Sachs. Perhaps Goldman Sachs is held in such high esteem that others
simply repeat its forecast. Or they may all, Goldman Sachs included, be very
inﬂuenced by the World Bank. As a result it is never the case that one forecasts
an increase and one a decrease. This other forecaster adds nothing to what Goldman
Sachs tells us. It is a clone. The likelihoods will show this (Table 11.13).
Third or fourth or ﬁfth forecasters would also add nothing if they too are clones.
The difference between a possibly false convergence and a number of forecasts
which are effectively clones can be large after only a few forecasts. Here is what
happens. Based only Goldman Sachs’ forecast and track record believe that there is
an eighty percent probability that GDP will increase (Fig. 11.4).

If all other forecasts are from clones and we treat them as such (perfect
correlation) the forecast will not change. If, on the other hand, a second forecast
from a clone is treated as independent there will be a change (Fig. 11.5).
The probability of an increase rises sharply. More such forecasts only make it
seem all but inevitable that GDP will rise. But if the other forecasters are clones
what they say has no effect (Fig. 11.6).
Identical, or very similar, forecasts may be due to this clone-like behaviour or
the same coincidence might indicate consensus. Forecasts made using different
methods might give very similar results because the system (the economy in this
case) is so constrained that its trajectory is largely predetermined, at least in the near
future. Look at the forecasts of HSBC and Goldman Sachs. In this case treating the

Failure to recognise independence, or to see it when it isn’t there, can have serious
consequences. Perhaps the most worrying possibility is in the conduct of jury trials.
Juanita Brooks lived in the San Pedro district of Los Angeles. On a June day in
1964 she was robbed of her purse. Based on descriptions provided by Ms. Brooks
and John Bass, an eye witness, the police arrested Janet and Malcolm Collins. In
court the prosecution produced as evidence the probability that any couple, chosen
at random, possessed the characteristics given by Brooks and Bass (Table 11.14).
Janet and Malcolm Collins did.
The prosecutor, Ray Sinetar, called Daniel Martinez of the nearby California
State University at Long Beach. Given these probabilities and that the character-
istics were independent Martinez correctly testiﬁed that by simple multiplication it
followed that there was a probability of just 1 in 12 million of these six character-
istics being seen together. Sinetar presented this as strong evidence of guilt. Janet
and Malcolm Collins were convicted.
This case is infamous for a number of reasons [2, 3], not least that the six
probabilities were given by Sinetar as likely typical values. In other words, he
guessed. (Did a quarter of all men wear a moustache? It was the sixties and it was
California, but still. . .). What we need to think about here is the assumption of
independence, also proposed by Sinetar. Most obviously, the probability that a man
with a beard also has a moustache is surely higher than the probability that a man
with no beard has a moustache. Taking Sinetar’s estimates at face value means that
twenty-ﬁve percent of men had a moustache and ten percent had a beard. Show
these as row and column totals, as we did with the banks (Table 11.15).

What if Sinetar was right, that wearing a beard and wearing a moustache are
independent? In that case just ten percent of the twenty-ﬁve percent of men with a
moustache also had a beard, two and a half percent of all men (Table 11.16).
On the other hand, it seems plausible to believe that the overwhelming majority
of men with a beard also had a moustache. At the extreme assume that all bearded
men have a moustache, the proportion of bearded men with no moustache is zero
(Table 11.17).
In this case the probability that a man has a moustache and a beard is ten percent,
four times the two and a half percent if independence is assumed. The probability of
one in 12 million given by Sinetar is reduced by a quarter to one in three million.
Still a low probability but not as low. Even if we admit that a small number of men
wore a Dutch style of beard (ear to ear via the chin) with no moustache this is
unlikely to change the higher estimate much.
You can probably see other possible dependencies which would increase the
probability even more. Janet and Malcolm Collins may not be that extraordinary
after all. Identifying them as guilty looks less convincing. The effect of indepen-
dence, real or assumed, is, once again, to increase the diagnostic power of the
evidence.

Independence

Using evidence from a number of sources is easier if these sources are statistically
independent, or if they are assumed to be. Just multiply the likelihoods. If the
sources are not independent the calculations are more difﬁcult. The convenient
assumption simpliﬁes calculation but can lead to quite large errors.
Building a mathematical model, or any sort of model, requires judgement about
which simpliﬁcations are justiﬁed and which are not. This is an important skill.
Deciding to assume that two or more sources of evidence are independent even
though we know, from theory or from data, that they are not is one such judgement.
Sometimes the simpliﬁed model is good enough. The results justify the simpliﬁca-
tion. Here is an example.
Classiﬁcation is an old problem. The ancient Greeks, and before them the
Chinese and the Aztecs, saw the usefulness of grouping similar plants into classes.
There are fewer groups than there are plants so the reduction in variety helped to
make sense of the world as they saw it. Classiﬁcation is still useful for this same
reason. With the much increased availability of data and of the computing power
for analysis all sorts of objects are classiﬁed. In one sense, of course, all this book is
about classiﬁcation, about deciding which alternative is the most likely and acting
upon it—DVT or not, choose another door or stick, and so on.
Classifying documents is increasingly useful.
Words are everywhere; in tweets and emails, in news stories and hotel reviews,
in online tutorials and books. Call any such document a text.
Many people have an interest in using words and patterns of words to decide a
classiﬁcation. For example, librarians ﬁnd it useful to classify books and other
documents as an aid to retrieval in answer to a query. This sort of categorisation is
based on what a text is. A related, and more difﬁcult, problem is to decide what a
text says; are your emails indicating a favourable view of a particular product, or
perhaps they can be used to ﬁnd out which way the political wind is blowing [4].
There are many other applications, from market intelligence to national security,
details of which are, for obvious reasons, secret.
This problem, deciding feelings rather than topic, is called sentiment analysis.
New methods for making these classiﬁcations are being developed all the time. Just
about the simplest is the Naı¨ve Bayes Classiﬁer. The basic idea is that the relative
frequencies with which certain words or groups of words (generically called
features) indicate the sentiment being communicated. For a Bayesian analysis
these data give likelihoods of feature occurrence for texts conveying alternative
sentiments; happy/sad, Democrat/Republican and so on. This requires a set of texts
(the training set) which are already classiﬁed by human assessors or by some other
means. Once this is done the likelihoods can be found and used to classify new texts
using the method shown in the Bayes Grid. But how to combine the evidence, the
different features, none or many of which may appear in any text? Make the
simplifying (hence “Naı¨ve”) assumption of independence, that the occurrence of
“love” is independent of the occurrence of “delight”, that “Trump” is independent
of “Republican”. This gives a simple model relying only on likelihoods for each
feature and then multiplication. The text is put into the most likely category, the
category for which the belief probability is highest.

An illustration is provided by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee of Cornell University and
Shivakumar Vaithyanathan of IBM [5]. Their task was to categorise movie reviews
as either positive or negative. The training set was 752 negative reviews and 1301
positive reviews taken from the archive of the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
After some experimentation these seven words were used as evidence of a positive
review
love, wonderful, best, great, superb, still, beautiful
and for a negative review these ﬁve words and two symbols
bad, worst, stupid, waste, boring, ?, !
It may not be immediately obvious why some are included, but think about it:
“Still, though, it was worth seeing” or “What was the director thinking about?”
Three methods of classiﬁcation were used with eight versions of the test data. All
three methods gave accurate classiﬁcation in about eighty percent of cases, the
differences in accuracy being no more than one or two percentage points. The Naı¨ve
Bayes Classiﬁer was easily the simplest of the three and by no means the worst
performer.
Naı¨ve Bayes Classiﬁers are easy to implement and quick to execute. One reason
for their success may be that the values of the probabilities for each category are
used only to ﬁnd the largest, sufﬁcient for the categorisation, rather than the values
themselves. Correlation between the word pairs may not have much effect on which
is the largest probability, whatever its effect on the value.
Because it gives probabilities, which most other classiﬁcation methods do not, it
would be possible to have a threshold value to prevent classiﬁcation when the
maximum probability is low. When sifting very big data sets the need for quick and
automatic classiﬁcation is likely to make this unfeasible, or perhaps commercially
undesirable: “not sure” doesn’t sound too helpful when targeting some advertising.
We have seen that assuming independence increases apparent certainty which
reinforces this possibility of overconﬁdent classiﬁcation.
Notwithstanding these reservations, Naı¨ve Bayes Classiﬁers have been particu-
larly successful in information retrieval and less so, but still respectably good, in
categorisation generally. Their success probably depends on the complexity of the
data: the simpler the better [6]. It seems that even when there is strong dependence
between word pairs or other attributes this classiﬁer still performs well [7].
~ • ~
I feel professionally obliged to point out, in a phrase much used by stats teachers,
that correlation does not equal causation. Just because we see that there is a
pattern—that big values of something consistently co-occur with big (or small)
values of something else—does not mean that variation in one causes variation in
the other. The most famous example is probably the apparent relation between
storks and babies. Why else all those “welcome to your new baby” cards with the
new arrival dangling rather precariously from the large beak of the helpful bird?
Here is a graph which seems to support the folk tale (Fig. 11.7).
124
11
Independence

The points show the human birth rate and the number of breeding pairs of storks
in sixteen European countries and Turkey [8]. Looks good? But storks cannot be
responsible for human births, can they? A quick web search will be entertaining.
~ • ~
Correlated sources are most likely when there is functional dependency or when
different organisations or individuals use similar mental or mathematical models
and so arrive at similar conclusions. Evaluating the information contained in them
all taken together should ideally recognise their joint occurrence. The success of the
Naı¨ve Bayes Classiﬁer shows that sometimes assuming independence can give a
useful result. This is not a general conclusion; context is all. For classiﬁcation the
assumption can be justiﬁed by results. For evidence in a jury trial making the wrong
assumption can be a matter of life and death, or something close to it.
Statistical independence, or the lack of it, is important. Bayesian analysis can
take account of non-independence, though it may complicate the calculations.

Review
The cases in the ﬁrst section, the ﬁrst six chapters, used only likelihoods; no base
rates. Now that we know about base rates we need to revisit those cases to see what
effect contextual or judgmental inputs might have had. What did we miss by
adopting this simple Bayes approach?
That is looking back. Looking forward, the next and ﬁnal section shows how
Bayes thinking has been used to help in a number of different cases. Some of these
applications need more complicated models of likelihood than we have seen so far.
The principles that are used to structure the problems will be familiar but the
mathematics will need more than simple rescaling. Discussing the details of these
methods is not my purpose. I want to show how the interplay between alternatives,
evidence, likelihoods and base rates can help in difﬁcult situations. For each case
you’ll have references that will enable you to ﬁnd out more if you wish. However,
you might ﬁnd it helpful to have just a sketch of the ideas underlying some of these
more advanced calculations. This is given at the end of this chapter.
But ﬁrst, the review of earlier cases. Would base rates have helped?

Our two Swedish policemen, Larsson and Mankell, had Ingrid’s identiﬁcation of
the colour of the thief’s car as blue and a chart showing the likelihoods that she
would say the car was blue (Stig’s car) or green (Jan’s car). That was all. They used
only that evidence. They did not make use of any other information or intuition
about who was the more likely to be guilty, a case of equal base rates (Fig. 12.1).

Are these equal base rates always the right way to go? What about the brilliantly
intuitive detective we see in all those crime shows? Well, perhaps this is what
happens. But probably not. The more likely is that some other evidence is available.
For instance, an eyewitness brieﬂy sees the face of the thief as he tears off his ski
mask before jumping into the (blue or green) car. Stig and Jan are about the same
age and ethnicity so Larsson and Mankell know this is a long shot. In any case,
eyewitness identiﬁcation isn’t that reliable [1]. Still, they decide to see if their
witness will pick either a photograph of Jan or one of Stig.
From what they know Larsson and Mankell believe that there is not much more
than a 50:50 chance that the eyewitness can pick the right man: say sixty percent.
The witness could pick Stig even though Jan is guilty, or vice versa, or perhaps
neither. The detectives think these identiﬁcations about equally likely. Table 12.1
shows the likelihoods.
The witness is shown the two photographs and asked if either is the man that ran
from the shop. The police are in luck. Their witness points to the picture of Stig;
“That’s him”. This is useful evidence (Fig. 12.2).
Larsson and Mankell can reasonably believe there is a seventy-ﬁve percent
chance that Stig is their man. When, next, they hear Ingrid’s evidence they use
what they have learned from the eyewitness as their base rates (Fig. 12.3).

Review

Base rates describe what we believe before evaluating new evidence: they
encode judgement and other evidence seen up to that point. Setting out the police
investigation as two distinct stages emphasises this.
It can be helpful to think of evidence in this way, following the time line of the
police enquiries. But because we consider the different pieces of evidence to be
statistically independent the ordering has no effect on the result. From a purely
computational point of view all evidence can be considered in one calculation,
either with the eyewitness identiﬁcation ﬁrst (Fig. 12.4) or with Ingrid’s car colour
evidence ﬁrst (Fig. 12.5).
The order is irrelevant.
The order in which evidence is given in court could also be irrelevant but is more
likely to be decided by lawyers so as to present their arguments most forcefully.

Of the three alternative match results—away win, home win and draw—Lawro
forecasts an away win. We should believe that this is the most likely result,

(The base rates sum to 99, I know, but let’s choose easy presentation.)
What would be the argument for different base rates? What information might
you have? If you are a football fan you’ll certainly have a view (judgement may not
exactly be the right word) and so will your friends and so will the newspapers, tv
shows and the rest you all watch and read. The problem here is independence.
Statistical independence, that is.
We looked at this in the previous chapter and saw how to deal with two pieces of
evidence which were not independent, provided we had data which enabled the
dependency to be described. We would also want evidence to be independent of
base rates for the simple multiplication of the two to be justiﬁed, and this might be
tricky here.
Best stick with equal base rates but enjoy the arguments with your friends.

Chapter 5 showed how thinking about likelihoods could help a game show contes-
tant, Craig, decide which door to open—yellow or blue or green. The whole point of
this example was that although it was agreed that at the start of the game all three
doors were equally likely to be the way to the prize those equal probabilities should
be revised once one of the doors has been opened.
Were those initial base rates justiﬁed?
Yes, they were.
Craig may have had a preference for one colour over the others—perhaps blue
was his favourite colour—and this inﬂuenced his decision but this is irrelevant. He
had no reason to believe that the prize was more likely to be behind one door than
another. Perhaps there were people who studied the show and thought they could
detect a bias, that the prize was most often behind the yellow door, but this is more
evidence of obsession (a game show nerd) than expertise. Equal value base rates are
justiﬁed.

The ﬁnal case was the opinion survey for the Scottish referendum (Chap. 6). In the
YouGov poll forty-three percent of the 864 respondents said “Yes”, they would
vote for independence. The analysis used only the Binomial likelihoods and the

survey data. We now know to interpret this as equal valued base rates, which in this
case means a ﬂat uniform distribution (Fig. 12.7).
The arrow shows the learning, from the ﬂat base (all values equally likely) to the
revised distribution showing what we are justiﬁed in believing given the poll result.
But we may have had an opinion, a judgement, of the strength of feeling in
favour of independence. We may be pro-independence and believe that support for
a Yes vote is over ﬁfty percent, say “around sixty percent”. With the methods
described in Chap. 10 this judgement can be expressed as a Beta distribution. Using
this as our base rate gives a new analysis1 (Fig. 12.8).

1Using a Beta distribution in this way is convenient and quite common. The distribution has two
parameters, ALPHA and BETA. For the uniform (ﬂat) base distribution ALPHA ¼ 1 and BETA ¼ 1. For
the illustrative judgemental distribution, “about 60%”, ALPHA ¼ 30 and BETA ¼ 20.
To revise given the survey data add the number of Yes respondents to ALPHA and the number of
No respondents to BETA. There were 372 who answered Yes (43% of 864) and 492 No. The revised
parameters are
ALPHA ¼ 30 + 372 ¼ 402 and
BETA ¼ 20 + 492 ¼ 512.

The result is not much different from that found using ﬂat base rates. With a ﬂat
base distribution the ninety-ﬁve percent conﬁdence interval was from 40% to 46%.
With the pro-independence judgemental base this changed to 41% to 47%. The
estimate is a little higher. This can be seen from comparing the two ranges. The
average has increased half a point from 43.5% to 44%. This is to be expected. Our
judgement was “about 60%” and combining that with the YouGov result, “about
43%”, has increased the estimate.
But the effect is very small because the data overwhelm the judgement, as you
would expect. The spread of either base distribution is much bigger than that of the
YouGov result. The larger the sample the more pronounced is this effect. This means
that with non-trivial survey data different initial judgements will be revised to move
closer. While pro-independence and anti-independence camps may have different
views about all sorts of issues which might inﬂuence the vote, if and when it comes,
they should pretty much agree on what conclusions to draw from this survey.
This is especially important when contentious issues are at stake, as they are
here. The message “Your judgement is swamped by the data: trust me, I’m a
statistician”, might not be well received. The Bayesian approach allows different
opinions to be included in the analysis and their effects seen. The transparency of
this process is of value (especially in these anti-elite anti-expert times).
Ecology is another area in which strong views are held. More in Chap. 14.

And let us not forget grue. If you believe that the idea of grue is preposterous as a
possible colour of emeralds then your base rate will be zero. You are certain grue is
not the correct alternative and so when you see a green emerald you believe, as you
always did, that emeralds are green (Fig. 12.9).

Before moving on to look at more applications, a word about complex models and
their solution.
In the cases we have looked at so far the base rate and likelihood distributions
have been simple enough so that you could see how the calculations were done,
though you had to take my word for ﬁnding probabilities from the Beta distribution.
Sometimes the mathematical form of the likelihood function is such that there
exists no analytical solution; there is no formula, simple or otherwise, for the

answer. For example, in Chap. 14 we will look at a model with ten parameters, not
the one or two we’ve seen so far. This is complex enough that a conveniently simple
analytical approach is not possible. In these situations Monte Carlo simulation often
helps.
As the name implies, the basic mechanism is as simple as spinning a roulette
wheel. A standard wheel has pockets numbered from 0 to 36. Gambling aside, each
spin of the wheel can be seen as a way of generating one of these 37 values. Each
value is equally likely to be chosen; the wheel isn’t ﬁxed. If I wanted to pick, at
random and so without bias, a day in March I could just spin the wheel. If the ball
landed in a pocket labelled 0 or 32 or above I would disregard that spin and try again
until I got a number between 1 and 31. That would be my randomly chosen day.
There are other ways of choosing random numbers: ﬂipping a coin, rolling a die,
choosing a card and so on. This isn’t how lottery winners are picked, you may be
relieved to know. In the UK the ﬁrst machine for this purpose was called ERNIE, the
Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment (the acronym came ﬁrst, don’t you
think?). ERNIE was invented by one of the Bletchley Park code breakers in 1956.
The necessary randomness was provided by the behaviour of electrons in neon tubes.
Your spreadsheet almost certainly has a random number generator. This is a
piece of software, not a physical device. Numbers generated by computers are only
pseudo-random. They are generated by computer code and so cannot be genuinely
random, but for all practical purposes they behave enough like true random
numbers to be good enough. An updated ERNIE still uses physical randomness.
It may seem odd that numbers chosen at random can be used for calculating the
probabilities we need, but it works. Here’s how.
Figure 12.10 shows a curve, a Beta distribution just like those used with the
YouGov poll. In this case the probabilities (areas under the curve) can be found fairly
easily, but suppose they could not and that we wanted to know the probability that
less than 20% of respondents said that they would vote Yes. Monte Carlo helps. What
we need is the proportion of the area under the curve to the left of the vertical line.

First pick a random number from 0 to 100. You pick 80. This is the value on the
horizontal axis. Pick another number, you get 60. This is the number on the vertical
axis. These two random numbers deﬁne the point labelled A. This point is not under
the curve and so of no use, just as a value of 34 from a spin of a roulette wheel
would be no use in picking a day in March. Discard it and try again.
This time we get the numbers 50 and 40, point B. This is under the curve so keep
that result.
Try again and get 10 and 20. This is point C, under the curve and also in our
target area to the left of the line.
Keep going. Using a computer means you can generate lots of points. When you
have all the results the ratio of the number of points under the curve and to the left of
the line to the total number of points under the curve is the answer you want—the
probability that no more than twenty percent of voters say they will vote Yes.
This curve is smooth but clearly this Monte Carlo method would have worked
just as well with a jagged curve or any other arbitrary shape. This is why it is so
useful and much used in the solution of more complex Bayesian applications.

but sometimes the alternatives are a little more complex. For example, Antonio
Pievatolo and Fabrizio Rugeri were concerned about the reliability of doors on
underground trains [2]. Doors can fail in a number of ways—electrical, mechanical,
pneumatic and so on. Analysis will be correspondingly detailed.
Reliability studies use time between failures as an important measure of perfor-
mance. To ﬁnd the average time between failures based on the evidence of a single
failure time of 326 days use the Bayes Grid (Fig. 12.11).

The likelihood distributions will give the probability of a failure time of 326 days
if the average is, for example, 451.3 days. Considering the evidence of more failures
it seems reasonable to assume independence; just multiply the likelihoods.
However, Pievatolo and Rugeri decided that the durability of train doors was a
function not just of time but also of distance travelled by the train. With two
variables to be estimated the model looks a little different. With only one variable,
average time, the Bayes Grid analysis was, diagrammatically, two dimensional
(Fig. 12.12) but now, with two variables, the Monte Carlo sampling space is three
dimensional (Fig. 12.13).
Instead of a simple curve describing our estimate of one parameter—average time
or proportion of respondents—we have a three dimensional surface (Fig. 12.14).

This two-variable probability distribution may have a convenient form which
makes it easy to ﬁnd probabilities but, if not, Monte Carlo simulation comes to the
rescue again. This time, instead of picking two random numbers to ﬁnd points in a
square that contains a curve we need three random numbers to deﬁne a point in a
cube that contains a surface. The process is otherwise the same.
This means we can answer two sorts of question. First, the volume under the
surface between any given limits will give answers to questions such as “what is the
probability that the average time is less than 500 days and the average distance
travelled between 1000 and 1500 km?” This is the three dimensional version of the
earlier two dimensional example.
Second, each randomly chosen point can be projected on to the left hand wall and
on to the back wall of the cube. These two simple two dimensional curves, for
average distance and average time respectively, mean that we can answer questions
about each of the two variables on their own—“what is the probability that the
average time is less than 400 days”, for instance. This is important. The three
(or more) dimensional surface shows the probability of the co-occurrence of different
values of the variables but we frequently want to make probability statements about
the individual variables, most often by giving an interval estimate of their value,
similar to the estimate of the proportion of Yes replies in Chap. 6. This is a common
use of Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian analysis, as we shall see in Chap. 12.
If you decide to read around you’ll see that the particular method often used is
called the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.2 There are increasingly a
number of books which describe the necessary computations [4] and software is
freely available, notably the winBugs software from The Medical Research Council
Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University.3 The descriptions are, by necessity,
quite technical. This outline will be enough for Chaps. 14 and 15 in the next section:

Chapter 13
Who Wrote That?
It is Monday 13 April in the year 1778. London. The wit, lexicographer and essayist
Dr. Samuel Johnson is at dinner at Mr. Langton’s house. With him, as he always is,
is his friend and biographer James Boswell. Also there are Dr. Porteus, Bishop of
Chester, and Dr. Stinton, a chaplain. The talk turns to the question of style, ﬁrst in
painting but then the styles of different authors and whether or not every writer had
a distinctive style. The Bishop thought not but Johnson disagreed saying “Why, Sir,
I think every man whatever has a peculiar style, which may be discovered by nice
examination and comparison with others: but a man must write a great deal to make
his style obviously discernible.”1
And he was right.

The correct attribution of written works has long been of interest. Aristotle, in the
Poetics, discusses which works published under Homer’s name might really have
been written by him (Aristotle thought the Iliad and Odyssey) [1]. More systematic
study only began to be feasible with the availability of texts in collections, such as
at the great library at Alexandria which was established in the third century BC.
Over the centuries analyses of style began to be supplemented by some numerical
measures, the idea that some authors might favour particular words and that the
differential frequency of word use could help attribution.
Two types of evidence are used in attribution studies: external evidence such as
biographical details of the possible author(s), diaries and correspondence, and
internal evidence which is particular to a text and includes style and word or phrase
usage. In using internal evidence the general approach is to describe, quantitatively
or qualitatively or both, characteristics of texts of known authorship and then to

judge how closely they match the same characteristics of a text of unknown or
disputed authorship. While this sounds straightforward, in principle at least, there
may be difﬁculties. Some early writers may not have written much, or their works
may have been edited or written in collaboration with others. The use of external
evidence and judgements of style are likely to be much used in these cases.
Stylometric methods based on measurement and tabulation can help, of course,
but need both a sufﬁciently large number of texts in order to decide what the style is
(as Dr. Johnson well knew) and the computational ability to process these data. The
availability of computers from the 1960s on meant that quantitative analysis could
be used more easily and methods developed to exploit this capacity. These analyses
inevitably require more data (texts, in this case). Fortunately the storage and
searching of large databases of texts have greatly helped in this. Electronic down-
loads of books and notes are now commonplace.
As we have seen, the 1960s also saw the development of Bayesian methods in
statistics. Some applications of Bayes’ Rule were fairly easily implemented by hand or
with simple calculators but the increasingly ubiquitous computers enabled a much wider
range of problems to be addressed. It is from this period that our case study is taken.

The War of Independence between the American colonists and Britain ended in 1776
with victory for the Americans. But now they were no longer colonies but an indepen-
dent republic just what form of republican government did they want? The America
then was very different from the United States we know now being just the
thirteen states on the eastern seaboard from Georgia in the south to New Hampshire
in the north. Each state had its own legislature and constitution. Following victory, a
Continental Congress was formed to which each state sent delegates so that a common
future could be decided. The Articles of Confederation were drafted by 1777 but were
not ratiﬁed by all thirteen states until 1781, which gives some indication of the tensions
between the various interests. There was seen to be a need to strengthen Congress,
which lacked executive authority. This question was addressed by the Federal Con-
vention which in 1787 sentto Congressa Constitution with which to replace the Articles
with the object of strengthening the role of the central government. Delaware was the
ﬁrst state to ratify the Constitution in December 1787 by a unanimous vote in favour,
thirty votes to none. Other states followed, the last being Rhode Island in May 1790.
Taking all states’ votes together the Constitution was ratiﬁed by 1157 votes to 761 [2].
This period saw a vigorous and often thoughtful debate about what role central
government ought to play and what should be left to the states: the Federalist and
anti-Federalist viewpoints.2 The best known example is a series of articles in the
Federalist cause published to inﬂuence the ratiﬁcation vote in New York (which
ratiﬁed the Constitution in July 1788 by 30 votes to 27). The articles ﬁrst appeared
in the New York newspapers two to four times each week and were later published
as a single volume. They are known as The Federalist Papers. They are famous for

the quality and elegance of their arguments and also because of the debate over who
wrote which of them.
It was a convention of eighteenth century publication that pamphlets and articles
proposing often contentious arguments were published anonymously so that atten-
tion was given to the arguments themselves and not the reputation, for good or ill, of
the authors (a tradition which has largely died out though some magazines maintain
anonymity, The Economist is one). The Federalist Papers were published using the
pseudonym Publius,3 a name previously used by Alexander Hamilton, one of the
authors. The other two authors were James Madison and John Jay. The majority of
the papers were written by only one of the three rather than being a joint effort by all
three. Jay wrote just ﬁve of the eighty-ﬁve papers before becoming too ill to
continue. Who wrote the others, Hamilton or Madison?

Hamilton and Madison both favoured a strong central government and cooperated
on the papers. Both went on to hold high ofﬁce in the republic, Hamilton as the ﬁrst
Secretary of the Treasury and Madison as fourth President. But their backgrounds
were quite different.

Alexander Hamilton was born illegitimate in St Croix in the Danish West Indies,
now US Virgin Islands since their sale in 1917. He started his working life as a clerk
in his mother’s store before moving to New York in his teens. He was Chief of Staff
to George Washington in the War of Independence. When Washington became
president he appointed Hamilton as the ﬁrst Secretary of the Treasury of the new
republic.
In 1804, some time after leaving ofﬁce, Hamilton spoke against Aaron Burr
(Jefferson’s vice president) when Burr unsuccessfully ran for governor of
New York State. They were old antagonists and Burr took exception to some
remarks about himself which had appeared in the press and were attributed to
Hamilton. Burr demanded satisfaction by duel which duly took place at
Weehawken, New Jersey. Hamilton was killed. It was the same place where his
eldest son Philip had died, also in a duel, three years earlier. Father and son used the
same borrowed pistols
James Madison had a grander start in life. Born in Port Conway, Virginia he, in
due course, inherited the family tobacco plantation and so a great many slaves, as
was usual. He was much involved in revolutionary politics in his native state and
was one of its delegates to the Continental Congress and later the Constitutional
Convention. Because of his prominent role in drafting it he has become known as
the Father of the Constitution.
He was an astute politician, well known for his ability to strike a necessary
compromise. For example, to get the slave owning states of the South to support the
Constitution he brokered a deal whereby for the purposes of representation and
taxation slaves would be treated as members of the population of the state and not as
the property of their owners. Five slaves were counted as three people.
He became Jefferson’s Secretary of State and, on Jefferson’s death, succeeded
him to be the fourth President. At the end of his active political life he retired back
home to Virginia.

Why the uncertainty about who wrote what?6 Well, politicians don’t like to be
shown to be inconsistent (hard in our internet age) and so both Hamilton and
Madison might have found it convenient that those papers be unattributed which
expressed views they later rejected. And yet the desire to claim authorship was
strong. Hamilton did leave a list but it was not drawn up calmly or openly. Two days
before the fatal duel with Burr he stopped by the law ofﬁce of Egbert Benson, a
friend, and ostentatiously slipped his list into Benson’s bookcase. The list, retrieved
after the duel, gave Hamilton as the author of sixty-three papers.
After he left the presidency Madison, who had been reticent about authorship, said
that he thought Hamilton may well have made mistakes in his list “owing doubtless to
the hurry in which the memorandum was made out”. Madison now claimed authorship
of twenty-nine papers rather that the fourteen for which Hamilton had given him credit.

Perhaps a little old school stylistic analysis would help. As might be expected
these two men differed in how they expressed themselves, not least in how they
wrote. Richard Brookhiser, in his short biography of Hamilton, [4] put the differ-
ence like this: “Jay and Madison can be epigrammatic . . . or fussily formal . . .
Hamilton is ﬂowing, sometimes overﬂowing, and agitated.” This might help in
deciding the authorship of the Federalist papers. A little quantitative analysis might
help too.
~ • ~
In the early 1960s this problem of attribution attracted the attention of two statis-
ticians, Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace (M&W for short), and it is their
study7 which is used here.
The task was to ﬁnd some numerical measure to discriminate the writings of
Hamilton from those of Madison in the twelve papers the authorship of which was
disputed. Early thoughts that sentence length might provide that measure were
quickly abandoned; both average and standard deviation (a measure of variability)
were almost the same (Table 13.1).

A measure of style might possibly have been made based on phrases typically
used by the authors but the deﬁnition and measurement problems of dealing with
phrases were likely to be difﬁcult. Using single words would be easier and was
common in attribution studies. The historian Douglass Adair suggested that the
differential frequency of some words might be strong indicators of authorship of the
Federalist papers. In particular he noted that in the situations where Hamilton used
while Madison used whilst.
Word use is evidence of authorship and so a Bayes analysis should help. The rate
of occurrence of a word in the papers of known authorship together with an
appropriate likelihood function will give the degree to which we should believe
that Hamilton rather than Madison is the author of a disputed paper. (We’ve seen
this idea before, in Table 7.4.) M&W give an example based on the usage of the
word also. This is not a frequently used word, making up 0.031% of the text written
by Hamilton and 0.067% of Madison’s text: about 3 in 10,000 for Hamilton and
twice that for Madison.
In analysing the margin of error in Chap. 6 we wanted to estimate the percentage
of voters saying they would vote Yes given an assumed proportion of the total
population of Scotland who would say the same. The Binomial distribution was the
likelihood function. The analogous situation here is that given a known
(or assumed) rate of usage of also the Binomial model will give the probability of
ﬁnding the word used 0 or 1 or 2 or more times in a paper of a given length (the
sample size). For a 2000 word paper the results are shown in Table 13.2.

For example, if also doesn’t appear at all there is a 67.3% probability that the
author was Hamilton, odds of about 2:1. If also appears three times there is a
probability of just 16.9% that Hamilton was the author, odds of about 5:1 in favour
of Madison. This shows that Bayes’ Rule certainly gives a way of making attribu-
tions, which is what M&W wanted, but before it could be used for the Federalist
problem three questions had to be answered and these are shown in a Bayes Grid
(Fig. 13.2).
The three questions were
what base rates should be used?
is the Binomial model adequate for these likelihoods?
how accurately can the word rates be estimated?
and also there was the important question
which words should be used as evidence?
Finding good answers to these questions is what most of M&W’s study
describes. They were working in the 1960s when this approach to attribution was
new and so had to establish most of the details of the application. Seeing how they
answered the questions raised by the Bayes Grid will show decisions typically
necessary for the basic idea to be used for realistically complex problems.
~ • ~
What Base Rates Should Be Used?
M&W were statisticians not historians, linguists or experts in the study of literary
style. They felt uneasy about giving base rates. These have to be based on judge-
ment or data which are independent of the evidence used for the rest of the analysis.
M&W did not feel competent to make such judgements even though these are
needed for the application of Bayes’ Rule. So they didn’t.
There are a number of responses to the problem of being so unsure about giving
values for base rates, or any other parameters, that you feel uncomfortable giving
any values at all. For probabilities, giving ﬂat distributions, all probabilities equal,
is one way of encoding maximum ignorance (Chap. 10). Alternatively, many
people ﬁnd sensitivity analysis useful. Changing the values of parameters one at a
time and seeing the effect can help. It may be that the results are sufﬁciently robust

as to be useful. Alternatively, if not, the sources of imprecision are identiﬁed in the
hope that more thought or data will improve the situation. If this is not possible the
analysis can support only an appropriately tentative conclusion. M&W did not see
themselves as doing any of these.
They postponed consideration of base rates until after they had made attributions
of authorship using an analysis based on likelihoods alone. Although postponing
the, for them, uncomfortable task of giving base rates looks as if no base rates are
given, we have seen that what this really means is giving equal rates, 50:50 in this
case—a numerical expression of maximum ignorance, which is just how the two
statisticians felt.
M&W, or you or I, could then consider how strong our views, our base rates,
would have to be to upset the result in favour of the other author. In the illustration,
if the word also was found three times in a 2000 word document the odds, based on
that evidence alone, are 5:1 in favour of Madison, a probability of 83% that
Madison was the author. If your initial feeling was that Madison was the author
you have support for your view. But if you felt that Hamilton was the author you
now have evidence to the contrary. The strength of the evidence is described
numerically but your initial feeling is not, which is why you did not want to give
base rates. (We used this argument in Fig. 10.1 to think about Steve’s job.)
While it can be difﬁcult to give probability estimates of what you believe it is
generally much easier to react to a proposed value, especially if that value is very
large or very small. In the extreme, the evidence may point so overwhelmingly to
one conclusion that your initial judgements would have to be similarly extreme, but
in favour of a different alternative, for a decision in favour of that different
alternative to be justiﬁed.
What is the critical value when deciding authorship? Having seen also three
times we would need to believe that, based on judgement unrelated to the analysis
of the text, the probability that Hamilton was the author was more than 83% to
justify deciding in his favour (Fig. 13.3).

Using this approach cautious statisticians postpone making that awkward prior
judgement about authorship and stick to that quantitative analysis in which they are
expert. Consumers of that analysis, whether you or me or anybody else, are then
faced with a recommendation that
if you judge that the probability that Hamilton wrote this text is
greater than eighty-three percent you are justiﬁed in believing him
to be the author, otherwise you should believe that Madison wrote it
or, equivalently,
if you judge that the odds that Hamilton wrote this text are better than
ﬁve to one you are justiﬁed in believing him to be the author,
otherwise you should believe that Madison wrote it
either of which should be easier than asking you for base rate probabilities.
We have been used to thinking about Bayes’ Rule like this
belief is proportional to base rate  likelihood
so that, because we read English from left to right, the implication is that we think
ﬁrst about our base rates because they describe the context of the problem, and then
look at the evidence. But here we reverse that order and think like this
belief is proportional to likelihood  base rate
to ease the difﬁculty, if there is any difﬁculty, of giving judgemental base rates.
When the base rates are found from data, as with medical diagnosis, the
difference in these two approaches is immaterial but when the interpretation of
results relies on the judgement of the user of the analysis it may be more useful to do
the calculation ﬁrst using maximum ignorance base rates. Even if these calculations
are quite complex, as with M&W’s work, the results are easily stated as probabil-
ities or odds about which non-statisticians may have a view.
And so M&W used this wait-and-see strategy both in the hope (I think) of
possibly not having to make a difﬁcult judgement and also to leave scope for
interpretation by others.
~ • ~
Is the Binomial Model Adequate for These Likelihoods?
In the illustration likelihoods were given by the Binomial distribution. This is a
model commonly used for this sort of problem because it relies on just a few
assumptions which are frequently met, in this case that the probability that any word
in a text is also is the same in all places in the text and that occurrences are
independent. It is common that the number of times the word is seen in each of a
number of texts is well enough predicted by the model for the predictions to be
useful.
13

147

The Poisson distribution is a simpler version of the Binomial.10 The basic
assumptions are the same but only the average number of occurrences, not the
sample size and rate, is needed. This is often more convenient and was used by
M&W.
It always makes sense to check if the model does, in fact, provide sufﬁciently
accurate forecasts. M&W tested the adequacy of the Poisson distribution by getting
a number of blocks of text of no less than a hundred words, and mostly more than a
thousand, from papers and other material known to have been written by Hamilton
or by Madison. The number of times a given word was seen in each of the blocks
was found. This was the likelihood distribution to be modelled. For example, the
black bars in Fig. 13.4 shows the distribution for the word an in two hundred and
sixty-two bocks known to have been written by Madison. In seventy-seven blocks
an appeared only once.
The white bars to the right show the distribution predicted by the Poisson model.
Ninety-six blocks contained just one occurrence of an. This was the general picture;
the model tended to underpredict the number of papers in which the word occurred
not at all and also where it occurred a lot and consequently to overpredict the
numbers of papers with just one or a few occurrences. In short, the observed
distribution showed more variability than the Poisson predictions.
M&W reasoned that there must be some other source of variation than that
described by the model. The Binomial/Poisson model makes the critical assumption
that for any block of words, or subsets of that block, the rate for any word is the
same. It doesn’t matter if we take the ﬁrst hundred words or the last or any other, the

average rate with which a word occurs is the same. But can that be true? It is surely
plausible that words may be more common in some sections than others depending
on the subject of the writing. An even bigger effect for M&W arises because they
took blocks not just from different sections of a paper but from different papers too.
The Negative Binomial distribution, closely related to the Binomial model, better
allows for this variability. The predictions of this model are much closer to the
observed values, as Fig. 13.4 shows, and so was used by M&W.
~ • ~
How Accurately Can the Word Rates Be Estimated?
Being careful statisticians M&W knew that ﬁnding word rates for the Poisson
model, or values for the parameters of the Negative Binomial model, had inevitably
to be based on samples of the writing of Hamilton and Madison (the undisputed
Federalist papers, most obviously) not the whole body of their work. Rather than
knowing that the rate for Hamilton was exactly 0.031 occurrences of also per
thousand words all that could be said was that it was “about 0.031”. Since the
value is estimated from sample data “about 0.031” means ﬁnding a probability
distribution to measure the margin of error of the estimate. Once that distribution is
found the likelihood for each possible rate, and the probability of that rate, can be
used to give a probability distribution of odds or belief probabilities that Hamilton
was the author. This distribution will be a Beta distribution, just like the one used in
Chap. 6.
In just the same way there will be a margin of error for Madison’s rate of “about
0.067”. Combining the two margin of error distributions gives probabilities of all
pairs of rates, one for Hamilton and one for Madison, and the corresponding
likelihoods and belief probabilities.
The same approach is used to ﬁnd the margin of error for the parameters of the
Negative Binomial model.
Putting all this together is not simple. The result for each paper is not a single
ﬁgure for probability but a distribution describing the margin of error of that
estimate, just as in Chap. 6 we had the probability that the proportion of voters
was between two limits. This means that users of the report will be looking at
probabilities of probabilities, which is not for everyone. Alternatively, report the
average. This is what M&W did.
The mathematics of all this is not for this book but you can see how Bayes
thinking about likelihoods was the foundation of the analysis.

Which Words Should Be Used as Evidence?
Early studies identiﬁed marker words, those which discriminate between Hamilton
and Madison. Table 13.3 shows the rates of occurrence per thousand words of four
markers for the Federalist papers.
M&W comment that “These data show rather clearly that the disputed papers as
a whole are Madisonian, but in this form they cannot settle the papers singly . . .
What is wanted from these and other data is, for each paper, a good measure of the
weight of evidence toward Madison or Hamilton.”13 They wanted a better measure
because, although the number of words available for the analysis is in the thou-
sands, the rate of occurrence of the marker words is very small. The Federalist
papers are each about 2000 words long so whether the appearance or
non-appearance of one of these marker words is due to who wrote the paper or
just the small sample provided by the text is not easy to decide. War and Peace they
are not.
The lengths of the twelve papers were ﬁxed. To increase discrimination M&W
needed more evidence and this meant using more than just one word so that “the
evidence is overwhelming, though no one clue is”.14 While this increased the
complexity of their model it is in principle no different from other applications of
Bayes’ Rule: more evidence leads to better discrimination. But which words to use?
To choose the most useful needed an analysis of their occurrence in papers
known to have been written either by Hamilton or by Madison. But the Federalist
papers of known authorship are not numerous when considered as a statistical
sample. This is so particularly for Madison. M&W decided to augment the sample
by using other papers written at about the same time as the Federalist set and on
similar topics. These they called exterior papers. The result was forty-eight papers
by Hamilton and ﬁfty by Madison.

In thinking about which words to use M&W distinguish function words and
contextual or content words. Function words (such as prepositions and pronouns)
are those which are expected to occur whatever the topic being discussed and so
might be thought characteristic of the prose style of the author. For example, the use
of by is shown in the left half of Table 13.4.15 The column for each author shows the
number of papers by density of occurrence of the word.
Both authors used by quite frequently, though Madison more than Hamilton and
so by discriminates quite well: lower frequency of use indicating Hamilton as the
more likely author and higher frequencies indicating Madison.
Contextual words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), on the other hand, are
less common for both authors and highly dependent on the subject of the paper.
Many papers may not contain the word at all. The pattern of use of war in the right
half of the table clearly shows this.16 The effect of the topic being discussed
swamps the stylistic preferences of the authors. Whoever is writing, if the paper
is about war then war will appear as needed by the discussion. If war is not the
subject of the paper war may well not appear at all. Contextual words are less likely
to provide evidence of authorship.

For papers 49 onward the minimum is 99.96%. Even for paper 55 the low
estimate is over 97%. You would have to have as base rate a probability in favour
of Hamilton greater than this value to sustain a belief that that the author was not
Madison. It seems highly unlikely, to put it mildly, that you would have grounds for
such a strong belief. This is just what M&W thought might be the case when they
decided not to specify base rates but to wait and see what their analysis showed:
reaction rather than speciﬁcation.
~ • ~
The main interest of M&W was methodological. Their study was thorough and can
be summarised in a number of ways. Here, I have emphasised how the basic
structure of their analyses relies on those simple elements of Bayes’ Rule that we
have met before. The extensions needed by M&W have been sketched to show
some of the model building necessary, but the basics are unaltered.
Previous attributions, notably by Alvar Ellega˚rd [6], had used statistical methods
but were not Bayesian. M&W’s analysis is generally taken to have settled the
matter to the extent that correctly attributing the disputed papers to Madison is
taken as a benchmark for testing other methods [7–10], though the possibility that
some of the disputed papers were, to some extent, written jointly by Hamilton and
Madison has been raised [11].
~ • ~
The need to decide who wrote what is widespread and growing. Forgery and
plagiarism are pretty obvious areas where some detective work, aided by a little
statistics, is needed. Perhaps not so obvious is trying to ﬁnd how much of the text of
bills presented by US legislators is actually provided by lobbyists. The University
of Chicago’s Legislative Inﬂuence Detector18 can help [12].
Not all the methods are Bayesian, but the work of Mosteller and Wallace
prepared the ground.

Chapter 14
Wood, Trees and Wildlife
The pressures of a growing population have reduced the area of the planet covered
by forests from 4128 million hectares in 1990 to 3999 million hectares in 2015, a
reduction by an area about the size of South Africa [1]. This global decline is
important for a number of reasons, not least because of its effects on biodiversity
and climate. A minority of forest is used for commercial purposes. In 2015 global
trade (exports) in wood and wood products was worth US$226 billion [2]. The
management of forests for proﬁt is different from management to meet purely
ecological objectives but in both cases knowing the number and state of the trees
is important.
Ecological models are helpful in a number of aspects of forest management, two
of which—how much sellable wood a forest contains and what are the impacts on
forest wildlife of commercial logging—will be used to show how.
Each illustrates a different strength of adopting a Bayesian approach; how to
deal with difﬁcult likelihoods and how to use base rates when strongly held views
might affect a decision.
~ • ~
The owners of a commercial forest will want to know the value of their asset; how
much wood they have in their forest and how much it is worth. The inventory which
gives this information is called a timber cruise. Money value will be a function of
the species of tree and the purpose for which the harvested wood might be used—
for sawnwood or wood pulp, for instance. The assessment then rests on just how
much wood is in the forest. This is measured as cubic metres of merchantable wood.
Finding the volume of each of a sample of trees in the forest gives an estimate for
the whole forest.
How to ﬁnd the volume of wood in a tree? Think of the trunk as a tall tapering
tube, like a very slender cone. To ﬁnd the volume of a cone requires only the base

diameter and height, and so knowing the height of the tree and its base diameter
should enable a good estimate of its volume to be made. By convention, the
diameter is measured not where the trunk emerges from the ground but at about
chest level. Some form of calliper, such as that shown in Fig. 14.1, makes this easy
to do. Well, almost. There is no universally agreed height above ground at which
this measurement, the diameter at breast height (Dbh), should be made. But the
differences are too small to have a material effect.
In principle, measuring height is also easy. You have probably seen a picture of a
painter holding a pencil vertically at arm’s length to ﬁnd the relative heights of
objects in a drawing or painting; a building, a hill, even a tree. In this very low-tech
method hold a measuring stick (pencil, ruler) in front of you and adjust how far
away you are from the tree until the bottom and top of the tree and the bottom and
top of your stick are aligned. If you are twenty times further from the tree than your
stick is from your eye then the tree is twenty times taller than your stick.
Alternatively use a clinometer. This measures the angle between the horizontal
and your sight line to the top of the tree. Then, with a little trigonometry, it is easy to
ﬁnd a factor by which to multiply the distance to the tree to get its height.
Or download an app for your cell phone.
You will have to be clear about the location of the top of your tree. Only measure
as far up the trunk as the tree is wide enough to be commercially useful for whatever
purpose you have in mind. This is the merchantable height.

Helpful folk have made estimates of the volume of wood given the type of tree
you have measured. For example, Table 14.1 shows a fragment of a table provided
in the 1970s by the Forest Service of the US Department of Agriculture:
Nowadays, of course, this information will be provided in some useful software.
All of this is just what you want, provided you can see the top of your tree. No
problem for a lonely tree in the middle of a ﬁeld but no good in a densely packed
forest where the tops of the trees merge to form a canopy.
What to do?
It seems likely that, for any given species, there is a relation between height and
diameter, for any species, taller trees have fatter trunks (Fig. 14.2).
Once we have this simple model the height can be estimated from the diameter
and the volume of merchantable timber found.
Later in this chapter we’ll see how Bayes’ Rule helps us to ﬁnd an appropriate
relation between height and diameter. But ﬁrst, here is a simple illustration to show
some of the modelling issues.

Wood, Trees and Wildlife
157

To ﬁnd the right straight line for a given species of tree collect some data. The
points on the graph in Fig. 14.3 are the diameter and height measurements for the
nine trees in a (small) sample.
The straight line is ﬁxed by choosing values for the slope of the line, its gradient,
and the intercept. The slope of this line is 0.5; an increase in diameter of 20cm is
associated with an increase in height of 10m. The intercept is the value of height at
zero diameter. No such trees exist, of course (no diameter, no tree) but the intercept
ﬁxes a particular line of all those parallel lines with the same slope. Think of the
intercept as a necessary parameter. In this case the intercept is 5m. To predict the
height of a tree just halve its width and add ﬁve.
The data do not fall conveniently in a straight line, they never do. But there is
clearly an upward relation. Using this straight line model will give pretty good
estimates of height from diameter but there will inevitably be an error such as that
shown. The solid dot is for a tree 34m high with a diameter of 50cm. Using the
straight line model, the predicted height is 30m, an error of 4m for this tree.
A standard statistical method called regression analysis ﬁnds the values of slope
and intercept which minimise the aggregate error to give a line of best ﬁt.2 The
analysis also gives the distribution of errors to show how good an estimate we have.
Fig. 14.3 Linear model with data points
2Regression analysis ﬁts the line which minimises the sum of squared errors. Squaring prevents
positive and negative errors, overestimates and underestimates, from cancelling each other out.
This method is called least squares regression. You will be able to do this on your spreadsheet.

Imagine that the sample had included hundreds of trees all with diameter 50cm.
It is likely that the plot of the distribution of heights would look like the one shown
in Fig. 14.4.
This shape occurs so often that it is called the Normal distribution.3 Tree heights
are clustered round the average, 30m. Tall trees and short trees are less common,
and get rarer the taller or shorter they are.
Just like the Beta distribution used to describe the voting intentions of the people
in Scotland in Chap. 6 it is the area under this curve which gives probability. The
height is a value proportional to probability for any given diameter, so 34m exactly,
plus or minus nothing. No measurements are that precise but the height of the curve
gives the relative value of probability for any diameter. This will be useful.
One ﬁnal word about this Normal distribution. You can see that just about all
trees have heights within 9 m of the average (only a quarter of one percent of trees
have heights outside this range). This gives a measure of variation or spread, which
will be different for different types of tree. One sixth of that range, 3m in this case,
is a conventional measure of spread called standard deviation.4
Fig. 14.4 Normal distribution of tree heights
3Also known as the Gaussian distribution, named for the German mathematician Carl Friedrich
Gauss. Your spreadsheet will have the necessary functions.
4Standard deviation is a widely used measure. For distributions other than the Normal do not just
divide range by six. Consult a stats book.

This spread has two aspects. Most obviously, it describes the variation natural in
many systems—trees, manufactured objects, people. But it also describes the error
we might make by using the average as a prediction (Fig. 14.5).
Given a reasonable number of data (a lot more than nine) regression is a good
way of ﬁtting a useful model. The simple linear model is ﬁxed if we know three
things: intercept, slope, and error spread. The regression model gives all three.
~ • ~
But you may not have any data, or not so many that you are conﬁdent that ﬁtting a
regression model would give reliable results that you would be happy to use. You
may be familiar with other models like this for the prediction of tree height and so,
from your experience, are conﬁdent that the intercept is either 5 or 7 and the slope is
either 0.5 or 0.6. (This is an artiﬁcial illustration, remember). There are four
possible straight line models (Table 14.2).

Which model to choose? If we have no preference we could make four pre-
dictions of height and take the average.
But we have the heights and widths of a few trees as evidence to assess the
models’ performance and so decide between them. For example, our 34m high tree
with a trunk 50cm in diameter can be plotted on the same graph as the four models
(Fig. 14.6).
This one observation provides some evidence to help. Model C, with an intercept
of 5 and slope of 0.6, gives a good prediction of the height of our tree,
overestimating by just 1m. It would be foolish to reject the other three models on
the evidence of just one tree. Bayes’ Rule provides a framework for judging by how
much we should now prefer one model to another; what degree of belief we should
have that model C is the true (more true, at any rate) description of the relation
between diameter and height. The Bayes Grid shows what we need to know
(Fig. 14.7).

If we have no views on the parameter values, use equal base rates.
Likelihood distributions give probabilities of what we see as evidence: how
likely is a tree 34m high given that its diameter is 50cm and model A is the true
relation between height and width? We already have this. The Normal distribution
of errors shows that using model A the prediction is a height of 30m and the Normal
error distribution shows that the probability of a height of 34m is proportional to
0.055. To keep things simple assume the same likelihood distribution for each
model, differing only in the average, the predicted value (Fig. 14.8).
Putting all this information in the Bayes Grid (Fig. 14.9) conﬁrms what the simple
predictions show—the prediction of model C is the best and that of model A the
worst—but we can now see how strongly we should believe in each of the models.
This is just a sketch to show how some Bayes thinking helps in deciding between
models. The straight line model was simple. This Bayesian approach to parameter
estimation comes into its own with more complex models. We’d need more than
one lonely tree as evidence, of course.

In practice, the possible values of the parameters would not be so limited. Rather
than describing the intercept as being either 5 or 7 we might want to say that based
on experience elsewhere the intercept is somewhere between 3 and 12 and so have a
base rate probability distribution for all values in this range, for slope and standard
deviation of errors too.

The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) is found in the south eastern United States.
Originally valued for its resin it is now used for lumber and pulp. These trees can be
long lived and grow to about 50m. As Fig. 14.10 shows, the trunk is slim and does
not taper much. The needles are longer than those of other pines, hence the name.
Once plentiful, poor management has resulted in a decline of the tree to the
extent that the area in which it is dominant is now only about three percent of what
it was at its peak.

The life of a longleaf pine can be thought of as occurring in a number of stages.
The Longleaf Alliance identiﬁes six: seed, grass, bottlebrush, sapling, mature, old
growth, and then death.6
William Platt and his colleagues from Florida State University in Tallahassee
measured the characteristics of a random sample of nearly four hundred longleaf pines
in an 80ha tract, the Wade Tract, of Thomas County in Georgia [4]. The aim of their
study was not to calibrate a diameter/height model but their data were used to do just
that by Brian Beckage of the University of Vermont working with Platt and others [5].
In the illustration above a straight line model was used. It is the simplest form. But
trees do not grow forever to inﬁnite height and girth, there must be a limit (Fig. 14.11).
The data from the Wade Tract shows this tendency (Fig. 14.12).

This is ﬁne, but what about the six different stages of growth suggested by the
Longleaf Alliance? It is at least plausible that in growing from one stage to the next
the relation between diameter and height also switches from one form to another. A
smooth curve does not describe these sharp changes. Beckage and his colleagues
simpliﬁed the six stages to three: the grass stage, in which juvenile trees grow in
diameter but not much in height; the adult or middle stage, in which both diameter
and height grow steadily; the ﬁnal stage, in which the growth enters the canopy, light
is reduced and so is the rate of growth of height. It was assumed that at each stage the
relation between diameter and height was linear. The points of transition between
stages are called change-points and occur at diameters cp1 and cp2 in Fig. 14.13.
Although the three sections are just straight lines the introduction of the change-
points complicates the model. The straight line models can only be ﬁtted and the
error distribution found once the change-points are known. But these points and the
lines between them must be found simultaneously. Simple regression model ﬁtting
will not work, but a Bayesian approach will. The spread of errors is needed for the
likelihoods and so was treated as a model parameter. The nine parameters to be
estimated were
for each stage:
for stage 1:
for each change-point:
the slope and the spread of errors
the intercept
the diameter at breast height
Very young trees aren’t tall enough to reach to breast height. In those cases the
diameter close to the ground was measured and an allowance added to give an
estimate of the equivalent diameter at breast height. This tenth parameter was also
included in the Bayesian analysis by Beckage and his colleagues.
They wanted the results of the analysis to depend primarily on the data rather
than on their judgements and so chose quite ﬂat and non-informative base rate
distributions. A number were tried. Examples are shown in Figs. 14.14 and 14.15.

The calculations were not simple and so a Monte Carlo analysis, like the one
described in Chap. 12, was made using samples of 40,000. The results are shown in

The distributions which these values summarise are quite precise. The ranges
described by the low and high values are ninety-ﬁve percent intervals. For example,
we are justiﬁed in believing with ninety-ﬁve percent probability that the slope for
stage 2 lies between 1.11 and 1.35.
The graph (Fig. 14.16) using average values for intercept, slopes and change-
points (shown by dashed lines) shows a good ﬁt to the data.

Beckage and his colleagues wanted a model which recognised the stages in the life
of the longleaf pine. This complicated the analysis because it required the simul-
taneous estimation of where each section begins and ends and also the slopes in
between. Using a Bayesian approach overcame this problem.
As we have seen before, in the analysis of the Federalist papers in Chap. 13, a
cautious approach was taken to the speciﬁcation of base rates.
Deciding the number of change points is also a judgement. Following Platt,
Beckage and his colleagues used three stages, and so two change points, rather than
six or some other number, a decision inﬂuenced by the original data collection. In
other cases the number of change points have been limited so that only “larger and
more abrupt changes are highlighted” [6], a more pragmatic argument.
The estimation of timber volumes is quite a technical task. There is no reason to
think that there is much dispute about the basic purpose, though different models
may have their enthusiasts. But some consequences of logging may be viewed quite
differently, even antagonistically, by different people. There may be strongly held
but different views, as the next case shows.
~ • ~
We have seen that in a wood or forest the topmost growth of trees forms a canopy
and that this makes it more difﬁcult to estimate tree height. The canopy also reduces

9(Beckage et al. Figure 4(b). p. 462. Reproduced courtesy of The New Phytologist, Wiley)

the light that reaches the ground beneath it. Changes in light level lead to changes in
the habitats of plants and animals and birds that live in the forest. It is easier to
assess the impact of the canopy by studying what happens when some is removed
rather than seeing what happens as it grows (it’s quicker). Francis Crome and his
colleagues of the Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Organisation (CSIRO) in
Australia did just that [7].
A rainforest on the Windsor Tableland in Queensland was divided into two
areas, an unlogged area of 45ha and a logged area of 19ha managed by the
Queensland Forest Service. Trees removed during logging altered the light climate
in the forest and so too did the tracks needed to get to the trees to remove the logs.
Logging eliminated twenty-two percent of the canopy.
Birds and small mammals living in the forest were surveyed several times before
and after logging. Birds were caught in nets and marked with metal leg bands and
then released. Mammals were similarly caught and tagged. There were nine survey
sites in each of the logged and unlogged areas. The number of birds and mammals
trapped gave a measure of their abundance.
The changes in habitat brought about by logging may either increase or decrease
abundance depending on whether the changes are favourable or not for the species
in the forest. The change in capture rates was used to measure the size of the logging
effect. A value of 1 meant no change, a value of 0.75 meant a twenty-ﬁve percent
reduction, a value of 1.25 meant a twenty-ﬁve percent increase.
For alternative values of the size of the logging effect a likelihood function was
used which depended on the difference in catches before and after logging and the
time that logging occurred.
One of the species recorded was Bower’s Shrike-thrush (Colluricincla boweri).
The results for this bird are used here as illustration.
The size of the logging effect could be any non-negative value, though not much
greater than about three. With a ﬂat distribution for base rates (all values equally
likely) the Bayesian analysis gave the result shown in Fig. 14.17.
We are justiﬁed in believing that the logging effect is between 0.4 and just over
1. The most likely value is about 0.7, a reduction in abundance of thirty percent.
Logging has a negative effect for this Shrike-thrush.

But what about the opinions of those with an interest in many ecological issues?
There are likely to be sharply different views about the effects of logging. It is not
difﬁcult, in principle, to incorporate these views as different base rate distributions
(as in Fig. 12.8). But how to get the views?
Fifteen people—loggers, conservation activists and members of the public—
were asked what they thought was the size of the logging effect. They were asked
seven questions
1. Choose a level of impact (percentage increase or decrease) so that there is a
50% chance that the effect will be below this level (and therefore a 50%
chance that the effect will be above this level).
2. Suppose I now tell you that the effect is below this level; tell me your new
50% level: this represents the level at which you think there is a 25% chance
that the effect will be below it.
3. What is the smallest credible level for the effect? By this, I mean what level
do you think it is one hundred to one against the effect being below this level?
4. Can you be certain that the effect will not be below any level (you would bet
your life on it)? If so, what is this level?
The last three questions were repeated for high levels.
As we saw in Chap. 10 it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd a probability distribution which
best ﬁts these judgements. Looking at the ﬁfteen responses, it seemed reasonable to
summarise the different views as being in one of three camps: the optimists, the
pessimists or the disinterested. These three points of view were described by three
base rate distributions (Fig. 14.18).
The optimistic view, which might be typical of loggers, has a peak value of about
1.0, the value describing no-change; logging has no effect on the abundance of the
birds.
On the other hand, the pessimistic view, which a conservationist might hold, is
very much skewed towards lower values indicating a belief that logging will cause a
reduction in bird numbers. The most likely value is about 0.4, a sixty percent
reduction.
Fig. 14.18 Base rate distributions model different points of view
14
Wood, Trees and Wildlife
169

The third view is between these two. It was called disinterested in the sense that
someone holding that view had no direct stake or keen interest in the effects of
logging; an ordinary member of the public.
The spread of each of these base rate distributions shows that for each person and
within each group there is some uncertainty about just how big the effect of logging
might be. Even a pessimist believes with probability seven percent that logging
might increase abundance.
With each of these base rate distributions the Bayes analysis was repeated
(Fig. 14.19). After revising belief in light of the evidence of the survey data the
three distributions are very similar (and similar to Fig. 14.17 too): there has been a
convergence of opinion given the data, a familiar result.
Fig. 14.19 Data leads to convergence

Decisions about logging are important commercially and ecologically. They will
be informed by these estimates of the impact on birds and mammals. Being able to
show that the views of interested parties converge given the survey results should
help in demonstrating accountability in the decision making.
~ • ~
Bayesian methods are increasingly used in ecology [8]10 for the two reasons
illustrated by the cases in this chapter. First, models of ecological processes can
be complex and so likelihoods difﬁcult to handle in any other way. Second, base
rates allow judgement to be used either, as here, because there exist competing
viewpoints or because, when data are scarce, base rates provide a way to import
results from elsewhere.

Chapter 15
Radiocarbon Dating
Archaeologists need to know the age of what they ﬁnd; human and animal bones,
for instance. One of the main methods to help them is radiocarbon dating. The level
of radioactivity in an organism (you and me included) is constant while we are alive
but declines at a known and almost constant rate after death. Measuring the reduced
level of radioactivity of archaeological ﬁnds provides an estimate of their age.
These estimates are subject to some error. Knowing the magnitude and shape of the
distribution of errors means that likelihoods can be constructed and so the age of the
archaeological material estimated from the level of radioactivity.
Quite often an archaeologist will have some other information. For example, the
style of decoration used on pottery fragments found at the dig might give a good
idea of which period or century a settlement was established. This base rate
estimate is made independently of the radiocarbon dating and so Bayes’ Rule is a
good way of combining the two.
~ • ~
We often think of carbon dioxide as a bad thing, a product of burning fossil fuels in
cars and factories which then rises in the atmosphere to increase global warming.
All of which is true, but carbon dioxide is also the vital start of the radiocarbon
dating process.
All living things are in part made of carbon. The carbon cycle describes how this
happens. Carbon dioxide exists in the atmosphere. Photosynthesis is the process by
which plants convert energy from the sun into chemical energy and then into the
physical matter of the plant itself. During this process atmospheric carbon becomes
part of the plant. Animals, ourselves included, eat plants. Some animals also eat
other animals who themselves have eaten plants, of course. And so both plants and
animals are made, in small part, of carbon. The decomposition which follows death
releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere by a process called respiration.
And so the cycle is complete.
All chemical elements can exist in a number of forms, called isotopes. Carbon
exists in three forms, 12C, 13C and 14C. The third of these, called carbon fourteen or
radiocarbon, is radioactive, the radioactivity being the result of bombardment by
cosmic rays in the atmosphere about ﬁfteen km above the earth. Although 14C

constitutes only about a millionth part of a millionth part of carbon that is enough.
The point is that 14C is unstable. The level of radioactivity in plants and animals
declines but, for so long as the plant or animal is alive, carbon is replenished and a
stable state is maintained. When the plant or animal dies this replenishment stops
and so the level of radioactivity decreases. Radiocarbon dating is based on the rate
at which this happens.
During the Second World War Willard Libby worked on the Manhattan Project,
which resulted in the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. After the war he went as a
Professor of Chemistry to the Institute for Nuclear Studies and Department of
Chemistry at the University of Chicago. In 1946 he wrote a letter to the editor of
the journal Physical Review in which he set out the basis for radiocarbon dating [1],
further described at book length in 1952 [2]. In 1960 he received the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry.
Libby argued that the rate of decline of radioactivity could be described by a
simple curve. Given the initial level of 15.3 dpm/gC (disintegrations per minute per
gramme of carbon) the level of 14C radioactivity in archaeological remains is
measured and their age found.
The rate of decline is usually described by the element’s half-life, the time taken
for the level of radioactivity to be halved. Libby estimated the half-life of 14C to be
5568 years. After this time radioactivity would be half the original value at the time
of death. After another 5568 years it would halve again to a quarter of the original
value and so on (Fig. 15.1).
In his analysis Libby made several assumptions, for instance that the amount of
14C in the atmosphere has been constant, which have proven not to be true. The
half-life of 14C is now established as 5730 years. The general shape of the model
follows Libby’s curve but is not nicely smooth due to irregularities introduced by
modifying his simplifying assumptions. The radiocarbon age of an archaeological
sample, now found using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), needs to be
calibrated against known true age. The AMS result can then be used to estimate
the age of the archaeological sample. This calibration requires some samples of
Fig. 15.1 Libby’s model of radioactive decay

Radiocarbon Dating

known age. These are provided primarily by samples of wood which can be dated
accurately by an analysis of tree rings.
Archaeologists count back from now and so measure years on a scale Before
Present, BP. The starting point on this scale is 1950, which is when radiocarbon
dating began, so the year 1850 is 100BP. On the graph in Fig. 15.2, the vertical axis
shows the date estimated by the radiocarbon dating, called 14C BP or radiocarbon
years. The horizontal scale shows calendar years, cal BP (alternatively, calibrated
years). The result is a calibration curve.
The irregularities (known as “wiggles”) are modelled as a series of straight lines.
From the date estimated by a laboratory, the radiocarbon years, the best estimate of
the calendar age can be found. In the graph, a radiocarbon age of 3040BP gives a
calendar age of 3178BP or 1228BC.
The estimate is not precise. All samples with calendar age 3178 should have the
same radiocarbon date but this is not so. Differences in sampling, variation in
laboratory practice and so on mean that rather than a nice sharp line we have a band,
the width of which depends on these estimation errors. The date given by the graph
is the average value.
Because of these variations a laboratory will usually give an estimate as a range
so that instead of 3040 there will also be an estimation error, typically a Normal
distribution with standard deviation about 60 years, so you might see 3040  60. A
useful way to think about this is that there is a 95% chance that the true radiocarbon
age is in an interval of twice the standard deviation, so a lower limit of 3040 –
120 ¼ 2920 and an upper limit of 3160. These translate to calendar years of 3169 to
3192 (Fig. 15.3).

It was ﬁrst shown at Lirey, near Troyes, in France probably between 1355 and
1453. It was the property of the mediaeval knight Geoffry de Charny who was killed in
1356, during the Hundred Years War. He left no account of how he came by the cloth.
The cloth was believed to be the burial shroud of Christ and the image the face of
Christ. As such it was, and for some remains, an object of veneration. After some
travels it was placed in the Royal Chapel in Turin Cathedral in 1694.
The history of the cloth before Geoffry obtained it is unknown but it was believed
to have been kept in Constantinople since the time of Christ. There were many
competing theories about the shroud and its origins. Surely, radiocarbon dating could
help by at least determining the age of the cloth. Although this possibility had been
obvious since the early days of dating the methods then available would have
required a sample for analysis of about 500cm2, much too large to be cut from the
shroud. The development of AMS technology in the 1970s meant that radiocarbon
dating now only needed samples of a few square centimetres, about the size of a
postage stamp. And so on 21 April 1988 in the Sacristy of Turin Cathedral a group of
scientists, in the presence of the Archbishop of Turin, Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero,
took samples of the cloth. These samples were sent to three laboratories—in Oxford,
Arizona and Zurich—for dating to be carried out [3].
Figure 15.5 shows the analysis of one of the samples. As with the earlier graph
the 95% interval estimate of the radiocarbon age is shown on the vertical axis.
These limits are projected until they reach the calibration curve from which they are
projected down to give a corresponding estimate of the calendar age of the cloth. In
this case the jaggedness of the calibration curve gives a calendar age estimate in two
parts, two ranges, from 1262 to 1312 and from 1353 to 1384.

From the analysis of all results it was concluded that there is a ninety-ﬁve
percent probability that the shroud dates from between 1260 and 1390. This
estimate includes the date of its ﬁrst exhibition at Lirey.
You will not be surprised to know that there were disbelievers (of this result) but
none of the objections were credible [4]. The cloth is mediaeval.
~ • ~
The intercept method is a very clear way of giving calendar age dates. Given upper
and lower limits of the radiocarbon determination corresponding range estimates of
the calendar date convey uncertainty. But from a Bayesian point of view the
relation is the wrong way round.
The whole point of the analysis is to use the radiocarbon date as evidence to help
us decide how much we should believe in alternative values of the calendar age of
the specimen. The specimen is old because of its calendar age. The radiocarbon age
is as it is because of the calendar age, not vice versa.
Because of measurement error specimens with the same calendar age will
generally have different radiocarbon ages. It is this distribution of radiocarbon
dates which is the likelihood distribution.
Before we got diverted by the Turin Shroud we saw in an illustration that using
the calibration curve a radiocarbon date of 3040 corresponded to a calendar date of
3178. To help in making their report the laboratory used the data on experimental
error to give
probability that calendar age is 3178 GIVEN radiocarbon age is 3040
but for the Bayes Grid we need likelihoods which give
probability that radiocarbon age is 3040 GIVEN calendar age is 3178
In the previous chapter we saw how the heights of the Normal distribution gave
relative likelihoods (Fig. 14.9). Figure 15.6 shows a likelihood distribution for
radiocarbon dating.

The Bayes Grid for this analysis is shown in Fig. 15.7.
Years are given here as whole numbers but time isn’t like that. We could have
3100.84. . . and so we’ll have distributions as curves rather than tables. This is just
what happened when we looked at the percentage answering Yes in the referendum
poll in Chap. 6.
In practice the unevenness of the calibration function (the wiggles) means that
the estimate of the calendar age of the sample will be similarly uneven, something
like Fig. 15.8.
What of base rates?
Archaeologists often have base rate information they wish to use. It is sometimes
in a different form to that which we have seen so far. The calculations can be
difﬁcult. Fortunately, there is software to help, such as the OxCal program of
Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at the University of Oxford.
One problem which often faces archaeologists is sequencing. As well as evi-
dence in the form of samples of wood or bones which can be radiocarbon dated
there may be other good reasons for believing that some samples are older than
others. This base rate information acts as a constraint on the estimates of age.

Ecuador is located in the north west of South America. To the west is the Paciﬁc, to
the north Columbia and to the east and south is Peru. The Jama River is in the
northern Manabı´ province and is known as the centre of the Jama-Coaque culture
which lasted about 2000 years from 355 BC to 1532 AD [5]. As at the mid-1990s the
time and space characteristics of the archaeology of this area were not well under-
stood. James Zeidler, Caitlin Buck and Clifford Litton set out to use the Bayesian
approach to radiocarbon dating to provide a better chronology for the Jama valley [6].
As they wrote, “Chronology construction is one of the most fundamental tasks in
archaeological research, yet one that is never ﬁnished.”
A very general sequence of the cultures of the Jama valley had been established
in the 1950s, based primarily on a little ﬁeldwork at a few sites on the coastal strip.
This enabled a general sequencing (ordering) but no chronology (dating). A peri-
odization was developed in 1957 by the Ecuadorian archaeologist Emilio Estrada.
This was taken up by Betty Meggers of the Smithsonian Institution [7]. Figure 15.9
shows the scheme, proposed as descriptive of the archaeological history of Ecuador
in general.
An important source of information for archaeologists is pottery and ceramics,
changes in style often indicating changes in culture. While the cultures cannot be
examined some of their artefacts can. For example, the ceramic bottle in Fig. 15.10
is from the Chorrera culture in Ecuador dating from the ninth century BC to the
second century BC.

Because of the central role of pottery in establishing a sequence of periods, the
work of the archaeologists was restricted to the four periods following the
preceramic: Early and Late Formative, Regional Development and Integration.
~ • ~
Research over the ten to twenty years following the work of Estrada and Meggers
continued mostly in coastal regions and so did not include northern Manabı´
province. There was much illegal looting of archaeological sites. Some of these
looted artefacts were held by local museums and it was these that were used
subsequently for study. But these artefacts were no longer reliably linked to the
places from which they had been taken and so were of only limited use, if any, in
establishing a chronology for particular areas.
In Fig. 15.9 it is assumed that one period followed another in a pattern of
continuous development, but in fact there had been breaks in the sequence, mostly
due to volcanic eruptions and the Spanish conquest.

Three main cultural phases were identiﬁed for the Jama valley. The earliest was
the Valdivia culture. Common in the western lowlands and coastal region, it saw the
start of a settled village life based on horticulture. The Valdivia was itself
subdivided into phases the ﬁrst seven of which were in the preceramic period.
The eighth and ﬁnal phase was marked by the establishment of larger inland centres
of ceremonial signiﬁcance and with satellite settlements.
The Chorrera culture was geographically widespread, from the coastal lowlands
up onto the Andean highlands. The Chorrera was mainly distinguished by its ceramic
vessels (one of which is shown above), particularly efﬁgy bottles and other ﬁgures.
Next, and most long-lasting, was the Jama-Coaque culture. This comprised a set
of chiefdoms with strongly hierarchical social and political organisation. Position in
the hierarchy was signalled by dress and body ornamentation.
The Jama-Coaque culture was ended by the Spanish conquest, with a consequent
decline in both the quality of ceramic art and, thanks to imported disease, of the human
population too. The next phase, sometimes named Campace after people who lived a
little south of the Jama River valley, broadly followed the Jama-Coaque tradition.
Within each culture there existed a characteristic ceramic style, in this area
labelled Piquigua, Tabuchila, and Muchique. These styles can sometimes be further
subdivided into periods of their own. There are two Piquigua periods and ﬁve
Muchique. This more detailed periodization was used by the archaeologists.
The Spanish conquest was not the only source of discontinuity. Ecuador has
volcanoes (twenty-ﬁve are currently listed) and when they erupt they cause effects
so severe that settlements may be wiped out and new ones, after a time, take their
place: a break in the pattern. The damage comes not just from the molten lava, images
of which you will have seen, but also from the volcanic ash ejected during an eruption,
which is called tephra. The ash may travel a long way before landing, hundreds of
kilometres perhaps. The layers of tephra which are deposited are good indicators of
critical points in a chronology. Analysis of granularity and composition help to locate
the source of the eruption. The Jama valley suffered three such volcanic disruptions;
one split the Piquiga period and one occurred either side of the ﬁrst Muchique period.
There was also a non-volcanic hiatus between the Piquiga and Tabuchila periods.
There were only a few samples suitable for radiocarbon dating for the two
Piquiga phases and so they were treated as one. The resulting seven phases used
by Zeidler, Buck and Litton are shown in Table 15.1.
182
15
Radiocarbon Dating

Using the ﬁeld experience of the archaeologists and the opinions of others expert
in the archaeology of Ecuador a number of points seemed clear. The four oldest
phases, from Piquiga to Muchique 2, followed one from the other. There were
thought to be gaps between them. The two most recent periods, Muchique 4 and
Muchique 5, abutted each other so that the end of one was coincident with the start
of the other. Muchique 3 was thought to overlap its neighbours. This consensus is
shown in Fig. 15.11.
This sequencing was ﬁne, but what of the dates of these phases?
Each of the seven phases is described by two values, a start date and an end date.
These are the fourteen parameters we wish to estimate. Just as in other applications
base rate information has described some prior knowledge or context. In this case

the sequencing information provides that knowledge but as a series of inequalities
rather than as a probability distribution. There were seven obvious constraints to
ensure that no phase ended before it started. Counting in years BP, so that earlier
events have larger numbered dates,
start Piquiga is greater than end Piquiga
and so on for all seven phases. The three gaps between the four earliest phases were
ensured by
end Piquiga is greater than or equal to start Tabuchila
end Tabuchila is greater than or equal to start Muchique 1
end Muchique 1 is greater than or equal to start Muchique 2
These three constraints were “greater than or equal to” and not just “greater than” to
allow for the possibility that the analysis might give a gap width of zero, and so
provoke second thoughts about the effects of the disruptions.
For the three phases Muchique 2, Muchique 3 and Muchique 4 it was important
that they both started and ended in that order, as shown in the diagram and so,
start Muchique 2 is greater than start Muchique 3
start Muchique 3 is greater than start Muchique 4
and
end Muchique 2 is greater than end Muchique 3
end Muchique 3 is greater than end Muchique 4
Finally, to ensure that Muchique 4 and Muchique 5 abut each other
end Muchique 4 is equal to start Muchique 5
~ • ~
These conditions set the relative ordering of the fourteen parameters. The dates
were estimated using a Bayes model with, as evidence, thirty-six samples of
charcoal from sixteen sites. Care was taken that wherever possible these samples
were from well deﬁned features such as pits and hearths. This was to ensure the
closest correlation between the results of the carbon dating and actual locations in
the stratigraphic record. There was a thirty-seventh sample which had previously
been used by Estrada and was included as corroborating evidence.
~ • ~
The likelihood distribution rested on three assumptions. First, that for any calendar
date the distribution of radiocarbon dates followed a Normal distribution, as
described earlier. Second, that for each sample and within each phase, the calendar
date followed a uniform (ﬂat) distribution. This is just like the equal base rate
184
15
Radiocarbon Dating

assumptions seen in many of the earlier applications. Third, the evidence from
different samples are assumed to be statistically independent; another familiar
assumption.7
The results of the analysis are probability distributions for each of the
fourteen dates. Figure 15.12 shows the intervals within which ninety-ﬁve percent
of each distribution falls (horizontal line) and the most likely value, the mode or
peak of each distribution (circle). The dates are calendar years.
The top bar of each pair shows the probability estimate of the start date and the
bottom bar the end date.

One of the beneﬁts of having these probabilistic estimates is that the possibility of
overlaps can be evaluated, particularly as it effects Muchique phases 2, 3 and
4. Zeidler, Buck and Litton found that
the probability that Muchique 2 completely precedes Muchique 3 is about 60%
it is almost certain that Muchique 2 completely precedes Muchique 4
the probability that Muchique 3 completely precedes Muchique 4 is almost 50%
Based on these and other evaluations they therefore felt it reasonable to conclude
that Muchique 2 precedes Muchique 4 but that the existence of the other overlaps
between these three phases remain uncertain.

Using Bayes’ Rule for the interpretation of archaeological and radiocarbon data
enabled both phasing and dating information to be brought together in one unifying
framework
likelihood
enabled an estimate of the calendar date in probability form to
be found from the evidence of the radiocarbon date

enabled what was known about the sequencing of the seven
phases to be used as part of the date determination
There has, of course, been much subsequent work, both in the archaeology of
Ecuador [9] and in the application of Bayesian analysis to archaeological prob-
lems,9 including in the estimation of calibration curves [10].

Chapter 16
Bayes and the Law
Say “evidence” and crime and the law are likely to be the ﬁrst things that come to
mind. You would expect Bayes thinking to be particularly useful both to police in
sifting evidence and to lawyers and others in court who have to use that evidence.
We saw some of this in the very ﬁrst chapter of this book. Now we’ll look in a little
more detail at some problems in the courtroom.
Unlike other applications in this section this is not a straightforward success story.
The history of the use of statistics and probability, and then Bayes’ Rule, by witnesses
and lawyers has not always been a happy, or even a competent, experience. But
Bayes arguments have been important in making clear errors in the use of evidence.
Getting something useful done to improve the situation is another thing entirely.
~ • ~
A trial involves a number of people; lawyers, judges, eyewitnesses, expert wit-
nesses, and last, but by no means least, the jury (If there is one. South Africa, for
instance, does not rely on juries).
All are there because of the need to make a decision based on evidence. Much
evidence is subject to some degree of uncertainty, for example identifying that the
shoe print found at the crime scene was made by a shoe owned by the accused. It
would be natural to talk about the uncertainties of this sort of evidence by giving
probabilities but, as we saw in Chap. 10, we are not particularly well equipped to use
this language. Expert witnesses, particularly forensic experts, can in most cases give
probability estimates but what do the lawyers, the judge and, crucially, the jury make
of it all? There are a number of well known cases which show the difﬁculties [1].

Steve and Sally Clark were two young lawyers living in Chester, in the North of
England. They had two children, both of whom died soon after birth. Christopher
died in 1996 aged ten weeks. Harry died in 1998 aged eight weeks.
Because such tragic events are, thankfully, unusual we look for reasons. It is
human nature to do so. Both deaths could have been accidental as the result of Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome, SIDS, also called cot death. One such death is a tragedy.

Perhaps two cot deaths are so rare that a more likely explanation may be that the
deaths were not accidental at all and that both boys had been killed by their mother.
In 1999 Sally Clark was tried for murder.
A key witness for the prosecution was the leading paediatrician Sir Roy
Meadow. He gave expert testimony that there was only a 1 in 73 million chance
of two cot deaths in the same family. This was taken to be so very small that it
provided overwhelming support for the charge of murder. Sally Clark was found
guilty and sent to prison.
In 2000 Sally Clark appealed on two grounds. First, that in calculating his ﬁgure
of 1 in 73 million Meadow had made an assumption of statistical independence and
that this was not valid. Second, that the jury may well have misinterpreted
Meadow’s ﬁgure to be the probability that she was innocent, which it was not.
~ • ~
Meadow used ﬁgures taken from the Conﬁdential Enquiry for Stillbirths and Deaths
in Infancy, CESDI, which was based on data from ﬁve regions of England for the
period 1993–1996. This gave the chance of cot death as 1 in 1300. For an afﬂuent
non-smoking family with the mother over twenty-six, which the Clarks were, this
chance fell to 1 in 8500. Meadow took this ﬁgure and, on the assumption that cot
deaths were independent of each other, simply multiplied to give a probability of
(1/8500)  (1/8500) or 1 in 73 million. (Lawyers prefer to express uncertainty using
odds such as these rather than as probabilities, ﬁnding them more comprehensible,
especially for very small probabilities.)
What causes cot deaths? Since siblings are genetically similar, the possibility
that there is some genetic inﬂuence on cot deaths is important. In fact there is such a
genetic predisposition. Once we know that the ﬁrst death was caused in this way the
chance that the second death was also a cot death is higher, between 1 in 60 and 1 in
130. Say 1 in 100. Using this ﬁgure the probability of two cot deaths is
(1/8500)  (1/100) which is 1 in 850,000, a very long way from 1 in 73 million.
Meadow’s error was to overlook this possibility and to assume that the two deaths
were statistically independent.
Even so, a 1 in 850,000 chance, just 0.00012%, might still be taken as small
enough that a jury will think guilt all but certain. But they would be wrong. To see
why use a little Bayes thinking (Fig. 16.1).

Bayes and the Law

Meadow had incorrectly calculated the likelihood of two cot deaths. But even
correcting for that the jury might easily mistake what they heard. They may confuse
the probability of two deaths given that they were accidental and Sally Clark
innocent, which Meadow gave, with the probability that Sally Clark was innocent
given that the two deaths had happened, which he had not. If they thought they had
heard Meadow give the second, and being impressed by just how very small that
probability was, they might unjustiﬁably conclude that Sally Clark had murdered
her sons.
The Appeal Court accepted the ﬁrst objection, that the assumption of indepen-
dence was unjustiﬁed, but rejected the second. The judges said that it was “stating
the obvious” that the two probabilities were not the same. The appeal was dismissed.
~ • ~
It was at this point that statisticians became alarmed. Professor Peter Green, in his
role as President of the Royal Statistical Society, RSS, wrote to the Lord Chancel-
lor, England’s senior law ofﬁcer, setting out objections to Meadow’s evidence.1
In addition, Professor Ray Hill of the University of Salford looked at the CESDI
report and gave a better estimate of the probabilities of the cot deaths [2].
In 2003 there was a second appeal. The defence ﬁrst presented evidence of a blood
test obtained by the original pathologist that Harry was suffering from a respiratory
infection at the time of his death. The Clark’s ﬁrst child almost certainly died of natural
causes. The blood test report, from Macclesﬁeld Hospital, had not been made available
at the original trial or the subsequent appeal. On the second day of this second appeal,
following the evidence of the blood test, the prosecution told the judges that it no
longer sought to uphold the convictions. In its judgement the Court of Appeal criticised
Meadow’s original evidence as “manifestly wrong” and “grossly misleading”.
Sally Clark was freed.
After her release Sally Clark found it hard to come to terms with what had
happened. She died in 2007 from alcohol poisoning.
~ • ~
Although Sally Clark’s acquittal was, in the event, due to the failure to make known
the results of the blood test her case raised important statistical issues. Let’s go back
to the original trial.

Likelihoods must be as accurate as we can make them or all else is wrong too.
The RSS letter warned that the Clarks had not been characterised independently of
the way in which the data had been described; afﬂuent, non-smoking, mother over
twenty-six. They had been put in an already deﬁned subset of the CESDI data.
The RSS said that it would have been better to use the chance of 1 in 1303
characteristic of the whole population. Had that been done the ﬁgure of 1 in
73 million would have become 1 in 600,000. In addition, recognising the genetic
predisposition to cot death and so using the greater probability of the second death
gives an increased likelihood of (1/1300)  (1/100) which is 1 in 130,000, or
0.00077%. This is a very long way from Meadow’s ﬁgure of 1 in 73 million.
The Bayes Grid also makes it clear that something is missing. We have the
likelihood of two early deaths if the cause was SIDS but we have no similar
likelihood if the cause was murder. It is fundamental that it is the relative values
of likelihoods that is important: we need both.
The Home Ofﬁce estimates that fewer than 30 babies are killed by their mother
each year. There are 650,000 births a year and so the probability that a baby is
murdered is no bigger than 30/650,000. Double murders are much less common.
Helen Joyce, then Editor of Cambridge University’s Plus magazine, argued for a
probability of double murder smaller by a factor of ten [3] to give a probability of
0.00046% that both Christopher and Harry were murdered. This is a conservative
estimate.
With both likelihoods we can complete the Bayes Grid (Fig. 16.2).
The conclusion justiﬁed by the data is that there is only a 38% chance that the
two boys were murdered.
Sally Clark was most probably innocent. Even though some approximations
were used to get the likelihoods (Helen Joyce’s use of the factor of ten to account
for double murder, for instance) it is unlikely that any plausible alternative assump-
tions would increase the 38% so much that the jury could reasonably conclude that
Sally Clark was guilty “beyond all reasonable doubt”, which is what English
criminal law requires.

Bayes and the Law

Meadow had made a quite basic error when he assumed that two cot deaths were
statistically independent and so just squared the probability of one death. It should
have been obvious to an expert, which Meadow was, that this strong assumption
needed to be supported by evidence. Not all expert witnesses are also expert in
statistics.
In 2005 The General Medical Council, GMC, found that Sir Roy Meadow’s
misuse of statistics in the Sally Clark trial amounted to serious professional
misconduct and struck him from the medical register which meant that he could
no longer practice. Meadow appealed and in the following year the High Court
found in his favour, concluding that the GMC had properly been critical of his
performance as an expert witness but wrong in concluding that this constituted
serious professional misconduct. He was reinstated and could practice again,
though he retired soon after.
~ • ~
In the trial of Sally Clark there was never any suggestion that her children could have
been murdered by anyone else: either Sally Clark murdered her children or they died
of SIDS. This is not always the case. For example, if the only evidence is the imprint
of a shoe of particular type and size and the accused has such a shoe, the defence may
reasonably say that there must surely be a great many other people in the city or the
country also possessing shoes of just this type and size. To disregard this base rate
information is the same error that a doctor would make if the prevalence of a disease
or illness in the population were ignored when making a diagnosis (Chap. 8).
A careless but eager prosecutor may make two potentially misleading mistakes in
presenting evidence to a jury. First, mistaking just what probabilities mean, as in the
Sally Clark case, and confusing the probability that the deaths occurred given that
Clark was innocent with the probability that she was innocent given the deaths. This
is called the error of the transposed conditional. Second, base rates may be ignored.
William Thompson and Edward Schumann named such false reasoning The Prose-
cutor’s Fallacy [4]. It has become common to use The Prosecutor’s Fallacy to mean
only the ﬁrst error, the transposed conditional.
Evidence based on DNA analysis is increasingly used in trials (not just in those
television police shows). Surely the precision of DNA proﬁling will give such good
evidence that it will swamp any of these concerns in just the same way that an
estimate based on a large survey will swamp any prior belief, as we saw in
Chap. 14. But will it? Suppose that, based on a DNA sample, the probability that
it was from the accused is one in a million. This sounds convincing. Suppose again
that it is known that the crime was committed by a man older than about twenty but
not more than mid-sixties. There are about twenty million men in this age group in
the UK any of whom may provide a match to the DNA found at the crime scene.
What is the Court to make of this?

In November 1989 a 65 year old woman was sexually assaulted in her home at
Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester. A year later Alan James Doheny was
tried at Manchester Crown Court where he was convicted of this assault and
sentenced to eight years imprisonment. In 1991 this was increased on appeal to
twelve years.
The prosecution case relied heavily on the evidence of an expert witness that
DNA found at the crime scene matched Doheny’s DNA.
DNA consists of two intertwined strands (the double helix), one from the mother
and one from the father. Think of each strand as a code. The code has four elements
or chemical bases: A (adenine), G (guanine), C (cytosine), and T (thymine) and
might look something like this GTAATCCGA. . .
The code for human DNA is three billion characters long. 99.9% of our DNA is
common to us all. The other 0.1% is highly variable between individuals. It this
0.1%, or part of it, which is used.
A strand is divided into a number of sections of code. These are called locations
and are given names such as D21 or D7S280. It is possible that at some locations
short sections of code are repeated. For example in the section below the four
characters GATA (shown in capitals) are repeated four times
gtatcaactattgtacccggaacgGATAGATAGATAGATActgttacatgggagcaga
If at the same location on the other strand GATA were repeated six times the
proﬁle at this location would be given as the pair 4,6.
These short repeating sequences such as GATA are called Short Tandem Repeats
(STRs) or markers. STRs are usually of length four but other lengths are sometimes
used. A DNA proﬁle using four locations might look like that shown in Fig. 16.3.
It is the job of the forensic scientist to compare two proﬁles—one from the crime
scene and one from the suspect—and decide whether there is a match or not.
The process of analysis causes repetitions of the STRs around their original
locations (loci) which has the effect of blurring the proﬁle. These repetitions are
called stutters and the blurred location is a stutter band.
The sample taken from a suspect by mouth swab should be well deﬁned. The
sample taken at the crime scene may be degraded due to the age of the sample,
contamination at the crime scene, or attempts by the perpetrator to remove traces of
ﬂuids or other deposits from which DNA might be found. In addition, laboratory
procedures are sometimes imperfect.
To reduce the chance of error when comparing two DNA samples more than one
marker (location) is tested, typically thirteen nowadays but fewer at the time
Doheny was arrested. If the crime scene sample is degraded fewer markers may
be available for comparison.

If we can be sure that two proﬁles do not match then we can be sure they are from
different sources. If they do match it is highly likely that they are from the same
source. But since not all possible markers are examined, there is always a small
chance that this proﬁle is shared with someone else.
The analysis enables an estimate of the proportion of a population, or group
within that population, with the same proﬁle as that found at the crime scene. This is
the match probability or random occurrence ratio, also sometimes called the
random match probability.2

In the trial of Alan Doheny the prosecution case relied mostly on DNA evidence.
An expert witness, a Mr. Davie, gave the results of a comparison of the DNA from a
blood sample given by Doheny and that found in semen stains at the crime scene.
Two different tests were made. The ﬁrst test used a multi locus probe in which
samples were taken from a number of loci but the precise locations could not be
identiﬁed. This test produced six matching bands. One was discarded to eliminate
overlap with the results of the second test, which will be described later. Using the
other ﬁve gave a random occurrence ratio of 1 in 840.
The multi locus probe had been superseded by the single locus probe which uses
resultstakenfromknownlocationsintheDNA.Threesinglelocustestswere made.Two
each gave two matching bands and the third test gave one. Analysis of these ﬁve
matching bands gave a random occurrence ratio of 1 in 6900. (This ratio would have
been even smaller had thirteen locations been used, as is now common.) Davie multi-
plied the results of both tests to give a ratio of 1 in 5.7 million. Another expert witness,
Miss Holmes, had testiﬁed that Doheny’s blood group was shared by 1 in 7 of the
population. Mr. Davie used this too as statistically independent evidence to give, ﬁnally,
a random occurrence ratio of (1/840)  (1/6900)  (1/7) which is 1 in 40.6 million.
Having presented the results of each of his analyses the following exchange took
place between Mr. Davie and prosecuting counsel:
Q: What is the combination, taking all those into account?
A: Taking them all into account, I calculated the chance of ﬁnding all of those bands and
the conventional blood group to be about 1 in 40 million.
Q: The likelihood of it being anyone other than Alan Doheny?
A: Is about 1 in 40 million.
Q: You deal habitually with these things, the jury has to say, of course, on the evidence,
whether they are satisﬁed beyond doubt that it is he. You have done the analysis, are
you sure that it is he?
A: Yes.
This sequence of questions and answers was to have great signiﬁcance. And you
can see why.

Five years after the original trial, in July 1996, a second appeal, submitted for
Doheny, was heard in the Court of Appeal by Lord Justice Phillips, Mr. Justice Jowitt
and Mr. Justice Keen. The grounds for appeal were that “the verdict of the jury was
unsafe because the forensic evidence was presented to the jury in a misleading and
inaccurate manner and because the substance of that evidence was incorrect.”
The judgement, written by Lord Justice Phillips,3 is of interest because of the
way it dealt with statistical aspects of the presentation of DNA evidence. We’ll
return to that. The decision of the Appeal Court judges rested on three arguments
First, that the cross examination of Mr. Davie given above, and in particular the
ﬁnal question and answer, were clear examples of The Prosecutor’s Fallacy. Mr
Davie had provided no evidence on which to base his “Yes”. The question should
not have been put. The presentation of the DNA evidence in this exchange was
“inappropriate and potentially misleading”.
Second, that the summing up of the evidence in the original trial had been at
fault. Evidence had been given by Miss Holmes that a pubic hair found at the crime
scene belonged neither to the victim nor to Doheny. In his summing up of the
evidence the judge had quite rightly reminded the jury of this. Of Mr. Davie’s
evidence he said that “. . .in the end his opinion was that his tests were reliable and
they did show that the chances of Mr. Doheny not being the person responsible was
so remote as to be possible to discount entirely for all practical purposes.” The
Appeal judges were critical because it is for the jury, not the judge, to weigh the
evidence, even though they were likely to have reached the same conclusion.
Third, that the DNA evidence was faulty. Expert testimony provided by
Doheny’s counsel at the Appeal raised doubts about Mr. Davie’s calculations
themselves. The argument was that there was a chance that the two tests, the
multi locus and single locus methods, may have identiﬁed one or more of the
same bands. In this case the results cannot be statistically independent and so the
simple multiplication of Mr. Davie would give an incorrect random occurrence
ratio. Mr. Davie had seen one such duplication and for this reason reduced from six
to ﬁve the number of bands used in the analysis of the results of the multi locus
probe. The test material had been preserved and so could be re-examined. On the
second day of the Appeal counsel for the Crown conceded the point. The effect was
to increase the estimate of the random occurrence ratio by a factor of four from 1 in
40 million to 1 in 10 million. Doheny’s counsel made other criticisms of the
treatment of the multi locus test results including that there was no justiﬁcation
for simply multiplying the different results of those tests.
The Appeal judges concluded that Doheny’s conviction “is unsafe and must be
quashed”.

Bayes and the Law

At the time of the appeal Doheny had already served over half of his sentence and so
was eligible for parole. He was released and awarded £125,000 in compensation
(some reports say more).
In 1998 he was again jailed for rape. He was released in 2004.
In 2010 he sexually attacked a woman in Manchester city centre. The following
year Bolton Crown Court found him guilty and gave an indeterminate sentence for
the protection of the public, with a recommendation that he should serve no less
than four years.
The quashing of the original sentence was irrelevant to Doheny’s subsequent
offences—he was due for parole anyway. This case, speciﬁcally the appeal, has
been much cited because of the arguments used by Lord Justice Phillips and his
colleagues in reaching their decision.
~ • ~
Two errors were common to Doheny’s trial and that of Sally Clark: the confusion of
the probabilities in the cross examination, the ﬁrst part of The Prosecutor’s Fallacy,
the transposed conditional, and unjustiﬁed assumptions of independence. What is
new here is an argument about base rates.
In the Appeal judgement it had been recommended that the result of the multi
locus test should have been disregarded. Had this been done the random occurrence
ratio would have been the product of the ratios of the single probe tests, 1 in 6900,
and the blood group, 1 in 7, which would have given 1 in 48,300. The judgement
noted that between experts there were
. . .different approaches to applying the data contained in the population data base used to
calculate the results of the tests. Happily we do not have to attempt to resolve this issue, for
it is not sufﬁciently signiﬁcant to affect the result of this appeal.
The relevant position is this. If one excludes from the calculation the result of the multi
locus probe test, in a population base of 800,000 suggested as constituting those within a
reasonable proximity of the scene of the crime, there may well have been 20 or so
individuals with the same DNA proﬁle as the Appellant and as the crime stain. This ﬁgure
still renders it an extremely unlikely coincidence that both the Appellant and another of this
small cohort should have been in the vicinity of the crime at about the time that it was
committed, the more so when one postulates that this other individual would also have had
to share with the Appellant the other attributes—general appearance, age and local
accent—that the complainant described in her assailant.
Lord Justice Phillips has rounded the ratio of 1 in 48,300 to 1 in 40,000
(0.0025%). In a population of 800,000 twenty individuals, of which Doheny was
one, might have been guilty of the assault.
The different approaches to which Phillips refers are made clear by using the full
Bayes Grid in Fig. 16.4.

Bayes and the Law
197

If Doheny was innocent the match probability is 0.0025%. If he was guilty the
match would have been certain. But what was it justiﬁable to think before taking
account of the DNA (and blood type) result? What were the appropriate base rates?
In the case of Sally Clark there were no other suspects and so on grounds of
impartiality there was no initial view (a jury must have no initial view) that she
was guilty or not. Equal base rates encode this impartiality (Fig. 16.5).
Can this thinking be applied to Doheny? The prosecutor might think so and
argue the same impartiality and so equal base rates. The result depends only on the
DNA match and so, unsurprisingly, the evidence looks compelling (Fig. 16.6).

Bayes and the Law

The defence could argue differently. 800,000 people live close enough to the
crime scene that they could have committed the assault. Doheny is one of these so,
without any evidence, the chance that he is guilty is 1 in 800,000 or only 0.00013%.
This is the correct base rate to use, they will say, it is the only logical place to start.
Now, with the DNA evidence as well the probability is just ﬁve percent (the 1 in
20 that Phillips gives) that Doheny committed the assault (Fig. 16.7), hardly enough
to justify a guilty verdict.
We are in a tricky but familiar situation. The problem structure which the Bayes
Grid has given has made us ask the question but it is still up to us to provide the
answer. Once the possibility is raised that others may have been guilty we ask “Yes,
but how many?” Doheny’s defence estimated the ﬁgure to be 800,000, based on
proximity to the crime scene. The police could have checked the DNA with the
national DNA database to look for a match. This database holds DNA proﬁles for
about one in ten of the UK population. In March 2015 it held proﬁles for 5,766,369
individuals.4 Perhaps we should start there, with the size of the database. After all,
the attacker may have been passing through and live somewhere else. So why not
take the population of the whole country?
Demonstrating the effect is easy because a convenient assumption can be used to
make the methodological point, for example and hypothetically, that the crime
happens in a closed island community [6]. But what to do in practice?

Whatever we decide the relevant population to be5 the number is reduced by
other evidence such as a regional accent, age and so on. As the number of potential
suspects decreases the probability that Doheny, or any one of the other potential
suspects, is guilty increases (Fig. 16.8).
What can the jury do? They will form a view, indeed they must form a view, that
is their job. They will have to evaluate each of the pieces of evidence which has
been presented to them by lawyers for the defence and prosecution and then
combine these somehow to move towards a verdict. Neither is easy.
~ • ~
Lord Justice Phillips talks of other evidence reducing the 800,000. But that other
evidence is not free from error. For example, about a third of eyewitness identiﬁ-
cations are wrong [8], though not all lead to a conviction.
Reducing the number of potential suspects is not without difﬁculty.
Most evidence is inherently subject to some uncertainty but for many years this
was not thought to be much of a problem. Expert witnesses gave their opinions
usually using words to convey the levels of uncertainty in, say, matching shoeprints
or blood types. If probabilities were given they were not extreme and so, it was
thought, not remote from the experience of jurors. Whether jurors (or any of us)
really can cope with interpreting and then combining probabilities is, of course,
doubtful as we saw in Chap. 10. But that was the view.
That started to change with DNA evidence and match probabilities of one in
several million. It was clear that these probabilities were incomprehensibly small,
way beyond everyday experience. Lawyers in court and their expert witnesses had
Fig. 16.8 Base rates and suspects

200
16
Bayes and the Law

carefully to explain to juries what these probabilities meant but this proved to be no
easy task, as the appeals of Clark and Doheny showed.
The judicial view of probability could sometimes be hard to fathom as the
following two examples show [9]. This is from a case heard in the Family Division
of the High Court in England in 1981
The concept of ‘probability’ in the legal sense is certainly different from the mathematical
concept: indeed it is rare to ﬁnd a situation in which these two usages co-exist, although
when they do, the mathematical probability has to be taken into the assessment of
probability in the legal sense and given appropriate weight.
and this from the High Court of Australia in 1984
If the proposition’s validity depends upon logic, and the resolution of a philosophical
debate, it seems to me that it cannot properly be characterised as a rule of law. Its validity
certainly does not stem from any statutory provision; nor, in my view, can it be argued that
its assertion as a proposition of logic in otherwise binding judgments gives it the force of
law. If it were shown to be not logically valid, then it could not apply. That would not be the
position with a rule of law.
However we interpret these pronouncements they certainly indicate that some
judges, and lawyers presumably, made a distinction between reasoning based on
numbers which are themselves based on data, and other ways of reasoning to be
used with non-numerical evidence. There may also have been an awareness that
arguments based on numbers may be privileged over arguments which were not
numerical and that this might lead to “trial by statistics”. The judge at Sally Clark’s
trial, Mr. Justice Harrison, put it this way: “. . .we do not convict people in these
courts on statistics. It would be a terrible day if that were so.” While this may
sometimes be dismissed as a reactionary view we should be careful. Not privileging
the quantitative requires ﬁne judgement and an awareness of the danger. This is not
easy. But, equally, this does not mean that the quantitative should be disregarded.
Perhaps it would be helpful to express the quantitative weight of evidence in
words. The Association of Forensic Science Providers [10] suggests a lexicon
(Table 16.1) to show the strength of support provided for a given proposition.6

16
Bayes and the Law
201

Would this really be an improvement? The expert witness may say that the evidence
is “moderate” meaning a likelihood ratio between one in ten and one in a hundred, but
what would the juror take it to mean? In addition, we can’t do calculations with words:
combining evidence with different likelihood ratios expressed in words may not be
straightforward. It may well be easier for judges and lawyers and jurors to hear words
rather than numbers, but does it help in weighing evidence and reaching a decision? It’s
hard to see that it does (hard for me, at least).
~ • ~
The principle on which the system of justice rests is that a jury of peers of the accused
hears the evidence and then weighs that evidence and ﬁnally comes to a decision.
How they do all that is left to them; nothing should interfere with their deliberations.
The opinion written for the Adams appeal we saw in Chap. 2 makes the point
. . . to introduce Bayes Theorem, or any similar method, into a criminal trial plunges the jury
into inappropriate and unnecessary realms of theory and complexity deﬂecting them from
their proper task.
It would be the view of many statisticians that using Bayes’ Rule, far from
deﬂecting the jury, will help them to use the evidence to reach a decision in a
rational way. But as well as this general objection—that using some mathematical
reasoning is at odds with the very idea of a jury trial—there remains the question of
whether, and if so how, judgemental assessments might best be used. Here is Lord
Justice Phillips again
In the light of the strong criticism by this court in the 1990s of using Bayes theorem before
the jury in cases where there was no reliable statistical evidence, the practice of using a
Bayesian approach and likelihood ratios to formulate opinions placed before a jury without
that process being disclosed and debated in court is contrary to principles of open justice.
By “reliable statistical evidence” he means data-based numbers such as match
probabilities. Before dealing with anything which might be an opinion he wants the
method used—Bayes’ Rule—to be debated in court so that both prosecution and
defence may agree as to the appropriateness of the method.
A clear division is being drawn between the presentation of evidence and the
way in which the jury puts it all together to arrive at a decision. Evidence is given by
experts who are open to cross examination. A computation using Bayes’ Rule (or an
alternative) cannot be cross examined, but a proponent of its use can be: a theory
cannot be cross examined but a theoretician can. We might think of this person as
an expert witness on statistical method in just the same way that a forensic scientist
is considered an expert on DNA analysis. Other experts may be called to give
evidence from an alternative, perhaps opposing, view. It would be foolish to assert
that there is unanimity among statisticians about the use of Bayes’ Rule in the way
that there is among forensic scientists about evidence based on DNA or blood
samples. And so you may agree with the position that probabilities are suitable for
presenting evidence [11] but not for reasoning with that evidence.
And yet. . .
~ • ~

Bayes and the Law

What happens in the jury room is known only to the jurors. A number of studies
have simulated jury deliberations by using mock juries made up of students or jury-
eligible people. Typically there are two stages. The jury is given a description of the
charge and some evidence which does not include probabilities. The jury gives its
probability that the accused is guilty. More evidence is then provided which does
use probabilities. Because DNA match probabilities are so very small these are
usually avoided. Other more comprehensible evidence, such as shoeprints and
blood types, is preferred. Having considered this new evidence the mock jury
then gives a revised probability of guilt. This is compared with the revised proba-
bility found using Bayes’ Rule (Fig. 16.9).
Even though these simulations may be criticised because of their artiﬁciality
there does seem to be a consistent pattern: that mock jurors do not update their
initial assessments (base rates) as much as Bayes’ Rule suggests they should. In
other words, they are conservative in their use of evidence.
Interestingly, in some of these simulations using jury eligible subjects those with
a college education were more likely to revise their judgements in line with Bayes
recommendations [13].
Which is to be preferred, the analysis of Bayes’ Rule or the decision making of
the human jury? Rationality or accountability?
It is easy enough to make the case for using Bayes as a decision aid. Let the
calculations be made according to Bayes rationality, by computer or calculator, and
let the jury determine likelihoods and base rates, perhaps changing these values in a
sensitivity analysis, and in that way arrive at a decision for which they are prepared
to be held to account, even if only by themselves.
This sort of decision aiding happens frequently, in arriving at business decisions,
for example. There are cogent objections to its use in the jury room. Most obviously
Fig. 16.9 Jurors’ judgements are conservative7

16
Bayes and the Law
203

that, almost certainly, a facilitator would be needed and this would change the very
nature of the deliberation. The concentration on the numerical using methods which
may be hard for some jurors to understand may bias outcomes by devaluing the
qualitative. Then again, the relations between the different pieces of evidence may
involve more than just multiplying base rates and likelihoods. There are ways in
which these more complex interactions can be modelled [14, 15] but, useful as they
might be, the effect would be to make the job of the jurors even more like that of
analysts or clients of analysts.
You may think this to be a wholly desirable development or you may fear that
the authority of the jury will have been undermined by the use of a model and by
making explicit how their decision is reached. Compromise is likely to be easier
using only the ambiguities and imprecision of language.
There seems to be a growing consensus that for forensic and other expert
witnesses Bayesian analysis is a useful addition to the methods at their disposal.
But as to whether Bayes could or should help that ﬁnal decision, the jury is still out,
as they say.
~ • ~
Weighing all the evidence, some of which is statistical and some not, is not easy and
so properly presenting that statistical evidence is important. This is where some
Bayes thinking helps.
This is not an issue conﬁned to the courtroom. An unknown number of athletes
take banned performance enhancing drugs. Some are caught. In 1988 the sprinter
Ben Johnson was stripped of the gold medal he had been awarded for the 100m
sprint at the Seoul Olympics.
Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times from 1999 to 2005. In
2012 these titles were removed because of his use of drugs.
The continuing difﬁculties besetting athletics and other sports are too numerous
to list. You will probably recall that Russia was not allowed to participate in the Rio
Olympics
And so it goes.
All of which makes the correct presentation of the results of drugs testing as
necessary as it is in a court of law. The same difﬁculties arise, not least The
Prosecutor’s Fallacy [16, 17]. Confusion over what evidence means is not conﬁned
to the courtroom.

Bayes’ Rule and the Bayes Grid provide a rational way of using evidence to update

how to use the evidence obtained. But how were the tests chosen? We’d like to
make that selection rationally too.
Often there is no decision to be made because only one test is practically
available. But when there are options we must decide: which test to select?
Philosophers and psychologists have for a long time been concerned with this
problem of what it means to be rational when making a selection. The usual advice
is to use the rules of formal logic, a form of argument dating back to Aristotle. This
deals with the relations between propositions and statements which are either true
or false. It is unlike Bayesian reasoning which deals with uncertainty measured as
probability. Here is an example using two-valued logic.
To reduce the long list of applicants for a job use two criteria, education and
experience. Education is indicated by whether or not the candidate has a degree.
Experience is indicated by at least ﬁve years of relevant work. Think of these as
two propositions, that the applicant has degree and that the applicant has expe-
rience. Each proposition is either true or false. We can select in one of two ways.
The stricter is to choose only those candidates who satisfy both conditions; they
have experience AND a degree. If this is thought too strict applicants can be
chosen for the next stage in the selection process if they meet either criterion;
they have experience OR a degree. These two logical conditions are shown in the
Table 17.1.
The AND condition is satisﬁed, is true, only if both has degree and has experience
are true. The OR condition is false only if both are false.
You may have come across this idea as the basis for digital computers where true
and false are coded as binary values 1 and 0. Figure 17.2 shows simple function which
takes binary inputs and delivers a binary output according to the rule in the box.
If the rule is either AND or OR then tables, just like those above, show how the
output is found from the inputs (Table 17.2).

Simple truth tables can also show the application of if. . .then rules. We use these
rules all the time
if it looks like rain then take an umbrella
if it’s too dark to read then switch on the light
and so on. These look quite trivial pieces of common sense, good advice, just follow
the rule.
But sometimes we want to test that the rule still holds. Where should we look for
useful evidence? The truth table should help by showing what follows from the rule
so that we can test if these deductions are true. Take the rule
if a bird is a swan then it is white
This can be expressed as a deduction (also a prediction) about whether or not a swan
is white based on the proposition all swans are white
all swans are white
this bird is a swan
therefore this bird is white
This form of making an inference, this bird is white, from a proposition, all swans
are white, is called a syllogism. If the rule is true we are also able to make another
deduction which tells us what to conclude if we see a bird which isn’t white
all swans are white
this bird not white
therefore this bird is not a swan
What does the truth table look like? The ﬁrst row comes straight from the rule
(Table 17.3) but what of the second row?

It is traditionally thought that other implications are also valid, for instance that
all swans are white implies that all non-swans are non-white and so the truth table
should look like Table 17.4.
While it is perfectly possible to have something which is not a swan and is white
(a snowball) or is not a swan and is not white (a ﬁre engine) it may well seem to you
a bit odd that next time you see a ﬁre engine you are at the same time conﬁrming the
rule that all swans are white. Any time you see anything which is not a swan you are
seeing conﬁrmation that all swans are white. This apparently strange state of affairs
was pointed out by the philosopher Carl Hempel [1]. To illustrate the difference
between results found by applying formal logic and those found by intuition,
Hempel used a black raven rather than a white swan, so anything not black and
not a raven (that ﬁre engine again) validated the proposition that all ravens are
black. His puzzle, Hempel’s Paradox, is also, more popularly, called the Raven
Paradox. Much argumentation followed.
Although it is easy to imagine non-swans they are of no practical value in testing
the rule. Sometimes, as we shall see, it may not even be clear that a rule allows us
usefully to complete the second row of the table. We can signal this possibility as
shown in Table 17.5. We may, as in this case, be able to answer the questions, or we
may not.
In both tables the only way in which the proposition that all swans are white can
be falsiﬁed is to ﬁnd a non-white swan. You could do this either by noting the colour
of swans or looking at non-white things in the hope of ﬁnding a swan. Both tactics
hold out the possibility of falsiﬁcation, but you are likely to waste less time by
noting the colour of swans, and to be a little surprised if you ﬁnd one that was not
white.
And, as you know already, this is just what happened.
Before Europeans landed in Australia they did indeed believe that all swans were
white, but in 1636 the Dutch mariner Antounie Caen saw black swans at Shark Bay,
in what is now Western Australia. Some time later, in 1697, another Dutchman,

The Selection Task

Willem de Vlamingh, captured two of the birds and returned with them to prove
their existence to sceptical Europeans. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a former derivatives
trader and now Professor of Risk Engineering at NYU, used this event for the title
of his 2007 book The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable since when
Black Swan has become shorthand for an unforeseen and high impact event.
This form of if. . .then argument both gives a rule to follow and also shows where
to look for evidence which might falsify the rule. This all looks pretty clear, so
what’s the problem?
~ • ~
How did you make out with that task at the start of the chapter? The task is repeated
here as Fig. 17.3 for convenience.
What did you decide? Using a truth table should help (Table 17.6).
Table 17.7 shows the partial truth table for this particular selection task shown in
Fig. 17.3.

the other side a  letter. Here is a hypothesis about the cards

It makes sense to turn two cards; the vowel, A, to see if there is an odd number on
the reverse side, and the odd number, 7, to see if there is a vowel on the reverse.
This selection task was devised about ﬁfty years ago by Peter Wason of
University College [2]. He wanted to investigate the difﬁculty which many of us
have in making this apparently simple selection. The logic of the truth table was
taken as the correct recommendation.
There are ﬁfteen possible answers to the question asked in the task: four different
single card selections, six pairs, four triples and one selection of all four. The
selection recommended by the truth table is one of the pairs, turn cards A and
7. This was not what happened. Fully half of the Wason’s subjects chose the cards A
and 4. Wason suggested that this was because they thought it seemed to follow
directly from the rule; the rule was about nouns and even numbers and so it was
thought natural to look at those cards. This is a form of conﬁrmation bias. Very few
subjects, about one in six, chose the odd card, 7, either alone or in combination with
others. Most people weren’t seeking evidence to falsify. Making the same selection
as logic recommends was a rarity.
Wason and Diana Shapiro summarised the results of four experiments, 128 student
subjects in all [3] (Not all versions of the experiment used the same letters. A, D,
4 and 7 will stand as shorthand for vowels and consonants and odd and even numbers
more generally). Table 17.8 shows what they found.
These results demonstrate a very strong instinct to verify rather than falsify. It
certainly seems that we are not natural logicians. But then we are not often faced
with abstract problems such as thinking about letters and numbers written on cards.

Why would we do that? Recognising this, Wason and Shapiro conducted another
experiment in which subjects (students again) were allocated to one of two groups.
One group had the abstract reasoning task with letters and numbers, as before. The
other group were also shown cards but with place names on one side (Manchester,
Leeds) and travel modes (car, train) on the other and were asked to test the
experimenter’s claim that Every time I go to Manchester I travel by car. There
were sixteen students in each group. As expected, in the ﬁrst abstract task (letters
and numbers) group performance was poor. Only two gave the logically correct
solution. In the group with the thematic task (cities and travel modes) this increased
to ten correct solutions. The two tasks were formally equivalent but a more realistic
framing helped a lot. (We saw something of the framing effect in Chap. 8 with the
two forms of question about the serum test for Down’s syndrome.)
Perhaps the experimental results of the abstract version of the task show not so
much an inability to reason as that unfamiliarity makes reasoning hard. Given a
familiar contextual framework subjects may be freed from having to worry about
the meaning of cards marked with letters and numbers and so can use more of their
cognitive and reasoning capacity to think about what to do. It was easy to envisage
what travelling to Manchester meant. Thinking abstractedly just is not something
we humans are used to doing, even psychology students.
It is plausible that most of us will be more familiar with the idea of collecting and
analysing data than we are with applying syllogistic reasoning. We are quite used to
hearing of opinion polls, drugs tests, and market research. Wason and Shapiro
thought that although the subjects in their abstract task were told that the rule
referred only to the four cards before them they “may, in fact, have regarded the
cards as items in a sample from a larger universe, and reasoned about them
inductively rather than deductively. In doing this they may have implicitly followed
the Bayesian rule which assumes that the probability of a generalization is
increased by repetition of conﬁrming instances.” We’ll return to this thought.
~ • ~
This idea that performance of the selection task improves if it is framed in a more
familiar way was taken up by Philip Johnson-Laird, a colleague of Wason’s at
University College, with Paulo and Maria Legrenzi from the Instituto Superiore di
Scienzi Sociale in Trento [4]. At the time of their experiment, 1971, it was the case
that both in Britain and in Italy a letter could be posted more cheaply if the envelope
was not sealed and so the version of the selection task used asked subjects to imagine
that they were postal workers and that their job was to ensure that letters conﬁrmed
the following rule: If a letter is sealed it has a 50 lire stamp on it (5d in Britain, about
2p in new money). Instead of cards four envelopes were used. The face side showed
the address and either a 40 lire or 50 lire stamp. The reverse side showed that the
envelope was either sealed or not. This task was attempted only after subjects had
given their solutions to the original symbolic letters-and-numbers task. The results
were similar to those found by Wason and Shapiro. Of the twenty-four students at
University College seventeen gave incorrect solutions to the symbolic task but
17
The Selection Task
213

seventeen gave the correct solution to the realistic mail task. Whether the rule was for
British or Italian mail made no signiﬁcant difference.
It certainly seemed that a realistic framing of the task enabled a better perfor-
mance. In 1981 Richard Griggs and James Cox of the University of Florida reported
the results of their experiments, again with undergraduate subjects [5]. They
reported three experiments with similar setups to that used by Johnson-Laird and
his colleagues. The ﬁrst experiment used the cities and transport mode version, for
these American students Miami/Atlanta and plane/car. Only three of the thirty-
two students gave the solution recommended by logical deduction. Griggs and Cox
noted that this was consistent with reports of other experiments which had also
failed to show the improvement found by Wason and Shapiro.
The second experiment used the envelope and stamp format, with USA and
Mexico as the two postal jurisdictions. Performance was poor. This was plausibly
because there was no requirement to pay more for a sealed letter in the United States
so that students were unfamiliar with this idea.
The third experiment used a rule which certainly was familiar to students. It was
illegal for anyone under nineteen to drink alcohol. The four cards showed beer/coke
and over/under nineteen. There was a marked improvement in performance; about
three quarters of responses were in accord with syllogistic reasoning.
Griggs and Cox concluded that this was likely to be due to the memory-cueing
model which “proposes that performance on the selection task is signiﬁcantly
facilitated when the presentation of the task allows the subject to recall past
experience with the content of the problem, the relationship expressed, and a
counter-example of the rule . . .”
These results give just a ﬂavour of one of the many strands in a vast literature on
the selection task. The question which recurs is just what is being tested in the
selection task? It seems to be unarguable that if you apply the recommendation of
formal logic you are in a very small minority. It is implausible that we select cards
whimsically; something must be happening in our brain. Memory-cueing suggests a
test of recollection. Wason and Shapiro’s speculation suggests a sampling mindset.
Perhaps more is inferred from the rule than was intended, for example that if vowel
then even number also implies and if consonant then odd number. It doesn’t, but
many of us may think it does.
Is there some other account which describes what we see in the responses to the
selection task? Perhaps a little Bayes thinking would help.
~ • ~
Taking a Bayesian view means taking a quite different approach than syllogistic
reasoning. This sees the task as making deductions justiﬁed by the rule and then
looking for falsifying evidence (an idea famously proposed by Karl Popper). The
Bayesian approach uses evidence to help in deciding between different models of
the relation between letters and numbers. The plural, models, is important. Belief is
relative: how much more do I believe this explanation rather than that? If there is
214
17
The Selection Task

only one possible explanation, how can it be rejected? In favour of what? “Probably
not that one” sounds a bit weak.1
We need likelihoods and base rates. For the selection task there are no data to be
modelled by a likelihood distribution. All probabilities must be personal, descrip-
tions of what is believed to be the case. In the majority of experiments subjects do
not actually turn the cards but rather are asked what they would do. The task
resembles the planning stage of an investigation rather than the data analysis
which follows.
The work of Tversky and Kahneman, and many others, means that we should be
cautious about these personal probabilities. It will be helpful to ﬁnd how decisions
(which cards to turn) are affected by different probability assessments.
~ • ~
In 1994 Mike Oaksford and Nick Chater, then of the Universities of Wales and
Edinburgh, published a paper showing how using a Bayesian approach could give
an account of the results of selection task experiments [7].
They took the view that instead of a truth table with binary values of either true
or false it was more realistic to think that in tackling the selection problem subjects
would consider how likely were the different possible results of turning each card so
that instead of thinking
if this is a vowel there must be an even number on the other side
subjects would think
if this is a vowel what is the probability of an even number on the
other side?
The rule says that there is certain to be an even number. This is interpreted as a
probability one hundred percent. Instead of a truth table we have likelihoods, as in
the Bayes Grid (Table 17.9).
The beneﬁt of this probabilistic interpretation is that it is easier to think about
what happens if the consonant, D, is turned. Although the rule says nothing about

which you will have heard often, is based on just this reasoning. Strange but true, despite well
rehearsed objections among statisticians and other professionals [6].

this it is clear from experimental results that most people (we) do formulate a view
about what might be on the other side of the D card. For example, if we think there
is a forty percent chance that there is an even number on the back of the D card the
likelihoods are as shown in Table 17.10.
Using probabilities rather than binary true/false values allows ﬂexibility of
description. It could be that the different people will have different probability
assessments; twenty percent or thirty percent rather than forty percent. Oaksford
and Chater called this the Dependence model.
What alternatives are there to the Dependence model? The simplest is to assume
statistical independence. The probability of an even number is the same, forty
percent, for both the A and D cards; that is what independence means
(Table 11.4). Table 17.11 shows the two models.
There are an inﬁnite number of alternative models between Dependence and
Independence which could be described by altering the Independence model so that
the probability that there is a 4 on the other side of the A card is something other
than forty percent. Oaksford and Chater used just the Dependence and Indepen-
dence models. In this setup the selection task becomes one of deciding degrees of
belief in which of the two models is the more likely to be true. This is a signiﬁcant
shift from interpreting the task as one of syllogistic deduction to choosing a
description of the relation between types of letter and types of number.
To do this needs the probabilities of all four results, the four values in the table.
To ﬁnd them needs another assumption: how prevalent are vowels and consonants?
It might be thought that since there are only ﬁve vowels in the alphabet the
probability of a vowel is ﬁve out of twenty-ﬁve, about twenty percent. This assumes

some sort of sampling to select the four cards, as Wason and Shapiro thought might
be plausible, even though the task said nothing of this. Alternatively, admitting
ignorance argues for equal probabilities, ﬁfty percent for vowel and ﬁfty percent for
consonant. Suppose, by whatever reasoning, a value of thirty percent is used.
Rescaling the rows of the likelihood tables (Table 17.11) gives the 2  2 probability
distribution of all four combinations of letter and number (Table 17.12).
Turning the 4 card would reveal either a vowel, A, or a consonant, D. How likely
each result is thought to be depends on which model is used. If the Dependence
model is assumed, the probabilities of A and D appearing are 30/58 and 28/58, the
left column of the Dependence table in Table 17.12. If the Independence model is
assumed the probabilities are 12/40 and 28/40. To get likelihoods for the Bayes
Grid rescale each pair to sum to a hundred percent (Fig. 17.4).
Plausibly, there is no strong reason to believe that the Dependence model is more
or less likely to be the true description than the Independence model. As we have
seen in earlier chapters, this means equal base rates. The Bayes Grid makes the
analysis (Fig. 17.5).

If the 4 card is turned and shows an A on the reverse side we are justiﬁed in
believing that the Dependence model is the more likely, probability sixty-three
percent. If the reverse shows D then the Independence model is the more likely,
probability ﬁfty-nine percent.
Making the same analysis for the other three cards gives the results in
Table 17.13.
In this Bayesian analysis the purpose of turning a card is to get information from
which to learn which of the two models, Dependence and Independence, is the more
likely. The entropy measure of information transmission, also called information
gain, was described in Table 9.3. It provides an indication of how much might be
learned. The last line of Table 17.13 shows the information gain for each of the four
cards.
Neither of the two analyses, using deductive logic or using Bayes’ Rule,
recommend turning the consonant, D. It is not discriminating and so not informa-
tive. In the earlier analysis this was because the rule said nothing about this card and
so there was no reason to think it relevant. In Oaksford and Chater’s analysis there
is no information because the likelihoods of ﬁnding a 4 or a 7 were the same, forty
percent and sixty percent, in both the Dependence and Independence models
(Table 17.11). The result is the same, no useful information is to be gained.
The difference between the two approaches is that using the Bayesian analysis all
three of the other cards are informative to some extent; the vowel and odd number,
A and 7, as before, but now also the even number, 4. This Bayesian information-
based approach gives an explanation of why the 4 card might be selected and also of
the relative value of each card. This means that the cards can be ranked, A-7-4,
according to how informative they are expected to be. Individual subjects may have
different threshold values. For instance, some would think it worth turning the
4 card while for others it is insufﬁciently informative to be useful.

four cards and to give a measure of their relative value. To do this they used two
models, Dependence and Independence, as alternative accounts of how subjects
might interpret the selection task. The form of each model is ﬁxed but the proba-
bilities are not. Three probabilities are needed
the probability of an even number on the other side of a consonant (40%)
the probability of a vowel card being used for the task (30%)
the base rate probabilities for each model (50%)
This is a much richer framework than the rather austere application of deductive
logic. With two alternative models and three parameters (the three probabilities) it
is not surprising that a greater proportion of responses can be described. This
accounting for results is not necessarily the same as describing a thought process,
although the model may suggest a provocative analogy. The differences between
what people do in experiments and what the analyses describe is diagnostically
helpful in thinking about human reasoning.
Models with more parameters are likely to account for a greater proportion of
experimental results. This allows for useful interpretation of the parameter values
which may, in turn, lead to a better understanding of behaviour.
Oaksford and Chater needed to see if there were parameter values which gave
results corresponding to more of the experimental data than had previous attempts.
There was no reason to believe that unequal base rates were justiﬁable. They
were taken as 50% for each model.
Rather than trying to ﬁx values for the other two probabilities Oaksford and
Chater looked for combinations of values that gave particular orderings according
to information gain. In the illustration this ordering was A-7-4 (Table 17.13). Card
D showed no information gain.
For the competing models row sums were set by choosing the probability that a
vowel card was used for the task, thirty percent in this case. These row sums are the
same for both the Dependence and Independence models (Table 17.12).
The probability of there being a card with an even number is the sum of the ﬁrst
column of each table. For the Independence model this is, by deﬁnition of inde-
pendence, the probability of an even number on the other side of a consonant which
was set at forty percent This is always the case whatever the row sums. But for the
Dependence model, because the probability of the A/7 card is always zero, column
sums change as row sums change. In this case the probability of a 4 is ﬁfty-eight
percent.
Changing the parameter values will in many cases not alter the ordering of the
cards, A-7-4. But for some small values of the parameters the changes in informa-
tion gain do change the ordering. For example, setting the probability of an even
number being on the other side of a consonant at four percent and the probability of
a vowel card at ﬁfteen percent gives the expected probability of each outcome
shown in Table 17.14.

In this ordering the even numbered card, 4, is more informative than the odd.
This was important because it was often what happened. Oaksford and Chater
combined the results of 13 studies in which 34 standard abstract versions of the
task were reported. There were 835 subjects. The frequency with which each card

The Selection Task

For subsequent analyses Oaksford and Chater restricted parameter values to
those in this region, what they called the “rarity assumption”. This assumption was
justiﬁed on two grounds. First, that it was necessary to describe experimental results
and so provided an insight on how subjects might interpret the selection task.
Second, that subjects do not approach the task without some conception of such
tasks and that these frequently involve small probabilities, as in medical diagnosis,
for example. Oaksford and Chater’s Optimal Data Selection model was not
accepted by all [8, 9], yet the increased scope of the account it provides and the
useful provocation of the rarity assumption are clear beneﬁts.
In the rest of their paper Oaksford and Chater used this model as a base for
looking at other issues associated with the selection task, the non-independence of
card selection, for example. Their approach is described in their book Bayesian
Rationality: The probabilistic approach to human reasoning [10].
~ • ~
This application of Bayes’ Rule is unlike others in this book in that its subject is
human reasoning and so there is inevitably the thought that if the Bayesian model
gives a satisfactory description of what we do might that mean that it also describes
how we think? A number of metaphors have been used to describe how the brain
might work—as a computer, for example—and certainly Bayesianism is of value at
this level. But it is not just that. It also has value as a modelling strategy for
problems in cognition and reasoning [11].
Questions about the selection task remain; just why do people select the conso-
nant, D? Alternative explanations continue to be offered [12]. Wason’s selection
task is the experiment that just keeps giving.

The ﬁrst three chapters of this section showed applications of Bayes’ Rule which
used increasingly complex models but the same Bayesian structure as we have
throughout this book. The three problems—author attribution, ecology, and radio-
carbon dating—were quite technical in nature. The processes which generated the
evidence were necessarily described in greater detail than was needed in earlier
chapters.
In Chap. 16 the problems were not those of computational complexity but of
understanding and using evidence with which, because it was probabilistic, we were
unfamiliar and probably uncomfortable. The difﬁculties here are all too human.
In this chapter the problem was again very human: how to carry out a decep-
tively simple task. The differences between what we do, what some say we should
do, and how to account for those differences was what concerned us. A Bayesian
model increased the scope of the analysis.

We have come a long way from Stig and Jan and the Stockholm police but in all
cases a little Bayes thinking has helped.

Conclusion
Bayes’ Rule is the natural way to think about how to evaluate evidence and use it to
revise belief.
You are likely to have read this book because you had heard of Bayes but were
uncertain what it was. Perhaps you were put off because you thought that it was too
mathematical, too difﬁcult. Having got to the end of this book these reservations
should have been dispelled. You may now think that Bayes’ Rule is just common
sense. It is. But, more than that, it is sound statistics too.
To make Bayes’ Rule accessible the calculations were shown in a simple table,
the Bayes Grid. Making it easy to see the calculation meant that at each application
you were reminded (I hope) of the structure of the argument and were provoked to
think about the right questions.
~ • ~
If you decide to read more on Bayes’ Rule you will almost certainly ﬁnd the rule
written as a formula. You may not recognise it. The note following this conclusion
should help.
The range of applications is large and expanding. Software to cope with the
necessary computations is becoming available. In Chap. 12 the use of winBugs for
MCMC was highlighted.
An important and relatively new use of Bayesian analysis is in helping with
complex decision problems. The structure of the problem is represented by a
network which shows the interaction between elements of the decision process.
This is called Bayesian Network Analysis [1, 2].

Bayes’ Rule is a way of learning which imposes a certain discipline.
First, what are the alternative explanations for what we see? The whole point of
collecting evidence is to decide how much credibility we should have in the
alternatives. The plural is important. If we can think of only one explanation
what are we to do but accept it, even with reservations.

Second, do we have a view? The learning process must start from some initial
belief. Perhaps we have no strong view. Or perhaps judgement or data mean that we
approach the analysis already believing that some alternatives are more likely than
others to be the true explanation of the evidence. Base rates encode this starting
point.
Third, what is the process by which evidence is generated? We need a model
which describes how likely is the evidence given each alternative explanation. This
likelihood might be based on an analysis of data (Track Record) or some theoretical
model of the process (Margin of Error) or perhaps just some clear thinking
(Game Show).
The applications we have seen have been numerical but presented so as to
emphasise this structure, for as well as providing a way of calculating it also
provides a way of thinking. Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at the California
Institute of Technology, puts it like this
Bayes’ Theorem is one of those insights that can change the way we go through life. Each
of us comes equipped with a rich variety of beliefs, for or against all sorts of propositions.
Bayes teaches us (1) never to assign perfect certainty to any such belief; (2) always be
prepared to update our credences [beliefs] when new evidence comes along; and (3) how
exactly such evidence alters the credences we assign. It’s a road map for coming closer to
the truth [3].
Carroll is urging that we be careful of assigning base rates of zero because then,
however strong the evidence, your (dis)belief will never alter. Pascal, remember,
made his argument to convince agnostics, not atheists.
Whether or not you use Bayes’ Rule for formal analysis I hope that it will
become a habit of your thought: be open-minded and then let the evidence speak.

Conclusion

A Formula for Bayes’ Rule
In this book I have given Bayes’ Rule as
belief is proportional to base rate  likelihood
because it was appropriate for you, my not necessarily mathematical reader. If you
read more about Bayes’ Rule you are likely to ﬁnd it expressed as a mathematical
formula. This note shows how to translate.
A formula is a compact shorthand which saves a lot of typing and, by use of
symbols rather than words, shows more clearly what is needed for algebraic
manipulation.
Bayes’ Rule shows how one probability distribution, belief in alternatives, is
found from two others, base rates and likelihoods.
Evidence is used to update initial belief which is expressed as base rates. This
initial belief is, by deﬁnition of initial, held before or prior to receipt of evidence.
Another name for base rates is prior probabilities. The prior probability distribution
assigns a probability to each alternative This can be written more compactly by
letting P stand for probability and A for alternative to give
base rate ¼ probability of alternative ¼ prior probability ¼ P A
ð Þ
Next, likelihoods show the probability that different evidence is seen if a
particular alternative is true
likelihood ¼ probability of evidence given alternative
Put E for evidence and use the vertical bar j to stand for “given” so that
likelihood ¼ probability of evidence given alternative ¼ P EjA

Updating the prior probabilities by multiplying them by likelihoods gives revised
probabilities. These describe what we are justiﬁed in believing after, or posterior to,
receipt of evidence. They are also called posterior probabilities
belief ¼ probability of evidence given alternative
¼ posterior probability ¼ P AjE
ð
Þ
One last symbol you are likely to see is / which stands for “is proportional to”.
Putting all this together, Bayes’ Rule
belief is proportional to likelihood  base rate
becomes
P AjE
ð
Þ / P EjA
ð
Þ  P A
ð Þ
It is common to arrange the expression with likelihood before prior, as shown.
To make this statement of proportionality into a numerical estimate we just
rescaled by dividing by the column sum in a Bayes Grid. This column sum was
the probability that a particular value of evidence was seen, P(E). The equation form
of Bayes’ Rule is
P AjE
ð
Þ ¼
P EjA
ð
Þ  P A
ð Þ
P E
ð Þ
You may ﬁnd this formula written slightly differently—A and B rather than A
and E, or prob rather than P—but you’ll know what the formula means, however it is
written.
