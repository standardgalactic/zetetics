IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
Published by the IEEE Computer Society
field. In fact, if you‚Äôre working in machine learning, neu-
ral networks, other soft-computing approaches, or agent-
based computing, then whether you are aware or not, you 
owe a significant intellectual debt to Oliver. His seminal 
ideas in these and related areas helped define the nature 
of our work.
Beginnings of AI
He was an organizer of the 1956 Dartmouth summer 
school, which is generally seen as the origin of American 
AI. During a career that spanned over half a century, he 
worked at GTE, BBN, and the MIT Media Laboratory, 
earning various awards and honors. 
Oliver developed Pandemonium, one of the first AI 
programs to attack learning and reasoning. This system 
could recognize patterns by using what we would today 
call a self-organizing community of agents. Throughout 
the years, he continued to develop ideas about how such 
self-organizing distributed systems could work, and the 
ideas inspired a number of researchers to develop some 
of the main technologies we use in that area today. The 
AAAI, in its AI Topics page on machine learning (www.
aaai.org/AITopics/html/machine.html), chose two quota-
tions from Oliver to begin the article. 
Continuing Influence
In 2006, I invited Oliver to contribute an article to this 
magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuture of AI‚Äù issue. Instead of resting 
on his laurels and writing about his early work in the 
field, or talking about the successes of machine learn-
ing that had arisen, Oliver chose a different course. 
His article ‚ÄúLearning and Education: A Continuing 
Frontier for AI‚Äù (IEEE Intelligent Systems, May/June 
2006, pp. 16‚Äì23) focused on the challenges that remain 
and how what we can do today seems simple when we 
compare it to the learning tasks that humans do almost 
effortlessly. His article posed several challenges to the 
community and sought to, once again, help shape our 
field‚Äôs future.
To me, Oliver was not only one of the founders of our 
field but also a friend and mentor. Although I had met 
him before, we really got to know each other when I was 
at DARPA in the late 1990s. I invited Oliver to come 
down to DC to talk with me about the agent-based com-
puting programs I was running and to give me feedback 
on some ideas. Oliver started by presenting a few ‚Äúoff 
the cuff‚Äù ideas about agent-based systems based on his 
long experience as an observer in the field. It became in-
stantly clear that his ideas went well beyond what most 
people in the field, including me, were thinking, and 
we ended up talking late into the night. That and later 
discussions with Oliver significantly influenced all the 
agent programs I led at DARPA, including those that 
eventually helped lead to the Semantic Web and the use 
of agents in a number of real-world applications.
Oliver was one of the most interesting and energetic 
people I ever met, and one of the most fascinating to 
talk to. A dinner with Oliver would include anecdotes 
about early AI researchers, provocative ideas about 
what current researchers were missing, and insights 
into the field‚Äôs future, as well as reflections into life, 
family, and the world in which we live.

A Gentleman and a Scholar
Oliver cared about people and was, in the 
best sense of the term, a real gentleman. 
One night at dinner the discussion turned 
to our families, as discussions with Oli-
ver invariably did (he never missed an 
opportunity to brag about the accom-
plishments of his children, including of 
course Mallory and Peter, both well- 
respected AI scientists in their own 
right). I mentioned in passing that my 
daughter, then in her early teens, was 
interested in mathematics, and that took 
us off into an anecdote about a famous 
mathematician whom Oliver had known 
as well as various other mathematical 
topics. About two weeks later, I received 
a package from Oliver‚Äîit included print-
outs of a couple of books about mathe-
matics aimed at teens that he had written 
but not published. The books provided 
insights into complex mathematical phe-
nomena at an appropriate level, and my 
daughter loved them. I was struck by the 
fact that not only had Oliver written such 
wonderful things but that he had also re-
membered the off-hand remark about my 
daughter‚Äôs interests and acted on them. 
That‚Äôs the kind of caring person he was.
Just a few weeks ago, I had written 
to some colleagues suggesting that we 
nominate Oliver for a major US gov-
ernment award, because he spent much 
of his career working with government 
projects, rather than promoting his ideas 
in academia. (In fact, I‚Äôm told that sev-
eral of his major accomplishments were 
done in classified domains, so he‚Äôs better 
known publicly for his early ideas than 
for his later work that helped to deliver 
on those early promises.) I pointed out 
how amazing it was that ‚ÄúOliver‚Äôs work 
impacted so many different parts of the 
AI field, and yet his ideas in recent writ-
ings are as fresh as those in his seminal 
early papers.‚Äù 
It‚Äôs a very rare person who can, as Oliver 
did, provide compelling research visions 
throughout a long career. It‚Äôs also rare to 
find someone as willing as he was to men-
tor younger researchers and spend time 
helping them advance their careers. And 
it‚Äôs terribly rare to find someone as full of 
life and as interesting to talk to as Oliver 
was. Those of us practicing AI today are 
truly lucky that this was the field Oli-
ver chose to work in, and he‚Äôll be sorely 
missed.
