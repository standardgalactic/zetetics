Introduction
Cell phone radiation has been a controversial topic for some 
time now with the new advent and planning for 5G cell towers 
[1-5]. The American Cancer Society states that since radiation is 
relatively low compared to gamma rays and ultraviolet light, it is 
not strong enough to break chemical bonds in DNA and thus is not 
a threat of cancer [3-6]. They also contend that the waves are too 
long to be concentrated within the body thus there would likely be 
no effect on the cellular level since cells are many times smaller 
than the wave [7-11]. Lastly, they contend that the towers are at 
a safe distance, so even if you were exposed to such radiation, it 
would be like being exposed to background radiation [9-14]. It 
is well understood that this new 5G technology promises faster 
connections and download speeds however, it can also give great 
enhancements with developing technologies such as autonomous 
cars, smart cities, and virtual reality. From an economic perspective 
it would make sense to further investigate 5G to strengthen the 
potential of these hot commodities and lucrative avenues. The 
caveat is, there is a knowledge gap regarding the health effects of 
5G radiation. The predecessors of 5G, such as 3G and 4G have been 
extensively studied. These studies seem to suggest that cell phone 
radiation can lead to adverse effects [10-16]. Thus, the public 
concern is that increasing the frequency of the radiation will also 
increase the effects of the radiation [14-16].
This review does not try to dispute the idea that radiation 
related to cell phones and cell towers will not have adverse 
effects. However, the purpose of this paper is to explain the basics 
of radiation within the radiofrequency spectrum and to exploit 
possible concerns and byproducts that should be taking into 
consideration if 5G radiation is to be implemented into the cell 
phone industry.
Working Mechanism
To understand possible effects of 5G radiation, it is important 
to know the basics of radio frequencies to thereby apply the 
mechanics in different situations. Looking at microwave ovens 
is a good place to derive how radio frequencies are created. 
The general idea of the workings of the microwave is that the 
electromagnetic waves administered at radio frequencies are 
constantly oscillating. When these oscillating electromagnetic 
waves interact with dipolar molecules such as water (which are 
molecules that are positively charged at one end and negatively 
charged at the other end) the oscillating field of the electromagnetic 
wave causes the molecule to rotate in an increasing manner [16-
18]. This oscillating rotation causes proximal molecules to bump 
against each other thereby causing friction while also increases 
the kinetic energy within the system, which ultimately increases 
Abstract 
This mini review provides a brief introduction on the controversy surrounding the advent of 5G technology. Furthermore, it attempts provide 
general knowledge on antenna radiation to extend to laymen the possible effects of 5G cell towers by explaining the how a microwave radiation 
works and the mechanics of 5G radiation. Finally, it explores the honesty of the uncertainty surrounding the latest generation of wireless 
technology. It also discusses concerns about materials potentially capable to produce 5G radiation.

the thermal energy of the target substance in the microwave. While 
the surface of the target substance heats up the slightly quicker 
due to the fact it is the outer layer that is first exposed to incident 
radiation, the electromagnetic waves are penetrating at the given 
radio frequencies, thus given enough time one can expect a near 
uniform distribution of thermal energy inside the subject, though 
it is not uncommon to see various cold and hot spots in the target 
substance due to various peaks and nodes of the electromagnetic 
wave effecting the target. The focal point of microwave production 
lies within the magnetron. The magnetron contains cooling fins 
which are thinly sliced plates used to dissipate the acquired heat. 
The other component of the magnetron are two magnets and a 
vacuum tube. 
To harness the electromagnetic wave at a specific frequency 
you must send a voltage through the filament in the center. The 
filament is made out tungsten being it has a high thermal tolerance 
and thorium because it is rich with electrons. The filament heats 
up which causes electrons to escape where they proceed to head 
towards the outer copper anode. The magnetic field causes the 
path of the electron to bend back from which it came. The strength 
of the magnetic must maintain the optimum field so the electrons 
proceed with their optimal orbits which thus allows for radio 
frequencies to seep through the cavities.
5G Mechanics
When discussing the mechanics of 5G it is important to 
understand the innovations through each generation. The first 
generation was the first cell phone. 2G gave us the opportunity 
to send text messages. 3G gave us the freedom to use the internet. 
4G increased the overall speed of the previous applications. And 
5G as cited earlier comes with better connections and download 
speeds. These features are accomplished with 5 components of 
5G which include millimeter waves, small cells, massive MIMO, 
beamforming, and full duplex. The first component of millimeter 
waves is indictive of the specific part of the electromagnetic 
spectrum used. Radio frequencies is the part of the spectrum 
that ranges from 3kHz to 300GHz. Typically, 4G operates from 
2-6 GHz. The issue is that as more cell phones come online, there 
will be less space available and more crowded lines [15-19]. 
This problem has pushed scientists to study possible ways of 
increasing the spectrum to reach beyond the standard 4G level of 6 
GHz. This leads us to the second component of small cell networks 
because the higher frequencies tend to get absorbed easily by 
things like trees and buildings which are common in cities and 
rural areas. These small cell towers will be a lot smaller and use 
a lot less power than the predecessor 4G tower which was larger 
and operating at a much higher wattage. The third component is 
massive MIMO which means multiple input multiple output and 
is understood as the device to hold on the ongoing and incoming 
traffic signals. 
All those signals will have overlaps once redistributed; thus 
the fourth component is needed, the beam former, which filter 
the signals to the specified device. The beam former uses timing 
and algorithms to accomplish effective redistribution of incoming 
and outgoing cell signals [17-20]. The full duplex is the part of the 
system that allows for multiple people to talk at the same time 
because of the route it gives the given incoming signals.
Possible Effects
Figure 1: The Radiation Pattern shows that distance does not necessarily indicate the amount of Radiation you will be exposed to.
Antennas are the focal point of wireless communications. Cell 
phone companies have managed to engineer ways of constructing 
the antenna to release desirable wave formations. Thus, different 
antennas will create electromagnetic waves of different forms. 
Thereby when calculating the potential risk of cell tower radiation, 
it is important to note that if a group of people were standing in 
a circle equidistant from the source antenna, they might not 
necessarily revive the same amount of radiation depending on 
the shape of the wave [14-16, 18-21] (Figures 1-3). 5G towers 
are going to emit electromagnetic waves at a higher frequency. 
Higher frequency waves do not travel as far, and they are less 
penetrating. Thus, there will be many 5G cell towers implemented 
in close proximity with one another so you can have a constant 
strong connection. The caveat to this that since the cell towers will 
be in close proximity with one another there is a chance for the 
electromagnetic waves to overlap with one another. This overlap

could cause destructive interference where at certain spots there 
will not be a strong connection due to the emergent collapse of the 
signal [22-26]. Another effect could be that the electromagnetic 
waves will overlap and cause constructive interference. This could 
cause people to be exposed to excess radiation and thus pose as 
health risk to people working near such an environment. Thereby 
electromagnetic wave overlap should be taken into consideration 
before the advent of releasing 5G cell towers in close proximity 
to one another (Figure 4). Photons tend to scatter. Thus, there 
might be a convulsion effect where certain spots are exceeding the 
expected radiation concentration. This could result in a hot spot or 
signaling issues due to the unexpected decibel gains.

Another possible effect is that being so close to cell towers 
can cause one to receive constant doses of radiation. This has 
been shown to have adverse effects for example people who live 
near cell towers had reported to have higher rates of headaches 
as compared to people who do not live close to cell towers. 
Studies also show that long term exposure at frequencies within 
900-1800MHz influenced DNA integrity and even induced 
hippocampal damage. Moreover, studies displayed that in human 
neuroblastoma cells there was a higher chance of susceptibility to 
oxidative stress even after only being exposed to electromagnetic 
waves at 1800MHz for approximately 10 minutes [24-27]. If these 
potential effects are ignored there should be at least a stronger 
push in safety warning regarding the amount of radiation you 
receive from your cell phone. iPhone have made a push to where 
you can go into your settings and read a warning about the specific 
absorption rate limits and how to limit your exposure by simply 
using the hands-free mode or talking on the phone with speaker 
mode. However, the common user will not think twice to review 
these statements [26-29].
Conclusion
i.	
In conclusion, rather or not the public concern of 5G 
radiation is legitimate can be argued either way. However, if 
we agree that health is the primary factor in determining the 
viability of new technology, then the fact remains that there 
are many considerations that need to be addressed before the 
implementation of 5G cell towers. The uncertainty of the putting 
up the towers could be detrimental being there are so many 
towers they would affect populations on a large scale. Moreover, 
it would make more sense from a economical standpoint to 5G 
cell towers in close proximity to one another. out the effects of 5G 
towers before we spend money putting them up.
