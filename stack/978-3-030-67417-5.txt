Preface to the Second Edition
Other than correction of typos, stylistic improvements, and the addition of many
new exercises, two new chapters have been added to the book offering a
non-classical view of the classical spaces and a guided tour of some of the main
attractions of Hilbert space land. The new material creates a more evenly spread
experience across the text and interjects the abstract ambient theory with more
concrete scenarios.
The classical sequence spaces ‘p and function spaces Lp are fundamental and go
hand-in-hand with the general theory. However, the function spaces are technically
demanding and so they were only superﬁcially treated in the ﬁrst edition. The new
chapter devoted to the classical spaces builds on the metric machinery already in
place and attempts to create a clear conceptual framework that emphasizes the
similarities between the two families of spaces. This approach complements the
standard measure-theoretic presentations found in the literature.
The chapter devoted to Hilbert spaces is the new closing chapter of the book and
is written in the form of a discussion. It highlights the practical simpliﬁcation borne
by the presence of an inner product as it draws upon the material in the previous
chapters to compare against the situation in Banach spaces. In this way, the chapter
serves both as a guided tour for the reader’s future journey to Hilbert space theory
and a retrospective reﬂection on its preceding chapters. The topics covered are
classical in Hilbert space theory but as they are handled here after a preliminary
exposition of Banach spaces, the chapter takes the opportunity to create a richer
historical context provided by a brief account of famous results in the development
of the general theory.

Preface to the First Edition
The Structure of the Book
The book consists of eight chapters with an additional chapter of solved problems
arranged by topic. Each chapter is composed of ﬁve sections, with each section
accompanied by a set of exercises (with the exception of the shorter Chapter 7 with
just a single batch of exercises). The total of 422 exercises and 50 solved problems
comprise an integral part of the book designed to assist the reader and hone her
intuition.
Chapter 1 is a general introduction to analysis and, in particular, to each of the
subjects presented in the chapters that follow. Chapter 1 also contains a
Preliminaries section, intended to quickly orient the reader as to the notation and
concepts used throughout the book, starting with sets and ending with an axiomatic
presentation of the real and complex numbers.
Chapter 2 is devoted to linear spaces. At the advanced undergraduate level, the
reader is already familiar with at least some aspects of linear spaces, primarily
ﬁnite-dimensional ones. The chapter does not rely on any previous knowledge
though, and is in that sense self-contained. However, the material is somewhat
advanced since the focus is the technically and conceptually demanding
inﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces.
Chapter 3 is an introduction to topology, a subject considered to be at a rather
high level of abstraction. The main aim of the chapter is to familiarize the reader
with the fundamentals of the theory, particularly the portions that are most directly
relevant for analysis and Hilbert spaces. Care is taken to ﬁnd a reasonable balance
between the study of extreme topology, i.e., spaces or phenomena that one may
consider pathological but that hone the topological intuition, and mundane topol-
ogy, i.e., those spaces or phenomena one is most likely to ﬁnd in nature but that
may obscure the true nature of topology.
Chapter 4 is a study of metric spaces. Once the necessary fundamentals are
covered, the main focus is complete metric spaces. In particular, the Banach Fixed
ix

Point Theorem and Baire’s Theorem are proved and completions are discussed,
topics that are indispensable for Hilbert space theory.
Chapter 5 is a non-classical view of the classical sequence and function spaces.
The ‘p and Lp spaces are presented and the classical facts regarding their separa-
bility properties and duality relationships are discussed. The presentation borrows
ideas from category theory in order to stress the formal similarities between the two
families of spaces.
Chapter 6 introduces and studies Banach spaces and their operators. Starting
with semi-normed spaces the chapter establishes the fundamentals and goes on to
introduce Banach spaces, treating the Open Mapping Theorem, the Hahn-Banach
Theorem, the Closed Graph Theorem, and, toward the end, touches upon
unboundedness.
Chapter 7 is a short introduction to topological groups, emphasizing their rela-
tion to Banach spaces. The chapter does not assume any knowledge of group
theory, and thus, to remain self-contained, it presents all relevant group-theoretic
notions. The chapter ends with a treatment of uniform spaces and a hint of their
usefulness in the general theory.
Chapter 8 is a short excursion to Hilbert space land. Reﬂecting on the material
developed in the preceding chapters, the chapter, written in discussion form, con-
siders several problems that arise naturally in the context of Banach spaces, delves
sufﬁciently deep to witness the inherent difﬁculty, and proceeds to display the
enormous beneﬁt of the geometry of Hilbert spaces toward a resolution. The topics
covered are the closest point property, orthogonal complements, bases, Fourier
series, and the Riesz representation theorem.
A Word About the Intended Audience
The book is aimed at the advanced undergraduate or beginning postgraduate level,
with the general prerequisite of sufﬁcient mathematical maturity as expected at that
level of studies. The book should be of interest to the student knowing nothing of
Hilbert space theory who wishes to master its prerequisites. The book should also
be useful to the reader who is already familiar with some aspects of Hilbert space
theory, linear spaces, topology, or metric spaces, as the book contains all the
relevant deﬁnitions and pivotal theorems in each of the subjects it covers.
A Word About the Authors
The authors of the book, a physicist and a mathematician, by writing the entire book
together, and through many arguments about notation and style, hope that this clash
between the desires of a physicist to quickly yet intelligibly get to the point and the
x
Preface to the First Edition

insistence of a mathematician on rigor and conciseness did not leave the pages of
this book tainted with blood but rather that it resulted in a welcoming introduction
for both physicists and mathematicians interested in Hilbert Space Theory.
Prof. Carlo Alabiso obtained his Degree in Physics at Milan University, and
then taught for more than 40 years at Parma University, Parma, Italy (with a period
spent as a research fellow at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and at Cern,
Geneva). His teaching encompassed topics in quantum mechanics, special rela-
tivity, ﬁeld theory, elementary particle physics, mathematical physics, and func-
tional
analysis.
His
research
ﬁelds
include
mathematical
physics
(Padé
approximants), elementary particle physics (symmetries and quark models), and
statistical physics (ergodic problems), and he has published articles in a wide range
of national and international journals as well as the previous Springer book (with
Alessandro Chiesa), Problemi di Meccanica Quantistica non Relativistica.
Dr. Ittay Weiss earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from Utrecht University, The
Netherlands, in 2007. He has published work on algebraic topology, general
topology, metric space theory, and category theory, and taught undergraduate and
postgraduate mathematics in The Netherlands, Fiji, and England. He is currently
Senior Lecturer in Mathematics at the School of Mathematics and Physics in the
University of Portsmouth, UK. Born in Israel, his ﬁrst encounter with advanced
mathematics was at the age of 16 while he was following computer science courses
at the Israeli Open University. So profound was his fascination with the beauty and
utility of mathematics that, despite the digital economic bloom of the time, he
enrolled, as soon as he could, for the B.Sc. in mathematics at the Hebrew University
and continued to pursue his M.Sc. immediately afterwards, receiving both degrees
cum laude. Convinced that the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is
illusory and that the abstract and the concrete form a symbiosis of endless mutual
nourishment, he ﬁnds great joy in digging into the mathematical foundations of
applied topics. Occasionally he ﬁnds an angle he particularly likes that he might
communicate as an article in the online journal The Conversation.
A Word of Gratitude
First and foremost, the authors extend their gratitude to Prof. Adriano Tomassini
and to Dr. Daniele Angella for their contribution to the Solved Problems chapter.
The authors wish to thank Rahel Berman for her numerous stylistic suggestions and
to Alveen Chand for useful comments that improved the Preliminaries chapter. The
second named author wishes to thank Michał Gnacik for interesting discussions and
suggestions and Levana Cohen for being a very engaging student.

About This Book
This textbook is a treatment of the structure of abstract spaces, in particular, linear,
topological, metric and normed spaces, as well as topological groups, in a rigorous
and reader-friendly fashion. The assumed background knowledge on the part of the
reader is modest, limited to basic concepts of ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces and
elementary analysis. The book’s aim is to serve as an introduction toward the theory
of Hilbert spaces.
The formalism of Hilbert spaces is fundamental to Physics and in particular to
Quantum Mechanics, requiring a certain amount of ﬂuency with the techniques of
linear algebra, metric space theory, and topology. Typical introductory-level books
devoted to Hilbert spaces assume a signiﬁcant level of familiarity with the necessary
background material and consequently present only a brief review of it. A reader
who ﬁnds the overview insufﬁcient is forced to consult other sources to ﬁll the
gap. Assuming only a rudimentary understanding of real analysis and linear alge-
bra, this book offers an introduction to the mathematical prerequisites of Hilbert
space theory in a single self-contained source. The text is suitable for advanced
undergraduate or introductory graduate courses for both Physics and Mathematics
students.

Hilbert Space Theory—A Quick Overview
Hilbert space theory is the mathematical formalism for non-relativistic Quantum
Mechanics. A Hilbert space is a linear space together with an inner product that
endows the space with the structure of a complete metric space. Hilbert space theory
is thus a fusion of algebra, topology, and geometry.
The reader is already familiar with the intermingling of algebra and geometry,
namely in the linear space Rn. Elements in Rn can be thought of as points in n-
dimensional space but also as vectors. Typically, points have coordinates and vectors
can be added and scaled. Moreover, in the presence of the standard inner product,
given by ⟨x, y⟩= n
k=1 xk yk, the length of a vector is given by the norm
∥x∥=

⟨x, x⟩
and the angle between vectors can be computed by means of the formula
θ = arccos ⟨x, y⟩
∥x∥∥y∥.
At this level, the interaction between the algebra and the geometry is quite smooth.
Things change though as soon as one considers inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces,
and this is also where topology comes into the picture. For ﬁnite dimensional lin-
ear spaces, bases (and thus coordinates) are readily available, all linear operators
are continuous, convergence of operators has a single meaning, any linear space is
naturally isomorphic to its double dual, and the closed unit ball is compact. These
conveniences do not exist in the inﬁnite-dimensional case. While bases do exist, the
proof of their existence is non-constructive and more often than not no basis can
be given explicitly. Consequently, techniques that rely on coordinates and matrices
are generally unsuitable. Linear operators need not be continuous, and in fact many
linear operators of interest are not continuous. The space consisting of all linear

Introduction and Preliminaries
operators between two linear spaces carries two different topologies, and thus two
different notions of convergence. The correct notion of the dual space is that of all
continuous linear operators into the ground ﬁeld and even then the original space
only embeds in its double dual. Lastly, the closed unit ball is not compact.
In a sense, the aim of Hilbert space theory is to develop adequate machinery to
be able to reason about inﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces subject to these inherent
difﬁculties and topological subtleties. The mathematics background required for the
study of Hilbert spaces thus includes linear algebra, topology, the theory of metric
spaces, and the theory of normed spaces. The theory of topological groups, a fusion
between group theory and topology, arises naturally as well. Before we proceed to
elaborate on each of these topics we visit the most fundamental space of them all,
that of the real numbers.
1.1.1
The Real Numbers—Where it All Begins
Most fundamental to human observation of the external world are the real numbers.
The outcome of a measurement is almost always assumed to be a real number (at
least in some ideal sense). That this idealization is deeply ingrained in the scientiﬁc
lore is witnessed by the very name of the real numbers; among all numbers, these
are the real ones. The reasons for science’s strong preference for the real numbers
is a debate for philosophers. We merely observe, whether the use of real numbers is
justiﬁed or not, that the success of the real numbers in science is unquestionable.
Mathematically though, the real numbers pose several non-trivial challenges. One
of those challenges is the very deﬁnition of the real numbers, or, in other words,
answering the question: what is a real number? For the ancient Greeks, roughly
speaking until the Pythagoreans, the real numbers were taken for granted as being
the same as what we would today call the rationals. That was the commonly held
belief until the discovery that
√
2 is an irrational number (the precise circumstances
of that discovery are unclear). The construction of precise models for the reals had
to wait numerous centuries, and so did the discovery of transcendental numbers and
the understanding of just how many real numbers there are.
1.1.1.1
Constructing the Real Numbers
The reader is likely to have her own personal idea(lization) regarding what the real
numbers really are. Any precise interpretation or elucidation of the true entities
which are the real numbers belongs to philosophy. Choosing to stay ﬁrmly afoot in
mathematics, we present one of many precise constructions of a model of the real
numbers. As with the construction of any model, one can not construct something
from nothing. We thus assume the reader accepts the existence of (a model of) the
rational numbers. In other words, we pretend to agree on what the rational numbers
are, but to have no knowledge of the real number system. We will give the precise

1.1 Hilbert Space Theory—A Quick Overview
3
construction but, to remain in the spirit of an introduction, we avoid the details of
the proofs.
To motivate the following construction of the real numbers from the rational
numbers, recall that the rational numbers are dense in the real numbers, meaning that
between any two real numbers there exists a rational number. This simple observation
gives rise to the crucial fact that every real number is the limit of a sequence of rational
numbers. Thus, the convergent sequences of rational numbers give us access to all of
the real numbers. Since many different sequences of rational numbers may converge
to the same real number, the set of all convergent sequences of rational numbers is
too wasteful to be taken as the deﬁnition of the real numbers. One needs to introduce
an equivalence relation on it, one that identiﬁes two sequences of rational numbers
if they converge to the same real number.
If S denotes the set of all convergent sequences of rational numbers, then we
expect to be able to identify an equivalence relation ∼on S such that S/∼forms a
model of the real numbers. However, to even take the ﬁrst step in this plan without
committing the sin of a circular argument, one must ﬁrst be able to identify the
convergent sequences among all sequences of rational numbers without any a-priori
knowledge of the real numbers. That task is achieved by appealing to the familiar
notion of a Cauchy sequence, a condition which, for sequences of real numbers, is
well known to be equivalent to convergence. The key observation is that the Cauchy
condition for sequences of rational numbers can be stated without mentioning real
numbers at all. In this way the convergent sequences of rational numbers are carved
from the set of all sequences of rationals by means of an inherently rational criterion.
The construction we give is due to Georg Cantor, the creator of the theory of sets.
On the set Q of rational numbers, which we assume is endowed with the familiar
notions of addition and multiplication, and thus also with the notions of subtraction
and division, consider the function d : Q × Q →Q given by d(x, y) = |x −y|.
We deﬁne a Cauchy sequence to be a sequence (xn) of rational numbers which
satisﬁes the condition that for every rational number ε > 0 there exists N ∈N such
that d(xn, xm) < ε for all n, m > N. Let now S be the set of all Cauchy sequences
and deﬁne the relation ∼on S as follows. Given Cauchy sequences (xn), (yn) ∈S,
declare that (xn) ∼(yn) if d(xn, yn) →0. Note that convergence to 0 (or any other
rational number) of a sequence of rational numbers can be stated without assuming
the existence of real numbers. Indeed, the meaning of (xn) ∼(yn) is that for every
rational number ε > 0 there exists an N ∈N such that d(xn, yn) < ε for all n > N.
It is a straightforward matter to show that ∼is an equivalence relation on S.
We now deﬁne the set of real numbers to be R = S/∼, namely the quotient set
determined by the equivalence relation. One immediate thing to notice is that R
contains a copy of Q. Indeed, for any rational number q ∈Q consider the constant
sequence xq = (xn = q). It is clearly a Cauchy sequence, and thus xq ∈S, and its
equivalence class [xq] is thus, per deﬁnition, a real number. Further, if q′ ̸= q is
another rational, then [xq] ̸= [xq′] since the respective constant sequences are not
equivalent, and thus not identiﬁed in the quotient set. In other words, the function
q →[xq] is an injection from Q to R.

Introduction and Preliminaries
The familiar algebraic structure of Q carries over to R as follows. Given real num-
bers x, y, represented by Cauchy sequences (xn) and (yn) respectively, the sum x + y
is deﬁned to be represented by (xn + yn) and the product xy to be represented by
(xnyn). Of course, one needs to check these are well-deﬁned notions, i.e., that the pro-
posed sequences are Cauchy and that the resulting sum and product are independent
of the choice of representatives. This veriﬁcation, especially for the sum, is straight-
forward. Once that is done, the veriﬁcation of the familiar algebraic properties of
addition and multiplication is easily performed, proving that R is a ﬁeld. Similarly,
the order structure of Q carries over to R by deﬁning, for real numbers x and y as
above, that x < y if there exists a rational number ε > 0 such that xn ≤yn −ε for
all but ﬁnitely many n. It is quite straightforward to verify that R is then an ordered
ﬁeld. Finally, and by far least trivially, R satisﬁes the least upper bound property,
proving that it is Dedekind complete.
The embedding of Q in R described above is easily seen to respect the order and
algebraic structure of Q. Therefore the ﬁeld Q of rational numbers can be identiﬁed
with its isomorphic copy in R, namely the image of the embedding Q →R, and one
then considers R as an extension of Q.
1.1.1.2
Transcendentals and Uncountability
The divide of the real numbers into rational and irrational numbers represents the
ﬁrst fundamental indication of the complexity of the real numbers. Together with
the realization that
√
2 is an irrational number comes the necessity, if only out of
curiosity, of asking about the nature of other real numbers, for instance π and e.
The number e was introduced by Jacob Bernoulli in 1683 but it was only some
50 years later that Leonard Euler established its irrationality. In sharp contrast, the
number π, known since antiquity, was only shown to be irrational in 1761 by Johann
Heinrich Lambert. If this is not indication enough that the real number system holds
more secrets than one would superﬁcially expect, the fact that to date it is unknown
whether or not π + e is irrational should remove any doubt.
Some real numbers, while irrational, may still be nearly rational, in the following
sense. Consider a rational number r = p/q. Clearly, r satisﬁes the equation
qt −p = 0,
and thus r is a root of a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients. More generally, any real
number that is a root of a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients is called an algebraic
number. For instance,
√
2 is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial t2 −2. A real
number that is not algebraic is called transcendental. The existence of transcendental
numbers was not established until 1844 by Joseph Liouville who, shortly afterwards,
constructed the ﬁrst explicit example of a transcendental number (albeit a somewhat
artiﬁcial one). More prominent members of the transcendental class are the numbers
e, proved transcendental by Charles Hermite in 1873, and the number π, proved

1.1 Hilbert Space Theory—A Quick Overview
5
transcendental by Ferdinand von Lindemann in 1882. While much is known about
transcendental numbers, it is still unknown if π + e is algebraic or not.
In 1884 Georg Cantor, following shortly after Liouville’s proof of the existence of
transcendental numbers, proved not only that transcendental numbers exist but that
in some sense the vast majority of all real numbers are transcendental. The technique
employed by Cantor was that of transﬁnite counting. With his notion of cardinality
of sets, Cantor counted how many algebraic numbers there are and how many real
numbers there are, and demonstrated that there are strictly more real numbers than
algebraic ones. The inevitable conclusion that transcendental numbers exist was met
with some resistance with objections to the set-theoretic proof technique.
We end this short historical excursion and turn to quickly address the main topics
covered in this book.
1.1.2
Linear Spaces
A linear space, also known as a vector space, embodies what is perhaps the simplest
notion of a mathematical space. When thought of as modeling actual physical space,
a linear space appears to be the same in all directions and is completely devoid of
any curvature. Linear spaces, and the closely related notion of linear transformation
or linear operator, are fundamental objects. For instance, the derivative of a function
at a point is best understood as a linear operator on tangent spaces, particularly for
functions of several variables. Differentiable manifolds are spaces which may be
very complicated but, at each point, they are locally linear. It is perhaps somewhat of
an exaggeration, but it is famously held to be true that if a problem can be linearized,
then it is as good as solved.
1.1.3
Topological Spaces
Topology is easy to deﬁne but hard to explain. The ideas that led to the development
of topology were lurking beneath the surface for some time and it is difﬁcult to
pinpoint the exact time in history when topology was born. What is clear is that
after its birth the advancement of topology in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century was
rapid. The unifying power of topology is immense and its explanatory ability is a
powerful one. For instance, familiar theorems of ﬁrst year real analysis, such as the
existence of maxima and minima for continuous functions on a closed interval, or
the uniform continuity of a continuous function on a closed interval, may make the
closed interval appear to have special signiﬁcance. Topology is able to clarify the
situation, identifying a particular topological property of the closed interval, namely
that it is compact, as the key ingredient enabling the proof to carry over into much
more general situations.

1.1.4
Metric Spaces
Metric spaces appeared in 1906 in the PhD dissertation of Maurice Fréchet. A met-
ric space is a set where one can measure distances between points, and in a strong
sense a metric space carries much more geometric information than can be described
by a topological space. With stronger axioms come stronger theorems but also less
examples. However, the axioms of a metric space allow for a vast and varied array
of examples and the theorems one can prove are very strong. In particular, complete
metric spaces, i.e., those that, intuitively, have no holes, admit two very strong the-
orems. One is the Banach Fixed Point Theorem and another is Baire’s Theorem.
The former can be used to solve, among other things, differential equations, while
the latter has deep consequences to the structure of complete metric spaces and to
continuous functions.
1.1.5
Classical Sequence and Function Spaces
Spaces of inﬁnite sequences and spaces of functions are of great importance in mod-
ern analysis. They arise often in applications and provide a rich source of problems
both in historical and contemporary contexts. A rigorous presentation of the sequence
spaces is certainly within grasp with just a modest amount of undergraduate analysis.
Their elementary structure can be appreciated as well without too much difﬁculty.
However, the function spaces are well known to present a far greater challenge. The
approach taken in the chapter presents the families of sequence and function spaces
as metric completions using ideas from category theory in order to extract a strong
similarity between the two families of spaces. This approach allows the reader to
export understanding of the technically simpler sequence spaces to the more elusive
function spaces.
1.1.6
Banach Spaces
A very basic attribute one can associate with a vector is its norm, i.e., its length. The
abstract formalism is given by the axioms of a normed space. The presence of a norm
allows one to deﬁne the distance between any two vectors, by the so-called induced
metric, and one obtains a metric space, as well as the topology it induces. Thus any
normed space immediately incorporates both algebra and geometry. A Banach space
is a normed space which, as a metric space, is complete. The interaction between
the algebra and the geometry is then particularly powerful, allowing for very strong
results.

1.1.7
Topological Groups
Banach spaces are a fusion of algebra and geometry. Similarly, topological groups are
a fusion between algebra and topology. Unlike a Banach space, the algebraic structure
is that of a group while the geometry is reduced from a metric to a topology. Thus, a
topological group is a much weaker structure than a Banach space, yet the interaction
between the algebra and the topology still gives rise to a very rich and interesting
theory.
1.1.8
Hilbert Spaces
In a sense the whole book is geared toward this chapter. The content is a discussion
of the closest point property, orthogonal complements, bases, Fourier series, and the
Riesz representation theorem. The location of this chapter as the ﬁnal one, after the
rudiments of Banach space theory, allows for a presentation that relates to broader
concepts and illustrates the differences between Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.
1.2
Preliminaries
The aim of this section is to recount some of the fundamental notions of set theory,
the common language for rigorous mathematical discussions. It serves to quickly
orient the reader with respect to the notation used throughout the book as well as
to present fundamental results on cardinals and demonstrate the technique of Zorn’s
Lemma. This section is designed to be skimmed through and only consulted for a
more detailed reading if needed further on. For that reason, and unlike the rest of the
book, the style of presentation in this section is succinct.
1.2.1
Sets
The notion of a set is taken as a primitive notion, left undeﬁned. In an axiomatic
approach to sets one lists certain well formulated and carefully chosen axioms, while
in a naive approach one relies on a common understanding of what sets are, avoiding
the technical difﬁculties of precise deﬁnitions at the cost of some rigor. We adopt the
naive approach and thus for us a set is a collection of elements, where no repetitions
are allowed and no ordering of the elements of the set is assumed.

Introduction and Preliminaries
1.2.2
Common Sets
Among the sets we will encounter are the sets N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} of natural numbers,
Z = {. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .} of integers, Q = {p/q | p, q ∈Z, q ̸= 0} of
rational numbers, R of real numbers, and C = {x + iy | x, y ∈R} of complex
numbers. The notation illustrates two commonly occurring ways for introducing
sets, the informal . . . which implies that the reader knows what the author had in
mind, and the precise form {x ∈X | P(x)}, to be interpreted as the set of all those
elements x in X satisfying property P. The empty set is denoted by ∅, and it sim-
ply has no elements in it. A set {x}, consisting of just a single element, is called a
singleton set.
1.2.3
Relations Between Sets
The notation x ∈X was already used above to indicate that x is a member of the set
X. To indicate that x is not a member of X we write x /∈X. Two sets X and Y may
have the property that any element x ∈X is also a member of Y, a situation denoted
by X ⊆Y, meaning that X is contained in Y, X is a subset of Y, Y contains X, and
that Y is a superset of X. If, moreover, X ̸= Y, then X is said to be a proper subset of
Y, denoted by X ⊂Y. In particular, X ⊂Y means that every element x ∈X satisﬁes
x ∈Y and that for at least one element y ∈Y it holds that y /∈X. An often useful
observation is that two sets X and Y are equal, denoted by X = Y, if, and only if,
X ⊆Y and Y ⊆X.
1.2.4
Families of Sets; Union and Intersection
Any set I may serve as an indexing set for a set of sets. In that case it is customary
to speak of a family of sets, a collection of sets, or an indexed set. For instance,
consider I = [0, 1] = {t ∈R | 0 ≤t ≤1}, and for each t ∈I let Xt = (0, t) = {x ∈
R | 0 < x < t}. Then {Xt}t∈I is a family of sets indexed by I. If Xi ∩X j = ∅for
all i, j ∈I with i ̸= j, then the collection is said to be pairwise disjoint. For any
indexed collection, its union is the set

Set Difference, Complementation, and De Morgan’s
Laws
The set difference X \ Y is the set {x ∈X | x /∈Y}. In the presence of a universal
set or a set of discourse, that is a set U which is the relevant ambient set for a given
context, the complement of a set X ⊆U is the set Xc = {y ∈U | y /∈X}. In other
words, Xc = U \ X. Needless to say, the notation Xc pre-supposes knowledge of U,
and different choices of U yield different complements. In this context we mention
that the set difference X \ Y is also known as the relative complement of Y in X.
Among the many properties of sets and the operations of union, intersection, and
complementation we only mention De Morgan’s laws: Given any indexed collection

Finite Cartesian Products
Given m sets (m ≥1), X1, . . . , Xm, their cartesian product is the set
X1 × · · · × Xm = {(x1, . . . , xm) | xk ∈Xk, for all 1 ≤k ≤m}.
In other words, the cartesian product of m sets X1, . . . , Xm (in that order) is the set
consisting of all m-tuples where the k-th component (for 1 ≤k ≤m) is taken from
the k-th set. In case Xk = X for all 1 ≤k ≤m, the cartesian product is denoted by
Xm and is called the m-fold cartesian product of X with itself.
From a set-theoretic perspective cartesian products present some subtleties involv-
ing the issue of the deﬁnition itself and the question of coherence with regard to
repeated application of cartesian products. These aspects are investigated in the exer-
cises.
1.2.7
Functions
Given any two sets X and Y, a function or a mapping, denoted by f : X →Y or
X
f
Y is, informally, a rule that associates with each element x ∈X an element
f (x) ∈Y. More formally, a function f : X →Y is a subset f ⊆X × Y satisfying
the property that for all x ∈X and y1, y2 ∈Y, if (x, y1) ∈f and (x, y2) ∈f , then
y1 = y2, and that for all x ∈X there exists some y ∈Y with (x, y) ∈f . The set
X is the domain of the function while Y is the codomain. For any set X there
is always the identity function idX : X →X given by idX(x) = x. Further, given
functions f : X →Y and g : Y →Z, their composition is deﬁned to be the function
g ◦f : X →Z given by (g ◦f )(x) = g( f (x)). One easily sees that composition of
functions is associative, that is, if
X1
f
X2
g
X3
h
X4,
then
h ◦(g ◦f ) = (h ◦g) ◦f.
A function f : X →Y is injective, or one-to-one, if f (x1) = f (x2) implies x1 = x2,
for all x1, x2 ∈X. A function f : X →Y is surjective, or onto, if for all y ∈Y
there exists an x ∈X such that f (x) = y. A function f : X →Y is called bijective
if it is both injective and surjective. A function f : X →Y is invertible if there
exists a function f −1 : Y →X, called the inverse of f , such that f ◦f −1 = idY and
f −1 ◦f = idX. Such an inverse, if it exists, is easily seen to be unique. Lastly, we
note that a function f is invertible if, and only if, it is bijective.

1.2 Preliminaries
11
Given a function f : X →Y and a subset S ⊆X, the restriction of f to S is the
function g : S →Y given by g(s) = f (s). This restriction function is denoted by
f |S. We also mention that any two sets X and Y with X ⊆Y give rise to the inclusion
functionι : X →Y,deﬁnedbyι(x) = x.Notethattheinclusionfunctiondiffersfrom
the identity function only by the codomain, not by the functional assignments. The
set of all functions f : X →Y is denoted by Y X.
1.2.8
Arbitrary Cartesian Products
The cartesian product of any indexed family {Xi}i∈I of sets is the set
{ f : I →

i∈I
Xi | f (i) ∈Xi, ∀i ∈I}.
To justify the deﬁnition, observe that when I = {1, 2, 3, . . . , m}, each function f as
above can be uniquely identiﬁed with the m-tuple ( f (1), f (2), . . . , f (m)), in other
words, with an element of X1 × · · · × Xm, so this deﬁnition recovers the deﬁnition
of the cartesian product of ﬁnitely many sets as given above. When Xi = X for all
i ∈I, the cartesian product is denoted by X I. Notice that X I is simply the set of all
functions f : I →X.
1.2.9
Direct and Inverse Images
The power set of a set X is the set of all subsets of X, and is denoted by P(X).
Every function f : X →Y induces the direct image function f : P(X) →P(Y),
denoted again by f , given by f (A) = { f (a) | a ∈A}, for all A ⊆X (notice that this
deﬁnition introduces a new way to construct sets). Similarly, any function f : X →Y
induces the inverse image function f −1 : P(Y) →P(X), which, for every B ⊆Y,
is given by f −1(B) = {x ∈X | f (x) ∈B}. Notice that f −1(Y) = X but that the
inclusion f (X) ⊆Y may be proper. The set f (X) is called the image of f . Note
that f (X) = Y if, and only if, f is surjective. We remark that the notation f −1 for
the inverse image conﬂicts with the notation for the inverse function of f (when it
exists) and thus some care should be exercised. At times, the notation f→is used for
the direct image and f ←for the inverse image function.
The following properties of functions are easily veriﬁed. For all functions
X
f
Y
g
Z and S ⊆Z a subset, we have that
(g ◦f )−1(S) = f −1(g−1(S)).
Further, for all subsets S1, S2 ⊆Y,

12
1
Introduction and Preliminaries
f −1(S1 ∩S2) = f −1(S1) ∩f −1(S2)
and
f −1(S1 ∪S2) = f −1(S1) ∪f −1(S2).
More generally, given any collection {Si}i∈I of subsets of Y,

If the domain X of a function contains an element x that is also a subset of X,
namely both x ∈X and x ⊆X hold, then the meaning of f (x) is ambiguous; it may
refer to the value of f at x or to the image of the subset x under f . This unfortunate
scenario results from overloading the notation f to mean the function and its direct
image.
When considering the inverse image of a singleton set {y}, namely f −1({y}), it is
convenient to shorten the notation and write f −1(y), remembering that the outcome
is a subset of the domain that may well be empty.
1.2.10
Indicator Functions
Let S be the set {0, 1} and ﬁx some set X. The subsets of X are easily seen to be in
bijective correspondence with the functions X →S. The correspondence is given as
follows. Given a subset S ⊆X let F(S) : X →S be given by
F(S)(x) =

1 if x ∈S
0 if x /∈S.
The function F(S) is called the indicator function of the subset S ⊆X. Conversely,
given any function f : X →S, the subset of X it determines is G( f ) = f −1({1}). It
is easily veriﬁed that F and G are each other’s inverses, setting up the stated bijective
correspondence. Note that f −1({0}) is the complement X \ f −1({1}).

1.2 Preliminaries

1.2.11
Cardinality
Two sets X and Y are said to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection
f : X →Y, in which case we write |X| = |Y|. If there is an injection f : X →Y,
then X is said to have cardinality less than or equal to that of Y, and we write
|X| ≤|Y|.
Two ﬁnite sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, they have the same number
of elements. It is thus common to write |X| for a ﬁnite set X to indicate the number
of elements in X.
A set X is said to be countable if it is empty or if there exists a surjective function
f : N →X. Equivalently, a set is countable if it has the same cardinality as some
subset of N. Equivalently still, a set X is countable precisely when there exists an
injective function X →N. A set that is both countable and inﬁnite is said to be
countably inﬁnite. A set that is not countable is called uncountable. A set which has
the same cardinality as R is said to have the cardinality of the continuum. Examples
of countable sets include every ﬁnite set, the set N, as well as the set Z of integers
and the set Q of rational numbers. Sets of the cardinality of the continuum include
the set R of real numbers as well as C of complex numbers, the n-fold products Rn
and Cn for any n ∈N, as well as the power set P(N), namely the set of all subsets
of natural numbers, and the set of all continuous functions f : R →R. Uncountable
sets of cardinality larger than that of the continuum include the power set P(R) of all
subsets of real numbers, as well as the set of all functions f : R →R. Establishing
such cardinality claims requires set-theoretic tools of which the one presented next
is of fundamental use.
1.2.12
The Cantor-Shröder-Bernstein Theorem
The result we present now is a very convenient tool in establishing that two sets have
the same cardinality.
Theorem 1.1 (Cantor-Shröder-Bernstein) For all sets X and Y, if |X| ≤|Y| and
|Y| ≤|X|, then |X| = |Y|.
Proof By the condition in the assertion, there exists an injective function f : X →
Y and an injective function g : Y →X. To construct a bijection h : X →Y, we
consider the behaviour of elements in both X and Y with respect to the given functions
f and g. Notice that since g is injective, the inverse image g−1(x0), for any x0 ∈X,
is either empty or is of the form {y0}, where g(y0) = x0. Similarly, f −1(y1), for
any y1 ∈Y, is either empty or is of the form {x1} with f (x1) = y1. We thus write
f −1(y1) = x1 and g−1(x0) = y0, when these sets are not empty. Starting with x0 ∈X
we may successively consider the sequence
x0 →g−1(x0) = y0 →f −1(y0) = x1 →g−1(x1) = y1 →· · ·

14

Introduction and Preliminaries
where at each step we apply f −1 or g−1 alternatively, if they exist. Such a sequence
exhibits precisely one of three possible behaviours. It may be inﬁnite, in which case
x0 is said to have type ∞, or it may terminate since g−1(xk) was empty, in which
case x0 is said to have type X, or the sequence may stop due to the fact that f −1(yk)
was empty, in which case x0 is said to have type Y. In exactly the same way, each
element of Y can be classiﬁed as having precisely one type, either type ∞, or type
X or type Y.
Let us now denote by X∞all type ∞elements in X, by X X all type X elements
in X, and by XY all type Y elements in X. Similarly, introduce the notation Y∞, YX,
and YY. Thus
X = X∞∪X X ∪XY
and the union is pairwise disjoint. Similarly we obtain the pairwise disjoint union
Y = Y∞∪YX ∪YY.
The function given by
h(x) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
f (x)
if x ∈X X
g−1(x) if x ∈XY
f (x)
if x ∈X∞
is now easily seen to be a bijection, for instance by constructing an inverse function
for it.
□
For two non-trivial intervals (a, b) and (c, d) in R the function f (x) = d−c
b−a ·
(x −a) + c is a bijection from (a, b) to (c, d). Thus all open intervals in R have the
same cardinality. Other explicit bijections are provided by arctan: (−π/2, π/2) →
R and exp: R →(0, ∞), showing that |R| = |(−π/2, π/2)| = |(0, ∞)|. Generally,
ﬁnding explicit bijections can be very difﬁcult and then the Cantor-Shröder-Bernstein
Theorem is handy. For instance, for the intervals (0, 1) and [0, 1] the inclusion x →x
is an injection from (0, 1) →[0, 1] while x →(x + 1)/4 is an injection in the other
direction. It follows that |(0, 1)| = |[0, 1]| but an explicit bijection is illusive (and
certainly no continuous bijection exists).
1.2.13
Countable Arithmetic
Some aspects of the arithmetic of the natural numbers is a reﬂection of properties
of ﬁnite sets. Passing to inﬁnite sets quickly leads to axiomatic subtleties. In this
section we present useful results pertaining to the arithmetic of countable sets where
the axiomatic difﬁculties are less pronounce. The countable case sufﬁces for most
applications in the context of this book.
Theorem 1.2 A subset of a countable set is countable.

1.2 Preliminaries
15
Proof Suppose a set X is countable and S ⊆X is a subset. If S = ∅, then it is
countable, so we may assume S ̸= ∅and let us ﬁx some s0 ∈S. Since X is countable,
there exists a surjection f : N →X. Clearly, there is a surjection g : X →S (for
instance, g(x) = x if x ∈S, and g(x) = s0 if x /∈S) and, since the composition of
surjective functions is surjective, the function g ◦f : N →S is surjective, showing
that S is countable.
□
Theorem 1.3 A cartesian product of ﬁnitely many countable sets is countable.
Proof Let X1, . . . , Xm be countable sets and choose, for each 1 ≤k ≤m, an injec-
tive function fk : Xk →N. These functions together give rise to
f : X1 × · · · × Xm →Nm
given by
f (x1, . . . , xm) = ( f1(x1), . . . , fm(xm)),
which is clearly injective. Now ﬁx m distinct prime numbers p1, . . . , pm and let
g : Nm →N
be given by
g(n1, . . . , nm) = pn1
1 · · · · · pnm
m .
The fact that every natural number has an essentially unique decomposition into
prime factors implies that g is injective. To conclude, the composition
X1 × · · · × Xm
f
Nm
g
N
is injective, and thus X1 × · · · × Xm is countable.
□
Theorem 1.4 A countable union of countable sets is itself countable.
Proof Let {Xm}m∈N be a countable family of countable sets. We may assume, without
loss of generality, that the collection is pairwise disjoint and that Xm ̸= ∅for all
m ∈N. Since each Xm is countable, there exists a surjective function fm : N →Xm.
Let
X =

m∈N
Xm
and deﬁne now the function
g : N × N →X
by
g(m, n) = fm(n),

16

Introduction and Preliminaries
which is clearly surjective. To ﬁnish the proof, note that N × N, being the product of
two countable sets, is countable, and thus there is a surjection h : N →N × N. The
composition
N
h
N × N
f
X
is thus a surjection, and so X is countable.
□
We may now conclude, for instance, that the set Z of integers is countable since
Z = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . } ∪{−1, −2, −3, . . . }, a union of two countable sets. The set
Z × Z is thus countable as well. The set Q of rational numbers is also countable
since ﬁxing any choice for writing each rational number as a ratio of two integers
yields an injection Q →Z × Z. It now follows that Qn, for any n ≥1, is countable
as well.
1.2.14
Relations
A relation R on a set X is a subset R ⊆X × X, but we write x Ry instead of (x, y) ∈
R. The relation R is said to be reﬂexive if x Rx holds for all x ∈X. The relation R
is symmetric if x Ry implies yRx, for all x, y ∈X. The relation R is anti-symmetric
if, for all x, y ∈X, the assertions x Ry and yRx together imply that x = y. Finally,
the relation R is said to be transitive if x Ry and yRz together imply x Rz, for all
x, y, z ∈X.
1.2.15
Equivalence Relations
A relation R on a set X is called an equivalence relation if it is reﬂexive, symmetric,
and transitive, in which case we denote R by ∼, and write x ∼y instead of x Ry. If
x ∼y we say that x and y are equivalent. A partition of X is a collection {Xi}i∈I of
non-empty pairwise disjoint subsets of X such that 
i∈I Xi = X.
Given a partition {Xi}i∈I of X, deﬁning x ∼y precisely when there exists an
i ∈I with x, y ∈Xi is easily seen to deﬁne an equivalence relation. If we denote by
Par(X) the set of all partitions of X and by Equ(X) the set of all equivalence relations
on X, then the process just described deﬁnes a function E : Par(X) →Equ(X).
Conversely, given an equivalence relation ∼on X we may deﬁne, for each x ∈X,
the set
[x] = {y ∈X | x ∼y}
of all those elements y ∈X which are equivalent to x. This set is known as the
equivalence class of x, and x is called a representative of the equivalence class [x]
(if it is important to emphasize the relation ∼, then we write [x]∼). It can easily
be veriﬁed that two elements x, y ∈X represent the same equivalence class, that

1.2 Preliminaries
17
is [x] = [y], if, and only if, x ∼y. It is completely straightforward to demonstrate
that the set {[x] | x ∈X} of all equivalence classes is a partition of X, and we thus
obtain a function P : Equ(X) →Par(X). It is quite easy to verify that in fact P is
the inverse function of E and thus we have established a bijective correspondence
between equivalence relations on X and partitions of X.
Given an equivalence relation ∼on a set X, the set {[x] | x ∈X} is denoted by
X/∼and is called the quotient set of X modulo ∼. There is also the corresponding
function π : X →X/∼, given by π(x) = [x], called the canonical projection.
1.2.16
Ordered Sets
A poset (short for partially ordered set) is a pair (X, ≤) where X is a set and ≤is
a reﬂexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric relation on X. Any one of the sets N, Z,
Q, and R has a familiar ordering making each one a poset. There is an abundance of
other useful posets.
Example 1.1 Given any set X, let P(X) be the set of all subsets of X. Deﬁning, for
subsets Y1, Y2 ⊆X, that Y1 ≤Y2 precisely when Y1 ⊆Y2, is easily seen to endow
P(X) with the structure of a poset. In this case we say that P(X) is ordered by set
inclusion. More generally, if A is some collection of subsets of X, then it too can be
endowed with the ordering induced by set inclusion, in precisely the same manner.
A related construction is to consider the set P of all pairs (Y, f ) where Y ⊆X and
f : Y →Z is a function to some ﬁxed set Z. Deﬁning (Y1, f1,) ≤(Y2, f2) when
Y1 ⊆Y2 and when f2 extends f1 (namely, f2(y) = f1(y) holds for all y ∈Y1) is
again easily seen to endow P with a poset structure. Again, one may consider variants
of this construction, for instance by demanding extra conditions on the sets Y or on
the functions f .
In the context of a general poset, the meaning of x < y is taken to be: x ≤y and
x ̸= y. The relations x > y and x ≥y are similarly derived from the given relation ≤.
Since not all elements x and y in a poset need be comparable (x and y are comparable
when either x ≤y or y ≤x), the correct interpretation of, for instance, the negation
of x ≤y is not that x > y but rather that either x and y are incomparable, or x > y.
Among all posets, some of which may be quite wild, a tamer sub-variety is formed
by the complete lattices.
Deﬁnition 1.1 Consider a subset S ⊆X of a poset X. The join of S is an element
 S ∈X characterised by the property

S ≤x ⇐⇒s ≤x for all s ∈S
for all x ∈X. Similarly, the meet of S is an element  S ∈X characterised by the
property

18
1
Introduction and Preliminaries
x ≤

S ⇐⇒x ≤s for all s ∈S
for all x ∈X.
Note that by taking x =  S the condition on the left is trivially satisﬁed and so
s ≤ S holds for all s ∈S. In other words,  S is an upper bound of S. Conversely,
if t ∈X is some upper bound of S, namely if s ≤t for all s ∈S, then taking x = t
the condition on the right is satisﬁed and so  S ≤t. Stated differently,  S can be
interpreted as the least upper bound of S. Similarly,  S can be seen as the greatest
lower bound of S.
When the set S consists of just two elements, say S = {a, b}, we write a ∨b and
a ∧b instead of, respectively, {a, b} and {a, b}. Similarly, the join of ﬁnitely
many elements is denoted by a1 ∨· · · ∨an and their meet by a1 ∧· · · ∧an.
For instance, in the poset P(X) ordered by set inclusion given S, T ∈P(X)
the fact that, for any subset W ⊆X, the inclusion S ∪T ⊆W is equivalent to the
inclusions S ⊆W and T ⊆W makes the union S ∪T the join of S and T in the
poset P(X). Similarly, one veriﬁes that the meet is given by S ∩T . More generally,
for any collection C ⊆P(X) of subsets of X one has

C =

S∈C
S and

C =

S∈C
S
computed in the poset P(X). In particular, P(X) admits all joins and all meets.
Posets with this property deserve special attention.
Deﬁnition 1.2 A poset X in which every subset S ⊆X admits a join  S and a
meet  S is called a complete lattice.
The discussion preceding the deﬁnition shows that P(X), for any set X, is a complete
lattice. Another naturally arising family of posets is, for each n ≥1, the set Dn
consisting of the positive divisors of n. Declaring k ≤m precisely when k divides m
introduces a poset structure on Dn. The join a ∨b is then the least common multiple
of a and b and the meet a ∧b is their greatest common divisor. In fact, Dn admits
all joins and meets and is thus a complete lattice.
In any poset X one can single out two special elements.
Deﬁnition 1.3 A bottom element in a poset X is an element ⊥∈X satisfying ⊥≤x
for all x ∈X. Similarly, a top element is an element ⊤∈X with x ≤⊤for all x ∈X.
In P(X) the bottom element is ⊥= ∅and the top element is ⊤= X while in Dn
we have ⊥= 1 and ⊤= n. Expectedly, top and bottom elements, joins and meets,
need not exist in an arbitrary poset. For instance, N with its usual ordering is a poset
with ⊥= 1 but no top element, and where every non-empty subset S ⊆N has a meet
given by the smallest element in S, and only ﬁnite subsets S admit a join given by
the largest element in S.
In the complete lattices we encountered above it was the case that top and bottom
elements were present. In fact, any complete lattice has a top element and a bottom
element due to the following observation.

1.2 Preliminaries
19
Proposition 1.1 The empty join  ∅in a poset X, if it exists, is precisely a bottom
element in X. Similarly, the empty meet  ∅in X, if it exists, is a top element.
Proof This is an exercise in carefully following deﬁnitions and correctly establishing
vacuous validity. We demonstrate that  ∅is a bottom element and leave the rest to
the reader. Assuming  ∅exists, its deﬁning property is that

∅≤x ⇐⇒s ≤x for all s ∈∅
for all x ∈X. But for any given x ∈X the condition on the right is vacuously true,
and so  ∅≤x. As x ∈X was arbitrary this makes  ∅the bottom element.
Implicit in the linguistic use of the deﬁnite article when referring to the join and
the top element, and similarly to the meet and the bottom element, is the following
uniqueness clause.
Proposition 1.2 Let X be a poset and S ⊆X a subset. If the join  S exists, then it
is unique. Similarly, if the meet  S exists, then it is unique.
Proof We establish the uniqueness of joins, so assume a, b ∈X are so that each
satisﬁes the deﬁning property of  S. If we can now show that a ≤b, then due to
the symmetry between the two, b ≤a would follow as well and thus the claim that
a = b. So, to show a ≤b, since a satisﬁes the deﬁning property of  S, it sufﬁces
to show that s ≤b for all s ∈S. Recall that we already established that  S is an
upper bound of S, and so, since b satisﬁes the properties of  S, it is indeed the case
that s ≤b for all s ∈S. This completes the argument.
The feeling one gets when translating claims and proofs about joins to their coun-
terparts about meets is of repeating the same argument while standing upside down.
The redundancy of adapting claims and proofs in the obvious manner can be avoided
through a formal process of turning a poset X to its opposite. In more detail, if X is a
poset, then its opposite Xop is the same set but where the ordering has been reversed,
namely x ≤y holds in Xop precisely when y ≤x holds in X. It is routine to verify
that Xop is a poset. Every concept of posets now acquires a dual by interpreting the
same concept in the opposite poset. In this way, top element is dual to bottom element
and, more generally, joins are dual to meets.
1.2.17
Zorn’s Lemma
A poset P is said to be linearly ordered or a total order if for all x, y ∈P either
x ≤y or y ≤x holds. The poset P(X) discussed in Example 1.1 is linearly ordered
if, and only if, |X| ≤1.
Any subset S ⊆P in a poset (P, ≤) inherits a poset structure from P. We also
say that P induces a poset structure on S. In more detail, the poset S is given by

Introduction and Preliminaries
the ordering ⪯deﬁned, for all x, y ∈S by x ⪯y precisely when x ≤y in P. We
usually do not make any notational distinction between ≤and the induced order ⪯
and simply write x ≤y when referring to the ordering in S.
Deﬁnition 1.4 Achain inaposet P isasubset S ⊆P that,withtheinducedordering,
is linearly ordered. An upper bound of a set S ⊆P (whether a chain or not) is an
element y ∈P for which x ≤y holds for all x ∈S. A maximal element in a poset
P is an element yM such that yM < x does not hold for any x ∈P.
Notice that upper and lower bounds were encountered in the discussion on lattices
above where we remarked that the join is the least upper bound and the meet is the
greatest lower bound.
Lemma 1.1 (Zorn’s Lemma) Let P be a non-empty poset. If every chain in P has
an upper bound, then P has a maximal element.
Zorn’s Lemma is a powerful tool that is more of a proof technique than a lemma in
much the same way that proof by induction is a proof technique rather than a lemma.
A proof of Zorn’s Lemma is subtle and in fact it is well-known that Zorn’s Lemma
is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.
1.2.18
A Typical Application of Zorn’s Lemma
Given any two sets X and Y, it is natural to wonder if their cardinalities compare.
That is, is it always the case that either |X| ≤|Y| or |Y| ≤|X|? A positive answer
to this question turns out to be equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. We will only
prove half of this equivalence, primarily to illustrate a typical application of Zorn’s
Lemma.
Theorem 1.5 For all sets X and Y either |X| ≤|Y| or |Y| ≤|X|.
Proof The case where either X or Y is empty is easily dispensed with, and so we
proceed under the assumption that both are non-empty. As a ﬁrst step we construct
a suitable poset, similar to the one given in Example 1.1.
Let P be the set of triples (X′, f, Y ′) where X′ ⊆X, Y ′ ⊆Y, and f : X′ →Y ′
is an injective function. The partial order structure on P is given by
(X′, f, Y ′) ≤(X′′, g, Y ′′)
precisely when
X′ ⊆X′′,
Y ′ ⊆Y ′′,
and g(x) = f (x) for all x ∈X′.
It is straightforward to verify that this is indeed a partial order.

1.2 Preliminaries
21
Next, we show that (P, ≤) satisﬁes the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma. Firstly,
P ̸= ∅since the triple (∅, ∅, ∅) is in P. Next, suppose that {(Xi, fi, Yi)}i∈I is a chain
in P, and we shall construct an upper bound for it. Let
X0 =

i∈I
Xi
Y0 =

i∈I
Yi
and f : X0 →Y0 given by
f (x) = fix(x).
Let us explain the deﬁnition of the function f . Given any x ∈X0, there is an ix ∈I
such that x ∈Xix. We may thus consider the value fix(x) ∈Yix ⊆Y0. However, there
may be another index i′
x ∈I with x ∈Xi′x, and, a-priori,
fi′x(x) ̸= fix(x)
is a possibility. However, since {(Xi, fi, Yi)}i∈I is a chain, we may assume, without
loss of generality, that (Xix, fix, Yix) ≤(Xi′x, fi′x, Yi′x). But then, the deﬁnition of ≤
in P implies that
fi′x(x) = fix(x)
and so the function f : X0 →Y0 above is well deﬁned. A similar argument shows
that f is injective.
Now that we have veriﬁed the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma we are guaranteed
of the existence of a maximal element (X M, fM, YM) ∈P. That is, fM : X M →YM
is an injective function for some X M ⊆X and YM ⊆Y. Let us now entertain the
possibility that both X M and YM are proper subsets, namely, that there exist elements
x! ∈X \ X M and y! ∈Y \ YM. But then we may deﬁne
X! = X M ∪{x!}
Y! = YM ∪{y!}
and f! : X! →Y! by
f!(x) =

fM(x) if x ∈X M
y!
if x = x!
giving rise to the element (X!, f!, Y!) ∈P (the reader is invited to verify membership
in P) with
(X M, fM, YM) < (X!, f!, Y!),
contradicting the maximality of (X M, fM, YM).

1.2.19
The Real Numbers
The set R of real numbers may be constructed in numerous different ways and can
also be characterized axiomatically in different ways. We will not concern ourselves
here with the construction of a model of the reals, and thus accept its existence and
only state the governing axioms, namely that the reals form a Dedekind complete
totally ordered ﬁeld.
The statement that R, with addition and multiplication, is a ﬁeld is the claim that
the following axioms hold:
Associativity of addition:
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
Commutativity of addition:
a + b = b + a
Neutrality of 0:
a + 0 = a
Existence of additive inverses:
a + x = 0 admits a solution
Associativity of multiplication:
(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)
Commutativity of multiplication:
a · b = b · a
Neutrality of 1:
1 · a = a
Existence of reciprocals
a · x = 1 admits a solution if a ̸= 0
Distributivity:
a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c
for all a, b, c ∈R. In general, any set K with addition and multiplication operations,
and distinguished elements 0 ̸= 1 in K, that satisfy these axioms is said to be a ﬁeld.
For instance, both C and Q, with the usual notion of addition and multiplication, are
ﬁelds. In contrast, Z with the same familiar addition and multiplication is not a ﬁeld.
The statement that the reals form an ordered ﬁeld is the claim that, with the usual
notion of a ≤b for the real numbers, R is a totally ordered set, and that the following
axioms hold:
Translation invariance:
a ≤b =⇒a + c ≤b + c
Scale invariance:
a ≤b =⇒a · c ≤b · c, if c ≥0

1.2 Preliminaries
23
for all a, b, c ∈R. In general, a ﬁeld K with a total order on it such that these two
axioms hold is called an ordered ﬁeld. For instance, Q with the usual ordering is
an ordered ﬁeld. For the ﬁeld C, however, it can be shown that no ordering exists
turning it into an ordered ﬁeld.
Finally, perhaps the most important property of the ﬁeld of real numbers, and
certainly one that sets it apart among all ordered ﬁelds, is its Dedekind completeness.
Using the language of complete lattices, ﬁrst we note that the ordering of the reals
makes R a poset and we may wonder wether it is a complete lattice or not. The
question is thus whether all subsets admit a join and a meet. Certainly, a set that is
not bounded above, for instance N cannot have a join in R. For a similar reason, the
empty set does not have a meet since the empty meet is the top element and clearly
R lacks a top element. Similarly, sets not bounded below fail to have a meet and the
empty join does not exist. An ordered ﬁeld in which unboundedness and emptiness
are the only obstructions for possessing meets and joins is said to be Dedekind
complete. The ﬁeld R of real numbers does have this property.
We phrase it in more detail using the synonym ‘supremum’ instead of ‘join’.
Recall that an upper bound for a subset S ⊆R is a real number a such that s ≤a
for all s ∈S. A supremum (or least upper bound) of S is an upper bound a with the
property that if b is any upper bound of S, then a ≤b. Similarly, one deﬁnes the
inﬁmum (or greatest lower bound) of S to be a lower bound that is not smaller than
any other lower bound. The statement that R is Dedekind complete is the claim: any
non-empty bounded above subset S ⊆R has a supremum. It can then be shown that
this property is equivalent to: any non-empty bounded below subset S ⊆R has an
inﬁmum.
In general, any Dedekind complete ordered ﬁeld can be taken as essentially the
ﬁeld of the real numbers. In other words, the axioms listed above of a Dedekind
complete ordered ﬁeld determine the reals up to an isomorphism, meaning that the
only difference between any two Dedekind complete ordered ﬁelds is the naming of
the elements.
1.2.20
The Complex Numbers
The ﬁeld C of complex numbers is an important extension of the ﬁeld of real numbers.
We give, in condensed form, the basics of the algebraic and analytical properties of
C.
A complex number z ∈C consists of a real part Re(z) and an imaginary part
Im(z), each a real number. This is indicated in the cartesian notation
z = Re(z) + iIm(z)
where i is a formal symbol. We often write z = x + iy where it is understood that x
is then the real part and y the imaginary part of z. The set

24
1
Introduction and Preliminaries
C = {x + iy | x, y ∈R}
is thus the set of complex numbers. By identifying a real number x with the complex
number x + i · 0 we may write R ⊂C. Addition and multiplication of complex
numbers is given by
(x1 + iy1) + (x2 + iy2) = (x1 + x2) + i(y1 + y2)
(x1 + iy1) · (x2 + iy2) = (x1x2 −y1y2) + i(x1y2 + x2y1)
which arise by preservation of the algebraic structure of R and setting i2 = −1. It is
a lengthy yet largely uneventful exercise to verify that with these operations C is a
ﬁeld.
The real numbers are often depicted as forming the real line. The complex num-
bers, since each is a pair of real numbers, form a plane and consequently enjoy a rich
geometry. The modulus of z = x + iy is the real number
|z| =

x2 + y2
and it measures the length of the segment from the origin to z. The conjugate of z is
z = x −iy
obtained by reﬂection through the real line. The two operations are related by the
equality
|z|2 = zz
as a straightforward computation shows. Given an angle θ we write
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ,
and elementary trigonometry reveals it to be a complex number of modulus 1 forming
an angle of θ radians from the positive real axis to it. Moreover, the formula
ei(θ+ρ) = eiθ · eiρ
is readily veriﬁed. In other words, the set
{eiθ | 0 ≤θ < 2π}
corresponds precisely to the unit circle in the plane. Now suppose z ̸= 0. The number
z/|z| is then a point on the unit circle and so we can write z/|z| = eiθ for a suitable
angle. Denoting r = |z| we obtain the polar decomposition

1.2 Preliminaries
25
z = reiθ
where, in this form, r is the modulus and θ is the argument of the complex number.
It is worth noting that addition of complex numbers is best carried out in cartesian
form while multiplication is simpliﬁed in polar form.
Finally we mention the striking analytical difference between R and C. Clearly,
not every polynomial with real coefﬁcients has a root (e.g., x2 + 1). This same
polynomial does have a root in C, namely i. The ﬁeld of complex numbers can be
viewed as an extension of the reals obtained by adjoining just this one new root of
a single polynomial that failed to have a root in R. Quite profoundly this process
cannot be repeated with polynomials with coefﬁcients in C. This is the content of
the fundamental theorem of algebra which we state without proof.
Theorem 1.6 For any polynomial function f (z) with complex coefﬁcients there
exists a complex number w with f (w) = 0.

Introduction and Preliminaries
Exercise 1.6 State and prove distributivity properties of union over intersection in
the spirit of the previous exercise. Also, show the last item there implies the others.
Exercise 1.7 Assume a set of discourse S. For a set X ⊆S show X ∩Xc = ∅. In
fact, prove that among all subsets Y ⊆S with X ∩Y = ∅, the complement of X is
the largest one.
Exercise 1.8 Fix a set X and recall the correspondence F from P(X) to the set I(X)
of indicator functions X →{0, 1} given by F(S)(x) = 1 if, and only if, x ∈S. Any
function ψ : {0, 1} × {0, 1} →{0, 1} deﬁnes an operation ∗ψ on I(X) by ( f ∗ψ
g)(x) = ψ( f (x), g(x)) and thus an operation on subsets S, T ⊆X by S ⋆ψ T =
F−1(F(S) ∗ψ F(T )). Enumerate all functions ψ and express each corresponding set
operation ⋆ψ in terms of set operations. Extending this idea, express, for a function
f : X →Y, the inverse image function f −1 : P(Y) →P(X) in terms of indicator
functions. Can you do the same for the direct image function?
Exercise 1.9 Show that if a set X has n elements, then the power set P(X) has 2n
elements.
Exercise 1.10 Show that a set X satisﬁes |X| = 1 if, and only if, |X × Y| = |Y|
holds for all sets Y.
Exercise 1.11 Let X be a set. Prove that:
1. For every set Y there exists a unique function X →Y if, and only if, X = ∅.
2. For every set Y there exists a unique function Y →X if, and only if, X is a
singleton set.
Exercise 1.12 Consider sets X, Y and the diagram
in which πX(x, y) = x and πY(x, y) = y are the projection functions. The diagram
reads as: for all sets T and functions fX, fY there exists a unique function g satisfying
πX ◦g = fX and πY ◦g = fY. Prove this is so.
Exercise 1.13 Consider sets X, Y and the diagram
in which X  Y = (X × {1}) ∪(Y × {2}), ιX(x) = (x, 1), and ιY(y) = (y, 2). The
diagram reads as: for all sets T and functions fX, fY there exists a unique function
g satisfying g ◦ιX = fX and g ◦ιY = fY. Prove this is so. Note the formal duality
between this diagram and the one in the previous exercise.

1.2 Preliminaries

Exercise 1.14 For sets X, Y, Z construct explicit bijections showing:
1. |Z X∪Y| = |Z X × ZY| provided X ∩Y = ∅.
2. |(X × Y)Z| = |X Z × Y Z|.
3. |Z X×Y| = |(ZY)X| = |(Z X)Y|.
In the ﬁrst item, what happens if X and Y are not disjoint? How can you ﬁx the
problem?
Exercise 1.15 Under what conditions on sets X, Y, Z is the cartesian product
an associative operation? In general show that |(X × Y) × Z| = |X × (Y × Z)|
by using the associator function aX,Y,Z : (X × Y) × Z →X × (Y × Z) given by
aX,Y,Z((x, y), z) = (x, (y, z)).
Exercise 1.16 Consider four sets W, X, Y, Z and the diagram
where the functions are obtained from the family of associator functions from
the previous exercise. For instance, the function at the bottom is given by W ×
aX,Y,Z(w, ((x, y), z)) = (w, (x, (y, z))). Verify that the diagram commutes in the
sense that the two compositions starting at the top of the diagram are equal func-
tions. Mac Lane’s coherence theorem states that the commutativity of this pentagon
implies the commutativity of any diagram built from associators. It is the mathemat-
ical reason why it is safe to pretend that the cartesian product of sets is associative.
Exercise 1.17 The sets R × R2 and R3 are different but in bijective correspon-
dence and are often identiﬁed. The previous exercise gives a precise and safe such
identiﬁcation. Prior to any identiﬁcation consider the set T whose elements are all
possible tuples that one can construct from the real numbers, including tuples of
tuples to any ﬁnite degree of nesting (e.g., (1, (3, 2), (1, (1, 2)), (1, 2, 2, 3)) is a
possible element in T ). For any t ∈T let −t be deﬁned by negating all of the num-
bers appearing in t. For X ⊆T let −X = {−x | x ∈X}. For any three such sets
X, Y, Z let βX,Y,Z : (X × Y) × Z →X × (Y × Z) be given by βX,Y,Z((x, y), z) =
(−x, (−y, −z)). Show that even though βX,Y,Z is a bijection the pentagon from
the previous exercise does not generally commute. Contemplate the headache that
would ensue if one carelessly used this family of functions to make the familiar
identiﬁcations.
Exercise 1.18 Let X beaset.Showtheexistenceofaninjectivefunction X →P(X)
from X to its power set. Show that no such function can be surjective as follows.
Suppose that such a function f exists and use it to deﬁne the set S = {x ∈X | x /∈
f (x)}. Exploit the surjectivity of f to obtain s ∈X with S = f (s) and reach a
contradiction.

Introduction and Preliminaries
Exercise 1.19 For sets X and Y write |X| < |Y| to mean that |X| ≤|Y| yet |X| ̸=
|Y|. State the meaning of |X| < |Y| in terms of the existence and non-existence
of suitable functions. Use the previous exercise to prove Cantor’s Theorem: |X| <
|P(X)| for all sets X. Deduce that a set of largest cardinality does not exist, nor does
the set of all sets.
Exercise 1.20 Let f : X →Y and g : Y →Z be functions and consider the direct

T ⊆Y. Exhibit cases of strict inclusion.
Exercise 1.21 Let X be a countable set. Show that the set Pﬁn(X) of all ﬁnite subsets
S ⊆X is countable. Establish a bijection between Pﬁn(X) and Pcof(X) of all co-
ﬁnite subsets S ⊆X, namely those for which X \ S is ﬁnite. Conclude that Pcof(X)
is countable. Let T be the set of all inﬁnite subsets S ⊆X whose complement X \ S
is also inﬁnite. Is T countable?
Exercise 1.22 Any two closed intervals in R have the same cardinality. Demonstrate
that with explicit bijections. Do the same for any two open intervals as well as any
open ray and the set R.
Exercise 1.23 For a set X let Bij(X) be the set of all bijections f : X →X. Show
for ﬁnite X with |X| = n that |Bij(X)| = n!. What is the cardinality of Bij(N)?
Exercise 1.24 Forafunction f : X →Y and y ∈Y considertheequation f (x) = y.
Show that:
1. The function f is injective if, and only if, for each y ∈Y the equation has at most
one solution.
2. The function f is surjective if, and only if, for each y ∈Y the equation has at
least one solution.
3. The function f is bijective if, and only if, for each y ∈Y the equation has a
unique solution.
Exercise 1.25 Let f : X →Y be a function. Say that f is left-cancelable if for all
sets T and functions g, h : T →X, if f ◦g = f ◦h, then g = h. Similarly, f is
right-cancelable if for all sets T and functions g, h : Y →T , if g ◦f = h ◦f , then
g = h. Show that:
1.
f is injective if, and only if, f is left-cancelable.
2.
f is surjective if, and only if, f is right-cancelable.
3.
f is bijective if, and only if, f is and left and right-cancelable.
Exercise 1.26 Injectivity of a function cannot be lost by restricting the domain nor
can it be gained by extending the function to a larger domain. Give a mathematically
rigorousformulationofthisclaimandthenproveit.Similarly,formalisetheclaimthat
surjectivity of a function can be gained by restricting the codomain or by extending

Exercise 1.27 Prove that for ﬁnite sets X, Y of equal cardinality injectivity, surjec-
tivity, and bijectivity of a function f : X →Y coincide. Show that the ﬁniteness
assumption is crucial.
Exercise 1.28 If functions X
f−→Y
g−→X satisfy g ◦f = idX, then f is said to be
a left inverse of g and g a right inverse of f .
1. Show that h : S →T with S ̸= ∅is injective if, and only if, h has a left inverse.
2. Show that any h : S →T is surjective if, and only if, h has a right inverse.
(Caution: this claim is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice).
Exercise 1.29 With notation as in the previous exercise, for X and Y ﬁnite show
that if f has a left inverse, then it is bijective. For a set S denote by S∞the set of
all inﬁnite sequences of elements of S. By considering a suitable shift operation on
S∞show that the ﬁniteness assumption is crucial. What happens if one replaces left
inverse by the evident notion of right inverse?
Exercise 1.30 Show that injectivity is preserved under composition in the sense
that the composition of two injective functions is injective. Show that surjectivity
and bijectivity are also preserved under composition.
Exercise 1.31 Construct a set X that has an element x ∈X satisfying x ⊆X. Use
X to obtain a function f : X →Y for which f (x) is ambiguous (in the context of
the direct image function). For each n ≥1 ﬁnd a set Xn and a function f : Xn →Y
such that the expression f (S) = { f (s) | s ∈S} for the direct image function has n
distinct meanings. Are inﬁnitely many meanings possible?
Exercise 1.32 Consider the set P(X) of all subsets of a given set X. With union
playing the role of addition and intersection as multiplication, which of the ﬁeld
axioms are satisﬁed?
Exercise 1.33 Consider the set S of all sequences s = (s1, s2, . . . ) of real numbers.
With addition and multiplication deﬁned component wise, which of the ﬁeld axioms
hold true for S?
Exercise 1.34 A ﬁlter on a set X is a collection F of subsets of X with the properties
that ∅/∈F, X ∈F, F ∈F and F ⊆S ⊆X imply S ∈F, and F1, F2 ∈F implies
F1 ∩F2 ∈F. It is convenient to think of the sets in F as large portions of X. Show
that if X is an inﬁnite set, then the collection F consisting of those subsets F ⊆X
whose complement X \ F is ﬁnite forms a ﬁlter (known as the Fréchet ﬁlter).
A ﬁlter F is an ultraﬁlter if for any subset S ⊆X either S ∈F or X \ S ∈F. Use
Zorn’s Lemma to prove that every ﬁlter F on a set X is contained in an ultraﬁlter on
X.
Exercise 1.35 With reference to the previous exercise let F be the Fréchet ﬁlter
on the set N of natural numbers and let G be an ultraﬁlter containing F. Introduce
the relation ∼on S by declaring s ∼t when the set {n ∈N | sn = tn} belongs to the

a property P holds for [s] ∈S/∼precisely when the set {n ∈N | sn has propertyP}
belongs to G. Show independence of the representative s.
Exercise 1.36 An inﬁnitesimal is an element t satisfying t > 0 and t < 1/n for all
natural numbers n. Prove that R does not contain any inﬁnitesimals. Building on the
previous exercise show that in the ﬁeld S/∼the element [s] where sn = 1/n is an
inﬁnitesimal.
Exercise 1.37 Let X be a set and O(X) the set of all partial order relations on X.
Declare, for ≤1, ≤2 in O(X), that ≤1⪯≤2 if x ≤2 y whenever x ≤1 y. Prove the
following:
1. The relation ⪯is a partial order on O(X).
2. Any chain in O(X) has an upper bound.
3. There exist maximal elements in O(X) and each is a linear ordering.
4. Any partial ordering on X can be extended to a linear ordering. Hint: Use Zorn’s
Lemma on a slightly adapted O(X).
5. Any partial ordering on X is the intersection of all linear orderings containing it.
6. The intersection of all linear orders on X is the equality relation.
Exercise 1.38 Prove that in any ordered ﬁeld if x ̸= 0, then x2 > 0. Deduce that
there is no ordering on C making the complex numbers an ordered ﬁeld.
Exercise 1.39 Fix a set R and for any set X write X∗for the set of all functions
f : X →R. Show that G(x)( f ) = f (x) deﬁnes a function G : X →(X∗)∗. Is G
injective? Is it surjective? Could the answer change under certain conditions on R or
on X?
Exercise 1.40 Show that every function f : X →Y can be written as a composition
f = g ◦h where g is injective and h is surjective. Show that f can also be written
as such a composition but with g surjective and h injective.
Exercise 1.41 Let X, Y be sets. A set operator is a function O : P(X) →P(Y) that
is monotone, i.e., O(S) ⊆O(T ) whenever S ⊆T ⊆X. Deﬁne an order relation
on the set Ope(X, Y) of all set operators O : X →Y by setting O1 ≤O2 when
O1(S) ⊆O2(S) for all S ⊆X. Show that Ope(X, Y) with ≤is a complete lattice.
Complementation in the domain and codomain enables the deﬁnition of the
complement of O, i.e., Oc(S) = (O(Sc))c. Show that O →Oc deﬁnes a func-
tion Ope(X, Y) →Ope(X, Y) that reverses the ordering, namely if O1 ≤O2, then
(O2)c ≤(O1)c. Show further that O is expanding, i.e., S ⊆O(S), if, and only if, Oc
is shrinking, i.e., Oc(S) ⊆S.
Exercise 1.42 With terminology from the previous exercise, consider a function
f : X →Y. Show that the inverse image f ←: P(Y) →P(X) and the direct image
f→: P(X) →P(Y) are operators.

The closing section of this chapter (and of each of the forthcoming chapters) consists
of suggestions for further reading. The list of sources is deliberately kept short and
is thus by necessity not comprehensive. It aims to be a starting point for the reader
interested in reading more about particular aspects of the chapter that, for whatever
reason, were not elaborated upon in the text.
For a broad historical perspective on the development of modern mathematics,
including a detailed discussion of the birth of modern mathematical analysis, see [11].
The reader interested in the interplay between mathematics as a formal system and
the real world, and the student bafﬂed by the usefulness of mathematics in physics,
is referred to [8]. For a discussion of the internal forces governing and inﬂuencing
the development of mathematics see the classic text [7]. Along these lines a modern,
comprehensive, and sharp philosophical discussion is offered by [3].
For a more in-depth treatment of set theory the reader may consult the book [9]
which is also an introduction to logic and proof theory. This book also includes
a detailed and elementary presentation of the Axiom of Choice and some of its
equivalents, i.e., Zorn’s Lemma, Zermelo’s well-ordering principle, and the principle
of cardinal comparability, as well as an elementary treatment of cardinal arithmetic.
Various books (e.g., [6, 10]) address the Axiom of Choice from a historical point-
of-view, discussing its inﬂuence on and within mathematics.
For more on the various possibilities of constructing the real numbers see [12].
Some constructions refer to techniques of nonstandard analysis, i.e., to models of real
numbers that contain actual inﬁnitesimals. The reader interested in this somewhat
unorthodox approach to analysis may consult the books [1, 4, 5] as well as [2] giving
an eightfold path to the subject.

Chapter 2
Linear Spaces
This chapter assumes a rudimentary understanding of the linear structure of Rn,
a very rich structure, both algebraically and geometrically. Elements in Rn, when
thought of as vectors, that is as entities representing direction and magnitude, can
be used to form parallelograms, can be scaled, the angle between two vectors can
be computed, and the length of a vector can be found. These geometric features are
given algebraically by means of, respectively, vector addition, scalar multiplication,
the inner product of two vectors, and the norm of a vector. In this chapter these notions
are abstracted to give rise to the concepts of linear space, inner product space, and
normed space.
The chapter gives a detailed presentation of all of the relevant notions of linear
spaces, provides examples, and contains rigorous proofs of all of the results therein.
Exploiting the assumption of a rudimentary understanding of the linear structure
of Rn, and thus of ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces, the chapter has as secondary
goal the elucidation of the subtleties of inﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces. This is an
absolute necessity with Hilbert spaces in mind since the inﬁnite-dimensional ones
are paramount.
A consequence of this inﬁnite-dimensional theme of the chapter is that some
proofs are considerably more involved than their ﬁnite-dimensional counterparts.
In particular, the theorems establishing the existence of bases and the concept of
dimension are sophisticated and resort to an application of Zorn’s Lemma. Also,
cardinality considerations are important, since one needs to be able to compute, at
least a little bit, with inﬁnite quantities. To facilitate an easier reading of this chapter,
the Preliminaries contain an account of Zorn’s Lemma (Sect. 1.2.17) and basic car-
dinal arithmetic (Sects. 1.2.12 and 1.2.13). Moreover, the text below indicates which
proofs can safely be skipped on a ﬁrst reading, leaving it to the discretion of the
reader when, and whether, to tackle the technicalities involved in mastering the more
advanced techniques.
Section 2.1 introduces the axioms of linear spaces in full generality, establishes
basic properties and explores examples, most of which will be revisited throughout

the book. Section 2.2 is concerned with establishing the notion of dimension for an
arbitrary linear space. In particular, the dimension need not be ﬁnite, which, at times,
necessitates some more intricate proofs. Section 2.3 discusses linear operators, the
natural choice of structure preserving functions between linear spaces, studies their
basic properties, and discusses the notion of isomorphic linear spaces. Section 2.4
introduces standard constructions producing new spaces from given ones, and in
particular the kernel and image of a linear operator are discussed. The ﬁnal section
is devoted to inner product spaces and normed spaces and presents several important
examples such as function spaces and sequence spaces.
2.1
Linear Spaces—Elementary Properties and Examples
In R2 the scalar product α · x is between a real number α ∈R and a vector x ∈R2,
and yields again a vector in R2. However, in similar situations, such as in C2, the
scalar multiplication α · x is now deﬁned between any complex number α ∈C and
an arbitrary vector x. The most general situation is when α is allowed to vary over
the elements of an arbitrary (but ﬁxed) ﬁeld K. Prominent examples of ﬁelds are the
ﬁeld R of real numbers and the ﬁeld C of complex numbers (for a more detailed
discussion of ﬁelds the reader is referred to Sect. 1.2.19 of the Preliminaries). The
deﬁnition of linear space given below is the result of the distillation of key properties
of vector addition and scalar multiplication in R2 or R3, and is formalized in the
most general form, namely with arbitrary ﬁelds. If the reader is not familiar with any
ﬁelds other than R and C (and Q, the ﬁeld of rational numbers), then it is perfectly
safe to proceed and replace any occurrence of an arbitrary ﬁeld K by either R or C.
In the context of this book these are in any case the most important ﬁelds.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Linear Space) Let K be an arbitrary ﬁeld (such as the ﬁeld of real
numbers or of complex numbers, for concreteness). A set V of elements x, y, z, ...
of arbitrary nature, together with an operation, called vector addition, or simply
addition, associating with any two elements x, y ∈V an element z ∈V , called the
sum of x and y, and denoted by z = x + y, as well as an operation associating with
any x ∈V and α ∈K an element w ∈V , called the product or scalar product of α
and x, and denoted by w = α · x, is called a linear space if:
1. For all x, y, z ∈V , the operation of vector addition satisﬁes:
Associativity:
(x + y) + z = x + (y + z))
Commutativity:
x + y = y + x
Existence of aneutralelement:
there exists 0 ∈V with x + 0 = x = 0 + x
Existence of additive inverses :
there is x′ ∈V with x + x′ = 0 = x′ + x.
2. For all x ∈V and α, β ∈K, the scalar product operation satisﬁes:

2.1 Linear Spaces—Elementary Properties and Examples
37
Associativity:
α · (β · x) = (αβ) · x
Neutrality of ﬁeld unit:
1 · x = x.
3. For all x, y ∈V and α, β ∈K, the scalar product and vector addition operations
are compatible in the sense that
Scalar product distributes over vector addition:
α · (x + y) = α · x + α · y
Scalar product distributes over scalar addition:
(α + β) · x = α · x + β · x.
A linear space is also called a vector space, its elements are called vectors, and
the elements of the ﬁeld K are called scalars. If we wish to emphasize the relevant
ﬁeld, then we say that V is a linear space over K. Otherwise, the assertion that V is
a linear space includes the implicit introduction of a ﬁeld K serving as the ﬁeld of
scalars for V .
Scalars will typically be denoted by lowercase greek letters from the beginning of
the alphabet, namely α, β, γ, and so on, while vectors will be denoted by x, y, z, etc.
Subscripts or superscripts may be used to enhance readability.
2.1.1
Elementary Properties of Linear Spaces
We establish several properties of linear spaces that follow immediately from the
axioms.
Proposition 2.1 In any linear space V the following statements hold.
1. The neutral element 0 ∈V is unique.
2. For all x ∈V the additive inverse x′ is unique.
3. For all α ∈K and x ∈V the equation α · x = 0 holds if, and only if, α = 0 or
x = 0.
Proof 1. Suppose that 0′ ∈V is, like 0 ∈V , a neutral element. That is
x + 0′ = x
for all x ∈V , and thus using the neutrality of 0′, commutativity, and the neutrality
of 0 lead to
0 = 0 + 0′ = 0′ + 0 = 0′.
2. Suppose that x′′ ∈V satisﬁes that x + x′′ = 0, then
x′ = x′ + 0 = x′ + (x + x′′) = (x′ + x) + x′′ = 0 + x′′ = x′′.
3. For α = 0

Linear Spaces
α · x = 0 · x = (0 + 0) · x = 0 · x + 0 · x =⇒0 · x = 0.
For x = 0
α · x = α · 0 = α · (0 + 0) = α · 0 + α · 0 =⇒α · 0 = 0.
In the other direction, if α · x = 0 and α ̸= 0, then upon multiplication by α−1
one obtains
x = 1 · x = (α−1 · α) · x = α−1 · (α · x) = α−1 · 0 = 0.
□
Remark 2.1 It similarly follows that for any vector x, the additive inverse x′ is given
by x′ = (−1) · x. It is further common to neglect the · denoting the scalar product,
write x′ = −x and resort to the familiar conventions for algebraic manipulations on
vectors and scalars commonly used for addition and multiplication, e.g., we write
x −y for x + (−y) or x + y + z for (x + y) + z, and so on. This convention, of
course, considerably shortens proofs such as those given above and will be silently
used throughout the text below.
Remark 2.2 Most of the linear spaces we are concerned with will be over the ﬁeld
R of real numbers, in which case they are called real linear spaces, or over the ﬁeld
C of complex numbers, in which case they are called complex linear spaces. In the
absence of further speciﬁcation, or as implied by context, a linear space is assumed
to be either a real or a complex linear space.
Remark 2.3 We make no notational distinction between the zero vector, i.e., the
neutral element with respect to vector addition, and the element 0 in the ﬁeld K. This
is generally a safe practice since context typically points to the correct interpretation.
For instance, in the equation 0 · x = 0, context dictates that the 0 on the left-hand
side is the scalar 0 ∈K while on the right-hand side it is the zero vector 0 ∈V .
2.1.2
Examples of Linear Spaces
Since linear spaces are very common in mathematics, presenting an exhaustive list
of linear spaces is a daunting task. The chosen examples below are meant to present
some commonly occurring linear spaces, to explore some less common possibilities,
and to familiarize the reader with some linear spaces of great importance in the
context of this book. The latter refers to linear spaces of sequences and functions,
which will be revisited throughout the book.
Example 2.1 In the familiar spaces R2 and R3, the mathematical models of the
physical plane and space, vector addition has the geometric interpretation known

2.1 Linear Spaces—Elementary Properties and Examples
39
as the parallelogram law, while scalar multiplication αx has a scaling effect on the
vector x determined by the magnitude and sign of α.
Example 2.2 Given a natural number n ≥1, let Rn be the set of n-tuples of real
numbers. Thus if x ∈Rn, then it is of the form x = (x1, . . . , xn) where (for every
1 ≤k ≤n) xk, the k-th component of x, is a real number.
For all x, y ∈Rn and α ∈R deﬁning
x + y = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2, . . . , xn + yn)
αx = (αx1, αx2, . . . , αxn),
endows Rn with the structure of a linear space over the ﬁeld R, as is easy to verify.
Obviously, the cases n = 2 and n = 3 recover the familiar linear spaces R2 and R3.
Analogously, the set Cn of all n-tuples of complex numbers, with similar coordinate-
wise operations, is a linear space over the ﬁeld C.
Example 2.3 Let R∞be the set of inﬁnite sequences of real numbers. Thus, a
typical element x ∈R∞is of the form x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk, . . .) where xk ∈R, for
each k ≥1, is a real number called the k-th component of x. For all x, y ∈R∞and
α ∈R setting
x + y = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2, . . . , xk + yk, . . .)
αx = (αx1, αx2, . . . , αxk, . . .)
endows R∞with the structure of a linear space over the ﬁeld R, as is easily seen.
Similarly, the set C∞of all inﬁnite sequences of complex numbers, with similar
coordinate-wise operations, is a linear space over the ﬁeld C.
Remark 2.4 The convention that for an element x in either Rn, Cn, R∞, or C∞its
k-th component is denoted by xk (as illustrated in the preceding examples) will be
used throughout this text. To refer to a sequence of such vectors we may thus use
super scripts for the different vectors, e.g., {x(m)}m≥1, and then x(m)
k
refers to the k-th
component of the m-th vector.
Example 2.4 Consider the subset c ⊆C∞consisting of all convergent sequences
(here convergence is in the usual sense of convergence of sequences of complex
numbers), let c0 ⊆c be the subset consisting of all sequences that converge to 0, and
let c00 ⊆c0 be the set
c00 = {(x1, . . . , xm, 0, 0, 0, . . .) | m ≥1,
x1, . . . , xm ∈C}
of all sequences that are eventually 0. With the same deﬁnition of addition and
multiplication as in Example 2.3, each of these sets is easily seen to be a linear space
over C. Obviously, replacing C throughout by R yields similar linear spaces over R.

Linear Spaces
Example 2.5 The constructions given above of the linear spaces Rn, Cn, R∞, and
C∞easily generalize to any ﬁeld K and to any cardinality. Indeed, consider an
arbitrary set B and an arbitrary ﬁeld K. Recall from the Preliminaries (Sect. 1.2.8)
that the set K B is the set of all functions x : B →K. For all such functions
x : B →K,
y : B →K
and
α ∈K
deﬁne the functions x + y : B →K and αx : B →K by
(x + y)(b) = x(b) + y(b),
(αx)(b) = α · x(b).
With these notions of addition and scalar multiplication the set K B is easily seen to
be a linear space over K. In particular, we obtain the linear spaces R{1,2,...,n} = Rn,
C{1,2,...,n} = Cn, RN = R∞, and CN = C∞. Further, restricting attention to the subset
(K B)0 consisting only of those functions x : B →K for which x(b) = 0 for all but
ﬁnitely many b ∈B also yields a linear space, with exactly the same deﬁnition for
addition and scalar multiplication as in K B. In particular the linear space c00 from
Example 2.4 is recovered by noticing that c00 = (CN)0. Note that the spaces c and c0
rely on the analytical notion of convergence and so their analogues are not available
for arbitrary B.
Example 2.6 Forn ≥0,let Pn bethesetofallpolynomialfunctions,thatisfunctions
of the form p(t) = antn + · · · + a1t + a0, with real coefﬁcients and degree at most
n. With the ordinary operations
(p + q)(t) = p(t) + q(t),
(αp)(t) = α · p(t)
taken as addition and scalar multiplication, it is immediate to verify that Pn is a
linear space over R. Removing the restriction on the degrees of the polynomials one
obtains the set P of all polynomial functions with real coefﬁcients which, again with
the obvious notions of addition and scalar multiplication, forms a linear space over
R. Considering complex coefﬁcients yields similar linear spaces over C.
Example 2.7 Let I be a subset of R that is either an open interval (a, b), a closed
interval [a, b], or the entire real line R. Consider the set C(I, R) of all continuous
real-valued functions x : I →R. The familiar deﬁnitions
(x + y)(t) = x(t) + y(t),
(αx)(t) = α · x(t),
when applied to continuous functions x, y : I →R, are well known to produce
continuous functions again, and it is easy to see that when these operations are taken
as addition and scalar multiplication the set C(I, R) is a linear space over R. One may
also consider the set C(I, C) of all continuous complex-valued functions x : I →C

2.1 Linear Spaces—Elementary Properties and Examples
41
to similarly obtain a linear space over C. One may also consider, for each k ≥1, the
set Ck(I, R) of all functions x : I →R with a continuous k-th derivative, which is
similarly a linear space over R. It is then customary to equate C0(I, R) with C(I, R).
We may also allow k = ∞so as to obtain C∞(I, R), the linear space of all inﬁnitely
differentiable functions.
Example 2.8 Let K be any ﬁeld and F a proper subﬁeld of K, namely F is a proper
subset of K, and with the induced operations from K it is itself a ﬁeld. For instance,
Q is a subﬁeld of R which in turn is a subﬁeld of C. In such a situation any linear
space V over the larger ﬁeld K is also a different linear space over the smaller ﬁeld F.
The reason is that, of course, the additive structure of V is unaffected by the choice
of ﬁeld of scalars, whereas the scalar product axioms, if they hold for scalars ranging
over K, certainly continue to hold for scalars ranging over the smaller ﬁeld F (since
these axioms are universal equational quantiﬁcations). The process of considering a
linear space over K as a linear space over F is named restriction of scalars.
In particular, each of the examples above of a linear space over C is also a linear
space over R, and also a linear space over Q. Any linear space obtained by restriction
of scalars F ⊂K is (except for trivial cases) very different than the original space.
Another particular instance of restriction of scalars is the observation that since R is
a linear space over itself (if this is confusing pause for a minute to think about the
linear space Rn and take n = 1), restriction of scalars implies that R is also a linear
space over Q.

turns it into a linear space over K (known as the free linear space generated by B).
2.2
The Dimension of a Linear Space
The familiar linear spaces Rn are all inﬁnite sets (in fact, they all have the same
cardinality, the cardinality c of the continuum). However, it is intuitively clear that

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
43
R3 is larger than, say, R2. This fact is usually expressed by the claim that R3 has
dimension 3 while R2 has dimension 2. The notion of dimension in general linear
spaces is rather subtle, especially for the inﬁnite dimensional ones. We investigate
this notion in full generality, starting with the related concepts of linear independence
and spanning sets.
2.2.1
Linear Independence, Spanning Sets, and Bases
By forming linear combinations of vectors from any given set of vectors in a linear
space V ,oneobtainsa(potentially)largecollectionofvectors.Intuitively,theoriginal
set is spanning if this process yields every vector in the linear space V while it is
linearly independent if no duplicate vectors are produced. Precise deﬁnitions follow.
Deﬁnition 2.2 Given any set S ⊆V of vectors in a linear space V (S may be ﬁnite
or inﬁnite), a linear combination of elements of S is any vector of the form
x =
m

k=1
αkxk
with x1, . . . , xm vectors from S and α1, . . . , αm ∈K arbitrary scalars. Equivalently,
x =

s∈S
αs · s
with αs = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many s ∈S. The two forms are essentially the same,
differing only notationally. The span of S is then the set of all linear combinations
of elements from S, and S is said to be a spanning set if its span is the entire linear
space V . A spanning set S is a minimal spanning set if it is itself a spanning set
but no proper subset of it is a spanning set. Further, S is said to be a set of linearly
independent vectors if the only possibility of expressing the zero vector as a linear
combination of elements from S is the trivial linear combination, i.e., where all the
coefﬁcients are 0. That is, S is linearly independent if whenever one has
0 =
m

k=1
αkxk,
with x1, . . . , xm vectors in S, then necessarily αk = 0 for all 1 ≤k ≤m. The set S
is said to be a maximal linearly independent set if it is itself linearly independent but
any set that properly contains it is not linearly independent. A set that is not linearly
independent is also referred to as a linearly dependent set. Finally, a set that is both
a spanning set and linearly independent is called a basis of the linear space.

Linear Spaces
Remark 2.5 We speak of vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈V as being either spanning or lin-
early independent, if the set {x1, . . . , xm} is spanning or linearly independent. Of
course, we may also consider countably inﬁnitely many vectors x1, x2, . . . as being
spanning or linearly independent, in a similar fashion.
Example 2.9 The situation in Rn is probably very familiar to the reader. Any m
vectors x1, . . . , xm in Rn are linearly independent if, and only if, the equation
m

k=1
αkxk = 0
admits the unique solution α1 = α2 = · · · = αm = 0. It is well known that linear
independence implies m ≤n. Similarly, the given vectors are spanning if, and only
if, for every vector b ∈Rn the equation
m

k=1
αkxk = b
admits a solution. It is again a familiar fact that if the given vectors are spanning,
then m ≥n. It thus follows that a basis for Rn must consist of precisely n vectors. In
particular, all bases have the same size, n, which is referred to as the dimension of Rn.
Below we prove that every linear space has a dimension, provided we allow inﬁnite
cardinalities into the picture. The result in that generality subsumes the properties of
Rn just mentioned.
Example 2.10 In the space C2, considered as a linear space over C, the vectors
(1, 0) and (0, 1) are immediately seen to form a basis. However, if C2 is considered
as a linear space over R (by the procedure of restriction of scalars from Example 2.8),
then these two vectors are (of course) still linearly independent but they fail to span
C2. Indeed, since only real scalars may now be used to form linear combinations of
these vectors, the span will only be R2. To obtain a basis, the two vectors need to be
augmented, for instance, by the vectors (i, 0) and (0, i). The four vectors together
do form a basis of C2.
Example 2.11 In the linear space Rn or Cn, the vectors e1, . . . , en where
ek = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0)
with 1 in the k-th position, are easily seen to be spanning and linearly independent,
and thus form a basis, called the standard basis of Rn, respectively Cn. It is obvious
that Rn and Cn have inﬁnitely many bases.
In the examples presented so far it was quite straightforward to obtain a basis. The
following example shows that this is not always the case. In fact, it is not even clear
that the next linear space even has a basis.

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
45
Example 2.12 Let C∞be the linear space from Example 2.3. The vectors e1, e2, . . .,
given by
ek = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . .)
with 1 in the k-th position are easily seen to be linearly independent, but they do not
form a spanning set. Indeed, since the span consists only of ﬁnite linear combinations
of vectors from the set, the span in this case is the set of all vectors of the form
(a1, . . . , ak, 0, . . . , 0, 0, . . .), namely those inﬁnite sequences of complex numbers
that are eventually 0. In other words, the span in C∞of the vectors e1, e2, . . . is the
space c00 from Example 2.4, and thus we incidentally found a basis for c00. It is now
tempting to proceed as follows. Taking any vector y1 ∈R∞not spanned by e1, e2, . . .,
for instance the vector y1 = (1, 1, 1, . . . , 1, . . .), forming the set {y1, e1, e2, . . .} must
get us closer to obtaining a basis. Indeed, the new set is still linearly independent
precisely because y1 was not spanned by the rest of the vectors. But, this new set
is still not a basis as there are still many vectors it fails to span, for instance the
vector y2 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, . . .). Of course, we may now consider the larger set
{y1, y2, e1, e2, . . .}, but it too fails to be a basis. One may attempt to resolve the
argument once and for all by claiming that proceeding in this way to inﬁnity will
eventually result in a basis. However, this is a very vague statement, and even if this
process can be carried out mathematically (which it can, as will be shown below), it
is entirely unclear as to which vectors will end up in the basis and which will not. In
other words, even if this linear space has a basis, it is unlikely we can ever present
one.
Naturally, similar observations hold true for R∞instead of C∞, and in fact to
most of the linear spaces in this book, and in analysis in general.
Example 2.13 Recall (see Example 2.8) that one can consider the space R as a
linear space over the ﬁeld Q of rational numbers (as a particular case of restriction
of scalars). A real number α is said to be transcendental if it is not the root of a
polynomial with rational coefﬁcients. Examples of transcendental numbers include
e and π, though the proofs are far from trivial. For any transcendental number x
the set {1, x, x2, x3, . . .} is linearly independent (this is basically the deﬁnition of x
being transcendental), but it is not a spanning set.
Example 2.14 Recall the space Pn from Example 2.6 of all polynomial functions
with real coefﬁcients of degree at most n. For every k ≥0 let pk be the vector
pk(t) = tk. Clearly, the vectors p0, p1, p2, . . . , pn form a basis for Pn, but again
there are inﬁnitely many other choices of bases. The space P of all polynomial
functions with real coefﬁcients has a countable basis given by p0, p1, p2, . . ., a fact
that is easily veriﬁed. Noticing that polynomials are continuous functions, no matter
on which interval they are deﬁned, we see by the above that in the linear space C(I, R)
of all continuous functions x : I →R, where I is a non-degenerate interval (i.e., not
reducing to a point) the vectors p0, p1, p2, . . . are linearly independent. However,
they do not form a basis since any linear combination of these vectors is again
a polynomial function, but not all continuous functions are polynomial functions.

Linear Spaces
Once more, it is not at all clear that C(I, R) even has a basis (what would one look
like?).
From the discussion above we see that in some linear spaces, such as Rn, Pn, or P,
it is quite easy to ﬁnd bases while in other linear spaces, such as R∞, R over Q, or
C(I, R), it is a highly non-trivial task. In more detail, we saw that it is rather simple
to exhibit a large set of linearly independent vectors, but it is not so easy to have
these vectors also span the entire space (the spaces c00 and P, as discussed above,
are the exception to the rule). In fact, it is not at all clear that one can ﬁnd bases for
V in the case of R∞or C∞, as well as for R as a linear space over Q, or for C(I, R).
2.2.2
Existence of Bases
The existence of a basis for an arbitrary vector space, over an arbitrary ﬁeld, relies
essentially on Zorn’s Lemma. Consequently, the existence proof is not constructive
and in many cases an explicit basis cannot be exhibited.
Proposition 2.2 Let S ⊆V be a set of vectors in a linear space V . The following
conditions are equivalent.
1. S is a maximal linearly independent set.
2. S is a minimal spanning set.
3. S is a basis.
Proof First we show that if S is a maximal linearly independent set, then it is a
basis. All that is needed is to show that S is a spanning set. To that end, let x ∈V
be a vector in the ambient linear space. If x ∈S then it is certainly spanned by S. If
x /∈S then by virtue of S being a maximal linearly independent set, the set S ∪{x}
is linearly dependent. Thus, there exist vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈S ∪{x} and non-zero
scalars α1, . . . , αm ∈K with
0 =
m

k=1
αkxk.
However, in the expression above it must be that x itself appears as a summand since
otherwise we would have expressed 0 as a non-trivial linear combination of vectors
from the linearly independent set S. We may thus isolate x in the expression above to
obtain it as a linear combination of elements from S. As x was arbitrary, we conclude
that S is a spanning set.
Next we show that if S is a minimal spanning set, then it is a basis. All that
is needed is to show that S is linearly independent, and indeed, if it were linearly
dependent, then we would have some expression as above, giving 0 as a non-trivial
linear combination of vectors from S. Using that expression we are able to isolate
some vector x ∈S and exhibit it as a linear combination of other vectors from S.
It is then easy to see that S \ {x} is still a spanning set (simply since any linear

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
47
combination containing x can be replaced by one that does not). But this contradicts
S being a minimal spanning set, and thus S must be linearly independent.
So far we have shown that each of conditions 1 and 2 implies condition 3. The
proof will be completed by showing the converse of these implications. The details
are very similar in spirit to those given so far, and thus the rest of the proof is left for
the reader.
□
We are now ready to establish that every linear space has a basis. The proof makes
essential use of Zorn’s Lemma and the reader may safely choose to skip the proof on
a ﬁrst reading. To the reader interested in the technique of Zorn’s Lemma we remark
that the proof below is actually a straightforward application with little technical
difﬁculties, and is thus a fortunate ﬁrst encounter with this proof technique.
Theorem 2.1 Every linearly independent set A ⊆V in a linear space V can be
extended to a maximal linearly independent set. In particular, by considering the
linearly independent set ∅⊆V and by Proposition 2.2, it follows that every linear
space V has a basis.
Proof Consider the set P of all linearly independent subsets S of V that contain A,
and order P by set inclusion. Evidently P is a poset, and to ﬁnd a maximal linearly
independent set that extends A amounts to ﬁnding a maximal element in P, and so
we apply Zorn’s Lemma (Sect. 1.2.17 of the Preliminaries). First we note that P is
certainly not empty since clearly A ∈P. Now, assume that {Si}i∈I is a chain in P.
We will show that S = 
i∈I Si is an upper bound for the chain. Clearly Si ⊆S for
all i ∈I, thus the only thing to show is that S ∈P, namely that S contains A (which
is immediate) and that it is linearly independent. For that, assume that
0 =
m

k=1
αkxk
is a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈S. Since S is the union
of the Si, it follows that xm ∈S f (m) for a suitable f (m) ∈I, but since {Si}i∈I is a
chain it follows that there is a single index i0 ∈I such that x1, . . . , xm ∈Si0. But then
the equality above expresses the zero vector as a non-trivial linear combination of
vectors from Si0, contradicting the fact that Si0 is linearly independent. With that the
conditions of Zorn’s Lemma are satisﬁed, and so the existence of a maximal element
in P is guaranteed. This maximal element is a set SM ∈P, namely SM contains A
and SM is a maximal set of linearly independent vectors, as required.
□
2.2.3
Existence of Dimension
Now that we know that every linear space has at least one basis, it is tempting to deﬁne
the dimension of a linear space to be the cardinality of its basis. However, for this

48
2
Linear Spaces
to make sense we need to know that all bases have the same cardinality. While this
is a very plausible assertion (certainly for such familiar spaces as Rn), it requires a
careful proof, particularly in the inﬁnite-dimensional case. The important ingredient
is the following lemma, stating that the cardinality of any linearly independent set
is not greater than the cardinality of any spanning set. This result again uses Zorn’s
Lemma and its proof may safely be skipped on a ﬁrst reading. A word of caution
to the ambitious reader that this proof, compared to the proof of Theorem 2.1, is
technically more demanding.
Lemma 2.1 If V is a linear space, I ⊆V a linearly independent set of vectors, and
S ⊆V a spanning set, then there exists an injective function f : I →S.
Proof Consider a pair (J, f ) where J ⊆I and f : J →S is an injection. The idea
will be (using Zorn’s Lemma) to keep on extending the domain of f until the entire
set I is exhausted. Conceptually, we think of the injective function f : J →S as
an instruction to replace the vectors in J by their images in S, so we only consider
such pairs (J, f ) for which (I \ J) ∪f (J) is still a linearly independent set. Let
us now form the set P of all such pairs and introduce an ordering on it declaring
that (J1, f1) ≤(J2, f2) precisely when J1 ⊆J2 and f2 extends f1 (the latter means
that f1(x) = f2(x) holds for all x ∈J1). It is immediate that P is a poset, and that
a maximal element in it will furnish us with an injective function f : JM →S for a
very large subset JM ⊆I. We will then show that necessarily JM = I, and the result
will be established.
To verify the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma, notice ﬁrst that P is not empty. Indeed,
the pair (∅, ∅→S) is in P. Next, let {(Jt, ft)}t∈T be a chain in P, for which we
must now ﬁnd an upper bound. Let
J =

t∈T
Jt
and notice that we may deﬁne f : J →S as follows. Given x ∈J there is some
t ∈T such that x ∈Jt, and so let f (x) = ft(x). To see that this is a well-deﬁned
function, i.e., that it is independent of the choice of t ∈T , note that if x ∈Jt′ then
either Jt ⊆Jt′ or Jt′ ⊆Jt and then either ft′ extends ft or ft extends ft′, and in either
case ft(x) = ft′(x). It is clear that Jt ⊆J and that f extends ft, for all t ∈T , so all
we need to do in order to show that (J, f ) is an upper bound for the chain is establish
that (J, f ) ∈P. Clearly, J ⊆I, and f : J →S is injective (since we saw that in
fact for any two x1, x2 ∈J the function f agrees with some ft, which is injective, so
f (x1) = f (x2) =⇒ft(x1) = ft(x2) =⇒x1 = x2). So it remains to observe that
(I \ J) ∪f (J) is a linearly independent set of vectors. Indeed, if 0 can be obtained
as a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈(I \ J) ∪f (J), then,
using the chain condition again, it follows that there exists an element t ∈T such
that x1, . . . , xm ∈(I \ Jt) ∪ft(Jt), which is a linearly independent set, yielding a
contradiction.
With the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma now veriﬁed, it follows that there exists a
maximal element (JM, fM), with JM ⊆I and fM : JM →S an injection. If JM = I,

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
49
then we are done, since fM : I →S is the required injection. Assuming this is not
the case, let x! ∈I \ JM. If we can ﬁnd a vector y! ∈S \ fM(JM) such that
(I \ (JM ∪{x!})) ∪( fM(JM) ∪{y!})
is linearly independent, then we will have that (JM ∪{x!}, f!) ∈P, where f! is the
extension of fM given by f!(x!) = y!. But that would contradict the maximality of
(JM, fM), and we will have our contradiction. So, we proceed to prove the existence
of such a vector y!. If no such y! exists, then that means that the set
(I \ (JM ∪{x!})) ∪( fM(JM) ∪{y})
is a linearly dependent set for every y ∈S \ fM(JM). Now, since S is a spanning set
we may write
x! =

s∈S
αs · s =

s∈fM(JM)
αs · s +

s∈S\ fM(JM)
αs · s = x1 + x2
where the sum is a ﬁnite sum, so that αs = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many s, and we
simply split the sum according to whether or not s ∈fM(JM). By our assumption,
the set
(I \ (JM ∪{x!})) ∪fM(JM)
is linearly dependent if any of the vectors s ∈S \ fM(JM) is added to it. Thus, this
set is linearly dependent if any linear combination of such vectors, such as x2, is
added to it. Further, since x1 is in the span of fM(JM) it follows that the set above is
linearly dependent if x = x1 + x2 is added to it. But the latter is the set
(I \ (JM ∪{x!})) ∪fM(JM) ∪{x!} = (I \ JM) ∪fM(JM)
which is linearly independent. The proof is now complete.
□
We are now in position to establish the following important result.
Theorem 2.2 Let V be a linear space. If B1 and B2 are any two bases for V , then
they have the same cardinality.
Proof By deﬁnition of basis, B1 is linearly independent and B2 is a spanning set. By
Lemma 2.1, there is an injective function f : B1 →B2. By the same argument there
is also an injective function g : B2 →B1. It now follows from the Cantor-Schröder-
Bernstein Theorem (Theorem 1.1 in the Preliminaries) that the cardinalities of B1
and B2 are equal.
□
Deﬁnition 2.3 The dimension of a linear space V , denoted by dim(V ), is equal to
the cardinality of a basis for it. By Theorem 2.1 at least one basis exists, and by
Theorem 2.2 all bases have the same cardinality. Thus, the notion of dimension is

50
2
Linear Spaces
well deﬁned. The linear space V is said to be ﬁnite dimensional if its dimension is
ﬁnite, and inﬁnite dimensional otherwise. A basis for an inﬁnite-dimensional linear
space is called a Hamel basis.
Example 2.15 Finite-dimensionallinearspaces,byExamples2.11and2.14,include
the spaces Rn and Cn, having dimension n, and the space Pn of polynomials
(see Example 2.6), which is of dimension n + 1. Inﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces
include, due to Examples 2.12 and 2.14, the space c00 of sequences that are eventu-
ally 0, the space P of all polynomials with real coefﬁcients, and the space C(I, R)
of continuous functions x : I →R, as long as I does not reduce to a point.
We have already encountered linear spaces of very large dimension. To argue about
the dimension of such spaces the following result, interesting on its own, is use-
ful. Recall from Example 2.5 the linear space (K B)0 of all functions x : B →K
satisfying x(b) = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many b ∈B.
Proposition 2.3 Let V be a linear space and B a basis for it. Then every vector
x ∈V can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of elements from B. In
other words, there is a bijective correspondence between the vectors x ∈V and the
elements of (K B)0.
Proof Since a typical element in (K B)0 is nothing but a function x : B →K for
which x(b) = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many b ∈B, we may associate with each such x the
vector 
b∈B x(b) · b (as the summation is ﬁnite). We claim that this correspondence
is the desired bijection. Indeed, it is a tautology that the surjectivity of this process is
the claim that B is a spanning set. It is almost a tautology that the injectivity of the
process is the claim that B is linearly independent.
□
We thus see that a basis B endows a linear space with a notion of coordinates. This
is certainly a useful thing to have, but for practical reasons its usefulness hangs on
the ability to explicitly describe the basis B. In ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces it is
very common to work with bases but, as we remarked earlier, in inﬁnite-dimensional
linear spaces being able to explicitly describe a Hamel basis is the exception rather
than the rule. Consequently, Hamel bases are used primarily for theoretical rather
then practical purposes.
Example 2.16 From Example 2.8 the ﬁeld R may be viewed as a linear space over
Q so let B be a Hamel basis for R over Q. By Proposition 2.3, there is then a bijection
between R and the set (QB)0 of all functions B →Q that attain 0 at all but ﬁnitely
many arguments. In other words, |R| = |(QB)0| (see Sect. 1.2.11 of the Preliminaries
for the basics of cardinalities). If B is countable, then it is easy to write (QB)0 as a
countable union of countable sets (Sect. 1.2.13) and thus the set (QB)0 itself would
be countable. But that would imply that R is a countable set while the reals are well
known to be uncountable. We conclude that R, as a linear space over Q, is inﬁnite
dimensional of uncountable dimension.
We close this section by illustrating one of many differences between ﬁnite-
dimensional linear spaces and inﬁnite-dimensional ones.

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
51
Proposition 2.4 The cardinality of any linearly independent set A in a linear space
V is a lower bound for the dimension of V . Moreover, if V is ﬁnite dimensional, then
any linearly independent set A ⊆V whose cardinality is equal to the dimension of
V is a basis.
Proof The dimension of V is the cardinality of any basis B, and, as B is in particular
a spanning set, it follows from Lemma 2.1 that there is an injection A →B, and
so the cardinalities satisfy |A| ≤|B| (refer to Sect. 1.2.11 of the Preliminaries, if
needed). The claim now follows since the latter is the dimension of V .
Now, if V is ﬁnite dimensional, say of dimension n, and A = {x1, . . . , xn} is a set
of n linearly independent vectors, then to show A is a basis we just need to prove that
it is a spanning set. But if it were not, and y ∈V is any vector not in its span, then
the set {x1, . . . , xn, y} is linearly independent and contains n + 1 vectors. But then,
by the ﬁrst part of the proposition, it would follow that n + 1 ≤n, an absurdity. □
Remark 2.6 The ﬁnite dimensionality assumption is crucial. For instance, in the
linear space c00 of sequences that are eventually 0 (Example 2.4), consider the vectors
{ek}k≥1 where ek = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . .), with 1 in the k-th position. These vectors
are easily seen to be linearly independent and spanning, thus they form a basis
of countably many vectors. The dimension of c00 is thus inﬁnitely countable. The
set {e2, e3, . . .} is clearly also linearly independent, has the same cardinality as the
dimension of c00, but it is not spanning, and thus not a basis.

2.3
Linear Operators
The deﬁnition and properties of the structure preserving functions between linear
spaces form the topic of this section. The content is discussed and exempliﬁed in the
context of the linear spaces introduced above.
Deﬁnition 2.4 Let V and W be linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K. A function
T : V →W is additive if
T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y)
for all vectors x, y ∈V , and it is homogenous if
T (αx) = αT (x)
for all vectors x ∈V and all scalars α ∈K. If T is both additive and homogeneous,
then it is called a linear operator, a condition equivalent to the equality
T (α1x1 + α2x2) = α1T (x1) + α2T (x2)
for all x1, x2 ∈V and α1, α2 ∈K.
Remark 2.7 Synonymous terms for linear operator are linear transformation and
linear homomorphism. Throughout the book we will adopt the convention that any
reference to a linear operator T : V →W immediately implies, implicitly at times,
that V and W are linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K.

equivalently be taken as the deﬁnition of linear operator. The next result shows that
the linearity requirement of a linear operator forces any linear operator to also respect
the zero vector, additive inverses, and subtraction.
Proposition 2.5 For a linear operator T : V →W:
1. T (0) = 0.
2. T (−x) = −T (x) for all x ∈V .
3. T (x −y) = T (x) −T (y) for all x, y ∈V .
Proof 1. Notice that T (0) + T (0) = T (0 + 0) = T (0) and use cancelation.
2. T (x) + T (−x) = T (x + (−x)) = T (0) = 0.
3. T (x −y) = T (x + (−y)) = T (x) + T (−y) = T (x) −T (y).

2.3.1
Examples of Linear Operators
Trivial, but important, examples of linear operators are the following. For any linear
space V , the identity function id : V →V is always a linear operator. On the other
extreme, given linear spaces V and W over the same ﬁeld, the function T0 : V →W
given by T0(x) = 0 is also immediately seen to be a linear operator.
In the presence of a basis for the domain V , linear operators T : V →W are
easily characterized by the following result, readily yielding an endless supply of
examples.
Lemma 2.2 Let V and W be linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K and B a basis for V .
Then any function F : B →W extends uniquely to a linear operator TF : V →W.
Proof For a given function F : B →W, suppose that TF : V →W is a linear oper-
ator extending F. Then, given any vector x ∈V , write
x =

b∈B
αb · b
as a (ﬁnite) linear combination of basis elements, and then it follows that
TF(x) = TF

b∈B
αb · b
	
=

b∈B
αb · TF(b) =

b∈B
αb · F(b).

2.3 Linear Operators
55
Noticing that the computation above expresses TF(x) in terms of vectors of the form
F(b) we conclude that an extension TF, if it exists, is unique. If we now take the
equality above as a deﬁnition, then we obtain a function TF : V →W (relying on
the uniqueness of the linear combination expressing x in order to assure that TF is
well deﬁned). Verifying that this TF is indeed a linear operator and that it extends F
is immediate.
□
Remark 2.8 This linear operator TF : V →W obtained from the function F : B →
W is said to be obtained by linearly extending F to all of V .
Often enough the technique of the last result is inadequate, either because a basis
is not readily available or because a more direct formula for the linear operator is
obtainable. The following examples illustrate these possibilities.
Example 2.17 The derivation operation d/dt, taking a function f to its derivative
d f/dt, satisﬁes the properties
d
dt ( f + g) = d
dt ( f ) + d
dt (g)
and
d
dt (αf ) = α d
dt ( f ),
namely, it is additive and homogenous, and thus, if we choose the domain and
codomain correctly, we expect it to be a linear operator. To turn this observation
into a precise statement, recall the linear spaces Ck([a, b], R) from Example 2.7
of all functions x : [a, b] →R with a continuous k-th derivative. Then, for every
k ≥1, the observation above can be stated by saying that d/dt : Ck([a, b], R) →
Ck−1([a, b], R)isalinearoperator.Similarly,d/dt : C∞([a, b], R)→C∞([a, b], R)
is a linear operator on the linear space of inﬁnitely differentiable functions.
Example 2.18 The integral operator
 b
a dt f (t) is also well known to be additive and
homogenous, and, since every continuous function on a closed interval is integrable,
we obtain that for every interval I = [a, b] the function
f →

 b
a
dt f (t)
is a linear operator from the linear space C(I, R) of Example 2.7 to R as a linear
space over itself.
Example 2.19 Spaces of inﬁnite sequences, such as R∞from Example 2.3 or the
space c0 from Example 2.4 admit the following operators (we use R∞just to ﬁx one
possibility). The shift operator S : R∞→R∞, given, for x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk . . .),
by S(x) = (x2, x3, . . . , xk, . . .), is easily seen to be a linear operator. It is equally easy
to see that the function T : R∞→R∞, given for x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk . . .) as above

56
2
Linear Spaces
by T (x) = (0, x1, x2, . . . , xk, . . .) is a linear operator. Note that S ◦T is the identity
while T ◦S is not, a phenomenon that is known to be impossible in ﬁnite-dimensional
linear spaces. These operators are the creation and annihilation operators a† and a,
widely used in Quantum Mechanics.
We see thus that even when a basis can be given explicitly (and certainly when it
cannot) it may be much simpler to deﬁne a linear operator directly rather than by
linear extension on a basis.
2.3.2
Algebra of Operators
With suitable domain and codomain, linear operators can be composed or added. We
investigate the algebraic laws governing these operations.
Proposition 2.6 The composition S ◦T : U →W of any two linear operators
U
T
V
S
W
(where in particular all linear spaces are over the same
ﬁeld) is a linear operator.
Proof The additivity of S ◦T follows from the deﬁnition of composition and the
computation
S(T (x + y)) = S(T (x) + T (y)) = S(T (x)) + S(T (y)),
valid for all vectors x, y ∈U, utilizing the additivity of T and S. The homogeneity
of the composition follows similarly as the reader can verify.
□
Next, any two functions T, S : V →W between linear spaces over the ﬁeld K can
be added together to form the function T + S : V →W given by
(T + S)(x) = T (x) + S(x)
for all x ∈V . Further, given a scalar α ∈K, the function αT : V →W is given by
(αT )(x) = α(T (x)).
Proposition 2.7 For all linear operators T, S : V →W and scalars α ∈K, both
T + S and αT are linear operators.
Proof For all vectors x, y ∈V and scalars β, γ ∈K:
(T + S)(βx + γ y) = T (βx + γ y) + S(βx + γ y)
= T (βx) + T (γ y) + S(βx) + S(γ y)
= βT (x) + γ T (y) + βS(x) + γ S(y)
= β(T (x) + S(x)) + γ (T (y) + S(y))
= β(T + S)(x) + γ (T + S)(y).

2.3 Linear Operators
57
The proof for αT is similar and left for the reader.
□
The result above shows that the set of all linear operators T : V →W has naturally
deﬁned notions of addition and scalar multiplication. It is a pleasant fact that with
these operations one obtains a linear space.
Deﬁnition 2.5 Given linear spaces V and W over the same ﬁeld K we denote by
Hom(V, W) the set of all linear operators T : V →W.
Theorem 2.3 For linear spaces V and W over the same ﬁeld K the set Hom(V, W),
when endowed with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication as above,
is a linear space over K.
Proof The proof is a straightforward veriﬁcation of the linear space axioms, so we
only give the details for a few of the axioms. For instance, given linear operators
T1, T2 : V →W, to show that
T1 + T2 = T2 + T1
we note that
(T1 + T2)(x) = T1(x) + T2(x) = T2(x) + T1(x) = (T2 + T1)(x)
where the commutativity of vector addition in W was used.
To show the existence of an additively neutral element, recall that T0 : V →W
given by T0(x) = 0, is always a linear operator, and thus T0 ∈Hom(V, W). Seeing
that T0 is additively neutral is simply the computation
(T + T0)(x) = T (x) + T0(x) = T (x) + 0 = T (x).
We leave the veriﬁcation of the other axioms to the reader.
□
2.3.3
Isomorphism
The linear spaces Rn+1 and Pn, while consisting of very different elements, are, in
some sense, essentially identical. It is obvious that one may think of a sequence of
n + 1 real numbers as the coefﬁcients of a polynomial. Vice versa, one may identify
a polynomial function with its list of coefﬁcients and thus obtain n + 1 real numbers.
Thus, one may rename the elements in one space to obtain the elements of the other,
and, moreover, the linear structure under this renaming is respected. This situation
is made precise, and generalized, by the concept of isomorphism.
Deﬁnition 2.6 A linear operator T : V →W that, as a function, is a bijection is
called a linear isomorphism or (simply an isomorphism if the linear context is clear).
Stated differently, T is an isomorphism precisely when it is invertible. When T :

58
2
Linear Spaces
V →W is an isomorphism the spaces V and W are said to be isomorphic, denoted
by V ∼= W.
The following result establishes some expected behavior of isomorphisms.
Proposition 2.8 Suppose that U, V , and W are linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K
and consider the linear operators T : U →V and S : V →W. The following then
hold.
1. The identity function id : V →V is an isomorphism.
2. If T and S are isomorphisms, then so is S ◦T .
3. If T is an isomorphism, then so is the inverse function T −1.
Proof 1. We already noted that the identity function is always a linear operator. It
is clearly bijective and thus an isomorphism.
2. We have seen that the composition S ◦T of linear operators is a linear operator.
The composition of bijective functions is again bijective, and so if T and S are
isomorphisms, then so is S ◦T .
3. Since T : U →V is an isomorphism, the inverse function T −1 : V →U exists,
and is clearly a bijection. To conclude the proof it remains to be shown that T −1
is a linear operator. Indeed, T −1 is additive since
T −1(x + y) = T −1(T (T −1(x)) + T (T −1(y)))
= T −1(T (T −1(x) + T −1(y))
= T −1(x) + T −1(y)
for all vectors x, y ∈V . Further, T −1 is homogenous since
T −1(αx) = T −1(αT (T −1(x))) = T −1(T (αT −1(x))) = αT −1(x)
for all vectors x ∈V and scalars α ∈K.
□
Remark 2.9 Thethirdpropertydeservesfurtherattention.Alinearoperator T : U →
V is a function between the sets underlying the linear spaces that is required to con-
serve the linear structure on the sets. Inducing temporary amnesia and forgetting
the linear structure altogether focuses just on the functional aspect. The property
then says that if T , merely as a function, is invertible, then, upon recovering from the
amnesic episode, the fact that T conserves the algebraic structure forces T −1 to do the
same. Analogous such conservation forcing may very well fail in other situations. For
instance, the function f : [0, 2π) →C given by f (θ) = eiθ is a continuous bijection
onto the unit circle C, but its inverse is not continuous. So, continuity of f does not
force the continuity of f −1, unless some further topological restrictions are placed
on the spaces involved.
Corollary 2.1 For all linear spaces U, V , and W over the same ﬁeld K:

2.3 Linear Operators
59
1. V ∼= V .
2. If U ∼= V , then V ∼= U.
3. If U ∼= V and V ∼= W, then U ∼= W.
Isomorphic linear spaces are essentially identical, except (possibly) for the names
of the elements in them and they thus possess exactly the same linear properties.
This is a somewhat vague statement but it is almost always immediate how to turn
it into a precise statement. For instance, the dimension of a linear space is a linear
property and thus any two isomorphic linear spaces have the same dimension, as we
now show.
Proposition 2.9 If V ∼= W, then the linear spaces have the same dimension.
Proof By assumption there exists a linear isomorphism T : V →W. The dimension
of a linear space is the cardinality of any of its bases, and thus the result will be
established by exhibiting a bijection between a basis of V and a basis of W. Let
B ⊆V be a basis and consider its image T (B) ⊆W. Clearly, T |B, the restriction of
T to B, is a bijection between B and f (B), so all that remains to be done is show that
f (B) is a basis for W, namely that f (B) is a spanning set of linearly independent
vectors. Let y ∈W be an arbitrary vector. Since T is onto, we may write y = T (x)
for some x ∈V . As B is a basis, we express x as a (ﬁnite!) linear combination of
basis elements:
x =

b∈B
αb · b.
But then
y = T (x) =

b∈B
αb · T (b)
and thus y is in the span of T (B). As y was arbitrary we conclude that T (B) spans
all of W. The proof that T (B) is also linearly independent follows a similar pattern
and is left for the reader.
□
The converse to this result is also true, as the following result implies.
Theorem 2.4 If V is a linear space and B is a basis for it, then V ∼= (K B)0.
Proof In Proposition 2.3 we established that the function T : (K B)0 →V given by
T ( f ) =

b∈B
f (b) · b
is a bijection. We show now that it is in fact an isomorphism, thus completing the
proof. We need to verify that T (α1 f + α2g) = α1T ( f ) + α2T (g), which amounts
to showing that

b∈B
(α1 f + α2g)(b) · b = α1

b∈B
f (b) · b + α2

b∈B
g(b) · b,

Linear Spaces
which follows by an immediate computation.
□
Remark 2.10 Every linear space V over K is thus isomorphic to a linear space of
the form (K B)0. The latter space is clearly only dependent on the cardinality of the set
B, i.e., if X is any set with the same cardinality as B, then (K B)0 ∼= (K X)0. In other
words, the dimension of a linear space determines it up to isomorphism. It should
be noted however that generally there is no canonical choice for an isomorphism
between V and (K X)0.
In the ﬁnite-dimensional case we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 2.2 Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional linear space over the ﬁeld K. Any
choice of a basis x1, . . . , xn for V gives rise to an isomorphism V →K n. In this
way we may identify every vector in V , by means of coordinates, with an n-tuple of
scalars.
In a more general context, in particular in the inﬁnite-dimensional case, where bases
are rarely explicitly available, we have the following results.
Corollary 2.3 If V and W are linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K and they have
the same dimension, then they are isomorphic.
Proof By Remark 2.10, if we let X be a set of cardinality equal to the common
dimensions of V and W, then we obtain an isomorphisms T1 : (K X)0 →V and
an isomorphism T2 : (K X)0 →W. It follows that T2 ◦T −1
1
: V →W is an isomor-
phism, showing that V ∼= W, as claimed.
□
Combining Proposition 2.9 and Corollary 2.3, the discussion above is summarized
as follows.
Theorem 2.5 Two linear spaces over the same ﬁeld are isomorphic if, and only if,
they have the same dimension.
Remark 2.11 This result is an example of what is known as a rigidity phenomenon.
Rigidity refers to a situation where two structures are essentially the same given
that they have essentially the same substructure of some kind, typically of a much
coarser nature than the original structures. In this case, the rigidity of linear spaces
over a ﬁxed ﬁeld K is that the dimension sufﬁces to determine the linear space up to
isomorphism.
Example 2.20 Recallthelinearspace Pn ofpolynomialfunctionsfromExample2.6.
We can show that Pn ∼= Rn+1 by constructing an isomorphism between the two
spaces. Indeed, referring here to a typical element in Rn+1 by (a0, . . . , an), let
T : Rn+1 →Pn
be given by
T (a0, . . . , an) = antn + . . . + a1t + a0.

2.3 Linear Operators
61
It is a trivial matter to verify that T is a linear operator, clearly bijective, and thus an
isomorphism. Similarly, the reader is invited to show that c00 ∼= P. By the discussion
above, the existence of an isomorphism (but not any explicit isomorphism) could
have been deduced by noting that both Rn+1 and Pn, as linear spaces over R, have
dimension n + 1. Similarly, both c00 and P have countably inﬁnite dimension and
are thus isomorphic.
Remark 2.12 Theorem 2.5 tells us that the dimension of a linear space essentially
is all that one needs to know about a linear space in order to study it (since after
all, isomorphic linear spaces are essentially the same). It is thus tempting to, once
and for all, choose a single representative from each isomorphism class of linear
spaces. This certainly sufﬁces for the study of all linear spaces, and seems more
economical than having all of this redundancy in the form of multiple isomorphic
specimens of linear spaces. However, the example above clearly shows the danger
in this approach. While Rn+1 and Pn are isomorphic, they have different qualities
(at least to us humans). For instance, it is very natural to consider the integral as
an operator on polynomials, but not so much on elements in Rn+1. The richness of
a plethora of different linear spaces, even if they are isomorphic, is a blessing that
should not be given up for the illusion of a more economical treatment.

2.4
Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
Subspaces arise naturally as portions of a given linear space that inherit a linear space
structure from the ambient linear space. We show that any linear operator gives rise
to two subspaces, its kernel and its image, and we show how to combine two linear
spaces to form their product space. We also show how to eliminate a subspace so as
to obtain a quotient space. The connection to complementary spaces is made explicit.

Linear Spaces
2.4.1
Subspaces
Given a subset A ⊆V of a linear space V the operations of addition and scalar
multiplication, when restricted to vectors in A always yield elements in the ambient
space V . We are interested in the case where the results of these operations always
yield elements in A.
Deﬁnition 2.7 A subset A ⊆V is said to be closed under addition if
x + y ∈A
for all vectors x, y ∈A. Similarly, A is said to be closed under scalar multiplication
if
αx ∈A
for all vectors x ∈A and scalars α ∈K. The set A is called a linear subspace (or
simply subspace if the linear context is evident) of V if A ̸= ∅and A is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication. A subspace A is called a proper subspace if it is
properly contained in the ambient space V .
Remark 2.13 If A is a linear subspace of V , then A, with vector addition and scalar
multiplication induced from V , is a linear space. Indeed, the veriﬁcation of each of
the axioms follows the same pattern. For instance,
x + y = y + x
holds for all x, y ∈A since the same equality holds for all vectors x and y in the
ambient space V . Moreover, notice that the zero vector 0 is always an element in
A and is the zero vector of A. Indeed, 0 = 0 · x holds for all x ∈A, and since A is
required to be non-empty, at least one x ∈A exists.
The subset {0} consisting of just the zero vector is always a subspace called the
trivial subspace of V . Another immediate example of a subspace of V is V itself,
i.e., a non-proper subspace. An immediate property of subspaces is their transitive
property, that is if A ⊆B ⊆V , then if B is a subspace of V and A is a subspace of
B, then A is a subspace of V .
Example 2.21 Consider the linear space R2 and its subset A consisting only of the
vectors of the form (x, 0) ∈R2. Clearly, A is non-empty, closed under addition, and
closed under scalar multiplication, and hence is a subspace of R2. More generally, a
linel = {tx | t ∈R}, with x ∈R2 a non-zero vector, is a linear subspace of R2. These
linear subspaces, together with the subspaces {0} and R2, exhaust all of the linear
subspaces of R2. Similarly, linear subspaces of Rn, for larger values of n, correspond
to the origin, lines through the origin, planes through the origin, and hyper-planes
through the origin. Notice the following subtle point. The ﬁeld R, when viewed as
a linear space over itself, is obviously isomorphic to R1, that is to Rn where n = 1.

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
65
However, even though the linear space R ∼= R1 may naturally be identiﬁed with
either the X-axis or the Y-axis in R2, formally speaking, R itself (or R1) is not a
subspace of R2. In fact, it is not even a subset of R2. More generally, Rn is a subspace
of Rm if, and only if, n = m, in which case the two spaces coincide. When n ≤m
the space Rn may be identiﬁed in inﬁnitely many ways with various subspaces of
Rm but no such identiﬁcation is canonical. An analogous discussion can be given for
linear spaces over C.
Example 2.22 Consider the linear space C∞from Example 2.3 and the linear spaces
c of convergent sequences, c0 of sequences that converge to 0, and c00 of sequences
that are eventually 0 (see Example 2.4). Clearly,
c00 ⊂c0 ⊂c ⊂C∞
and in fact c00 is a linear subspace of c0, which in turn is a linear subspace of c, which
is a linear subspace of C∞. The veriﬁcation is immediate.
Other subspaces of C∞include, for each n ≥1, the set of all vectors of the form
(x1, . . . , xn, 0, 0, . . .). This space is clearly isomorphic to Cn, as are inﬁnitely many
other subspaces of C∞, as the reader is asked to verify. In any event, Cn is not itself
a subspace of C∞.
Example 2.23 Consider the linear space Pn (Example 2.6) consisting of polynomial
functions with real coefﬁcients of degree not exceeding n, and P, the linear space
of all polynomials with real coefﬁcients. For all n ≤m, it holds that Pn ⊆Pm ⊂P,
and it follows easily that Pn is a subspace of Pm, which in turn is a subspace of P.
We thus obtain the tower of proper subspace inclusions
P0 ⊂P1 ⊂P2 ⊂· · · ⊂Pn ⊂· · · ⊂P.
Example 2.24 With reference to Example 2.7, the subset of C([a, b], R) consisting
of the continuous functions x : [a, b] →R which vanish at a and b, that is such that
x(a) = x(b) = 0, constitutes a linear subspace. On the contrary, the subset of those
continuous functions with x(a) = x(b) = 1 does not constitute a linear subspace (as
it fails to contain the zero vector).
The following family of linear subspaces of C∞is of signiﬁcant importance.
Example 2.25 (The ℓp Spaces) Consider the linear space C∞from Example 2.3
and recall that a sequence x = (x1, . . . , xk, . . .) ∈C∞is said to be bounded if there
exists some M ∈R such that
|xk| < M
for all k ≥1. Let ℓ∞⊆C∞be the set of all bounded sequences. Clearly, the zero
vector, namely the constantly zero sequence, is in ℓ∞, the sum of two bounded
sequences is again bounded, and thus in ℓ∞, and if x is bounded by M, then αx =
(αx1, . . . , αxk, . . .) is bounded by |α|M, and thus is in ℓ∞. Hence ℓ∞is a linear
subspace of C∞.

Linear Spaces
Now, let p ≥1 and consider the set ℓp of all sequences of complex numbers that
are absolutely p-power summable, that is, all sequences x ∈C∞such that
∞

k=1
|xk|p < ∞.
Clearly, the constantly zero sequence belongs to ℓp, and ℓp is evidently closed under
scalar multiplication. To show that ℓp is a subspace of C∞it remains to be shown
that ℓp is closed under addition, a task we leave to the reader.
We thus obtain a one-parameter family {ℓp}1≤p≤∞of linear subspaces of C∞. It
can be shown that if 1 ≤p < q ≤∞, then ℓp ⊂ℓq (consider a suitable variation of
the harmonic series), and so ℓp is a proper linear subspace of ℓq.
Example 2.26 Recall from Example 2.8 that R may be viewed as a linear space
over R, and that C can be viewed as a linear space over C or as a linear space over
R. The set inclusion R ⊆C is of course always valid, but R is a linear subspace of
C only when both are considered to be linear spaces over R (or over Q). A subspace
relation between two linear spaces can only hold if both linear spaces are over the
same ﬁeld, and so, for instance, Cn as a linear space over R is not a linear subspace
of Cn as a linear space over C.
We address the relationship between subspaces and dimension. In the ﬁnite case
there are no surprises. The inﬁnite case, as usual, is more subtle.
Theorem 2.6 For a linear space V of dimension n and a subspace U ⊆V of dimen-
sion m, the following hold.
1. m ≤n.
2. If V is ﬁnite dimensional and m = n, then U = V .
Proof 1. The proof is given in full generality, thus n and m may be inﬁnite cardinals.
Let BV be a basis for V and let BU be a basis for U. By assumption, the cardinality
of BV is n while the cardinality of BU is m. Now, by deﬁnition of basis, BU is a
linearly independent set of vectors in U, and hence is also linearly independent
in V , while BV is a spanning set in V . By Lemma 2.1 there exists an injection
BU →BV , and thus n ≤m.
2. Assume now that m = n and that V is ﬁnite dimensional, namely that n = m is
a natural number. We may thus ﬁnd a basis {x1, . . . , xn} of U. In particular these
vectors are linearly independent in U, and thus also in V . By Proposition 2.4, it
follows that the set {x1, . . . , xn} is a basis of V , so its span is V . But the span is
also U, and the claim follows.
□
Remark 2.14 Much as in Remark 2.6, the ﬁnite dimensionality assumption cannot
be avoided. Indeed, the linear space c00 from Example 2.4 is, as we saw, of countably
inﬁnite dimension but it does contain proper subspaces of the same dimension. For

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
67
instance, it is easy to verify that the set c000 of all sequences in c00 whose ﬁrst term
is 0, is a proper subspace of c00 even though it is isomorphic to c00, and thus has the
same dimension as the ambient space.
2.4.2
Kernels and Images
With any linear operator T : V →W we associate a subspace of the domain, called
the kernel of T , and a subspace of the codomain, called the image of T . The kernel
sufﬁces to detect injectivity of T .
Deﬁnition 2.8 Let T : V →W be a linear operator. The set
Ker(T ) = {x ∈V | T (x) = 0}
is called the kernel of T .
Theorem 2.7 The kernel of a linear operator T : V →W is a linear subspace of
V .
Proof In Proposition 2.5 we already noted that T (0) = 0 and thus 0 ∈Ker(T ). All
we need to do now is show that the kernel is closed under vector addition and scalar
products. Indeed, if x, y ∈Ker(T ), then
T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y) = 0 + 0 = 0
and thus x + y ∈Ker(T ). Similarly, for all α ∈K, if x ∈Ker(T ), then
T (αx) = αT (x) = α · 0 = 0
so αx ∈Ker(T ) and the proof is complete.
□
Theorem 2.8 A linear operator T : V →W is injective if, and only if, its kernel is
trivial, i.e., Ker(T ) = {0}.
Proof If T is injective, then since we already know that T (0) = 0, it follows that
T (x) = 0 implies x = 0, and thus Ker(T ) = {0}. Conversely, suppose that the kernel
of T is trivial and that
T (x) = T (y)
for some x, y ∈V . Then
T (x −y) = T (x) −T (y) = 0
and so

68
2
Linear Spaces
x −y ∈Ker(T ).
But then x −y = 0, and so x = y, showing that T is injective.
□
Another subspace naturally obtained from a linear operator is its image.
Deﬁnition 2.9 Let T : V →W be a linear operator. The set Im(T ) = {T (x) | x ∈
V }, namely the set-theoretic image of T , is called the image of T .
Proposition 2.10 The image of a linear operator T : V →W is a linear subspace
of W.
Proof Obviously, T (V ) is not empty. Further, if x, y ∈Im(T ), then x = T (x′) and
y = T (y′) for some vectors x′, y′ ∈V . It then follows that
x + y = T (x′) + T (y′) = T (x′ + y′) ∈Im(T ).
Similarly, αx ∈Im(T ) for all x ∈Im(T ) and all scalars α ∈K.
□
The following result, which the reader may recognize as the rank-nullity theorem,
has important consequences for ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces.
Lemma 2.3 The equality
dim(V ) = dim(Ker(T)) + dim(Im(T))
holds for all linear operators T : V →W between ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces.
Proof We present the general strategy, inviting the reader to ﬁll-in the details. Choose
a basis {x1, . . . , xk} for Ker(T ). Then augment this basis by (if needed) adding
vectors to it, so as to obtain a basis {x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , ym} of V and show that
{T (y1), . . . , T (ym)} is a basis for Im(T ).
□
Remark 2.15 The proof above can be adapted to obtain a similar result for inﬁnite
dimensional linear spaces, provided one handles cardinal arithmetic with care, of
course. However, such a result is not of great importance and we thus avoid its
details.
Corollary 2.4 For a linear operator T : V →W between ﬁnite-dimensional linear
spaces of equal dimension injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity coincide.
Proof We have seen that T is injective if, and only if, its kernel is trivial, namely
precisely when dim(Ker(T )) = 0. It follows then that T is injective if, and only if,
dim(V ) = dim(Im(T )). But since dim(V ) = dim(W), it follows by Theorem 2.6,
that dim(V ) = dim(Im(T )) holds if, and only if, Im(T ) = W, in other words, pre-
cisely when T is surjective. This completes the veriﬁcation of the non-trivial argu-
ments in the proof.

2.4.3
Products and Quotients
We present the product construction for two linear spaces V and W over the same
ﬁeld K. We endow the set V × W with an addition operation and a scalar product that
turn it into a linear space, as follows. Given (x1, x2), (y1, y2) ∈V × W and α ∈K
the addition operation is given by
(x1, x2) + (y1, y2) = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2)
and the scalar product operation is given by
α(x1, x2) = (αx1, αx2).
Theorem 2.9 For linear spaces V and W over the same ﬁeld K, the set V × W,
when endowed with addition and scalar multiplication as above, is a linear space
over the ﬁeld K.
Proof The veriﬁcation of the linear space axioms is straightforward. For instance,
the additively neutral element is (0, 0) since
(x1, x2) + (0, 0) = (x1 + 0, x2 + 0) = (x1, x2)
for all (x1, x2) ∈V × W. The rest of the veriﬁcation is for the reader.
□
Obviously, one can similarly deﬁne the product V1 × · · · × Vn of any ﬁnite number
of linear spaces, and even the product of any collection of linear spaces. It is also
evident, upon inspection of the linear structure of the linear space Rn, that Rn is
the n-fold product of R with itself, where R is viewed as a linear space over itself.
Similarly, Cn is the n-fold product of C with itself.
We now turn to consider the quotient construction of a linear space by a linear
subspace. This construction is, in some sense, the reversal of the product construc-
tion. We refer the reader to Sect. 1.2.15 of the Preliminaries for basic facts about
equivalence relations.
Deﬁnition 2.10 Let V be a linear space and U a subspace of it. Two elements
x1, x2 ∈V are said to be equivalent modulo U if
x1 −x2 ∈U
that is, if
x1 = x2 + u

70
2
Linear Spaces
for some u ∈U. This relation is denoted by x1 = x2(mod U), by x1 ≡U x2, or simply
by x1 ≡x2 if U is evident.
We show that ≡is an equivalence relation on V . Indeed, for all x, y, z ∈V
x −x = 0 ∈U
and thus
x ≡x
so that ≡is reﬂexive. Further,
x ≡y =⇒x −y ∈U =⇒y −x = (−1) · (x −y) ∈U =⇒y ≡x
and thus ≡is symmetric. Finally,
x −y, y −z ∈U =⇒x −z = (x −y) + (y −z) ∈U =⇒x ≡z
and so ≡is transitive.
Recall that the equivalence class of any vector x ∈V is the set
[x] = {y ∈V | x ≡y}.
In other words, it is the set of all vectors of the form x + u, where u ∈U. For that
reason the equivalence class [x] is also denoted by
x + U.
It follows from the general theory of equivalence relations that {x + U | x ∈V } is a
partition of V .
Example 2.27 As a simple example, consider the usual 2-dimensional plane R2
and its subspace Y consisting of the ordinates. Let the element r ∈R2 be the vector
O −P from the origin to the point P in the plane. The equivalence class [r]Y, formed
by the vectors of R2 equivalent mod Y to r, is clearly given by all vectors O −Pi
with Pi lying on the parallel line to the Y-axis passing through the point P; all these
vectors are equivalent mod Y to each other.
The fact that the entire 2-dimensional space is partitioned by all such equivalence
classes is simply the fact that R2 is the disjoint union of all the lines parallel to the
Y axis, which are precisely the translates x + Y of Y.

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
71
We turn to investigate the quotient set V/U = {x + U | x ∈V } of equivalence
classes modulo U. It is natural to introduce an addition and a scalar product on V/U
by the formulas
(y + U) + (z + U) = (y + z) + U
and
α(y + U) = (αy) + U,
but we must ﬁrst verify that these operations are well deﬁned, namely that they do
not depend on the chosen representatives. So, for all x, y, x′, y′ ∈V we need to show
that if
x + U = x′ + U
and
y + U = y′ + U,
then
(x + y) + U = (x′ + y′) + U.
But the former equalities imply that
x′ −x ∈U and y′ −y ∈U
whilethelatterwillbeimpliedbyshowingthat(x′ + y′) −(x + y) ∈U.Andindeed,
since U is closed under addition,
(x′ + y′) −(x + y) = (x′ −x) + (y′ −y) ∈U.
A similar argument shows that the scalar product above is well deﬁned and thus
the quotient set V/U of equivalence classes is naturally endowed with an addition
operation and a scalar product operation.
Theorem 2.10 Let V be a linear space and U ⊆V a subspace. The quotient set
V/U of equivalence classes modulo U, with the operations of addition and scalar
multiplication as given above, is a linear space whose zero vector is U. Moreover, the
canonical projection π : V →V/U given by π(x) = x + U is a surjective linear
operator whose kernel is U.

72
2
Linear Spaces
Proof To see that U = 0 + U behaves neutrally with respect to addition note that
for all x + U ∈V/U
(x + U) + U = (x + U) + (0 + U) = (x + 0) + U = x + U.
The rest of the veriﬁcation of the linear space axioms, as well as the claims about
the canonical projection, follow similarly.
□
Deﬁnition 2.11 The linear space V/U constructed in Theorem 2.10 is called the
quotient space of V with respect to U, or simply as V modulo U.
Continuing the example above, R2/Y, that geometrically can be thought of as the
space of all vertical lines in R2, is a linear space. Another example is c/c00, the
quotient of the space c of all converging sequences of (say) real numbers, by the
subspace of all eventually 0 sequences. The quotient may be thought of as the space of
all sequences modulo ﬁnite changes. In analysis, the limit of a sequence is insensitive
to ﬁnite changes in the sequence, and so it is precisely this quotient that is of interest
already in elementary analysis.
2.4.4
Complementary Subspaces
Contemplating the quotient space associated to Example 2.27, one realizes that R2/Y
is isomorphic to X, and that under this isomorphism the canonical projection π :
R2 →R2/Y is nothing but the projection of R2 onto the X axis. This observation
generalizes to any quotient space construction.
Deﬁnition 2.12 Two subspaces U and W of a given linear space V are said to be
complementary if U ∩W = {0} and U + W = V .
The second condition states that any vector x ∈V can be decomposed as a sum
x = u + w with u ∈U and w ∈W. The ﬁrst condition forces the uniqueness of this
decomposition.
Proposition 2.11 If U and W are complementary subspaces of V , then any x ∈V
can be expressed uniquely as
x = u + w
with u ∈U and w ∈W.
The proof is left as an exercise. This unique decomposition is said to express V as a
direct sum of its subspaces U and W, a situation denoted by V = U ⊕W.
The following example shows that a given subspace U ⊆V may admit more than
one complementary subspace.

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
73
Example 2.28 (Continuing Example 2.27) In R2
any straight line N passing through the origin and not coincident with the subspace
Y is a complementary subspace. The unique decomposition of a vector pointing at
P as a sum of a vector from N and a vector from Y is formed by the dashed lines
forming a parallelogram with the given subspaces.
We may now present the main theorem relating complementary subspaces and
the quotient construction.
Theorem 2.11 Given a linear space V and two complementary subspaces U and
W, the quotient space V/U is naturally isomorphic to W (the meaning of ‘naturally’
is discussed below).
Proof Recall from Theorem 2.10 that the canonical projection π : V →V/U, given
by π(x) = x + U, is a linear operator. The result will be established by showing that
the restriction of π to W ⊆V is an isomorphism between W and V/U. All we have
to do is show that the restriction is a bijection. For injectivity we use Theorem 2.8
and show the kernel of the restriction is trivial. For that, suppose that π(w) = 0 for
some w ∈W, that is (recall that the zero vector in V/U is U)
w + U = U
and so w ∈U. But since
U ∩W = {0}
it follows that w = 0, as needed. For surjectivity, let y + U be an arbitrary element
in V/U. Writing y = u + w, with u ∈U and w ∈W, we get that

74
2
Linear Spaces
y + U = (u + w) + U = (u + U) + (w + U) = w + U = π(w).
□
Remark 2.16 The meaning of the isomorphism above being natural (or canonical)
is that its construction does not depend on any choice of basis. This is an important
observation since, as we saw, in inﬁnite-dimensional spaces it may be impossible to
actually describe any basis.
Corollary 2.5 Given a linear space V and a subspace U ⊆V , any two subspaces
W1 and W2 that are complementary to U are naturally isomorphic.
Proof Each of W1 and W2 is naturally isomorphic to V/U.
□
In the case of complementary spaces the stated isomorphism is independent of a basis
but it is dependent on the ability to express the ambient space as the direct sum of
the given subspace and each of its complements. If the latter can be done explicitly,
then an explicit formula for the isomorphism will emerge.

2.5
Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
So far in our treatment of linear spaces two geometric aspects are missing: angles
between vectors and the length of a vector. This situation is unavoidable since in
general linear spaces it need not be possible to coherently deﬁne any of these notions.
With extra structure these notions become available.
2.5.1
Inner Product Spaces
The reader is most likely familiar with the standard inner product on Rn, i.e.,
⟨x, y⟩=
n

k=1
xk yk.
The deﬁnition of an inner product space is a generalization of certain properties the
standard inner product has. We will not pause here to motivate this deﬁnition any
further, except for two comments. The ﬁrst is that the results below show that an inner
product allows one (at least in the real case) to speak of angles between vectors, thus
obtaining retrospective justiﬁcation for the axioms. The second comment pertains to
the non-arbitrary nature of the standard inner product; the reader is invited to discover
it from elementary geometry, i.e., the law of cosines.

78

Linear Spaces
Deﬁnition 2.13 (Inner Product Space) Let V be a linear space over K where K is
either R or C. Assume that a function ⟨−, −⟩: V × V →K is given. The function
⟨−, −⟩is said to be an inner product if for all x, y, z ∈V and α, β ∈K the following
conditions hold.
Conjugate symmetry or Hermitian symmetry
⟨y, x⟩= ⟨x, y⟩
Linearity in the second argument:
⟨x, αy + βz⟩= α⟨x, y⟩+ β⟨x, z⟩
Positivity:
⟨x, x⟩≥0
Deﬁniteness:
⟨x, x⟩= 0 =⇒x = 0
where ⟨x, y⟩is the complex conjugate of ⟨x, y⟩. Positivity and deﬁniteness are often
juxtaposed to saying that ⟨−, −⟩is positive deﬁnite. Using the inner product the norm
of a vector x ∈V is ∥x∥= √⟨x, x⟩.
The linear space V together with the function ⟨−, −⟩is then called an inner
product space. To emphasize that K = R we use the term real inner product space
while the case K = C is termed complex inner product space. The scalar ⟨x, y⟩is
the inner product of the given vectors (in that order!).
Remark 2.17 Notice that when K = R conjugate symmetry reduces to symmetry,
that is
⟨y, x⟩= ⟨x, y⟩,
and the inner product is also linear in its ﬁrst argument, namely,
⟨αx + βy, z⟩= α⟨x, z⟩+ β⟨y, z⟩.
In the complex case one generally has
⟨αx + βy, z⟩= α⟨x, z⟩+ β⟨y, z⟩,
as follows easily from conjugate symmetry and linearity in the second argument.
In both real and complex inner product spaces the inner product is additive in each
argument. We mention as well that in mathematical circles it is common to write
(x, y) instead of ⟨y, x⟩, that is to deﬁne an inner product as being linear in the ﬁrst
argument rather than the second. Obviously, the difference is only cosmetic.
Example 2.29 Consider the linear space Rn and the deﬁnition
x · y = (x1, . . . , xn) · (y1, . . . , yn) =
n

k=1
xk yk.
With this deﬁnition it is easily seen that Rn becomes a real inner product space.
Similarly, considering Cn, deﬁning

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
79
x · y = (x1, . . . , xn) · (y1, . . . , yn) =
n

k=1
xk yk
endows Cn with the structure of a complex inner product space. Notice that for
x, y ∈R∞the ‘obvious deﬁnition’
x · y = (x1, . . .) · (y1, . . .) =
∞

k=1
xk yk
fails to endow R∞with the structure of an inner product space, simply because the
sum may fail to converge, so this is not even a function.
Example 2.30 Consider the space C(I, R) of continuous real valued functions on
the interval I = [a, b]. The familiar properties of the integral show at once that
deﬁning, for all x, y ∈C(I, R),
⟨x, y⟩=

endows C(I, R) with the structure of a real inner product space. With the proper
conjugation in the integral above, the space C(I, C) of continuous complex valued
functions becomes a complex inner product space.
Before we present any further examples let us explore some elementary, and not so
elementary, general results.
Proposition 2.12 For all vectors x, y in an inner product space V (either real or
complex)
∥x + y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 + 2|⟨x, y⟩| + ∥y∥2.
Proof Expanding ∥x + y∥2 = ⟨x + y, x + y⟩we see that
⟨x + y, x + y⟩= ⟨x, x + y⟩+ ⟨y, x + y⟩= ⟨x, x⟩+ ⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨y, x⟩+ ⟨y, y⟩
and thus the claim will follow by showing that
⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨y, x⟩≤2 · |⟨x, y⟩|,
which is immediate if V is a real inner product space. In the complex case suppose
that ⟨x, y⟩= u + iv. Then
⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨y, x⟩= ⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨x, y⟩= 2 · u
and since
|u| =
√
u2 ≤

u2 + v2 = |u + iv| = |⟨x, y⟩|

the result follows.
□
The geometric interpretation of the norm ∥x∥is that it is the length of the vector x.
As for the geometric meaning of the inner product, notice that any non-zero vector
x ∈V can be normalized by deﬁning ˆx = x/∥x∥, a vector of unit length. For any
vector x of unit length and an arbitrary vector y, the scalar ⟨x, y⟩is interpreted as the
component of the vector y in the direction x. Consequently, we make the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.14 Let V be an inner product space. Two vectors x, y ∈V are said to
be orthogonal or perpendicular if ⟨x, y⟩= 0.
Theorem 2.12 (Pythagoras’ Theorem) The equality
∥x + y∥2 = ∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2
holds for all orthogonal vectors x and y in an inner product space.
Proof ∥x + y∥2=⟨x + y, x + y⟩=∥x∥2 + ⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨y, x⟩+ ∥y∥2=∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2.□
We see that the vanishing of the inner product ⟨x, y⟩is the algebraic manifestation
of the angle formed by the vectors being a right angle. The relationship between
angles and the inner product goes deeper.
2.5.2
The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
The following inequality is among the most important inequalities in mathematics.
It has numerous uses, some of which we will see immediately and some later on.
Theorem 2.13 (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality) The inequality
|⟨x, y⟩| ≤∥x∥∥y∥
holds for all vectors x, y in an inner product space V . Equality holds if, and only if,
x and y are co-linear, namely one is a scalar multiple of the other.
Proof For simplicity let us assume V is a real inner product space (a slight adap-
tation is needed for the complex case). The inequality is trivial when x = 0 and so
we proceed assuming that x ̸= 0. Let ˆx = x/∥x∥be the normalization of x, so in
particular ∥ˆx∥= 1. Dividing the desired inequality by ∥x∥we see that we need to
establish the inequality
|⟨ˆx, y⟩| ≤∥y∥
(and so the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality acquires the interpretation that the absolute
value of a component of y in a given unit direction sets a lower bound on the length
of y). Rewriting y to identify its component in the ˆx direction we obtain

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
81
y = yˆx + (y −yˆx)
where yˆx = ⟨ˆx, y⟩ˆx. Since
⟨ˆx, y −yˆx⟩= ⟨ˆx, y⟩−⟨ˆx, yˆx⟩= ⟨ˆx, y⟩−⟨ˆx, y⟩⟨ˆx, ˆx⟩= 0
it follows that yˆx and y −yˆx are orthogonal. Pythagoras’ Theorem now yields
∥y∥2 = ∥yˆx∥2 + ∥y −yˆx∥2 ≥∥yˆx∥2 = ⟨ˆx, y⟩2.
Extracting square roots completes the proof (and the clause regarding equality is left
as an exercise).
□
Since we now know that in a real inner product space
−1 ≤⟨x, y⟩
∥x∥∥y∥≤1
for all non-zero vectors x and y, it follows that
θ = arccos ⟨x, y⟩
∥x∥∥y∥
is deﬁned. Stated differently,
⟨x, y⟩= cos θ∥x∥∥y∥
and so we deﬁne θ to be the angle between the vectors x and y. With that done we
can write
∥x −y∥2 = ∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2 −2 cos(θ)∥x∥∥y∥
simply by expanding the left-hand side. This is the law of cosines.
2.5.3
Normed Spaces
In an inner product space every vector can be assigned a norm. A normed space is
an abstraction of some key properties of this norm. This is useful since, as we will
see, many linear spaces fail to admit an inner product but do admit the structure of
a normed space. In such spaces one may still speak of the length of a vector, but not
(necessarily) of angles between vectors.
Deﬁnition 2.15 (Normed Space) A linear space V with a function x →∥x∥, that
associates with every vector x ∈V a real number ∥x∥, called the norm of x, is said
to be a normed space if for all vectors x, y ∈V and α ∈K

Linear Spaces
Positivity:
∥x∥> 0 provided x ̸= 0
Homogeneity:
∥αx∥= |α|∥x∥
Triangle inequality:
∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
The following result is an immediate consequence of the axioms.
Proposition 2.13 Let V be a normed linear space. For all vectors x, y ∈V :
1. ∥x∥= 0 if, and only if, x = 0.
2. ∥−x∥= ∥x∥.
3. ∥x −y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
4. |∥x∥−∥y∥| ≤∥x −y∥.
Proof 1. Using homogeneity, ∥0∥= ∥0 · 0∥= 0 · ∥0∥= 0, and together with pos-
itivity the claim follows.
2. Using homogeneity, ∥−x∥= ∥(−1) · x∥= 1 · ∥x∥= ∥x∥.
3. Using (2) and the triangle inequality, ∥x −y∥= ∥x + (−y)∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
4. We need to show that −∥x −y∥≤∥x∥−∥y∥≤∥x −y∥. Using (3) and the
triangle inequality, ∥x∥= ∥(x + y) −y∥≤∥x + y∥+ ∥y∥and similarly ∥y∥≤
∥x∥+ ∥x −y∥, as needed.
□
The deﬁnition of normed space was motivated by certain intuitive properties that the
lengths of vectors, as modeled by the norm in an inner product space, satisfy. The
next result shows that the inner product formalism indeed gives rise to a normed
space, as expected.
Lemma 2.4 An inner product space with its associated norm is a normed space.
Proof Recall that the norm in an inner product space is given by ∥x∥= √⟨x, x⟩,
and so positivity of the norm is immediate. The computation
∥αx∥2 = ⟨αx, αx⟩= αα⟨x, x⟩= |α|2∥x∥2
yields homogeneity. As for the triangle inequality, by Proposition 2.12
∥x + y∥2 = ⟨x + y, x + y⟩≤∥x∥2 + 2|⟨x, y⟩| + ∥y∥2
and by applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we obtain that
∥x + y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 + 2∥x∥∥y∥+ ∥y∥2 = (∥x∥+ ∥y∥)2
from which the result follows by extracting square roots.
□

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
83
We saw that an inner product space determines a norm by means of ∥x∥=
√⟨x, x⟩. In that case the inner product can be expressed in terms of the norm through
the polarization identity
real case:
⟨x, y⟩= 1
4

∥x + y∥2 −∥x −y∥2
complex case:
⟨x, y⟩= 1
4

∥x + y∥2 −∥x −y∥2 + i∥x + iy∥2 −i∥x −iy∥2
as a straightforward computation reveals. A natural question is whether every normed
space arises in this way from an inner product space. The polarization identity shows
that if so, then the inner product is unique. However, not every norm is the norm
associated to an inner product. Recall, from elementary geometry, that for a paral-
lelogram the sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the
diagonals. Since only lengths are involved in the statement it can be interpreted in
any normed space, but it only holds when the norm is that associated with an inner
product.
Proposition 2.14 In an inner product space V the parallelogram identity
2∥x∥2 + 2∥y∥2 = ∥x + y∥2 + ∥x −y∥2
holds for all x, y ∈V .
Proof A straightforward computation.
□
Remarkably, the converse is also true.
Theorem 2.14 If V is a normed space in which the parallelogram identity holds for
all vectors, then V admits an inner product that induces the given norm.
Proof We focus only on the real case. The polarization identity dictates the ﬁrst step:
if such an inner product exists it must be given by
⟨x, y⟩= 1
4

∥x + y∥2 −∥x −y∥2
for all x, y ∈V . We need to verify that ⟨−, −⟩is indeed an inner product. Symmetry
of ⟨−, −⟩follows immediately from the fact that ∥y −x∥= ∥x −y∥:
⟨y, x⟩= 1
4

∥y + x∥2 −∥y −x∥2
= 1
4

∥x + y∥2 −∥x −y∥2
= ⟨x, y⟩.
Since
⟨x, x⟩= 1
4

∥2x∥2
= ∥x∥2

84
2
Linear Spaces
we see that ⟨−, −⟩is positive deﬁnite and that its associated norm is the one given.
So far we made no use of the parallelogram identity and so, expectedly, it must
appear when establishing the remaining properties, namely additivity and homo-
geneity of ⟨−, −⟩in the second argument. Unfortunately, the proof is lengthy and
rather technical but otherwise uninformative and not entertaining, and we thus omit
it.
□
Let us consider an illustrative and important family of normed spaces where we
can see the above theorem in action. All of the norms will be deﬁned on the same
underlying linear space, namely R2. For all p > 0 let
∥(x1, x2)∥p =

|x1|p + |x2|p1/p ,
deﬁned for all vectors (x1, x2) ∈R2. We also set ∥(x1, x2)∥∞= max{|x1|, |x2|}. In
the next section we consider a more general family of normed spaces and from the
results there it follows that for each p ≥1 the deﬁnition of ∥−∥p endows R2 with
an inner product. For now, we present some geometric aspects by visualizing the set
of vectors forming the unit circle, namely
{(x1, x2) ∈R2 | ∥(x1, x2)∥p = 1}
for various values of p, shown in Fig. 2.1.
Firstly, when p = 2 the norm is the one associated to the standard inner product
in R2. Its geometry is the familiar Euclidean geometry of the plane. The fact that
∥−∥2 satisﬁes the parallelogram identity is thus the algebraic incarnation of the
same identity from elementary geometry. For p ≥1 each ∥−∥p is still a norm but
only for p = 2 is it induced by an inner product. This is so since the parallelogram
identity fails. For instance, 2

∥x∥2
1 + ∥y∥2
1

= ∥x + y∥2
1 + ∥x −y∥2
1 fails for the
vectors x = (1, 0), y = (0, 1) by direct computation; the diagonals are too long.
A common feature of these unit circles for p ≥1 is convexity: the straight line
connecting any two points on each such circle is contained within the circle. It is also
apparent that each unit circle is symmetric about the origin and bounded along each
direction. These properties are characteristic of unit balls in normed spaces.
Lemma 2.5 Let V be a normed space and B = {x ∈V | ∥x∥≤1} the unit ball in
it. Then B is convex, namely tx + (1 −t)y ∈B for all x, y ∈B and 0 ≤t ≤1, B is
symmetric about the origin, namely −x ∈B whenever x ∈B, and the intersection
of B with any straight line through the origin is a ﬁnite segment.
Proof Given x, y ∈B and 0 ≤t ≤1 the triangle inequality yields
∥tx + (1 −t)y∥≤∥tx∥+ ∥(1 −t)y∥= t∥x∥+ (1 −t)∥y∥= 1
so tx + (1 −t)y ∈B. The symmetry claim and the intersection with a line follow
at once from homogeneity.
□

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces

Fig. 2.1 Unit circles in R2 for different values of p
We can now conclude that ∥−∥p for p < 1 is not a norm. Together with a
topological property, namely B being closed, the three properties in the lemma are
also sufﬁcient; given such a closed set B there exists a unique norm on the ambient
space whose unit ball is precisely B. Closed sets will be discussed in the chapter on
topological spaces. In R2 it is the usual notion, i.e., a subset containing all of its limit
points with respect to the Euclidean metric.
We close the section, and the chapter, by introducing two very important families
of normed spaces. The ℓp spaces, introduced already in Example 2.25, are spaces of
sequences and each carries its own norm, the ℓp norm. The second family of spaces,
the pre-L p spaces, allude to the family of L p spaces and the L p norm. These spaces
are studied in more detail in Chap. 5.

2.5.4
The Family of ℓp Spaces
For the reader’s convenience we repeat here the deﬁnition of the ℓp spaces and
augment it with the deﬁnition of the ℓp norm.
Deﬁnition 2.16 Let 1 ≤p < ∞be a real number. The set ℓp consists of all
sequences x = (x1, . . . , xk, . . .) of complex numbers for which

|xk|p < ∞.
The ℓp-norm of x is

The ℓ∞space is the space of all bounded sequences x of complex numbers and the
ℓ∞norm is
∥x∥∞= sup
k
|xk|.
These spaces are over the ﬁeld C. By considering sequences of real numbers one
obtains similar spaces over the ﬁeld R which, ambiguously, are also referred to as
ℓp spaces.
Itisimmediatethat∥x∥p = 0 if,andonlyif, x = 0.Tofurtherinvestigatethestructure
of ℓp, we need the following classical result.
Proposition 2.15 (Young’s Inequality) The inequality
ab ≤a p
p + bq
q
holds for all positive real numbers p and q satisfying 1/p + 1/q = 1 and non-
negative real numbers a and b, with equality if, and only if, a p = bq.
Proof Recall the weighted arithmetic-geometric means inequality
w
xw1
1 xw2
2
≤w1x1 + w2x2
w
which holds for all non-negative real numbers x1, x2, and all positive weights w1, w2,
with w = w1 + w2. Applying this inequality to the numbers x1 = a p and x2 = bq,
with weights w1 = 1/p and w2 = 1/q, yields the result.
□
The next inequality is used often when manipulating elements of the spaces ℓp.
It is used below to establish the triangle inequality when proving that each ℓp space,

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
87
with its ℓp norm, is a normed space. It is convenient to ﬁrst introduce the following
notation. For any two sequences x = (x1, . . . , xk, . . .) and y = (y1, . . . , yk, . . .), let
xy = (x1y1, . . . , xk yk, . . .),
namely, the vector of component-wise products of the given vectors.
Theorem 2.15 (Hölder’s Inequality) Given positive real numbers p and q for which
1/p + 1/q = 1, the inequality
∥xy∥1 ≤∥x∥p · ∥y∥q
holds for all x ∈ℓp and y ∈ℓq.
Proof The case where either ∥x∥p = 0 or ∥y∥q = 0 is trivial and so we may assume
this is not so. By component-wise division of x and y, respectively, by ∥x∥p and
∥y∥q, we may assume that ∥x∥p = ∥y∥q = 1, namely that

and, by simplifying, the claimed inequality is established.
□
Theorem 2.17 For all 1 ≤p ≤∞the space ℓp is a normed linear space.
Proof The case p = ∞is left for the reader, so assume that p < ∞. The non-
negativity of ∥x∥p is clear from the deﬁnition of the norm and it was already noted
that it is immediate that ∥x∥= 0 implies x = 0. Homogeneity, is also immediate
since
∥αx∥p

2.5.5
The Family of Pre-Lp Spaces
With the large family {ℓp}1≤p≤∞of normed spaces at hand one can put the general
theory to use for sequences. Noticing that ℓp ⊂ℓq for all 1 ≤p < q ≤∞, and with
sequences inℓp converging faster to 0 than sequences in ℓq, given a bounded sequence
one would typically try to identify a suitable p such that the sequence is found in ℓp,
and proceed to apply the general theory to the problem at hand.
As long as sequences are concerned the ℓp spaces are adequate, but quite often
whenmodellingaphysicalproblemmathematicallyoneobtainsafunctionratherthan
a sequence. It is thus desirable to consider normed spaces of functions. Obtaining
the correct analogue of the ℓp spaces, namely the L p spaces, requires some more

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
89
sophisticated machinery than what we currently have. At this point we present what
we call the pre-L p spaces.
Consider the linear space C([a, b], R) of all continuous functions x : [a, b] →R
(we note that with the necessary modiﬁcations in the coming deﬁnitions and proofs,
one may alter the domain, as well as consider complex-valued functions). The pre-L p
space K p, for 1 ≤p < ∞, is the space C([a, b], R) with the L p norm given by
∥x∥p =

 b
a
dt |x(t)|p
1/p
and we immediately note that ∥x∥= 0 implies x = 0 (due to the continuity of x).
Lastly, K∞the space C([a, b], R) with the L∞norm given by
∥x∥∞= sup
a≤t≤b
{|x(t)|}.
The rest of the section is devoted to showing that K p with the L p norm is a normed
space for all 1 ≤p ≤∞. In fact, the proof is formally identical to the case of the ℓp
spaces. Indeed, the only ingredient one needs is the following version of Hölder’s
Inequality.
Theorem 2.18 (Hölder’s Inequality) Given positive real numbers p and q such that
1/p + 1/q = 1, the inequality
∥xy∥1 ≤∥x∥p · ∥y∥q
holds for all x ∈K p and y ∈Kq, where xy is the function (xy)(t) = x(t)y(t).
Proof An inspection of the proof of Hölder’s Inequality for sequences reveals that it
was obtained by a point-wise application of Young’s Inequality as well as properties
of summation that are well known to hold for integration as well. The same argument
can thus be used to establish Hölder’s Inequality for functions.
□
The details of the proof of the following result are formally identical to the proof of
Theorem 2.17
Theorem 2.19 For all 1 ≤p ≤∞the pre-L p space K p is a normed linear space.
Remark 2.18 Note again that the domain of the functions x in a pre-L p space can be
altered (sometimes with necessary extra care) and that the codomain can be replaced
by C (with obvious adaptations to the deﬁnition of the L p norm). All such spaces
are still called pre-L p spaces and denoted, ambiguously, by K p. The L p spaces will
be introduced in Chap. 5.

Further Reading
Introductory level texts on linear algebra typically treat linear spaces with a strong
emphasis on techniques of matrices. When bases are not explicitly available, as in

92

Linear Spaces
the inﬁnite-dimensional case, this approach must be replaced by a coordinate-free
approach, as was done in this chapter. For an introductory level text treating linear
algebra in a coordinate-free fashion see Chaps. 10–12 of [2]. A more advanced text
with a coordinate-free approach, as well as an algebraically much deeper approach
to linear algebra, making the connection between linear spaces and modules, is [3].
Another text that bridges the gap between matrix-centric linear algebra and Hilbert
space theory is [1]. The reader seeking to enhance her intuition and ability with the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is advised to consider [4].

Topological Spaces
Topology is often described as rubber-sheet geometry, namely the study of geo-
metric properties that are insensitive to stretching and shrinking, without tearing
or gluing. Famously, for a topologist, there is no difference between a cup and a
donut. The impact of topology on modern mathematics is difﬁcult to quantify but
virtually impossible to exaggerate. Without a doubt its place as one of the pillars of
mathematics is secured.
The deﬁnition of a topological space is an abstraction of part of the structure of the
real line, speciﬁcally that part that allows one to speak of continuity and convergence.
The choice for the topological notions introduced in this chapter is dictated by two
needs. One need is to familiarize the reader with those topological concepts that
are most relevant in the context of this book, the other is to acclimatize the reader
to topology, its main results, and its techniques. These two needs pull in slightly
different directions and this chapter represents a compromise. We provide the reader
with sufﬁcient motivation for the concepts while keeping things ﬁrmly grounded in
analysis.
Section 3.1 presents the deﬁnition of a topology and the accompanying notion
of continuity, followed by a detailed construction of the Euclidean topology on the
real numbers R. The associated notion of continuity is shown to be equivalent to
the usual one, motivating the deﬁnitions. Section 3.2 is a basic study of convergence
in the topological setting, its relation to cluster points, and its behaviour under the
ﬁrst countability axiom. Section 3.3 is concerned with techniques for constructing
topologies, in particular by forcing a collection of sets to be open sets and by forcing a
collection of functions to be continuous. Coproducts, products, and quotients are then
given as particular examples. Section 3.4 discusses the Hausdorff separation property
and topological connectivity and Sect. 3.5 is a study of compactness, developing
enough material to prove the Heine-Borel Theorem.

3.1
Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
The deﬁnition of a topology is quite simple; a certain collection of subsets of a set
satisfying easily stated axioms. However, without further motivation, the axioms
may appear arbitrary and not too palatable. To assist the reader digest the notion,
the deﬁnitions below are immediately succeeded by a detailed motivating discussion
taking place in the familiar setting of the real numbers R. The motivation we give
is of a topology as the result of stripping away redundancies in the deﬁnition of
continuity. We then explore various examples of topological spaces.
3.1.1
Deﬁnition and Motivation
We present the deﬁnition of a topological space followed by the deﬁnition of a
continuous function between topological spaces. The abstract deﬁnitions are then
exempliﬁed in the context of the real numbers, establishing the Euclidean topology
on R, and, through the process, justifying the abstract deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 3.1 A topology τX on an arbitrary set X is a collection of subsets of X
such that the following conditions hold.
1. Both the empty set ∅and the entire set X are members of τX.
2. τX is stable under arbitrary unions. That is, if {Ui}i∈I is a family of elements in
τX, then

i∈I
Ui ∈τX.
3. τX is stable under ﬁnite intersections. That is, if U1, . . . ,Um are members of τX,
then
U1 ∩· · · ∩Um ∈τX.
The pair (X, τX) is called a topological space and the members of τX are referred to as
open sets. We often speak of the topological space X without explicitly mentioning
τX. We write (X, τ) if there is no need to syntactically remind ourselves that the
collection τ consists of the open sets of X.
Remark 3.1 Clearly, stability under ﬁnite intersections is equivalent to the condition
that U1 ∩U2 ∈τX for any two open sets U1,U2 ∈τX.
For the following deﬁnition, and as a general advise for safely taking the ﬁrst few
steps into the realm of topology, the reader may wish to review the basic properties
of inverse images (e.g., Sect. 1.2.9 of the Preliminaries).
Deﬁnition 3.2 Let(X, τX)and(Y, τY )betopologicalspaces.Afunction f : X →Y
is said to be continuous if f −1(U) is an open set in X whenever U is an open set in
Y. In other words, f is continuous if

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
95
U ∈τY =⇒f −1(U) ∈τX.
The following results establish a particular topology on the set R of real numbers,
and investigate the notion of continuity with respect to that topology. The aim is two-
fold; to exemplify the deﬁnitions in a concrete and familiar setting, and to motivate
the deﬁnitions.
Recall that a function f : R →R is said to be continuous if, intuitively, small
changes in the value of x cause small changes in the value of f (x). Formally, f
is continuous if for every point x0 ∈R and ε > 0 one can ﬁnd a δ > 0 such that if
|x −x0| < δ, then | f (x) −f (x0)| < ε. The absolute value function is used here in
the role of a measurement device for distances. However, the notion of continuity is
quiteinsensitivetonumerouschangesonecanperformontheabsolutevaluefunction.
Continuity is a local phenomenon, and so if one truncates the absolute value function
and deﬁnes
|x|t =

|x| if |x| < 1
1
otherwise,
then continuity with respect to |x| and with respect to |x|t coincide. Scaling effects,
such as deﬁning |x|2 = 2|x|, also have no effect on continuity in the precise sense
that continuity with respect to |x| and with respect to |x|2 coincide.
The decision to use the absolute value function in formulating the deﬁnition of
continuity (or, more generally, that of limit) is thus revealed to be an arbitrary choice
among many topologically equivalent alternatives. It is a natural question whether
onecandistilladeﬁnitionofcontinuitydevoidofanyarbitraryandirrelevantstructure
and consequently furnish a better understanding of the concept of continuity. The
afﬁrmative answer is given as follows. Call a subset U ⊆R open if for every x ∈U
there exists an ε > 0 such that Bε(x) ⊆U, where we deﬁne
Bε(x) = {y ∈R | |x −y| < ε} = (x −ε, x + ε),
the open interval of radius ε about x. With the aim of utilizing these sets to deﬁne a
topology on R, we ﬁrst prove that any open interval is an open set.
Proposition 3.1 The open interval Bε(x) = (x −ε, x + ε), for all x ∈R and ε > 0,
is an open set.
Proof Given y ∈Bε(x) = (x −ε, x + ε), we are required to ﬁnd a δ > 0 such that
Bδ(y) = (y −δ, y + δ) ⊆Bε(x). Let
δ = ε −|x −y|
and note that δ > 0. Elementary algebra shows this δ suits our purposes.
□
We can now present our ﬁrst example of a topology; an important enough example
that we state it as a theorem.

96

Topological Spaces
Theorem 3.1 The collection τ of all open sets U ⊆R is a topology on R.
Proof The empty set vacuously satisﬁes the condition for being an open set, simply
as it has no points at all. The set R itself is clearly an open set, since if x ∈R, then
x ∈B1(x) ⊆R. Thus the ﬁrst condition in the deﬁnition of a topology is satisﬁed.
To show stability under arbitrary unions, suppose that {Ui}i∈I is a family of open
sets in R and we need to show that
U =

i∈I
Ui
is open. Indeed, if x ∈U, then x ∈Ui for some i ∈I. But since Ui is open, there
exists a δ > 0 with
Bδ(x) ⊆Ui ⊆U,
as required. It remains to show for any two open sets U1,U2 ⊆R that U1 ∩U2 is
open. Indeed, if x ∈U1 ∩U2, then there are δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 with
Bδ1(x) ⊆U1
Bδ2(x) ⊆U2.
Setting δ = min{δ1, δ2} (and noting that δ > 0), one easily sees that
Bδ(x) ⊆Bδ1(x) ∩Bδ2(x) ⊆U1 ∩U2,
as required, and thus completing the proof.
□
Deﬁnition 3.3 The collection of all open sets U ⊆R as just deﬁned is called the
Euclidean topology on R. It is also commonly referred to as the standard topology
or the ordinary topology.
The open sets turn out to contain enough information about the space R in order to
completely characterize continuity, as follows.
Theorem 3.2 A function f : R →R is continuous in the usual meaning if, and only
if, f −1(U) is an open set for every open set U ⊆R.
Proof Suppose f is continuous and let U be an open set. Our aim is to show that
f −1(U) is open. Let x0 ∈f −1(U), that is y0 = f (x0) ∈U, and our aim is to ﬁnd a
δ > 0 such that
Bδ(x0) ⊆f −1(U).
Since U is open, there exists an ε > 0 such that
Bε(y0) = (y0 −ε, y0 + ε) ⊆U.

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
97
By continuity of f , there exists a δ > 0 such that | f (x) −y0| < ε, provided that
|x −x0| < δ. But that means that for every x ∈Bδ(x0)
f (x) ∈Bε(y0) ⊆U.
In other words, x ∈f −1(U) for all x in the set Bδ(x0), and so
Bδ(x0) ⊆f −1(U),
which is what we set out to obtain.
In the other direction, suppose that f −1(U) is an open set whenever U is an
open set. Given a point x0 ∈R and an ε > 0, let y0 = f (x0) and consider the set
U = Bε(y0), and notice that U is itself an open set. By assumption, the set f −1(U)
is an open set, and it contains x0. There is thus a δ > 0 such that Bδ(x0) ⊆f −1(U).
Thus, if |x −x0| < δ, then x ∈Bδ(x0), and therefore f (x) ∈Bε(y0), showing that
| f (x) −f (x0)| < ε. In other words, f is continuous at x0. Since x0 was arbitrary, f
is continuous.
□
Recalling Deﬁnition 3.2 the result above can be restated as follows.
Theorem 3.3 A function f : R →R is continuous in the usual sense if, and only if,
it is continuous with respect to the Euclidean topology on R.
This result justiﬁes and motivates Deﬁnition 3.2 and, a-priori, the deﬁnition of a
topology. Let us pause to reﬂect on the situation right now. The familiar notion
of continuity for functions f : R →R was seen to be faithfully captured by the
collection of open sets U ⊆R. The collection of open sets was deﬁned in terms of
Bε(x) = {y ∈R | |x −y| < ε}, thus still directly using the absolute value function.
It would thus seem that we had accomplished nothing except for hiding the absolute
value function in some fancy notation. However, something quite substantial was
achieved. Consider the scaled absolute value function |x|2 = 2 · |x|, and let us deﬁne
B2,ε(x) = {y ∈R | |x −y|2 < ε} =

x −ε
2, x + ε
2

for all x ∈R and ε > 0. Let us further say that a set U ⊆R is 2-open if for all x ∈U
there exists an ε > 0 such that B2,ε(x) ⊆U. In other words, we repeat the deﬁnition
of open sets, replacing the absolute value function by a scaled version of it.
Proposition 3.2 The collection of open sets and the collection of 2-open sets are
the same.
Proof Notice that
Bε/4(x) ⊆B2,ε(x) ⊆Bε(x)
holds for all x ∈R and ε > 0. Thus, if U is an open set and x ∈U, then
Bε(x) ⊆U

98
3
Topological Spaces
for some ε > 0, but then
B2,ε(x) ⊆Bε(x) ⊆U
and so U is also 2-open. Conversely, if U is 2-open and x ∈U, then
B2,ε(x) ⊆U
for some ε > 0, but then
Bε/4(x) ⊆B2,ε(x) ⊆U
and so U is also open.
□
Similarly, one may show that the collection of open sets is insensitive to other changes
in the absolute value function, such as scaling by other factors or various truncations.
It is not a coincidence that those changes to the absolute value function that are
immaterial to the notion of continuity are also immaterial to the concept of open set.
Indeed, Theorem 3.2 characterizes continuity in terms of the open sets alone.
Thus, by concentrating on the open sets one is freed from the irrelevant (for the
purposes of continuity) particularities of the absolute value function. The deﬁnition
of a topology is thus an abstraction of a particular formulation of continuity that
avoids directly mentioning any particular concept of R that is irrelevant to the notion
of continuity. As with any abstraction, once it is made, a plethora of new situations
emerges, situations that superﬁcially have little to do with the geometric notion
of continuity. Introducing a topology on a set immediately allows one to import a
signiﬁcant amount of geometric intuition, machinery, and analogy into an a-priori
non-geometric context.
3.1.2
More Examples
We present more topological spaces, illustrating the versatility of the formalism. We
remark that there are far more interesting examples of topological spaces than can
be recounted in this book. The choice of the examples given below is dictated by the
focus of the book; the examples are chosen to elucidate the forthcoming topological
concepts, while avoiding delving into the intricacies of the more obscure examples of
topological spaces, thus allowing the reader to ease into the topological framework
while remaining ﬁrmly grounded in analysis.
Example 3.1 (Discrete And Indiscrete Topologies) Any set X supports two extreme
topologies on it. One is the collection {∅, X}, called the indiscrete topology on X
and the other is the collection of all subsets of X, called the discrete topology on X.
It is immediate to verify that these are indeed topologies, and that they are distinct
topologies except when |X| ≤1.

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
99
Example 3.2 (The Sierpi´nski Space) Let S = {0, 1} be a set with two elements. The
collection
{∅, S, {1}}
is readily seen to be a topology on S giving rise to what is known as the Sierpi´nski
space.
Example 3.3 Let X = {a, b, c, d, e}, be a nonempty set consisting of ﬁve elements.
Of the collections
τ = {X, ∅, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}}
G = {X, ∅, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d}}
H = {X, ∅, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {a, b, d, e}}
τ is a topology on X as the axioms are easily conﬁrmed by inspection. G is not a
topology on X, since {a} ∪{b, c, d} = {a, b, c, d} /∈G. The collection H is also not
a topology on X, since {c, d} ∩{a, b, d, e} = {d} /∈H.
Example 3.4 (The Coﬁnite and Cocountable Topologies) Let X be a set and τ
the family of all subsets U of X whose complement X \ U is ﬁnite, and if needed,
manually include ∅in τ. We show that τ is a topology on X. First, ∅∈τ by deﬁnition,
and since X \ X = ∅is ﬁnite, it follows that X ∈τ, and so the ﬁrst condition in the
deﬁnition of topology is satisﬁed. Stability under arbitrary unions is immediate, so
ﬁnally consider two sets U1,U2 with ﬁnite complements in X. Since
X \ (U1 ∩U2) = (X \ U1) ∪(X \ U2)
and since both (X \ U1) and (X \ U2) are ﬁnite, it follows that U1 ∩U2 has ﬁnite
complement too. This topology is called the coﬁnite topology on X. Notice that if
X is ﬁnite, then the coﬁnite topology coincides with the discrete topology on X
(Example 3.1).
Similarly, call a subsetU ⊆X cocountable if its complement X \ U is a countable
set. The collection of all cocountable subsets of X (with ∅added in manually) also
forms a topology on X called the cocountable topology. The proof is similar to the one
given above, with the necessary care when handling countable sets (see Sect. 1.2.13
of the Preliminaries).
3.1.3
Elementary Observations
We explore immediate properties of topological spaces and of continuous functions,
and we discuss the notion of homeomorphism. We start off with a useful criterion
for detecting open sets in an arbitrary topological space.

Topological Spaces
Proposition 3.3 A subset V of a topological space X is open if, and only if, for all
x ∈V there exists an open set Ux such that
x ∈Ux ⊆V.
Proof If V is open, then clearly for every x ∈V one may choose Ux = V . In the
other direction, the stated condition implies that
V =

x∈V
Ux
and so V is expressed as the union of open sets, and is thus itself open.
□
Proposition 3.4 The composition g ◦f : X →Z of any two continuous functions
X
f
Y
g
Z between topological spaces is itself continuous.
Proof Given an open set U in Z, we need to verify that (g ◦f )−1(U) is open in X.
The inverse image function satisﬁes
(g ◦f )−1(U) = f −1(g−1(U))
and since g is continuous it follows that g−1(U) is open in Y, and since f , too, is
continuous it follows that f −1(g−1(U)) is open in X.
□
Proposition 3.5 Given two topologies τ1 and τ2 on the same set X, the identity
function id : (X, τ1) →(X, τ2) is continuous if, and only if, τ2 ⊆τ1.
Proof Notice that for the identity function id : X →X and any subset U ⊆X (open
or not) one has id−1(U) = U. Thus, the condition for continuity is precisely that
U ∈τ1 for all U ∈τ2, in other words, that τ2 ⊆τ1.
□
Deﬁnition 3.4 Given two topologies τ1 and τ2 on the same set X, if τ1 ⊆τ2, then
τ1 is said to be coarser than τ2 while τ2 is said to be ﬁner than τ1.
Notice that the discrete topology on X is the ﬁnest topology among all topologies on
X while the indiscrete topology is the coarsest one. In general, different topologies
on the same set may be incomparable, i.e., one need not be contained in the other.
Deﬁnition 3.5 A function f : X →Y between topological spaces is said to be a
homeomorphism if f is bijective and both f : X →Y and f −1 : Y →X are con-
tinuous functions. If there exists a homeomorphism between X and Y, then X and
Y are said to be homeomorphic spaces.
Remark 3.2 One should not confuse between the terms homeomorphism and
homomorphism. The term homomorphism in algebra is typically used to indicate
a structure preserving function, with isomorphism used for the invertible structure
preserving functions. In topology, the structure preserving functions are precisely
the continuous functions, and the invertible structure preserving functions are called
homeomorphisms.

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
101
Note that f : X →Y is a homeomorphism if, and only if, for all U ⊆Y
f −1(U) ∈τX ⇐⇒U ∈τY.
Homeomorphic spaces thus have essentially the same collections of open sets, up
to a renaming of the elements. Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one
can be continuously changed, without gluing or tearing, to obtain the other. While
homeomorphic spaces must have the same cardinality (since a homeomorphism is
in particular a bijection), the converse quite often fails since both the bijection and
its inverse must be continuous. For instance, the circumference of a circle and a
line segment (say in R2) have the same cardinality, but they are not homeomorphic.
This is intuitively quite clear since (it would appear that) the only way to create the
hole that the circle encloses is to glue the two ends of the line segment, but that
changes the topology (i.e., glueing is a continuous operation but its inverse, tearing,
is not). However, turning such intuitive arguments into formal ones is usually not
straightforward.
Generally speaking, it can be quite tricky to prove that two topological spaces
are not homeomorphic. A common technique in establishing such a result is the
following one. A property P about topological spaces is said to be a topological
invariant if for all homeomorphic topological spaces X and Y, X has property P
precisely when Y does. To show that two spaces are not homeomorphic it thus
sufﬁces to ﬁnd a topological invariant that only one of the two spaces possesses. The
topological concepts introduced in the rest of this chapter often provide one with a
suitable topological invariant.
3.1.4
Closed Sets
With every subset S of a set X one may associate the complementary set Sc = X \ S,
giving rise to a bijective operation P(X) →P(X) on the set P(X) of all subsets of
X. It is thus clear that any concept given in terms of subsets of X gives rise, by
taking complements, to what must essentially be an equivalent concept. This general
observation holds for the deﬁnition of a topology, and we now devote some time for
the relevant details.
We ﬁrst observe that the Sierpi´nski space S = {0, 1} from Example 3.2 can be
used to identify the open sets in an arbitrary topological space.
Proposition 3.6 There exists a bijective correspondence between the open sets of a
topological space X and continuous functions f : X →S.
Proof Recall (e.g., Sect. 1.2.10 of the Preliminaries) that with every subset S ⊆X
one may associate the indicator function
fS(x) =

1 if x ∈S
0 if x /∈S

102
3
Topological Spaces
and that this correspondence is a bijection between all subsets of X and all functions
X →S. For fS : X →S to be continuous, the inverse image of every open set in
S, namely the sets ∅, S, and {1}, must be open in X. The set f −1
S (∅) = ∅is always
open in X and similarly so is f −1
S (S) = X. So, the only further condition imposed
by continuity is that f −1
S ({1}) must be open too, and since the latter set is precisely
S we see that continuous functions f : X →S correspond bijectively to the open
subsets of X.
□
Clearly, every function f : X →S is equally well completely determined by the
inverse image of 0 instead of the inverse image of 1. We thus see that there is also a
correspondence between continuous functions f : X →S and the complements of
the open sets in X, giving rise to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.6 A subset F of a topological space X is said to be closed provided its
complement X \ F is open.
The preceding discussion implies that a topology can be speciﬁed by the collection
of closed sets. The details are given in the following result.
Theorem 3.4 Let X be an arbitrary set. A given collection F of subsets of X is
the collection of closed sets for some topology on X if, and only if, the following
conditions hold.
1. Both the empty set ∅and the entire set X are members of F .
2. F is stable under ﬁnite unions. That is, if F1, . . . , Fm are members of F , then
F1 ∪· · · ∪Fm ∈F .
3. F is stable under arbitrary intersections. That is, if {Fi}i∈I are members of F ,
then

i∈I
Fi ∈F .
Moreover, a collection F satisfying the conditions above is the collection of closed
sets for a unique topology on X.
Proof Applying De Morgan’s Laws (see Sect. 1.2.5 of the Preliminaries), the details
arestraightforwardandareleft tothereader. Weonlystress out herethat thecollection
{X \ F | F ∈F }.
is the unique topology determined by F .
□
Example 3.5 If a set X is given the discrete topology, then every subset of it is
closed, while if X is given the indiscrete topology, then the only closed subsets of X
are ∅and X itself. In the Sierpi´nski space S = {0, 1}, the closed sets are: ∅, S, and
{0}.

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
103
Example 3.6 Consider R with the Euclidean topology (Deﬁnition 3.3). It is easy to
verify that for a, b ∈R with a < b, the open interval (a, b) is an open set and the
closed interval [a, b] is a closed set. The open rays (a, ∞) and (−∞, a) are also
open sets, and the closed rays [a, ∞) and (−∞, a] are closed sets. Every singleton
set {a} is a closed set. Consequently, every ﬁnite set F ⊆R is closed.
Remark 3.3 It should be emphasized that in general an arbitrary union of closed
sets need not be closed nor does an arbitrary intersection of open sets need be open.
For instance, consider R with the Euclidean topology (Deﬁnition 3.3). Since every
singleton set {x} is closed, every subset X ⊆R is the union of closed sets, i.e.,
X =

x∈X
{x}
but, of course, not every subset of R is closed. Similarly, for any x ∈R, one has
{x} =

ε>0
(x −ε, x + ε)
showing that {x} is an intersection of open sets, but is itself not open.
Remark 3.4 It is important to realize that a set is not a door. A set need not be open
nor closed, while it may be both open and closed. For instance, consider the topology
τ from Example 3.3. One easily veriﬁes that {a, c} is not closed nor open and that
{a} is both closed and open. Sets that are both closed and open are said to be clopen.
Notice that the empty set ∅and X itself are clopen in any topological space. If these
are the only clopen sets in X, then X is said to be connected, a property we explore
further in Sect. 3.4.
The dual nature of open and closed sets is seen in the following result. Recall that a
function f : X →Y between topological spaces is continuous if f −1(U) is open in
X for every open set U in Y.
Theorem 3.5 A function f : X →Y is continuous if, and only if, f −1(F) is a closed
set in X for every closed set F in Y.
The proof is, as it should be, a tautology that the reader is urged to clarify for herself.
The duality between open and closed sets is quite helpful since, while dual to
each other, open and closed sets have different topological qualities and thus it may
be more natural to establish a result in terms of closed sets rather than open ones, or
vice versa. The reader should be warned though that not all concepts that may appear
dual are in fact dual.
Deﬁnition 3.7 A function f : X →Y between topological spaces is
• an open mapping if f (U) is open in Y for every open set U in X.
• a closed mapping if f (F) is closed in Y for every closed set F in X.
The reader is invited to ﬁnd examples of open mappings that are not closed as well
as closed ones that are not open.

3.1.5
Bases and Subbases
Generally speaking, a topology is a very large collection of subsets. For instance, the
Euclidean topology on R has uncountably many open sets. It is thus often desirable
to obtain smaller (or at least more manageable) collections that give one access to
the entire topology. This is what bases and subbases are designed to achieve.
Deﬁnition 3.8 A collection B of open sets in a topological space X is a basis (or
a base) for the topology τX if for every open set U ⊆X and x ∈U there exists an
element B ∈B such that
x ∈B ⊆U.
The elements of B are called basis elements.
Example 3.7 For every topological space (X, τX) the collection B = τX is, quite
trivially, a basis. More interestingly, the collection {Bε(x) | x ∈R, ε > 0} is a basis
for the Euclidean topology on R. Indeed, if U ⊆R is open, then, by deﬁnition, for
each x ∈U there is an ε > 0 such that
x ∈Bε(x) ⊆U.
If X is an arbitrary set endowed with the indiscrete topology, then the collection {X}
is a basis: there are at most two open sets in the indiscrete topology, namely ∅and
X, so if U is open and x ∈U, then necessarily U = X and clearly
x ∈X ⊆X.
If X is endowed with the discrete topology, then the collection {{x} | x ∈X} of all
singleton subsets of X is a basis. Indeed, in the discrete topology every U ⊆X is
open, and if x ∈U, then clearly
x ∈{x} ⊆U.
Deﬁnition 3.9 A collection A of open sets in a topological space X is a subbasis
for the topology if the collection {A1 ∩· · · ∩Am | A1, . . . , Am ∈A, m ≥0} of all
ﬁnite intersections of elements of A is a basis for the topology.
Remark 3.5 By convention, the empty intersection (i.e., the case n = 0 above) is
interpreted to be the set X itself.
Example 3.8 Consider the set of real numbers R with the Euclidean topology. The
collection
{(a, ∞) | a ∈R} ∪{(−∞, b) | b ∈R}
of all open rays is a subbasis. Indeed, the open rays are open sets and since

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
105
Bε(a) = (a −ε, ∞) ∩(−∞, a + ε)
we see that the collection of all ﬁnite intersections of the open rays contains the
basis we presented above. It follows that the collection is a basis since, in general, if
B′ ⊇B are collections of open sets and B is a basis, then so is B′.
We now show that bases can be used directly to detect continuity of functions.
Proposition 3.7 Let f : X →Y be a function between topological spaces and let
B be a basis for the topology on Y. Then f is continuous if, and only if, f −1(B) is
open in X for all basis elements B ∈B.
Proof If f is continuous, then f −1(U) is open for all open sets U ⊆Y. Since any
B ∈B is in particular an open set in Y it follows that f −1(B) is open in X. In the
other direction, assume that f −1(B) is open for all B ∈B and let U be an arbitrary
open set in Y. It follows at once from the deﬁnition of basis that we may express U
as a union of basis elements
U =

x∈U
Bx.
It then holds that
f −1(U) =

x∈U
f −1(Bx)
and since each f −1(Bx) is assumed open, the set f −1(U) is thus expressed as a union
of open sets, and so is open. Thus f −1(U) is open for all open sets U in Y, namely
f is continuous.
□
We close this section by introducing a local variant of the notion of basis.
Deﬁnition 3.10 Let X be a topological space and x ∈X. A collection B of open
subsets of X is said to be a local basis at x if for all B ∈B
x ∈B
and if for every open set U in X with x ∈U there is an element Bx ∈B (called a
basis element) with
Bx ⊆U.
Every basis B for the topology on X clearly gives rise to the local basis
Bx = {B ∈B | x ∈B}
at x. It is also the case that if for every x ∈X one has a local basis Bx at x, then the
collection
B =

Subspaces, Point-Set Relationships, and Countability
Axioms
This section introduces geometric notions regarding various relationships between
a point and a set in a topological space. We also consider countability axioms and
study the consequences they entail for some of these notions.
3.2.1
Subspaces and Point-Set Relationships
Any subset of a topological space inherits a topology and thus one may speak of sub-
spaces, which we discuss ﬁrst. Next, various qualitative aspects of a given point and
a subset of a topological space are introduced and some basic results are established.
Deﬁnition 3.11 (Subspace Topology) Let (X, τX) be a topological space and Y ⊆X
a subset. The collection
τY = {U ∩Y | U ∈τX}

108
3
Topological Spaces
is a topology on Y called the subspace topology. The topological space (Y, τY) is
called a topological subspace of (X, τX), or simply a subspace if the topological
context is clear.
Proposition 3.8 The subspace topology on a subset Y of a topological space X is
the smallest topology on Y making the inclusion function i : Y →X continuous.
Proof Noticing that
i−1(U) = Y ∩U
for all U ⊆X one sees that the inclusion function i : Y →X is continuous precisely
if Y ∩U is open in Y whenever U ⊆X is open in X. This condition clearly holds for
the subspace topology τY on Y. Further, if τ is any topology on Y, then the condition
that i : Y →X is continuous with respect to the topologies τ on Y and τX on X
amounts to the condition
U ∈τX =⇒U ∩Y ∈τ
and thus τY ⊆τ. This establishes the the minimality claim of the subspace topology
τY.
□
Given a subset and a point in a topological space the open sets may be used to identify
the qualitative relative location of the point in relation to the set. This is the subject
of the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.12 Let S ⊆X be a subset of a topological space and x ∈X a point.
1. x is an interior point of S if there exists an open set U such that x ∈U ⊆S.
2. x is an exterior point of S if there exists an open set U such that x ∈U ⊆X \ S.
3. x is a boundary point of S if every open set U containing x intersects S as well
as X \ S non-trivially.
4. x is a cluster point or an accumulation point of S if every open set U containing
x intersects S \ {x} non-trivially.
5. x is an isolated point of S if {x} is an open set.
Example 3.9 Let us consider the space R with its Euclidean topology. It is easily
seen that for S = [a, b], a closed interval, as well as S = (a, b), an open interval:
1. a point x is interior precisely when a < x < b
2. a point x is exterior precisely when either x < a or x > b
3. a point x is a boundary point precisely when x = a or x = b
4. a point x is a cluster point precisely when a ≤x ≤b.
5. S has no isolated points, but the space X = [0, 1] ∪{2}, as a subspace of R with
the Euclidean topology, has the point x = 2 as its only isolated point.
Further, in R with the Euclidean topology, it is easy to see that every real number x
is a cluster point of the subset Q of rational numbers. In general, an isolated point
x is never a cluster point of any set S, simply since for the open set U = {x} one
always has U ∩(S \ {x}) = ∅.

3.2 Subspaces, Point-Set Relationships, and Countability Axioms
109
Deﬁnition 3.13 Let X be a topological space and S ⊆X a subset.
1. The interior of S is the set int(S) = {x ∈X | x is an interior point of S}.
2. The exterior of S is the set ext(S) = {x ∈X | x is an exterior point of S}.
3. The boundary of S is the set ∂(S) = {x ∈X | x is a boundary point of S}.
4. The derived set of S is the set S′ = {x ∈X | x is a cluster point of S}.
5. The closure of S is the set S = S ∪S′.
Proposition 3.9 Let X be a topological space and S ⊆X a subset. It then holds
that
1. The interior int(S) is the union of all open sets contained in S.
2. The exterior ext(S) is the union of all open sets disjoint from S.
3. The closure S is the intersection of all closed sets that contain S.
4. S = S ∪∂(S).
Proof 1. Let U be the set of all open sets U ⊆X with U ⊆S, and let
W =

U∈U
U
so we need to show that W = int(S). If x ∈W, then X ∈U for some U ∈U,
and since x ∈U ⊆S we may conclude that x ∈int(S). Conversely, if x ∈int(S),
then there exists an open set U such that x ∈U ⊆S, and thus x ∈W.
2. Notice that ext(S) = int(X \ S), and now apply 1.
3. Let F be the set of all closed sets F ⊆X with S ⊆F, and let
G =

F∈F
F
so we need to show that G = ¯S. Let x ∈G, and thus x ∈F for all F ∈F , and
our aim is to show that x ∈S. If x ∈S, then x ∈S ∪S′ = S so we may proceed
under the assumption that x /∈S. We will show that in this case x ∈S′. Indeed,
let U ⊆X be an open set with x ∈U and suppose that U ∩(S \ {x}) = ∅, which
simpliﬁes to U ∩S = ∅since x /∈S. But then the closed set F = X \ U contains
S,andthus x ∈F,contradictingthefactthat x ∈U.Intheotherdirection,suppose
that x ∈S = S ∪S′, and we aim to show that x ∈G, namely that x ∈F for every
closed set F with S ⊆F. If x ∈S, then clearly x ∈F, and we may thus proceed
under the assumption that x /∈S, and thus that x ∈S′. Consider the open set
U = X \ F and note that U ∩(S \ {x}) = U ∩S = ∅. If x /∈F, then x ∈U and
we obtain a contradiction with x ∈S′. It follows that x ∈F, as needed.
4. To show that S ⊆S ∪∂S suppose that x ∈¯S but x /∈S. Given an open set U
with x ∈U it follows that U ∩S ̸= ∅. Since x /∈S, namely x ∈X \ S, we also
have that x ∈U ∩(X \ S). In other words, any open set containing x contains
points from S as well as from X \ S, thus x is a boundary point of S. In the other
direction, suppose that x ∈S ∪∂S, and we need to show that x ∈S = S ∪S′.

110
3
Topological Spaces
If x ∈S, then clearly x ∈S so assume that x /∈S, and thus x ∈∂S. But then if
U is an open set containing x, then U contains a point from S (and from X \ S,
though this is irrelevant here), but then U ∩(S \ {x}) ̸= ∅since x /∈S. Thus x is
a cluster point, as needed.
□
Corollary 3.1 Let X be a topological space and S ⊆X a subset. Then
1. The interior int(S) is the largest open set in X that is contained in S. In particular,
int(S) is open.
2. S is open in X if, and only if, S = int(S). In other words, S is open precisely when
all its points are interior.
3. The exterior ext(S) is the largest open set in X that is disjoint from S. In particular,
ext(S) is open.
4. S is closed in X if, and only if, X \ S = ext(S).
5. The closure ¯S is the smallest closed set in X that contains S. In particular, ¯S is
closed.
6. S is closed in X if, and only if, S′ ⊆S (equivalently, if S = S).
3.2.2
Sequences and Convergence
We turn to look at sequences in topological spaces, what it means for such sequences
to converge, and how this notion relates to the topological point-set relationships
presented above.
Deﬁnition 3.14 Let {xm}m≥1 be a sequence of points in a topological space X. A
point x0 ∈X is said to be a limit of the sequence {xm}m≥1 if for every open set U ⊆X
with x0 ∈U there exists an N ∈N such that
m > N =⇒xm ∈U.
The sequence is then said to converge to x0 and to be a convergent sequence.
Just as continuity of functions can be detected using a basis, so can cluster points
and limit points be so detected.
Proposition 3.10 In a topological space X with a local basis B at a point x0:
1. x0 is a cluster point of a subset S ⊆X if, and only if, B ∩(S \ {x0}) ̸= ∅, for all
basis elements B ∈B.
2. A sequence {xm}m≥1 converges to x0 if, and only if, for every B ∈B there exists
an N ∈N such that
m > N =⇒xm ∈B.
Proof As the two proofs are very similar we only establish the ﬁrst claim. If x0 is a
cluster point and B ∈B is a basis element, then, in particular, B is open and x0 ∈B,

3.2 Subspaces, Point-Set Relationships, and Countability Axioms
111
implying B ∩(S \ {x0}) ̸= ∅. Conversely, suppose the stated condition holds and let
U be an arbitrary open set with x0 ∈U. By deﬁnition of basis at a point there exists a
basis element B ∈B with x0 ∈B ⊆U. By hypothesis then B ∩(S \ {x0}) ̸= ∅and
since U ∩(S \ {x0}) ⊇B ∩(S \ {x0}), the proof is complete.
□
Example 3.10 Consider the Euclidean topology on R and recall that a local basis
at x0 is given by {Bε(x0)}ε>0. Thus, a sequence {xm}m≥1 in R converges to x0 ∈R
if, and only if, for every ε > 0 there exists an N ∈N such that
m > N =⇒xm ∈Bε(x0).
In other words: if m > N, then |xm −x| < ε. We thus see that convergence in the
topological sense given above is equivalent to convergence of sequences in R in the
usual sense.
While it is reassuring that the notion of convergence can be captured topologically,
one should be cautious not to expect the familiar behaviour of limits in R to remain
valid in arbitrary topological spaces, as we illustrate.
Example 3.11 Let X be an arbitrary set endowed with the indiscrete topology. Since
the only open sets are ∅and X any sequence {xm}m≥1 in X converges and any element
x ∈X serves as its limit. Consequently, a sequence may converge to more than one
point; uniqueness of limits is lost.
Given a subset S of a topological space X we can entertain (at least) two reasonable
formalizations for the idea of the set of all points that are inﬁnitesimally close to S.
One possibility is given by the closure S = S ∪S′, where we adjoin to S all of its
derived points. A second possibility is obtained by considering the set of all limit
points of sequences in S. A-priori, it is not clear how these two possibilities compare.
We limit the discussion just to the point of developing enough theory to suit the needs
of this book. It should be noted that this is just the tip of the iceberg. The important
observation is that, generally, sequences do not sufﬁce to capture cluster points (but
either nets or ﬁlters do, two concepts we will not discuss). Having said that, we
do identify below a broad enough class of topological spaces in which the limit
behaviour is more intuitive.
Theorem 3.6 Let X be a topological space and S ⊆X a subset. If a non-eventually-
constant sequence {sm}m≥1 in S converges to x0 ∈X, then x0 is a cluster point of the
subset S.
Proof Suppose that U is an open set and x0 ∈U. Since {sm}m≥1 converges to x0
there exists an N ∈N such that sm ∈U for all m > N, and since the sequence is not
eventually constant an m > N exists with sm ̸= x0. In particular,U ∩(S \ {x0}) ̸= ∅,
and thus x0 is a cluster point of S .
□
Theorem 3.7 If f : X →Y is a continuous function between topological spaces
and xm →x0 in X, then f (xm) →f (x0) in Y.

112
3
Topological Spaces
Proof Given an open set U ⊆Y with f (x0) ∈U we have that x0 ∈f −1(U) and
thus there exists an N ∈N such that
m > N =⇒xm ∈f −1(U)
and thus
m > N =⇒f (xm) ∈U
as required.
□
Remark 3.6 The converses of these two theorems are generally false. To see that,
it sufﬁces to note that if X is an uncountable set endowed with the cocountable
topology, then the only convergent sequences are the eventually constant ones, while
every point x ∈X is a cluster point of any coﬁnite set S (i.e., one where where X \ S
is ﬁnite).
3.2.3
Second Countable and First Countable Spaces
We present two axioms out of a class of properties called countability axioms.
The conditions we present are quite strong and have pleasant consequences to the
behaviour of limit and cluster points. While many topological spaces fail to satisfy
either countability axiom, the class of those that do is broad enough to supply one
with plenty of topological spaces that are closer to one’s intuition than their wilder
topological cousins.
Deﬁnition 3.15 A topological space X satisﬁes the second axiom of countability or
is said to be second countable if there is a countable basis for the topology on X.
Thus, second countability means that there exist a countable index set I and a family
{Ui}i∈I of open sets in X such that any set U can be expressed as
U =

j∈JU
U j
for some JU ⊆I.
Example 3.12 The space R with the Euclidean topology is second countable. We
exhibit a countable basis for the topology, namely the collection
{B1/n(q)}q∈Q,n≥1.
Firstly, note that this is a countable collection as it is indexed by the set Q × (N \ {0}),
(see Sect. 1.2.13 of the Preliminaries). Next, given an open set U ⊆R and a point
x ∈U, there exists a δ > 0 such that Bδ(x) ⊆U, and let n ∈N satisfy 1/n < δ/2.
Since the rationals are dense in the reals, we may ﬁnd a rational number q for which

3.2 Subspaces, Point-Set Relationships, and Countability Axioms
113
|x −q| < 1/n. It now easily follows that x ∈B1/n(q) ⊆Bδ(x) ⊆U, as required by
the deﬁnition of basis.
Deﬁnition 3.16 A subset S ⊆X in a topological space is dense in X if S = X. The
space X is called separable if it contains a countable dense subset.
A familiar example of a separable topological space is R with the Euclidean
topology: the countable set Q is dense in R. In fact, R is seen to be separable by the
following general result.
Theorem 3.8 Every second countable space X is separable.
Proof Let B be a countable basis for the topology. For each B ∈B choose an arbi-
trary point xB ∈B (if B = ∅, simply skip it). The set S = {xB | B ∈B} is clearly
countable so it remains to show that it is dense. Indeed, ﬁx a point x ∈X. To show
that x is in the closure of S suppose x /∈S and let U be an open set with x ∈U. We
now need to show that U ∩S ̸= ∅. But, by deﬁnition, there exists a basis element B
with x ∈B ⊆U. Then xb must be found in U ∩S, establishing the claim.
□
Many spaces of interest are not second countable but they do satisfy a weaker con-
dition known as the ﬁrst axiom of countability. Such spaces still exhibit general
behaviour that in some respect is quite close to what our intuition about convergence
and closures in R dictates.
Deﬁnition 3.17 A topological space X satisﬁes the ﬁrst axiom of countability or is
said to be ﬁrst countable if there exists, at every point x ∈X, a countable local basis.
Evidently a second countable space is also ﬁrst countable.
Recall that the converses of Theorems 3.6 and 3.7 are not generally true in arbitrary
topological spaces. For ﬁrst countable spaces we have the following pleasing result.
Theorem 3.9 Let X be a ﬁrst countable space with, at each point x0 ∈X, a count-
able local basis Bx0 = {Bx0
m }m≥1 at x0.
1. For a subset S ⊆X, a point x0 ∈X is in S if, and only if, sm →x0 for a sequence
{sm}m≥1 in S.
2. A subset F ⊆X is closed if, and only if, F contains all limit points of sequences
in it.
3. A function f : X →Y to any topological space Y is continuous if, and only if, it
preserves limits of sequences, i.e.,
xm →x0 =⇒f (xm) →f (x0)
for all sequences {xm}m≥1 in X.
Proof 1. By Theorem 3.6 every limit point of a non-eventually constant sequence
in S is a cluster point of S, and thus is in S. The limits of eventually constant
sequences are, of course, in S and thus also in S. Suppose now that x0 ∈X is in S
and, of course, the interesting case is when x0 /∈S. In that case x0 is a cluster point

114

Topological Spaces
of S. Therefore, for every m ≥1 the open set Bx0
1 ∩· · · ∩Bx0
m intersects S \ {x0}
non-trivially, and let sm be an arbitrary element in the intersection. Clearly the
sequence {sm}m≥1 is in S and its limit is x0. Indeed, given any open set U ⊆X
with x0 ∈U, there exists a basis element Bx0
N with x0 ∈Bx0
N ⊆U. But then
m > N =⇒sm ∈Bx0
m ⊆Bx0
N ⊆U.
2. By Corollary 3.1, F is closed if, and only if, F = F, and we just proved that the
elements of F coincide with limit points of sequences in F.
3. ByTheorem3.7,if f : X →Y iscontinuous,thenitpreserveslimitsofsequences.
Suppose thus that f : X →Y preserves limits of sequences, and our aim is to
show that f is continuous. We need to show that f −1(U) is open whenever U ⊆Y
is open, or (equivalently!) that f −1(F) is closed whenever F ⊆Y is closed. It
sufﬁces to show that f −1(F) contains its limit points, so suppose that
xm →x0
in X with {xm}m≥1 a sequence in f −1(F). We show that x0 ∈f −1(F): since f
preserves limits of sequences we have f (xm) →f (x0), but then f (x0) is a limit
point of a sequence in F and since the latter is closed, Theorem 3.6 implies that
f (x0) ∈F, showing that x0 ∈f −1(F).

3.3
Constructing Topologies
In this section we discuss two ways of constructing topologies. The ﬁrst situation is
where one has an arbitrary set and a collection of subsets of it that one would like to
have as the open sets in a topology on X. The second scenario concerns a collection
of functions one would like to force to be continuous. This construction is used to
obtain the product, coproduct, and quotient constructions for topological spaces.

3.3.1
Generating Topologies
As with the Euclidean topology on R it is often convenient to have a manageable
basis for a topology since one can effectively work with the basis elements rather than
the entire topology. Given an arbitrary set X, without any prior notion of topology,
and a collection B of subsets of X it is natural to ask whether there exists a topology
τ on X for which B is a basis, and, if such a topology exists, is it unique. The answers
are quite decisive.
Theorem 3.10 (Basis Generating Topology) A collection B of subsets of a set X is
a basis for a topology τ on X if, and only if, the following conditions are met.
1. For every x ∈X there exists a B ∈B such that x ∈B. Equivalently,
X =

B∈B
B.
2. For all B1, B2 ∈B, if x ∈B1 ∩B2, then there exists B3 ∈B such that
x ∈B3 ⊆B1 ∩B2.
Moreover, when the conditions are met, the topology τ is unique, namely τ is the
smallest topology on X such that every B ∈B is open.
Proof Declare U ⊆X open if for every x ∈U there exists a B ∈B such that
x ∈B ⊆U.
Equivalently, U ⊆X is open if U is a union of elements from B. We show that
the collection τ of all such open sets forms a topology on X. The empty set ∅is
vacuously open since it has no points, and the set X itself is open by condition 1.
Stability under arbitrary unions is straightforward, so let us establish stability under
ﬁniteintersections.LetU1,U2 ⊆X beopenandweneedtoshowthatU = U1 ∩U2 is
open.Indeed,if x ∈U,then x ∈U1 andthusthereisa B1 ∈Bsuchthat x ∈B1 ⊆U1.
Similarly, there is a B2 ∈B with x ∈B2 ⊆U2. As x ∈B1 ∩B2, condition 2 gives
us an element B3 ∈B with
x ∈B3 ⊆B1 ∩B2 ⊆U1 ∩U2 = U,
as needed.
The claim that B is a basis for τ is immediate from the construction. As for the
minimality claim about τ, note that if τ ′ is any topology on X for which all B ∈B
are open, then any U ∈τ, being a union of elements from B, must also be open in
τ ′. In other words, τ ⊆τ ′. So, as claimed, among all topologies where each B ∈B
is open, τ is the smallest one.

We may now pose the exact same question as above, replacing basis by subbasis.
Thus, given an arbitrary collection B of subsets of X, is there a topology τ on X for
which B is a subbasis, and is this topology unique.
Theorem 3.11 (Subbasis Generating Topology) A collection B of subsets of a set
X is a subbasis for a topology τ on X if, and only if,

B∈B
B = X.
Moreover, in that case the topology τ is unique, namely τ is the smallest topology
on X such that every B ∈B is open.
Proof One may reduce the proof to that of the previous result by noting that the
collection
B′ = {B1 ∩· · · ∩Bm | B1, . . . , Bm ∈B, m ≥0},
consisting of all ﬁnite intersections of elements of B, satisﬁes the conditions of being
a basis for a topology. In other words, we declare a subset U ⊆X to be open if it is
an arbitrary union of ﬁnite intersections of elements from B. The details are left to
the reader.
□
These are powerful topology generating tools. Any topology constructed from a
collection B by the above techniques is said to be generated by B.
Shifting attention from subsets to functions, the next result states, roughly, that
given any collection of functions with a common domain or codomain, a canonical
topology exists rendering all the given functions continuous. We remark that, in a
sense, topological spaces exist as the servants of continuous functions; we deﬁne
topological spaces since we are interested in continuous mappings. This result thus
allows one to tailor a suitable topology from a given collection of functions.
Proposition 3.11 (Topologies Induced by Functions) Let X be a set and {Xi}i∈I a
non-empty collection of topological spaces.
1. Given functions { fi : X →Xi}i∈I there exists a unique smallest topology on X
such that every fi : X →Xi is continuous.
2. Given functions { fi : Xi →X}i∈I there exists a unique largest topology on X
such that every fi : Xi →X is continuous.
Proof 1. Suppose that τ is a topology on X such that each fi : X →Xi is con-
tinuous. That means that f −1
i
(U) ∈τ for each U ∈τXi. In other words τ ⊇B
where
B = { f −1
i
(U) | i ∈I ,U ∈τXi}
and so we see that we must deﬁne τ to be the topology generated by B. This is
feasible since B is easily seen to satisfy the condition of Theorem 3.11.

Topological Spaces
2. Suppose that τ is a topology on X such that each fi : Xi →X is continuous. That
means that τ cannot contain any subset S ⊆X for which there exists an i ∈I
with f −1
i
(S) /∈τXi. So, to obtain the largest possible topology on X, we consider
the collection
τ = {S ⊆X | f −1
i
(S) ∈τXi for all i ∈I}.
Showing that τ is a topology would complete the proof. Notice that
τ =

i∈I
{S ⊆X | f −1
i
(S) ∈τXi}
and that (the reader is invited to prove) the intersection of a family of topologies on
X is again a topology on X. Thus we only need to establish that the collection {S ⊆
X | f −1
i
(S) ∈τXi}, for a single i ∈I, is a topology. This follows immediately
from well-known properties of the inverse image function, as the reader may
verify.
□
When a topology τ is constructed as above we say that it is generated by the given
collection of functions. We note that it is quite possible that the collection of functions
consists of just one single function. We already saw such a situation: the subspace
topology on a subset Y of a topological space X is precisely the topology generated
by the inclusion function i : Y →X.
3.3.2
Coproducts, Products, and Quotients
The constructions above are utilized in in three particular scenarios.
Deﬁnition 3.18 Let X and Y be topological spaces and assume X ∩Y = ∅. The
topology on X ∪Y generated by {iX : X →X ∪Y, iY : Y →X ∪Y}, where iX and
iY are the inclusion functions, is called the coproduct topology on X ∪Y, and the
space X ∪Y is called the coproduct of X and Y.
Examples are abundant, but some care is required in order to hone the intuition. For
instance, in R with the Euclidean topology, the subspaces Q and R \ Q are disjoint
and while obviously their union recovers the ambient space R, the coproduct topology
on R is not the Euclidean one.
The situation generalizes to inﬁnitely many spaces. Suppose {Xi}i∈I is a non-
empty collection of topological spaces that are pair-wise disjoint. The coproduct of
all the Xi is then the set
X =

i∈I
Xi
endowed with the topology generated by the family of inclusions {Xi →X}i∈I. As
an example, a topological space X is discrete if, and only if, it is the coproduct of its
singleton subspaces.

3.3 Constructing Topologies
119
Deﬁnition 3.19 Let X and Y be two topological spaces, and consider the cartesian
product X × Y. The topology generated by the set of projections
{πX : X × Y →X, πY : X × Y →Y}
is called the product topology on X × Y, and the space X × Y is called the cartesian
product or simply the product of X and Y.
This situation naturally extends to the inﬁnite case. If {Xi}i∈I is a non-empty family
of topological spaces, then their cartesian product is the set X, the set-theoretic
cartesian product of the Xi, endowed with the topology generated by the family of
projections {πi : X →Xi}i∈I.
Let us consider the case of a product of countably many spaces {Xm}m≥1. The
set-theoretic cartesian product X = X1 × · · · × Xm × · · · consists of all sequences
x = (x1, . . . , xm, . . .) with xm ∈Xm for each m ≥1. The projection πm : X →Xm
is given by πm(x) = xm. Following the deﬁnitions above it follows that the product
topology on X is the one generated by the sets of the form U1 × · · · × Um × · · ·
where each Um is an open set in Xm and Um = Xm for all but ﬁnitely many m.
Example 3.13 A familiar example is Rn, the n-fold product of the topological space
R with itself, when given the Euclidean topology. For n ≥2 the resulting product
topology on Rn is also called the Euclidean topology. Another example is R∞as a
countable product of R with itself.
The ﬁnal construction we present is that of the quotient topology. Let X be a set with
an equivalence relation on it. Recall (e.g., Sect. 1.2.15 of the Preliminaries) that there
is then the associated quotient set X/∼= {[x] | x ∈X} of all equivalence classes
[x], and the canonical projection π : X →X/∼given by π(x) = [x]. When this
situation is enriched by the presence of a topology on X, it is natural to seek out a
topology on X/∼as well. With the tools we now have the path to take is clear.
Deﬁnition 3.20 Let X be a topological space and ∼an equivalence relation on the
set X. The topology on X/∼generated by the projection function π : X →X/∼is
called the quotient topology on X/∼, and the space X/∼is called the quotient of X
modulo ∼.
Example 3.14 Consider [0, 1] as a subspace of R with its standard topology. Deﬁne
the equivalence relation ∼on [0, 1] by x ∼y when either x = y or x, y ∈{0, 1}.
Informally, ∼glues the two ends of the interval [0, 1], resulting in a circle. More
precisely, it can be shown that the quotient space [0, 1]/∼is homeomorphic to a
circle in R2 with the Euclidean topology.

3.4
Separation and Connectedness
Separation properties of a topological space relate to the ability of the open sets to
separate distinct points, a point from a set, or two disjoint sets. We only consider
one such property, the Hausdorff separation property, which is the strongest of the
separation axioms pertaining to the ability to separate distinct points. We then turn
our attention to the notion of connectedness; a notion that is somewhat more subtle
than one might initially expect.
3.4.1
The Hausdorff Separation Property
If X is endowed with the indiscrete topology, then the open sets (of which there are
only two) are, in a sense, blind to the individual points in the space. The open sets
are not sufﬁciently reﬁned to distinguish between different points. This is an extreme
situation of course and it goes against one’s intuition of how distinct points should
(in some sense) behave. The following separation property restores some intuition.
Deﬁnition 3.21 A topological space X is said to satisfy the Hausdorff separation
property, or simply to be Hausdorff , if for all distinct points x, y ∈X there exist
disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈U and y ∈V . Such open sets are said to
separate x and y.
Remark 3.7 The Hausdorff separation property is commonly referred to as T2, indi-
cating its position in a hierarchy of several separation axioms. We will not delve into
this issue here.
Example 3.15 R with the Euclidean topology is Hausdorff. Indeed, if x ̸= y are
real numbers, then setting
δ = |x −y|
2
> 0
one easily sees that
Bδ(x) ∩Bδ(y) = ∅
thus exhibiting open sets that separate x and y.

3.4 Separation and Connectedness
123
Example 3.16 An example of a non-Hausdorff space is given by the Sierpi´nski
space S = {0, 1}. Its two points clearly can not be separated since the topology is
given by {∅, {1}, {0, 1}}. In fact, a ﬁnite topological space X is Hausdorff if, and only
if, it is discrete. Indeed any discrete space is clearly Hausdorff since any two distinct
points x and y are separated by the open sets {x} and {y}. In the other direction,
suppose X is ﬁnite and Hausdorff, and choose some x ∈X. For each y ∈X \ {x}
we may ﬁnd disjoint open sets Uy and Vy such that x ∈Uy and y ∈Vy. Then, the
intersection
U =

y∈X\{x}
Uy
is an open set (this is where the ﬁniteness assumption on X is used) and it contains
x. Further, since U ⊆Uy, it follows that
U ∩Vy ⊆Uy ∩Vy = ∅
and thus U is an open set that contains x but does not contain any y ∈X \ {x}.
In other words, U = {x}, and thus we proved that {x} is an open set. Since x was
arbitrary, it follows that X is discrete.
One immediate consequence of the Hausdorff property is the following result.
Theorem 3.12 A convergent sequence {xm}m≥1 in a Hausdorff space X converges
to a unique limit.
Proof Suppose that {xm}m≥1 converges to two different points x and y. There exist,
by the Hausdorff property, two disjoint open sets Ux and Uy with x ∈Ux and y ∈Yy.
By Deﬁnition 3.14, there exist Nx, Ny ∈N such that
m > Nx =⇒xm ∈Ux
and m > Ny =⇒xm ∈Uy.
But then, for m > max{Nx, Ny}, we have that xm ∈Ux ∩Uy, a contradiction since
Ux and Uy are disjoint.
□
3.4.2
Path-Connected and Connected Spaces
The second property we discuss is that of connectedness which, to immediately
dispel any misconception, is not opposing the Hausdorff separation property (or any
other separation property). There are two notions to discuss—path connectivity and
connectivity—the former more immediately intuitive than the latter, and thus is the
one we present ﬁrst.
Deﬁnition 3.22 A space X is said to be path-connected if for all points x, y ∈X
there exists a continuous function γ : [0, 1] →X with γ (0) = x and γ (1) = y.

124
3
Topological Spaces
Here the topology given to the interval [0, 1] is the subspace topology induced by the
Euclidean topology on R. A continuous function γ : [0, 1] →X is naturally thought
of as a path in X with initial point γ (0) and ﬁnal destination γ (1). Thus, X is path-
connected if any two points in the space can be connected by a path in the space.
Example 3.17 The space Rn, the n-fold product of R with the Euclidean topol-
ogy, is path-connected for all n ≥1. Indeed, given points x = (x1, . . . , xn) and
y = (y1, . . . , yn), it is easily veriﬁed that γ : [0, 1] →Rn given by
γ (t) = t(y1, . . . , yn) + (1 −t)(x1, . . . , xn)
is a path connecting x and y. The same argument shows that any subset of Rn of the
form
[a1, b1] × · · · × [an, bn],
a product of intervals, is path-connected. In particular, any interval [a, b] in R is path-
connected. More generally, any convex subset of Rn is path-connected. The reader is
invited to verify that another example of a connected space is S = {x ∈Rn | ∥x∥=
1}, the unit sphere, viewed as a subspace of Rn with the Euclidean topology, provided
that n > 1.
An example of a space that is not path-connected is Q as a subspace of R with
the Euclidean topology. In fact, no two distinct points x, y ∈Q can be connected
by a path. To see that, one can show that any path γ : [0, 1] →Q is constant. How-
ever, we establish the same result through the more general notion of topological
connectedness.
Deﬁnition 3.23 A topological space X is said to be disconnected if there exist non-
empty open sets U and V such that U ∩V = ∅and U ∪V = X. A space X is said
to be connected if it is not disconnected.
Theorem 3.13 Any closed interval [a, b], as a subspace of R with the Euclidean
topology, is connected.
Proof Without loss of generality let us assume that [a, b] = [0, 1]. Suppose that
[0, 1] is not connected. Then there exist non-empty open subsets U and V in the
subspace topology such that U ∪V = [a, b] and U ∩V = ∅. Since a singleton set
is not open in the subspace topology on [0, 1] it follows that not U nor V is a
singleton set. In particular, we may assume that there exist a ∈U and b ∈V with
0 < a < b < 1. The set S = {x ∈U | x < b} is non-empty and bounded above, and
so admits a supremum s, and notice that 0 < s < 1.
Now, since [0, 1] = U ∪V we must have that either s ∈U or s ∈V . If s ∈U
then s < b and, U being open, there exists an a′ ∈U with s < a′ < b, contrary
to the choice of s. On the other hand, if s ∈V then, V being open, there exist an
ε > 0 with (s −ε, s + ε) ⊆V , again contrary to the choice of s. The assumption
of the existence of U and V as above thus leads to a contradiction, and so [0, 1] is
connected.
□

3.4 Separation and Connectedness
125
Remark 3.8 The intuition behind the concept of connectedness is perhaps better
explained by referring to the word ‘samenhangend’, the term used for this property
in the Dutch language. The literal meaning of ‘samenhangend’ is ‘hanging together’,
and it is this topological quality that the deﬁnition of connectedness captures. For
instance, it is intuitively clear that if a space is path-connected, then it must be
‘hanging together’. This is indeed the case.
Lemma 3.1 If a topological space X is path-connected, then it is connected.
Proof Suppose that X is disconnected. That means that there exist disjoint non-
empty open sets U, V ⊆X such that
U ∪V = X.
Choose points x ∈U and y ∈V and, utilizing the assumption that the space X is
path-connected, let γ : [0, 1] →X be a path from x to y. Since γ is continuous, it
follows that γ −1(U) and γ −1(V ) are open sets in [0, 1]. Further,
γ −1(U) ∩γ −1(V ) = γ −1(U ∩V ) = γ −1(∅) = ∅
and
γ −1(U) ∪γ −1(V ) = γ −1(U ∪V ) = γ −1(X) = [0, 1].
Lastly, since x = γ (0) and x ∈U it follows that 0 ∈γ −1(U), and in particular
γ −1(U) ̸= ∅. Similarly one shows that γ −1(V ) ̸= ∅.
The conclusion is thus that γ −1(U) and γ −1(V ) separate [0, 1]. But [0, 1] is
connected and thus so is X.
□
Example 3.18 We return to the example of Q and show that it is disconnected,
and thus also not path-connected. Indeed, let α be an arbitrary irrational number
and let U = {x ∈Q | x < α} and V = {x ∈Q | x > α}. Clearly, U ∩V = ∅and
U ∪V = Q, and thus all that is left to show is that U and V are open. Indeed, given
any x ∈U, setting δ = α−x
2 , one easily sees that (x −δ, x + δ) ∩Q ⊆U. But this
shows that U is open in the subspace topology on Q, as required. The claim that V ,
too, is open follows similarly.
Theorem 3.14 If f : X →Y is a surjective continuous mapping between topolog-
ical spaces and X is connected, then so is Y.
Proof Suppose that Y is disconnected, namely that Y = U ∪V for some non-empty
open sets U, V ⊆Y which further satisfy U ∩V = ∅. Note that
X = f −1(Y) = f −1(U) ∪f −1(V )
and that both f −1(U) and f −1(V ) are open in X. Further,
f −1(U) ∩f −1(V ) = f −1(U ∩V ) = f −1(∅) = ∅.

126

Topological Spaces
Since X is connected, we may conclude that either f −1(U) or f −1(V ) is empty. But,
since f is surjective, that is impossible and so Y must be connected.

ing for the mentioned results is topological: the sets are compact. The aim of this
section is to present the notion of compactness and prove several results leading to
the characterization of the closed and bounded subsets of R (under the Euclidean
topology) as precisely the compact sets. The section concludes with the statement of
the important result, known as Tychonoff’s Theorem, that the product of any family
of compact topological spaces is itself compact.
Deﬁnition 3.24 Let X be a topological space and C ⊆X a subset. An open covering
of C is a collection {Ui}i∈I of open sets whose union contains the entire set C, i.e.,
C ⊆

i∈I
Ui.
The set C is said to be compact if given any open covering {Ui}i∈I of C, there exists
a ﬁnite subcovering of C. That is, there exists ﬁnitely many sets Ui1, . . . ,Uim from
the given covering such that
C ⊆Ui1 ∪· · · ∩Uim.
Notice that C may coincide with the set X, so we may speak of the space X itself
being compact.
Example 3.19 Any ﬁnite set C in any topological space is compact. This is clear
since any open covering of a ﬁnite set must admit a ﬁnite subcovering, using at most
as many open sets from the covering as there are points in C.
Example 3.20 Any unbounded set Y ⊆R, when R is given the Euclidean topology,
is not compact. To see that, consider the open covering
Y ⊆
∞

k=1
(−k, k).
Clearly, no ﬁnite subcovering sufﬁces to cover Y precisely because Y was chosen to
be unbounded. In other words, any compact set in R must be bounded. Similarly, an
open interval (a, b) is not compact in R either, since the open covering
(a, b) ⊆
∞

k=1

a + 1
k , ∞
	
admits no ﬁnite subcovering of (a, b), as is easy to verify.
Example 3.21 For any set X, if X is endowed with the indiscrete topology, then
there are only two open sets (or sometimes less) in existence and so every subset

3.5 Compactness
129
C ⊆X is certainly compact. If, however, X is given the discrete topology, then every
singleton set {x} is open, and thus any subset C ⊆X admits the open covering
C =

x∈C
{x}
and thus is compact if, and only if, C is ﬁnite.
The next example is important enough to be stated as a theorem.
Theorem 3.15 A closed interval [a, b] in R with the Euclidean topology is compact.
Proof Suppose that an open covering {Ui}i∈I of [a, b] is given. Our goal is to ﬁnd a
ﬁnite subcovering. Deﬁne the set S of all a ≤s ≤b for which a ﬁnite subcovering
of [a, s] exists. The goal is reduced to showing that b ∈S. Now, since [a, a] = {a}
can certainly be covered by just one element from the given covering, it follows that
a ∈S and thus S is not empty. By deﬁnition, S is bounded and thus has a supremum
t ≤b. We proceed to show that t ∈S. Take any Ui0 from the given covering for
which t ∈Ui0. As Ui0 is open, we have
t ∈(t −ε, t + ε) ⊆Ui0
for some ε > 0, and since t −ε < t it follows that t −ε ∈S. There is then a ﬁnite
subcovering of [a, t −ε], and by adjoining Ui0 to it we obtain a ﬁnite subcovering
of [a, t], so indeed t ∈S. Now, t is the supremum of S and so, for all δ > 0 with
t + δ < b no ﬁnite subcovering of [a, t + δ] exists. However, we already have a
ﬁnite covering of [a,t] by open sets and any such covering also covers [a, t + δ] for
some δ > 0. If it was the case that t < b, then such a delta can be chosen to satisfy
t + δ < b, leading to a contradiction. The conclusion is that b = t ∈S, which was
the goal.
□
Not all closed subsets of R are compact. For instance, [a, ∞), being unbounded,
is not compact. However, if the ambient space itself is compact, then closed subsets
are compact.
Lemma 3.2 A closed subset C of a compact space X is compact.
Proof Given an open covering of C simply note that adding to it the set X \ C, which
is open since C is assumed closed, yields an open covering of X. But X is compact
so a ﬁnite subcovering of X exists and discarding X \ C from it if necessary yields
a ﬁnite subcovering of C, as required.
□
The following example of a compact subset that is not closed shows that the
converse of the lemma need not be true.
Example 3.22 Let X be an arbitrary set and consider the coﬁnite topology on it.
The open sets (other than ∅) are those whose complements are ﬁnite, and thus we

130
3
Topological Spaces
may identify the closed sets (other than X itself) as precisely the ﬁnite subsets. We
now show that any subset C ⊆X is compact. Suppose an open covering {Ui}i∈I of
C is given. To extract a ﬁnite subcovering consider any non-empty member Ui of the
covering, and note that since it is open it misses at most ﬁnitely many of the elements
of C. Thus only ﬁnitely many other open sets from the given covering are required
to cover C, and thus a ﬁnite subcovering exists. In particular, if X is inﬁnite, then
not every compact subset of it is closed.
The next result shows the crucial obstacle in this example is that the ambient space
is not Hausdorff.
Proposition 3.12 A compact subset C of a Hausdorff space X is closed.
Proof If C = X, then C is closed, so we may assume X \ C is not empty as we
proceed to show that it is open. Let x0 ∈X \ C be an arbitrary point. For every
y ∈C, using the Hausdorff assumption on X, there exist disjoint open sets Uy and
Vy such that x0 ∈Uy and y ∈Vy. Clearly, the collection {Vy}y∈C is an open covering
of C, and since C is compact there exists a ﬁnite subcovering Vy1, . . . , Vyk such that
C ⊆Vy1 ∪· · · ∪Vyk.
Let
U = Uy1 ∩· · · ∩Uyk
and note that U is open, that x0 ∈U, and that U ⊆X \ C. In other words, x0 is an
interior point of X \ C and since x0 was an arbitrary point, every point of X \ C is
interior, and thus, by Corollary 3.1, X \ C is open.
□
We can now characterize the compact subsets of R.
Theorem 3.16 (Heine-Borel) With respect to the Euclidean topology on R a subset
C ⊆R is compact if, and only if, C is closed and bounded.
Proof Assume that C ⊆R is a compact subset. Since R is Hausdorff it follows by
Proposition 3.12 that C is closed while the fact that C must be bounded was already
noted in Example 3.20. In the other direction, if C is bounded, then it is contained
in some closed interval [a, b] which, by Theorem 3.15, is a compact set. If C is also
closed, then it is a closed subset of the compact set [a, b] and thus, by Lemma 3.2,
is itself compact.
□
The next result is a generalization of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.
Theorem 3.17 An inﬁnite subset S of a compact topological space X has a cluster
point in X.
Proof Suppose that S does not have any cluster points in X. That means that for
every x ∈X there exists an open set Ux with x ∈Ux and such that Ux ∩S is either
empty or the set {x}. Clearly, {Ux}x∈X is an open cover of X and thus admits a ﬁnite
subcover, say Ux1, . . . ,Uxn. Since

3.5 Compactness
131
S ⊆Ux1 ∪· · · ∪Uxn
and as Uxi ∩S contains at most one element, we conclude that |S| ≤n, so S is ﬁnite.
Consequently, an inﬁnite set S has at least one cluster point.
□
We end this section be mentioning the following important result.
Theorem 3.18 (Tychonoff Theorem) The product of any number (ﬁnite or inﬁnite)
of compact topological spaces is compact.
The proof of this result is slightly beyond the scope of this book.

Chapter 4
Metric Spaces
Metric spaces were introduced by Maurice Fréchet in 1906 in his Ph.D. dissertation
devoted to functional analysis. The axioms given by Fréchet (almost identical to the
ones we give below) form an abstraction of the notion of distance thus allowing for a
uniﬁed treatment of numerous particular cases under a single formalism. The ubiquity
of metric spaces in Mathematics and Physics is overwhelming but, naturally, this
chapter is mainly concerned with examples and results most relevant in the context
of this book.
Section 4.1 contains the deﬁnition of metric space and explores some examples,
primarily of normed spaces as metric spaces. Section 4.2 is concerned with the topol-
ogy induced by the distance function, the associated concept of convergence, and
basic topological observations. Section 4.3 considers two types of structure preser-
vation for mappings between metric spaces: non-expanding mappings and uniformly
continuous ones. Section 4.4 is concerned with the concept of completeness in metric
spaces, the Banach Fixed Point Theorem and Baire’s Theorem, and Cantor’s met-
ric completion process by means of Cauchy sequences. Finally, Sect. 4.5 examines
compactness for metric spaces and establishes the fact that a metric space is compact
precisely when it is complete and totally bounded.
4.1
Metric Spaces—Deﬁnition and Examples
Our intuitive understanding of the behaviour of distance, in the plane for instance, is
clearly represented in the deﬁnition of metric space that we give below. Of particular
importance is the simple fact that any normed space has a natural metric structure
associated with it (though many metric spaces certainly do not arise in this manner).
Consequently, the normed spaces from Chap. 2 are all revisited here through a metric
lens.

Metric Spaces
Before we proceed with the deﬁnition and a list of examples we note that for the
general study of metric spaces there are technical advantages in allowing inﬁnite
distance between points. We thus ﬁrst adjoin the symbol ∞as an extended real
numberanddenotebyR+ = {x ∈R | x ≥0} ∪{∞}thesetofextendednon-negative
real numbers.
Remark 4.1 We accept that x < ∞for all real x (and we also accept that ∞≤∞).
Addition is extended to include ∞by setting x + ∞= ∞+ x = ∞for all extended
real x ≥0.
Deﬁnition 4.1 Let X be a set. A function d : X × X →R+ is said to be a metric
or a distance function on X if the properties:
Distance is symmetric:
d(x, y) = d(y, x)
The triangle inequality:
d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z)
Distance separates points: d(x, y) = 0 ⇐⇒x = y
are satisﬁed for all x, y, z ∈X. The pair (X, d) is then called a metric space and
d(x, y) the distance between x and y. Quite often we refer to the metric space X
without explicitly mentioning the distance function d. Moreover, when two (or more)
metric spaces are considered we often overload the symbol d to stand for the metric
function in each space, relying on semantics to resolve any confusion. If needed, we
refer to the metric function of X by dX.
Remark 4.2 There is signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in the choice of axioms above, giving
rise to several structures that may resemble metric spaces to varying degrees. For
instance it is possible that d(x, y) = ∞, that is we allow the distance between points
to be inﬁnity. Some authors do not permit the distance function to attain the value ∞.
The difference between these two possibilities is largely cosmetic. It is also possible
to replace the separation condition by the demand that d(x, x) = 0, giving rise to
what are known as semimetric spaces, and again, their theory is quite similar to that
of metric spaces. However, if one neglects symmetry, giving rise to what are known
as quasimetric spaces, the resulting theory is in many respects strikingly different.
Observing that the metric space axioms are universally quantiﬁed it follows at once
that if S ⊆X is a subset of a metric space X, then the restriction of the distance
function d : X × X →R+ to the subset S × S is a distance function on S.
Deﬁnition 4.2 (Metric Subspace) For a subset S of a metric space X the pair (S, dS),
where dS is the restriction of d to S × S, is called a metric subspace of X (or simply
subspace if the metric context is clear).
There are various ways for a function f between metric spaces to interact with the
metric structures, namely to preserve the distances to various degrees. Here is the
strictest option.
Deﬁnition 4.3 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is an isometry if

4.1 Metric Spaces—Deﬁnition and Examples
137
d( f (x1), f (x2)) = d(x1, x2)
for all x1, x2 ∈X. If f is also bijective, then f is said to be an isometric isomorphism
or a global isometry. If there exists an isometric isomorphism between X and Y, then
we write X ∼= Y and say that X and Y are isometric.
A property of metric spaces is a metric invariant if whenever it holds for a metric
space X it also holds for any other metric space isometric to X.
The following theorem is a rich source of metric spaces.
Theorem 4.1 If V is a normed space, then deﬁning d : V × V →R+ by
d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥
endows V with the structure of a metric space.
Proof Note ﬁrst that the codomain of d is indeed R+ since the norm is always non-
negative (in this case ∞is never attained as the distance between points). For all
vectors x, y, z ∈V , symmetry follows by
d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥= ∥(−1) · (y −x)∥= | −1| · ∥y −x∥= ∥y −x∥= d(y, x),
while separation and the triangle inequality are just restatements of the conditions
of positivity and the triangle inequality in the deﬁnition of normed space (refer to
Deﬁnition 2.15, and with the aid of Proposition 2.13).

where we may immediately note that Cn is isometric to R2n with the Euclidean
metric, a global isometry f : Cn →R2n is given by
f (x1 + i · y1, . . . , xn + i · yn) = (x1, y1, x2, y2, . . . , xn, yn).
For all 1 ≤p < ∞, every pre-L p space, say of continuous real-valued functions on
the closed interval [a, b], is a metric space of functions with distance

In particular, C([a, b], R) supports inﬁnitely many different metric space structures,
one for each 1 ≤p < ∞. The case p = ∞, i.e., with the L∞norm, gives rise to yet
another distance function, namely
d(x, y) = max
a≤t≤b |x(t) −y(t)|.
Similarly, the space C(I, C) of continuous complex-valued functions on a closed
interval I = [a, b] supports an entire family of metric space structures. For each
1 ≤p < ∞the space ℓp of absolutely p-power summable sequences of either real
or complex numbers with distance given by

of bounded sequences with distance given by
d(x, y) = sup
k≥1
|xk −yk|
is a metric space as well.
Rn and Cn support other metric structures, different than those presented above, as
the following example shows.
Example 4.2 If we consider Rn as a subset of ℓp, with 1 ≤p ≤∞, by identifying
x = (x1, . . . , xn) with (x1, . . . , xn, 0, 0, 0, · · · ), then Rn inherits the metric of ℓp and
becomes a metric subspace of ℓp. In more detail, if p = ∞then
d(x, y) = max
1≤k≤n |xk −yk|
and
d(x, y) =
 n

k=1
|xk −yk|p
1/p
for 1 ≤p < ∞. If n > 1 and p ̸= 2, then each of these metrics is different than the
Euclidean metric. A similar observation gives rise to metric structures on Cn.
The following examples illustrate the subtleties that may arise with general metric
spaces.
Example 4.3 Consider R2 with the Euclidean metric, i.e., the plane with its ordinary
Euclidean metric structure. The unit circle S = {x ∈R2 | ∥x∥= 1} has two natural

4.1 Metric Spaces—Deﬁnition and Examples
139
metric structures on it. As a subspace of R2 the distance between two antipodal
points in S is 2 (the length of the shortest straight line connecting the two points
where the line is allowed to pass freely in the ambient space R2). On the other
hand, it is possible to endow the unit circle S with the so called intrinsic metric, the
one where the distance between two points is the length of the shorter of the two
arcs connecting them. With that metric the distance between antipodal points is π
(the length of a shortest geodesic connecting the two points, i.e, a “straight” line
connecting the points where the line is not allowed to step outside of S and into the
ambient space).
Other scenarios, perhaps more abstract, are also possible. For instance, given any
set X, deﬁning d(x, x) = 0 for all x ∈X and d(x, y) = 1 for all x, y ∈X with
x ̸= y turns X into a metric space. In this metric space the distances between any
two distinct points is 1. Thus, if X is inﬁnite, then X is not isometric to any subspace
of the Euclidean space Rn, for any n ≥1. Notice however that deﬁning d(x, y) = 0
for all x, y ∈X fails to be a metric space (unless X has at most one element) since
separation fails. It is however easily seen to be an example of a semimetric space.
Example 4.4 The set R+ can be given the metric structure
d(x, y) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
|x −y| if x ̸= ∞̸= y

otherwise.
The metric axioms are easily veriﬁed. In fact, we will simply write d(x, y) = |x −y|
since the algebraic properties of this metric signiﬁcantly resemble those of |x −y|
for real x, y.
Finally, we present one of many ways to endow the cartesian product X × Y of two
metric spaces with a metric structure.
Deﬁnition 4.4 (TheAdditiveMetricProduct)Formetricspaces X andY thefunction
d : (X × Y) × (X × Y) →R+ given by
d((x, y), (x′, y′)) = dX(x, x′) + dY(y, y′)
is easily seen to be a distance function (as the reader may verify) and the metric space
(X × Y, d) is called the additive metric product of X and Y.

Topology and Convergence in a Metric Space
This section is concerned with the topological structure of a metric space. Every met-
ric space has a topology associated with it that is determined by the distance function.

Metric Spaces
A metric space is thus automatically a topological space and thus all of the concepts
of topological spaces, including convergence, are meaningful in a metric space. After
describing this so called induced topology we examine the concept of convergence
in the metric spaces introduced above. It should be noted immediately that different
metrics on the same set may induce the same topology. Topological spaces induced
by a metric are called metrizable and we study some of their properties.
As motivation for the induced topology we follow a similar route to the one we
took in Sect. 3.1 where the concept of topology was motivated as a means to capture
continuity while avoiding arbitrary properties of the distance function.
Before we proceed we note that the familiar notion of continuity of a function
applies (formally verbatim) to arbitrary metric spaces.
Deﬁnition 4.5 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is continuous if for
all x ∈X and ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that
d(x, x′) < δ =⇒d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε
for all x′ ∈X.
4.2.1
The Induced Topology
The topology induced by a metric is given in terms of open balls which are shown
below to form a basis for a topology. It should be made clear at once that the resulting
topology does not carry all of the metric information. In fact, it carries very little of it.
There may be many radically different distance functions on a single set, all of which
induce the same topology. Moreover, not every topology is necessarily induced by a
metric. Thus replacing a metric by the induced topology looses a lot of information
and misses many topological spaces. However, it is often convenient to be able to
forget information, especially when it is not pertinent to the problem at hand.
Deﬁnition 4.6 Let X be a metric space, x ∈X, and ε > 0. The open ball with centre
x and radius ε is the set
Bε(x) = {y ∈X | d(x, y) < ε}.
Example 4.5 Consider the Euclidean metric on Rn. The open ball Bε(x) in R is the
open interval (x −ε, x + ε), while in R2 it is the interior of the circle with centre x
and radius ε, and in R3 it is the interior of a ball with centre x and radius ε.
In a general metric space an open ball need not look anything like a ball. We
already had a look at some odd looking ‘circles’ in Fig. 2.1 located in Sect. 2.5
when R2 is equipped with the metric induced by the ℓp norm. Their interiors are the
corresponding open balls in these spaces.
We show that the open balls in a metric space X form a basis for a topology.

4.2 Topology and Convergence in a Metric Space
143
Theorem 4.2 The collection {Bε(x) | x ∈X, ε > 0} of all open balls in a metric
space X satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 3.10.
Proof Since x ∈Bε(x) for all x ∈X and ε > 0, it follows at once that the open
balls cover all of X. Next, suppose that z ∈Bε1(x) ∩Bε2(y) and we will demonstrate
that z ∈Bε(z) ⊆Bε1(x) ∩Bε2(y) for ε = min{ε1 −d(x, z), ε2 −d(y, z)}. Indeed,
if d(w, z) < ε, then d(w, x) ≤d(w, z) + d(z, x) < (ε1 −d(x, z)) + d(z, x) = ε1,
and so w ∈Bε1(x), and therefore Bε(z) ⊆Bε1(x). Similarly, Bε(z) ⊆Bε2(y). Noting
that ε > 0, the proof is complete.
□
The following deﬁnition is now justiﬁed.
Deﬁnition 4.7 Given a metric space (X, d), the induced topology on the set X is
the topology generated by the open balls in X. In particular, all open balls in X are
open sets and a subset U ⊆X is open in the induced topology precisely when for
all x ∈U there exists an ε > 0 such that Bε(x) ⊆U. Any topological space (X, τ)
for which there exists a metric d on X inducing the given topology τ is called a
metrizable space.
Remark 4.3 Every metric space is silently endowed with the induced topology,
automatically making it a topological space.
Example 4.6 It is straightforward to see that the Euclidean distance d(x, y) = |x −
y| on R induces the Euclidean topology on R. One may also readily conﬁrm that the
discrete topology on a set X is induced by the distance function d : X × X →R+
given by d(x, y) = 1 if x ̸= y and d(x, x) = 0, thus any discrete topological space
is metrizable.
Examples of non-metrizable spaces are easily constructed once basic facts about
metrizable spaces are observed. First though, we note the following.
Theorem 4.3 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is continuous in the
sense of Deﬁnition 4.5 if, and only if, it is continuous with respect to the induced
topologies.
The proof is formally identical to the proof of Theorem 3.2 and is left for the reader
as we turn to examine general properties of metrizable spaces.
Theorem 4.4 Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.
Proof Let X be a topological space whose topology is induced by a metric d. Given
distinct points x, y ∈X let ε = d(x, y)/2, and notice that ε > 0. Then the open
balls Bε(x) and Bε(y) separate x and y: if z ∈Bε(x) ∩Bε(y), then we would have
d(x, y) ≤d(x, z) + d(z, y) < 2ε = d(x, y), which is absurd.
□
By Theorem 3.12 convergent sequences in Hausdorff spaces have unique limits,
leading to the following familiar result stated for general metric spaces.
Corollary 4.1 In a metric space, a convergent sequence has a unique limit.

144

Metric Spaces
Apart from being Hausdorff, every metrizable topology has other pleasant features
inﬂuencing its topological behavior. It is worthwhile noticing that it is the interaction
of a metric space with R+ (via the distance function) that is responsible for some of
the familiar properties of the real numbers to reﬂect back to any metric space. This
is shown in the next result.
Theorem 4.5 Every metrizable space is ﬁrst countable.
Proof Let X be a topological space whose topology is induced by a metric d and
let x ∈X. We need to exhibit a countable local basis at x. The collection {B1/n(x) |
n ∈N} is clearly countable. To show that it is a local basis, suppose that x ∈U for
an open set U ⊆X. Then there is an ε > 0 with Bε(x) ⊆U, and thus if we take any
n > 1/ε, then B1/n(x) ⊆Bε(x) ⊆U, as required.
□
Theorem 3.9 yields the following corollaries.
Corollary 4.2 A point x in a metric space X is a cluster point of a subset S ⊆X if,
and only if, x is the limit of a sequence of points from S.
Corollary 4.3 A subset F of a metrizable space X is closed if, and only if, F contains
all limit points of sequences in F.
Corollary 4.4 (Heine’s Continuity Criterion) A function f : X →Y between two
metrizable spaces is continuous if, and only if,
xm →x0 =⇒f (xm) →f (x0)
for all sequences {xm}m≥1 in X.
By Theorem 3.8 a second countable space is separable. For metric spaces the converse
holds as well.
Theorem 4.6 A separable metrizable space X is second countable.
Proof Let d be a metric inducing the topology on X. We are given a countable and
dense set D = {xk}k∈N in X and we need to exhibit a countable basis for X. In the
proof of Theorem 4.5 we saw that the collection
Bk = {B1/n(xk) | n ∈N}
is a local basis at xk. We now show that
B =

k∈N
Bk
is a basis for the topology of X, noticing that the result then follows since B, being
a countable union of countable sets, is itself countable (see Sect. 1.2.13).

4.2 Topology and Convergence in a Metric Space
145
Let U ⊆X be an open subset and choose x ∈U. There is then an ε > 0 such
that B2ε(x) ⊆U. Choose n ∈N such that 1/n < ε. Since D is dense and B1/n(x)
is open, it follows that D ∩B1/n(x) is not empty, and thus there is some m such
that xm ∈B1/n(x), in other words, d(x, xm) < 1/n. Now, the choice of n guarantees
that B1/n(xm) ⊆B2ε(x) ⊆U, while the choice of xm guarantees that x ∈B1/n(xm).
Noticing that B1/n(xm) ∈Bm, the above establishes that for every open set U and
x ∈U, there exists a B ∈B with x ∈B ⊆U, showing that B is a basis for the
topology on X.
□
4.2.2
Convergence in Metric Spaces
Every metric space is in particular a topological space and thus is equipped with
a convergence notion. We investigate this convergence in the context of the main
examples of metric spaces given above.
Proposition 4.1 A sequence {xm}m≥1 in a metric space X converges to x0 ∈X if,
and only if, d(xm, x0) →0 in R in the usual sense of convergence.
Proof Suppose xm →x0 in the topological sense. Given ε > 0 consider the open
ball Bε(x0), which is open in the induced topology. That means that there exists an
N ∈N such that xm ∈Bε(x0) for all m > N. In other words, d(xm, x0) < ε for all
m > N, showing that d(xm, x0) →0. The converse is left for the reader.
□
Example 4.7 Consider Rn with the Euclidean metric
d(x, y) =
 n

k=1
(xk −yk)2
1/2
.
For a sequence {x(m)}m≥1 of elements in Rn and a point x ∈Rn the inequalities
|x(m)
k
−xk| ≤∥x(m) −x∥,
valid for all 1 ≤k ≤n, show that x(m) →x implies x(m)
k
→xk, for each component.
The converse is also true, (since there are only ﬁnitely many components), and thus
convergence in the Euclidean metric in Rn is equivalent to the usual convergence of
the components in R.
Example 4.8 Consider the space ℓp, p ≥1 (see Sect. 2.5.4). Much as in the previous
example, convergence in the ℓp norm implies the convergence of each of the com-
ponents. However, as each vector now has inﬁnitely many components, the converse
does not necessarily hold. To see that, take the sequence {x(m)}m∈N where
x(m)
k
=

1 if m = k,
0 if m ̸= k.

146
4
Metric Spaces
Each sequence {x(m)
k
}m∈N is eventually constantly 0, and thus the only candidate for
the limit of {x(m)}m∈N is the 0 vector. However,
d(x(m), 0) =
 ∞

i=1
|x(m)
k
|p
1/p
= 1,
and thus x(m) ̸→0 in the metric sense, and therefore {x(m)}m≥1 does not converge at
all in ℓp. The same sequence exhibits similar behaviour in ℓ∞.
Example 4.9 Consider the space C(I, R) of continuous real-valued functions on
the closed interval I = [a, b], with the metric induced by the L∞norm, i.e., for a
sequence of functions {xm}m≥1 and a function x0:
xm →x0
⇐⇒
max
t∈[a,b] |xm(t) −x0(t)| →0.
Thus, for any ﬁxed ε > 0 there exists an N ∈N such that |xm(t) −x0(t)| < ε for
all m > N and for all t ∈[a, b]. In other words, xm converges to x0 uniformly on
[a, b]. Since the converse is also true, as is easily seen by traversing the arguments
backwards, we conclude that convergence in the L∞norm, is nothing but uniform
convergence of functions on the interval [a, b].
Example 4.10 For 1 ≤p < ∞consider the pre-L p space C(I, R), with I = [a, b],
i.e., with distance given by
d(x, y) =
 b
a
dt |(x(t) −y(t)|p
1/p
.
Convergence with respect to this metric is called L p convergence. It is well-known,
from elementary considerations of the Riemann integral, that if xm →x0 uniformly,
then xm also converges to x0 in the L p norm. The converse is not generally true, as
we exemplify for the L2 norm. In C([0, 1], R) consider the sequence
xm(t) =
⎧

shows that xm converges in L2 to the constant function x(t) = 1. However, point wise
xm(t) converges to the discontinuous function ˜x(t) = 1 for 0 < t ≤1 and ˜x(0) = 0.
As the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous, we see that {xm}m≥1 does
not converge with respect to the L∞norm.
Example 4.11 In fact, L p convergence need not even imply point wise convergence
at any t in the domain. Indeed, consider C([0, 1], R) and, for simplicity, the L1 norm.
Let Im be the following sequence of intervals. The ﬁrst interval is I0 = [0, 1], the
entire segment. The next two intervals are I1 = [0, 1/2] and I2 = [1/2, 1]. The next
three intervals are obtained by subdividing [0, 1] into three equal segments, the next
four intervals are obtained by subdividing [0, 1] into four equal segments, and so
on. Consider for each m the indicator function xm = χIm. These functions are not
continuous, but let us ignore this for now. With respect to the L1 norm xm converges
to the constant function 0 since the integral
 1
0 dt χm is the length of the segment that
was considered in the m-th stage and the segments’ sizes shrink to 0. However, for
any 0 ≤t ≤1, the sequence {χm(t)}m≥1 contains a subsequence that is constantly
1 and a subsequence that is constantly 0, and thus does not converge. This example
would thus serve our purpose, illustrating that L1 convergence need not imply point
wise convergence at any point, except that the functions are not continuous. This can
easily be remedied, with minor changes in the details above, by sacriﬁcing a little bit
of the segment used to deﬁne xm in order to add two linear segments to the graph of
χm so as to obtain the graph of a continuous function xm. This can be done in such a

way as to only slightly affect the integrals, so that the L1 convergence is unaltered,
while retaining the point-wise non-convergence (see Exercise 4.32).

is ﬁnite and O(S) = {O(d) | d ∈S}.
6. O generally does not preserve arbitrary meets in the above sense for S inﬁnite.
4.3
Non-expanding Functions and Uniform Continuity
Given two metric spaces X and Y the rich structure embodied in the metrics can
be preserved to various degrees by functions f : X →Y. In a sense the weakest
preservation of structure one can impose is for f to be continuous while the strongest
is for f to be an isometry. We look at two intermediate conditions for structure
preservation, namely non-expansion and uniform continuity.
Deﬁnition 4.8 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is non-expanding if
d( f (x), f (x′)) ≤d(x, x′)
for all x, x′ ∈X.

150
4
Metric Spaces
An important observation is that in any metric space (X, d) the distance function
d : X × X →R+ is non-expanding. Recall the additive metric product structure
(Deﬁnition 4.4) and the metric on R+ described in Example 4.4.
Lemma 4.1 In any metric space X the distance function d : X × X →R+ is non-
expanding.
Proof Given (x, x′), (y, y′) ∈X × X we may assume without loss of generality that
dX(x, x′) ≥dX(y, y′). Let us further assume that both dX(x, x′) and dX(y, y′) are
ﬁnite. It then follows that
dR+(d(x, x′), d(y, y′)) = |dX(x, x′) −dX(y, y′)| = dX(x, x′) −dX(y, y′).
Since
dX×X((x, x′), (y, y′)) = dX(x, y) + dX(x′, y′)
we need to show that
dX(x, x′) ≤dX(x, y) + dX(y, y′) + dX(y′, x′)
which is indeed the case by the triangle inequality. Treating the cases where either
dX(x, x′) = ∞or dX(y, y′) = ∞is similar.
□
Non-expansion is a rather strong property, quite close in strength to being an isometry.
On the other side of the spectrum, closer to continuity, lies uniform continuity. We
shall see that it is only slightly stronger than continuity.
Deﬁnition 4.9 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is uniformly continu-
ous if for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
d(x, x′) < δ =⇒d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε
for all x, x′ ∈X.
One can verify that if f : X →Y is non-expanding, then it is uniformly continuous,
and that uniform continuity implies continuity. Neither converse implication is gen-
erally true. However, the Heine-Cantor Theorem states that continuity on a closed
interval implies uniform continuity. The crucial property here is that a closed inter-
val is compact. Indeed, we show that if X is compact, then continuity does imply
uniform continuity. The proof we present relies on the topological concept known
as the Lebesgue number of a covering and it requires a bit of preparation.
Deﬁnition 4.10 Let X be a metric space and S ⊆X a subset. The diameter of S is
the extended real number
diam(S) = sup
x,y∈S
{d(x, y)}
(which may be ∞).

4.3 Non-expanding Functions and Uniform Continuity
151
For instance, if S = {x, y}, then diam(S) = d(x, y). In Rn with the Euclidean metric
diam(Bε(x)) = 2ε, for all x ∈Rn and ε > 0. More generally, in an arbitrary metric
space diam(Bε(x)) ≤2ε always holds and equality may fail.
Lemma 4.2 (LebesgueNumberLemma)Let X beacompactmetricspace.If{Ui}i∈I
is an arbitrary open covering of X, then there exists a δ > 0 such that for all subsets
S ⊆X with diam(S) < δ there is an i ∈I with S ⊆Ui.
Proof For each x ∈X there is an ix ∈I with x ∈Uix and since Uix is open there is
an εx > 0 such that B2εx(x) ⊆Uix. Clearly, the collection {Bεx(x)}x∈X covers X so
by compactness there is a ﬁnite subcovering
X =
m

k=1
Bεxk (xk).
We show that
δ = min{εx1, . . . , εkm},
which is clearly positive, is the required δ for the claim. Suppose then that S ⊆X
is a subset with diam(S) < δ. We may assume S ̸= ∅, so let us ﬁx an element y ∈
S. Since y ∈X and X is covered by {Bεk(x)}1≤k≤n we may ﬁnd an x = xk0, with
corresponding ε = εk0, such that y ∈Bε(x). It now follows, for any y′ ∈S, that
d(y, y′) ≤diam(S) < δ, and thus y′ ∈Bδ(y). However,
Bδ(y) ⊆Bε(y) ⊆B2ε(x) ⊆Ux
(as the reader is invited to verify) and thus y′ ∈Ux. As y′ ∈S was arbitrary it follows
that S ⊆Ux, as required.
□
A δ as in the statement above is called a Lebesgue number for the covering.
Theorem 4.7 (Heine-Cantor) A continuous function f : X →Y from a compact
metric space X to an arbitrary metric space Y is uniformly continuous.
Proof Given ε > 0 consider, for each y ∈Y, the set
Uy = f −1(B ε
2 (y))
whichisopensince f iscontinuous.Clearly, x ∈U f (x) forall x ∈X andthus{Uy}y∈X
is an open covering of X. We may now choose a Lebesgue number δ > 0 for that
covering. Suppose that
d(x, x′) < δ
for points x, x′ ∈X. Then, diam({x, x′}) < δ and thus {x, x′} ⊆f −1(Bε/2(y)) for
some y ∈Y. That means that d( f (x), y) < ε/2 and that d( f (x′), y) < ε/2. Apply-
ing the triangle inequality yields

Metric Spaces
d( f (x), f (x′)) ≤d( f (x), y) + d(y, f (x′)) < ε
as needed.
□
Since uniform continuity always entails continuity, the result above implies that for
a function f : X →Y between metric spaces with a compact domain the concepts
of continuity and uniform continuity coincide.

Complete Metric Spaces
This section is devoted to completeness in a metric space. A metric space X is said
to be complete when every Cauchy sequence in it converges. Thus, in a sense, X is
complete when every sequence in X that should converge actually does converge.
The section starts with a discussion of the concept of Cauchy sequences in general
metric spaces and then considers the completeness of R. The reader may already
be familiar with the completeness of the real numbers, a property that is commonly
stated in the form of the least upper bound principle: every non-empty bounded above
set of real numbers has a supremum (for more details see Sect. 1.2.19). We show
below that the least upper bound property implies the metric completeness of R,
namely that any Cauchy sequence in R converges (when R is given the Euclidean
metric). We then examine the metric spaces from the previous sections, together with
an investigation of their completeness. Next we establish two fundamental theorems
of complete metric spaces, namely the Banach Fixed Point Theorem and Baire’s
Theorem. The importance of these results is difﬁcult to over emphasize, particularly
in the context of this book. As will be shown in Chap. 6, the Banach Fixed Point
Theorem can be used to iteratively solve certain differential equations. Some of the
consequences of Baire’s Theorem in the theory of Banach spaces will also be given.
This chapter then closes with a description of a completion process, i.e., a way to
turn any metric space into a complete one while altering it as little as possible. The
construction we present is that of Cantor’s using Cauchy sequences.
4.4.1
Complete Metric Spaces
Given a sequence {xm}m≥1 in a metric space X the statement
∃x0 ∈X ∀ε > 0 ∃N ∈N : ∀m ≥N d(xm, x0) < ε
is nothing but the claim that xm →x0. By interchanging the ﬁrst two quantiﬁers we
arrive at
∀ε > 0 ∃xε ∈X, N ∈N : ∀m ≥N d(xm, xε) < ε
which we call the global Cauchy condition. It expresses something considerably
weaker than the existence of a limit. Namely, to establish convergence one needs to
manufacture an appropriate N ∈N for any given ε > 0 without altering the limiting
point. With the global Cauchy condition, on the other hand, one is ﬁrst given an
ε > 0, and may then manufacture the limit point xε and a corresponding N ∈N.
The global Cauchy condition expresses the existence of a sort of varying limit of
the sequence. In particular, if the sequence converges to x0, then the global Cauchy
condition is satisﬁed simply by taking xε = x0.

Metric Spaces
A simple analysis of the situation reveals that the xε can be eliminated from the
global Cauchy condition. Suppose that the global Cauchy condition is satisﬁed and
let ε > 0 be given. There exist then an xε ∈X and an N ∈N so that d(xm, xε) < ε/2,
for all m ≥N. It then follows that
d(xk, xm) ≤d(xk, xε) + d(xε, xm) ≤ε
2 + ε
2 = ε
for all k, m ≥N. Conversely, suppose that for all ε > 0 there exists an N ∈N such
that
d(xk, xm) < ε
for all k, m ≥N. Then by taking xε = xN we obtain
d(xm, xε) = d(xm, xN) < ε
for all m ≥N, and so the global Cauchy condition is satisﬁed. This discussion is
summarized as follows.
Deﬁnition 4.11 A sequence {xm}m≥1 in a metric space X is a Cauchy sequence if it
satisﬁes the Cauchy condition:
∀ε > 0 ∃N ∈N ∀k, m ≥N : d(xk, xm) < ε.
Equivalently, a sequence {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence if it satisﬁes the global
Cauchy condition
∀ε > 0 ∃xε ∈X, N ∈N : ∀m ≥N d(xm, xε) < ε.
The familiar fact that every convergent sequence in R (when endowed with the
Euclidean metric) is a Cauchy sequence is now nothing but the remark above that
the global Cauchy condition is trivially implied by the existence of a limit. The
converse in R is well known to be true (and we prove that fact below) but for general
metric spaces the converse may fail. To see that, start with any convergent sequence
xm →x0 in a metric space X satisfying xm ̸= x0, for all m ≥1, and consider the same
sequence {xm}m≥1 in the subspace X −{x0}. Clearly, {xm}m≥1 satisﬁes the Cauchy
condition (indeed, it is a convergent sequence in X). However, it only converges in
X; if it converged in X −{x0} too, say to the point y ∈X −{x0}, then it would also
converge to y in X, contradicting uniqueness of limits in a metric space.
Deﬁnition 4.12 A metric space X in which every Cauchy sequence admits a limit
in X is said to be a complete metric space.
As promised above we closely examine the completeness of the reals, which, as we
will see, is a pivotal result.
Example 4.12 (The completeness of R) The space R with the Euclidean metric
d(x, y) = |x −y| is a most fundamental example of a complete metric space. Recall

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
155
(Sect. 1.2.19) that the real numbers R are deﬁned to be any Dedekind complete
ordered ﬁeld.
Given a Cauchy sequence {xm}m≥1 of real numbers we ﬁrst note that {xm}m≥1
is bounded by some number M, i.e., |xm| < M for all m ∈N. Indeed, for ε = 1
there exists an N ∈N such that |xk −xm| < 1 for all k, m ≥N, and thus we found
a bounded tail of the sequence, and so the entire sequence is bounded. Let S ⊆R be
the subset consisting of all x ∈R such that the inequality x < xm holds for almost all
m ∈N (meaning that it holds for all m ∈N with at most ﬁnitely many exceptions).
Clearly, for our chosen upper bound M we have that −M ∈S and M /∈S, and thus
S is non-empty and bounded above. By the least upper bound principle in R the set
S admits a supremum L. We will proceed to show that L is in fact the limit of the
given sequence. Given ε > 0 let N ∈N with |xk −xm| < ε/2 for all k, m ≥N. In
particular, for m = N we obtain
xm −ε
2 < xk < xm + ε
2
for all k ≥N. These inequalities imply, by deﬁnition of S, that
xm −ε
2 ∈S,
while
xm + ε
2 /∈S.
Since L is the least upper bound of S it now follows that
xm −ε
2 ≤L ≤xm + ε
2.
Combining all of the inequalities above, it follows that
|xk −L| ≤|xk −xm| + |xm −L| ≤ε
2 + ε
2 = ε
for all k > N, proving that xm →L. R is thus metrically complete.
Remark 4.4 The amount of work put into this example is quite adequately justiﬁed
by noticing that the completeness of R is used in establishing the completeness of
all of the forthcoming examples of complete metric spaces.
Remark 4.5 It should be noted that Dedekind completeness is a stronger property
than metric completeness, in the following sense. While every Dedekind complete
ordered ﬁeld is metrically complete, there exist metrically complete ordered ﬁelds
which are not Dedekind complete. None of these examples would be Archimedean
though. These issues however are not particularly relevant to us here.
Example 4.13 In contrast to the situation with the real numbers, the metric space Q
of rational numbers with d(x, y) = |x −y| is not complete. Indeed, by the density
of Q in R, for every irrational α there is a sequence of rational numbers with xm →α
in R. Such a sequence is thus Cauchy in both R and Q but fails to converge in Q.

156

Metric Spaces
Before examining the completeness property for the metric spaces introduced above
we remark that completeness is a metric invariant. In fact, we establish a stronger
result.
Proposition 4.2 (Uniformly Continuous Functions Preserve Cauchy Sequences) If
f : X →Y is a uniformly continuous function between metric spaces and {xm}m≥1
is a Cauchy sequence in X, then { f (xm)}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in Y.
Proof Given ε > 0 let δ > 0 be such that
d(x, x′) < δ =⇒d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε.
Since {xm}m≥1 is Cauchy, there exists an N ∈N such that
k, m ≥N =⇒d(xk, xm) < δ.
Combining the two implications yields
k, m ≥N =⇒d( f (xk), f (xm)) < ε,
as needed for showing that { f (xm)}m≥1 is Cauchy.
□
Corollary 4.5 Let f : X →Y be an invertible continuous function between metric
spaces such that f −1 : Y →X is uniformly continuous. If X is complete, then so is
Y.
Proof Let {ym}m≥1 be a Cauchy sequence in Y. Then { f −1(ym)}m≥1 is a Cauchy
sequence in X and since X is complete the sequence converges: f −1(ym) →x0.
Since a continuous function perseveres limits of sequences, we may now apply f to
conclude that ym →f (x0).
□
Corollary 4.6 Completeness is a metric invariant.
A very important property of complete metric spaces is that they allow to extend
a uniformly continuous function from a subset to its closure.
Theorem 4.8 Let X, Y be metric spaces with Y complete. If f : S →Y is a uni-
formly continuous function on a subset S ⊆X, then f extends uniquely to a uniformly
continuous function ˆf : S →Y.
Proof Firstly, we show that if an extension exists, then it is unique. Let x ∈S be an
arbitrary point in the closure. There exists then a sequence {sn}n≥1 in S with
lim
n→∞sn = x
and as any extension of f to a uniformly continuous function ˆf is in particular
continuous we see that

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
157
ˆf (x) = ˆf ( lim
n→∞sn) = lim
n→∞
ˆf (sn) = lim
n→∞f (sn)
and is thus uniquely determined by f and the topologies of X and Y. We must now
show that we can turn this observation into a deﬁnition, i.e., that
ˆf (x) = lim
n→∞f (sn)
is a well-deﬁned uniformly continuous function for all x ∈S and that it extends
f . First, we note that the limit deﬁning ˆf is guaranteed to exist no matter which
sequence in S is chosen to converge to x. This is so since such a sequence {sn}n≥1 is
Cauchy in X (since it converges) and thus the sequence { f (sn)}n≥1 is Cauchy in Y
(since f is uniformly continuous) and thus converges (since Y is complete). Suppose
now that tn →x for some other sequences in S. The triangle inequality and a limit
argument then shows that
lim
n→∞d(sn, tn) = 0
and uniform continuity of f gives us
lim
n→∞d( f (sn), f (tn)) = 0.
Were it the case that f (sn) →y while f (tn) →z with y ̸= z, then continuity of the
distance function would yield
lim
n→∞d( f (sn), f (tn)) = d( lim
n→∞f (sn), lim
n→∞f (tn)) = d(y, z) > 0
and thus a contradiction. We conclude that y = z and so ˆf (x) is independent of the
choice of the sequence converging to x.
The uniform continuity of ˆf follows again by the triangle inequality, and the fact
that ˆf extends f is trivial by considering, for s ∈S, the constant sequence converging
to it.
□
We turn to some examples of completeness, or lack thereof, in our spaces of
interest.
Example 4.14 (Completeness of Rn) For the metric space Rn with the Euclidean
metric
d(x, y) =
 n

k=1
(xk −yk)2
1/2
we already saw that x(m) →x if, and only if, x(m)
k
→xk for each 1 ≤k ≤n. To show
that Rn is complete, suppose that {x(m)}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence. Then, for each
1 ≤k ≤n, the sequence {x(m)
k
}m≥1 is also Cauchy (since |x(m)
k
−x(m′)
k
| ≤d(x, y))

158
4
Metric Spaces
and since R is complete we conclude that x(m)
k
→xk for all 1 ≤k ≤n, and therefore
that x(m) →(x1, . . . , xn). Thus, every Cauchy sequence in Rn converges, as required.
Example 4.15 (Completeness of Cn) The metric space Cn with distance given by
d(x, y) =
 n

k=1
|xk −yk|2
1/2
is complete. Since Cn is isometric to R2n and completeness is a metric invariant, the
completeness of R2n implies that of Cn.
Example 4.16 For a closed interval I = [a, b] the space C(I, R) of continuous
functions on I with the metric structure induced by the L∞norm is complete. To
see that recall that convergence with respect to this metric is uniform convergence of
sequences of functions. If {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence of continuous real-valued
functions on I, then one easily sees that for each t ∈[a, b] the sequence {xm(t)}m≥1
is a Cauchy sequence in R with respect to the Euclidean metric. As R is complete it
follows that xm(t) →x(t), showing that {xm}m≥1 converges point-wise to a function
x : [a, b] →R, and in fact the convergence is easily seen to be uniform. To conclude
we recall the well known fact that if a sequence of continuous functions converges
uniformly to a function x, then x is continuous. Thus, x ∈C(I, R) and is the uniform
limit of the given sequence.
Example 4.17 In contrast to the L∞case, for all 1 ≤p < ∞the pre-L p space
C([a, b], R) is not complete. For simplicity let us consider the case [a, b] = [0, 1].
Let
xm(t) =

2. Similarly x(t) = 0 for all 1
2 < t ≤1, but then
x is not continuous.

Example 4.18 Going back to the complete space C(I, R) with the metric obtained
from the L∞norm (for which convergence is equivalent to uniform convergence)
consider the subspace P ⊆C(I, R) consisting only of the polynomial functions. As
a subspace of the complete space C(I, R) the space P is not complete. To see that,
recall that the polynomials
pm(t) =
m

k=0

converge uniformly to the exponential function et, which is not a polynomial. Thus
the sequence {pm}m≥1 is Cauchy (since it converges in C(I, R)) but it does not
converge to a polynomial and thus does not converge in P at all (since if it would,
then it would have two different limits in C(I, R))
Example 4.19 The space ℓp (of all absolutely p-power summable sequences of, say,
real numbers) is complete. To see that, let {x(m)}m≥1 be a Cauchy sequence in ℓp.
Since |x(m)
k
−x(n)
k | ≤∥x(m) −x(n)∥p, for all k ≥1, it follows readily that {x(m)
k
}m≥1
is a Cauchy sequence in R, and thus it converges to a point xk ∈R. Thus {x(m)}m≥1
converges component wise to x = (x1, . . . , xk, . . .). The completeness of ℓp will
follow by showing that the convergence is also in the ℓp norm. Firstly, to verify that
x ∈ℓp, note that since {x(m)}m≥1 is Cauchy, it is bounded, say by M. Now, for all

Allowing m to tend to ∞, and then for K to tend to ∞shows that ∥x∥p ≤M, and
thus x ∈ℓp. Finally, to show that xm →x in the ℓp norm, let ε > 0 be given. Let
N ∈N with
∥x(m) −x(n)∥p < ε
for all m, n ≥N. We now have, for all K ≥1 and m, n ≥N, that

for all m > N, as required.

Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem
A ﬁxed point for a function f : X →X is a point x0 ∈X with f (x0) = x0. Often,
a problem can be rephrased in terms of ﬁnding a ﬁxed point for a suitable function.
Fixed point theory is thus a useful tool when solving practical problems. We present
a geometric condition on a function on a metric space that guarantees the existence
of a unique ﬁxed point. Unlike many existence proofs, this one is constructive and
thus can be used in practice to obtain approximations for solutions.
The geometric notion we require is that of a contraction.
Deﬁnition 4.13 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is called a contrac-
tion if there exists a real number 0 ≤α < 1 such that
d( f (x1), f (x2)) ≤αd(x1, x2)
for all x1, x2 ∈X.
We note at once that a function need not be a contraction in order to posses ﬁxed
points. An extreme example is the identity function id : X →X on any metric space.
It is not a contraction yet every point is a ﬁxed point of it.
Theorem 4.9 (Banach Fixed Point Theorem) If X is a complete non-empty metric
space and f : X →X is a contraction, then f has a unique ﬁxed point x0 ∈X.
Proof To prove the existence of a ﬁxed point let x1 be an arbitrary element in X and
consider the sequence x2 = f (x1), x3 = f (x2), and in general xm+1 = f (xm). If this
sequence converges to some limit x0 ∈X, then, since continuous functions preserve
limits of sequences, we will have that
f (x0) = f ( lim
m→∞xm) = lim
m→∞f (xm) = lim
m→∞xm+1 = lim
m→∞xm = x0
and so x0 is a ﬁxed point of f . To show that the sequence does indeed converge
we invoke the completeness of X and proceed to show that the sequence is Cauchy.
Since the function f is a contraction we know that there exists an 0 ≤α < 1 such
that
d( f (x), f (y)) ≤αd(x, y)
for all x, y ∈X. We need to estimate the quantities d(xk, xm) for the sequence deﬁned
above, and we notice ﬁrst that for all x, y ∈X the triangle inequality yields
d(x, y) ≤d(x, f (x)) + d( f (x), f (y)) + d( f (y), y)
≤d(x, f (x)) + αd(x, y) + d( f (y), y)
and thus

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
161
d(x, y) ≤d(x, f (x)) + d(y, f (y))
1 −α
.
Incidentally, this already shows that if x and y are both ﬁxed points of f , then
d(x, y) = 0, and thus x = y, so the uniqueness clause is proven.
The proof is completed by a straightforward application of the latter inequality
that leads to
d(xk, xm) ≤αk + αm
1 −α d(x0, x1)
from which the fact that {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence is clear.
□
4.4.3
Baire’s Theorem
The next result has numerous important implications in analysis in general and in
functional analysis and Banach space theory in particular. Baire’s theorem can be
interpreted as stating that a non-empty complete metric space can not be small.
But, size is a multifaceted concept. For instance, the set Q of rational numbers is
countable while R is uncountable and thus, in terms of cardinality of sets, Q is
negligible compared to R. However, from a topological point of view, since the
closure of Q is all of R, the set Q is quite large. The opposite situation is that of a
nowhere dense set, namely a set S whose closure has empty interior, and is thus a
(topologically speaking) very small set. Sets which are countable unions of nowhere
dense sets are called meager sets. The claim of Baire’s Theorem is that a non-empty
complete metric space is never meager.
Deﬁnition 4.14 A subset S ⊆X in a topological space X is said to be nowhere
dense if the interior of its closure is empty. Equivalently, S is nowhere dense when
S contains no non-empty open subsets.
Nowhere dense sets are, in a sense, very small. If x is not an isolated point, i.e.,
{x} is not open, then {x} is nowhere dense. A subset of a nowhere dense subset is
nowhere dense, and a ﬁnite union of nowhere dense subsets is itself dense. However,
a countable union of nowhere dense subsets need not be nowhere dense. For instance,
in R with the Euclidean topology no point is isolated and thus every singleton {x}
is nowhere dense Consequently, every ﬁnite subset of R is nowhere dense but Q, a
countable union of singletons, is not nowhere dense. In fact, it is everywhere dense,
i.e., its closure is the entire space R.
Deﬁnition 4.15 A subset S ⊆X in a topological space X is said to be meager if it
is a countable union of nowhere dense subsets.
Clearly, every nowhere dense subset is meager, but not vice-versa (Q is meager in R
but not nowhere dense). It is left to the reader to establish that a subset of a meager
set is itself meager, and that a countable union of meager subsets is meager.

162

Metric Spaces
Since X is a subset of itself we may speak of X itself being meager. Armed with
this new form of measuring sizes, here is the main theorem.
Theorem 4.10 (Baire) A complete non-empty metric space is not meager.
Proof Suppose that X is a complete, non-empty, and meager metric space. By the
deﬁnition of meagerness we may write
X =
∞

m=1
Sm
where each Sm ⊆X is nowhere dense. By noting that the closure of a nowhere dense
subset is still nowhere dense, we may further assume (by taking closures) that each
Sm is closed. Since X is non-empty X is not nowhere dense, and thus Sm ̸= X for
all m ≥1.
From the non-empty open subset X \ S1 we extract a point x1 ∈X and ε1 > 0
with
Bε1(x1) ⊆X \ S1.
Since S2 does not contain any open subset it certainly does not contain Bε1(x). Thus
the set Bε1(x1) ∩(X \ S2), which is open, is not empty. Therefore, there exists a point
x2 ∈X and ε2 > 0 with
Bε2(x2) ⊆Bε1(x1) ∩(X \ S2).
Continuing in this manner we obtain, for each m ≥1, a point xm ∈X and εm > 0
such that
Bεm+1(xm+1) ⊆Bεm(xm) ∩(X \ Sm+1).
To continue we need to optimize the radii. Generally, Bδ/2(x) ⊆Bδ(x) holds and so
we can make the stronger assumption that
Bεm+1(xm+1) ⊆Bεm(xm) ∩(X \ Sm+1).
as well as that that εm < 1/m holds for all m ≥1. We now have a sequence
{Bεm(xm)}m≥1 of nested balls with rapidly shrinking radii and that implies (by Exer-
cise 4.56) that there exists a (unique) point
x0 ∈

m≥1
Bεm(xm).
Now, since {Sm}m≥1 covers X we must have x0 ∈Sm0 for some m0 ≥1. But then
x0 /∈Bεm0 (xm0), a contradiction.

4.4.4
Completion of a Metric Space
If X is a metric space that is not complete, then it is because there exist Cauchy
sequences in it that fail to converge in X. Quite often though the space X is seen
to be embedded inside a larger metric space that is complete. This is the situation
for instance for Q as a metric subspace of R with the Euclidean metric. There are
however other situation where it is not a-priori clear that the metric space in question
embeds in a complete one. For instance, the space C(I, R) with the metric obtained
from the L∞norm is complete but is incomplete with respect to the L p norm for
1 ≤p < ∞. In that case it is not evident what an ambient complete metric space
looks like.
It is natural to ask if any metric space can be completed. That is, whether every
metric space embeds in a potentially (much) larger complete metric space. Of course,
one would have to set some expectations from such a completion, primarily that it
is not too wasteful. In more detail, we are willing to accept that the completion may
need to be larger than the original space, but we do not want it to be any larger than
it must be. The following deﬁnition formalizes this expectation.
Deﬁnition 4.16 Let X be a metric space. A complete metric space Y together with
an isometry ι : X →Y is said to be a metric completion (or simply a completion) of
X if ι(X) is dense in Y. It is common to speak of Y as a completion of X, leaving
ι : X →Y implicit, and it is also common to write ˆX for a completion.
Example 4.20 Clearly, the inclusion ι : Q →R expresses R as a completion of Q,
when both sets are endowed with the metric d(x, y) = |x −y|.
We record the following convenient and important property of the completion.
Theorem 4.11 Let f : X →Y be a uniformly continuous function between metric
spaces, with Y complete. If ι : X →ˆX is a completion, then there exists a unique
uniformly continuous function F : ˆX →Y that extends f , i.e., such that f = F ◦ι.
Proof Apply Theorem 4.8 to the image ι(X) which is by deﬁnition dense in X, so
its closure is X.

164

Metric Spaces
Remark 4.6 The ability to extend a uniformly continuous function to a completion
of the domain does not hold for arbitrary continuous functions. For instance, take
the set S = {1/n | n ∈N} as a metric subspace of R under the Euclidean metric.
Topologically, it is a discrete space and thus any function f : S →Y, to any metric
space Y, is continuous. Such a function merely corresponds to a sequence in Y. Now,
let ˆS = S ∪{0} and notice that with the inclusion function ι : S →ˆS we obtain a
completion of S. The space ˆS is not discrete and a continuous function F : ˆS →Y
corresponds to a sequence in Y together with a limit point of it. In other words, while
continuous functions f : S →Y correspond to arbitrary sequences in Y, continuous
functions F : ˆS →Y correspond to convergent sequences in Y. Clearly, there are
plenty of examples of complete metric spaces Y where not every sequence converges,
and thus not every continuous function f : S →Y extends to a continuous function
F : ˆS →Y.
We pose and answer two natural questions about completions of a metric space
X: does a completion always exist and if so, is it unique. Regarding uniqueness,
suppose that ι : X →Y is a completion. Given any bijection g : Y →Y ′, with Y ′ an
arbitrary set, the metric structure of Y can be transferred to a metric structure on Y ′
by deﬁning d : Y ′ × Y ′ →R+ by d(y′
1, y′
2) = d(g−1(y′
1), g−1(y′
2)), and then g is a
global isometry. Informally, there is no essential difference between Y and Y ′, and
thus it is expected that Y ′ can also serve as a completion for X. This is indeed the
case, as the reader can check that the composition g ◦ι : X →Y ′ is a completion. It
thus follows that a completion is never unique (except when it is empty), but, more
importantly, we are guided to ask a more reﬁned question: given two completions
ι : X →Y and ι′ : X →Y ′ for the same metric space X, are Y and Y ′ isometric?
The afﬁrmative answer is embodied in the following result.
Theorem 4.12 Let X be a metric space. If ι : X →Y and ι′ : X →Y ′ are comple-
tions of X, then there exists a global isometry ρ : Y →Y ′.
Proof Since ι′ : X →Y ′ is an isometry, it is in particular uniformly continuous and
thus ι′ extends uniquely to a uniformly continuous function ρ : Y →Y ′ satisfying ρ ◦
ι = ι′.Reversingtherolesofιandι′,thesameargumentyieldsauniformlycontinuous
function ρ′ : Y ′ →Y with ρ′ ◦ι′ = ι. Let us now consider ρ′ ◦ρ : Y →Y, for which
we have that ρ′ ◦ρ ◦ι = ρ′ ◦ι′ = ι. Thus, ρ′ ◦ρ : Y →Y is a uniformly continuous
function that extends ι. However, quite trivially, the identity function idY : Y →Y
satisﬁes idY ◦ι = ι, namely it too is a uniformly continuous function extending ι. But,
such an extension was proven above to be unique, so we conclude that ρ′ ◦ρ = idY.
A similar argument reveals that ρ ◦ρ′ = idY ′, and thus that ρ is bijective and ρ′ is
its inverse. Finally, due to the continuity of the distance function, for all y1, y2 ∈Y,
choosing sequences {am}m≥1 and {bm}m≥1 with ι(am) →y1 and ι(bm) →y2,
dY(y1, y2) = lim
m→∞dY(ι(am), ι(bm)) = lim
m→∞dX(am, bm)
while

dY ′(ρ(y1), ρ(y2)) = lim
m→∞dY ′((ρ ◦ι)(am), (ρ ◦ι)(bm))
= lim
m→∞dY ′(ι′(am), ι′(bm)) = lim
m→∞dX(am, bm).
In short then, dY(y1, y2) = dY ′(ρ(y1), ρ(y2)), namely ρ is an isometry, and, as seen
above, a global one.
□
The result above shows that all completions of a metric space X are isometric and
thus that the completion is unique up to an isomorphism.We cannot hope for anything
more than that.
Having settled the uniqueness question we turn to the existence of a completion
of an arbitrary metric space X. Since a completion is only unique up to an isometry,
and thus if one (non-empty) completion of X exists, then inﬁnitely many different
completions of X exist, it should not be surprising that there are in the literature
different constructions of embeddings ι : X →ˆX, yielding different (yet isometric)
completions. The one we present is modelled after Cantor’s construction of the real
numbers from the rationals.
We ﬁx a metric space X and construct a completion for it in a series of steps,
leaving it to the reader to ﬁll in the proofs. If X is not complete, then there exists a
Cauchy sequence {xm}m≥1 that fails to have a limit in X. Intuitively, completing X
entails adjoining to X formal limits for all such Cauchy sequences. If we denote the
formal limit of {xm}m≥1 by [{xm}], then we are led to deﬁne ˆX as the union
X ∪{[{xm}] | {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in X that fails to converge}.
However, two different Cauchy sequences {xm}m≥1 and {ym}m≥1 may need to con-
verge to the same point (for instance, there are many different sequences of rationals
that converge to, e.g.,
√
2), and thus an equivalence relation needs to be introduced.
First, though, a simplifying observation: we may identify an element x ∈X with the
constant sequence {xm = x}m≥1 (which is clearly Cauchy). Thus, instead of the union
of X with the formal limits of limit-less Cauchy sequences, we expect a completion
of X to be formed as the set
ˆX = {[{xm}] | {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in X}
of equivalence classes for a suitable equivalence relation on the set of all Cauchy
sequences in X. The following steps realize this plan.
1. Let ˜X be the set of all Cauchy sequences in X. Deﬁne ˜d : ˜X × ˜X →R+ by
˜d({xm}, {ym}) = lim
m→∞d(xm, ym).
2. Prove that the limit deﬁning ˜d((xm), (ym)) always exists. (Hint: The metric func-
tion d : X × X →R+ is uniformly continuous and R is complete.)
3. Prove that ( ˜X, ˜d) is a semimetric space.

Metric Spaces
4. Recall Exercise 4.4 and let ˆX be the metric space thus obtained from ˜X.
5. Prove that ( ˆX, d) is complete. (Hint: avoid the temptation of taking the diagonal
of a Cauchy sequence of Cauchy sequences. Instead, use the Cauchy condition
whenever you can.)
6. Note that for all x ∈X the constant sequence {xm = x}m≥1 is Cauchy, thereby
deﬁning a function ι : X →ˆX. Prove that it is an isometry.
7. Prove that ι(X) is dense in ˆX.
Remark 4.7 Any metric space X has a completion, and thus, if non-empty, X has
inﬁnitely many different (yet isometric) completions. It is important to realize that
there is no distinguished completion that deserves to be called the completion of X.
Any particular construction of a completion for X is just that: one model among
many. Theoretically, since isometric metric spaces are essentially the same, it does
not matter which completion model is used; they are all isometric. However, some
models may offer syntactic advantages over others.

in that case X is complete. Let thus {sm}m≥1 be a Cauchy sequence in X and the goal
is to show that it converges. By the previous exercise it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a convergent

Bεm+1(xm+1) ⊆Bεm(xm).
Consider R with the Euclidean metric and the sequence {B1/n(1/n)}n≥1 of balls.
Verify that this is a sequence of balls with vanishing radii yet the intersection of these

4.5
Compactness and Boundedness
Compactness is a topological property and since a metric space is naturally endowed
with a topology, compactness is meaningful in any metric space. The notion of
completeness on the other hand is a metric property with no topological counterpart.
Nonetheless, completeness and compactness are not independent properties. The
space R with the Euclidean metric is complete but not compact, its subset [0, 1] is
both complete and compact, and (0, 1) is neither complete nor compact. The ﬁnal
possibility though, as we show below, is implied; if a metric space is compact, then
it must be complete. In this section we show the remarkable fact that compactness in
a metric space is equivalent to completeness together with a property known as total
boundedness. The latter is a purely metric property and thus the result shows that the
topological property of compactness is equivalent (for metric spaces, of course) to the
conjunction of the purely metric conditions of completeness and total boundedness.
The reader is familiar with the notion of bounded sets in the Euclidean space Rn.
In a general metric space there are two notions of boundedness. These two notions
coincide in the Euclidean spaces. Recall that for a subset S ⊆X of a metric space
X, its diameter is given by diam(S) = supx,y∈S{d(x, y)}, which may be ∞.
Deﬁnition 4.17 A subset S in a metric space X is bounded if its diameter is ﬁnite.
A subset S is totally bounded if no two points in it are inﬁnite distance apart and for
every ε > 0 one can cover S by ﬁnitely many sets of diameter smaller than ε.

4.5 Compactness and Boundedness
169
The reader is invited to show that every totally bounded set is bounded, but that
the converse need not hold. It is also evident that if S′ ⊆S ⊆X and S is bounded
(respectively totally bounded), then S′ is bounded (respectively totally bounded).
Since X is a subset of itself, we may speak of the metric space X as being bounded
or totally bounded.
The following result, whose proof is left for the reader, has an important corollary
that is pivotal for the proof of the main theorem below.
Proposition 4.3 The equality diam(S) = diam(S) holds for all subsets S of a metric
space X.
Corollary 4.9 Let X be a totally bounded metric space, U = {Ui}i∈I an open cov-
ering of X, and ε > 0. If X can not be covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U,
then there exists a non-empty closed set F ⊆X with diam(F) < ε that cannot be
covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U.
Proof Since X is totally bounded it can be covered by ﬁnitely many subsets of
diameter smaller than ε. By the preceding proposition, we may take the closures
of these sets without altering their diameters and thus we may assume they are all
closed. If each of these sets was covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U, then
(by taking the union) X itself would be covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U,
contrary to the assumption on X. Thus at least one of these closed sets is the desired
one.
□
Theorem 4.13 For a metric space X the following conditions are equivalent.
1. X is compact.
2. X is sequentially compact, i.e., every sequence {xm}m≥1 admits a convergent
subsequence {xmk}k≥1.
3. X is complete and totally bounded.
Proof We prove ﬁrst that if X is compact, then X is sequentially compact, and so
let {xm}m≥1 be a sequence in X. If the set S = {xm | m ∈N} is ﬁnite, then some of
its elements must repeat inﬁnitely often in the given sequence. In other words, the
sequence contains a constant subsequence, which certainly converges. Otherwise S
is an inﬁnite subset in a compact topological space and thus, by Theorem 3.17, it
admits a cluster point x0 ∈X and by Corollary 4.2 this cluster point is the limit of a
sequence of elements from S.
Next we show that if X is sequentially compact, then it is complete and totally
bounded. Suppose then that {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in X. By sequential
compactness we may extract a subsequence {xmk}k≥1 converging to a point x0 ∈X.
But convergence of a subsequence of a Cauchy sequence forces the sequence itself
to converge (to the same limit). So every Cauchy sequence converges, namely X is
complete.
To see that X is also totally bounded, assume for the contrary that it is not. Then
there exists an ε0 > 0 such that

for any choice of points x1, . . . , xm ∈X, m ≥1. We now construct the following
sequence. Since X ̸= ∅(otherwise it is totally bounded), choose an arbitrary element
x1 ∈X. Suppose that we have chosen points x1, . . . , xm ∈X with the property that
d(xi, x j) ≥ε0 for all 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤m. We can now choose an arbitrary element
xm+1 ∈X \

Bε0(kk)
and the condition d(xi, x j) ≥ε0 now holds for all 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤m + 1. In this way
we obtain the inﬁnite sequence {xm}m≥1 which, by sequential compactness, has a
convergent subsequence. In particular, {xm}m≥1 has a Cauchy subsequence. But by
the construction of {xm}m≥1, no such subsequence exists, and thus we obtain a con-
tradiction.
Finally, we prove that if X is complete and totally bounded, then X is compact.
Suppose that U is an open covering of X that does not admit a ﬁnite sub-covering.
Our aim will be to construct a non-convergent Cauchy sequence and thus obtain a
contradiction.
Let us call a non-empty subset F ⊆X a problematic set if it is closed and can-
not be covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U (so X itself is problematic).
By Corollary 4.9 (applied to X with ε = 1) there exists a problematic set F1 with
diam(F1) < 1. Applying the same corollary again (to F1 and with ε = 1/2) there
exists a problematic set F2 ⊆F1 with diam(F2) < 1/2. Continuing inductively in
this manner we obtain a sequence F1 ⊇F2 ⊇F3 ⊇· · · ⊇Fm ⊇· · · of non-empty
closed sets with diam(Fm) < 1/m, all of which are problematic. Let xm ∈Fm be
an arbitrary element in Fm. The sequence {xm}m≥1 is clearly Cauchy since xk ∈Fm
for all k ≥m and thus d(xk, xk′) < 1/m for all k, k′ > m. To see that the sequence
cannot converge assume that xk →x0 for some x0 ∈X. Recalling that every closed
set contains its limit points we see that x0 ∈Fm for all m ≥1 (since xk ∈Fm for all
k ≥m). Further, since U covers X there exists an elementU ∈U with x0 ∈U. Since
U is open there exists a δ > 0 with Bδ(x) ⊆U. Let m now be large enough so that
1/m < δ. We then have that x0 ∈Fm and diam(Fm) < δ and thus Fm ⊆Bδ(x0) ⊆U.
We thus found an element in U which covers Fm, contrary to Fm being a problematic
set. It is thus shown that {xm}m≥1 is a non-convergent Cauchy sequence, contradicting
the completeness of X. The proof is complete.

A Non-classical View of the Classical
Spaces
The classical spaces ℓp of sequences and L p of functions are central to analysis.
Deﬁning the sequence spaces and studying their basic properties is elementary but
evenjustproperlydeﬁningthefunctionspacesismuchmoredelicateandtraditionally
requires a dose of measure theory. Measure theory is itself a tool of central importance
but it is technically involved and this text will not do it justice if attempting to develop
it. Instead, the approach we take in this chapter builds upon the metric machinery
developed thus far. By so doing we are able to quickly obtain precise deﬁnitions and
results at the cost of not having an explicit model. For that reason we take the time
to present a conceptual framework in some detail. In particular, the intention is not
to survey the main properties of the classical spaces but rather to show their precise
relationship to familiar ﬁnite-dimensional spaces. The pros and cons of this approach
are highlighted throughout the chapter.
Section 5.1 introduces metric and topological notions and emphasizes the normed
spaces notation. Section 5.2 concentrates on ﬁnite-dimensional spaces with the two-
fold aim of proving that topologically all norms are equivalent in that case and
to highlight the building blocks of the classical spaces. Section 5.3 directly builds
upon the ﬁnite-dimensional spaces to describe two countable-dimensional spaces and
to formalize their construction as colimits of ﬁnite-dimensional spaces. Section 5.4

A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
5.1.1
The Induced Topology and Equivalent Norms
Let V be a normed linear space. Recall that the induced topology consists of all sets
U ⊆V such that for all x ∈U there exists ε > 0 with
Bε(x) ⊆U
where
Bε(x) = {y ∈V | ∥x −y∥< ε}
is the open ball of radius ε with center x. The homogeneity of ∥−∥implies the
element-wise scaling of open balls: for α > 0
α · Bε(x) = Bαε(x)
where the meaning of the set on the left-hand side is
α · Bε(x) = {α · y | y ∈Bε(x)}.
In words: scaling an ε-ball by α results in a ball about the same center whose radius
got scaled by α. The translation invariance of the metric d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥induced
by the norm manifests itself in a translation property of open balls, i.e.,
Bε(x) + w = Bε(x + w)
for any vector w ∈V (with the evident meaning of the set on the left-hand side). In
words: translating an open ball by w results in another open ball of the same radius
whose center got translated by w.
Since the open balls determine the topology, i.e., a set is open precisely when it
is a union of open balls, translation invariance implies that a set is open precisely
when it is a union of translates of open balls with center 0. By the scaling property
of open balls the collection of open balls centered at 0 is precisely the collection of
all positive scalings of the unit open ball B1(0). It is worth stressing out thus that the
entire topology induced by the norm ∥−∥is determined by just a single open ball.
Let us phrase this property more precisely.
Theorem 5.1 Let V be a normed space. Then a subset U ⊆V is open if, and only
if, there exists a family of vectors {wx}x∈U and positive scalars {εx}x∈U such that
U =

x∈U
εx · B + wx
where B = {y ∈V | ∥y∥< 1} is the open unit ball in V .
Proof SupposethatU becanbewrittenassuchaunion.Ifeachofthesetsεx · B + wx
can be shown to be open, then U is open as the union of open sets. But εx · B + wx =

5.1 Metric and Topological Considerations

Bεx(wx) which is an open ball and thus certainly an open set. In the other direction,
suppose U is open. Thus, by deﬁnition, for each x ∈U there exists εx > 0 such that
x ∈Bεx(x) ⊆U
and so
U =

x∈U
Bεx(x).
Noting that Bεx(x) = Bεx(0) + x = εx · B + x we see that we can take wx = x to
complete the proof.
□
A sequence {xn}n≥1 of vectors in a normed space V converges to x ∈V precisely
when
lim
n→∞∥xn −x∥= 0
and the limit x, if it exists, is unique. The sequence is Cauchy if for all ε > 0 there
exists n ≥1 such that
∥xm −xk∥< ε
for all m, k > n. Every convergent sequence is Cauchy and if V is complete, then
the converse holds as well.
Agivenlinearspacemaysupportmorethanonenormandsoitbecomesinteresting
to compare the induced topologies. In particular, we seek conditions on the norms
that will tell us that the topologies they induce coincide.
Proposition 5.1 Let ∥−∥1 and ∥−∥2 be two norms on V .
1. If there exists a constant c > 0 with ∥x∥1 = c∥x∥2 for all x ∈V , then the two
norms induce the same topology on V .
2. If ∥x∥1 ≤∥x∥2 for all x ∈V , then the topology induced by ∥−∥1 is coarser than
the one induced by ∥−∥2. In other words, if a set U ⊆V is open with respect to
∥−∥1, then it is open with respect to ∥−∥2.
Proof
1. By the stated condition
{x ∈V | ∥x∥1 < 1} = {x ∈V | ∥x∥2 < 1/c} = 1
c {x ∈V | ∥x∥2 < 1}
namely the respective unit open balls are each other’s scalings. Therefore, the
collection of scalings of one ball agrees with the scalings of the other ball. By
Theorem 5.1 the two norms generate the same topology.
2. If U is open with respect to ∥−∥1 and x ∈U, then Bε(x) ⊆U for some ε > 0
where the open ball is with respect to ∥−∥1. But the condition implies that the
open ball Bε(x) with respect to ∥−∥2 is contained in the same ball Bε(x) with
respect to ∥−∥1, and thus U is also open with respect to ∥−∥2.

Deﬁnition 5.1 Two norms ∥−∥1 and ∥−∥2 on the same linear space V are equiv-
alent norms if there exist constants α, β > 0 such that
α∥x∥1 ≤∥x∥2 ≤β∥x∥1
for all x ∈V .
Proposition 5.2 Two norms on a linear space V are equivalent if, and only if, they
determine the same topology.
Proof Repeatedly using Proposition 5.1 we see that ∥−∥1 and α∥−∥1 induce
the same topology while the ﬁrst inequality implies that α∥−∥1 induces a coarser
topology than ∥−∥2, so the topology induced by ∥−∥2 is coarser. Further, the
second inequality implies that ∥−∥2 induces a coarser topology than β∥−∥1
while β∥−∥1 and ∥−∥1 induce the same topology, so the topology induced by
∥−∥1 is coarser. The two topologies must then coincide. The converse is left as an
exercise.
□
Proposition 5.3 Equivalence of norms is an equivalence relation on the set of all
norms on a given linear space V .
Proof The proof can be given directly in terms of Deﬁnition 5.1 by ﬁnding suit-
able constants to establish reﬂexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. A more conceptual
alternative uses Proposition 5.2, e.g., to show transitivity, if ∥−∥1 is equivalent to
∥−∥2, then they determine the same topology τ. If ∥−∥2 is also equivalent to
∥−∥3, then they determine the same topology ρ. The two topologies are determined
by the common norm ∥−∥2 and thus τ = ρ. As ∥−∥1 and ∥−∥3 determine the
same topology, they are equivalent norms.
□
For the comparison of different norms on a given linear space it is convenient to
know that the norm function ∥−∥: V →R is continuous with respect to itself (and
the Euclidean topology on R). This fact is part of the following general observation
stating that pretty much all the structure maps in a normed space are continuous.
Theorem 5.2 Let V be a normed space endowed with its induced metric structure.
1. The norm function ∥−∥: V →R is non-expanding with respect to the Euclidean
metric on R.
2. For each w ∈V the translation function x 	→x + w is an isometry.
3. For each scalar α ∈K the function Aα : V →V given by Aα(x) = αx satisﬁes
∥Aα(x)∥≤|α| · ∥x∥for all x ∈V .
In particular, all of the functions are uniformly continuous.
Proof The ﬁrst claim is the well-known inequality
|∥x∥−∥y∥| ≤∥x −y∥

5.1 Metric and Topological Considerations
177
called the reverse triangle inequality. Its proof is immediate from the triangle inequal-
ity. The second claim is a tautology and the third claim is simply the homogeneity
property of the norm:
∥Aα(x)∥= ∥αx∥= |α|∥x∥.
□
5.1.2
Nets and Dense Sets
The size of a space can be measured in many different ways, one of which is the size
of a dense subset, an essentially topological notion. A metric notion of size is given
by nets, which we introduce and compare to density.
Deﬁnition 5.2 A net in a normed space V is a set X ⊆V of vectors for which there
exists ε > 0 with
∥x1 −x2∥≥ε
for all distinct x1, x2 ∈X.
Recall that a set Y ⊆V is dense if Y = V where the closure is taken with respect
to the induced topology. In a metric space density of Y is equivalent to every vector
x ∈V in the ambient space being a limit of elements from Y. Thus, in a normed
space, Y is dense precisely when for all x ∈V and ε > 0
∥x −y∥< ε
for at least one vector y ∈Y.
Intuitively, a net is spacious and thus a large one implies a large ambient space. A
dense subset ﬁlls up most of the ambient space and thus a small one implies a small
ambient space. This intuition is made formal as follows.
Proposition 5.4 In a normed space V the cardinality of a net is not greater than the
cardinality of a dense set.
Proof Let X ⊆V be a net, so there exists ε > 0 with
∥x1 −x2∥≥ε
for all distinct x1, x2 ∈X. Let Y ⊆V be a dense subset and pick any x ∈X. There
is then at least one y ∈Y with
∥x −y∥< ε
2
and choosing any such vector deﬁnes a function f : X →Y. The claim about the
cardinalities of the sets will follow by showing that f is injective so suppose f (x1) =
f (x2) = y for some x1, x2 ∈X. Then

178

A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
∥x1 −f (x1)∥≤ε
2
and
∥x2 −f (x2)∥< ε

by the construction of f . By the triangle inequality
∥x1 −x2∥= ∥x1 −y + y −x2∥≤∥x1 −y∥+ ∥y −x2∥< ε
2 + ε
2 = ε
while if x1 ̸= x2 then
∥x1 −x2∥≥ε
so we must have that x1 = x2, as needed.
□
5.1.3
Point-to-Set Distance and Closed Sets
The closure of a set S ⊆V in a normed space is its closure in the induced topology,
i.e., thesmallest closedset containing S. Wetakethis opportunitytointroduceanother
perspective on closed sets in a metric space.
Given a point x ∈X and a subset S ⊆X in a metric space it is natural to deﬁne
the point-to-set distance to be the inﬁmum of all distances from x to each element in
the subset S. By slight abuse of notation we extend the distance notation to include
point-to-set scenarios.
Deﬁnition 5.3 The point-to-set distance from a point x ∈X to a subset S ⊆X of a
metric space X is
d(x, S) = inf
s∈S d(x, s).
In low-dimensional spaces it is fairly simple to visualize point-to-set distances. For
instance, in R2 with the Euclidean metric one can easily draw the relevant open ball
Bε(0) and witness that d(t, Bε(0)) = d(0, t) −ε for any t outside of the ball Bε(0).
Note in particular that for any t on the boundary of the ball, i.e., d(0, t) = ε, the point-
to-set distance satisﬁes d(t, Bε(0)) = 0 even though t /∈Bε(0). Intuitively, such a
point lying at 0 distance from the set S is as close as possible to S. Topologically,
this characterizes the closure of S under the topology induced by the metric.
Lemma 5.1 Let X be a metric space, x ∈X a point, and S ⊆X a subset. The
condition d(x, S) = 0 is equivalent to x ∈S. In words: x has zero distance to S if,
and only if, x belongs to the closure of S.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that x ∈S and we show that d(x, S) = 0. Consider an arbitrary
ε > 0 and the open ball Bε(x). Since it is an open set it intersects S so there is a point
s ∈S with d(x, s) < ε. But then
d(x, S) ≤d(x, s) < ε

5.1 Metric and Topological Considerations
179
and as ε > 0 was arbitrary it follows that d(x, S) = 0. In the other direction, suppose
that d(x, S) = 0 and consider an arbitrary open set with x ∈U. In order to show that
x ∈S we must show that U ∩S ̸= ∅. Since U is open there is ε > 0 with Bε(x) ⊆U.
But then, since
ε > 0 = d(x, S) = inf
s∈S d(x, s)
there is s ∈S with ε ≥d(x, s). In other words, s belongs to the open ball Bε(x) and
so we found a point common to it and S, as was the aim.
□
Corollary 5.1 A subset C ⊆X in a metric space is closed if, and only if,
x ∈C ⇐⇒d(x, C) = 0
for all x ∈X.
Directly in terms of the norm, the closure of S in V is the set of all vectors x ∈V
that are zero distance from S, i.e.,
S = {x ∈V | d(x, S) = 0}
where
d(x, S) = inf
s∈S ∥x −s∥.
We illustrate this characterization of closedness in terms of distance as follows. Note
that a sequence xn converges in V to x implies that d(x, S) = 0 where S = {xn | n ∈
N} is the set of values of the sequence. Conversely, if d(x, S) = 0, then there exists
a sequence in S converging to x.
5.1.4
The Operator Norm
The norm ∥x∥in a normed space represents the length of the vector x. Given an
operator A between normed spaces it is natural to study the way the operator affects
the norm, that is how ∥x∥and ∥Ax∥are related. If the operator does not alter the
norm of any vector by more than some constant factor, then it is said to be bounded.
This class of operators is studied more extensively in Chap. 6. Linear operators will
typically be denoted by A or B and their values on vectors x by A(x) or simply Ax.
Deﬁnition 5.4 An operator A : V →W between normed spaces is called a bounded
operator if there exists a real number M such that
∥Ax∥≤M∥x∥
for all x ∈V .

180
5
A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
Equivalently, an operator A is bounded if it maps bounded sets in the domain to
bounded sets in the codomain (where a set S of vectors in a normed space is bounded
if there exists a positive M such that ∥s∥≤M for all s ∈S).
Example 5.1 A simple example was already encountered in Theorem 5.2; the func-
tion Aα : V →V , clearly a linear operator, is shown there to be bounded. For
an unbounded example consider the space c00 with the ℓp norm ∥−∥p for any
1 ≤p ≤∞. Let A: c00 →c00 be given by
A(ξ1, . . . , ξn, . . . ) = (ξ1, 2ξ2, 3ξ3, . . . , nξn, . . . )
and note that it is a linear operator. It is seen to be unbounded by considering the
standard basis vectors since ∥A(en)∥p = n while ∥en∥= 1.
The situation in the ﬁnite dimensional case is very convenient.
Proposition 5.5 Any linear operator A: V →W between normed spaces where V
is ﬁnite-dimensional is bounded.
The proof is deferred to the exercises.
The interplay between the linear structure and the topology in a normed space
implies a strong uniﬁcation of concepts.
Theorem 5.3 The following conditions for a linear operator A : V →W between
normed spaces are equivalent.
1. A is uniformly continuous.
2. A is continuous.
3. A is continuous at x = 0.
4. A is bounded.
Proof Obviously, uniform continuity implies continuity, and continuity implies con-
tinuity at x = 0. Suppose now that A is continuous at x = 0. Then there exists a δ > 0
such that ∥Ax∥≤1 for all x ∈V with ∥x∥< 2δ. Now, given an arbitrary y ∈V ,
if y = 0, then Ay = 0 while if y ̸= 0, then, noting that ∥δy/∥y∥∥= δ < 2δ, one
obtains that
∥Ay∥= ∥Aδ∥y∥y
δ∥y∥∥= ∥y∥
δ ∥A δy
∥y∥∥≤1
δ ∥y∥,
showing that A is bounded by 1/δ. Finally, if A is bounded by some M > 0, then
∥Ax −Ax′∥= ∥A(x −x′)∥≤M∥x −x′∥, for all x, x′ ∈V , and thus uniform con-
tinuity follows easily.
□
For a bounded operator A the inequality ∥Ax∥≤M∥x∥sets an upper bound on how
much A can distort the length of vectors in the domain. It is natural to consider the
inﬁmum over all such upper bounds M and deﬁne that to be the norm of the operator
A.

5.1 Metric and Topological Considerations
181
Deﬁnition 5.5 Let A : V →W be a linear operator. The operator norm or simply
the norm of A is deﬁned to be
∥A∥= inf{M ≥0 | ∀x ∈V
∥Ax∥≤M∥x∥}
adopting the convention that inf ∅= ∞.
Thus, a linear operator is bounded if, and only if, its norm is ﬁnite.
Example 5.2 Continuing Example 5.1, directly evaluating the relevant inﬁmum
shows that ∥Aα∥= |α|.
The homogeneity of the norm together with continuity considerations give rise to
the following expressions for the operator norm.
Proposition 5.6 Foraboundedlinearoperator A : V →W betweennormedspaces
the following expressions are all equal to ∥A∥.
1. sup{∥Ax∥| x ∈V,
∥x∥≤1}.
2. sup{∥Ax∥| x ∈V,
∥x∥< 1}.
3. sup{∥Ax∥| x ∈V,
∥x∥= 1}.
4. sup{∥Ax∥/∥x∥| x ∈V,
x ̸= 0}.
The proof is left for the reader.
In general, any bounded operator, simply since it is continuous, is determined by
its values on a dense subset. However, not any bounded operator on a dense subset
can be extended to the full domain. The next result shows that when the codomain
is complete this difﬁculty disappears.
Theorem 5.4 Let V be a normed space, D ⊆V a dense linear subspace of V , and
B a complete normed space. If A : D →B is a bounded linear operator, then there
exists a unique linear operator B : V →B such that Bx = Ax for all x ∈D and
∥B∥= ∥A∥. Such a B is called an extension of A.
Proof Given x0 ∈V let {xm}m≥1 be a sequence in D with xm →x0. Since a bounded
linear operator is uniformly continuous we may apply the extension principle of
Theorem 4.8 to obtain a function B : V →B that extends A. In particular, for every
x ∈V and a sequence in D with xm →x we have Axm →Bx. This extension is
unique so it remains to verify the required properties of B.
That B is linear is seen as follows. If x, y ∈V and xm →x and ym →y are as
above, then it follows that xm + ym →x + y and thus
B(x + y) = lim
m→∞A(xm + ym) = lim
m→∞Axm + lim
m→∞Aym = Bx + By.
A similar argument shows that B(αx) = α(Bx). As for showing that ∥A∥= ∥B∥,
note ﬁrst that ∥A∥≤∥B∥just by the fact that B is an extension of A. Next, for x ∈V
and xm →x0 as above, one has

182
5
A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
∥Axm∥≤∥A∥∥xm∥
and passing to the limit, and remembering that the norm is continuous, we obtain
∥Bx∥≤∥A∥∥x∥
showing that ∥B∥≤∥A∥, and thus the desired equality holds.
□
Another consequence of the extension principle of uniformly continuous functions
to complete spaces implies that the completion of a normed space V inherits the
structure and becomes itself a normed space.
Theorem 5.5 Let V be a normed space with its induced metric structure, and let
ι : (V, d) →( ˆV , ˆd) be a completion of it. Then the linear structure of V extends to
ˆV and so does the norm, making ˆV a normed space. Moreover, ˆV is complete in its
induced norm.
Proof The proof is very similar to the proof of Theorem 5.4. The ﬁrst step is to
note that by Theorem 5.2 the structure mappings of V are all uniformly continuous
so each can be extended as long as the codomain is complete. In more detail, the
norm function ∥−∥: V →R is uniformly continuous and so Theorem 4.8 provides
us with an extension 
∥−∥: ˆV →R since R is complete. The linear structure of V
extends to a linear structure on ˆV via the inclusion V →ˆV , as follows. For any scalar
α, the function Aα : V →ˆV from Example 5.1 is uniformly continuous thus extends
to ˆV and provides it with a scalar product. Vector addition is extended similarly and
all of the linear space axioms and norm axioms then follow by a limit argument as
was done in the proof of Theorem 5.4.
□
Finally, we give here the way of comparing two different normed spaces.
Deﬁnition 5.6 A function A : V →W between two normed spaces is a linear isom-
etry if A is a linear isomorphism that respects the norms in the sense that ∥Ax∥= ∥x∥
for all x ∈V .
One can easily verify that a function A : V →W is a linear isometry if, and only if,
it is a linear isomorphism that is also an isometry with respect to the induced metrics
on V and W.

5.2
Finite-Dimensional Spaces
Inelementarylinearalgebratheﬁnite-dimensionalspacesRn andCn arefamiliarboth
as inner product spaces and with various other norms introduced such as ∥−∥1 and
∥−∥∞. These are thus in particular examples of metric spaces and therefore carry
an induced topology. Contrary to the inﬁnite-dimensional situation the compatibility
of the linear structure and the topology is as good as one can desire: all such spaces
are complete, all linear operators between them are continuous, every subspace is
closed, and so on. We will not prove these facts here since the details of the proofs
are not of particular interest. It sufﬁces to remember that topological considerations
are rarely an issue for ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces.
What this section does demonstrate is an even stronger fact: all norms on a given
ﬁnite-dimensional linear space are equivalent, i.e., they induce the same topology.
In the context of applications to physics, the inﬁnite-dimensional spaces are vital for
quantum mechanics while their less exotic ﬁnite-dimensional brothers are the foun-
dations of quantum computation and quantum information theory. However, ﬁnite-
dimensional spaces serve as the building blocks of many of the inﬁnite-dimensional
ones used in quantum mechanics.
5.2.1
All Norms are Equivalent
In the ﬁnite-dimensional case topological issues rarely play any role. Part of the rea-
son is that the induced topology in a ﬁnite-dimensional normed space is independent
of the norm.
Theorem 5.6 For n ≥1 all norms on Rn are equivalent and all norms on Cn are
equivalent.
Proof The details in each case are similar so we only give the details for Rn. First, by
Proposition 5.3 norm equivalence is an equivalence relation and so it sufﬁces to show
that an arbitrary norm ∥−∥on Rn, that we now ﬁx, is equivalent to the particular
norm
∥x∥1 =
n

i=1
|ξi|
where we write x = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) for a typical vector in Rn. Using the standard basis
e1, . . . , en ∈Rn we compute
∥x∥= ∥
n

i=1
ξiei∥≤
n

i=1
|ξi|∥ei∥
so if we denote

186

A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
β = max
1≤i≤n ∥ei∥
then
∥x∥≤β
n

i=1
|ξi| = β∥x∥1
for all x ∈Rn. By Proposition 5.1 the topology induced by ∥−∥is coarser than the
one induced by ∥−∥1. This implies that ∥−∥: Rn →R is continuous with respect
to the norm ∥−∥1. To see that, recall that what we need to show is that if U ⊆R
is open, then ∥−∥−1(U) is open in Rn with respect to ∥−∥1. But, any norm is
continuous with respect to itself and thus ∥−∥−1(U) is open in Rn with respect to
∥−∥, and any open set with respect to ∥−∥is also open with respect to ∥−∥1.
By Weierstrass’ Theorem (Exercise 4.68) any real-valued continuous function on
a non-empty compact set attains its minimum. The unit sphere S = {x ∈R | ∥x∥1 =
1} is a closed and bounded set and thus, by Exercise 4.74, S is compact (this is
where the ﬁnite-dimensionality assumption is crucial, cf. Exercise 5.24). Therefore,
∥−∥: S →R attains its minimum, say
∥xm∥= α
where
α = min{∥x∥| x ∈S}
and xm ∈S. Let y ∈Rn be arbitrary and non-zero and write x = y/∥y∥1. Then x ∈S
and so
α = ∥xm∥≤∥x∥= ∥y∥
∥y∥1
and thus
α∥y∥1 ≤∥y∥.
Finally we conclude that
α∥y∥1 ≤∥y∥≤β∥y∥1
holds for all y ∈Rn (since for y = 0 it certainly holds). To conclude that ∥−∥
and ∥−∥1 are equivalent it remains to show that α > 0. If that was not the case
then, as a minimum of non-negative values, α = 0. But then ∥xm∥= 0 holds which
axiomatically forces xm = 0 and thus ∥xm∥1 = 0, contrary to xm ∈S. The two norms
are thus equivalent.
□
Proposition 5.7 A linear space V is ﬁnite dimensional if, and only if, all norms on
it are equivalent.
Proof Theorem 5.6 establishes that all norms on Rn and Cn are equivalent. The
proof can easily be adapted to show that all norms on a ﬁnite-dimensional linear

5.2 Finite-Dimensional Spaces
187
space are equivalent. For the converse we show that an inﬁnite-dimensional linear
space V carries at least two inequivalent norms. By the Axiom of Choice there exists
a Hamel basis T for V . Thus each vector x ∈V can be written uniquely as
x =

t∈T
αt(x) · t
where {αt(x)}t∈T are scalars that depend on x and, for each x, only ﬁnitely many of
them are non-zero. Therefore the deﬁnitions
∥x∥1 =

t∈T
|αt(x)| and ∥x∥∞= max
t∈T {|αt(x)|}
are justiﬁed as the sum is ﬁnite and the maximum exists. The veriﬁcation that ∥−∥1
and ∥−∥∞are norms on V is straightforward and so it remains to see why they are
not equivalent. Since V is inﬁnite dimensional the set T is inﬁnite and we may list
inﬁnitely many distinct vectors in it, say, {ti}i∈N. Clearly, ∥x∥∞≤∥x∥1 so suppose
∥x∥1 ≤β∥x∥∞is true for some constant β > 0 and all x ∈V . In particular then, for

when p = ∞. We know that all of these norms on any given Cn are equivalent
and thus induce the same topology on Cn (necessarily the Euclidean topology). In
particular, for all 1 ≤p, q ≤∞there exist constants α, β > 0 with

Spaces of polynomials were considered in Example 2.23. We write here Pn for
the linear space of all polynomials of degree strictly smaller than n with complex
coefﬁcients. It is a linear space of dimension n and thus isomorphic to Cn. Fix an
interval I = [a, b], and with reference to Sect. 2.5.5, we obtain for all 1 ≤p < ∞
the L p norm on Pn by

Abstractly, since Pn ∼= Cn, the two spaces are essentially the same and topologically
the norms are indistinguishable. But there is a signiﬁcant difference that we now
clarify.
For all n ≥1 and 1 ≤k ≤n let evk : Cn →C be the evaluation of the k-th com-
ponent function

5.2 Finite-Dimensional Spaces
189
evn,k(ξ1, . . . , ξn) = ξk.
For t0 ∈[a, b] let evn,t0 : Pn →C be the evaluation at t0 function
evn,t0(x) = x(t0).
It is immediate that these are linear operators. The norms of these operators reveal
important subtleties.
Proposition 5.8 Let 1 ≤p ≤∞and consider Cn with the ℓp norm ∥−∥p. Then,
given k ≥1, there exists an M such that ∥evn,k∥≤M for all n ≥k.
Proof Clearly each operator is bounded since it is deﬁned on a ﬁnite-dimensional
space. The uniform bound is easily seen to be M = 1 by direct computation, left as
an exercise.
□
Stated differently, the operators {evn,k}n≥k are bounded uniformly. The situation is
very different for the spaces of polynomials.
Proposition 5.9 Let 1 ≤p ≤∞and consider Pn with the L p norm. Then, given
t0 ∈[a, b], the operators {evn,t0}n≥1 are bounded but only uniformly bounded for
p = ∞.
Proof The fact that each operator is bounded is, again, immediate from ﬁnite dimen-
sionality. In the case p = ∞it is immediate that ∥evn,t0∥= 1. For 1 ≤p < ∞it
sufﬁces to ﬁnd, for each n ≥1, a vector xn ∈Pn that evaluates to 1 at t0 while
∥x∥p ≤1/n. Assuming for simplicity, that [a, b] = [0, 1], t0 = 1, and p = 1 we can
take xn(t) = tn−1 by a direct evaluation of the norm. It is left for the reader to handle
the general case.
□
We conclude this section by noting that while on any ﬁnite-dimensional linear
space all norms are equivalent in the topological sense they certainly are not equiv-
alent metrically: a ﬁnite-dimensional linear space typically supports inﬁnitely many
non-isometric norms. A glimpse is offered in the exercises.
Exercises
Exercise 5.22 Prove the norms in the proof of Proposition 5.7 are indeed norms.
Exercise 5.23 Complete the proof of Theorem 5.7, verify the case q = ∞, and show

norm of the resulting isomorphism?
5.3
Countable-Dimensional Sequence and Function Spaces
We move beyond the ﬁnite-dimensional spaces to the next cadinality. This is done
through the formalism of colimits thus emphasizing the link to the ﬁnite-dimensional
spaces and setting up a convenient bridge to transfer information from the familiar
ﬁnite-dimensional case to inﬁnite dimensions.
Recall the ﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces Cn and Pn from Sect. 5.2.2.
5.3.1
The Space c00 as a Colimit
The space c00 of all sequences that are eventually 0 is, in some sense, the simplest
inﬁnite-dimensional space. We can precisely pinpoint this intuition in the concept of
a colimit—a fundamental concept in category theory. We shall not develop any of
the general theory here but rather present the concept just for our cases of interest.
Recall that for concreteness we are assuming all linear spaces are over C. Consider
the diagram

5.3 Countable-Dimensional Sequence and Function Spaces
191
where the top row is inﬁnite and contains all the spaces Cn, n ≥0, (by convention
C0 = {0}, the trivial linear space) and each of the arrows is a linear operator with
in : Cn →Cn+1 given by
in(ξ1, . . . , ξn) = (ξ1, . . . , ξn, 0).
Such a collection of linear spaces and linear operators is called a diagram of linear
spaces. Of the two spaces appearing at the bottom part of the diagram let us focus
ﬁrst on c00. Each of the arrows leading to it is a linear operator with ιn : Cn →c00
given by
ιn(ξ1, . . . , ξn) = (ξ1, . . . , ξn, 0, 0, . . . ).
We note that each triangle in the diagram consisting of solid arrows commutes in the
sense that for all n ≥0
ιn = ιn+1 ◦in
so that tracing the triangle along one side or along the other two, following the
directions of the arrows, results in the same overall process. The veriﬁcation of the
commutativity of the triangle is done by computing on a generic element:
ιn(ξ1, . . . , ξn) = (ξ1, . . . , ξn, 0, 0, . . . )
ιn+1(in(ξ1, . . . , ξn)) = ιn+1(ξ1, . . . , ξn, 0) = (ξ1, . . . , ξn, 0, 0, . . . )
leading to the same result (in words, ι appends inﬁnitely many 0’s while i appends
only one, but appending ﬁrst one 0 and then inﬁnitely many more is the same as
just appending inﬁnitely many to start with). The linear space c00 together with the
solid arrows from the diagram to it satisfying the commutativity of each triangle is
called a cone from the diagram to c00. We now turn to the portion of the diagram that
contains the ∀symbols. It states the condition that is required for the dashed arrow to
exist: for any other cone from the diagram to an arbitrary linear space V the dashed
arrow exists. In more detail, it reads as: for all linear spaces V and linear operators
An : Cn →V , one for each n ≥0, such that each triangle commutes, namely
An = An+1 ◦in
for all n ≥0, a unique dashed arrow exists. The precise meaning of the dashed arrow
is that it is a linear operator that factorizes the cone to V via the cone to c00. In more
detail, it is a linear operator A: c00 →V such that

192
5
A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
An = A ◦ιn
for all n ≥0.
Let us verify that the space c00 has the property that any cone from the diagram
to an arbitrary linear space V , given by a compatible family of linear operators
An : Cn →V , factorizes uniquely via a dashed arrow A: c00 →V as in the diagram.
Firstly, note that while no single ιn : Cn →c00 is surjective, the entire collection
{ιn}n≥1 is surjective in the sense that for all x ∈c00 there exists n ≥1 and xn ∈Cn
with x = ιn(xn). Therefore, the condition An = A ◦ιn forces the deﬁnition of A to
be
A(x) = A(ιn(xn)) = An(xn)
so if an extension exists it is unique and given by this formula. Before verifying that
this deﬁnition indeed gives rise to a linear operator we must verify it is well deﬁned,
but this is a direct consequence of the compatibility among the An (see Exercise 5.33).
It remains to show that A is a linear operator. We repeatedly use the fact that if
x = ιn(xn), then A(x) = An(xn). If x = ιn(xn), then αx = ιn(αxn) by homogeneity
of ιn, and so
A(αx) = An(αxn) = αAn(xn) = αA(x)
so A is homogeneous. For additivity, given x = ιn(xn) and y = ιm(ym) the com-
patibility in the cone condition implies that we may assume m = n, and then
x + y = ιn(xn + yn) so
A(x + y) = An(xn + yn) = An(xn) + A(yn) = A(x) + A(y)
as required.
This universal property of c00 with respect to the diagram of inclusions Cn →
Cn+1 as above is said to make c00 the colimit of the diagram.
5.3.2
The Space P as a Colimit
The space P of all polynomials, considered as functions over the ﬁxed interval [a, b],
isanotherinﬁnite-dimensionallinearspaceenjoyingastraightforwarddeﬁnition.Just
as c00 is built as a colimit of a diagram of the ﬁnite-dimensional building blocks Cn,
so is P, the space of all polynomials, a colimit of a diagram consisting of the ﬁnite-
dimensional spaces Pn. Since the details are very similar we proceed more rapidly.
The point to pay attention to is the emphasis we give to the arrows rather than to the
linear spaces themselves.
Consider the diagram

5.3 Countable-Dimensional Sequence and Function Spaces
193
where the top row is inﬁnite and contains all the polynomial spaces Pn, n ≥0, and
each of the arrows is a linear operator. By convention, P0 = {0}, consisting of the
0 function. Since Pn ⊆Pn+1 we may simply take each in : Pn →Pn+1 to be the
inclusion function. Moreover, Pn ⊆P and so we may also take each ιn : Pn →P to
be given by inclusion. In such a way we obtain a cone from the diagram to P since
obviously
ιn = ιn+1 ◦in
as either side of the equation is simply the inclusion function.
The rest of the diagram deciphers in exactly the same way as was the case for
c00 and the veriﬁcation of the relevant claims is just as easy (if not easier). In detail,
given any other cone from the diagram to an arbitrary linear space V , namely
An = An+1 ◦ιn
for all n ≥0, a unique linear operator A: P →V exists that factorizes the cone to
V via the cone to P in the sense that
An = A ◦ιn
for all n ≥0.
The formal similarity between c00 and P is now in place: c00 is the colimit of the
diagram of inclusions Cn →Cn+1 and P is the colimit of the diagram of inclusions
Pn →Pn+1. Note that the most natural choice of an isomorphism Pn →Cn is itself
compatible with the diagram structures and so one may consider the diagrams as
a whole to be isomorphic entities (see Exercise 5.35). Consequently, the respective
colimits are isomorphic, i.e., P ∼= c00, as can easily be seen directly. Nonetheless, we
shall see below that different choices of norms on the building blocks in each case
lead to radically different structures on the colimits.
5.3.3
Norm Extension
The colimit expressions for c00 and P is a bridge from the ﬁnite-dimensional building
blocks to the inﬁnite-dimensional linear space. One would expect the transfer of
structure along this bridge. This is indeed possible.

194

A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
Consider the diagram from the previous section expressing c00 as a colimit and
assume further that each Cn is given a norm.
Theorem 5.8 Consider the diagram
where {∥−∥n : Cn →R}n≥0 is a family of norms. If the given norms are compatible
in the sense that ∥−∥n = ∥in(−)∥n+1, then there exists a unique norm ∥−∥: c00 →
R such that ∥ιn(−)∥= ∥−∥n. Moreover, in such a situation the operators ιn are all
of norm 1.
Proof The arguments are very similar to those given when showing the universal
property of c00. We start again with the observation that the collection {ιn}n≥1 is
surjective in the sense that for all x ∈c00 there exists n ≥0 and xn ∈Cn with x =
ιn(xn). Therefore, the condition ∥ιn(−)∥= ∥−∥n forces the deﬁnition of ∥−∥to
be
∥x∥= ∥ιn(xn)∥= ∥xn∥n
so if an extension exists it is unique and given by this formula. The requirement that
the norms are compatible, i.e., ∥−∥n = ∥in(−)∥n+1, implies independence from
the precise value of n when writing x = ιn(xn) so ∥x∥is well deﬁned. Armed with
the knowledge that ∥x∥= ∥xn∥n whenever x = ιn(xn) we can proceed to verify the
norm axioms. We shall only show
∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥
leaving the rest as an exercise. We choose m, n ≥1, xn ∈Cn, and ym ∈Cm with
x = ιn(xn) and y = ιm(ym). The same argument as above allows us to assume that
m = n. We can therefore compute as follows
∥x + y∥= ∥ιn(xn) + ιn(yn)∥= ∥ιn(xn + yn)∥= ∥xn + yn∥n ≤
≤∥xn∥n + ∥yn∥n = ∥ιn(x)∥+ ∥ιn(y)∥= ∥x∥+ ∥y∥
as required. With the norm in place verifying that each ιn has norm 1 is
immediate.

5.3.4
Operator Extension and Boundedness
The expression of c00 as a colimit means a linear operator out of c00 is equivalently
described as a compatible family of linear operators on the ﬁnite-dimensional linear
spaces Cn. We have seen that if each Cn is a normed space and the norms are suitably
compatible, then the norms extend to c00. In the presence of such norms it is then
natural to consider the boundedness of the operators involved. In the statement of
the next result refer to the diagram
which is the description of c00 as a colimit fortiﬁed with norms.
Theorem 5.9 Consider c00 as a colimit where each Cn is endowed with a norm, the
norms are compatible, and have been extended to a norm on c00 as in Theorem 5.8.
Suppose further that compatible linear operators An : Cn →V to some normed
space V are given and let A: c00 →V be the linear operator they extend to. Then
∥A∥= sup
n≥0
∥An∥
namely A is bounded if, and only if, the supremum is ﬁnite and in that case the
supremum is the operator norm of A.
Proof The proof relies on the fact that ∥x∥= ∥xn∥n and A(x) = An(xn) whenever
x = ιn(xn) independently of n. We write M = supn≥0 ∥An∥. First we have
∥A(x)∥= ∥An(xn)∥≤∥An∥∥xn∥n = ∥An∥∥x∥≤M∥x∥
andso∥A∥≤M.Nowﬁxε > 0 andchoosen ≥0 with∥An∥> M −ε.Thenchoose
xn ∈Cn with ∥An(xn)∥> (M −ε)∥xn∥n. It follows for x = ιn(xn) that
∥A(x)∥= ∥An(xn)∥> (M −ε)∥xn∥n = (M −ε)∥x∥
and so ∥A∥≥M −ε. As ε was arbitrary we conclude that ∥A∥≥M and as
∥A∥≤M was already established the desired equality follows.
□
The formal similarly between c00 and P, each being a colimit of a diagram of
inclusions, implies a norm extension and operator extension results for spaces of
polynomials. We leave it to the reader to draw the relevant diagrams accompanying
the claim.
Theorem 5.10 If each Pn, n ≥0, is endowed with a norm and the norms are com-
patible with respect to the inclusions Pn →Pn+1, then there is a unique norm on P

196

A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
extending the given norms, and then the canonical operators ιn are of norm 1. More-
over, if compatible operators An : Pn →V are given, then the induced operator
A: P →V satisﬁes
∥A∥= sup
n≥0
∥An∥.
Proof A careful consideration of the proofs of the analogous results about c00 reveals
that they were formulated entirely in terms of properties of the arrows appearing in
the diagram expressing c00 as a colimit. The arrows in the diagram for P as a colimit
satisfy the same properties and thus the same proof is still valid.
□
This diagrammatic reasoning is at once a labor saving formalism and a conceptual
tool. We shall use the results of this section in the remaining chapter and note here
that the categorical approach can be utilized much further than we are doing (see
[3]).

5.4
The Classical Sequence and Function Spaces
The previous section, where c00 was described as the colimit of the diagram of
inclusions Cn →Cn+1 and P was presented as the colimit of the similar diagram
of inclusions Pn →Pn+1, was designed to enable the following presentation of the
classical sequence spaces ℓp and function spaces L p. Remember that the polynomials
in the polynomial spaces are considered as functions on some ﬁxed interval [a, b].
5.4.1
From Finite Dimensions to the Classical Spaces
Let 1 ≤p ≤∞and endow each of Cn and Pn with its ∥−∥p norm. It is easily
seen that the norms on the diagram of the spaces Cn are compatible and thus, by
Theorem 5.8, they extend to a norm ∥−∥p on c00. Similarly, the norms on the
diagram of the spaces Pn are compatible and thus extend to a norm ∥−∥p on P by
Theorem 5.10. With these norms the spaces c00 and P are not complete.
5.4.1.1
The Case p ̸= ∞
We deﬁne the classical spaces ℓp and L p for 1 ≤p < ∞by means of the machinery
developed in this chapter.
Deﬁnition 5.7 Let 1 ≤p < ∞. The classical sequence space ℓp is the completion
of c00 with respect to the norm ∥−∥p obtained by extension of the norms ∥−∥p on
the spaces Cn. The classical function space L p = L p([a, b], C) is the completion of
P with respect to the norm ∥−∥p obtained by extension of the norms ∥−∥p on the
spaces Pn.
This sort of deﬁnition describes a mathematical object not by construction but
by its relation to other spaces. In particular, such an object is only deﬁned up to
isomorphism (by Theorem 4.12 any two completions of the same metric space are
isometrically isomorphic). The conjunction of a particular model of the mathematical
object together with an understanding of its relation to other objects is most fruitful,
offering different perspectives. We illustrate that for the ℓp and L p spaces as just

198
5
A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
deﬁned. Since ℓp is now deﬁned as the completion of c00 with respect to ∥−∥p two
facts are obvious.
Theorem 5.11 For 1 ≤p < ∞the space ℓp is a complete normed space and c00 is
dense in it.
Proof By Theorem 5.5 the linear structure of c00 and its norm extend uniquely to
the completion, making it a complete normed space. By the very deﬁnition of the
completion of a metric space (Deﬁnition 4.16) c00 is dense in its completion ℓp.
The fact that any metric space admits a completion was outlined toward the end of
Sect. 4.4.4.
□
One may follow the instructions for the construction of the completion of c00 and
obtain a more explicit description of ℓp. However, the result would be very cumber-
some to work with. It is therefore of great interest that a much simpler model exists,
allowing us, equivalently, to deﬁne ℓp by means of p-power summable sequences as
in Example 2.25. The tradeoff is that with that particular model Theorem 5.11 ceases
to be obvious and requires a more elaborate proof.
Theorem 5.12 Consider the sequence model of ℓp with the norm ∥−∥deﬁned
explicitly as an inﬁnite sum, i.e., the vectors in ℓp are sequences x for which
∞

n=1
|ξn|p
converges and the norm is given by
∥x∥p =
 ∞

n=1
|ξn|p
1/p
for all vectors x ∈ℓp. Then ℓp is complete and c00 is dense in it.
Proof The completeness of ℓp was shown in Example 4.19. Density of c00 in ℓp
amounts to the property that tails of convergent series can be made arbitrarily small:
given a vector (ξ1, . . . , ξk, . . . ) ∈ℓp the vectors xn = (ξ1, . . . , ξn, 0, 0, . . . ) ∈c00
converge to x precisely because ∥x −xn∥p
p is a tail of the convergent series
∞

n=1
|ξn|p
and so vanish to 0 as n tends to ∞.
□
Let us now turn to the L p spaces. Since L p was deﬁned as the completion of P
two facts are again self-evident.
Theorem 5.13 For 1 ≤p < ∞the space L p = L p([a, b], C) is a complete normed
space and P is dense in it.

5.4 The Classical Sequence and Function Spaces
199
Proof Formally identical to the proof of Theorem 5.11.
□
For ℓp it is the case that a model of the completion of c00 exists in terms of inﬁnite
sequences. One would expect, or at least hope, that for L p a model of the completion
of P exists in terms of functions. This is the case but the situation is complicated: for
ﬁxed k the evaluation functionals on Cn are uniformly bounded (Proposition 5.8) and
thus extend (by Theorem 5.9) to an evaluation functional on c00 which then extends
to an evaluation functional on ℓp (by Theorem 5.4) but for ﬁxed t0 the evaluation
functionals on Pn are not uniformly bounded (Proposition 5.9) so that L p lacks
evaluation functionals. This situation suggests that the vectors in L p are not quite
functions. Therefore the following analogue of Theorem 5.12 is considerably deeper
and unavoidably subtler.
Theorem 5.14 There exists a model of L p = L p([a, b], C) whose elements are
equivalence classes of functions on [a, b]. The representatives are called Lebesgue
measurable functions, the equivalence relation is agreement modulo sets of measure
zero, and the norm is given in terms of the Lebesgue integral. In particular, L p is
complete and P is dense in it.
Each of the claims made requires a healthy dose of measure theory and falls well
outside the scope of this book.
5.4.1.2
The Case p = ∞
In the discussion of the classical spaces thus far the case p = ∞was excluded. To
be clear, the completion of c00 with respect to ∥−∥∞certainly exists, as does the
completion of P, but these are not the spaces ℓ∞and L∞, respectively. The reason,
in a sense, is that these completions are too small. It is still interesting to identify
explicit models for these completions and observe a difference when compared to
the case p ̸= ∞.
Theorem 5.15 The space c0 of sequences of complex numbers that converge to 0 is
the completion of c00 with respect to the norm ∥−∥∞.
Proof What needs to be shown is that c0 is complete and that c00 is dense in c0, all
with respect to the norm ∥−∥∞. Both claims are elementary observations regarding
the deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence. In some more detail, if {xn}n≥is a Cauchy
sequence in c0, then by evaluation at k we obtain a Cauchy sequence of complex
numbers {evk(xn)}n≥1, which thus converges (since C is complete). We therefore
have a candidate vector x for the limit of the sequence {xn}n≥1, i.e., the sequence x
satisfying evk(xn) →evk(x). Showing that x ∈c0 and that xn →x follows easily
from the rather strong consequences of the norm ∥−∥∞. Finally, for the density of
c00, an arbitrary x ∈c0 is the limit of its truncations, i.e., assuming x = (ξ1, ξ2, . . . )
setting
xn = (ξ1, . . . , ξn, 0, 0, . . . )

as needed.
□
As expected, the function space offers a greater challenge. The completion of P
with respect to ∥−∥∞is familiar but proving so is a signiﬁcant theorem.
Theorem 5.16 The completion of P with respect to ∥−∥∞is the space C([a, b], C)
of continuous functions on [a, b].
Proof The fact that C([a, b], C) is complete is shown just as the case for real-
valued functions in Example 4.16. The density of P in C([a, b], C) is, precisely,
the Weierstrass approximation theorem—a standard result in analysis but not an
elementary one.
□
Remark 5.1 To the reader familiar with holomorphic functions we note that if
instead of complex polynomials on [a, b] one considers complex polynomials on,
say, the unit disk in C, then the completion of P is the space of all continuous complex-
valued function on the unit disk that are holomorphic in its interior. The much larger
space of continuous complex-valued functions on the disk is the completion of a
variant of P, namely the space of complex polynomials in both z and ¯z. Both of these
are important spaces which, as we see, also arise in a similar fashion to the spaces
we are considering.
At this point we observe a signiﬁcant difference between ℓp and c0 for all 1 ≤
p < ∞, providing a ﬁrst indication that c0 is too small.
Deﬁnition 5.8 A sequence {xn}n≥1 in ℓp is advancing if there exists a sequence
{ξk}k≥1 in C such that
xn = (ξ1, . . . , ξn, 0, 0, . . . )
for all n ≥1.
Proposition 5.10 For 1 ≤p < ∞every bounded advancing sequence {xn}n≥1 in
ℓp converges, but the same is not true in c0.
Proof Let ξ = {ξk}k≥1 be the sequence realizing the advancement of the given
sequence. The assumption on the sequence being bounded implies the existence
of M with
∥xn∥p
p =

are bounded and so the series converges. Therefore, the vector
ξ = (ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξn, . . . )
belongs to ℓp and clearly
lim
n→∞∥xn −ξ∥p = 0
so xn →ξ in ℓp. A counterexample in c0 is, for instance, given by
xn = (1, 1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . )
with n 1s followed by 0s: clearly ∥xn∥∞= 1 so the sequence is bounded but
∥xn −xm∥∞= 1 for all n ̸= m so the sequence is not Cauchy and thus fails to
converge.
□
At the heart of the argument in the proof is the property that in R a bounded monotone
sequence converges. This fact is equivalent to the completeness of R. In a sense, ℓp
is large enough to include any sequence whose initial segments all belong to ℓp. The
space c0 is not large enough to possess this property.
Remark 5.2 Asimilarphenomenondistinguishesqualitativelybetween L p and L∞.
The details require measure theory.
Let us summarize the results above.
Theorem 5.17 For all 1 ≤p < ∞the spaces ℓp and L p, each with its ∥−∥p norm,
is complete. Each sequence space ℓp is the completion of the colimit of the diagram
of inclusions Cn →Cn+1 as normed spaces. There exists an explicit model of ℓp in
terms of sequences. Each function space L p is the completion of the colimit of the
diagram of inclusions Pn →Pn+1 as normed spaces. There exists an explicit model
of L p in terms of equivalence classes of functions. The only spaces in which the norm
is induced by an inner product are ℓ2 and L2.
Proposition 5.10 is a ﬁrst indication that c0 is too small and does not quite ﬁt in
the tower of ℓp spaces, and similarly that C([a, b], C) does not belong to the family
of L p spaces. We complete the picture now with a discussion of ℓ∞and L∞. By now
we should expect the function space case to be more demanding. The space ℓ∞is the
space of all bounded sequences of complex numbers with the supremum norm (see
Sect. 2.5.4). The space L∞is, just like the L p spaces, not quite a space of functions
due to a lack of evaluation functionals. The vectors in L∞are equivalence classes
of essentially bounded functions and the norm is given by the essential supremum.
These notions, again, require some measure theory and are thus not included here.
5.4.2
Summation and Integration
Consider on Cn the summation function σn : Cn →C given by

202
5
A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
σn(ξ1, . . . , ξn) =
n

k=1
ξk
which is clearly a linear operator and thus bounded with respect to any one of the
norms ∥−∥p, 1 ≤p ≤∞(or any other norm).
Proposition 5.11 The collection {σn}n≥0 of all summation operators is uniformly
bounded if, and only if, p = 1.
Proof Suppose p = 1. If x = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) is an arbitrary vector in Cn, then
|σn(x)| ≤
n

i=1
|ξi| = ∥x∥1
and so ∥σn∥≤1, for all n ≥0, so the summation operators are uniformly bounded.
When 1 < p < ∞denote by 1n the vector (1, 1, . . . , 1) ∈Cn. Then ∥1n∥p = n1/p
while σn(1n) = n so
|σn(1n)| = n1−1/p∥1n∥p
showing that ∥σn∥≥n1−1/p. Therefore, the summation operators are not uniformly
bounded. The case p = ∞is similar.
□
Clearly the summation operators, for any given 1 ≤p ≤∞, are compatible and
thus form a cone from the diagram of inclusions Cn →Cn+1 to C (see Sect. 5.3.1).
By the universal property of c00 as a colimit the summation operators extend to a
summation operator c00 →C. However, by Theorem 5.9 and Proposition 5.11, only
for p = 1 is the extension bounded, and so one obtains a unique extension of the
ﬁnite summation operators to a summation operator σ∞: ℓ1 →C by Theorem 5.4.
In terms of the explicit model of ℓ1 this is a familiar linear functional.
Theorem 5.18 The linear functional σ∞: ℓ1 →C obtained as the unique extension
of the ﬁnite summation operators σn : Cn →C is the usual sum of an inﬁnite series
when ℓ1 is modelled as the set of absolutely summable sequences.
Proof The proof is essentially the elementary fact that absolute convergence of a
series implies convergence.
□
Moving the discussion to the function spaces, observe that deﬁnite integration
yields a linear functional
 b
a
dt −: Pn →C
and these are clearly compatible with the inclusions Pn →Pn+1. Again, each of these
is bounded since the linear spaces are ﬁnite-dimensional and the only question is for
which value of p are they uniformly bounded.

Proposition 5.12 The collection of the integration operators

is uniformly bounded if, and only if, p = 1.
Proof The analysis is similar in spirit to the proof of Proposition 5.11 and is left for
the reader.
□
The discussion leading to the existence of the summation functional σ∞on ℓ1 can
now be repeated verbatim (by virtue of the formally identical way in which ℓ1 and
L1 have been constructed) to conclude the existence of an integration functional on
L1. As always, its explicit description is considerably more challenging than was the
case with σ∞.
Theorem 5.19 In the measure-theoretic model of L1 the unique extension of the
Riemann integral from P to L1 is precisely the Lebesgue integral.
Proof The proof requires a substantial amount of measure theory.
□
We conclude this section by referring to [1] where a relatively recent characteri-
zation of the ℓp and the L p norms is given as the the only ones that are permutation
invariant and multiplicative with respect to a suitably deﬁned product.
Exercises

that its closure in ℓ∞with respect to ∥−∥∞is c, the space of convergent sequences.
Deﬁne l : cc →C, for a sequence x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn, t, t, t, . . . ) that is eventually
equal to t, by l(x) = t. Prove that l is non-expanding with respect to the d∞metric
on cc and the Euclidean metric on C. Conclude that l admits a unique non-expanding
extension to a function c →C. Show that this function is the operation of taking the
limit of a convergent sequence.
Exercise 5.40 In the discussion following Theorem 5.13 the evaluation functionals
evn,k : Cn →C are referenced. However, if n < k, then no such evaluation functional
exists. There are two ways to resolve this problem for any ﬁxed k ≥1: (1) keep the
colimit diagram of c00 as it is and deﬁne evn,k : Cn →C for n < k to be identically
zero; (2) remove an initial segment from the diagram deﬁning c00 so it starts with Ck
instead of C0. Show that these two approaches lead to isomorphic solutions.

Such a closed subspace is called complemented if there exists a closed linear subspace
Y such that ℓ∞= X S ⊕Y. Show that X S is complemented and that unless dim(X S)

Ker(A) and similarly for ℓo.
Exercise 5.46 In the previous exercise we obtained a decomposition of ℓp in terms
of sequences concentrated in even and odd places. In this exercise we look for a
similar decomposition for the L p spaces for 1 ≤p < ∞. The difﬁculty is that we
do not have an explicit model for L p so we proceed with the tools we have. We refer
to the construction of L p as the completion of the colimit of the polynomial space
inclusions Pn →Pn+1.

Separability and Duality
Separability tells us that topologically a space is not too big. Every point in a separable
space is accessible as the limit of a sequence constructed out of a repository of
countable size. Duality refers to the structure of bounded linear functionals on the
space. Using the expressions of the classical spaces as we have presented them we
address the separability of the classical spaces and analyse some of the structure of
their bounded linear functionals.
5.5.1
Separability
We establish the separability of ℓp and L p for 1 ≤p < ∞.

5.5 Separability and Duality
205
Proposition 5.13 For all n ≥0 the space Cn is separable with respect to any norm.
Proof By Theorem 5.6 all norms on Cn are equivalent and since separability is
a topological invariant we may assume any particular norm on Cn, so we choose
the L∞norm ∥−∥∞. We now exploit the elementary fact that Q is dense in R. It
implies at once that Q + iQ = {a + ib | a, b ∈Q} is dense in C. It can now easily
be checked directly that (Q + iQ)n is dense in Cn with respect to ∥−∥∞. Finally,
(Q + iQ)n is countable as a ﬁnite cartesian product of countable sets.
□
Corollary 5.2 All ﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces are separable.
Proof Weaddressthecomplexcase.Anyn-dimensionallinearspace V isisomorphic
to Cn and since in the ﬁnite-dimensional case all linear operators are continuous
it follows that Cn and V are homeomorphic no matter which norms are used. In
particular, the separability of Cn implies that of V .
□
Having established that separability is automatic in ﬁnite dimensions we turn to c00
and P. Each is built out of ﬁnite-dimensional spaces and so the building blocks are
separable. The diagram expressing c00 and P as colimits is itself countable and that
allows to transfer the separability from the building blocks to the colimit.
Proposition 5.14 The spaces c00 and P are separable with respect to the norm
∥−∥p for all 1 ≤p ≤∞.
Proof Let us ﬁx a value for p and proceed to exhibit a countable subset in c00 dense
with respect to ∥−∥p. By the separability of Cn there is a countable set Sn ⊆Cn
dense with respect to ∥−∥p. Using the canonical operators ιn : Cn →c00 let
S =

n≥0
ιn(Sn)
be the union of the images of the given dense sets. The fact that the norm on c00
was built by extension of the norms on Cn implies at once that S is dense in c00.
As a countable union of countable sets S is countable and thus c00 is separable.
The argument for P is formally identical since the ingredients used above were the
separability of the ﬁnite-dimensional building blocks, the compatibility of the norms,
and the countability of the diagram.
□
The ﬁnal step to the classical spaces is the completion and so we note the following.
Proposition 5.15 The completion of a separable metric space is separable.
Proof Let X be a metric space, ˆX its completion, and S ⊆X a dense subset. We
shall show that S is also dense in ˆX, implying the result. Let y ∈ˆX be arbitrary and
ﬁx ε > 0. Since X is dense in ˆX there exists x ∈X with d(x, y) < ε/2. Since S
is dense in X there exists s ∈S with d(s, x) < ε/2. The triangle inequality implies
that d(s, y) < ε. So, for all y ∈ˆX and ε > 0 there exists s ∈S with d(s, y) < ε, as
needed.

A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
Putting these results together we obtain our objective.
Theorem 5.20 The spaces ℓp and L p for 1 ≤p < ∞as well as c0 and C([a, b], C)
are separable.
Proof Each space is the completion of a space obtained as the colimit of a countable
diagram of separable spaces.
□
5.5.2
Duality
Bounded linear functionals V →C are of importance for the study of V . Using the
machinery developed thus far we look into the structure of bounded linear functionals
on classical spaces, starting with the ﬁnite-dimensional ones.
Let us consider Cn with the ∥−∥p norm for some 1 ≤p ≤∞. Any linear func-
tional F : Cn →C is automatically bounded. Such an operator F is necessarily of
the form
F(x) = ⟨, x⟩
for a unique  ∈Cn where the inner product is the standard one. To see why this is
so note that using the standard basis e1, . . . , en ∈Cn, for all x ∈Cn
F(x) = F
 n

i=1
ξiei

=
n

i=1
ξi F(ei)
so that  = (F(e1), . . . , F(en)).
There is thus a bijective correspondence F 	→ between bounded functionals on
Cn and Cn itself. Up to this point the choice of norm was irrelevant since all norms
are in any case equivalent. With respect to the norm ∥−∥p we now determine the
operator norm ∥F∥in terms of its representing vector . Let q satisfy 1/p + 1/q = 1
and note that Hölder’s Inequality (Theorem 2.15) then implies that
|F(x)| = |⟨, x⟩| ≤∥∥q∥x∥p
which thus shows that ∥F∥≤∥∥q. In fact, one can show that equality holds.
A similar observation holds for the spaces Pn. To see how note that the vector
representing F above was obtained by evaluating F on an orthonormal basis. If one
starts with a functional F on Pn, then one can similarly represent it in the same way
by evaluating on an orthonormal basis. Obtaining an orthonormal basis in this case is
a simple matter of applying the Gram-Schmidt process with respect to the standard
inner product on Pn given by integration. When [a, b] = [−1, 1], starting with the
basis 1, t, t2, . . . , tn−1 results in the famous Legendre polynomials. However, no
particular choice needs be made to know that any functional F on Pn is of the form

5.5 Separability and Duality
207
F(x) =

dt ((t))x(t)
for a unique  ∈Pn. The fact that then ∥F∥= ∥∥q follows in precisely the same
way as above from Hölder’s Inequality. Let us summarize.
Proposition 5.16 The linear operators F on Cn (respectively Pn) are in bijective
correspondence with Cn (respectively Pn) and the operator norm ∥F∥with respect
to ∥−∥p corresponds to the norm ∥−∥q.
Having handled the ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces we turn now to ℓp for 1 ≤
p < ∞, so let F : ℓp →C be a bounded linear functional. We immediately make
use of the boundedness of F, and hence its uniform continuity, to obtain a signiﬁcant
simpliﬁcation. Since c00 is dense in ℓp it follows that F is uniquely determined by its
restriction to c00. In other words, to determine the structure of bounded functionals
on ℓp it sufﬁces to study the bounded functionals on c00 with respect to the norm
∥−∥p.
We proceed by examining F : c00 →C. Using the fact that c00 is the colimit of
the diagram of inclusions Cn →Cn+1 we know that such an operator F is uniquely
determined by the family of operators F ◦ιn : Cn →C, which we call Fn. But now
we are back to the ﬁnite-dimensional case and so each Fn is represented by a vec-
tor n ∈Cn and moreover ∥Fn∥p = ∥n∥q. The family {Fn : Cn →C}n≥0 can be
arbitrary as long as it is compatible (so as to form a cone) and uniformly bounded
(so as to extend to a bounded operator on the colimit). Up to this point we were only
referring to a single diagram expressing c00 as a colimit of inclusions Cn →Cn+1,
each member endowed with the norm ∥−∥p. We now consider another such diagram
where the norm is ∥−∥q. This is the natural habitat of the vectors {n}n≥0. A simple
veriﬁcation shows that the compatibility condition on the operators {Fn}n≥0 is pre-
cisely the condition that the sequence {ιn(n)}n≥0 is advancing (Deﬁnition 5.8). The
uniform boundedness of the operators corresponds exactly to the boundedness of this
sequence. We now wish to invoke Proposition 5.10 on the advancing sequence but it
requires that q < ∞, i.e., that p > 1. In that case the advancing sequence represents
a unique element of ℓq. We just established the following.
Theorem 5.21 The bounded linear functionals on ℓp, for 1 < p < ∞, are in bijec-
tion with ℓq in a way that preserves the norms. The bounded linear functionals on
c0 are in bijection with ℓ1.
Theproofabovecanbeunpackedtoproduceamoredirectexpressionforthesequence
in ℓq that represents a given bounded functional F on ℓp. However, the diagrammatic
approach is model-agnostic. As long as the same properties can be veriﬁed in a
different diagram the same conclusion can be drawn. It can be shown that for 1 <
p < ∞the diagrammatic properties leading to the ℓp and the L p spaces agree, but
not for p = ∞. This observation allows us to state the following result.
Theorem 5.22 The bounded linear functionals on L p, for 1 < p < ∞, are in bijec-
tion with Lq in a way that preserves the norms. The bounded linear functional on
C([a, b], C) are more difﬁcult to determine.

208
5
A Non-classical View of the Classical Spaces
In the measure-theoretic model of L p this result can be established by an explicit
expression. The approach above emphasizes that the result is not an artefact of a
particular model but rather a consequence of the way the classical spaces are built
out of the ﬁnite-dimensional building blocks.
This leaves us with the case p = 1. The reason why the same analysis above does
not show that bounded functionals on ℓ1 correspond to c0 is that with respect to
the norm ∥−∥∞the advancing sequence {n}n≥0 above, even if bounded, need not
represent an element in the completion c0; the space c0 is not large enough for that
to happen. Our analysis reveals how to correct the problem. To be able to represent
all of the bounded functionals on ℓ1 we must allow all bounded sequences, not just
those that converge to 0.
Theorem 5.23 The bounded functionals on ℓ1 correspond to ℓ∞in a way that pre-
serves the norm.
For clarity we quote here the corresponding result for the function spaces.
Theorem 5.24 The bounded functionals on L1 correspond to L∞in a norm-
preserving fashion.
5.5.3
Non-separability
The common reason for the separability of ℓp and L p for 1 ≤p < ∞, as well as c0
and C([a, b], C), is the density of, respectively, c00 and P. The space ℓ∞is larger
than c0 and similarly L∞is larger than C([a, b], C). So much so in fact that they are
no longer separable.
Theorem 5.25 The spaces ℓ∞and L∞are not separable.
Proof We treat the case of ℓ∞. By Proposition 5.4 it sufﬁces to exhibit an uncountable
net in ℓ∞. Consider the set X = {0, 1}∞of all sequences composed of 0’s and 1’s.
For any two such sequences x, y
∥x −y∥∞= sup
n≥1
|xn −yn| ∈{0, 1}
since xn, yn ∈{0, 1}. Thus, if x ̸= y, then ∥x −y∥∞= 1 and so X is a net. As for
the uncountability of X, the set X is in bijection with P(N), the power set of the
naturals, by means of the characteristic function. Cantor’s Theorem tells us that the
cardinality |P(N)| is strictly larger than that of N, and thus uncountable. Using the
measure-theoretic model of L∞a similar analysis will show its non-separability. □

The classical sequence spaces are part of a large family of sequence spaces in Banach
spaces and we refer to the excellent book [4] for a thorough presentation. For the role
of ﬁnite-dimensional spaces in quantum computation theory see [6]. An elementary
approach to the Lebesgue integral, and thus to the classical L p spaces, can be found
in [5]. A gentle introduction to functional analysis that includes an introductory
treatment of measure theory is [2]. Finally, the less orthodox categorical approach

Chapter 6
Banach Spaces
Abstract normed spaces were introduced in Chap. 2 and the classical ℓp and L p
spaces were discussed in Chap. 5. The norm in a metric space endows the space with
a metric structure that coexists particularly nicely with the linear space structure.
We saw that in the ﬁnite-dimensional case the topology induced by the norm is an
invariant of the dimension and plays no central role in the general theory. However, in
the inﬁnite-dimensional case not all norms are equivalent and topology starts exerting
its inﬂuence. In the course of this chapter we shall see how to use the topology in
order to gain more control over an inﬁnite-dimensional normed space than would be
possible only algebraically.
We shall promptly revisit the deﬁnition here and study the topology and metric
structure of normed spaces.
Section 6.1 presents the deﬁnition of semi-normed, normed, and Banach spaces,
establishes several fundamental continuity results in general normed spaces, includ-
ing the Open Mapping Theorem, a result of great importance. Section 6.2 is an
investigation of a powerful technique for solving a problem by recasting it in the
form of a ﬁxed point problem, and then resorting to Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem.
This technique is exempliﬁed in detail for the solution of certain classes of differen-
tial and integral equations, namely to Volterra equations and to Fredholm equations.
Section 6.3 starts off with a general study of inverse operators, motivated by an analy-
sis of ﬁxed point problems, and then proceeds to apply this more powerful technique
to strengthen the results obtained in the previous section. Section 6.4 investigates dual
spaces, presents the duals of the classical spaces, and the Hahn-Banach Theorem.
The ﬁrst four sections represent the core material of the theory of bounded linear
operators between normed spaces. Section 6.5 is a short introduction to two fruitful
directions in which the theory can be generalized, namely by considering unbounded
operators between normed spaces and by introducing locally convex spaces.

Semi-norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
Banach spaces are normed spaces in which the algebra and geometry mesh very well
together, giving rise to powerful theorems. We introduce Banach spaces in a broad
context, starting with general semi-normed and normed spaces, a basic investigation
of the topology of normed spaces, followed by a study of bounded linear operators
and the Open Mapping Theorem.
6.1.1
Semi-norms and Norms
The notion of a norm on a linear space is an association of lengths to vectors in such
a way that the linear structure is taken into consideration. In practice, for various
reasons, it is convenient to introduce a weaker structure, that of a semi-norm on a
linear space.
Deﬁnition 6.1 Let V be a linear space over K = R or over K = C. A semi-norm
on V is a function associating with every vector x ∈V a non-negative real number
p(x), the norm of x, in such a way that
p(αx) = |α|p(x)
Triangle inequality:
p(x + y) ≤p(x) + p(y)
for all α ∈K and x, y ∈V . If p(x) = 0 implies x = 0 for all x ∈V , then the function
∥x∥= p(x) is exactly a norm on V . A linear space V together with a semi-norm on
it is called a semi-normed space. We continue to refer to a (semi-)normed space V ,
leaving p(x) or ∥x∥, implicit.
Example 6.1 Numerous examples of normed spaces were already presented in
Chap. 2 so we only consider here semi-norms. Firstly, and quite trivially, any lin-
ear space V supports the trivial semi-norm given by p(x) = 0 for all x ∈V . Less
trivially, consider the linear space C(R, R) of all continuous functions x : R →R.
The evaluation semi-norm is given by ∥x∥= |x(0)|. The veriﬁcation of the axioms
is immediate:
∥αx∥= |αx(0)| = |α||x(0)| = |α|∥x∥
and
∥x + y∥= |x(0) + y(0)| ≤|x(0)| + |y(0)| = ∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
Note that it is obvious that ∥x∥= 0 need not imply x = 0, only that x(0) = 0, so this
semi-norm is not a norm. This construction is a typical one giving rise to semi-norms
by ignoring some of the information embodied in the vectors. Naturally, one may
evaluate at any point, not just at x = 0, and obtain a family of semi-norms.

6.1 Semi-norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
213
There is another natural way to obtain semi-norms. The space C([a, b], R) is a
space of continuous functions. If one wishes to consider non-continuous functions
and to utilize the integral in order to obtain a norm similar in spirit to the L∞or
L p norms on C([a, b], R), then one encounters the following difﬁculty. It is well-
known that for a non-continuous function x, it is possible that

dt |x(t)| = 0 while
x ̸= 0. For instance, if the function is constantly 0 except at ﬁnitely many points.
Thus, by allowing non-continuous functions into our linear spaces, the insensitivity
of the integral to ﬁnite changes in the integrand implies that such norms are rare.
Semi-norms on such spaces though are plentiful. We will also see below one more
instance where semi-norms arise naturally from norms, namely when transferring a
norm from a space to a quotient of it.
We now describe the process of turning a semi-normed space into a normed one.
This, of course, cannot be achieved without paying a price. In this case all non-
zero vectors of norm 0 must be quotiented out of existence. This is a small price to
pay since vectors of norm 0 are, in a sense, negligible. This is a useful method for
constructing normed spaces, since in practice it is common to have a natural choice of
a semi-norm on a given space, and then one passes to the quotient we now describe.
Theorem 6.1 Let V be a semi-normed space.
1. The set U = {x ∈V | p(x) = 0} is a linear subspace of V .
2. The function
∥x + U∥= p(x)
is well deﬁned on the quotient space V/U and with it V/U is a normed space.
Proof
1. In a semi-normed space we have p(0) = p(0 · 0) = |0| · p(0) = 0 and thus 0 ∈
U, which is thus in particular non-empty. It remains to show that U is closed
under addition and scalar products. Indeed, if x, y ∈U, then
0 ≤p(x + y) ≤p(x) + p(y) = 0 + 0 = 0,
and thus p(x + y) = 0, so x + y ∈U. Finally, if x ∈U and α ∈K is an arbitrary
scalar, then p(αx) = |α|p(x) = |α| · 0 = 0, so that αx ∈U.
2. To show that x + U →p(x) is well deﬁned suppose that x′ + U = x + U. Then
x −x′ ∈U, namely p(x −x′) = 0, and thus
∥x + U∥= p(x) = p((x −x′) + x′) ≤p(x −x′) + p(x′) = p(x′) = ∥x′ + U∥.
A similar argument shows that ∥x′ + U∥≤∥x + U∥and consequently ∥x +
U∥= ∥x′ + U∥so that x + U →p(x) is independent of the choice of represen-
tative. Next, clearly, ∥x + U∥≥0 for all x + U ∈V/U and
∥α(x + U)∥= ∥αx + U∥= p(αx) = |α|p(x) = |α|∥x + U∥

for all α ∈K and x + U ∈V/U. A similar argument proves the triangle inequal-
ity. It remains to show that if ∥x + U∥= 0, then x + U = 0 in the quotient space,
namely that x ∈U. Indeed, since ∥x + U∥= p(x), if ∥x + U∥= 0, then x ∈U
by deﬁnition of U. To conclude, p(x) induces a norm on the quotient space V/U,
as claimed.

We already proved that a normed space is automatically endowed with a distance
function. We extend this simple (yet pivotal) observation to make a connection
between semi-normed spaces and semi-metric spaces as well. Recall that a semi-
metric space is a set together with a distance function d : X × X →R+ satisfying
the axioms of a metric space, except that it is possible that d(x, y) = 0 for distinct
points x and y. For the reader’s convenience we repeat the statement and the proof
for normed spaces.
Theorem 6.2 Let V be a semi-normed space. Then deﬁning d(x, y) = p(x −y) for
all vectors x, y ∈V , endows V with the structure of a semi-metric space. If V is a
normed space, then d(x, y) = p(x −y) = ∥x −y∥endows V with the structure of a
metric space. These are, respectively, the induced semi-metric and metric structures.
Proof Clearly d(x, y) ≥0. Symmetry follows by
d(x, y) = p(x −y) = p((−1)(y −x)) = | −1|p(y −x) = d(y, x)
while the triangle inequality follows by
d(x, z) = p(x −z) = p(x −y + y −z) ≤p(x −y) + p(y −z) = d(x, y) + d(y, z).
Finally, if the semi-norm is in fact a norm, then
d(x, y) = 0 =⇒∥x −y∥= 0 =⇒x −y = 0 =⇒x = y,
completing the proof.
□
Recall that there is a canonical construction for turning a semi-metric space into a
metric space. In more detail, if (X, d) is a semi-metric space, then deﬁning x ∼y
precisely when d(x, y) = 0 yields an equivalence relation on X and the function
d([x], [y]) = d(x, y) is well deﬁned and turns the quotient set X/∼into a metric
space. The next result shows that starting with a semi-normed space, turning it into a
metric space by ﬁrst constructing the associated semi-metric and then turning it into
a metric space, or ﬁrst turning it into a normed space and then associating a metric
space with it yield the same end-result.
Theorem 6.3 Let V be a semi-normed space. Consider the induced normed space
V/U = {x + U | x ∈V }, where U = {x ∈V | p(x) = 0}, and the induced metric
space (V/U, d). Consider next the induced semi-metric space (V, d) and the induced
metric space (V/∼, d) where ∼is the equivalence relation on V given by x ∼y
precisely when d(x, y) = 0. Then the two resulting metric spaces are identical.

6.1 Semi-norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
215
Proof First we show that the two resulting metric spaces have identical underlying
sets. Indeed, for the second described metric space we consider the quotient set V/∼
where x ∼y if, and only if, d(x, y) = 0. But d(x, y) = p(x −y) and thus x ∼y if,
and only if, x −y ∈U. It follows that [x] = x + U and thus the quotient set V/∼
coincides with the quotient set construction for V/U. Next we show that the metrics
agree as well. The induced metric on V/U is given by
d(x + U, y + U) = ∥x −y + U∥= p(x −y)
while the metric d on V/∼is given in terms of the semi-metric d on V as
d([x], [y]) = d(x, y) = p(x −y).
The two metrics are thus identical, as claimed.

A subspace U of a semi-normed space (V, p) is automatically a semi-normed space
by deﬁning y →p(y) for every y ∈U, using the semi-norm in the ambient space.
Similarly, any subspace U of a normed space (V, ∥· ∥) is a normed space with
norm given by y →∥y∥, for all y ∈U. The proofs are immediate. The situation for
quotient spaces is slightly more complicated since topological considerations enter
the discussion. Recall that a metric induces a topology so the concepts of topology
are available in any normed space. In particular, we may speak of closed subsets of
a normed space V .
Theorem 6.4 Let V be a normed space and U a linear subspace of V . Then the
quotient space V/U, when endowed with the function
p(x + U) = inf
u∈U ∥x + u∥,
is a semi-normed space. If U is a closed subspace of V , then V/U is a normed space.
Proof The quotient vector space V/U is the set {x + U | x ∈V } of translations of
U with the linear operations determined by the representatives. We need to verify
that the proposed formula
p(x + U) = inf
u∈U ∥x + u∥
satisﬁes the conditions for being a semi-norm. Clearly, p(x + U) ≥0 since it is an
inﬁmum of non-negative real numbers. Given α ∈K and x + U ∈V/U we need to
show that
p(αx + U) = |α|p(x + U).
If α = 0, then
p(αx + U) = p(0 + U) = inf
u∈U ∥u∥= 0
(since 0 ∈U and ∥0∥= 0), and the equality holds. If α ̸= 0, then

216

Banach Spaces
p(αx + U) = inf
u∈U ∥αx + u∥= inf
u∈U ∥αx + α 1
α u∥= |α| inf
u∈U ∥x + 1
α u∥
and noting that {(1/α)u}u∈U and {u}u∈U are the same set of vectors yields the desired
equality. To establish the triangle inequality we need to show that
inf
u∈U ∥x + y + u∥≤inf
u′∈U ∥x + u′∥+ inf
u′′∈U ∥y + u′′∥=
inf
u′,u′′∈U ∥x + u′∥+ ∥y + u′′∥.
It sufﬁces to establish that, given u′, u′′ ∈U,
inf
u∈U ∥x + y + u∥≤∥x + u′∥+ ∥y + u′′∥.
This is the case since
inf
u∈U ∥x + y + u∥≤∥x + y + (u′ + u′′)∥= ∥(x + u′) + (y + u′′)∥≤∥x + u′∥+ ∥y + u′′∥.
We thus far established that V/U, with the proposed function, is a semi-normed
space. To complete the proof we show that if U is closed in V , then V/U is in
fact a normed space, namely that for ∥x + U∥= p(x + U), if ∥x + U∥= 0, then
x + U = 0 in the quotient space, that is that x ∈U. So suppose that
∥x + U∥= inf
u∈U ∥u −x∥= 0.
Now, by deﬁnition of inﬁmum, there exists a sequence un ∈U with ∥un −x∥→0.
In other words, d(un, x) →0 and thus un →x in the induced topology. We thus
exhibited x as a limit of a sequence in the closed set U, and thus x itself belongs to
U, as required.
□
To see that if U is not closed then the quotient space may indeed only be a semi-
normed space, consider any normed space V and a dense linear subspace U of it.
The quotient space V/U with the induced semi-norm
p(x + U) = inf
u∈U ∥x + u∥= inf
u∈U ∥u −x∥
allows for p(x + U) = 0 even if x /∈U. In fact, p(x + U) = 0 for all x ∈V , in
other words the induced semi-norm on V/U degenerates to the trivial semi-norm:
for x ∈V choose a sequence in U that converges to x and then
p(x + U) ≤inf
n ∥un −x∥= 0.

6.1.2
Banach Spaces
Any ﬁnite-dimensional normed space is complete. However, an inﬁnite-dimensional
normed space need not be complete, e.g., the space c00. Non-complete normed spaces
exhibit pathological behaviour. In some sense, such spaces are full of holes. In the
rest of this chapter we explore some of the consequences of the powerful interaction
between algebra and topology when a normed space is also a Banach space, namely
a complete metric space.
Deﬁnition 6.2 A normed space that with the metric induced by the norm is complete
is a Banach space, which we typically denote by B.
Example 6.2 The discussion of the classical spaces in Chap. 5 provides us with
important examples of Banach spaces. In particular, any ﬁnite-dimensional normed
space is a Banach space. The sequence spaces ℓp for all 1 ≤p < ∞as well as c0 of
sequences that converge to 0 arise as completions of c00 with respect to suitable norms
and are thus Banach spaces. Similarly, the function spaces L p for all 1 ≤p < ∞as
well as C([a, b], R) and C([a, b], C) of continuous functions are completions of the
polynomial space P with respect to suitable norms so these too are Banach spaces.
The spaces ℓ∞and L∞of bounded sequences and of essentially bounded functions,
each with its own supermum norm ∥−∥∞are Banach spaces as well.
We emphasize that for all 1 ≤p < ∞the spaces C([a, b], R) and C([a, b], C) are
not complete: convergence in the integral norm is not sufﬁciently strong to preserve
the delicate notion of continuity.
Recall that a series ∞
k=1 ak of real or complex numbers is said to converge to s
if the sequence {sm}m≥1 of partial sums, i.e., sm = m
k=1 ak, converges to s. We thus
see that convergence for series is deﬁned in terms of sequences. Moreover, one can
recover the convergence of sequences in terms of that of series, as follows. Given a
sequence {xm}m≥1 consider the series ∞
k=1 ak where ak = xk −xk−1 (and a1 = x1).
The partial sum sm is then nothing but xm, and thus if the series converges, then so
does the sequence. Some aspects of the interplay between sequences and series in R
and C extend to normed spaces.
Deﬁnition 6.3 For elements {am}m≥1 in a normed space V we say that the series
∞
k=1 ak converges to s ∈V if the sequence of partial sums converges to s with
respect to the norm in V , i.e., when

converges.
Recall that if a series ∞
k=1 ak of real (or complex) numbers converges absolutely,
that is if ∞
k=1 |ak| converges, then the original series converges as well. Viewing R
(or C) as a normed space, this result is a special case of the following useful criterion
for a normed space to be a Banach space.
Theorem 6.5 A normed space V is a Banach space if, and only if, the absolute
convergence of a series in V implies its convergence.
The proof is left for the reader as we recount how the algebraic structure in a normed
space interacts with the metric and topological structures induced by the norm, essen-
tially repeating Theorem 5.2.
Proposition 6.1 The following assertions hold for any normed space V .
1. The mapping x →∥x∥, as a function V →R, is non-expanding and thus the
norm function is (uniformly) continuous.
2. For any ﬁxed x0 ∈V the translation mapping x →x0 + x is a global isometry
and a homeomorphism.
3. For any α ∈K with α ̸= 0 the scaling mapping x →αx, as a function V →V ,
is uniformly continuous and a homeomorphism.
4. The mapping (x, y) →x + y, as a function V × V →V , is continuous (and in
fact uniformly continuous when V × V is given the additive product metric).
Proof
1. Refering to Proposition 2.13 we have
dR(∥x∥, ∥y∥) = |∥x∥−∥y∥| ≤∥x −y∥= dV (x, y).
2. Since ∥(x0 + x) −(x0 + x′)∥= ∥x −x′∥any translation is an isometry. Further,
the translation x →x0 + x is clearly invertible, its inverse being the translation
x →−x0 + x. An isometry is certainly continuous, and thus any translation is a
continuous function with continuous inverse, and thus a homeomorphism.
3. Since ∥αx −αx′∥= |α|∥x −x′∥, it follows that any scaling mapping is uni-
formly continuous. The scaling mapping x →αx is clearly invertible, with
inverse the scaling mapping x →(1/α)x. Any non-zero scaling is thus a contin-
uous function with a continuous inverse, thus a homeomorphism.
4. Left for the reader.

6.1.3
Bounded Operators
Bounded linear operators were given a preliminary look in Sect. 5.1. The main result
we establish now is that such operators provide a rich source of examples of Banach
spaces: the collection of bounded linear operators between normed spaces is itself a
normed space and is a Banach space if the codomain is a Banach space.
Recall that for an operator A: V →W between normed spaces the operator norm
of A is
∥A∥= sup
∥x∥=1
∥Ax∥
and that A is bounded precisely when ∥A∥< ∞. Moreover, boundedness for linear
operators is equivalent to continuity with respect to the metrics induced by the norms
(see Theorem 5.3).
We look at two familiar linear operators, only one of which is bounded.
Example 6.3 In C([a, b], R), the linear space of continuous functions x : [a, b] →
R with the L∞norm, consider the integral operator:
(Ax)(s) =
 b
a
dt K(t, s) x(t)
with K : [a, b] × [a, b] →R a given continuous function. To see that the operator
A is bounded note that if M = maxt,s∈[a,b] |K(t, s)|, then
∥Ax∥= max
s∈[a,b]
			
 b
a
dt K(t, s) x(t)
			 ≤max
t,s∈[a,b]
		K(t, s)
		
			
 b
a
dt x(t)
			 ≤
≤M(b −a) max
t∈[a,b]
		x(t)
		 = M(b −a)∥x∥.
In a sense, the operator owes its boundedness to the robustness of integration; small
perturbations have small effects on the integral.
Example 6.4 Consider the operator A : C1([0, 1], R) →C([0, 1], R), where both
the domain and the codomain are given the L∞norm, that maps a continuously
differentiable function x : [0, 1] →R to its derivative, i.e., Ax = dx/dt. The fact
that A is not bounded is seen for example by considering xn(t) = tn and noting that
∥xn∥= 1 but Axn(t) = ntn−1, and thus ∥Axn∥= n.
The unboundedness of differentiation is a reﬂection of its local nature, e.g., the
function t →tn increases rapidly but over a very short interval near 1.

6.1.4
The Open Mapping Theorem
A mathematical structure typically has an underlying set and the relevant functions
between the structures are the structure-preserving functions. If f : A →B is such
a structure-preserving function and it is a bijection of the underlying sets, there is no
a-priori reason for the inverse function f −1 : B →A to still preserve the structures.
Whether this is the case depends delicately on the actual structure. Typically in
algebraic situations, e.g., if A and B are linear spaces and f is a linear operator,
then the inverse does preserve the structure. In more geometric scenarios, e.g., if A
and B are topological spaces and f is a continuous function, then the inverse may
very well fail to preserve the structures. A Banach space is a synergy of algebra
and geometry and so it is not obvious whether a given bounded linear operator
A: A →B between Banach spaces that is also a bijection has an inverse that is
still a bounded linear operator. The inverse will certainly be a linear operator but
will it be continuous? Since the question is primarily topological, we phrase it that
way and in slightly greater generality. A continuous function between topological
spaces need not be open even if it is surjective (i.e., it need not send open subsets to
open subsets). We show that surjectivity is a sufﬁcient condition for a bounded linear
operator between Banach spaces to be open. The result is due to Stefan Banach and is
our ﬁrst example of a deep result in the theory of Banach spaces, one with profound
consequences.
The technical heart of the argument is stated as a separate lemma. Its proof is
omitted in favour of a more conceptual presentation of the the main result. We refer
the reader to any text dedicated to Banach spaces in order to ﬁll-in the details and
obtain a fully rigorous proof.
It will be convenient to introduce the notation 0V (s) = {x ∈V | ∥x∥< s}, the
open ball in a normed space V with centre the zero vector 0 and radius s > 0. We
further write n · 0V (s) for the point-wise scaling of 0V (s) by n, namely
n · 0V (s) = {nx | x ∈OV (s)} = 0V (ns).
Lemma 6.1 Let A : B →V be a bounded linear operator from a Banach space B
to a normed space V . It then follows that if r, s > 0 are such that
0V (s) ⊆A(0B(r)),
then
0V (s) ⊆A(0B(r)).
Theorem 6.6 (Open Mapping Theorem) A bounded surjective linear operator A :
B1 →B2 between Banach spaces is an open mapping.
Proof Let U ⊆B1 be an open set, that we may assume is non-empty. For some
x0 ∈U let us consider Ax0, an arbitrary element in A(U). As U is open, let ε > 0 be

6.1 Semi-norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
221
such that Bε(x0) ⊆U, and notice that Bε(x0) = 0B1(ε) + x0, i.e., a ball with centre
x0 is the x0 translation of a ball centered at the origin. By linearity of A we then have
A(U) ⊇A(x0 + 0B1(ε)) = Ax0 + A(0B1(ε)).
Thus the proof is reduced to showing that for every ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such
that 0B2(δ) ⊆A(0B1(ε)), since then
A(U) ⊇Ax0 + 0B2(δ) = Bδ(Ax0)
and thus Ax0 is an interior point of A(U). As Ax0 was arbitrary, every point of A(U)
is interior, and thus A(U) is open.
We thus ﬁx an open ball 0B1(ε), ε > 0, denote X = A(0B1(ε)), and we seek out
a δ > 0 for which 0B2(δ) ⊆X. Noting that
B1 =

n≥1
n · 0B1(ε)
the surjectivity and homogeneity of A implies that
B2 = A(B1) =

n≥1
n · X.
Taking closures and applying Baire’s Theorem, there exists an n ≥1 such that n · X
contains an open ball. In other words, there exists a δ > 0 such that Bδ(y) ⊆n · X.
We omit some details on translations and scalings that are used to conclude that in
fact from Bδ(y) ⊆n · X it follows that 0B2(δ/n) ⊆X. Lemma 6.1 then concludes
the proof.
□
A consequence of the Open Mapping Theorem illustrates some of the taming effect
of the completeness requirement on Banach spaces.
Corollary 6.1 (Bounded Inverse Theorem) If a bounded linear operator A : B1 →
B2 between Banach spaces is invertible, then its inverse A−1 is also a bounded linear
operator.
Proof By Proposition 2.8 the inverse of a linear operator is itself linear. It remains
to show that A−1 is continuous, namely that (A−1)−1(U) is an open set whenever
U is open. Since (A−1)−1 = A, we need to show that A(U) is open whenever U is
open, namely that A is an open mapping. But A is invertible, hence surjective, and
thus A is an open mapping by the Open Mapping Theorem.

Banach Spaces of Linear and Bounded Operators
We conclude this section by studying the set of mappings B(V, W) of all bounded
linear operators A : V →W between normed spaces. The main result is that when
endowed with the operator norm it is a normed space. Furthermore, if the codomain
is a Banach space, then so is the space of mappings into it.
Theorem 6.7 Let A, B : V →W be bounded linear operators between normed
spaces. Then
1. ∥A∥= 0 if, and only if, A = 0.
2. ∥αA∥= |α|∥A∥for all scalars α.
3. ∥A + B∥≤∥A∥+ ∥B∥.
Proof
1. If A = 0 then ∥Ax∥≤0 · ∥x∥and thus ∥A∥= 0. Conversely, if ∥A∥= 0, then
∥Ax∥≤∥A∥∥x∥= 0 and thus Ax = 0, for all x ∈V .
2. ∥αA∥= sup∥x∥=1 ∥αAx∥= |α| sup∥x∥=1 ∥Ax∥= |α|∥A∥.
3. ∥A + B∥= sup∥x∥=1 ∥(A + B)x∥≤sup∥x∥=1(∥Ax∥+ ∥Bx∥) = ∥A∥+ ∥B∥.
□
Recall Theorem 2.3 stating that for linear spaces V and W the set Hom(V, W) of all
linear operators A : V →W is a linear space.
Theorem 6.8 For normed spaces V and W the set B(V, W) is a linear subspace of
Hom(V, W). Endowed with the operator norm it is a normed space.
Proof Theorem 6.7 states that B(V, W) contains 0 and is closed under addition and
scalar multiplication, and is thus a linear subspace of Hom(V, W). Further, the same
theorem establishes the axioms of a normed space for the operator norm on B(V, W)
and the claim follows.
□
Since B(V, W) is a normed space it is also a metric space and thus a corresponding
notion of convergence for operators is automatic.
Deﬁnition 6.4 (Operator Norm Convergence or Strong Convergence) Let V and
W be normed spaces. Given a sequence {Am}m≥1 of operators in B(V, W) we say
that {Am}m≥1 converges strongly or converges in the operator norm to an operator
A0 ∈B(V, W) if ∥Am −A0∥→0 (equivalently, when Am →A0 with respect to
the metric induced by the operator norm).
A weaker notion of convergence is also available in the space B(V, W).
Deﬁnition 6.5 Let V and W be normed spaces. We say that a sequence {Am}m≥1 of
operators in the space B(V, W) converges point-wise to an operator A0 ∈B(V, W)
if Amx →A0x for all x ∈V .

6.1 Semi-norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
223
Since ∥Amx −A0x∥≤∥Am −A0∥∥x∥it follows that strong convergence implies
point-wise convergence. We illustrate that the converse may fail.
Example 6.5 Consider the sequence of linear operators Fm : ℓ2 →C given by
Fmx = xm, that is Fm is the projection of the m-th coordinate, and thus is clearly a
linear operator. Since
∥Fmx∥= |xm| ≤∥x∥
we see that ∥Fm∥≤1 and thus Fm is bounded (and in fact ∥Fm∥= 1 as there clearly
exist x ∈ℓ2 with ∥Fmx∥= ∥x∥).
We claim that Fm →0 point-wise, i.e., that Fmx →0 for all x ∈ℓ2. Indeed, for
x ∈ℓ2 one has
∞

m=1
|xm|2 < ∞
and consequently, xm →0. But xm = Fmx, and the claim follows. However, as noted,
∥Fm∥= 1 and thus {Fm}m≥1 does not converge strongly to 0, and thus does not
converge at all.
Finally, we prove the completeness of B(V, B) when the codomain is complete.
Theorem 6.9 Let B be a Banach space and V an arbitrary normed space. Then the
linear space B(V, B) with the operator norm is a Banach space.
Proof We already know that with the operator norm B(V, B) is a normed space
so it remains to show that it is complete. Consider a Cauchy sequence {Am}m≥1.
Since ∥Akx −Amx∥≤∥Ak −Am∥∥x∥−→0 for all x ∈V , it follows at once that
{Amx}m≥1 is also a Cauchy sequence, and, as B is complete, Amx →y. We thus
deﬁne A0(x) = y and obtain the function A0 : V →B that we proceed to show is a
bounded linear operator.
The linearity of A0 follows by standard limit arguments. For instance, continuity
of vector addition implies that
A0(x + x′) = lim
m→∞Am(x + x′) = lim
m→∞Amx + lim
m→∞Amx′ = Ax + Ax′
and thus A0 is additive. A similar argument shows A0 is homogenous. To show that
A0 is bounded we use the continuity of the norm to obtain that
∥Ax∥= ∥lim
m→∞Amx∥= lim
m→∞∥Amx∥≤lim
m→∞∥Am∥∥x∥≤M∥x∥
where M is any upper bound of the sequence ∥Am∥(which exists since any Cauchy
sequence is bounded).
Lastly, we verify that Am →A0 in the operator norm. Given ε > 0, using the
Cauchy condition, there exists an N ∈N such that ∥Am −Ak∥< ε for all m, k > N.
In particular, for all x ∈V ,

224
6
Banach Spaces
∥(Am −Ak)x∥≤∥Am −Ak∥∥x∥< ε∥x∥,
for all m, k ≥N. When k tends to ∞we thus obtain
∥(Am −A0)x∥≤ε∥x∥
for all x ∈V and thus
∥Am −A0∥≤ε
for all m > N. In other words, ∥Am −A0∥→0, as required.

Fixed Point Techniques in Banach Spaces
Since a Banach space B is in particular a complete and non-empty metric space the
Banach Fixed Point Theorem (Theorem 4.9) guarantees that any contraction on B
admits a unique ﬁxed point. In more detail, a contraction on a Banach space B is a
function (not necessarily linear) F : B →B such that there exists 0 < α < 1 with
∥Fx −Fy∥≤α∥x −y∥.
The guaranteed unique ﬁxed point for F is an element x0 ∈B with F(x0) = x0.
From the proof of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, the ﬁxed point x0 is obtained as
the limit xk →x0 where xk+1 = F(xk), with x1 ∈B arbitrary.
It follows that any problem in a Banach space B whose solution can be expressed
as a ﬁxed point for a contraction on B can be solved iteratively. We explore this tech-
nique in three different scenarios: systems of linear equations, ﬁrst order differential
equations, and integral equations.
Remark 6.1 Notice that the more general problem
x0 = F(x0) + b
is subsumed by the technique described above since for G(x) = F(x) + b one has
that
∥G(x) −G(y)∥= ∥F(x) −F(y)∥
and thus F is a contraction if, and only if, G is. Moreover, a ﬁxed point for G is
precisely a solution of the equation x0 = F(x0) + b. It is customary to simplify the
notation and write x = Fx + b. Notice that if F is a linear operator, then F is a
contraction if, and only if, ∥F∥< 1.
6.2.1
Systems of Linear Equations
Consider a linear system of n equations in n unknowns:

226
6
Banach Spaces
n

i=1
akixi = bk,
k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
In terms of operators this system of equations can be written as Ax = b where A is
the corresponding n × n matrix of coefﬁcients viewed as a linear operator Rn →Rn,
with x = (x1, · · · , xn) representing the unknown vector and b = (b1, b2, . . . , bn) the
vector of free coefﬁcients. Theoretically precise methods for solving such systems of
linear equations are computationally demanding. For instance, Cramer’s rule requires
the computation of n2 determinants and thus, for large n, is unfeasible. Moreover,
numerical difﬁculties resulting from rounding may render some computation tech-
niques unreliable. We now investigate the applicability of an iterative ﬁxed point
technique in this case. Such a solution is often more robust than naive applications
of theoretical exact solutions (though we will not delve into a numerical analysis of
the solution here).
Since Ax = b if, and only if, x = (−A + In)x + b, where In is the n × n identity
matrix, we are led to consider the equation
x = Fx + b
where F = −A + In. The original problem is equivalent to the ﬁxed point problem
x = Gx
where Gx = Fx + b = (−A + In)x + b is viewed as an operator G : Rn →Rn.
Let us assume some norm on Rn is chosen. For the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to
be applicable G must be a contraction. Since F is a linear operator this is determined
by the norm ∥F∥: if ∥F∥< 1, then F, and thus G, is a contraction and the original
problem is amenable to the iterative solution xk+1 = Gxk with an arbitrary x1 ∈Rn.
Whether F is a contraction is typically strongly dependent on the chosen norm
for the ambient space Rn. We consider two cases below, recalling that the Kronecker
δ function is given by
δk,i =

1 if k = i,
0 if k ̸= i.
Example 6.6 Consider Rn with the ℓ∞norm: ∥x∥= max1≤k≤n |xk|. Then, for any

Thus, if the inequality

6.2.2
Cauchy’s Problem and the Volterra Equation
Consider Cauchy’s problem for the ﬁrst order differential equation:
dx
dt (t) = f [t, x(t)]
with
x(t0) = x0.

228
6
Banach Spaces
The associated integral equation
x(t) =
 t
t0
ds f [s, x(s)] + x0
is called a Volterra integral equation. Suppose that, for |t −t0| ≤ε and |x −x0| ≤η,
the function f (t, x) is continuous and | f (t, x)| < M. Noting that a solution of the
Volterra equation is also a solution to the original Cauchy problem, we introduce the
operator
(Bx)(t) =
 t
t0
ds f [ s, x(s)] + x0
since its ﬁxed points are precisely solutions to the Volterra equation. If B can be seen
to be an operator
B : C(I, R) →C(I, R)
for a suitable interval I ⊆[a, b], and if B is moreover a contraction with respect to
some norm, then locally Cauchy’s problem has a unique solution that, starting with
an arbitrary x0, may be computed iteratively:
x1(t) =
 t
t0
ds f (s, x0) + x0, x2(t) =
 t
t0
ds f [ s, x1(s)] + x0, . . . , xn(t) = . . .
Since the norm we choose must turn the space C(I, R) into a Banach space (since
otherwise Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem does not apply) the only norm we can
consider is the L∞norm (and now the importance of the L p spaces becomes apparent
as they are complete and thus they allow one to consider other norms).
Let us examine under which assumptions is it guaranteed that B is a contraction
for a suitable interval. Consider C(I, R) where I = [t0 −ε, t0 + ε] and choose some
interval J = [x0 −η, x0 + η] contained in I. We seek to identify conditions on ε,
η, and M that will assure the existence of a solution, at least locally. We note the
following.
1. The function Bx is certainly a continuous function, given the assumptions on
f [t, s].
2.
∥Bx −x0∥= max
t∈I
			
 t
t0
ds f [ s, x(s)]
			 ≤
≤maxt∈I |t −t0| maxt∈I, x∈J | f (t, x)| ≤εM.
We thus see that the operator B transforms the restriction of x to J into a function
taking values in J provided that ε ≤η/M, a condition we now assume is met.
3. For all x, y ∈J we have that

6.2 Fixed Point Techniques in Banach Spaces
229
∥Bx −By∥≤max
t∈I
 t
t0
ds
		 f [ s, x(s)] −f [ s, y(s)]
		.
4. Suppose the function f (t, x) is not just continuous and bounded but also satisﬁes
the Lipschitz condition:
		 f (t, x) −f (t, y)
		 ≤K|x −y|, ∀x, y ∈J,
uniformly for all t ∈I. Then
∥Bx −By∥≤max
t∈I
 t

ds
		 f [s, x(s)] −f [s, y(s)]
		 ≤K max

t0
ds
		x(s) −y(s)
		 ≤
≤Kε max
s∈I
		x(s) −y(s)
		 = Kε∥x −y∥, ∀x, y.
Collecting these observations together we conclude that if ε ≤η/M and ε ≤1/K,
then the operator B is a contraction and Cauchy’s problem has one, and only one,
solution inside the reduced interval I = [t0 −ε, t0 + ε], with ε ≤min(η/M, 1/K).
Furthermore, the solution can be obtained iteratively as a ﬁxed point solution of the
associated Volterra equation.
6.2.3
Fredholm Equations
The Volterra equations, considered above, are examples of integral equations with
variable limits. We turn to consider Fredholm equations, belonging to the family of
integral equations with ﬁxed limits.
First consider the general form of a non-linear Fredholm equation
x(t) = λ
 b
a
ds K

t, s, x(s)

= [Ax](t),
where we consider A as an operator and we seek to identify conditions under which
the iterative ﬁxed point method is applicable. Let K(t, s, x) be a continuous function
in [a, b] × [a, b] × [−η, η] and bounded by M > 0. Let J = [−η, η] and consider
C(J, R) with the L∞norm. Noticing that
∥Ax∥≤max
t∈[a,b]
			λ
 b

ds K

t, s, x(s)
			 ≤|λ|M(b −a)

, then ∥Ax∥≤η and so the operator A is well
deﬁned when restricting to the interval J. Furthermore,

 b

			K

t, s, y(s)
			.
If we also make the assumption that the function K(t, s, x) is Lipschitz with respect
to x, uniformly in the square [a, b] × [a, b], with Lipschitz constant K, then:
∥Ax −Ay∥≤|λ|(b −a)K max
s∈[a,b] |x(s) −y(s)| ≤|λ|(b −a)K ∥x −y∥.
It thus follows that if |λ|(b −a)K < 1, then the operator A is a contraction, and
thus the original non-linear Fredholm equation has a unique solution obtained by the
iterative scheme
xn+1(t) =
 b
a
ds K

t, s, xn(s)

with x0(t) any continuous function on [a, b] satisfying maxt |x0(t)| ≤η. The condi-
tion
|λ|(b −a) ≤min{η/M, 1/K}
guarantees the applicability of the iterative solution.
Consider now the linear Fredholm equation:
x(t) = λ
 b
a
ds K(t, s)x(s) + f (t)
with λ a real parameter, f (t) a continuous function in [a, b], and K(t, s) continuous
in the square [a, b] × [a, b] and bounded by M > 0. Still considering C([a, b], R)
with the L∞norm, consider the operator
(Bx)(t) = λ
 b
a
ds K(t, s)x(s) + f (t).
We now have that,
∥Bx −By∥= max
t∈[a,b]

x(s) −y(s)
			 ≤
≤|λ|M(b −a) max
s∈[a,b]
		x(s) −y(s)
		 = |λ|M(b −a)∥x −y∥
and thus, for |λ| < 1/[M(b −a)], the operator B is a contraction and the uniform
limit (i.e., with respect to the L∞norm) of the iterative process
xn+1(t) = λ
 b
a
ds K(t, s)xn(s) + f (t) = . . .

exists and gives the solution to the given Fredholm equation. A possible choice of
the initial function is given by x0(t) = f (t).
Example 6.8 Consider in C([0, 1], R) the Fredholm equation:
x(t) = λ
 1

ds tsx(s) + αt
with α a real parameter. Since maxt,s∈[0,1] K(t, s) = 1 and (b −a) = 1, it follows

xn+1 = λ

ds (t s) (αn s) = (α + αn λ/3) t = αn+1 t, , . . .
For |λ| < 1 the limit x = limn→∞xn exists and thus also β = limn→∞αn exists.
When passing to the limit in the last equality we obtain that α + βλ/3 = β, from
which we conclude that β = 3α/(3 −λ) and, ﬁnally, that x(t) = 3α/(3 −λ)t.
We got this solution by assuming |λ| < 1, but one can easily see that the limit of αn
as n →∞also exists if |λ| < 3, as suggested by the last relation. In fact:
αn+1 = α + αn λ/3 = · · · = α

1 + λ/3 + (λ/3)2 + · · · + (λ/3)n+1
=⇒
=⇒
αn(t) →3α/(3 −λ)
for
|λ| < 3.
The condition |λ| < 1 is a sufﬁcient condition for the convergence of the iterative
process which, as just seen, has a broader domain of convergence. More generally,
the function x(t) found above is actually a solution of the original problem for every
λ ̸= 3, as is easily checked with a test function x(t) = γ t, with γ unknown.

Inverse Operators
From Chap. 2 we know that if a linear operator A : V →W admits an inverse
function A−1 : W →V , then that function is automatically a linear operator. The
Open Mapping Theorem implies that if the linear spaces are Banach spaces and the
operator is bounded, then its inverse is also bounded. In this section we will establish
a condition on A that guarantees the existence of a bounded inverse without assuming
the spaces are Banach. We will then obtain a simple yet powerful result that presents
the inverse of an operator in terms of a convergent series of operators. The analysis
will reveal the close connection between invertibility and ﬁxed point solutions. We
will then have a second, deeper, look at the Volterra and Fredholm equations in light
of the results below.

6.3 Inverse Operators
233
6.3.1
Existence of Bounded Inverses
We present conditions that guarantee the existence of inverse operators, providing
estimates for their norm, and, under suitable conditions, we obtain the inverse as the
sum of a strongly convergent series.
Theorem 6.10 Let A : V →W be a bounded surjective linear operator between
normed spaces. Then A is invertible with bounded inverse A−1 if, and only if, there
exists a constant C > 0 such that ∥Ax∥≥C∥x∥, for all x ∈V . Moreover, with such
a constant C the operator norm of the inverse satisﬁes ∥A−1∥≤1/C.
Proof Suppose that ∥Ax∥≥C∥x∥holds. Then if Ax = 0, then 0 = ∥Ax∥≥C∥x∥,
and thus x = 0. In other words, Ker(A) = {0} and thus A is injective. Since it is
given that A is surjective we conclude that A is invertible and that its inverse A−1
is automatically a linear operator. Moreover, for all y ∈W let x ∈V with Ax = y,
and thus x = A−1y. We then have
∥y∥= ∥Ax∥≥C∥x∥= C∥A−1y∥,
showing that ∥A−1∥≤1/C. In the other direction, suppose that A−1 exists and is
bounded. Then, for all x ∈V
∥x∥= ∥A−1 Ax∥≤∥A−1∥∥Ax∥.
Noticing that the norm of an invertible operator is strictly positive, we conclude that
∥Ax∥≥
1
∥A−1∥∥x∥
and thus we may take C = 1/∥A−1∥.
□
Consider now an inhomogenous ﬁxed point problem x = Ax + b, where A : B →B
is a linear operator on a Banach space B. As we know, if A is a contraction, namely
if ∥A∥< 1, then a unique solution exists. Notice though that the problem may be
re-written as (I −A)x = b, where we write I for the identity operator on B. Now,
if (I −A) is invertible, then we obtain the unique solution x = (I −A)−1b. Since
the latter does not rely on the norm it actually holds in any linear space. We thus
have two criteria for the solution of the equation x = Ax + b: one is that A be a
contraction and the other is that I −A be invertible. The next result shows that the
former implies the latter, provided the ambient space is a Banach space.
Proposition 6.2 Let A : B →B be a linear operator on a Banach space B. If
∥A∥< 1, then I −A is invertible. Moreover, ∥(I −A)−1∥≤1/(1 −∥A∥).
Proof Since ∥Ax∥< ∥A∥∥x∥, if follows that
∥(I −A)x∥= ∥x −Ax∥≥∥x∥−∥Ax∥≥∥x∥−∥A∥∥x∥= (1 −∥A∥)∥x∥.

234
6
Banach Spaces
The claim would follow from Theorem 6.10 if we can show that I −A is surjective.
In other words, given y ∈W, we wish to solve the equation
(I −A)x = y
or, equivalently, the equation
x = Ax + y.
But this is precisely an inhomogenous ﬁxed point problem, and since A is assumed
to be a contraction, a solution exists.
□
We see that the invertibility of I −A is important for the solution of ﬁxed point
problems, and thus also to the solution of systems of linear equations, differential
equations, and integral equations. While the condition ∥A∥< 1 gives a sufﬁcient
condition for the existence of (I −A)−1 it does not provide us with any feasible
means of obtaining the inverse. The following result remedies the situation.
Deﬁnition 6.6 Let A : V →V be a linear operator on a normed space V . The series
∞
k=0 Ak, where A0 is interpreted as the identity operator, is called the Neumann
series of A.
Recall the notation B(V, W) for the set of all bounded linear operators A : V →
W. When V = W we will write B(V ) instead of B(V, W). Similarly, for a Banach
space B, we write B(B) instead of B(B, B).
Theorem 6.11 Let A : V →V be a linear operator on a normed space V . If the
Neumann series for A converges in the operator norm, then the Neumann series is
the inverse of I −A.
Proof Suppose that the Neumann series converges to the operator S, that is
S = lim
m→∞
m

k=0
Ak
with respect to the operator norm in the space B(V ). Since
(I −A)

k=0
Ak = I −Am+1,
when m tends to ∞we obtain
(I −A)
∞

k=0
Ak = I −lim
m→∞Am+1.
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to verify that if the Neumann series of A
converges, then Am →0 in the operator norm, and thus we see that the Neumann

The expected sufﬁcient condition on an operator A on a Banach space guaranteeing
the convergence of the Neumann series is given in the next result.

Fixed Point Techniques Revisited
The ﬁxed point techniques in Sect. 6.2 relied on point-wise convergence. The con-
vergence of the Neumann series though is strong convergence (i.e., in the operator
norm), a form of convergence much stronger than point-wise convergence. We thus
expect to have greater control over the situation when the Neumann series can be
brought into the playground when solving a ﬁxed point problem. We now look again
at some of the differential and integral equations we solved above and witness the
enhancement due to the strong convergence.
Example 6.9 Consider the linear Fredholm equation
x(t) = λ
 b
a
ds K(t, s)x(s) + f (t) = λAx + f
with K(t, s), known as the kernel, continuous in the square [a, b] × [a, b], and f (t)
continuous in the interval [a, b]. Since
|K(t, s)| ≤M
=⇒
∥A∥≤|λ|M(b −a) = q

Notice further that for all t, s ∈[a, b]
|λi Ki(t, s)| ≤|λ|i Mi(b −a)i ≤qi,
and, since 0 ≤q < 1 by assumption, the series
K(t, s; λ) =


i=1
λi Ki(t, s),
converges uniformly in [a, b] × [a, b]. The function K(t, s; λ) is called the resolvent
kernel and is a continuous function in the square [a, b] × [a, b] (as a uniform limit
of continuous functions). From here it follows that
x(t) = f (t) +

and thus we can perform the same series expansion as above. The resolvent kernel

Let us now reconsider the Volterra equation, in light of the more powerful technique
of the Neumann series.

x(t) = λ

ds K(t, s) x(s) + f (t) = λAx + f,
with the usual assumption of continuity and boundedness on K(t, s) and f (t), and

Compared with the previous treatment of the Fredholm equation by means of point-
wise ﬁxed point solutions, here the integral does not extend over the entire interval
[a, b] but only up to t, which in turn becomes the integration variable of the next
iteration. Since usually integration makes functions smoother, we expect to obtain
better conditions on the values of λ for which the iterative solution is converging.
Then, consider the solution
x(t) =

which certainly exists at least for those values of λ found for the linear Fredholm

Remark 6.2 In the previous examples the L∞norm has always been assumed. This
was done in order to allow for the machinery developed thus far. It should be noted
though that this does not exclude the existence of non-continuous solutions, i.e., ones
that we have excluded a priori.

The kernel K(t, s) = st−s is continuous in the integration domain with s ≤t, so
that the equation admits the unique continuous solution x = 0. However, there exist
inﬁnitely many solutions not belonging to C([a, b], R), given by x(t) = c tt−1 with

Dual Spaces
A good understanding of an object is intimately coupled with a sound understanding
of how it relates, via structure preserving functions, to other objects. For a normed
space V the simplest non-trivial case is understanding the linear operators V →K
to the ground ﬁeld. If V is ﬁnite dimensional, then all such operators are bounded
and the situation is reduced to elementary linear algebra. Let us quickly recall the
details where, for simplicity, we take the ground ﬁeld to be R. The dual space of a
ﬁnite-dimensional linear space V is the linear space V ∗= Hom(V, R) of all linear
operators A : V →R where R is viewed as a linear space over itself in the usual
way. Given a basis for V one can associate with it its dual basis, forming a basis
for V ∗. In particular, showing that V and V ∗have the same dimension, and thus are
isomorphic.
In the inﬁnite-dimensional case the boundedness constraint is signiﬁcant. A
bounded operator is rather tame yet at the same time it is signiﬁcantly harder to
construct one since not only the linear structure but also the topology of V must

6.4 Dual Spaces
241
be taken into consideration. A Hamel basis for V can still be used to produce lin-
ear operators but, even if one actually had a Hamel basis written down, ensuring
boundedness is hopeless.
With that in mind we tend to deﬁne the dual space in the inﬁnite-dimensional
context, look at some dual spaces of classical spaces, and have a brief look at the
Hahn-Banach Theorem. The latter is the main theoretical tool that addresses the
difﬁculty of constructing exemplars in the dual space. As said, Hamel bases are
blind to the topology and thus unhelpful for constructing bounded operators. The
Hahn-Banach Theorem is the surrogate tool. Its proof uses the Axiom of Choice in
a signiﬁcant way and so one should not expect it to produce explicit operators.
6.4.1
Duality
A ﬁrst look at linear functionals was given in Sect. 5.5 for the classical spaces ℓp and
L p where we looked at the bounded functionals on these spaces. More generally, the
bounded linear operators to the ground ﬁeld on any normed space is an important
object of study.
Deﬁnition 6.7 A linear functional on a normed space V is a linear operator V →K
to the ground ﬁeld K (either K = R or K = C). The set of all bounded linear
functionals F : V →K is denoted by V ∗and is called the dual space of V .
Of course, the general theory of linear operators specializes to linear functionals so,
in particular, V ∗is a Banach space. In Chap. 5 we discussed evaluation functionals
as well as summation and integration functionals. Taking the limit of a sequence is
a linear functional on the space c of convergent sequences, and there are many other
functionals of practical interest.
Recall from Deﬁnition 5.6 that a linear isometry A: V →W between normed
spaces is a linear isomorphism that preserves the norms. Real normed spaces V
and W are said to be congruent if there exists a linear isometry between them.
In the complex case we say that V and W are congruent if there exists a function
A: V →W satisfying the same properties as a linear isometry except for conjugating
the homogeneity condition, i.e., A(αx) = αA(x). For some spaces one can, with
varying amounts of effort, compute the dual space and understand it well up to
congruency. For example, write (Cn, ∥−∥p) for the linear space Cn equipped with
the speciﬁc norm ∥−∥p for 1 ≤p ≤∞and let q satisfy 1/p + 1/q = 1. Then from
the results of Sect. 5.5 we have
(Cn, ∥−∥p)∗∼= (Cn, ∥−∥q)
and, with similar notation, also
(Pn, ∥−∥p)∗∼= (Pn, ∥−∥q).

242

Banach Spaces
More substantially, the results of Sect. 5.5 constitute almost all the details for a proof
of the following classical result due to Riesz.
Theorem 6.12 For the classical sequence and function spaces the following con-
gruences hold.
1. c∗
0 ∼= ℓ1 and (C([a, b], C), ∥−∥∞)∗∼= L1.
2. ℓ∗
1 ∼= ℓ∞and L∗
1 ∼= L∞.
3. ℓ∗
p ∼= ℓq and L∗
p ∼= Lq for all 1 < p, q < ∞such that 1/p + 1/q = 1.
These explicit expressions for the dual space reveal a special property of the
spaces ℓp and L p for all 1 < p < ∞, namely that the dual of the dual is the original
space. To formalize this observation, we note that generally, given a Banach space B,
there is a canonical function  : B →B∗∗to the double dual of B, namely the dual
space of B∗. The function  must map a vector x ∈B to a bounded linear operator
(x): B∗→K. It is deﬁned by
(x)(F) = F(x)
and it is bounded since
∥(x)(F)∥= ∥F(x)∥≤∥F∥· ∥x∥
that in fact shows that
∥(x)∥≤∥x∥
and it is natural to expect  to be an isometry. To show that ∥(x)∥= ∥x∥it would
be very helpful to have a bounded functional Fx of norm 1 with the property that
Fx(x) = ∥x∥, since then the norm of (x) would be attained at Fx and give us the
desired equality. Constructing a functional Fx with Fx(x) = ∥x∥is a triviality: if
x = 0 take F = 0, otherwise extend x to a Hamel basis and then obtain Fx by linear
extension. However, there is no guarantee that such a functional will be bounded. In
the next subsection we present the Hahn-Banach Theorem that, among other things,
will enable us to construct the bounded functional we are after. Therefore, we will be
able to show that the function  is in fact an isometry. However, in general it need
not be surjective and thus not an isometric isomorphism. Spaces for which this is the
case form an important class of Banach spaces.
Deﬁnition 6.8 If the canonical mapping B →B∗∗is an isometric isomorphism,
then the Banach space B is reﬂexive.
We can now restate the previous observations as follows. In the families of Banach
spaces ℓp and L p the reﬂexive spaces are those where 1 < p < ∞.

6.4 Dual Spaces

6.4.2
The Hahn-Banach Theorem
We saw that it is possible to exhibit elements in the dual space for some inﬁnite-
dimensional Banach spaces. Often, though, one has a bounded linear operator deﬁned
only on a portion of the space and one wants to extend it to a bounded linear operator
on the whole space. Here the linear structure and the topology pull in different
directions. Preserving linearity is a rigid requirement that is difﬁcult to achieve while
maintaining boundedness. The solution is the Hahn-Banach Theorem. It does not rely
on the completeness of the norm and is thus valid for general normed spaces. After
establishing it we present some of its consequences that further relate a space and its
dual.
Theorem 6.13 (Hahn-Banach) Let V be a normed space over K, with either K = R
or K = C. Suppose that U ⊆V is a linear subspace and f : U →K a bounded
linear functional on the subspaceU. There exists then a linear functional F : V →K
such that F|U = f and ∥F∥= ∥f ∥.
Proof For simplicity, we only give the proof for real normed spaces. Thus we assume
that a bounded linear functional f : U →R is given. Clearly, if f = 0, then F = 0
is the desired extension to all of V . We may thus proceed under the assumption that
f ̸= 0, and thus, normalizing if needed, that ∥f ∥= 1. Suppose that x0 ∈V \ U and
let U1 be the span of U ∪{x0}. It is easy to see that U1 consists of all vectors of the
form x + βx0, where x ∈U and β ∈R. Notice that, given any α ∈R, the function
f1(x + βx0) = f (x) + βα
is a linear functional on U1 and it extends U. We will now show that an α ∈R can be
chosen so as to assure that ∥f1∥= 1. By the deﬁnition of the norm ∥f1∥it sufﬁces
to guarantee that
| f (x) + βα| ≤∥x + βx0∥,
for all x ∈U and β ∈R. Stated differently (replace x by −βx and divide both sides
by |β|), we seek an α such that
| f (x) −α| ≤∥x −x0∥
for all x ∈U. We thus wish to ﬁnd an α ∈R with
f (x) −∥x −x0∥≤α ≤f (x) + ∥x −x0∥
for all x ∈U. In other words, α is common to all the intervals [Ax, Bx], for all x ∈U,
where Ax = f (x) −∥x −x0∥and Bx = f (x) + ∥x −x0∥. The existence of such an
α will follow by showing that Ax ≤By for all x, y ∈U. And indeed,
By −Ax = f (y) −f (x) + ∥y −x0∥+ ∥x −x0∥

244
6
Banach Spaces
and since
| f (y) −f (x)| = | f (y −x)| ≤∥y −x∥≤∥y −x0∥+ ∥x −x0∥
it follows that
By −Ax ≥0.
We thus established that f , and in fact any linear operator deﬁned on a proper
subspace, can be extended to the span of its current domain with one additional
vector added, without altering the norm.
The stage is now clear for an application of Zorn’s Lemma to further extend f1,
one dimension at a time, until we arrive at a linear operator whose domain is the
entire space V . Let P be the collection of all pairs (U ′, f ′) where U ′ ⊇U is a linear
subspace of V and f ′ : U ′ →R is a linear functional extending f and satisfying
∥f ′∥= 1. Introduce a partial order on P by means of
(U ′, f ′) ≤(U ′′, f ′′)
precisely when U ′ ⊆U ′′ and when f ′′ extends f ′. The fact that P is then a poset,
is immediate. We must now establish the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma. Firstly, P
is non-empty since (U, f ) is a member of P. Next, given a chain {(Ui, fi)}i∈I in
P, consider U ′ = 
i∈I Ui and deﬁne f ′ : U ′ →R as follows. Given u ∈U ′ there
exists an index i ∈I with u ∈Ui. If j ∈I is another index with u ∈U j, then, since
we are given a chain, either fi extends f j or f j extends fi. In either case setting
f ′(u) = fi(u) = f j(u) produces a well-deﬁned function. The function f ′ is a linear
functional. Indeed, if u1, u2 ∈U ′, thenu1 ∈Ui1 andu2 ∈Ui2 for somei1, i2 ∈I. But,
by the chain condition, we may assume without loss of generality that Ui1 ⊆Ui2.
Thus
f ′(u1 + u2) = fi2(u1 + u2) = fi2(u1) + fi2(u2) = f ′(u1) + f ′(u2)
and thus f ′ is additive. A similar argument shows that f is also homogenous. We
leave it to the reader to similarly show that ∥f ′∥= 1 and thus it is now clear that
(U ′, f ′) is in P and is an upper bound for the given chain. Note however that there
is no guarantee that f ′ is the desired linear functional F, since U ′ may be properly
contained in V .
With the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma now veriﬁed, the existence of a maximal
element (UM, F) ∈P is guaranteed. If UM = V , then F is a linear functional on all
of V , it extends f , and its norm is 1, as required. Assume thus that UM is properly
contained in V , and let x0 ∈V −UM. But, at the beginning of the proof we saw that in
such a situation F can be extended to the linear subspace U!, the span of UM ∪{x0},
without altering the norm. That would give rise to an element (U!, f!) ∈P with
(UM F) < (U!, f!), an impossibility. The proof is thus complete.

We explore a handful of the applications of the Hahn-Banach Theorem.

6.4 Dual Spaces

Theorem 6.14 Given a normed space V and x0 ∈V with x0 ̸= 0 there exists a
linear functional F ∈V ∗such that ∥F∥= 1 and F(x0) = ∥x0∥.
Proof Let
V0 = {αx0 | α ∈K}
be the subspace of V spanned by x0 and let F0 : V0 →K be given by
F0(αx0) = α∥x0∥.
Clearly, F0 is a linear functional, ∥F0∥= 1, and F0(x0) = ∥x0∥. By the Hahn-Banach
Theorem, an extension F ∈V ∗exists, establishing the claim.

|F(x)|.
Corollary 6.5 For all vectors x in a normed space V , if F(x) = 0 for all F ∈V ∗,
then x = 0.
We may now return to the natural embedding  : B →B∗∗of B in its double dual,
given by (x)(F) = F(x).
Theorem 6.15 For all Banach spaces B the embedding  is an isometry.
Proof We already noted that ∥(x)∥≤∥x∥by direct computation, but now we can
do better:
∥(x)∥=

F∈V ∗,∥F∥=1
|(x)(F)| =

|F(x)| = ∥x∥.
□
Another result uses the Hahn-Banach Theorem to show that there are sufﬁciently
many bounded functionals to separate a point from the closure of a subspace.
Theorem 6.16 Let V be normed space and U a linear subspace of it. Given x0 ∈U
it holds that x0 is in the closure of U if, and only if, there exists no bounded linear
functional f on V such that f (x) = 0 for all x ∈U but f (x0) ̸= 0.
Proof Suppose that x0 is in the closure of U. There exists then a sequence {un}n≥1
of element in U converging to x0. Remembering that a bounded linear functional
f : V →K is in particular continuous, it follows that f (un) →f (x0). But then, if
f (x) = 0 for all x ∈U, it follows that f (x0) = 0. In the other direction, suppose x0
is not in the closure of U. Then there exists a positive δ such that ∥x −x0∥> δ, for
all x ∈U. Consider the span U ′ of the set U ∪{x0}. Deﬁne now f1(x + βx0) = β
(remember that the elements of the span are of the form x + βx0, with β ∈K and
x ∈U). This is clearly a linear functional on U1 and since

246
6
Banach Spaces
δ|β| ≤|β|∥x0 + 1
β x∥= ∥βx0 + x∥
we have that ∥f1∥≤1/δ. Since, by deﬁnition, f1(x) = 0 for all x ∈U and f1(x0) =
1, applying the Hahn-Banach Theorem to extend f ′ to all of V establishes the
claim.

Unbounded Operators and Locally Convex Spaces
The theory presented so far is that of bounded linear operators between normed
spaces. In this section we present two directions for generalization of the theory.
The ﬁrst one stems from the observation that while bounded operators encompass
many examples of interest, some important operators, the differentiation operator for
instance, are not bounded. One is thus compelled to consider unbounded operators.
The second generalization we consider originates from the fact that at times the space
one is considering does not support a norm. It turns out that if instead of a norm one
has a suitable family of semi-norms, then one can still recover much of the general
theory. Spaces with such a family of semi-norms are called locally convex spaces. We
will only investigate the deﬁnition and some illustrative examples without delving
any deeper than that.

6.5.1
Closed Operators
The development of the theory of unbounded linear operators was motivated by the
unbounded nature of the differentiation operator, as well as the development of a
mathematical framework for quantum mechanics (e.g., to account for unbounded
observables). Arbitrary unbounded operators may be too wild to tame, and so some
restrictions must be placed in order to identify a suitable class of operators for which
a reasonable theory emerges. Closed operators form a class of operators broader
than the bounded ones admitting a strong general theory that allows one to analyze
situations that lie out of reach of the theory of bounded operators. The results we
present below are only the tip of the unbounded iceberg.
In the context of unbounded linear operators it is common to re-interpret the
deﬁnition of an operator between linear spaces to be one that is not necessarily
deﬁned on all of the speciﬁed domain.
Deﬁnition 6.9 Let B1 and B2 be Banach spaces. An (unbounded) linear operator
A : B1 →B2 consists of a linear subspace D(A) ⊆B1 and a function A : D(A) →
B2 that is additive and homogenous. Further, A is a closed linear operator when the
following condition holds. For every sequence {xm}m≥1 in B1 if xm →x0 for some
x0 ∈B1 and Axm →y0 for some y0 ∈B2, then x0 ∈D(A) and Ax0 = y0.
Example 6.14 In Example 6.4 we saw that the differentiation operator d/dt :
C1([0, 1], R) →C([0, 1], R), with the L∞norm, is an unbounded linear operator.
In the context of unbounded operators we may thus consider
d/dt : C([0, 1], R) →C([0, 1], R),
with the L∞norm, where we may specify various different subspaces as the domain
of deﬁnition. Different choices for the actual domain may lead to completely different
properties of the operator. For instance, if we take the domain to be C1([a, b], R),
then we obtain an unbounded closed operator. Indeed, this claim follows from the
elementary result that if {xm}m≥1 is a sequence of functions that converges (point-
wise) to x0, and their derivatives x′
m converge uniformly to y0, then x0 is differentiable
and x′
0 = y0. In contrast, taking the domain of d/dt to be C∞([0, 1], R) yields a non-
closed operator.
The deﬁning condition of a closed operator A : B1 →B2 can be restated in terms of
its graph (A) = {(x, Ax) ∈B1 × B2 | x ∈D(A)}, as follows.
Proposition 6.3 An unbounded linear operator A : B1 →B2 between Banach
spaces is closed if, and only if, the graph (A) is closed in B1 × B2.
The proof is left for the reader. We prove that a closed linear operator is automatically
bounded, provided its domain is closed.
Theorem 6.17 (Banach’s Closed Graph Theorem) Let A : B1 →B2 be a closed
linear operator between Banach spaces. If the domain D(A) is closed in B1, then A
is bounded.

6.5 Unbounded Operators and Locally Convex Spaces
249
Proof First, it is straightforward to verify that the space B1 × B2 with norm given
by
∥(x, y)∥= ∥x∥+ ∥y∥
is a Banach space. Since A is closed, its graph (A) ⊆B1 × B2 is thus a closed subset
of a complete space and thus is itself a Banach space. Similarly, by assumption, D(A)
is closed in B1 and thus is a Banach space too.
We now consider the operator P : (A) →D(A) given by
P(x, Ax) = x,
clearly a linear operator. Since
∥P(x, Ax)∥= ∥x∥≤∥x∥+ ∥Ax∥= ∥(x, Ax)∥
we see that P is a bounded linear operator. Moreover, P is invertible (its inverse P−1
obviously given by x →(x, Ax)) and thus, by Corollary 6.1, P−1 is bounded, say
by M. Therefore,
∥P−1x∥= ∥x∥+ ∥Ax∥≤M∥x∥
for all x ∈D(A), and thus
∥Ax∥≤(M −1)∥x∥
showing A is bounded.
□
This is yet another deep result in the theory of Banach spaces; this short proof uses a
corollary of the Open Mapping Theorem. In fact, each of the open mapping theorem,
the bounded inverse theorem, and the closed graph theorem can be used to prove the
other two.
6.5.2
Locally Convex Spaces
As motivation for the next concept consider the set R∞of all sequences of real
numbers (with obvious modiﬁcations one may also consider C∞). Of course the
linear structure of R carries over to R∞by point-wise operations and thus R∞is a
linear space. However, there is no natural way to turn R∞into a normed space. In
particular, each ℓp norm is only deﬁned on a proper subset of R∞and cannot be
extended to a norm on R∞. There is however a natural choice of a family of semi-
norms, deﬁned as follows. For eachi ∈N let pk : R∞→R be given by pk(x) = |xk|,
the absolute value of the k-th component of x. It is easily seen that pk is indeed a
semi-norm.
We thus see that in the absence of a norm a space may still admit a family of
semi-norms and it is the case that, under suitable conditions, signiﬁcant portions of

250
6
Banach Spaces
the theory developed above (in particular the Hahn-Banach Theorem) admit suitable
analogues. We present the deﬁnition and explore some of the most basic aspects of
these spaces.
Deﬁnition 6.10 A locally convex linear space is a linear space V together with a
family {Pi}i∈I of semi-norms on V . The family of semi-norms is said to separate
points if from pi(x) = 0 for all i ∈I it follows that x = 0.
Example 6.15 Of course any normed space and any semi-normed space is a locally
convex space. It is not hard to show that any locally convex space given by a ﬁnite
family of semi-norms is in fact semi-normed. Thus the concept of locally convex
spaces becomes substantial only when once considers families of inﬁnitely many
semi-norms, as in the case of R∞above.
We now consider the topology induced by the family of semi-norms in a locally
convex space.
Deﬁnition 6.11 Let V be a locally convex space given by the family {pi}i∈I of
semi-norms. For each i ∈I and y ∈V let fi,y : V →R be the function
fi,y(x) = pi(x −y).
The induced topology on V is the smallest topology such that each of fi,y : V →R
is continuous.
The existence of such a smallest topology is guaranteed by Proposition 3.11. In fact,
from the proof of that proposition, a local base at y for the induced topology is given
by the collection UB,ε, where B ⊆I is a ﬁnite subset of indices, ε > 0, and
UB,ε = {x ∈V | pi(x −y) < ε
∀i ∈B}.
The following result follows easily and its proof is left for the reader.
Proposition 6.4 Let V be a locally convex space given by the family {pi}i∈I of
semi-norms.
1. A sequence {xm}m≥1 in V converges to x0 ∈V in the induced topology if, and
only if, pi(xm −x0) →0 for all i ∈I.
2. The induced topology is Hausdorff if, and only if, the family of semi-norms
separates points.
3. The linear space operations are continuous.
With these observations made, the similarities between the theory of normed
spaces we developed above and the theory of locally convex spaces with separated
points is only starting to become visible. Without a doubt, it is more convenient to
have a single norm and appeal to the rich theory of normed spaces whenever possible.
However, often enough a norm is simply not available. The theory of locally convex
spaces is rich enough so as to justify the somewhat cumbersome management of

6.5 Unbounded Operators and Locally Convex Spaces
251
a family of semi-norms instead of a single norm. As mentioned above, signiﬁcant
portions of the theory of (semi-)normed spaces transfers quite smoothly to the theory
of locally convex spaces, however we do not explore this any further.
Exercises
Exercise 6.39 Let F : B →K be a linear functional on a Banach space B over the
ﬁeld K. Show that Ker(F) is a closed subspace of B if, and only if, F is bounded.
Show further that if F is unbounded, then its kernel is a dense linear subspace of B.
Exercise 6.40 Prove that if B1 and B2 are Banach spaces, then so is B1 × B2 with
norm given by ∥(x, y)∥= ∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
Exercise 6.41 Prove that if A : B1 →B2 is a closed linear operator, then its kernel
Ker(A) is a closed subspace of B1.
Exercise 6.42 Prove that any bounded linear operator is a closed operator.
Exercise 6.43 Prove Proposition 6.3.
Exercise 6.44 Let V be a normed space. We may now consider an induced topology
on it in two ways. Namely, we may view it as a locally convex space where the family
of semi-norms consists of just the given norm on V , and obtain the induced topology,
or we may consider the induced metric d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥and consider its induced
topology. Show that the two topologies coincide.
Exercise 6.45 Prove that every locally convex linear space V deﬁned using a ﬁnite
family {pi}i∈I of semi-norms is semi-normed. In more detail, construct a single
semi-norm on V which induces the same topology as the ﬁnite family of semi-norms
does.
Exercise 6.46 Let V be a locally convex space given by a countable family {pi}i≥1
of semi-norms. Consider the function d : V × V →R given by
d(x, y) =

pi(x −y)
pi(x −y) + 1.
Prove that (V, d) is a semi-metric space, and that it is a metric space if, and only if,
the family of norms separates points.
Exercise 6.47 Continuing the previous exercise, show that the topologies induced
by the semi-metric and by the family of semi-norms coincide.
Exercise 6.48 Consider R with the standard structure of an inner product space and
let V = C(R, R) be the linear space of all continuous functions x : R →R. For each
t ∈R let
pt(x) = |x(t)|.

For each n ∈N let
qn(x) = max
−n≤t≤n |x(t)|.
For each compact subset C ⊆R let
rC(x) = max

For each of the families {pt}t∈R, {qn}n∈N, and {rC}C ⊆R, where C ranges over the
compact subsets of R, decide whether it endows V with the structure of a locally
convex space, whether the family of semi-norms separates points, and compare the
induced topologies.
Exercise 6.49 Prove Proposition 6.4.

Chapter 7
Topological Groups
Banach spaces admit a particularly rich theory since the algebraic structure (i.e., the
norm) induces a particularly nice metric (i.e., a complete one) resulting in a powerful
interaction between algebra and geometry. Quite often, when an algebraic structure
and a topological structure are allowed to interact, the fusion of the two theories
results in an intricate and interesting new theory. One such fusion is the focus of this
chapter.
There are at least two motivating reasons for considering topological groups. The
ﬁrst one is that just as groups model symmetry, topological groups model continuous
symmetry. The second reason for studying topological groups is that quite often a
portion of, say, a Banach space may fail to be a Banach space on its own but it
may still retain enough of the algebra and the topology of the ambient space to
form a topological group. This is often the case since a group is a much weaker
algebraic structure compared to a linear space, and a topology is much weaker than a
metric (whether or not induced by a norm). Topological groups thus are much more
common-place since one only requires a group structure and a topology, rather than
a full linear space and a metric structure, yet the theory of topological groups still
presents a powerful fusion between algebra and geometry.
Section 7.1 introduces groups and group homomorphisms, without assuming any
prior knowledge of groups. The main objects of study, namely topological groups,
are then presented in Sect. 7.2. Section 7.3 presents topological subgroups and a ﬁrst
encounter with the interesting interaction between algebra and topology, namely that
the closure of a subgroup is a subgroup. The quotient construction for topological
groups is the topic of Sect. 7.4, including a rather detailed account of normal sub-
groups. Finally, Sect. 7.5 discusses another, deeper, consequence of the interaction
between algebra and topology, namely the uniformizability of the topology of a
topological group, thus enabling one to import signiﬁcant portions of the uniform
machinery of metric spaces into the realm of topological groups.

Topological Groups
7.1
Groups and Homomorphisms
The axioms deﬁning a group are an abstraction of structure present in many familiar
algebraic systems, namely an associative and unital binary operation with respect
to which every element is invertible. The historical development of group theory
is rooted in the study of roots of polynomials, famously with the work of Evariste
Galois and Niels Henrik Abel on ﬁnite groups. There is a distinct difference between
the theory of ﬁnite groups and the theory of inﬁnite groups. In ﬁnite group theory
various counting arguments play an important role in determining the structure of
groups. The recent classiﬁcation of all ﬁnite simple groups, the result of an almost
unfathomable collaboration spanning thousands of articles, is a milestone of ﬁnite
group theory. Inﬁnite groups though can be so wild that a full classiﬁcation of all
groups seems beyond reasonable expectations. Some limitations on size must be
placed, and one way to impose such size constraints is through the introduction of
a topology, and demanding that the group, as a topological space, be compact. The
classiﬁcation of compact Hausdorff topological groups is a much more manageable
project.
With that in mind we present groups with an eye towards their common appli-
cations in Physics (as a formalism of symmetry) and as a step towards deﬁning
topological groups (and thus ﬁnite groups are only glanced at).
Deﬁnition 7.1 A group is a triple (G, ·, e) where G is a set, · is a binary operation
G × G →G, usually denoted by (g, h) →g · h, or even just (g, h) →gh, and
e ∈G is a chosen element, such that the following axioms hold.
1. Associativity, i.e., (g1g2)g3 = g1(g2g3) for all g1, g2, g3 ∈G.
2. The element e is an identity element, i.e., eg = g = ge for all g ∈G.
3. Existence of inverses, i.e., for all g ∈G there exists an element, denoted by
g−1 ∈G and called the inverse of g, satisfying gg−1 = e = g−1g.
If gh = hg holds for all g, h ∈G, then the group is said to be commutative or abelian.
In an abelian group it is customary to write g + h instead of gh, and to denote e, the
neutral element, by 0. The cardinality of G is called the order of the group.
When there is no danger of confusion it is common to refer to a group G, leaving
the operation · and the identity e implicit.
Proposition 7.1 In a group G:
1. The identity is unique, i.e., if e′ ∈G has the property that e′g = g = g′e for all
g ∈G, then e′ = e.
2. Inverses are unique, i.e., for every element g ∈G, if h1, h2 ∈G satisfy
gh2 = gh1 = e = h1g = h2g,
then h1 = h2.

7.1 Groups and Homomorphisms

Proof The arguments are very similar to those given in the proof of Proposition 2.1.
The adaptation is left for the reader.
⊓⊔
Remark 7.1 An inspection of the deﬁnition of linear space (Deﬁnition 2.1) reveals
that we have already encountered abelian groups. Indeed, in that deﬁnition there are
three sets of axioms, the ﬁrst of which states, precisely, that (V, +, 0) is an abelian
group for any linear space V . Thus, had we chosen to present groups prior to linear
spaces, we could have deﬁned a linear space as an abelian group together with a scalar
product, satisfying the other two sets of axioms in the deﬁnition of linear space.
Many examples of groups arise as the set of symmetries of an object. For instance,
ﬁxing an equilateral triangle in the plane, its symmetries correspond to the various
ways in which rigid motions of the plane map the triangle onto itself. The set of
all rigid motions that map the triangle to itself (of which there are precisely six:
the identity, three reﬂections, and two rotations) is a group under the operation of
composition. The veriﬁcation is straightforward: the composition of rigid motions
that ﬁx the triangle is again a rigid motion that ﬁxes the triangle, the identity function
is a rigid motion that ﬁxes the triangle (and thus serves as the identity element of the
group), and the inverse function of a rigid motion that ﬁxes the triangle is again a
rigid motion that ﬁxes the triangle. The resulting group is called the dihedral group
of order 6, one member in the following family of groups
Theorem 7.1 Let P be a regular n-gon in the plane (i.e., a regular polygon with
n vertices), n ≥2. The set Dn of all rigid motions (i.e., functions of the plane to
itself that preserve lengths and angles) together with the operation of composition
of functions is a group.
Proof The reader is invited to turn the argument for D3 given above into a proof of
the general case.
⊓⊔
Remark 7.2 The groups {Dn}n≥2 are known as the dihedral groups. It can be shown
that Dn has order 2n. For that reason, the dihedral group Dn is also commonly (and
confusingly) denoted by D2n.
Of course, one may vary the shape being ﬁxed, as well as the degree to which the
mappings preserve the ambient geometry, or change the ambient geometry itself. As
an extreme example, given a set S, the set of all bijections σ : S →S, together with
composition of functions, is easily seen to be a group. This is the group of symmetries
of the set S, clearly essentially determined only by the cardinality of S. This group
is denoted by Sym(S), or, when S = {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}, by Sn.
Following the same general idea, the following is an important example in the
theory of topological groups.
Theorem 7.2 For n ≥1 let GLn(R) be the set of all invertible linear operators
A : Rn →Rn. With the operation of composition of functions, GLn(R) is a group.
Proof The straightforward veriﬁcation of the axioms, using established results from
Chap. 2, is left for the reader.
⊓⊔

256

Topological Groups
The group GLn(R) is known as the general linear group. It is the group of linear
symmetries of the linear space Rn. By specifying a basis for Rn one may identify
GLn(R) with the set of all invertible n × n matrices with real entries. The group
GLn(R) is essentially the same as the group of invertible n × n matrices over R with
the operation of matrix multiplication. Other important groups are deﬁned in terms
of certain linear symmetries, or, equivalently, as spaces of matrices satisfying various
conditions. See the solved problems section for this chapter for detailed examples.
As a matter of fact, the claim above is a special case of a much more general
source of groups, as we now show.
Theorem 7.3 Let B be a Banach space. The subset G of B(B) consisting of all
invertible bounded linear operators on B, with the operation of composition of func-
tions, is a group.
Proof The implicit claim that the composition of invertible bounded linear operators
is again an invertible bounded linear operator follows from the fact that
∥A1A2∥≤∥A1∥∥A2∥
for all operators A1, A2 ∈B(B), as is easily established. Next, clearly, the identity
idB is a member of B(B), and it serves as the identity element of the group. The
fact that composition of functions is associative is trivially veriﬁed. The fact that
the inverse operator of a bounded operator is bounded is Corollary 6.1 of the Open
Mapping Theorem.
⊓⊔
We now turn to the structure preserving mappings between groups.
Deﬁnition 7.2 A function ψ : G →H between groups is a group homomorphism
(or simply a homomorphism) if
ψ(g1g2) = ψ(g1)ψ(g2)
for all g1, g2 ∈G. If ψ is also bijective, then it is called an isomorphism, and then
the groups G and H are said to be isomorphic, denoted by G ∼= H.
Example 7.1 As said above, in the presence of a basis for Rn there is a bijection
between GLn(R) and GL(n; R), given by mapping an invertible linear operator to
its representing matrix. In fact, this correspondence is a group isomorphism between
the two groups. The determinant function det : GLn(R) →R, that assigns to a linear
operator A : Rn →Rn its determinant (i.e., the determinant of its representing matrix
in any basis) is a group homomorphism det : GLn(R) →R∗. Here R∗is the set of
non-zero real numbers and the group operation is ordinary multiplication. When
n = 1 the determinant det : GL1(R) →R∗is a group isomorphism.
A group homomorphism is only required to preserve the group product in the domain
and codomain. It follows immediately though that the rest of the group structure is
also preserved. For the proof it is helpful to note that the existence of inverses in a

7.1 Groups and Homomorphisms
257
group immediately implies left and right cancelation laws: if gh = gh′, then h = h′
and if hg = h′g, then h = h′.
Proposition 7.2 Let ψ : G →H be a group homomorphism. Then ψ(e) = e and
ψ(g−1) = ψ(g)−1, for all g ∈G.
Proof We only establish that ψ(e) = e (notice that the e on the left is the identity
in G while on the right it is the identity in H, and thus they may be different).
Notice that ψ(e)ψ(e) = ψ(ee) = ψ(e) = eψ(e). The cancelation law now implies
that ψ(e) = e.
⊓⊔
The veriﬁcation of the following properties of homomorphisms and isomorphisms
is very similar to the analogous results established for linear operators, for instance
in Proposition 2.8. We thus omit the details of the proof.
Proposition 7.3 If G1
ϕ
G2
ψ
G3 are group homomorphisms, then
1. The composition ψ ◦ϕ is a homomorphism.
2. If both ϕ and ψ are isomorphisms, then so is ψ ◦ϕ.
3. If ψ is an isomorphism, then so is ψ−1.
4. The identity function idG : G →G is a group isomorphism.
7.2
Topological Groups and Homomorphism
A topological group is a group together with a topology on it that is required to
be compatible with the group structure in the sense that the group operations are
to be continuous. Some of the far-reaching consequences resulting from this fusion
between algebra and topology will be explored in the subsequent sections. In partic-
ular, it will be shown that the topology is then sufﬁciently metric-like so as to render
such concepts as uniform continuity and Cauchy sequences meaningful.
Deﬁnition 7.3 A topological group is a group G together with a topology on the set
G such that the group operation · : G × G →G is continuous (with respect to the
given topology on the codomain and the product topology on the domain), and such
that the function G →G given by g →g−1 is continuous.
Example 7.2 The following examples of topological groups are all subsets of R or
C, and we consider each of them with the subspace topology induced, in each case,
by the metric d(x, y) = |x −y|.
1. The circle S1 = {z ∈C | |z| = 1} with multiplication.
2. The set R of all real numbers with addition.
3. The set R∗of all non-zero real numbers with multiplication.
4. The set C of all complex numbers with addition.
5. The set C∗of all non-zero complex numbers with multiplication.

The next result provides a large repository of examples.
Lemma 7.1 Let V be a normed space. Then (V, +, 0), i.e., the additive structure of
the space, is a topological group.
Proof We already noted that the additive part of a linear space is an abelian group.
The continuity requirements are satisﬁed by Proposition 6.1.
⊓⊔
Another signiﬁcant source of topological groups arises from groups of bounded linear
operators on a Banach space.
Theorem 7.4 Let B be a Banach space. The subset G of B(B) consisting of the
invertible bounded linear operators on B is a topological group when endowed with
the operator norm topology.
Proof Having already observed that G is a group under composition of functions
it remains to verify the continuity of the composition and the inverse mapping with
respect to the operator norm. The continuity of the composition follows at once from
the inequality
∥A1A2∥≤∥A1∥∥A2∥
while the continuity of the inverse mapping is Exercise 6.28.
⊓⊔
Corollary 7.1 The general linear group GLn(R), when endowed with the operator
norm topology, is a topological group (which is not abelian if n > 1).
Proof GLn(R) is precisely the group of invertible operators on the Banach space
Rn.
⊓⊔
Since a topological group is a fusion between a group and a topological space, so
are homomorphisms of topological groups a fusion between group homomorphisms
and continuous mappings.
Deﬁnition 7.4 A function ψ : G →H between topological groups is said to be a
homomorphism if ψ is both continuous and a group homomorphism. We say that ψ
is an isomorphism if ψ is both a group isomorphism and a homeomorphism. If an
isomorphism between topological groups G and H exists, then the groups are said
to be isomorphic, denoted by G ∼= H.
Example 7.3 In a topological group G, the mapping g →g−1 is a homeomorphism
but not usually a group homomorphism. It is a group homomorphism if G is abelian,
since then
(gh)−1 = g−1h−1
while in general one only has the equality
(gh)−1 = h−1g−1.

7.2 Topological Groups and Homomorphism
259
For any ﬁxed element a ∈G, the left translation mapping g →ag and the right
translation mapping g →ga are both homeomorphisms, but are generally not group
homomorphisms. The determinant function det : GLn(R) →R∗is continuous (since
the determinant is polynomial in the entries of the matrix) and, as we have seen,
is a group homomorphism, and thus is a homomorphism of topological groups.
det : GL1(R) →R∗is an isomorphism.
The reader is invited to state and prove the analogous result of Proposition 7.3 for
topological homomorphisms and isomorphisms.
7.3
Topological Subgroups
A topological subgroup of a topological group is a subset that is on its own right
a topological group with the induced algebraic and topological structures from the
ambient topological group. In other words, a topological subgroup is a fusion of the
concepts subgroup and topological subspace. Fortunately, it turns out that the sub-
space topology on a subgroup is automatically compatible with the group structure,
and thus it is only the algebraic structure that dictates what the topological sub-
groups are. Consequently, there is no difference between the topological subgroups
of a topological group and its subgroups when the topology is forgotten.
In light of the above, we focus on the notion of subgroup and, anticipating the
contents of the next section, already discuss normal subgroups. We then observe
the ﬁrst non-trivial consequence of the interaction of the algebra and the topology,
namely that the closure of a subgroup is a subgroup.
Deﬁnition 7.5 A subset H of a group G is a subgroup of G if the group operation in
G restricts to a group operation on H. Equivalently, H is a subgroup of G if e ∈H
and for all h1, h2 ∈H
h1h−1
2
∈H.
The motivation for the following deﬁnition is presented in the next section.
Deﬁnition 7.6 A subgroup H of a group G is said to be normal if ghg−1 ∈H for
all h ∈H and g ∈G. The element ghg−1 is called the conjugate of h by g. Thus, a
subgroup is normal when it is closed under conjugation.
Remark 7.3 Note that the condition for normality of H in G is equivalent to: for
all g ∈G and h ∈H, there exists h′ ∈G such that
hg = gh′.
Thus, the condition of normality can be seen as a weak form of commutativity;
elements in G commute with elements in H, up to a replacement by another element
in H. If G is abelian, then every subgroup H of G is normal.

Topological Groups
Example 7.4 Given a group homomorphism ψ : G →H its kernel is the set
Ker(ψ) = {g ∈G | ψ(g) = e}. The kernel of a homomorphism is easily seen to
be a normal subgroup of G. One may also easily verify (compare with Theorem 2.8)
that Ker(ψ) = {e}, i.e., the kernel is the trivial subgroup of G, if, and only if, ψ is
injective.
Regarding subgroups of a topological group G, the presence of a topology entails
no complications, at least in the following sense.
Lemma 7.2 Let G be a topological group and H a subgroup of G. When endowed
with the subspace topology, H is a topological group.
The proof is immediate, relying on the simple fact that the restriction of a continuous
mapping to a subspace remains continuous.
We may now demonstrate one consequence of the fruitful interaction between the
group structure and the topology.
Theorem 7.5 If H is a (normal) subgroup of a topological group G, then H, the
closure of H, is also a (normal) subgroup of G.
Proof Toshowthat H isasubgroup,weneedtoshowthat gh−1 ∈H forall g, h ∈H.
In other words, for the function f : G × G →G given by f (g, h) = gh−1 we need
to establish that f (H × H) ⊆H. Since f is clearly continuous and H is closed, it
follows that f −1(H) is closed. Next, H × H ⊆f −1(H) ⊆f −1(H), where the ﬁrst
inclusion follows from the fact that H is a subgroup and the second inclusion since
H ⊆H. Taking closures leads to H × H ⊆f −1(H) = f −1(H). The result follows
by noting that H × H = H × H (this latter fact is a general property of closures
that has nothing to do with the group structure on H). We leave it to the reader to
verify that if H is a normal subgroup, then so is H.
⊓⊔
7.4
Quotient Groups
Whereas the notion of subgroup of a topological group was quite straightforward,
with a seamless interaction between the algebraic and the topological demands, the
situation for the quotient of a topological group by a subgroup is more intricate. The
main difﬁculty lies with the algebraic structure, namely that for an arbitrary subgroup
H it is not always possible to obtain a group structure on the relevant quotient set.
Topologically however, there are no difﬁculties since the quotient topology is always
available.
Given a group G and a subgroup H deﬁning g1 ∼g2 precisely when g−1
1 g2 ∈H
is easily seen to be an equivalence relation on G. The equivalence class of g ∈G is
the set
gH = {gh | h ∈H}

7.4 Quotient Groups
261
and is called the left coset of g. In particular, two left cosets g1H and g2H are equal
if, and only if, g−1
1 g2 ∈H. Similarly, deﬁning g1 ∼g2 precisely when g1g−1
2
∈H
gives rise to an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are all of the form
Hg = {hg | h ∈H}
andarecalledright cosets (of H in G). Of course, if G is abelian, thentheleft andright
cosets coincide, but in general they may be different. However, any general result
concerning left cosets in a group has a corresponding dual result about right cosets.
In fact the translation between results on left and right cosets is achieved by means
of the correspondence gH ↔Hg−1. For this reason, we may safely concentrate on
the left cosets.
Any choice of a subgroup H of G gives rise to an equivalence relation ∼with
corresponding quotient set
G/H = {gH | g ∈G},
the set of all left cosets of H in G, with the corresponding canonical projection
π : G →G/H given by π(g) = gH. We address the question whether the group
structure on G induces a group structure on G/H.
Theorem 7.6 Let H be a subgroup of a group G. If the operation on G/H given by
(g1H) · (g2H) = (g1g2)H is well deﬁned, then it deﬁnes a group structure on G/H
and π : G →G/H is a group homomorphism.
Proof The veriﬁcation of the group axioms is trivial. For instance, noticing that the
coset eH is precisely the set H we show that H is an identity element for the given
operation. Let gH ∈G/H be an arbitrary element. Then
H · gH = eH · gH = (eg)H = gH
and similarly gH · H = gH. We leave the veriﬁcation of the other group axioms to
the reader. The claim that π is a group homomorphism is nothing but the observation
that π(g1g2) = (g1g2)H = g1H · g2H = π(g1)π(g2).
⊓⊔
We thus see that as soon as the operation (g1H) · (g2H) = (g1g2)H is well deﬁned
the quotient set G/H acquires a group structure. For the operation to be well deﬁned
one needs to verify that if g1H = g3H and g2H = g4H, then necessarily g1g2H =
g3g4H. In other words, given that g−1
1 g3 ∈H and g−1
2 g4 ∈H, it must follow that
(g1g2)−1g3g4 ∈H. Let us denote g−1
1 g3 = h1 and g−1
2 g4 = h2. Noting that
(g1g2)−1g3g4 = g−1
2 g−1
1 g3g4 = g−1
2 h1g4,
if G were abelian, then we would obtain that
(g1g2)−1g3g4 = g−1
2 g4h1 = h2h1 ∈H,

262
7
Topological Groups
as desired. However, G need not be abelian. A closer look though reveals that a
commutativity demand is far too strong. Indeed, if H is a normal subgroup of G,
then for g4 and h1 as above, there exists h′ ∈H such that h1g4 = g4h′, and then
(g1g2)−1g3g4 = g−1
2 h1g4 = g−1
2 g4h′ = h1h′ ∈H.
We summarize this discussion as follows, remarking ﬁrst that for a normal subgroup
H in G it follows at once that the left and right cosets of H in G coincide, and thus
one may simply speak of the cosets of H in G.
Theorem 7.7 If H is a normal subgroup of G, then the quotient set G/H of all
cosets of H in G is a group when endowed with the operation
(g1H) · (g2H) = (g1g2)H.
The canonical projection π : G →G/H is then a group homomorphism. The group
G/H is called the quotient group of G by H.
Corollary 7.2 A subgroup H of a group G is normal if, and only if, H is the kernel
of some group homomorphism whose domain is G.
Proof It was already noted that the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup.
For the converse, show that
Ker(π) = H
for the canonical projection π : G →G/H.
⊓⊔
The situation now for a topological group G and a subgroup H of it is summarized
in the following result whose proof is left for the reader.
Theorem 7.8 Let G be a topological group and H a subgroup.
1. The set {gH | g ∈G} of all left cosets of H in G is the quotient set for the
equivalencerelation g1 ∼g2 ⇐⇒g−1
1 g2 ∈H.Whenendowedwiththequotient
topology it is a topological space but it need not be a group.
2. The set {Hg | g ∈G} of all right cosets of H in G is the quotient set for the
equivalencerelation g1 ∼g2 ⇐⇒g1g−1
2
∈H.Whenendowedwiththequotient
topology it is a topological space but it need not be a group.
3. If H is normal in G, then left and right cosets coincide, as do the two quotient
sets above, which are then denoted by G/H. The quotient set G/H acquires a
group structure from G and with the quotient topology it is a topological group.
7.5
Uniformities
In the presence of a topology notions such as convergence and continuity become
available. However, a topology is too weak to speak of Cauchy sequences (and thus

7.5 Uniformities
263
of completeness) or of uniform continuity, notions that do exist in the presence
of a metric. However, there exists a structure, known as a uniformity, that is in
between a topology and a metric, that does allow one to speak of Cauchy sequences,
completeness, completions, and uniform continuity. Moreover, every topological
group is automatically endowed with two (often distinct) such uniformities.
We ﬁrst deﬁne the concept of uniformity in general and then proceed to describe
the canonical uniformities present in any topological group. As motivation, recall
that the axiomatization of a topology can be seen as the result of purifying a distance
function, eliminating any trace of details irrelevant for continuity. Similarly, the
axiomatization of a uniformity can be seen to arise from a similar puriﬁcation of a
distance function from anything irrelevant to uniform continuity.
Deﬁnition 7.7 Let X be a set. A non-empty collection E = {Ei}i∈I of relations
Ei ⊆X × X is said to be a uniform structure or a uniformity on X if the following
conditions hold (where we write x ∼E y to indicate that (x, y) ∈E).
1. x ∼E x for all E ∈E and x ∈X.
2. For all E ∈E there exists an F ∈E such that x ∼F y implies y ∼E x.
3. For all E ∈E there exists an F ∈E such that x ∼F y and y ∼F z together imply
that x ∼E y.
4. If E, F ∈E, then so is E ∩F.
5. If E ⊆F ⊆X × X and E ∈E, then F ∈E.
The pair (X, E) is called a uniform space and the members of E are its entourages. If
context clariﬁes any ambiguity it is common to refer to a uniform space X, leaving
the collection E of entourages implicit.
Example 7.5 Given a metric space (X, d), a uniformity on the set X is induced by
the distance function as follows. For every ε > 0 consider the set
Eε = {(x, y) ∈X × X | d(x, y) < ε}.
It then follows that the collection
E = {E ⊆X × X | ∃ε > 0 E ⊇Eε}
is a uniformity. The veriﬁcation of the axioms is straightforward. For instance, con-
dition 3 follows from the triangle inequality: given E ⊇Eε, let F = Eε/2, then
if x ∼F y and y ∼F z, namely d(x, y), d(y, z) < ε/2, then d(x, z) < ε, so that
x ∼E z. The resulting uniformity is called the induced uniformity.
Deﬁnition 7.8 A function f : X →Y between uniform spaces is said to be uni-
formly continuous if f −1(E) is an entourage in X for every entourage E in Y (here
f −1(E) stands for {(x, x′) ∈X × X | f (x) ∼E f (x′)}).
Topology captures the notion of continuity in the sense that a function f : X →
Y between metric spaces is continuous in the metric sense if, and only if, f is

264
7
Topological Groups
continuous with respect to the induced topologies. We establish the analogous result
for uniformities and uniformly continuous functions.
Theorem 7.9 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is uniformly continuous
inthemetricsenseif,andonlyif, f isuniformlycontinuouswithrespecttotheinduced
uniformities.
Proof Suppose that f is uniformly continuous in the sense that for every entourage
F in Y, f −1(F) is an entourage in X. Given ε > 0 consider the entourage
Fε = {(y, y′) ∈Y × Y | d(y, y′) < ε}.
By deﬁnition of the induced uniformity f −1(Fε) contains an entourage of the form
Eδ = {(x, x′) ∈X × X | d(x, x′) < δ}, for some δ > 0. In particular, if d(x, x′) <
δ, then (x, x′) ∈Eδ and thus ( f (x), f (x′)) ∈Fε, namely d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε. In
other words, f is metrically uniformly continuous.
In the other direction, suppose that f is uniformly continuous in the sense that for
all ε > 0 there exists a corresponding δ > 0 such that d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε provided
that d(x, x′) < δ. To show that f is uniformly continuous with respect to the induced
uniformities, let F be an entourage in Y, namely there exists an ε > 0 such that
F ⊇Fε where
Fε = {(y, y′) ∈Y × Y | d(y, y′) < ε}.
With δ > 0 corresponding to ε, we claim that f −1(F) ⊇Eδ, where
Eδ = {(x, x′) ∈X × X | d(x, x′) < δ}.
Indeed, if (x, x′) ∈Eδ, then d(x, x′) < δ and thus d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε. It follows
that (x, x′) ∈f −1(Fε) and thus Eδ ⊆f −1(Fε) ⊆f −1(F). This shows that f −1(E)
contains an entourage in X, and thus is itself an entourage, which is what we needed
to show.
⊓⊔
Clearly, the distance function cannot be reconstructed from the induced uniformity.
It is a simple matter to ﬁnd different metrics that induce the same uniformity (for
instance, by scaling all distances by a positive constant). A uniform space (X, E)
whose uniform structure E is the induced uniformity for some distance function d
on X is said to be a metrizable uniform space. Thus, so far, we established that
the concept uniform space is weaker than that of metric space, and that it correctly
captures the notion of uniformly continuous functions. Next, we show that every
uniform space induces a topology.
Theorem 7.10 Let (X, E) be a uniform space. The collection τ of sets U ⊆X such
that for all x ∈U there exists an entourage E ∈E such that {y ∈X | x ∼E y} ⊆U
is a topology on X called the induced topology.
Proof The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.
⊓⊔

7.5 Uniformities
265
The passage from a distance function to the induced uniformity loses information
and is thus not a reversible process. Similarly the passage from a uniformity to the
induced topology is not reversible. A topological space (X, τ) whose topology τ is
the induced topology for some uniformity on X is called a uniformizable topological
space.
We are now ready to describe the two uniformities present on any topological
group.Recallthateveryelementa ∈G givesrisetoalefttranslationmap g →ag and
to a right translation map g →ga, both homeomorphisms. We extend the translation
mappings so that they operate on subsets S ⊆G, i.e., we deﬁne aS = {as | s ∈S},
and similarly Sa = {sa | s ∈S}.
Theorem 7.11 Let G be a topological group and B a local basis at e. For every
open set U ∈B let RU = {(x, y) ∈X × X | xy−1 ∈U}. The collection
ER = {E ⊆X × X | ∃U ∈B E ⊇RU}
is a uniformity on X called the induced right uniformity. Similarly, for each U ∈B
let LU = {(x, y) ∈X × X | x−1y ∈U}. The collection
EL = {E ⊆X × X | ∃U ∈B E ⊇LU}
is a uniformity on X called the induced left uniformity.
Proof This is a routine veriﬁcation of the axioms of a uniform space.
⊓⊔
The following properties of the induced uniformities justify their names.
Theorem 7.12 Let G be a topological group and let EL and ER be the left and right
induced uniformities, respectively. Then
1. The induced topology by either EL or ER is the original topology on G.
2. Every left translation g →ag is uniformly continuous with respect to EL.
3. Every right translation g →ga is uniformly continuous with respect to ER.
Proof The proof is straightforward.
⊓⊔
Remark 7.4 We conclude this short account of topological groups with the fol-
lowing remark. A sequence {xm}m≥1 in a uniform space X is said to be a Cauchy
sequence if for every entourage E there exists an N ∈N such that xk ∼E xn for all
k, n > N. A uniform space X is said to be complete if every Cauchy sequence in X
converges (under the topology induced by the uniformity). The process of comple-
tion of a metric space (as given in Chap. 4 by means of Cauchy sequences) extends
to a completion process for every uniform space (however not by means of Cauchy
sequences, as they are too weak for general uniform spaces). Similarly, other uniform
concepts of metric spaces have analogous results valid for all uniform spaces.
The result above shows that the topology of a topological group is always uni-
formizable (and the uniformity can be chosen to further be compatible with all right

266
7
Topological Groups
or all left translations). Thus, in a sense, the topology of topological groups is rather
tame, behaving more like metric spaces do than the more wild topological spaces
out there do.

Chapter 8
Hilbert Spaces
This chapter is different in style than the previous ones. Presumably, the reader
will soon venture off to consult books that delve much deeper into Hilbert space
territory. This chapter offers a glimpse of the shores. With the background knowledge
developed thus far each of the following sections concentrates on, roughly, a single
aspect of Hilbert space theory that is markedly different to the situation in Banach
space theory. This is done in the form of a discussion starting off with a consideration
of general interest, contemplation of the complexity of the situation in the realm of
Banach spaces, and culminating with tremendous improvement in Hilbert space
theory.
Before summarizing the contents of the following sections, here is a preliminary
discussion. A Banach space is a linear space together with a norm that induces a
complete metric space. In that case the geometry borne by the norm meshes very
well with the underlying algebra of the vectors. This was witnessed in the chapter
on Banach spaces. Since a normed space does not carry a notion of angles Banach
space theory, by necessity, is conﬁned to focus solely on angle-free geometry. Hilbert
space theory incorporates angles into the analysis.
Let us recall some facts from elementary geometry of the plane. By Pythago-
ras’ Theorem the length (i.e., the norm) of a vector x = (x1, x2) ∈R2 is given by

x2
1 + x2
2. Consider now two vectors x, y ∈R2. These vectors then determine a tri-
angle with side lengths ∥x∥, ∥y∥, and ∥x −y∥. Let θ be the internal triangle angle
formed by x and y. From elementary trigonometry, namely the law of cosines (a
generalization of Pythagoras’ Theorem), the lengths of the sides of the triangle and
the angle θ are related by the formula
∥x −y∥2 = ∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2 −2∥x∥∥y∥cos θ.
Using the above formula for the length of a vector, this equality becomes

which simpliﬁes to
x1y1 + x2y2 = ∥x∥∥y∥cos θ.
Recalling the standard inner product in R2, given by ⟨x, y⟩= x1y1 + x2y2, we obtain
⟨x, y⟩= ∥x∥∥y∥cos θ
and thus we have discovered the standard inner product and the Cauchy-Schwarz
Inequality in R2 by elementary geometry.
We thus see that with a sufﬁciently strong geometry (i.e., the presence of angles),
a notion of a norm gives rise to an inner product. Conversely, an inner product gives
rise to a norm by means of ∥x∥= √(x, x), and, via the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,
also gives rise to angles.
In light of this discussion a Hilbert space is essentially a Banach space fortiﬁed
with angles.
Deﬁnition 8.1 A Hilbert space is an inner product space that with the induced norm
is a Banach space.
Prominent examples are the sequence space ℓ2 and the function space L2
(Theorem 5.17). Indeed, among all the Banach spaces ℓp, 1 ≤p ≤∞, only ℓ2 is a
Hilbert space and similarly L2 is exceptional in its family.
Let us recall that a norm ∥−∥is induced by an inner product if, and only if, the
parallelogram identity
2

∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2
= ∥x + y∥2 + ∥x −y∥2
holds for all vectors x and y. In other words, a Banach space is a Hilbert space if,
and only if, the parallelogram identity (which only mentions the norm) is valid. This
chapter investigates some of this identity’s far-reaching implications.
Section 8.1 is concerned with the geometric aspect known as the closest point
property, chosen as a starting point due to its intuitive quality and pivotal role in
establishingtheresultsofthefollowingsections.Section8.2continueswiththestrong
geometric ﬂavor and utilizes the closest point property to establish the existence of
orthogonal complements. Section 8.3 is a brief view of bases, from Hamel, through
Schauder, to Hilbert. Section 8.4 presents classical Fourier series through the Hilbert
basis lens and Sect. 8.5 establishes the Riesz Representation Theorem. Each section
concludes with a brief pointer to a famous result directly related to the core of the
section, thus providing a somewhat richer historical context to the journey.

8.1 The Closest Point Property
271
8.1
The Closest Point Property
Recall the point-to-set distance
d(x, S) = inf{d(x, s) | s ∈S},
meaningful in any metric space X, that measures the distance from a point x to a
subset S ⊆X. Generally speaking there is no reason for the inﬁmum to be attained.
In other words, there need not be, for the given point x, any single point in S that
realizes the distance from x to S and if such a point exists it need not be unique.
For instance, in R with the Euclidean metric consider the point x = 0 and the open
interval S = (1, 2); then d(0, S) = 1 while d(0, s) > 1 for all s ∈S. If, instead,
one takes S = [−2, −1] ∪[1, 2], then d(0, S) = 1 and is realized at both s = 1 and
s = −1. From this discussion we distill the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 8.2 Let X be a metric space and S ⊆X a subset. Then S has the closest
point property if for all x ∈X there is a unique point s ∈S with
d(x, s) = d(x, S).
Further examples in Euclidean spaces of subsets that fail to have the closest point
property can easily be constructed, e.g., in Rn, by choosing S either not closed or not
convex (recall that a subset S in a linear space is convex if tx + (1 −t)y ∈S for all
x, y ∈S and 0 ≤t ≤1, i.e., when the line joining any two points in S is contained
in S). It turns out that closedness and convexity are precisely the obstructions to the
closest point property not just in Rn but in any Hilbert space. We will shortly show
how the completeness and the parallelogram law play crucial roles in the proof that
any non-empty closed and convex subset of a Hilbert space has the closest point
property.
First, though, we pause to demonstrate the necessity of the Hilbert structure; in
a Banach space a non-empty closed and convex subset need not satisfy the closest
point property. Consider R2 with the ℓ∞norm. Let x = 0 be the origin and S =
[1, 3] × [−1, 1] a square. Then d(0, S) = 1 and this distance is attained at each
point on the left side {1} × [−1, 1] of the square S. There are thus uncountably many
points in S realizing the distance.
More dramatic is the observation that in a Banach space the distance from x to S
need not be realized even by a single point. First, let F : B →R be a bounded linear
functional on a real Banach space B and consider the set S = {x ∈B | F(x) = 1}.
The set S is closed since it is the inverse image of the closed set {1} ⊆R under the
continuous function F. It is empty only if F is trivial (since F is homogenous) and
it is convex (since F is also additive). The point-to-set distance d(0, S) is then
inf
x∈S ∥x∥

Hilbert Spaces
which, we show, is precisely 1/∥F∥, where ∥F∥is the operator norm of F (we are
now assuming F ̸= 0). Indeed, given an arbitrary x ∈S, namely F(x) = 1, we have
1 = |F(x)| ≤∥F∥∥x∥and so
1/∥F∥≤inf
x∈S ∥x∥.
For the reverse inequality let ε > 0 be given. By the deﬁnition of the operator norm
there exists y ∈B with |F(y)| > (∥F∥−ε)∥y∥. If such a y can be found in S, then
we are done. But that is easily arranged by considering (1/F(y))y.
We thus see that the distance from 0 to F−1(1) computes the reciprocal of the
operator norm of F. If that distance is attained, say at x ∈S, then we have
1/∥F∥= ∥x∥
and
F(x) = 1
and then for y = ∥F∥x we obtain
∥y∥= 1
and
F(y) = ∥F∥· F(x) = ∥F∥
so the norm of F is attained at y. All that is left now is to recall that not all bounded lin-
ear functionals on a Banach space (of inﬁnite dimension) attain their norms. For any
such non-trivial bounded linear functional F the point-to-set distance d(0, S) to the
non-empty, closed, and convex set S = F−1(1) is not attained. Bounded functionals
that fail to attain their norm arise naturally (see Exercise 6.31).
Now that we have established the appropriate depth of the situation we return to
the main question. Let S ⊆H be an arbitrary non-empty, closed, and convex subset
in a Hilbert space H and x ∈H a point. Before showing the existence of a point
s ∈S realizing the distance d(x, S) we remark that its uniqueness follows easily, and
without recourse to the completeness of the space. Indeed, suppose that two distinct
points s, t ∈S realize the distance d(x, S). The points x, s, t are then the vertices of
a triangle with equal side lengths d(x, s) = d(x, t) = α. The point w = 1/2(s + t)
lies in S (by convexity) and so d(x, w) ≥d(x, S) = α. To summarize, we have
an isosceles triangle in which the side length is no greater than the height. Let us
formalize this situation in an arbitrary inner product space and obtain a contradiction.
Let the sides of the triangle be given by vectors a, b. The assumptions are then that
a ̸= b and ∥a∥= ∥b∥= α while ∥1/2(a + b)∥≥α. Applying the parallelogram
law yields
2(∥a∥2 + ∥b∥2) = ∥a + b∥2 + ∥a −b∥2
and the left-hand side is simply 4α2. Using the inequality
∥a + b∥2 = 4∥1/2(a + b)∥2 ≥4α2
we see that ∥a −b∥2 ≤0, forcing a = b and thus a contradiction.

8.1 The Closest Point Property
273
Having seen that the distance d(x, S) is realized at no more than one point it
remains to establish the existence of a point s ∈S with d(x, S) = d(x, s). The strat-
egy is to obtain the desired point s as the limit of a sequence that approximates the
distance d(x, S). Indeed, suppose that {sn}n≥1 is a sequence in S with
lim
n→∞d(x, sn) = d(x, S)
and further that
lim
n→∞sn = s
where the convergence is in H. Since the distance function is continuous (even
uniformly so) it follows that
d(x, S) = lim
n→∞d(x, sn) = d(x, lim
n→∞sn) = d(x, s)
showing that the distance is attained at s. It remains to argue that s ∈S, but S is
closed and s is the limit of a sequence in it.
To ﬁnish the proof we must show the existence of a convergent sequence with
lim
n→∞d(x, sn) = d(x, S).
The strategy is clear: by deﬁnition of d(x, S) one can choose points in S with d(x, s)
lying arbitrarily close to d(x, S). If chosen to form a Cauchy sequence, then com-
pleteness of H would guarantee the convergence of the sequence. The parallelogram
law will tell us how to choose sn so as to fulﬁl the Cauchy condition. Let us look
at two points u, v ∈S. The idea is that if u and v are close to realizing the distance
d(x, S), then they must be close to each other. We thus apply the parallelogram law
to the vectors x −u and x −v:
∥(x −u) + (x −v)∥2 + ∥(x −u) −(x −v)∥2 = 2

∥x −u∥2 + ∥x −v∥2
giving us
∥u −v∥2 = 2

∥x −u∥2 + ∥x −v∥2

Noting that 1/2(u + v) ∈S by convexity we conclude that
∥u −v∥2 ≤2

∥x −u∥2 + ∥x −v∥2
−4d(x, S).

We now see how to arrange for the Cauchy condition, e.g., choose sn ∈S (remember
that S ̸= ∅) to satisfy
d(x, sn)2 < d(x, S)2 + 1
n
for all n ≥1. For such a choice for the sequence {sn}n≥1 we clearly have
lim
n→∞d(x, sn) = d(x, S)
and
d(sn, sm)2 = ∥sn −sm∥2 < 4d(x, S)2 + 2

and thus {sn}n≥1 is a Cauchy sequence.
We summarize the discussion with the statement of what we achieved.
Theorem 8.1 In a Hilbert space H any non-empty closed and convex subset S ⊆H
has the closest point property.
In a Hilbert space the closest point property settles the discussion. In a Banach
space the set of closest points can range from empty to inﬁnitely large. The study of
its geometric properties is of much interest. We shall only mention here a theorem
essentially due to Robert Clarke James from 1964 to the effect that in a Banach space
B the condition that every non-empty closed and convex subset admits at least one
closest point is equivalent to the reﬂexivity (Deﬁnition 6.8) of B.
8.2
Orthogonal Complements
A linear subspace V can be a large place (particularly if it is inﬁnite dimensional).
Divide and conquer is a powerful paradigm whose incarnation in this context is
the decomposition of V as the direct sum of two complementary subspaces. Recall
that U, W, two subspaces of V , are complementary if every x ∈V can be written
uniquely as
x = u + w
with u ∈U and w ∈W, in which case we write
V = U ⊕W.
For instance, the familiar decomposition of a function f as
f (x) = f (x) + f (−x)
2
+ f (x) −f (−x)

can (with some veriﬁcation) be phrased as
C(I, R) = Ce(I, R) ⊕Co(I, R)
expressing the Banach space of continuous functions on an interval I = [−a, a] as
the direct sum of its subspaces of even and odd functions, respectively. A simple
observation makes this statements stronger: each of these subspaces is closed in the
topology of the ambient space induced by the L∞norm and thus the Banach space
is decomposed as the direct sum of two complementary Banach spaces. This is a
most desirable situation. After all, if only one, or none, of the two subspaces was
Banach, then the divide and conquer method would force us out of the convenience
of Banach space theory.
It is often the case that the ambient space of interest is rather complicated and one
is not fortunate enough to easily recognize a representation of the space as the direct
sum of two convenient subspaces in it. Instead, one singles out just one convenient
subspace U ⊆B of a Banach space B and the need to identify a complementary
subspace W of it must be resolved. Therefore, a pertinent question arises: given a
closed subspace U in a Banach space B is there a closed subspace W complementary
to U?
En route to an answer let us ﬁrst observe that if B is ﬁnite dimensional, then the
answer is afﬁrmative. Indeed, it is commonplace to use a basis argument in order to
show that any subspace of a ﬁnite-dimensional linear space admits a complementary
subspace (and almost always inﬁnitely many such subspaces). Since in ﬁnite dimen-
sions all subspaces are closed, the issue is resolved. The basis argument essentially
still applies in inﬁnite dimensions. Let us outline how. We ﬁx a Banach space B
and a subspace U. Let S be the set of all subspaces W ⊆B with the property that
U ∩W = {0} (equivalently, so that no x ∈V decomposes in more than one way as
a sum x = u + w with u ∈U, w ∈W). Ordering S by inclusion yields a poset that
is non-empty (justify!) and satisﬁes the condition of Zorn’s Lemma. There is thus a
maximal subspace W ∈S and it can be shown to necessarily complement U.
An immediate issue with this result is its reliance on Zorn’s Lemma; it is not
computationally tractable and so cannot be used to divide and conquer in a practical
situation. In some sense, through the use of the Axiom of Choice we have lost control
over the resulting complementary subspace. But matters are even more severe. If
our initial choice of the subspace U in B is closed there is no guarantee that the
complementary subspace produced by Zorn’s Lemma is closed. Worse still, the
space c0 is a closed subspace of the Banach space ℓ∞of bounded sequences with
the ℓ∞norm yet none of the inﬁnitely many complementary subspaces of c0 in ℓ∞
is closed. An accessible proof of this fact is given in [3].
Let us now focus on the situation in a Hilbert space H, assuming a closed subspace
M ⊆H is given. We seek a closed complementary subspace N, namely to write a
vector x ∈H as a sum x = y + z with y ∈M and z ∈N. There is a natural candidate
for the point y ∈M: the closest point to x. A unique y ∈M with d(x, M) = d(x, y)
exists by the closest point property in H (from the previous section) noting that M
is non-empty (since 0 ∈M), convex (since it is a linear subspace) and closed (by

276
8
Hilbert Spaces
assumption). We are thus well under way: x = y + z where y ∈M is the unique
point satisfying d(x, M) = d(x, y), and z = x −y.
Intuitively, the linear subspace M in H is a ﬂat portion of the ambient space. The
shortest distance from x to M should be realized by dropping a perpendicular from
x to M. In other words, we expect the vector z = x −y to be orthogonal to every
vector in M. We thus deﬁne
M⊥=

m∈M
m⊥
where m⊥= {w ∈H | ⟨w, m⟩= 0}, the set of all vectors perpendicular to m. Each
m⊥is easily seen to be a linear subspace and so M⊥, as the intersection of linear
subspaces is itself a linear subspace. Moreover, since m⊥is the inverse image of
the closed set {0} under the continuous function w →⟨w, m⟩to the ground ﬁeld it
follows that m⊥is closed. Thus, as the intersection of closed subsets, the space M⊥
is closed. By our geometric intuition we expect that z ∈M⊥. If that is the case, then
N = M⊥would indeed be a closed subspace complementing M: the decomposition
x = y + z is already given and the fact that M ∩M⊥= {0} is immediate from the
general fact that ⟨w, w⟩= 0 ⇐⇒w = 0.
It remains to show that z = x −y belongs to M⊥. We note that z satisﬁes
∥z∥≤∥z −m∥
for all m ∈M since
∥z∥= ∥x −y∥= d(x, M)
while the fact that y + m ∈M tells us that
∥z −m∥= ∥x −(y + m)∥≥d(x, M).
The argument will be completed by showing that this property of z implies that
z ∈M⊥(incidentally, the converse is true as well and completeness is never used).
So, ﬁx m ∈M, which we may assume to be non-zero. We work in the real case. By
assumption ∥z∥2 ≤∥z −αm∥2 for all scalars α and after expansion and immediate
algebra we get
|⟨z, m⟩| ≤|α|
2 ∥m∥2
and allowing α to tend to 0 shows ⟨z, m⟩= 0. The complex case is handled by
multiplying α by a suitable complex number of modulus 1.
We summarize the above as the following theorem.
Theorem 8.2 In a Hilbert space any closed subspace M has its orthogonal com-
plement N = M⊥as a closed complementary subspace.
As noted above, the Banach space ℓ∞does not have this property. It is a deep and
celebrated result of Yoram Lindenstrauss and Lior Tzafriri from 1971 that a Banach

space in which every closed subspace admits a closed complementary subspace is in
fact a Hilbert space, provided one is allowed to lightly tweak the norm in a way that
does not affect the topology.
8.3
Bases: Hamel, Schauder, and Hilbert
In a ﬁnite-dimensional linear space V a choice of a basis endows the space with a
notion of coordinates. If the basis vectors are u1, . . . , un, then each vector x can be
written uniquely as
x =
n
	
i=1
αiui
and we may treat the coefﬁcients α1, . . . , an, in this order, as the the coordinates of
x in the given basis. For concreteness, let us assume the ground ﬁeld is C. What we
have then is a process V →Cn. Let us now consider arbitrary n vectors u1, . . . , un in
V and attempt to use them for the purpose of obtaining coordinates. This is a simple
matter: if a = (α1, . . . , αn) is a vector in Cn, then let
ψ(a) =
n
	
i=1
αiui
thus deﬁning a function ψ : Cn →V . Clearly, ψ is a linear operator where Cn is
given the usual linear space structure.
When the vectors u1, . . . , un are thought of as a speciﬁcation of directions in the
space V the requirements for them to form a basis are the following. The directions
may not be redundant, i.e., they are linearly independent. This is equivalent to the
injectivity of ψ. The directions must also provide sufﬁcient coverage to reach any
vector, i.e., they are spanning. This is equivalent to the surjectivity of ψ. Thus,
the vectors u1, . . . , un are a basis if, and only if, ψ is a bijection and so V ∼= Cn.
Obviously, a different choice of basis produces a different coordinates function ψ.
Therefore, a desire to conclude that V and Cn should, or even can, be identiﬁed
should immediately be scrutinized. An identiﬁcation of this sort depends on ψ –
of which there are many. Carelessly identifying V with Cn throws away the vital
information present in the function ψ.
Let us thus remain precise and appreciate the utility of the coordinates function
ψ : Cn →V and its dependency on the basis. An important aspect of ψ is its com-
putability. After all, in practical situations one naturally constructs the linear space
V , decides on some basis in it, and then wishes to ﬁnd, for a vector x ∈V , its
coordinates. This amounts to solving the inverse problem
ψ(a) = x

278
8
Hilbert Spaces
for the associated coordinates function ψ : Cn →V . Typically, such inverse prob-
lems are hard to solve but the linearity of ψ and ﬁnite dimensionality lead to efﬁcient
algorithms for doing just that (this sentence summarizes quite a bit of elementary
linear algebra).
When we turn to inﬁnite dimensions not only is the tractability of ψ compro-
mized but Hamel bases, the inﬁnite-dimensional algebraic analogues of bases in
ﬁnite dimensions, can rarely be exhibited. And if a basis cannot be written down
there is certainly no hope of computing coordinates according to it. For this rea-
son Hamel bases are of very limited use in Banach space theory. For instance, in
the Banach space ℓ∞the linear subspace c00 of the eventually 0 sequences is an
inﬁnite-dimensional linear space with a Hamel basis given by the standard vectors
en. However, c00, with the ℓ∞norm, is not a Banach space as it is not closed in ℓ∞.
Its closure in ℓ∞is the Banach space c0, the space of sequences converging to 0. In
a sense, c0 is the simplest non-trivial example of a Banach space, obtained from the
very manageable space c00, yet already here exhibiting a Hamel basis is hopeless.
Algebraically this is a pessimistic state of affairs. Computationally, our preference
is to work with ﬁnite lists of numbers. Inductively approximating would allow us to
even work with countable lists of numbers, but we cannot move beyond the countable.
Applications drive us to inﬁnite-dimensional spaces. To tame those and get a useful
theory completeness is highly desirable. But then Exercise 6.1 shows the inevitable
problem: as soon as a Banach space is inﬁnite dimensional no countable Hamel basis
exists. So, for precisely the linear spaces of interest the jump from ﬁnite to inﬁnite
dimensions skips over the countable option.
To the rescue comes the presence of a topology in a Banach space. Suppose that
we have a sequence {un}n≥1 of vectors in a Banach space B. These vectors form a
Schauder basis of B if for every x ∈B there exists a unique sequence a = {ai}i≥1
of complex numbers with
x =
∞
	
i=1
αiui
in the sense that
lim
n→0 ∥x −
n
	
i=1
αiui∥= 0.
For example, it is rather straightforward that in each of the Banach spaces c0 and ℓp,
1 ≤p < ∞, the sequence {en}n≥1 is a Schauder basis. Now, given a Schauder basis
in B let C be the set of all sequences {αi}i≥1 as above for which the series converges.
Due to the delicate issue of convergence in B this set can be hard to understand.
Regardless, a function ψ : C →B can then be deﬁned by
ψ(a) =
∞
	
i=1
αiui

8.3 Bases: Hamel, Schauder, and Hilbert
279
and so we are in a similar situation to the ﬁnite-dimensional one: given a vector x
we seek to solve ψ(a) = x to ﬁnd the coordinates of x. We would also like to retain
some of the computational tractability of this inverse problem. In general Banach
spaces this is still very challenging even if a relatively simple Schauder basis is given.
Before making the ﬁnal step toward an effective notion of basis let us note that the
existence of a Schauder basis is not guaranteed. Indeed, if one exists, then B must be
separable. This is no surprise; a Schauder basis is a countable set that topologically
generates the entire space so it is expected that the entire space is topologically not
too big. For a proof suppose {un}n≥1 is a Schauder basis. Note ﬁrst that the set of all
ﬁnite linear combinations of these vectors is dense in B since it contains all partial
sums of all series that sufﬁce to generate B. This set though is not countable but
restricting to its subset in which the coefﬁcients have rational real and imaginary
parts is countable. It is still dense since Q is dense in R.
In a ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V orthonormal bases u1, . . . , un are
phenomenally pleasant to work with. In this case solving the inverse problem ψ(a) =
x for any given x ∈V trivializes: the coefﬁcients are given by the inner product
αi = ⟨ui, x⟩. We thus consider a Hilbert space H together with an orthonormal
sequence {ui}i≥1 of vectors in it, namely the vectors are pair-wise orthogonal and
each is of norm 1: ⟨ui, u j⟩= δi, j, the Kronecker delta. We seek to use these vectors
to obtain coordinates for all vectors x ∈H.

which together with the assumed convergence of

implies that {xn}n ≥1 is Cauchy and thus converges, and this is precisely the con-
vergence we are after. So, starkly differently than the case with a Schauder basis,
ℓ2 precisely parametrizes all possible coordinates once an orthonormal sequence is
chosen. We may thus deﬁne the coordinates function
ψ : ℓ2 →H
analogously to the ﬁnite-dimensional case. On top of being a linear operator the
function ψ, as we just computed, preserves norms, i.e., ∥ψ(a)∥= ∥a∥2. But more is
true. The function ψ respects the inner products; the given one on B and the standard
one on ℓ2. In more detail,
⟨ψ(a), ψ(b)⟩= ⟨a, b⟩
for all a, b ∈ℓ2. This is shown by a computation very similar to the one above where
instead of the continuity of the norm one uses the continuity of the inner product.

8.3 Bases: Hamel, Schauder, and Hilbert
281
Ideally, we would like ψ to be bijective and since it is an isometry, and thus
injective, the only obstruction is surjectivity. In other words, we would like each and
every vector x ∈H to have coordinates a ∈ℓ2, namely to be able to solve ψ(a) = x.
When this is the case we say that {ui}i≥1 is a Hilbert basis. If ψ fails to be surjective,
then it is because {ui}i≥1 consists of too few vectors; not enough to provide sufﬁcient
coverage to reach all vectors in H. Intuitively, if that happens, we would simply add
another orthogonal vector to the list, make sure it is normalized, and thus increase
the coverage. In this manner we can improve the sequence forever and, hopefully,
end up with a Hilbert basis. The problem is that if H is very large the sequence may
become so long that it is no longer countable. Let us look into that matter.
We say that a set S ⊆H is an orthonormal system if ⟨s, t⟩= δs,t for all s, t ∈S.
Using Zorn’s Lemma we show that H contains a maximal complete orthonormal
system. The setup is standard: let A be the set of all orthonormal systems in H
ordered by inclusion. It is clear that A is non-empty and that every chain in it has an
upper bound given by its union. There is thus a maximal orthonormal system Smax
in H. Without further conditions Smax may not be countable. But, if H is separable,
then Smax must be countable by Proposition 5.4. This is so since for all x, y ∈Smax
one has by Pythagoras’ Theorem that ∥x −y∥=
√
2 and so Smax is a net in H.
We now know that a separable Hilbert space has a countable maximal orthonormal
system Smax andproceedtoshowthatitisaHilbertbasis.Enumerating Smax arbitrarily
we have Smax = {e1, e2, . . . } without repetition. Fixing x ∈H we must show that
x =
∞
	
i=1
αiei
for suitable coordinates. Firstly, we discover what these coordinates must be; assum-
ing the equality, we would obtain through a continuity argument that for any
1 ≤j < ∞
⟨e j, x⟩= ⟨e j, lim
n→∞
n
	
i=1
αiei⟩= lim
n→∞⟨e j, αiei⟩= α j
so in other words we must show
x =
∞
	
i=1
⟨ei, x⟩ei.
Let us for the moment assume that the series converges and write ˆx for its sum.
Our goal is to show that x = ˆx. If that was not the case, then for y = x −ˆx another
simple limit argument shows that ⟨ei, y⟩= 0, namely y is orthogonal to Smax and
thus also orthogonal to its linear span and consequently orthogonal to its closure
M = span(Smax). In other words, we may write H = M ⊕M⊥where M is the
closure of the span of the maximal orthonormal system Smax and y ∈M⊥. But then

282
8
Hilbert Spaces
if y ̸= 0, then Smax ∪{y/∥y∥} would be an orthonormal system strictly larger than
Smax. This impossibility forces y = 0 and so x = ˆx.
It remains to see that the series giving rise to ˆx converges. We have seen that
for such a series convergence is equivalent to the coefﬁcients belonging to ℓ2. The
coefﬁcients in our case do belong to ℓ2 as a result of Bessel’s Inequality
∞

|⟨ei, x⟩|2 ≤∥x∥2
that we now prove. Let
yn =
n
	
i=1
⟨ei, x⟩ei
and note that x −yn is orthogonal to e1, . . . , en and thus to yn. Therefore,
∥x∥2 = ∥(x −yn) + yn∥2 = ∥x −yn∥2 + ∥yn∥2 ≥∥yn∥2 =
n
	
i=1
|⟨ei, x⟩|2
and the desired inequality follows by allowing n to tend to inﬁnity.
The gist of the discussion can be summarized as follows.
Theorem 8.3 A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a Hilbert space to have a
Hilbert basis is its separability.
The situation for Banach spaces is more delicate. The basis problem, posed by
Stefan Banach, asks whether the necessary condition of separability is also sufﬁcient
for the existence of a Schauder basis in a Banach space. In 1973 Per Enﬂo provided
a negative answer.
8.4
Fourier Series
The separable Hilbert space ℓ2 is of fundamental importance. As the previous section
shows, if H is any separable Hilbert space, then ℓ2 can be used to provide coordinates
ψ : ℓ2 →H for all vectors in H. Consequently, the space of square summable
sequences, as humble as it may sound, implicitly contains the intricacies of any
other separable Hilbert space, including, by Theorem 5.20, L2 – the seemingly much
more complicated space of square integrable functions.
In this section all functions are of the form x : [−π, π] →C. In particular, we
write L2 = L2([−π, π], C). Let us witness a ﬁrst stark difference between ℓ2 and L2.
Among the simplest members one ﬁnds in ℓ2 is the harmonic sequence s with sn =
1/n. Establishing that s ∈ℓ2 is easily done by the integral test for the convergence
of  1/n2. In L2 we ﬁnd the function x(t) = t whose membership in L2 is trivial:
t →t2 is continuous and thus integrable on [−π, π]. Now,

we ﬁnd ourselves with a lack of exact tools. These two examples are typical. For a
large class of functions x ∈L2, e.g., all polynomials x, computing the norm ∥x∥2 is
a simple matter of integration. By contrast, computing the norm of sequences in ℓ2
directly is possible primarily for carefully designed sequences (that often feature as
exercises when ﬁrst encountering the theory of series).
The space ℓ2, in a sense, is simpler than L2. At the very least it is considerably
easier to deﬁne. Nonetheless, we have just witnessed an aspect in which L2 is simpler
than ℓ2 when it comes to computation. Let us thus make precise the intuitive sense
in which ℓ2 is simpler than L2: it is trivial to exhibit a Hilbert basis (i.e., a complete
orthonormal sequence) in ℓ2. A moment’s thought is all that is required to verify that
the collection {en}n≥1 of standard vectors in ℓ2 is a Hilbert basis. A second pensive
moment should convince the reader that the ease of deﬁning ℓ2 is inseparably and
intimately linked to the ease of presentation of a Hilbert basis.
The main theorem of the previous section tells us that ℓ2 and L2 are abstractly the
same Hilbert space. This should make us hopeful of the possibility of exploiting the
ease of presentation of ℓ2 with the computational tools present in L2. In particular,
if ψ : ℓ2 →L2 is an isomorphism, preserving the inner product, and thus norms,
then ψ would serve as a bridge between the two formalisms. For this to be of any
computational use it ought to be that ψ is explicit. And for that we must obtain an
explicit description of a Hilbert basis in L2.

that is immaterial since the two indexing sets are of the same cardinality so we

theorem that was invoked in Theorem 5.16) that these functions span a dense subset
of L2, implying they form a Hilbert basis.

For all vectors a = (. . . , a−n, . . . , a−1, a0, a1, . . . , an . . . ) ∈ℓ2. Finding the coordi-

as computing the inner product in L2: the coefﬁcient of en is ⟨en, x⟩. In other words,

Hilbert Spaces
We have successfully computed the ℓ2 norm of the harmonic sequence.
The quality of the convergence of the Fourier series of x to x is as subtle as it is
important. The convergence in the L2 norm is a rather weak form of convergence, yet,
as we saw, it is strong enough to yield interesting non-trivial results. However, point-
wise convergence is the holy grail and it is desirable to know, at least in theory, when it
can be reached. The extent to which the Fourier series of an L2 function x converges
to x point-wisely intrigued mathematicians from Fourier himself to the giants of
20th century analysis. For well-behaved functions, for instance if x is continuously
differentiable, point-wise convergence is guaranteed at all points. Hopes, at the dawn
of the 20th century, that such was the case for all continuous functions were proven to
be too optimistic and in 1915 Luzin’s Conjecture stated that point-wise convergence
for a continuous function was guaranteed with the exception of a negligible set of
points (in the measure-theoretic sense, i.e., of measure 0). In 1966 the conjecture was
proved true by Lennart Carleson. The proof, despite several simpliﬁcations, is quite
involved. The situation gets even more involved when considering the Fourier series
for x ∈L p with p ̸= 2. The extension of Carleson’s Theorem to the case p > 1
was stated in his original 1966 article and proved rigorously by Richard Hunt in
1968. The situation for L1 functions was known already several decades earlier to
be beyond hope: there exist continuous such functions whose Fourier series diverge
everywhere.

The Riesz Representation Theorem
The dual space B∗of a Banach space B, consisting of all bounded linear functionals
B →K to the ground ﬁeld, is an object of great interest. Important constructs are
members of the dual space, e.g., taking the limit of a sequence is a function lim: c →
K. This function is linear and bounded, so lim ∈c∗. The summation operation is
a function σ∞: ℓ1 →K which is linear and bounded, so σ∞∈(ℓ1)∗. Similarly,
integration is linear and bounded so

∈(L1([a, b], K))∗. For a general Banach
space B it may be difﬁcult to exhibit even a single non-trivial element in the dual
space, attesting, in a sense, to the complexity of B. The Hahn-Banach Theorem
guarantees the existence of sufﬁciently many such elements, at least to separate the
points of B. In some cases the dual space can be identiﬁed up to a linear isometry,
e.g., for all 1 ≤p < ∞
ℓ∗
p ∼= ℓq and L∗
p ∼= Lq
where q satisﬁes 1/p + 1/q = 1. Among these we see that ℓ2 and L2 are self-dual.
These are also the only Hilbert spaces in their family. This is no coincidence.
In a Hilbert space H there is an abundance of explicit bounded linear functionals.
For arbitrary x ∈H the function Fx : H →K given by
Fx(y) = ⟨x, y⟩

8.5 The Riesz Representation Theorem
287
is a linear operator (since by deﬁnition the inner product is linear in its second
argument). Let us compute its norm ∥Fx∥. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
|Fx(y))| = |⟨x, y⟩| ≤∥x∥∥y∥
and thus ∥Fx∥≤∥x∥. Taking x = y shows that ∥Fx∥= ∥x∥and in particular the
norm is attained.
What we now have is a function 	 : X →X∗given by 	(x) = Fx, or, directly
in terms of the inner product, 	(x)(y) = ⟨x, y⟩. Moreover, ∥	(x)∥= ∥x∥, i.e., 	
preserves the norms and thus is an isometry. Note that 	 also preserves much of the
linear structure (but is not quite homogenous if K = C) but we shall concentrate just
on its metric aspects. What we have so far is an isometric embedding (injectivity
follows from norm preservation) of H in its dual H∗. We are about to establish that
	 is surjective. In other words, we shall show that any bounded linear functional
F ∈H∗is of the form Fx for (a necessarily unique) x ∈H.
Let us ﬁx a bounded linear functional F : H →K. Let us assume F = Fx and
see what we can extract about x. Let M = Ker(F) be the kernel of F, i.e., y ∈
M ⇐⇒F(y) = 0. But if F = Fx, then F(y) = 0 ⇐⇒⟨x, y⟩= 0, namely M =
x⊥. Therefore, the x we are after resides in M⊥, the orthogonal complement of
Ker(F). That narrows down the search space considerably and allows us to divide
and conquer according to Sect. 8.2. Indeed, we may write
H = M ⊕M⊥
since F is continuous and thus M = F−1({1}), as a continuous inverse image of a
closed set, is a closed subspace of H.
We still need to ﬁnd an appropriate x ∈M⊥so we should hope that space is not too
large. At this point note that if F = 0, then we may take x = 0 so we proceed under
the assumption that F ̸= 0. We then observe that dim(M⊥) = 1. To see that, ﬁrst note
that Theorem 2.11 and H = M ⊕M⊥imply H/M ∼= M⊥. Since we are assuming
F ̸= 0 it follows that F : H →K must be surjective and so Exercise 2.65 implies
that H/M ∼= K. Therefore, M⊥∼= H/M ∼= K, and thus has dimension equal to 1.
Therefore, we may choose a vector x ̸= 0 that spans M⊥.
We now know that every vector y ∈H can be written uniquely as y = m + tx
with m ∈M = Ker(F) and t ∈K. By computing we see that
F(y) = F(m) + t F(x) = t F(x)
while
Fx(y) = ⟨x, y⟩= ⟨x, m⟩+ t⟨x, x⟩= t∥x∥2
so the condition for equality is F(x) = ∥x∥2. Since the choice of x can safely be
altered up to a scalar multiple we can easily arrange to choose x so that F(x) = ∥x∥2,
and thus conclude that F = Fx.

Hilbert Spaces
The fact that in a Hilbert space every bounded linear functional F is uniquely of
the form Fx is known as the Riesz Representation Theorem proved by Frigyes Riesz
in 1909. The precise properties of 	 imply that a Hilbert space is congruent to its
dual. This theorem is behind the following slogan.
Theorem 8.4 Every Hilbert space H is self-dual.
In the course of the discussion we noted that the linear functionals of the form
Fx attain their norm. Since in a Hilbert space these functionals exhaust all of the
bounded ones it follows that in a Hilbert space every bounded linear functional
attains its norm. Another result of Robert Clarke James states that a Banach space
has this same property if, and only if, it is reﬂexive. He ﬁrst gave a proof in the
separable case in 1957 and in the general case in 1972.
Further Reading
Hopefully the material of this chapter had whet the appetite of the reader. There
are many introductory textbooks that go much further into Hilbert space theory. A
mathematically oriented one is [4] and it is also masterfully short without being
dense or imprecise. A very different book in style is the equally masterfully written
[1] spanning more than a handful of modern applications of Hilbert space theory
in great detail, sprawling over many hundreds of pages. Finally, we mention the
classical [2] written by one of the greatest expositors of mathematics.

9.11 (Separation properties) A topological space X is said to satisfy:
• the T0 separation axiom if for all distinct points x, y ∈X there exists an open set
U such that either x ∈U and y /∈U, or y ∈U and x /∈U;
• the T1 separation axiom if for all distinct points x, y ∈X there exist two open sets
U and V such that x ∈U and y /∈U, and y ∈V and x /∈V ;
• the T2 separation axiom if X satisﬁes the Hausdorff separations property, that is
for all distinct points x, y ∈X there exist two open sets U and V such that x ∈U,

Linear Spaces
9.1 Suppose that
αx + βy + γ z = 0
for some scalars α, β, γ ∈R. The equation is a functional equality, and thus for any
choice of t ∈R we have that
αx(t) + βy(t) + γ z(t) = 0.
However, by considering the values t = 0, t = π/2, t = π, we obtain the equations:
β + γ = 0, α + γ = 0, and −β + γ = 0, from which α = β = γ = 0 follows eas-
ily. Thus the only linear combination resulting in the constantly zero function is the
trivial combination, showing the desired linear independence. Now, as for x2, y2, and
z2, noting that x2(t) + y2(t) = 1 = z2(t), we see that x2 + y2 −z2 = 0, establishing
the desired linear dependence.
9.2 Given a set S of vectors in V , suppose ﬁrst that S is linearly independent. We
must show that every ﬁnite subset of it is linearly independent, thus let S f ⊆S be a

where α1, . . . , αm are scalars and x1, . . . , xm ∈S f . But then the exact same linear
combination is also a linear combination of elements from the linearly independent
set S, and thus all scalars must be 0. This shows S f is linearly independent. In the
other direction, suppose every ﬁnite subset of S is linearly independent. To show
that S is linearly independent suppose that 0 is obtained as a linear combination
(necessarily a ﬁnite one!) as above, with x1 . . . , xm ∈S. Consider then the ﬁnite set

{x1, . . . , xm} ⊆S
and we thus see that 0 is written as linear combination of elements from that subset,
which is linearly independent by assumption. Thus all scalars must be 0, and thus S
is linearly independent.
9.3 Consider R as a linear space over itself and let W be a non-trivial linear subspace
of R. Thus W contains some non-zero vector, namely a real number x ̸= 0. The
dimension of R over itself is clearly 1, and thus any non-zero vector spans all of R.
Since W, as a linear subspace, is its own span, we conclude that W = R. Thus, we
showed that other than the trivial subspace {0}, the only other subspace of R is R
itself, as required.
Now we consider R as a linear space over Q, and note that this is an inﬁnite
dimensional linear space. Let B be a Hamel basis for R over Q. For every subset X
of B consider the span of X, and denote it by WX. We claim that WX ̸= WY for all
subsets X, Y ⊆B with X ̸= Y. Indeed, suppose WX = WY and we may assume that
X is not a subspace of Y. Choose a vector x ∈X −Y. Since x ∈WX it follows that
x ∈WY. Thus
x =

is a non-trivial linear combination of vectors from the linearly independent set B,
an impossibility. To conclude then, for each subset of B we obtained a unique linear
subspace of R. There are thus inﬁnitely many subspaces, as required. In fact, the
cardinality of a Hamel basis in this case was shown to be equal to |R|, the cardinality
of the real numbers. We thus showed that R as a linear space over Q has at least |P(B)|
many linear subspaces, a cardinality known to be strictly larger than the cardinality
of B, and thus of R.

as claimed. In the other direction, suppose the condition on linear relations in X is
met. Given x ∈S, write
y =

αx · x
as a (ﬁnite!) linear combination of vectors from X. If
F(y) =

αx · f (x)
is well-deﬁned, then it clearly gives rise to the desired linear extension of f . So,
suppose that
y =

βx · x
is another expression of y as a linear combination of vectors from X. But then, by
subtracting the two expressions, we obtain
0 =

(αx −βx) · x
which is a linear relation in X. It thus follows that
0 =

(αx −βx) · f (x)
from which it follows that the formula for computing F(y) is independent of the
presentation of y as a linear combination of vectors from X, as desired.
As for the special case where X = B is a basis, note that the span of X is then
the entire ambient space V , and that the linear independence of B implies that there
are no linear relations in X, so the needed condition for the extension is vacuously
satisﬁed.
9.5 Suppose that T : V →W is an isomorphism and that B is a basis for V . We
will show that T (B) = {T (b) | b ∈B} is a basis for W. Given an arbitrary w ∈W,
consider T −1(w) ∈V . We may write T −1(w) as a linear combination
T −1(w) =

αb · b
and thus
w = T (T −1(w)) =

αb · T (b)
showing that T (B) spans W. Next, suppose a linear combination

and thus  αb · b ∈Ker(T) = {0} (since T is injective). It follows that

αb · b = 0
and therefore that all of the coefﬁcients are 0, as required.
9.6 Suppose V is an inﬁnite dimensional linear space and let B be a basis for V .
Choose a countable subset {y1, y2, . . .} ⊆B and let Wn be the span of {y1, . . . , yn}.

is a linear isomorphism identifying a copy of Rn inside V , as claimed.
As for the existence of a linear space U which contains an isomorphic copy of
every linear space over R, the fact that no such linear space exists is a consequence
of a set-theoretic result known as Cantor’s Theorem. Suppose that such a U does
exist. By constructing free linear spaces one sees that linear spaces of arbitrarily
large cardinality exist. That is, given any set X, no matter how large, there always
exists a linear space having X as a basis. Since U is assumed to contain a copy of
every linear space, it follows that X is in bijection with a subset of U. In other words,
there exists an injection X →U, and thus |X| ≤|U|, for all sets X.
In particular, for the set X = P(U) of all subsets of U one has that
|P(U)| ≤|U|.
However, the function u →{u} is clearly an injection U →P(U), and thus
|U| ≤|P(U)|.
We thus conclude, by the Cantor-Shröder-Bernstein Theorem (see Preliminaries if
needed), that
|U| = |P(U)|.
However, this is known to be impossible by an argument we now present.
Theorem 9.1 (Cantor’s Theorem) For all sets S there exists no surjective function
S →P(S). In particular |S| < |P(S)|.
Proof Suppose a surjective function f : S →P(S) exists. Consider then the set
S! = {s ∈S | s /∈f (s)}
which is clearly a subset of S, and thus S! ∈P(S). Since f is surjective, it follows
that there exists s! ∈S with f (s!) = S!. To obtain a contradiction let us consider

Solutions
301
whether s! ∈S! or not. If s! ∈S!, then s! /∈f (s!) = S!, which is absurd. However,
if s! /∈S! = f (s!), then s! fulﬁlls the condition for being an element in S!, and thus
s! ∈S!, again an absurdity. We must conclude that no such f exists.
Since no surjection from S to P(S) exists, no bijection exists either, and thus the
sets have different cardinalities. Since s →{s} is clearly an injection S →P(S) it
follows that |S| < |P(S)|.
⊓⊔
9.7 Let Eab be the 3 × 3 matrix whose entries are all 0 except for the (a, b) entry
being 1. Clearly, the set {Eab}a,b∈{1,2,3} spans M. We have to ﬁnd a basis composed
of rank 2 matrices. For a, b, c, d ∈{1, 2, 3}, deﬁne
Fa,b;c,d = Eab + Ecd
and
Ga,b;c,d = Eab −Ecd.
Note that, if a ̸= c and b ̸= d, then Fa,b;c,d and Ga,b;c,d have rank 2. Note also that
Eab = 1
2 Fa,b;c,d + 1
2Ga,b;c,d,
where we can choose a ̸= c and b ̸= d. The reader can now easily identify a set of
rank 2 matrices that span M.
9.8 We prove that dim(Pn) = n + 1 by showing that
{1, x, x2, . . . , xn}
is a basis. Clearly these vectors span Pn and the fact that they are linearly independent
follows easily from the more general argument given next, where the dimension of
P is computed.
We show that the dimension of P is countably inﬁnite by showing that
{1, x, x2, . . . , xn, . . .}
is a basis. It is obvious that these vectors span P. To see that they are linearly
independent suppose that a linear combination of the vectors results in the zero
vector. In other words, 0 = n
k=0 αkxk for some real numbers α0, . . . , αn. But this
linear combination is a polynomial and it is well-known that the only polynomial
that evaluates to 0 on all real numbers is the 0 polynomial. Thus all coefﬁcients must
be equal to 0, and therefore the only linear combination resulting in the zero vector
is the trivial linear combination.
9.9 We note ﬁrst the general fact that if A : U →V and B : V →W are invertible
functions, then (B ◦A)−1 = A−1 ◦B−1. This is nothing but the computation
B(A(A−1(B−1(w)))) = B(B−1(w)) = w
and similarly
A−1(B−1(B(A(u)))) = A−1(A(u)) = u

302
Solutions
for all w ∈W and all u ∈U. Now, going back to the linear operators A and B,
assumed to commute, we have
A−1B−1 = (B A)−1 = (AB)−1 = B−1A−1,
as required.
9.10 Assume ﬁrst that V is inﬁnite dimensional, and let B be an inﬁnite basis of V .
Fix a vector x0 ∈B and consider the set S = B −{x0}. As a subset of a basis these
vectors are linearly independent, and thus S is a basis of the subspace spanned by
S. Clearly, x0 is missing from that span (otherwise the original B would be linearly
dependent, which is impossible since it is a basis), and thus S is a proper subspace of
V . To show that S ∼= V it sufﬁces to show they have equal dimensions, namely that
|B| = |S|. Clearly, |S| ≤|B|, since the inclusion S →B is an injection. If we can
construct an injection in the other direction as well, then, using the Cantor-Shröder-
Bernstein Theorem, the cardinalities will indeed be shown to be equal. To construct
an injection f : B →S, let {xm}m≥1 be a countably inﬁnite list of distinct vectors in
S. Deﬁne now f (xm) = xm+1 for all m ≥1, with f (x0) = x1, and f (x) = x in all
other cases. It is immediate to verify that f is indeed an injection. This completes
the proof that if V is inﬁnite dimensional, then it is isomorphic to a proper subspace
of it.
In the other direction, suppose that V ∼= U for some proper subspace U. Since
linear spaces over the same ﬁeld are isomorphic if, and only if, their dimensions
are equal, it follows that dim(V ) = dim(U). But in a ﬁnite dimensional space, if a
subspace has the same dimension as the ambient space, then the subspace coincides
with the ambient space, and is thus not proper. We conclude that V must be inﬁnite
dimensional.
Topological Spaces
Remark 9.1 Intopologythetermneighborhood of apoint x inatopological space X
may mean one of two things. Either an open set U in X with x ∈U, or an arbitrary
subset N ⊆X which contains an open set U with x ∈U. The difference is only
cosmetic, and one can easily translate between the two situations. In the solutions
below we adhere to the ﬁrst meaning of neighborhood.
9.11 Any indiscrete space with more than one element very clearly does not satisfy the
T0 property. For an example of a space that is T0 but not T1 consider the Sierpinski
space S = {0, 1}. For a T1 space that is not T2, let S be an inﬁnite set endowed
with the coﬁnite topology. Clearly the T1 separation property is satisﬁed since given
distinct points x, y ∈S, the sets S −{x} and S −{y} are open and clearly satisfy the
requirements. We show that S is not T2. Indeed, let x, y be two distinct points in S
and suppose x ∈U and y∈V for some open sets U, V . Then the complements of U
and of V are ﬁnite subsets of S, and

Solutions
303
S −(U ∩V ) = (S −U) ∪(S −V )
is also ﬁnite. Since S is inﬁnite it follows that U ∩V ̸= ∅.
9.12 A locally (path) connected space that is not (path) connected is, for instance,
the space (0, 1) ∪(3, 4) as a subspace of R with the Euclidean topology (as is easy
to see). As for the comb space, we ﬁrst show that it is path connected, and thus also
connected. Indeed, any point admits a path to the point (0, 0) by ﬁrst traveling south
to meet the X-axis and then traveling west. Thus any two points can be joined by a
path in the space, so it is indeed path-connected. It is however not locally connected,
and thus not locally path-connected. Indeed, given any point of the form p = (0, y)
with 0 < y < 1, consider a small enough circle centered at p which does not intersect
the X-axis. Any open set containing p must contain a subset of this form, but such
a set is not connected.
9.13 Let X be a compact space. Given any x ∈X we may take U = C = X, and then
x ∈U ⊆X with U open and C compact, so X is locally compact. An example of
a locally compact space that is not compact is, e.g., R with the Euclidean topology.
Its non-compactness is obvious. As for it being locally compact, suppose x ∈R is
given. Then x ∈(x −1, x + 1) ⊆[x −1, x + 1], as required.
As an example of a space that is not locally compact, consider Q as a subspace
of R with the Euclidean topology. We will show that Q is not locally compact at any
point. This will be done by showing that in fact no non-empty compact subset of Q
contains a non-empty open set. To see that, suppose that U ⊆C where U is open
and C is compact, and both are non-empty. It follows that Q ∩(a, b) ⊆U for some
non-empty open interval (a, b). Since Q is Hausdorff, the compact set C is closed,
and thus, taking closures, we obtain that [a, b] ∩Q ⊆C. This is thus a closed subset
of a compact set in a Hausdorff space, and thus Q ∩[a, b] is compact. But that is
not the case. Indeed, let y ∈[a, b] be an irrational number and let {qn}n ∈N be a
strictly increasing sequence of rationals tending to y. Let Un = Q ∩(−∞, qn) and
consider also the set Q ∩(y, ∞). These are open sets in the subspace topology that
cover [a, b] but (as the reader may easily verify) they admit no ﬁnite subcovering.
9.14 We prove that X is closed. The condition

a2 + bc = 0
ab + bd = 0

In particular, by means of the homeomorphism : M2(R) →R4, the set X can be
identiﬁed with the set

Solutions
S = {u = (a, b, c, d) ∈R4 | ψ1(u) = ψ2(u) = ψ3(u) = ψ4(u) = 0},
where
ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4 : R4 →R
are the functions
ψ1(x, y, z, w) = x2 + yz,
ψ2(x, y, z, w) = xy + yw,
ψ3(x, y, z, w) = yz + z2,
ψ4(x, y, z, w) = xz + zw.
In other words,
S = ψ−1
1 ({0}) ∩ψ−1
2 ({0}) ∩ψ−1
3 ({0}) ∩ψ−1
4 ({0})
and since each ψi is a polynomial function, and thus continuous, the set φ−1
i
({0}) is
closed (since {0} is closed in R). We see that S is the intersection of four closed sets,
and hence it is itself closed.
We show now that X is not compact. Indeed, for all n ∈Z, consider the subset
Un =
a b
c d

∈X | a ∈(n −1, n + 1) , b ∈R, c ∈R, d ∈R

∩X.
Each Un is an open set in X. Furthermore, one has that

n∈Z
Un = X.
But there is no ﬁnite sub-family of {Un}n∈Z that still covers X. Indeed, for any m ∈Z,
the matrix
m 0
0 0

belongs only to Um.
Finally, we show that X is connected. In fact, we prove that X is path-connected.
To do that, take any A ∈X. We ﬁrst notice that there exists a non-singular matrix
M ∈M2(R) such that
A = M−1 ·
0 b
0 0

· M,
for b ∈R. In other words, any matrix in X is similar to an upper-triangular matrix.
Indeed, consider A as a matrix in M2(C). Since C is algebraically closed, A can be
triangulated in M2(C), namely, it is similar to a matrix
a b

,
with a, b, c possibly complex numbers. The condition A2 = 0 reads as

Solutions

⎧

a2 = 0
ab + bc = 0
c2 = 0,
hence the eigenvalues are a = 0 and c = 0. In particular, the eigenvalues belong to
R. Therefore A is triangulable also in M2(R), proving the claim.
Now, consider the path

γ (t) = M−1 ·

Note that, for any t ∈[0, 1], (γ (t))2 = 0, and hence γ (t) ∈X. Note also that
γ : [0, 1] →X is continuous and that
γ (0) =

0 0

and
γ (1) = A,
proving that, for any A ∈X, there exists a path connecting it to the zero matrix. This
clearly sufﬁces to show that any two elements in X can be connected by a path in X,
and thus X is path-connected, as claimed.

1. We prove that ˜X is T1 and hence also T0. We have to prove that, for any
pair of distinct points p, q ∈˜X, there exists a neighborhood Up of p not
containing q and a neighborhood Uq of q not containing p. Consider ﬁrst
the following case. Suppose that the points are p = [(x, 1)] = [(x, 2)] with
x ∈R −{0} and q =


with x′ ∈R and y′ ∈{1, 2}. Take r ∈R such

are open neighborhoods of p, respec-
tively q, and it holds that p /∈Uq and q /∈Up. It remains to consider just the
case p = [(0, 1)] and q = [(0, 2)]. In this case, we consider the sets Up =

[(u, 1)] ∈˜X | u ∈R

and Uq =

[(v, 2)] ∈˜X | v ∈R

. These are clearly
neighborhoods of p, respectively q, and p /∈Uq and q /∈Up. The space ˜X is thus
T1.
We prove next that ˜X is not T2. Consider the points p = [(0, 1)] , q = [(0, 2)] ∈˜X
for which we prove that no disjoint neighborhoods exist. Indeed, any neighbor-
hood of p contains an open neighborhood of the type

for some r′ > 0. We thus see that the
intersection of any two neighborhoods of p and q is non-empty.
2. We prove next that ˜X is not compact. Indeed, for any n ∈Z −{0}, consider the
open set
Un =

[(x, 1)] = [(x, 2)] ∈˜X | n −1 < x < n + 1

and consider also the open sets
U ′

and

.
The family U = {Un}n∈Z−{0} ∪

provides an open covering of ˜X. But,
for any m ∈Z, the point [(m, y)] ∈˜X, for y ∈{1, 2}, belongs to just one of the
elements of the family U. Hence there exists no ﬁnite sub-family of U covering
˜X. This proves that ˜X is not compact.
3. We prove that ˜X is path-connected. Indeed, consider a point [(x, y)] ∈˜X with
x ∈R and y ∈{1, 2}. Consider the path
γ : [0, 1] →˜X,
γ (t) = [((1 −t) x + t, y)] .
Note that γ : [0, 1] →˜X is continuous and that
γ (0) = [(x, y)]
while
γ (1) = [(1, 1)] = [(1, 2)] .
Hence, any point [(x, y)] ∈˜X can be connected to the point [(1, 1)] = [(1, 2)]
by means of a continuous path in ˜X.
9.16 Note that X1 and X2 are not compact, while X3 and X4 are. Hence Xi ≇X j

Finally, note that X3 ≇X4. Indeed, the property that a topological space remains
connected after removing two points is a topological invariant. But if one removes
two points from X4, then the space obtained is connected while any two points one
removes from X3 results in a disconnected space.
9.17 Let S be an uncountable set and endow it with the cocountable topology. In
this topology every countable subset is closed since its complement obviously has
countable complement. In the other direction, if F is a closed subset of S, then its
complement S −F is open, and thus either F = S, or the complement of S −F,
which is F, is countable. We thus identiﬁes the closed sets as the collection
F = {F ⊆S | F is countable} ∪{S}.
Since a countable union of countable sets is countable, it follows that the collection
F is stable under countable unions. To see that taking arbitrary unions may take one
outside of the collection F it sufﬁces to observe that a proper uncountable subset of
S exists. Indeed, let X ⊂S be such a set. Since
X =

x∈X
{x}
the set X is certainly a union of closed sets. However, since X is uncountable and
X ̸= S, it follows that S is not closed. We leave it to the reader to exhibit proper
uncountable subsets of S.
9.18 Since A is a real symmetric matrix, it is diagonalizable. It follows that, up to a

9.19 We prove that D is open in X. Take any point p ∈D. Since D is locally compact,
there exists a compact set K ⊆D in D and an open set U in X such that
p ∈U ∩D ⊆K.

308
Solutions
Consider the setU −K ⊆X, which is open in X since K is compact in the Hausdorff
space X, and is thus closed. Since D is dense, if the open set U −K were non-empty,
it would intersect D, but this contradicts with
U ∩D ⊆K.
Hence U −K = ∅, that is
p ∈U ⊆K ⊆D.
Hence the point p is an interior point of D. As p was arbitrary, we conclude that all
of the points of D are interior, and thus that D is open.

1. We have to show that V contains the empty set and the whole space X, and that
it is closed under ﬁnite unions and under arbitrary intersections. Indeed, ∅=
V (1 · Z) ∈V and X = V (0 · Z) ∈V. Take V (a1 · Z) ∈V and V (a2 · Z) ∈V.
Note that
V (a1 · Z) ∪V (a2 · Z) = V (lcm{a, b} · Z) ∈V.
Consider the family {V (an · Z)}n∈Z ⊆V. Note that

n∈Z
V (an · Z) = V (gcd{an : n ∈Z}) ∈V.
2. We prove that {0 · Z} ⊂X is dense in X, that is, {0 · Z} = X. Indeed, the only
closed set containing {0 · Z} is V (0 · Z) = X. In particular, X is the smallest
closed set containing {0 · Z}, which is precisely the closure.
3. We prove now that X is not Hausdorff. Indeed, note that for any a ∈Z the
closed set V (a · Z) = {p · Z | p is a prime dividing a or p = a = 0} is a ﬁnite
set. Hence, any two open sets in X intersect and hence X is not T2.
Metric Spaces
9.21 Recall that in a metric space every compact set is also sequentially compact.
Since {xn}n∈N does not admit any convergent subsequence, the space (X, d) cannot
be sequentially compact, and consequently is not compact. Another approach to this
problem is to use the fact that a metric space is compact if, and only if, it is complete
and totally bounded. But clearly X is not totally bounded (though it may be bounded
and it may be complete).
9.22 To show that ℓ∞is connected we actually show that it is path-connected and thus
consider an arbitrary bounded real sequence x = (xn)n ∈ℓ∞, for which it sufﬁces
to construct a path to the 0 vector, namely the constantly 0 sequence. To that end,

Solutions

consider the function
γ : [0, 1] →ℓ∞,
γ (t) = (txn)n .
Notice that the codomain is indeed ℓ∞, as is immediately seen (in fact this is nothing
but the closure of ℓ∞under scalar products). Since γ (1) = x and γ (0) = 0, it remains
to show that γ is continuous with respect to the relevant metrics. And indeed, for all
t, s ∈[0, 1], it holds that
d (γ (t), γ (s)) = d
 
(txn)n , (sxn)n

|(t −s) · xn| = |t −s| · sup
n
|xn| = ∥x∥∞· d(s, t)
and thus γ is uniformly continuous (notice that we actually proved γ is Lipschitz),
and thus continuous, as was needed.
To see that ℓ∞as not compact it sufﬁces to construct a sequence of inﬁnitely
many vectors with all pair-wise distances equal to 1. This can easily be done in
many ways. We mention here another approach. Notice that the set of all vectors of
the form x = (x1, 0, 0, 0, . . .), with x1 ∈R arbitrary, in other words the kernel of
the shift mapping f : ℓ∞→ℓ∞, is a closed subspace of ℓ∞which with the induced
metric is isometric to R with the Euclidean metric. Since ℓ∞is Hausdorff (any metric
space is Hausdorff), if ℓ∞were compact, then R would be compact as well (since
any compact subspace of a compact Hausdorff space is compact). But R is of course
not compact.
9.23 For all n ≥0 let Xn = {x ∈R | f (n) = 0}. Since f is inﬁnitely differentiable,
f (n) is continuous, and thus the set Xn, being the inverse image of the closed set {0},
is closed. Moreover, the condition on the function f states precisely that
R =

n≥0
Xn
and thus we have expressed the non-empty and complete metric space R (with the
Euclidean metric) as a countable union of closed sets. By Baire’s Theorem at least
one of the sets Xn contains a non-empty open set. Thus, there exists an n ≥0 and an
open set U ̸= ∅with U ⊆Xn. But any open set in R, by deﬁnition, contains an open
interval. Thus, there exist a < b with (a, b) ⊆Xn. In other words, f (n)(x) = 0 for
all x ∈(a, b). Integrating n times in the range a to b reveals that f is a polynomial
of degree at most n.
9.24 Recall that in any inner product space the parallelogram law
∥x + y∥2 + ∥x −y∥2 = 2∥x∥2 + 2∥y∥2
holds for all vectors x and y. We prove that there exists no inner product on
C([0, 1], R) whose associated norm is ∥·∥∞by showing the parallelogram law fails.
Indeed, consider, for example, the continuous functions x, y : [0, 1] →R given by

310
Solutions
x(t) = 1
and
x(t) = t.
One computes that
∥x + y∥2
∞+ ∥x −y∥2
∞= max
t∈[0,1] |x(t) + y(t)|2 + max
t∈[0,1] |x(t) −y(t)|2
= max
t∈[0,1] |1 + t|2 + max
t∈[0,1] |1 −t|2 = 4 + 1 = 5
while
2 ∥x∥2
∞+ 2 ∥y∥2
∞= 2 max
t∈[0,1] |x(t)|2 + 2 max
t∈[0,1] |y(t)|2
= 2 max
t∈[0,1] |1|2 + 2 max
t∈[0,1] |t|2 = 2 · 1 + 2 · 1 = 4.
Therefore, the norm ∥·∥does not satisfy the parallelogram law and is thus not induced
by any inner product.
9.25 A metric on the empty set is a function d : ∅× ∅→R+ satisfying the metric
axioms. The domain is the empty set, and thus there is a unique such function, which
is vacuously satisfying the metric axioms. As for a metric on a singleton set X = {p},
that is a function X × X →R+, notice that the axioms require that d(p, p) = 0, and
thus d is already determined. It is trivially seen that this d indeed determines a metric
on X. Finally, if X contains at least two distinct points p an q, then noting ﬁrst that
there always exists a metric structure on d, for instance d(x, y) = 1 for all x ̸= y and
d(x, x) = 0 for all x, the existence of inﬁnitely many non-isometric metric structures
follows by noting that if d is any metric function and α > 0 an arbitrary positive real
number, then deﬁning
αd : X × X →R+
by (αd)(x, y) = αd(x, y) is also a metric on X. Clearly the spaces (X, d) and
(X, αd) are isometric if, and only if, α = 1 or if d(x, y) = 0 for all points. However,
since p ̸= q we have that d(p, q) ̸= 0. We thus obtain inﬁnitely many non-isometric
metrics on X.
9.26 Suppose that x ∈X satisﬁes d(x, S) = 0 and let U be an arbitrary open set with
x ∈U. It then holds that Bε(x) ⊆U for some ε > 0. Since d(x, S) = 0 it follows
that there is an element s ∈S with d(x, s) < ε. In particular then s ∈Bε(x) ⊆U.
We thus showed that every open set containing x intersects S, and thus x ∈S.
Conversely, if x /∈S, then (noting that S is closed, and thus its complement is
open) there exists an ε > 0 with Bε(x) ⊆X −S. But then d(x, s) ≥ε for all s ∈S,
and thus d(x, S) ≥ε.
9.27 We establish the metric space axioms for ˜d. Clearly, ˜d(x, y) ≥0 for all x, y ∈X.
If ˜d(x, y) = 0, then d(x, y) = 0 and thus x = y. For all x, y ∈X if d(x, y) < 1, then
˜d(x, y) = d(x, y) = d(y, x) = ˜d(y, x)

Solutions
311
while if d(x, y) ≥1, then d(y, x) ≥1 too, and thus ˜d(x, y) = 1 = ˜d(y, x). Finally,
the veriﬁcation of the triangle inequality follows similarly by case splitting.
To show that d and ˜d induce the same topology, it sufﬁces to notice that an open
ball Bε(x) of radius ε < 1 is the same set when computed in (X, d) as it is when
computing in (X, ˜d).
9.28 We prove that there exists no isometry from R2 to R when endowed with the
Euclidean metrics dR2 and dR respectively. Indeed, suppose that such an isometry
f : R2 →R exists. Take P, Q, R ∈R2 such that
dR2(P, Q) = dR2(P, R) = dR2(Q, R) = 1.
Denote by p = f (P), q = f (Q), and r = f (R) the images in R of the three chosen
points. Since f is an isometry, it follows that
|p −q| = dR(p, q) = dR( f (P), f (Q)) = dR2(P, Q) = 1,
and analogously that |p −r| = 1 and |q −r| = 1. However, elementary algebra
reveals this to an impossibility.
9.29 We show that ds satisﬁes the metric axioms, remembering that each di does.
Firstly, for all x ∈X
ds(x, x) = sup
i∈I
di(x, x) = sup
i∈I
{0} = 0.
Next, for all x, y ∈X
ds(x, y) = sup
i∈I
{di(x, y)} = sup
i∈I
{di(y, x)} = ds(y, x).
Finally, for all x, y, z ∈X, we need to show that
sup
i∈I
{di(x, z)} ≤sup
i∈I
{di(x, y)} + sup
i∈I
{di(y, z)}
for which it sufﬁces to show, for each i ∈I, that
di(x, z) ≤sup
i∈I
{di(x, y)} + sup
i∈I
{di(y, z)}
And indeed, given i ∈I, using the triangle inequality for di
di(x, z) ≤di(x, y) + di(y, z) ≤sup
i∈I
{di(x, y)} + sup
i∈I
{di(y, z)},
completing the proof.
For an example showing that the inﬁmum of metric functions need not be a metric
function, consider a set X = {a, b, c} with three distinct points. On it consider the

312
Solutions
following assignments of distances
d1(a, b) = 1 d2(a, b) = 2
d1(b, c) = 2 d2(b, c) = 1
d1(a, c) = 3 d2(a, c) = 3
which are easily seen to endow X with two structures of metric space. How-
ever, when computing the minima of the distances one obtains the function e with
e(a, b) = e(b, c) = 1, and e(a, c) = 3. Therefore e(a, c) > e(a, b) + e(b, c) and so
the triangle inequality fails.
9.30
1. No, not continuity nor uniform continuity sufﬁces. For instance, let X = R with
the Euclidean topology and consider f : R →R with f (x) = arctan(x), which
is uniformly continuous, and thus also continuous. Then R is complete but the set
F(X) = (−π/2, π/2) is not complete.
2. Uniform continuity is a sufﬁcient condition. Indeed, to show that F(X) is totally
bounded, let ε > 0 be given and we will ﬁnd a covering of F(X) by sets
whose diameters do not exceed ε. Let δ > 0 correspond to the given ε, that
is diam(F(S)) < ε whenever S ⊆X satisﬁes diam(S) < δ. Since X is totally
bounded, one can cover X by sets S1, . . . , Sm whose diameters do not exceed
δ. Each of the images f (S1), . . . , f (Sm) has diameter not exceeding ε, and they
cover F(X), as needed. Finally, we note that continuity alone does not sufﬁce. For
instance, consider the function tan : (−π/2, π/2) →R, with R endowed with the
Euclidean metric and the interval with the induced metric. The interval is totally
bounded but its image, R, is not even bounded.
3. Continuity, and thus also uniform continuity, sufﬁces. Indeed, in a metric space a
set is compact if, and only if, it is complete and totally bounded. Moreover, for a
function f , the image f (C) is compact whenever C is.
Normed Spaces and Banach Spaces
9.31 First we show that the metric d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥induced by the norm of a
normed space V is translation invariant and scale homogeneous. Indeed,
d(x + z, y + z) = ∥(x + z) −(y + z)∥= ∥x −z∥= d(x, z)
holds for all x, y, z ∈V and for any scalar α
d(αx, αy) = ∥αx −αy∥= ∥α(x −y)∥= |α|∥x −y∥= |α|d(x, y).

Solutions
313
In the other direction, suppose that V is endowed with a translation invariant and
scale homogeneous metric d. We then deﬁne, for all x ∈V
∥x∥= d(0, x)
and proceed to show that the axioms for a normed space are satisﬁed. It is clear that
∥x∥≥0 for all x ∈V and that if ∥x∥= 0, then d(0, x) = 0, and thus x = 0. For
any scalar α and x ∈V one has
∥αx∥= d(0, αx) = d(α · 0, αx) = |α|d(0, x) = |α|∥x∥.
Finally, for all x, y ∈V we have, by translation invariance, that d(x, x + y) =
d(0, y). It then follows that
∥x + y∥= d(0, x + y) ≤d(0, x) + d(x, x + y) = d(0, x) + d(0, y) = ∥x∥+ ∥y∥,
as required.
9.32
1. We establish the norm axioms for the given proposed norm function. Clearly
∥f ∥≥0 since the integral of a non-negative function is non-negative. Moreover,
suppose that ∥f ∥= 0 for a continuous function f : [a, b] →R. If f ̸= 0, then
f (x0) ̸= 0 for some x0 ∈[a, b]. Since | f (x)| is continuous and | f (x0)| > 0 it
follows that there is an interval (c, d) ⊆[a, b] upon which | f (x)| attains values
greater than | f (x0)|/2 > 0. It follows that
" b
a
| f (x)|dx ≥
" d
c
| f (x)|dx ≥(d −c)| f (x0)|/2 > 0
which is a contradiction. We conclude thus that ∥f ∥= 0 implies f = 0. Next,
for all λ ∈R
∥λ · f ∥=
" b
a
|λ · f (x)| dx = λ ·
" b
a
| f (x)| dx = λ · ∥f ∥.
Finally, for f : [a, b] →R and g : [a, b] →R, it holds that
∥f + g∥=
" b
a
| f (x) + g(x)| dx ≤
" b
a
| f (x)| dx +
" b
a
|g(x)| dx = ∥f ∥+ ∥g∥,
establishing the triangle inequality.
2. We prove that the metric space (X, d) with d( f, g) = ∥f −g∥is not complete.
For simplicity, assume that [a, b] = [−1, 1]. We provide an example of a Cauchy
sequence in X having no limit point in X. For all n ∈N, consider the function

314
Solutions
fn : [0, 1] →R,
fn(x) =

Note that fn(x) ∈X for all n ∈N. Furthermore, for n, m ∈N with n < m one

It thus follows that the sequence ( fn)n∈N is a Cauchy sequence in (X, d).
We prove now that ( fn)n∈N has no limit point in X. Indeed, we claim that, if such
a limit point f ∈X were to exist, then it would be that
f (x) = −1 for all x ∈[−1, 0)
and
f (x) = 1 for all x ∈(0, 1],
which is absurd since such a function f is not continuous on [−1, 1]. To prove the
claim, suppose that there were a point x ∈[−1, 0) such that | f (x) −(−1)| = δ
for some δ > 0. For simplicity, we assume x ̸= −1: otherwise, by continuity, if
x = −1, then there exists a point x′ > −1 such that
 f (x′) −(−1)
 = δ′ > 0.
Then, by continuity, there would be a neighbourhood (x −ε, x + ε) ⊆[−1, 0),
where ε > 0, of x in [−1, 0) such that | f (y) −(−1)| > δ/2 for all y ∈(x −
ε, x + ε). Choose N > −1/(x + ε), so x + ε < −1/N. Hence, for all n ≥N, it
holds that
∥fn −f ∥=
" 1

| fn(x) −f (x)| dx ≥

| fn(x) −f (x)| dx ≥2 εδ > 0,
which is not possible.
9.33 We ﬁrst prove that d is a distance on R. Firstly, it is clear that for all x, y ∈R
0 ≤d(x, y) = d(y, x).
Furthermore, if d(x, y) = 0 then |x −y| = 0, and thus x = y. For the triangle
inequality, consider the function f : [0, ∞)] →[0, ∞] given by
f (t) =
t
1 + t
and notice that the proposed distance function is
d(x, y) = f (dE(x, y))

Solutions
315
where dE(x, y) = |x −y| is the Euclidean metric on R. Using elementary analysis
it is seen that f is monotonically increasing and that it is concave and thus it is also
subadditive, i.e.,
f (s + t) ≤f (s) + f (t).
We may now argue as follows. For all x, y, z ∈R
d(x, z) = f (dE(x, z)) ≤f (dE(x, y) + dE(y, z))
where we used the monotonicity of f . The subadditivity of f now implies that
f (dE(x, y) + dE(y, z)) ≤f (dE(x, y)) + f (dE(y, z)) = d(x, y) + d(y, z)
establishing the triangle inequality, and thus that (R, d) is a metric space.
We now show that d is not induced by any norm. Indeed, if there were such a
norm x →∥x∥for which d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥, then, for all x, y ∈R and all λ ∈R,
it would hold that
d(λx, λy) = ∥λx −λy∥= |λ| · ∥x −y∥= |λ| · d(x, y) .
However, By using the explicit expression of d, we get
|λx −λy|
1 + |λx −λy| =
|x −y|
1 + |x −y|
and taking, e.g., x = 1, y = 0, and λ = 2, the left-hand-side is 2/3 while the right-
hand-side is 1/2, yielding an absurdity.
9.34 To show that the topology induced by ∥· ∥2 is ﬁner than the topology induced
by ∥· ∥1 it sufﬁces to show that the identity function
id : (X, ∥· ∥2) →(X, ∥· ∥1)
is continuous. And indeed, given ε > 0 let δ = ε/K. Then, for all x1, x2 ∈X such
that ∥x1 −x2∥2 < δ, one has ∥id(x1) −id(x2)∥1 = ∥x1 −x2∥1 ≤K · ∥x1 −x2∥2 <
Kδ = ε.
9.35
1. Given x, y ∈V with ∥x∥= ∥y∥= 1, for every 0 ≤α ≤1 the triangle inequality
gives
∥αx + (1 −α)y∥≤∥αx∥+ ∥(1 −α)y∥= α∥x∥+ (1 −α)∥y∥= 1.
2. Suppose now that ∥x∥2 = ⟨x, x⟩for an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩on V , and let’s assume
the ground ﬁeld is R (the case K = C is left as an extra exercise). If x ̸= y satisfy
∥x∥= ∥y∥= 1, then for all 0 < α < 1

316
Solutions
∥αx + (1 −α)y∥2 = α2 + (1 −α)2 + 2α(1 −α)⟨x, y⟩.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality we have that
|⟨x, y⟩| ≤∥x∥∥y∥= 1.
Since x ̸= y and ∥x∥= ∥y∥, it follows that x is not a scalar multiple of y, and
thus the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality holds strictly. Thus ⟨x, y⟩< 1 and it follows
that
∥αx + (1 −α)y∥2 < 1 + 2α2 −2α + 2α −2α2 = 1
showing that ∥αx + (1 −α)y∥< 1 and thus the only points of intersection of
L(x, y) with the unit sphere occur when α = 0 or α = 1 at the points y and x,
respectively.
3. Assume that x ̸= y satisfy ∥x∥= ∥y∥= 1 in a strictly convex space. By the
triangle inequality ∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥≤2 so we just need to show that ∥x +
y∥= 2 is impossible. Indeed, if ∥x + y∥= 2, then
∥(1/2)x + (1/2)y∥= (1/2)∥x + y∥= 1
contradicting strict convexity.
4. R2 with the ℓ2 norm is strictly convex since the ℓ2 norm is induced by an inner
product (the standard inner product). That R2 with the ℓ1 norm is not strictly
convex is seen by choosing x = (1, 0) and y = (0, 1). Then ∥x∥1 = ∥y∥1 = 1
but ∥x + y∥= 2. Similarly, for x = (1, 1) and y = (1, −1) it holds that ∥x∥∞=
∥y∥∞, but ∥x + y∥∞= 2, showing that the ℓ∞norm is not strictly convex either.
9.36 To show that the kernel of A is a closed linear subspace of V recall that the
kernel, by deﬁnition, is the set A−1({0}). The fact that the kernel is a linear subspace
of the domain was established in the main text and in any case is easy to re-establish
if needed. To show that the kernel is closed recall that the inverse image under
a continuous function of a closed set is closed. Since a bounded linear operator is
continuous, it sufﬁces to show that {0} is a closed set in W. Indeed, the metric induced
on W by the norm is a metrizable topology and thus is Hausdorff, and thus every
singleton set is closed.
9.37 The veriﬁcation that A is a linear operator is trivial, and thus we omit it. Next
we observe that for all x ∈ℓ2 with x ̸= 0
∥Ax∥2 =

317
holds for all x ̸= 0. It follows that ∥A∥≤1 and that if ∥A∥= 1, then the norm is
never attained. To see that the operator norm of A is indeed precisely 1, consider
en = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, 0, . . .)
with 1 in the n-th position. It holds that
∥Aen∥= 1 −1
n
and since ∥en∥= 1 it follows that ∥A∥≥∥Aen∥, for all n ≥1, and so we conclude
that indeed ∥A∥= 1.
9.38 The composition of linear operators is always a linear operator, so all we need
to do is show the composition B A is bounded, which will be done by showing the
requested upper bound of the operator norm. Indeed, for all x ∈U
∥B Ax∥= ∥B(Ax)∥≤∥B∥∥Ax∥≤∥B∥∥A∥∥x∥
and the claim follows.
9.39 In an exercise the reader was requested to prove that for bounded linear operators
A, B ∈B(B), if A is invertible and ∥A −B∥< ∥A∥, then B is invertible. With this
result in mind one just needs to correctly interpret the meaning of the claim that G is
open. Let A ∈G be given. To show that G is open it sufﬁces to show that G contains
an open ball with positive radius and centre A. In other words, we need to ﬁnd ε > 0
such that every B ∈B(B) with ∥A −B∥< ε is invertible. By the above result, one
may take ε = ∥A∥, which is positive (since A is invertible, so clearly A ̸= 0).
9.40 Notice that the domain of ST is the set {x ∈B1 | T x ∈D(S)}. Given a sequence
{xn} ∈in the domain of ST , suppose that xn →x0 and that ST xn →z. We need to
show that x0 is in the domain of ST and that ST x0 = z. Indeed, since T is continuous,
it follows that
T xn →T x0.
Since T xn is in the domain of S and since S(T xn) →z, it follows from the fact that
S is closed that T x0 is in the domain of S and that ST x0 = z. Thus, as was required,
we see that x0 is in the domain of S and that ST x0 = z, showing ST is closed.
Topological Groups
9.41 Firstly, note that Rn with the Euclidean topology is a Hausdorff topological
space since the topology is metrizable. Both the group sum
+: Rn × Rn →Rn,
((a1, . . . , an) , (b1, . . . , bn))

318
Solutions
and the group inverse
−: Rn →Rn,
(a1, . . . , an) →(−a1, . . . , −an)
are continuous with respect to the Euclidean topology on Rn and to the product
topology on Rn × Rn. Hence, the additive group Rn with the Euclidean topology is
a topological group. In fact, the map
R × Rn →Rn,
(λ, (a1, . . . , an))
·→(λ · a1, . . . , λ · an)
is also continuous with respect to the Euclidean topology of Rn and the product
topology of R × Rn. That is to say, the R-vector space Rn is actually a topological
vector space.
9.42 Note that SLn(R) = det−1 ({1}), and det: GLn(R) →R is continuous. Hence
SLn(R) is a closed subgroup of the topological group GLn(R). In particular, SLn(R)
is a topological group.
9.43 Note that O(n) = ϕ−1 ({idn}), where ϕ : GLn(R) →GLn(R) is given by
ϕ(A) = At A
and is a continuous map. Hence O(n) is a closed subgroup of the topological group
GLn(R). In particular, O(n) is a topological group.
9.44 Note that SO(n) = det−1 ({1}), where det: O(n) →{1, −1} is continuous.
Hence SO(n) is a closed subgroup of the topological group O(n) and is thus a
topological group.
9.45 Note that Sp2n(R) = ϕ−1 ({J0}), where ϕ : GL2n(R) →GL2n(R) is given by
ϕ(A) = At · J0 · A
is a continuous map. Hence Sp2n(R) is a closed subgroup of the topological group
GL2n(R), and thus is itself a topological group.
9.46 For a given B ∈SO(n), we construct a path
γ : [0, 1] →SO(n)
such that
γ (0) = idn and γ (1) = B.
The matrix B being orthogonal, there exists an orthogonal matrix M such that
B = MtK M
where
K =
⎛
⎝
idp
−idq
S
⎞
⎠,

Solutions

with q = 2r and, for k = n −(p + q),
S =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
cos α1 −sin α1

cos α1
...
cos αk −sin αk
sin αk
cos αk
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
for some α1, . . . , αk ∈(0, π) ∪(π, 2π). For t ∈[0, 1], deﬁne
Kt =
⎛
⎝
idp
Rt
St
⎞
⎠,
where
Rt =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
cos(tπ) −sin(tπ)
sin(tπ) cos(tπ)
...
cos(tπ) −sin(tπ)
sin(tπ) cos(tπ)
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
.
and
St =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
cos(tα1) −sin(tα1)
sin(tα1) cos(tα1)
...
cos(tαk) −sin(tαk)
sin(tαk) cos(tαk)
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
.
Hence deﬁne, for all t ∈[0, 1],
γ (t) = MtKt M ∈SO(n).
Since γ : [0, 1] →SO(n) connects idn to B, we get that SO(n) is path-connected
and hence also connected.
9.47 Note that O(n) is the disjoint union of O+(n) and O−(n), where
O+(n) = {A ∈O(n) | det(A) > 0}
and
O−(n) = {A ∈O(n) | det(A) < 0} .
Furthermore, O+(n) and O−(n) are homeomorphic. In fact, the map

320
Solutions
Or+(n) →Or−(n),
⎛
⎜⎝
x11 x12 · · · x1n

⎟⎠→
⎛
⎜⎝
−x11 x12 · · · x1n
...
... ...
...
−xn1 xn2 · · · xnn
⎞
⎟⎠
provides a homeomorphism. Therefore, it sufﬁces to show that O+(n) is path-
connected. But O+(n) = SO(n), and the claim follows since it was already estab-
lished that SO(n) is path-connected.
9.48 For a given B ∈GL+
n (R), we construct a path
γ : [0, 1] →GL+
n (R)
such that
γ (0) = idn and γ (1) = B.
By the polar decomposition theorem there are a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix L
and an orthogonal matrix P such that B = L P. Since det(L) > 0 and P is orthogo-
nal, it follows that det(P) = 1, and hence P ∈O+(n) = SO(n). The matrix L being
symmetric, there exists an orthogonal matrix C such that
L = CtC
where
 =
⎛
⎜⎝
λ1
...
λn
⎞
⎟⎠.
For all t ∈[0, 1] deﬁne
t =
⎛
⎜⎝
tλ1 + (1 −t)
...
tλn + (1 −t)
⎞
⎟⎠.
Since the topological group SO(n) is path-connected, there exists a path
μ: [0, 1] →SO(n)
such that
μ(0) = idn and μ(1) = P.
Hence deﬁne, for all t ∈[0, 1],
γ (t) = CttCμ(t).
Since γ : [0, 1] →GL+
n (R) connects idn to B, we get that GL+
n (R) is path-connected
and hence also connected.
9.49 Note that the function det: Mn(R) →R being continuous and surjective, the
sets
GL+
n (R) = det−1 ((0, +∞))
and
GL−
n (R) = det−1 ((−∞, 0))
are non-empty open sets and

Solutions
321
GL+
n (R) ∩GL−
n (R) = ∅
while
GLn(R) = GL+
n (R) ∪GL−
n (R).
Note also that GL+
n (R) and GL−
n (R) are homeomorphic, in fact, the map
GL+
n (R) →GL−
n (R),
⎛
⎜⎝
x11 x12 · · · x1n
...
...
...
...
xn1 xn2 · · · xnn
⎞
⎟⎠→
⎛
⎜⎝
−x11 x12 · · · x1n
...
... ...
...
−xn1 xn2 · · · xnn
⎞
⎟⎠
provides a homeomorphism. The claim now follows since it was already proved that
GL+
n (R) is path-connected, and hence GL−
n (R) is path-connected as well.
9.50 For a given B ∈SLn(R) we construct a path
γ : [0, 1] →SLn(R)
such that
γ (0) = idn and γ (1) = B.
By the polar decomposition theorem there exist a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix
L and an orthogonal matrix P such that B = L P. In particular, since det(B) = 1,
it holds that det(P) = 1 and so det(L) = 1. The matrix L being symmetric, there
exists an orthogonal matrix C such that
L = CtC
and since L is positive-deﬁnite with determinant equal to 1, the diagonal matrix 
has the form
 =
⎛
⎜⎝
exp(μ1)
...
exp(μn)
⎞
⎟⎠,
for some μ1, . . . , μn ∈R such that n
j=1 μ j = 0. The matrix P being orthogonal,
there exists an orthogonal matrix M such that
P = MtK M
where
K =
⎛
⎝
idp
−idq
S
⎞
⎠,
with q = 2r and, for k = n −(p + q),

322
Solutions
S =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
cos α1 −sin α1
sin α1
cos α1
...
cos αk −sin αk
sin αk
cos αk
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
for some α1, . . . , αk ∈(0, π) ∪(π, 2π). For all t ∈[0, 1] deﬁne
t =
⎛
⎜⎝
exp(tμ1)
...
exp(tμn)
⎞
⎟⎠,
and deﬁne
Kt =
⎛
⎝
idp
Rt
St
⎞
⎠,
where
Rt =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
cos(tπ) −sin(tπ)
sin(tπ) cos(tπ)
...
cos(tπ) −sin(tπ)
sin(tπ) cos(tπ)
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
.
and
St =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
cos(tα1) −sin(tα1)
sin(tα1) cos(tα1)
...
cos(tαk) −sin(tαk)
sin(tαk) cos(tαk)
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
.
Hence, deﬁne for all t ∈[0, 1]
γ (t) = CttC MtKt M ∈SLn(R).
Since γ : [0, 1] →SLn(R) connects idn to B, we get that SLn(R) is path-connected
and hence connected.
