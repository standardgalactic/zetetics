This is my concluding master's thesis for the degree in Technology and Safety in the High 
North at UiT – The Arctic University of Norway. My student experience would not have been 
the same without the individuals I have met during my time in Tromsø. Therefore, I would like 
to thank my university colleagues, who became close friends during my studies. I would also 
like to thank my coworkers in office 1.041 for the time we spent together writing our theses. 
Without the guidance, feedback, motivation, and information provided by Associate 
Professor Tae-Eun Kim at the Department of Technology and Safety, the thesis would not exist 
in its current form. Her expertise in training, decision-making, literature, methodology, and 
academic writing has enabled me to understand and progress in the academic field. 
Odd Sveinung Hareide from the Norwegian Coastal Administration is to be thanked for 
enabling this study to be conducted. The arrangement of data collection, discussions, and 
feedback have all contributed to my interest in and comprehension of the subject matter. I must 
also thank the maritime pilots and course organizers in Haugesund and Lødingen for their 
participation, curiosity, and welcoming attitude toward me and the project. Without them, this 
thesis would not have been possible. 
To comprehend the Virtual Reality simulator, I gained access to its development version. I 
would like to express my appreciation to Olav-Rasmus Vorren of Morild Interaktiv AS for 
providing the simulator, as well as ongoing updates and information. 
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my family. Annette, Jürgen, and Janne Felix's 
unwavering support means the world to me. Their encouragement, motivation, and inspiration 
has enabled me to pursue my passions, while also providing me with love. This thesis is 
dedicated to them.

Abstract 
With millions of tons of cargo transported to and from Norwegian ports every year, the 
maritime waterways in Norway are heavily used. The high consequences of accidents and 
mishaps require well trained seafarers and safe operating practices. The normal crews of vessels 
are supported by the Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA) pilot service when operating 
vessels not meeting specific regulations.  
Simulator training is used as part of the toolset designed to educate, train, and advance the 
knowledge of maritime pilots in order to improve their operability. The NCA is working on an 
internal project to distribute Virtual Reality (VR) simulators to selected pilot stations along the 
coast and train and familiarize maritime pilots with the tool. There has been a lack of research 
on virtual reality simulators and how they are implemented in maritime organizations. The goal 
of this research is to see if a VR-simulator can be used as a training tool within the Norwegian 
Coastal Administration's pilot service. Furthermore, the findings of this study contribute to the 
understanding of VR-simulators in the field of Maritime Education and Training (MET). The 
thesis is addressing two research questions: 
1. Is the Virtual Reality training useful in the competence development process of 
Norwegian maritime pilots? 
2. How can the Virtual Reality simulators improve training outcomes of today’s maritime 
pilot education? 
The data gathered from the systematic literature review corresponds to the findings of the 
interviews. Considering the similarities with previous study findings from sectors such as 
healthcare, construction, and education, it is concluded that the results of the interviews can be 
generalized. For maritime pilots, the simulator offers recurrent scenario-based training and a 
high level of immersion. Pilots can learn at home, onboard a vessel, at the pilot station, and in 
group settings thanks to the system's mobility and user-friendliness. In terms of motivation and 
training effectiveness, the study finds that VR-simulators are effective and beneficial. The 
technology received positive reviews from the pilots. The simulator can be used to teach both 
novice and experienced maritime pilots about new operations, larger tonnage, and new 
operational areas, according to the findings of the research. 
After the NCA has utilized VR-simulators for some time, additional research may analyze 
the success of VR-simulators using a training evaluation study and investigate the impact of 
VR-training in the organization.

Chapter 1. Introduction 
Maritime transport represents a large share of the world economy linking both upstream and 
downstream sectors of global productions (UNCTAD, 2021). Despite the Covid-19 related 
restrictions and lockdowns that have caused a significant decrease in the amount of maritime 
trade and port calls, the previous growth before the pandemic is expected to return rapidly 
(McBain & Teter, 2021). With a total of 51.95 million tons of cargo transported to and from 
the largest Norwegian ports in the third quarter of 2021, and 6,8 million tons in the port of 
Narvik alone, the numbers of vessels operating is immense (SSB, 2021). New challenges, such 
as the year-round increase in the size and number of cruise ships, provide new difficulties. 
Winter's deteriorating and increasingly difficult weather conditions make passage through 
confined waterways difficult. The Norwegian coast presents environmental, navigational, and 
meteorological challenges. Multiple obstacles including topography, weather, visibility, and 
traffic complicate operations in Norwegian seas (Kystverket, 2021). Therefore, navigators 
sailing along the coast of Norway need special permissions and certificates to sail coastal waters 
in larger vessels.  
Since the coastal waters and ports of Norway are often visited by international vessels, these 
coastal sailing permissions and requirements are seldom met. The Norwegian Coastal 
Administration (NCA) employs maritime pilots that board these vessels, based on their size, 
tonnage, and cargo, and advise them through their voyage in these waters. The Norwegian law 
for pilotage and pilot exemption certificates (2015) describes in what circumstances the vessel 
is required to have guidance from a maritime pilot. Sizes above 50 meters in vessels carrying 
passengers, and dangerous goods, as well as vessels longer than 70 meters or a width of 20 
meters are generally required by the law to have a pilot onboard in coastal waters.  
Maritime pilots advise the crew onboard vessels their voyages through specific waters. 
Norwegian maritime pilots have special certificates on the area they are assigned, and know of 
risk areas, environmental parameters and hazards that need to be accounted for when 
navigating. In Norway the Norwegian Coastal Administration is responsible for the maritime 
pilot services (Kystverket, 2022). The maritime pilots based under the regional office for 
Nordland have the responsibility for the port of Narvik. This means that the pilots board the 
vessels at a pilot boarding point in the waters outside of Narvik and stay onboard until the vessel 
is at its required destination. As it is cited in the publication Den Norske Los bind 5 (2018) 
Narvik has special environmental conditions that make the maneuvering in the port a

challenging task. In Haugesund, the increase in Cruise vessel traffic, as well as the vessels size 
pose new challenges for the maritime pilots. As cruise vessels extend their season, the maritime 
pilots need to account for worse weather in the winter year.  The large superstructure area of 
cruise vessels makes them more susceptible to wind forces, requiring maritime pilots to 
navigate differently (Kystverket, 2021).  
With the increase in complexity of operation, adequate training and knowledge is needed 
(A. Sharma, Nazir, & Ernstsen, 2019). Training of maritime navigators has changed profoundly 
over time. While traditionally it was a skill passed on by generations with lack of formal 
structure, regulations and developments in technology have changed the nature of maritime 
training (Bennett, 2017). The decreasing cost of computational power enables students to use 
simulators in a new way. To become a pilot candidate, one must first complete maritime 
education at a university or college, followed by deck cadet training. A maritime pilot trainee 
requires 3 years of sailing experience as a watchkeeper on a vessel over 50 meters, or an 
equivalent military position. They must be master mariners with unlimited tonnage and no area 
restrictions (Forskrift om opplæring og sertifisering av loser, 2019). 
The training period of the pilots is determined by the coastal administration, where the 
recruits are assessed both theoretically and practically after an education plan. By the end of 
the training, their skills are assessed with an oral and practical evaluation, where the recruit 
must show adequate knowledge of the relevant routes and places. In some cases, up to 1/3 of 
the practical training can be done in a simulator, if this is described in the training plan (Forskrift 
om opplæring og sertifisering av loser, 2019, para. §3(2)). However, the training in simulators 
for Norwegian pilots is most often implemented to Bridge Resource Management (BRM) and 
Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) simulator sessions. With maritime pilots being in the forefront of 
coastal navigation, their training needs to set new standards in complexity, usefulness, and level 
of navigation. Their knowledge and expertise must be current, useful, and grounded in the 
fundamentals (Kystverket, 2021). 
In the Maritime Education and Training (MET) industry, there are an abundance of simulator 
types and usages. These simulators range from large scale full-mission bridges with dedicated 
and complex computers and monitors, to low-cost desktop and laptop simulators providing a 
basic instrument or scenario (Kim et al., 2021). The different types of simulators may be 
classified with the help of DNV’s standard for maritime simulators.

1.1 Background 
The technological advancements in simulation, provide new types of simulators to emerge 
(Kavanagh et al., 2017). While simulators have existed for some time, there are multiple types 
of simulators used in maritime training today. A common characteristic of many of them is the 
need for large space, high initial investments and running cost, as well as low or no portability. 
Newer computers provide enough computational power, paired with Head Mounted Displays 
(HMD) to provide a new type of simulation. Virtual Reality (VR) simulation places the student 
right within the virtual environment (Di Natale et al., 2020), interacting directly with a virtual 
ship bridge, instead of a physical model.  
While the technology has been researched extensively for the last decade, with the ever-
decreasing cost of VR simulations, there seems to be a lack of case studies regarding the 
implementation of such technology. With well documented and researched advantages of 3D 
virtual environments, on student training output and effectiveness (Dalgarno & Lee, 2010), 
there is a lack of this implementation knowledge of the end-user. 
Thru work with simulation fidelity, immersion, and effectiveness of simulator training, it 
has become clear that while the studies conclude differently on many theoretical aspects of VR 
training incorporating HMD’s, there have been few studies that have tried to implement the 
technology. As the Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA) is developing revised versions 
of their education plan, the possibility of implementing and including VR simulators is present.  
1.2 Research problem and aim 
With studies generally concluding that VR-simulations have potential to be used in 
education, and recommending future research, there are few case studies for implementation of 
the technology. As the Norwegian Coastal Administration is training, educating, and 
maintaining knowledge of maritime pilots, it is important to research how VR simulators may 
be used in their respective organization. To determine how the simulators may be implemented 
into the organization, research must be done on what the simulators may provide the maritime 
pilots.  
Previous research in the field of VR has determined that the technology has a high potential, 
but there is limited knowledge and research on how to implement and incorporate VR-
simulators. The research problem can be defined as a lack of operational and case specific 
knowledge in the implementation of maritime VR simulation, specifically oriented towards 
navigation on the highest level.  

 
Page 4 of 66 
The aim of this thesis is to determine in what capacity the VR-simulator can be implemented 
into maritime pilot training, operation, and education. It is of interest to establish a knowledge 
base on the qualitative usage of VR simulators. The project goal is dependent on collecting and 
analyzing data from maritime pilots on the feasibility of VR-simulators for maritime pilot 
operations. The project requires an extensive literature study, on the field of simulation, and a 
state-of-the-art overview of today’s knowledge must be established. Further the training 
structure, as well as training theory and assessment must be understood thoroughly.  
The objective of the study is to determine the usefulness of VR simulators in the training, 
competency development and maintenance of knowledge for maritime pilots. The research 
should lead to a recommendation in how the simulator can be implemented to improve the 
outcome of the training.  
1.3 Research questions 
The research question is derived from the aim of the research, by answering the objectives. 
To fill the research gap and come with a recommendation for implementation, two research 
questions have been derived.  
1. Is the Virtual Reality training useful in the competence development process of 
Norwegian maritime pilots? 
2. How can the Virtual Reality simulators improve training outcomes of today’s maritime 
pilot education? 
1.4 Thesis overview 
The current chapter describes the general maritime industry, and the maritime pilots’ role in 
it. It further describes the necessity of high-level training of maritime pilots, and the use of 
simulators. Additionally, the background of the thesis is described, and the research problem is 
presented. Describing the aim and objective of the research to fill the research gap is met by 
deriving research questions. In addition, the thesis structure and project overview are described.  
Chapter 2 introduces a general theory of simulation terms. Fidelity and immersion are 
described as it is of importance in further analysis of maritime pilot feedback. The output of 
training is also discussed. Further, training assessment methods and general training literature 
presented. A semi-structured literature review is conducted, introducing, reviewing, and 
analyzing prior research and scientific studies on VR simulation. Research from specific 
industries is chosen, and their findings are presented.

Chapter 3 describes the method used in the thesis. The search criteria, databases, time range, 
peer-reviews, and number of articles for the literature review is presented. The practicalities of 
the data collection, procedure and planning of the interview are described. The collection of the 
qualitative data, analysis of it and validity of it is explained. Research ethics of the handling of 
data, as well as consent forms are presented. Limitations of the method, both for the literature 
review, as well as the collection of qualitative data is analyzed and presented.  
Chapter 4 presents the results of the qualitative data collection from the systematic literature 
review and the semi-structured interview. The quantitative data from the internal survey 
performed by the NCA is presented last.  
Chapter 5 discusses the results against the literature review and how they may explain the 
usefulness of VR simulators for competence development in maritime pilotage education. It 
further discusses how the simulators may improve the outcome of training for maritime pilotage 
operations.

Chapter 2. Theoretical background 
This chapter introduces the general literature for maritime training, simulator education, 
simulation fidelity and immersion, and how these interact with the learning output of students.  
The marine industry has a positive long-term safety trend, and while vessel safety is 
improving, it remains one of the most dangerous industries, with 54 vessels lost in 2021 (Allianz 
Global Corporate & Specialty, 2022). As a result, training aboard operational vessels is 
associated with a high level of risk and resource demands. A simulator provides a risk-free 
environment in which students may practice, rehearse, and build proficiency without being 
exposed to danger. As a result, simulator training is prevalent in Maritime Education and 
Training (MET), and it is regularly used to educate future operators (Kim et al., 2021). Students 
who will be future seafarers, and operate in a high-risk setting, must be trained by maritime 
educators. One of the goals of MET is to create lessons and activities for trainees that will allow 
them to not only learn highly contextualized and situated knowledge of work environments, but 
also to work in teams while demonstrating traits such as critical thinking and leadership. As a 
result, educational frameworks that take into account the distinct nature of the marine realm are 
required (A. Sharma, Nazir, Wiig, et al., 2019). 
2.1 Maritime Education and Training  
With humankind evolving to travel larger distances, the sea posed challenges regarding 
navigation. Ever since humans started to navigate the sea they have taught and passed on 
knowledge from generation to generation. Different tactics, such as “hugging the coast” or 
using local environmental characteristics to determine ones position, as well as controlling 
heading in the night sky by the help of stars were part of this knowledge (Bennett, 2017). 
With the introduction of electricity and navigation instruments, shipping got safer. It also 
introduced more help for the navigator, meaning that the navigator was able to increase his 
situation awareness and make safer decisions. With the increase in technology, simulators were 
developed to train navigation in a low-resource and low-consequence environment (Bennett, 
2017).  
The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for 
Seafarers (STCW), 1978 as amended, set out to standardize competence requirements for 
seafarers. The convention covered basic requirements for training, certification and 
watchkeeping. Before the introduction of this international standard, each government was 
responsible for defining, regulating, and standardizing training of their own navigators. 

 
Page 7 of 66 
Through further iterations and updates to the convention, which happened in 1995 and 2010, 
the convention now defines the framework for all training and education of mariners on an 
international scale. The training is required to meet a certain set of minimum criteria. How these 
criteria are met are different depending on how the education is set up, but all marine officers 
navigating vessels have to have the minimum competency described in these regulations 
(STCW 1978, 1993).  
Simulation-based training is usually broken down into three stages. A briefing generally 
begins with an introduction to the day's task. This phase is typically characterized as being 
focused on practical knowledge, resource sharing, and the assignment's learning goals. 
Following the introduction, the simulator plays out a scenario. The teacher assigns a particular 
navigational mission to the student bridge team and starts the simulation while observing the 
students' activity. This design allows students, to assume the roles of officers in instructional 
context. The instructor's position is defined as one that supervises, facilitates, and moderates, 
progressively reducing his assistance as the pupils' abilities improve. Finally, a debriefing 
occurs. Debriefing is defined as a post-event study and reflection. Almost every study concludes 
that post-simulation debriefing is critical. Giving retrospective feedback and evaluation helps 
students learn from past experiences and prepare for future scenarios. In general, a three-phase 
structure is recommended: a narrative of what occurred, an examination as to what should be 
done differently, and a conclusion summarizing the lessons learned (Sellberg et al., 2018). 
2.2 The Norwegian maritime pilot service 
In Norway, the maritime pilots are a subbranch of the Norwegian Coastal Administration. A 
maritime pilot is familiar in specific waterways, which are either restricted, narrow, dangerous 
or pose a specific challenge for navigators. Pilots can often be grouped into different types, 
such as harbor pilot, transit pilot and general maritime pilot. However, Norwegian pilots are 
distinguished by qualifications and tests pertaining to certain vessel types and operating zones 
(Kystverket, 2021). Pilotage services are one of the many measures taken to improve maritime 
safety. In Norway, pilotage services are governed by the Ports and Waterways Act (Havne- og 
farvannsloven, 2020) and its associated regulations. All vessels over 70 meters in length or 20 
meters in width are subject to pilotage and must either use pilotage or hold a fairway certificate 
in waters subject to pilotage (Lospliktforskriften, 2015). In the years 2017 through 2019, there 
were approximately 40,000 voyages with pilots on board per year (Kystverket, 2021). 
The pilotage service is the largest business area in the Norwegian Coastal Administration in 
terms of man-hours, with approximately 350 employees. The service is divided into 7 regions 

 
Page 8 of 66 
and delivered from 25 stations along the coast as of 2021. The maritime pilots have their 
specific jurisdiction areas where they are specifically trained and examined for knowledge on 
the area (Kystverket, 2021).  In Figure 1 the ‘Losoldermannskap’ are presented inside the dotted 
line. Further the pilot stations and pilot-request centers are presented with a point and square, 
respectively.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 - Overview of NCA's operation areas, and pilot stations (Kystinfo.no, 2022) 

 
Page 9 of 66 
To be admitted as a pilot aspirant, the applicant must meet the qualifications specified by 
separate regulations (Forskrift om opplæring og sertifisering av loser, 2019). This includes a 
master's exam, a minimum master's certificate, at least three years of seagoing service as a 
responsible duty officer, and impeccable character. In addition, the pilot must maintain their 
knowledge of the waters (known as loslekse), stay current on laws and regulations pertaining 
to the service as pilotage, and meet minimum requirements for completing voyages in the 
fairways in the certificate area with an appropriate vessel, possibly with the use of a simulator. 
Pilots are required to wear a uniform and present an identification card while in service. In 
Norway, there are approximately 280 state pilots spread across 18 pilot stations. Every year, 
the pilotage service completes approximately 40,000 pilotage assignments (Kjerstad & Ording, 
2020). 
In Figure 2 a visualization of the key positions on the ship bridge are shown. The pilot boards 
the vessel with a pilot-boat or a helicopter. Further the pilot makes his way to the ship bridge. 
Here the captain or officer on watch has the command. The pilot then commences the 
navigation. In coherence with the officer on watch or captain, the pilot gives instructions for 
how the vessel should navigate, maneuver, and operate in the area. The helmsman operates and 
steers the vessel and listens to the command given by the pilot.

2.3 Ship simulators: classification and characteristics 
Simulators are now required for certain portions of the maritime education and training 
(MET) curriculum and are governed by international conventions, such as the Standards of 
Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). STCW emphasizes the use 
of simulators for both training and assessment in order to ensure that future mariners are capable 
of acting in a proper and safe manner (Sellberg et al., 2018).  
Simulator classifications 
Numerous firms provide simulators to the nautical sector. Almost all marine activities and 
vessels may be recreated or simulated in environments. This thesis discusses maritime 
navigation simulators that are used to instruct seafarers in navigation. These simulators are used 
to teach future mariners by a variety of educational institutions, businesses, governments, and 
training providers. Simulators may be classified into several categories. The different types of 
simulators can be classified with the help of Det Norske Veritas’s (DNV) standard for maritime 
simulators. The classes include full-mission, multi-task, limited task and special task, as well 
as cloud-based training, (DNV, 2021).  
Simulators for marine navigation training can be classified according to the following DNV 
standard DNV-ST-033 (DNV, 2021, p. 24):

Full mission simulators 
Full mission bridge simulators include a real bridge environment as well as displays or 
projectors that display the simulated environment. These simulators need a considerable 
amount of space, with often custom-built sets. These systems are designed to provide the user 
with a realistic work environment, like a genuine ship bridge, plane cockpit, or patient. A 
separate or integrated control room manages the environment. The user may impact a reaction 
on the situation in the simulated world by physically modifying and providing input on handles, 
switches, rudders, keyboards, and physical items. Changes in the visual scene, alerts, or 
communications must be managed on a hands-on basis by the user. The user's mechanical input 
must typically result in a sensory change in the simulator, either via visuals, sound such as 
alarms, or movement. Over the past two decades, full mission simulators have been used 
successfully to teach collaboration-related knowledge, skills, and attitudes in aviation, health 
care, the military, and nuclear power (Beaubien & Baker, 2004; Sellberg et al., 2018; 
Weissenberger, 2021).

Desktop solutions 
A desktop simulator is one that is designed to imitate a certain environment with ease of 
access. These simulators operate on machines with less processing capacity, resulting in a lower 
level of immersion. Here, one may provide input or imitate a certain navigational instrument or 
other piece of equipment. These systems are often small and do not immerse the learner in the 
surroundings. In comparison to the full mission bridge simulator, it is incapable of immersing 

 
Page 12 of 66 
the learner in complicated variations of scenario using various instruments and real items. They 
are often controlled by a keyboard and mouse, or by a reduced joystick and handle. Part task 
trainers are used in medicine to simulate portions of patients' bodies, and in aviation and 
maritime navigation for familiarization with instruments. They may be very task-oriented, with 
customized builds for a certain situation or training outcome (Beaubien & Baker, 2004; Buttussi 
& Chittaro, 2018; Weissenberger, 2021). 
Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) 
The goal of VR is to immerse the learner directly into the virtual world, without the need of 
a physical barrier such as a ship bridge. Everything is simulated and displayed as though the 
user is within the virtual environment. With head-mounted VR headsets and portable 
controllers, students may respond to and input into the simulation. These controllers represent 
the users' hands in a simulated environment and may conduct instructions in the virtual world 
via physical button inputs. A hybrid VR system is one in which a real world is combined with 
a digital simulation. This is known as augmented reality (AR). In this case, the students are 
using a headset that allows them to view the actual physical surroundings while also displaying 
information on the headset/glasses. Simulators for VR, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality 
provide a high degree of visual realism in the simulated world. The physical presses of joysticks 
and buttons on controllers for each hand of the learner control the interaction with the 
surroundings (DNV, 2021; Kurilovas, 2016; Weissenberger, 2021). 
Fidelity 
Fidelity consists of a wide field of areas. In the case of medical simulators, the degree of 
fidelity is “… usually understood as the degree to which a simulator looks, feels, and acts like 
a human patient.” (Hamstra et al., 2014, p. 387).This can also be applied to other industries 
like aviation and maritime navigation training. Where the fidelity consists of how much the 
physical and virtual environment of the simulator equals a real-life cockpit or ship bridge.  
Where one could argue that the physical look and feel is most deterministic for fidelity, this 
may vary largely dependent on what parameter that is chosen to measure. Where the training 
of students may be better in technically low fidelity simulators, should they then not be 
determined high fidelity simulators? The term fidelity may be subject to change depending on 
who, what and where it applies to. In medicine, surgeons found that mannequins had less 
simulation fidelity than cadavers, or animal models. Whereas for anesthesia specialists 

 
Page 13 of 66 
considered mannequins and VR systems as high fidelity and realistic in training (Hamstra et 
al., 2014; Weissenberger, 2021). 
In a study from 2008 on disaster response situations, the researchers found that “… 
simulators compared to live actor-patients have equivalent results in prompting critical actions 
in mass casualty drills and increase the perceived reality of such exercises.” (Gillett et al., 2008, 
p. 1144). In the given case the responders (n=130) would both care for simulated bodies, and 
trained actors. The responders were largely very satisfied with the fidelity of simulated bodies 
and did not find any disadvantages of using them compared to trained actors.  
One can classify fidelity as more of an umbrella term towards realism. Research done on the 
definition of fidelity in simulations has concluded in 5 points which describe theorems around 
fidelity in simulators (Liu et al., 2008, p. 62; Roza et al., 2000):  
1. Fidelity Models are multidimensional; they involve and can be quantified using a 
variety of factors. 
2. Fidelity is application-independent; it is an intrinsic and inherent property of a 
simulation model. 
3. Fidelity must be quantified and qualified with respect to a referent; this means that 
metrics (i.e., size, weight, shape) should exist on how to determine if a simulation 
resembles its referent.  
4. Fidelity quantification as a level of uncertainty. 
5. Fidelity comparison should be based on a common referent in order to make sense. For 
example, comparing fidelity levels of an aircraft simulator should be drawn from the 
same or similar aircraft.  
 
It is also certain that fidelity is of great importance when simulating. The 12th of November 
of 2001, an American Airlines crashed close to John F. Kennedy International Airport in USA. 
The accident was caused due to over-stressing the rudder of the Airbus A300. In the following 
accident report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NSTB), two factors were 
identified as contributing to the accident. The co-pilot who operated the rudder, was taught 
incorrect rudder application by the instructors in the flight simulator. The second factor was the 
response of the rudder pedal input, where the simulated version was significantly different. The 
mismatch between the real plane and simulator rudder control was due to a software error on 
the measurement of an elastic cable, where the stretch was less stiff in the simulator compared 
to the real aircraft (Jentsch et al., 2011).  

 
Page 14 of 66 
The accident showed how the poor physical fidelity, paired with instructors teaching flawed 
knowledge or procedures, can lead to accidents and mishaps. In aviation the physical fidelity 
of the simulators is closely paired with the actual model. As much of today’s flight clearance 
for specific planes is done in simulators, they must have high levels of fidelity. The training 
output of these simulator sessions must correspond with the real-life machine and have the 
exact same characteristics. For multi crew certificates and training a more generalized simulator 
may be used, but for type rating of pilots for specific plane types, the simulator must mimic the 
real plane with a very high physical and environmental fidelity (Myers et al., 2018).  
Compared to Aviation simulators, the physical fidelity of maritime navigation simulators is 
often more generalized. The physical simulator environment may serve more as a template 
where several types of vessels and configurations can be simulated. Due to this way of 
simulating the physical environment, it may disturb the student, or take away focus of the task. 
The training output of the simulation scenario may be affected if there are buttons, handles, and 
functions in the physical environment that are not used or interfere with the natural movement 
and operability of the equipment (Jentsch et al., 2011; Weissenberger, 2021).  
Immersion 
The term immersion originates from the world of computer games. It tries to describe the 
measure of success the video game has of entertaining the gamer. In an early study done by 
Brown and Cairns (2004) there were three main parts that defined the level of immersion in 
games. The first was named “engagement”, describing the attention, effort and time invested 
into the game, with focus on how the controls work. The second term was called “engrossment”, 
described as a Zen-like condition in which your hands appear to know exactly what to do, and 
your mind seems to keep going with the game. The gamer gets sucked into the world of the 
game and is less aware of the environment around. The third and strongest term was described 
as “total immersion”, where the gamer is close to cut off from the real world and is living inside 
the game (Jennett et al., 2008; Weissenberger, 2021).  
This way of structuring immersion into the virtual environment has been continued and can 
be seen in a study done by Miller and Bugnariu (2016). Their analysis of studies shows that the 
immersion in virtual environments can be grouped into low-, moderate- and high- immersion 
by analyzing five aspects. The aspects can be seen in Table 2.

For a simulator to have effect on the training outcome of the student, one needs to make sure 
that the student can relate the simulation to the real world. Immersion is a description on how 
real the experience feels for the student, and the level of fidelity is often intricately linked to 
the immersion experience. Fidelity is the level of detail in all the parameters and components 
of a simulation. The immersion of a situation is linked to the different senses of the human body 
that may be affected of the simulation. Smell, sound, visuals, physical environment, feelings, 
and touch all contribute to the immersion of a student in a simulation. The varying types of

simulator technology make the immersion different for every type of simulator. The highest 
immersion is achieved with VR and Indirect Reality headsets. Here the student is projected 
directly into the environment, tricking the brain to be present in the virtual world. The level of 
detail and refinement of the interaction process is what determines the total level of immersion 
in the simulator. If the interaction between the user and virtual environment is not satisfactory, 
the feel of immersion is reduced (Farra et al., 2018; Weissenberger, 2021).   
2.4 Morild Virtual Reality Simulator  
Morild Ship & Bridge is a full-featured VR mission simulator developed around the 
classification of DNV’s Class A simulators presented in Table 1. Unlimited users may train on 
the same or different ships. VR avatars allow users to view and interact with other trainees. 
Users and instructors may train in the same environment from anywhere on the globe. With 
numerous users and vessels, the solution scales accordingly (Morild Interaktiv AS, 2022). 
 
Figure 4 - Morild VR simulator setup with HMD, controllers, and laptop. 

 
Page 17 of 66 
The simulator consists of the Morild Bridge&Ship simulator software, a laptop, HMD, and 
controllers. The requirements for the laptop are given by the developers, and a powerful 
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), as well as a powerful Central Processing Unit (CPU) is 
needed. The quality of the experience is reliant on the HMD and controllers, who benefit from 
being top of the line devices.  
The key difference between a traditional and Morild VR simulator is how the user interacts 
with the bridge operating equipment. Everything is virtual in the VR simulator, which opens 
new options for customizing bridge equipment and layouts to individual vessel and propulsion 
system combinations. 
Characteristics and features of the Morild Ship & Bridge simulator 
It is important to mention that this simulator is still under development and is susceptible to 
future changes. This explanation gives insight into features of the simulator present in the 
version received for this specific master thesis and does not represent the final product of Morild 
Interaktiv AS’s product. 
Some of the elements in the Morild Ship & Bridge simulator are comprised of both input 
and output technologies, which are described below. 
The ‘helmsman’ function, which lets single-player and multi-player players to speak with 
an autonomous ‘helmsman’ through voice commands, allows them to direct the course, steering 
input, and throttle control of their vessels. ‘Linesman’ and ‘tugboat’ are two more voice-
activated functions that help to secure the vessel to quays and barges while also maneuvering 
the vessel with the use of tugboat orders. 
The simulator gives outstanding images that are based on data from terrain databases as well 
as infrastructure from OpenStreetMap and manual 3D modelling. Further the navigational aids 
and maritime infrastructure is partly sourced from NCAs databases. In addition, the user has 
the option of changing position to a predetermined position or moving freely over the bridge. 
Monitors like conning screens, ARPA radars, and fully updated ECDIS displays may all be 
utilized to keep a watch on the voyage. Panels may be made larger by selecting them and 
dragging them around. It is also feasible to communicate between boats in a functional manner 
using a simulated VHF radio.

Instructor control is either on the local host that portrays the VR, or a different computer the 
users are connected to. The multiplayer functionality is run over internet and users can be 
connected from anywhere. The instructor may view a relay of the users VR vision on the screen 
or observe the interaction on the ship bridge. The instructor may also alter meteorological 
elements such as the direction and strength of the wind and current.  
The instructors view has multiple functions ready for either an external instructor, or for the 
user themselves to modify the scenario in training situations. The different functions of the 
instructor’s view are shown and explained in Figure 8. The VR-simulator is still under 
development. Any functions shown in the figure may change in later versions. This is only 
shown as an introduction to the use of the simulator.

2.5 Training of personnel 
With continuous development of training in organizations, societies and industries, the way 
training is performed and can be performed has changed. If one analyzes the way training was 
researched in the past, it was most often done with the help of scientists in the field of 
psychology. Now the research done on training is also conducted by other industries. Especially 
computer scientists, industrial engineers and data analysts are researching training and how to 
improve output and efficiency of training systems. With development of new technology, such 
as VR and other simulations, the way training is conducted can be improved with less resources 
required. As training has evolved over the past decades, so has the definition of different 
subcategories (Salas & Cannon-Bowers, 2001).  
To measure training, effectiveness and evaluation has come up as the two terms describing 
it. A  literature review Salas and Cannon-Bowers (2001) conducted on the evolution of training 
science, established key factors that describe training. Where training effectiveness is 
determined by how the training it is adopted, positioned, and reinforced by the whole 
organization. Including the students' level of motivation and focus on the assigned tasks. The 
training evaluation is a closer measure of the achieved results and how they fit into the goal 
criteria of the training. This helps describe training in a more complex manner, as one can look 
at the preliminary organizational side, as well as the closer result side.  
The training program can be evaluated to evolve training in each organization. This is done 
to make the program better. It also establishes the transfer of knowledge leading to change in 
behavior and further showing results in the organization. This in turn demonstrates to the 
organization how valuable the training is (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016).

Kirkpatrick’s method of training evaluation 
The Kirkpatrick Model is a widely used method for assessing the effectiveness of training 
and education programs. It evaluates both formal and informal training methods, ranking them 
on four different levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 
2016; Smidt et al., 2009). Multiple published studies have critiqued the approach, focusing 
mostly on the layout of the levels, their relationship, and the fact that they may be positively 
associated (Reio et al., 2017). However, the method remains as a valid and frequently used 
training evaluation tool.  
The first level of criterion is "reaction," which assesses whether students found the training 
interesting, beneficial, and applicable to their work. An after-training survey that asks students 
to rate their experience is the most frequent way to assess this level, one can however extract 
this information thru interviews or other methods as well. A focus on the student rather than 
the trainer is an important part of Level 1 analysis. While it's normal for a facilitator to focus 
on the training outcome (such as content or learning environment), the Kirkpatrick Model 
prefers questions that focus on the learner's takeaways (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016). 
Level 2 assesses each participant's learning by determining whether they have acquired the 
desired knowledge, skills, attitude, confidence, and dedication to the course. Learning can be 
assessed in a variety of ways, both formal and informal, and should be assessed before and after 
learning to determine correctness and comprehension. Exams and interview-style evaluations 
are examples of assessment methods. To prevent inconsistencies, a specified, clear scoring 
process must be determined ahead of time (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016). 
Level 3 of the Kirkpatrick Model assesses if participants were actually impacted by the 
learning and are putting what they have learned into practice. Assessing behavioral changes 
allows you to determine not only whether the skills were understood, but also whether they are 
logistically feasible to utilize in the workplace. Examining conduct frequently reveals problems 
in the workplace. A lack of behavioral change may not indicate that training was ineffective, 
but rather that the organization's current processes and culture aren't conducive to the intended 
change (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016). 
The fourth level, Level 4, is devoted to determining direct outcomes. Level Four compares 
learning to an organization's business objectives, or the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that 
were set in place before learning began. Better return on investment, fewer workplace hazards, 
and a higher volume of sales are all common KPIs. The Kirkpatrick Model is used to establish 

 
Page 23 of 66 
an executable measuring plan that clearly defines goals, measures outcomes, and identifies 
areas of significant influence. Analyzing data at each level allows firms to examine the 
relationship between each level to better comprehend training results, as well as adapt plans 
and correct course during the learning process (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016).

Chapter 3.  Methodology and data analysis 
This chapter describes the research method applied in this thesis, the workflow, as well as 
the method of which the data collection and study has been performed. First the general 
methodology, and the timeline of the research is presented. Further the systematic literature 
review process is explained and presented. Additionally, the semi-structured interview 
methodology is presented. Lastly the research ethics taken into consideration are explained.  
3.1 General methodology description and research timeline 
General research methodology has been studied, and suiting methods were identified to fit 
the research questions. Qualitative data gathering was found to be the most suitable 
methodology for the data collection. Qualitative research is used in a variety of academic and 
professional fields. Qualitative research allows for knowledge acquisition in areas where more 
traditional research methods may be limited. Qualitative approaches allow individuals to 
express their thoughts, feelings, and reasons for their responses. The method of research enables 
researchers to investigate issues that would otherwise be constrained by sample size, 
experiment restrictions, data availability, and access (Yin, 2016, p. 6). Qualitative research 
approaches are ideal for studying implementation strategies and practices, since they describe 
the why and how (Sullivan & Sargeant, 2011). Purposive sampling is chosen as the sampling 
method because experts in their fields are more likely to provide detailed and nuanced 
information (Yin, 2016, pp. 93–94). Purposeful sampling is useful in cases where subjects’ 
expertise can provide knowledge on the research in question (Palinkas et al., 2015). The 
interview subjects are all persons who have had or have a maritime pilot certificate from the 
NCA. 
Under the qualitative research methodology branch, semi-structured interview and a 
systematic literature review were chosen as suitable. The different interview techniques such 
as structured, semi-structured and unstructured interviews were studied to determine what 
method would suit the research questions best. The nature of semi-structured interviews allows 
for information gathering with a structured approach, while being open for other inputs from 
interview subjects (Harrell & Bradley, 2009).  
The systematic literature review provides qualitative data in the form of findings previous 
research has concluded with. The systematic literature review allows for the collection of 
multiple points of research done in other industries, fields, and types of research. The result of 
conducting a systematic literature review is generally understood as setting the framework for 

 
Page 25 of 66 
research. However, it can also be used to establish a state-of-the-art knowledge and be a 
collection of qualitative data. As Denyer & Tranfield (2009, p. 671) described: 
“A systematic review should not be regarded as a literature review in the traditional sense, 
but as a self-contained research project in itself that explores a clearly specified question…”. 
The qualitative data from interviews and the structured literature review is supported by a 
mixed method approach with quantitative data provided by the NCA. The data provided by 
NCA strengthens the validity of the qualitative research conducted in the interviews and 
literature review. The data is based around a questionnaire sent out to participants of the VR-
simulator courses.  
The timeline of the thesis data collection can be seen in Figure 12. Through the NSD 
application, the research ethics were outlined, and the data collection procedures were designed. 
After the application got approved, the work with interview guides, demographic survey and 
organization of locations and dates commenced. The course that NCA held in Haugesund was 
for maritime pilots from the area around, with a collection of different pilot stations. The focus 
of the course was special tonnage scenarios such as large cruise vessels coming into narrow 
ports like Haugesund port. In Lødingen the focus was bulk and cruise vessels entering Narvik 
harbor.  
 
Figure 12 - Data gathering timeline 
The qualitative data is gathered on two occasions. Through correspondence with NCA’s 
thesis supervisor per e-mail, the collection of data is arranged on two occasions. The first VR-
simulator course NCA arranged for maritime pilots in Haugesund commenced from the 22nd to 
the 24th of March 2022. The second course occurred on the 19th and 20th of April 2022 in 
Lødingen pilot station close to Narvik. The data collection is different regarding the scenarios 
the maritime pilot’s test. However, due to the specificality of VR-simulators, and the subjects 
used in Haugesund, the knowledge gathered on both occasions is of high quality, meaning its 
useful for the general knowledge on implementation of the VR.

3.2 Systematic literature review process 
The literature used in the project has been sourced from multi-database search engines, such 
as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. The literature study is based on inclusions and 
exclusion criteria. With VR and VR-training being very general terms, used in many different 
approaches and areas, it is of importance to set specific search criteria to exclude fields of 
noninterest. In order to filter the publications found in the different databases, and identify their 
relevance to the thesis, some inclusion and exclusion criteria have been set. In Figure 13 the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented and listed. The criteria are selected to assure the 
relevancy, and quality of publications used in the thesis.  
 
Figure 13 - Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic literature review 
 
 After deciding on the criteria of inclusion and exclusion, the next step was to choose the 
databases and formulate the search strings. Search engine, search string, and results are 
presented in Table 3. Further the result of each iteration is presented. The literature search 
presented a total of 169 publications. After the first screening for the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, 152 publications remained. The first exclusion examined the publication's language, 
open-access status, and presence of a trial, case, or experiment. The second exclusion occurred 
after a content review of 152 articles. Some were rapidly rendered irrelevant, while others were 
difficult to classify. The inclusion and exclusion judgments followed the criteria. Following the 
reading and analysis of abstracts and the substance of the articles against the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, a total of 76 publications remained for the literature study.

3.3 Semi-structured interview process 
In preparation for the interviews, a demographic survey, interview guide and consent form 
were produced. The interview starts with a demographic survey where the interviewer is filling 
out a form shown in Appendix C to determine any special demographic points that may be 
relevant for the collection of data. After the demographic survey is finished, the recording is 
started, and the interview commences.  
Semi-structured interviews combine the benefits of both structured and unstructured 
interviews. In contrast to an unstructured interview, the interviewer knows what questions they 
will ask ahead of time. The phrasing and sequencing of the questions are not fixed, unlike in a 
structured interview. Interviews that are semi-structured are frequently open-ended, allowing 
for flexibility. It is easier to compare responses when you ask the same questions in the same 
order, but it can be restrictive. Less structure can aid in the detection of trends while still 
allowing for comparisons among responders (Kallio et al., 2016). 
The purpose of the interview is to allow the pilots to share their personal experiences with 
VR as well as their honest opinions on the technology. Given the nature of the semi-structured 
interview, it is essential that the person conducting it is competent in the field. This information 
was established as a result of the literature investigation and review that was undertaken prior 
to the primary and secondary data collecting. An extensive range of subjects and nuances must 
be covered in order to obtain the qualitative information required to achieve the project's goals. 
The semi-structured interview allows the pilots to give an opinion on fields that were not 
necessarily covered in the preparation for the interview, allowing for the identification of 
additional aspects that may be relevant to answering the research questions during the 
interview. The full interview guide can be seen in appendix B.

3.4 Data analysis 
Quantitative research employs a variety of data collection methods, as well as different types 
of data analysis. Interviewing and communicating with subjects enables the researchers to 
understand their body and verbal language in order to get information on their knowledge, 
beliefs, viewpoints, and recollections, among other things (Harrell & Bradley, 2009).  
The data was collected throughout the course. Participants who were present were given the 
opportunity to contribute to this thesis, by being interviewed. The maritime pilots had free time 
between scenarios and were willing to be interviewed. All of the interviews were conducted in 
a separate room, where only the participant and interviewer were present. The total number of 
interviews were 20. In Haugesund the number of participants were 16, and in Lødingen the 
number was 4. The reason for this difference is the total number of participants on the course, 
where the Haugesund course had a larger attendance. A total of 5 hours and 36 minutes of 
interviews were recorded. Total time of data collection was 5 days, with a further 4 days for 
transcribing and analyzing the data. 
The data transcription was accomplished by listening to the interviews and transcribing the 
participants' responses. No personal information was transcribed since the recording began after 
the demographic survey questions and concluded when the interview questions were 
satisfactorily completed. As the interviews were conducted in Norwegian, it was necessary to 
translate the responses. The interview transcripts span 40 pages and include close to 20,000 
words. They are not included in the thesis, but a non-identifiable version is available; to obtain 
it see Appendix E. The results of the interviews are provided in a summary format, together 
with selected quotes, and key findings.  
The quantitative data provided by the Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA) was 
collected by the course organizers of Haugesund, after the course had ended. The survey was 
performed with Questback3, and used for an internal evaluation of the course. The author of the 
thesis has only gained access to the results of this survey and cannot guarantee for its validity 
and reliability. However, it furthers the reliability of the data gathered in the interviews.

3.5 Research ethics 
This thesis follows The Norwegian National Committee for Research Ethics in Science and 
Technology’s’ (NENT) guidelines for ethical research practice. In order to follow guidelines 
and regulations regarding collection and handling of research data, an application process to 
notify the Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD) of the study has been conducted. 
Through the application process, several factors that ensure safe collection and handling of 
personal data were drafted. After their consideration of the study, with guarantees of safe data 
handling, anonymity and data collection methods, the research was accepted, and a permit was 
given to commence the study. The NSD approvement letter can be seen in its entirety in 
Appendix D.  
To give participants information about the research, and make an informed decision of 
participation, a consent form was created. In order to get approval from NSD for the research, 
the consent letter had to be sent in for consideration. The consent form includes information 
about the research, as well as a guarantee for the participant of anonymity and safe handling of 
the data collected. The semi-structured interview is started with informing the participants of 
the consent letter. Questions from the participants on the study, interview and data handling are 
answered and assured before signing. Further their voluntarily participation in the study is 
emphasized, and how they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. After the consent 
form has been signed, a number is assigned to it. The consent letter is then securely kept, and 
the interview recording begins. Following the interview, the audio file is stored with the number 
written on the consent form. This is done so that a connection may be established between 
consent and interview, allowing the participant to withdraw the data at any stage. 
The recordings were further saved on cloud services offered by UiT, The Arctic University 
of Norway, which were authorized and protected. The only person with access to the recordings 
and consent letters is the author of the thesis. As mentioned in the consent form, all recordings 
are erased when the thesis has been submitted and approved. 
Under the transcription of interviews, all identifying information is either eliminated or 
altered so as not to reveal personal details.

The findings show that most academics employ VR to boost student interest and motivation, 
and build their experience around constructivist teaching, cooperation, and gamification. 
Similarly, the research found that educational VR deployments are concentrated in a few 
key sectors. However, software usability issues, and limited familiarization time contributed to 
challenges for the students. The most significant challenge for output of training was reported 
to be the usability of software and hardware.  
Through VR training, involvement, immersion, and cooperation among all members of the 
team are improved (Fischer et al., 2021). The technology also increased the quality of 
instruction (Wong et al., 2020; Shibata, 2019). It is found that visual learners may benefit more 
from VR than non-visual learners. Due to the low resources needed to simulate dangerous 
operations, VR is found to have an advantage over other traditional ways of training (Morélot 
et al., 2021). Being immersed in an environment improves the learning output of the training 
(Smutny et al., 2019). The development in technology means VR is no longer constrained by 
location, time, size, safety, or expense (Young et al., 2020). A survey indicated that students 
prefer VR laboratories over briefing papers because they are more user-friendly and allow them 
to pick up new ideas more effective and rapidly (Hatchard et al., 2019). According to another 
study performed by Kariapper et al. (2021), students who used VR technology performed better 
than those who do not.  
In order to shift the emphasis of education away from a teacher and onto student’s 
experience, VR is an essential tool. With the use of VR technology, learning may be made more 
fun for students (Bashabsheh et al., 2019). In the case of VR technology being used to teach 
construction, there is minimal evidence that task complexity has an impact on how people learn 
(Wang et al., 2020). It is however found that having the ability to immerse oneself in a VR 
world is an effective learning tool (Bashabsheh et al., 2019). Pupils could also recall more if 
they have text annotations in VR explaining complex problems, environments or parts (Albus 
et al., 2021). This is further supported by a case study performed by Baceviciute et al., (2021), 
where reading in an embedded VR environment increased knowledge transfer, at the cost of 
increase in time and cognitive engagement.  
In a safety based education study performed by Luo et al., (2021) it was found that VR can 
both be used as a directive and indirective learning tool. With 150 participants in the study, it 
was found that debriefing groups after VR training increased knowledge acquisition. Further 
debriefing in VR also resulted in improved behavioral performance. Being able to observe 
another in the Virtual Environment or consequent visualization resulted in an increase in 

 
Page 39 of 66 
training effectiveness. These findings correspond with other studies on classroom management 
and student to teacher interaction (Seufert et al., 2022; Herbert et al., 2018). Contrary another 
study with less participants conducted by Makransky et al., (2019) on laboratory settings 
showed an increase in student engagement, but reported less learning with higher cognitive 
loads.  
The immersive experience of VR is linked to more effective knowledge retention, as well as 
higher test scores (Calvert & Abadia, 2020). As long as the digital environment is as close to 
the authentic real-life experience, the training output is higher for groups training with VR 
compared to more conventional methods like classroom teaching, 2D video lectures and 3D 
object analysis. The immersive experience suits participants with a high level of 3D 
visualization skills particularly (Krüger et al., 2022; Carrion et al., 2021; Hallberg et al., 2020; 
Meyer et al., 2019). Further VR training is linked to higher motivation and eagerness to learn 
(Cheng & Tsai, 2019). A study conducted by Guo et al., (2021) on high school students who 
experience VR training, and the problems following it, reported on students having fear of a 
VR world so lifelike it could be mistaken for real life. The study also mentioned the students 
boost in enthusiasm for training with VR HMD’s. Another study reported that even with 
students never having seen or used a VR simulation before, they see its potential in connecting 
theory and practice. However, students were afraid the VR system may be too expensive and 
teachers knowledge on the systems were too limited to assist students properly (Harinarain, 
2020). 
In high-risk industries such as construction, process and manufacturing, studies show that 
VR increased awareness in training. For professions with high requirements of good 
understandings of material properties and spatial relationships, VR proved especially useful. 
With the increase in spatial awareness, the problem-solving skills of students were measured 
(Eiris et al., 2021). The increase in situational awareness is closely linked to increase in safety, 
as well as more efficient decision making for construction (Wolf et al., 2022; Isleyen & Duzgun, 
2019). Further the learning data can be used to analyze and refine training methods, in order to 
develop new expertise on how to train in these fields (Garcia Fracaro et al., 2021). The 
effectiveness of the training is however dependent on some student preparation and task 
knowledge, where reportedly more experiences participants have higher outcome from the 
training (Ozcan-Deniz, 2019). The assessment of VR-training is also dependent on unique 
methodology often linked with mathematical models (Kumar et al., 2021).  

 
Page 40 of 66 
Maritime industries are also a high-risk industry, and the education and training of future 
maritime personnel is crucial to safe operations. In a literature and case study of VR training 
for the Maritime Academy of Asia and the Pacific, conducted by Buenaobra et al., (2018), VR 
showed multiple advantages. The VR case study showed how the group trained with HMD’s 
performed twice as well as the group that did not. Further the engrossed and immersed nature 
of the learning setting increased the students learning. The increased excitement of training in 
VR was also considered to improve the knowledge retention of students in MET.  
The field of healthcare education and training has been the industry and sector which has 
implemented VR technologies the furthest. The majority of studies done on VR training is 
conducted in the healthcare sector. With large quantities of participants in the studies, they have 
large value for other industries as well as the data validity is high. Multiple trial studies with a 
combined number of more than 2300 participants trained, tested, familiarized, or learned with 
VR technologies. Many of these participants were doctors, surgeons, nurses, medical students 
and nursing students. Studies reported on greater training motivation and excitement for the 
participants (Botha et al., 2021; Bracq et al., 2021; Breitkreuz et al., 2021; Lesch et al., 2020; 
Kaphingst et al., 2009). The training output is higher in groups training in VR or in combination 
with VR than groups who do not (Al-Saud et al., 2017; Blumstein et al., 2020; Botha et al., 
2021; Cai et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; Han et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2020; Issleib et al., 2021; 
Jokinen et al., 2020; Liaw et al., 2020; Mansoory et al., 2021; Nas et al., 2021; Orland et al., 
2020; Raison et al., 2021; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2020; Tolsgaard et al., 2015; Umoren et al., 
2021; B. Zhang et al., 2020; J. Zhang et al., 2021). While these studies showed large advantages 
of VR training, other studies were not as clear in the advantage of VR-simulation. These studies 
often concluded with the potential that lies within VR training if the software and hardware is 
further developed (Bartlett et al., 2017; Djukic et al., 2013; Harrington et al., 2018; Huri et al., 
2021; Jacobsen et al., 2022; Larsen et al., 2009; Liaw et al., 2019; Oulefki et al., 2022; 
Yoganathan et al., 2018; Zinchenko et al., 2020). In some areas of healthcare, studies had mixed 
results, with some not being able to prove the effectiveness of VR in a clinical methodology 
(Aeckersberg et al., 2019; Nilsson et al., 2017). 
In a trauma decision-making simulator study performed by Harrington et al., (2018), the VR 
induced symptoms of sickness were limited, and were explained to the stationary nature of the 
interactions. This is in line with other studies performed on the VR sickness phenomenon. A 
controlled study on VR Induced symptoms and effects, conducted by Sharples et al, (2008) 
conducted a VR-simulator on 71 civilian participants. The comparison was done on the same 

 
Page 41 of 66 
VR environment, but different technologies were used: HMD, desktop, standard projection 
screen and Reality Theatre. The examination measured high levels of symptoms in the HMD, 
reality theatre and projection screen groups, compared to desktop groups. The clearest increase 
in symptoms of nausea, disorientation, and oculomotor were seen in the HMD group. Studies 
also mention the importance of small head movements, and low latency of interaction to reduce 
the symptoms of VR-sickness (Servotte et al., 2020; Sharples et al., 2008). Further the exposure 
time, rotation and acceleration of movements influence the risk of VR-sickness (Porcino et al., 
2022).

4.2 Results from the semi-structured interviews 
Interviews were conducted under a VR-simulation course in Haugesund from 22nd to 24th of 
March 2022, as well as a VR-simulation course in Lødingen from the 19th and 20th of April 
2022. A total of 20 interviews were conducted on consenting participants, with a total of 5 hours 
recorded interview time. Research time used to attain these results are approximately 80 hours, 
including transcription of the interviews. The interviews are presented in a summarized format, 
with some translated quotes. The full interview transcripts can be requested, see Appendix E. 
Challenges encountered in conventional simulator setups 
Multiple candidates reported on the issue of reliability and training continuity. They reported 
of never having been in a traditional simulator that did not have some form of technical issue 
that resulted in lengthier periods of downtime due to restarts. Further, when visiting a simulator 
center, even if it is outside of the nation, the database for the locations in which the candidates 
regularly operate are not available. Consequently, a lot of time and effort is spent getting to 
know the region, which limits the time and effort available to train the important moments. 
Since the pilots are acquainted with a given area of operation, training will be less successful if 
one cannot imitate it, candidates explained. You cannot obtain good visuals and graphics while 
training on maneuvering vessels others mentioned. This means that from the bridge wing, it is 
hard to get a solid idea of how it'd appear in real life. This is particularly critical while working 
in tight harbors or narrow waters. Some simulators contain a tiny display that shows an 
overhead perspective of the ship, but nothing more. This is a significant issue and disadvantage 
of traditional simulators, perceived by some candidates.  
 
Figure 14 – Key findings on challenges in conventional simulators reported in interviews 
 
• Reliability and training continuity.
• Technical issues and downtime.
• Slow progress in training.
• Lack of simulated areas which the pilots operate in daily.
• Difficult to get good visual imagery of familiar areas.
• Limited ability to move the viewpoint on the bridge for manoeuvring.
• Having to travel to a simulator centre.

Where could VR-simulators be used in pilots’ work? 
Numerous interview subjects reported on the ability to use the VR simulator as a low effort 
training device in their daily work. “With the sizes of vessels, we are piloting into ports, being 
able to model poor weather situations with limited resources allows us to establish operating 
limitations, examine new options, and gauge our comfort in various operations.” One of the 
candidates explained. “The simulator can help us figure out how to design the procedure. The 
VR can establish a theoretical reference point for how we would be able to execute the 
operation, and once we're on board, we'll be able to get a feel for the vessel and see whether 
it's capable of performing our theoretical reference point.” Another added separately. A more 
skeptical candidate mentioned how he “… can't see myself practicing for an operation in VR 
for a week and then doing the exact same procedure flawlessly the following week using just 
the simulator's instruction and expertise.”, while he added that “It can, however, give me a fair 
idea of how the operation will proceed. It provides me with a helpful tip.”. 
The “helmsman” function of the simulator was also commented on. One candidate 
mentioned how this tool enabled realistic training in operating ships only via voice orders. He 
also joked on the realism, as the computer did not always pick up what he was saying, like the 
crew in real life. The mobility of the simulator was further brought up as a daily advantage. 
One of the participants mentioned the ability to take the simulator with him on vessel trips and 
being able to visualize and simulate operations further ahead in time. Here the crew of the vessel 
could also be in the loop of how the operation may feel and look.  
Multiple candidates mentioned the ability to simulate operations that seldom or rarely are 
performed. Specialized vessels such as Oilrigs, cruise vessels and other operations that deviate 
from the normal could be simulated in the VR-platform at the base. The benefit of having the 
simulator ready and mobile whenever a special operation or mission came up, was brought up 
as the most impactful for everyday work.  

 
Page 44 of 66 
 
Figure 15 – Key findings on possible VR-simulator usage 
Is there a specific operation phase where VR-training may be useful? 
The candidates mostly mentioned the ability to simulate passage through narrow waterways, 
and transit from boarding position to the harbor as the most beneficial operations to simulate. 
Multiple pilots believed the VR simulator could do a good job of simulating all phases of 
operation. However, some did not see it being heavily utilized for the final fine-tuned maneuver 
to the quay. Training on cruise ships entering the harbor or container ships turning around in 
the harbor basin with strong wind forces could be extremely beneficial, many of them reported. 
One participant mentioned that in regard to operating a very large vessel through a narrow area 
with bad weather, “Personally, I believe that I would have preferred to operate these vessels in 
a few practice runs in the virtual reality simulator prior to embarking on the real thing.” 
Participants from Lødingen and Narvik pilot station reported on some lack of realism 
regarding the maneuvering inside the harbor basin, due to the challenging current conditions 
located in the area. Moreover, most of them regarded the simulator as a great tool for training 
the operational phase of maneuvering the vessel to quay if the hydrodynamic circumstances 
improved.

useful. 
• As a low effort training device in their daily work.
• Designing procedures of operation.
• Examining and determining operational boundaries.
• Simulate rare and special operations and missions.

commands.
• Mobility of system provides possibility for pilot to take it onboard vessels
on long journeys to discuss upcoming operations with crew.

How did the simulator feel to operate? 
The majority of subjects reported no serious symptoms or discomforts using the simulator. 
The main feedback in the interviews on the operability of the simulator was on three different 
parameters. The comfort in use of the simulator, derived into input and output of controls and 
visuals, as well as the effect on the participants comfort level and tiredness.  
The functions of multi-player with helmsman, captain and pilot positions were found to be 
realistic enough for many of the pilots. One candidate highlighted the need for realism in how 
it feels to operate “It is critical that the simulator feels authentic. Without realism, training 
loses its focus, rendering the entire session ineffective. As a result, I'm relieved that it feels 
realistic to operate. I believe the simulator is capable of creating an environment in which I am 
familiar with the tools, such as ECDIS and radar, and the ability to move around is excellent. 
I mostly used the radar and looked out the window to control my position." They mostly felt 
the operation in the simulator felt authentic to real life.  
On the input side the controllers required some familiarization. Participants reported on 
different levels of difficulty when familiarizing oneself with the controls. Some reported 2-3 
minutes, while others continuously felt the need to use energy on the controls. However, all of 
the participants reported on improvement of input feeling over the timeframe of the course. One 
participant explained: “It is critical to be familiar with this because it will divert your attention 
away from the actual navigation and maneuvering if you are only concerned with what buttons 
to press. However, I believe it was easier to become acquainted with than I anticipated.”. 
Another participant complained on the controls, as he felt the need to focus on what buttons to 
push was slightly high.  
The output of the simulator was regarded as quite impressive. Participants found that the 
initial scenarios they tried were not as sharp, but with adjusting the HMD in the next scenarios 
they felt increase in visual satisfaction. Most of the participants reported no symptoms of nausea 
or sickness. However multiple pilots argued the fact that they felt tired and exhausted in the 
eyes after being in the simulator for a long time, upwards of one and a half hour. One participant 
explained that the immersive experience and enjoyment of using the simulator distracted him 
from the fact that it was tiring, and that the feeling of fatigue showed at the end of the day. 
Sitting down during the scenario was brought up as one of the factors which proved to reduce 
nausea.

Figure 17 - Key findings on how the simulator felt to operate. 
Was the training effective, and worth your time? 
A frequent answer on the effectiveness of the simulator was how well VR-simulation used 
the available time. This was brought up as the most advantageous feature of this simulator in 
comparison to others. Being immediately placed in the situation or scenario, and tasked to 
complete it, was reported as remarkably effective. Reportedly the VR-simulator was able to 
immediately train what you want to train. “Whether used alone, in a group, or in a large room, 
it is quick and simple to use.” Was one participant comment. Observing the other participants 
was also brought up as beneficial. “It becomes clear that when I am not in the simulator, my 
time is not wasted by simply waiting, as I am able to observe how more experienced pilots 
operate the simulator. Observing the instructor's screen and completing the tasks adds another 
dimension to training and helps to create an effective learning environment.” one pilot 
mentioned.  
On questions about training output from the pilots, a general answer was often that one does 
not learn to navigate all over, but pilots add to existing knowledge. “I have the impression that 
I have a training output. Of course, I do not learn anything completely new, but I do gain a 
little more knowledge.”. Others reported on low expectations and assumed they would be 
incapable of operating and comprehending the simulator, but many found it to be productive. 
Additionally, some reported that an improved ability to use this type of technology, was 
beneficial and thus the time was well spent.  
One pilot mentioned he did not feel a significant difference in training output when 
compared to conventional methods, but reported it was significantly easier and more convenient 
• Multi-player bridge environment was well perceived.
• Realistic communication environment, including use of ‘Helmsman’
function.
• Many felt the experience being very close to the real thing.
• All required some time to familiarize oneself with controls.
• Some focus of the navigation is taken away by concentrating on which
buttons to operate.
• Thorough adjustment of HMD was found to be crucial for participants
perception of the visual quality.
• Some tiredness and fatigue after upwards of 1 hours continuous
simulation.
• The majority of participants reported no symptoms, even after long
scenario duration (2+ hours)

when using the VR simulator. Other participants felt that the simulator provided a more 
effective and higher quality training than conventional simulators. “Because we are already 
familiar with the operation, the simulator enables us to use the simulator in the context of our 
experience, to set constraints and test alternative solutions. It was an effective training session, 
in my opinion.” One participant mentioned.  
 
Figure 18 - Key findings from interviews on the effectiveness of the VR-Simulator. 
Was the visual sensation satisfactory? 
The maritime pilots were impressed by the visual quality of the simulator. The participants 
mentioned the need for good visuals, in order to use landmarks and local reference points for 
navigation. Reportedly many of the local reference points and landmarks were available and 
correct for the pilots to use. The visuals were also pointed out to be superior to conventional 
simulators, as the participant could move the view around, felt more immersed and were able 
to change bridge position how they wanted. The ability to stand up and view the side of the 
vessel from the bridge wing was also used.  
 
Figure 19 - Key findings on the visual and graphic sensations. 
• The simulator was perceived as very time efficient.
• Observing other participants from the instructor was reported as a
effective way of learning.
• Many pointed out that one did not learn new skills, but could rather use

How did the vessel interaction feel and respond? 
On the vessel control questions of the interview the participants responded with mixed 
answers. Some felt the simulator was realistic regarding vessel handling, and a distinction 
between the Haugesund collection compared to the Lødingen collection was clear. The 
Haugesund participants mostly used refined models of a cruise vessel and a tanker. The 
respondents found the vessel to respond like they would anticipate. In Lødingen however, the 
participants maneuvered a relatively new model in the simulator. The bulk vessel they operated 
seemed to have some mismatched parameters and the pilots were not satisfied with the realism 
of the vessel.  
 
Figure 20 - Key findings on interaction and response from vessels. 
 
VR-simulator in the education of maritime pilots. 
Most of the pilots were explicit in their support of the simulator in the education of maritime 
pilots. There was a difference in meaning for what section of the training the simulator could 
be used, however. Some said the ability to visualize the areas in great detail, allowed fresh pilot 
students to simulate and train on the ‘Loslekse’ mentioned in chapter 2.2. With the availability 
of the specific areas of pilot operation, training in these environments could allow for faster 
knowledge retention of the area some argued. Others felt that the simulator would be best used 
in a later stage of the education, or even after the pilotage exam was passed. To get pilots with 
smaller certificates to get a feel for large tonnage operations, the VR simulator could be used 
as a low resource training tool.  
• Participants operating refined models in the simulator reported realistic
controls
• Participants operating newly developed models reported a lack of realism
regarding external forces.
• The characteristics of the models was found to be crucial to how realistic

Chapter 5. Discussion 
This chapter aims to discuss and link together the results from the research methods used. 
To determine if the research aim is met, and the results are valid, the research methodology is 
analyzed. Further, the common findings in the systematic literature review are linked with the 
findings found in the data gathered from interviews.  
5.1 Research methodology discussion 
The qualitative methods chosen for the research had its benefits and drawbacks. Using the 
literature review as a method for gathering qualitative data suited the thesis well by identifying 
factors and parameters relevant for VR-simulator implementation. The drawback of the method 
was that relevant literature that was not covered by the inclusion criteria, had to be disregarded 
for the specific data gathering. Multiple studies were excluded due to them being reviews of 
previously performed research, thus excluding well documented findings. However, many of 
the original sources for these literature reviews, were covered as they appeared in the search 
results of the systematic literature review performed.  
The semi-systematic interview was beneficial for gathering information from the maritime 
pilots. The purposeful sampling of participants was a success, and necessary in order to 
determine the knowledge retention and effectiveness of the training. Further, their specific 
knowledge of becoming a maritime pilot contributed to valid data on the potential of VR-
simulators in training of new pilots. As data saturation became apparent relatively quickly, on 
some questions, it was clear that the semi-systematic nature of the interview was beneficial. 
This interview method then allowed for the interview to divert to themes the pilot wished to 
contribute their knowledge on, while still staying in the field. One can argue that the data 
saturation point being as early as 6-7 interviews on some questions, meant that the interview 
questions were not as open as one would wish. However, with the specific nature of the VR-
simulator implementation, as well as the similar experience of the pilots, the saturation point 
came as quickly as expected. While the data saturation point was research quickly, it does not 
invalidate the data from each pilot.  
The data gathered in this thesis has high validity, and the findings can be generalized to other 
organizations. Since the maritime pilots can be counted as experts in the maritime field of 
navigation, ship-handling and maneuvering, the data collected is valuable. Since the total 
number of interviews far exceeded the expected number, the dataset is representative for the 
maritime pilot’s opinion of the VR-simulator. Under the interviews it became apparent that 

 
Page 51 of 66 
some of the participants believed that their answer would disagree with the majority of maritime 
pilots, however, the pilots mostly mentioned the same positive and negative points. This 
arguments for the validity of data gathered from the interview, as they did not coerce each other 
into answering in specific directions. This highlights the benefit of interviewing each 
participant individually, and away from other participants.  
The validity of the interviews is further supported by the internal survey performed by the 
NCA. The average scores on each question resemble and support the results from the 
interviews. Findings in the interview data is linked closely to the key findings from the literature 
review, further supporting the validity of the results.  
5.2 Linking the literature review and interview data 
The systematic literature review identified that in the field of education the use of VR-
simulation resulted in higher training motivation, effectiveness, and knowledge retention. This 
is further supported by the interview conducted with maritime pilots. Firstly, most of the pilots 
participating in the study had never used any type of VR-simulator. Some mentioned on the 
fact that they had never used any type of gamified computer hardware or software and were 
relatively skeptical to the system. However, after using the VR-simulator for some time, the 
participants were impressed by the performance, especially the visuals the simulator provided. 
However, the task of controlling the simulator was a more diverse result, where there were 
some mixed feedbacks in the interviews. This is also mentioned in multiple studies regarding 
education with VR-simulators. To be able to control the simulator effectively, there was a 
familiarization period needed. The interviewees were clear on how a familiarization period 
before entering a real scenario helped them perform better. When comparing between VR-
simulators and conventional simulators, some advantages were identified.  
Advantages of the VR-simulator  
The interview subjects highlighted the usability and easiness of the simulator as one of its 
largest advantages. For the maritime pilots to train in conventional simulators, they would have 
to travel to a location with an existing simulator, as well as consume financial and time 
resources to train. They argued that the mobility, cost, and low-effort nature of the simulator 
provided good training opportunities in the area they were located. This key advantage is 
identified and further supported by previous research conducted on VR-simulator training.  
Some literature showed increased knowledge retention if students have text annotations in 
displayed in the virtual world. On this point many of the maritime pilots pointed out how the 

 
Page 52 of 66 
simulator can be used in the education of new pilot cadets. Where mountains, landmarks, 
navigational marks etc. could be annotated or highlighted to show the simulated location and 
teach the student the ‘loslekse’ as a supplement. On the other side, this may increase the 
cognitive load of the users in the scenario. However, one study argued for how the learning was 
more effective but came at the cost of increase in training time, and cognitive engagement.  
Use and design of the VR-simulator scenarios  
With the maritime pilots being able to recognize the area, their situation awareness 
increased, and they performed better in the scenarios, multiple participants reported. This is 
further supported in the literature review, where it is found that VR-simulators are especially 
useful for training for operation where spatial, and environment awareness is important.  
Debriefing students after performing a VR-simulator task resulted in increased knowledge 
acquisition. This is supported by feedback from some of the pilots, where they mention how 
the cooperative nature of the simulator, as well as being able to overview the scenario from the 
instructor screen, made it possible to catch details in how more experienced pilots operated the 
vessel. This was especially introduced as an effective means of learning larger tonnage vessels, 
for pilots who did not have the large tonnage certificates required for these areas.  
The literature also found that if the digital environment simulated is as close to real life as 
possible, the training output can even be increased in comparison to more traditional teaching 
methods such as classroom lectures, informative videos, and object analysis. Likewise, the 
maritime pilots reported on high learning efficiency due to the visual quality of the image, and 
its resemblance of the real world. All the pilots reported on being familiar in areas, and 
recognizing local landmarks, buildings, mountains, and other reference points they had 
acquired over the years.  
The field where VR-simulators are most researched and implemented is healthcare. These 
studies also conclude with increased training motivation, excitement, and training output. 
However, one is not able to necessarily generalize these findings and project them onto MET. 
Moreover, the VR-simulators used in healthcare are often very task specific, where training on 
one special procedure is simulated. Students in these healthcare simulators have to encounter 
unforeseen changes in the virtual patient’s condition, and adequately react. This can be 
generalized and compared to the operation of ships. Whereas a surgeon is continuously 
watching and monitoring the vital parameters of a patient, this also applies for maritime pilots, 
where monitoring the position, navigation, and operation of the vessel, while anticipating the 

 
Page 53 of 66 
coming maneuvers, is a key factor of their work. The effectiveness of the VR-simulator shown 
in the healthcare fields, may provide an argument for why VR-simulation can be useful for the 
pilots. Since controlled, specific scenarios are best trained with the VR-simulator, this also fits 
into how the maritime pilots can design their scenarios. Shorter scenarios through narrow 
passages, docking operations or maneuvering are all suitable for the VR-simulator. 
Other scenarios may be specialized situations such as oilrig moves, or other operations the 
maritime pilots seldomly perform. This was brought up by many pilots in the interviews, as 
they found the potential for the simulator to be highlighted most with being able to simulate 
special operations before they do the mission.  
VR-sickness, immersion, and fidelity 
On VR-simulation induced symptoms and VR-sickness, there were some astounding 
findings. While previous research mostly recommends limiting the symptoms of VR-sickness, 
by having scenarios limited to 20 minutes, this was consequently different in the VR-simulation 
course run in Haugesund and Lødingen. While some participants reported on minor cases of 
headache, dizziness, or fatigue, the majority felt fine after being in the simulator. The special 
thing with these courses, was the duration of the scenarios, where participants were immersed 
in the VR-simulator for one to two hours at a time. In the most extreme cases the participants 
were in the environment for more than three hours. Surprisingly, no major sickness was 
reported, except some tiredness in the eyes from wearing the HMD. A suspected cause for this 
severe lack of VR-sickness is the quality of the technology. In studies conducted on the causes 
for VR-sickness, it is determined how the latency, visual quality, framerate, and other technical 
factors all contribute to VR-sickness. With the simulator being as optimized as it is, running on 
last-gen HMDs with high resolution and powerful laptops, the movements of the participants 
did cohere with the view and control of the simulator. Some participants even reported on the 
feeling of being so immersed that they wanted to lean on walls present in the virtual 
environment, but not in the physical environment they sat in. Another argument for why they 
were able to operate the simulators with little symptoms of VR-sickness, is thought to be the 
fact that most of the time they sat still on a chair. Some of the participants stood up in order to 
get a better view of the maneuvering operation and mentioned how they became more unstable 
and dizzier. However, this was only reported by a few participants. The theory of participants 
not experiencing symptoms while being stationary in a chair is further supported by studies 
performed.

Training evaluation  
The advantages the simulator provides for the maritime pilots, enables for repetitive multi-
scenario training. The mobility and ease of use of the system can also allow for pilots to train 
at home, take it with them on a vessel, in the pilot station, as well as in group settings to discuss 
different solutions and options. From the interview results, the simulator can provide a tool for 
both new and experienced maritime pilots, to train for further upgrades of their certificate. 
Especially the new maritime pilots, who are experienced mariners, who must learn the 
‘Loslekse’, are able to familiarize themselves with the area using the VR-simulator. As the 
education to become a certified maritime pilot is busy, time consuming and strict, newly 
educated participants emphasized the importance of not removing any of the education but use 
it as a supplement to the existing training. More specifically, the introduction phase of the 
training was argued to be well suited for familiarization of the area in VR-training. Further, 
more experienced maritime pilots can get familiar with large tonnage vessels, or special purpose 
vessels, in scenarios seldomly conducted. The possibility for further usage is also available. 
Losforskriften mentions familiarization and minimum number of voyages may be done in 
simulators. If the simulator is classified correctly, the familiarization of areas can even be 
accepted as a certified training option. However, the maritime pilots argued strongly against 
substituting any real-world experience gathering in favor of simulator usage of any kind. They 
were adamant of keeping the simulator as a supplement to the existing training, and not 
introduce it as a replacement.  
Using the four training assessment levels, one might claim that the VR-simulator 
implementation is in its early phases. The levels indicate the success of training within the 
organization, and while the VR-simulator is only beginning to be used by the NCA, it has been 
accepted. The "response" level of Kirkpatrick's model for evaluating training provides distinct 
answers. With the good responses from marine pilots, the first level 1 assessment is positive. 
The potential of the technology is elucidated, and marine pilots responded favorably to inquiries 
about the simulator's future in their training. 
Level 2 of Kirkpatrick's training model examines whether or not the pilots have acquired 
adequate knowledge and skills via training. Efficiency in time utilization and training output 
were highlighted as significant elements in the interview replies on the training output. 
Levels 3 and 4 of Kirkpatrick's evaluation of training cannot be addressed in this thesis. Due 
to the research's constraints about the early adoption of the technology, it is currently not able 

 
Page 55 of 66 
to quantify the impact on the organization. However, some pilots said that the information 
gained in the training prompted them to consider future decisions. This suggests that 
Kirkpatrick's training assessment for level 3 might be tested relatively soon. With level 4 
evaluating direct training results, this would be an excellent topic for future research. Future 
research on the effect of introducing the VR-simulator into an organization such as the NCA 
Pilot Service would be advantageous for MET, despite the fact that evaluating the benefit of 
VR-training vs traditional simulator training may present some challenges.

Chapter 6. Conclusion & further work 
This chapter concludes the research performed. It revisits the research questions defined in 
the beginning of the thesis and suggests future work in the field. The study performed has 
contributed to the field of VR-training, as well as VR-simulator usage in the field of MET. The 
study has provided advantages and limitations on the implementation of VR-simulators in an 
early stage in the NCA. Further, it tries to fill the research gap on implementation of VR-
simulator in the field of MET. As other industries and fields such as healthcare and education 
have extensive previous research on VR-simulators, this thesis provides an addition to the 
maritime industry. It also indicates if the VR-simulator is beneficial for the training of maritime 
pilot in the NCA.  
To determine in what capacity the VR-simulator can be implemented into the training of 
maritime pilot’s daily work, this study has used different methods of qualitative data gathering. 
The systematic literature review has identified, read and analyzed a total of 76 publications, 
across multiple fields. It is important to determine the common findings between the different 
industries and fields of research, in order to generalize the findings and contribute to the field. 
The previous case, trail or experiment research performed on VR-simulators mostly center 
around industries that are not maritime industry related. Therefore, this thesis contributes to 
both the Maritime Education and Training field, as well as Virtual Reality (VR) simulation 
research.   
The simulator's benefits for maritime pilots allow for repeated training in multiple scenarios. 
The system's portability and user-friendliness enable pilots to train at home, aboard a vessel, in 
the pilot station, and in group settings to discuss various solutions and options. Based on the 
results of the interviews, the simulator can be used to train both new and experienced maritime 
pilots on new operations, larger tonnage and new areas.  
The simulator was viewed as a groundbreaking technology and provided the participants 
with excellent training outcomes. The majority of responses were favorable to the 
implementation of VR-simulators in the Norwegian maritime pilot organization. However, it 
was emphasized that the VR-simulator should not be used in place of existential training, but 
rather as a supplement. The advantages of training identified correspond to the findings from 
the systematic literature review, and further correspond to the anonymous survey conducted by 
the NCA.

6.1 Revisiting the research questions 
1. Is the Virtual Reality training useful in the competence development process of 
Norwegian maritime pilots? 
• The maritime pilots who participated in the VR-simulator courses were pleased with the 
training output and cited its efficiency, usability, portability, and immersion as key 
success factors. This is supported by previous research on training in VR-simulators 
conducted in other fields. The simulator was regarded as an excellent training tool for 
both novice pilots seeking familiarization experience and seasoned pilots desiring to 
train. It can be concluded that the VR-simulator is useful in the competence development 
of maritime pilots. Per the maritime pilots opinions, the simulator is not considered to be 
a replacement for other simulator training, or real-life training onboard operational 
vessels.  
2. How can the Virtual Reality simulators improve training outcomes of today’s 
maritime pilot education? 
• The VR-simulator can make simulator training less resource-intensive. It can provide 
simple, quick, mobile, and efficient training for maritime pilots. The high level of fidelity 
and immersion both in operation with voice commands, and visual input, provide a high 
level of realism for pilots going through the educational course. It can further be used as 
a training tool prior to advanced, unusual, or difficult missions. The ability for pilots to 
share their experiences with one another via the visualization of group choices may also 
enhance training results. The simple functionality of the simulator allows users to 
practice in their chosen settings. Due to the specialized nature of their vocation and the 
intense nature of the training period, it is evident that maritime pilots do not want the 
simulator to supplant or replace any real-world scenario training onboard vessels. The 
simulator may preferably be used in the introduction and familiarization to the maritime 
pilot role, with maneuvering with voice commands, as well as getting to know the 
operational area.  
6.2 Future work 
Numerous investigations might be conducted in the wake of this thesis to further the 
understanding of VR-simulators in the MET research sector. A direct follow-up study may 
consist of collecting data on the simulator's use over time and analyzing it based on 
Kirkpatrick's levels 3 and 4 of training assessment. Additionally, in a controlled study, a 
comparison between the VR-simulator and more standard simulator setups may be conducted.
