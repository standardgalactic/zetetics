ABSTRACT 
The set of all infinite-volume equilibrium (Gibbs) states is constructed for the Curie— 
Weiss version of the random-field Ising model. It turns out that these states are random: 
they are governed by parameters with non-degenerate distributions. 
The correspon-
ding observables (like magnetization) are also random, but with simple discrete distri-
bution. This generalized self-averaging property will be called conditional (or partial) 
self-averaging. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this contribution is to construct and describe the set of infinite-
volume equilibrium states (limiting Gibbs measures) for the Curie—Weiss version 
of the random field Ising model (RFIM). 
The Curie—Weiss RFIM has been studied from different points of view (Angelescu 
and Zagrebnov, 1985; 1986; Salinas and Wreszinski, 1985) including the problem 
of fluctuations (Amaro de Matos and Perez, 1989), but as far as we know, no 
complete constructive description of all its equilibrium states exists. In order to 
fill this gap, we propose in Section 2 a general line of reasoning to define and 
describe the limiting Gibbs measures for the Curie—Weiss RFIM. According to 
our arguments (see Sections 2 and 3) the limiting state will in general depend on 
random parameters defined in a probability space (X, A, p), to be specified later. 
Here it has to be stressed that the proof of our main theorem will be based on a 
careful analysis (Amaro de Matos and Perez, 1989) of the fluctuations of the free 
energy. 
For the explicit case of the Curie—Weiss RFIM it turns out that the limiting Gibbs 
states are random measures with non-degenerate distributions. 
Let us recall what the general understanding of self-averaging is related to. In a 
finite-volume the free energy density is a random, variable depending on the exter-
nal field configurations. In the infinite-volume limit, it converges to a 
non-random,

value defined only by the probability distribution of this field. In other words, 
one could say that this limit is a random variable with degenerate distribution, 
i.e., with a probability density with support in one point (an atomic distribution 
with one atom). 
Definition 1.1. Let {0„}„> 1 be a sequence of random variables defined on a 
probability space (1Z, T, A) and <f> be a random variable defined on a probability 
space (TV, J7', A'). We say that this sequence is partially self-averaging if: 
(i) <t>n~*4> in distribution as n —• oo; 
(ii) there exists a partition Vj, = {D\, D2i • • •} of 72.', generated by the random 
variable <j>, which is finite, i.e., 
k 
€ ft') = 
1=1 
k 
where Id(-) is the indicator of D and U DI = TV. 
»=i 
If k = 1 and 1Z = TV, then one gets the standard self-averaging. In this case 
the ¿-convergence in (i) is equivalent to the convergence in probability (Shiryaev, 
1984) and, moreover, one can often prove the convergence with probability 1 (see 
e.g., (Pastur, 1980)). 
Remark 1.1. The above Definition 1.1 is equivalent to the following construction. 
There exists a sequence of finite partitions {T>„ = {.D-n^}*=1}n>1 of the space TZ 
such that for the conditional expectations {M(<^„ | 2?n}n>i we have convergence 
in probability 
lim (<f>„ - M(4>n | V n j ) = 0 
n—»oo 
and lim A(D-n)) = A '(DI), for each i = 1,2,..., k. Therefore we call this property 
n—*oo 
of the sequence {<^n}n>i > the conditional self-averaging. 
In Section 4 a general quasi-average approach is developed to single out the pure 
states and their convex linear combinations. Section 5 is devoted to examples 
and concluding remarks. We show there that for some range of parameters the 
magnetization of RFIM in the field {/i,}igz is conditionally self-averaging (but 
not self-averaging) in the thermodynamic limit A f Z with the partitions T>„ = 
= {^ n ),D (_ n )}, where 
D{±} = {(MiEA : sign £

2. GENERAL FORMALISM AND THE SET-UP OF THE 
PROBLEM 
Let A C Z be a finite subset of the lattice Z with cardinality |A| = n. Then the 
free Ising spin system in the external field h € Rz is defined by the Hamiltonian

j€ A 
Hence, according to (1), for each fixed configuration h, the finite-volume free 
Gibbs measure is defined by 
Then, by the Kolmogorov existence theorem (Shiryaev, 1984), for any fixed h 
we can construct a unique probability measure 
on the measurable space 
(ft, E) (here ft = {—1,1}z is the space of spin configurations and E is the c-algebra 
generated by the cylinder sets Cv = {s € ft: {s, = Si},ev}, card V(C Z) < oo) 
such that 
^ ( t V e u i k j - n s s S s ; - 
<2> 
This random infinite product measure (indexed by the configurations of the exter-
nal field h) is the limiting Gibbs measure for the free Hamiltonian (1). 
The Curie—Weiss RFIM corresponds to the perturbation of (1) by the Curie— 
Weiss ferromagnetic interaction, which gives the new Hamiltonian:

Then the finite-volume Gibbs measure can be expressed as 
PA(sA I h) = J»A(dy 
| h)pW (sA | h + y),

where (h + y)j = hj + y and ¡¿^(dy | h) is a probability measure on R with the

Now, for any configuration h, the given finite-volume Gibbs measure (4) can be 
extended to cylinder sets C C ft by Pa- Note that ft is compact in the product 
topology and simultaneously a compact metric space. This metric can be defined 
bv the formula

where 11 • 11 denotes the Euclidean norm in Z. Let M (fi) denote the set of probability 
measures on S C ft, and Pn =>• P denote the weak convergence of probability 
measures. By the Stone—Weierstrass theorem, one has 
PROPOSITION 2.1 (Shiryaev, 1984). The set M(0.) is compact 
with respect 
to 
the topology 
of weak convergence 
and Pn 
P in M(Sl) iff Pn(C)

cylinder sets C C CI. 
Then, by Proposition 2.1, there are subsequences {Pa„ } a 
c Z such that P\a => 
=» Pa. From the explicit formulas (4) and (5) it follows that Pa are (linear convex) 
combinations of the shifted infinite product measures Pl°\s | h) =

i.e., 
Pa(A

Proof. 
Note that the sequence {hj}j£z 
is stationary and ergodic. Then, by 
the individual (Birkhoff—Khinchine) ergodic theorem (see (Shiryaev, 1984)), the 
function G\(y | h) in (6) converges A-a.s. to G(y) in (8), for every fixed y G R. 
Because a countable union of null sets is a null set, the same is true for a countable 
dense set N C R. Then, using the fact that 
|a„[GA(y | h ) - V / 2 ] | < l , 
one obtains the A-a.s. convergence G\(y | h) —> G(y), uniformly on compacts 
for all y 6 R. Hence, for any e > 0 there exists a compact K C R such that 
Ma(R \ K | h) < e for A-almost all configurations h 6 H and all sufficiently large 
A C Z. Now the first assertion of the theorem is a consequence of Prokhorov's 
compactness theorem (Shiryaev, 1984) for each h from the above mentioned set of

port in M(v, ¡3). 
COROLLARY 2.1. The limiting Gibbs measures defined as the weak limit points 
{ P Q } of the sequence {P A } A c Z have the form (7), where {fia{dy | h ) } a are defined 
by Theorem 2.1. 
On the other hand, exploiting the explicit formula (4) which connects the finite-
volume Gibbs measure with the product measure 
rAs | h + y) (here 
ft 
—• 
—• {—1,1} A) and using Kolmogorov existence theorem, we can construct the lim-
iting Gibbs measures for (3) if the sequence {fiA(dy | h)}Acz converges (in some 
sense) to a probability measure which, in general, is random: fi\ 
f i w h e r e (iu 
is defined on the probability space (X, A, p) (see Section 3). To this end, one has 
to verify only the consistency of the family 
{Pr"(- | h) = J n „ { d y | h)Py(°>(7rr • | h ) } r c z .

Therefore, in general case one gets

where A € E. For the Curie—Weiss RFIM, the measure fiu can be described in 
the explicit way (see Sections 3—5). 
Let .Mh(ft) denote the set of all limiting Gibbs measures (states) for the Curie— 
Weiss RFIM. Then, from the explicit formulas (7) and (9) we conclude that X h ( f t ) 
is the closed convex hull (mixture) of its extremal points £h(ft) =

property reflects the purity of the limiting Gibbs states for the Curie—Weiss RFIM 
(Angelescu and Z^grebnov, 1985; Brankov et al., 1986). Hence, in agreement with 
the common knowledge (Ruelle, 1969), each pure measure (phase) from the set 
A^h(ft) is one of its extremal points because the decomposition P ^ = \P\ + (1 — 
-A)P 2 with A e (0,1) and Pu P2 € X h ( f t ) implies P1 = P2 =

3. THE LIMITING GIBBS STATES 
According to the last section, the problem to prove the existence of the limiting 
measure is clearly related to the asymptotic control of integrals of the type 
J t(yK(dy | h) 
(11) 
R 
as n —» oo, with nA(dy | h) given by (5) and t e C(R). 
Then we could expect to evaluate (11) by means of Laplace's asymptotic method, 
but this is not straightforward, since the measures fiA are random (they depend 
on h). Nevertheless, in a recent paper (Amaro de Matos and Perez, 1989) it has 
been shown that the method is still applicable together with the control of the 
rate of the convergence G\(y | h) —> G(y). So, the limiting measure 
]im/JA(dy | h) 
may clearly be a random measure. 
Then, the important point must be the study of the fluctuations of G\(y | h) 
around G(y). To describe them, we first introduce the type of a minimum of G. 
Definition 3.1. Suppose that the number of minima of G(y) is finite (say, m). 
Then, each one of them is labelled as yj, i = 1,2,..., m. We say that hi £ Z is 
the type of the minimum yj if the following expansion holds: 
G(y) = G(yj) + - L j ( y - ytf* %k<G(y>0) + o[(y - y ' ) " ' ] 
as y 
yj, with 32*-G(yj) > 0. 
On the other hand, the convergence of G\(y \ h) find all its derivatives is uniform 
on compacts A-a.s. (Angelescu and Zagrebnov, 1985; Amaro de Matos and Perez, 
1989). As a consequence, for each global minimum y'0 it is possible to construct a 
compact set containing y'0 and a sequence of minima of G\(y \ h) converging to 
yj. Let us denote these sequences by {yj,}, i = 1,2,...,m. Before studying the 
fluctuations of the free energy G\(y | h), we need the following 
PROPOSITION 3.1 (Amaro de Matos and Perez, 1989). If yj, is a minimum of 
the type 
then 
n[2(2ti-l)]-(yi _ y j ) = V t i ( h ) + o ( 1 ) 
(12) 
in distribution, as n —> oo, where wjt.-(h) is a random variable with the probability 
measure 
Vi(dx) = ciX(2ii~2> exp [ - x 2* 2*'- 1^*. 
We shall denote this by 
vjfci(b) ~ CiX^2ki~2^ exp [ — 
(13) 
Now we can establish

In general { u o } J 2 = i a s e* 
dependent Gaussian random variables 
with mean zero and variances { . D i } ^ defined by (14). We shall illustrate this 
dependence with an explicit example in Section 5. 
We now return to the control of the integral in (11). For this we need 
PROPOSITION 3.2 (Amaro deMatos and Perez, 1989). For each i = 1 , 2 , . . . , m, 
there exists a sufficiently 
small 0, > 0 such that, as n —» oo,

Ai(h) = ^ * ' G ( y j ) K ( h ) ] " ' - 2 / ( 2 ^ - 2). 
By a suitable change of variables, (16) will allow the use of the dominant conver-
gence theorem and (15) will control the integrand in (11). The result is stated 
as 
THEOREM 3.1. Let {fix(dy

fined on (R,B(R)) by (5). Then for each t € C(R) one has the limit

—pi, respectively} 
are defined on the probability 
space (X, A, p), where X can be 
identified with M(v, ¡3). The probabilities 
pi are given by 
Pi = P r j u J > u'0, for all j ± i j , i = l , 2 , . . . , m , 
(18) 
where uj are defined in Lemma 3.1. 
COROLLARY 3.1. The limiting Gibbs state Pw(- | h) (9) exists for almost all h 
and is given by 
PU(A I h) = j r bi(u)PH>(A 
I h), 
(19) 
i=i 
where u> € X and A 6 E. 
Comparing (19) and (9) with (5), we see that in accordance with Definition 1.1 for 
any Borel set B C R the sequence HK{B | h) is partially self-averaging as A f Z if 
m > 1. The limiting state is a convex random linear combination of the product 
measures 
| h) given in (7). These components of Pu(- \ h) are the so-called 
Vo 
"pure states" (see Section 2). 
Before finishing this section let us stress some points. If the set M(u, 
degenerates 
to one single point, then one gets for {/I a(B | h)} A a standard self-averaging. The 
corresponding limiting Gibbs state Pw(- | h) = Py°\- \ h), given by (19) above, 
is unique and pure. For almost every h € (RZ,.F, A), it can be constructed as a 
weak limit of the sequence of finite volume Gibbs measure on (ft, S ) defined by 
(4). On the contrary, if cardM(u,j3) > 1, this sequence has no limit except by 
subsequences (see Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.1). However, considering it as a 
sequence of random measures, by Theorem 2.1 and equation (4), we get that the 
projections 
{PA(irr • | h)}rcA,Acz 
converge in distribution on cylinder sets C C ft to the consistent family of random 
marginals { P f }rcz- Besides the trivial dependence on h via the product measure 
(4), they depend also o n u i £ X . This is a key of the idea how to reconstruct the 
limiting Gibbs measures with the help of the Kolmogorov existence theorem. If 
we apply this more general construction to the case cardM(t/, 0) = 1, we regain 
the result described before.

that this procedure allow us to renormalize bj or p, in (17), at least for some value 
of p. We shall refer the reader to our paper (Amaro de Matos et al., 1989) for the 
details of this analysis.

This model has been carefully studied in (Salinas and Wreszinski, 1985), and it 
has been shown that there is Hc > 0 such that for H > Hc the function G(y) will 
have only one global quadratic minimum (m = l,fc = l ) a t y = 0. If the structure 
of the minima being so, we say that the system is in the paramagnetic phase. 
For 0 ^ H < Hc there is an increasing continuous function flc(H) such that 
j3c{0) = 1 and flc(Hc) = oo; for ¡3 < ¡3C(H) the system is in the paramagnetic 
phase, while for 0 > 0C(H) function G(y) has two different symmetric globed 
minima of the quadratic type (m = 2, fci = k% = 1). 
At ¡3 = (3C(H) the situation is the following. There is Ht > 0 , Ht < Hc, such that 
if H < Ht, function G(y) has one globed quadratic minimum (m = 1, fc = 2) at 
y = 0. If H = Ht, again there will be only one global minimum at y = 0 but of 
the type k = 3. This is a so-called tricritical point. Finally, if Hc > H > Ht, then 
G(y) will have three quadratic global minima (m = 3, 
= k2 = 
= 1), one at 
y = 0 and the other two symmetric. 
We now turn to the evaluation of the probabilities p, in Theorem 3.1 for this model. 
In all the Cases where G(y) has only one global minimum (m = 1) ¿>i = 1 with 
m 
probability 1, which follows trivially from the normalization condition 
h = 1. 
1=1 
If m = 2, a completely different situation arises. Let 
» 
n i=i 
' 
and 
ff'n = exp { - /3nGA(y;|h)} ( ] T exp { - f3nG\ 
¿=1,2 
Then by (20) we have 
{h : G\(y\ | h) > Gx{yl 
\ h)} = {h : c„ = 1}. 
n 
Therefore, by the CLT for -j- 
one gets that px = p2 = 1/2. According to 
¿=i 
the line of reasoning of Theorem 3.1 (see (Amaro de Matos et al., 1989)) we get 
that

n—>oo 
i.e., D a r e generated by the random variable c„ (see Section 1), and we get a 
conditional (or partial) self-averaging of magnetization. 
For m = 3 the same reasoning applies, but now there are three minima at yl = 
= y* > 0, ?/q = 0 and yj} = — y*. 
The function f(y) 
(see (20)) is increasing.

Hence, y = y„ can not be unique point of the absolute minimum and y = yj,'3 will 
be absolute minimum point for c„ = ±1, correspondingly. Therefore, in this case 
Pi = P3 = 1/2 and P2 = 0. Similarly to the above line of reasoning, one gets: 
Ue^ [m„(h) - M(m„(h) | c„)] ^ 0. 
In the situation when m = 1, according to Definition 1.1, we say that the magneti-
zation is self-averaging, since ( —

in distribution. However, bj are random variables which can be defined on a com-
pletely different probability space than the one on which the random field h is 
defined, as it was described at; the end of Section 2, with probabilities that we 
have just calculated in this simple example. Again, for finite but sufficiently large 
n, the density of the probability distribution of ^ ~~ 2 ¿«^ | will be concentrated 
in peaks around the j/J with relative weights given by the ratio of the probabi-
lities pj. Therefore, the limiting magnetization is now a random variable with 
non-degenerate distribution, i.e., it manifests the partial (or conditional) self-
averaging property. An application of the quasi-average procedure allows one to 
select any pure phase and restore the standard self-averaging property.
