METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR WRITING 
FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
The present invention is related to a Stylus based writing 
System. More Specifically, the present invention is related to 
a stylus based writing System wherein the motion of the 
stylus allows for the writing of multi-word text of arbitrary 
length in a Single continuous gesture. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
Currently, the fast methods available for entering text onto 
a stylus-based personal digital assistant (PDA) are about Six 
times slower than a good touch-typist can achieve on a 
computer keyboard. This limits the use of stylus-based 
PDA's to Short notes and messages. 
Imagine you could write on a stylus-based PDA almost as 
fast as you could touch-type. Entire documents could be 
efficiently entered and edited. The stylus-based PDA would 
find completely new uses and far greater market penetration. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
The present invention pertains to an apparatus for writing. 
The apparatus comprises a writing mechanism. The appa 
ratus comprises a tablet Surface Sensitive to the position of 
the writing mechanism and able to detect whether the 
Writing mechanism is in contact with the Surface. The 
apparatus comprises a computer processor which identifies 
a writeable character from the motion of the writing mecha 
nism from a resting Zone into an other Zone of a plurality of 
Zones when the writing mechanism is in contact with the 
Surface. The computer processor defines the Surface into the 
resting Zone and enough other Zones to identify a written 
alphabet. Each other Zone is in contact with the resting Zone. 
The present invention pertains to a method for writing. 
The method comprises the Steps of moving a Stylus from a 
resting Zone on a tablet Surface to at least an other Zone of 
a plurality of Zones in contact with the resting Zone while the 
Stylus is in continuous contact with the Surface. The Surface 
is Sensitive to the position of the writing mechanism and able 
to detect whether the writing mechanism is in contact with 
the Surface. Then there is the step of identifying a letter with 
a processor in contact with the Surface from the movement 
of the Stylus from the resting Zone to at least the other Zone 
and back to the resting Zone.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference 
numerals refer to Similar or identical parts throughout the 
several views, and more specifically to FIG.1a thereof, there 
is shown an apparatus 10 for writing. The apparatus 10 
comprises a writing mechanism 12. The apparatus 10 com 
prises a tablet Surface 14 Sensitive to the position of the 
Writing mechanism 12 and able to detect whether the writing 
mechanism 12 is in contact with the Surface 14. The appa 
ratus 10 comprises a computer processor 16 which identifies 
a writeable character from the motion of the writing mecha 
nism 12 Such as a Stylus 22 from a resting Zone 18 into an 
other Zone 20 of a plurality of Zones when the writing 
mechanism 12 is in contact with the Surface 14. The com 
puter processor 16 defines the Surface 14 into the resting 
Zone 18 and enough other Zones 20 to identify a written 
alphabet. Each other Zone 20 is in contact with the resting 
Zone 18. 
Preferably, the character is a letter. The writing mecha 
nism 12 is preferably a stylus 22. Preferably, the motion of 
the Stylus 22, which the computer processor 16 uses to 
identify letters, can write words by moving the Stylus 22 in 
continuous multi-word text of arbitrary length in a Single 
continuous gesture. 
The motion of the stylus 22 on the surface 14 detected by 
the computer 16 preferably defines a letter by moving from 
the resting Zone 18 to an other Zone 20 and then back to the 
resting Zone 18 from an other Zone 20. Preferably, the other 
Zones 20 include eight other Zones 20. 
The other Zone 20 moved to from the resting Zone 18 by 
the stylus 22 and back from the other Zone 20 can be the 
same other Zone 20. Alternatively, an other Zone 20 the 
stylus 22 moves to from the resting Zone 18 and back from 
an other Zone 20 are different Zones. 
The present invention pertains to a method for writing, as 
shown in FIG. 1b. The method comprises the steps of 
moving a Stylus 22 from a resting Zone 18 on a tablet Surface 
14 to at least an other Zone 20 of a plurality of other Zones 
20 in contact with the resting Zone 18 while the stylus 22 is 
in continuous contact with the Surface 14. The Surface 14 is 
Sensitive to the position of the writing mechanism 12 and 
able to detect whether the writing mechanism 12 is in 
contact with the surface 14. Then there is the step of 
identifying a letter with a processor 16 in contact with the 
surface 14 from the movement of the stylus 22 from the 
resting Zone 18 to at least the other Zone 20 and back to the 
resting Zone 18. 
Preferably, the moving Step includes the Step of moving 
the stylus 22 from a resting Zone 18 on a tablet surface 14 
to no more than two other Zone 20s. The moving step 
preferably includes the Steps of moving continuously the 
Stylus 22 after the Stylus 22 has been returned to the resting 
Zone 18 to an other Zone 20 and back to the resting Zone 18. 
Then there is the Step of identifying with the processor a 
letter associated with the moving continuously again Step. 
Preferably, after the identifying step, there is the step of 
modifying a display of characters that the movement of the 
Stylus 22 encode. 
Preferably, the moving continuously Step includes the Step 
of continuously moving the stylus 22 to form multi-word 
text of arbitrary length in a single continuous gesture. The 
moving Step preferably includes the Steps of moving con 
tinuously the stylus 22 after the stylus 22 has been returned 
to the resting Zone 18 to an other Zone 20 and back to the 
resting Zone 18. Then there is the step of identifying with the 
processor 16 a shift or lock key which Switches a first set of 

6,031,525 
3 
characters 24 associated with the movement of the stylus 22 
to a Second Set of characters 26 associated with the move 
ment of the stylus 22. 
In the operation of the preferred embodiment, the appa 
ratus 10 comprises: 
1. a computer processor 16. 
2. a writing Stylus 22 
3. a tablet Surface 14 sensitive to the position of the stylus 
22, and able to detect whether the stylus 22 is in contact 
with the Surface 14. 
Usually on a PDA the tablet input surface 14 is part of a 
display screen, (e.g.: the 3COM PalmPilot or Apple 
MessagePad), but that is not necessary. 
The process of operation from Start to finish as Seen by the 
user of the apparatus 10 is as follows. The user works with 
a very simple Stylized alphabet, in which each character 
represents one character on the Standard typewriter key 
board. The user Sees a Small writing area in which a number 
of Zones 20 are arranged around a central resting Zone 18. In 
one instantiation, the Zones are arranged in a 3x3 grid as 
shown in FIG. 2. 
In this 3x3 arrangement, for example, Zone 5 is the resting 
Zone 18. To form a character, the user drags the Stylus 22 
from the central resting Zone 18 out to one of the eight outer 
Zones, in this case 1,2,3,4,6,7,8, or 9, then optionally to a 
Second outer Zone, and finally back to the resting Zone 18. 
The gestures are arranged So that frequent characters can 
be drawn faster. For example, to draw space, e, t, a, o, or n, 
the user moves the stylus 22 from the resting Zone 18 into 
only one other Zone 20, and then immediately back again to 
the resting Zone. To form other characters, the user moves 
the Stylus 22 from the resting Zone 18 first into one Zone, and 
then into a Second Zone, before moving the stylus 22 back 
into the resting Zone 18. Certain characters are shifting 
characters which change to alternate character Sets, Such as 
CAPITAL, PUNCTUATION, or NUMERIC. These alter 
nate character Sets contain additional characters. 
The stylus 22 need never be lifted from the surface 14. 
Furthermore, the user need never Stop moving the Stylus 22. 
Continuous multi-word text of arbitrary length can be writ 
ten fluidly, even in a Single continuous gesture if desired. 
The user can employ “quikwriting mode” (the technique 
of the present invention described herein) even in the middle 
of using the slower standard writing mode of the PDA. 
When the user wishes to enter “quikwriting mode”, he/she 
draws a Special gesture, which Signals that the next Stroke 
will be a quikwriting entry. 
For example, when using the PalmPilot's standard Graffiti 
language, the user could draw a Slash from the lower right 
to the upper left of the writing area (a gesture never used in 
Graffiti). Then the next time the user's stylus 22 touches 
down in the writing area, the PDA will be in “quikwriting 
mode”. The PDA will stay in “quikwriting mode” until the 
user next lifts up the stylus 22, at which point the PDA will 
be placed back into Standard Graffiti writing mode. 
The internal Sequence of operations of the apparatuS 10 is 
as follows. A computer program well known in the art tracks 
the X,y position of the Stylus 22, and outputs a token when 
the user's Stylus 22 enters or leaves each of the nine Zones. 
This Sequence of tokens forms an alphabet, which is cat 
egorized by: 
1. the first Zone entered after leaving the resting Zone 18. 
2. the last Zone exited before returning to the resting Zone 
18. 
The above two zones may be the same. The indices of the 
two Zones are used as a table lookup, to output a single 
character.

The Sequence of operations is: 
1. Begin with stylus 22 in the resting Zone 18. 
2. The computer 16 detects that the stylus 22 has moved 
Out of the resting Zone 18, into Zone I. 
3. The computer 16 detects that the stylus 22 has moved 
back into the resting Zone 18, from Zone J. 
4. A table lookup is done, retrieving entry ch=CI,J), 
where C is a two-dimensional table that stores the 
character of the current character Set. 
5. If ch is a shifting character, then either shift, lock, or 
unlock the alternate character Set S associated with ch, 
as follows: 
1. if the current character set C is not S, then set C=S, 
and Set locked=false 
2. else if not locked then set locked=true 
3. else set C=LOWERCASE and set locked=false 
return to Step 1. 
6. Output character ch. return to Step 1. 
There are four character sets: LOWERCASE, 
CAPITALS, PUNCTUATION, and NUMERIC. The default 
is LOWERCASE. The others are reached via shifting keys. 
Characters within these respective character Sets are 
arranged as shown in FIGS. 3, 4, 5 and 6. 
In the above alphabet, the shifting keys for CAPITALS, 
PUNCTUATION, and NUMERIC, are, respectively, 
up-arrow, rectangle, and circle. Every shifting key is present 
in every character Set. The keys for Space, backSpace, and 
newline are, respectively, right-arrow, left-arrow, and down 
OW. 
One can continually write without ever clicking any 
mouse buttons. Similarly, one can use this technique on a 
PDA without ever needing to lift the stylus 22 from the 
Surface 14. It is preferred if there is present a first region in 
which the characters are displayed and another region in 
which the resting Zone and the other Zones are displayed. 
The position of each printed character in the representa 
tion (which should be considered as a guide template which 
is optional) corresponds to how that character is drawn. Each 
printed character is positioned in one of the eight outer Zones 
(its major Zone), and also at Some relative position within 
this Zone (indicating its minor Zone). To draw a stroke, one 
moves the stylus 22 from resting Zone 18 shown as 5 to the 
character's major Zone, then to the character's minor Zone, 
and finally back to resting Zone 18 shown as 5. If the major 
and minor Zones of a character are the Same, then to draw the 
character one needs only to move the Stylus 22 from resting 
Zone 18 shown as 5 out to the character's major Zone and 
then back again. 
For example, the letter f appears in Zone 3 (the top-right 
Zone). This is its major Zone, indicating that one begins to 
draw the letter f by moving the stylus 22 from the central 
resting Zone 18 shown as 5 to Zone 3. Furthermore, the 
printed f is situated in the top-center of its major Zone. Since 
the top-center Zone is Zone 2, this indicates that the character 
has minor Zone 2. Therefore, one finishes drawing the letter 
fby moving the Stylus 22 into Zone 2, before returning it to 
resting Zone 18 shown as 5. The drawing code for f is 32. 
The first two strokes for the letter f is shown in FIG. 8. 
Returning the cursor to the center will then complete the 
character. 
Some characters (the most frequent ones) require one to 
only to move out from Zone 18 shown as 5 to one other Zone 
20, and then right back again. For example, the letter e 
appears in the middle-left edge of the middle-left Zone; its 
major and minor Zones are both 4. An e is drawn Simply by 
moving the Stylus 22 to the left, and back again to the center. 
The drawing code for e is 4. 

6,031,525 
S 
There are three shifting keys: cap, alt, and num. Cap 
appears in drawing code position 23, alt in drawing code 
position 21, and num in drawing code position 89. These 
keys select for CAPITALS, PUNCTUATION, and 
NUMERIC characters, respectively. If a shifting key is 
triggered just once, then it only affects the next character 
drawn. If a shifting key is triggered twice in a row, then its 
character Set locks on. Triggering a shifting key while its 
character Set is already locked will cause the lock to release, 
and will revert to the default LOWERCASE character set. 
Although the invention has been described in detail in the 
foregoing embodiments for the purpose of illustration, it is 
to be understood that Such detail is Solely for that purpose 
and that variations can be made therein by those skilled in 
the art without departing from the Spirit and Scope of the 
invention except as it may be described by the following 
claims.
