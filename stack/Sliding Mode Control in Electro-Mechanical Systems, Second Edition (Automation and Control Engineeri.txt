Preface to the Second Edition
The authors accepted enthusiastically the opportunity offered by Taylor & 
Francis to publish a second edition of our book for two reasons: On the one 
hand, the proposal itself means that the interest in sliding mode control has 
remained at a high level even 10 years after publication of the fi rst edition. 
On the other hand, it is a good opportunity to include new results into the 
book related to both the control design methodology and applications.
The chapters and sections related to the new theoretical developments 
embrace results on second order sliding mode with continuous control 
actions, state observers with simple binary sensors, and methods of analysis 
and chattering suppression—the phenomenon known to be the main obsta-
cle for sliding mode control implementation. The above list is complemented 
by design principles for simultaneous estimation of state and parameters of 
electric motors and for designing multiphase power converters with chatter-
ing (ripple) suppression. 
Results in automotive application of sliding mode control are presented in 
the concluding chapter.

Introduction
In the course of the entire history of automatic control theory, the inten-
sity of investigation of systems with discontinuous control actions has 
been maintained at a high level. In particular, at the fi rst stage, relay, or 
“on-off’ regulators, ranked highly for design of feedback systems. The 
reason was twofold: ease of implementation and high effi ciency of hard-
ware. Monographs by Flugge-Lotz [1953] and Tsypkin [1955] were most 
obviously the fi rst theoretical generalizations of the wide diversity of 
analysis and design methods for relay systems.
In systems with control as a discontinuous state function, so-called 
“sliding modes” may arise. The control action switches at high frequency 
should the sliding mode occur in the system. The study of sliding modes 
embraces a wide range of heterogeneous areas from pure mathematical 
problems to application aspects.
Systems with sliding modes have proven to be an effi cient tool to 
control complex high-order nonlinear dynamic plants operating under 
uncertainty conditions, a common problem for many processes of mod-
ern technology. This explains the high level of research and publication 
activity in the area and unremitting interest of practicing engineers in 
sliding mode control during the past two decades.
1.1. Examples of Dynamic Systems with Sliding Modes
Sliding modes as a phenomenon may appear in a dynamic system governed 
by ordinary differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides. 
The term sliding mode fi rst appeared in the context of relay systems. It may 
 happen that the control as a function of the system state switches at high 
(theoretically infi nite) frequency, and this motion is called sliding mode. It 
may be enforced in the simplest fi rst-order tracking relay system with the 
state variable x(t):
 
x
f x
u
=
+
( )
with the bounded function f(x), |f(x)| < f0 = constant and the control as a 
relay function (Figure 1.1) of the tracking error e = r(t)−x; r(t) is the reference 
input, and u is given by

It means that the magnitude of the tracking error decays at a fi nite rate, and 
the error is equal to zero identically after a fi nite time interval T (Figure 1.2). 
The argument of the control function, e, is equal to zero, which is the discon-
tinuity point. For any real-life implementation attributable to imperfections 
in switching device, the control switches at high frequency or takes interme-
diate values for continuous approximation of the relay function. The motion 
for t > T is called sliding mode. 
Formally, sliding mode may appear not only in a control system with dis-
continuous control but in any dynamic system with discontinuities in the 
motion equations. In the simple mechanical example system with Coulomb 
friction depicted in Figure 1.3, the right-hand side is a discontinuous func-
tion of the state.

1.2. Sliding Modes in Relay and Variable Structure Systems
The ideas underlying modern analysis and design methods for “sliding mode 
control” (SMC) may be found in the publications of the early 1930s. Figure 1.5 
illustrates the so-called vibration control studied by Kulebakin [1932] in the 
context of voltage control for a DC generator of an aircraft.
Notice that the output voltage is close to the set point as a result of discon-
tinuous feedback and high-frequency switching in the excitation winding. 
It seems that 1930s-era “vibration control” is just the same as our contempo-
rary sliding mode control. 
The second example from the 1930s (Figure 1.6) concerns relay systems 
with sliding modes for controlling the course of a ship [Nikolsky 1934]. It 
is amazing that the paper published more than 60 years ago was written in 
the language of modern control theory: “phase plane,” “switching line,” and 
even sliding mode. 
In all the examples, except for the last one, the phenomenon sliding mode 
was revealed and discussed in time domain, although this term was not 
used directly. However, for analysis and design of sliding mode control, the 
state space method looks much more promising.

where M, a1, a2, c are constant parameters, and f(t) is a bounded disturbance.
The system behavior may be analyzed in the state plane ( , )
x x . The state 
plane in Figure 1.7 is shown for a1 = a2 = 0. The control u undergoes discon-
tinuities at the switching line s = 0, and the state trajectories are constituted 
by two families: the fi rst family corresponds to s > 0 and u = −M (upper 
semiplane), and the second corresponds to s < 0 and u = M (lower semi-
plane). Within the sector m − n on the switching line, the state trajectories 
are oriented toward the line. Having reached the sector at some time t1, the 
state cannot leave the switching line. This means that the state trajectory will 
belong to the switching line for t > t1 . This motion with state trajectories in 
the switching line is called sliding mode. Because, in the course of sliding 
mode, the state trajectory coincides with the switching line s = 0, its equation 
may be interpreted as the motion equation, i.e., 
 
x

promising for designing feedback control for the dynamic plants operating 
under uncertainty conditions.
We have just described an ideal mathematical model. In real implementa-
tions, the trajectories are confi ned to some vicinity of the switching line. The

deviation from the ideal model may be caused by imperfections of switch-
ing devices such as small delays, dead zones, or hysteresis, which may lead 
to high-frequency oscillations as shown in Figure 1.6. The same phenom-
enon may appear as a result of small time constants of sensors and actuators 
having been neglected in the ideal model. This phenomenon, referred to as 
“chattering,” was a serious obstacle to the use of sliding modes in control 
systems, and special attention will be paid to chattering suppression meth-
ods in Chapter 8. Note that the state trajectories are also confi ned to some 
vicinity of the switching line for continuous approximation of a discontinu-
ous relay function (Figure 1.8) as well. In a δ vicinity of the line s = 0, control 
is the linear state function with a high gain k, and the eigenvalues of the 
linear system are close to −k and −c. This means that the motion in the vicin-
ity consists of the fast component decaying rapidly and the slow component 
coinciding with solution to the ideal sliding mode (Equation 1.2.2).
Sliding modes became a principle operation mode in variable structure 
systems or systems consisting of a set of continuous subsystems with a 
proper switching logic. For example, the second-order systems

consists of two unstable linear structures (see Figure 1.9).
By varying the system structure along the switching lines s = 0 and x = 0 
and enforcing sliding mode, the system becomes asymptotically stable 
(Figure 1.10). The switching line is reached for any initial conditions. If the

slope of the switching line is lower than that of the asymptote of the struc-
ture I (c < c0), than the state trajectories are oriented toward the line and 
sliding mode may start at any point of s = 0. Similar to the relay system, the 
sliding mode is governed by the fi rst-order Equation 1.2.2 with the solution

with sliding modes. Use of these properties was the key idea of variable

The motion equation is of reduced order and depends on neither the plant 
parameters nor the disturbance. The desired dynamics of the sliding mode 
may be assigned by a proper choice of the parameters of switching plane ci. 
Although the invariance property is very useful, it did create the illusion 
that any control problem can be easily solved by enforcing the sliding mode in 
the system. The main problem is that the space of state derivatives is a math-
ematical idealization, and ideal differentiators can hardly be implemented. 
As a result, another extreme appeared refl ecting a certain pessimism over

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
the practical possibility of implementing of variable structure systems with 
sliding modes. However, the refusal to use sliding modes in control systems 
proved to be unreasonable as well. 
In modern technological processes, it is common that control and system 
output may be vector-valued quantities, and only some components of the 
state vector are accessible for measurement. The canonical space approach 
did not give any recipe how the control may be designed in such situations. 
The second stage of variable structure system studies was dedicated to the 
development of design methods for systems with motion equations in an 
arbitrary state space with vector control action and vector variable to be con-
trolled [Utkin 1983]. The basic idea underlying the majority of control meth-
ods is enforcing multidimensional sliding modes.
1.3. Multidimensional Sliding Modes
In the previous examples of control systems with sliding modes, the control 
was a scalar state function, and the sliding mode was governed by a differen-
tial equation with the order by one less than the order of the original system. 
So we may assume that sliding motion may appear in an intersection of sev-
eral surfaces if the control is a vector-valued quantity and each component 
undergoes discontinuities in its own switching surface. The planar motion of 
a point mass m with Coulomb friction (Figure 1.12) may serve as an example 
of such sliding mode.

The magnitude of the friction force is equal to M for v ≠ 0. F undergoes

The components of the control undergo discontinuities in two planes of 
the three-dimensional state: 
 
u1 = −M1 sign(s1), s1 = x1 + x2,
 
u2 = −M2 sign(s2), s2 = x1 + x2 + x3,
where M1, M2 are positive constant values. If M2 > |x2 + x3 + f1(t) + f2(t)| + M1,

Hence, the plane s2 = 0 is reached after a fi nite time interval, and then sliding 
mode with state trajectories in this plane will start (see Figure 1.13). For this 
motion, x3 = −x1 − x2, and the sliding mode is governed by the second-order

1.4. Outline of Sliding Mode Control Methodology 
The examples of the control systems in the previous sections let us outline 
the main reasons why enforcing sliding modes is a promising method to 
control high-order nonlinear dynamic plants operating under uncertainty 
conditions. 
In this book, we will deal mainly with processes described by nonlin-
ear differential equations in an arbitrary n-dimensional state space with 
m-dimensional vector control actions (see Figure 1.14):

Similar to the example with two-dimensional sliding mode in the intersec-

mode may occur in the intersection of m surfaces si(x) = 0, (i = 1,…,m), and the 
order of the motion equations is by m less than that of the original system. In

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
connection with control of high-dimensional plants, great interest is attached 
to design methods permitting decoupling the overall system motions into 
independent partial components. As we can see, enforcing sliding modes in 
systems with discontinuous control enables order reduction, which results 
in decoupling and simplifi cation of the design procedure.
Furthermore, the element implementing a discontinuous function u(x) has 
the input s(x) close to zero during sliding mode (see Figure 1.15), whereas 
its output takes fi nite values (to be precise, the average value of the output 
because it contains a high-frequency component).
This means that the element implements high (theoretically infi nite) gain, 
which is the conventional tool to suppress the infl uence of disturbances and 
uncertainties in the plant behavior. Unlike continuous high-gain control sys-
tems, the invariance effect is attained using fi nite control actions. 
Our brief discussion of the motions in systems with sliding modes has 
shown that (1) the order of the system is reduced, and (2) sensitivity with 
respect to parameter variation and disturbances may be reduced should slid-
ing mode occur.
As was demonstrated in the previous sections, the order reduction and 
invariance properties are feasible easily in second-order systems with motion 
equations in the canonical space. The sliding mode dynamics depend on the 
switching surface equations and do not depend on control. Hence, the design 
procedure should consist of two stages. First, the equation of the manifold 
with sliding mode is selected to design the desired dynamics of this motion 
in accordance with some performance criterion. Then, the discontinuous 
control should be found such that the state would reach the manifold and 
sliding mode exists in this manifold. As a result, the design is decoupled 
into two subproblems of lower dimension, and, after a fi nite time interval 
preceding the sliding motion, the system will possess the desired dynamic 
behavior. 
We have dwelt on the main reasons for using sliding modes in control sys-
tems and outlined the sliding mode control design methodology. The basic 
design concept of the control methods studied in this book will focus on

enforcing sliding modes. Decoupling or invariance (or both) will be inherent 
in the majority of the proposed design techniques. 
The decoupling and invariance properties make sliding mode methodol-
ogy an effi cient tool to control complex electrical and mechanical dynamic 
processes governed by high-order differential equation with bounded infor-
mation on parameters and disturbances. An induction motor and multil-
ink manipulator with unknown load torque and inertia and with position, 
speed or torque to be controlled are examples of such processes. The design 
methods for control of (1) pure mechanical systems with a force or torque as 
control actions such as manipulators and mobile robots, (2) pure electrical 
systems such as power converters, and (3) electromechanical systems such 
as electric motors will be developed in the book. 
It is worth mentioning an implementation aspect of sliding mode control. 
Widely used electrical servomechanisms are controlled by power electronic 
converters. When using them, it seems reasonable to turn to control algo-
rithms with discontinuous control actions, because only an on-off operation 
is admissible for such converters and discontinuities in control are dictated 
by the very nature of the converter elements.

Mathematical Background
Sliding mode control is in the class of nonlinear control systems and 
inherently introduces discontinuities into the control loop. However, 
most tools for system analysis and control synthesis were developed for 
“continuous” linear and nonlinear systems. Consequently, these tools 
are not applicable to “discontinuous” methods such as sliding mode con-
trol and variable structure systems.
This chapter provides the mathematical background of the most 
important tools developed for discontinuous systems, in particular for 
the design of sliding mode control. Because this book is mainly intended 
to provide suffi cient tools for practical control design in real-life applica-
tions, the interested reader is referred to the study by Utkin [1992] for a 
more detailed mathematical description of sliding mode techniques.
2.1. Problem Statement
The sketch of design methods discussed in Section 1.3 assumed that the 
properties of sliding modes in canonical spaces (Equation 1.2.3) would be 
preserved for arbitrary systems. These properties—order reduction and 
invariance—were revealed after the sliding mode equation had been derived. 
It was an easy problem because the equation of a switching surface was also 
the equation of sliding mode (see Equations 1.2.2 and 1.2.4). This is not the 
case for systems with motion equations with respect to arbitrary state vari-
ables. The analytical problems arising in such systems with sliding modes 
may be illustrated with the help of a linear second-order system,

As we can see, the order reduction property takes place but invariance with 
respect to the disturbance does not, because the right-hand side of the motion 
equation depends on f t( ) directly. 
The example has shown the fundamental problems related to mathe-
matical models of sliding modes in systems described in the general form 
(Equations 1.4.1 and 1.4.2). To determine conditions for sliding mode to be 
insensitive to system uncertainties, special mathematical methods will need 
to be developed. 
Next, having derived the sliding mode equations, the desired dynamics 
may be assigned by proper choice of the discontinuity surfaces equations 
as the fi rst stage of the design procedure outlined in Section 1.4. The second 
stage implies selection of the discontinuous control inputs to enforce sliding 
mode in the intersection of the surfaces. To solve this problem, the conditions 
for sliding mode to exist should be obtained. For systems with scalar control, 
this condition may be interpreted easily from a geometrical point: the state 
trajectories should be oriented toward the discontinuity surface in its vicinity, 
or the variable describing deviation from the surface and its time derivative 
should have opposite signs. The components of the two- dimensional control 
in the third-order system (Equation 1.3.1) were designed based on these con-
ditions. For the general case, the problem of enforcing sliding mode in the 
intersection of a set of discontinuity surfaces cannot be reduced to sequential 
treatment of scalar subproblems. This may be illustrated by a third-order 
controllable system with a two-dimensional control vector

=  after a fi nite time interval, and 
thereafter sliding mode will arise in this manifold as in all the above systems 
with discontinuous scalar and vector controls. The example illustrates that 
the conditions for two-dimensional sliding mode to exist cannot be derived 
from analysis of scalar cases. Even more, sliding mode may exist in the inter-
section of discontinuity surfaces, although it does not exist on each of them 
taken separately. 
In addition to the problems of mathematical model and invariance condi-
tions for the general case, we face one more problem of mathematical fl avor: the 
existence conditions for multidimensional sliding modes should be derived. 
The mathematical models and existence conditions for sliding modes will be 
studied in this chapter, and the invariance conditions will be addressed in the 
chapter dedicated to the design methods for sliding mode control. 
2.2. Regularization
The fi rst mathematical problem in the context of our plan to use sliding 
modes for designing feedback control systems is the problem of mathemati-
cal description of this motion. It arises as a result of discontinuities in the 
control inputs and hence in right-hand sides of the motion differential equa-
tions. Discontinuous systems are not a subject of the conventional theory 
of differential equations dealing with continuous state functions.* The con-
ventional theory does not answer even the fundamental questions: whether 
the solution exists and whether the solution is unique. Formally, even for 
our simple examples of second-order systems in canonical form (Equation 
1.2.1), our method of deriving the sliding mode equations was not legitimate. 
The solution x t

case for discontinuous functions if x1 and x2 are close to a discontinuity point.

In situations in which conventional methods are not applicable, the com-
mon approach is to use different methods of regularization or replacing 
the original problem by a closely similar one for which familiar methods 
are applicable. For systems with discontinuous controls, the regularization 
approach has a simple physical interpretation. Uncertainty of system behav-
ior at the discontinuity surfaces appears because the motion Equations 1.4.1 
and 1.4.2 are an ideal system model. Nonideal factors, such as small imper-
fections of switching devices (delay, hysteresis, small time constants) and 
unmodeled dynamics of sensors and actuators, are neglected in the ideal 
model. Incorporating them into the system model makes discontinuity point 
isolated in time and eliminates ambiguity in the system behavior. Next, small 
parameters characterizing all these factors are assumed to tend to zero. If the 
limit of the solutions exists with the small parameters tending to zero, then 
they are taken as the solutions to the equations describing the ideal sliding 
mode. Such a limit procedure is the “regularization” method for deriving 
sliding mode equations in the dynamic systems with discontinuous control.
To illustrate the regularization method, we consider a linear time-invari-
ant system with one control input, being a scalar relay function of a linear 
combination of the state components:

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Following the regularization procedure, small imperfections of a switch-
ing device should be taken into account. If a relay device is implemented with 
a hysteresis loop with the width 2Δ (see Figure 2.3), then the state trajectories 
oscillate in a Δ vicinity of the switching plane (see Figure 2.4). The value of Δ
is assumed to be small such that the state trajectories may be approximated

and cb and c2 are assumed to be different from zero. As we can see for this 
general case of a linear second-order system, the sliding mode equation is of 
reduced order and depends on the plant parameters, disturbances, and coef-
fi cients of the switching line equation but does not depend on control.
For the systems in canonical form in Equations 1.2.1 and 1.2.3, the above 
regularization method may serve as validation that the reduced order slid-
ing mode Equations 1.2.2 and 1.2.4 depend on neither plant parameters nor 
disturbances.
Exactly the same equations for our examples result from regularization 
based on an imperfection of “delay” type [Andre and Seibert 1956a,b]. It is 
interesting to note that nonlinear systems of an arbitrary order with one 
discontinuity surface were studied in this paper, and the motion equations 
proved to be the same for both types of imperfections: hysteresis and delay. 
This result may be easily interpreted in terms of relative time intervals for 
control input to take each of two extreme values. For a system of an arbitrary 
order with scalar control,

at a discontinuity surface for differential equations with discontinuous right-
hand sides [Filippov 1988]. According to this method, the ends of all state 
velocity vectors in the vicinity of a point on a discontinuity surface should be 
complemented by a minimal convex set, and state velocity vector of the slid-
ing motion should belong to this set. In our case, we have two points, ends of 
vectors f + and f −, and the minimal convex set is the straight line connecting 
their ends (see Figure 2.5). The equation of this line is exactly the right-hand 
side of Equation 2.2.4. The intersection of the line with the tangential plane 
defi nes the state velocity vector in the sliding mode fsm, or the right-hand side 
of the sliding mode equation. It is clear that the result of Filippov’s method 
coincides with the equation derived by the regularization approach.
The regularization methods discussed above and the methods studied 
by Andre and Zeibert [1956a,b] were developed under rather restrictive 
assumptions: a special class of imperfections (delay or hysteresis) in which 
control may take only two extreme values, with scalar control and one dis-
continuity surface. The general regularization concept embracing a wider 
class of imperfections (such as continuous approximation of a discontinuous 
function) and sliding modes in the intersection of several surfaces is regular-
ization via “boundary layer” [Utkin 1971, 1992]. We describe the idea of the 
boundary layer approach for an arbitrary system with vector control:

i( ) = 0. Similar to sliding mode in the intersection of two planes in 
Equation 2.1.2, sliding mode may occur in the manifold s x
( ) = 0. To obtain the 
sliding mode equations, the ideal control in Equation 2.2.8 is replaced by a 
new control u such that the solution to Equation 2.2.8 with this control exists 
in the conventional sense. Because of the substitution, the trajectories are not 
confi ned to the manifold s x

The imperfections taken into account in the control u are not specifi ed, and it 
is only known that the solution to Equation 2.2.8 with the new control exists 
in the conventional sense. As a rule, real-life imperfections belong to this 
class (including hysteresis, time delay, and small time constants neglected in 
the ideal model). 
The core idea of the boundary layer regularization method is as follows. 
If the limit of the solution to Equation 2.2.8, with u

boundary layer tending to zero, exists and is unique and does not depend on

 equations for the motion in the manifold. The particular cases of  regularization 
for the systems with scalar discontinuous control handled in this section 
have shown that Equation 2.2.7 is the “right” model of sliding mode. More 
general cases will be discussed in the next section using the boundary layer 
approach.
2.3. Equivalent Control Method
From a methodological point of view, it is convenient to develop a procedure 
for deriving the sliding mode equations for the system in Equation 2.2.8, fi rst 
using heuristic method and then analyzing whether they can be taken as the 
motion model based on the boundary layer regularization approach. 
We assume that the initial state vector of the system in Equation 2.2.8 is 
in the intersection of all discontinuity surfaces, i.e., in the manifold s x
( ) = 0, 
and sliding mode occurs with the state trajectories confi ned to this manifold 
for t > 0.
Because motion in the sliding implies s x
( ) = 0 for t > 0, we may assume that 
ds

0 as well. Hence, in addition to s x
( ) = 0, the time derivative s x
( ) = 0 
may be used to characterize the state trajectories during sliding mode. The 
fast switching control u is an obstacle for using conventional methods, so 
disregard the control discontinuities and calculate the vector u such that 
time derivative of vector s on the state trajectories of Equation 2.2.8 is equal 
to zero:

i( ) as rows. Let 
a solution to the algebraic Equation 2.3.1 exist. The solution u

eq( ) will further 
be referred to as “equivalent control.” This continuous function is substituted 
for the discontinuous control u into the original system in Equation 2.2.8:

It is evident that, for initial conditions s x( )

2.3.1, additional motion governed by Equation 2.3.2 will be along the state 
trajectories in the manifold s x

Equation 2.2.8. Equation 2.3.2 is taken as the equation of sliding mode in 
the intersection of m discontinuity surfaces s x

. The proce-
dure of deriving the equation will be referred to as the “equivalent control

surfaces by a continuous one such that the state velocity vector lies in the tan-
gential manifold. For example, in the system with scalar control (Equation 
2.2.3), this vector may be found as the intersection of the tangential plane 
and the locus f x u
( , ) with control u running from u− to u+ (see Figure 2.7). 
The intersection point defi nes the equivalent control ueq and the right-hand 
side f x ueq
( ,
) in the sliding mode Equation 2.1.2. Note that the right-hand 
side f x ueq
( ,
) of the motion equation resulting from the equivalent control 
method does not coincide with that of Filippov’s method ( fsm in Equation 
2.9 and Figure 2.5). They are equal if the system (Equation 2.2.3) with sca-
lar control is linear with respect to control f x u

 ( f0 and b are 
n-dimensional vectors). Then the locus f x u
( , ) of the equivalent control 
method (Figure 2.7) coincides with a minimal convex set (the straight line 
connecting the end of vectors f + and f −) of Filippov’s method. The discrep-
ancy refl ects the fact that different ways of regularization lead to different 
sliding mode equations in systems with nonlinear functions of control input 
in motion equations [Utkin 1972].
We apply the equivalent method procedure to so-called affi ne systems, 
i.e., nonlinear systems with right-hand sides in the motion Equation 2.2.8 as

Equation 2.3.5 is taken as the equation of sliding mode in the manifold 
s x
( )
.
= 0  The equation has been postulated. According to our concept, the 
question whether it is a right model of the motion in sliding mode may be 
answered involving the regularization method based on introduction of a 
boundary layer of the manifold s x
( ) = 0. For the affi ne systems (Equation 
2.3.3), the sliding mode equation is found uniquely in the framework of the 
method, and it coincides with Equation 2.3.5 resulting from the equivalent 
control method. This statement is substantiated by Utkin [1971] under gen-
eral assumptions related to smoothness and growth rate for the functions 
f B u
u
, ,
,
+
−, ands. According to these results, the condition in Equation 2.2.9 
holds, which means that any solution in the boundary layer x t( , )
Δ  tends to 
a solutions x t
*( ) of Equation 2.3.5 regardless of what kind of imperfection 
caused the motion in the boundary layer and in what way the boundary 
layer is reduced to zero. 
Formally, the equivalent control method may be applied to systems that 
are nonlinear with respect to control as well. As was mentioned, the result 
differs from the equations of Filippov’s method even for systems with scalar 
control.
Attempts to show that this or that method is right by using the regulariza-
tion approach have been unsuccessful because the sliding mode equations 
resulting from the limit procedure depend on the nature of introduced imper-
fections and the way of tending them to zero. For example, sliding modes in 
relay systems with small delay or hysteresis in a switching device are gov-
erned by the equation of Filippov’s method, but, for a piecewise smooth con-
tinuous approximation of a discontinuous function, they are governed by the 
equation of the equivalent control method. The reader may fi nd the details of 
sliding mode analysis in nonlinear systems with explanations of the reasons 
of ambiguity in the work of Utkin [1992]. 
Qualitatively, the result for affi ne systems may be explained in terms of a 
system block diagram (Figure 2.8). In compliance with the equivalent control 
method, the time derivative s is formally set to be equal to zero (Equation 
2.3.4). For the motion in a boundary layer, s is a small value of order Δ, but 
s takes fi nite values and does not tend to zero with Δ. This means that real 
control does not satisfy the Equation 2.3.4 and may be found as

sented as a series of integrators, and it is natural to assume that an output 
of each of them may be estimated by an upper bound of the integral of 
an input. 
In our case, the input is s and its integral s tends to zero with Δ →0. 
Therefore, the response to this input tends to zero. This explains why the 
solution with the boundary layer reduced to zero tends to that to the equation 
of the equivalent control method. Of course, this is not the case for the sys-
tems with nonlinear functions of control in motion equations; indeed, gener-

Uniqueness of sliding mode equations in affi ne systems explains why 
the major attention is paid to this class in theory of sliding mode control. 
It is worth noting that systems nonlinear with respect to a state vector and 
linear with respect to a control input are the most common in practical 
applications.
2.4. Physical Meaning of Equivalent Control 
The motion in sliding mode was regarded as a certain idealization. It was 
assumed that the control changes at high, theoretically infi nite, frequency

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
such that the state velocity vector is oriented precisely along the intersection 
of discontinuity surfaces. However, in reality, various imperfections make 
the state oscillate in some vicinity of the intersection, and components of 
control are switched at fi nite frequency alternatively taking the values u
x
i
+( )
and u
x
i
−( ). These oscillations have high frequency and slow components. The 
high frequency is fi ltered out by a plant under control, whereas its motion 
in sliding mode is determined by the slow component. Conversely, sliding 
mode equations were obtained by substitution of equivalent control for the 
real control. It is reasonable to assume that the equivalent control is close to 
the slow component of the real control, which may be derived by fi ltering out 
the high-frequency component by a low-pass fi lter. Its time constant should 
be suffi ciently small to preserve the slow component undistorted but large 
enough to eliminate the high-frequency component. As shown previously by 
Utkin [1992], the output of a low-pass fi lter

This way of tending z to ueq is not something involved but naturally follows 
from physical properties of the system. Indeed, the vicinity of a  discontinuity 
manifold of width Δ, where the state oscillates, should be reduced to make 
the real motion close to ideal sliding mode. For reduction of Δ, the  switching 
frequency f  of the control should be increased; otherwise, the amplitude 
of oscillations would exceed Δ because Δ ≈1/ f . To eliminate the high-
 frequency component of the control in sliding mode, the frequency should 
be much higher than 1/τ , or 1/ f << τ; hence, Δ << τ. Finally, the time con-
stant of the low-pass fi lter should be made to tend to zero because the fi lter 
should not distort the slow component of the control. Thus, the conditions

and Δ/
 (which implies Δ →0) should be fulfi lled to extract the 
slow component equal to the equivalent control and to fi lter out the high-
frequency component. 
It is interesting that the equivalent control depends on plant parameters 
and disturbances that may be unknown. For example, let us assume that 
sliding mode exists on the line s = 0 in the system in Equation 2.1.1:

As we can see, the equivalent control depends on parameters a1, a2, and dis-
turbance f t( ). Extracting equivalent control by a low-pass fi lter, this informa-
tion may be obtained and used for improvement of feedback control system 
performance. Furthermore, this opportunity will be used in Chapter 6 for 
designing state observers with sliding modes and in Chapter 8 for chattering 
suppression.
2.5. Existence Conditions
The methods developed in the previous section enable us to write down the 
sliding mode equation should sliding mode occur in a system. If the slid-
ing mode exhibits the desired dynamic properties, the control should be 
designed such that this motion is enforced. Hence, the conditions for sliding 
mode to exist should be derived: the second mathematical problem in the 
analysis of sliding mode as a phenomenon. For the systems with scalar con-
trol studied in this chapter and Chapter 1, the conditions were obtained from 
geometrical considerations: the deviation from the switching surface s and 
its time derivative should have opposite signs in the vicinity of a discontinu-
ity surface s = 0 [Barbashin 1967] or

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
To be able to use a Lyapunov function in the form of the sum of absolute 
values whenever sliding mode occurs on some of the discontinuity surfaces, 
the corresponding components of discontinuous control should be replaced 
by their equivalent ones, and only then the time derivative of the Lyapunov 
function should be found. 
Definition 2.1
The set S x
( ) in the manifold s x
( ) = 0 is the domain of sliding mode, if for the 
motion governed by Equation 2.5.6, the origin in the subspace s is asymptoti-
cally stable with fi nite convergence time for each x from S x
( ).
Definition 2.2
Manifold s x
( ) = 0 is referred to as sliding manifold if sliding mode exists at 
each point, or S x

The two second-order examples were studied in this section. For both of 
them, time derivatives of positive defi nite Lyapunov functions of “sum of

Remark 2.1
If inequality (Equation 2.5.11) holds for any x, then it simultaneously is “the

fold from any initial point.
Remark 2.2

to exist, only time-invariant systems were handled, but all results are valid 
for time-varying systems as well. The difference for a time-varying switch-

Design Concepts
The key idea of the design methodology for sliding mode control was 
outlined in Chapter 1 (Section 1.4). According to this idea, any design 
procedure should consist of two stages. As established in Chapter 2, slid-
ing modes are governed by a reduced order system depending on the 
equations of some discontinuity surfaces. The fi rst stage of design is the 
selection of the discontinuity surfaces such that sliding motion would 
exhibit desired properties. The methods of conventional control theory, 
such as stabilization, eigenvalue placement, and dynamic optimization, 
may be applied at this stage. The second stage is to fi nd discontinu-
ous control to enforce sliding mode in the intersection of the surfaces 
selected at the fi rst stage. The second problem is of reduced order as well 
because its dimension is equal to the number of discontinuity surfaces, 
which is usually equal to the dimension of control.
Partitioning of the overall motion into two motions of lower dimen-
sions—the fi rst motion preceding sliding mode within a fi nite time 
interval and the second motion being sliding mode with the desired 
properties—may simplify the design procedure considerably. In addi-
tion, sliding modes may be insensitive with respect to unknown plant 
parameters and disturbances, although the invariance property does 
take place for any system, as demonstrated for the system in Equation 
2.1.1 in Chapter 2 (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). In this chapter, different sliding 
mode control design methods based on the decoupling principle will be 
developed and special attention will be paid to the class of the system 
with invariant sliding motions.
3.1. Introductory Example
As an example of sliding mode control design, a multilink manipulator may 
be considered under the assumption that each link is subjected to a control 
force or torque. The system motion is represented by a set of interconnected 
second-order equations:

where q and u are vectors of the same dimension of generalized states and

If sliding mode is enforced in the manifold s = cp + v = 0, then

(Formally, equivalent control ueq should be found from equation s = 0, substi-
tuted into the second equation, and then v should be replaced by −cp; it will 
result in the above equation with respect to p). Assigning the eigenvalues of 
the sliding mode equation by a proper choice of matrix c, the desired rate of 
convergence of p = q and v
q
=  (note that s = cp + v = 0) to zero may be deter-
mined. To enforce the sliding mode with the desired dynamics, convergence

 and low esti-
mate of minimal eigenvalue of M−1 (see Remarks 2.2 and 2.3 in Section 2.4) 
are needed for the design of the control stabilizing the mechanical system 
operating under uncertainty condition with the desired rate of convergence. 
Of course, it should be mentioned that the solution has been obtained in the 
framework of an ideal model with known state vector (pT, vT) and assum-
ing that the control forces may be implemented as discontinuous state 
functions.

The motion Equation 3.2.3 depends on function s0(x1), i.e., on the equa-
tion of the discontinuity manifold. Function s0(x1) may be handled as m-
 dimensional control for the reduced order system. It should be noted that 
the design problem is not a conventional one because right-hand sides in 
Equations 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 depend not only on the discontinuity manifold 
equation but on the gradient matrix G as well. If a class of functions s(x) is 
preselected, for instance linear functions or in the form of fi nite series, then 
both s(x), G and, as a result, the right-hand sides in Equation 3.2.3 depend on 
the set of parameters to be selected when designing the desired dynamics of 
sliding motion.

Generally speaking, matrix − (GB + (GB)T ) is not positive defi nite; there-

as it is recommended in Remark 2.3 of Section 2.4 for control (Equation 3.2.1). 
Let the positive-defi nite function

If an upper estimate F ≥ |(GB)−1 Gf| is known, then V < 0 for U > F, the 
motion is asymptotically stable and sliding mode is enforced in the sys-
tem. Later it will be proven that the time interval preceding sliding mode 
is finite and may be decreased by increasing the magnitude U(x) of the 
discontinuous control. Sliding mode occurs in the manifold s* = 0. The 
transformation (Equation 3.2.6) is nonsingular; therefore, the manifolds 
s = 0 and s* = 0 coincide and sliding mode takes place in the manifold 
s = 0, which was selected to design sliding motion with the desired 
properties. 
The design procedure has been decoupled into two independent subprob-
lems of lower dimensions m and n − m. Decoupling is feasible because the 
sliding mode equations do not depend on control but they do depend on the 
sliding manifold equation. When designing a switching manifold, only one 
constraint should be taken into account: matrix GB should be nonsingular. 
Exact knowledge of plant parameters and disturbances (vector f and matrix 
B) is not needed; only knowledge of an upper bound F is suffi cient to enforce 
sliding mode in manifold s* = 0. Matrix B(x, t) is needed to calculate vector s* 
in Equation 3.2.6. However, the range of parameter variation in matrix B(x, t) 
may be found such that sliding mode can be enforced without exact knowl-
edge of these parameters. 
First, we will show that any m × m transformation matrix Q in

To illustrate the design method for the system in Equation 3.2.1, assume 
that matrix B consists of a known nominal part and unknown variation B 
= B0 + ΔB. Then for Q = (GB0)T, matrix L is of form L = Im + Δ L,  ΔL = (GB0)−1 
GΔB (Im is m × m identity matrix). This form enables finding admissible 
range of variations in matrix B: the sum of absolute values on any row 
of matrix ΔL should not exceed 1. Hence, sliding mode can be enforced 
with control Equation 3.2.6 in systems with unknown parameters in the 
input matrix B(x, t).
3.3. Regular Form
The two-stage design procedure—selection a switching manifold and then 
fi nding control enforcing sliding mode in this manifold—becomes simpler 
for systems in so-called “regular form.” The regular form for an affi ne sys-
tem (Equation 3.2.1) consists of two blocks:

, and B2 is an m × m nonsingular matrix, i.e., 
det B2 ≠ 0. The fi rst block does not depend on control, whereas the dimension 
of the second block coincides with that of the control. 
The design is performed in two stages as well. First, m-dimensional state 
vector x2 is handled as the control of the fi rst block and designed as a func-
tion of the state x1 of the fi rst block in correspondence with some perfor-
mance criterion
 
x2 = −s0(x1). 
(3.3.2)

Again, we deal with a reduced order design problem. At the second stage, dis-
continuous control is to be selected to enforce sliding mode in the manifold 
 
s(x1, x2) = x2 + s0(x1) = 0. 
(3.3.3)
After sliding mode occurs in the sliding manifold (Equation 3.3.3), the condi-
tion (Equation 3.3.2) holds, and the additional motion in the system will be 
governed by the differential equation

Note the following characteristics for the design in the regular form:
 
1. In contrast to Equations 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, the sliding mode equation 
does not depend on gradient matrix G, which makes the design prob-
lem at the fi rst stage a conventional one: design of m- dimensional 
control x2 in (n − m)-dimensional system with state vector x1.
 
2. Calculation of the equivalent control to fi nd the sliding mode equa-
tion is not needed.
 
3. The condition det(GB) = det(B2) ≠ 0 holds. (Recall that this condi-
tion is needed to enforce sliding mode in the preselected manifold 
s(x) = 0.)
 
4. Sliding mode is invariant with respect to functions f2 and B2 in the 
second block.
These characteristics suggest that we should fi nd a coordinate transforma-
tion reducing the original affi ne system (Equation 3.2.1) to the regular form 
(Equation 3.3.1) before designing sliding mode control. We will confi ne our-
selves to systems with scalar controls. The methods related to systems with 
vector control may be found in the work of Luk’yanov and Utkin [1981]. We

3.4. Invariance 
Consider a control system with time-varying parameters operating in the 
presence of disturbances. Given reference inputs may be treated as distur-
bances if the deviations of control variables from the inputs are included 
into a state vector. The possibility of designing systems with invariant 
sliding motions in canonical spaces was discussed in the introduction to 
Chapter 1.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
The sliding mode equation is invariant to the plant parameter variations and 
the disturbance, and its dynamics are determined by the roots of the char-
acteristic equation
 
pn−1 + cn−1pn−2 + … + c2p +c1 = 0,
which may be shaped by a proper choice of coeffi cients ci in the equations of 
the discontinuity surface. 
However, technical diffi culties involved in obtaining time derivatives of 
the plant output x1 are the major obstacles for implementation of such spe-
cifi c sliding modes. At the same time, by means of both scalar and vector 
control, invariant sliding modes can be enforced in the spaces whose coordi-
nates may not only be derivatives but arbitrary physical variables as well.
Let us formulate the invariance conditions for arbitrary affi ne systems of 
the form in Equation 3.2.1:
 
x

B x t u
h x t
=

( , )
( , )

where vector h(x, t) characterizes disturbances and parameter variations that 
should not affect the feedback system dynamics. In compliance with the

(3.4.3)
Let range B(x, t) be a subspace formed by the base vectors of matrix B(x, t) for 
each point (x, t). Sliding mode is invariant with respect to vector h(x, t) if
 
h(x, t) ∈ range(B(x, t)). 
(3.4.4)
The condition in Equation 3.4.4 means that there exists vector γ (x, t) such that 
 
h(x, t) = B(x, t) γ (x, t). 
(3.4.5)
Direct substitution of vector h(x, t) in the form of Equation 3.4.5 into Equation 
3.4.3 demonstrates that the sliding motion in any manifold s(x) = 0 does not 
depend on perturbation vector h(x, t). As follows from the design methods in 
Sections 3.1 and 3.2, an upper estimate of this vector is needed to enforce the 
sliding motion. The condition in Equation 3.4.5 generalizes the invariance 
condition obtained by Drazenovic [1969] for linear systems.

3.5. Unit Control 
The objective of this section is to demonstrate a design method for discon-
tinuous control enforcing sliding mode in some manifold without individual 
selection of each component of control as a discontinuous state function. The 
approach implies design of control based on a Lyapunov function selected 
for a nominal (feedback or open-loop) system. The control is to be found 
such that the time derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative along the 
trajectories of the system with perturbations caused by uncertainties in the 
plant model and environment conditions.
The roots of the above approach may be found in papers by Gutman and 
Leitmann published in the 1970s [Gutman and Leitmann 1976; Gutman 1979]. 
The design idea may be explained for an affi ne system:

is negative. This implies that the perturbed system with control (Equation 
3.5.7) is asymptotically stable as well.
Two important features should be underlined for the system with control 
(Equation 3.5.7):
 
1. Control (Equation 3.5.7) undergoes discontinuities in (n − m)-dimen-
sional manifold s(x) = BT grad(V) = 0 and is a continuous state function 
beyond this manifold. This is the principle difference between control 
(Equation 3.5.7) and all the control inputs in the previous sections with 
individual switching functions for each control component.
 
2. The disturbance h(x, t) is rejected because of enforcing sliding mode 
in the manifold s(x) = 0. Indeed, if the disturbance (Equation 3.5.4) is 
rejected, then control u should be equal to −γ (x, t) which is not gen-
erally the case for the control (Equation 3.5.7) beyond the discon-
tinuity manifold s(x) = BT grad(V) ≠ 0. It means that sliding mode 
occurs in the manifold s = 0, and the equivalent value of control ueq 
is equal to −λ(x, t). 
Note that the norm of control (Equation 3.5.7) with the gain  
ρ(x, t) = 1

Later on, unit control was used directly with a Lyapunov function at the 
second stage of the conventional two-stage design procedure for sliding 
mode control: selection of a sliding manifold s(x) = 0 and enforcing sliding 
mode in this manifold [Ryan and Corless 1984; Dorling and Zinober 1986]. 
The manifold s(x) = 0 was selected in compliance with some performance

undergoes discontinuities should any of the components of vector s change 
sign, whereas the unit control is a continuous state function until the mani-

will be treated in this section.
Time derivative of s is a discontinuous state function (or (grad(s))T b  ≠ 0), 
and sliding mode is enforced on the surface s(x) = 0. The above condition 
means that the relative degree with respect to function s(x) is equal to one, 
i.e., the derivative of s(x) depends directly on control u(x). Of course, gener-
ally speaking, the control system is designed to control some output variable 
y(x), and the relative degree with respect to the output should not be equal 
to one. It depends on the structure of the plant and does not depend on the 
controller. For enforcing sliding mode, relative degree with respect to s(x) 
equal to one can be provided by selecting it as a state function or, as we will 
see in Section 9.2, a function of the state of a dynamic controller. 
The principal design idea of sliding mode control implies generating 
reduced order motion in some manifold s(x) = 0 with the desired properties. 
The question of interest is, “Can a similar effect be reached for cases with 
a relative degree greater than one, i.e., when the time derivative of s(x) is 
continuous, but s x
( ) is a discontinuous state function and the control input

is a continuous state function?” If true, the range of applications of sliding 
mode control will be increased because not all actuators can operate with 
discontinuous inputs. For example, high-frequency switching in an output 
may result in damage of valves in hydraulic actuators. This chattering prob-
lem will be addressed in Chapter 8.
In numerous publications, different design methods were offered for 
these cases, and the authors referred to these methods as “high-order slid-
ing mode control.” For a survey, see the work of Levant [2007]. The design 
methods will be discussed in this chapter except for the cases when high-
order sliding modes can be easily interpreted in terms of the conventional 
sliding modes (or fi rst-order sliding modes). For example, conventional slid-
ing mode occurs in the switching line cx

0 in the system in Equation 
1.2.1 studied in the introductory chapter. If s0 = x denotes the switching 
function, then s0 is continuous, whereas s0 is discontinuous, but it is hardly

 second-order sliding mode. Similarly, sliding mode in the origin of the 
canonical space of the system in Equation 1.2.3 should not be referred to as 
the nth order sliding mode with respect to s0 = x, or the (n − 1)th order with 
respect to s
cx
x
1 =
+ , and so on.
As a fi nal remark of this section, the problem of sliding mode existence in 
the system with continuous control will be addressed. The design objective 
is the same as in fi rst-order sliding mode system, e.g., Equation 1.2.2: the state 
trajectories should be in the manifold s(x) = 0. If the right-hand side of the 
motion equation satisfi es the Lipschitz condition (which is not the case for 
control as a discontinuous state function), then the manifold s(x) = 0 cannot 
be reached for arbitrary initial conditions as a result of uniqueness of solu-
tions. However, it can happen if control is a continuous non-Lipschitzian 
function. Indeed, let the continuous control in the system in Equations 2.3.3 
and 2.3.4 with GB = I be of form

similar to that of the systems with discontinuous control: it is reasonable to 
call this motion sliding mode.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
3.6.2. Twisting Algorithm 
The system in Equation 3.6.1 is assumed to have a relative degree with respect 
to s(x) equal to one. Then discontinuous control can be designed such that 
sliding mode occurs on the surface s(x) = 0. If because of technological con-
ditions control actions have to be continuous, the problem can be solved by 
inserting a dynamic block, for instance an integrator, between discontinuous 
control and the system input:
 
u
v
= .  
(3.6.4)
It is assumed that the time derivative s is available, and v is designed as a 
discontinuous function of s and s.
Of course, this assumption means that the relative degree of the system 
has not been changed and still is equal to one. The problem of reducing 
s to zero can be easily solved based on the conventional sliding mode v = v0 
signS, S
s
cs
=


 with v0 being constant or a continuous state function. Because 
S is discontinuous, sliding mode can be enforced on S = 0, which means that 
s → 0. As discussed in Section 3.6.1, it is hardly reasonable to refer to slid-
ing mode in point s
s
=
=

0 as the second-order sliding mode. Conventional 
sliding mode can be enforced on the line S
s
c s
=

=

0. Similar to Equation 
3.6.3, the solution to this equation is reduced to zero after a fi nite time. The 
fi niteness of the reaching time served as the argument for several authors to 
label the conventional sliding mode in the point s
s
=
=

0 “second-order slid-
ing mode.”
One more interesting modifi cation of the control algorithm for the system in 
Equations 3.6.1 and 3.6.4 was proposed under the assumption that the point 
s

0 is reached after a fi nite time interval, but sliding mode does not occur 
at this fi rst stage of motion. Illustrate the design idea for the case (grad(s))T

s = 0, sliding mode cannot exist on this switching line, if s ≠ 0, because 
M0 > M1 and s does not change sign.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
The above analysis let us make the conclusion:
Beyond the domain D for any value of the state vector the Lyapunov 
function decays at fi nite rate greater than α, for any initial conditions 
in the boundary of D or in its inner part the average rate is also fi nite 
greater than α0. This means that under the condition

the origin in the plane ( , )
s s  is reached after a fi nite time interval and 
then the second order sliding mode starts. It follows from the motion 
equations that the time functions S(t) and s t( ) cannot remain sign-con-
stant; they have interlacing zeros. Therefore the sliding mode control 
algorithm discussed in this section is called “twisting.”
3.6.3. Super-Twisting Algorithm 
Similar to the twisting algorithm, the super-twisting sliding mode control 
algorithm [Levant 2007] relies on inserting an integrator into the control loop, 
such that control becomes a continuous time function. However, in contrast 
to the twisting algorithm, the time derivative of function s is not needed. 
As a result, the relative degree of the system is increased. Nevertheless, the 
new control design methodology allows enforcing the second-order sliding 
mode after a fi nite time interval and suppressing unknown disturbances 
with bounded time derivatives. The design idea of the super-twisting con-
trol again will be illustrated for the system in Equation 3.6.1 assuming that 
(grad(s))T b = 1.

there is no need to use the derivative of a switching function.

Sliding Mode Control of Pendulum Systems
The design of sliding mode control for nonlinear multivariable systems 
has been extensively studied in many books and papers. The design 
procedure of such high-order nonlinear control systems may be com-
plicated and varies from case to case. The objective of this chapter is to 
develop design methods for nonlinear mechanical systems governed by 
a set of second-order equations. The proposed approach assumes that 
the control systems can be transformed into a regular form (see Section 
3.2), which enables decoupled control design. The control laws are illus-
trated for different inverted pendulum systems.

When controlling mechanical systems, we deal with a set of interconnected 
second-order nonlinear differential equations:

mechanical systems, J(q) is an inertia matrix. The system may be underactu-
ated, i.e., it has fewer inputs than degrees of freedom, and/or is unstable. 
The system in Equation 4.1.1 may be represented in the form of 2n equa-

systems consisting of blocks governed by the second-order equations. Then 
it can directly be applied to nonlinear mechanical systems (Equation 4.1.1).
The inertia matrix J(q) in mechanical systems is nonsingular, and B has full 
rank matrix; hence, J−1(q)B has full rank as well. The components of vector q

(4.1.3)
For the regular form with blocks consisting of fi rst-order equations (Section 
3.2), the state of the low block was handled as control in the top block. The 
desired dependence between the two subvectors was provided by enforcing 
sliding mode. 
In our case, the top block equation in Equation 4.1.3 depends on both vec-
tors y and y. This fact introduces some peculiarities that should be taken 
into account when designing sliding mode control. Furthermore, stabiliza-
tion tasks for different types of mechanical systems will be studied. It is 
assumed that the origin in a system state space is an equilibrium point of an 
open-loop system:
 
f1(0, 0, 0, 0) = 0,
 
f2(0, 0, 0, 0) = 0. 
4.1.1. Case 4.1
First, the stability of the system zero dynamics with vector y as an output 
is checked. They are governed by the fi rst equation in Equation 4.1.3 with 
y = 0, y = 0:
 


(4.1.4)
If they are stable, then sliding mode is enforced in the manifold s

with scalar parameter c > 0. It is a simple task because rank (B2) = m and 
any method of enforcing sliding modes in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 is applicable. 
After sliding mode starts in the manifold s = 0, the state y tends to zero as

a  solution to y
cy
+
= 0, and, hence, because of stability of zero solution of 
Equation 4.1.4, z decays as well.
4.1.2. Case 4.2
Now stability of the system zero dynamics with vector z as an output is 
checked. If z(t) ≡ 0, then the zero dynamics equation are obtained from the 
top block of Equation 4.1.3:

(4.1.5)
Note that the zero dynamics are a set of fi rst-order equations, whereas they 
are a set of second-order equations in Case 4.1. If the zero dynamics are sta-
ble, then sliding mode is enforced in the manifold

(4.1.7)
For positive scalar parameters c1 and c2, the solution to Equation 4.1.7 tends 
to zero, and then y(t) as a solution to Equation 4.1.6 tends to zero as well. This 
stabilization method for systems with stable zero dynamics is applicable if

and, as shown in Section 3.2, sliding mode can be enforced. Generally speak-
ing, this condition holds if dim(z) ≤ dim(y).

i.e., f

  If the condition in Equation 4.1.6 holds, then z and z tend

Because the origin of the state space is the equilibrium point, f1(0,0,0) = 0,

(4.1.11)
In the reduced order system in Equation 4.1.11, the state of the second block 
in Equation 4.1.3 y is handled as (n − m)-dimensional control. For instance, it 
may be selected 
 
y
s p

(4.1.12)
such that the system
 
p

is asymptotically stable. The relationship in Equation 4.1.12 is valid if sliding 
mode is enforced in the manifold 
 
s = y + s0(p) = 0.
Similar to Case 4.2, this can be done because Equation 4.1.8 holds by our 
assumption.
Remark 4.1
The design procedures for Cases 4.2 through 4.4 were developed under the 
assumption in Equation 4.1.8. If this condition does not hold, a multistep pro-
cedure may be applied similar to that described by Luk’yanov and Dodds 
[Luk’yanov 1993; Luk’yanov and Dodds 1996].
An example of a two-step design will be described in Section 5.6 for lin-
ear time-varying systems. Three nonlinear pendulum systems based on the 
above design procedures will be studied in the following section. The spe-
cifi c design procedures for selecting a sliding manifold and discontinuous 
control for a cart pendulum, a double-inverted pendulum, and a rotational 
inverted pendulum will be demonstrated. The theoretical studies will be 
complemented by simulation and experimental results.
4.2. Cart Pendulum
Figure 4.1 shows the physical model of a cart-pendulum system. M and m are 
masses of the cart and the inverted pendulum, respectively. l is the distance 
from the center of gravity of the link to its attachment point. The coordinate x

represents the position of the cart on the horizontal axis to a fi xed point, and 
θ is the rotational angle of the pendulum. Using the method of Lagrangian 
equations, one can easily show that the dynamic equations of the cart pen-
dulum [Mori, Nishihara, and Furuta 1976] are

The goal of the control is to stabilize the system in a position in which the 
pendulum is in the unstable vertical position θ = 0 and the cart is at a given 
point on the straight line x = 0 under the action of the control force u. It is 
assumed that the parameters and the state vector are available. For conve-
nience of design, we fi rst rewrite the given system in Equation 4.2.1 with

base and a pendulum. 
m1 and J1 are mass and inertia of the pendulum, l1 is the distance from the 
center of gravity of the link to its pivot point, g is the gravity acceleration, and 
C1 is the frictional constant between the pendulum and the rotating base. 
The coordinate θ0 represents the rotational angle of the base with respect 
to some horizontal axis (usually defi ned as the starting position), and θ1 is 
the rotational angle of the pendulum with respect to the vertical axis. θ0 = 0 
refers to the unstable equilibrium point.

The upper equation is a simplifi ed model of the permanent magnet DC 
motor used to drive the rotating base with constants ap and Kp. The bottom 
equation of the system in Equation 4.3.1 is the dynamics of the pendulum. K1 
is a proportionality constant. The sign of K1 depends on the position of the 
pendulum: K1 < 0 inverted position and K1 > 0 for noninverted position. The 
applied armature voltage u is the only control input of the system.
As addressed  by Widjaja [1994], the inverted pendulum system includes 
several control problems: swing-up, balancing, and both swing-up and bal-
ancing. In this section, we will concentrate on a sliding mode controller for 
balancing the pendulum. The swing-up algorithm in the experiments will be 
directly taken from the work by Widjaja [1994]. First, we will try to stabilize 
the system such that the pendulum is in the unstable vertical position θ1 = 0 
and allow the base to be at an arbitrary fi xed position. Then, the design 
method will be generalized to drive both the pendulum and the rotating 
base to the equilibrium point θ1 = θ0 = 0 and maintain it there.

(4.4.4)
Let us fi rst consider the lower subsystem of the regular form in Equation 
4.4.4 and try to stabilize the system with respect to θ1 = 0. If the discontinu-
ous control u = −M sign(s) is applied with s =
+
θ

1; α > 0, both θ1

→ and 
θ1 → 0 as t → ∞ after sliding mode is enforced in the plane s = 0. However, 
the zero dynamics of the pendulum from the upper equation of Equation 
4.4.4 are governed by y = 0; hence, y → ∞ as t → ∞, and the system is unstable. 
Therefore, the conventional design approach (Case 4.1 in Section 4.1) does 
not work for the pendulum system if the control should stabilize the inverted 
pendulum in the unstable vertical position with an arbitrary fi xed position 
of the rotating base, θ0 = const.
Now we design a sliding mode controller for the pendulum system based 
on the procedure of Case 4.2 in Section 4.1. Consider the upper equation of

with x → 0 as t → ∞ for positive constant α1. In addition, because x decay 
exponentially, we can conclude from Equations 4.4.7, 4.4.5, and 4.4.3 that 
functions θ1, y, θ1, and θo all decay exponentially as well. As a result, the

4.4.2. Control of the Base Angle and Inverted Pendulum
We have just shown that the system can be stabilized with respect to θ1 = 0 
and θ0

=  by introducing a new variable of x. Design of the control system 
for stabilizing both the pendulum and the rotating base at the equilibrium 
point (θ0, θ1) = (0,0) is performed as follows.
Step 1: The fi rst equation of Equations 4.4.6 and 4.4.5 constitute the system 
similar to Equation 4.1.11 in the design method of Case 4.4:

From a practical point of view, because the inverted pendulum is designed 
to rotate freely around its pivot, the frictional constant C1 is much less than 
the torque (m1gl1) of the pendulum itself. Therefore, the condition in Equation 
4.4.15 holds for a real pendulum system. Moreover, if V = 0 or x + y = 0, it fol-
lows from Equation 4.4.13 that x is a constant value but y → ∞ as t → ∞ if this 
constant value is different from zero. Therefore, the system in Equation 4.4.13 
can maintain the V = 0 condition only at the equilibrium point (x,y) = (0,0). It 
is shown that the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable in the large with 
x → 0 and y → 0 as t → ∞. Consequently, as follows from Equations 4.4.12 and 
4.4.2, (θ0,θ1) → (0,0) as t → ∞, which is control objective. 
Step 2: Following the same procedure as described in the previous case, 
Equation 4.4.12 holds if the function
 
s1 = sin θ1 + λ1(x + y) = 0.

Both simulation and experimental results for stabilizing the rotational

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
The experimental setup was developed, and it is currently available for 
both undergraduate and graduate control system laboratories at The Ohio 
State University. 
Figure 4.3 describes the complete hardware setup confi guration of the 
inverted pendulum system. The real-time control system mainly consists of 
three parts: the controller, interface circuits, and the pendulum system. Two 
optical encoders are used to measure the angular positions of both the pen-
dulum and the base. All parameters of the inverted pendulum system are 
listed in Table 4.1, and they are determined experimentally by identifi cation 
techniques [for more details, see Widjaja 1994]. 
The inverted pendulum system allows the user to change the system 
parameters or add disturbances by attaching containers of various size and 
contents to the end of the pendulum. A container of metal bolts and water 
will later be added to the pendulum in the set of experiments. The mass of 
the container and its contents signifi cantly change the system parameters, 
whereas the motion of the water within the container acts as a disturbance 
to the system.

the rotational angle of the pendulum is within the range of |θ1| ≤ 0.3rad. The 
experimental results for nominal conditions by using the LQR has been pro-
vided previously [Widjaja 1994; Ordonez, Zumberge, Spooner, and Passino 
1997]. 
We will focus on the performance of the inverted pendulum system 
using our previously developed sliding mode controllers. Two case stud-
ies of the control objectives will be presented: stabilizing the pendulum at 
θ1 = 0 with θo = 0, and stabilizing both the pendulum and the rotating base 
with respect to the equilibrium point θ1 = θo = 0.

input is Equations 4.4.2, 4.4.5, 4.4.8, 4.4.9, and 4.4.10. As can be seen, the pen-
dulum angle is driven to zero, and the rotating base at the same time remains 
at a fi xed position (its angular velocity equals to zero) with the selected input 
gains λ1 = 0.08, λ = 100, and u0 = 3.
The discontinuous controller was implemented for real-time control of 
the pendulum. We observed that, as a result of the sampling issue of the 
discrete-time control system, in practice, the ideal sliding mode control 
cannot be implemented. Besides, as presented in many publications [Utkin 
1978; Kwatny and Siu 1987; Bartolini 1989], the chattering that appears as a 
high-frequency oscillation at the vicinity of the desired manifold may be 
excited by unmodeled high-frequency dynamics of the system. To suppress 
the  chattering, the saturating continuous approximation [Slotine and Sastry 
1983; Burton and Zinober 1986] (see also Chapters 8 and 9) will be used to 
replace the ideal switching at the vicinity of the switching manifold. This 
results in a tradeoff between accuracy and robustness. 
Figures 4.6 through 4.8 show the experimental results of the SMC for sta-
bilizing the pendulum with different loads attached to the end of the pen-
dulum. The sampling time for the control system is Δ t = 5ms, and it is fi xed 
for other experimental results in the later fi gures. The control law using a 
continuous approximation by a sinusoidal function is designed as

where δ is the allowable maximum width of the continuous zone from the 
desired ideal sliding manifold s = 0. It can be easily shown that the ideal 
discontinuous control is implemented if δ = 0. The larger the value of δ, the 
less invariance to system uncertainties is anticipated, although the less chat-
tering in the system states is accomplished. The input gains of the SMC pen-
dulum system are selected as λ1 = 0.08, λ = 400, u0 = 2.5.
As can be seen in Figure 4.6 for the nominal plant, the pendulum angle is 
stabilized close to zero. The control force input, as we expected, swings up 
the pendulum from the beginning, switches to the SMC at time around 1.5 
sec, and then stays in the δ zone |u| < u0 = 2.5 after 2 sec. It should be noted 
that the system is stabilized at the point (

1 . It explains why the position of the rotating base 
is slowly drifting (θo is not constant). Similar results were obtained when the 
same controller is used to drive the pendulum with both the water (Figure 4.7) 
and the metal bolts (Figure 4.8). We observe that the controller can still 
manage the balance of the inverted pendulum quite well without satura-
tion of the control input. The interesting differences include the following: 
small ripples are generated as a result of the distributed disturbance from 
the water in Figure 4.7, the average values of the control input in both cases 
gradually converge to zero when disturbances get settled at the fi nal time

10 sec, and a smaller amplitude of the control input is observed at the steady 
state when additional weight, the metal bolts, are added to the system as 
shown in Figure 4.8.
4.5.2. Stabilization of the Inverted Pendulum and the Base
The sliding mode control for stabilizing both the pendulum and the base 
will be designed following Equations 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.5, and 4.4.8 through 
4.4.10. The simulation results for control (Equation 4.4.10) with the gains 
λ1 = 0.08, λ = 800, and u0 = 3 are shown in Figure 4.9. 
Figure 4.10 shows the experimental results of the SMC for the nominal 
pendulum using the modifi ed controller in Equation 4.5.1 with λ1 = 0.08, 
λ = 800, and u0 = 2.5. For a small value of δ, we observe that the control input

is still similar to the discontinuous control in Figure 4.5, although its switch-
ing frequency is considerably reduced. As a result, chattering exists in both 
of the state responses. The results for a larger value of δ are shown in Figure 
4.11. The control input is no longer saturated and varies between the extreme 
values ± 2.5.
The most interesting experimental results are depicted in Figures 4.12 and 
4.13. The controller is able to provide convergence of the pendulum with both 
metal bolts and sloshing water using the same gains for the control input. The 
system states are stabilized at the vicinity of the equilibrium point (θ0,θ1) =
(0,0). The low-amplitude oscillations similar to Figure 4.7 under the effect of 
sloshing water dynamics is still observed in Figure 4.12, where the control 
input has an average value close to zero. We observe an underdamped sys-
tem response in Figure 4.12 for the pendulum with metal bolts. The control

Control of Linear Systems
The objective of this chapter is to demonstrate the sliding mode control 
design methodology for linear systems. Reducing system equations to 
the regular form will be performed as a preliminary step in all design 
procedures. The core idea is to use the methods of linear control theory 
for reduced-order equations and to use different methods of enforcing 
sliding modes with the desired dynamics.
5.1. Eigenvalue Placement
We start with the conventional problem of linear control theory: eigenvalue 
placement in a linear time invariant multidimensional system
 
x
Ax
Bu
=
+
, 
(5.1.1)
where x and u are n- and m-dimensional state and control vectors, respec-
tively, A and B are constant matrices, rank(B) = m. The system is assumed to 
be controllable.
For any controllable system, there exists a linear feedback u = Fx (F being 
a constant matrix) such that the eigenvalues of the feedback system, i.e., of 
matrix A + BF, take the desired values, and, as a result, the system exhibits 
desired dynamic properties [Kwakernaak and Sivan 1972]. 
Now we will show that the eigenvalue task may be solved in the frame-
work of sliding mode control technique dealing with a reduced order sys-
tem. As demonstrated in Section 3.2, the design becomes simpler for systems 
represented in regular form. Because rank(B) = m, matrix B in Equation 5.1.1 
may be partitioned (after reordering the state vector components) as

2 ∈ℜ, and Aij are constant matrices for i, j = 1, 2. It fol-
lows from controllability of (A, B) that the pair (A11, A12) is controllable as 
well [Utkin and Young 1978]. Handling x2 as an m-dimensional intermediate 
control in the controllable (n − m)-dimensional fi rst subsystem of Equation 
5.1.4, all (n − m) eigenvalues may be assigned arbitrarily by a proper choice 
of matrix C in
 
x2 = −Cx1.
To provide the desired dependence between components x1 and x2 of the 
state vector, sliding mode should be enforced in the manifold
 
s = x2 + Cx1 = 0, 
(5.1.5)
where sT = (s1,…,sm) is the difference between the desired and real values 
of x2. 
After sliding mode starts, the motion is governed by a reduced order sys-
tem with the desired eigenvalues

It is evident that there exists such value of α that for any δ the time derivative 
V is negative, which validates convergence of the state vector to manifold s = 0 
in Equation 5.1.5 and existence of sliding mode with the desired dynamics. 
The time interval preceding the sliding motion may be decreased by increas-
ing parameters α and δ in control (Equation 5.1.7).

Again, there exists α such that V is negative for any δ and states reach mani-
fold s = 0 after a fi nite time interval.
If the system is not reduced to the regular form, the manifold s = Cx (C 
being an m × (n − m) matrix) may be selected in terms of the original system 
(Equation 5.1.1) based on the equivalent control method approach and the 
conditions for sliding mode to exist (Sections 2.3 and 2.4). Assume that slid-
ing mode in s = 0 has the desired dynamic properties and matrix CB is not 
singular. Then

If matrix (CB + (CB)T) is positive defi nite, then discontinuous control 
 
u = −M(x)sign(s),
with M(x) = (α|x| + δ) and suffi ciently high but fi nite α and an arbitrary value 
of δ leads to sliding mode after a fi nite time interval. (The proof is similar to 
the one for nonlinear systems in Section 3.2).
For an arbitrary matrix CB, control should be selected in compliance with 
the method of Section 3.2:
 
u = −U(x)sign(s*), s* = (CB)Ts.

Finally, it is interesting to note that, for systems with the nonlinear unit 
control, a sliding mode existence condition may be derived by the algebraic 
stability criteria developed for linear systems. Indeed, if CB is a Hurwitz 
matrix, then Lyapunov equation (CB)P + PT(CB) = −Im has a positive defi -
nite solution P > 0, and the time derivative of Lyapunov function candidate

If function M(x) = (α|x| + δ), then V is negative and sliding mode occurs after 
a fi nite time interval (see Section 3.5).
5.2. Invariant Systems
One of the main objectives of designing feedback control systems is to reduce 
sensitivity with respect to disturbances and plant parameter variations. As 
shown in Section 3.3, sliding modes in any manifold are invariant to those 
factors if they act in a control space (Equations 3.4.4 and 3.4.5). For linear 
systems

the invariance conditions were formulated in terms of system and input 
matrices in the work by Drazenovic [1969]: sliding modes in any manifold 
are invariant with respect to parameter variations ΔA(t) and disturbance 
 vector f(t) if
 
ΔA ∈ range(B), Q ∈ range(B),
or there exist matrices ΛA and ΛQ (constant or time varying) such that

Selecting discontinuous control in the form (Equation 5.1.7) with manifold 
(Equation 5.1.5) leads to the sliding mode equation (Equation 5.1.6) with 
desired dynamics and invariance property. Assuming that the ranges of 
plant parameter variations and an upper bound of the disturbance vector

disturbances. To soften the control action, it would be desirable to reduce 
the control amplitude in sliding mode if the magnitude of the disturbance 
decreases. Usually, disturbances are not accessible for measurement, which 
is the main obstacle for designing a control system with the above property. 
Nevertheless, the formulated task is solvable if rather fuzzy a priori knowl-
edge on a class of disturbances is available.
Let the disturbance in motion Equation 5.2.1 with ΔA = 0 satisfy the invari-
ance condition in Equation 5.2.2 and let Q be a constant matrix. Then the 
system may be represented in the regular form

It is assumed that neither initial conditions nor functions θi(t) are measured, 
and only ranges ϑi0 are known. Equation 5.3.2 embraces a rather wide class 
of disturbances. For example, for k = 2, it includes exponential and harmonic 
functions, polynomials of any fi nite power (beginning from a certain time), 
all kinds of products of these functions, etc.

will occur with the desired dynamics and invariance properties with respect 
to disturbances. 
The objective of the design was to decrease the magnitude of control 
with decreasing disturbances without measurement of the disturbances. 
This is the case for our system: in the solution to Equation 5.3.13, x t
1( )and 
x t
2( ) tend to zero, which means that functions u(i) tend to −ΛQf(i) (Equation 
5.3.7); because u(i) (i = 1,…,k − 1) are components of vector u, and the control 
v (Equation 5.3.12) decreases with the disturbances. The output of the addi-
tional dynamic system u is a continuous function and tends to −ΛQf, which 
leads to disturbance rejection. In real systems, often there is no need to intro-
duce an additional dynamic system; its part may be played by actuators with 
outputs usually accessible for measurement. Then, an actuator input is the 
control to be designed, and its magnitude depends on disturbances and their 
derivatives.
Example 5.1
The disturbance rejection method will be illustrated with a second-order system 
in which the plant and actuator are integrators (Figure 5.1).
An external disturbance f(t) is applied to the plant and is not accessible for 
measurement. The control u is designed as a piecewise linear function of the 
controlled value x = x1, which should be reduced to zero but also of the actuator 
output y. Then the behavior of the plant and the system is governed by the systems 
of the ﬁ rst and second order, respectively,

As shown for a similar second-order system with no disturbance in Section 2.1 
(with f(t) ≡ 0), the coefﬁ cients of control can be selected such that the state reaches 
the switching line and sliding mode is enforced at each point of this line. After 
some ﬁ nite time interval, the state tends to zero in sliding mode with motion 
equation x

system are shown in Figure 1.9, and the state plane of the asymptotically stable

 of each of the four linear structures, corresponding to the four com-

and Figure 5.2.B separately shows right and left semiplanes of the system state 
plane for the area |x2| ≤ f(t), where, by virtue of the plant equation, sign(u) = 
−sign(f(t)). The ﬁ rst-order actuator takes part of an additional dynamic system 
(Equation 5.3.4); therefore, the disturbance f(t) is assumed to satisfy the condi-
tions in Equation 5.3.2 for k = 1:

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
As can be seen from the state plane, the singular points are shifted such that the 
state trajectories in the vicinity of the switching line s = 0 are directed toward 
it and sliding mode occurs in the system.* The same conclusion can be made 
analytically. Because sign(u) = −sign(f(t)), the term Ψu f in the motion equation is 
equal to −β|f|sign(s) and for the points x2 = −cx1 on the switching line

The values of s and s have opposite signs, or the conditions in Equation 2.4.1 for 
sliding mode to exist hold for α > c2 + β and an arbitrary positive δ. Thus, the 
change of signs in the main and local feedback enables one to reject unmeasured 
disturbances. 
5.4. Ackermann’s Formula
Ackermann’s formula enables us to determine a linear state-feedback scalar 
control law in explicit form resulting in a system with desired eigenvalues 
[Ackermann 1992]. A similar task arises when designing sliding model con-
trol in linear systems with a linear discontinuity surface because the corre-
sponding sliding mode equation is linear and depends on the coeffi cients of 
the surface equation.
The traditional approach to sliding mode control design implies trans-
forming the linear system into the regular form (Section 5.1) consisting of 
two blocks and handling the state vector of one of the blocks as a fi ctitious 
control.
In this section, the design method of scalar sliding mode control rests 
on Ackermann’s formula and is oriented toward obtaining a discontinu-
ity plane equation in explicit form as well in terms of the original system 
without transforming it into regular form [Ackermann and Utkin 1998]. For 
a linear plant operating under uncertainty conditions, the control enforces 
sliding motions governed by a linear equation with the desired eigenvalue 
placement and independent of disturbance.
Consider a controllable system described by a differential equation,
 
x
Ax
b u
f x t
=
+
+
(
)
( , ) , 
(5.4.1)
where x is an n-dimensional state vector, u is a scalar control, A and b are 
known matrix and vector, and f(x,t) is a nonlinear disturbance with known 
upper bound |f(x,t)| < f0(x,t). As follows from Equation 5.4.1, the control and 
disturbance vectors (bu and bf) are collinear, so the invariance condition 
(Equation 5.2.2) is satisfi ed, and, consequently, the sliding mode in any plane 
is invariant with respect to the disturbance.
The design of sliding mode control in Equation 5.4.1 implies the selec-
tion of a plane s = cTx = 0 (cT is an n-dimensional constant row vector) and 
consequently design of the control enforcing the sliding mode in s = 0. The 
sliding mode equation is of the (n−1)th order and does not depend on the 
 disturbance. The desired dynamic properties may be provided by a proper

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
choice of the vector c. Traditionally, the sliding mode equation is derived fi rst 
and then the conventional methods of the linear theory are applied.
As mentioned above, the aim of this section is to show how the vector c 
may be found in an explicit form without the sliding motion equation using 
Ackermann’s formula, as far as the eigenvalue placement task is concerned.
The desired eigenvalues λ1, λ2,….,λn of linear system x

where 
 
eT = [0 … 0 1][b Ab … An−1b]−1
 
P(λ) = (λ − λ1)(λ − λ2)…(λ − λn−1)(λ − λn).
Suppose now that the real or pairwise conjugate complex values λ1, λ2,….,λn−1 
are the desired eigenvalues of the sliding mode.
Theorem 5.1 
If
 
cT = eT P1(A) 
(5.4.3)
with P1(λ) = (λ − λ1)(λ − λ2)…(λ − λn−1) = p1 + p2λ + … + pn−1λn−2 + λn−1, then 
λ1, λ2,…,λn−1 are the eigenvalues of the sliding mode dynamics in the plane 
s = cTx = 0.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
□
Proof 4.1
According to Ackermann’s formula (Equation 5.4.2), λ1, λ2,…,λn are eigenval-
ues of the matrix A* = A − bkT, with λn being an arbitrary value. Vector cT is a 
left eigenvector of A* corresponding to λn. Indeed, as follows from Equations 
5.4.2 and 5.4.3
 
cTA* = cTA − cTbeT P(A).

which reduces with Equation 5.4.3 to 
 
cTA* = λncT

and means that cT is a left eigenvalue of A*, correspodning to eigenvalue λn.

The spectrum of matrix A1 consists of desired eigenvalues λ1, λ2,…, λn−1.
To derive the sliding mode equation in the plane s = 0, the solution to the

The result has a transparent geometric interpretation. Vector cT is a left 
eigenvector of the matrix A* corresponding to the eigenvalue λn. This means 
that the plane s = cTx = 0 is an invariant subspace of A* with the motion deter-
mined by the previously selected set of (n − 1) eigenvalues λ1, λ2,…., λn−1. If 
sliding mode is enforced in the plane s = cTx = 0, then it exhibits the desired 
dynamics. Note that the design of the plane s = cTx = 0 does not imply assign-

ing the eigenvalue λn; it only appears in the proof of the theorem and may 
take an arbitrary value.
The discontinuous control u is designed to enforce sliding mode in the 
plane s = 0. This implies that the conditions in Equation 2.4.1 should be satis-
fi ed, i.e., the values of s and s should have different signs in some vicinity of 
the plane,

where M(x,t) is chosen such that 
 
M(x,t) > |CT Ax| + f0(x,t).
If the control may take only two extreme values +M0 or −M0 (which is com-
mon in applications), then Equation 5.4.9 with M(x,t) = M0 enforces a sliding 
mode in the plane s = 0 governed by Equation 5.4.8 as well. Of course, the 
domain of initial conditions and the disturbance should be bounded.

The design procedure based on Ackermann’s formula is summarized as 
follows.
Step 1: The desired spectrum of the sliding motion λ1, λ2,….λn−1 is 
selected.
Step 2: The equation of the discontinuity plane s = cTx = 0 is found as
 
cT = eT(A − λ1I)(A − λ2I)…(A − λn−1I).
Step 3: The discontinuous control (Equation 5.4.9) is designed.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Mt and m are masses of the trolley and pendulum, a is the pendulum length, 
c is the spring stiffness, g = 9.81m/s2, u and f(t) are control and disturbance 
forces, and |f(t)| ≤ f0 = const, in which f0 is assumed to be known.
Sliding mode control is designed for Mt = 5, m = 1, a = 1, c = 1. Let λ1 = −1, 
λ2 = −2, λ3 = −3 be the desired eigenvalues of sliding motion. According to 
Equation 5.4.3, the discontinuity plane equation 
 
s = cTx = 0,
 
cT = [0 0 0 1][b Ab A2b A3b]−1 (A + I)(A + 2I)(A + 3I),
I is an identity matrix,
 
cT = [−4.77 48.4 −8.75 18.7].
The control is assumed to take two extreme values only:
 
u = −M0sign(s), M0 = const.
As follows from the above studies, for any M0 > f0, there exits a domain of 
initial conditions such that sliding mode is enforced in the plane s = 0.
The simulation examples are given for sliding mode control with 
 
M0 = 40 and f(t) = f0sin(3t), f0 = 0.5.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
The system without feedback is unstable and control is bounded; therefore, 
the motion may turn to be unstable should initial conditions be increased. 
The system is still stable for α(0) = 0.38 (Figure 5.5) and becomes unstable 
with α(0) = 0.39 (Figure 5.6). As mentioned in Remark 5.1, sliding mode may 
be enforced in an unperturbed system (f(t) = 0) for arbitrary initial condi-
tions with piecewise linear control

5.5. Output Feedback Sliding Mode Control
Implementation of the design methods developed in the previous sections 
implies that all components of a state vector have to be accessible for mea-
surement. However, this is not the case for many practical situations. Two 
approaches may be studied for these cases. The fi rst method is the design of 
state observers to restore the state vector using available measurements of 
some states, and the second method is to derive a class of systems such that 
the control task may be solved by designing a static output feedback control-
ler. The second approach to sliding mode control design under incomplete 
information on the system states is studied in this section. The observer 
design methods are studied in Chapter 6.

The system (Equations 5.5.1 and 5.5.2) is referred to as output pole assign-
able if the eigenvalues of matrix A + BLC or of a feedback system with linear 
control u = Ly (L is a constant m × l matrix) take any desired values. The 
class of such linear systems may be found based on the well-known result 
by Kimura [1975]:

Now we deal with a pole placement task for a reduced order controllable 
system with an (l − m)-dimensional output vector. The condition of Kimura’s 
Theorem 5.2 may be reformulated for eigenvalue placement of system 
(Equations 5.5.7 and 5.5.8):
Theorem 5.3
If the original system in Equations 5.5.1 and 5.5.2 is controllable and the sys-
tem in Equations 5.5.7 and 5.5.8 is observable and satisfi es the relation
 
(n − m) ≤ (l − m) + m* −1  m* = rank A12, 
(5.5.9)
then it is pole assignable by gain output feedback.

takes the desired values.
Because m* ≤ m, the condition in Equation 5.45 n ≤ l + m* −1 means that the 
original system (Equations 5.5.1 and 5.5.2) is pole assignable by gain out-
put feedback if the reduced-order system (Equations 5.5.7 and 5.5.8) is pole 
assignable. 
If the pair (C11, A*) is not observable, the same procedure is applicable to 
the observable part of x1. The unobservable system (Equations 5.5.7 and 5.5.8) 
may be presented in the form [Kwakernaak and Sivan 1972]

5.6. Control of Time-Varying Systems
Design of desired dynamics of time-varying control systems is a consid-
erably more diffi cult task than that for the systems with constant param-
eters, because the properties of time-varying systems cannot be interpreted 
in terms of their eigenvalues. Decoupling system motions into motions of 
lower dimension enables one to simplify the control design. Therefore, it is 
of interest to apply sliding mode control methodology to reduce the order of 
the motion equations. We will follow the so-called “block control principle” 
[Drakunov et al. 1990] for reducing the original design problem to a set of 
independent problems with lower dimensions.

where α and δ are positive constants. The coeffi cient α may be found such 
that, for any positive δ, the conditions in Equation 2.4.1 hold for any function 
si. Then sliding mode exists on each plane si = 0 and their intersection s = 0.
Although design of desired dynamics in sliding mode is easier than for the 
original system, we deal with a time-varying system, and special methods 
should be used for stabilization. We will discuss one of them resulting in 
exponentially stable time-varying systems.
The idea of the design procedure is to decouple the fi rst system in Equation 
5.6.3 with intermediate control x2 into two subsystems similarly to transfor-
mation in Equation 5.6.2 applied to the original system. If m ≤ n − m and rank 
(A12) = m, then the fi rst system in Equation 5.6.3 may be transformed into

in Equations 5.6.12 and 5.6.13 hold and s1 will be governed by autonomous 
Equation 5.6.11. As follows from the fi rst equation of Equation 5.6.6 and 5.6.8

Sliding Mode Observers
All design methods of the previous chapters, except for Section 5.5, 
were developed under the assumption that the state vector is available. 
In practice, however, only a part of its components may be measured 
directly. The output feedback sliding mode control method of Section 5.5 
is applicable to rather limited types of systems. An alternative approach 
is designing asymptotic observers, which are dynamic systems for esti-
mating all the components of the state vector using those measured 
directly. First, we will study the conventional full-order and reduced 
order observers intended for linear time-invariant systems Next, we 
present sliding mode modifi cations for state observation of time-invari-
ant [Utkin 1992] and time-varying systems with disturbance estimation 
[Hashimoto et al. 1990 ].
6.1. Linear Asymptotic Observers
The idea underlying observer design methods may be illustrated for a linear 
time-invariant system (Equation 5.1.1) as shown:
 
x
Ax
Bu
=

(6.1.1)
with output vector
 
y = Cx, y ∈ ℜl, C = const, rank(C) = l. 
(6.1.2)
The pair (C, A) is assumed to be observable.
A linear asymptotic observer is designed in the same form as the original 
system (Equation 6.1.1) with an additional input depending on the mismatch 
between the real (Equation 6.1.2) and estimated values of the output vector:

(6.1.3)
where ˆx is an estimate of the system state vector, L ∈ ℜn×l is an input matrix.
Of course the state vector of the observer ˆx is available because the auxil-
iary dynamic system is implemented in a controller. The motion equation

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
The behavior of the mismatch governed by homogenous Equation 6.1.4 is 
determined by eigenvalues of matrix A + CL. For observable systems, they 
may be assigned arbitrarily by a proper choice of input matrix L [Kwakernaak 
and Sivan 1972]. It means that any desired rate of convergence of the mis-
match to zero or estimate ˆ( )
x t  to state vector x(t) may be provided. Then any 
full state control algorithms with vector ˆ( )
x t  are applicable.
The order of the observer may be reduced because of the fact that rank(C) = 
l and the observed vector may be represented as

 (the coordinate trans-

rests on coordinate transformation

Again, if the original system is observable, the eigenvalues of matrix 
A11 + L1A21 may be assigned arbitrarily [Kwakernaak and Sivan 1972]. It means 
that ′
x  tends to zero and ˆ′
x  tends to x′ at any desired rate. The components of 
the state vector x1 and x2 are thus found from Equations 6.1.5 and 6.1.7.
6.2. Observers for Linear Time-Invariant Systems
Let us proceed to the design of a state observer with inputs as discontinu-
ous functions of mismatches in which motion preceding sliding mode and 
motion in the intersection of discontinuity surfaces may be handled inde-
pendently. The observer is described by differential equations

(6.2.2)
As shown in Section 2.4, the sliding mode is enforced in the manifold y = 0 
if the matrix multiplying ν in the second equation of Equation 6.2.2 is nega-
tive defi nite and M takes high but fi nite value. It is the case for our system 
because ν is multiplied by a negative identity matrix. Hence, for bounded 
initial conditions, sliding mode can be enforced in manifold y = 0. As follows 
from the equivalent control methods, the solution νeq to equation y = 0 should 
be substituted into the fi rst equation of Equation 6.2.2 with y = 0 to derive the 
sliding mode equation

which coincides with Equation 6.1.9. Hence, the desired rate of convergence 
of x1 to zero and convergence of ˆx1 to x1 can be provided by a proper choice of 
matrix L1, and then x2 is found from Equation 6.1.5.
The observer with the input as a discontinuous function of the mismatch 
(Equation 6.2.2) in sliding mode is equivalent to the reduced order observer 
(Equation 6.1.8). However, if the plant and observed signal are affected by 
noise, the nonlinear observer may happen to be preferable as a result of fi l-
tering properties because its structure coincides with that of a Kalman fi lter 
[Drakunov 1983].

block-observable form, if the rank l0 and the principle minor position of the 
time-varying matrix C(t) do not vary in time. In this case, after reordering

components of vector y, and the system can be transformed to the block -
observable form using Equation 6.3.5.
The above procedure leads to block -observable forms for 0 < l0 < n. The 
l0 = 0 case implies that the original system is unobservable (under the assump-
tion that the position of the principle minor does not vary in time). For 
l0 = n, the state vector may be obtained directly as a solution of the equation 
y = C(t)x.
Treating vector A

tem in Equation 6.3.4 and assuming that the rank and position of the princi-

6.3.3 can be represented in block -observable form. The rank of A

For l1 < n − l0, the subsystem in Equation 6.3.4 can be represented in block-
observable form again (l1 > 0, otherwise the system in Equations 6.3.1 and

that of xi−1, the procedure terminates after a fi nite number of steps.

methods for chattering suppression.

Because the disturbance is assumed to be zero, only the state estimation is 
considered. The initial values of the observer state are equal to zero. 
Because the sampling interval Ts confi nes the switching frequency, the fi l-

6.4. Observer for Linear Systems with Binary Output
As long as a linear system with an output as a linear function of the state is 
observable, the state variables can be estimated using conventional observ-
ers, although robustness to disturbance and modeling uncertainty need to be 
considered further. However, the conventional observer approach is not fea-
sible when a binary sensor limits output information to the sign of the out-
put. An example is the oxygen sensor of an air/fuel ratio control  system for 
internal combustion engines. Its reading indicates only whether the  control 
output is higher or lower than the desired value.
A design methodology for such systems was developed by Drakunov and 
Utkin [1995] and Kim, Rizzoni, and Utkin  [1998]. The two-stage observer 
was proposed to consist of a discrete time-varying observer to estimate 
the states at each sensor switching instant and of a continuous system to 
estimate the state trajectory between the switching instants. Generally 
speaking, the observer equations are time varying, and the conventional 
eigenvalue placement methodology is not applicable. The observer design 
approach described below overcomes this diffi culty and guarantees 
convergence.

(6.4.2)
If the zk values are known exactly for the entire process, the estimation of the 
states becomes an initial-value problem with known initial conditions: if all 
the states are available at every sensor switching instants 
 
y = zk , 
(6.4.3)
then estimation of the continuous state variables during the sensor switch-
ing interval becomes the initial value problem with the state variables at the 
switching instant tk as the initial condition. Consequently, the state trajectory 
until the next sensor switching instant tk+1 can be calculated by

(6.4.4)
However, if information on the zk values is limited, as is the case with the 
binary sensor measurement, a discrete observer is needed to estimate the 
discrete sequence zk. Then, the continuous states x(t) can be obtained by 
using the discrete estimation as an initial value during the sensor switch-
ing intervals (i.e., the time interval between tk and tk+1) according to Equation 
6.4.4. Now the measurement equation becomes 
 
yk = sign(Czk − b). 
(6.4.5)
As mentioned above, the observer design procedure is divided into two 
steps. The fi rst step consists of estimating the state variables at each switch-
ing instant of the binary sensor, i.e., ˆzk= estimation of zk at time tk. The second 
step consists of estimating the states between the sensor switching times, i.e., 
ˆ( )
x t is equal to estimation of x(t) for the time interval between tk and tk+1. This 
two-step procedure leads to a continuous estimate of the state variables for 
the entire process. 
Using the defi nition given in Equation 6.4.3, the discrete system (defi ned 
only at sensor switching instant) can be expressed as follows:

Integral Sliding Mode
The robustness property of conventional sliding mode control with 
respect to variations of system parameters and external disturbances 
can only be achieved after the occurrence of sliding mode. During the 
reaching phase, however, there is no guarantee for robustness. Integral 
sliding mode seeks to eliminate the reaching phase by enforcing sliding 
mode throughout the entire system response. Different from the con-
ventional design approach, the order of the motion equation in integral 
sliding mode is equal to the order of the original system rather than 
reduced by the dimension of the control input. As a result, robustness 
of the system can be guaranteed starting from the initial time instant. 
Uniform formulations of this new sliding mode design principle will be 
developed in this chapter. It is shown with examples that this general-
ized scheme of integral sliding mode enables a wide scope of applica-
tion areas, including control in robotics and electric drives. The concept 
of integral sliding mode can also be extended to construct a new type of 
perturbation estimator that solves the chattering problem without loss 
of robustness and control accuracy. Additional details on integral slid-
ing mode can be found in the work of Utkin and Shi [1996]. 
7.1. Motivation
Sliding mode plays a dominant role in variable structure systems (VSS) the-
ory. The core idea of designing VSS control algorithms consists of enforcing 
sliding mode in some manifold of state space. Traditionally, these mani-
folds are constructed as the intersection of hyper-surfaces in the state space. 
This intersection domain is normally called switching manifold. Once the 
system reaches the switching plane, the structure of the feedback loop is 
adaptively altered to slide the system state along the switching plane; the 
system response depends thereafter on the gradient of the switching plane 
and remains insensitive to variations of system parameters and external dis-
turbances under so-called matching conditions (Section 3.3). The order of the 
motion equation in sliding mode is equal to (n
m
−
), with n being the dimen-
sion of the state space and m the dimension of the control input. However, 
during the reaching phase, i.e., before sliding mode occurs, the system pos-
sesses no such insensitivity property; therefore, insensitivity can not be 
ensured throughout an entire response.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
As an extension of traditional sliding mode schemes, the concept of inte-
gral sliding mode concentrates on robustness during the entire response. 
The order of the motion equation in this new type of sliding mode is equal 
to the dimension of the plant model. Therefore, sliding mode is established 
without a reaching phase, implying that the invariance of the system to para-
metric uncertainty and external disturbances is guaranteed starting from 
the initial time instant. This chapter generalizes the sliding mode control 
concept and emphasizes the background philosophy used for developing 
such new variable structure systems. 
We assume that there already exists an ideal system consisting of a nominal 
plant model and a properly designed feedback control. To this existing control-
ler, a discontinuous term is added based on integral sliding mode to ensure 
the desired performance despite parametric uncertainty and external distur-
bances. Design examples in some application areas are given to illustrate the 
methodology of this design philosophy. The basic idea of integral sliding mode 
for linear systems can be found in the work of Ackermann and Utkin [1994].
Integral sliding mode may also be used to prevent chattering in a control 
loop, often caused by controller discontinuities exciting unmodeled dynam-
ics. For chattering prevention, the discontinuous control term is low-pass 
fi ltered before being fed to the plant, thus moving the discontinuity to an 
auxiliary control loop without unmodeled dynamics to be excited. The fi l-
tered control acts as a perturbation compensator and preserves the invari-
ance property of sliding mode. The chattering prevention aspect of integral 
sliding mode is discussed in detail in Section 8.5. 
This chapter only deals with uncertainties that satisfy the matching condi-
tions. For systems with unmatched uncertainties, the readers are referred to 
the work of Cao and Xu [2004] and Castaños and Fridman [2006].

where x0 represents the state trajectory of the ideal system under control u0. 
However, in practical applications, the system in Equation 7.2.1 operates 
under uncertainty conditions that may be generated by parameter variations, 
unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances. Under this consideration, 
the real trajectory of the closed-loop control system may be summarized by

7.4. Perturbation and Uncertainty Estimation
A crucial part of the nature of sliding mode control schemes is the control dis-
continuity. In closed loop, the “switching” in the control action often results 
in high-frequency oscillations in practical implementations. Fast dynam-
ics, like those of actuators and sensors, which were neglected in the control 
design process, are excited by the sliding mode control switches, occurring 
at high but fi nite frequencies. This phenomenon, common to all high-gain 
control systems, is referred to as chattering.
Several methods have been presented in the literature to alleviate chatter-
ing. The key idea is to limit the controller gain or the controller bandwidth. A 
detailed discussion of the causes of chattering and the various tools to prevent 
this phenomenon can be found in Chapter 8. The remainder of this section is 
devoted to a brief description of using integral sliding mode to design per-
turbation estimators, rejecting overall system perturbations that satisfy the 
matching condition, with the chattering level being signifi cantly reduced.
As mentioned above, high-gain controllers are frequently limited by loop 
dynamics, especially by actuator dynamics preventing direct implementa-
tion of sliding mode schemes. Conversely, discontinuous control inputs are 
often prescribed by the nature of the system, e.g., by conventional pulse 
width modulation (PWM) units in power electronics. To resolve such seem-
ingly contradictory specifi cations, recall that the actual effect of a discontin-
uous controller on a given plant is equal to the average of the control action, 
the so-called equivalent control (see Section 2.3).

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
With this in mind, reformulate the integral sliding mode principle in 
Section 7.3 in terms of a perturbation estimator. Instead of Equation 7.3.1, 
change the control input to
 
u
u
u eq
=
+
0
1 . 
(7.4.1)
However, the control in Equation 7.4.1 cannot be implemented directly because 
the equivalent value of discontinuous control u1 depends on unknown dis-
turbance h x,t
(
) in Equation 7.2.3. It was shown in Section 2.4 that the equiva-
lent value of a discontinuous control is equal to the average value measured 
by a fi rst-order linear fi lter, with the discontinuous control as its input. The 
time constant of the fi lter should be suffi ciently fast such that the plant and 
disturbance dynamics are allowed to pass through the fi ltering without sig-
nifi cant phase lag. Therefore, substitute u

where the time constant μ should be selected small enough not to distort the 
slow component of the switched action, equal to u eq
1 . In most practical appli-
cations, the frequency spectrum of perturbation to be compensated for does 
not overlap with the high-frequency components of the switching unit.
One may be tempted to ask the following: if the discontinuity in the real 
control path is smoothed, how can sliding mode be generated? Furthermore, 
does u av
1  (= u eq
1 ) still cancel the perturbation term uh? As shown in the sequel, 
these questions can be answered positively, if the discontinuous control u1 is 
shifted from the plant input to the input of an auxiliary dynamic system.

Design the same discontinuous control for u1 as shown in Equation 7.3.9 
and assume that matrix ∂

( ) is nonsingular during the entire system

Solving for u1 after setting s = 0 in Equation 7.4.5 reveals that u

as well, implying that u av
1  (= u eq
1 ) is indeed an estimate of the perturbation 
term uh. In this case, Equation 7.4.4 can be interpreted as an internal dynamic 
process for generating sliding mode defi ned by Equation 7.4.3; discontinu-
ity appears only in the internal process; thus, no chattering is excited in the 
real control path. Moreover, because u av
1  cancels the perturbation u h
1  without 
precise knowledge of the system model and associated parameters, a high 
degree of robustness is maintained. The information needed for this control 
scheme is the upper bound of the perturbation. From a conceptual point of 
view, integral sliding mode is used here only for estimating the system per-
turbation rather than for the purpose of control. The control action to the real 
plant will be continuous and is signifi cantly enhanced by the perturbation 
compensator.

To suppress the perturbation caused by modeling uncertainty, design a 
robust controller based on the proposed integral sliding mode principle and 
show that the ideal closed-loop error dynamics as given by Equation 7.5.14 
can still be achieved.
Because the disturbance torque τ p contains q, which is a function of the 
control input τ

disturbance, it is necessary to reformulate the system model such that the

Once sliding mode occurs and the system is confi ned to the manifold s t( ) = 0,

did not exist.
7.5.3. Pulse-Width Modulation for Electric Drives
In contrast to the examples in Sections 7.5.1 and 7.5.2, the integral sliding 
mode design philosophy is directly exploited to implement the PWM in an 
electric drive system instead of applying Equations 7.3.3 and 7.3.7. Without 
loss of generality, an electric drive supplied by a power converter can be 
described by the affi ne dynamic system like
 
x

(7.5.28)
where x

Rm

 is the 
control voltages taking only two values, −u0 and +u0, with u0 being the DC-
Bus (also called DC-link or link) voltage. For fi eld-oriented control design (see 
Chapter 10), Equation 7.5.28 is often transformed into a rotating coordinate 
system aligned with one of the fl ux vectors (rotor fl ux or stator fl ux). Using 
a transformation matrix T, a nonlinear projector with sinusoidal entries, the 
system Equation 7.5.28 may be transformed into the new coordinate system, 
denoted as ( , )

where udq is the new control input in coordinate system ( , )

the control udq has been determined to satisfy the given specifi cations. The 
task then is to transform the control udq back to the original coordinate sys-
tem using the inverse transformation T −1 (if matrix T is not a square matrix, 
the pseudo-inverse will be used; see Chapter 10). Denote this transformed 
control as u*and let

Now the question arises, how to obtain the actual control u for the system in 
Equation 7.5.28, which may only take two discontinuous values −u0 and +u0 
and should be exactly equivalent to u*?
The solution is to make the equivalent value of the control u to be equal to 
the equivalent value of u*, i.e. u

It is obvious that sliding mode can be enforced if the DC-Bus voltage satisfi es

* , or, in other words, the DC-Bus voltage should be high enough to 
enforce the desired motion.
An example of applying sliding mode PWM to the current control of per-
manent-magnet synchronous motors can be found in Section 10.2.3.
7.5.4.  Robust Current Control for Permanent-Magnet 
Synchronous Motors
For high-performance operation of permanent-magnet synchronous motors 
(PMSM), current control may be implemented using the so-called fi eld-
oriented control (FOC) approach (see Chapter 10 for more details). From 
a control point of view, this control approach uses a state transformation, 
after which the decoupling and linearization tasks can be performed eas-
ily. However, high-performance FOC needs precise knowledge of the motor 
parameters. Practically, those parameters cannot be known exactly because, 
fi rst, the model used for FOC is a simplifi ed motor model; second, the motor 
parameters are normally obtained by an identifi cation procedure in which 
errors are always present; and third, these parameters may vary with the 
rotor position and ambient temperature. As a result, the motor torque and 
the motor fl ux cannot be controlled independently, resulting in torque pulsa-
tion and lower effi ciency.
Two solutions exist for solving this problem, namely, adaptive  control and 
robust control. Adaptive control recursively calculates the motor  parameters 
depending on the state measurements, whereas robust control tries to 
 suppress the parameter uncertainty using high control gains. The former 
involves a high computational overhead and an additional  convergence

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
 problem, while the latter may result in low control effi ciency and may excite 
high frequency unmodeled dynamics. In the following, we propose two ver-
sions of control approaches based on integral sliding mode. These control 
strategies belong to the category of robust control. However, as one can see 
from the second version of the control design based on the perturbation esti-
mation described in Section 7.4, the control approach is actually an adap-
tation to the system perturbation, resulting in continuous control actions 
suitable to interface with a conventional PWM unit.
In the (d q
, ) synchronously rotating reference frame (see Section 10.2.2 for 
the details of modeling a PMSM in different coordinate frames), the voltage 
equations of a PMSM are expressed by the following nonlinear differential 
equations

In practice, parameters L, R, and λ are not known exactly. For the control 
design, the nominal values of these parameters, denoted as L0, R0, and λ0, are 
used. In the ideal case with L

Integral Sliding Mode 
155
As long as inequalities in Equations 7.5.42 and 7.5.46 hold, sliding mode can 
be enforced. Otherwise, stability of sliding mode is not guaranteed, which 
means that the parameter uncertainties cannot be fully compensated. This is 
one of the drawbacks of the fi rst version of control design.
Another drawback of the fi rst version algorithm lies in the fact that the 
resulting controllers ud and uq are diffi cult to be implemented by a conven-
tional PWM unit, because they contain a discontinuous part. It should be 
noted that the standard FOC relies on a PWM unit to adopt the continuous 
controller ud0 and uq0 for the discontinuous control voltages of PMSM motors. 
However, ud and uq as defi ned in Equation 7.5.36 are a mixture of continuous 
and discontinuous parts. After the coordinate transformation, i.e., from the 
(
)
d q
,
 frame to the stator ( ,
)
α β  frame resulting in uα and uβ (and if necessary 
further to the phase coordinate frame resulting in ua, ub and uc), they should 
be applied to the PWM unit. If these controls contain a discontinuous part, 
the associated sudden jumps in the PWM duty ratio may be harmful to the 
used power converter. 
Now let us modify the control design such that the above-mentioned draw-
backs will be solved, resulting in the second version of control approach 
based on the perturbation estimator, as discussed in Section 7.4. 
The controls ud and uq are of similar form to Equation 7.5.36:

They are exactly the same as the perturbation terms identifi ed in the fi rst ver-
sion of current control (see Equations 7.5.43 and 7.5.47). The above derivations 
show that the system perturbations are indeed compensated by ud1 and uq1.
Now ud1 and uq1 are continuous and thus acceptable for the PWM unit. 
Because the dynamics defi ned by Equation 7.5.51, which contain the discon-
tinuous controls ud1 and uq1, are calculated in the control computer, ud1 and 
uq1 are not sent to the real control path, so that Md and Mq are independent 
from the DC-Bus voltage and can be selected as high as required to enforce 
sliding mode.
Remark 7.1
If the resulting ud1 and uq1 are too high such that u
u
d
q
2
2

 exceeds the DC-
Bus voltage, the system perturbations cannot be compensated completely. 
However, the perturbation estimation given by Equation 7.5.56 remains true. 
This case indicates that the system disturbances are too large and cannot be 
fully compensated by any control algorithm. 
Another example of using the perturbation estimation concept will be 
given in Chapter 12, showing the effectiveness of this control scheme in the 
torque control of a fl exible robot joint. In this application, the mass of inertia 
of the motor rotor and of the link, the joint stiffness, and the frictions at both 
motor and link sides are assumed to be unknown.
7.6. Summary
This chapter has developed a new sliding mode design concept: integral 
 sliding mode. The proposed uniform formulation of the integral sliding mode 
enables a wide scope of applications. The main advantage of this new design 
principle is that the robustness provided by sliding mode can be guaranteed 
throughout an entire response of the system starting from the initial time 
instant. We emphasized the basic idea and the background philosophy used 
to develop such a new sliding mode design approach. Furthermore, applica-
tion examples of practical systems were discussed in detail. The chattering 
effect, which was a major drawback of sliding mode control, is reduced using 
the proposed algorithms, while preserving the robustness and the accuracy 
of the control system.

The Chattering Problem
Almost ever since sliding mode ideas have been put forward, the audible 
noise some sliding mode controllers exhibit has irritated control engi-
neers and often has led to resentments, even rejection of the technique. 
The phenomenon is best known as chattering. Two main causes have 
been identifi ed: First, fast dynamics in the control loop, which were 
neglected in the system model, are often excited by the fast switching of 
sliding mode controllers. Second, digital implementations in microcon-
trollers with fi xed sampling rates may lead to discretization chatter. 
This chapter concentrates on the fi rst cause, the unmodeled dynamics 
in the control loop, and introduces multiple methods to reliably prevent 
chattering. Sliding mode in discrete-time systems without discretization 
chatter is discussed in Chapter 9.
8.1. Problem Analysis
The term chattering describes the phenomenon of fi nite-frequency, fi nite-
amplitude oscillations appearing in many sliding mode implementations. 
These oscillations are caused by the high-frequency switching of a sliding 
mode controller exciting unmodeled dynamics in the closed loop. “Unmodeled 
dynamics” may be those of sensors and actuators neglected in the principal 
modeling process because they are generally signifi cantly faster than the main 
system dynamics. However, because “ideal” sliding mode systems are infi -
nitely fast, all system dynamics should be considered in the control design.
Fortunately, preventing chattering usually does not require a detailed 
model of all system components. Rather, a sliding mode controller may be fi rst 
designed under idealized assumptions of no unmodeled dynamics. In a sec-
ond design step, possible chattering is to be prevented by one of the methods 
discussed in this chapter. The solution of the chattering problem is of great 
importance when exploiting the benefi ts of a sliding mode controller in a real-
life system. To some extent, chattering, without proper treatment in the control 
design, has been a major obstacle for implementation of sliding mode to a wide 
range of applications. It should be noted that the switching action itself as the 
core of a continuous-time sliding mode system is not referred to as chattering 
because, in the ideal case, the switching is intended and its frequency tends 
to infi nity; chattering, in the terminology of this book, describes undesired 
system oscillations with fi nite frequency caused by system imperfections.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
This section seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of the chattering prob-
lem. Both analytical and numerical studies are used to examine how unmod-
eled dynamics in a closed system with a controller discontinuity are excited, 
leading to oscillations in the system trajectory.
8.1.1. Example System: Model
A simple fi rst-order plant with second-order unmodeled actuator dynamics 
is used as an example for illustration purposes throughout this section. For 
clarity of presentation, we refrain from using a more complex system such 
as the inverted pendulum. The model of the fi rst-order example system with 
state and output x(t) is given by:

(8.1.1)
where a− ≤ a ≤ a+ and 0 < b− ≤ b ≤ b+ are unknown parameters within known 
bounds, w(t) is the control variable, and disturbance d(t) is assumed to be 
uniformly bounded for all operating conditions (x, t) as |d(x, t| ≤ d+. Control 
variable w(t) is the output of an unmodeled actuator with stable dynamics 
dominated by second-order

where u(t) is the actual control input to plant (Equation 8.1.1) and p denotes 
the Laplace variable. In Equation 8.1.2 and in the sequel, a mixed representa-
tion of time domain and frequency (Laplace) domain functions is used for 
ease of presentation, although not formally correct. For example, it is under-
stood in Equation 8.1.2 that time-domain control variable w(t) is the output of 
the low-pass fi lter described by the inverse of the Laplace-transfer function 
in p with time-domain input u(t).
In Equation 8.1.2, ω > 0 is the unknown actuator bandwidth with ω >> a in 
Equation 8.1.1. The small time constant μ

0 was substituted to symbol-
ize that the actuator dynamics are assumed to be signifi cantly faster than the 
system dynamics (Equation 8.1.1).
The goal of control is to make state and output x(t) of the system in 
Equation 8.1.1 track a desired trajectory xd(t) with a known amplitude bound 
as x t

unstable.

8.1.2. Example System: Ideal Sliding Mode
Standard sliding mode control design for the ideal plant (Equation 8.1.1), i.e., 
neglecting actuator dynamics (Equation 8.1.2) by setting w(t) = u(t), defi nes 
the sliding variable as
 
s(t) = xd(t) − x(t)

and the associated sliding mode controller as

Reaching time tsm is a conservative estimate of the maximum time necessary 
to reach s(t) = 0. In practice, sliding mode often occurs earlier.
Subsequently, the system is invariantly confi ned to the manifold s(t) = 0 in 
Equation 8.1.3 despite parametric uncertainty in a and b and unknown dis-
turbance d(x, t). A block diagram of the ideal sliding mode system is shown 
in Figure 8.1.
The behavior of plant (Equation 8.1.1) in sliding mode under control 
(Equation 8.1.4) can be examined using the equivalent control method (see 
also Section 2.3). Because s(t) is invariantly identical to zero after reaching 
the sliding manifold, s t( ) can be formally set to zero. Solving

which can be viewed as an average of the discontinuous control w(t) in 
Equation 8.1.4. Applying equivalent control weq(t) to plant (Equation 8.1.1) 
would result in exactly the same motion trajectory as applying discontin-
uous control w(t) (Equation 8.1.4), which, however, is not possible because 
g(x, t) contains unknown terms. Substitution of weq(t) into Equation 8.1.1 vali-
dates the exact tracking performance in sliding mode with xd(t) = x(t). 
For the simulation of Equation 8.1.1 under control Equation 8.1.4 with 
M = 2.01 in Figure 8.2, initial condition x(0) = 1 was chosen. After reaching the 
sliding manifold s(t) = 0 at t ≈ 0.45 sec, system trajectory x(t) coincides exactly 
with desired xd(t), and control w(t) is switched at very high frequency, creat-
ing a solidly black area. For illustration, equivalent control weq(t) in Equation 
8.1.11 is shown as a white line in this black area in Figure 8.2.b. Setting the 
parameter bounds to a− = a+ = a = 0.5 and b− = b+ = b = 1.0 results in g+ = 2,
which leads to slow convergence to s(t) = 0 attributable to small ξ  ≈ 0.014. 
This slow convergence was chosen to illustrate the reaching process.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
8.1.3. Example System: Causes of Chattering
In a practical application, unmodeled dynamics in the closed-loop-like actu-
ator (Equation 8.1.2) often prevent ideal sliding mode to occur and cause fast, 
fi nite amplitude oscillations. Figure 8.3 shows a block diagram of the closed 
control loop, including the previously neglected actuator dynamics.
To study the causes of these oscillations, fi rst revisit the differences between 
continuous and discontinuous systems. In accordance with singular pertur-
bation theory [for a comprehensive survey, see Kokotovic 1984] for systems 
with continuous motion equations, fast motion components like those of 
actuators for large ω in Equation 8.1.2 decay rapidly provided they are stable 
(as is the case for ω > 0). The slow motion component of plant (Equation 8.1.1) 
thus continuously depends on the steady-state solution of Equation 8.1.2. In 
other words, the algebraic solution of Equation 8.1.2 for μ → 0 may be substi-
tuted into Equation 8.1.1 as an approximation, and continuous control design 
may very well neglect the actuator dynamics. In the case of Equation 8.1.2, 
w = u results as assumed in Figures 8.1 and 8.2.
In systems with discontinuities, the solution to the motion equation 
depends on the small time constants of fast components as well. However, 
unlike in systems with continuous control, discontinuities in the control 
excite the unmodeled dynamics, which lead to oscillations in the state vector. 
This phenomenon is also referred to as chattering in control literature. These 
oscillations are known to result in low control accuracy, high heat losses in 
electrical power circuits, and high wear of moving mechanical parts. 
Figure 8.4 shows the chattering behavior of system Equation 8.1.1 under 
control w(t) of Equation 8.1.4 but with actuator dynamics in Equation 8.1.2 in 
the loop as shown in Figure 8.3. The top graph depicts output x(t) oscillating 
around desired xd(t) after t ≈ 0.5 sec. In the bottom graph, control u(t), shown 
as a solid line, switches with fi nite frequency, whereas output w(t) of the 
actuator, shown as a dotted line, clearly is not able to follow the steps in con-
trol command u(t). Note that an increase of the actuator bandwidth would 
increase the frequency of the square-wave behavior of u(t) but would not

be able to eliminate the oscillations. In fact, in case of a mechanical device 
performing oscillations as in Figure 8.4 at high frequency, audible noise 
often results, which led to the name chattering and is extremely harmful to 
mechanical system components. 
For additional study of the nature of the oscillations, consider the situa-
tion immediately after a switch in control u(t) from u t

actuator differ by 2M. Although the discrepancy between u(t) and w(t) 
decreases after the switch at a rate faster than the motion of system Equation 
8.1.1, u(t) and w(t) are not “close” in the sense of singular perturbation the-
ory [see also Utkin 1993]. Consequently, the small time constants cannot be 
neglected when examining the behavior of a system with discontinuities in 
the motion equation. 
Consider the system trajectories in Figure 8.4. Initially, x(t) converges to 
xd(t) until t ≈ 0.5 sec. Thereafter, instead of tracking xd(t) exactly as in the 
FIGURE 8.4

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
ideal case shown in Figure 8.2, x(t) goes through cycles of divergence and 
convergence. This suggests that the manifold s(t) = xd(t) − x(t) = 0 is attractive 
for large deviations, but the trajectories might diverge in some small vicinity 
ε(μ) of s(t) = 0, where scalar ε depends on the bandwidth of the unmodeled 
actuator dynamics (Equation 8.1.2). The motion trajectory is ultimately con-
fi ned to this vicinity, i.e., |s(t)| ≤ ε; however, inside the ε vicinity, oscillations 
of fi nite frequency and fi nite amplitude occur. 
Stability for large deviations, i.e., for |s(t)| > ε, can be illustrated using the 
fact that u(t) is constant for |s(t)| > ε. The actuator dynamics (Equation 8.1.2) 
decay rapidly because they are stable and w(t) ≈ u(t) after some short time 
interval. In the example of Figure 8.4, the actuator dynamics have decayed 
after less than 0.1 sec. Hence, the stability analysis (Equations 8.1.5 through 
8.1.8) can be used to establish convergence of the system trajectories to s(t) = 0
until the fi rst switching of u(t) takes place, at t ≈ 0.5 sec in the example in 
Figure 8.4. 
To examine the subsequent system behavior, assume steady-state condi-
tions with u(t) = w(t) = − M for |s(t)| > ε. The step response of the actuator for 
the fi rst switch at tsw from u(t) = −M to u(t) = +M  at  s(t) = 0 is given by

(8.1.12)
For some initial time interval Δt = t − tsw, actuator output w(t) < u(t) = M and 
V t( ) > 0 in Equation 8.1.6 results for the case g(x, xd, t)s(t) > 0. Only after the 
decay of the exponential term in Equation 8.1.12, i.e., after Δt(μ), |w(t)| > g+
is established once more and V t( ) < 0 testifi es to the convergence to sliding 
manifold s(t) = 0. During the time interval Δt, the maximum deviation from 
ideal tracking can be approximated by
 
|Δs| ≤ ε(μ) = (g+ + M)Δt(μ). 
(8.1.13)
Similar derivations hold for the next switch from u(t) = +M  to u(t) = −M. 
Summarizing the above shows that, in the nonideal system, s(t) is con-
verging toward zero for |s(t)| > ε. For large deviations from the sliding 
manifold , system (Equation 8.1.1) with unmodeled dynamics (Equation 
8.1.2) under control (Equation 8.1.4) behaves similar to the ideal system, 
converging to the sliding manifold. Hence, its motion is ultimately con-
fi ned to |s(t)| ≤ ε after some fi nite time interval. Inside the ε(μ) vicinity, sta-
bility cannot be guaranteed. In fact, temporary divergence can be shown 
for |s(t)| < ε. 
To qualitatively illustrate the infl uence of unmodeled dynamics on the 
system behavior, consider the simplest case a = 0, d(x, t) = 0, b = 1, xd(t) = 0 in 
Equations 8.1.1 and 8.1.3 as shown in Figure 8.5.

Sliding mode cannot occur in the systems because the time derivative x is a 
continuous time function and cannot have its sign opposite to x in the vicin-
ity of the point x = 0 where the control undergoes discontinuities. 
The value of x* is bounded, and, as follows from the singular perturbation 
theory [see Kokotovic, O’Malley, and Sannuti 1976; Kokotovic 1984], the dif-
ference between x and x* is of μ order. The signs of x and x* coincide beyond 
the ε(μ) vicinity of s(x) = x = 0, hence the magnitudes of x* and x decrease, i.e., 
the state trajectories converge to this vicinity and after a fi nite time interval 
t1 the state remains in the vicinity. According to the analysis of Equations 
8.1.14, the motion in the vicinity of x = 0 is unstable.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
The fact of local instability explains why chattering may appear in the sys-
tems with discontinuous controls at the presence of unmodeled dynamics. 
The high-frequency oscillations in the discontinuous control system may be 
analyzed in time domain as well. 
These brief periods of divergence occur after switches of the control input 
variable u(t) when the output w(t) of the actuator is unable to follow the abrupt 
change of the control command. The proposed solutions to the chattering prob-
lem thus focus on either avoiding control discontinuities in general or move the 
switching action to a controller loop without any unmodeled dynamics. After 
introducing the Describing Function to analyze the frequency and amplitude 
of chattering, the remainder of this chapter will discuss various types of chat-
tering prevention schemes and examine their respective benefi ts.
8.1.4. Describing Function Method for Chattering Analysis
For analyzing the infl uence of mismatch in modeling from neglecting the 
small time constants of actuators and sensors, the describing function 
method can be used to estimate the amplitude and frequency of chattering. 
Intuitively, the amplitude of chattering will be related to amplitude of dis-
continuous control. 
Let us consider the following system with scalar control:

When chattering occurs at high frequency, state components as well as terms

where the vectors a and b are constant. The system in Equation 8.1.18 is 
used to analyze chattering qualitatively. For simplicity, the sliding surface 
is selected as

where M is a positive constant. Now, let us assume that linear sensor dynam-
ics with small time constant μ are disregarded in the model in Equation

subsystem with state vector z (z ∈ ℜm):

(8.1.23)
The time constant μ is a suffi ciently small, positive value, A and B are m × m 
and m × n matrices, respectively. The matrix A is assumed to have eigenval-
ues with negative real parts. Instead of the system state vector x, the control-
ler will use a vector x*(x* ∈ ℜn), which is a linear combination of the elements 
in the sensor state vector z:
 
x* = Hz, 
 (8.1.24)
where H is a constant n × m matrix. Because the controller is using x*, rather 
than the vector x directly from the plant, the sliding mode surface (Equation 
8.1.21) now becomes
 
s* = cx*. 
(8.1.25)

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Because the amplitude of chattering depends on the magnitude of control, 
the intuitive way of chattering reduction is decreasing the control magni-
tude M but ensuring that sliding mode still exists.
8.2. Boundary Layer Solution
The boundary layer solution, proposed by Slotine and Sastry [1983] and 
Slotine [1984], seeks to avoid control discontinuities and switching action in 
the control loop. The control law in Equation 8.1.4 is replaced by a satura-
tion function that approximates the sign(s) term in a boundary layer of the 
manifold s(t) = 0. Numerous types of saturation functions sat(s) have been 
proposed in the literature. 
“In the large”, i.e., for |s(t)| > ε, sat(s) = sign(s). However, in a small ε 
vicinity of the origin, the so-called boundary layer, sat(s) ≠ sign(s) is con-
tinuous. As an illustrative example, consider a simple linear saturation

The fi rst stability bound (Equation 8.2.4) states that the unmodeled dynam-
ics have to be stable and faster than the system dynamics (Equation 8.1.1) 
themselves. The stability boundary (Equation 8.2.5) defi nes the highest 
feedback gain the system (Equation 8.1.1) with actuator dynamics (Equation 
8.1.2) can sustain in the linear sense. Higher gains, in particular theoreti-
cally infi nite gains of discontinuous sliding mode controllers, result in 
instability in the vicinity of s(t) = 0, causing chattering as shown in the 
previous section.

is required. It is interesting to 
note that, in this simple example, the boundary layer width ε depends almost 
linearly on the actuator time constant μ and inverse linearly on the avail-
able control resources M. In the simulation shown in Figure 8.10, ε = 0.1 was 
chosen, which leads to stable but less than critically damped eigenvalues. 
Consequently, small overshoot results when x(t) converges to xd(t).
One of the benefi ts of the boundary layer approach is that sliding mode 
control design methodologies can be exploited to derive a continuous con-
troller. The invariance property of sliding mode control is partially preserved 
in the sense that the system trajectories are confi ned to a δ(ε) vicinity of the 
sliding manifold s(t) = 0, instead of exactly to s(t) = 0 as in ideal sliding mode 
in Figures 8.1 and 8.2. Within the δ(ε) vicinity, however, the system behavior 
is not determined, i.e., further convergence to zero is not guaranteed. This 
type of control design is part of a class of robust controllers that satisfy the 
“globally uniform ultimate boundedness” condition proposed by Leitmann 
[1981]. Note that no real sliding mode takes place because the switching 
action is replaced by a continuous approximation.

The Chattering Problem

8.3. Observer-Based Solution
The boundary layer approach discussed above avoids generating sliding mode 
by replacing the discontinuous switching action with a continuous saturation 
function. In many applications, however, control discontinuities are inherent to 
the system, e.g., in various voltage inputs of power converters or electric drives. 
When implementing a continuous controller, a technique such as PWM has to 
be exploited to adapt the control law to the discontinuous system inputs. In 
light of recent advances of high-speed circuitry and insuffi cient linear control 
methodologies for internally nonlinear high-order plants such as AC motors, 
sliding mode control has become increasingly popular. Commercially avail-
able electronic converters enable handling switching frequencies in the range 
of hundreds of kilohertz. Hence, it seems unjustifi ed to bypass a system’s 
discontinuous control inputs by converting a continuous controller, e.g., via a 
PWM scheme. Rather, such system specifi cations call for alternative methods 
to prevent chattering while preserving control discontinuities.
An asymptotic observer in the control loop can eliminate chattering 
despite discontinuous control laws. The key idea as proposed by Bondarev, 
Bondarev, Kostyleva, and Utkin  [1985] is to generate ideal sliding mode in 
an auxiliary observer loop rather than in the main control loop. Ideal sliding 
mode is possible in the observer loop because it is entirely generated in the 
control software and thus does not contain any unmodeled dynamics. The 
main loop follows the observer loop according to the observer dynamics. 
Despite applying a discontinuous control signal with switching action to the 
plant, no chattering occurs and the system behaves as if an equivalent con-
tinuous control was applied. A block diagram for the example system of this 
chapter with an auxiliary observer is shown in Figure 8.11.

The analytical similarities between the boundary layer approach and the

also apparent in the system trajectories. Compare the simulation of the 
observer-based approach in Figure 8.12 with the boundary layer approach 
simulation in Figure 8.8. Both show similar behavior with a small over-
shoot when reaching the sliding manifold. Note that, for the observer-
based solution, the observed state ˆ( )
x t  achieves ideal sliding mode with 
discontinuous switching action (black area in Figure 8.12), whereas the 
true state x(t) follows according to the observer dynamics without exhibit-
ing chattering.
The observer-based solution requires slightly more effort in the control 
design. However, in many control applications, observers for immeasurable 
states are vital parts of the overall system and can be readily included into

the control design. Note that the design of the actual observer depends on 
the system specifi cations; both full-state and reduced order observers may 
be used. Furthermore, observers provide more fl exibility. For instance, in 
the example studied in this chapter, the observer (Equation 8.3.1) may be 
extended to include an estimate of the disturbance under the assumption

8.4. Regular Form Solution
Both the boundary layer approach and the observer-based solution to the 
chattering problem assume that the unmodeled dynamics are completely 
unknown. In practical applications, however, at least partial information 
about unmodeled dynamics, in particular of actuators, is often available 
together with measurements of the actuator outputs. For example, for electric 
drives, models are readily available but may contain uncertain parameters. 
Thus, in the design of a controller for the overall system, these dynamics can 
be included into the control design to enhance the performance of the overall 
system.
Because the actuator dynamics and the plant dynamics are block separated, 
i.e., the output(s) of the actuator(s) are the input(s) to the plant, a cascaded 
control structure can be designed following the regular form approach or the 
block control principle (see Sections 3.2 and 5.6 or Drakunov et al. [1990a,b]). 
The basic idea is to design a cascaded controller in two steps. In the fi rst step, 
a continuous controller is derived for the plant under the assumption that 
FIGURE 8.13
Tracking performance is improved by increasing the order of the observer in auxiliary control 
loop. After sliding manifold ˆ( )

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
the plant input(s) is (are) the actual control input(s) to the overall system, 
defi ning “desired” actuator output(s) wd(t). In the second step, the actuator 
input(s) u(t), i.e., the real control input(s) of the system, is (are) used to ensure 
the actuator output(s) track the desired output(s) exactly via sliding mode 
control with w(t) = wd(t). This approach is a special case of cascaded control 
structures as applied to the block control principle [Drakunov et al. 1984, 
1990a,b] and the integrator back-stepping method [Krstic, Kanellakopoulos, 
and Kokotovic 1995]. 
The regular form approach to prevent chattering is especially intriguing 
for systems with electrical actuators in which control input discontinuities 
are often imposed by the system specifi cations. Particularly for electrome-
chanical systems, the benefi ts of sliding mode control can be fully exploited 
based on the wealth of available control designs for electric drives and power 
converters (described  in Chapters 10 and 11). 
Assume the main source of unmodeled dynamics in a control loop being 
the actuator as depicted in Figure 8.3. Further assume availability of a model 
for the actuator in Equation 8.1.2, e.g., with uncertain parameters as

input to the overall system, and w(t) is the measurable actuator output. For 
more realistic actuator dynamics, refer to Chapter 10. A block diagram of the 
complete control system is shown in Figure 8.14. Note that the regular form 
approach is not applicable to systems with unmodeled dynamics mainly 
introduced by sensors rather than by actuators because measurement of 
both input(s) and output(s) of the unmodeled dynamics is required. Because 
sensor input(s) are usually not available via measurement(s), other methods 
such as the observer-based approach should be used to prevent chattering.

The Chattering Problem 
181
In the fi rst design step, a continuous auxiliary control law wd(t) is derived 
for plant (Equation 8.1.1) to track desired trajectory xd(t). Although any con-
trol design methodology, linear or nonlinear, can be used, it is important to 
ensure trackability in the face of limited bandwidth actuator dynamics. In 
other words, the rate of the auxiliary controller should be bounded as

(8.4.2)
Depending on the order of the actuator dynamics, additional bounds on 
higher time derivatives of wd(t) might be necessary. For the example system 
(Equation 8.1.1), a fi rst-order linear controller
 
wd(t) = C(xd(t) − x(t)) = Cxe(t)

where μ

μ

−ˆ is the estimation error of the actuator dynamics, and p is the 
Laplace variable. Following the conventional design methodology of sliding 
mode control, it can be shown that the values of s(t) and s t( ) have different 
signs for bounded w t
d( ), w t
d( ) and high enough but fi nite magnitude of con-
trol resource M. Hence, sliding mode is enforced in the manifold s(t) = 0 with 
we(t) decaying to zero as determined by K in Equation 8.4.7. Consequently, 
desired control Equations 8.4.3 or 8.4.5 is directly implemented to plant 
Equation 8.1.1.
In the simulation shown in Figure 8.15, the desired actuator output 
was limited according to the real actuator limits, i.e., −M ≤ wd(t) ≤ M. The 
sliding variable in Equation 8.4.7 converges to zero within fi nite time. 
Thereafter, s(t) = 0 and the control switches at (theoretically) infi nite fre-
quency, resulting in the black solid area in Figure 8.15b. At the same time, 
x(t) converges to desired xd(t), but tracking is not exact because of linear 
control Equation 8.4.3.

8.5. Disturbance Rejection Solution
The regular form solution in the previous section relies on a continuous con-
troller to achieve tracking of the desired trajectory xd(t) by the output x(t) of 
plant Equation 8.1.1. The linear controller Equation 8.4.3 was augmented by 
an estimate of the disturbance g(x, xd, t) in Equation 8.4.5. Often, such an esti-
mate is not readily accessible. The disturbance rejection approach discussed 
in this section provides means to obtain an accurate disturbance estimate 
while avoiding chattering in the main control loop. This approach can be 
viewed as a special case of so-called integral sliding mode. A more math-
ematical background of integral sliding mode is described in Chapter 7. 
The main idea of disturbance rejection via sliding mode is to compose the 
overall controller of a continuous part and a discontinuous part, i.e.,
 
u(t) = uc(t) + ud(t). 
(8.5.1)
The idea of combining a continuous and a discontinuous part for the con-
trol input has been used by many authors [for a survey see, DeCarlo, Zak, 
and Matthews 1988]. The continuous component uc(t) is used to control the 
overall behavior of the system, whereas the discontinuous component ud(t) 
is used to reject disturbances and to suppress parametric uncertainties. A 
block diagram is shown in Figure 8.16.
Assume that, for the example system in Equation 8.1.1, the desired tra-
jectory xd(t) is known but the disturbance d(x, t) is unknown. Also assume 
the parameter b to be known and parameter a to be entirely unknown. 
FIGURE 8.16

To reduce the infl uence of disturbance f(x, t) on the tracking performance, 
the second term in controller Equation 8.5.1 is designed as a disturbance esti-
mator using sliding mode control. Defi ne a sliding manifold as

and s(t) = 0 after fi nite time. Choosing the initial conditions of the auxiliary 
sliding variable z(t) in Equation 8.5.5 as z(0) = −xe(0) eliminates the reaching 
phase by setting s(0) = 0 in Equation 8.5.4. While the system is in sliding 
mode, the motion trajectories can be examined using the equivalent control 
method. Solving s t( ) = 0 in Equation 8.5.6 under the assumption w(t) = u(t) for

where p denotes the Laplace variable and ε > 0 is a small time constant. 
Disturbance rejection controller ud(t) in Equation 8.5.14 is continuous. It was 
shown by Utkin [1992] that the low-pass average of the discontinuity term 
in Equation 8.5.14 equals the equivalent control (Equation 8.5.11). In systems 
with the ability to use discontinuous control inputs directly, the low-pass 
fi lter may be omitted completely. 
The simulation in Figure 8.18 shows the improvement of the controller per-
formance achieved by the disturbance estimator ud(t) compared with Figure 
8.17. The bottom graph depicts the performance of the disturbance estimator 
and shows that s(t) = 0 at all times attributable to setting z(0) = −xe(0) and thus 
s(0) = 0. Estimation u

small lag introduced by the averaging low pass in Equation 8.5.14.

The Chattering Problem 
187
The closed-loop system is free of chattering despite the discontinuity in 
Equation 8.5.5 because the disturbance rejection term ud(t) is continuous. 
However, x(t) tracks desired xd(t) exactly because of the rejection of distur-
bance f(x, t), which also contains uncertainty in parameter a of the system 
in Equation 8.1.1. Note that the rejection of the parametric uncertainty does 
not assume constant system parameters but rather is able to also account for 
parameter variations.
8.6. State-Dependent Gain Method
This section provides an alternative way to suppress chattering without 
designing an additional system, e.g., an asymptotic observer that needs pre-
liminary information of the system or plant. In Section 8.1.4, it was shown 
FIGURE 8.18
Performance of linear feedback controller with feedforward of desired trajectory, uc(t), is 
signifi cantly improved by disturbance rejection controller ud(t) based on auxiliary variable z(t) 
for estimating unknown plant dynamics ax(t) and external disturbance d(x, t) summarized as 
f(x, t) = −ax(t) − d(x,t).

that the magnitude of chattering is proportional to the gain M. Thus, the idea 
is to reduce the value of M without losing guarantee of existence of sliding 
mode. To support this idea, a state-dependent gain method is proposed [Lee 
and Utkin 2006]. The design idea will be illustrated for the second-order sys-
tem with a state-dependent gain M(x) in the sliding mode controller

It can be seen that the amplitude of the system input is signifi cantly reduced 
by using the proposed controller compared with the result using conven-
tional sliding mode control with a fi xed gain M. In addition to the effect 
of chattering reducing, the state-dependent gain in control is expected to 
decrease the control effort. As the simulation shows, the both control algo-
rithms result in the same trajectory for x1(t).

are introduced into the system. At the presence of unmodeled dynamics, 
chattering arises but the magnitude of chattering is reduced by using state-
dependent gain M as expected (Figure 8.20).
8.7. Equivalent Control-Dependent Gain Method
Any method would be helpful to suppress chattering if it can decrease the 
gain M while maintaining sliding mode. In the previous section, reducing M 
along with the system state was suggested. This methodology will hardly be 
applicable for nonlinear systems at the presence of unknown disturbances. 
As shown in Section 2.3, the motion in sliding mode is determined by the 
equivalent control ueq, a solution to equation s = 0 with respect to control. 
The function ueq is an average value of the real discontinuous control, and, of 
course, the real control amplitude should be greater than |ueq|. Conversely, ueq 
can be easily obtained using a low-pass fi lter. Hence, the smallest  allowable 
amplitude of the discontinuous control can be based on the equivalent  control

Suppose that, at initial time x(0) ≠ 0, then sign(x) = ± 1, |σ| = 1 and  functions 
x(t) and x t( ) have opposite signs; therefore, sliding mode will appear at point 
x = 0 after fi nite time interval. After sliding mode occurs, it will not disap-
pear, as follows.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Because |σ| < 1, x and x have different signs, sliding mode cannot disappear.
If f(x, t) is reduced to zero during sliding mode, then control u tends to 
−Mδ sign(x), which leads to a decreased control amplitude. As a result, the 
chattering will be attenuated.
Simulation results for the system (Equation 8.6.1) with control u1 = −M(|σ| 
+ δ)sign(s), σ = [sign(s)]eq, and u2 = −Msign(s), (M = const) are shown in Figure

8.8. Multiphase Chattering Suppression
8.8.1. Problem Statement
Although the introduction of state observers leads to a signifi cant reduc-
tion of chattering, their application needs information about the process 
equations. The common way to implement sliding mode control is based 
on electronic power converters with “on/off” as the only admissible switch-
ing operation mode. An output of converters can take only two (or fi nite 
number of) values; therefore, the methodologies of Sections 8.5 and 8.6 are 
not applicable for chattering suppression. A natural way to reduce chatter-
ing is increasing switching frequency. However, it is not always possible as 
a result of limitation of switching frequency or losses in power converters. 
In addition, implementation of sliding modes in power converters results in 
frequency variations, which is unacceptable in many applications. 
The challenge is to design a multiphase converter system based on a given, 
fi xed switching frequency, reducing chattering to a desired level. This may 
be possible by providing a desired phase shift between phases for any loads 
and frequencies to implement the “harmonic cancellation” method. Attempts 
to apply this idea to PWM have been made such that phase shifts are inter-
connected and can be controlled, using a transformer with primary and sec-
ondary coils in different phases. Alternatively, the phase shift was obtained 
using delays, fi lters, or set of triangular inputs with selected delays [Miwa, 
Wen, and Schecht 1992; Xu, Wei, and Lee 2003; Woo, Lee, and Schuellein 2006]. 
Frequency control can be performed changing the width of a hysteresis loop 
in switching devices [Ngyuen and Lee 1995; Cortes and Alvarez 2002]. 
The approach in this section stems from the nature of the sliding mode 
control and provides a desired phase shift between phases for any frequency 
without any additional dynamic elements.
To formulate the problem statement, consider the system with scalar 
control,

(8.8.1)
For system Equation 8.8.1, it is assumed that control should be designed as 
a continuous function of state variables u0(x). This situation is common for 
so-called “cascade control” used for electric motors with current as a control 
input. To implement the desired control, power converters often use PWM 
as a principle operation mode. Sliding mode is one of the tools to implement 
this mode based on the feedback approach as shown in Figure 8.22, which 
illustrates that the output u tracks the reference input u0(x) in sliding mode:

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
It is evident that sliding mode in the surface s = 0 with u ≡ u0(x) exists if 
M >|g(x)|. If the control is implemented with a hysteresis loop, chattering 
with oscillation amplitude A = Δ
2
 in s is illustrated in Figure 8.23. 
Under the assumption that the switching frequency is high enough, the 
state x can be considered as constant within the time interval [t0, t2], and the 
switching frequency is found as f

The amplitude of chattering in u0 depends on the oscillation in each con-
verter phase, and, in the worst case, it can be m times higher than that of each 
converter. For the system in Figure 8.22, phases depend on initial conditions 
and cannot be controlled. However, as was demonstrated for the system in 
Equation 2.1.1 (see also Figure 2.1), switching instants or phase shift between 
oscillations in different control channels are not independent if the chan-
nels are interconnected. Hence, if discontinuous inputs of the integrators are 
interconnected, then the phases of oscillations will be interdependent, which 
gives hope to reduce the chattering amplitude in the output signal. First, it 
should be demonstrated that, by controlling phases, the output oscillation 
amplitude can be reduced.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Suppose that a multiphase converter with m phases is to be designed such 
that the period of chattering T is the same in each phase, and two subsequent 
phases have phase shift T m. Because chattering is a periodic time function, 
it can be represented as Fourier series with frequencies

amplitude of chattering can be reduced to the desired level by increasing the 
number of phases, providing a desired phase shift between two subsequent 
phases from the methodology proposed in the previous section. 
The above analysis lets us outline the design method for suppressing chat-
tering: fi rst select the width of the hysteresis loop in each phase in compliance 
with Equation 8.8.3 (or K

h = Δ
) to have the desired switching frequency. 
Then select the number of phases m and switching functions to provide the 
desired phase shifts T m. The last problem will be addressed in the next 
section.

(8.8.8)
The system behavior in the plane s1 and s2
∗ is analyzed with the widths of 
hysteresis loops for the two sliding surfaces being Δ and αΔ, respectively. 
First, the case a = 0 and α = 1 is considered. As can be seen from Figure 8.27, 
phase shift between ν1 and ν2 is equal to T

 for any value of Δ, where T is the 
period of oscillations T
M

Δ
2 . 
It is evident that, for any initial conditions different from point 0 (for 
instance, 0′), the motion represented in Figure 8.27 will appear in time less 
than T
2 . A similar analysis may be performed for the case a ≠ 0 (of course 
M >|a|) and α ≠ 1. In Figure 8.28, s plane is demonstrated for a > 0 and α > 1. 
Also, the period of oscillations T can be easily found from the equation with 
respect to s1 as follows:

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Otherwise, for the trajectory starting from point 2 in Figure 8.28, ν1 will 
switch from M to −M before ν2 switches from −M to M at point 3. 
As follows from this example, the phase shift between oscillations can be 
selected by proper choice of α for any switching frequency without using 
dynamic elements, e.g., transformers and fi lters. 
Next, we show that the selection of the phase number depends on the 
range of the function a. First, the value α is calculated to provide the desired 
phase shift. Because ϕ must be equal to T m, α can be found from Equations 
8.8.9 through 8.8.11 as

Similarly, it also can be shown that the same condition should hold for a

The above results may be summarized as the design procedure for the 
multiphase converter: 
Select the width of hysteresis loop as a state function such that the 
switching frequency in the fi rst phase is maintained at the desired 
level. 
Determine the number of phases for a given range of function a

Find the parameter α as a function of a such that the phase shift 
between two subsequent phases is equal to 1

Another version, called “master-slave mode,” of multiphase converters is 
proposed here based on phase shift control with sliding mode. The approach 
implies frequency control in the fi rst phase and open-loop control for the 
others as illustrated in Figure 8.29.
The fi rst phase (master) is connected to the next phase (slave) through an 
additional fi rst-order system as a shifter such that the discontinuous input 
ν2 for the slave has a desired phase shift from ν1 without changing switching 
frequency. 
To demonstrate the design idea, a two-phase converter system similar to 
the one in Section 8.8.2 is considered. The equation of the fi rst phase,

analysis of the system behavior can be performed in the same manner as in 
the previous sections. With the width of hysteresis loop Δ, the phase shift 
between ν1 and ν2 becomes 
 
φ =

2KM , 
 (8.8.18)
whereas the phase shift from the earlier design principle can be found in 
Equation 8.8.10. Comparing Equation 8.8.10 with Equation 8.8.18, the value of

For multiphase converters, the desired control of each phase can be obtained

a phase-shifted signal from the input to the previous phase νk−1.

Remark 8.3
Similar to the fi rst version varying the width of a hysteresis loop, the desired 
phase shift cannot be provided by master-slave modifi cation in Figure 8.29 if 
the condition in Equation 8.8.13 does not hold. However, for the master-slave 
version, the necessary phase shift can be gained by sequential connection of 
several “slaves” such that each of them has an admissible phase shift.
8.9. Comparing the Different Solutions 
In applications of sliding mode control, unmodeled dynamics in the control 
loop are often excited by the discontinuous switching action of a sliding 
mode controller, leading to oscillations in the motion trajectory. Because of

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
the acoustic noise that such oscillations may cause in mechanical systems, 
this phenomenon is also referred to as chattering. This chapter studied the 
chattering problem and presented several solutions to reliably eliminate 
or signifi cantly reduce chattering in the control loop. To successfully pre-
vent chattering, these methods require some estimate of the time constant 
or the bandwidth of the unmodeled dynamics. Instead of achieving exact 
tracking performance as in ideal sliding mode, small tracking errors are 
tolerated. 
In general, the achievable performance of a control system depends on the 
performance of sensors and actuators, availability of knowledge about the 
system, i.e., the quality of the system model, and the availability of measure-
ments of system variables. For example, a system with a slow actuator cannot 
fully reject fast disturbances, regardless of the control design methodology 
used. A sliding mode controller under ideal conditions is able to fully exploit 
the system capabilities. Under realistic conditions, a chattering prevention 
scheme should be selected to meet the system specifi cations and to ensure 
good control performance. 
The fi rst method substitutes the discontinuity of a sliding mode controller 
by a saturation function and yields motion in a boundary layer of the slid-
ing manifold instead of true sliding along the manifold. Effectively, sliding 
mode methodology is used to design a continuous high-gain controller that 
respects bounds on the control resources. 
The second method shifts the switching action of the sliding mode control-
ler into an auxiliary observer loop, thus circumventing unmodeled dynamics 
in the main loop and achieving ideal sliding mode in the observer loop. The 
plant follows the ideal trajectory of the observer according to the observer 
performance. Because the control input to the plant is still discontinuous, 
this method is ideal for systems that already have an observer in the control 
structure or for systems with inherently discontinuous control inputs such as 
voltage inputs of electric drives. Implementation of a continuous controller in 
a system with discontinuous inputs generally requires PWM, whereas direct 
implementation of sliding mode control with an observer avoids PWM.
The third method is mainly designed for systems in which some knowl-
edge of the unmodeled dynamics and intermediate measurements are avail-
able, e.g., known actuator dynamics. Such systems consisting of separated 
blocks may be controlled with a cascaded control structure that avoids chat-
tering by explicitly taking the unmodeled dynamics into account for the con-
trol design. In this sense, they are no longer unmodeled but rather part of the 
overall system model.
The fourth method combines a continuous and a discontinuous control-
ler to achieved good performance without chattering. The continuous part 
controls the overall motion, whereas the task of the discontinuous part is to 
reject the infl uence of parametric uncertainty and disturbances. This method 
is a special case of integral sliding mode and is especially useful for systems 
with large uncertainties and/or disturbances.

The Chattering Problem 
203
The state- or equivalent-control-dependent gain methods are effi cient 
tools to signifi cantly reduce chattering. However, in many cases, they are not 
applicable because the actuators in the control systems are power converters 
with a fi nite number of output voltage values.
In addition, even without unmodeled dynamics, the switching frequency 
of power converters should be bounded as a result of heat losses during each 
switching, which is proportional to the square of the switched current. A 
multiphase sliding mode power converter is a feasible method for reducing 
both chattering and heat losses. 
All methods possess their advantages and disadvantages, both of which 
depend on the system specifi cations. When designing a sliding mode con-
troller for a given system, the chattering prevention method usually requires 
careful consideration of all details; unfortunately, no textbook solution exists 
to cope with all systems in a general manner.

Discrete-Time and Delay Systems
Sliding mode is a very powerful tool for control design. So far, this text 
has concentrated on sliding mode control design for continuous-time 
systems. However, in many practical problems, controllers are imple-
mented in discrete time, e.g., using microprocessors. Similar to the 
development of linear systems theory in the 1960s and 1970s, the dis-
cretization process requires the approach to be rethought. This chapter 
seeks to develop a general concept for discrete-time sliding mode and 
presents linear systems as design examples. This new concept is further 
extended to systems with delays and distributed systems.
9.1. Introduction to Discrete-Time Systems
Most sliding mode approaches are based on fi nite-dimensional continuous-
time models and lead to discontinuous control action. Once such a 
dynamic system is “in sliding mode,” its motion trajectory is confi ned 
to a manifold in the state space, i.e., to the sliding manifold. Generally 
speaking, for continuous-time systems, this reduction of the system order 
may only be achieved by discontinuous control, switching at theoretically 
infi nite frequency. 
When challenged with the task of implementing sliding mode control in a 
practical system, the control engineer has two options:
Direct, analog implementation of a discontinuous control law with a 
very fast switching device, e.g., with power transistors.
Discrete implementation of sliding mode control, e.g., with a digital 
microcontroller.
The fi rst method is only suitable for systems with a voltage input, allowing 
the use of analog switching devices. Most other systems are usually based 
on a discrete microcontroller-based implementation. However, a discon-
tinuous control designed for a continuous-time system model would lead 
to chatter when implemented without modifi cations in discrete time with 
a fi nite sampling rate. This discretization chatter is different from the chat-
tering problem caused by unmodeled dynamics as discussed in Chapter 8. 
Discretization chatter is attributable to the fact that the switching frequency 
•

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
is limited to the sampling rate, but correct implementation of sliding mode 
control requires infi nite switching frequency. The following example will 
illustrate the difference between ideal continuous-time sliding mode and 
direct discrete implementation with discretization chatter. The subsequent 
sections of this chapter are dedicated to the development of a discrete-time 
sliding mode concept to eliminate the chatter. This concept then is extended 
to systems with delays and distributed systems governed by differential-
 difference equations.

u0 = 2, starting from initial conditions x(t = 0) = 3. At tsm the system reaches the 
sliding manifold x = 0. Thereafter, the motion trajectory is invariantly conﬁ ned to 
the manifold (Equation 9.1.2) via discontinuously switching control, illustrated in 
the bottom diagram of Figure 9.1 by a black rectangle.

where subscript k denotes the sampling points, e.g., the system state xk at time 
instance tk = kΔt. The motion trajectory may not reach the manifold x = 0 because 
control uk is only calculated at the sampling points k, i.e., the switching frequency 
is limited by the sampling rate 1/Δt. During the sampling interval Δt, the control is 
constant and the system behaves like an open-loop system [Kotta 1989]. 
The example with exaggerated large sampling time Δt = 0.1sec as depicted in 
Figure 9.2 illustrates the need to develop a discrete-time sliding mode algorithm 
rather than implementing Equation 9.1.6.
It should be noted that increasing the sampling rate decreases the ampli-
tude of the discretization chatter and increases its frequency but may not 
eliminate this discrete-time phenomenon unless Δt → 0. Moreover, the sam-
pling rate of a control system should correspond to the fastest dynamics of 
the system instead of “wasting” computational power for the control algo-
rithm’s sake.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
9.2. Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Concept
Before developing the concept of discrete-time sliding mode, let us revisit 
the principle of sliding mode in continuous-time systems with ideal discon-
tinuous control from an engineering point of view. A more mathematical 
treatment may be found in the work of Utkin [1993] or Drakunov and Utkin 
1990]. Rewrite Equation 9.1.1 as a general continuous-time system

Note the following observations characterizing the nature of sliding mode 
systems:
The time interval between the initial point t = 0 and the reaching 
of the sliding manifold σ = {x: s(x) = 0} at tsm is fi nite, in contrast to 
systems with a continuous control law that exhibit asymptotic con-
vergence to any manifold consisting of state trajectories.
Once the system is “in sliding mode” for all t ≥ tsm, its trajectory 
motion is confi ned to the manifold σ = {x: s(x) = 0}, and the order of 
the closed-loop system dynamics is less than the order of the origi-
nal uncontrolled system.
After sliding mode has started at tsm, the system trajectory cannot 
be backtracked beyond the manifold σ = {x: s(x) = 0} like in systems 
without discontinuities. In other words, at any point t0 ≥ tsm, it is not 
possible to determine the time instance tsm or to reverse calculate the 
trajectory for t < tsm  based on information of the system state at t0.
However, during both time intervals before and after reaching the sliding 
manifold, the state trajectories are continuous time functions and the rela-
tion between two values of the state at the ends of a fi nite time interval t = [t0, 
t0 + Δt] may be found by solving Equation 9.2.1 as
 
x(t0 + Δt) = F(x(t0)), 
(9.2.3)
where F(x(t)) is a continuous function as well. When derived for each sam-
pling point tj = kΔt, k = 1, 2, …, Equation 9.2.3 is nothing but the discrete-time 
representation of the continuous time prototype (Equation 9.2.1), i.e.,
 
xk+1 = F(xk), xk = x(kΔt).

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
It seems reasonable to call this motion “sliding mode in discrete time,” or 
“discrete-time sliding mode.” Note that the right-hand side of the motion 
equation of the system with discrete-time sliding mode is a continuous state 
function.
So far, we have generated a discrete-time description of a continuous-time 
sliding mode system. Next, we need to derive a discrete-time control law that 
may generate sliding mode in a discrete-time system. Let us return to the 
example in Equation 9.2.1 and suppose that, for any constant control input u 
and any initial condition x(0), the solution to Equation 9.2.1 may be found in 
closed form, i.e., 
 
x(t) = F(x(0), u). 
(9.2.6)
Now also assume that control u may be chosen arbitrarily. With the help of 
Equation 9.2.6, follow the procedure below:
 
1. At t = 0, select constant u(x(t = 0), Δt) for a given time interval Δt such 
that s(x(t = Δt)) = 0. 
 
2. Next, at t = Δt, fi nd constant u(x(t = Δt), Δt) such that s(x(t = 2Δt)) = 0.
 
3. In general, for each k = 0, 1, 2,…, at t = kΔt choose constant u(xk, Δt) 
such that s(xk+1) = 0.
In other words, at each sampling point k, select uk such that this control input, 
to be constant during the next sampling interval Δt, will achieve s(xk+1) = 0 at 
the next sampling point (k + 1). During the sampling interval, state x(kΔt < t 
< (k + 1) Δt) may not belong to the manifold, i.e., s(x(t)) ≠ 0 is possible for kΔt < 
t < (k + 1) Δt. However, the discrete-time system

hits the sliding manifold at each sampling point, i.e., s(xk+1) = 0 ∀ k = 0, 1, 
2, … is fulfi lled.
Because F(x(0), u) tends to x(0) as Δt → 0, the function u(x(0), Δt) may 
exceed the available control resources u0. As a result, the bounded con-
trol shown in the bottom diagram of Figure 9.4 steers state xk to zero only 
after a finite number of steps ksm. Thus, the manifold is reached after a 
finite time interval tsm = ksmΔt, and, thereafter, the state xk remains on the 
manifold. In analogy to continuous-time systems, this motion may be 
referred to as discrete-time sliding mode. Note that sliding mode is gen-
erated in the discrete-time system with control −u0 ≤ u ≤ u0 as a continu-
ous function of the state xk and is piecewise constant during the sampling 
interval.

The above fi rst-order example clarifi es the defi nition of the term discrete-
time sliding mode introduced by Drakunov and Utkin [1990] for an arbitrary 
fi nite-dimensional discrete-time system.
Definition 9.1: Discrete-Time Sliding Mode
In the discrete-time dynamic system
 
xk+1 = F(xk, uk), x ∈ ℜn, u ∈ ℜm, m ≤ n, 
(9.2.8)
discrete-time sliding mode takes place on a subset Σ of the manifold σ = 
{x: s(x) = 0}, s ∈ ℜm, if there exists an open neighborhood ℵ of this subset such 
that, for each x ∈ ℵ, it follows that s(F(xk+1)) ∈ Σ.
In contrast to continuous-time systems, sliding mode may arise in discrete -
time systems with a continuous function in the right-hand side of the 
FIGURE 9.4
Proper implementation of sliding mode control in discrete time. Sampling instances are 
marked with small circles. Control uk is selected as −u0 ≤ uk ≤ u0 at each sampling instance to 
achieve s(xk+1) = 0 as quickly as possible in accordance with the available control resources, 
resulting in chatter-free motion after reaching the sliding manifold at tsm = ksmΔt.

closed-loop system equation. Nevertheless, the aforementioned characteris-
tics of continuous-time sliding mode have been transferred to discrete-time 
sliding mode. The mathematical implications in terms of group theory may 
be found in the work by Drakunov and Utkin [Drakunov and Utkin 1990; 
Utkin 1993]. Practical issues will be discussed in the subsequent section 
using linear systems as an example.
9.3. Linear Discrete-Time Systems with Known Parameters
This section deals with discrete-time sliding mode control for linear time-
invariant continuous-time plants. Let us assume that a sliding mode mani-
fold is linear for an nth-order discrete-time system xk+1 = F(xk), i.e., sk = Cxk, 
C ∈ ℜm×n with m control inputs. According to Defi nition 9.1, the sliding mode 
existence condition is of the form
 
sk+1 = C(F(xk)) 
(9.3.1)
for any xk ∈ ℵ. To design a discrete-time sliding mode control law based on 
the condition in Equation 9.3.1, consider the discrete-time representation of 
the linear time-invariant system

with state vector x(t) ∈ ℜn, control u(t) ∈ ℜm, reference input r(t), and constant 
system matrices A, B, and D. Transformation to discrete time with sampling 
interval Δt yields 
 
xk+1 = A*xk + B*uk + D*rk,

and the reference input r(t) is assumed to be constant during the sampling 
interval Δt. In accordance with Equation 9.3.1, discrete-time sliding mode 
exists if the matrix CB* has an inverse and the control uk is designed as the 
solution of 
 
sk+1 = CA*xk + CD*rk + CB*uk = 0. 
(9.3.5)
In other words, control uk should be chosen as
 
uk = −(CB*)−1(CA*xk + CD*rk).

By analogy with continuous-time systems, the control law in Equation 9.3.6 
yielding motion in the manifold s = 0 will be referred to as equivalent con-
trol. To reveal the structure of ukeq, let us represent it as the sum of two linear 
functions:

and 
 
sk+1 = sk + (CA* − C)xk + CD*rk + CB*uk. 
(9.3.8)
As in the fi rst-order example considered in the previous section, ukeq may 
exceed the available control resources with Δt → 0 for initial sk ≠ 0 because, 
attributable to (CB*)−1→ ∞, (CB*)−1(CA* − C) and (CB*)−1CD* take fi nite values. 
Hence, the real-life bounds for control uk should be taken into account.

Hence, sk  decreases monotonously and, after a fi nite number of steps,

Control (Equation 9.3.10) provides chatter-free motion in the manifold 
s = 0 as shown in Figure 9.4, in contrast to the direct implementation of 
discontinuous control in Figure 9.2, resulting in discretization chatter in the 
vicinity of the sliding manifold. Similar to the case of continuous-time sys-
tems, the equation s = Cx = 0 enables the reduction of system order, and the 
desired system dynamics in sliding mode can be designed by appropriate 
choice of matrix C. 
9.4. Linear Discrete-Time Systems with Unknown Parameters
Complete information of the plant parameters is required for implementation 
of control in Equation 9.3.10, which may not be available in practice. To extend 
the discrete-time sliding mode concept to systems with unknown param-
eters, suppose that the system in Equation 9.3.5 operates under uncertainty 
conditions: the matrices A and D and the reference input rk are assumed to be 
unknown and may vary in some ranges such that the condition in Equation 
9.3.9 holds. Similar to Equation 9.3.10, the control law

Hence, as for the case with complete knowledge of system parameters dis-
cussed in Section 9.3, the value of sk  decreases monotonously, and, after a 
fi nite number of steps, control u
u
k <
0 will be within the available resources. 
Substituting Equation 9.4.1 into Equation 9.3.8 results in
 
sk+1 = (CA* − C)xk + CD*rk. 
(9.4.4)
Because the matrices (CA* − C) and CD* are of Δt order, the system motion 
will be in a Δt-order vicinity of the sliding manifold s = 0. Figure 9.5 shows 
a simulation of the fi rst-order Example 9.1 for unknown matrices A and D. 
Convergence to the vicinity of the sliding manifold is achieved in fi nite 
time; thereafter, the motion trajectory does not follow the sliding manifold 
exactly but rather remains within a Δt-order vicinity. This result is expected 
from systems operating under uncertainty conditions, because we are deal-
ing with an open-loop system during each sampling interval. In contrast to 
discrete-time systems with direct implementation of discontinuous control 
as shown in Figure 9.2, this motion is free of discretization chatter.

9.5. Introduction to Systems with Delays 
and Distributed Systems
This section discusses design methods for systems described by difference 
and differential-difference equations. These types of equations may serve 
as mathematical models for dynamic systems with delays or for distributed 
systems with fi nite dimensional inputs and outputs. The following section 
presents the basic sliding mode control design methodology. A fl exible shaft 
as an example for a distributed system is discussed in Section 9.7.

where x ∈ ℜn, z ∈ ℜk, and u ∈ ℜm. The pair (A11, A12) is assumed to be con-
trollable, and the difference system Equation 9.5.2 is assumed invertible 
with output Ã12z(t), where Ã12 consists of the basic rows of A12 in Equation 
9.5.1.
Recall the sliding mode concept for discrete-time systems presented in 
Section 9.2 and in Defi nition 9.1. For differential-difference system as in 
Equations 9.5.1 and 9.5.2, sliding mode can be defi ned in a similar manner: 
sliding mode exists in some manifold σ if the state trajectories starting 
outside this manifold reach σ within fi nite time and all state trajectories 
that belong to the manifold σ at some time instance tsm remain in σ for all 
t ≥ tsm.
System (Equations 9.5.1 and 9.5.2) is written in block-control form as 
described by Drakunov et al. [1990a,b] for ordinary differential equa-
tions (see also Section 3.2). The two-step design procedure fi rst derives a 
desired control zd(x(t)) for Equation 9.5.1 to yield the desired motion along 
a manifold σ = {x: S(x) = 0} in this fi rst block, assuming z = zd. The second 
design step uses real control input u(x, t) in Equation 9.5.2 to ensure that 
this assumption holds by enforcing sliding mode in the second block along 
manifold σ0 = {x: z − zd = 0}. In the overall system (Equations 9.5.1 and 9.5.2), 
sliding mode exists in the intersection of both manifolds as described by 
σ ∩ σ0.
9.6. Linear Systems with Delays
This section deals with linear systems with known parameters in anal-
ogy to Section 9.3. The extension to systems with unknown parameters 
follows similar procedures as for discrete-time systems in Section 9.4 and 
is omitted here.

in differential-difference block-form (Equation 9.5.1 and 9.5.2) by setting

Similar to discrete-time systems as discussed in Sections 9.2 through 9.4, 
control u(t) is designed with preview such that z(t + τ) = zd(t + τ) at some future 
point, τ ahead of the current time instance t. In contrast to discrete-time sys-
tems, time t is continuous rather than sampled at discrete-time instances kΔt.

9.7. Distributed Systems
This section discusses a fl exible shaft as an example for a distributed sys-
tem. Because distributed systems can be described by similar differential-
difference equations as systems with delays, the design methodology of 
Section 9.6 will be used.

Consider a fl exible shaft with lengths l and inertial load J acting as a tor-
sion bar as depicted in Figure 9.6. Let e(t) be the absolute coordinate of the left 
end of the bar with input torque M and let d(x, t) be the relative deviation at 
location 0 ≤ x ≤ l at time t. Hence, the absolute deviation of a point 0 < x < l at 
time t is described by q(x, t) = e(t) + d(x, t) and governed by

9.8. Summary 
Wide use of digital controllers has created a need to generalize the sliding 
mode concept to discrete-time control systems, which raises the fundamen-
tal question: What is sliding mode in a discrete-time system? Discontinuous 
control in a continuous-time system may result in sliding mode in some 
manifold of the state space, whereas it results in chatter in a discrete-time 
implementation. Hence, we fi rst defi ned the essence of sliding mode, con-
stituting a general concept. In short, sliding mode exists in a manifold if 
the system trajectories reach this manifold in fi nite time and remain in the 
manifold thereafter. Mathematically speaking, the trajectory of a system 
in sliding mode is not invertible, i.e., after sliding mode has occurred, it 
is impossible to fi nd the point in time and the state space location sliding 
mode started, nor is it possible to backtrack the system trajectory beyond 
this point.
Following this defi nition, sliding mode may be generated in discrete-
time systems using a continuous control input. Design methods have been 
developed in this chapter and were extended to systems with delays and 
distributed systems. They enable decoupling of the overall dynamics into 
independent partial motion of lower dimension and low sensitivity to 
system uncertainties. For all systems, the motion trajectories are free of 
chatter, which has been the main obstacle for certain applications of dis-
continuous control action in systems governed by discrete and difference 
equations.

Electric Drives
In recent years, much research effort has been devoted to the application of 
sliding mode control techniques to power electronic equipments and electri-
cal drives. Interest in this control approach has emerged because of its poten-
tial for circumventing parameter variation effects under dynamic conditions 
with a minimum of implementation complexity. In electric drive systems, the 
existence of parameter changes caused by, for instance, winding tempera-
ture variation, converter switching effect, and saturation, is well recognized 
although infrequently accounted for. In servo applications, signifi cant param-
eter variations arise from often unknown loads; for example, in machine tool 
drives and robotics, the moment of inertia represents a variable parameter 
depending on the load of the tool or the payload. Among the distinctive 
features claimed for sliding mode control are order reduction, disturbance 
rejection, strong robustness, and simple implementation by means of power 
converters. Hence, sliding mode is attributed to high potentials as a prospec-
tive control methodology for electric drive systems. The experience gained 
so far testifi es to its effi ciency and versatility. In fact, control of electric drives 
is one of the most challenging applications because of increasing interest in 
using electric servo-mechanisms in control systems, the advances of high-
speed switching circuitry, as well as insuffi cient linear control methodology 
for inherent nonlinear high-order multivariable plants such as AC motors.
Implementation of sliding mode control by means of the most com-
mon electric components has turned out to be simple enough. The com-
mercially available power converters enable handling powers of several 
dozen kilowatts at frequencies of several hundred kilohertz. When using 
converters of this type, confi ning their function to pulse-width modula-
tions seems unjustifi ed, and it is reasonable to turn to algorithms with 
direct discontinuous control actions. Introduction of discontinuities is 
dictated by the very nature of power converters.
This chapter consists of three main parts: sliding mode control of DC 
motors, permanent-magnet synchronous motors, and induction motors. 
These three types of electric motors are the most commonly used drive 
systems in industrial applications. All these drive systems have much in 
common: current control, speed control, observer design, and issues of 
sensorless control. As will be shown in each particular section, sliding 
mode control techniques are used fl exibly to achieve the desired control 
performance, not only in controller design but also in observer design 
and estimation processes.
The basic framework of this chapter has been given previously [Utkin 
1993; Sabanovic, Sabanovic, and Ohnishi 1993]. However, both the con-
tent and theoretical aspect have been extended considerably with respect 
to the above framework.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
10.1. DC Motors
10.1.1. Introduction
To show the effectiveness of sliding mode techniques in the control of elec-
tric drives, we start with the most simple drive systems, i.e. DC-motor-based 
drive systems. This section is an extension of the sliding mode approaches 
applied to DC motors given by Utkin [1993]. Moreover, some implementation 
aspects will be enhanced, aiming at applications of theoretical derivations 
given in the proceeding chapters to real-life systems.
10.1.2. Model of the DC Motor 
From the point of controllability, a DC motor with a constant excitation is the 
simplest electric drive. Figure 10.1 shows the structure of the electric circuit 
of a permanently excited DC motor. 
The motor dynamics are governed by two coupled fi rst-order equations 
with respect to armature current and shaft speed

where i is armature current, u is terminal voltage, ω is shaft speed, J is inertia 
of the motor rotor and load, R is armature resistance, L is armature induc-
tance, λ0 is back electromotive force (EMF) constant, kt is torque constant, and 
τl is load torque.
Throughout this section, the motor parameters used to verify the design 
principles are as follows: L = 1.0 mH, R = 0.5 Ω, J = 0.001 kg⋅m2, kt = 0.008

Nm/A, λ0 = 0.001 V⋅s/rad, and τl = Bω, with B being the coeffi cient of viscous 
friction equal to 0.01 Nm⋅s/rad. The supplied link voltage is u0 = 20 V.
For speed control of a DC motor, a cascaded control structure usually is 
preferred, with an inner current control loop and an outer speed control 
loop. Control input u may be continuous or discontinuous, depending on the 
output power of the DC motor. For a low-power system, a continuous control 
may be selected. For a high-power system, a discontinuous control (e.g., in 
the form of PWM) has to be used because a continuous controlled voltage, 
whilst providing large current, is diffi cult to generate. 
We concentrate on discontinuous control in the sequel of this chapter, 
because control discontinuities are the very nature of sliding mode control. 
Furthermore, discontinuous control of DC motors is universal in the sense 
that it can be used both for low-power systems and high-power systems. 
Figure 10.2 shows the typical control structure of a DC-motor-based drive 
system.
10.1.3. Current Control
At fi rst, assume there exists an outer control loop providing a desired cur-
rent i*. Let us consider the current control problem by a defi ning switching 
function
 
s = i * − i 
(10.1.2)
as the error between the real, measured current i and the reference current i* 
determined by the outer-loop controller. Design the discontinuous control as
 
u = u0 sign(s), 
(10.1.3)
where u0 denotes the supplied link voltage. As discussed in the previous 
chapters, to enforce the sliding mode, control gain u0 should be selected such 
that ss < 0. Now check this condition by evaluating ss and select u0 as

then sliding mode can be enforced.
Examine inequality Equation 10.1.4. If the reference current is constant, 
the link voltage u0 needed to enforce sliding mode should be higher than the 
voltage drop at the armature resistance plus the induced back EMF; other-
wise the reference current i* cannot be followed. Furthermore, reference cur-
rent i* may not vary arbitrarily; its time derivative di*/dt should be bounded 
to ensure existence of sliding mode for a given link voltage u0.
Figure 10.3 depicts a simulation result of the proposed current controller.
10.1.4. Speed Control
For the speed controller in an outer loop, the current control loop may be 
treated as an ideal current source, i.e., given a reference current i*, it will be 
tracked immediately. This assumption may become true only for systems in 
FIGURE 10.3

which the electrical time constant is much smaller than the mechanical time 
constant or for systems in which the dynamic response of the speed control 
is not a critical problem. Any control design technique, linear or nonlinear, 
may be used for speed control: proportional-integral-derivative control or a 
more sophisticated methodology but without discontinuities such as a slid-
ing mode controller. The reason is as follows: a sliding mode controller has 
already been used in the inner current control loop; thus, if we would use 
another sliding mode controller for speed control, the output of the speed 
controller i* would be discontinuous, implying an infi nite di*/dt that destroys 
the inequality Equation 10.1.4 for any implementable u0.
In many industrial systems, proportional-integral controllers are used 
with or without a feedforward compensation depending on the nature of the 
controlled system and the performance requirements. This type of controller 
is simple but may be sensitive to disturbances in the mechanical subsystem.

However, implementation of speed controller Equation 10.1.6 requires knowl-
edge of the motor parameters J, kt and the load torque τl, which are normally 
unknown.
10.1.5. Integrated Structure for Speed Control
To overcome the problems of the cascade control structure, we propose 
another control approach based on the sliding mode control principle to 
track a given speed trajectory. In this new control structure, the inner cur-
rent controller is removed. Current control is achieved in an implicit manner. 
The advantages of this control structure lie in the fast dynamic response 
and high robustness with respect to disturbances in both the electrical and 
mechanical subsystems. 
Let ω*(t) be the reference shaft speed and e = ω* − ω be the speed tracking 
error. Defi ne state variables x1 = e and x

(10.1.9)

for sliding mode to exist. Then, after a fi nite time interval, the system state 
will reach the sliding manifold (Equation 10.1.10). Thereafter, the system 
response depends only on the design parameter c.
Figures 10.4 through 10.6 show the simulation results of the proposed 
speed controller. The control gain c is selected as c = 100. Figure 10.4 depicts 
the response of the speed control. As illustrated in the fi gure, the speed tran-
sition time is about 0.05 sec. Figure 10.5 is the wave form of the motor current. 
Bear in mind that the motor current is not controlled explicitly; the ordinary 
behavior of the current is the result of the acceleration control. Figure 10.6 
gives the response of the sliding variable s.
10.1.6. Observer Design
For the implementation of the control algorithm given in Equations 10.1.8 and 
10.1.9, angular acceleration of the shaft is needed for calculating the sliding 
variable s in Equation 10.1.8 attributable to x2 =

. However, in practice, 
the angular acceleration is not measured. Instead, the motor current i and 
the shaft velocity ω are normally available. Numerical differentiation of the 
speed signal may result in a high level of noise in the calculated acceleration 
signal. In this case, the acceleration signal may be calculated as

where the load torque τl is assumed to be known; parameters J and kt may be 
found by an identifi cation process.
However, if the load torque is unknown or is varying under different 
working conditions, we may estimate it by making some assumptions that 
correspond to real-life conditions. For example, we may assume that the load 
torque changes very slowly, i.e., τl = 0. This condition means that the load 
torque is assumed to be constant. Practically, this assumption has great sig-
nifi cance because it provides an equation for the observer design and enables 
one to estimate the load torque that varies “slowly” with the time. The word 
“slowly” is relative to the mechanical and the electrical time constant of the 
DC motor. An observer is proposed here for estimation of the load torque.
To involve the measured current and the velocity signals into the observer 
design, we use the design technique of Luenberger reduced-order asymp-
totic observer (see Section 6.1). An intermediate variable is introduced,
 
z = τl + lω,

Obviously, the poles of the observer system can be placed arbitrarily by 
adjusting the observer gains l1, l2. 
Figures 10.7 and 10.8 show the simulation results of the proposed estima-
tion algorithms in Equations 10.1.12 through 10.1.17 for estimating the load 
torque as well as the shaft acceleration. The observer gain is designed to be 
l = 40. The mass of inertia J in the observer model is selected to have 10% 
difference from the real inertia in the motor model to generate a difference 
in the fi gures. Otherwise, the observer outputs and the model outputs would 
be too close to be distinguished.
10.1.7. Speed Control with Reduced-Order Model
As discussed in the previous sections, speed control of a DC motor requires 
control of either the motor current or the motor acceleration. However, in

some industrial systems, simple relay-controlled DC motors based only 
on speed measurement have been used. In this subsection, we will design 
simplifi ed sliding mode control based only on speed measurement without 
estimation of other state components. Furthermore, the control methods pro-
posed below will solve the chattering problem often encountered in those 
industrial systems.
Normally, the mechanical motion of a DC motor is much slower than the 
electromagnetic dynamics, implying that the relation L
J
<<  holds. Suppose 
the speed tracking error is ωe = ω* − ω; we may rewrite the DC motor model 
in terms of ωe

Calling on the theory of “singularly perturbed systems” [Kokotovic,

The above equation is a reduced-order (fi rst-order) model of the DC motor

However, in real-life systems under sliding mode control, neglected dynam-
ics in the closed loop may result in the so-called chattering phenomenon. 
In the case of the speed controller (Equation 10.1.24), current i is assumed 
to be a linear function of the input voltage u in Equation 10.1.22 because 
of the assumption L ≈ 0. From a macroscopic perspective, this assumption 
holds true. For high-frequency switching of the discontinuous input volt-
age u according to Equation 10.1.24, however, the electrical dynamics prevent 
armature current i from ideal tracking of voltage u, leading to chattering as 
explained in detail in Chapter 8. Moreover, the order reduction technique 
of the singular perturbation theory is formally not applicable to differential 
equations with discontinuous right-hand sides.
In a sliding mode controlled system with unmodeled dynamics, chattering 
can be bypassed by constructing the sliding manifold using observed states 
rather than direct measurements (see also Chapter 7). Bearing in mind the 
assumption τ l = 0, design an asymptotic observer for estimating ωe and τl as

Under this control scheme, chattering is eliminated, whereas the robustness 
provided by the sliding mode control is preserved within an accuracy of L/J 
(remember that the reduced-order equation was obtained under the assump-
tion L
J
/ << 1) . The sliding mode occurs in the observer loop, which does not 
contain unmodeled dynamics. The observer gains l1 and l1 should be cho-
sen to yield mismatch dynamics (Equation 10.1.27) slower than the electrical 
dynamics of the DC motors to prevent chattering. Because the estimated ˆω is 
close to ω, the real speed ω tracks the desired value ω*. Figure 10.9 shows the 
control structure based on the reduced-order model and observed state.
Figure 10.10 shows a simulation result of the reduced-order speed control 
with measured speed (Equation 10.1.24). The high-frequency chattering is 
attributable to neglect of the fast dynamics, i.e., the dynamics of the electric 
part. Figure 10.11 depicts the response of the speed control with observed 
speed using Equation 10.1.26. The observer gains are selected as l1 = l2 = 20. 
As can be seen from the fi gures, the high-frequency chattering now has dis-
appeared, confi rming the theory described above.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
10.1.8. Observer Design for Sensorless Control
Strictly speaking, the word “sensorless” is not correct because one must 
sense or measure some variable to obtain some information as the base of 
estimating the unknown variable(s). Normally, sensorless control of an elec-
tric drive implies that no sensor for any mechanical variable is necessary, but 
electrical variables such as motor current and voltage should be available. In 
the following, we treat the problem of estimating the motor speed and/or the 
load torque based on the motor current and voltage. The methodology used 
here is again based on the sliding mode design principle.

fi rst-order fi lters were analyzed in Section 2.4. In fact, the same methodology 
is applicable for higher-order low-pass fi lters, for example, an l-order low-
pass fi lter such as

ter output; small positive parameter μ < < 1 represents the fi lter time con-
stant. Calling on  the theory of singularly perturbed systems, if μ → 0, then 
y

.
So far, we have discussed the problem of estimating the speed signal. Once 
the speed signal is available, a speed controller may be constructed. Bearing 
in mind that the speed signal is obtained by passing the discontinuous con-
trol through a low-pass fi lter, high-frequency components of the discontin-
uous control may not be fi ltered out completely because of the limitation 
on the fi lter time constant (i.e., μ should be small enough). A sliding mode 
controller will no longer be suitable for speed control because of the high-
frequency disturbances. It would be helpful if the speed control includes an 
integral term, e.g., a PI-type controller is appropriate. In this case, the con-
trolled real speed will follow the mean value of the estimated speed.
10.1.8.2. Estimation of Load Torque
As the speed signal is available, estimated or measured, the load torque can 
also be obtained by applying the sliding mode technique to an observer. 
First, design a speed observer as follows:

(10.1.39)
implying that l2  > |τl| should hold. Because l2 appears only in the observer 
algorithm, it can be selected high enough. Once sliding mode occurs, the 
load torque is equal to the equivalent control of the discontinuous term
l2 sign( )
ω , i.e.,
 
τ
ω
l
eq
l

(10.1.40)
To extract the equivalent control given above, we need a low-pass fi lter 
again.
It should be noted that, during the derivations of the load torque observer, 
no assumption such as τl = 0 was made. Actually, this observer design scheme 
works as long as the spectrum of the load torque does not intersect with the 
spectrum of the high-frequency components of the switching action.
Figures 10.12 through 10.14 show the simulation results of the proposed 
observer algorithms for sensorless control. The observer gains are chosen 
as l1 = l2 = 20000. The low-pass fi lters for extracting the motor speed and 
the load torque are both of Butterworth type with second order. The cutoff 
frequencies of the low-pass fi lters are 1000 and 550 rad/sec, respectively. The 
motor is commanded to follow a block signal of reference speed. As shown 
in Figure 10.12, the estimated speed signal tracks the real speed signal very 
closely, as do the estimated acceleration and the estimated load torque. 
10.1.9. Discussion
Generally speaking, uncertainties in the plant model of any observer design 
will cause the observed state to differ from the real state. If this observed 
state is used within the control loop, it may result in a control error. However, 
if the observer error is within a small range, the control error is also bounded 
by a similar small range, implying that the observed state may still be useful 
for increasing the control performance.
For implementation of an observer, the observer equation should be 
integrated in real time using a microprocessor or signal processor with a 
fi xed sampling period. As a result, the system to be controlled is continu-
ous in time, but the observer in the control computer is a discrete time sys-
tem. Furthermore, the error of the integration will be large if the following 
applies:
 
1. The sampling period of the microprocessor is too large.
 
2. The integration algorithm is primitive.

240 
Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
 
3. The observer gain is too high.
 
4. The time constant of the observer system is too small.
The system accuracy may be improved by decreasing the sampling inter-
val. However, for a larger sampling interval, more complex and effi cient 
control algorithms may be implemented. The control engineer has to fi nd a 
suitable tradeoff. Readers particularly interested in microprocessor imple-
mentation of sliding mode controllers and observers are encouraged to study 
Chapter 9 on discrete-time systems.
10.2. Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors
10.2.1. Introduction
Permanent-magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) belong to the category 
of AC drives. The terminology “brushless DC motor,” used in the fi elds of 
machine tools and robotics, often refers to a current-controlled PMSM.

It is interesting to point out that the discussion of the control problem of 
PMSMs in the fi eld-oriented reference frame, referred to as (d, q) frame, is 
independent from the number of phases of a motor, i.e., no matter of a two-
phase or a three-phase motor, they have the same structure in this coordinate 
frame. The differences lie only on the forward and backward transforma-
tions of the states and controls (here, currents and voltages). In fact, a model 
in the (d, q) frame is an uniform description of an AC device based on the 
electromagnetic principle including all types of AC drives and power con-
verters. Control design methods performed in the (d, q) coordinates are 
called fi eld-oriented control (FOC). FOC is sometimes referred to as “vector 
control,” implying that a current vector should be controlled rather than only 
one current component as in the case of a pure DC motor. The principle of 
FOC was developed more than 30 years ago [Blaschke 1974]. From a control 
point of view, this control approach uses a state transformation, after which 
the decoupling and linearization tasks can be performed easily. Recently, 
because of the rapid progress in the technology of semiconductors, high-
speed microprocessors as well as signal processors are massively introduced

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
in the area of electric drive systems. As a result, the concept of FOC has been 
implemented in many drive systems of AC machines. The remaining prob-
lem is robustness associated with parameter variations and load variations. 
Theoretically, sliding mode control provides advantages over conven-
tional control designs (e.g., decoupling, linearization, linear control, and 
PWM) because of the simple control structure and the robustness prop-
erty of the sliding mode control principle. However, it is recognized that, in 
microprocessor-based implementations, the sampling interval and thus the 
minimum switching interval of the sliding mode controller, is much larger 
than the resolution of a hardware-based PWM. As a result, some deteriora-
tion in control performance was observed. This problem may be solved by 
discrete-time sliding mode control (see Chapter 9) in conjunction with hard-
ware PWM techniques. Moreover, because the structure of a sliding mode 
controller is very simple, a nonmicroprocessor, purely hardware-based 
implementation is possible and often leads to favorable results. Hence, the 
effectiveness of the sliding mode control can be fully demonstrated without 
using PWM units.

10.2.2. Modeling of Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors
The structure of a PMSM-based drive system is shown in Figure 10.15. For 
sliding mode control design, it is convenient if the control inputs take values 
from the discrete set {–u0, u0} instead of on-off signals from the discrete set 
{0, 1}. Let the six on-off signals be sw = [sw1 sw2 sw3 sw4 sw5 sw6]T with sw4 = 1 − sw1, 
sw5 = 1 − sw2, and sw6 = 1 − sw3, and the control inputs for sliding mode control 
design be Ugate = [u1 u2 u3]T, then the following relation holds

matrix, respectively; and ΨM is the fl ux vector caused by the permanent 
 magnet, if applicable.
The system in Equation 10.2.3 is a general description of electromagnetic 
effects and is independent of the used coordinate system. For PMSMs, three 
reference frames are normally used for describing the dynamic behavior of a 
motor (see Figure 10.16): the phase frame, i.e., the (a, b, c) coordinate frame; the 
stator frame, i.e., the (α, β) coordinate frame; and the fi eld-oriented frame, i.e., 
the (d, q) coordinate frame (same as the rotor coordinate frame for PMSMs). 
For a symmetrical PMSM in the (a, b, c) coordinate, the fl ux components 
generated by the permanent magnet are given as
 
Ψma = λ0 cos θe,
 
Ψmb = λ0 cos (θe − 2π/3), 
(10.2.4)
 
Ψmc = λ0 cos (θe + 2π/3),
where λ0 is the fl ux linkage of the permanent magnet and θe is the electri-
cal angular position of the motor rotor. The electrical motion equations of a 
PMSM, neglecting the reluctance effects, can be written as

and the d component of the EMF ed is equal to zero. Note the second equation 
in Equation 10.2.14. If the current component id could be made equal to zero, 
we would get exactly the behavior of a constant-excited DC motor. This is the 
main idea of fi eld-oriented control: to decouple the motor dynamics such that 
the resulting system behaves like a DC motor. The current vector [id iq]T and the 
voltage vector [ud uq]T can be transformed from the (α, β) coordinate frame

being the number of pole pairs of the motor, and ωr is the mechanical angu-
lar speed of the motor rotor. 
In developing the motor models, we assume that there is no reluctance 
torque in the PMSM motor. Under this assumption, the output torque of the 
motor is proportional to the q-axis stator current iq. The mechanical motion

Throughout this section, the motor parameters used to verify the design 
principles are as follows: L = 1.0 mH, R = 0.5 Ω, J = 0.001 kg⋅m2, B = 0.001 
Nm⋅sec/rad, Nr = 4, λ0 = 0.001 V⋅s/rad, and kt = (3/2)λ0Nr Nm/A. The supplied 
link voltage is u0 = 20 V. 
So far we have discussed the model descriptions in the different coordi-
nate systems and the transformations of the state variables and the control 
signals between these reference frames. In the following sections, we deal 
with the sliding mode control issues of PMSMs.
10.2.3. Sliding Mode Current Control
The goal of the current control is to design a current controller to track the 
desired currents that are normally provided by an outer-loop speed/posi-
tion controller. A current controller can be implemented with either pure 
hardware or a microprocessor. The so-called “chopper control” and “hyster-
esis control” are the hardware versions of a current controller attributable to 
the simplicity in the implementation. For the fi eld-oriented current control, 
however, a microprocessor-based implementation is recommended. Current 
control based on the sliding mode approach can be implemented either with 
pure hardware or within a microprocessor, and, for both implementations, 
the control performance provided by the fi eld orientation concept can be 
achieved. 
In the context of sliding mode control of AC drives, there are two methods 
to determine the discontinuous controls u1, u2, u3 as well as the on-off signals 
sw1, sw2, sw3, sw4, sw5, sw6. The on-off signals may also be called switching pat-
terns. The switching patterns are the control signals feeding to the gates of 
the power converters, e.g., a voltage source inverter as shown in Figure 10.15. 
The fi rst method implies that the control voltages ud and uq are designed 
using the existence condition of sliding mode and mapping the resulting 
controls to the switching patterns of the inverter. The second method deter-
mines the switching patterns directly using the method of switching surface 
transformation (see Section 3.2). Both methods are able to generate switching 
commands for the voltage source inverter without involving the traditional 
PWM technique. 
10.2.3.1. First Method for Current Control
Because the model in (d, q) coordinates gives clear physical interpretation 
in terms of a DC motor, we prefer to start with this model. Equation 10.2.14 
is still a coupled nonlinear dynamic system with two control inputs ud and 
uq. However, as mentioned above, if we are able to reduce the current com-
ponent id to zero, we would get exactly the same behavior as for a DC motor 
with constant excitation fl ux. Another difference from a DC motor is that all 
variables with subscripts d and q cannot be measured directly but rather are 
transformed from the variables measured in the (a, b, c) coordinate frame. For

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
performing this transformation, the electrical angular position of the rotor 
θe is required.
As in the DC motor case, for current control of a PMSM, we may design the 
switching functions as the difference between the desired and real currents. 
Select the switching functions for both current components id and iq as

(10.2.31)
where id
* and iq
* denote the desired value for the currents id and iq, respec-
tively. Conventional fi eld-oriented control of PMSMs uses linear con-
trol design techniques. The nonlinear model (Equation 10.2.14) has to be 
decoupled and linearized before linear control techniques can be applied. 
However, because the sliding mode control approach belongs to the cat-
egory of nonlinear control techniques, no such decoupling and linear-
ization procedures are necessary. Nevertheless, it can be shown that the 
controlled errors, i.e., sd and sq, vanish after fi nite time. As to the switch-
ing functions given by Equation 10.2.31, the existence condition of sliding 
mode (Equation 2.4.1) may be applied to fi nd the controls. Select the con-
trol voltages as 
 
ud = ud0 sign(sd),
 
uq = uq0 sign(sq), 
(10.2.32)
where ud0, uq0 are the amplitudes of ud, uq, respectively. It follows from

Obviously, unlike in the case of DC motors, in addition to the back EMF, the 
control voltages should suppress the coupling terms that are proportional to 
the angular speed of the motor rotor.

Remark 10.1
 
1. In the case of discontinuous reference currents id
* and iq
* with associ-
ated “large” time derivatives, the real currents will not be able to 
follow their reference values. This can happen, for example, if the 
outer-loop controllers use high feedback gains. Because of the induc-
tive nature of electric drives, discontinuous reference currents cannot 
be followed with any controller. However, a sliding mode controller 
is able to immediately use the full available control resources ud0 and 
uq0 such that the fastest possible response is guaranteed.
 
2. It is also possible to perform the decoupling and linearization pro-
cedure fi rst and then apply the sliding mode technique to the result-
ing linear system. In this case, the resulting control voltages ud and 
uq will no longer be in the form of sign function but will contain an 
additive continuous part attributable to the decoupling procedure. 
Because the decoupling procedure involves the motor parameters, 
the resulting control is sensitive to these parameters. 
Once the control voltages ud and uq are obtained, the next step is to map 
them into the switching patterns of the inverter. Lookup table techniques 
are often used for this purpose with the electrical angular position θe as 
the input of the table [Sabanovich and Utkin 1994]. This solution is simple 
but cannot implement arbitrary voltage vectors [ud uq]T because of the fi nite 
resolution of a lookup table. In the following, we propose a novel PWM 
technique using the sliding mode principle, which may be called “sliding 
mode PWM.”
The basic problem is that the controls u1, u2, and u3, required by the inverter, 
take only discrete values −u0 or u0. As a result, a direct implementation of 
the transformation Ad q,
, ,
1 2 3
(
)
+ is not possible. Instead, a second set of switching 
functions is defi ned for u1, u2, and u3.

which implies that the coordinate transformation (Equation 10.2.35) was 
implemented exactly by the proposed method.
As the last step of the control design, the resulting discontinuous controls 
u1, u2, and u3 will be transformed to the switching patterns sw1, sw2, sw3, sw4, sw5, 
sw6 using Equation 10.2.2.
At this point, we have completed the design procedure for the fi rst ver-
sion of the current control. For the implementation, phase currents ia, ib, ic 
should be available. The design sequence assumes that an outer control loop 
provides desired currents id
* and iq
* and can be summarized in the following 
steps.
Step 1: Transform the measured phase currents ia, ib, ic into the (d, q) coor-
dinate frame to obtain the torque current iq and the fi eld current id using 
Equation 10.2.18. In practice, only two components of the phase currents are 
measured; the third one is calculated according to the balance condition, e.g., 
ic = −(ia + ib).

that the inequalities in Equation 10.2.34 and u0 > ui

Figure 10.17 shows an example of the proposed sliding mode PWM tech-
nique that modulates a sinusoidal voltage waveform to the width of a switch-
ing signal. Figure 10.18 gives the simulation result of the proposed current 
controller. The relatively high switching noise is attributable to the integra-
tion error of the sliding mode PWM, caused by the fi nite sampling period. 
Also, the integration action in closed loop may introduce additional dynam-
ics that enlarge the high-frequency oscillations. The reference currents are

10.2.3.2. Second Method for Current Control
The second version of the current control is able to generate the discontin-
uous controls u1, u2, and u3 directly without involving a PWM technique. 
Moreover, this design method is theoretically compact and straightforward 
(although no PWM technique is used, the implementation does not imply 
that the role of a power converter is reduced to amplifying some continuous 
control signal). This method may need high enough DC link voltage u0 for 
every time instant.

V < 0 will be guaranteed for all possible l, m, n. This proof implies that sd = 0, 
sq = 0 can be reached in fi nite time by switching directly the discontinuous 
controls u1, u2, and u3 in sign according to Equation 10.2.44. 
□
Similar to the fi rst version of the current control, the next step is to map 
the resulting controls u1, u2, and u3 into the switching patterns applied to the 
inverter. For this purpose, Equation 10.2.2 can be used.
For the implementation, matrix Ad q,

The reader familiar with conventional current control of AC motors 
will immediately recognize that Equation 10.2.56 is similar to the con-
ventional techniques, in which, for reducing heat loss and electric-
magnetic disturbances caused by the switching actions, a hysteresis circuit is 
usually added after each sign function, or, alternatively, the switching actions 
are synchronized with a fi xed clock source. The former is called hysteresis 
control and the latter chopper control.
The sliding mode method presented here gives a condition, inequality 
Equation 10.2.54, for the current controller to be effective. Furthermore, it 
provides a way of transforming the reference currents i

 (see Equation

* is set to zero if no 
fi eld weakening operation (see Section 10.2.4) is required. For fi eld weaken-
ing operations of a PMSM, reference current id
* should be varied depending 
on the current motor speed. Reference current iq
*, provided by an outer-loop 
controller, corresponds to the required motor torque.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Figure 10.19 shows the simulation results of the second version of the cur-
rent control. The reference currents are the same as in the case of the fi rst 
version of the current control.
10.2.4. Speed Control
Similar to DC motors, speed control of permanent-magnet synchronous 
motors can be realized in a cascaded control structure, with a current con-
troller in an inner loop and a speed controller in an outer loop, providing the 
reference currents id
* and iq
* for the inner loop. As discussed in the preceding 
section, reference current id
* is normally set to zero such that the motor is able 
to provide a constant torque. However, in some applications, high torque or 
high-speed performance is desired. For high-speed operation, the reference 
current id
* may be varied from zero to some negative value depending on the 
current motor speed. This technique is called fi eld-weakening technique and 
is able to extend the operation range of the motor speed several times larger 
than in the case of zero id
*. See the work of Shi and Lu [1996] for details of the 
fi eld-weakening operation of PMSMs.

For the outer speed control loop, most control techniques may be applied, 
with the exception of high gain and sliding mode techniques, because the 
reference input of the inner control loop should have a bounded time deriva-
tive. This may explain why some researchers argue that sliding mode con-
trol techniques do not work properly for some mechanical systems such as 
robotics manipulators. In general, a high gain or a sliding mode controller 
may only be used once in a cascaded control structure, namely, in the most 
internal control loop.
A suitable solution for designing the speed controller is to apply sliding 
mode control directly to the motor model to achieve the discontinuous con-
trols u1, u2, and u3 without explicitly involving a current control loop. This 
control scheme may be called “direct speed control.” The advantages of such 
a control scheme have already been stated in the section on speed control of 
DC motors. Because we deal with sliding mode control applications, we are 
interested in the details of the direct speed control for permanent-magnet 
synchronous motors.

tion, id

the condition V < 0 holds for all possible l, m, n. It means that the surfaces 
sd = 0, sω = 0 are reached in fi nite time in the system with the discontinuous 
controls u1, u2, and u3 given in Equation 10.2.63.

By high enough u0, the proposed speed controller is robust with respect

F . Again, the knowledge on exact 
values of Fdω is not needed for the implementation. Only matrix Dω
+ is rel-
evant, because we need this matrix for calculating the switching function 
transformation. 
To construct the sliding surface sw = 0, the acceleration signal of the motor 
rotor is needed. Normally, this variable cannot be obtained directly but rather 
has to be obtained by a state observer based on the measured rotor speed and 
stator currents. Similar techniques as in Section 10.1.6 for the control of DC 
motors can be applied to retrieve the acceleration signal. 
Figures 10.20 and 10.21 show the simulation results of the proposed sliding 
mode speed controller. The transition time of the speed control is about 0.1 
sec. Figure 10.21 gives the smoothed wave forms of the motor currents. Bear 
in mind that the current iq is not controlled explicitly; the ordinary behavior 
of the current components is the result of the acceleration control. The con-
trol gain c in Equation 10.2.57 is selected as c = 50.
10.2.5. Current Observer
From the viewpoint of practical applications, it is of interest to design a con-
trol system with no current transducers. In practice, there are two  diffi culties 
to obtain the stator currents id and iq in the fi eld-oriented  coordinate frame.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
The fi rst one is attributable to the noise in the measured phase currents ia 
and ib , and the second one is attributable to the coordinate transformation. 
The noise problem is evident, whereas the second diffi culty lies in the speed 
limitation of the calculation unit used for the transformation. Usually, ia 
and ib are high-frequency signals compared with the current components id 
and iq, especially for PMSMs with a large number of pole pairs. These high-
frequency signals must be sampled with a high enough sampling rate; other-
wise, information will be lost. Furthermore, to transform the measured phase 
currents into the fi eld-oriented coordinate frame, the rotor position signal 
with high enough resolution must be available. This is normally achieved by 
involving a high-resolution incremental encoder. 
As a result, it is meaningful to design a current observer using the rotor 
speed measurement. Examination of the motor model leads to the conclu-
sion that online simulation of the motor model suffi ces to achieve a sta-
ble observation of the stator currents. Let ˆid and ˆiq be the estimates of the 
stator currents; the observer equations are just a copy of the motor model 
(Equation 10.2.14),

10.2.6. Observer for Speed Sensorless Control
In the section concerning the DC-motor control, we have discussed the issue 
of sensorless control. Sensorless control of AC machines is more diffi cult 
than the control of DC motors because of the coupling effects in the motor 
dynamics. 
The terminology sensorless control indicates that some internal states 
of a dynamic system are available, measured or estimated, but the output

 measurements are unknown; however, these unmeasured output variables 
serve as principal control variables. In the case of PMSMs, the phase voltages 
(or the line voltages) and the phase currents are normally measured, whereas 
the motor speed ωr as well as the motor position θr are unknown, despite 
being the principal control variables of a PMSM drive system.
To estimate these variables, the motor model in the fi eld-oriented coor-
dinate frame (i.e., the (d, q) coordinate frame) is usually not used, because 
the state variables in this coordinate frame are transformed from the fi xed 
coordinate frames (i.e., from (a, b, c) coordinate frame through (α, β) coordi-
nate frame) using transformation matrix Adq
a b c
, ,  defi ned by Equation 10.2.19 
for which the electrical angular position of the motor rotor θe is essential. As 
a result, the model in (α, β) coordinate frame is usually used. Rewriting the 
motor model in this coordinate system yields

Conventional approaches to sensorless control of PMSMs usually follow a 
two-step procedure. First, the induced EMF components are observed. The 
electrical angular speed and position are then derived in a second step. 
Furthermore, in conventional sensorless control designs, the mechanical 
motion equation is normally involved in the observation algorithms. This 
model contains inaccurate mechanical parameters as well as the unknown 
load torque that are recognized to be major obstacles. Here, we propose a 
sliding-mode-based observer design technique using only the electrical 
motion equations.

 denote the observation errors. The mis-
match dynamics are disturbed by the unknown induced EMF compo-
nents. However, because the EMF components are bounded, they can be 
suppressed by discontinuous inputs with l1 > max(|eα|, |eβ|). Then, sliding 
mode with iα = 0, iβ = 0 will occur after a fi nite time interval. To examine 
the system behavior during sliding mode, the equivalent control method 
(see Section 2.3) is exploited. We formally set di

Again, to extract eα, eβ from the corresponding equivalent control values in 
Equation 10.2.74, we use low-pass fi lters with zα, zβ as the fi lter outputs
 
zα(t) = eα(t) + Δμ(t),
 
zβ(t) = eβ(t) + Δμ(t), 
(10.2.75)
where Δμ(t) is the error determined by the distortions of both slow and fast 
components of the discontinuous fi lter input. Filter time constant μ directly 
determines the amount of error Δμ(t). It should be chosen small enough to 
have fi lter dynamics faster than those of the system (Equation 10.2.70) and at 
the same time not too small, to fi lter out the high-frequency components of 
the discontinuous switching actions. 
10.2.6.2. Observer for EMF Components
For high-performance applications, zα, zβ cannot be used directly as the esti-
mation of the induced EMF components, because they contain disturbance 
Δμ(t). Model Equations 10.2.71 are thus needed to design the observer for bet-
ter fi ltering and simultaneously estimating the rotation speed. The following 
observer is designed to undertake this fi ltering task

Remark 10.2 
To develop the EMF model discussed in this section, we assumed that the 
motor speed varies slowly. Under this assumption, the observation problem 
can be simplifi ed signifi cantly. For the case of variable speed, it is also pos-
sible to design an observer; however, the convergence proof is a considerably 
more complicated problem.

Figures 10.23 through 10.25 show the simulation results of the proposed 
observers for the speed sensorless control, i.e., from Equations 10.2.72 to 
10.2.76. As shown in Figure 10.23, the observed speed converges to the true 
speed rapidly. To show the convergence process, the initial conditions of the 
observed EMF components are selected differently from those of the real 
EMF components: ˆ ( )

10.2.7. Discussion
Dynamic models in each coordinate frame have been given as the starting 
point of this section. Two versions of current controllers have been pre-
sented. The fi rst version is a standard method of sliding mode current control 
except the last part for deriving the control voltages: instead of the standard 
table lookup approach, the so-called sliding mode PWM technique has been 
introduced. 
The second version of the current control is actually an open-loop approach 
of fi eld-oriented control, i.e., the current controller is actually implemented in 
phase coordinates rather than in (d, q) coordinates, only the reference currents 
are transformed from the fi eld-oriented coordinates. As has been shown, if 
the link voltage is high enough, it is equivalent to the closed-loop approach 
(pure fi eld-oriented approach). Moreover, the stability condition is given and 
the resulting control algorithm is very simple. For speed control, we have not 
followed the traditional control structure, i.e., the cascade control structure, 
because it has been discussed in many textbooks. Instead, motor speed and 
acceleration are controlled simultaneously without an inner current control 
loop. The advantages are fast response and robustness with respect to the

mechanical parameters, but the motor acceleration has to be available. The 
motor acceleration can be estimated based on the motor model and the speed 
measurements, which involves a larger calculation overhead.
To avoid using (often noisy) current sensors, a current observer may be 
implemented in fi eld-oriented coordinates. However, the dynamic response 
of this observer is sensitive to the motor parameters and relies on the volt-
age vector that is usually not measured. Instead, the reference voltages 
feeding to the power converter, i.e., the outputs of the current controllers, 
are normally used, which may be slightly different from the real voltages 
applied to the motor windings.
As the last part of this section, the sensorless control issue has been treated 
based on a sliding mode observer combined with a conventional asymp-
totic observer. Any algorithm for sensorless control problem will rely on 
model parameters. In the presence of modeling uncertainties, the control 
 performance may not be as good as expected.

10.3. Induction Motors 
10.3.1. Introduction
From a control point of view, induction motors are nonlinear, high-order 
dynamic systems of considerable complexity. They are quite amenable to 
a formal mathematical analysis. However, it is not a trivial matter to com-
prehend the principles of their operation in an imaginative way, especially 
under transient conditions. Conversely, induction motors are widely used 
in practical systems because of their simple mechanical construction, low 
maintenance requirements, and lower cost compared with other types of 
motors, such as brushless DC motors. Therefore, it is of great signifi cance to 
investigate the dynamic control problems of these kinds of drive systems.
As discussed in the previous section on permanent-magnet synchronous 
motors, the fi eld-oriented coordinate frame coincides with the rotor coor-
dinate frame, such that only three frames of reference are considered. For

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
an induction motor, however, the fi eld (normally the rotor fl ux)-oriented 
 coordinate frame differs from the rotor coordinate frame; hence, there are 
four different frames of reference to be considered. 
For an induction motor, the angular difference between the rotor fl ux 
and the electrical angular position of the rotor is called “slip.” Its time 
derivative is called “slip frequency,” which is proportional to the devel-
oped motor torque. All state and control variables in the fi eld-oriented 
coordinate frame are transformed based on the rotor-fl ux angular posi-
tion ρ, called “rotor-fl ux angle” in the sequel, instead of the electrical rotor 
angle θe. To calculate the rotor fl ux angle, a “fl ux observer” is used because 
fl ux measurements are usually not available. If the electrical angular speed 
of the rotor, ωe, is available, as proven later, the fl ux observer is simply an 
online simulation of the fl ux dynamics in the stator coordinate frame (the 
α, β coordinates); the rate of convergence depends on the rotor time con-
stant. However, it is recognized that this time constant may vary slowly 
with changing ambient temperature. As a result, some online adaptation 
mechanisms are often involved, making the control problem of induction 
motors more complicated than the control of permanent-magnet synchro-
nous motors. Moreover, if the rotor speed is not available, so-called sen-
sorless control techniques have to be used. Currently, sensorless control 
techniques are not mature enough for application in high-performance 
industrial systems.
The current research in the control of induction motors is characterized by 
a great variety of control methodologies with different control/observation/
adaptation algorithms combined with different coordinate systems, different 
state variables, and different notations. For the sliding mode control design 
described in this section, we mainly use the dynamic model given in the 
orthogonal stator coordinate frame (the α, β coordinates), with stator current 
components and rotor fl ux components as state variables, complemented by 
the mechanical equation.
10.3.2. Model of the Induction Motor
The structure of an induction motor drive system is shown in Figure 10.26. 
For sliding mode control design, it is convenient if the control inputs take 
values from the discrete set {−u0, u0} instead of on-off signals from the dis-
crete set {0, 1}. Let the six on-off signals be sw = [sw1 sw2 sw3 sw4 sw5 sw6]T with sw4 
= 1 − sw1, sw5 = 1 − sw2, sw6 = 1 − sw3, and the control inputs for sliding mode 
control design be Ugate = [u1 u2 u3]T; then the following relation holds: 
 
Ugate = u0Lwsw with Lw =

The backward transformation can be obtained as
 
sw1 = 0.5(1 + u1/u0), sw4 = 1 − sw1,
 
sw2 = 0.5(1 + u2/u0), sw5 = 1 − sw2, 
(10.3.2)
 
sw3 = 0.5(1 + u3/u0), sw6 = 1 − sw3. 
Four frames of reference are normally used for describing the dynamic 
behavior of the motor (see Figure 10.27): the phase frame in (a, b, c) coordi-
nates, the stator frame in (α, β) coordinates, the rotor frame in (x, y) coordi-
nates, and the fi eld-oriented frame in (d, q) coordinates. 
The relationship between the phase voltages ua, ub, uc and the discontinu-
ous controls u1, u2, u3 can be given as follows:
 
[ua ub uc]T = G[u1 u2 u3]T,

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Thus far, the induction motor model in the (α, β) and in the (d, q) coordinate 
systems has been presented. Current and voltage transformations between 
the different coordinate systems were also given. They are very important 
for the control design of induction motors. 
Rotor fl ux-oriented current control of induction motors is very similar 
to that of permanent-magnet synchronous motors (see Section 10.2.3). The 
major difference lies in the angle used for the current/voltage transforma-
tions. Here, the rotor fl ux angle ρ is used instead of the electrical rotor angle 
θe. It is recognized that, for high control performance, angle ρ should be 
available. For a sliding mode-based control design, the angle ρ is needed 
as well.
We begin with the rotor fl ux observation problem with known rotor angu-
lar speed. Then, simultaneous observation of rotor fl ux and rotor speed is 
discussed, which is essential for sensorless control of an induction motor. In 
the next step, we deal with rotor speed and rotor time constant estimation. 
Finally, we discuss direct torque and fl ux control based on the sliding mode 
control principle. The topics of sliding mode current control and direct speed 
control are omitted here because of the similarity with permanent-magnet 
synchronous motors (see Sections 10.2.3 and 10.2.4).
10.3.3. Rotor Flux Observer with Known Rotor Speed
10.3.3.1. Online Simulation of Rotor Flux Model 
The original motion equation of the rotor fl ux can be used directly as the 
observer equation. The implementation of such a fl ux observer is just the 
online simulation of the controlled induction motor. As proven below, this 
observer is stable in the large with the rate of convergence depending on the 
rotor time constant. In this case, the observer equations are given by

This means that by simply integrating Equation 10.3.24, the mismatch 
between the real and estimated rotor fl ux will tend to zero asymptotically, 
and the rate of the convergence depends on the rotor time constant 1/η. The 
rate of convergence may be improved by properly designed observer gains 
as usually done for reduced-order observers (see next approach given in the 
sequel). 
With the estimates of the rotor fl ux components, the rotor fl ux angle ˆρ can 
be calculated as 
 
ˆ
arctan( ˆ

Figure 10.28 depicts the simulation results of the rotor fl ux observer

of the observed fl ux components are selected differently from those of the 
real fl ux components: ˆ ( )

λβ 0

λβ(0) = 0. Because the fl ux observer is just the online simulation of the motor 
model, no observer gain is to be adjusted. 
10.3.3.2. Sliding Mode Observer with Adjustable Rate of Convergence 
Now a fl ux observer based on the sliding mode approach with measure-
ments of stator current, state voltages, and rotor speed is demonstrated. 
Compared with the open-loop fl ux observer discussed before, this observer 
has the advantage that its convergence rate is tunable.

If V0 > max{|fα|,|fβ|}, then V < 0 until iα = 0 and iβ = 0, which means that 
sliding mode will occur in the intersection of the surfaces iα = 0 and iβ = 0. 
The estimated currents ˆiα and ˆiβ will converge to the real currents after 
 sliding mode has been reached in iα = 0 and iβ = 0. 
The equivalent control components Vα _eq and Vβ _eq of the discontinuous 
functions Vα and Vβ can be obtained by setting iα = 0, iα = 0 and iβ = 0, iβ = 0

from which we can see that the convergence rate of the fl ux observer is 
 determined by η(1 + βk). Increasing the tunable and positive observer gain k 
leads to faster convergence, in contrast to the open-loop fl ux observer with 
the convergence rate determined by the rotor time constant 1η.
The simulation results in Figure 10.29 show that the estimated rotor fl ux 
converges immediately to the real rotor fl ux after the observer equations 
being executed. In the simulation, V0 = 5000 and k = 0.004 are selected. Note 
that V0 > max{|fα|,|fβ|} is required, but fα and fβ are functions of rotor speed 
ωe. To keep the chattering level (attributable to limited sample time) in the 
current observation within a reasonable range, V0 may be selected to be rotor 
speed dependent. 
The sliding mode fl ux observer is not the only way to achieve an adjustable 
convergence rate. Similar results can be achieved by an asymptotic observer 
(i.e., Luenberger observer) applied to the reduced order model λ

10.3.4. Simultaneous Observation of Rotor Flux and Rotor Speed
Simultaneous observation of rotor fl ux and rotor speed has been a challeng-
ing problem in the control of induction motors. Different approaches use the 
physical properties of induction motors, such as
Structural modifi cation of motor rotor [Lorenz 1995]
Extraction of speed information from the harmonic components 
[Jiang and Holtz 1997]
Test current method [Blaschke, Vandenput, and van der Burgt 1995]
Involving stator fl ux estimation [Xu and Novotny 1993]
The above methods were tested in practical systems and shown to yield 
a well acceptable performance at very low rotor speed. Another trend in 
the research of sensorless control involves sophisticated control/estimation 
algorithms without additional source of information being exploited. These 
methods include some adaptive/robust algorithms, such as 
Kalman-Filter method [Henneberger, Brunsbach, and Klepsch 1991]
Model reference adaptive control method [Tamai, Sugimoto, and 
Yano 1987]
The fl ux/speed observer discussed here is an extended version of [Isozimov 
1983] and was presented by Yan, Jin, and Utkin [2000], in which some other 
important research works on this topic are referenced. 
The objective in this subsection is to design a fl ux/speed observer to esti-
mate the rotor fl ux and rotor speed simultaneously based on the measure-
ment of the stator currents and voltages, under the natural assumption that 
there exists a torque/fl ux controller such that the estimated torque and esti-
mated rotor fl ux are controlled and following their references.
The observer is designed as

Note that sn and sμ are actually proportional to the current estimation errors

instead of the real rotor fl ux angle.
First, it will be shown that there exist constant values n0 and μ0 such that 
sliding mode occurs in the surfaces of sn = 0 and sμ = 0, and, as a result, the

tinuous variable ˆωe tends to the real speed ωe. 
10.3.4.1. Analysis of Current Tracking
To analyze the convergence of the estimates to the real values in the pro-
posed observer structure, we fi rst need to analyze the stator current track-
ing property. As it follows from the observer equations (Equation 10.3.37) 
and the motor model equations (Equation 10.3.5), the error dynamics with

As seen from Equation 10.3.49, if the estimated rotor fl ux converges to the 
real fl ux, which leads to e1 = 0 and e2 = 0 (see Equation 10.3.46), then, ˆ _
ωe
eqwill 
tend to the real rotor (electrical) speed. The next step is to prove e1 = 0 and 
e2 = 0. Before doing that, let us go through the following remarks.
Remark 10.3.1
Equation 10.3.49 is only for the theoretical analysis to show that the equiva-
lent control of ˆ
(
)
ωe
n
n sign s
=
0
, i.e., ˆ _
ωe
eq is indeed equal to the real rotor speed. 
In practice, however, ˆ _

eq will be obtained through a low-pass fi lter with 
discontinuous term ˆ

(10.3.50)
where the time constant of the low-pass fi lter, tc, should be small compared 
with the slow component of n0sign(sn) but large enough to fi lter out the high 
rate component.
Remark 10.3.2
The condition Equation 10.3.47 for sliding mode to occur on the surface sn = 0 
is not very restrictive because the stator currents iα and iβ are measurable. We 
can always choose the initial conditions αˆ ( )
i
0  and 
βˆ ( )
i
0  close enough to the 
true stator currents iα(0) and iβ(0) such that the initial errors 
α
i ( )
0  and 
β
i ( )
0 , 
and hence sμ, are small enough to guarantee that this condition holds.
Remark 10.3.3
Although the structure of the observer is selected in the framework of the 
work by Isozimov [1983], an extension is made to guarantee the conver-
gence of the observer. It will be shown later that, under certain conditions, the 
asymptotic stability of the sliding mode observer can be guaranteed with the 
fl ux errors 
α
λ  and 
β
λ  converging to zero and z tending to the real speed ωe.
Remark 10.3.4
Although the fl ux/speed observer is of the fourth order, after sliding mode 
occurs on the surfaces sn = 0 and sμ = 0, the error dynamics of the sliding 
mode observer are actually of second order. This order-reduction property 
of the sliding mode is very helpful for the stability analysis of the nonlinear 
time-varying error system.

10.3.4.2. Composite Observer-Controller Analysis
Now we will prove that e1 → 0 and e2 → 0 under certain conditions. In a con-
trol system based on observed state variables, the solutions of the observer 
will be under some constrains regarding the reference inputs of the con-
trol system. For a properly designed controller, the observed state variables 
closely follow their references and cannot become arbitrarily large.
Assumption 
There exists a torque/fl ux controller such that the estimated torque and esti-
mated rotor fl ux are controlled to follow their references starting from some 
time instant, i.e.,

We have described qualitatively the fl ux convergence issue based on the 
motion separation approach.
Remark 10.3.5
According to the theory of singularly perturbed systems, the asymptotic 
stability of the fast motion of the error dynamic (Equation 10.3.61) requires 
that the parameter C and ˆ _
ωe
eq have the same sign. Because the equivalent 
speed ˆ _
ωe
eq can be calculated through Equation 10.3.50 online, the sign of 
the parameter C can be adapted accordingly. At the instants when ωe_eq = 0, 
the stability of the system in Equation 10.3.61 will depend on the signs of 
parameter C and parameter a, whereas a has the same sign as the reference 
torque. Thus, the sign of parameter C can be adapted to the sign of the refer-
ence torque, guaranteeing the stability of the system. 
10.3.4.3. Simulation Results
The proposed estimation algorithm was fi rst simulated using Matlab®. In 
the simulation, the torque/fl ux controller was also implemented besides 
the sliding mode observer to build up the whole closed-loop system. For the 
torque/fl ux control in the simulation, no PWM technique was used and the 
dynamics in the voltage source inverter were ignored. 
Parameters used in the torque controller, the fl ux/speed observer, and the 
induction motor model for the simulations are listed in Table 10.2. Figures 
10.30 through 10.34 show the piecewise continuous situation, and Figures 
10.35 through 10.39 show the sinusoidal situation for torque tracking. From 
these simulation results, we can see that the proposed sliding mode fl ux/
speed observer exhibits high accuracy. Note that convergence of estimations 
to real values of fl ux and speed takes place if torque estimate tracks the refer-
ence input.
10.3.4.4. Experimental Results
The proposed control scheme was also implemented in a laboratory experi-
ment. The real-time control and estimation program was written in C. The 
proposed algorithm was tested at the experiment environment in PEEM

induction machine with the parameters listed in Table 10.3.

a digital signal processor (DSP) system; the induction motor and associated 
voltage source inverters; an optical encoder attached to the motor shaft for

the  verifi cation and comparison of the speed estimation; cables for connect-
ing the whole analog/digital signals; and AC current sensors. 
The torque control is executed every 100 μsec, which serves the insulated 
gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter with a switching frequency of 10.5 kHz. 
Because the system was tested without load, we had to apply a sign-varying 
torque reference input.
To verify and compare the estimated fl ux of our sliding mode observer 
without using a rotor speed sensor, the reduced-ordered observer (Equation 
10.3.24) with rotor speed sensor is used, because direct measurement of rotor 
fl ux is generally not possible. Figure 10.40 shows the result of the experiment 
in which only the torque/fl ux controller is implemented while the speed is 
measured by the optical sensor. ˆτ is defi ned as ˆ

The rotor fl ux is from the reduced-ordered observer with known rotor speed. 
Figure 10.41 shows the fl ux estimations of the fourth-order sliding mode 
observer (Equation 10.3.37). We also compare them with the fl ux estimation 
from the reduced-ordered observer. Figure 10.42 shows the results for the 
system with both the torque/fl ux controller and sliding mode observer work-
ing together. In this case, we do not need to use the optical sensor to obtain 
the speed, i.e., we implemented the real sensorless control. All the variables 
needed for the controller implementation, such as fl ux components, their 
derivatives, and rotor speed, are obtained from the sliding mode observer.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
In the experiment, the rotor speed control was also implemented. Speed 
control can be achieved based on the torque control using a cascaded 
structure. For the case of zero load, dωe/dt = (P/J)τ. As shown in the sim-
ulation and the experiment, the estimate ωe_eq tends to ωe; therefore, if 
the torque is set as τ

10.3.5. Speed, Rotor Time Constant Observer, and Experimental Results 
This section describes a new closed-loop approach to estimate the induction 
motor speed and rotor time constant from measured terminal voltages and 
stator currents [see also Derdiyok, Yan, Guven, and Utkin 2001]. A new state 
space system is defi ned without explicitly involving the fl ux information of 
the motor. A Lyapunov function is derived to determine the motor speed 
and the rotor time constant simultaneously, under the condition that these 
two quantities are unknown constant parameters. The rotor time constant 
estimation is useful to compensate the rotor resistance variation, especially 
in fi eld-oriented control of induction motors. The proposed algorithms are 
validated by both simulation and experiment. 
The stator current equations in the orthogonal stator frame ((α, β) coordi-
nates) can be rewritten as follows:

where fα(t) and fβ(t) are continuous functions of the motor states iα, iβ, λα, λβ 
and ωe but not dependent on the control signals Vα and Vβ. 
It is obvious that, if V0 is large enough, V < 0 can be guaranteed, i.e., sliding 
mode will occur in the intersection of the surfaces sα = 0 and sβ = 0. Hence, 
the estimated currents αˆi  and 
βˆi  will converge to the real ones after sliding 
mode occurs.
As next step, the equivalent control of Vα and Vβ will be investigated and 
associated auxiliary state variables are introduced. As we know from the 
previous sections, once sliding mode occurs, the equivalent control compo-
nents, Vα _eq and Vβ _eq can be obtained by setting αs = 0 and βs = 0: 
 
Vα _eq = βηλα + βωeλβ − βLhηiα
 
Vβ _eq = βηλβ − βωeλα − βLhηiβ. 
(10.3.71)
In practice, Vα _eq and Vβ _eq cannot be calculated directly by the above two 
equations because they contain unknown information in the right-hand side. 
In fact, the two discontinuous controls Vα and Vβ have slow and fast com-
ponents, where the slow components are corresponding to Vα _eq and Vβ _eq. 
As usually done in the previous sections, Vα _eq and Vβ _eq can be obtained 
through a low-pass fi lter with discontinuous values Vα and Vβ as the 
inputs, i.e.,

where μ is the time constant of the low-pass fi lters, which should be chosen 
small compared with the slow component of the real values Vα and Vβ but 
large enough to fi lter out the high-frequency components. The output zα and 
zβ of the low-pass fi lters are taken as Vα _eq and Vβ _eq, respectively. Because zα 
and zβ can be obtained directly, from now on we assume that Vα _eq and Vβ _eq 
are available. 
For the notation convenience, let us introduce auxiliary state variables 
Lα = Vα _eq and Lβ = Vβ _eq with unit Volt.H−1 (voltage/inductance). It is reason-
able to assume that ωe = 0 and η = 0 because they vary much slower than the 
electrical variables such as stator currents and rotor fl ux. Hence,

The system is summarized as follows. For the observer (Equation 10.3.76), 
under the adaptation law (Equation 10.3.80), the estimated rotor speed and 
rotor time constant will converge to their real values. 
The proposed observer was verifi ed by simulation and experiment. The 
parameters of the induction motor used for the simulation and the experi-
ment were taken from a real induction motor, which is a Westinghouse 
5 hp, 220 V, Y-connected, four-pole induction machine, as listed in Table 10.4. 
The performance of the observer is verifi ed by using it in an open loop, i.e., in 
the feedback loop, the actual speed from an encoder is used and the observer 
structure works parallel to the overall system without affecting the closed-
loop system. The closed-loop system follows the commanded reference 
trajectories (in the speed control loop, a PI controller is used). The observer 
estimates the speed and the rotor time constant of the motor in parallel to 
the control loop. 
Here only the experimental results are presented. The proposed algorithm 
was tested at the experiment environment in the PEEM Laboratory of The 
Ohio State University. The experimental results for different commanded 
speed trajectories in Figures 10.45 through 10.55 show that the observer 
system works satisfactorily in the experiment. For more details of the pro-
posed observer system in this subsection, readers are referred to the work of 
Derdiyok, Yan, Guven, and Utkin [2001]. 
10.3.6 Direct Torque and Flux Control 
In this section, the motor torque and the amplitude of rotor fl ux will be 
controlled directly by the inverter On-Off gating signals, without explicitly 
involving the stator current control and conventional PWM techniques.

only the switching elements of the inverter (they receive the PWM signals 
in the conventional motor control techniques) can be controlled. Thus the 
control inputs should be formulated in terms of phase voltages as well as of 
gating signals of the inverter. As follows from Equation 10.3.8, the relation

10.3.6.1. Supplement: Cascaded Torque and Flux Control Via Phase Currents
In the method described above, the motor torque and the amplitude of rotor 
fl ux are controlled directly by the inverter gating signals, without explic-
itly involving the stator current control and conventional PWM techniques. 
A conventional approach called “cascade control method” can be used to 
achieve the same goal. In the cascade method, given reference torque and 
reference fl ux, the corresponding phase currents are generated, and the lat-
ter are realized by conventional PWM or by sliding mode current control. 
The concept of cascade control method is sketched here without going into 
the details of the current control.

10.4. Summary
In this chapter, control algorithms for DC motors, permanent-magnet syn-
chronous motors, and induction motors using the sliding mode design 
principle have been presented. Beside the advantages provided by the slid-
ing mode approach in the sense of control techniques, this unifi ed design 
principle also provides a deeper understanding of the functionality and 
mechanism of electric drive systems. For AC motors, the ultimate object of 
fi eld-oriented control is to enable a decoupling between the motor torque 
and the motor fl ux, resulting in a system similar to a separately excited DC

motor. However, the traditional decoupling characteristic is sensitive to 
motor parameter variations. The design goals of sliding mode control are 
also given in the fi eld-oriented coordinates, and the fi eld orientation is real-
ized by the switching surface transformation. Because no exact decoupling 
is required for sliding mode control, the resulting system is insensitive to 
the motor parameters and the solutions are quite simple. In this sense, slid-
ing mode control may be considered as an extension of the traditional con-
trol techniques such as hysteresis control but with the following advantages: 
achieving fi eld-oriented control performance, providing stability conditions, 
and extension beyond current control to outer-loop control such as speed 
and fl ux control. 
Another impressive feature of sliding mode techniques is the combina-
tion with asymptotic observers and even the observer design itself. In these 
applications, the concept of equivalent control plays a key role. This concept 
originated from the observation of physical systems, providing an additional 
source of information to the control design and thus reducing the complexity 
of the overall system. Based on the concept of equivalent control, numerous 
estimation algorithms, i.e., observer designs, were presented in this chapter. 
Because the mathematical model of an electric motor matches the real motor 
quite well, the presented estimation algorithms open a wide range of practi-
cal applications.

Power Converters
This chapter presents a sliding mode approach for the design of 
control systems for power converters. A cascaded control structure 
is chosen for ease of control realization and to exploit the motion 
separation property of power converters. For power converters, 
the fast motion is dominated by the dynamics of the loop current, 
whereas the slow motion stems from the dynamics of the output 
voltage. Because power converters inherently include switching 
devices, it is straightforward to implement sliding mode control 
design, yielding a discontinuous control law. Detailed control 
design and numeric simulations will demonstrate the effi ciency 
of sliding mode control design principle in this fi eld as a powerful 
alternative to the existing PWM techniques. 
11.1. DC/DC Converters
For circuits controlled by switching devices, in which the control variable 
can take only values from a discrete set, it is natural to consider sliding 
mode strategies to synthesize the switching policy, from both a techno-
logical and a theoretical point of view. In the past, the method of state-
space averaging has been widely used to analyze DC/DC converters. In 
the state-space averaging method, the linear circuit models and the state-
space equation are identifi ed for each of the possible switch positions of 
the converter during the switching period. These state-space equations 
are then averaged over the switching period, leading to a low-frequency 
equivalent model of the converter. The low-frequency model thus obtained 
may be linearized to apply linear control theory to design feedback com-
pensators. In essence, state-space averaging provides a method of low-
frequency characterization of converters such that frequency domain 
design approaches may be applied. Sliding mode control theory belongs 
to the category of time domain techniques and can be used to characterize 
the system under both small signal and large signal conditions. Sliding 
mode control uses state feedback and sets up directly the desired closed-
loop response in time domain or in terms of differential equations. The 
most important feature of the sliding mode approach is the low sensitivity 
to system parameter variations.

11.1.1. Bilinear Systems 
Commonly used DC/DC converters can be classifi ed into “buck,” “boost,” 
“buck-boost,” and “cuk” converters. Some of these DC/DC converters can be 
summarized with a unifi ed state-space formulation in the form of a bilinear 
system defi ned on ℜ n:

(11.1.1)
where x ∈ ℜ n is the state vector; A ∈ ℜ n×n and  B ∈ ℜ n×n are matrices with 
constant real entries, and u is a scalar control taking values from the discrete 
set U =:{0, 1}. For system Equation 11.1.1, we may design a discontinuous con-
trol as

with vector c = [∂s/∂x] and c ∈ Rn  denoting the gradient of the scalar func-
tion s with respect to state space vector x. The motion projection of system

Note that condition ss < 0 defi nes an attraction domain of the sliding mani-
fold. It is the task of the control designer to ensure that this condition is 
always fulfi lled in both transient behavior and steady state. This may also 
involve careful choices of initial conditions, as will become clearer during 
the study of different types of power converters.
In the remainder of this chapter, the control problems of buck and boost 
converters are investigated. The design approaches can be naturally extended 
to the buck-boost and cuk converters.
Boost converters are used for applications in which the required output 
voltage is higher than the source voltage. Conversely, buck converters are

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
used for applications with the output voltage being smaller than the source 
voltage. From a control design point of view, the boost converters are more 
diffi cult than the buck converters, because the standard design model of 
a boost converter is a nonminimum phase system [Venkataramanan, 
Sabanovic, and Slobodan 1985]. In the following, the control problems 
regarding the output-voltage regulation of both types of DC/DC converters 
will be discussed.
Traditionally, the control problems of the DC/DC converters are solved by 
using PWM techniques. Sira-Ramirez [1988] demonstrated the equivalence 
between sliding mode control and PWM control in the low-frequency range 
for a boost converter. Generally speaking, hardware implementation of a slid-
ing mode control is much easier than a PWM control. Because the maximum 
frequency of commercially available switching elements increases higher 
and higher, the sliding mode approach is expected to become increasingly 
popular in the fi eld of power converter control.
11.1.2. Direct Sliding Mode Control
For DC/DC converters, the input inductor (the word “inductor” is often used 
in the literature for DC/DC converters instead of “inductance”) current and 
the output capacitor voltage are normally selected as the state variables. For 
most converters used in practice, the motion rate of the current is much faster 
than the motion rate of the output voltage. Calling on the theory of singular 
perturbations [Kokotovic, O’Malley, and Sannuti 1976], the control problem 
can be solved by using a cascaded control structure with two control loops: 
an inner current control loop and an outer voltage control loop. The latter is 
usually realized with standard linear control techniques, whereas the cur-
rent control is implemented using either PWM or hysteresis control. Here,

we use the sliding mode approach for the control of inductor current. Figure 
11.1 shows the general structure of control system for DC/DC converters.
11.1.2.1. Buck-Type DC/DC Converter
The circuit structure of a buck DC/DC converter is shown in Figure 11.2, 
where the variables are defi ned as follows: L, loop inductor; C, storage capaci-
tor; R, load resistance; E, source voltage; I, input current; V, output voltage; 
and u, switching signal taking value from discrete set U =:{0,1}.

The control design follows a two-step procedure known as integrator back-
stepping [Krstic, Kanellakopoulos, and Kokotovic 1995] or regular form con-
trol (see Section 3.3). First, it is assumed that x1 in the second equation of 
Equation 11.1.12 can be handled as a control input. However, because x1 is the 
output of the current loop in the fi rst equation of Equation 11.1.12, this fi rst

to yield the desired current:

(11.1.14)
The task of the second design step is to ensure that the actual current x1 
tracks the desired current (Equation 11.1.14) exactly. Because of its exact 
tracking properties, the sliding mode approach is an ideal tool for this task. 
If sliding mode is enforced in

then x1 = Vd/R. To enforce sliding mode in the manifold s = 0 in Equation 
11.1.15, control u (taking only two values, 0 or 1) in the fi rst equation of 
Equation 11.1.12 is defi ned as

The condition for sliding mode to exist is derived from ss < 0. In compliance 
with the derivations in Section 11.1.1, sliding mode exists if 
 
0 < x2 < E. 
(11.1.17)
This condition defi nes an attraction domain of the sliding manifold. Because 
the control (Equation 11.1.16) contains no control gain to be adjusted, the 
domain of attraction (Equation 11.1.17) is predetermined by the system archi-
tecture. In steady state, Equation 11.1.17 is fulfi lled by the defi nition of a buck 
converter: the output voltage is smaller than the source voltage.

Figure 11.5 shows the principle of a boost type converter, in which the vari-
ables are defi ned as follows: L, loop inductor; C, storage capacitor; R, load 
resistance; E, source voltage; I, input current; V, output voltage; and u, switch-
ing signal taking value from discrete set U =:{0, 1}.

The topological modifi cation of locating the inductor before the switching 
element rather than after it, as in the buck converter, enables a higher out-
put voltage than the source voltage. However, from a control point of view, 
the boost converter is more diffi cult to control than the buck converter. This 
lies in the fact that the control u appears in both the current and voltage

 equations and both in bilinear fashion. Such a confi guration implies a highly 
nonlinear system with associated diffi culties in control design.
Just like buck converters, boost converters satisfy the motion-separation 
principle, which originates from the singular perturbation theory. In engi-
neering words, the motion rate of the current is much faster than the motion 
rate of the output voltage. Consequently, the control problem can again be 
solved by using two cascaded control loops: an inner current loop and an 
outer voltage control loop. Again, a design of the current control loop based 
on sliding mode control techniques is presented.
Similar to the control design for the buck converter in the previous section, 
a desired current is obtained from the outer voltage loop as

where th stands for the reaching instant of the sliding manifold s = 0, and x2(th) 
is the output voltage at time th. Apparently, x2 tends to Vd asymptotically as t 
goes to infi nity.
The attraction domain of the sliding manifold s = 0 is found by applying 
the convergence condition ss < 0 to the system Equation 11.1.20, yielding

Condition Equation 11.1.27 implies that, as long as the output voltage is higher 
than the source voltage, sliding mode can be enforced. This requirement is 
essential for a boost-type DC/DC converter, and careful consideration of the 
initial conditions is required to guarantee the convergence to s = 0.
Figures 11.6 and 11.7 show the simulation results of proposed control algorithm 
for the boost DC/DC converter. In the simulation, the converter parameters are 
selected as E = 20 V, C = 4 μF, R = 40 Ω, and L = 40 mH. The desired output volt-
age is Vd = 40 V. As can be seen from the fi gures, both the inductor current and 
the output capacitor voltage converge rapidly to their reference values.
11.1.3. Observer-Based Control
Recently, research on sliding mode control theory has revealed great advan-
tages by introducing certain dynamics into a sliding mode controller (see

Chapter 6 through Chapter 8). These approaches fall into the category of 
dynamic feedback control. For observer-based sliding mode control, an ideal 
model is simulated in the controller in parallel to the real plant. For the slid-
ing mode control itself, measurements of real plant states are substituted by 
observer states, reducing the number of plant states to be measured. The mis-
match between some measurable plant output(s) and the observer output(s) 
is the “bridge” to keep both systems operating “closely.” This mismatch has 
been used in different ways to improve the control performance. In general, 
an observer can be viewed as an artifi cially introduced auxiliary dynamic 
system to improve the control performance.
As seen from the previous derivations, for DC/DC converters, there is no 
control gain to be adjusted. The attraction domain of the sliding manifold 
s = 0 is bounded. The remaining degrees of freedom for the control design 
are the initial conditions of the auxiliary system. It has been shown that, by 
proper selection of the initial conditions of the auxiliary system, the per-
formance of an observer-based sliding mode controller may be improved 
signifi cantly [Sira-Ramirez, Escobar, and Ortega 1996].
It is worth pointing out the evolution process of sliding mode control the-
ory. Originally, sliding mode control theory, as a general control design meth-
odology for a large class of nonlinear systems, fell into the fi eld of nonlinear 
control with order reduction and decoupling capabilities. The order reduction

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
and decoupling issues were some of the most diffi cult problems in the control 
of high-order nonlinear dynamic systems. Applications of sliding mode tech-
niques in the fi elds of robotics and electric drives have confi rmed the validity 
of this compact, uniform, and straightforward design methodology. In recent 
years, researchers have started to incorporate the dynamic feedback into the 
sliding mode controller to achieve higher control performance. Dynamic 
feedback increases the system order in the controller space and establishes 
coupling between the plant system space and the controller space. As a result, 
the complexity of the overall system will be increased in return.
Similar to the direct sliding mode control of DC/DC converters, the fol-
lowing sections investigate inductor current control and subsequently out-
put capacitor voltage regulation based on observed states. Figure 11.8 shows 
the structure of the observer-based control system for DC/DC converters.
The price for observer-based control strategy is a more involved control 
design and an increasingly complex stability analysis. A general design 
strategy proceeds as follows:
 
 1.  The observer dynamics are derived with a similar structure as the 
plant model.
 
2.  The stability of the observer system is examined to ensure that the 
observer states converge to the states of the real system (asymp-
totic stability). 
 
3.  A sliding mode current controller is designed based on the 
observed current rather than the measured current. Supposing 
sliding mode exists, observed current tracks the desired reference 
current and associated equivalent control can be obtained.
 
4.  As motion in sliding mode, a reduced-order system consisting of 
the real plant model and the output voltage equation of the observer 
system can be derived by substitution of the equivalent control.
 
5.  It is proven that, under the equivalent control, the reduced order-
system provides (a) the real current convergence to the desired

6.  The observed output voltage converges to the desired output volt-
age, and so does the real output voltage.
 
7.  The existence of sliding mode is established by proper selection of 
the initial conditions of the observer dynamics.

asymptotically.

as the observer error system Equation 11.1.29, which is proven to be stable, 
implying that the real current converges to the desired reference current 
asymptotically. 
So far, we have proven that, after sliding mode occurs, i.e., for t ≥ th, observed 
current is equal to the desired reference current, and the real current will 
also tend to the desired reference current. It means that

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
As an important specifi cation of DC/DC converters, the so-called “stored

where H(t) represents the energy difference between the desired value and 
the real value providing to the load. For a well-controlled DC/DC converter, 
this energy difference should converge to zero smoothly.
Figures 11.9 through 11.11 show the simulation results of the observer-
based control algorithm for the buck DC/DC converter. In the simulation, 
the converter parameters are selected as E = 20 V, C = 4 μF, R = 40 Ω, and 
L = 40 mH. The desired output voltage is Vd = 7 V. The observer gain is 
designed as l = 200. The initial conditions of the observer are selected as

therefore, system Equation 11.1.44 is stable for any l > 0. As a result, observer 
errors x1 and x2 tend to zero asymptotically. The convergence rate for the

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Figures 11.12 through 11.14 show the simulation results of the observer-
based control algorithm for the boost DC/DC converter. In the simula-
tion, the converter parameters are selected as E = 20 V, C = 4 μF, R = 40 Ω, 
and L = 40 mH. The desired output voltage is Vd = 40 V. The observer gain 
is designed as l = 200. The initial conditions of the observer are selected 
as ˆ

 respectively. 
As can be seen from the fi gures, both the inductor current and the out-
put capacitor voltage converge rapidly to their reference values, and the 
system response can be infl uenced by selection of the observer initial 
conditions.
For zero initial conditions, i.e.,

 the observer-based 
control system converges to the non-observer-based control system. In this 
case, the stored error energy is not smooth (see Figure 11.14); the time deriv-
ative of H(t) has discontinuous points. However, if the initial conditions of 
the observer are designed properly, the stored error energy decreases to 
zero smoothly, as illustrated by Figure 11.14. This important improvement 
to the boost DC/DC converter is produced by the observer-based control 
design.

11.1.4. Multiphase Converters 
The design methodology developed in Section 8.8 is applied for a DC/DC 
multiphase buck converter. A converter with two phases is depicted in 
Figure 11.15. The objective is to demonstrate via simulation to what extent 
chattering can be suppressed in multiphase power converters using the 
proposed phase shift control methodology and to check the range of the 
function a for which the chattering suppression takes place. In simulation, 
the master-slave method is accepted. The gain K is selected as in Equation 
8.8.15 as K = 1/α to maintain the switching frequency at the desired level 
in all phases even if a is beyond the admissible domain (Equation 8.8.14). 
Simulation results are presented for the two parameter sets in Table 11.1.
For simulation, the governing equations of m-phase converter are assumed 
as follows:

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Because a can be out of the admissible range during transients, chattering 
appears at the beginning of the process. Note that, in the simulation, con-
trol (Equation 11.1.67) is without the modifi cation given in Equation 8.8.15. 
Again, chattering suppression is observed, and the switching frequency is 
maintained at the same level.
The design methodology is developed under the assumption that state 
variables are constant within one period of oscillation. Additional simula-
tion is performed for time-varying reference input with control (Equation 
11.1.67) and modifi cation (Equation 8.8.17). Simulation results in Figure 11.21 
demonstrate effi cient chattering suppression for both transient time inter-
vals and steady-state modes. 
Next, a set of simulation results for a six-phase converter with control law 
Equation 11.1.67 (m = 6) are shown. In Figures 11.22 through 11.24, it can 
be seen that the admissible range of reference input is wider for six-phase

converter compared with the four-phase converter (Vref,min is equal to 1.714 
and 2.4 V, respectively). The chattering suppression effect demonstrated for 
four-phase converter with time-varying Vref can be observed for six-phase 
converter as well (see Figure 11.24). For both cases, the modifi ed control 
Equation 8.8.17 instead of Equations 8.8.12 or 8.8.19 decreases chattering con-
siderably in transient intervals. 
For the real-life four-phase DC/DC power converters with parameters 
from Set II in Table 11.1, simulations are performed for different reference 
inputs. The effect of chattering suppression for reference inputs 3, 6, and 8 V 
is demonstrated in Figures 11.25 through 11.27. Note that the inductance is 
relatively small to have fast converter dynamics. This leads to a high level 
of chattering in each phase, but it is practically suppressed in the output 
signal.
Finally, it is demonstrated that chattering can be reduced considerably 
following the “master-slave method” even if for a given number of phases 
m, parameter a is beyond the admissible domain (Equation 8.8.14) and 
the desired phase shift cannot be guaranteed by varying the width of the 
 hysteresis loop. For the master-slave implementation, each phase can be 
complimented by several sequentially connected slaves, as illustrated in

is obtained.
A simulation is performed for a 4-phase power converter. As can be seen 
in Figure 11.29, the performance is not acceptable for a 4-phase converter 
with only one slave in each phase, such that a
M > 0.5 and condition Equation 
8.8.14 does not hold. Of course, chattering can be suppressed by increasing 
the number of phases preserving the “one slave in one phase” approach, as 
shown in Figure 11.30 for an eight-phase converter. Simulation results for a 
four-phase power converter with application of the proposed methodology 
are shown in Figure 11.31.

Comparing the results shown in Figure 11.31 with those in Figure 11.30, 
it is observed that the effect of chattering reduction is improved signifi -
cantly by the suggested method, although the ripple magnitude is higher 
than that of the eight-phase converter model in Figure 11.30. This effect can 
be explained easily: the relative weight of higher harmonics is increasing 
with decreasing duty cycle (it is equal to 1/8 for Vref = 1.5V); the fi rst three

11.2. Boost-Type AC/DC Converters
Nowadays, semiconductors using high-frequency switching devices such as 
MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor fi eld effect transistor), IGBT, and MCT 
(metal oxide semiconductor-controlled thyristor) are commonly used for 
drive systems. One of the main control techniques used is voltage modula-
tion. The behavior of phase currents and output voltage as well as switching 
losses and dynamic responses not only depend on the choice of power semi-
conductor used but also on the choice of pulse-width modulation (PWM). 
This explains why PWM techniques have been the subject of intensive

research during the past few decades. A large variety of methods, different 
in concept and performance, have been developed. 
These modulation approaches can be classifi ed into two categories depend-
ing on the control techniques used: feedforward pulse width modulation 
based on the so called space-vector method and feedback modulation based 
on sliding mode or bang-bang control methods. The feedforward PWM 
technique is characterized by formation of the output voltage via an open-
loop control structure. In this case, the drive system does not exhibit high 
dynamic performance, and the effect of disturbances, which exist always in 
a drive system, are not automatically reduced. On the other hand, it is very 
simple to realize a minimum loss PWM strategy. The feedback modulation 
approach allows an online realization of the switching pattern. This con-
trol technique ensures that the frequency and the pulse width are generated 
automatically together in solving the control task. Feedback control systems 
possess good dynamic performance because they use all available control

resources to reduce the error. The infl uence of disturbances to the system 
is thus minimized. Many researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
sliding mode control scheme [see Sabanovic, Sabanovic, and Ohnishi 1993; 
Vilathgamuwa, Wall, and Jackson 1996].
Compared to conventional PWM techniques, the sliding mode approach 
has no fi xed switching frequency, resulting in a wider spectrum of acoustic 
noise. Sliding mode control under constant switching frequencies and with 
minimized switching losses for three-phase converters has also been devel-
oped [Sergy and Izosimov 1997].

Power Converters 
355
Three distinguished characteristics may be used to classify multiple-phase 
converters. First, there are two types of tasks for multiple-phase converters: 
“rectifi cation” and “inversion.” Rectifi cation transforms AC power into DC 
power, whereas inversion transforms DC power into AC power. Second, the 
power supply on the DC side may be in the form of either a voltage source or 
a current source. Third, similar to DC/DC converters, multiple-phase con-
verters can also be classifi ed into buck type and boost type depending on 
the circuit topology. As a result, there are eight possible combinations to 
form different types of multiple phase power converters as illustrated in 
Table 11.2.
An exhaustive study of all these types of converters goes beyond the scope 
of this text. In this section, we give an example of sliding mode control for 
a three-phase boost AC/DC converter, a typical converter used in industrial 
applications.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
11.2.1. Model of the Boost-Type AC/DC Converter 
Figure 11.32 shows the structure of a boost-type AC/DC converter, in which 
the variables are defi ned as follows: L, phase inductance; Rw, phase resis-
tance; C, storage capacitor; i1, i2, i3, phase currents; ilink, link current;  i1, load 
current; ug1, ug2, ug3, source voltages and u0, output voltage.
For sliding mode control design, symmetric control inputs from discrete 
set {−1, 1} are more convenient than the on-off signals from discrete set {0, 1}.
Let the six on-off signals of an AC/DC converter be denoted by 
 
sw = [sw1 sw2 sw3 sw4 sw5 sw6]T. 
(11.2.1)
 The control inputs, as they appear in the converter model, are defi ned as 
Ugate = [u1 u2 u3]T. Note that Ugate does not represent some control voltages

11.2.1.2. Model in (d, q) Coordinate Frame 
As shown in Chapter 10, the control design of an AC motor is often performed 
in a fi eld-oriented coordinate system, usually called (d, q) coordinates. For the 
control of an AC  synchronous motor, the fi eld-oriented coordinate system is 
simply the rotor coordinates. Similarly, for the control of three-phase AC/DC 
converters, it is convenient to design the control in the rotating reference frame 
synchronized with the supply frequency, i.e., the (d, q) coordinate system. In this 
case, all state  variables should be transformed into the (d, q) coordinate system 
using the following relations:

where ω(t) is the supply frequency; (x1, x2, x3) denote the state variables in 
phase coordinates, e.g., the phase currents (i1, i2, i3), the source voltages (ug1, 
ug2, ug3), and the switching controls (u1, u2, u3); (xα, xβ) represent the state 
variables, i.e., (iα, iβ), (ugα, ugβ), and (uα, uβ) in a fi xed orthogonal coordinate 
system with the α-axis aligned with the axis of phase 1; and (xd, xq) are 
the state variables, i.e., (id, iq), (ugd, ugq), and (ud, uq), in the (d, q) coordinate

Remark 11.1 
Here ud, uq are the transformed switching controls u1, u2, u3 rather than trans-
formed phase voltages as in the case of AC motors.

Sinusoidal input currents 
Regenerative capability
Ripple free output voltage
From an electromagnetic interference point of view, fi xed switching fre-
quency is also an important characteristic that is inherently induced in a 
PWM-controlled converter. For a sliding mode-controlled converter, how-
ever, fi xed switching frequency cannot be guaranteed because the switching 
action occurs according to the value of a sliding function and is not synchro-
nized with a frequency source. In fact, varying switching frequencies are a 
distinct feature of sliding mode control systems.
In industrial power converter systems, one of the major design challenges 
is an unknown varying load that requires suffi cient control robustness. 
Moreover, not all state variables that are necessary for the control purpose 
are measured or are measurable. As a result, a control engineer has to face the 
problem of designing a robust control system with observed state variables 
as well as achieving a high performance of the closed-loop system.
Control design of power converters is usually performed in two steps: cur-
rent control in an inner loop and voltage control in an outer loop. In the 
frame of this cascaded control structure, sliding mode method is usually 
applied to the current control, whereas the outer-loop control, i.e., the output 
voltage regulation, is designed using linear control techniques. This holds 
for both DC/DC converters and AC/DC converters (Figure 11.33).
11.2.2.1. Sliding Mode Current Control
Similar to the control design for electric motors, the current control of a boost-
type AC/DC converter can be designed in either phase coordinates or the (d, 
q) coordinate frame. Because the control criteria (as listed in the  performance

 Inequality Equation 11.2.25 defi nes a subspace in the system space in which 
the state trajectories converge to the sliding manifold Sdq = 0 in fi nite time. 
This is to show that the attraction domain of the sliding manifold is bounded 
in the state space. Note that parameter b

L
d

2  should be high enough at 
initial time instant. Because u0d = u0, the output voltage should not be zero at 
the initial time instant. In critical applications, this can be achieved by start-
ing the converter operation with an open-loop control. In fact, as discussed 
in the DC/DC converter part, an observer-based control scheme can also 
be applied here such that sliding mode occurs starting from the initial time

instant. However, the associated convergence proof is rather involved and 
thus goes beyond this text. 
As the last step of the control design, the resulting controls u1, u2, and u3 
should be mapped into the switching patterns applying to the power con-
verter using the following relations:

11.2.2.2. Output Voltage Regulation
In this section, the reference currents feeding to the current controller, id

and iq
*, will be determined to ensure asymptotic stability of the output volt-
age regulation in the outer loop. Neglecting the voltage drop over the phase 
resistance Rw, the system model in the (d, q) reference frame can be simpli-

Normally, the value of the inductance satisfi es L << 1, and the right-hand 
sides of the equations in Equation 11.2.28 have the values of the same order. 
Hence, did/dt, diq/dt >> du0d/dt, implying that the dynamics of id and iq are 
much faster than those of u0d. Provided that the fast dynamics are stable,

the outer-loop control can be simplifi ed considerably. Based on the singular 
perturbation theory, we can formally let the left-hand sides of the second 
and third equations in Equation 11.2.28 be equal to zero and then solve the 
algebraic equations for ud and uq. As a result, the following equation system 
is valid for control design of the slow-manifold:

determined depending on the desired system performance.
The design goals have been given in the performance characteristics at the 
beginning of Section 11.2.2. The demand of sinusoidal input currents has 
been fulfi lled automatically by involving the (d, q) transformation. The fol-
lowing characteristics will cover the major requirements of a well-controlled 
boost AC/DC converter:
 
 1. The output voltage should converge to its reference value u0

2.  The input current phase-angle should trace its reference value

11.2.2.3. Simulation Results
The proposed sliding mode current controller and output voltage regulator 
are validated by the following simulation results. Parameters of the AC/DC 
converter are preset as Rw = 0.45Ω, L = 7.5 mH, C = 820μF, and load resistance 
Rl = 182Ω. The amplitude of the supply voltage is selected as E = 50

/
V. 
The frequency of the supply voltage ω is 377 rad/sec. The simulation results 
are shown in Figures 11.34 through 11.37. 
11.2.3. Observer for Sensorless Control
In the previous section, we developed a cascaded control structure to con-
trol the phase currents, output voltage, power factor, and the input current 
phase angle of boost-type AC/DC converters. Sliding mode current control 
ensures fast convergence of the real currents to their reference counterparts. 
However, this control structure is based on the assumption that the follow-
ing information is available:
Phase currents i1, i2, i3
Source voltages ug1, ug2, ug3

In industrial systems, the source voltages, assumed to have sinusoidal 
form, may come from a synchronous generator; transducers are needed for 
sensing their amplitude and frequency. The same holds for the phase cur-
rents and the load current. To minimize the number of sensors and hence 
the maintenance costs, a link current sensor may be integrated nearby the 
storage capacitor (see Figure 11.32). Based on this link current sensor, all state 
variables needed for the proposed control structure can be estimated using 
a sliding mode observer combined with the design techniques of a conven-
tional observer.
We have made the assumption that the source voltages are of sinusoidal 
form; their frequency, however, may not be constant. This is the case for 
source voltages coming from a synchronous generator that might be started, 
stopped, accelerated, or decelerated. Suppose that the frequency of the source 
voltages changes, approximately, linearly with respect to time, i.e., 
 
ω(t) = αt + β, 
(11.2.35)
where α, β are constant values. The phase of the source voltages is thus 
given by

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
In the following, we propose to design observers for the state variables of 
phase i = 1. The state variables associated with phase i = 2 and i = 3 can be 
obtained in a similar manner. Note that state variable x2 stands for the time 
derivative of x1 = ug1  and should not be mixed with the phase i = 2.
As mentioned before, the link current is assumed to be measurable as a 
function of ii and ui, i = 1, 2, 3,
 
ilink = f(i1, i2, i3, u1, u2, u3)

Therefore, the link current consists of sequential “windows” during which 
the phase currents can be observed sequentially. In other words, the link 
current is equal to one of the phase currents in certain windows, which are 
determined by the combination of the switching signals u1, u2, u3. The lengths 
of the windows depend on the switching policy used.

ug  asymptotically. Hence, the source voltage of 
phase i = 1 can be reconstructed by using the sliding mode observer and 
exploiting the equivalent control method.
11.2.3.2. Observer for Source Voltage
The source voltage x1 = ug1 obtained above is often corrupted by high-
frequency noise because the time constant of the low-pass fi lter is required 
to be small enough. Otherwise, the associated phase lag as well as time delay 
would destroy the information in ug1 equal to the average value of M
i
sign( )
1 . 
In addition, the voltage ug1 is estimated only within the windows when the 
link current is equal to the current of phase i = 1.
11.2.3.3. Known Supply Frequency 
First, let us discuss a simple case to gain some theoretical insight of the EMF 
observer, i.e., the source voltage observer. Assuming that the frequency ω 
and the acceleration α of the EMFs are known and assuming that the link 
current can be measured continuously without the restriction of the watch-
ing windows, design the EMF observer as follows:

11.2.3.4. Unknown Supply Frequency 
In real applications, the supply frequency as well as the acceleration sig-
nals may not be measured. To meet this requirement, we need to addition-
ally estimate ω and α. The convergence proof of this kind of observer will 
become involved. However, simulations and experimental results showed 
that the observer converges.

Readers who are interested in the convergence proof under certain assump-
tions should consult previous works [Utkin and Drakunov 1995; Chen 1998].
The state variables associated with phase i = 2 and phase i = 3 can be 
obtained in a similar manner. Several factors will deteriorate the perfor-
mance of the proposed observers:
 
1. There exist parameter uncertainties, e.g., in parameter Rw or L.
 
2. The sampling rate of a digital implementation is too low; in this case, 
we need a discrete-time version of the observer design [Utkin, Chen, 
Zarei, and Miller 1997].
 
3. The time constant of the low-pass fi lter μ (see Equation 11.2.44) is 
selected inappropriately.
11.2.3.5. Simulation Results
The proposed sliding mode observer for the case of varying, and unknown, 
supply frequency is validated by the following simulation results. Parameters 
of the AC/DC converter are preset as Rw = 0.033Ω, L = 1.55 × 10−4H, C = 40F, and 
load resistance Rl = 0.12Ω. The amplitude of the supply voltage is selected as 
E = 10. The frequency of the supply voltage ω is assumed to vary in the range 
of 150–250 Hz, and the rate of frequency change, i.e., the acceleration α, may 
change within a range of ±1000 Hz/sec. Results of the estimated signals are 
shown in Figures 11.38 through 11.41. The desired rate of  convergence can 
be obtained by the choice of observer gains. In the simulations, the observer 
gains are designed as L1 = 4000, L2 = 4,000,000, L3 = 500, and L4 = 20,000.
For all simulations, the information of the phase current is available only 
within the time windows in which link current is equal to the phase current. 
Beyond the windows, the observer operates in the open loop mode.
Section 13.3 will show experimental results for a similar problem for auto-
motive applications, using a different form of back-EMF/frequency observer.
11.3. DC/AC Converter
After the intensive discussion of three-phase AC/DC converters in the pre-
vious section, this section presents sliding mode pulse width modulation 
(SMPWM) control methodologies for a three-phase DC/AC converter, i.e., 
current-controlled inverter. Two novel approaches adopting the sliding 
mode concept are proposed to make the system track the reference inputs.

Phase currents and the neutral point voltage are controlled simultaneously. 
Simulations and experiments are performed to confi rm the effectiveness of 
the proposed  control algorithms. Some considerations concerning the opti-
mization of different operational criteria offered by SMPWM via the control 
of the neutral point voltage are also given. The main contents of this section 
are based on the work of Yan, Utkin, and Xu [2007].
11.3.1. Dynamic Model
Consider the system in Figure 11.42. The three-phase full-bridge inverter 
under control is to provide desired currents to the load, taking into account 
that they can be dependent.

where H1, H3, H5 ∈ {±1} represent the switching control signals for six switch-
ing devices of the three-phase full-bridge converter. If a switching device is 
conducting, a value of 1 is assigned to it; otherwise, −1 is assigned. vn is the 
voltage at neutral point n. ea, eb, ec are voltages, for example, three back EMF 
in AC motors. It is assumed that ea + eb +ec = 0. Because the sum of the phase 
currents is equal to zero as well, vn of the three-phase system can be found

The objective of control algorithm is to track proper selected current refer-
ences. Some existing PWM techniques use three-phase current errors as 
inputs to its controller, for example, hysteresis band PWM. Denote

Note that matrix B1 is singular because of ia + ib+ ic =0, hence only two phase 
currents of ia, ib, ic can be controlled independently. As a result, although the 
three currents are equal to the desired values, the motion of system is not 
unique. For example, the voltage vn in Equation 11.3.2 can be equal to dif-
ferent values. In fact, we have three control inputs H1, H3, H5 but only two 
independent controlled variables. Thus we have one superfl uous degree 
of freedom to do some additional task, e.g., to minimize the number of 
inverter switching, as shown later. In the following, we assume that refer-
ence inputs ia

∗ are given and discuss how to use the additional degree 
of freedom.

Three-dimensional discontinuous control H can be designed such that slid-
ing mode is enforced on s = 0, implying that all three components of s are 
equal to zero and the tracking problem is solved. Because the system perfor-
mance in sliding mode depends on vn
∗, it can be selected in correspondence 
with some performance criterion. 
Two control methods that can be used to enforce sliding mode will 
be shown here. The first one is to design a Lyapunov function. The sec-
ond one is to decouple the three dynamic equations in Equation 11.3.10 
with respect to three controls by coordinate transformation. In the 
later approach, the frequency analysis can be performed for each phase 
independently. 
11.3.2.1. Lyapunov Approach
Having proposed the sliding surface s, the control algorithm should be 
designed such that vector s goes to zero after fi nite time. Defi ne the Lyapunov

If Udc is large enough, fV can be suppressed, and V < 0 can be guaranteed, 
then the sliding manifold is reached after fi nite time. SMPWM with the 
Lyapunov approach takes into account all sliding surfaces directly for each 
phase’s control. Although the convergence of system states to corresponding 
sliding surfaces requires the DC-bus voltage to be high enough, SMPWM 
does not require the Udc to be constant. Note that, in the calculation of vn, the 
value of Udc is required (see Equation 11.3.2).
11.3.2.2. Decoupling Approach
The Lyapunov approach is rather simple, but it does not let us analyze the 
motion in the vicinity of the sliding manifold, because three equations in 
Equation 11.3.10 are interconnected. The decoupling approach is a little bit 
more complex than the Lyapunov approach, but it provides some benefi ts. In 
this approach, three transformed sliding surfaces are introduced, and each 
switching control will correspond only to one sliding surface, i.e., the system 
is decoupled. Equation 11.3.10 can be written in matrix form:

11.3.2.3. Possible Applications of vn Control
Reference input vn
∗ may be selected depending on some operation criteria: 
control of switching frequency, minimization of this frequency with given 
accuracy, and so on. 
As follows from Equation 11.3.10, the time derivative of s3 depends on vn 
varying at high frequency in sliding mode. Because of the integration in s3, 
the high frequency will be rejected on the sliding surface and s3 will depend 
on average value of vn. 
As mentioned previously, the reference currents are tracked. At the same 
time, the average value of vn can be controlled using SMPWM. To take advan-
tage of this extra degree of freedom, proper vn
∗ can be found to optimize some 
performance criterion. For example, the switching frequency (i.e., the num-
ber of switching) can be minimized to reduce switching losses. 
Ideally, sliding mode is a mathematical abstraction in which the sliding 
motion trajectories are strictly on sliding surfaces. However, sliding mode 
in a real-life system occurs not strictly on the sliding surfaces. Instead, it 
occurs within some boundary layer. Assuming that switching devices have 
hysteresis loop Δ, then Δ defi nes the accuracy of the system, as shown in 
Figure 11.43. In the control system, the switching frequency depends on state 
velocities; it is not a constant value (unlike the case of conventional PWM, in

which the switching frequency is fi xed). We consider the system using the 
decoupling approach, in which each surface si
*, i ∈ {1, 2, 3} can be handled 
independently by the corresponding control H2i−1. The switching frequency 
of one transformed sliding surface is determined by two time intervals with 
si
* > 0 and si
* < 0. 
Consider the switching behavior of the ith motion in Equation 11.3.21 
where i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. The function f* in Equation 11.3.21 depends on vn
∗, as shown 
in Equation 11.3.22. For each motion in Equation 11.3.21, the time duration of 
“switch on,” i.e., Hi = 1, and the time duration of “switch off,” i.e., Hi = −1, can 
be written as functions of vn

11.3.2.4. Simulation Results
To evaluate the proposed control algorithm, computer simulations have been 
conducted. Parameters used in simulation are listed in Table 11.3. The simu-
lation used the sliding surface decoupling approach. Results of three-phase 
current tracking (zoomed in) are shown in Figure 11.44. After a brief tran-
sient stage, phase currents track the references very well. In Figure 11.45, the 
average value of vn tracks a time-varying reference. This average value is 
obtained by a fi rst-order low-pass fi lter, μ x

 and μ = 0.001. The fi lter 
is used only to calculate the average value of vn to illustrate how close is this 
value to vn

the simulation, the reference vn
∗ is a randomly selected time-varying  function.

It is not optimized according to some criterion. The only objective of Figure 
11.45 is to show the ability to track a time-varying v t
n
∗( ).
A point worth noting is that SMPWM has an advantage over conventional 
PWM techniques, e.g., the space vector PWM (SVPWM), because SMPWM does 
not require the control device to have a timing functionality, because it controls 
directly the gating signals of the inverter depending on the tracking errors. 
11.3.2.5. Experimental Results
The purpose of the experiment is to confi rm the effectiveness of SMPWM in 
a real-time environment under the infl uence of disturbances and nonideal 
circuit components. The control objective is to track a reference voltage at the 
neutral point of a three-phase load; at the same time, reference currents at 
the output of the three-phase full-bridge inverter are also tracked. 
A block diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 11.46. The 
switches of the inverter are 1200 V/100 A IGBT (2MBI100NC-12). Parameters 
of the system are shown in Table 11.4. 
Results of the experiment are shown in Figures 11.47 through 11.53. Figure 
11.47 shows the result of current tracking of one phase of the converter. 
The frequency content of this switching signal (shown in Figure 11.48) has 
two peaks in frequency domain: one at 60 Hz (fundamental frequency) 
and one at 10 kHz. Different from the space vector PWM, the switching 
action of the SMPWM is not fi xed by a PWM frequency. The time-varying 
switching of SMPWM can be seen from Figures 11.49 and 11.50. The 10 
kHz component can be measured in the time domain of the fast switching 
intervals in the waveforms shown in Figure 11.50. In Figure 11.51, the fi rst 
waveform shows the current tracking, and the second waveform shows the 
tracking of a time-varying voltage reference v t
n
∗( ) at the neutral point of the 
Y-connected load. In this experiment, the v t
n
∗( ) is selected as a sinusoidal 
signal. In real applications, this reference can be selected according to 
 different criteria. This experiment only demonstrates SMPWM’s ability to

phase current) and SMPWM’s control signal. Figure 11.53 shows the output 
voltage (one of the phase voltage) of the converter and the load current. 
For comparison, the SVPWM is also implemented to track the same current 
references without changing the hardware setup. Only the software generat-
ing PWM switching signal was changed. The load current and the SVPWM 
switching signal of one phase are shown in Figure 11.54. Compare the fi rst 
waveform of Figure 11.54 with that of Figure 11.52; the ripples of sinusoidal 
load currents are approximately at the same level. Figure 11.55 shows the 
zoomed switching action of SVPWM in fi gure 11.54. 
The spectrum of the SVPWM switching signal is shown in Figure 11.56. 
The SVPWM switching is concentrated at 20 kHz, which is determined by

ing can be measured directly in the time domain, as shown in Figure 11.55. 
Compared with the 10 kHz switching of using SMPWM (shown in Figure 
11.48), it can be observed that SMPWM can use a much slower switching 
signal to track the same reference current with the same accuracy. In this

sinusoidal currents at the load. The experimental results verifi ed the effec-
tiveness of the SMPWM approach.
11.4. Summary
Sliding mode approaches to switching power converters were discussed in 
this chapter. The proper selection of the switching manifolds and a cascaded 
control structure was shown to have interesting features: 
 
 1.  Sliding motion is performed in the inner current loop. The struc-
ture of this loop is similar for all types of power converters. 
 
2.  Because switching is the only way for controlling power convert-
ers, the sliding mode approach does not introduce any additional 
complexity or chattering.

3.  In all systems, the reference currents are calculated to be 
continuous variables. There are a few application-dependent 
parameters such that the controller can easily be realized in 
industrial systems. 
 
4.  The solutions for all types of converters are global, implying that 
no linearization procedure is necessary.
As a very important aspect of this chapter, observer-based control 
approaches have been presented, either asymptotic observers or sliding 
mode observers. It was shown that an observer-based control system may 
achieve a higher control performance than a non-observer-based control 
system. To reduce the number of sensors, sliding mode observers play an 
important role in the control design. The information is extracted through 
the concept of equivalent control; thus, no high-order time derivatives of the 
internal state are necessary. Simulation and experimental results confi rmed 
the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches.

Advanced Robotics
The control of robots, mobile robots, and manipulator arms alike, 
has fascinated control engineers for several decades. Robots are 
complex mechanical systems with highly nonlinear dynamics. 
Hence, high-performance operation requires nonlinear control 
designs to fully exploit a robot’s capabilities.
After describing the dynamic models for robots, this chapter 
fi rst discusses four basic sliding mode control design alternatives 
for the classic trajectory tracking problem, in which the robot is 
asked to follow a prescribed trajectory. Next, advanced robot con-
trol is studied using the example of gradient tracking control, in 
which the robot motion is guided online by the gradient of an 
artifi cial potential fi eld to avoid collisions with obstacles in its 
workspace. The chapter concludes with four practical examples 
of sliding mode control in advanced robotics.
12.1. Dynamic Modeling
A large number of control problems for mechanical systems are based on 
controlling the position or location of a mass using a force or a torque as the 
input variable. Instead of the pure regulation problem of driving the output 
location to a specifi ed value, the position of the mass often is required to 
follow a prescribed trajectory. Levels of complexity may be added by intro-
ducing sets of masses with coupled dynamics, to be controlled by sets of 
force/torque inputs. The standard “fully actuated” case then features one 
control force/torque input associated with each primary mass and additional 
forces/torques arising from static and dynamic coupling between the differ-
ent masses. A typical example is a robotic arm or robot manipulator with n 
links connected by n joints with force/torque-generating actuators. Usually, 
an end-effector tool is mounted at the tip of the last link for manipulating 
objects according to the specifi c robot application. The case of less control 
inputs than primary masses is called underactuation and requires extra con-
sideration. Examples were given in Chapter 4.
The input force(s)/torque(s) are the output(s) of, often electrical, actuators 
with their own complex dynamics. These actuator dynamics are usually 
neglected in the fi rst step of control design for the electromechanical sys-
tem, assuming that they are stable and considerably faster than the inertial

dynamics of the mass(es). Because of the large variety of actuators, we refer 
for the treatment of actuator control to Chapter 10. Also, other dynamics such 
as structural fl exibilities are often neglected when deriving a basic model 
for the mechanical system. In practice, this leads to the chattering problem 
described in Chapter 8, and one of the solutions discussed there should be 
used on top of the basic control designs outlined in this chapter.
Before designing control strategies for a mechanical system, a dynamic 
model describing the principle physical behavior should be derived. In 
this section, we consider holonomic mechanical systems in unconstrained 
motion and planar mobile robots with nonholonomic motion constraints. 
Several methods have been developed to obtain a dynamic model based on 
the physical properties of the system. A popular methodology is the Euler-
Lagrange formulation for an energy-conserving system:

where q ∈ ℜn×1 is a vector of generalized confi guration coordinates, τ ∈ ℜn×1 
is a vector of generalized external (input) forces/torques (excluding gravity), 
and the Lagrangian L = K − P is the difference between the total kinetic (K) 
and potential (P) energies of the system. For details and alternative formula-
tions, please refer to textbooks on the dynamics of mechanical systems; for 
robotic systems, see Craig [1986] and Spong and Vidyasagar [1989].

Traditionally, robots have been categorized into “robot manipulators” and 
“mobile robots.” Robot manipulators usually have a fi xed base and consist 
of a number of rigid links, connected by translational or rotational joints. A 
set of q ∈ ℜn×1 confi guration variables of the n joints prescribes a robot con-
fi guration, also called robot posture. The set of all possible confi gurations

within the physical joint limitations defi nes the robot confi guration space. 
The robot “kinematics” provide a mapping between joint coordinates and 
world  coordinates. The associated locations of a given point of the manipu-
lator, e.g., the tip of its end-effector in a world coordinate system, defi ne the 
robot workspace. Note that multiple confi gurations may result in similar 
end- effector positions. Because consequently, the inverse kinematic mapping 
between end-effector location in world coordinates and the confi guration 
vector q ∈ ℜn×1 is not unique, we omit here the treatment of “inverse kine-
matics” and concentrate on control design in confi guration space. Again, the 
interested reader is referred to textbooks on robotics for a detailed treatment 
of robot kinematics and inverse kinematic mappings.
Most manipulator arms have serial links, but there are also designs with 
parallel linkages. Conversely, mobile robots possess wheels or other means 
to move about. Their workspace is defi ned by the set of points reachable 
via their means of mobility. Position and possibly orientation variables with 
respect to a workspace-fi xed coordinate system defi ne the confi gurations of a 
mobile robot. Recently, robot manipulators and mobile robots have been com-
bined to form mobile manipulators, for instance, with three degrees of free-
dom for mobility in the plane and six degrees of freedom for manipulation. 
For control design, we distinguish “holonomic” and “nonholonomic” robots. 
The motion of a holonomic robot is usually unconstraint. All joints may move 
arbitrarily within their physical limitations and the constraints of the robot 
workspace, i.e., only limits of the position variables exist. This class of robots, 
described in Section 12.1.2, incorporates both manipulators and so-called “onmi-
directional” mobile robots. Special cases include interaction between a robot 
and components of its workspace, and cooperative action of two or more robots, 
requiring special treatment beyond the scope of this text. “Nonholonomic” 
robots face additional constraints of the time derivatives q
n
∈ℜ×1 of their 
position variables, i.e., constraints on the velocity variables. Section 12.1.3 
describes a kinematic and dynamic model for nonholonomic robots.
12.1.2. Holonomic Robot Model
A well-known example of highly nonlinear, fully actuated mechanical sys-
tems with coupled dynamics is a robot manipulator with rigid links. For a 
large class of holonomic robot systems, the generic dynamics in Equation 
12.1.2 can be rewritten in confi guration space as

skew symmetry, and boundedness of dynamic terms.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
12.1.3. Nonholonomic Robots: Model of Wheel-Set
Robots whose motion is subjected to a set of p nonintegrable constraints 
involving time derivatives of the confi guration vector q are classifi ed as non-
holonomic systems [see Neimark and Fufaev 1972]. The constraints usually 
take the form
 
G q q
( )
,
 = 0  
(12.1.20)
with the (n − p) independent columns of the p × n matrix G(q) forming the 
base for the nonholonomic constraint condition
 
q
K q u
=
( ) . 
(12.1.21)
Note that the number of control inputs is less than the dimension of the sys-
tem, i.e., underactuation with u ∈ ℜn−p follows from Equation 12.1.20. Consider 
a set of wheels with a common axle but independent wheel actuators as an 
example of a mobile robot with nonholonomic kinematics, as shown in Figure 
12.2. Assuming no slip at the tires, the motion of each wheel is restricted to 
its longitudinal direction with velocities νR and νL, respectively, by a single 
nonholonomic constraint (p = 1). In other words, no motion can occur along 
the lateral robot coordinate axis yR. Also shown in Figure 12.2 is the robot 
confi guration q = (x, y, ϕ) ∈ ℜ3 in the world coordinate frame (xw, yw). Control 
inputs are the two wheel velocities νR and νL, which may be translated into the 
translational and rotational velocity variables u = (νc, ω) ∈ ℜ2 for convenience. 
The motion of the wheel set in the world coordinate frame is given by

Equation 12.1.2. Control of a second-order mechanical system with a force/
torque input as in Equation 12.1.2 requires position and velocity feedback as 
a basis for stabilization, i.e., PD-type control. This requirement can be met 
by either measurement and feedback of both position and velocity variables 
or a lead compensator for position measurements in the linear sense [see 
Arimoto and Miyazaki 1984]. In sliding mode control designs, this require-
ment is refl ected in the choice of the sliding manifold with a stable motion, 
designed as a (linear) combination of position and velocity variables.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Since the fi rst set-point sliding mode controller for robot manipulators sug-
gested by Young [1978], numerous variations have been presented in the lit-
erature. In the sequel, we seek to outline the set of principle design choices to 
be made when designing a sliding mode tracking controller for a mechanical 
system like that in Equation 12.1.2. First, the designer may choose between 
componentwise control and vector control. Second, a pure discontinuous 
controller has to be compared with a continuous feedback/feedforward con-
troller with an additional discontinuity term to achieve robustness by gen-
erating sliding mode. For overviews, see Tables 12.6 and 12.7, respectively, at 
the end of this section.
Example 12.2: Circular Trajectory for Planar Two-Link Manipulator
For the control design examples in this section, we will demand the planar two-
link manipulator detailed in Example 12.1 to follow a circular trajectory in its 
workspace. The circle with center (xd, yd) and radius rd is given in world coordi-
nates (xw, yw) by

12.2.1. Componentwise Control 
The fi rst choice is mainly concerned with the structure of the sliding 
manifold(s). Because in system Equation 12.1.2 n force/torque inputs are 
assumed to control n confi guration outputs of the 2n-dimensional dynam-
ics, each component i of the n components of the output vector may be 
assigned its own sliding manifold and hence be controlled independently. 
Alternatively, the n components are dealt with as a vector (see Section 12.2.2). 
For componentwise control, the structure of the n sliding manifolds is

 implies 
bounded coupling forces/torques attributable to bounded accelerations of 
the other masses. In practical mechanical systems with one mass mi being 
associated with each control input τi, a hierarchical boundedness of cou-
pling terms is inherent. In particular, robot manipulators tend to be con-
structed with stronger and hence heavier links and joints near the base and 
with increasingly lighter links and joints toward the tip and the end effector. 
For an explicit stability analysis, the hierarchy of masses has to be solved 
reversely, a process that may become tedious for higher-dimensional sys-
tems. The details of the hierarchical design method may be found in previ-
ous work [Utkin 1992].
Alternatively to the individual design of components τi of control vector 
τ pursued in Theorem 12.1, the design may be based on a Lyapunov func-
tion constructed for the whole system instead for each subsystem. The main 
advantage of such a closed representation in vector form is the avoidance of 
hierarchical mass requirements attributable to the positive-defi nite property 
of the mass matrix M. It will be shown in Section 12.2.2 that using a control 
vector τ likewise enforces sliding mode.

For robots with on-off control inputs, i.e., control torques that may only take two 
values τ
τ
i = −
01  or τ
τ
i = +
01 , the maximum of Equation 12.2.18 over the whole 
desired trajectory in the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ tf should be taken. If the required control 
resources calculated from Equation 12.2.18 exceed the actual control resources of 
a given robot, the desired trajectory should be modiﬁ ed to decrease the required 
joint accelerations.
Also, because the starting point of the robot manipulator often coincides with 
the starting point of the desired trajectory, the initial errors are zero and sliding 
mode may occur immediately at the start. Thus, all errors and their derivatives are 
zero throughout the entire operation.
Figures 12.4 and 12.5 show the time trajectory in the robot workspace, the 
distances to the sliding manifolds, and the required control resources for the 
circular example trajectory (Equation 12.2.2). The initial conditions were cho-
sen to be nonzero for illustration purposes. Convergence to the sliding man-
ifolds in ﬁ nite time is illustrated by the top graph in Figure 12.5. Note the 
difference in required control resources for the two joints in the bottom graph 
of Figure 12.5.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
12.2.2. Vector Control

Sliding mode only occurs when all components of s in Equation 12.2.19 are 
equal to zero instead of occurring in each component separately as for com-
ponentwise control. Likewise, s = 0n×1 is the only discontinuity in control 
Equation 12.2.20, whereas Equation 12.2.4 features n control discontinui-
ties in vector τ

Compared with componentwise control design as in Theorem 12.1, vec-
tor control exploits matrix/vector norms for bounds in Equations 12.1.5 and 
12.1.9 through 12.1.11 in the stability analysis rather than single-parameter 
bounds. Although matrix/vector norms yield a more elegant and more con-
cise mathematical formulation, they are known to be conservative and may 
result in overestimation of the required control resources. In particular, 
because τ

 in Equations 12.2.8 and 12.2.23, all components τi 
of the control input vector τ in Equation 12.2.21 are required at least resources 
τ0. For mechanical systems with inhomogeneous masses and actuators, such 
a requirement may considerably exceed the system capabilities and compo-
nentwise control design is advisable. An example is a multilink robot manip-
ulator with heavy base links with strong joint actuators but smaller links 
near the end effector with preferably less powerful actuators.

12.2.3.  Continuous Feedback/Feedforward Control with

The two designs in Theorems 12.1 and 12.2 yield purely discontinuous con-
trollers. All system dynamics are treated as unknown disturbances and are 
suppressed by the control inputs. Only bounds on the system parameters 
are assumed to be known and are necessary for guaranteeing stability of 
the design. This approach is well suited for systems with in fact mostly 
unknown or highly uncertain parameters and with direct implementability 
of a sliding mode controller. In cases of at least partially known parameters 
and in the presence of additional unmodeled dynamics, requiring one of the

forward structure is advisable. Another advantage of this second alternative 
choice is the possibility to exploit the physical properties of the system to 
the benefi t of the control performance. In particular, for robot manipulators 
with dynamics described by Equation 12.1.3, the skew-symmetry property 
(Equation 12.1.8) can be used. Although this approach is suitable for both 
componentwise control and vector control, we focus on the latter for ease 
and clarity of presentation. Componentwise control was discussed previ-
ously [Slotine 1985; Chen, Mita, and Wahui 1990].

The feedback/feedforward terms follow the ideas of feedback lineariza-
tion: to obtain a basically linearized outer control loop by appropriate cancel-
lation of all nonlinear terms in an inner control loop. In robotic applications, 
this technique is referred to as “computed torque control” [Hunt, Su, and

Meyer 1983; Gilbert and Ha 1984]. Related approaches directly use energy 
considerations derived from the Euler-Lagrange formulation [Takegaki and 
Arimoto 1981] or the “natural motion” of the mechanical system [Koditschek 
1991]. An advantage over classical feedback linearization is the possibility to 
exploit the dynamics of the system, such as the skew-symmetry property of 
robot manipulators, rather than canceling all nonlinear terms via feedback 
regardless of their possibly benefi cial infl uence in closed loop. Various other 
approaches in this class of controllers have been proposed in the literature to 
improve the accuracy of the feedback/feedforward terms, e.g., reducing the 
estimation error by adaptive or robust adaptive control. The underlying idea 
is to minimize control action in the outer loop. For a more detailed treatment 
of feedback/feedforward strategies , the interested reader is encouraged to 
study textbooks on robot control [such as Craig 1988; Spong and Vidyasagar 
1989; Lewis, Abdallah, and Dawson 1993]. 
Example 12.5: Feedback/Feedforward Control of Two-Link Manipulator
To design a feedback/feedforward controller, estimates of the model parameters 
are required. For clarity, the parameter estimates in this example are chosen as the 
average of the lower and upper bounds of the model parameters as given in Table 
12.2. The estimated parameters are denoted with circumﬂ exes (^) ; their numeric 
values are given in Table 12.5. Note that the estimates for Coriolis/centripetal 
effects are set to zero because of the contained trigonometric functions.
Furthermore, auxiliary variable λ( )t  needs to be calculated in addition to sliding 
manifold Equation 12.2.34:

The stability proof exploits Lyapunov function candidate Equation 12.2.36 with 
its time derivative given in Equation 12.2.37. Matrix bounds for the estimation 
errors are obtained in a similar manner as in the example in Section 12.1.2. For

the upper bound is considerably smaller than the corresponding value of M+ = 
205.511kg/m2. Consequently, the amplitude of the control discontinuity term, τ0 in 
Equation 12.2.41, can be chosen signiﬁ cantly smaller than in Equation 12.2.28.
Figures 12.8 and 12.9 illustrate the performance of the continuous feedback/
feedforward controller with a small discontinuity term in a similar manner as 
in the previous examples in Sections 12.2.1 and 12.2.2. However, because the 
continuous feedback/feedforward part also requires control resources, the bot-
tom graph of Figure 12.9 depicts a low-pass-ﬁ ltered average of the total con-
trol torques τ1 and τ2. The simulation example suggests that the required control 
resources are in the same order of magnitude as in the case of componentwise 
control in Section 12.2.1. Note that convergence to the  sliding manifold is slower 
than in the previous examples, but both components reach the manifold simul-
taneously because of the unit vector characteristic of the discontinuity term in 
Equation 12.2.41.

12.2.4. Discussion of Sliding Mode Control Design Choices
The previous three sections presented three control design alternatives for 
mechanical systems based on two choices: componentwise control or vector 
control, and purely discontinuous control versus continuous feedback/feed-
forward control with an additional discontinuity term. The fourth possible 
control alternative, continuous feedback/feedforward control with an addi-
tional, componentwise discontinuity term, is omitted here for brevity. The 
interested reader is encouraged to study a simple design example such as the 
planar two-link manipulator given in Section 12.1.2 for this combination of 
choices. 
All four control design alternatives have one feature in common: they 
enforce sliding mode in some manifold and thus achieve exact tracking of the 
desired trajectory. Besides the differences in control design methodologies,

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
the four alternatives differ in the required control resources for each joint. 
Whereas componentwise control seeks to determine the necessary resources 
for each joint but requires tedious derivations, vector control is more concise 
at the expense of higher control resource requirements. 
In all four control alternatives, the control discontinuities are used to 
suppress model uncertainties and, in practice, external disturbances. 
Continuous feedback/feedforward control reduces the amount of model 
uncertainty to be suppressed by the control discontinuity. However, for the 
choice “componentwise control versus vector control,” the uncertainty to 
be suppressed remains the same, and the difference in amplitude of the 
discontinuity terms arises from the stability proof rather than from system 
requirements. 
For ideal sliding mode control systems with direct implementation of 
the discontinuity term, pure discontinuous control as in Theorem 12.2 
is equivalent to the continuous feedback/feedforward control with addi-
tional discontinuous control in Theorem 12.3. After reaching the sliding 
manifold, the motions of the two systems are identical. This can be estab-
lished using the equivalent control method discussed in Section 2.3. In 
fact, the equivalent control torques during sliding mode are similar for 
all four alternatives: all control algorithms on average apply the torques 
necessary to follow the desired trajectory. Higher amplitudes of the dis-
continuity only shorten the transient phase for approaching the sliding 
manifold.
For sliding mode designs in systems with unmodeled dynamics, the 
feedback/feedforward structure enables to use “smaller” sliding gains τ0, 
thought to cause chattering. Even with the chattering problem being solved 
reliably, a similar qualitative argumentation holds for most chattering pre-
vention schemes, in particular for the saturation function method in Section 
8.2 and the observer-based approach in Section 8.3. These methods avoid 
excitation of unmodeled dynamics by replacing the infi nite gain of an ideal 
sliding mode controller with a fi nite gain in the linear zone of the saturation 
function or in the observer loop, respectively. 
For a given system, the nature of the unmodeled dynamics, especially 
their frequency range, determines a practical upper bound for the fi nite 
gain. This bound on the saturation feedback gain implies bounded ability to 
suppress uncertainties and disturbances. In general, the smaller the possi-
ble gains, the larger the errors, i.e., the larger the boundary zone introduced 
by the saturation function or the larger the observer errors. Consequently, 
feedback of estimated dynamics and feedforward of the desired trajectory 
improves the performance of the control system by reducing the amount of 
uncertainty to be suppressed by the sliding mode term. Tables 12.6 and 12.7 
contrast the general choices for sliding mode control design for mechanical 
systems.

12.3. Gradient Tracking Control
Trajectory tracking control as discussed in the previous section implies an 
a priori designed trajectory qd to be given for the entire robot operation. 
Expansion of the range of robot tasks and an increase in robot autonomy led 
to the need to generate trajectories online, for example, to avoid collisions 
with obstacles in the workspace while approaching a given goal point. A 
popular tool for online trajectory generation with inherently included colli-
sion avoidance is the artifi cial potential fi eld method, pioneered by Khatib 
[1986] and refi ned by many others. The key idea is to design an artifi cial 
potential fi eld in the control computer with a global minimum at the goal 
point of the robot operation and local maxima at workspace obstacles. Robot 
motion then is guided by the gradient of the computer-generated artifi cial 
potential fi eld instead of by a predetermined trajectory.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
This method is an early form of virtual reality, because the potential fi eld 
is generated “artifi cially” in the control computer without any physical rele-
vance. However, many approaches exploit physical phenomena to design the 
artifi cial potential fi eld, e.g., electrostatics, fl uid dynamics, or stress mechan-
ics. To avoid additional local minima away from the goal point, which may 
trap the robot and cause premature termination of the operation, harmonic 
Laplace fi elds are often used, using either the von-Neumann or the Dirichlet 
boundary conditions.
A number of methods to guide the robot motion using artifi cial potential 
fi elds have been presented in the literature, including the following.
Coupling of the Gradient of the Artifi cial Potential Field into the 
Robot Dynamics Via the Control Input: The control force/torques 
are applied colinear to the gradient, implementing a dynamic rela-
tionship between the robot and its environment in the general 
framework of impedance control of mechanical systems [Hogan 
1985]. Effectively, the robot acceleration vector q t( ) is oriented along 
the gradient, which obviously does not lead to tracking of the gra-
dient because of the robot’s inertial dynamics. However, safe colli-
sion avoidance can be guaranteed for potentials tending to infi nity

at obstacle boundaries, even for bounded actuator resources [Rimon 
and Koditschek 1992].
Accounting for the Robot Dynamics and Actuator Limitations 
in the Design of the Potential Field: Krogh’s “generalized poten-
tial fi eld” [Krogh 1984] considers the time needed to reach the goal 
point or an obstacle rather than the respective distance. The con-
trol design is based on a double integrator to model a mobile robot 
and takes into account limited actuator resources, but no additional 
dynamics.
Using Feedback for Tracking the Gradient of the Potential Field: 
Khatib [1986] proposed a feedback linearization strategy, similar to 
the continuous feedback/feedforward control discussed in Section 
12.2.3, assuming exact parametric knowledge of all robot dynam-
ics. This rather restrictive requirement was relieved by Koditschek’s 
[1991] “natural motion” approach for dissipative mechanical systems 
and a related, energy-based approach by Takegaki and Arimoto 
[1981]. However, in Koditschek’s approach, the gradient of the arti-
fi cial potential fi eld implicitly takes into account the robot mass/
inertia matrix for generating natural motion and hence cannot be 
designed independently of the robot dynamics.
Using Sliding Mode Control for Exact Tracking of a Gradient: 
Utkin, Drakunov, Hashimoto, and Harashima [1991] proposed to 
orient the robot’s velocity vector along the gradient of the artifi cial 
potential fi eld to achieve exact tracking. The method was later gener-
alized by Guldner and Utkin [1995] and will be the basis for control 
design in this section. The primary advantage is the exact gradi-
ent tracking property, which allows an artifi cial gradient fi eld to be 
designed independently. 
Let the gradient of an artifi cial potential fi eld U(q) be denoted by 
 
E(q) = −∇U(q), E(q) ∈ ℜn. 
(12.3.1)
For each point q ∈ ℜn in the robot workspace, the gradient Equation 12.3.1 
defi nes a vector of a desired direction of motion. Integration along the gradi-
ent vector via

with integration variable t (not necessarily denoting time) yields a continu-

of gradient lines is depicted in Figure 12.10 for a planar example of the har-
monic dipole potential method [Guldner, Utkin, and Hashimoto 1997] with a

single obstacle being protected by a circular security zone. All gradient lines 
starting in the robot free space continuously approach the goal point without 
entering the security zone. However, a number of gradient lines come close 
to the security circle, which can only result in safe operation if exact tracking 
is guaranteed via robust sliding mode control.
12.3.1. Control Objectives
The goal of control is to track the gradient of an arbitrary artifi cial potential 
fi eld (Equation 12.3.1) with a robot manipulator described by Equation 12.1.3 
or a mobile robot such as Equations 12.1.22 through 12.1.24. Exact tracking 
can be achieved by orienting the velocity vector q t( ) of Equation 12.1.3 colin-
ear to the gradient vector E in Equation 12.3.1. To avoid singularities at equi-
librium points E = 0n×1, we defi ne the desired motion vector q q

to the characteristics of this desired trajectory, required control resources 
were calculated from the stability analysis. Here, we choose a different path: 
the control resource limitations are assumed to be given. Then, the motion 
profi le (velocity and acceleration) is derived online together with the desired 
trajectory, i.e., the gradient of the artifi cial potential fi eld. The desired scalar 
tracking velocity vd(q, t) thus should be adjusted to enable exact tracking with 
limited control resources. Given a maximal possible acceleration a0, to be 
determined in the sequel from the available control resources, suitable start-
ing and goal-approach phases are given by

ζ is the remaining distance to the goal point qG, i.e., 
 
ζ = ||q(t) − qG||. 
(12.3.5)
Starting from initial time t = 0, the desired velocity vd(q, t) is increased using 
maximal acceleration a0 until the traveling velocity v0(q, t) is reached.
Required acceleration a0 during “normal traveling” with vd(q, t) = v0(q, t) is 
found from Equation 12.3.3 as

12.3.2. Gradient Tracking Control Design for Holonomic Robots
Among the four choices of control design outlined for trajectory tracking 
control in Tables 12.6 and 12.7, purely discontinuous vector control features 
the most concise mathematical formulation and hence will be used here to 
reveal the basic principle structure of gradient tracking control design. The 
design presented below can be easily reformulated in terms of one of the 
three other methods described in Section 12.2.
The control objective defi ned in the preceding section is to guarantee

 given in Equations 12.3.3 and 12.3.4 at all times. The main differ-
ence between trajectory tracking control and gradient tracking control is that 
in the latter, velocity vector q
n
∈ℜ rather than position vector q ∈ ℜn, is used 
as the control variable. Desired velocity q t
d( ) implicitly depends on position 
vector q ∈ ℜn via the gradient vector E(q) ∈ ℜn and hence can be regarded 
as an outer control loop encompassing the robot and its environment. For 
gradient tracking control on velocity scale, an n-dimensional sliding variable 
s ∈ ℜn is chosen as

The system in Equation 12.3.15 with bounds as given in Equation 12.1.5 and 
12.1.9 through 12.1.11 under control in Equation 12.3.17 will reach the sliding 
manifolds of Equation 12.3.16 in fi nite time.

12.3.3. Gradient Tracking Control Design for Nonholonomic Robots
Gradient tracking control for nonholonomic robots also follows the control 
objectives given in Section 12.3.1. As an example, we will discuss control 
design for a mobile robot modeled as a nonholonomic wheel set as shown in 
Figure 12.2 in Section 12.1.3. The kinematic and dynamic models were given 
in Equations 12.1.22 and 12.1.23 through 12.1.24, respectively. The task of ori-
enting the motion vector of the wheel set along the gradient vector according 
to Equations 12.3.3 through 12.3.5 can be split into two subtasks because of 
the defi nition of the input vector u in Equation 12.1.22: orientation control 
using ω and velocity control using vC. Hence, componentwise control design 
is most suitable. The sliding manifold for velocity control along the gradient 
lines, the translational motion, is defi ned as 
 
st = vd(q, t) − vC = 0 
(12.3.21)
for the case E q
( ) > ε.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
12.4. Application Examples
In this section, we present a variety of examples for the use of sliding mode 
philosophy in advanced robotic systems. First, torque control of a fl exible 
robot joint using integral sliding mode is presented. Next, we discuss the 
application of the gradient tracking control derived in Section 12.3 for col-
lision avoidance of mobile robots and robot manipulators in known work-
spaces. Finally, we introduce fully automatic steering control for passenger 
cars as an extension of robotic systems.
12.4.1. Torque Control for Flexible Robot Joints
In many practical applications, robot joints and robot links exhibit fl exibili-
ties that need to be considered when designing advanced control algorithms. 
As an example [for details, see Shi and Lu 1993], consider a single revolute 
link with a fl exible joint, i.e., a robot consisting of just one link actuated by 
one drive with fl exibilities in the joint. Extension of this model to multilink 
robot arms follows along the lines of Equation 12.1.3 but is omitted here for 
ease of notation. Neglecting actuator dynamics, a fl exible joint model can be 
derived as

we will study torque tracking control (acceleration scale) in this example,

term and a low-frequency component, i.e., the equivalent control ueq. As 
 discussed in detail in Section 2.4, the equivalent control is equal to the 
average of u, obtained for example by a low-pass fi lter. With this in 
mind, ueq = uave = τp follows from comparing Equations 12.4.5 and 12.4.14.

Hence, the sliding mode estimator τr successfully rejects both the uncertain-
ties in parameters a and b and additive disturbance d in Equation 12.4.2 and 
allows controller Equation 12.4.4 to perform exact pole placement. It should 
be noted that the low-pass fi lter time constant or bandwidth has to be care-
fully chosen to be faster than the perturbation dynamics in τp but at the same 
time to be slow enough not to excite unmodeled dynamics in the system 
such as the neglected actuator dynamics producing torque τm. In particular, 
the extreme case of direct implementation without averaging as τr = u with 
u defi ned in Equation 12.4.9 led to chattering in experiments reported by Lu 
and Chen [1993]. 
A simulation study of the controller discussed above is based on the 
mechanical model in Figure 12.11. The system parameters were chosen as
 
Jm = 1.0e − 5, n = 600, Jl = nJm/4, k = 10, 
(12.4.17)
and subject to a square-wave (sqw(⋅)) disturbance of the form
 
dm = 1 + sqw(50t)

on the motor side. Assuming perfect parameter knowledge, i.e., known Jm, 
Jl, n and k, the poles were both assigned to −200 by defi ning c1 = 400 and 
c0 = 40,000. The disturbance was upper bounded by d

a planar workspace with known obstacles. Workspaces of higher dimension 
are discussed in the subsequent section. The obstacle avoidance scheme with 
the gradient tracking algorithm of Section 12.3 form the core of a hierarchical 
path control scheme [see Guldner, Utkin, and Bauer 1995].
The known obstacles in the robot workspace are protected by security 
zones, which form the basis for the design of an artifi cial potential fi eld. A set 
of diffeomorph transformations given by Rimon and Koditschek [1992] pro-
vides a mapping between arbitrary star-shaped security zones and security 
circles. Hence, the design of an artifi cial potential fi eld may concentrate on 
obstacle security circles in transformed space. After calculating the artifi cial 
potential fi eld and its gradient in the transformed space, an inverse mapping 
provides the back transformation into the real robot workspace. The obstacle 
security zones are assumed to be nonoverlapping, with the goal point lying 
outside of all security zones.
The main advantage of the transformation procedure is the possibility 
to concentrate the design of the artifi cial potential fi eld on security circles 
for the obstacles rather than on security zones of complex shape. Thanks to 
the exact tracking capability of the gradient tracking controller discussed in 
Section 12.3, the artifi cial potential fi eld can be designed independently of 
the robot dynamics, enabling a wide variety of applications.
An example of a possible choice of an artifi cial potential fi eld is the har-
monic dipole potential in ℜ2 suggested by Guldner and Utkin [1995]. For a 
singularity at the origin, the harmonic potential is given by
 
U
r
= ρ ln

 (12.4.20)
where ρ denotes the “strength” of the singularity, and r is the distance from 
the origin. For convenience, a polar coordinate system (r, φ) is adopted here.

The resulting gradient lines were already displayed in Figure 12.10. Note two 
properties of harmonic dipoles:
All gradient lines beginning outside the security circle remain 
outside.
Following any gradient line outside the security circle monotonously 
decreases the distance to the goal point. 
These properties are preserved under the above mentioned diffeomorph 
transformations. For details and proofs, refer to the work of Guldner and 
Utkin [1995]. 
To reduce the computational complexity, many artifi cial potential fi eld 
approaches only consider one obstacle at each time instance and switch 
between the potentials associated with different obstacles, e.g., when the 
robot gets closer to a different obstacle than the one currently considered. 
The switching between potentials of different obstacles led to oscillations in 
several approaches, for example, reported by Koren and Borenstein [1991], 
which are caused by the robot inertia and time delays in the closed-loop sys-
tem “obstacle-potential fi eld-robot.” An example is shown in Figure 12.13 for 
a circular robot, oscillating around the equidistant line between two obstacle 
potentials. The obstacles themselves are omitted in this and the following 
fi gures.
An intuitive solution to the oscillation problem is the introduction of a 
low-pass fi lter for the artifi cial potential fi eld or its gradient, leading to a 
time-dependent fi eld. However, a low-pass fi lter is reactive, i.e., is only start-
ing to consider the new potential when the robot crosses the equidistant line 
between the obstacles. Thus, the oscillations can only be damped but not be 
eliminated completely, as illustrated in Figure 12.14.

A closer look at the oscillation phenomenon reveals that it is similar to 
chattering in variable structure systems as discussed in Chapter 8. In fact, 
the oscillations are caused by unmodeled dynamics in the closed-loop sys-
tem “obstacle-potential fi eld-robot”: the switching between the potential 
fi elds of different obstacles neglects the robot dynamics. In the vicinity of 
the equidistant line, the gradient lines may be oriented toward this line 
(see Figure 12.15a), and the trajectory fi eld resembles the state space of a 
dynamic system with sliding mode. Formally, sliding mode may appear 
along the line in our case with the robot trajectory coinciding with the equi-
distant line. In the course of this motion, the robot avoids collisions with 
obstacles and approaches the goal. Unfortunately, this ideal motion cannot

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
be implemented. Indeed, ideal sliding mode would ask for the speed vec-
tor tracking the smooth gradient lines of each of two adjoining potential 
fi elds to undergo discontinuities on the equidistant line. This implies that 
the control force or torque should develop infi nite acceleration, which is 
impossible because of physical constraints. As a result, the robot trajec-
tory oscillates in the vicinity of the equidistant line (see Figure 12.10) as 
in a system with chattering. Because of this similarity, a reliable solution 
is the application of one of the methods discussed in Chapter 8 to prevent 
chattering. 
As an example, the boundary layer approach as described in Section 8.2 
is used in the sequel. Instead of switching the potential fi eld abruptly when 
the robot crosses the equidistant line between two obstacles, both poten-
tials U1(q) and U2(q) are considered simultaneously in a boundary layer of 
width δ along the equidistant line. The resulting total potential fi eld is

12.14 compares the gradient lines for an example with two obstacle security 
ellipses. Note the difference of the gradient lines in the vicinity of the equidis-
tant line denoted by sequi = 0. The discontinuities along sequi = 0 visible in the 
left graph of Figure 12.15 are eliminated by the introduction of the boundary 
layer δ along sequi = 0 in the right graph. Figure 12.16 illustrates that this appli-
cation of sliding mode theory to the collision avoidance problem successfully 
eliminates the oscillations [see Guldner, Utkin, and Bauer 1994]. 
12.4.3. Collision Avoidance in Higher-Dimensional Known Workspaces
This section extends the results of the previous section for mobile robots in pla-
nar workspaces to robots in higher-dimensional workspaces ℜn, n > 2, in par-
ticular to robot manipulators. Details of the development in this section may 
be found in previous work [Guldner, Utkin, and Hashimoto 1997]. The concept 
of transforming star-shaped obstacle security zones into security circles is car-
ried over to ℜn by using security spheres (for n = 3) and security hyperspheres 
(for n > 3). However, it is beyond this book to generalize the diffeomorph trans-
formations given previously [Rimon and Koditschek 1992] to n > 2. As in the 
planar case, obstacles are assumed to be known, with  nonoverlapping security 
zones and a reachable goal point outside any security zone.
Instead of redesigning the harmonic potential in Equation 12.4.20 for ℜn, 
n > 2, the aforementioned properties of the planar gradient (Equation 
12.4.21) are further exploited. Because in any space ℜn, n > 2, three points 
uniquely defi ne a subspace of dimension n = 2, a projection onto such a pla-
nar subspace allows to continue to use the planar harmonic dipole  potential

where ρ is found according to Equation 12.4.22 with D = ||qR − qS|| and qG, 
qR, qS ∈ ℜn are taken as vectors. A three-dimensional example is shown in 
Figure 12.17 with a sphere-like robot traveling in plane ℘(q) toward the goal 
point in the origin of the coordinate system.
For multiple obstacles in the workspace, a switching procedure similar 
to the planar case is designed. Each obstacle is assigned to its own security 
zone, each of which is separately transformed into a security (hyper)sphere. 
In ℜn, n > 2, the switching between different artifi cial potentials for vari-
ous obstacles takes place in subspaces of varying dimension. Consider 
the example of a three-dimensional situation. Between two obstacles, one 
two-dimensional equidistant subspace can be found, i.e., an equidistant 
FIGURE 12.17

plane. Introducing a third obstacle in this exemplary three-dimensional 
workspace leads to a total of three equidistant planes for each combina-
tion of two of the three obstacle security zones. Additionally, the points 
of equidistant to all three obstacles form a one-dimensional subspace, an 
equidistant line.
Generalizing the above to arbitrary ℜn, n > 2, yields subspaces ℜn−1 equi-
distant to exactly two of the obstacle security zones, subspaces ℜn−2 equi-
distant to exactly three of the obstacle security zones, and subspaces ℜn−k+1 
equidistant to exactly 1 < k < n of the obstacle security zones, with k being 
the number of obstacles among all workspace obstacles that may have to be 
considered simultaneously. The equidistant subspaces for various obstacle 
security zones are equivalent to Voronoi planes [see Latombe 1991], often 
used for robot path planning. In contrast to Voronoi-based approaches, the 
equidistant subspaces do not have to be computed explicitly for the follow-
ing switching strategy.
To avoid oscillations along the switching planes, i.e., the equidistant 
subspaces, boundary zones of appropriate dimension are introduced as 
an extension of Equation 12.4.25. Consider an ℜn situation with k obsta-
cles in which the gradients in all adjacent regions converge to equidis-

potentials enables tracking without oscillations. It should be noted that the 
robot motion is only confi ned to the boundary zone Bk
n as long as all k gra-
dients in adjacent regions are directed toward the equidistant subspace Θk
n. 
When the robot has passed an obstacle, the boundary zone may be left, and 
new equidistant subspaces with a different number of obstacles considered 
simultaneously are found until the goal point is reached. There is no inten-
tion to create sliding motion along the equidistant subspaces, although the 
motion trajectories may temporarily resemble boundary layer sliding mode 
trajectories.
This section concludes with two examples in ℜ3. First, consider the spheri-
cal robot of Figure 12.17 in a workspace with three obstacles and the goal 
point in the origin of the coordinate system as shown in Figure 12.18. The 
varying number of obstacles is illustrated in Figure 12.19 according to the 
distance of the robot to the respective obstacles. Initially, only obstacle 1 in 
the bottom left corner is considered. After about 0.6 sec, the robot enters the 
boundary plane between the two lower obstacles 1 and 2. Finally, when the 
top obstacle 3 has the same distance from the robot as obstacle 2, all three 
obstacles are considered in the calculation of the resulting potential and 
the robot travels in the boundary zone of the equidistant line toward the 
goal point.

is located in origin of the coordinate system. See also Figure 12.19. Obstacle 1 is in the bottom 
left corner. Obstacle 2 is in the bottom right corner. Obstacle 3 is in the top center.

Because the previous examples in Figures 12.17 through 12.19 are rather 
abstract, being based on “free-fl ying” spherical robots, the next example 
shows the application of the above algorithm to a more realistic problem 
of a revolute robot manipulator with three links and three joints, avoiding 
cylindrical obstacles in its three-dimensional workspace. The potential fi elds 
were calculated in the robot’s ℜ3 confi guration space rather than in the ℜ3 
workspace. Figure 12.20 shows the robot motion in the actual workspace in 
nine snapshots. Details of this application have been described by Guldner, 
Utkin, and Hashimoto [1997].
12.4.4. Automatic Steering Control for Passenger Cars
Automatic steering control is the last example for the application of advanced 
robotics. Automation of vehicles, for example, for automated highways 
systems, has been discussed for several decades and is studied in various

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
 programs worldwide in the framework of intelligent transport systems [see 
Stevens 1996; Tsugawa, Aoki, Hosaka, and Seki 1996]. 
Two control subtasks arise for automated driving of “robot cars”: steer-
ing control to keep the vehicle in the lane (controlling the lateral motion) 
and throttle/brake control to maintain speed and proper spacing between 
vehicles (controlling the longitudinal motion). Both subtasks have been 
solved using sliding mode control. The focus in this section will be on 
automatic steering control. Longitudinal control was studied previously 
[see Hedrick, Tomizuka, and Varaiya 1994; Pham, Hedrick, and Tomizuka 
1994]. The automatic steering system of an automated vehicle consists of 
a reference system to determine the lateral vehicle position with respect 
to the lane center, sensors to detect the vehicle motion (typically yaw rate 
and lateral acceleration), and a steering actuator to steer the front wheels. 
The variety of reference systems used ranges from look-ahead systems, 
such as machine vision or radar, to look-down systems, such as electric 
wires or magnets embedded in the road surface. “Look-ahead/look-
down” describes the point of measurement of lateral vehicle displacement 
from the reference to be ahead of the vehicle or directly down from the 
front bumper [for a more detailed treatment, see Patwardhan, Tan, and 
FIGURE 12.20
Robot arm with three links avoiding two cylindrical obstacles. Obstacle security zones, de -
picted by ellipsoids, were transformed into confi guration space, and the potential fi elds were

ence system.
Control design is usually based on the so-called single-track model, which 
concentrates on the main vehicle mass by combining the two wheels at each 
axle into a single wheel. The road-tire interaction forces are responsible for 
generating planar lateral and yaw vehicle motions, with the front wheel 
steering angle δf being the input variable. A linearized second-order model 
for constant speed v is given by

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Given Equations 12.4.31 and 12.4.32, various control design options are 
possible. As an example, we present a cascaded control design under the 
assumption that vehicle yaw rate Ψ is measurable by a gyroscope. The 
control design follows the regular form methodology (see Section 3.2) and 
considers the subsystem in Equation 12.4.31 as the input to the subsys-
tem in Equation 12.4.32. Hence, the fi rst design step assumes yaw rate 
Ψ to be a direct input to Equation 12.4.32 and derives a desired yaw rate 
Ψd. The second step then ensures that the actual, measured vehicle yaw 
rate Ψ follows Ψd exactly via appropriate control design for steering angle 
δf in Equation 12.4.31, the true system input. A suitable continuous feed-
back/feedforward “yaw rate” controller to stabilize the fi rst equation in 
Equation 12.4.32 would be

with linear feedback gain C > 0. However, neither side slip angle β nor yaw 
angle error Ψe can be measured and hence have to be estimated by an observer 
[for details, see Guldner, Utkin, and Ackermann 1994]. Introducing auxiliary

where estimates of vehicle parameters are denoted with circumfl exes ( .ˆ ), the 
estimate of side slip angle, ˆβ, stems from an observer similar to Equation 
12.4.34, and the derivative of the desired yaw rate, Ψd, can be derived from 
Equation 12.4.35 by virtue of known observer dynamics. Because of the con-
tinuous feedback/feedforward terms in Equation 12.4.37, the gain of the dis-
continuity term can be reduced compared to Equation 12.4.36, i.e., δ1 < δ0.
The above control design neglects the dynamics of the steering actuator, 
which will lead to chattering in practical implementations. In addition to 
the chattering prevention methods discussed in Chapter 8, the introduc-
tion of an integrator in the control loop proved to be a promising approach. 
Originally, the integrator was a physical model of the actuator dynamics [see 
Ackermann et al. 1993], with the steering rate u being the system input as
 
δ f
u
=

(12.4.38)
rather than the steering angle δf  itself. The additional integrator only requires 
to alter the outer control loop (Equations 12.4.36 and 12.4.37). Defi ne a sec-

leading to a control law 
 
δf = δ0 sign s 
(12.4.40)
instead of Equation 12.4.36. The alternative feedback/feedforward controller 
term in Equation 12.4.37 has to be adjusted accordingly. If the real steering 
actuator is not an integrator as in Equation 12.4.38 but features more com-
plex dynamics, for example, of an electrohydraulic actuator, two design alter-
natives are left to the control engineer. Either, a sliding mode controller is 
designed according to Equations 12.4.36 and 12.4.37 with appropriate mea-
sures to prevent chattering as discussed in Chapter 8 or an integrator like that 
in Equation 12.4.38 is introduced as part of the controller, i.e., realized in the 
controller software. The latter case follows the ideas of integral sliding mode 
by implementing sliding motion in an integral manifold rather than directly 
in the control input variable δf. Hence, the switching action of the sliding mode 
discontinuity is fi rst fi ltered by integrator Equation 12.4.38 and thus does not 
directly reach the input δf, which inherently prevents chattering. A different 
integrator location in the control loop has been proposed by Pham, Hedrick, 
and Tomizuka [1994], before rather than after the  switching discontinuity. For 
a comparison study of different integrator locations in the controller loop, 
the interested reader is referred to the work of Hingwe and Tomizuka [1995]. 
Experimental results from this work are displayed in Figure 12.22.

Automotive Applications
This chapter presents different applications of sliding modes to 
a wide range of control and estimation in automotive industry. 
Sliding mode is recognized as an effi cient approach for design of 
robust controllers for complex nonlinear systems operating under 
uncertainty con ditions, which is common for automotive systems. 
When designing such systems, high accuracy and dynamic prop-
erties should be associated with reliability, low cost, and ease of 
maintenance, which implies minimization of the number of sen-
sors to acquire the information on the system state. Sliding mode 
state observers proved to be a promising way to simplify implemen-
tation of feedback systems. The items under study embrace three 
issues: control and estimation for combustion engine AFR (air-fuel 
ratio), camless combustion engines, and an automotive alternator. 
13.1. Air/Fuel Ratio Control
The ratio of injected air and fuel into a cylinder (ARF) should be maintained 
at a specifi c level (called stoichiometric ratio, equal to 14.7 for gasoline), cor-
responding to the maximum effi ciency of a combustion engine

evaporation dynamics of fuel in an intake port [Kim, Rizzoni, and Utkin 
1998] is based on the notion that a fraction of the fuel injected into the inlet 
port will condense to form a liquid fuel fi lm in the inlet port walls. The 
mass of liquid fuel will then change as a result of the addition of fuel from 
the injection process and the evaporation of the condensed fuel according to

An important aspect of the dynamics of a spark-ignition engine is the 
inherent delay of the combustion process and the transport of the exhaust 
gas between the exhaust valve and the oxygen sensor with only binary out-

delay. The sensor used to measure the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust 
gas can, to a fi rst approximation, be modeled as a fi rst-order lag with time 
constant τm and a delay

The fuel fl ow rate m fi from the injector takes the role of the control variable 
and should be designed such that AFR is equal to the stoichiometric ratio.

value of ηv is equal to average value of Ψ obtained by fi ltering out its high-
frequency component with a low-pass fi lter. Then, the air fl ow rate entering 
the cylinder can be calculated from Equation 13.1.2.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
Figure 13.1a compares the charge effi ciency ηv estimated from the sliding 
mode observer with the estimate obtained using the polynomial approxima-
tion. Figure 13.1b repeats the comparison for the air charge variable, adding 
also the measured air charge by the mass fl ow sensor, for the same experi-
mental conditions. The estimation results of the same variables during throt-
tle transient are illustrated in Figure 13.3. Unfortunately, it is impossible to 
obtain a reliable measurement of the air fl ow rate during a transient.
Estimation of fuel fi lm and AFR using a nonlinear oxygen sensor can be 
done by the observer proposed in this section: observer with binary mea-
surement. With this observer, in addition to estimate of mff, the current value 
of AFR can also be estimated.
Figure 13.4 shows the estimation of the fuel fl ow in fuel fi lm and linear 
AFR sensor. After initial transient attributable to the difference in initial

conditions, the estimated states converge to the actual states within a rea-
sonable accuracy except during throttle tip-in.
The measurement was performed by the sensor with continuous reading, 
which is much more expensive than the binary oxygen sensor used for pro-
duction vehicles.
The observers in this section are simulated using for the mean value model 
[Kim, Rizzoni, and Utkin, 1998]. Figure 13.5 shows a comparison between the 
response from a standard PI controller and the response with transient fuel 
compensation using the observer-based method. As can be seen in Figure 
13.5, the AFR excursion during transient is improved remarkably with tran-
sient fuel compensation.

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
13.2. Camless Combustion Engine
Replacing a cam shaft by individual solenoid-type actuators for each cyl-
inder is a new promising technological approach. It leads to fuel econ-
omy as a result of reduction of pumping losses and lower idle speed, can 
improve engine performance, and reduce nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon in 
exhaust gas attributable to individual control of each cylinder [Holfman and 
Stefanopoulou 2001; Chun and Tsao 2003] .The position of each valve (Figure 
13.6) is controlled by the input voltage of the solenoid; the valve is subjected 
to electromagnetic and spring forces. To avoid valve damage, the feedback 
control should be designed such that up and down travels of the valve are 
monotonous, called the soft-seating problem. The design idea will be illus-
trated for a simplifi ed model without a spring (Figure 13.7).

the control u0 can be selected such that the values of s and s have different 
signs. Then, according to Equation 2.4.1, sliding mode occurs after a fi nite 
time interval, and condition in Equation 13.2.4 holds. 
The control has been designed assuming that all state components are avail-
able. Two scenarios will be analyzed below: control design with position and 
current measurement, and control design with only current measurement.
First, when only current is measured, analyze local observability of the 
linearized system in the vicinity of the steady-state point (Equation 13.2.2)

verifi ed by simulation as well the monotonous convergence of z1 to zero 
(Figure 13.9).
The control method developed in this section was tested using an experi-
mental setup of VISTEON. The control (Equations 13.2.4 and 13.2.5) was 
implemented using measurement of both the current and the valve position. 
The speed of the valve z2 is found using the observer:

13.3. Observer for Automotive Alternator
This section presents a method for estimating back-EMF without a direct 
mechanical sensor of the rotor position [Utkin, Chen, Zarei, and Miller 1997, 
1999]. The back EMFs are needed to implement high-effi ciency control of an 
automotive alternator (AC generator). 
The electrical circuit of the automotive electrical power supply system is 
shown in Figure 13.11. 
The AC generator is composed of three identical windings with induc-
tance L and resistance Rw. The switching signals um (m = 1, 2, 3) represent the 
controllable rectifi er, which can be either 1 or −1. A value of 1 means that the 
phase winding is connected to the “plus” terminal, and a value of –1 con-
nects it to the “minus” terminal of the battery. The dynamic equations of the 
system are represented by

a simplifi ed model of the battery charging system with capacitor C, internal 
resistance of the battery Rb, and consumer loads RL(t) in the automobile elec-
tric system. uc stands for the voltage of the capacitor, and im refers to the AC 
phase currents. 
The alternator’s back EMFs em(t) are needed for switching assignment 
of the controllable rectifi er. The EMFs are sinusoidal functions with

 frequency and amplitude depending on the engine speed, if the speed is 
constant.
In the following, observer design for the state variables of phase m = 1 will 
be presented. The state variables associated with the second and third phases 
can be obtained in a similar manner. Because measurement of the phase cur-
rent may be prohibitive, the proposed observer uses only two sensors of the 
electrical variables: output DC voltage v0 and DC-link current ilink of the recti-
fi er. As shown in Figure 13.12, the phase current i1 coincides with the link cur-
rent only for short, reoccurring time intervals called observation windows. 
Let us fi rst design a sliding mode observer under the assumption that both 
phase current i1 and vo are available:

implying that limτ→0(z) = e1, if the switching frequency tends to infi nity 
(Section 2.3). Thus, the back EMF can be estimated by applying the equiva-
lent control method. However, in real-life systems, for example, systems with 
discrete-time implementation of a controller, the switching frequency is 
fi nite and the tradeoff between fi ltering out the high-frequency component 
of control and distortion of its low-frequency component dictates selection 
of the time constant τ.
The simulation results for the proposed observer Equations 13.3.3 and 
13.3.4 demonstrate dependence of the estimation accuracy on the time con-
stant τ for the case of constant engine speed. The parameters of the recti-
fi er are given in Table 13.1. Frequency and amplitude of the real EMF are 
equal to ω = 150 Hz and A = 9.6v, the sampling interval  δ = 1 μsec, M = 60. 
A  considerable phase shift between real value of e1 and its estimate can be 
seen for the case τ = 0.2 msec (Figure 13.13). To decrease the phase delay, it

is possible to reduce the time constant of the low-pass fi lter, for instance, to 
τ = 0.02 msec. However, this may result in a high-frequency component of 
the chattering as shown in Figure 13.14.
To overcome the chattering problem, the linear back-EMF model of the

Sliding Mode Control in Electro-Mechanical Systems
The observer input gains M > 0 and li > 0 (i = 1, 2, 3) are to be selected to pro-
vide convergence of all its states to the state of Equations 13.3.5 and 13.3.6. 
Observer stability analysis and selection of the observer parameters can be 
found in previous work [Chen 1998].
At a qualitative level, the design method can be explained in the fol-
lowing way. As mentioned, z ≈ e1; hence, the mismatch equations between 
states of the system and of the observer can be obtained from Equations 
13.3.6 and 13.3.7:

Ω as well as e1 tend to zero, and the back EMF, its time derivative, and fre-
quency are found simultaneously. As can be seen in the simulation results 
(Figure 13.15), the observer Equation 13.3.7 exhibits much better chatter-
ing suppression properties than a low-pass fi lter of the equivalent control 
Equation 13.3.4.
In the case of link current measurements, the input i1 in the fi rst equation 
of Equation 13.3.7 should be replaced by u1ilink, and the coeffi cients l1, l2 l3 
are selected such that the estimates converge to the real values within the

the observation windows. The estimation method with link current mea-
surement was tested at the experimental setup (Figure 13.16) in the Research 
Science Laboratory of Ford Motor Company.
The observation windows are indicated in Figure 13.17. The estimation 
result is close to the measured phase current. The estimation methods for 
time-varying engine speed with the battery current measurement, which 
is always available in commercially produced cars, and with discrete-time 
implementation can be found in previous works [Utkin, Chen, Zarei, and 
Miller 1997, 1999].
