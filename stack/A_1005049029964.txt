Abstract. We consider tilings of Euclidean spaces by polygons or polyhedra, in particular, tilings
made by a substitution process, such as the Penrose tilings of the plane. We deﬁne an isomorphism
invariant related to a subgroup of rotations and compute it for various examples. We also extend our
analysis to more general dynamical systems.

1. Introduction, Deﬁnitions and Statement of Results
This paper concerns tilings of Euclidean spaces by polygons or polyhedra, more
speciﬁcally, tilings made by a ‘substitution process’. Given a substitution rule,
the set of resultant tilings is a topological space with an action of the Euclidean
group, hence a dynamical system. We develop here an algebraic invariant that helps
determine when two tiling systems are equivalent as dynamical systems. In this
introduction we deﬁne the notions of ‘substitution tiling system’ and of equivalence
between two such systems, and state what the invariant is. In subsequent sections
we analyze the invariant, in particular we show its use in distinguishing between
substitution tilings.
Our eventual goal is to associate certain groups to substitution tilings of Euclid-
ean m-space. These groups, subgroups of SO(m), are generated by the relative
orientations of tiles in the tilings, depend on the speciﬁc tiling x and on some
speciﬁc choices (indexed by an integer j), and are denoted Oj(x). Although Oj(x)
depends on j and x, the dependence is quite controlled. If x and x′ are different
tilings with the same substitution rule we will show that, under some mild hypothe-
ses, Oj(x) and Oj′(x′) are conjugate as subgroups of SO(m). Even without the mild
hypotheses, they are conjugate (in SO(m)) to subgroups of one another, a condition
we call ‘c-equivalence’. So we can associate to a substitution tiling system the

common conjugacy class (or c-equivalence class) of the groups associated to the
tilings in the system.
What will remain, then, is to show that this conjugacy (or c-equivalence) class
can be considered an invariant in a natural sense. That is, we will show that two
substitution tiling systems that are equivalent as dynamical systems have the same
class of groups. We will do this by ﬁnding a dynamical description of the class.
For each ε > 0 and each tiling x we will deﬁne a group Oε(x) using dynamical
information only. For ε sufﬁciently small, and for almost every x, we show that
Oε(x) is conjugate to (or c-equivalent to) Oj(x) for some, and hence all, choices
j. The class of Oε(x) is thus the same as the class of Oj(x). Since Oε(x) is deﬁned
using data that is preserved by dynamical equivalence, the class of Oε(x) is a
dynamical invariant.
Note that the group Oj(x) depends only on the geometry of the tiling x. Since
the class of Oj(x) is the same for every tiling x with the given substitution rule, we
can obtain information about a substitution tiling system by looking at any single
tiling in it. So if two substitution tilings x and x′ give rise to groups Oj(x) and
Oj′(x′) that are not conjugate (or c-equivalent), then x and x′ cannot belong to
equivalent substitution tiling systems.
Before deﬁning substitution tiling systems in general, we present an example.
Hopefully, the general deﬁnitions will be clearer with this example in mind. The
‘pinwheel’ tiling of the plane [Ra1] is made as follows. Consider the triangles of
Figure 1. Divide one of them into ﬁve small triangles as in Figure 2 and expand the
ﬁgure about the origin by a linear factor of
√
5, producing 5 triangles congruent to
the originals.
Repeat this two-step procedure φ simultaneously for all the triangles of the
ﬁgure, then again, an inﬁnite number of times, producing a (pinwheel) tiling C of
the plane, a portion of which appears in Figure 3. Such tilings have a hierarchical
structure which is of interest for various reasons; in particular it leads to interesting
behavior of the relative orientations of tiles within a tiling [Ra3]. For background

Substitution Tiling Systems
With the pinwheel example in mind, we now address substitution tiling systems in
general. Let A be a nonempty ﬁnite collection of polyhedra in m (typically 2 or
3) dimensions. Let X(A) be the set of all tilings of Euclidean space by congruent
copies, which we will call tiles, of the elements of (the ‘alphabet’) A. We label the
‘types’ of tiles by the elements of A. We endow X(A) with the metric
d(x, y) ≡sup
n
1
nmH[Bn(∂x), Bn(∂y)],
(1)
where Bn(∂x) denotes the intersection of two sets: the closed ball Bn of radius n
centered at the origin of the Euclidean space and the union ∂x of the boundaries ∂a
of all tiles a in x. mH is the Hausdorff metric on compact sets deﬁned as follows.
Given two compact subsets A and B of
Rm, mH[A, B] = max{ ˜d(A, B), ˜d(B, A)},
where
˜d(A, B) = sup
a∈A
inf
b∈B ∥a −b∥,
(2)
with ∥w∥denoting the usual Euclidean norm of w. Although the metric d depends
on the location of the origin, the topology induced by d is translation invariant.
A sequence of tilings converges in the metric d if and only if its restriction to
every compact subset of
Rm converges in mH. It is not hard to show [RaW] that
X(A) (which is automatically nonempty in our applications) is compact and that
the natural action of the connected Euclidean group GE on X(A), (g, x) ∈GE ×
X(A) →T gx ∈X(A), is continuous.
A ‘substitution tiling system’ is a closed subset Xφ ⊂X(A) satisfying some
additional conditions. To understand these conditions we ﬁrst need the notion of

‘patches’. A patch is a (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) subset of an element x ∈X(A); the set
of all patches for a given alphabet will be denoted by W. Next we need, as for the
pinwheels, an auxiliary ‘substitution function’ φ, a map from W to W, with the
following properties:
(i) There is some constant |φ| > 1 such that, for any g ∈GE and x ∈X,
φ[T gx] = T φ(g)x, where φ(g) is the conjugate of g by the similarity of
Euclidean space consisting of stretching about the origin by |φ|.
(ii) For each tile a ∈A and for each n
> 1, the union of the tiles in φna is
congruent to |φ|na, and these tiles meet full face to full face.
(iii) For each tile a ∈A, φa contains at least one tile of each type.
Condition (ii) is quite strong. It is satisﬁed by the pinwheel tilings only if we
add additional vertices at midpoints of the legs of length 2, creating boundaries of
4 edges. A similar (minor) adjustment is needed for other examples in this paper.
Even with such adjustments however, condition (ii) is not satisﬁed by the kite and
dart tilings [Gar], or those which mimic substitution tilings using so-called edge
markings [G-S, Moz, Ra3]. It is to handle such examples that we introduce the
general development of Section 3.
DEFINITION. For a given alphabet A of polyhedra and substitution function
φ the ‘substitution tiling system’ is the pair {Xφ, T }, where Xφ ⊂X(A) is the
compact subset of those tilings x with the property that every ﬁnite subpatch of x
is congruent to a subpatch of φna for some n > 0 and some a ∈A, and T is the
natural action of GE on Xφ. (For simplicity we often refer to Xφ as a substitution
tiling system.)
One planar example of a substitution tiling system is based on the pinwheel
substitution of Figure 2. A slight variant of the pinwheel is deﬁned by the 1-3-
√
10
right triangle and its reﬂection, and the substitution of Figure 4.
Two further special conditions which we will occasionally impose are:
(iv) A tiling in Xφ can only be tiled in one way by supertiles of level n, for any
n
> 1.
(v) For every a ∈A, there exists na > 0 such that φnaa contains a tile a′, of the
same type as a, and parallel to a.
We note here that with the convention that patches of the form φna are called
‘supertiles’ of ‘level’ n and ‘type’ a, it is easy to show by a diagonal argument that,

INVARIANT FOR SUBSTITUTION TILING SYSTEMS
25
for each n
> 0, each tiling x is tiled by supertiles of level n [Ra3]. A supertile of
level 4 for the pinwheel is shown in Figure 3.
Finally, let
Sε(x) = {y ∈Xφ: d(φny, φnx) < ε for all n
> 0, and d(φny, φnx) −→
n→∞0}.
We call such a family of sets a ‘local contracting direction (at x)’.
Our goal is to deﬁne a notion of equivalence for substitution tiling systems, and
an invariant for that equivalence. For the equivalence we use:
DEFINITION. The substitution tiling systems (Xφ1, T 1) and (Xφ2, T 2) are ‘equiv-
alent’ if there are subsets Yj ⊂Xφj , invariant under T j and of measure zero
with respect to all translation invariant Borel probability measures on Xφj , and
a one-to-one, onto, Borel bimeasureable map τ: Xφ1 −Y1 →Xφ2 −Y2, such that:
(a) τ ◦T 1 = T 2 ◦τ;
(b) for each x ∈X1 −Y1, ε > 0 and ε′ > 0, there exist ˜ε > 0 and ˜ε′ > 0 such that
τ[S ˜ε(x)] ⊂Sε(τx), and τ −1[S ˜ε′(τx)] ⊂Sε′(x).
We call such a map τ an ‘isomorphism’.
This notion of equivalence is stronger than simply intertwining the actions of
GE. This is appropriate; it has been known at least since [CoK] that substitution
subshifts show almost none of their richness if considered merely as subshifts. So
in classifying tilings that have a hierarchical structure we make some feature of
that hierarchical structure part of our notion of equivalence.
To deﬁne an invariant we extract information from the local contracting direc-
tions. Since the local contracting directions are preserved by equivalence, such
information is manifestly invariant. We deﬁne here the invariant. In later sections
we relate it to directly computable quantities (the Oj(x)) and demonstrate its use
in distinguishing between tiling dynamical systems.
Consider GE as the semidirect product of SO(m) with
Rm, with g = (r, t)
denoting a rotation r about the origin followed by a translation t. Then consider,
for any substitution tiling system Xφ and ε > 0:
Rε(x) = {r ∈SO(m): there exists t such that T (r,t)x ∈Sε(x)}.
Now let Oε(x) be the subgroup of SO(m) generated by Rε(x). The corollary to
Theorem 2 shows that the conjugacy class of Oε(x) is independent of x and ε
(when small enough) for substitution tiling systems satisfying (iv) and (v). The
conjugacy class of Oε(x) is therefore an invariant of the tiling dynamical system,
not just a feature of the individual tiling x.
2. The Group of Relative Orientations
The group Oε(x) generated by Rε(x) is not directly computable. In this section
we remedy this by constructing, for a substitution tiling system, a more easily

26

Figure 5.
computable group Oj(x) related to the relative orientations of the tiles in the single
tiling x. The group Oε(x) is then shown to be conjugate to Oj(x).
Given a tiling x and some tile a of type j in it, let Rj(a, x) ⊂SO(m) be the set
of relative orientations with respect to a of the tiles of type j in x; that is, Rj(a, x)
is the set of rotations of x which bring a tile of type j parallel to (the ﬁxed) a.
The group generated by Rj(a, x) is easily seen to be generated by the relative
orientations between all pairs of tiles of type j in x; in particular it is independent
of a, and we denote it by Oj(x). Furthermore,
LEMMA 1. If x′ has a tile a′ of type j parallel to the tile a in x, then Oj(x) =
Oj(x′). For any ˜x, Oj(˜x) is conjugate to Oj(x).
Proof. First note that Oj(x) is generated by the relative orientations between a
and all other tiles of type j in x. So consider the generator g of Oj(x) which is the
relative orientation of a tile c with respect to a in x. We will show that g ∈Oj(x′),
from which it follows that Oj(x) ⊂Oj(x′). By symmetry, we would then have
Oj(x′) ⊂Oj(x), and hence Oj(x) = Oj(x′).
From the deﬁnition of substitution tilings, the tiles a and c can be thought of
as belonging to some supertile A of level n (although not all of A need exist in
x). Since x′ is tiled by supertiles of level n, there is a supertile A′ of level n in x′
containing a pair of tiles, a′′ and c′′, which have the same positions relative to A′
as do a and c relative to A. See Figure 5.
Let g′ be the relative orientation of c′′ with respect to a′′. Then g = R−1g′R
where R is the relative orientation of A′ with respect to A. But R is then also the
relative orientation of a′′ with respect to a, which is the same as that of a′′ with
respect to a′, and R is thus an element of Oj(x′). But then g is an element of
Oj(x′), as claimed.

INVARIANT FOR SUBSTITUTION TILING SYSTEMS
27
If ˜x is any tiling at all, Oj(x) and Oj(˜x) are conjugate by an element of SO(m),
namely a rotation which makes a tile of type j in ˜x parallel to one in x.

Finally we consider the dependence of Oj(x) on j.
DEFINITION. Two subgroups of SO(m) are ‘c-equivalent’ if each is conjugate (in
SO(m)) to a subgroup of the other. (Note that in SO(2) c-equivalence is the same
as identity.)
LEMMA 2. For any tilings x, ˜x ∈Xφ and tile types j and k, Oj(x) is c-equivalent
to Ok(˜x).
Proof. By Lemma 1 it is sufﬁcient to show that Oj(x) and Ok(x) are c-equivalent.
Consider any two tiles a and b of type j in x, and let g be the relative orientation of
b with respect to a. After one substitution a and b give rise to tiles a′ and b′ of type
k in the tiling φx. The relative orientation of b′ with respect to a′ is again g, since g
takes each part of b onto the corresponding part of a. Applying this construction to
all the generators of Oj(x), we see that Oj(x) is a subgroup of Ok(φx). Similarly,
Ok(x) is a subgroup of Oj(φx). But Oj(x) and Ok(x) are conjugate to Oj(φx)
and Ok(φx), respectively, so Oj(x) and Ok(x) are conjugate to subgroups of each
other.

LEMMA 3. Assume φ satisﬁes (v). Then Oj(x) = Ok(x).
Proof. Let n = 5ana. Since the tilings deﬁned by φn are the same as those
deﬁned by φ we can, without loss of generality, assume n = 1, so that φx con-
tains tiles parallel to every tile of x. Then, by Lemma 1, Oj(x) = Oj(φx) and
Ok(x) = Ok(φx). But we have shown that Ok(x) ⊂Oj(φx) and Oj(x) ⊂Ok(φx),
so Oj(x) = Ok(x).

To summarize: From Lemmas 1 and 2 we can associate a subgroup of SO(m) to
any substitution tiling system, uniquely deﬁned up to c-equivalence. If the substi-
tution tiling system satisﬁes (v), Lemma 3 shows that the group is uniquely deﬁned
up to conjugacy.
Before we can use these groups as an invariant for equivalence of substitution
tiling systems we must refer to the relative orientations in a more fundamental
way. Our next goal is to connect this group with the invariant introduced at the
end of Section 1. The essential observation is that, if tilings x ̸= y agree in some
neighborhood of the origin in Euclidean space, then φx and φy will agree in a
larger neighborhood of the origin, so we typically expect d(φx, φy) < d(x, y).
We are thus led to a quantity introduced earlier. For each x in the substitution tiling
system Xφ and for each ε > 0, consider:
Sε(x) = {y ∈Xφ: d(φny, φnx) < ε for all n
> 0,
and d(φny, φnx) −→
n→∞0}.

THEOREM 1. Assume a substitution tiling system Xφ.
(a) Given any ε > 0 there exists N > 0 such that BN(∂y) = BN(∂x) implies
y ∈Sε(x).
(b) There exists ε > 0 such that, for every x ∈Xφ, y ∈Sε(x) and every tile a ∈x
that meets the origin, there is a tile a′ ∈y that exactly coincides with a.
Proof. (a) is immediate from the form of the metric. The proof of (b) requires
the following two lemmas.
LEMMA 4. For every N > 0 and every neighborhood U of the identity in GE
there exists ε > 0 with the following property: Let x, x′ ∈X(A) be any two tilings
with d(x, x′) < ε, and let a be a tile of x that is contained in BN. Then x′ contains
a tile a′ of the form T ga where g ∈U.
Proof. Let z > 0 be such that for each b ∈A some ball of diameter z lies in
the interior of b. Fix some δ ∈(0, z/3) and deﬁne the heart hδ(b) of b ∈A as
{p ∈b: ∥p −q∥> δ for all q ∈∂b}. By the corridor Cδ(x) of a tiling x we mean
the complement of ∪b∈xhδ(b). Let D be the largest of the diameters of all b ∈A.
Without loss of generality, we can assume N > D.
With this notation we note that if d(x, x′) < δ/(N + D) we have BN(∂x) ⊂
Cδ(x′) and BN(∂x′) ⊂Cδ(x). So if δ ∼0 each tile in x in BN is closely approxi-
mated by some tile in x′ and vice versa. In particular it now follows that for small
enough ε, if d(x, x′) < ε then the tiles a′ ∈x′ must be of the same type as the tiles
a ∈x they approximate, and in fact satisfy a′ = T ga with g ∈U.

LEMMA 5. For each N > 0 there is a neighborhood UN of the identity in GE
with the following property: If a is a tile in BN and g1 and g2 are distinct elements
of UN, then T g1a and T g2a overlap but are distinct. In particular, it is impossible
for T g1a and T g2a to both be tiles in the same tiling.
Proof. This follows from the continuity of the action of GE on tiles, and the fact
that polyhedra do not admit inﬁnitesimal symmetries.

We now return to the proof of Theorem 1. Pick N > D and let UN be as in
Lemma 5. Pick a smaller bounded neighborhood U ⊂UN of the identity of GE
with the property that (r, t) ∈U implies (r, |φ|t) ∈UN. Then pick ε small enough
that Lemma 4 applies.
Let a be a tile of x containing the origin. By Lemma 4 there is a tile a′ in y of
the form T ga with g = (r, t) ∈U ⊂GE. We will show that t ̸= 0 implies that, for
some n, d(φnx, φny) > ε, while t = 0, r ̸= 0 implies that limn→∞d(φnx, φny) ̸=
0. This will complete the proof.
Note that φna′ = T (r,|φ|nt)φna. If t ̸= 0, pick n such that (r, |φ|nt) is outside the
neighborhood U but in UN. Let ˜a be a tile of φna containing the origin. Then there
is a tile ˜a′ = T (r,|φ|nt)˜a in φny. But by Lemma 5 this means there cannot be a tile
of the form T g ˜a in y with g ∈U. By Lemma 4 this means that d(φnx, φny)
> ε.

INVARIANT FOR SUBSTITUTION TILING SYSTEMS
29
If t = 0 then φna′ = T (r,0)φna. If r ̸= 0, for every tile ˜a ∈φna containing the
origin there is a tile ˜a′ ∈φna′ overlapping it and with relative orientation r, which
implies that the distance between φnx and φny will not go to zero.

Recall the following quantity from Section 1
Rε(x) = {r ∈SO(m): there exists t such that T (r,t)x ∈Sε(x)}.
(4)
Let Oε(x) be the group generated by Rε(x). Assuming ε small enough for Theorem
1(b), we see that every r ∈Rε(x) is the relative orientation of a tile of x with
respect to a corresponding tile of x near the origin. By Theorem 1(a), if C is a
region of x containing BN, and if C′ is any region of x congruent to C, then Rε(x)
includes the relative orientation of C′ to C.
Consider the following property.
PROPERTY F. The subset of tilings x, for which every ﬁxed ﬁnite ball B of Euclid-
ean space is contained in some supertile of ﬁnite level in x, is of full measure for
every translation invariant measure on Xφ.
We will prove that Property F holds for a large class of interesting systems, at
least those satisfying condition (iv). This assumption, which implies that φ is a
homeomorphism on Xφ, is satisﬁed by all known nonperiodic examples. In fact it
is automatically true for a system that contains nonperiodic tilings and in which the
tiles only appear in ﬁnitely many orientations in any tiling [Sol].
If a tiling contains two or more regions each tiled by supertiles of level n for all
n
> 0, we call these regions supertiles of inﬁnite level. Recall that any tiling is tiled
by supertiles of any ﬁnite level n. If a ball in a tiling x fails to lie in any supertile
of any level n, then x is tiled by two or more supertiles of inﬁnite level, with the
offending ball straddling a boundary. (One can construct a pinwheel tiling with
two supertiles of inﬁnite level as follows. Consider the rectangle consisting of two
supertiles of level n−1 in the middle of a supertile of level n. For each n
> 1 orient
such a rectangle with its center at the origin and its diagonal on the x-axis, and ﬁll
out the rest of a (non-pinwheel) tiling xn by periodic extension. By compactness
this sequence has a convergent subsequence, which will be a pinwheel tiling and
which will consist of two supertiles of inﬁnite level.)
We now use the above to prove:
LEMMA 6. For a substitution tiling system satisfying (iv), let S be the set of tilings
in which some ball does not lie within a supertile of any level n. S has zero measure
with respect to any translation invariant measure on Xφ.
Proof. We only give the proof for dimension m = 2. Note ﬁrst that the boundary
of a supertile of inﬁnite level must be either a line, or have a single vertex, since
it is tiled by supertiles of all levels and therefore cannot contain a ﬁnite edge.

30
CHARLES RADIN AND LORENZO SADUN
Furthermore, for a given substitution system there is a constant K such that no
tiling in it contains more than K vertices of supertiles of inﬁnite level; speciﬁcally,
one can take K = 2π/p where p is the smallest angle of any of the vertices of the
tiles.
Next we ﬁx some orthogonal coordinate system in the plane and decompose S
into disjoint subsets as follows. Let C = [0, 1)×[0, 1) be the ‘half open’ unit edge
square in
R2. Let Ct be the translate of C by the vector t. Let S′ be the subset of S
consisting of tilings containing vertices of supertiles of inﬁnite level. For x ∈S′ we
choose a vertex V (x) by lexicographic order: we choose that vertex which in the
given coordinate system has the largest ﬁrst coordinate; if there is more than one
with that coordinate we choose the one with the largest second coordinate. Then
we decompose S′ = S
t∈Z2 S′(t), where x ∈S′ ∩S′(t) if V (x) ∈Ct. It is easy to
see that each S′(t) is measurable, and that they are translates of one another so they
must have zero measure with respect to any translation invariant measure.
The tilings x ∈S −S′ contain two supertiles of inﬁnite level, each occupying a
half plane. Next we decompose S−S′ = ∪j,k∈Z∪σj ∪σ ′
k where x ∈S−S′∩σj if the
boundary between the supertiles of inﬁnite level crosses the ﬁrst axis in [j, j + 1),
and x ∈S−S′∩σ ′
k if the boundary between the supertiles of inﬁnite level is parallel
to the ﬁrst axis and crosses the second axis in [k, k + 1). Note that all sets σj are
translates of one another, and all sets σ ′
k are translates of one another, so S −S′ has
zero measure with respect to any translation invariant measure.

THEOREM 2. For any substitution tiling system Xφ satisfying (iv), there exists
ε0 > 0 such that for all ε ∈(0, ε0), and for almost every tiling x ∈Xφ, Oε(x)
is c-equivalent to Oj(x) for some (and therefore any) j. Up to conjugacy, Oj(x)
is independent of x. Furthermore, if φ satisﬁes (v) then Oε(x) = Oj(x) for some
(and therefore any) j.
Proof. From Theorem 1(b) it follows that, for small ε, Oε(x) is contained in
Oj(x), where j is the type of any of the tiles of x which meet the origin. On the
other hand, let N correspond to ε in Theorem 1(a). By Lemma 6, for almost every x
there is some n such that the tiles which intersect BN are contained in some super-
tile b of level n in x. Let k be the type of b. It follows from Theorem 1(a) that Ok(x′)
is a subgroup of Oε(x), where x′ = φ−nx. But Ok(x′) and Oj(x) are c-equivalent,
so Oj(x) is conjugate to a subgroup of Ok(x′), and therefore is conjugate to a
subgroup of Oε(x). So Oj(x) and Oε(x) are c-equivalent. By Lemma 1, Oj(x) is,
up to conjugacy, independent of x. If φ satisﬁes (v), then Ok(x′) = Ok(x) = Oj(x).
Since Oj(x) = Ok(x′) ⊂Oε(x) ⊂Oj(x), Oε(x) = Oj(x).

COROLLARY 1.
For each substitution tiling system satisfying (iv) the group
Oε(x) is uniquely deﬁned up to c-equivalence, for almost all tilings x, and all small
enough ε, thus the c-equivalence class of the group is an invariant for equivalence.
Furthermore, among substitution tiling systems also satisfying (v), the conjugacy
class of this subgroup of SO(m) is an invariant for equivalence.

3. Abstract Substitution Systems
In going from Lemma 2 to Theorem 2 we see that we can associate with each sub-
stitution tiling system a c-equivalence class of subgroups of SO(m) in a reasonably
fundamental way. We are now ready to relax the hypotheses.
DEFINITION. A ‘substitution (dynamical) system’ is a quadruple (X, T, φ, |φ|)
consisting of a compact metric space X on which there is a continuous action
T : (g, x) ∈GE × X →T gx ∈X of GE and a homeomorphism φ: X →X
such that φ[T gx] = T φ(g)x for all x, where φ(g) is the conjugate of g by the
similarity of Euclidean space consisting of stretching about the origin by |φ| > 1.
Substitution tiling systems are special cases of substitution systems. The map φ
is not intrinsic to the substitution tiling system (Xφ, T ) since, for tiling systems, φ
and φk lead to the same set of tilings; so equivalence of such systems should not
be required to intertwine the actions of the maps φ. The objects Sε(x), Rε(x) and
Oε(x) are well-deﬁned in our abstract setting. Motivated by the last section, we use
the following notion of equivalence.
DEFINITION. The substitution systems (X1, T 1, φ1, |φ1|) and (X2, T 2, φ2, |φ2|)
are ‘equivalent’ if there are subsets Yj ⊂Xj, invariant under T j and of measure
zero with respect to all translation invariant Borel probability measures on Xφj , and
a one-to-one, onto, Borel bimeasureable ‘isomorphism’ τ: X1−Y1 →X2−Y2, such
that τ ◦T 1 = T 2 ◦τ. Furthermore, τ must respect the ‘local contracting directions’
Sε(x). Respecting the local contracting directions means that, for each x ∈X1−Y1,
ε > 0 and ε′ > 0, there exist ˜ε > 0 and ˜ε′ > 0 such that τ[S ˜ε(x)] ⊂Sε(τx), and
τ −1[S ˜ε′(τx)] ⊂Sε′(x).
It is easy to see that for the special case of substitution tiling systems this notion
of equivalence reduces to that previously deﬁned. We will now introduce an invari-
ant for equivalence which reduces to the class of subgroups of SO(m) we found for
substitution tiling systems. We note that this allows us to generalize our discussion
of substitution tiling systems to include tiling systems which do not quite ﬁt the
conditions of Section 2. In particular, our analysis applies to the various versions
of Penrose tilings of the plane, such as the kite and dart tilings, both the substitution
version and the version with edge markings [Gar, Ra3], and to the various tilings
discussed in [G-S, Moz].
We will need to introduce a few more deﬁnitions. Given two subgroups G1 and
G2 of SO(m) we write G1 ≺G2 if G1 is conjugate (by an element of SO(m))
to a subgroup of G2. The binary relation ≺lifts in an obvious way to a partial
ordering on the set of c-equivalence classes. We denote by ‘lower bound’ to a set ˜S
of subgroups of SO(m) any c-equivalence class of groups G each of which satisﬁes
G ≺S for all S ∈˜S. It is almost immediate that Oε(x) ≺Oε′(x) if ε < ε′. For each
x ∈X we deﬁne ˆO(x) as the set of all lower bounds of the family {Oε(x): ε > 0};
it is nonempty since it contains {e}. Note that the set ˆO(x) is an invariant for substi-

tution systems – if τ is an isomorphism then ˆO(τx) = ˆO(x) for almost every x. For
substitution tiling systems, the sets ˆO(x) have unique greatest elements which are
constant for almost every x with respect to every translation invariant measure. In
the latter case, where ˆO(x) has an almost everywhere constant greatest element, we
denote this greatest element by [O](X). Note that [O](X) is a c-equivalence class,
unlike Oε(x), which is a speciﬁc group. We have thus generalized the analysis of
substitution tiling systems to the more general setting.
As with substitution tiling systems, we can avoid the use of c-equivalence classes
for systems with a special property.
PROPERTY P. For almost every x there exists an ε > 0 such that, if 0 < ε′ < ε,
then Oε′(x) = Oε(x).
Note that, by Theorem 2, any substitution tiling system that satisﬁes (v) also
satisﬁes Property P. If a substitution system satisﬁes Property P, we can deﬁne
O(x) to be Oε(x) for ε sufﬁciently small. If the conjugacy class of O(x) is almost
everywhere constant, we deﬁne [O]0(X) to be that conjugacy class. The previously
deﬁned [O](X) is, of course, the c-equivalence class of [O]0(X).
THEOREM 3. Suppose (X1, T 1, φ1, |φ1|) and (X2, T 2, φ2, |φ2|) are equivalent
substitution systems, with the notation of the deﬁnition. Then if (X1, T 1, φ1, |φ1|)
satisﬁes Property P so does (X2, T 2, φ2, |φ2|). Furthermore, for almost every x ∈
X1, O(τx) = O(x). In particular, if O(x) is almost everywhere constant up to con-
jugacy then O(τx) is almost everywhere constant up to conjugacy and [O]0(X2) =
[O]0(X1).
Proof. Let x be a generic point of X1. Since (X1, T 1, φ1, |φ1|) has Property P
we can ﬁnd ε0 > 0 such that, for 0 < ε < ε0, Oε(x) = Oε0(x) = O(x). From the
equivalence we can ﬁnd ˜ε such that O˜ε(τx) ⊂Oε0(x). Now let ε′
0 = ˜ε. We will
show that, for any 0 < ε′
 ε′
0, Oε′(τx) = Oϵ′
0(τx) = O(x). From this it will
follow that (X′, φ′) has Property P and that O(τx) = O(x).
Fix any 0 < ε′
 ε′
0. Since τ is an isomorphism there exists ˜ε′ > 0 such
that O˜ε′(x) ⊂Oε′(τx). But Oε′(τx) ⊂Oϵ′
0(τx) ⊂Oε0(x). If O˜ε′(x) = Oε0(x)
then all the inclusions must be equalities, and we are done. So it sufﬁces to show
O˜ε′(x) = Oε0(x). If ˜ε′
 ε0 this follows from the deﬁnition of ε0. But if ˜ε′ > ε0
then Oε0(x) ⊂O ˜ε′(x), so O˜ε′(x) = Oε0(x).

4. Examples and Analysis of the Invariant
For pinwheel [O]0(Xφp) is the group generated by rotations by π/2 and 2
arctan ( 1
2); for the variant of pinwheel [O]0(Xφv) is the group generated by rotations
by π/2 and 2 arctan( 1
3) [RaS]. It is clear that these are distinct, so the substitution
tiling systems are not equivalent.
Rotations appear in more interesting ways in 3-dimensional tilings, for example
the quaquaversal and dite and kart substitution tiling systems, deﬁned in [CoR] and

INVARIANT FOR SUBSTITUTION TILING SYSTEMS
33
[RaS] respectively. These systems both satisfy (v) and therefore Property P. Let Rθ
x
be a rotation about the x axis by an angle θ, with similar notation for other axes.
If we denote by G(p, q) the subgroup of SO(3) generated by R2π/p
x
and R2π/q
y
, it
can be shown [CoR, RaS] that [O]0(Xφq) is the conjugacy class of G(6, 4) for the
quaquaversal tilings and [O]0(Xφd&k) is the conjugacy class of G(10, 4) for the dite
and kart tilings. We shall see that G(6, 4) and G(10, 4) are not conjugate (indeed
not even c-equivalent) by using the following obvious fact: if the groups G and G′
are conjugate (or c-equivalent) and one of them has an element of order m (ﬁnite
or inﬁnite) then the other must have an element of order m.
Structure Theorem for G(p,q) [RaS]
(a) If p, q
> 3 are odd, then G(p, q) is isomorphic to the free product
Zp ∗
Zq = ⟨α, β: αp, βq⟩.
(5)
(b) If p
> 4 is even and q
> 3 is odd, then G(p, q) has the presentation
⟨α, β: αp, βq, (αp/2β)2⟩.
(6)
(c) If p
> 4 is even and q = 2s, s
> 3 odd, then G(p, q) has the presentation
⟨α, β: αp, βq, (αp/2β)2, (αβs)2⟩.
(7)
(d) If 4 divides both p and q, then G(p, q) = G([p, q], 4), where [p, q] denotes
the least common multiple of p and q.
(e) If 4 divides m, then G(m, 4) has the presentation
⟨α, β, : αm, β4, (αm/2β)2, (αβ2)2, (αm/4b)3⟩.
(8)
In cases (a), (b) and (c), the isomorphism between the abstract presentation and
G(p, q) is given by α 7→R2π/p
x
, β 7→R2π/q
y
. In case (e) the isomorphism is
similar.
THEOREM 4. (a) If 4 does not divide both p and q then the orders of elements of
ﬁnite order in G(p, q) are {factors of p}∪{factors of q}; (b) If 4 divides both p and
q then the orders of elements of ﬁnite order in G(p, q) are {factors of [p, q]}∪{3}.
COROLLARY 2. If p and q are not both divisible by 4, and p′ is not a factor of p
or q, then G(p, q) and G(p′, q′) are not c-equivalent.
COROLLARY 3. The quaquaversal and dite and kart systems are not equivalent.
Proof of the theorem. (a)
Assume g ∈G(p, q) has ﬁnite order ̸= 1. We
know g can be expressed in one of the forms g = Aa1Bb1Aa2 . . . Aan+1, g =
Bb1Aa1Bb2 . . . Bbn+1, g = Bb1Aa1Bb2 . . . Aan or g = Aa1Bb1Aa2 . . . Bbn, with all

34
CHARLES RADIN AND LORENZO SADUN
0 < aj < p, 0 < bj < q and n
> 1. Within the class of g′ ∈G(p, q)
which are conjugate to g with respect to G(p, q), we assume that n is minimal.
Assume n
> 2; we will obtain a contradiction. Since one could conjugate with
Aa1, the form Aa1Bb1Aa2 . . . Aan can be exchanged for Bb1Aa2 . . . Aan and since
one could conjugate with Bb1, the form Bb1Aa1Bb2 . . . Bbn can be exchanged for
Aa1Bb2 . . . Bbn, and the form Bb1Aa1Bb2 . . . Aan for Aa1Bb1Aa2 . . . Bbn. So we as-
sume that the form is Aa1Bb1Aa2 . . . Bbn. If aj = p/2 (resp. bj = q/2) for any j
then we could use the relation Ap/2Bb = B−bAp/2 (resp. Bq/2Aa = A−aBq/2) to
reduce the value of n; thus these values of aj (or bj) cannot occur. But then, by
the structure theorem, g has inﬁnite order, which is a contradiction. Thus n must
equal 1, and g can be assumed to be of the form Aa1, Bb1 or Aa1Bb1. Consider-
ing Aa1Bb1Aa1Bb1 . . . Aa1Bb1, the only way Aa1Bb1 could have ﬁnite order is if
a1 = p/2 or b1 = q/2, in which case g has order 2, and 2 is a factor of p or q.
Finally, the elements Aa1 can have as orders any factor of p and the elements Bb1
can have as orders any factor of q.
(b) If p and q are divisible by 4 then G(p, q) = G([p, q], 4), so we consider
G(m, 4) with m divisible by 4. Using the presentation (8), we can put any g ∈
G(m, 4) in the form WST a1ST a2 . . . ST anE with S = R2π/4
y
, T = R2π/m
x
, n
> 0,
aj ̸= km/4 and with both W and E in the cube group G(4, 4). Assume g has
ﬁnite order ̸= 1 and that in its conjugacy class (which of course all have the same
order), the smallest value of n in the above representation is
> 2. (We will obtain a
contradiction to this.) By conjugation we eliminate W from g.
Now G(4, 4) can be partitioned: G(4, 4) = H1∪H1S∪H1SU, where U = R2π/4
x
and H1 is the 8 element subgroup generated by S2 and U. In detail,
H1 = {1, U, U 2, U 3, S2, S2U, S2U 2, S2U 3}.
(9)
Some power of g equals the identity element
(ST a1ST a2 . . . ST anE)(ST a1ST a2 . . . ST anE)(. . .) = e.
(10)
We consider the three cases: (i) E ∈H1; (ii) E ∈H1SU; (iii) E ∈H1S.
(i) The factor E in (10) is of the form (S2)aU b with a = 0, 1 and b = 0, 1, 2, 3.
We alter (10) to
[ST a1ST a2 . . . ST anU (−1)ab(S2)a] . . .
×[ST a1ST a2 . . . ST anU (−1)ab(S2)a][. . .] = e,
(11)
or
[ST a1ST a2 . . . ST [an+(−1)abm/4](S2a)]
×[ST a1ST a2 . . . ST [an+(−1)abm/4](S2a)] . . . = e,
(12)
and we know [RaS] this cannot be the case. So we cannot have E ∈H1.

INVARIANT FOR SUBSTITUTION TILING SYSTEMS
35
(ii) E is now of the form (S2)aU bSU with a = 0, 1 and b = 0, 1, 2, 3. We now
alter (10) to
ST a1ST a2 . . . ST [an+(−1)abm/4](S2)aSUST a1ST a2 . . .
. . . ST anE · · · = e.
(13)
Using SUS = USU, (13) becomes
ST a1ST a2 . . . ST [an+(−1)a(b+1)m/4]S2aST a1+m/4ST a2 . . .
. . . ST [an+(−1)a(b+1)m/4]S2aSU · · · = e.
(14)
Again, we know [RaS] this cannot be the case. So we cannot have E ∈H1SU.
(iii) We cannot have E ∈H1S and n
> 2. For if we represent conjugacy by ∼=
g ∼= ST a1ST a2 . . . ST anE
= ST a1ST a2 . . . ST an(S2)aU bS
∼= T a1ST a2 . . . ST [an+(−1)abm/4](S2)a+1
∼= ST a2 . . . ST [an+(−1)abm/4+(−1)a+1a1](S2)a+1,
(15)
and g is conjugate to a word with smaller n.
Thus n = 0 or n = 1. n = 0 means g ∈G(4, 4), and these have orders
1, 2, 3, 4. n = 1 means g is of the form ST a1E where a1 ̸= km/4 and E ∈G(4, 4).
We again consider the three cosets to which E may belong. As before we see that
cases (i) and (ii) lead to inﬁnite order for g. But in case (iii) g is conjugate to
T a1(S2)aU bS2 ∼= T c(S2)d, which can have as orders the factors of m.

5. Conclusion
We have been concerned with substitution tilings of Euclidean spaces, and have
deﬁned an invariant for them related to the group generated by the relative orien-
tations of the tiles in a tiling. This feature is captured in an intrinsic way by means
of a contractive behavior of the substitution. It is unrelated to other features of
tiling systems, such as their topology, and we introduce the notion of substitution
dynamical system to emphasize the features associated with the invariant.
To distinguish examples, for instance to distinguish the quaquaversal tilings
from the dite and kart tilings, requires consideration of 2-generator subgroups of
SO(3), in particular the orders of elements of such subgroups, which we analyze.
