"To Play
Philosophically"
At a little before ten o'clock the drum roll began, first dis-
tant and then ever louder as the thousands that were gather-
ing to see a king die wound their way through the choked
streets of London to the palace of Whitehall. It was January
30, 1649. The weather was exceedingly cold, the sky gray
with scattered patches of sunshine, the frost so sharp that
great chunks of ice floating in the river Thames clogged the
arches of London Bridge.
The previous day 59 judges had signed the death war-
rant of King Charles I, many of them badgered and bullied
by the rebel leader Oliver Cromwell, who was about to
assume the title of Lord Protector and rule as a king in
everything but name. It was Cromwell and his
Roundheads, who cut their hair short in defiance of the
wigged nobility and practiced the Puritan religion, who
most wanted the king to die. They had fought Charles and
his supporters, many of whom were sympathetic to the
outlawed Catholic religion, ever since 1642, when civil war
erupted in the north of England and spread across the land.

"To Play Philosophically"
Now the leader of the defeated
forces had to pay.
Fearing that the cold would
cause him to shiver and give his
enemies the false impression that
he was afraid, Charles donned
two sets of underclothes before
putting on his best suit. Flanked
by the Bishop of London and his
personal attendant, Herbert, the
king stepped out of the palace of
St. James and headed through the
surrounding park toward White-
hall and the scaffold, whose con-
struction the night before had dis-
turbed his sleep. He walked so fast
between the double line of sol-
diers guarding the way that his
escorts could barely keep pace.
Once at Whitehall he ate a little bread and drank some
wine.
At two o'clock there was a break in the clouds. The
crowd, which was kept at a distance by several rows of sol-
diers, could just make out figures passing rapidly behind the
windows of the banquet hall. Suddenly the king emerged
by stepping through a long window and onto the scaffold.
He knelt down and laid his head upon the wooden block.
The masked executioner tucked the long royal hair beneath
a cap, then stepped back while the prisoner spent a
few minutes in prayer. When he was finished, the king
stretched out his arms to signal that he was ready to meet
his God, and the ax descended in a swift arc. The assistant
executioner lifted the severed head for all to see and
exclaimed, "Behold, the head of a traitor!"
King Charles I was
beheaded in 1649 after
his forces were defeated
by those of Oliver
Cromwell in a bloody civil
war that raged across
England for seven years.

Instead of the expected cheer, a long, collective moan
issued from the crowd. Fearing trouble, Cromwell ordered
the streets cleared and his mounted soldiers sprang into
action. The spectators panicked and many were trampled in
the frenzy, creating even greater fear of the army and the
austere leader of the new government.
Woolsthorpe Manor, a gray stone house situated in
England's county of Lincoln, was a lonely place seven years
before the king's death as civil war spread and Christmas
drew near. Its only inhabitants were a young widow named
Hannah Newton and her servant. Hannah's husband Isaac, a
yeoman, or prosperous farmer, had died in October and was
buried in the churchyard of the village of Colsterworth just
across the river Witham, which was visible from the upstairs
bedrooms. Isaac and Hannah had been married only five
months before he had taken ill. When he failed to get bet-
ter, a lawyer was summoned and a will drawn up. Most of
his possessions, including 100 acres of land, the manor
house, livestock, grain, and household furnishings, were left
to Hannah. Like his father before him, Isaac Newton was
illiterate, so he signed the document with the traditional
"X." No mention was made of the unborn child Hannah
was carrying.
Hannah went into labor sometime on December 24,
1642. It was the time of the full moon, and the baby was
born an hour or two after midnight on Christmas morning.
He was so frail that two women who attended Hannah were
sent to obtain some medicine from a neighbor. Instead of
hurrying, they sat down to rest on the way, thinking the
child would already be dead. In the years to come Hannah
would tell her son that he was so little when he was born
that he would have fit into a quart pot. Moreover, he was
too weak to hold his head upright for feeding and breath-
ing. A special collar was fitted to his small neck to support
his head; for a long time he remained very much below the
size of children his own age.

"To Play Philosophically'
One week later, mother and child were driven to the
family church at Colsterworth, where relatives and friends
gathered to see the infant baptized. The pastor dutifully
recorded the event in the parish register: "Isaac son of Isaac
and Hannah Newton baptized Jan. 1, [1643]."
Isaac was still a toddler when his mother caught the eye
of an elderly widower named Barnabas Smith, Rector of
North Witham, a hamlet little more than a mile southeast
of Woolsthorpe. Smith held bachelor's and master's degrees
from Oxford University and was very wealthy, thanks to a
substantial inheritance from his father. Before Hannah
would accept the clergyman's proposal of marriage, she
insisted that he make a gift of some property to her son and
remodel Woolsthorpe Manor, which Isaac was expected to
occupy one day as a gentleman farmer. Smith agreed and
the marriage took place in January 1646, a month after
Isaac's third birthday.
For reasons unknown, it was decided that Isaac should
remain at Woolsthorpe in the care of his maternal grand-

Manor, by William
Stukeley, his physician,
friend, and first
biographer.

mother, Margery Ayscough. The devastated child, who had
never set eyes on his father, was suddenly parted from his
mother. As he grew older, he discovered how agonizingly
close she remained; by climbing a tree he could view the
steeple of North Witham's church in the distance. There
was Hannah, but there too was the mysterious stranger who
had "stolen" her away. The loss ate at him like an emotional
cancer. As a teenager, while undergoing a period of intense
religious awareness, Isaac compiled a list of "sins" he had
committed over the years. Most were harmless, but number
13 is quite revealing: "Threatening my father and mother
Smith to burn them and the house over them." The next
entry is equally disturbing: "Wishing death and hoping it to
some." The abandoned son not only possessed a volatile
temper, but he nursed grudges and would wait years, if need
be, to gain revenge on those he believed had wronged him.
Besides his absent parents, the unstated "some" for
whom Isaac wished death may have included his two half
sisters and his half brother, all fathered by Smith while in his
late 60s. Mary, Hannah, and Benjamin were additional rivals
for his mother's attention. When Smith finally died in 1653,
Hannah, now a very wealthy widow, returned to
Woolsthorpe with the three children in tow. By this time
Isaac, who was 11, had long since learned to insulate himself
from human contact by withdrawing into the hidden re-
cesses of his mind.
Hannah was determined that Isaac, unlike his father,
should not grow up unlettered. During her absence, he was
enrolled in a village school to which he walked back and
forth each day. Then, a year after Hannah returned to
Woolsthorpe, the 12-year-old youth entered King's School
at Grantham, a market town some seven miles distant.
Latin and Greek were the languages of instruction, and
it was during this period that the foundations of young
Newton's classical education were laid. Bible studies were
12

"To Play Philosophically'
also an important part of the curriculum, and Isaac became
familiar with Hebrew script. Though grammar and litera-
ture were the main focus, students also received a limited
amount of instruction in arithmetic. Isaac may have been
introduced to geometry during this period as well, but, if
so, there is no record of it in his surviving notebooks.
Arrangements were made for the youth to board in the
home of Mr. Clark, the local apothecary, or pharmacist,
whose wife was a close friend of Isaac's mother. The Clarks
lived in the middle of Grantham on High Street and by all
accounts gave their young boarder as much freedom as
good judgment would allow. According to Dr. William
Stukeley, a Grantham native whom Newton befriended
years later when the two were living in London, "everyone
that knew Sir Isaac recounts the pregnancy of his parts
[mental ability] when a boy, his strange inventions and
extraordinary inclination for mechanics." Instead of playing
with the other boys after school, he "busied himself in
making knicknacks and wood models in many kinds: for
which purpose he had got little saws, hatchets, hammers
and a whole shop of tools, which he would use with great
dexterity."
Isaac visited the construction site of a windmill and was
inspired to build a working model of his own. When it was
finished, a mouse he called the "miller" was placed inside
and supplied with a ration of corn. In reaching for the food,
the miller set a wheel in motion, which in turn propelled
the mill.
The lad was equally fascinated by kites, which he fash-
ioned from paper in various shapes to determine the designs
best suited for sustained flight. He also made lanterns from
crumpled paper and lit them with candles while walking to
school on dark winter mornings. These he sometimes tied
to the tails of his kites at night, frightening the country
people who mistook them for passing comets.
13

Isaac Newton
When Newton was / 2,
he was enrolled in the
King's School at Gran-
tham. He spent about
four years at this school,
staying at the home of
the local pharmacist
Smaller and physically weaker than most of his school-
mates, Isaac attempted to teach them "to play philosophi-
cally [scientifically]," in Stukeley's words. When the Lord
Protector Oliver Cromwell died in September 1658, a great
storm swept over England, giving rise to the superstition
that it was the devil riding the whirlwind to claim his lost
soul. Taking advantage of a rare opportunity, Isaac entered
into a competition with several of the more athletic youths
to see who could jump the farthest. By carefully timing the
gusts of wind, he outleaped the other boys, much to their
surprise and embarrassment. Many years later, Newton
remarked to a relative that this was one of his first experi-
ments.
This early interest in the force of moving air was
matched by a deep fascination with time. Even before Isaac
entered King's School, he had undertaken a study of the
sun's motion, tracking its path across the yard, walls, and
slate roof of Woolsthorpe Manor. Using a sharp instrument,
14

"To Play Philosophically'
he carved two sundials next to a window on the building's
south face. He did the same on the side of the Clark house
in Grantham, marking the hours and half hours with pegs.
According to Stukeley, "anybody knew what o'clock it was
by Isaac's dial, as they ordinarily called it." Later in life, it
would be said of Newton that he could tell what time it
was by glimpsing the positions of shadows on his study
walls, and that these observations were as accurate as the
dials of his pocket watch.
The most frequently mentioned of his many mechani-
cal models was his water clock, constructed from a wooden
box given to him by Mr. Clark's brother-in-law. It stood
four feet high and had a dial at the top with the numbers of
the hours. It was turned by a piece of wood, which alter-
nately rose and fell according to the rhythmic dripping of
water. It was kept in the room where he lived and was
occasionally checked by the Clarks to see what hour it was.
Like Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin, Isaac
Newton was not simply an aimless childhood tinkerer but a
tinkerer playing with ideas and mechanisms.
Isaac lived in the Clarks' attic, where he covered the
walls with charcoal sketches he drew from prints as well as
from life. These included the beheaded King Charles I,
who had died when Newton was not yet seven; the poet
and clergyman John Donne; and the headmaster of King's
School, Henry Stokes. Birds, beasts, ships, and mathemati-
cal schemes filled the remaining space, together with verses
attributed to the youth himself.
There is good reason to believe that Isaac also spent
many hours in the company of his landlord as the apothe-
cary mixed medicines for Grantham's citizens. One of many
books that captured Isaac's attention was The Mysteries of
Nature and Art by John Bate, the third edition of which was
published in 1654, when Isaac was 11. Bate's recipes for
mixing "paints" and treating common ailments found their
15

way into the boy's early notebooks, as did information on
diseases and their cures copied from Francis Gregory's cata-
log titled Nomenclatura (Names). Among the least appetizing
is a recipe for an abscess: "Drink twice or thrice a day a
small portion of mint and wormwood and 300 millipedes
well beaten (with their heads pulled off) suspended in 4 gal-
lons of ale in fermentation."
In light of his interest in books and all things mechani-
cal, one would have expected Isaac to do well in his studies,
but that was not the case. Henry Stokes put him in the low-
est form, or class, where he ranked second to last out of
more than 80 students. Newton himself later admitted that
he "continued very negligent" in his studies at King's
School.
Events took a radical turn one morning as Isaac was
walking to class. The boy ranked just above him kicked him
in the stomach, which provoked thoughts of revenge. When
school was over for the day, Isaac challenged his classmate to
a fight, and they went into the nearby churchyard to settle
their differences. Though smaller than his opponent, Isaac
fought with greater determination, beating him until he
declared that he would fight no more. He then rubbed the
defeated boy's face against the church wall for good mea-
sure. Still this was not enough. Isaac began applying himself
to his studies and soon rose to become the top student in
the school.
The Grantham years were among the happiest in
Newton's life, but Hannah had decided that they must soon
come to an end. Her son was about 15 when she informed
Master Stokes that Isaac must return to Woolsthorpe to
begin learning the ways of a respected landowner.
Stokes was appalled. Isaac had convinced the head-
master that his talents were too great to be wasted in the
isolated countryside of Lincolnshire. Nor could Isaac see
himself as one of the simple folk who were his people, for
16

"To Play Philosophically'
he had gradually ceased to share their lives. To return to the
family farm would mean a life of mental boredom that
could easily lead to frustration and bitterness.
Hannah was adamant, thus setting the stage for a con-
flict of wills. Isaac returned home and later recorded some
of his acts of defiance in the list of his sins compiled a few
years later. He was "peevish with my mother" and refused
to go into the fields at her command. He allowed the sheep
to stray onto the property of a neighbor, causing damages
that Hannah had to pay for in court. Stukeley learned that
"His chief delight was to sit under a tree, with a book in his
hands, or to busy himself with his knife in cutting wood for
models of something or other that struck his fancy, or he
would go to a running stream, and make little millwheels to
put into the water." Not only did the sheep stray and the
wheat go unplanted, but the adolescent often forgot to
return home for meals, a character trait that would resurface
in the adult Newton.
Frustrated and annoyed, Hannah sought to change
Isaac's behavior by placing him under the supervision of an
elderly servant. Together they went to Grantham on
Saturday mornings to purchase the needed supplies for the
farm and to sell the crops raised in the Woolsthorpe fields.
But as soon as they arrived, Isaac would head for his old
room above the apothecary shop, where he passed the day
reading books stored there by his former landlord's brother
Joseph Clark, an assistant teacher at King's School. On
other occasions he simply picked out a comfortable spot
under a roadside hedge where he read until the servant col-
lected him on the way home. "No doubt," Stukeley
observed, "the man [complained] of this to his mother." No
doubt indeed!
Clearly Isaac was living among the creations of his own
mind. In many ways they were more real to him than any-
thing he encountered in the external world. Henry Stokes,
17

Isaac Newton
who was keeping close track of his star pupil, finally decided
to intercede on Isaac's behalf. He visited Hannah at
Woolsthorpe and told her what a great loss it was to bury
such a promising intellect on the family farm. "The only
way whereby he could preserve or raise his fortune must be
by fitting him for the university." The headmaster even
offered to forego the annual forty shilling fee required of all
pupils born more than a mile from Grantham, no small sac-
rifice for a man of modest means.
Hannah could be almost as difficult to budge as her old-
est son, forcing Stokes to argue his case several times. In her
defense it must be remembered that her careful plans for
Isaac were falling to pieces, and with them a mother's
dreams. To a woman who was next to illiterate, land was the
only thing that mattered. She finally turned to her trusted
brother William Ayscough for advice. To her surprise,
William sided with Stokes, agreeing that Isaac should return
to school. Her options closed, Hannah reluctantly gave her
consent. For better or for worse, her son would go on to
the university.
Isaac's return to Grantham was welcomed by many,
including Catherine Storer, Clark's stepdaughter. She and
her two brothers, Arthur and Edward, had grown close to
Isaac while living under the same roof on High Street. As an
old woman in her 80s, she was interviewed regarding her
famous playmate whom she described as "a sober, silent,
thinking lad never known to play with the boys at their silly
amusements." Even more intriguing is her recollection of a
romantic attachment to Newton: "Being brought up
together, tis said that he entertained a love for her, nor does
she deny it. But ... it was incompatible with his fortunes to
marry, perhaps his studies too."
What form those studies took during Isaac's final
months of preparation before departing for Cambridge is
unknown. Because Latin was the language of scholars,
18

"To Play Philosophically'
Stokes almost certainly grilled his greatest pupil in the clas-
sics one last time. Works by the ancient poets Pindar and
Ovid survive from Newton's personal library; both are
inscribed "1659" and both were standard texts in the
schools of the period. He also had the use of Barnabas
Smith's library of some two or three hundred volumes,
mostly religious in content, which had been given to him
by the widowed Hannah. These he kept on shelves of his
own making in his upstairs bedroom at Woolsthorpe, the
very room in which he would soon labor over some of his
most important scientific discoveries and mathematical for-
mulations.
Finally, in 1661, the moment of departure arrived.
Displaying the pride of a father, Stokes asked 18-year-old
Isaac to come to the front of the classroom. With tears in
his eyes, the headmaster made a speech praising the young
man and urging the other youths to follow his example.
On a window ledge of King's School, with the aid of
a penknife, Newton left a simple, permanent record to
be gazed upon by later generations of curious admirers:
"I. Newton."

My Greater
Friend"
Thomas Fuller, a 17th-century scholar,
described Cambridge's Trinity College as "the
stateliest and most uniform college in
Christendom." On the massive exterior of
Trinity's Great Gate is a statue of its founder,
the legendary King Henry VIII, whose six
wives set a record among English monarchs. It
was from this prospect that Isaac Newton first
gazed on the institution that would be his home
for almost 40 years. Before him stood the
chapel, the master's lodge, and the magnificent
dining hall, with its beamed ceilings, minstrels'
gallery, and huge portrait of Henry, which took
six strong men to carry. Beyond the Tudor
Gothic buildings spread "the Backs," the green
expanse bordering the Cam River. To someone
of Newton's limited experience with the out-
side world, it must have seemed miraculous and
frightening at the same time.
Newton entered the university as a sizar,
one whose financial circumstances were such

comer, between the Great Gate and Trinity Chapel.

that he had to wait tables, run errands for the Fellows, or
senior scholars, and wake his wealthier classmates before
dawn for morning chapel. Despite her considerable wealth,
it appears that Hannah Newton was not going to make
things easy for her wayward son, forcing him to earn his
keep. Equally humiliating was the fact that Newton was
going on 19 in the summer of 1661, which made him a
year or two older than most of those whom he served, set-
ting him even further apart.
As with all undergraduates, he was assigned a tutor,
who was both a teacher and something of a substitute
parent. In this case it was Benjamin Pulleyn, an obscure
professor of Greek about whom little is known. The young
scholar once again found himself immersed in the classics—
the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, the art of eloquent
communication called rhetoric, logic, ethics, history, and
much more. There were lectures to attend, papers to be
written, notebooks to be kept, including a worn brown
leather volume containing the inscription: "Isaac Newton,
Trinity College, Cambridge, 1661."
This volume, known to scholars as "the philosophical
notebook," begins with notes from the works of Aristotle.
The beautiful script has been entered with careful attention
to detail, as if in reverence for the most profound mind in
ancient history, and perhaps of all time. Then, suddenly, the
reader is met by dozens of blank pages before encountering
a radically different series of entries. At some point in 1663,
during his third year at Trinity, Newton began a new sec-
tion, which he titled "Certain Philosophical Questions."
More important, he penned the following revolutionary
sentence at the top of the first page: "I am a friend of Plato,
I am a friend of Aristotle, but truth is my greater friend."
He made his own index of the various subjects he planned
to investigate. These range from "Air," "Earth," and
"Matter" to "Time and Eternity," "Soul," and "Sleep."
22

"My Greater Friend"
Some headings contain no further
entries, but under others he
wrote from a few sentences to
many pages, forsaking his
elegant script for the
more cramped writing
of a young man in a
hurry. He got much
of his information
from the works of an
emerging group of
thinkers who helped
shape the 
modern
world 
view, 
men
known 
as 
"natural
philosophers," for the term
"scientist" would not be
coined until the 19th century.
Among those whose work he read
was Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), the Polish
astronomer who, in 1543, had challenged Aristotle and
scholarly authority by arguing that the planets, including
the Earth, circle the sun. By placing the Earth in motion
rather than at rest in the center of the universe, Copernicus
had stood a 2,000-year-old belief on its head.
Others soon stepped in to confirm mathematically and
experimentally what Copernicus had presented as theory.
Johannes Kepler (1571—1630), the brilliant German
astronomer who is now recognized as the first astrophysicist,
developed the earliest laws of planetary motion. Kepler's
first law states that the shape of each planet's orbit, or path
around the sun, is an ellipse, which resembles a gently
squeezed balloon. Thus the sun is somewhat off center, and
a planet's distance from it varies as it moves about the
medium-sized star.
In 1543, the Polish
astronomer Nicolaus
Copemicus put forth
the theory that the
Earth and the other
planets rotate around
the sun, challenging
the long-held view that
the Earth is the center
of the universe. This
drawing from his work
De Revolutionibus
dearly places the sun
at the center of the
23
univrts

Isaac Newton
Kepler's First and Second Laws
According to the first two
laws of planetary motion
developed by the German
astronomer Johannes
Kepler, the planets move
around the sun in elliptical
orbits and an orbiting
planet sweeps over equal
areas in equal times. When
the planet is far from the
sun and moving slower, the
pie slice is long and narrow
(SCD); when the planet is
near the sun and moving
faster, the pie slice is short
and wide (SAB).
Having shattered the ancient concept that the planets
orbit in perfect circles, Kepler next demonstrated in his sec-
ond law that the speed of a planet is not uniform but varies
according to its distance from the sun. When a planet is far-
thest from the sun, it slows down; conversely, as it
approaches the sun, it speeds up. The third law established a
relation between the average distance of a planet from the
sun and the time it takes to complete a single orbit, or pe-
riod in the language of astronomers. It would remain for a
young Cambridge student to formulate the universal prin-
ciple by which the planets are held in their orbits, but it was
through Kepler's mind and pen that mathematics—elegant,
precise, and powerful—entered the heavens.
Newton was also reading the works of the Italian genius
Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), who corresponded with
24

"My Greater Friend'
Kepler and died in the very year of Newton's birth. Most
famous for his use of the telescope, Galileo trained the first
of his many homemade instruments on the planets, moon,
and stars in 1609. What he saw shook the awed natural
philosopher to his roots: mountains and craters on the sur-
face of the moon, spots on the sun, the phases of Venus, the
moons of Jupiter. And when he looked beyond these
objects into the great abyss, he discovered the secret of the
Milky Way itself. "The galaxy," he wrote in his revolution-
ary little treatise The Starry Messenger, "is, in fact, nothing
but a congeries of innumerable stars grouped together in
clusters. Many of them are rather large and quite bright,
while the number of smaller ones is quite beyond calcula-
tion." As Copernicus had implied by making the Earth a
planet, the heavens and the sphere inhabited by humankind
are not fundamentally different but are made of the same
matter and subject to the same laws.
In 1633 Galileo was condemned by the Roman
Catholic Church for teaching what was termed "the
Copernican doctrine," which conflicted with the teachings
of the Bible. Though he was not tortured or imprisoned, as
were others who challenged spiritual authority, he was
placed under house arrest for his remaining years, during
which he continued to work while going blind from
glaucoma.
Newton was no less interested in Galileo's other claim
to fame, the experimental method that led to the overthrow
of Aristotle's theories. While Kepler was formulating his
laws of planetary motion, Galileo developed laws governing
the motion of bodies here on Earth. As a professor at the
University of Pisa, he found the ancient belief that heavier
bodies fall faster than lighter ones to be erroneous. In a
series of carefully timed experiments, he was able to show
that the acceleration of a falling body is proportional to
time and independent of its weight and density. Thus a

feather and a cannonball dropped
together would reach the ground at
the very same time were it not for
the resistance of air. This can be
demonstrated by employing an air-
less container, or vacuum chamber.
Moreover, Galileo successfully
challenged the time-honored belief
that an object at rest is in its natural
state. Rather, he postulated, it is
natural for an object in motion to
continue moving in a straight line,
a principle known as inertia. This
concept applies equally to a rolling
ball on Earth or the circling planet
itself. Only when acted upon by
some form of resistance do such
objects change speed or direction.
Newton was intoxicated by all
that he was reading and was preoc-
cupied as much by the behavior of the tiniest objects as by
the largest. He embraced those teachings of the ancients
that made sense to him, such as the theory of matter set
forth by the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus in the
4th century B.C. Democritus held that all things are com-
posed of minute, invisible particles he called atoms. They
contain the same matter as larger bodies but differ in size,
weight, and shape. According to the philosopher, the con-
stant movement of these whirling particles resulted in the
formation of the world and universe as we know it. As
Newton wrote in his notebook, "the first matter must be
atoms and that matter may be so small as to be indis-
cernible."
The Trinity notebook further demonstrates that
Newton, true to the natural philosopher he was to be,
26

"My Greater Friend'
distrusted the senses on which Aristotle and his followers
relied. He had already taken a deep interest in the experi-
mental method advocated by Galileo. The senses of
different individuals are affected differently by the same
phenomena. Newton wrote, "The nature of things is more
securely and naturally deduced from their operations on
one another than upon the senses; our explanation of both
soul and body" must not be colored by either. From then
on, when addressing questions to nature, he would embrace
the new scientific method and its fundamental steps: gather
data, formulate a hypothesis, conduct experiments, validate
or reject the hypothesis.
Even as he was studying the works of the new natural
philosophers, Newton was practicing science on his own.
Fascinated by celestial phenomena, he began tracking
comets across the starry sky. He observed the first in
December 1664 at 4:30 in the morning, while the rest of
the university slept. Another appeared in early April 1665,
causing him to wonder how these brilliant objects could
move across the firmament with such speed.
Though possessed of an iron will and a physical consti-
tution to match, even Newton had his limits. He later
informed John Conduitt, a relative by marriage, that he was
so obsessed with nightly observing that he became "much
disordered and learned to go to bed betimes." John North,
Master of Trinity, observed of Newton that "if he had not
wrought with his hands making experiments, he had killed
himself with study."
Newton not only courted exhaustion and illness, but he
risked his eyesight in the interest of science. Capturing the
sun's image in a looking glass, he observed its rays with his
right eye and then turned away. Circles of colors appeared
and then gradually vanished. Growing bolder, he looked at
the sun a second and a third time with both eyes. Suddenly
its multicolored imprint overlay every object upon which
27

Isaac Newton
he gazed, from an open book to a passing cloud. The condi-
tion grew worse, forcing Newton to shut himself up in his
darkened rooms for days. "I ... used all means to direct my
imagination from the sun. For if I thought upon him I
presently saw his picture though I was in the dark."
Gradually his sight returned, but even months later, when-
ever he thought of the sun, its spectrum reappeared "though
I lay in bed at midnight with my curtains drawn." When he
had sufficiently recovered to take pen in hand, the lingering
affliction was duly written up in the philosophical notebook
in 10 carefully worded steps, a testament to the experi-
menter's extraordinary self-control.
By 1664 Newton's lifework was pretty much deter-
mined. He had joined the intellectual company of those
who believed that the universe, like the great clocks adorn-
ing the bell towers of medieval cities, is governed by rational
mechanical laws and that nature's secrets will be revealed to
those employing the scientific method. Yet neither did he
think that such precision is the result of blind chance.
Behind it all he sensed the presence of intelligent planning
and purposeful direction. Under the heading "Of God," he
wrote, "Were men and beasts made by fortuitous jumblings
of atoms there would be many parts useless in them, here a
lump of flesh there a member too much. Some kinds of
beasts might have had but one eye some more than two."
This was a reminder to himself that nature's underlying
unity is a product of the Divine Mind. Atoms and mechani-
cal laws, no matter how fascinating, are as nothing when
compared to the knowledge and wisdom of the Creator.
Newton the mathematician makes no appearance in the
philosophical notebook, yet we know from other sources
that he was deeply immersed in the study of numbers dur-
ing this period. According to Abraham de Moivre, a French
mathematician and future member of Newton's circle, the
young Newton visited Sturbridge fair while a Trinity

undergraduate and bought a book on astrology out of
curiosity. He read until he came to an illustration of the
heavens he could not understand for a lack of trigonometry.
In turn, he bought a text on trigonometry but could not
fully grasp its contents, forcing him to seek out the work of
the ancient geometrician Euclid, which seemed absurdly
simple. But he soon realized that he had underestimated
Euclid's proofs and read the book with greater care a second
time. He next graduated to William Oughtreds treatise Key
to Mathematics and Rene Descartes's seminal work on ana-
lytical geometry, Discourse on Method, which "he found very
difficult and had to master by degrees." He went back over
all that he had read one more time before striking out to
claim new territory of his own.
Nowhere is there any mention of a guiding hand, thus
leading one to believe that Newton alone was responsible
for his mathematical education, as for so much else.
Pulleyn, his tutor and a professor of Greek, could have pro-
vided at best a measure of encouragement but little, if any,
instruction in this field. On at least two occasions in later
life, Newton commented on self-education in mathematics
and natural philosophy in a manner too suggestive of his
own experience to be dismissed as coincidence. He had
begun his great quest alone and he would end it the same
way, cut off from the interests of the less gifted, locked up
in a private world of protective isolation. The British natu-
ralist Charles Darwin knew this world as well. Among
Darwin's most rewarding experiences was tramping across
the highlands of South America in the silent company of
illiterate natives: "The whole of my pleasure was derived
from what passed in my mind," he wrote in his journal.
And when, after he had grown old and was revered like a
god, Newton was asked how he had made his discoveries,
he replied, "Truth is the offspring of silence and unbroken
meditation."

This page from Newton's diary from 1662 lists, in shorthand, many of the sins Newton had com-
mitted during his young life, ranging from swimming in a tub on the Sabbath to "threatening my
father and mother Smith to bume them and the house over them."
30

"My Greater Friend"
The one person who seems to have pierced that silence
was John Wickins, son of the master of Manchester
Grammar School. Wickins told his son Nicholas about his
chance encounter with Newton while the two were under-
graduates at Trinity. A dejected Wickins had left his rooms
to go for a walk one day after an argument with his boister-
ous roommate. Once outside, he encountered an equally
dejected Newton, who was experiencing the same problem
with his roommate: "They . . . thereupon agreed to shake
off their present disorderly companions and chum together,
which they did as soon as conveniently they could and so
continued as long as my Father stayed at college." This rela-
tionship was to last almost 20 years. Unfortunately, John
Wickins never recorded his invaluable memories of the
most creative period in Newton's life.
Content in their quarters, Newton and Wickins dis-
dained the drinking, gambling, and other antics common
among their fellow students. But while Newton confessed
to no significant sins of the flesh in the list of transgressions
he drew up in 1662, he did admit to "setting my heart on
money" more than God. This was followed by a further
confession that he had suffered "a relapse."
After he celebrated his 21st birthday in 1663, the
considerable profits from the land deeded to him by
the Reverend Smith were his to do with as he pleased.
No longer a waiter on tables or an errand runner, Newton
the budding natural philosopher became Newton the
student moneylender. The philosophical notebook contains
a list of his accounts, and judging by the number of
clients he served business was thriving. Conservative that
he was, he only once lent as much as a pound, noting that
the sum was "to be paid on Friday." How much interest
he charged is unclear, but the moneylender has never
been a popular figure in society and this practice doubtless
only served to set Newton further apart from his fellow
students.

Upon successful com-

his bachelor's degree,
the notoriously thrifty
Newton splurged on a
fancy gown for himself.
In 1664 he passed the required scholarship examina-
tions, ridding himself of the distasteful title of "sizar."
Officially declared a "scholar," he was now entitled to
receive free meals from his college in addition to a regular
stipend. Even more important, he could remain at Trinity to
take his master's degree and, if all went well, extend his resi-
dence at Cambridge indefinitely by obtaining a fellowship, a
plan shared by the steadfast Wickins.
At this point Catherine Storer's little remaining hope of
marrying her childhood sweetheart vanished forever, and
she accepted the proposal of a Grantham attorney named
Francis Bakon. Still Newton remained her friend through
the years, visiting her whenever he returned to Lincoln-
shire, sometimes bearing small gifts.
Less than a year after being made scholar, Newton,
together with his fellow candidates for the B.A., took the
32

"My Greater Friend'
centuries-old examinations that constituted the last hurdle
before gaining a degree. Based mostly on the teachings of
ancient and medieval thinkers, the exams placed a premium
on oral debate and logic. As a student at Cambridge a gen-
eration later, William Stukeley heard that Newton was put
in second place, "which is looked upon as disgraceful." Yet,
as Stukeley noted, this was hardly out of character: "It
seems no strange thing, notwithstanding Sir Isaac's great
parts, for we may well suppose him too busy in the solid
part of learning to allow much time to be master of words
only, or the trifling niceties of logic, which universities still
make the chiefest qualification for a degree."
Whatever the truth of the matter, Newton and 25
other Trinity men took their degrees in the spring of 1665.
While he may have done poorly on the outdated exams,
the Trinity notebook stands as proof that truth was indeed
his "greater friend," that at Cambridge Isaac Newton had
found his genius.

Of Genius, Fire,
and Plague
Newton had no sooner graduated from Cambridge than he
was forced to leave the university and return to Woolsthorpe,
though not by his own choosing. In London, where the city's
rapidly increasing population had reached half a million by
1660, people were suddenly taken ill. The disease began with a
severe headache and dizziness, followed by trembling in the
limbs, swelling under the arms and in the groins, raging fever
and, finally, telltale dark splotches on the skin, which the
famous diarist Samuel Pepys described as "tokens of near
approaching death. Within a few hours they must go down
into the dust."
The infamous Black Death, or bubonic plague, had first
appeared in Europe in 1347, carried from the Middle East by
ship rats in whose fur infected fleas lay hidden. Once a rat suc-
ceeded in reaching shore, its parasites were easily transferred to
a human host, launching a deadly epidemic. Since there was no
known cure for the disease, lord, serf, merchant, and beggar
alike fell victim. In some areas, well over half the population
died; commerce and agriculture came to a halt; cities and
towns were deserted; wolves reclaimed the silent streets.
34

Of Genius, Fire, and Plague
Aside from ordering that the ill be completely isolated,
physicians could do little but invoke an adage made famous by
the Romans when faced by disease centuries earlier: "fly
quickly, go far, return slowly." Thus, as Pepys noted in his
diary, the government abandoned London for the relative
safety of Oxford, and was soon followed by ordinary citizens
who spread across the countryside by the tens of thousands. In
September 1665, as the contagion reached its peak, some
8,000 deaths were being recorded in the city every week.
What was worse, in attempting to save themselves Londoners
carried the plague to the eastern counties, and then to the
Midlands. In October, Cambridge University's Senate voted to
close the institution, but by this time all but a few administra-
tors had fled before the invisible enemy.
Left to his own devices in rural Lincolnshire, Newton now
began one of the greatest intellectual odysseys in the history of

modern science. Thinking back on the two plague years of
1665 and 1666 decades later, he wrote the French scholar
Pierre Des Maizeaux, "For in those days I was in the prime of
my age of invention and minded mathematics and philosophy
more than at any time since."
William Whiston, a future friend and disciple of Newton,
wrote that "Sir Isaac, in mathematics, could sometimes see
almost by intuition, even without demonstration and when he
did propose conjectures in natural philosophy [science], he
almost always knew them to be true at the same time."
Having mastered the works of the most advanced mathe-
maticians of his day, Newton was far from satisfied. Algebra
was fine for determining the numerical answer to specific con-
ditions set forth in an equation; geometry served to determine
the relationships of points, lines, and angles. But what of more
complex questions involving the ever-changing speed of a
moving object and the constant alteration of that object's path
as its speed changes? Here the mathematician is faced with two
quantities that vary continuously, the one with the other, and
he must determine the rates of variation for any given moment
in time.
Others had tackled such numbing problems in the past,
and with some measure of success. The French mathematicians
Rene Descartes and Pierre de Fermat (1601-65) had solved
individual problems of this nature, but at the cost of elegance
and simplicity. The methods they employed were too cumber-
some for general use. Nor had they succeeded in devising a
general method that could be applied to all problems of a given
type, the stuff of which great mathematicians dream.
Newton had composed his first major mathematical paper
at Cambridge in May 1665, shortly before the university
closed its doors. He completed a second, more advanced,
paper at Woolsthorpe in November and three others during
the feverish year 1666. His work involved a revolutionary
method he termed "fluxions," or quantities subject to constant
36

Of Genius, Fire, and Plague
rates of change. By late 1666 Isaac Newton, who was
approaching his 24th birthday, had become the most advanced
mathematician the world had yet known. With his fluxions, or
what we now call the calculus, a mathematician can solve
problems in which quantities and motions are not definite and
unchanging but in the process of originating, fluctuating, even
disappearing. With it Newton could determine the most
minute variations in the acceleration of a body as it falls
through space, compute the precise arc of a revolving planet,
or measure the exact rate in the slowing of a ball as it inches to
a stop after being rolled across the ground. In sum, the calculus
is a most effective tool both for resolving problems concerning
the smallest—or what Newton himself termed "infinitesi-
mal"—variations in the rate of motion of a given body and for
determining its path through space. Recognizing the need for
the utmost precision in our dealings with nature, he had sur-
passed all others by formulating a mathematical method with
which to deal with nature on its own terms.
Not surprisingly, this newly discovered power thrilled the
young man who possessed it. When he visited the nearby
home of Humphrey Babington, an older Cambridge scholar
who may have helped him get into the university, Newton
brought his papers with him. His excitement on solving one
mathematical problem was so great that he carried out the
division to 55 places, and might have continued on had not the
long line of zeros literally overflowed the edge of the page. Yet
where others would have shouted their victory to the mathe-
matical world, Newton remained curiously silent. Proof to him
was sufficient unto itself; the rest of the world did not matter,
at least for the time being.
It was while he was at Woolsthorpe waiting for
Cambridge to reopen that Newton experienced the insight
that became the subject of legend. A year before he died, his
friend William Stukeley visited him at his home in Kensington
near London. After dining, they went into the garden to drink
37

tea under the shade of some apple trees. "Amidst other dis-
course," Stukeley wrote, "he told me he was just in the same
situation as when formerly the notion of gravitation came into
his mind. It was occasioned by the fall of an apple, as he sat in
a contemplative mood."
It had occurred to Newton that the power of gravity does
not seem to decrease significantly as an object moves away
from the center of the Earth. If it remains the same on the
highest mountain and atop the loftiest building, "why not as
high as the moon," he said to himself. If this is true, the moon
must be influenced by this mysterious force, "perhaps she is
retained in her orbit thereby." What is true of the moon as it
orbits Earth must also be true of the planets as they circle the
sun. And why not the glimmering stars beyond?
Having read Galileo and Descartes, Newton was well
acquainted with the principle of inertia, which holds that once
a body is set in motion it will not rest unless acted upon by
38

Of Genius, Fire, and Plague
some external force. He also knew that a body in motion will
move in a straight line unless it is diverted somehow. Thus, he
conjectured that the natural motion of a ball—or an apple—set
in motion would carry it away from Earth, outward into the
abyss. But something happens: gravity intervenes, altering the
object's course and bringing it to ground.
Instead of throwing a ball, Newton thought of shooting it
from a cannon. In this instance, it would travel a much greater
distance yet, as when thrown, it would eventually return to
Earth. He dreamed of even bigger cannons and larger arcs, and
drew sketches to demonstrate how the object would travel far-
ther and farther around the Earth until, finally, it would leave
the planet and settle into orbit, like the moon.
Newton was immediately faced with another problem.
While the power of gravity does not appear to diminish as one
moves away from the Earth's center, this must be an illusion.
Were it not so the moon would surely crash into the planet,
while the Earth itself, together with Mercury, Venus, Jupiter,
Mars, and Saturn, would careen into the sun. Only if gravity
decreases at a distance can this celestial balancing act be main-
tained.
Envisioning the moon as a giant apple,
Newton developed the idea of how
gravity works. The satellite's tendency
to move away from Earth in a straight
line is counteracted by the inward
pull of gravity, which produces
an orbit, much as an object on a
string when it is whirled around
one's head. The moon is perfectly
balanced between the tendency to
move outward—or what is termed
centrifugal force—and the inward pull
of Earth.
At this point Newton immersed himself
in mathematical calculations, most of which are
A diagram from
Newton's A Treatise
of the System of the
World, published after
his death, shows that if

enough force, it will

around the Earth.

Isaac Newton
lost, in an attempt to determine the force sufficient to keep the
moon in its orbit. Nor, in another brilliant insight, did he
assume that the Earth is the lone actor in this celestial drama.
Any object, he had come to believe, has the power to attract
any other object. An apple attracts the Earth just as the Earth
attracts an apple, although the planet's size is so great that it
challenges common sense. And what is true of the apple is
equally true of the moon.
Newton believed that the attraction between the Earth
and the moon must decrease inversely as the square of the dis-
tance separating them. Hence, if this attraction amounts to a
certain force when the bodies are at a given distance from each
other, at twice the distance the force will not be half as great
but one-fourth as great; at three times the distance, not one-
third as great but one-ninth as great, and so on, in ever smaller
proportion as the distance increases. The same formula must
apply to the sun and planets, suggesting that a universal princi-
ple is at work. As Newton himself later wrote of this period, "I
deduced the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must
be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers
about which they revolve."
But there were problems. Try as he might, the young
genius could not get his calculations to work out as he had
expected. According to the mathematician William Whiston,
in whom Newton later confided, "Upon this disappointment
... 
Sir Isaac . . . threw aside the paper of his calculation and
went on to other studies." "To be looked upon as one of my
guesses," Newton joked years later after finally achieving the
result he was after. Oh, but what a "guess" it was!
Though relatively secure from the plague, which had
begun to subside, Newton remained at Woolsthorpe through-
out most of 1666, where, in September, word arrived that
another tragedy had befallen the beleaguered citizens of
London. The Great Fire, as it came to be known, began on
September 2, and raged out of control for four days and four
40

Of Genius, Fire, and Plague
nights. The flames laid waste an area a mile and a half long and
half a mile wide, consuming 436 acres, more than 13,000
houses, and 87 churches, including beautiful old St. Paul's
Cathedral. The remains of the city were leveled as though on a
great battleground; a deep and unbroken sea of ashes, soot, and
dirt were all that remained of the London beloved by
Shakespeare and Elizabeth I. Many believed that the fire, like
the Great Plague, was an act of Divine retribution brought on
by a God made angry by the sinful ways of his children, a view
that Newton, with his strong puritanical streak, may well have
shared. There was, however, at least one important blessing to
be counted in the fire's aftermath. While tens of thousands had
died from the plague, the death toll from the fire was miniscule
by comparison. The official Bills of Mortality listed only six
people as having perished in the flames.
One casualty of the plague was Sturbridge fair, which
Newton visited sometime before the epidemic forced its clos-
ing. It was there, he wrote, that "I procured me a triangular
glass prism to try therewith the celebrated phenomena of
colors."
The prism had been known since the time of the Roman
philosopher and statesman Seneca in the 1st century A.D. But
even before this, Aristotle had argued that colors are a mixture
of light and dark, or of black and white, a view that was still
accepted by most natural philosophers of Newton's day. It was
thought that red was the strongest, least modified, and closest
to pure white of all the colors, while blue was the weakest,
most modified, and closest to black. But no matter what the
color from the spectrum—whether red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, or violet—all were believed to be modifications
of pure white light.
At Woolsthorpe, Newton conceived of a novel experi-
ment. Darkening his upstairs bedroom, which faced the south,
he drilled a one-eighth-inch hole in a shutter and intercepted
the beam of incoming light with a prism. The resulting spec-
41

so-called crucial experi-
ment shows light from

through another prism.
The colors never changed.
trum was projected on the wall across the room. To his sur-
prise, the spectrum took the form of an oblong strip rather
than the perfect circle Descartes said should appear. This could
mean only one thing: each of the seven colors was refracted, or
bent, at different angles on passing through the prism—red the
least and violet the most, and the other colors in between.
Ever cautious, Newton conceived of a second, equally
powerful, experiment that he later termed the experimentum
crucis, the crucial test. After placing a prism near the drilled
hole, he intercepted the spectrum with a second prism located
about "5 or 6 yards from ye former." As with the first prism,
blue rays were bent at a greater angle than the red ones. "The
fashion of the colors was in all cases the same," he wrote. He
then realized that if the angles of the bent colored rays could
be accurately calculated, a new law of refraction could be for-
mulated. He quickly set about determining these angles, or
sines, a further vindication of his vision that nature operates
according to precise mathematical principles.
The experimentum crucis led to another, equally powerful,
insight. Newton observed each ray as it passed through the sec-
42

Of Genius, Fire, and Plague
ond prism. Just as he suspected, blue remained blue, orange
remained orange, and so forth. He rotated the prism and still
each color remained the same. If colors were nothing but
modifications of white light, as had long been believed, the
second prism should have produced other colors by turning
red to orange or blue to indigo, but it did not. White light, he
had proven beyond any reasonable doubt, is made up of all the
colors of the spectrum, none of which are altered on passing
through a prism. In the language of a poet, Isaac Newton had
"untwisted the shining robe of day" and deftly put it back
together again.
Looking back over Newton's achievements more than
three centuries later, historians have termed the Woolsthorpe
period the annus mirabilis—the wondrous year—though the
discoveries actually took place over the course of two years
rather than one. So far as we know, Newton had not yet com-
municated anything of what he had learned to another human
being. But perhaps as a way of rewarding himself and pleasing
his mother, he traveled the familiar road to Grantham in 1666.
There before the king's representative called a herald, he signed
himself "Isaac Newton of Woolsthorpe, Gentleman, age 23."

With a bachelor's degree in hand and his status as a gentle-
man legally recorded, Newton returned to Cambridge and
Trinity College to complete his master of arts. He now
faced the fellowship elections of September and October
1667. If successful, he could extend his stay at Trinity indef-
initely; if not, he would likely be forced to choose between
the life of an obscure gentleman farmer or the pastorship of
a village church in rural Lincolnshire.
For three days during late September, Newton and his
fellow candidates assembled in the chapel to undergo oral
questioning. On the fourth day each was given a theme by
the master of Trinity to be completed in writing within a
period of six hours. As when Newton sat for bachelor's
degree exams, the subjects covered were mostly drawn from
the writings of ancient Greek and Roman scholars. On
October 1, "by ye tolling of ye little bell," the successful
candidates were called back to the chapel. The bell tolled
for Newton, who, together with eight other students, swore
to embrace the "true religion of Christ." Now officially a
Fellow of the college, he had been granted permanent citi-
zenship in the academic community. Never again would he
45

Isaac Newton
have to face the unsettling prospect of being wrenched from
the labors he so loved.
Together with John Wickins, his trusted companion,
Newton celebrated for one of the few times in his life. The
two hired a painter and a carpenter to refurbish their living
quarters and then ordered new carpets and furniture,
including a couch and "ticking for a featherbed." Newton
also took an interest in his appearance and spent heavily on
suits and shoes during the next two years. Added to this was
the cost of a bachelor's gown, followed by an even larger
expenditure for a tailor-made master's gown a year later. As
was the custom, Newton shelled out 17 shillings to cele-
brate his B.A. and spent 15 more when he was created mas-
ter of arts on July 7, 1668. In between he recorded being
"at the tavern several other times," and he had even lost 15
shillings playing cards. Then, after entertaining his "cousin
Ayscough" and an unidentified acquaintance, these expen-
ditures ended as abruptly as they began. By all indications,
Newton had returned to his solitary ways.
Not until August 1668, a month after he received his
master's degree, did Newton first visit London. Although
reconstruction was well under way, nearly four-fifths of the
city still lay in ruin, a blackened monument to the massive
devastation wrought by the Great Fire. Where he stayed and
how he occupied his seven weeks in the capital remain
minor mysteries, but he likely purchased books and supplies
for his small laboratory and perhaps met certain of the
mathematicians and natural philosophers whose works had
inspired his scientific research.
Thus far the only scholar who knew anything of
Newton's brilliance was Isaac Barrow, Lucasian Professor of
Mathematics at Cambridge. This unusual academic had
traveled throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle
East, besting a "loose-tongued Turk" in hand-to-hand
combat and bravely repelling an attack on his ship by
Maltese pirates. A preacher by training and temperament, a
46

The Revolutionary Professor
heavy smoker, and slovenly in dress, Barrow
nurtured a keen interest in optics, analyti-
cal geometry, and the mechanical
model of the universe.
Newton recalled having been
in the audience when Barrow
gave the first of his Lucasian lec-
tures in 1664, and allowed that
Barrow may have stimulated his
interest in advanced mathemat-
ics, but nothing more. It is also
possible that Newton had visited
Barrow in his quarters during the
weekly hours set aside for dis-
cussing matters raised in his lectures,
and that Barrow may have lent the stu-
dent books from his personal library. Yet
Stukeley tells us that during the scholarship
examinations of April 1664, Dr. Barrow found
that Newton had neglected Euclid and "conceived then but
an indifferent opinion of him."
Whatever the nature of their early relationship, by 1669
Barrow was aware of Newton's unique mathematical gifts.
Upon receiving of a copy of Nicholas Mercator's new trea-
tise, Logarithmotechnia (The Art of Logarithms), from the
London mathematical intermediary John Collins, Barrow
drafted an enthusiastic reply, which struck Collins like a bolt
from the blue: "A friend of mine here, that hath a very
excellent genius to these things, brought me the other day
some paper, wherein he has set down methods of calculat-
ing the dimensions of magnitudes like that of Mr. Mercator
concerning the hyperbola, but very general." The unidenti-
fied friend, of course, was Isaac Newton, and the paper
referred to was his little treatise De Analysi per Aequationes
Infinitas (On Analysis by Infinite Series), which Barrow
promised to forward in his next letter.
Isaac Barrow, Lucasian
Professor of Mathematics
at Cambridge, was one
of the first to notice
Newton's brilliance.
47

Isaac Newton
It was with much difficulty that Barrow persuaded
Newton to present his work to the scholarly world. This
seems all the more strange because Newton's very purpose
in drafting De Analysi was to establish his rightful priority
to the method published by Mercator. An anxious Collins
had to wait two weeks before he received the promised
material, and still Newton's name was not revealed. Only
after Collins replied in the most enthusiastic terms did
Barrow respond: "I am glad my friend's paper giveth you so
much satisfaction. His name is Mr. Newton, a fellow of our
college, and very young . . . but of an extraordinary genius
and proficiency in these things." Barrow, with Newton's
permission, allowed Collins to show the paper to Lord
Brouncker, president of the Royal Society, and additional
copies were made for circulation among several of Collins's
associates. Under no circumstances, however, would the
naturally secretive Newton allow a frustrated Collins to
publish his work. Not until 1711, when Newton was 68,
did De Analysi, one of the earliest examples of his revolu-
tionary fluxions, reach print.
The belief that Barrow had been keeping an eye on the
budding Newton for some time is further borne out by the
Lucasian professor's request that Newton help him edit
his forthcoming book on optics. Whether Barrow was
aware of Newton's recent discoveries in this field remains
another mystery. Since his own work was still in the experi-
mental stage, Newton may have chosen not to dampen
Barrow's spirits by discussing experiments that, if con-
firmed, would render the professor's work obsolete.
Moreover, Newton was in quest of a major plum and want-
ed to do nothing to jeopardize his chances. Barrow had
always considered himself to be more of a theologian than a
natural philosopher, so when the opportunity arose to
become chaplain to King Charles II, he jumped at it.
Shortly before Barrow's departure for London, and doubt-
less as a result of his considerable influence, Isaac Newton
48

The Revolutionary Professor
was appointed Cambridge's second Lucasian Professor of
Mathematics on October 29, 1669.
Newton was only 27 years old, but his shoulder-length
hair was already turning a beautiful silver. Wearing the scar-
let robes of his new position, he strode across Trinity's Great
Court to deliver the first of his lectures in early 1670, no
doubt turning some heads along the way. Free to choose
among a broad range of subjects, he selected optics, his first
and greatest love among the experimental sciences. "I
judge," he began, that "it will not be unacceptable if I bring
the principles of this science to a more strict examination."
The work with prisms that Newton had undertaken
during the mid-1660s had been refined with a passion put
to use. As reported by the Scottish physician Dr. George
Cheyne, when Newton was carrying on his investigations
into light and colors "to quicken his faculties and fix his
attention, [he] confined himself to a small quantity of bread,
during all the time, with a little sack [wine] and water, of
which he took as he found a craving or failure of spirits."
Three years' additional labor now enabled Newton "to
bring forth my opinion more distinctly." This he did in a
series of eight lectures delivered before an audience that
dwindled rapidly after his first address. Indeed, none of his
colleagues or students at Trinity left a record of having been
in attendance, a symptom of the general lack of interest in
the new science. Even Barrow, a popular figure on campus,
had taught only a handful of followers during his five years
in the Lucasian chair, sometimes lecturing to an empty
room. If Newton's revolutionary discovery that sunlight is a
mixture of all the rainbow colors was to reach a wider audi-
ence, he would have to communicate it to a world beyond
Trinity's protective walls.
Among the books he had acquired as a young man was
a copy of Optica Promota (The Promotion of Optics) by
James Gregory, the distinguished Scottish mathematician
and astronomer. As was his habit, Newton dog-eared the
49

his reflecting telescope.

scopes, Newton was the

passages most important to him, including Gregory's design
for the reflecting telescope. As yet, no one had successfully
built a working reflector. In 1663 Gregory himself had gone
so far as to order a special lens from Richard Reive,
London's leading instrument maker, but Reive had failed in
his attempts to produce the delicate object.
Newton took up the challenge a few years later, and
his reason for doing so is not difficult to understand. Unlike
the refracting telescope, which forms an image of an object
with lenses, the reflector contains a parabolic, or saucerlike,
mirror from which all light is reflected at the same angle.
The advantage of this design is that the observer is not hin-
dered by chromatic aberration, the hazy, rainbowlike phe-
nomena produced when rays of different wavelengths are
not brought to the same focus on passing through a lens.
Though no one but Newton realized it at the time, the
reflecting telescope, in producing an image free from distor-
tion, offered further support for his theory of light and
colors.
50

The Revolutionary Professor
With the same skilled hands that had produced the
models and clocks of his youth, Newton set to work. Using
a thin piece of metal rather than glass, which is almost
impossible to grind evenly with hand tools, he created a
hollow in the shape of a saucer. He then prepared a special
alloy, or combination of metals, composed of copper, tin,
and arsenic, which is white in color and takes a high polish.
When this tedious task was completed, he coated the metal
mirror, or speculum, and placed it and other components in
a small tube. In a letter to an unnamed friend, dated
February 23, 1669, he described its performance. Newton
calculated that the instrument was capable of magnifying
"about 40 times in diameter which is more than any 6 foot
tube can do, I believe with distinctness. I have seen with it
Jupiter distinctly round and his satellites." He had no doubt
that a carefully crafted 6-foot reflector would perform as
well as any "60 or 100 foot tube made after the common
way." Realizing how puzzling this claim might sound, he
added, "It may seem a paradoxical [strange] assertion, yet it
is the necessary consequence of some experiments which I
have made concerning the nature of light."
Word of Newton's triumph spread to London, where
he was erroneously hailed as the inventor of the reflector.
This circumstance was reminiscent of 1609, when Galileo
constructed the first refracting telescope in Italy from a
description sent him by a scientific correspondent from
abroad. Most anxious to see Newton's telescope were mem-
bers of the Royal Society, a scientific order founded in 1660
and chartered by none other than King Charles II. The
society took as its motto part of the Latin quotation Nullius
in verba, which freely translates, "Not by word of mouth."
Its membership, which included the finest scientific minds
of the time, both English and foreign, were pledged to the
experimental method as opposed to the ancient practice of
observation alone. The society's findings were regularly
published in the renowned Philosophical Transactions, which
51

sented this reflecting
telescope to the Royal
Society.
became the model for other
scientific journals down to the
present day.
This time Newton found
the urging of his peers impos-
sible to resist. He constructed a
new, somewhat modified ver-
sion of his first reflector and
turned it over to Barrow, who
proudly carried the little
instrument to London at the
end of 1671. It created a sensa-
tion and was soon brought to
Whitehall, where an anxious
King Charles II was treated to
a demonstration of its powers.
Meanwhile, Henry Olden-
burg, the secretary of the
Royal Society, wrote the great Dutch scientist Christiaan
Huygens (1629-95) to inform him of Newton's success. On
receiving word of the reflector, Huygens wrote back,
describing the new instrument as nothing less than "the
marvelous telescope of Mr. Newton."
Oldenburg also wrote Newton a letter of congratula-
tions in which he informed the secretive professor that he
had been nominated for membership in the Royal Society.
Newton gratefully acknowledged the honor, then dropped
a bombshell: "I am [proposing] and considering to be
examined an account of a philosophical discovery which
induced me to the making of the said telescope, and which
being in my judgment the oddest if not the most consider-
able detection which hath hitherto been made in the opera-
tions of nature."
Little did anyone in London realize that Newton was
referring to his discovery that white light is composed of
the primary colors. Yet once he had so boldly promised to
52

The Revolutionary Professor
reveal one of nature's greatest secrets, he suddenly began
having second thoughts. "I hope," he wrote in his next let-
ter to a puzzled Oldenburg, that "I shall get some spare
hours to send you . . . that account [of light] which I
promised."
After wavering, Newton wrote up the major steps in
his optical discoveries that led him to the experimentum
crucis, and even included an explanation of colors of the
rainbow. Water droplets that refract the most light rays are
on the exterior of the rainbow and appear to be red, while
droplets comprising the inner layers deflect less light and
appear as darker colors. He concluded by requesting that if
any of the Fellows were interested enough to repeat his
experiments, "I should be very glad to be informed with
what success."
Newton, it seems, need not have worried. Oldenburg
placed his paper on the agenda of the next meeting, where
it was read aloud. The session had no sooner adjourned
than the secretary wrote him to report the result: "[The]
reading of your discourse concerning light and colors was
almost their only entertainment for that time. I can assure
you, Sir, that it there met with a singular attention and
uncommon applause." Oldenburg urged Newton to give
him permission to publish the paper in the next issue of the
Philosophical Transactions, which would bring the author last-
ing fame.
Newton's spirits soared when he received word of the
reception of his work. As to the printing of the paper, he
replied to Oldenburg, "I leave it to their pleasure," a far cry
from his earlier refusal to allow John Collins to publish the
equally revolutionary De Analysi.

"Kindling Coal"
As curator of experiments for the Royal Society, Robert
Hooke was given the considerable task of confirming
Newton's findings with prisms. No portrait of Hooke sur-
vives, but the diary writer Samuel Pepys observed that he
"is the most and promises the least of any man in the world
I ever saw." Of medium stature, Hooke suffered from a bent
spine; his large head, dominated by bulging gray eyes,
seemed too big for his body. A pale complexion and fixed
stare created the impression of one detached and unaware of
his surroundings.
Despite his deceptive looks, Hooke possessed gifts that
bordered on genius and a temperament reminiscent of
Leonardo da Vinci's. His thought process was an erratic
mixture of sudden uprisings and agonizing downfalls. He
raced from problem to problem, often attacking new ones
before resolving previous questions. It is on men like
Hooke that fate plays one of its crudest jokes, blessing them
with great intuition while denying them the mathematical
gifts to transform their visions into concrete principles.
Always painfully conscious of more than he could prove,
Hooke watched in agony while others reaped the harvest
for which he had helped prepare the ground.
54

Like Achilles and Hector, the champions of ancient
Greece and Troy, Newton and Hooke seemed destined by
the gods to do battle. On the day Newton's reflecting tele-
scope was first examined by the Royal Society Fellows, a
jealous Hooke argued that the invention was not necessary.
Hooke claimed he had fashioned a refracting telescope
eight years earlier that was only an inch long and could be
worn on the chain of his pocket watch. According to its
inventor, it performed better than any telescope 50 feet
long. Only the onset of the plague had kept him from mak-
ing a larger version of the instrument. Nor had he wanted
the glass grinders to know his secret. At least some of those
present must have been skeptical, for Hooke liked to brag
After Newton's revolu-
tionary paper on the
nature of light was pub-
lished by the Royal
Society, Christiaan
Huygens, the greatest
natural scientist of the
era, called his work
"highly ingenious." Other
scientists, however, were
not as impressed.
55

Isaac Newton
and often claimed that the fear of theft was the reason for
not making his inventions and discoveries known.
Ever in a hurry, Hooke later admitted that he spent
very little time reading Newton's paper and duplicating his
experiments, a step essential to confirming the results. Yet
he agreed with Newton's conclusions, with one major
exception. After stating that he would "not mingle conjec-
tures with certainties," Newton had asserted that "it can no
longer be disputed whether light be a body." In other
words, experiments had led him to embrace what was then
known as the "corpuscular theory," which held that a light
beam is composed of minute particles, or corpuscles, whose
"blows" on the surface of objects produce the colors of the
spectrum. Conversely, Hooke, who leaned toward the the-
ory that light is composed of waves rather than of tiny par-
ticles, took Newton to task for making an unproven claim:
"Nay, even those very experiments which he alleged do
seem to me to prove that light is nothing but a pulse or
motion propagated through a ... 
uniform and transparent
medium."
Angry at having left himself open to criticism, Newton
delayed his reply, vowing never to make the mistake of mix-
ing fact with conjecture again. Meanwhile, comments
began coming in from other natural philosophers who had
read his paper in the Philosophical Transactions.
Foremost among them was the great Dutch scientist
Christiaan Huygens, who had taken up residence in Paris
after being promised a handsome pension by Jean-Baptiste
Colbert, minister of finance to Louis XIV, the Sun King.
Having earlier praised Newton's telescope, Huygens pro-
nounced the new theory of colors "highly ingenious."
Coming from Europe's greatest natural philosopher, this was
heady praise indeed.
But there were rumblings from other quarters that
Newton did not appreciate. Sir Robert Moray, who served
as the first president of the Royal Society, proposed four
56

"Kindling Coal'
Newton's revolutionary paper on the nature of light was published along with more mundane articles on
music and geography in the February 19, 1672, issue of Philosophical Transactions.
57

Isaac Newton
simplistic and essentially worthless experiments as a means
of verifying the experimentum crucis, which Moray lacked the
skill to duplicate himself. Then from France came a long
letter written by Ignance Gaston Pardies, a professor of
speech and a member of the Society of Jesus, a learned
order of Roman Catholic priests. Like Moray, Pardies had
failed in several attempts to duplicate the experimentum crucis
and concluded that Newton's results lacked scientific merit.
A deeply irritated Newton drafted a sharp reply in which he
concluded that "[my results] are difficult to prove, and
which if I did not know to be true, I should prefer to reject
as vain and empty speculation, than acknowledge them as
my hypothesis."
A shaken Pardies next wrote to Oldenburg. He included
a comment for Newton, but begged the Royal Society sec-
retary to examine its contents for anything offensive before
forwarding it to Cambridge. Pardies had withdrawn his first
argument but raised another in its place, which again chal-
lenged Newton's skills as an experimentalist. Newton sent
an even more chilling blast across the English Channel,
scolding the Jesuit for his sloppy work and for "philosophiz-
ing" instead of "establishing properties by experiments." At
Newton's instruction, Pardies took up his prisms once again
and this time reproduced the very results contained in
Newton's original paper. "The last scruple which I had
about the experimentum crucis'' Pardies wrote Oldenburg, "is
fully removed. I now clearly perceive by [Newton's] figure
what I did not before understand. ... 
I have nothing fur-
ther to desire."
Newton had no sooner settled his accounts with Pardies
when Oldenburg began pressing him for a publishable reply
to Hooke's criticism of the corpuscular theory. Alerted to
Newton's temper, Oldenburg cautioned Newton to "aim at
nothing but the discovery of truth" instead of attacking per-
sons by name.
58

"Kindling Coal'
It was a warning Newton chose not to heed in his
response of June 11, 1672, in which Hooke is named at
least 30 times. Newton began by expressing disappointment
in a person from whom he had expected an impartial
examination of his hypothesis. Once the knife was inserted,
he began twisting the blade: "Mr. Hooke knows well that it
is not for one man to prescribe rules to the studies of
another, especially not understanding the grounds on which
he proceeds." He then went on to show that it did not mat-
ter which mechanical hypothesis one might embrace;
whether corpuscles, waves, or some other, the principle of
colors remained unchanged. Hooke would do well to
repeat the experimentum crucis rather than rely on "hypothet-
ical explications."
It was a brilliant, if not necessarily fair, exercise in turn-
ing the tables. Instead of asking Newton to redraft his
response, Oldenburg, who disliked the know-it-all Hooke,
immediately presented the reply to the council of the
Royal Society. Hooke was humiliated and suffered addi-
tional embarrassment when Oldenburg published the
text in the November issue of the Philosophical Transactions,
while Hooke's criticism of Newton's work never reached
print.
Still, Newton must have felt a lot like the Dutch boy
who attempted to plug holes in the dike with his fingers;
each time one was sealed another opened up. In the
autumn of 1672 Huygens, his only important ally in the
international scientific community, expressed second
thoughts about the conclusions on light in a letter to
Oldenburg. After the letter was passed on to Newton, the
secretary received a stunning reply: "Sir, I desire that you
will procure that I may be put out from being any longer a
Fellow of the Royal Society. For though I honor that body,
yet since I see I shall neither profit them, nor can partake of
the advantage of their assemblies, I desire to withdraw."
59

Isaac Newton
Oldenburg and John Collins, who was still correspond-
ing with Newton on mathematics, quickly put their heads
together in hopes of averting disaster. Taking Newton's res-
ignation for what it was—a plea for emotional support—
Oldenburg not only promised to cancel Newton's quarterly
dues but wrote, "You may be satisfied that the [Royal
Society] in general esteems and loves you, which I can
assure you of." Newton was not completely satisfied, but
when he wrote back two weeks later he dropped the matter
of his resignation. However, he wrote, "I must signify to
you that I intend to be no further solicitous about matters of
philosophy." Needless to say, Oldenburg forwarded no more
letters to him containing objections to the paper on light.
A curtain of silence descended. For the next two and a
half years Newton scarcely corresponded with anyone.
Then, in September 1674, Francis Hall, or Linus, as he
called himself in Latin, sent a letter to Oldenburg criticizing
Newton's experiments. Oldenburg was hesitant to pass it
on, but if he did not do so his position as a scientific agent
would be compromised. The letter was forwarded, and it
did not take long to learn that the Cambridge professor
remained as touchy as ever. Newton wrote Oldenburg that
Linus, an 80-year-old professor of Hebrew and mathematics,
had gotten it all wrong, just as his fellow Jesuit Pardies had.
Newton reaffirmed his earlier position that he was no longer
interested in debating the finer points of natural philosophy,
but if Linus was so foolish as to publish the results of his
poorly conducted experiments he would only be "slurring
himself in print with his wide conjecture."
Meanwhile, during a rare visit to London, Newton had
been surprised at the high praise lavished on his work by
members of the Royal Society. Even the misshapen Hooke
seemed less of a threat when viewed in person. Indeed,
Newton mistakenly thought that the curator of experiments
had changed his previous notions concerning colors and was
coming around to his point of view.
60

"Kindling Coal'
The findings of Newton's daring paper "An Hypothesis Explaining the Properties of Light" were
studied at four consecutive meetings of the Royal Society.
61

Isaac Newton
Newton, who secretly craved recognition, decided to
break his vow of silence. Near the end of 1674, an elated
Oldenburg received Newton's most daring and complex
paper to date—"An Hypothesis Explaining the Properties of
Light." The Fellows were so impressed that the meetings of
December 9 and 16 were almost entirely devoted to its con-
tents. Then, following Christmas recess, its many principles
were deliberated during the meetings of December 30 and
January 13, 1675.
The truly great scientific mind distinguishes itself in
two ways: first, in its capacity for original thought; second,
in setting forth a principle by which knowledge, both old
and new, is forged into a grand design. Newton's work on
gravity during the plague years had involved more than
mathematical calculations. He was no less interested in
determining the physical cause of this perplexing phenome-
non, a subject to which he had devoted countless hours of
thought during the intervening years. Having rejected
hypothetical speculation on the part of others, he now
found himself in the awkward but exhilarating position of
defending a sweeping hypothesis of his own.
In his paper Newton postulates the existence of ether, a
medium or agent by which many forces acting on matter
throughout the universe are generated. Much less dense and
more elastic than air, ether cannot be seen or felt. And while
it is to be found everywhere, it is rarer within the dense
bodies of the sun, stars, and planets than in the vast spaces
separating them. In his mind's eye, Newton saw the Earth
and the celestial bodies as giant sponges, steadily soaking up
the stream of invisible matter that constantly presses down
upon their surfaces. This stream, he wrote, "may bear down
with it the bodies it pervades with force proportional to the
surfaces of all their parts it acts upon," the first known mus-
ings on universal gravitation. Once the ether has penetrated
into the "bowels" of a planet or star it is somehow trans-
62

"Kindling Coal'
formed and returns to space where the process repeats itself
in an endless cycle: "For nature is a perpetual circulatory
worker, generating fluids out of solids, and solids out of flu-
ids. . . . And as the Earth, so perhaps may the sun imbibe
this spirit to conserve his shining and keep the planets from
receding further from him, and . . . this spirit affords and
carries with it thither the solar fuel and material principle
of light." Newton sought to explain gravity not only in
terms of the ethereal medium but in terms of other equally
puzzling phenomena. Such phenomena included cohesion,
or the mutual attraction by which the various elements of a
body are held together, and animal sensation, or what we
now call feelings generated in the nervous system. Finally,
he filled the paper with detailed accounts of many experi-
ments designed to reinforce his soaring hypothesis.
Newton bolstered his theory in a second paper sent to
London along with the first. Titled "Discourse of
Observations," he speculated that when corpuscles of light
pass through the ether, the medium's varying density alters
the speed and direction in which the corpuscles move.
This, in turn, produces the familiar effect of reflection, or
the bending back of light, as well as the scattering phenom-
enon called diffusion. Yet colors themselves do not arise
from changes in the corpuscles. Instead, different colors are
produced when the particles are separated from one an-
other, creating the familiar spectrum.
Newton's second paper owed much to Hooke's own
treatise on light, Micrographia (The Drawing of Small
Objects), which contains an account of the colors of
thin films such as soap bubbles. But where Hooke had
relied exclusively on observation, Newton employed metic-
ulous measurements and mathematical analysis, enabling
him to take over ground first broken by the frustrated cura-
tor of experiments. In an attempt to save the day, Hooke
called for a secret meeting with a few close friends at Joe's
63

Isaac Newton
Coffee House in London, where, he later wrote in his
diary, "we began a new club." The sole topic of conversa-
tion was Newton's latest work. After the group met again
three weeks later, Hooke noted, "I showed that Mr.
Newton had taken my hypothesis of the pulse or wave."
What was described as Hooke's gray eye had suddenly
sprung to life.
The problem was not one of theft but Newton's failure
to acknowledge Hooke's work. He would likely have won
Hooke's support if only he had praised the credit-starved
experimentalist as a source of fruitful ideas. Instead, Newton
liked to think of himself as a wholly independent agent, a
self-created myth his biographer Frank Manuel termed "the
magic circle of his infallibility."
As suspicious as Hooke, Newton soon got wind of the
secret meetings from Oldenburg and fired off a letter to
London. "As for Mr. Hooke's insinuation that the sum of
the hypothesis I sent you had been delivered by him in his
Microgmphia, I need not be much concerned. I may avoid
the savor of having done anything unjustifiable or unhand-
some towards [him]." He again recounted the penetrating
nature of his insights, which Hooke had barely glimpsed. To
Hooke, Newton had become a fearsome rival; to Newton,
Hooke was an intolerable nuisance.
When Oldenburg read some of Newton's passages criti-
cizing Hooke at the Royal Society meeting of January 20,
1675, matters came to a head. The secretary had embar-
rassed Hooke once too often. Taking matters into his own
hands, Hooke wrote directly to Newton in Cambridge
about what he termed "Oldenburg kindling coal." "I do no
way approve of contention or feuding or proving in print,"
Hooke began, "and shall be very unwillingly drawn to such
kind of war." He then praised Newton's "Hypothesis
Explaining the Properties of Light," judging that "you have
gone much farther in that affair than I did." In the future
64

"Kindling Coal'
they would be better off corresponding directly with each
other so as to produce light rather than heat.
Newton's reply was no less polite. He addressed Hooke
as "his honored friend" whose "generous freedom" in writ-
ing "becomes a true philosophical spirit." There was noth-
ing he wished to avoid more than contention in print and
gladly accepted Hooke's offer to correspond privately. In
light of future developments, it is doubtful whether either
was sincere. For the moment, however, the one-time coun-
try boys were acting like courtiers—overpraising each
other, bowing, scraping, tipping their plumed hats in grand
gestures.
Four years had passed since Newton first informed the
Royal Society of his experiments with prisms. Yet, difficult
as it is to believe, neither Hooke nor anyone else had
attempted to duplicate the results before the distinguished
body. Finally, on Thursday, April 27, 1676, "a very clear
sun-shine day," Hooke followed Newton's instructions to
the letter, and the experimentum crucis was verified indepen-
dent of the question of whether light is particle or wave,
or whether ether is the mechanism by which gravity
works. Hooke, who wrote down everything else he wit-
nessed that day in his diary, including Thomas Tompion's
repair of Lady Wilkins's watch and the direction of a drain
through cellars, could not bring himself to record yet
another of Newton's triumphs. But when word of the
results reached Cambridge, Newton could not hide his
pleasure. Surely now, he wrote Oldenburg, "Mr. Linus's
friends will acquiesce."

The Alchemist
It was at the Globe Theatre, the London playhouse con-
structed in 1598, that most of William Shakespeare's dramas
were first performed by a company of actors called
Chamberlain's Men. Among the most memorable scenes
played out on the Globe's stage was one from the tragedy
Macbeth. It is set in a cave, where three witches circle a boil-
ing cauldron, chanting in unison:
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog.
To an audience of Shakespeare's time, there was nothing
unusual about witches or boiling cauldrons or the casting of
spells over a smelly brew composed of exotic ingredients.
But when it later became known that Isaac Newton, who
was born two years before the Globe burned down in 1644,
also kept a cauldron stocked with odd ingredients, it was
considered to be something of a scandal. After all, how
could the greatest of natural philosophers have fallen victim

to the practice of magic—the very superstition modern sci-
entists were seeking to stamp out?
It is almost certain that Newton's introduction to the
fire and the crucible came during his Grantham years when
he lived with the apothecary Clark. Because there were no
manufactured medicines, Clark had to prepare remedies for
his customers in a small laboratory located either in or near
his shop. That Isaac was a close observer is proven by the
many recipes recorded in his early student notebooks, in
addition to the volumes he began to collect for his personal
library.
By the mid-1660s the philosophical notebook of
Newton's Cambridge years was crammed with entries
drawn from the works of a new group of experimenters in
metals who called themselves "chymists." During an autumn
visit to London in 1669, Newton purchased two portable
furnaces and enough supplies to conduct scores of his own
experiments. Though he was only in his late 20s, his long
hair was now completely gray, prompting his roommate,
John Wickins, to remark that it was the "effect of his deep
attention of mind." An unusually merry Newton replied
that he had experimented so frequently with quicksilver, or
mercury, "as from thence he took the Colour."
Newton's laboratory adjoined his rooms and could be
seen from bustling Trinity Street a short distance away. By
the 1680s he had become so deeply involved in experiments
that he found it necessary to employ an assistant, a distant
relative named Humphrey Newton. Humphrey left a vivid
portrait of his employer, whom he described as a man pos-
sessed by his work:
So intent, so serious upon his studies that he eat very spar-
ingly, nay ofttimes he has forgot to eat at all. ...

was the most accurate, strict, exact.
But what, exactly, was Newton after? Humphrey hadn't
a clue:
What his Aim might be, I was not able to penetrate into,
but his Pains, his Diligence as those set Times made me
think he aimed at something beyond the Reach of human
Art & Industry. I cannot say I ever saw him drink, either
Wine, Ale or Beer, excepting Meals, & then but very spar-
ingly.
The truth is that Newton was neither a grand magician
nor a modern chemist, but something in between. For
many centuries learned men the world over had been seek-
ing to solve a riddle as ancient as the pyramids. Calling
themselves "alchemists," a word coined by the Arabs cen-
turies earlier to describe those who worked with chemicals,
they risked everything, including money, health, and the
welfare of their families, in quest of the so-called philoso-
pher's stone. The "stone," which was also called the "grand
elixir," the "grand magistery," and many other names, was
not a solid substance but the rarest of liquids possessed of
legendary powers. When mixed with common metals, such
as lead, it could transform them into the most precious sub-

stances; namely, silver and gold. If drunk on a regular basis,
the stone promised immortality, such as that sought in the
mythical Fountain of Youth by the 16th-century Spanish
explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. Medieval alchemists couched
their laboratory notes in cryptic writing and symbols to pro-
tect their secrets from the prying eyes of rivals. Many gained
the support of wealthy patrons who dreamed of great riches
once the secret of transformation became known.
Strange as it may seem, Isaac Newton was perhaps the
greatest alchemist of all. At his death he left hundreds upon
hundreds of handwritten pages on alchemy, in addition to a
remarkable document titled Index Chemicus (The Chemical
Index). The "Index" contains 879 headings, with at least
5,000 references to information found in scores of other
alchemical texts. In addition to his countless experiments,
Newton read everything alchemical that he could buy, beg,
or borrow, fearing that the smallest overlooked clue might
conceal the key to the universal matter that would explain
the very structure of the world. Dr. Thomas Pellet, a
respected member of the Royal Society chosen to decide
which of Newton's papers to publish after his death, was so
horrified by the venture into alchemy that he wrote in bold
letters across the wrappers: "Not fit to be printed."
A closer examination of the alchemical papers by mod-
ern scholars has led to some startling, and rather more reas-
suring, conclusions. It is now clear that Newton was not
primarily interested in getting rich or in prolonging his life,
though he sincerely believed that such things were possible.
Instead, he had to know everything there is to know about
the behavior of matter, from the smallest particle to the
grandest star. Before 1666 he had focused on what scientists
now refer to as the macrocosm, or the cosmos itself. After
1666 his interests broadened to include the microcosm, the
smallest worlds of invisible matter through which all things
in nature are formed, grow, decay, and eventually return to
their basic elements. By studying these worlds, Newton
70

believed that he could discover what light truly is, how
forces such as gravity and magnetism act across great dis-
tances, and how the theoretical ether of his experiments
triggers changes in the bodies it inhabits.
In one sense Newton was preoccupied by the very
ideas that fuel current scientific debates. Black holes,
formed by collapsed stars at the centers of galaxies, are fasci-
nating partly because their explanation promises to aid in
unifying the large and the small. The two major theories of
20th-century physics are relativity, which applies to light as
it streaks across the great expanses of trackless space, and
quantum mechanics, which seeks to comprehend invisible
worlds of micromatter. The great problem is to forge a
principle that combines both realms—the vast and the
infinitesimal. Newton was the first to attempt it; Einstein
was the second. Neither was successful and both men,
despite their marvelous achievements, went to their graves
disappointed at failing to do so. "Something beyond the
reach of human Art & Industry," as Humphrey Newton had
written.
Yet, in another sense Isaac Newton was less of a mod-
ern thinker than many would like to admit. Alchemy
was not yet the science of chemistry, nor would it become
so until the emergence of a brilliant generation of 18th-
century experimenters. These experimenters included
Joseph Priestley, Henry Cavendish, and, most important,
the Frenchman Antoine Lavoisier, who distinguished chem-
ical elements from the compounds long employed by
alchemists. Moreover, Newton's alchemy was as deeply
rooted in the past as in the present.
As an avid reader of old texts, Newton believed in a
concept called the prisca sapientia, or wisdom of the
ancients, a doctrine popular among certain scholars during
the Renaissance. This doctrine held that the great truths of
nature had been known to some of the most brilliant and
morally upright thinkers of the distant past. Such thinkers
The Alchemist
71

Isaac Newton
included the Greek philosophers Plato and Democritus, the
medieval scholars Albertus Magnus, Arnold of Villanova,
and Roger Bacon, as well as some of the most important
figures from the Bible—King Solomon, the prophet Isaiah,
and Jesus of Nazareth. Not surprisingly, these men had hid-
den their knowledge of how nature works in symbolic lan-
guage that, like a complex code, was extremely difficult to
decipher. Newton took special note of a passage from the
Book of Isaiah in which the ancient Hebrew promises
enlightenment to the true believer:
And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the
Lord, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.
In one of his many manuscripts, Newton echoes the
prophet s words by arguing that wisdom and insight are "not
only to be found in the volume of nature but also in the
sacred scriptures, as in Genesis, Job, Psalms, Isaiah & others.
In the knowledge of this Philosophy God made Solomon
the greatest philosopher in the world." Little wonder that
Newton drew up detailed plans of the great temple
Solomon constructed in Jerusalem in hopes of finding clues
to the secrets of nature in its design.
There is no doubt that Newton considered himself spe-
cially chosen to rediscover and expand the ancient wisdom,
thus becoming one of the few from each generation so
blessed. After all, he was born on Christmas Day and had
survived his premature entry into the world when everyone,
except perhaps his mother, thought he would die within
hours of his birth. He rose to the highest place at
Grantham's King's School and then, during the "miraculous
year," unraveled the secret of light, gave birth to a revolu-
tionary mathematics, and undertook calculations that would
soon elevate his musings on gravity to the realm of scientific
truth. Who else among his generation had accomplished so
much, and at such an early age? And why should his pursuit
72

The Alchemist
of alchemy not reveal even more secrets about the behavior
of matter and its effect on everything from atoms to the
stars?
Besides containing invaluable keys for unlocking what
Newton termed nature's "operations," Scripture to him
served as both a moral guide and a means of determining
what would happen in the future. The earliest clues to his
private thoughts on God are contained in the confession of
sins he penned at Cambridge when he was 19: "Not turn-
ing nearer to Thee for my affections. Not living according
to my belief. Not loving Thee for Thy self." From these
simple sentences he would go on to write an estimated
1,400,000 words on religion, more than the alchemy, more
than the mathematics, more even than the physics and
astronomy that made him immortal.
Newton came to know the Old and the New
Testaments better than most clergymen. And, as with

Jerusalem.

everything else he studied, his interpretation of Scripture
differed radically from that of others. Unlike Wickins and
his fellow scholars at Trinity College, Newton was not
ordained into the ministry of the Church of England. With
Isaac Barrow's assistance, he successfully petitioned King
Charles II to set aside the legal requirement that he take the
oath of ordination upon graduating.
By the 1670s Newton had become convinced that a
major principle embraced by the church was wrong. The
doctrine of the Trinity, to which his very college had been
dedicated by Henry VIII, was in his eyes a form of heresy.
Borrowed from the Roman Catholic Church, the
Trinitarian doctrine held that three divine figures—God the
Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit—were united in
one. Newton rejected this idea on the grounds that the
worship of three figures in one violated the First
Commandment, which states that there shall be only one
God, the Creator of the universe. To accept ordination, or
Holy Orders, would be to violate his conscience, something
he would not do.
Yet, at the same time, Newton was being less than hon-
est when he petitioned the king, for he kept his real reason
for not taking Holy Orders secret. Why he chose to lie is
easily understood: if his rejection of church doctrine was
ever discovered, he would be dismissed from Trinity
College and forced to return home to Woolsthorpe in dis-
grace, his chances of ever making a name for himself
ruined. Instead, he kept his explosive opinions to himself,
and only on occasion revealed them to an inner circle of
young admirers once he became a famous man.
Employing sacred texts, Newton compiled a dictionary
of religious terms, events, and images in a manner reminis-
cent of the Index Chemicus. He believed that biblical
prophecy, especially as set forth in the Book of Daniel in
the Old Testament and the Revelation of St. John in the
New, provided an excellent chronology of events to come.
74

Of course, the writings required interpretation and once
again Newton thought he was just the person for the job:
"Having searched after knowledge in the prophetique scrip-
tures," he wrote while he was still in his 30s, "I have
thought myself bound to communicate it for the benefit of
others." Such communication would not take place until
after his death, however, when his Observations upon the
Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John was pub-
lished in 1733. In this work he predicted that Satan's spell
would be broken and that the "fearful, and unbelieving, and
the abominable, and murderers, and sorcerers, and idolators,
and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth
with fire and brimstone." And just exactly when would this
come to pass? Never shrinking from a challenge, Newton
calculated that it would occur in the year 1867.
Since the world did not end as Newton predicted, it is
easy to dismiss his religious beliefs as little more than the
eccentric musings of an otherwise supremely rational mind.
But it must be remembered that however modern his sci-
ence may seem to us, Newton was still a man from the 17th
century, a man of his time. Unlike many thinkers today, he
saw no conflict between science and religion and wrote that
the world could not operate without God being present.
Indeed, without the Creator's periodic intervention the
universe would eventually run down, only to collapse and
explode as the planets, comets, and stars rush together as
part of the final cataclysm foretold in prophecy. Few things
would have angered or dismayed Isaac Newton more than
the claim by a later generation of thinkers that his discovery
of mechanical laws established the framework of a universe
in which God is no longer a vital, or even necessary, part.

of the work, set the price of the leatherbound volume at nine shillings. He also offered a cheaper version.

"A Book Nobody

In August 1684 a handsome young astronomer named
Edmond Halley boarded the London coach for Cambridge
and sat back to ponder the events that had sent him on an
important mission. Earlier in the year, he had entered into a
lively conversation with Robert Hooke and Sir Christopher
Wren, the noted architect of the new St. Paul's Cathedral
in London. Halley suggested that the force of attraction
between the planets and the sun decreases in inverse pro-
portion to the square of the distance between them. If this
were true, then each planet's orbit should take the form of
Kepler's ellipse, a shape like a football, though somewhat
more rounded.
Halley recalled that Hooke immediately "affirmed that
upon that principle all the Laws of the celestial motions
were to be demonstrated." Wren, who was also deeply
interested in the new science, claimed that he, too, had
reached the same conclusion. The problem, as all three
admitted, was to find the mathematical means of proving it.
Anxious for a solution, Sir Christopher offered to give
a valuable book to the friend who could deliver solid proof
within the next two months. Hooke, to whom modesty
77
7
chapter

Isaac Newton
was a stranger, claimed that he already possessed the
required proof. However, he would keep it a secret for the
time being so that his friends "might know how to value it,
when he should make it public."
The deadline came and went without a word from
Hooke, and spring soon turned to summer. Finally, after
seven months of silence, Halley decided to act. He cast an
anxious eye in the direction of Cambridge and made a fate-
ful decision. He would visit Trinity College to see if the
secretive Isaac Newton could shed some light on the matter.
Newton was living an even more isolated existence than
before. Some years earlier his mother, Hannah, had caught
what was described as a "malignant fever," a catchall term
for any number of serious illnesses. Newton hurried to
Woolsthorpe and took charge of Hannah's care, dressing her
blisters and sitting up all night at her bedside. Unfortunately,
she was beyond saving and died some days later. As her first
child, Isaac inherited most of her property, making him an
independently wealthy man.
A more recent blow was the departure from Cambridge
of John Wickins, Newton's roommate of 20 years. Wickins
became minister of the parish church at Stoke Edith, mar-
ried, and fathered a son named Nicholas. Though they had
been through much together, the two friends would never
meet again and exchanged no more than a letter or two in
the coming years.
Newton's prescription for loneliness was work, work,
and more work. Humphrey Newton observed: "I never saw
him take any Recreation or Pastime, either in Riding out to
take the Air, Walking, Bowling, or any other Exercise what-
ever, Thinking all Hours lost that was not spent in his
Studies, to which he kept so close that he seldom left his
Chamber." The reclusive professor had even more time to
himself because Cambridge students were little interested in
natural philosophy. Humphrey noted that his employer
78

"A Book Nobody Understands'
often lectured to the classroom walls. Finally, he stopped
going to the lecture hall altogether.
Over the years, Newton became the very model of the
absent-minded professor. He ate little and often had to be
reminded by Humphrey that the dinner delivered to his
room had gone untouched. He would express surprise,
walk over to the table, and eat a bite or two standing up. "I
cannot say," Humphrey noted, that "I ever saw Him sit at
[the] Table by himself."
Newton rarely went to bed until two or three in the
morning and often slept in his clothes. He rose at five or
six, fully refreshed. His long, silver hair was seldom
combed, his stockings hung loose, and his shoes were down
at the heels. On those rare occasions when he went out, it
was usually to take a meal in the dining hall, overlooked by
the giant portrait of Henry VIII.
But instead of crossing the Great Court, as he should
have, Humphrey noted that Newton would turn into
Trinity Street, stop after realizing his mistake, turn back,
and then "sometimes without going into the Hall return to
his Chamber again."
In good weather Newton was occasionally seen taking a
stroll in his garden. Picking up a stick, he drew figures on
the graveled walks, which the other Fellows sidestepped for
fear of ruining a work of genius. According to Humphrey,
"When he has some Times taken a turn or two he has
made a sudden stand, turn'd himself about, run up the Stairs
like another Archimedes, and with a eureka fallen to write
on his Desk standing, without giving himself the Leisure to
draw a chair to sit down on." So absorbed was Newton that
he lost track of time and place. The days and dates on many
of the papers recording his experiments do not match those
of the calendar.
As he stepped down from his coach on reaching
Cambridge, Halley hardly knew what to expect. He had

exchanged no letters with Newton and had met him only
once before, in London. Furthermore, Hookes name was
bound to come up. Despite their mutual pledge not to kin-
dle any more coal, Newton and Hooke were still feuding
over scientific matters both great and small.
To Halley's surprise, and great relief, Newton was flat-
tered by his visit. They talked of many things before the
astronomer revealed his reason for seeking Newton out.
What kind of curve, Halley finally asked, "would be
described by the planets supposing the force of attraction
towards the sun to be reciprocal to the square of their dis-
tance from it?"
Without hesitation, Newton responded that it would be
an ellipse! Taken aback, Halley asked him how he knew it.
"I have calculated it," Newton replied.
When Halley asked to see the calculations, Newton
began rummaging through stacks of papers while his ex-
cited visitor held his breath. As luck would have it, he was
unable to find the critical documents, forc-
ing Halley to depart without the written
proof he required. However, all was not
lost. Before they parted company, Newton
promised to redo his calculations and send
them on to Halley in London.
Once again Halley's patience was
sorely tested. Three months passed without
a single word from Cambridge. What
Halley did not know was that Newton had
solved the problem of the elliptical orbit by
employing a different mathematical
method than before, but he was not satis-
fied. He spent much of those three months
working on a nine-page manuscript titled
De Motu Corporum in Gyrum (On the
Motion of Revolving Bodies). Finally, in
80

"A Book Nobody Understands"
November 1684, nearly 11 months after Halley, Hooke, and
Wren had taken part in the discussion that had started it all,
a copy of De Motu was delivered to London.
Halley was astounded, for he held in his hands the
mathematical seeds of a general science of dynamics—the
study of the relationship between motion and the forces
that affect it. Not wasting a moment, he headed north to
Newton's initial draft of
De Motu, the work that
laid the groundwork for
the Principia.
81

Isaac Newton
Cambridge a second time. He must find out whether
Newton would agree to have his paper set before the Royal
Society and published for all the scientific world to see.
On December 10, Halley rose to address his fellow
members of the Royal Society and its new president,
Samuel Pepys. He gave an account of his most recent visit
with Newton and of a "curious treatise," De Motu. Halley s
report was duly recorded in the minutes, and he was urged
to push Newton to publish his little work as soon as
possible.
At first Newton may have thought of De Motu as an
end in itself. But once his creative powers were loosed,
there was no checking their momentum. "Now that I am
upon this subject," he wrote Halley in January 1685, "I
would gladly know the bottom of it before I publish my
papers." In his mind's eye De Motu would serve as the germ
of his masterpiece, the greatest book of science ever
written.
Thus began 18 months of the most intense labor in the
history of science. In April 1686 Newton presented and
dedicated to the Royal Society the first third of his illustri-
ous work. He titled it Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philos-
ophy), commonly referred to as the Principia. A month later
the Fellows agreed that the society should pay the cost of
the book's publication, but that decision was reversed two
weeks later when it was reported that the treasury was
empty. The members turned to Halley, who agreed to
finance publication out of his own pocket and to act as the
difficult Newton's editor.
It was a fortunate choice. No sooner had Newton pre-
sented his first installment than Robert Hooke raised his all
too familiar cry of theft. He claimed to have discovered the
inverse square law six years earlier, which he communicated
in a letter to Newton. While it is true that Hooke had cor-
82

"A Book Nobody Understands"
rected a rare blunder Newton made regarding the path of a
falling body, this was a far cry from proving that the greater
the distance between a planet and the sun the less intense
the gravitational attraction between them. In addressing
Hooke's claim that Newton had stolen from him, the 18th-
century French scientist Alexis Claude Clairaut later
observed, "what a distance there is between a truth that is
glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated."
Newton was predictably outraged when word of
Hooke's charge reached him in Cambridge. He immedi-
ately dashed off an angry letter to Halley in which he
threatened to withhold the rest of the Principia. "Philosophy
[science] is such an impertinently litigous Lady," he wrote,
"that a man had as good be engaged in lawsuits, as have to
do with her. I found it so formerly, and now I am no
sooner come near to her again, but she gives me warning."
Tall, dark-eyed, soft of face and manner, Halley was a
presence pleasing to almost everyone. Despite many frustra-
tions, his treatment of Newton was unwavering, ever polite
and respectful from their first meeting to their last letter, a
relationship destined to endure 40 years. He moved swiftly
to calm the troubled waters. All Hooke desired, Halley
wrote Newton, was to be mentioned in the preface of the
Principia. It would be a fine gesture on Newton's part, and
one that would cost him nothing. A still infuriated Newton
reacted by going over his manuscript and crossing out every
reference to Hooke. With that the storm passed and
Newton agreed to go ahead with publication.
The Principia was not an easy book to read in Newton's
day, nor is it now. After it was published, Newton was
passed on the street by a student who is said to have
remarked, "There goes the man that writt a book that nei-
ther he nor anybody else understands." The same would be
said of Einstein when his papers on the theory of relativity
were published some 250 years later.
83

Isaac Newton
As noted, the Principia consists of three books, the first
of which deals with problems of motion involving no fric-
tion or resistance. Book II is concerned with the motions
of fluids and the effect of friction on the motions of
solid bodies in fluids. Important though these books are,
it is Book III, entitled System of the World, that most con-
cerns us.
According to Newton's first law, "Every body continues
in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line,
unless it is compelled to change that state by forces
impressed upon it." As we have seen, Galileo was actually
the first to formulate this principle. Taking up where the
Italian left off, Newton recast and incorporated this princi-
ple into his own system of mechanics, or the behavior of
matter. Thus if no outside force acts on a body, it will con-
tinue to move at a constant speed in the same direction. If
left alone, therefore, a planet will orbit the sun eternally.
Yet the planets, as Newton had demonstrated mathe-
matically, circle the sun, tracing out elliptical orbits. Why is
it that they do not move off into space in a straight line, as
would be expected according to his first law? This is where
Newton's second law comes into play: "The change of
motion [of a body] is proportional to the motive force
impressed; and is made in the direction of the straight line
in which that force is impressed." Stated in less rigorous
terms, this law tells us that the orbiting planet is pulled at a
right angle toward the sun. Its natural tendency to move
outward into space, or what Christiaan Huygens called its
"centrifugal" force, is perfectly balanced by the sun's inward
pull, or what Newton termed "centripetal" force. One of
the best ways to illustrate this principle is to whirl an object
on a rope or a string over one's head. The object can be
likened to a planet, the anchoring hand to the sun, while
the string acts as the "force" that keeps the object from fly-
ing off on line into the blue.
84

"A Book Nobody Understands'
But what of the string itself? No such visible tether
binds a planet to the sun. Enter Newton's third law, which
was uniquely his own: "To every action there is always
opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual action of two
bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to
contrary parts." Hence, if one body acts upon another at a
distance, the second also acts on the first with an equal and
opposite force. The moon pulls the Earth with the same
force with which the Earth pulls the moon. This is equally

Isaac Newton
true of the Earth and an apple, except that in this instance
the force exerted causes the apple to visibly change its posi-
tion, while the Earth, because of its far greater size, seems
totally unaffected. With these three laws of motion,
Newton founded the branch of modern physics we call
dynamics.
The genius of Newton's achievement becomes clearer
when we focus on the third law. Gravity acting at a distance
could no longer be thought of as something peculiar to the
sun and the planets; it applies to every object in existence,
no matter how large or how small. As a universal property
of all bodies, its force is dependent solely on the amount of
matter each body contains. Or, as Newton announced in
Proposition VII of Book III: "Every particle of matter
attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the
product of the masses and inversely proportional to the
square of the distances between them." With this elegant
principle, he had made the universe a "democracy" by
treating all objects as equals. Everything—from the smallest
of atoms to the largest of planets—obeys the same unchang-
ing law, as profound a thought as has ever crossed a human
mind.
Newton was ready now to demonstrate how the law of
universal gravitation accounts for phenomena that had puz-
zled the greatest minds in history for centuries. Or, in his
words, "to admit no more causes of natural things than are
both true and sufficient to explain their appearances."
He focused his attention on Saturn's orbit of the sun,
which he had attempted to calculate accurately for several
years. Had it only been a matter of determining the mutual
attraction of two bodies, the solution would have been rela-
tively easy. But, as Newton well knew, the problem is com-
plicated by the fact that Saturn's movement is influenced by
other bodies as well, most notably its neighboring planet
Jupiter. Although the sun, which contains a thousand times
86

"A Book Nobody Understands'
more matter than all the planets put together, is the solar
system's dominant body, Jupiter is sufficiently large to pro-
duce small changes, or perturbations, in Saturn's orbit. Thus
while Saturn follows an elliptical path around the sun, it
wavers slightly during its journey, much as a drunken sailor.
Even Newton, armed as he was with the calculus, could
not come up with anything more than a general solution to
what is called "the three-bodied problem," one of the most
difficult in physics. Indeed, he once remarked that trying to
resolve it made his head ache, which he treated by tying a
band of cloth around his head and twisting it with a stick
until the reduced circulation dulled the pain. His pioneer-
ing study of planetary perturbation was refined over the
decades until, in 1846, the planet Neptune was discovered
by means of its gravitational pull on Uranus, the first such
body to be discovered on the basis of theoretical calcula-
tions alone.
No less intriguing to Newton were the marked irregu-
larities in the moon's orbit, a phenomenon that had puzzled
astronomers for centuries. While the lunar orbit is dictated
by the pull of Earth, it too is influenced by the enormous
mass of the sun. And unlike the perturbations of the plan-
ets, those of the moon are both more numerous and more
pronounced. By employing a complex system of calcula-
tions, Newton was able to account for most of these major
disturbances. He did the same for Jupiter and its satellites,
which Galileo had discovered in 1609 while gazing through
his homemade telescope.
Among the more interesting deductions found in the
Principia is Newton's assertion that the Earth and the other
planets are oblate bodies. This means that they are flattened
somewhat at their poles, or axes, and bulge to some degree
at their equators, much like a balloon when gently pressed
between one's palms. In terms of Earth, the equatorial
bulge means the planet's surface is a few miles higher at its
87

Isaac Newton
central belt than at the North and South Poles, a seemingly
small difference but one fraught with significant implications.
Elsewhere in the Principia, Newton had demonstrated
that a perfect sphere attracts another body as if its mass were
concentrated at its center. However, oblate bodies, such as
Earth, do not. This means that the intensity of the planet's
gravitational field will not be exactly the same everywhere.
The Earth pulls and is in turn pulled by the moon with a
slightly off-center attraction, the line of pull being strongest
at the equatorial bulge, where matter is most concentrated.
In effect we are dealing with a giant top slightly overloaded
on one side. This causes the planet's axis to change its angle
of rotation very slowly, so as to trace out the shape of a cone
in the heavens. Astronomers call this "the precession of the
equinoxes." It was first observed by Hipparchus, a Greek
astronomer of the late 2nd century B.C., but its explanation
defied solution by the best of minds, including a deeply
frustrated Copernicus. Newton undertook the calculation
of this conical motion, which he accurately attributed to
the slightly off-center attractions of the moon. He found
that it takes 26,000 years for the Earth's axis to complete the
cone. Once again genius had triumphed by explaining a
mystifying phenomenon and calculating the time frame in
which it occurs, a far cry from the simple suggestion that an
apple falls to the ground because the Earth attracts it.
Of all the riddles that bedeviled astronomers, none had
proved more baffling than the eternal rise and fall of the
seas. Isaac Newton ended their frustration with a stroke of
his pen: "That the flux and reflux of the sea arise from the
actions of the sun and moon." By applying the law of gravi-
tation to the problem, Newton found that the power of
attraction is greater on the waters facing the attracting body
than on the Earth as a whole, and greater on the Earth as a
whole than on the waters on the opposite side. Because of
the moon's nearness to Earth (240,000 vs. 93,000,000 miles
88

"A Book Nobody Understands'
for the sun), the satellite's gravitational pull gives rise to the
main tides. Its chief effect is to cause a pair of waves, or
ocean humps, of tremendous area to travel around the Earth
once in a lunar day, or a little less than 25 hours. The sun's
attraction produces a similar but lower pair of waves that
circle Earth once in a solar day of 24 hours. The effect of
these two pairs of waves periodically overtaking each other
accounts for the spring and neap tides. The spring tides, the
more marked of the two, occur when the sun, moon, and
Earth are in a line and exert a maximum gravitational pull.
The weaker neap tides result when the sun and moon
pull at right angles to each other. While Newton's calcula-
tions were not refined enough to accurately predict the
height of a tide at any given place in the world, another
tremendous advance in scientific knowledge was his to
claim.
As a young man, Newton had written of staying up
all night to watch comets, and of becoming ill for lack of
rest. Until shortly before his birth, these mysterious visitors
had been regarded as nothing more than vaporous exhala-
tions from Earth released into the higher regions of the
atmosphere. More recently, comets were thought of as
independent celestial bodies, but no one had been able to
account for their seemingly irregular movements across the
midnight sky.
Believing comets to be composed of solid matter,
Newton reasoned that they must be subject to the same
gravitational forces as the planets. Yet when he employed
observational data collected in part by the astronomer
royal, John Flamsteed, with whom he quarreled almost as
violently as he did with Hooke, he found that the motions
of comets were much more complex than those of the
planetary bodies. As a result, he set out to prove that besides
elliptical orbits, celestial bodies could move in paths tracing
out sharper curves than previously imagined. He soon gave

observations of comets to

ories.
substance to this conjecture by determining that comets
"move in some of the conic sections" about the sun. The
natural philosopher then plotted the curve of the so-called
Great Comet of 1681.
Based on what he read in the Principia, Halley was
attracted to cometary theory as well. The gifted astronomer
took particular interest in the orbit of another brilliant
comet, which he had closely observed in 1682. Then,
through a painstaking search of past records worthy of
Newton himself, he found that there had been similar sight-
ings in 1607 and 1531, or about once every 75 years. Could
not these sightings, Halley thought to himself, indicate the
periodic return of the same object? He calculated the orbit
on the assumption that it was, and predicted its return in
1758, give or take a year. The streaming body, which now
bears Halley s name, was first observed on Christmas Day,
1758 (the 116th anniversary of Newton's birth), by an ama-
teur astronomer named George Palitsch. Like clockwork,
Halley s comet has since shown up three more times, reaf-
firming Newton's reduction of yet another great mystery to
mathematical rule.
When we step back and look at Newton's universe
from afar, what is it, exactly, that we see? According to the
90

"A Book Nobody Understands'
Principia, we peer into a seemingly endless void of which
only a tiny part is occupied by material bodies moving
through the boundless and bottomless abyss. Newton's fol-
lowers would liken it to a colossal machine, much like the
clocks located on the faces of medieval buildings. All
motions are reduced to mechanical laws, a universe where
human beings and their world of the senses have no effect.
Yet for all its lack of feeling, it is a realm of precise, harmo-
nious, and rational principles. Mathematical laws bind each
particle of matter to every other particle, barring the gate to
disorder and chaos. By flinging gravity across the void, Isaac
Newton united physics and astronomy in a single science of
matter in motion, fulfilling the dreams of Pythagoras,
Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and countless others in
between. And while Newton was unable to discover the
true cause of gravity itself, a giant riddle still, the laws he
formulated provide convincing proof that we inhabit an
orderly and knowable universe.

The book that supposedly nobody could understand was
finally published in July 1687. Halley, who had put up his
own money to see it through the press, set the price of the
leatherbound volume at nine shillings, a bargain, consider-
ing the riches between its elegant covers. Not satisfied, he
offered a second and cheaper version of the work in hopes
that more people would read the revolutionary treatise. So
awed was the astronomer that he paid its author yet another
compliment. He wrote a poem titled "Ode to Newton"
and inserted it at the beginning of the Principia. Its final line
speaks volumes: "Nearer to the gods no mortal may
approach."
Halley s sentiments were soon echoed by others. From
Scotland the noted mathematics professor David Gregory
wrote Newton that "you justly deserve the admiration of
the best Geometers and Naturalists, in this and all succeed-
ing ages." A stunned French mathematician, the Marquis de
1'Hopital, asked his English friend Dr. John Arbuthnot,

Sir Godfrey Kneller, the most popular portrait painter of his time, produced the first portrait of Newton
in 1689, when Newton was 46.

Isaac Newton
"Does Newton eat & drink and sleep? Is he like other
men?" Another young teacher of mathematics named
Abraham de Moivre, who was destined to become a disciple
of Newton, sought to master the Principia by stuffing his
pockets with pages torn from the book, which he read
while traveling from one pupil's home to another. Some of
the highest praise came from Newton's small social circle,
such as the aging Dr. Humphrey Babington, a fellow citizen
of Lincolnshire and a Trinity College scholar. After
wrestling with the scientific masterpiece for several weeks,
Babington remarked that learned men "might study seven
years before they understood anything of it."
Despite his hard-earned fame, Newton continued his
secretive ways. His normally fitful correspondence dwindled
to less than a trickle. Only rarely did he emerge from the
cocoon of his study to visit London or his Woolsthorpe
property, where his tenants took advantage of his long
absences by allowing the buildings and fences to fall into
ruin. Rents were overdue by as much as three years, but the
landlord was so well off that it little mattered.
Events took a sudden turn on January 15, 1689, when
the Cambridge University senate met to elect two delegates
to the so-called Convention Parliament. The previous year
King James II, who hoped to restore Catholicism to
England, was forced to flee to France during a political
struggle known as the Glorious Revolution. Respected for
his anti-Catholic views as well as his intellect, Newton
gained a seat in the new Parliament. A week later he was in
London, where he took his place in the House of
Commons at daybreak.
Sensing the historic importance of the moment,
Newton arranged to have his portrait done by Godfrey
Kneller, the principal painter of the day. At age 46 the
subject is at the height of his mental powers and on the
threshold of international fame. His silver hair is thick and
flowing, his eyes piercing, his angular chin resolute. The

long, thick fingers of Newton's right hand, which are visi-
ble from beneath his academic gown, seem more like those
of a performer of music than a scientist and shaper of gad-
gets. Kneller portrayed supreme confidence crowned by
genius—a mortal who, in Halley's words, had truly
approached the gods.
Newton voted with the parliamentary majority in
declaring the English throne vacant. Within days Prince
William of Orange, a province of the Netherlands, was
crowned King William III of England. William's wife,
Mary, the Protestant daughter of the exiled James II, was
crowned queen. The monarchs paraded through the streets
of London to the cheers of the multitude, while Newton
and his fellow members of Parliament marched respectfully
behind. In the weeks that followed, Parliament laid the basis
of a constitutional monarchy, limiting the power of the
throne and granting religious freedom to all Christians,
except Catholics and those who opposed the doctrine of
the Trinity, a matter on which Newton wisely remained
silent. Most important, Parliament enacted the Bill of
Rights, which would become a model for the first 10
amendments to the United States Constitution. Among its
provisions was the right of Englishmen to petition their
government for a redress of grievances, freedom from

excessive fines and bail, a prohibition against cruel punish-
ments, and the guarantee that taxes could be raised only
with the consent of Parliament. The long-standing belief
that the king was chosen by God and thus responsible to
God alone had been dealt a deathblow.
Having personally reduced the motion of matter to a
single universal law, Newton participated in the most
important session of Parliament in English history. The
branches of government, like the planets, were being bal-
anced for the first time. Still the records of these delibera-
tions contain not a single reference to him. According to a
frequently repeated story, he spoke but once, and that was to
ask an usher to close a window because of a chilling draft.
Yet the year Newton passed in London had seen a
change in the man. He spent time in the company of his
fellow natural philosophers at the Royal Society and made a
number of influential friends. Among these was the political
philosopher John Locke, whose writings on constitutional
government had won him the reputation as a champion of
liberty. The parliamentary leader Charles Montague, better
known as Lord Halifax, also befriended Newton, as did the
visiting Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who appar-
ently bore no grudge over the harsh criticism Newton lev-
eled at him in 1673 for disagreeing with his theory of light.
Indeed, Newton and Huygens became involved in a
minor scheme to further Newton's interests. The provost of
King's College at Cambridge was dying, and Newton's
friends persuaded him to apply for the post. Accompanied
by Huygens, he met with the new king to present his case.
The royal audience went well, and it appeared that Newton
would be awarded the position, never again having to speak
into the dimness of an empty lecture hall. Then it was dis-
covered that the incoming provost of King's must have taken
Holy Orders and be a Fellow of the college. Because
Newton met neither of these qualifications the position was
denied him. He returned to Trinity College in February
96

"Your Most Unfortunate Servant"
1690 a disappointed man, but one with high con-
nections and a new appreciation for the world
beyond his quiet university town.
A brisk correspondence between
Newton and Locke was launched in the
months that followed and continued until
the latter's death in 1704. Proof that
Newton had his eye on another position is
contained in his query to Locke regarding
the Earl of Monmouth, an influential sup-
porter of the new government and king.
Locke had asked Monmouth's assistance in
finding his friend a public post, or preferment,
as it was commonly known. Unfortunately for
Newton, the political winds had shifted in London and
nothing could be done, at least for the moment. A second
scheme involved Locke's intimate friends Sir Francis and
Lady Masham. Newton and Locke visited Oates, the
Mashams' estate in Essex, to set forth Newton's case. This
strategy also came to nothing, leaving Newton embarrassed
and bitter.
Newton and Locke had been joined at Essex by a third
person, the young Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de
Duillier. Newton had met Fatio in London, and their
friendship soon developed into the most emotional attach-
ment of Newton's adult life. Fatio was no less taken by the
author of the Principia. Whereas Halley had likened
Newton to the gods, Fatio believed him to be one.
If one is to judge by his only portrait, Fatio was far
from a handsome man. His face is dominated by a great
Roman nose, made even more prominent by a high,
sweeping forehead, small mouth, and rather sharply pointed
chin. Only the eyes are compelling: keen and intelligent,
they seem capable of transfixing anyone.
Fatio wrote his old philosophy teacher back in Geneva
that Newton was both the greatest mathematician ever to

have lived and the most worthy gentleman as
well. He hoped to become a citizen of England
and reside with the natural philosopher from
whom he could learn "pure truth." If only he
had the money he would erect a monument to
his friend, a testament to future generations
that at least one Newton admirer recognized
his true worth.
Newton and Fatio met several times during
the next few years. A typical visit had Newton
taking the coach to London, his mathematical
and religious papers in hand, where an anxious
Fatio awaited his arrival at a comfortable inn.
Newton gave his young friend access to his most private
writings, including those which, if published, would have
seen him declared a heretic. Such trust was rare for Newton.
The only others to gain access to his innermost thoughts
were Locke and a small number of young disciples, such as
the Cambridge mathematician William Whiston.
It did not take long before Fatio began to regard
Newton as a private possession. He tested the bond between
them by faking illness and then asking special favors of his
friend, which an anguished Newton willingly granted.
Worse yet, Fatio confused Newton's genius with his own
mental skills. He would later claim, much to the amusement
of anyone who would listen, that he had found the cause of
gravity and that Newton had confirmed it. This was non-
sense pure and simple, and it may have contributed to the
eventual severing of the friendship.
It was against this emotionally charged background that
Newton decided to have one last try at alchemy. In the
spring and summer of 1693 he completed five chapters of a
manuscript on the multiplication of metals. For a brief while
the secret of the ages seemed within his grasp. He watched
transfixed as gold mixed with a special mercury swelled on
being exposed to fire. But something was wrong. The
98

"Your Most Unfortunate Servant"
amount of gold supposedly feeding off the more common-
place mercury had not increased after all. Newton crossed
out several passages of his projected treatise and tried again.
And again he failed. Finally, after working at the ragged
edge for months, the work was abandoned forever.
In September 1693 Samuel Pepys, who had served as
president of the Royal Society while Halley was seeing the
Principia through the press, received a distressing letter. "I
am extremely troubled at the embroilment I am in,"
Newton wrote, "and have neither ate nor slept well this
twelve month, nor have my former consistency of mind. I
never designed to get anything by your interest, nor by
King James's favor, but am now sensible that I must with-
draw from your acquaintance, and see neither you nor the
rest of my friends any more."
Pepys was not only deeply shaken but innocent of
Newton's accusations. By this time James II had been in
exile for years and Pepys wielded no influence at the court
of William III.
Three days later, John Locke received an even more dis-
turbing and vengeful letter from his Cambridge friend.
Newton accused him of attempting to "embroil me with
women." When he had been informed that Locke was ill,
Newton replied, "twere better if you were dead." He had
also taken Locke for an "atheist" and charged him, as he
had Pepys, with unscrupulous dealings in his attempt to
gain preferment. Newton signed himself "your most hum-
ble & most unfortunate Servant."
The only good thing about the letter was its conclu-
sion, in which Newton begged his friend's forgiveness. A
deeply concerned Locke wrote back immediately: "Give
me leave to assure you that I am more ready to forgive you
than you can be to desire it." Newton, who by now was
feeling much better, attempted to explain himself in a sec-
ond letter. The previous winter he had gotten into an "ill
habit" of sleeping by the fire. His health suffered and he
99

Isaac Newton
then caught "a distemper which this summer has been epi-
demical [and] put me further out of order." When he first
wrote Locke he "had not slept an hour a night for a fort-
night [two weeks] together and for 5 nights together not a
wink."
Just to be certain that Newton was his old self again,
Pepys and Locke asked their mutual friend John Millington,
a Fellow of Cambridge's Magdalene College, to pay a call
on Newton. Millington was happy to report that Newton
seemed normal, if a bit depressed. During this visit, Newton
confessed to writing Pepys "a very odd letter" for which he
was "very much ashamed." As in his recent letter to Locke,
he blamed his temporary derangement on a prolonged lack
of sleep and a bout of distemper, a general term then used
to describe many kinds of illnesses.
Few scholars have taken Newton at his word, and vari-
ous theories have been advanced to explain this dark pas-
sage. In fact, Newton had been through what may have
been a similar, though less severe, episode many years
before. As a student, he had stayed up all night watching
comets and became ill for lack of sleep.
But that is hardly the whole story. One theory holds
that Newton took leave of his senses because many of his
irreplaceable papers were destroyed in a fire. The supposed
culprit was his pet dog named Diamond, who overturned a
candle in Newton's chambers, causing his master to exclaim,
"O Diamond! Diamond! thou little knowest the mischief
done!" The problem is that Newton never owned a dog at
Cambridge, or for that matter a cat. And had there been a
destructive fire, word of it would have almost surely gotten
out.
A more plausible explanation is the much discussed
theory of poisoning by lead and mercury, two metals com-
monly found in Newton's crucibles. The trembling Mad
Hatter of Alice in Wonderland fame was a victim of lead poi-
soning, as were his fellow hatmakers who used considerable
100

"Your Most Unfortunate Servant'
amounts of the metal in their trade. Besides uncontrollable
tremors, regular exposure to lead and mercury causes loos-
ening of the teeth, darkening of the nails, weight loss, jaun-
dice or a yellowing of the skin, sluggishness, and early
aging. As it happened, Newton displayed none of these
symptoms. His handwriting from the period is as steady as a
rock; though he lived to be 84, he lost only a single perma-
nent tooth; he loved sweets and gained weight as he got
older; and he aged more slowly than many of his friends.
Most important of all, once heavy metals enter the body
they remain for the rest of the victim's life. Though
Newton breathed in more than his share of them, he was
strong enough to withstand their presence without showing
any symptoms. Otherwise, he would have taken ill again and
again, becoming increasingly disabled as the years passed.
It is more than likely that Newton's illness resulted from
a combination of several factors, both physical and mental.
Humphrey Newton vividly described how his employer
scarcely slept while undertaking alchemical experiments. In
1693 Newton was working at a fever pitch. Moreover, after
some initial success, his experiments were yielding nothing
but frustration. To one who had already unlocked many of
nature's greatest secrets, this was both a depressing and fear-
some thought—an Isaac Newton who had reached the limit
of his powers.
Moreover, Newton, as he informed Locke, had been
ailing on and off for a year. It seems more than a coinci-
dence that his friend Fatio also claimed to be ill during this
same period. Then, for some unknown reason, Newton
suddenly broke off their friendship and would have little to
do with the young man for as long as he lived. This, too,
occurred about the time he wrote his pathetic letters to
Pepys and Locke. Thus Newton's mind was still intact, but
his spirit was no longer willing. He who had attempted to
rise above human art and industry now longed to leave his
beloved Cambridge, the sooner the better.

In September 1695 Isaac Newton suddenly disappeared
from Cambridge without explanation. He returned two
weeks later but told no one where he had been. Rumors
began to circulate that he had secretly gone to London,
where he finally secured the government post that his
friend John Locke had been unable to deliver. These
rumors were given substance in late November when the
mathematician John Wallis wrote Edmond Halley from
Oxford: "We are told here Newton is made Master of the
Mint: which, if so, I do congratulate him." Halley, who had
kept in touch with Newton, was aware that negotiations
were under way, and that Newton's cause was being cham-
pioned by his ally Charles Montague, a powerful political
figure who had the king's ear. Halley also knew that Wallis
was somewhat misinformed. Newton was not a candidate
for the position of master of the mint but rather that of
warden, or second in command. In March 1696, Montague
again summoned Newton to London. If all went well, the
appointment would be his together with the handsome
salary of five or six hundred pounds per year. Without even
pausing to draft a reply, Newton boarded the coach for

position. Three years later he took over the top job, master of the mint..

the capital and his long-awaited audience with King
William III.
No account of the meeting survives, doubtless because
there was nothing special about the occasion—except of
course to Isaac Newton, the son of an illiterate yeoman.
The warrant confirming his appointment was drafted two
days later. He quickly returned to Cambridge and set about
packing trunks with the accumulation of 35 years' hard
labor, including thousands of pages of manuscripts contain-
ing millions of words of correspondence, mathematics,
optics, alchemy, and religious writings. Such was his haste
that he left many personal possessions behind, including his
furniture and alchemical equipment. These things were
never reclaimed and comprised something of a Newton
museum. His rooms were proudly shown to visitors long
after his death with the boast that every relic was preserved
down to the smallest detail.
As a result of the Great Fire of 1666, the London of
merry old England was no more. Upon its ashes had arisen a
teeming, overcrowded city of some 750,000 souls, second in
population only to Paris among Europe's major urban cen-
ters. Stretching from Tower Hill to the Houses of Parliament
in Westminster, the city grew up along a great boulevard
connected by London Bridge, the only span across the river
Thames. This sprawling waterway, which drains into the
North Sea, ebbs and flows with the tides, and was forever
crowded with hundreds of ships and countless smaller craft,
the latter providing a speedier and safer means of transporta-
tion than the city streets. But in late autumn and winter,
piercing mists and thick fogs rolled off the river's foul
waters, mixed with the hovering smoke from countless
chimneys, and filled the streets with a brown, poisonous
cloud that drove all but the foolhardy and desperate indoors.
Much of London's work was done by a rough-and-
tumble population of fiercely independent cockneys who
inhabited the East End—watermen, porters, dockmen, and
104

Mark of the Lion
day laborers. Above them was a middle class of shopkeepers
and artisans. At the top of the social order stood the wealthy
merchants, bankers, and political officials, who resided in
the best neighborhoods where squalor and congestion were
kept at arm's length.
Beyond the old city walls first erected by the Romans,
who named their frontier outpost Londinium, dwelt the
huge underclass comprised of the poor, the frequently
homeless, and the criminal, hopeless men and women with
whom Newton would soon have reason to deal on a regular
basis. By the tens of thousands they occupied unsanitary
shacks facing dark and dangerous passages choked with
garbage and human waste pitched from glassless windows
above. Here, in the so-called Liberties, violence walked
hand in hand with the crudest of pleasures, while the pow-
ers of the lord mayor and the constables counted for little.
Public floggings seldom discouraged illegal conduct, nor did
the regular executions, despite the fact that they drew vast,
jostling crowds on "Hanging Day." Those condemned to
die were borne amid jeering throngs from Newgate Prison
to Tyburn, the place of execution at one corner of Hyde
Park. The wealthy paid handsomely for choice seats on the
wooden galleries surrounding the gallows; the remainder of
the crowd pressed forward in hopes of gaining a clearer
view of the spectacle. Those convicted of state crimes such
as treason were beheaded by John "Jack" Ketch, the infa-
mous executioner of the day. Death on the gallows was the
penalty for forgers, and it fell to the warden of the mint to
supply the evidence needed to convict those who counter-
feited the king's coin.
The royal mint was located in one of England's most
forbidding and historic structures—the great Tower of
London—a massive limestone fortress situated atop a hill on
the north bank of the Thames. The tower's soaring walls
were guarded by a moat, which was still flooded in
Newton's day. Once behind this outer line of defense, the
105

Isaac Newton
visitor encounters a second tower-ringed wall, but of even
greater height than the first. Inside the second wall are the
soldiers' barracks, storehouses for powder and arms, and
other buildings dating from the Middle Ages. At the center
of it all stands the keep, or dungeon, known as White
Tower. Constructed in the time of William the Conqueror,
who had successfully invaded England in 1066, White
Tower once served as the court of Plantagenet kings born
and nurtured within its mighty walls.
Through the centuries, the Tower of London was home
to England's most famous prisoners. The future Queen
Elizabeth I, daughter of Henry VIII, had entered through
Traitor's Gate while still a princess and wept against the
tower's stone walls before regaining her freedom. Her
father's luckless wives and political servants had suffered far
worse. Ann Boleyn, Catherine Howard, Thomas Cromwell,
and Sir Thomas More all breathed their last on Tower Green
after enduring miserable confinements. Nor, after she
became queen, did Elizabeth herself shrink from her duty as
she saw it. Lord Essex, once among her court favorites, met
his God on Tower Green at the hands of the axman, while
the swashbuckling explorer Sir Walter Raleigh, who had
supplied her majesty with captured treasure, spent three long
imprisonments in the tower on her orders.
Like all employees of the mint, Newton took the oath
of secrecy, pledging not to reveal how new coins were made
in hopes of keeping forgers in the dark. By 1695 counter-
feiting had become so widespread that every English coin in
circulation was to be replaced by a freshly minted one. This
monumental task required mint employees to work double
shifts and led to the opening of branch mints in other parts
of the country. Under the new warden s watchful eye, rivers
of gold and silver coins began pouring forth from the lum-
bering stamping machines. And with his superior Thomas
Neale frequently absent, Newton quickly became master of
the mint in everything but name.
106

Mark of the Lion
Still he could not savor his success until he had
dealt with a colorful rogue whose rare but misused gifts
nearly proved a match for his own. William Chaloner was a
natural-born swindler and cunning forger who first made
his way in London by fashioning worthless tin watches,
which he sold in the streets for whatever he could get. He
soon formed a partnership with another swindler, and
together they alternately passed themselves off as fortune
tellers and respectable doctors. Chaloner next bribed a
craftsman to teach him the secret of enameling wood in the
Japanese manner. He then applied this knowledge to the
study of metals and was soon able to make counterfeit coins
that passed in the marketplace for the real thing.
Meanwhile, Newton had quickly familiarized himself
with the criminal element of London's vast underworld. His
many contacts, any one of whom might have done him in
during an unguarded moment, included criminals of every
stripe—murderers, thieves, beggars, swindlers, and muggers.

began work at the mint
Newton took an oath of
secrecy, vowing not to
reveal how new coins
were made.
He learned of bribes to destroy evidence, of hideaways in
outlying villages, of secret meetings in taverns and dark
attics. He developed contacts with men and women of
many assumed names, hired undercover agents, and occa-
sionally donned disguises of his own. Those who refused to
cooperate in his investigations were brought before him in
chains for questioning in the tower.
Believing himself to be in the service of a higher moral-
ity, Newton wanted nothing more than to arrest and convict
Chaloner for his many crimes. But this was no ordinary
criminal of the type Newton had grown used to dealing
with. Though he was rich and rode about London in an
elegant carriage with a beautiful woman at his side, the mas-
ter thief was less interested in wealth and the false
respectability it purchased than in the playing of the game.
He loved the fraud he called "funning," the plotting, the
trickery, the sleight of hand that matched his wits against the
108

Mark of the Lion
talent and the resources of the government. When con-
fronted with evidence linking him to a serious crime, he
repeatedly wriggled free by resorting to the big lie, a device
he jokingly referred to as "bubbling." By the time he
crossed swords with the warden of the mint, Chaloner was
spouting like a fountain.
The forger made no greater mistake than when he
boldly appeared before a committee of Parliament to rec-
ommend improvements in the minting of new coin.
Newton was outraged and let it be known that Chaloner
was his number one target. Chaloner responded by taunting
"that old dogg" Newton, who, in a fit of anger, vowed to
hang the villain. It was at this point that Newton decided to
stretch the law in the interest of ridding the world of his
clever tormentor.
Without warning, Chaloner was arrested and clapped
in irons behind the dank walls of Newgate Prison. In return
for certain favors, Newton employed three convicts to gain
Chaloner's confidence and pass on his tales of criminal acts.
The ending, which had been so slow in coming, lasted only
three weeks. Chaloner was placed on trial for high treason
and found guilty, based largely on the testimony of
Newton's questionable witnesses, all of whom were con-
fessed criminals. Chaloner's protests that he had been
framed fell on deaf ears, and the convicted man's date with
the hangman was set.
Ironically, Chaloner's only hope of mercy rested with
Newton. Shortly before his scheduled execution, he wrote
an emotional letter to the warden: "I am going to be mur-
dered although perhaps you may think not but tis true I
shall be murdered by the worst of all murders that is in the
face of Justice unless I am rescued by your merciful hands."
Days later Chaloner got his answer when he was loaded
onto a cart and paraded two miles through the streets to the
gallows in Hyde Park. There he repeated his claim, crying
109

Isaac Newton
out hysterically to the assembled crowd that he was being
murdered by lies and injustice. Few took notice, for it was a
rare criminal indeed who did not proclaim his innocence
when faced with the moment of death. Newton himself was
not present at the hanging, but the man whom Chaloner
had compared to an old dog had the last word. "Criminals,
like dogs," he remarked, "always return to their vomit."
Even as Newton pursued criminals and raised the pro-
duction of coins to a record 100,000 pounds per week, his
reputation as a natural philosopher continued to grow. In
January 1697 he received a letter from Johann Bernoulli, a
distinguished mathematics professor at the University of
Basel in Switzerland. The letter contained two difficult
mathematical problems, one of which had been published in
a scientific journal six months earlier but remained
unsolved. The other had been solved by the gifted German
philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von
Leibniz, but Bernoulli had decided to keep Leibniz's solu-
tion a secret in order to test Newton's powers.
Newton received Bernoulli's letter late one afternoon,
after a long and tiring day at the mint, which was in the
middle of the recoinage. The first of the challenge problems
required Newton to determine the curve in which a heavy
body falling under the force of its own weight will descend
most rapidly from a given point to another given point. The
second problem was even more complex and required a
series of steps that had so far baffled all seekers.
Forgetting his dinner, Newton immediately set to work.
Some 12 hours later, at four in the morning, he had the
correct answers, yet still refused to go to bed. He drafted a
letter to the president of the Royal Society and included the
solutions, which, according to his instructions, were to be
published anonymously in the Philosophical Transactions.
When the journal came off the press a few weeks later,
mathematicians were stunned. Among them was Johann
Bernoulli, who wrote a friend that only Isaac Newton could
10

have succeeded where others had failed: "I can tell the lion
by the mark of his claw."
Having met and been honored by the king, Newton
was the subject of royal attention from another quarter. In
June 1697 Peter the Great, the young czar of all the
Russians, left his homeland on a visit to England and
Western Europe. Standing six feet seven inches, a height
that would have made his skeleton the prize of every scien-
tific society in existence, Peter carried a seal with the
inscription: "I am a pupil and need to be taught."
Everything involving the new science and technology inter-
ested him. Indeed, the czar planned to take back much of

what he learned to his homeland, which had barely
emerged from the Middle Ages. After visiting England's
shipyards, its main cannon factory, and the Royal
Observatory at Greenwich, he specifically requested a meet-
ing with the author of the Principia. It took place in the
Tower of London, where Newton talked science with the
czar and gave him a tour of the mint, whose great hammer
presses, driven by ropes and human muscle, struck coins on
different beats, like giant cuckoo clocks gone mad.
Shortly after Peter left England, Newton was visited by
Jaques Cassini, son of the noted astronomer Giovanni
Domenico Cassini. As an agent of Louis XIV, the famous
Sun King who had established his French court at Versailles
surrounded by orange blossoms and a thousand obedient
nobles, Cassini offered Newton a large pension. While
Newton would never have said so in public, his religious
views were such that he wanted nothing to do with the
Catholic king of a Catholic kingdom, and so he politely
refused the offer. A rarely snubbed King Louis chose not to
include Newton's name on his list of nominees to the posi-
tion of foreign associate of the French Academy of Science
the following year. But one year later, in 1699, the academy
itself made Newton a foreign associate along with Johann
Bernoulli, whose mathematical challenge he had so bril-
liantly met.
Except for an occasional visit to Lincolnshire, Newton's
contacts with his family had been limited since the death of
his mother. At Cambridge he had been content with the
slow passage of the days and seasons, and with the isolation
that allowed him to pursue his work undisturbed. Whether
he liked it or not, London and the mint had transformed
him into something of a man of action, requiring him to
keep a household where important visitors were entertained
over dinner and fine wine.
As a bachelor, Newton needed someone to look after
his domestic needs and to sit at his table when he had
112

Mark of the Lion
guests. Rather than rely on a housekeeper, who might lack
the required social graces, he turned to his niece Catherine
Barton, the daughter of his stepsister Hannah. Catherine
probably arrived at her uncle s house on Jermyn Street in
1696, when she was 17. By all accounts the young woman
was strikingly beautiful. When she came down with small-
pox, Newton sent her into the country to recuperate and
worried that her lovely face would be permanently scarred:
"Pray let me know," he wrote, "how your face is and if
your fever be going. Perhaps warm milk from ye Cow
may help to abate it." Newton breathed a sigh of relief
when he next set eyes on his niece, who was as beautiful as
ever.
But it was not Catherine's looks alone that charmed the
usually stern Newton and the members of his social circle.
She appears to have been the one relative of her uncle's
who was gifted beyond the ordinary. Not only was
Catherine graceful and pleasant to gaze at, but she was
witty and well read, traits that gained her many admirers
among important political and literary figures.
Newton's friend and patron Charles Montague wrote
poetry in Catherine s honor and toasted her charms at the
Kit-Kat Club, a fashionable association founded by the
Whig politician Christopher "Kit" Cate. Jonathan Swift,
the famed author of Gulliver's Travels, which unfolds in the
mythical land of Lilliput, became her cherished friend.
Swift thought Catherine an excellent conversationalist and a
clever gossip whose company he never tired of. "I went to
see [Miss] Barton this morning," he wrote a friend. "I love
her better than anybody here, and see her seldomer. So it
often happens in the world."
When Swift spoke of love, he meant the deepest kind
of friendship, but the hearts of others spoke romance.
Remond de Monmort, a French official, fell head over
heels for Catherine during a visit to London, in spite of the
fact that he had left a Madame (Mrs.) de Monmort back in
113

Isaac Newton
Paris. "I have adored her not only for her great beauty but
for her lively and refined wit," Monmort confided to his
friend Brooke Taylor of the Royal Society. "If I had the
good fortune to be near her, I would henceforth become as
awkward as I was the first time we met." As far as Newton
was concerned, no one since Fatio de Dullier had so deeply
stirred his feelings. Catherine's gaiety, charm, and warmth
made coming home from the mint on chill winter after-
noons a genuine pleasure for the aging lion.
From Newton's point of view, Thomas Neale, the mas-
ter of the mint, was nothing but a drone who performed no
work and produced no honey. In other words, Neale was
typical of most government officials who had secured com-
fortable positions through their high connections, then pro-
ceeded to enjoy the good life while underlings carried on
the business of the day. The only good thing about Neale
was that he gave the inexhaustible Newton free reign,
enabling his second in command to master every detail of
managing the mint. Then, on December 23, 1699, Thomas
Neale died. Because the master had been seriously ill for
months, it is likely that agreement had already been reached
concerning his successor. Two days later, on Christmas Day,
Isaac Newton became master of the mint, a most welcome
present on this, his 57th birthday. Whereas Neale had
earned thousands of pounds every year, Newton had been
working for a few hundred. This, too, suddenly changed.
The new master saw his annual income multiply as much as
tenfold, elevating an already wealthy man to the equivalent
of a modern millionaire.
Ever conservative in matters involving his finances,
Newton had not resigned the Lucasian professorship when
he left Cambridge in 1696. Thus, if London did not suit his
tastes, or if he suddenly found himself in danger of losing his
position, he could always return to a post that had served
him well. He cautiously waited another two years, during
114

Mark of the Lion
which he earned several thousand pounds as master, before
he decided to cut his academic ties with the university. In
December 1701, Newton gave up his professorship, but not
before he handpicked his successor, a young mathematician
named William Whiston who shared his secret and politi-
cally dangerous religious views.
As a gesture of respect, Newton was once again elected
to Parliament by the university, and once again the records
indicate that he said nothing during the long and often
bitterly charged debates. However, the life of this
Parliament was brief. A sickly William III breathed his last
on May 7, 1702, and Princess Anne ascended the English
throne. As was customary, the queen dissolved Parliament
and called for new elections. When Newton was asked by
the Cambridge authorities if he wished to run again, he
politely declined: "And now I have served you in this
Parliament, other gentlemen may expect their turn in the
next." Though he would remain a political appointee the
rest of his life, Newton's days as a politician were over.
115

Crone Court, the first permanent home of the Royal Society, was purchased in 1710. Newton had spent years
searching throughout London for a suitable headquarters.

The Royal Society
The Royal Society
Ever since he arrived in London, Newton had kept his dis-
tance from the Royal Society, the scientific institution
through which he gained lasting fame. When asked why he
did not become more involved, he claimed that his duties at
the mint demanded all his time. There were those who
knew better, however. The real reason Newton did not
attend the meetings was an old grudge he had nursed ever
since his reflecting telescope was carried to London by his
friend Isaac Barrow.
Robert Hooke had argued that he had developed a
smaller and more accurate instrument. Hooke had also crit-
icized Newton's theory of light and claimed gravity as
another of his mental inventions, causing a skeptical
Edmond Halley to take the coach to Cambridge in hopes
of settling the matter once and for all. And though they had
engaged in an outwardly civil correspondence over the
years, Newton hated Hooke, while Hooke wrote in his
diary that he dreamed Newton had died.
At age 68, Robert Hooke had been reduced to a shriv-
eled, pain-racked husk. He no longer attended meetings of
the Royal Society and was living what one biographer
17
10
chapter

Isaac Newton
termed "a dying life." Nearly blind and bedridden, the man
of a thousand ideas—some brilliant and some crackpot—
died on March 3, 1703. Hooke left no will and his money,
which he liked to keep handy, was found locked in an iron
chest.
Six months later, the Fellows of the Royal Society
assembled for the annual election of its 21-member council
and officers. When the ballots were counted, Isaac Newton,
who had suddenly taken a renewed interest in the society's
affairs, was chosen president.
Newton may well have asked himself, "President of
what?" The treasury of the society was empty; new scien-
tific ideas were as scarce as hen's teeth; and the number of
Fellows had declined from 200 in 1680 to a little over 100
on the eve of his presidency. Worse yet, few members
attended the society's weekly meetings and fewer still the
council, which sometimes made its decisions at gatherings
little larger than the foursome needed for a game of bridge.
When discussions took place, they were mainly devoted
to medicine or the anatomy of exotic beasts. The Fellows,
many of whom were physicians, doted on live specimens of
crocodiles, armadillos, and opossums. They were fascinated
by presentations on the merits of various poisons employed
by convicted murderers, and debated the medical value of
pig's urine, a far cry from the days when the laws governing
the universe were the main topic of concern. Matters had
gotten so far out of hand that the Fellows became the butt
of jibes by anonymous pamphleteers. They were accused of
searching for a deer in the belly of a snake, of finding an egg
in the tail of a barnacle, of sorting "lady's bugs," and of wit-
nessing a shower of fish followed by a shower of butter in
which to cook them. Indeed, it seemed that everyone was
laughing—everyone, that is, but the new president, who was
little known for his sense of humor.
So few members showed up at one of the first meetings
chaired by Newton that he had to cancel it. The angry pres-
18

The Royal Society
ident reacted by drafting a master plan entitled a "Scheme
for establishing the Royal Society," his blunt way of stating
that the organization no longer existed and had to begin
anew. First, he wrote, the society must return to its original
mission, that of "discovering the frame & operations of
Nature, reducing them (as far as may be) to general Rules
or Laws, establishing those Rules by observations & experi-
ments, and then deducing the causes & effects of things."
To those familiar with the new natural philosophy, Newton
was calling for the application of Galileo's scientific method.
To carry out this work, Newton recommended the
appointment of four paid "demonstrators" who would
attend all meetings and present regularly scheduled experi-
ments and lectures in mechanics and mathematics, optics
and astronomy, zoology, chemistry, and botany. While he
could never bring himself to mention Hooke by name,
there is no question that Newton was thinking of just such
a model multiplied by four. But to do these things the
Royal Society had to have a permanent residence, dozens of
active members, and a healthy treasury—matters that
Newton addressed in the second part of his ambitious
scheme.
Ever since receiving its charter in 1662, the society had
met at Gresham College in Bishopsgate Street. This vast
timber-and-brick mansion was originally constructed as a
private residence by the wealthy merchant Sir Thomas
Gresham, who toasted Queen Elizabeth in the great dining
hall with wine laced with the essence of pearls. Having no
rooms of their own, the Fellows assembled in the apart-
ments of various professors over the years, the last being the
quarters of the recently deceased Robert Hooke.
It was Newton's plan either to construct or to purchase
a home for the society. To accomplish this he would have to
raise funds from the Fellows, many of whose membership
fees had not been paid for years. After much debate, the
council approved the president's proposal that every candi-

date for membership must pay the
admission fee and sign a bond for his
weekly dues before his induction.
Fellows who had not previously
signed a bond were now called on to
do so, and no member who failed to
comply or who was behind in his
dues could serve on the council.
Despite many complaints and much
grumbling, money began to trickle
in. The society was also given some
stock in the East India and the East
Africa companies, which had been
formed to increase trade in the
expanding British Empire.
Working closely and in secret
with Secretary Hans Sloane, Newton
spent the next few years scouring
London for a suitable headquarters while the treasury grew.
Although regular meetings were suspended during summers,
the council was suddenly called into emergency session in
September 1710. With the help of Sir Christopher Wren,
Newton had located a house in Crane Court off bustling
Fleet Street, which was available for the sum of 1,450
pounds. Newton gained the council's approval, and when
the society next met on October 26, the president proudly
reported that the sale had been completed. Those on the
council who had opposed his plan were soundly defeated
when they stood for reelection a month later, a lesson to
anyone who thought of crossing swords with the unforgiv-
ing president.
Ruling with the hand of a monarch, Newton had
moved the Royal Society onto firm financial ground after it
had endured 50 years of a stepchild's hand-to-mouth exis-
tence. When the planned remodeling of Crane Court was
completed 10 months later, the society assembled around its
120

The Royal Society
unchallenged leader like obedient members of court.
According to the newly passed Orders of the Council, only
the president was permitted to sit at the head of the table,
with the two secretaries at the lower end, one on either
side. No talking was permitted among members during the
meetings unless they first addressed themselves to the presi-
dent. Still not satisfied, Newton established the practice that
the mace, the symbol of authority, could be placed on the
table only when the president occupied the chair. On those
occasions when he was absent and the vice president took
his place, the mace remained in its stand. Dr. William
Stukeley, the young Lincolnshire physician who was later
befriended by Newton, described the scene:
Whilst Newton presided in the Royal Society, he exe-
cuted that office with singular prudence, with grace and
dignity. He was very careful of giving any sort of discour-
agement to all attempts of improvement in natural knowl-
edge. There was no whispering, talking, nor loud laugh-
ters. Everything was transacted with great attention and
solemnity and decency. Indeed his presence created a nat-
ural awe in the assembly.
Fully assured of his place in history, Newton had his
image reproduced ever more frequently as he grew older.
He posed for a second portrait by Godfrey Kneller in 1702
and another by Charles Jervas only a year later, as he was
about to become president of the Royal Society. In Jervas's
work the natural philosopher sits stiffly in a high-back arm-
chair, his head crowned by a flowing wig, his right forefin-
ger pointing to an untitled book lying on a nearby table.
The bulging eyes challenge the viewer to blink first, a con-
test Newton always wins. This is an image of complete
control and supreme accomplishment, the very one he
wished to project for future generations. He later presented
the Jervas portrait to the Royal Society, where it is still dis-
played like a sacred object, filling the visitor with awe.
Meanwhile, the only known painting of Hooke somehow
121

Isaac Newton
disappeared during the Royal Society's move from Gresham
College to Crane Court, raising suspicions that Newton
himself was responsible.
In April 1705, Queen Anne, accompanied by her sim-
ple but amiable husband, Prince George of Denmark, set
out from London for the royal residence at Newmarket.
The main reason for the journey was to attend the annual
races, where the best horses in the kingdom charged across
Newmarket heath and over the Devil's Dyke, an ancient
earthwork. The party then made its way to nearby
Cambridge, where the queen was met by the mayor on the
broad green known as Christ's Pieces. Anne led her court
and a host of trailing officials to Trinity Lodge, home of
Richard Bentley, the master of Trinity College. Three aging
men were summoned and, on entering the room, they knelt
before the queen. A royal proclamation was read and a
sword drawn. The blade was touched to each man's shoul-
ders, thus creating three new knights of the realm: Sir John
Ellis, Sir James Montague, and Sir Isaac Newton. A sumptu-
ous dinner was later given for the queen in newly redeco-
rated Trinity Hall, where the most illustrious guest after
Anne herself had waited tables and taken his meals some 45
years earlier.
The royal party soon left Cambridge, but Newton lin-
gered for a time. This was a moment to be savored.
Shunned by all but a handful of students as a professor, he
suddenly found himself the object of their undivided atten-
tion. "We always took care on Sunday to place ourselves
before him," one of them wrote many years later. "As he sat
with the heads of the colleges, we gaz'd on him, never
enough satisfy'd, as on someone divine."
Despite his many other duties, Newton had not aban-
doned his pursuit of science. On February 16, 1704,
Secretary Hans Sloane made the following entry in the
Journal Book of the Royal Society: "The President pre-
sented his book of Optics to the Society. Mr. Halley was
122

The Royal Society
desired to peruse it and give an abstract
of it to the Society. The Society gave
the President their thanks for the Book
and for his being pleased to Publish it."
In contrast to the Principia, whose
publication was preceded by consider-
able fanfare and much anticipation,
nowhere in the minutes of the Royal
Society is the Opticks mentioned prior
to its coming off the press. And it is
the only one of Newton's major works
that he prepared for publication on his
own. Nor did he dedicate this second
pillar of his great scientific legacy to
the Royal Society, as he had the first.
The reason for his silence becomes
clear when one reads the preface.
Newton informs the reader that the
volume is mainly the product of
research completed when he was a
young man. "To avoid being engaged
in Disputes about these matters, I have
hitherto delayed the printing, and
should still have delayed it, had not the Importunity [insis-
tence] of Friends prevailed upon me." To make a long story
short, Newton had once again waited for Hooke to pass
from the scene before moving forward. This scarcely veiled
reference to the deceased curator of experiments was not
easily mistaken by those acquainted with the bitter contro-
versy sparked by Newton's stunning paper on light written
a generation before.
True to his professional ideals, which had been set out
in his "Scheme for establishing the Royal Society," Newton
informs the reader of his intentions: "My Design in this
Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by
Hypothesis, but to propose and prove them by Reason and

Experiments." Thus the gifted theoretician, whose genius
had shown itself in the Principia, laid claim to equal stature
as an experimentalist, a rare combination in the history of
science.
Whereas the Principia is a mathematical work involving
intricate geometrical relationships and only a handful of
major experiments, the Opticks overflows with detailed
accounts of reflection and refraction, the separation of white

light into the colors of the spectrum, the manner of the
eye's operation, the formation of images by lenses, the col-
ors of the rainbow, the construction of the reflecting tele-
scope, and much more. Unable to contain himself, the
author introduces many subjects that have little or nothing
to do with the behavior and analysis of light: metabolism
and digestion, the circulation of the blood, the creation of
the world and the Great Flood of Noah, the scientific
method, even the images that haunt the dreams of madmen.
Moreover, Newton wrote the Opticks in English, making its
contents accessible to a far wider audience than the
Principia, whose classical Latin had stymied many potential
readers. His friend John Locke, who had only months to
live, was baffled by the earlier work but read the Opticks
"with pleasure, acquainting myself with every thing in
them."
Yet even genius has it limits. Newton had delayed pub-
lication of the Opticks for another reason besides his long
and bitter running battle with Robert Hooke. He had
always planned to publish the book in four parts rather than
the three that finally went to press. In that part of the man-
uscript he withheld, he wrote of attempting to formulate a
single principle with which to account for the behavior of
matter: "If Nature be most simple & fully consonant to her
self she observes the same method in regulating the motions
of smaller bodies [including the corpuscles of light] which
she doth in regulating those of the greater [the sun, moon,
and planets]." But just as in 1693, when he broke with Fatio
de Dullier and saw his alchemical experiments fall apart, he
was unable to find the universal principle he was seeking,
gravity only being one part of it. The dream of his early
manhood had taken the form of a nightmare that had lasted
for 30 years. Even the presidency of the Royal Society, the
mastership of the mint, a knighthood, and the publication
of the greatest books of science ever written could not
make it go away.
125

Isaac Newton
in
War
Isaac Newton was not the only keeper of a kingdom who
arose early and worked late into the night. John Flamsteed,
who, in 1675, was appointed England's first astronomer
royal by King Charles II, came calling so early one morning
that Newton was still in bed. While waiting for his host to
dress, Flamsteed read one of Newton's Bibles and reminded
himself that he must keep calm no matter how irritating
Newton might be. He considered Newton to be "a good
man at bottom," but highly suspicious and too easily influ-
enced by others. More than anyone else, Flamsteed blamed
Edmond Halley for the shabby way Newton had been
treating him of late. Flamsteed, who looks the part of a
Puritan minister in the portrait that hangs in the Royal
Society, suspected that Halley was an atheist, an unbeliever
who mocked the religious behind their backs.
Suddenly Flamsteed had what he thought was a bril-
liant idea. He scribbled a note and hid it in Newton's Bible:
"Read Jeremiah, chapter 10 to the 10th verse," a declara-
tion against false prophets and liars. Flamsteed later confided
to a friend, "I do not know whether he has seen it, but I
think he cannot take it amiss if he has. I have showed him
126
chapter

the way of the world much better than politics or a play
could do."
While Halley had his jocular moments when he poked
fun at the overly zealous, it is doubtful that he rejected
organized religion out of hand and more doubtful still that
Newton would have associated with him if he had. The real
source of Newton's discontent with Flamsteed, which had
reached the point where the astronomer no longer attended
the meetings of the Royal Society, was Flamsteed s refusal to
yield to Newton's every demand. Newton was anxious to
publish a second edition of the Principia, and he needed data
on the motions of the moon and planets that Flamsteed was
gathering at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, a pleas-
ant boat ride down the Thames from London.
Had Newton been more diplomatic, there is little
doubt that Flamsteed would have been more cooperative.
For all his bluster, and despite his roughshod treatment at
Newton's hands, Flamsteed was in awe of the man and sim-
ply wanted to be treated with dignity. Moreover, Flamsteed
was inching his way toward the completion of a work upon
War

treatment, John Flamsteed,
England's first astronomer
royal, refused to share vital
data with him.
127

Isaac Newton
which his own fame would rest, the projected Historia
Coekstis (History of the Heavens), the most ambitious cata-
log of the stars ever undertaken.
When Flamsteed had asked Newton to visit Greenwich
to see firsthand what he was doing, Newton declined the
invitation, as had Halley. Flamsteed then called on Newton
at his home, only to be rejected a second time. No shrink-
ing violet, the astronomer royal proceeded to lecture
Newton, who was rarely challenged to his face. Comparing
himself to those who labored on London's great St. Paul's
Cathedral, Flamsteed complained: "I had hewed the materi-
als out of the rock, brought them together, and formed
them" and "that hands and time were to be allowed to per-
fect the building and cover it." Newton grudgingly admitted
that he had a point, but once Flamsteed was out of sight the
quarrel escalated into war.
Whereas Flamsteed accused Newton of sending his
young disciples to Greenwich to spy on the progress of his
work, Newton railed against Flamsteed's secrecy and inten-
tional dawdling. What rankled Newton even more was the
fact that for the first time in his professional life someone
else was in control: Flamsteed possessed something that
Newton had wanted desperately for years, and Flamsteed
knew it.
Swallowing his pride, Newton went at last to
Greenwich to dine in April 1704. Relishing the circum-
stances, Flamsteed informed Newton of some faults he had
uncovered in the fourth book of the Principia, "which
instead of thanking me for, he resented ill." When the con-
versation then turned to the recently issued Opticks, a copy
of which Newton had sent to Greenwich, things went no
smoother. "I thanked him for his book: he said then he
hoped I approved it. I told him truly no." Yet Flamsteed
admitted privately that "upon trial all the experiments suc-
ceeded as Newton related them, which kept me quiet and
in suspense."
128

War
When Prince George visited Greenwich a few months
later, he offered to finance the printing of Flamsteed's yet
unfinished masterpiece. Newton, who was not to be
denied, got wind of the proposal and moved swiftly to
make certain that the astronomer royal was in no position to
refuse. At the next meeting of the Royal Society the presi-
dent persuaded the Fellows to "encourage" Flamsteed's
publication. In another cunning move, Newton saw to it
that Prince George was elected a Fellow the following
week. Though he sputtered and squawked, Flamsteed was
forced to accept the royal offer, for princes were not to be
challenged.
Even more galling was the fact that Newton, who had
become Flamsteed's open enemy, was appointed head of a
commission to examine his papers and determine which of
them were fit to print. "With these persons," Flamsteed

Isaac Newton
lamented, "Sir Isaac Newton began to act his part, and carry
on his designs." Savoring his triumph, Newton drafted a let-
ter commanding Flamsteed to bring specimens of his work
to a dinner with the commissioners, signing himself "Your
very loving Friend & humble servant."
The next confrontation occurred when Flamsteed
learned that rather than publish all of his papers—including
every major star catalog from the Greek astronomer
Claudius Ptolemy down to Edmond Halley—Newton
wanted to print only that material of interest to him. He
was especially interested in Flamsteed's data on the motions
of the moon, which were critical to the refinement of his
work on gravity. It was at this point that Flamsteed decided
to block publication any way he could. Deadlock set in and
Newton, try as he might, could not get Flamsteed to budge.
Not until April 1708, two years after the project began, did
the first page of Volume I of the Historia Coelestis emerge
from the press. It would be another four years before what
Flamsteed considered to be his mutilated work was finally
between covers. Meanwhile, the bickering and the sniping
continued. Newton, who never truly succeeded in bending
Flamsteed to his will, had the astronomer's name stricken
from the list of Royal Society Fellows in 1709 for nonpay-
ment of dues. Flamsteed responded by drafting a bitter letter
to his friend Abraham Sharp: "Newton has been lately
much talked of; but not much to his advantage. Our society
is ruined by his close, politic, and cunning forecast."
In truth, Flamsteed was indulging in some wishful
thinking. Whatever else Newton might be guilty of, he had
almost single-handedly pulled the society back from the
brink of disaster while restoring its tarnished reputation. He
was turning it into an international enterprise as well.
Foreign membership more than doubled during his presi-
dency and included almost as many political figures as natu-

fortable armchairs near the president and entertained by
experiments carefully chosen for their spectacular effects.
On one such occasion Senior Grimani, the Venetian
ambassador; Signor Gerardini, envoy from the Grand Duke
of Tuscany; and the Duke D'Armont, the French ambas-
sador, were shown two preparations "made of the veins and
arteries of a human liver by injecting red wax into them,
which was very curiously and beautifully performed." They
also saw light produced by friction and were treated to a
demonstration of the power of gravity in a vacuum. But
mostly those who served kings and queens and princes
came to look upon Newton himself, who had attained the
stature of a living god.
After occupying several different residences, Newton
finally settled at 35 St. Martin's Street in the parish of
Westminster, now a part of greater London. Leicester
House, as this stone dwelling became known, was a three-
story structure to which its new occupant is believed to
have added an observatory. Whether by Catherine Barton's
choice or his own, Newton was surrounded with furnish-
ings of red. The chairs and sofa were covered in red uphol-
stery; the draperies were of the same color; red pillows and
a matching coverlet decorated his bed, next to which stood
a red settee on which he napped after coming home from
the mint. Among his other new furnishings were an expen-
sive bell for summoning servants, two bottle racks, three
beer stands, and a wooden tub. Of his plans for the tub, a
widow living nearby is said to have reported that "every
morning he takes his seat in front of a tub of soap-suds, and
occupies himself for hours blowing soap-bubbles through a
common clay-pipe intently watching till they burst." Like
so many stories about the great man, this one seems more
fiction than fact, but it is nice to imagine a Newton human
enough to delight in this childhood pleasure.
The second edition of the Prindpia, to be followed by a
third, was published in 1713, much to the relief of anxious
1 3 1

Isaac Newton
scholars. The first edition had been limited to a few hun-
dred copies and these had long since sold out. For those
wealthy enough, a used volume could be had for the con-
siderable sum of two guineas. Those less well off were
reduced to the tedious labor of copying it out page by page.
The task of publishing the work so admirably per-
formed by Halley now fell to Richard Bentley, a classical
scholar and master of Trinity College. Bentley's motives
were less pure than Halley s had been, for he made it clear
that it was the love of money rather than of natural philoso-
phy that caused him to undertake the work. Moreover,
Bentley was not grounded in the finer points of analytical
geometry and had to recruit Roger Cotes, a young professor
of astronomy and natural philosophy, to deal with the many
technical matters. The enterprise was further tainted by
Newton's ill treatment of Flamsteed. He had hounded the
astronomer royal for years, employing virtually every dirty
trick imaginable in an effort to gain control of his lifework.
After expelling the astronomer from the Royal Society, he
systematically pirated his observations for what he believed
to be a "higher" purpose.
Only on the eve of his death years later did Flamsteed
gain a measure of revenge. He undertook the printing of a
complete edition of the Historia Coelestis, restoring all the
star catalogs and other papers Newton had so shamefully
omitted. Then, for good measure, Flamsteed purchased
every available copy printed by Newton and cast them into
the fire, a ritual act of purification.
Already involved in a long and brutal war on one front,
Newton became engaged in another. If judged solely on
looks, his latest opponent seemed little more threatening
than the bent and twisted Hooke. Indeed, Gottfried
Wilhelm von Leibniz was stooped at the waist and of medi-
um height; his broad shoulders sat atop a thick torso pro-
pelled about by bandy legs and tiny feet. Beneath his dark
eyes and long fleshy nose was a large mouth that turned up
132

War
at the corners, like the cat
who has secretly swallowed
the canary. Yet it was not
Leibniz's looks that mattered
in his coming battle with
Newton but his wits, which
Leibniz, a genius in his own
right, possessed in plenty.
Remembered more for
his works as a philosopher
than anything else, the tireless
German scholar was no less
comfortable in the fields of
theology, history, mathemat-
ics, law, mechanics, languages,
and geology. While Newton
was drafting the first papers on
the calculus that would one
day lock the two in mortal combat, 20-year-old Leibniz
was composing a brilliant treatise entitled On the Art of
Combination, a model of logical analysis that has been cred-
ited as the ancestor of modern computers. Equally skilled
with his hands, the young German constructed an automat-
ic calculating machine, which he carried to London for the
education and pleasure of the Royal Society Fellows, who
gladly welcomed him into their company, as they had
Newton on the delivery of his telescope.
Leibniz's rapid advance as a mathematician was second
only to Newton's. During the waning months of 1675, he
was in possession of the same fluxional method, or calculus,
that Newton had developed a decade earlier. This was not a
case of theft, as Newton would later charge, but of inde-
pendent invention on Leibniz's part. Moreover, he intro-
duced a superior system of notation in his equations, which
eventually replaced Newton's more cumbersome method
and is still in use today.
The German scholar
Gottfried Wilhelm von
Leibniz developed the
calculus independently
of Newton.
133

Isaac Newton
As one of the few who knew of Newton's mathematical
genius early on, John Collins had pleaded with him to pub-
lish. But Newton preferred secrecy to publicity and missed
his chance to establish clear-cut priority. To make matters
worse, Leibniz had visited London in 1676. Unbeknown to
Newton, the visitor was given access to his mathematical
papers—including the calculus—by Collins, who was deeply
impressed by the level of the German's scholarship. Collins
also wanted Leibniz and his fellow Europeans to know just
how great a mathematician Newton was. Leibniz proceeded
to take notes from certain of the papers, but only later
would it be discovered that he had copied nothing of the
calculus. The simplest explanation for his behavior is also
the most convincing: Leibniz had already mastered the
method on his own, so Newton had nothing to teach him
on the subject. He may even have prided himself on the
superiority of his notational system. Only after Collins had
gone to his grave years later would Newton learn of what
was to him a great betrayal.
Meanwhile, Newton and Leibniz entered into a corre-
spondence on mathematics. By his own admission, Newton
was more than a little impressed by Leibniz's grasp of the
subject. Still the Englishman was so sure of himself that he
refused to discuss the calculus openly, believing that no one
else could achieve what he had accomplished as a young
man in his early 20s. Time itself must stand still for Isaac
Newton; after all, he was one of the Lord's anointed. At the
same time, Leibniz, who knew Newton's secret from having
visited London, confided to his friend Otto Menke: "Mr.
Newton developed it [the calculus], but I arrived at it by
another way. One man makes one contribution, another
man another."
The storm, which took a long time building, broke in
full fury in 1699, after Leibniz published two papers on
the revolutionary mathematics. He further suggested in
print that it was Newton who owed a debt to him, an erro-
134

War
neous claim that was bound to provoke a heated response.
Not only had Newton been first, but he had solved two of
the most difficult challenge problems Johann Bernoulli
could devise, and Leibniz, who was Bernoulli's friend, well
knew it.
Though his close ties to Newton had been severed,
Fatio de Dullier rushed to his defense. He stated in print
that Newton was not only the "first inventor of the calcu-
lus," he was the earliest by many years. Whether Leibniz
was the second inventor he would leave to the judgment
of others. No one who examines the records will be
deceived by Leibniz's claim "to the invention of the calculus
for himself."
Leibniz, who was deeply angered by the suggestion that
he had stolen from Newton, wrote a sharp letter of protest
to the Royal Society. Still not satisfied, he penned a review
for the Acta Eruditorum (Transactions of the Learned), refut-
ing Fatio's charges and laying the blame for the attack on his
honor at Newton's door. No less angered himself, Newton
was heard to thunder more than once: "Second inventors
count for nothing!"
The conflict entered a new and even more brutal stage
following the publication of the Opticks in 1704. Two
mathematical papers were printed at the end of the work,
and in the preface Newton wrote that years ago he had lent
out a manuscript of these papers and implied that Leibniz
had stolen from it. Leibniz responded by writing a second
review for the Acta in an attempt to turn the tables.
Newton's fluxions, Leibniz charged, were merely the calcu-
lus by another name. Like a master counterfeiter, Newton
had disguised his forged coin by devising a clever method of
notation to conceal his debt to Leibniz.
So the war went, measure for measure, blow for blow,
with many of the blows being struck by the undignified dis-
ciples of two geniuses in words that today would result in
the charge of libel. Finally, a weary Leibniz had had enough
135

Isaac Newton
In the February 1715
issue of Philosophical
Transactions, the Royal
Society's journal, Newton
launched a vicious attack
against Leibniz, claiming
that the German had
stolen the calculus
from him.
and decided to appeal to
the ultimate forum, the
Royal Society itself.
His long letter was read
at the meeting of January
31, 1712, and duly entered
in the record. He had
endured enough "empty
and unjust braying" on the
part of Newton's defenders.
Even his rival must disap-
prove of the unending
assault on his honor: "I am
confident that he will freely
give evidence of his opin-
ion on this issue."
Too late did Leibniz
realize that he had commit-
ted a huge blunder; indeed,
he had played directly into
Newton's hands. The presi-
dent hit upon a devilishly
clever scheme. Leibniz
wanted justice. Very well,
let him have it. The Royal
Society would appoint a special committee to settle the nag-
ging priority issue—winner take all.
Newton took great pains to make it appear as if the
committee was impartial. Eleven men of differing back-
grounds, occupations, and political loyalties were chosen to
weigh the evidence. He boasted that the group was "skillful
and composed of Gentlemen of several nations, and the
Society are satisfied in their Fidelity without adding, omit-
ting or altering any thing in favor of either Party." In truth,
Newton had handpicked every committee member, stacking
the deck against a faraway Leibniz from the beginning.
136

War
Newton's treachery was compounded by the fact that
the committee's detailed report was ready in a month and a
half, although the last member was appointed only a week
before its release. The names of those who served appear
nowhere in the document, nor did their identity become
public knowledge until a century later, when the Royal
Society's minutes were published. Even so, none of this
mattered in light of the later discovery that it was Newton
himself who compiled the evidence and drafted the report,
which was issued under the title Commerdum Epistolicum
(Letter on Trade). Every move Leibniz had made, from his
London visits to his choice of notation for the calculus, was
cast in a suspicious light.
Aside from the relatively few who knew better, it
appeared that he was an intellectual thief who had cleverly
stolen Newton's creation and claimed it as his own. The
Fellows approved the report to a man and agreed that it
should be published as soon as possible. Nine months later,
in January 1713, the Commerdum came off the press.
Newton personally saw to it that copies reached the institu-
tions and persons that mattered most, especially Leibniz's
European colleagues, who looked upon him as a saint
among mathematicians.
Leibniz died three years later, and it would take more
than two centuries before the whole truth behind this ugly
story became known. Even after his enemy was no more,
Newton could not let go. A friend of William Whiston,
Newton's successor as Lucasian professor, reported that he
once heard Newton pleasantly remark that "He had broke
Leibniz's Heart with his Reply to him."
137

Newton in 1725, at age 82, two years before his death.

John Conduitt, the son of a wealthy family from the county
of Hampshire in southern England, became a familiar face
at Leicester House in the summer of 1717. While there is
no doubt that the young man was in awe of Sir Isaac
Newton, the reason for his frequent visits had nothing to
do with science, mathematics, or the operations of the
mint. Conduitt came to 35 St. Martin's Street to court
Catherine Barton, who at 38 years of age was nine years
older than her suitor, but still very beautiful.
Conduitt had served as a captain with the British army
in Spain, where he was able to identify the site of Carteia, a
lost city once occupied by the Romans some 2,000 years
earlier. When word of his discovery reached the Royal
Society back in London, he was invited to read a paper on
the subject, which he did upon his return to England three
months later. It was there that he first met Newton, who
may have invited him to Leicester House for dinner at
which Catherine presided as hostess.
The Hampshire gentleman and the independent-
minded beauty were wed on August 26, after a courtship
lasting only a few weeks. Catherine bore the couple's first
139
"Like a Boy on
the Seashore"

Isaac Newton
and only child, a daughter, two years later. They baptized
her Catherine and nicknamed her Kitty to avoid confusion
with her mother. Tradition holds that the Conduitts lived
with Newton, who doted on his grandniece. However,
Catherine's letters suggest that much of their time was spent
at Cranburg Park, the ancestral home of her devoted hus-
band. After all, her uncle was jealous of his privacy, which
could not have been easily protected with a noisy toddler in
his midst. The family paid frequent visits during which
Conduitt asked Sir Isaac questions for a biography he
planned to write, the extensive notes for which survive.
Newton formed a high opinion of his nephew-in-law and
began laying plans for the day when Conduitt would suc-
ceed him as master of the mint.
In 1722, as Newton was nearing his 80th birthday, he
received a painful reminder of his mortality. Taken seriously
ill with kidney stones, he was gradually nursed back to
health by his personal physician and Royal Society Fellow,
Dr. Richard Mead. "I am getting well little by little," he
wrote a friend, but in truth he had entered a period of nat-
ural decline.
There is little to indicate that he had mellowed with
age, as had the ripened apple whose fall had set him to
thinking about gravity a half century earlier. It was simply
not his way. He still relished a quarrel, and fought on in
print with the followers of Leibniz although the other cre-
ator of the calculus was in his grave. He now experienced
the ultimate triumph of outliving those who had dared to
challenge or cross him. He was internationally famous, and
his hard-won glory made it -worthwhile to endure.
There were many requests for audiences with the old
giant, but Catherine, who later moved back to London with
her husband and growing daughter, kept most of the curi-
ous at bay. Among them was a young man from the
American colonies named Benjamin Franklin, who was just
mastering the printer's trade. Franklin wrote in his diary of
140

"Like o Boy on the Seashore"
being promised "an opportunity of some time or other of
seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I was extremely desirous;
but this never happened." Years later, after he became
famous for his brilliant experiments on electricity, Franklin
was awarded the Copley Medal, the highest prize given by
the Royal Society.
Another of those disappointed at not meeting Newton
was a young Frenchman named Francois Marie Arouet,
who wrote under the pen name Voltaire. The closest the
critic of royal power in France got was a meeting with
Catherine. She matched wits with her sharp-tongued visi-
tor, whose piercing eyes flashed when she told him stories
of her uncle and his sometimes peculiar habits. Voltaire,
who had the morals of a gossip columnist, repaid her kind-
ness by spreading scandal about his hostess in the drawing
rooms of London and Paris, not to mention in his books.
Among the few allowed to visit Newton was William
Stukeley, the young doctor from Lincolnshire. He credited
Newton's long life to a strong constitution and regular
habits. In 1725 Stukeley watched in amazement as Newton
added up a column of figures without the aid of spectacles,
pen, or ink. He told Stukeley that his breakfast consisted of
boiled orange peel, sweetened tea, and a little bread with
butter. He drank more water than when he was a young
man and took only a small amount of wine with his dinner.
His other meals consisted mostly of broth, vegetables, and
fruit, "of which he always ate very heartily." Never a large
meat eater, Newton had virtually given it up in recent
years. Still plagued by kidney stones, he also gave up his
carriage whose jostling over London's cobblestone streets
caused him extreme pain. He was carried about by four
men in a slower but smooth-riding sedan chair, his arms
dangling out of the openings on either side. His eyes
remained lively and piercing, while his silver hair, which
seemed never to have thinned, was described by Stukeley as
a "venerable sight" when his wig was removed. More
141

Isaac Newton
remarkable still for one who loved sweets and grew plump
from eating them, Newton had lost only a single tooth.
After Catherine's marriage, Newton lived much as he
always had, taking his meals alone and passing most of his
days in his study, reading and writing. His once heavy duties
at the mint were lightened by Conduitt, and for a year
before his death he rarely visited the tower. His excellent
record of attendance at the Royal Society became tarnished
as age took its toll. More and more the mace remained in its
stand while the vice-president occupied the chair.
On occasion Newton surprised those who knew him
by turning up at unexpected places. One evening a gather-
ing of men from Lincolnshire was held at the Ship Tavern.
Stukeley was in the upstairs dining room where "the better
sort of company" had met when someone reported that an
old gentleman seen downstairs was thought to be Sir Isaac
Newton. The disbelieving doctor rushed down and, to his
complete surprise, spied Newton seated alone. Word was
sent up to the second floor, which soon emptied.
Surrounded by a captive audience, Newton told stories and
gave his opinion on many subjects, including opera, which
was just becoming popular. '"I went to the last opera,' says
he, 'The first act gave me pleasure, the second quite tired
me: at the third I ran away.'" His opinion of poetry "was no
higher; he called it "a kind of ingenious nonsense."
Three days later, Stukeley breakfasted with Newton and
Halley, who had replaced John Flamsteed as astronomer
royal after Flamsteed's death. Newton used the occasion to
blast the fallen astronomer yet again. Flamsteed, he fumed,
had provided him with only a handful of observations when
he was struggling to complete his lunar theory. He owed the
man nothing for whatever success he had enjoyed on that
score. He boasted that he could now finish his work on the
moon if he wanted to, "but rather he chose to leave it to
others." On another occasion he told Halley he was think-
ing of having one more "shake at the moon." And to
142

"Like a Boy on the Seashore"
Benjamin Smith, his nephew, he once spoke of having yet
"another touch at metals," meaning alchemy. Such talk was
based on the wishful thinking of an old man to which
Newton, of all persons, was certainly entitled. Yet these
fancies are revealing for another reason. Newton never
believed that his natural philosophy had been brought to a
satisfactory conclusion, a painful thought he must now live
with to the end.
Surprising as it may seem for a man of his careful
habits, Newton drafted no will. Besides having given to
various charities and to the Royal Society, much of his for-
tune had already been expended on his relatives, many of
whom were extremely careless with money. His nieces and
nephews by his stepbrother and stepsisters did very well, as
did the Conduitts and their daughter Kitty, who received an
estate in Kensington from her great-uncle valued at 4,000
pounds.
On the last day of February 1727, Newton came into
London to preside at the March 2 meeting of the Royal
Society. Conduitt had not seen him looking so fit in years
and told him so. A smiling Newton replied that he had slept
the Sunday before from eleven at night to eight in the
morning without waking. But by the time he returned
home it was apparent that the rigors of travel had been too
taxing. Another stone lodged itself in his bladder, and the
two doctors called in by Conduitt held out no hope for
recovery. Extreme pain alternated with brief periods of
tranquility during the next several days. "Though the drops
of sweat ran down his face," an anguished Conduitt wrote,
"he never complained, or cried out, or shewed the least
signs of peevishness or impatience."
Stukeley painted an even more dramatic picture of the
death scene: The pain "rose to such a height that the bed
under him, and the very room, shook with his agonys to
the wonder of those that were present. Such a struggle had
his great soul to quit its earthly tabernacle!" It was clearly
143

with his soul that Newton remained most concerned. He
refused the final rites of the church, the last act of a man
who, for more than half a century, secretly viewed the con-
cept of the Trinity with horror. To yield at the last minute
would give Satan the triumph so long denied him by his
unbending foe.
On Wednesday, March 15, Newton rallied, raising
hopes that he might prove the experts wrong once again.
But a few days later he slipped into a coma, remaining
unconscious until he died between one and two o'clock in
the morning of March 20, at age 84. Not long before his
passing he remarked, "I do not know what I may appear to
the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy,
playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and
then finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordi-
nary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered
before me." Strangely, Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist
since Newton, also pictured himself as a child asking child-
like questions: "What would the world look like if I could
ride on a beam of light?" It was Einstein who wrote of Sir
Isaac, "Fortunate Newton, happy child of science. Nature to
him was an open book, whose letters he
could read without effort."
On March 23 the following entry, simple
yet touching, appeared in the Journal Book
of the Royal Society: "The Chair being
Vacant by the Death of Sir Isaac Newton
there is no Meeting this Day." Newton's body
lay in state in Westminster Abbey until April
4, the day of the funeral. The coffin was car-
ried into the main sanctuary by the Lord
High Chancellor, the Dukes of Montrose and
Roxborough, and the Earls of Pembroke,
Sussex, and Macclesfield, all noblemen and all
members of the Royal Society. They were
followed by the procession of mourners led

by Sir Michael Newton, a knight and distant relative of the
fallen giant. The service was performed by the bishop of
Rochester.
Newton's final resting place was chosen for its promi-
nence in the nave of the great abbey. Nearby lie the stilled
bards of Poet's Corner—Chaucer, Robert Browning, and
Alfred Lord Tennyson. Closest to Newton is the great
astronomer Sir John Herschel, who opened the night sky
with telescopes as never before. Time, like a slow and
ancient glacier, washes through the sanctuary, its flow wear-
ing the pavement stones into small hollows. Its work is
aided by the countless thousands of awed visitors who come
each year to pause in silent tribute to the sacred perma-
nence of the dead.

After spending some years away from Isaac Newton, whose
biography I first wrote more than a decade ago, I wish to thank
Professor Owen Gingerich for thinking of me when he began
selecting authors for this series. Nancy Toff, with whom I worked
closely from the beginning, was both a helpful and a gracious ally.
The same is true of Paul McCarthy, whose diligence and editorial
skills served to smooth the way. Lastly, but no less enthusiastically, I
wish to thank copyeditor Ruth Marsh, who saved this terrible
proofreader from committing any number of embarrassing blun-
ders. And here's to you Mambo Manny and Snoote Rockne, bull-
dogs tried and true, who wisely snored through it all.
