Abstract 
This study aimed to clarify ego functions of the university students having a 
tendency to atypical depression by comparing those with other students hav-
ing a tendency to melancholic depression and borderline personality disorder. 
The answers to the questionnaires were obtained from 278 university stu-
dents. The results showed that no difference was found in the total scores of 
ego functions and the scores of the sub-scales such as “synthetic-integrative
functioning,” “sense of reality,” “control of impulses,” “objective relation,” 
“stimulus barrier,” and “autonomous functioning” between the students hav-
ing a tendency to atypical depression and those having a tendency to melan-
cholic depression; while the scores of the “defensive functioning,” one of the 
ego functions, were significantly higher in the students having a tendency to 
atypical depression than in those having a tendency to melancholic depres-
sion. This suggested that the students having a tendency to atypical depression 
may have a higher function of protecting their ego from conflicts than those 
having a tendency to melancholic depression.

daptation. In particular, “escape” can be mentioned as one of the behaviors ex-
hibited by the maladaptive university students, but may be often mistaken for 
idleness or dependence (Takehata & Sase, 2015). However, some of the univer-
sity students whose behaviors appear to be idle or excessively dependent may 
actually suffer from certain mental problems. 
Atypical depression is one of the mental diseases often mistaken for idleness 
and dependence. The number of patients with atypical depression has been re-
cently increasing, especially among the younger generation. The Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, 2013) defines the cardinal symptom of atypical depression as “mood reac-
tivity.” More specifically, patients with atypical depression usually indicate a de-
pressive mood, but brighten the mood in response to actual or potential positive 
events. For example, the university students with atypical depression indicate a 
depressive mood in attending a lecture or taking an examination, but they can 
enjoy dating without indicating a depressive mood. Such clinical pictures of the 
patients with atypical depression may occasionally be mistaken for the signs of 
idleness and dependence (Denda, 2009). There is a possibility that not a few 
university students suffer from maladaptation due to atypical depression among 
the students appearing idle or dependent. In light of this, it is necessary to take 
measures for supporting such latent patients in addition to the students slightly 
indicating the clinical pictures of atypical depression. 
Drug therapy with monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been considered to be 
an effective method for treating the patients with atypical depression. However, 
this method has the problem of the serious side effect. In the clinical field, 
therefore, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with fewer side effects are 
frequently used (Nierenberg, Alpert, Pava, Rosenbaum, & Fava, 1998). However, 
it is reported that the efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on 
the patients with atypical depression is limited (Singh & Williams, 2006). 
Meanwhile, the patients with atypical depression and those with borderline per-
sonality disorder show some similarities in the clinical pictures and the attitudes 
(Perugi et al., 1998; Perugi & Akiskal, 2002), which leads to the assumption that 
atypical depression may stem from the problem of patient’s personality (Fuku-
nishi & Fukunishi, 2013). Understanding of the psychological mechanisms of 
atypical depression is therefore considered to reveal clues about how to effec-
tively support the students having a tendency to atypical depression. 
The case studies of psychotherapy become useful means for understanding the 
psychological mechanisms of the corresponding diseases. The case studies deal-
ing with the clinical pictures related to atypical depression are present (e.g., To-
kioka, 2015), but the number is not sufficient. In other words, the psychological 
mechanisms of atypical depression have not yet been fully clarified. 
There is a report about the comparison of the therapeutic effects on the de-
pressions, not specifying atypical depression, between psychoanalysis and cogni-
tive behavioral therapy (Huber, Zimmermann, Henrich, & Klug, 2012). The

results indicate that both the psychoanalysis and the cognitive behavioral thera-
py produce the respective effects, but the effect of the psychoanalysis is found to 
last longer. It is speculated that the reason for this is that the psychoanalysis 
could bring some changes to the patients’ personality structure (Huber et al., 
2012; Fonagy et al., 2015). With the problem of personality in atypical depres-
sion being taken into account, it is considered useful to go into the psychological 
mechanisms of atypical depression from the viewpoint of psychoanalysis. 
In the psychoanalysis, great importance has been placed on assessment of the 
patients’ ego functions (Bellak, Hurvich, & Gediman, 1973). The ego functions 
mean psychological functions to support individual adaptation, including the 
capacity of evolving the interpersonal relationships (objective relation), the de-
fensive functioning to adjust individual adaptation against conflicts and stresses, 
the function of testing reality that provides the basis for perceiving the external 
events and understanding those events correctly, and the like. However, the ego 
functions of patients with atypical depression have not yet been fully studied. In 
contrast to this, the ego functions of the patients with melancholic depression 
and borderline personality disorder have been understood to some extent. In 
addition, the relations of melancholic depression with atypical depression have 
been studied (Rodgers et al., 2016), and similarities between borderline perso-
nality disorder and atypical depression have been demonstrated (Perugi et al., 
1998). In light of the above, studies on melancholic depression and borderline 
personality disorder should help us understand the ego functions of patients 
with atypical depression. 
Kernberg (1976) proposed the organization of character pathology. The or-
ganization of character pathology is a concept related to ego functions because 
the character pathology is classified based on the object relations, defensive 
functioning, development of superego and the like. The organization of charac-
ter pathology assumes the following three levels: 1) higher level of organization 
of character pathology, including hysterical character and depressive-masochistic 
character; 2) intermediate level of organization of character pathology, including 
sadomasochistic character and narcissistic personality; and 3) lower level of or-
ganization of character pathology, including paranoid personality and border-
line character. According to Kernberg (1976), the patients with melancholic de-
pression are considered to have a depressive-masochistic character, so that they 
are assumed to be in the higher level of organization of character pathology. In 
contrast, the patients with borderline personality disorder are considered to have 
a borderline character, so that they are assumed to be in the lower level of or-
ganization of character pathology. Although there is no explicit suggestion about 
the organization of character pathology of the patients with atypical depression, 
they may be assumed in the lower level because the patients with atypical de-
pression and those with borderline personality disorder are alike in the clinical 
pictures and attitudes (Perugi & Akiskal, 2002; Kaiya, 2008). Accordingly, the 
ego functions of the patients with atypical depression and borderline personality

disorder are assumed to be lower than those of the patients with melancholic 
depression. However, when compared with the patients with borderline perso-
nality disorder, the patients with atypical depression are considered to be able to 
more properly evaluate the relationships with other people except their therap-
ists (Kaiya, 2008), so that the level of their reality testing ability may be higher. 
For these reasons, it is speculated that the ego functions of the patients with 
atypical depression may be better than those of the patients with borderline per-
sonality disorder. For clarifying the ego functions of the university students 
having a tendency to atypical depression in this study, we tried to examine the 
above-mentioned hypotheses by comparing the university students having a 
tendency to atypical depression with those having tendencies to melancholic de-
pression and borderline personality disorder. This study can reveal the ego func-
tions of those having a tendency to atypical depression, which have not been 
fully found out in the past. We therefore believe this study will contribute to-
ward discussing how to support the university students with a tendency to atyp-
ical depression. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Sample 
We conducted a questionnaire study, targeting Japanese students of a provincial 
private university. Questionnaires were distributed to the students in a liberal 
arts class, who belonged to various departments and totaled 278. First, we orally 
informed the students about what our study consisted of and that participation 
into this study was optional. Then, we asked the students to fill in the question-
naires after obtaining their consent. By excluding the questionnaires not com-
pletely filled in, 244 valid responses were received from 77 male students and 
167 female students, with the average age of 19.8 (SD = 1.2). This study was 
conducted after gaining approval from the Ethical Review Committee of Kawa-
saki University of Medical Welfare (No. 16-063). 
2.2. Measurements 
2.2.1. Depression Subtypes 
The Global Scale for Depression (GSD; Fukunishi & Fukunishi, 2012) was used 
to determine the depression subtypes. The GSD is a 30-item instrument de-
signed to assess the potential presence of depressions in two stages. The presence 
and the degree of depression can be evaluated from 17 items on the first stage. 
The subjects responded to each question on a three-point scale, and the subjects 
having the total scores of 30 or more were assessed to have any depression. 
Then, the depression subtypes were determined on the second stage using 13 
items. Each of the 13 items has three response options: the first response option 
corresponding to a clinical picture of atypical depression, the second response 
option corresponding to a clinical picture indicating neither atypical depression 
nor melancholic depression, and the third response option corresponding to a

Psychology
 
clinical picture of melancholic depression. The subjects having the total score of 
−3 or less were assessed to have clinical pictures of atypical depression; and 
those having the total score of +3 or more, clinical pictures of melancholic de-
pression. The reliability and the validity of the GSD have been confirmed by 
Fukunishi & Fukunishi (2012). 
2.2.2. Borderline Personality Disorder 
The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II Borderline Scale short version 
(MCMI-II; Izawa, Ohno, Asai, & Okonogi, 1995) was used for determining the 
presence of borderline personality disorder on a two-point scale. This scale is 
shorted through the results of the item analysis of MCMI-II Borderline Scale de-
signed by Millon (1987). The MCMI-II consists of 17 items. The subjects having 
a total score of 10 or more were assessed to have borderline personality disorder. 
The reliability and validity of the MCMI-II have been repeatedly confirmed by 
Izawa et al. (1995), Izawa (1999) and the like. 
2.2.3. Ego Functions 
The Ego Function Inventory (EFI; Nakanishi & Sakata, 1989) was used for rating 
ego functions on a five-point scale. The EFI was prepared by revising the Ego 
Function Inventory (Nakanishi & Furuichi, 1981), which was a short version of 
the Ego Function Assessment designed by Bellak et al. (1973). The EFI has 42 
items, each of which has five response options. The higher the total score, the 
more smoothly the whole ego functions are considered to work. The ego func-
tions consist of seven subscale functions, which can separately be rated by the six 
items. As the score of each subscale function becomes higher, the condition of 
the corresponding function is considered to be better. The reliability and validity 
of the EFI have been confirmed by Nakanishi & Sakata (1989). 
3. Results 
3.1. Group Classification 
The cutoff points obtained from the results of the GSD (the second stage) and 
the MCMI-II were used for classification, and the subjects were classified into 
four groups. Consequently, the group with a tendency to atypical depression 
consisted of 33 subjects (including 11 males and 22 females) showing the clinical 
pictures of atypical depression; the group with a tendency to melancholic de-
pression consisted of 46 subjects (including 16 males and 30 females) showing 
the clinical pictures of melancholic depression; the group with a tendency to 
borderline personality disorder consisted of 8 subjects (including 5 males and 3 
females) showing the symptoms of borderline personality disorder; and the last 
group consisted of 145 subjects (including 43 males and 102 females) showing 
neither clinical pictures of atypical depression or melancholic depression, nor 
symptoms of borderline personality disorder. The twelve subjects’ data were 
omitted because their data can be classified into a plurality of groups. However, 
the number of the subjects belonging to the group having a tendency to borderline

personality disorder was considered to be too small to be subjected to generali-
zation, so that this group was removed from the analysis. 
3.2. Differences between the Sexes 
The t-test was used to assess whether the males and the females were different 
from each other in the results from the above-mentioned scales (Table 1). The 
males showed significantly lower scores than the females in one of the subscale 
functions, “synthetic-integrative functioning.” This result was the same as that in 
Nakanishi & Sakata (1989). In contrast, the males showed significantly higher 
scores than the females in another subscale function, “control of impulses.” The 
function of “control of impulses” is proved to decrease until about thirty and 
then gradually increase both in males and females (Nakanishi & Sakata, 1989). 
In addition, the function of “control of impulses” is found to be higher in males 
than females at lower ages (Nakanishi & Furuichi, 1981). In light of the above, 
the sexual differences in “synthetic-integrative functioning” and “control of im-
pulses” recognized in this study are not considered to be peculiar results. 
3.3. Differences in Ego Functions 
This study aimed to clarify ego functions of the university students having a 
tendency to atypical depression by comparing those with other students having a 
tendency to melancholic depression and borderline personality disorder. How-
ever, the number of the students having a tendency to borderline personality 
disorder was so small that they were excluded from the following analyses. Ac-
cordingly, the students having a tendency to atypical depression were compared 
with those having a tendency to melancholic depression in the analyses to be 
described later.  
The one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was conducted, with the 
groups, i.e., the group having a tendency to atypical depression (AD), the group 
having a tendency to melancholic depression (MD), and the group having no 
tendency to atypical depression or melancholic depression (ND) being set as the

independent variables and the means of the total scores of ego functions as the 
dependent variables. The results showed a significant main effect (F(2, 221) = 
4.77, p < 0.01), so that multiple comparison was made according to the Bonfer-
roni method. The results showed that the mean total score of the ND was signif-
icantly higher than that of the MD (p < 0.05), but no significant difference was 
found between the AD and the MD, and between the AD and the ND. 
To examine the ego functions in detail, the one-way ANOVA was conducted, 
with the groups, i.e., the AD, MD and ND being set as the independent variables 
and the mean score of each subscale from ego functions as the dependent va-
riables. As a result, there was no significant difference in the subscale scores of 
“synthetic-integrative functioning,” “objective relation” and “autonomous func-
tioning” (F(2, 221) = 2.39, ns; F(2, 221) = 2.32, ns; and F(2, 221) = 1.47, ns, re-
spectively). On the other hand, there were significant main effects in the subscale 
scores of “sense of reality,” “control of impulses,” “defensive functioning” and 
“stimulus barrier” (F(2, 221) = 7.79, p < 0.001; F(2, 221) = 3.11, p < 0.05; F(2, 
221) = 5.57, p < 0.01; and F(2, 221) = 3.64, p < 0.05, respectively), so that the 
multiple comparison was made according to the Bonferroni method. The results 
showed that the mean score of the AD was significantly lower than that of the 
ND in “control of impulses (p < 0.05),” and the mean score of the AD was sig-
nificantly higher than that of the MD in “defensive functioning (p < 0.05).” As 
for “sense of reality” and “stimulus barrier,” the mean scores of the ND were 
significantly higher than those of the MD (p < 0.05), but there was no significant 
difference in the mean scores between the AD and the MD, and between the AD 
and the ND. Table 2 shows the mean total scores of ego functions and the mean

4. Discussion 
We aimed to clarify the ego functions of university students having a tendency 
to atypical depression. For this purpose, we compared those students with other 
students having a tendency to melancholic depression and borderline personali-
ty disorder to examine the hypothesis as mentioned above. However, the sub-
jects having a tendency to borderline personality disorder were removed from 
the analysis because the number of the subjects was too small for analysis. 
Therefore, the discussion shown below is based on the comparison between the 
group having a tendency to atypical depression (AD) and the group having a 
tendency to melancholic depression (MD). 
Our findings indicate no significant difference in the total score of the ego 
functions between the AD and the MD. The total score of the ego functions is 
considered to represent the overall functioning conditions of ego and the indi-
vidual’s adaptability as shown in Nakanishi & Sakata (1989). Further in our 
study, no significant differences were found in the scores of “synthetic-integrative 
functioning” and “autonomous functioning,” i.e., the subscale items of ego func-
tions, between the AD and the MD. As described in Bellak et al. (1973), the 
“synthetic-integrative functioning” is defined as the capacity to organize the 
disparate aspects of the personality, including intelligence and emotion into a 
unified structure; and the “autonomous functioning,” as the competence in op-
erating one’s memories and thoughts to control oneself in such a way as one in-
tends to do. Both of the above-mentioned functions are considered to form the 
basis of overall ego functions and support the individual adaptability. In light of 
this, our findings prove that fundamental and overall ego functions are not sig-
nificantly different between the AD and the MD. In other words, the hypothesis 
built up for this study was not verified. 
The hypothesis has been extracted from the findings about similarities be-
tween atypical depression and borderline personality disorder (Perugi & Akiskal, 
2002; Kaiya, 2008) and the findings about the organization of character pathol-
ogy related to the ego functions (Kernberg, 1976). To be more specific, atypical 
depression is similar to borderline personality disorder in the clinical pictures, so 
that the atypical depression is considered to be connected to the borderline cha-
racter and assumed to be in the lower level of organization of character patholo-
gy. Therefore, the patients with atypical depression are assumed to show lower 
ego functions than those with melancholic depression. On the other hand, as 
shown in West & Dally (1959) and Sargant (1962), the patients with atypical de-
pression are considered to have a hysterical character because those patients 
tend to become too reactive to stimulus and get hyperactive and aggressive, and 
then such a hysterical character is assumed to lead them into depression. Ac-
cording to the findings of West & Dally (1959) and Sargant (1962), it is consi-
dered that the patients with atypical depression have a hysterical character, not a

Psychology
 
borderline character, so that the organization level of character pathology of the 
patients with atypical depression is different from that of the patients with bor-
derline personality disorder. The hysterical character is regarded as the higher 
level of organization of character pathology (Kernberg, 1976), which is the same 
level of the depressive-masochistic character of the patients with melancholic 
depression, so that the conditions of the ego functions in the patients with atyp-
ical depression may not be different from those in the patients with melancholic 
depression. From the above, we can infer the reasons for our findings that there 
are no significant differences in the total score of ego functions and the respec-
tive scores of “synthetic-integrative functioning” and “autonomous functioning” 
between the AD and the MD. 
The results of this study also indicate that there is no significant difference 
between the AD and the MD in one of the ego functions, “sense of reality.” Bel-
lak et al. (1973) defines the “sense of reality” as one of the ego functions that can 
provide the basis for the ability to feel one’s connection to the world as real and 
feel a sense of self. According to the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013), atypical depression is characterized by expe-
riencing frequent swing in mood, resulting from “mood reactivity,” and having 
heavy, leaden feelings in arms and legs, that is, “leaden paralysis.” In contrast, 
the patients diagnosed to have melancholic depression present severe depression 
in a chronic form, caused by excessive guilt or the like. Anyway, the conditions 
of the patients with atypical depression and melancholic depression are both 
considered too severe to fully gain the ability to feel one’s connection to the 
world as real and feel a sense of self. This is supposed to be the reason why there 
was no significant difference in the “sense of reality” between the AD and the 
MD in our findings.   
Likewise, as for the subscale ego functions “objective relation” and “stimulus 
barrier,” the AD and the MD are not significantly different from each other. 
Bellak et al. (1973) defines the “objective relation” as the capacity to maintain 
mature interpersonal relationships; and the “stimulus barrier,” as the function of 
withstanding unpleasant stimuli. However, the diagnostic criteria for atypical 
depression provided by the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) in-
clude “interpersonal rejection sensitivity,” i.e., an excessively intense or sensitive 
reaction to others’ trifling words. It can be therefore speculated that the AD may 
show lower functions than the MD with respect to the “objective relation” and 
the “stimulus barrier.” According to Klein, Gittelman, Quitkin, & Rifkin (1980), 
the core impairment of atypical depression is considered to be the vulnerability 
of emotion regulation; and the dependence on others and the sensitivity to sti-
mulus, the secondary impairments. In fact, our findings indicate that the AD 
shows lower mean score of the “control of impulses,” which function is related 
to control of the impulses and emotions than the ND. The AD may represent 
more vulnerable emotion regulation, i.e., the core impairment of atypical de-
pression. However, the university students belonging to the AD in this study are

just showing a tendency to atypical depression, so that they may not reach the 
stage where the secondary impairments are indicated. This is supposed to be the 
reason that the AD and the MD are not significantly different from each other in 
the “objective relation” and the “stimulus barrier.” 
As previously discussed, significant differences are not found in many points 
between the AD and the MD in this study. However, only in the “defensive func-
tioning,” there is a significant difference between the AD and the MD. The AD 
shows higher “defensive functioning” than the MD. As in Bellak et al. (1973), the 
“defensive functioning” is defined as a function of protecting the ego by coping 
with conflicts and stresses. That is to say, the AD is considered to have more 
ability to cope with the conflicts and stresses and protect the ego than the MD. 
This can be supported by the description that the patients with atypical depres-
sion do not show chronic depression unlike the patients with melancholic de-
pression (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, the AD is sup-
posed to have problems in coping with the conflicts and stresses according to a 
study on the defense mechanisms used for coping with the conflicts and stresses 
(Hayashi, Takei, Fujimori, Takeuchi & Hono, in press). The above-mentioned 
study on the defense mechanisms assumes that the patients with atypical depres-
sion mainly use primitive defense mechanisms. The primitive defense mechan-
isms are used to promptly find relief from conflicts or stresses by expulsion of 
the conflicts or stresses (Klein, 1946), and are regarded as the lowest-level de-
fense mechanisms, observed in the severe psychotic state (Vaillant, 1986). Con-
sequently, the students having a tendency to atypical depression are found to 
protect the ego from conflicts better than the students having a tendency to me-
lancholic depression, but the protecting mechanisms are considerably maladap-
tive, which may result in their internal unstableness. 
It has been pointed out that the clinical pictures of the patients with atypical 
depression are considerably different from those of the patients with melanchol-
ic depression (Singh & Williams, 2006). As is apparent from our findings, how-
ever, there is no significant difference in ego functions between the AD and the 
MD with the exception of defensive functioning. In light of this, the ego func-
tions of the AD may be similar to those of the MD although the clinical pictures 
are different from each other. More detailed examination into the defensive 
functioning of the university students having a tendency to atypical depression 
will be important to understand their psychological mechanisms. It will be ne-
cessary to search for a more effective way of supporting those students through 
the examinations.
