Math Course of Study, Board Document 2015 
 
Introduction 
A team of professional, dedicated and knowledgeable K-12 district educators in the Forest Hills 
School District developed the Math Course of Study. This document was based on current research 
in mathematics content, learning theory and instructional practices. The Ohio’s New Learning 
Standards and Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All were the main resources 
used to guide the development and content of this document. 
  
While the Ohio Department of Education’s Academic Content Standards for School Mathematics 
was the main source of content, additional sources were used to guide the development of course 
indicators and objectives, including the College Board (AP Courses), Achieve, Inc. American 
Diploma Project (ADP), the Ohio Board of Regents Transfer Assurance Guarantee (TAG) criteria, 
and the Ohio Department of Education Program Models for School Mathematics. 
  
The Mathematics Course of Study is based on academic content standards that form an 
overarching theme for mathematics study. Six standards flow through mathematics instruction, 
preschool through high school.  The first five are: 1) Number, Number Sense and Operations, 2) 
Measurement, 3) Geometry and Spatial Sense, 4) Patterns, Functions and Algebra, and 5) Data 
Analysis and Probability. The sixth Standard is a process standard and includes: 1) Problem 
Solving, 2) Communication, 3) Connections, 4) Reasoning, and 5) Representation. 
  
The content in the Forest Hills School District Mathematics Course of Study reflects the skills, 
processes and knowledge we believe students in the Forest Hills School District need to know to be 
competent, knowledgeable and confident in their understanding of mathematics and in their ability 
to apply this understanding in future learning experiences. 
 
Philosophy 
Learning mathematics involves a variety of skills, processes and understandings. We support a 
balanced approach to teaching mathematics, which emphasizes both conceptual understanding 
and procedural fluency and which leads to increased mathematical proficiency for all students in 
Forest Hills. We believe students must have a comprehension of mathematical concepts, 
operations and relations as well as skill in carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently, 
and appropriately. This is best accomplished through a well-articulated, comprehensive, coherent 
and consistent mathematics curriculum in all Forest Hills schools, from early childhood years 
through high school graduation.  
 
Along with conceptual understanding and procedural fluency, students must also have an ability to 
formulate, represent and solve a variety of mathematical problems. Flexibility, creative thinking, and 
strategic competence are essential in today’s information-driven, quickly changing world. We strive 
to educate students who not only have the understanding of mathematical concepts and procedural 
fluency with mathematical skills but who can model mathematical situations appropriately and 
construct their own learning through carefully planned classroom experiences.

An ability to reason is essential, with a capacity for logical thought, reflection, explanation and 
justification. Communicating mathematically verbally and in written form is an important step in 
leading to greater mathematical proficiency, and all students should frequently be asked to reason, 
communicate, make connections, and represent mathematical ideas. 
 
We as educators will aspire to help all students learn to appreciate mathematics and see 
mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile, coupled with a belief in diligence and one’s own 
experience.  Research confirms that parent involvement is an important factor in student 
achievement. We encourage communication with parents about our mathematics teaching and 
learning and we value their support of the mathematics. 
 
None of the components mentioned above is independent, and all are interwoven and 
interdependent in the development of mathematical proficiency. The classroom teacher of 
mathematics is the most important factor in weaving the strands together through daily instruction, 
differentiating to meet the needs of all students, and collaborating with colleagues to help all 
students achieve success in mathematics learning.

Technology Statement 
As technology becomes essential in our daily activities, the world demands more technological 
expertise. The vast array of technologies available to teachers should be integrated as a modern 
tool of instruction to make mathematics more meaningful and accessible for all students. 
 
Forest Hills Calculator Belief Statements and Decision Making Framework:  
Calculators should be used when they enhance student learning. 
 
Calculators should be used when the computations become so cumbersome that they are an 
obstacle to learning higher-level concepts. 
 
Students should be taught how to use calculators in responsible and reasonable ways. Most 
importantly, students should be able to accurately interpret and understand the answers provided 
by a calculator.  
 
Students should be taught when to use a calculator and when mental computing is more effective 
or appropriate.  Choosing the right “tool” is part of an effective problem-solving process. 
 
Calculators are an essential tool: 
● for the discovery of generalizations or patterns within mathematics 
● when making sense of mathematics 
● for communicating mathematical thinking 
 
 
Forest Hills calculator belief statements are based upon: 
 
● 
The Ohio Department of Education Assessment Guidelines 
 
● 
Research highlighted in Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All. p. 78-83: 
“Despite popular belief, use of technology does not inhibit students’ learning of mathematics. The idea that 
it does is particularly prevalent regarding the use of calculators. However, after conducting a 
comprehensive literature review, Ronau and others (2011, p.1) concluded the following: 
 
In general, we found that the body of research consistently shows that the use of calculators in the 
teaching and learning of mathematics does not contribute to any negative outcomes for skill development 
or procedural proficiency, but instead enhances the understanding of mathematics concepts and student 
orientation toward mathematics.” 
 
● 
Standards for Mathematical Practice #5: 
Use appropriate tools strategically. 
Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving a mathematical problem. 
These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete models, a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a 
spreadsheet, a computer algebra system, a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient 
students are sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound decisions 
about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained and their 
limitations. For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and 
solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using 
estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that 
technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and 
compare predictions with data. Mathematically proficient students at various grade levels are able to 
identify relevant external mathematical resources, such as digital content located on a website, and use 
them to pose or solve problems. They are able to use technological tools to explore and deepen their 
understanding of concepts.

The following charts were developed by the West Virginia Department of Education for 
instructional decision making regarding the use of calculators. The Forest Hills Course of 
Study Committee endorses their use in lesson design, instructional planning, and 
assessment.

Section 2: FHSD Mathematical Practices 
 
The Standards for Mathematical Practices describe ways student practitioners are developed as 
they engage with content and develop a balanced combination of procedures, processes, and 
understanding. 
 
1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. 
2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively. 
3. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. 
4. Model with mathematics. 
5. Use appropriate tools strategically.  
6. Attend to precision. 
7. Look for and make use of structure. 
8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning. 
 
On the following pages you will find a snapshot of each practice by grade band. It includes a 
detailed definition, kid friendly “I can” statements, examples of teacher’s role and student’s role to 
guide a teacher’s instructional planning and integrate with the content standards. We use these 
practices to teach Ohio’s New Learning Standards.

The Forest Hills School District Mathematical Practices Look-For Tool was created through a K-12 
collaborative team while analyzing the practices both in the classroom and using current research. 
The tool was designed to be used by teachers to grow professionally through reflection of their 
practices.  An administrator or colleague can provide a teacher feedback using this tool 
constructively.

MP2 Reason abstractly and quantitatively  
Definition 
Students make sense of the quantities and use 
reasoning skills to understand relationship to the 
problem at hand.  Students reason and recognize 
that a number represents a specific quantity. They 
connect the quantity to written symbols and create a 
logical representation of the problem at hand, 
considering both the appropriate units involved and 
the meaning of quantities. Students can solve 
problems in context.  They can also pull out of a 
context to solve or represent with a number pattern.

MP1  Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. 
Definition 
Students engage in understanding and solving 
complex problems while looking for an entry 
point.  They consider all aspects of the problem and 
create a solution path before jumping in.  Students 
monitor progress and change pathways if necessary 
as they continually ask if their answer makes 
sense.  They can use alternate methods to check their 
answer and understand alternate methods.  Overall, 
students continually work towards a solution, 
overcoming mistakes or incorrect pathway attempts.

FHSD Standards for Mathematical Practice Look-for Tool 
 
The look-for tool was developed by the FHSD Course of Study Committee based off of the look-for 
tool created by the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics (NCSM.) 
 
“This look-for tool is a classroom resource that can be used as a non-evaluative assessment tool. 
The “look-fors” in this peer-observation tool are designed to assess the extent to which students are 
engaged in particular elements of the mathematical practices of the Common Core State Standards 
for mathematics. The tool provides suggested student responses for each of the mathematical 
practices as observational look-fors. These should be helpful in providing suggestions related to 
both planning and assessment for teachers, mathematical leaders and school based administrators. 
 
The look-fors in this peer observation tool are designed to measure how well the instructor has 
integrated the essence of the principles of the Common Core for the mathematics into their 
classroom. There are eight key mathematical practices with specific look-fors for both student and 
teacher behaviors. Noting the occurrence and totality of these look-fors can be helpful in providing 
feedback and guidance for the instructor.” NCSM

Mathematical Practice Classroom Visuals 
 
The FHSD Course of Study Committee designed and approved the visuals. These visuals will be 
used in the Forest Hills classrooms as reminders to administrators, teachers, and students as to the 
importance of the practices. The practices tell us “how” the mathematics should look in the 
classroom. 
 
Ideas of how to use the visuals 
● display the posters in the classroom, reference them with students 
● display student work next to the posters in the classroom 
● use the visuals on assignments as a reminder for students of the expectations in the 
classroom 
● post pictures of students “caught” in the act of one of the practices 
● use the visuals on parent newsletters to acquaint parents with the practices

Section 3: FHSD Mathematical Teaching Habits (NCTM) 
 
The teaching of mathematics is complex and requires teachers to have a deep understanding of the 
mathematical knowledge they are expected to teach. (Deborah Ball, NCTM) Teachers are expected 
to have a clear view of how student learning of that mathematics develops and progresses across 
grades. Also required of teachers is the need to be skilled at teaching in ways that effectively 
develop mathematics learning for all students. (Daro, Mosher, & Corcoran 2011)  
 
Research conducted from cognitive science (National Research Council 2012) and mathematics 
education (Donovan and Bransford 2005) supports characterization of mathematics as an active 
process. Students build on his or her own mathematical knowledge from personal experiences, 
coupled with feedback from peers, teachers, and other adults, and themselves. The research has 
identified a number of principles of learning that provide the foundation for effective mathematics 
teaching.  
 
The Eight Mathematics Teaching Practices (renamed, “Habits” by the FHSD course of study) 
provide a framework for strengthening the teaching and learning of mathematics. These habits 
represent a core set of high-leverage practices and essential teaching skills necessary to promote 
deep learning of mathematics. The eight practices are based on the research mentioned above. 
Forest Hills Course of Study Committee has agreed that these practices should guide our 
professional learning opportunities for our teachers. (NCTM) 
 
1. 
Establish mathematics goals to focus learning. 
2. 
Implement tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving. 
3. 
Use and connect mathematical representations. 
4. 
Facilitate meaningful mathematical discourse. 
5. 
Pose purposeful questions. 
6. 
Build procedural fluency from conceptual understanding. 
7. 
Support productive struggle in learning mathematics. 
8. 
Elicit and use evidence of student thinking. 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the book, Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All, from NCTM. For a copy of this book

1. Establish Mathematics Goals to Focus Learning 
 
Effective Teaching of Mathematics 
 establishes clear goals for the mathematics that students are learning 
 situates goals within learning progressions 
 uses the goals to guide instructional decisions 
 focuses student attention on monitoring their own progress toward the learning 
outcomes 
 
Teacher Actions 
Student Actions 
Establish clear goals that articulate the 
mathematics that students are learning as a 
result of instruction in a lesson, over a series of 
lessons, or throughout a unit. 
 
Identify how goals fit within a mathematics 
learning progression. 
 
Discuss and refer to the mathematical purpose 
and goal of a lesson during instruction to ensure 
that students understand how the current work 
contributes to their learning. 
 
Use the mathematics goals to guide lesson 
planning and reflection and to make in-the-
moment decisions during instruction. 
Engage in discussions of the mathematical 
purpose and goals related to their current work in 
the mathematical classroom (What are we 
learning? Why are we learning it?) 
 
Use the learning goals to stay focused on their 
progress in improving their understanding of 
mathematics content and proficiency in using 
mathematical practices. 
 
Connect their current work with the mathematics 
that they studied previously and see where the 
mathematics is going. 
 
Assess and monitor toward the mathematics 
learning goals. 
 
Instructional Research Based Strategies 
 
“formulating clear, explicit learning goals sets the stage for everything else” (Heibert) 
 
“goals should be situated within mathematical learning progressions and connected to the big ideas” (Daro, 
Mosher and Corcoran) 
 
“classrooms where students understand the learning expectations for their work perform at higher levels than 
those classrooms where it is unclear”(Marzano, Haystead, Hattie) 
 
 “student friendly goals can be discussed within a lesson so that students see value in and understand the 
purpose of their work” (Black and William, Marzano) 
 
“as teachers establish specific goals and consider the connections to broader math topics, they become more 
prepared to use goals to make decisions during instruction” (Hiebert)  
 
Important Instructional Considerations 
 
goals communicate what students will understand based on standards 
 
goals clarify and help teachers understand  the mathematical expectations for student learning. 
 
goals identify mathematical practices that students are learning to use more proficiently 
 
goals should not just be reiteration of standards but should be linked to curriculum and student learning 
 
goals should be situated within the mathematical landscape to support opportunities to build connections so that 
students see how ideas build 
 
mathematical purpose of the lesson should not be a mystery to students 
Standards for Mathematical Practice 
1.  Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. 
        
3.  Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. 
        
6.  Attend to precision.

2. Implement tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving 
 
Effective teaching of mathematics  
● engages students in solving and discussing tasks that promote mathematical 
reasoning and problem solving 
● allows for multiple entry points and varied solution strategies 
 
Teacher Actions 
Student Actions 
Motivate students’ learning of mathematics 
through opportunities for exploring and solving 
problems that build on and extend their current 
mathematical understanding.  
 
Select tasks that provide multiple entry points 
through the use of varied tools and 
representations.  
 
Pose tasks on a regular basis that require a high 
level of cognitive demand. Support students in 
exploring tasks without taking over student 
thinking.  
 
Encourage students to use varied approaches 
and strategies to make sense of and solve tasks. 
Persevere in exploring and reasoning through 
tasks. 
 
Take responsibility for making sense of tasks by 
drawing on and making connections with their 
prior understanding and ideas. 
 
Use tools and representations as needed to 
support their thinking and problem solving. 
 
Accept and expect that their classmates will use 
a variety of solution approaches and that they will 
discuss and justify their strategies to one another.  
 
Instructional Research Based Strategies 
● 
“...mathematical tasks are viewed as placing higher-level cognitive demands on students when they allow 
students to engage in active inquiry and exploration or encourage students to use procedures in ways that are 
meaningfully connected with concepts or understanding.” (Smith and Stein, 1998) Classrooms where high-level 
thinking and reasoning occurs shows the greatest student learning. 
● 
“Tasks that encourage students to use procedures, formulas, or algorithms in ways that are not actively linked to 
meaning, or that consist primarily of memorization or the reproduction of previously memorized facts, are viewed 
as placing lower-level cognitive demands on students.” (Smith and Stein, 1998) 
● 
A task should provide students with the opportunity to engage actively in reasoning, sense making, and problem 
solving so that they develop a deep understanding of mathematics (NCTM)  
Important Instructional Considerations 
● 
Provide rich, open ended tasks that allow for multiple solutions 
● 
Rich open ended task that promote reasoning and problem solving are in context and take an entire class period 
or more. 
● 
Model and use visual supports, explore patterns 
● 
Prior knowledge must be considered when considering the level of the cognitive demand. 
● 
Consider the four “Levels of Cognitive Demand”  from Smith and Stin 
● 
Use Webb’s Depths of Knowledge to guide high-level of task selection 
● 
Discussion strategies such as Harkness Method 
● 
Use of instructional strategy of, “Launch, Explore, Summarize” 
● 
Must engage on a regular basis in high level tasks to learn mathematics with understanding.

3. Use and Connect Mathematical Representations 
Effective teaching of mathematics  
● engages students in making connections among mathematical representations to 
deepen understanding of mathematics concepts and procedures and as tool for 
problem solving 
 
Teacher Actions 
Actions of Student 
Select tasks that allow students to decide which 
representations to use in making sense of the 
problems. 
 
Allocate substantial instructional time for students 
to use, discuss, and make connections among 
representations. 
 
Introduce forms of representations that can be 
useful to students. 
 
Ask students to make math drawings or use other 
visual supports to explain and justify their 
reasoning. 
 
Focus students’ attention on the structure or 
essential features of mathematical ideas that 
appear, regardless of the representation. 
 
Design ways to elicit and assess students’ abilities 
to use representations meaningfully to solve 
problems. 
Use and explore multiple forms of representation to 
make sense of and understand mathematics.   
 
Describe and justify mathematical understanding 
and reasoning using effective representations / 
drawings, diagrams, words, …. 
 
Make choices about which forms or representations 
to use as tools for solving problems.  
 
Make sense of problems through use of tables, 
drawings, diagrams and other representations. 
 
Connect mathematical ideas and concepts to real-
world situations and contexts.  
 
Consider advantages or suitability of using 
alternate representations when problem solving.   
 
 
Instructional Research Based Strategies 
● 
When students learn to represent, discuss, and make connections among mathematical ideas in multiple forms, 
they demonstrate a deeper understanding and enhanced problem-solving abilities. (Fuson, Kalchman, & 
Bransford 2005; Lesh, Post and Behr 1987) 
● 
Connections should be made among representations which include; visual, contextual, verbal, physical and 
symbolic. The multiple lenses of representation make the perspective of  the picture deeper and richer. 
● 
The depth of understanding is related to the strength of connections among mathematical representations that 
students have internalized. (Pape and Tchoshanov 2001; Webb, Boswinkel and Dekker 2008) 
● 
Visual representations are of particular importance in the mathematics classroom, helping students to advance 
their understanding of mathematical concepts and procedures, make sense of problems and engage in 
mathematical discourse. (Arcavi 2003; Stylianou and Silver 2004) 
● 
Success in solving problems is also related to students’ ability to move flexibly among representations. (Huinker 
2013; Stylianou and Silver 2004) 
Important Instructional Considerations 
● 
Math drawings and other visual supports are of particular importance for English language learners, learners with 
special needs, or struggling learners, because they allow more students to participate meaningfully in the 
mathematical discourse in the classroom (Fuson and Murata 2007). 
● 
Help students to see the connection between the different representations. It isn’t just about showing multiple 
ways but seeing that the representations are connected to each other mathematically. 
Standards for Mathematical Practice  
3.  Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. 
4.  Model with mathematics. 
5.  Use appropriate tools strategically.

4. Facilitate meaningful mathematical discourse. 
Effective teaching of mathematics 
● 
facilitates discourse among students to build shared understanding of mathematical ideas by analyzing and 
comparing student approaches and arguments 
 
Teacher Actions 
Student Actions 
Engage students in purposeful sharing of mathematical 
ideas, reasoning, and approaches, using varied 
representations. 
 
Scaffold student approaches and solution strategies for 
whole-class analysis and discussion. 
 
Facilitate discourse among students by having them 
justify and explain their reasoning for their answer and 
approach. 
 
Ensure progress toward mathematical goals by making 
explicit connections to student approaches and 
reasoning. 
Present and explain ideas, reasoning, and 
representations to one another in pairs, small-group, 
and whole-class discourse. 
 
Listen carefully to and critique the reasoning of peers, 
use examples to support or counterexamples to refute 
arguments. 
 
Seek to understand the approaches used by peers by 
asking clarifying questions, try out others’ strategies, 
and describe the approaches used by others.  
 
Identify how approaches to solving a task are the same 
and how they are different. 
 
Instructional Research Based Strategies 
 
Discourse that focuses on tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving is a primary mechanism for 
developing conceptual understanding and meaningful learning of mathematics.(Michaels, O’Conner and 
Resnick) 
 
Students who learn to articulate and justify their own mathematical ideas, reason through their own and others 
mathematical explanations, and provide a rationale for their answers develop a deep understanding that is 
critical to their future success in mathematics and related fields. (Carpenter, Franke, and Levi) 
 
Whole class discussions strategies to support discourse 
o 
anticipate student responses prior to the lesson 
o 
monitor students work and engagement with the tasks 
o 
select particular students’ responses in a specific order to promote a variety of strategies for conceptual 
understanding 
o 
sequencing student responses to scaffold the learning 
o 
connect different students’ responses to key mathematical ideas 
 
Mathematical discourse includes the purposeful exchange of ideas through classroom discussion as well as 
through other forms of verbal, visual, and written communication. 
 
Using discourse gives students opportunities to share ideas and clarify understandings, construct convincing 
arguments regarding why and how things work, develop a language for expressing mathematical ideas, and 
learn to see things from other perspectives. 
 
Teachers and students proceed through the levels in shifting from a classroom in which teachers play the leading 
role to one where they facilitate students’ mathematical thinking. 
Important Instructional Considerations 
 
Teacher Role- Students carry the conversation themselves. Teacher only guides from the periphery of the 
conversation. Teacher waits for the students to clarify thinking of others.   
 
Questioning- Student to student talk is student initiated. Students ask questions and listen to responses. 
Questions include asking, “why?” and calling for justification. Teacher questions may still guide discourse. 
 
Explaining Mathematical Reasoning- Teacher follows student explanations closely. Teacher asks students to 
contrast strategies. Students defend and justify their answers with little prompting from the teacher. 
 
Mathematical Representations- Students follow and help shape the descriptions of others math thinking through 
math representations and may suggest edits in other’s representation. 
 
Building student responsibility within the community- Students believe that they are math leaders and can help 
shape the thinking of others. They help shape others’ math thinking in supportive, collegial ways and accept the 
same support from others.   
 
Standards for Mathematical Practices 
1. 
Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. 
2. 
Reason abstractly and quantitatively. 
3. 
Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. 
4. 
Model with Mathematics. 

54 
6.    Attend to precision. 
       8.    Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

5. Pose purposeful questions 
Effective teaching of mathematics 
● Uses purposeful questions to assess and advance students’ ability to reason and 
make sense of important mathematical ideas & relationships 
 
Teacher Actions 
Student Actions 
Advance student understanding by asking 
questions that build on student thinking, but do 
not take over or funnel ideas to lead students to a 
desired conclusion. 
 
Ask questions that go beyond gathering 
information.  The questions should probe 
students’ thinking and require explanation and 
justification. 
 
Ask intentional questions that make the 
mathematics more visible and accessible for 
student examination and discussion. 
 
Allow sufficient wait time so that more students 
can formulate and offer responses. 
Expect to be asked to explain, clarify, and 
elaborate on their thinking verbally and in written 
format. 
 
Think carefully about how to present their 
responses to questions clearly, without rushing to 
respond quickly. 
 
Reflect on and justify their reasoning, not simply 
provide answers. 
 
Listen to, comment on, and question the 
contributions of their classmates.

 
Rigor Relevence Framework (Daggett, William) 
http://www.leadered.com/pdf/rigor_relevance_framework_2014.pdf 
A Framework for types of questions used in mathematics teaching (e.g. Boaler and Brodie 2004; Chapin and O’Connor 
2007) 
1. Gathering Information - Students recall facts, definitions, or procedures. ex. When you write an equation, what 
does that equal sign tell you?  What is the formula for finding the area of a rectangle? What does the interquartile 
range indicate for a set of data? 
 
2.  Probing Thinking - Students explain, elaborate, or clarify their thinking including articulating the steps in 
solution methods or the completion of a task. ex. As you drew that number line, what decisions did you make so 
that you could represent 7/4 on it?  Can you show and explain more about how you used a table to find the 
answer to the Smartphone Plans tasks?  It is still not clear how you figured out that 20 was the scale factor, so 
can you explain it another way? 
3.  Making the Mathematics Visible - Students discuss mathematical structures and make connections among 
mathematical ideas and relationships.  ex. What does your equation have to do with the band concert situation? 
How does that array relate to multiplication and division? In what ways might the normal distribution apply to this 
situation? 
 
4.  Encouraging Reflection and Justification - Students reveal deeper understanding of their reasoning and 
actions, including making an argument for the validity of their work.  ex. How might you prove that 51 is the 
solution? How do you know that the sum of two odd numbers will always be even? Why does plan A in the 
Smartphone Plans task start out cheaper but becomes more expensive in the long run? 
Important Instructional Considerations 
● 
Teacher plans questions that will be asked. 
● 
Questioning should encourage students to explain and reflect on their thinking and reasoning; leading them to a 
desired procedure or conclusion. 
● 
Questioning should allow teachers to discern what students know and adapt lessons to meet varied levels of 
understanding, help students make important mathematical connections and support students in posing their 
own questions. 

56 
● 
Questions should attend to what students are thinking, pressing them to communicate their thoughts clearly, and 
expecting them to reflect on their thoughts and those of their classmates. 
● 
Questioning should provoke connections to prior learning. 
● 
Questioning should promote use of appropriate vocabulary. 
● 
Use two types of questioning strategies for the teacher; funneling-a set of questions to lead students to a desired

● Become skillful in flexibly using procedures as they solve contextual and 
mathematical problems   
 
Teacher Actions 
Student Actions 
Acknowledge the importance of both conceptual 
understanding and procedural fluency but also 
ensure that the learning of procedures is 
developed over time, on a strong foundation of 
understanding and the use of student-generated 
strategies in solving problems.   
 
Provide students opportunities to use their own 
reasoning strategies and methods for solving 
problems.   
 
Ask students to discuss and explain why the 
procedures that they are using work to solve 
particular problems. 
 
Connect student generated strategies and 
methods to more efficient procedures as 
appropriate.   
 
Use visual models to support students’ 
understanding of general methods.   
 
Provide students with opportunities for 
continuous practice of procedures.   
 
Provide students time to practice math facts. 
Demonstrate the ability to choose flexibly among 
methods and strategies to solve contextual and 
mathematical problems, they understand and are 
able to explain their approaches, and they are 
able to produce accurate answers efficiently. 
 
Demonstrate knowledge by practicing on a 
moderate number of carefully selected problems 
once they have a strong conceptual foundation 
and can explain the use of the strategy. 
 
Access procedures that they can use with 
understanding on a broad range of problems. 
 
Know which procedure is appropriate and most 
productive in a given situation.

Math Rep District Suggestions for Achieving Procedural Fluency from Conceptual Understanding 
After researching procedural fluency, fact fluency, best practice for learning addition/subtraction and multiplication/division 
facts and other operational procedures, the 2015-2016 FHSD Math Reps created a document to help the teachers of 
Forest Hills use best practice to move students from conceptual understanding to fluency with facts and procedures as 

58 
identified in Ohio’s Learning Standards. 
  
The document linked after this paragraph, uses DuFour’s four questions to identify at each grade level what is expected to 
be learned, how we should check to see if what they have learned and then suggestions of what to do if they don’t have 
fluency and what to do if they have fluency based on the assessment suggestions.

7.  Support productive struggle in learning mathematics 
Effective teaching of mathematics 
● Consistently provides students with opportunities and supports to engage in 
productive struggle 
● Opportunities for delving more deeply into understanding the mathematical ideas 
● Able to apply their learning to new problem situations 
 
Teacher Actions 
Student Actions 
Anticipate what students might struggle with 
during a lesson and being prepared to support 
them productively through the struggle. 
 
Give students time to struggle with tasks, and 
asking questions that scaffold students’ thinking 
without stepping in to do the work for them. 
 
Help students realize that confusion and errors 
are a natural part of learning, by facilitating 
discussion on mistakes, misconceptions, and 
struggles. 
 
Praise students for their efforts in making sense 
of mathematical ideas and perseverance in 
reasoning through problems.  
Struggle at times with mathematics tasks but 
knowing that breakthroughs often emerge from 
confusion and struggle. 
 
Ask questions that are related to the sources of 
their struggles and will help them make progress 
in understanding and solving tasks. 
 
Persevere in solving problems and realizing that 
it is acceptable to say, “I don’t know how to 
proceed here,” but it is not acceptable to give up. 
 
Help one another without telling their classmates 
what the answer is or how to solve the problem. 
 
Instructional Research Based Strategies 
● 
“Rescuing” students when they face difficulties undermines the efforts of students, lowers the cognitive demands 
of the task, and deprives the students of opportunities to engage fully in making sense of the mathematics. 
(Reinhart 2000; Stein et al. 2009) 
● 
“If you are not struggling, you are not learning”. (Carter 2008, p.136) 
● 
Provide students with specific descriptive feedback on their progress related to their making sense of math. 
(Clarke 2003; Hattie and Timperley 2007) 
●

● 
Insert a statement from Cathy Seeley here 
Important Instructional Considerations 
● 
Create a safe environment for learning. 
● 
Consider and address student struggles and misconceptions. 
● 
Consider and discuss growth mindset and the importance of mistakes for learning. 
● 
Classrooms should embrace productive struggle to necessitate rethinking on the part of both the teacher and 
student.  
● 
Students question and critique the reasoning of their peers and reflect on their own understanding in an 
appropriate manner. 
● 
Students have access to tools that will support their thinking processes.  
● 
Teacher plans for tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving; a solution pathway is not straightforward, 
but requires some struggle to arrive at the solution. 
● 
Model productive struggle and how to generate conversations between students.

8. Elicit and use evidence of student thinking 
Effective teaching of mathematics 
● Uses evidence of student thinking to assess progress toward understanding 
● Uses evidence to adjust instruction continually in ways that support and extend 
learning 
 
Teacher Actions 
Student Actions 
Identify what counts as evidence of student 
progress toward mathematics learning goals. 
(Formative Assessment)  
 
Elicit and gather evidence of student 
understanding at strategic points during 
instruction.  
 
Interpret student thinking to assess mathematical 
understanding, reasoning and methods.  
 
Make in-the-moment decisions on how to 
respond to students with questions and prompts 
that probe, scaffold, and extend.  
 
Reflect on evidence of student learning to inform 
the planning of next instructional steps.  
Reveal mathematical understanding, reasoning, 
and methods in written work and classroom 
discourse. 
 
Reflect on mistakes and misconceptions to 
improve their mathematical understanding. 
 
Ask questions, respond to, and give suggestions 
to support the learning of their classmates. 
 
Assess and monitor their own progress toward 
mathematics learning goals and identifying areas 
in which they need to improve. 
Instructional Research Based Strategies 
 
Attention to eliciting and using evidence is an essential component of formative assessment. (William 2007a) 
 
“Teachers using assessment for learning continually look for ways in which they can generate evidence of 
student learning, use this evidence to adapt their instruction to better meet their students’ learning needs.” 
(Leahy, 2005) 
 
“Identifying indicators of what is important to notice in students’ mathematical thinking, planning for ways to elicit 
that information, interpreting what the evidence means with respect to students’ learning, and then deciding how 
to respond on the basis of students’ understanding.” (Jacobs, Lamb, & Philipp 2010: Sleep and Boerst 2010; van 
Es 2010)  
Important Instructional Considerations 
● 
What mathematical domain is being taught 
● 
Developmental considerations 
● 
“Teachers attend to more than just whether an answer is or is not correct.” (Crespo 2000)  
● 
Each lesson needs to include intentional and systematic plans to elicit evidence that will provide information 
about how student learning is evolving toward the desired goal. (Heritage 2008, p. 6)

Section 4: Response to Intervention 
 
The Forest Hills Way… 
We believe all students can learn.  We also believe that to truly be a high achieving district, we must 
meet the varying needs of our students from support instruction to rigorous 
coursework to enrichment opportunities.  By using a systematic approach to know our students as 
learners including data analysis and Response to Intervention we maximize the learning potential 
for individual students.  RTI provides a framework for this. 
  
A multi-tiered system of support is put in place, including strong core curriculum and differentiated 
instruction at a Tier 1 (classroom) level. Response to Intervention (RTI) includes screening of all of 
our students, and utilization of data to guide educational decisions in a problem solving 
model.   Much as doctors use screens such as temperature and blood pressure checks to help 
determine which patients may require a deeper diagnosis with possible treatment and 
monitoring,  we use a universal screener, to help identify students who need further attention and 
more careful consideration.  The purpose of screening activities is to predict possible academic and 
behavior problems as well as to identify areas of student strength.  Students demonstrating needs, 
based on data based decision rules will receive instruction and proven, research based intervention 
at varying levels of intensity.  By monitoring student achievement throughout intervention, we are 
able to adjust the level of needed support.

Mathematics and the Gifted Student 
Forest Hills School District provides a “Math Plus” class to students in grades 4, 5, and 6. 
This daily advanced math class includes interdisciplinary units connecting math curriculum to 
Language Arts, Social Studies and Science content. This class is designed for students 
identified as Superior Cognitive on a state approved standardized intelligence test OR with a 
cognitive ability of 122 or above and a Math Achievement composite score of 97th percentile 
or above on the most recently administered nationally normed tests that are on the state 
approved list. 
 
Ohio’s New Learning Standards provide the foundation for the curriculum within the “Math 
Plus” class along with additional supplemental materials that challenge high cognitive or high 
math ability students. Differentiation for these students is critical due to their vastly different 
academic and social needs. 
 
Instruction within the Math Plus classroom combines rigorous problem solving strategies with 
compacted daily instruction in math. This instruction includes extensions allowing students to 
explore areas of interest and talent. Students explore mathematical processes through 
inquiry to become innovators of mathematical applications. The instruction provides 
opportunities for students to learn beyond the curriculum in problem-based learning applying 
their knowledge to real world problems. Students are guided as they explore their passions 
in 21st century learning.  Students also are challenged to discover more about themselves 
as the social emotional needs of gifted students are nurtured.
