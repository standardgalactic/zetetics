ABSTRACT
Wave breaking is a highly dissipative process, and also a source of turbulence
in the ocean surface layer. It entrains a large volume of air in bubbles that rapidly
evolves into a distribution of bubble sizes which interacts with liquid turbulence and
organized motions. The liquid-bubble interaction, especially in the complex two-phase
bubbly ﬂow under breaking waves, is still poorly understood. In the present study,
we perform a large-eddy simulation (LES) using a Navier-Stokes solver extended to
incorporate entrained bubble populations, using an Eulerian-Eulerian formulation for
a polydisperse bubble phase. The volume of ﬂuid (VOF) method is used for free sur-
face tracking. We consider an isolated unsteady deep water breaking event imposed
by a focussed wave packet. The bubble-induced dissipation and momentum transfer
between two phases are considered. The model is shown to predict free surface evolu-
tion, mean and turbulent velocities and integral properties of the entrained dispersed
bubbles (hereafter bubble plume) fairly well. We investigate bubble plume kinemat-
ics and dynamics, turbulence modulation by dispersed bubbles as well as shear- and
bubble-induced dissipation, both in spilling and plunging breakers. We ﬁnd that the
total bubble-induced dissipation accounts for more than 50% of the total dissipation
in the breaking region. The averaged dissipation rate per unit length of breaking crest
is usually written as bρg−1c5, where c is the phase speed of the breaking wave. The
breaking parameter, b, has been poorly constrained by experiments and ﬁeld measure-
ments. We examine the time dependent evolution of b for both constant-steepness and
constant-amplitude wave packets. The scaling law for the averaged breaking parame-
ter is obtained. The exact two-phase transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy
(TKE) is compared to the conventional single phase transport equation, and it is found
that the former over predicts the total SGS dissipation and turbulence production by
xiv

mean shear during active breaking. All of the simulations are repeated without the
inclusion of dispersed bubble phase, and it is shown that the integrated TKE in the
breaking region is damped by the dispersed bubbles about 20% for the large plunging
breaker to 50% for the spilling breakers. In the plunging breakers, TKE is damped
slightly or even enhanced during the initial stage of active breaking. In addition, we
examine the nonlinear interaction of diﬀerent components in a wave packet. Phase
locking between spectral components is observed in the breaking region, and explained
by calculating the wavelet bispectrum.

INTRODUCTION
Surface wave breaking is a complex two phase ﬂow phenomenon that has an
important role in numerous environmental processes, such as air-sea transfer of gas,
momentum and energy, acoustic underwater communications and optical properties of
the water column. Wave breaking is a highly dissipative process, limiting the height of
surface waves. It is also a source of turbulence which enhances transport and mixing
in the ocean surface layer. It entrains a large volume of air in bubbles that rapidly
evolves into a distribution of bubble sizes which interacts with liquid turbulence and
organized motions.
Several experimental studies in a vertical bubble column (e.g.
Lance & Bataille 1991) revealed that the motion of the bubbles relative to the liq-
uid causes velocity ﬂuctuations in the latter and increases the energy of the scales
comparable to the bubble diameter. This additional bubble-induced turbulence, com-
monly called ”pseudo-turbulence,” is more noticeable during active breaking in which
the Kolmogorov length scale is much smaller than the mean diameter of the entrained
bubbles. At larger scales, on the other hand, the presence of bubbles can modify liquid
turbulence by changing the velocity gradients and the associated change in turbulence
production. In addition, work done by the inhomogeneous interfacial forces on the wa-
ter column can modify larger scale turbulent motions. In shallow water and nearshore
regions, this process even becomes more complicated when the bottom eﬀects and
sediments alter the ﬂow ﬁeld.
Bubble plume kinematics and dynamics, and turbulence structures of the bub-
bly ﬂow under breaking waves are the two main factors that come into play in all of
the above mentioned processes (Melville 1996). While the former is well studied exper-
imentally, liquid-bubble interaction, i.e. the eﬀects of dispersed bubbles on organized
1

and turbulent motions, is still an open question. Our goal is to have a time-dependent
model to resolve both bubble entrainment and transport as well as the large scale of
turbulence structures during active breaking. The model must account for turbulence
modulation induced by dispersed bubbles and the momentum transfer between two
phases. In addition, the large scale free surface features should be captured in order
to truly resolve vorticity generation during the jet impact and subsequent splash-up
processes.
There are several important reviews on the topic of wave breaking (Banner
& Peregrine 1993, Melville 1996, Duncan 2001). Recently, Kiger & Duncan (2012)
reviewed the mechanisms of air entrainment in plunging jets and breaking waves. Fur-
thermore, Perlin et al. (2012) summarized the diﬀerent aspects of deep water breaking
waves such as geometry, breaking onset and energy dissipation. To summarize the rel-
evant literature on deep water breaking waves, we ﬁrst review the experimental studies
of bubble void fraction as well as velocity ﬁeld and turbulence, then we discuss the
relevant numerical studies.
Many previous researchers have measured air void fraction in the bubbly ﬂow
under breaking waves (Lamarre & Melville 1991, 1994, Deane & Stokes 2002, Cox &
Shin 2003, Blenkinsopp & Chaplin 2007, Rojas & Loewen 2010). Using a conductivity
probe, (Lamarre & Melville 1991, hereafter referred to as LM) and Lamarre & Melville
(1994) measured time-dependent void fraction distributions of focused waves with a
constant component steepness. They calculated area, volume, mean void fraction and
centroids of the bubble plume. It was shown that these integral properties evolved
as a simple function of time and scaled fairly well from small two-dimensional (2D)
to larger three-dimensional (3D) laboratory breaking waves. The results showed that
the degassing rate was very quickly, and less than 5% of the initial entrained bubbles
remained in the water column one period after breaking. They found that the potential
energy of the bubble plume can be 30 to 50% of the total energy dissipated by breaking.
Deane & Stokes (2002) used a high-speed video camera to measure the bubble size
distributions under the laboratory scale breaking imposed by the focused wave method.
2

They divided the entrainment process into two distinct mechanisms controlling the
bubble size distribution. The ﬁrst is turbulent fragmentation of the entrapped cavity,
which is largely responsible for bubbles larger than the Hinze scale, leading to a bubble
number density proportional to r−10/3
b
, where rb is the bubble radius. The second is
jet interaction and drop impact on the wave face, resulting in smaller bubbles with a
number density proportional to r−3/2
b
. Small bubbles were entrained for a longer time
but larger bubbles were created after cavity fragmentation and degassed relatively
quickly. Blenkinsopp & Chaplin (2007) used two optical ﬁbers to measure the time-
dependent void fraction under breaking waves.
Breaking waves were produced by
propagating regular waves over a submerged sloping reef structure. They also found
that the integral properties of the bubble plume evolved as a simple function of time.
They showed that the bubble plume volume grew linearly to a maximum and then
decayed exponentially in time, with the ratio of maximum volume of the entrained air
to the initial air tube entrapped by the jet lying between 1.3 and 1.6. They estimated
the work required to entrain bubbles against buoyancy was about 4 to 9% of the total
dissipation.
(Rapp & Melville 1990, hereafter referred to as RM) used LDV and measured
ensemble averaged mean and turbulent velocities on a regular grid in the breaking
region of a focused wave packet.
They found energy dissipation by breaking from
10% to more than 25% of pre-breaking wave energy for spilling and plunging breakers
respectively, with about 90% of the total dissipation occurring within four wave periods.
Total TKE in the breaking region were found to subsequently decay like (t −tob)−1,
where tob is an observed breaking time. Melville et al. (2002) and (Drazen & Melville
2009, hereafter referred to as DM) used DPIV and investigated post breaking velocity
ﬁeld and turbulence, with the work by DM having a ﬁner spatial resolution. All the
information was only available starting about 3 periods after breaking in which nearly
all of the entrained bubbles were degassed and most of the energy was dissipated. DM
chose a plunging breaker imposed by a focus wave packet with a constant component
steepness. Ensemble-averaged quantities such as mean and turbulent velocity, TKE
3

and Reynolds stress were presented. They computed turbulent wavenumber spectra
and horizontally averaged terms in the TKE budget up to 27 periods after breaking. In
addition, estimates of the dissipation rate were given. Total TKE was seen to depend
approximately on (t −tob)−0.75 while the surface waves are present, and then begins to
decay faster for t∗> 12, where t∗is given by (3.1) below. In all three experiments, a
large coherent vortex structure was seen in the ensemble-averaged velocity ﬁeld. It is
clear this type of breaking diﬀers from quasi-steady breaking since the turbulent region
has a ﬁnite length, propagating downstream very slowly compared to phase velocity
and deepening.
Measurement of a 3D velocity ﬁeld in a turbulent bubbly ﬂow under breaking
waves is very diﬃcult. In addition, there is no way to exclude entrained bubbles under
breaking waves in experimental studies. As a result, it is not possible to examine tur-
bulence and organized ﬂow modulations by entrained dispersed bubbles. The available
experimental studies which examined bubble-induced turbulence and liquid-bubble in-
teraction are done mostly in a vertical bubble column with a homogeneous swarm
of bubbles released at the bottom of a tank. Numerical models, on the other hand,
make it possible to study liquid-bubble interactions under breaking waves. In general,
we can divide Eulerian-Eulerian numerical models of bubbly ﬂows into discrete and
continuous models. In the discrete type models, the interface between an individual
bubble and the liquid is resolved. Obviously, the possible bubble diameter which can
be resolved is limited to the grid resolution. To account for bubble size distribution
under breaking waves, we need to have a very ﬁne grid resolution about two orders
of magnitude smaller than typical LES resolution. In the continuous type models, in-
stead, the interface between an individual bubble and the liquid is not resolved, and
the interfacial momentum transfers are considered using the closure models. A critical
issue in this approach, especially under breaking waves, is accurately introducing air
bubbles into a model using a bubble entrainment formulation (Moraga et al. 2008, Shi
et al. 2010, Ma et al. 2011).
As summarized by Perlin et al. (2012), most of the numerical simulations for
4

deep water breaking waves are limited to the evolution of a periodic unstable wave
train with relatively low-Reynolds numbers (∼104) and short wave lengths (< 0.3m)
(Chen et al. 1999, Song & Sirviente 2004, Lubin et al. 2006, Iafrati 2009, 2011, Lubin
& Glockner 2013).
This artiﬁcial way of leading a wave train to breaking has an
advantage in that it represents a more compact computational problem. However, it is
not possible to do comparisons with experimental data, except in a qualitative sense.
In addition, it is well known that, at such a short scale, surface tension signiﬁcantly
aﬀects the breaking process and fragmentation of bubbles. Furthermore, although wave
breaking is initially a fairly 2D event, the entrainment process is highly 3D even in the
case of a small scale plunger where surface tension appears to be playing a strong role
(Kiger & Duncan 2012). Thus, 2D frameworks can not accurately account for bubble
transport and vorticity evolution during and after breaking. These issues suggest that
the extension of the results to larger scales has to be done rather cautiously. In these
discrete numerical studies, the Navier-Stokes equations are solved both in air and
water with a relatively ﬁne spatial resolution that can resolve cavity fragmentation
to some extent. Although the density and viscosity of the gas is not equal to real
air in most of the previous simulations, consideration of the gas phase considerably
increased the computational eﬀort. Chen et al. (1999) performed a 2D direct numerical
simulation (DNS) of the two-ﬂuid Navier-Stokes equations combined with the VOF
method for surface tracing. They chose a density ratio of 0.01 and a viscosity ratio of
0.4 and found that 80% of the wave energy was dissipated within three wave periods
after breaking, and that the temporal evolution of the total mechanical energy had a
(t −tob)−1 dependence. Lubin et al. (2006) did a 3D LES with the real density and
viscosity ratio and found a (t −tob)−0.3 dependence for the total mechanical energy
evolution.
Both simulations captured the sequence of splashes but no quantitative
estimates of the entrapped air were given. Iafrati (2009) did a 2D DNS of the two-ﬂuid
Navier-Stokes equations combined with a level-set method to capture the interface.
The real density ratio was chosen, but the viscosity ratio was set to 0.4. He examined
the eﬀects of breaking intensity (with initial steepness over the range ka = 0.2 −0.65)
5

on the resulting ﬂow. It was concluded that major energy dissipation occurs locally at
the region of small bubbles generated by the fragmentation of the air cavity entrapped
by the plunging jet. A scaling law for the amount of air entrapped as a function of
the initial wave steepness was found. Iafrati (2011) continued his previous work with
focus on the early stage of breaking. The diﬀerent contributions to energy dissipation
was estimated for the diﬀerent initial steepnesses. He found, in the plunging case,
that a fraction between 10 to 35% of the energy dissipated during breaking was spent
in entraining the air cavity against the action of buoyancy force, and most of it was
dissipated by viscous eﬀects when the cavity collapsed.
The ﬁrst attempt to use a continuous type model for studying bubbly ﬂow under
breaking waves, to the knowledge of the authors, was done by Shi et al. (2010). They
used a 2D VOF based mixture model, with a k −ε turbulence closure, to study air
bubble evolution in an isolated unsteady breaking wave in a laboratory scale event.
They used an air bubble entrainment formula which connected shear production at the
air-water interface and the bubble number density with the bubble size distributions
suggested by Deane & Stokes (2002). The bubble velocities were calculated directly by
adding the rise velocities to the liquid velocity, and the additional terms were used both
in k and ε transport equations to account for the bubble-induced turbulence. They
argued that, with an appropriate parameter in the bubble entrainment formula, the
model is able to predict the main features of bubbly ﬂows as evidenced by reasonable
agreement with measured void fraction. Ma et al. (2011) incorporated a polydisperse
two-ﬂuid model into the VOF based Navier-Stokes solver TRUCHAS (Rider & Kothe
1998). They proposed an entrainment model that connected bubble entrainment with
turbulent dissipation rate, ε, at the air-water interface. The model was tested against
the laboratory experimental data for an oscillatory bubble plume and the bubbly ﬂow
under a laboratory surf zone breaking wave using 2D simulations with a k −ε turbu-
lence closure in conjunction with the additional terms to account for bubble-induced
turbulence. The exponential decay in time of void fraction observed in the labora-
tory experiments was captured by the model. The kinematics of the bubble plume, as
6

well as the evolution of the bubble size spectrum over depth, were investigated. They
employed a bubble breakup model proposed by Mart´ınez-Baz´an et al. (1999a,b) and
showed that the model reproduced the −10/3 dependence for bubbles greater than the
Hinze scale, consistent with the observation of Deane & Stokes (2002). Ma (2012) and
Kirby et al. (2012) extended the model to a LES framework with a constant Smagorin-
sky subgrid formulation for turbulence closure. They investigated surf zone breaking
and found that the integrated void fraction has a linear growth and exponential decay
in time. They showed that, as the vortices move downward, bubbles are transported
to the lower part of the water column and concluded that the turbulent coherent struc-
tures tend to transport bubbles more deeply into the water column. Based on both
the 2D and 3D simulations, they found that the presence of bubbles suppresses liquid
phase turbulence and enstrophy.
Here, we extend an Eulerian-Eulerian polydisperse two-ﬂuid model (Ma et al.
2011) to a LES framework with the dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid formulation for
turbulence closure. To carefully validate the model against the detailed experimen-
tal studies as well as decrease the scale eﬀects, the laboratory scale breaking waves
imposed by a focussed wave packet is selected. In this paper, we concentrate on span-
wise averaged quantities. The integral properties of the bubble plume, as well as the
spanwise averaged mean and turbulent velocity ﬁelds during active breaking and their
evolution, are compared to the available experiments. Dispersed bubble eﬀects on the
organized and turbulent motions and the diﬀerent dissipation mechanisms are investi-
gated. In addition, we examine the nonlinear interaction of diﬀerent components in a
wave packet. The 3D characteristics of the process, including wave induced coherent
structures and their interaction with the entrained bubbles, are left for a subsequent
paper.
In §2, the mathematical formulations and main assumptions are discussed. In
§3, the corresponding experiments and mesh size selection for the 3D simulations are
explained. In §4, the results of the 3D simulations are presented. Conclusions are given
in §5.

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION AND NUMERICAL METHOD
Lakehal et al. (2002) derived the ﬁltered two-ﬂuid model for a monodisperse bub-
bly ﬂow. Using the multi-group approach explained by Carrica et al. (1999), bubbles
are divided into NG groups with a characteristic diameter, and the ﬁltered polydis-
perse two-ﬂuid model is derived based on the ﬁltered monodisperse two-ﬂuid model.
In this section, we quickly review the traditional two-ﬂuid model and work by Lake-
hal et al. (2002), and then the extension to the polydisperse two-ﬂuid model and the
corresponding main assumptions are discussed.
2.1
The Filtered Two-Fluid Equations
The ﬁltered two-ﬂuid model is obtained by applying a certain averaging process
on the microscopic, instantaneous equations governing each phase evolving in the mix-
ture. The conservation laws for each phase can be written using the phase indicator
function χ(x, t) at time t and point x, deﬁned by (Drew 1983)
χk(x, t) =



1
if x lies in phase k at time t
0
otherwise
(2.1)
to determine volumes occupied by each phase. k refers either to the gas phase or to the
liquid phase. In the absence of heat and mass transfer, the continuity and momentum
equations for each phase can be written as
∂
∂t(χkρk) + ∂
∂xj
(χkρkuk
j) = 0
(2.2)

(2.3)

where ρk is the phase density, uk is the phase velocity, and g is gravitational accelera-
tion. The phase net stress, composed of the pressure contribution, pk, and the viscous
stress σk
ij, is deﬁned by Πk
ij = −pkδij + σk
ij. In a Newtonian ﬂuid,
σk
ij = ρkνk(∂uk
i
∂xj
+ ∂uk
j
∂xi
)
(2.4)
where νk is the phase kinematic viscosity.
Within the LES framework, a ﬁltering process is utilized which is deﬁned by
f(x) =
Z
D
G(x −x
′; ∆)f(x
′)d3x
′,
(2.5)
where D is the domain of the ﬂow, G(x−x
′; ∆) represents a spatial ﬁlter, and ∆is the
ﬁlter width which should strictly be larger than the characteristic length scale of the
dispersed phase. With this operator, the volume fraction of phase k can be deﬁned by
αk(x) = χk(x).
(2.6)
As carried out by Lakehal et al. (2002), the ﬁltered equations are obtained by adopting
a component-weighted volume-averaging procedure, in which
˜f k = χkf k
χk
= χkf k
αk .
(2.7)
By applying the above deﬁnition to (2.2) and (2.3) and ignoring surface tension eﬀects,
the ﬁltered Eulerian-Eulerian equations are obtained (Lakehal et al. 2002),
∂

(2.10)
is the subgrid scale (SGS) stress. Interphase momentum exchanges Mk and SGS stress
τ k
ij are the two unresolved terms in (2.9); our treatment of them will be explained in
the following sections.
Equations (2.8) and (2.9) can be easily extended for the polydisperse two-ﬂuid
model by neglecting the momentum exchanges between bubble groups as in Carrica
et al. (1999) and Ma et al. (2011). To simulate polydisperse bubbly ﬂow, the dispersed
bubble phase is separated into NG groups. Each group has a characteristic bubble
diameter db
k, k = 1, 2, · · · , NG and a corresponding volume fraction αb
k. By deﬁnition,
the volume fraction of all of the phases must sum to one:
αl +

k = 1,
(2.11)
where superscripts l and b refer to liquid and bubble phase respectively. The volume

(2.12)
where mb

consist of mass conservation for liquid phase,

k is the source for the kth
bubble group due to air entrainment and Sb
k is the intergroup mass transfer which
only accounts for bubble breakup in the present study (Moraga et al. 2008, Ma et al.
2011). The bubble breakup model proposed by Mart´ınez-Baz´an et al. (1999a,b, 2010) is
employed. Db

which satisfy the following relationship,

2.2
Interfacial Momentum Exchange
For a single particle moving in a ﬂuid, the force exerted by the continuous phase
on the particle includes drag, lift, virtual mass and Basset history forces. These forces
are well established in the literature for both laminar and turbulent ﬂows (Clift et al.
(1978), Maxey & Riley (1983) and Magnaudet & Eames (2000), among many others).
By neglecting the Basset history force, the ﬁltered interfacial forces can be formulated
as below (Lakehal et al. 2002),

Note that in
pure water, with no contamination, the bubble drag coeﬃcient is smaller than (2.20).
As explained by Clift et al. (1978), the presence of surfactants, which is usually the
case in laboratory condition and the real world, increases the drag force so that drag
corresponds frequently to that of a solid sphere of the same size given by (2.20). Finally,
an inherent assumption in (2.19) is that SGS eﬀects on the interfacial forces are assumed
to be negligibly small.
2.3
Bubble Entrainment Model
As already mentioned, a detailed examination of the process of bubble entrain-
ment needs much more resolution than we have. Instead, dispersed bubbles are intro-
duced into the water column using an entrainment model. Ma et al. (2011) correlated
the bubble entrainment rate with the shear induced turbulence dissipation rate, εl,
which is available in the RANS framework. In the present LES framework, we use
the formulation of Ma et al. (2011) but change εl to the shear induced production
rate of SGS kinetic energy, εl
sgs,SI (sometimes called the SGS dissipation rate) which
12

represents the rate of transfer of energy from the resolved to the SGS motions, given
by (2.30). For polydisperse bubbles, the formulation is

where cb is the bubble entrainment parameter and has to be calibrated in the simula-
tion. σ is surface tension, ak is the characteristic radius of each bubble group, ∆ak is
the width of each bubble group and f(ak) is the bubble size spectrum. As in Ma et al.
(2011) and Shi et al. (2010), we use the size spectrum suggested by Deane & Stokes
(2002),

where ah = 1.0mm is taken to be the Hinze scale, to distribute generated bubbles
across the NG bubble groups. Bubbles are entrained at the free surface cells if εl
sgs,SI
is larger than a critical value, εl
c, which is set to 0.01 m2s−3.
2.4
Subgrid-Scale Model
The turbulent velocities in the continuous phase can arise from (a) bubble agi-
tations, e.g. turbulent wakes behind individual bubbles, and (b) large scale ﬂow insta-
bilities, e.g. shear induced instability (Fox 2012). In a continuous LES framework in
which individual bubbles are not resolved and the ﬁlter width is in the inertial sub-
range, the main dissipative scales of motions are not resolved, and then transferring the
energy from the resolved to SGS scales through shear- and bubble-induced dissipation
should be modeled appropriately. The most widely used and simplest SGS model is
the Smagorinsky model (Smagorinsky 1963) in which the anisotropic part of the SGS
stress τ l,d
ij is related to the resolved rate of strain,
τ l,d

BI is the eddy
viscosity of the SGS motions which is calculated using linear superposition of both the

ﬁlter and ˜

ij is the norm of the resolved strain rate tensor.
The Cs can be chosen as a constant (0.1 ∼0.2) or determined dynamically.
Although the constant Smagorinsky model (CSM) is fairly good at fully turbulent ﬂows
with simple geometries (e.g. turbulent channel ﬂow), it is too dissipative near the wall,
in laminar and transition ﬂows. A near-wall function can be used to give better behavior
close to walls, but the extra dissipation can not be removed in transitional turbulence
generated under breaking waves. In the case of deep water unsteady breaking, this is
more important because we have a localized, unsteady TKE plume with relatively high
intensity at the initial stage of the breaking, which gradually becomes more uniform
and is mixed down to a greater depth. Shen & Yue (2001) studied interaction between a
turbulent shear ﬂow and a free surface at low Froude numbers using single phase Navier-
Stokes equations. The DNS results showed that the amount of energy transferred from
the grid scales to the SGS reduced signiﬁcantly as the free surface was approached. As
a result, the coeﬃcient Cs should decrease towards the free surface (Shen & Yue 2001,
Figure 6a), which is not captured in CSM and leads to excessive dissipation near the
free surface. The dynamic Smagorinsky models (DSM), on the other hand, provide
a methodology for determining an appropriate local value for Cs, where turbulent
viscosity converges to zero when ﬂow is not turbulent and no special treatment is
needed near the wall or in laminar and transitional regions. In addition, DSM is able
to capture the anisotropy and the decrease of Cs near the free surface as seen in DNS
results.
In the present study, we use the dynamic procedure of Germano et al. (1991)
14

with a least-square approach suggested by Lilly (1992) to compute (Cs)2 based on
double ﬁltered velocities as
(Cs)2 = −

(2.26)
c represents the test scale ﬁlter with α = b∆/ ˜∆> 1. We use the box ﬁlter given in
Zang et al. (1993, Appendix A) with α = 2. As pointed out by Zang et al. (1993)
and others, the locally computed values from (2.25) have large ﬂuctuations and cause
numerical instability especially in the case of negative diﬀusivity. To cope with this
problem, averaging in a homogeneous direction (Germano et al. 1991, Vremen et al.
1997) or in a more general case, local averaging (Zang et al. 1993) should be applied.
We perform local averaging and set negative values to zero as in Vremen et al. (1997).
The eﬀect of SGS bubble-induced turbulence is added in the form of a bubble-
induced viscosity, νl
BI, (Lance & Bataille 1991, Fox 2012). We use the well known
model proposed by Sato & Sekoguchi (1975), given by
νl
BI = Cµ,BI
NG
X
k=1
αb
kdb
k|˜ur,k|,
(2.27)
where the model constant Cµ,BI is equal to 0.6 and ˜ur,k is the resolved relative velocity
between the kth bubble group and the liquid phase. Note that in regions of high void
fraction, (2.27) may underestimate the bubble-induced viscosity due to bubble-bubble
interactions, and then SGS pseudo-turbulent kinetic energy.
Using (2.4) and (2.23), the ˜σl
ij −ρlτ l
ij term in (2.14) can be written in the form
of eﬀective viscosity (Lakehal et al. 2002) as,
˜σl

(2.30)
To compute Db

νb = νl

(2.31)
where Scb is the Schmidt number for the bubble phase, taken equal to 0.7.
2.5
Free Surface Tracking
The VOF method with second-order piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC)
scheme (Rider & Kothe 1998) is employed to track the free surface location. A linear-
ity preserving, piecewise linear interface geometry approximation ensures that gener-
ated solutions retain second-order spatial accuracy. Second-order temporal accuracy is
achieved by virtue of a multidimensional unsplit time integration scheme. In the VOF
approach, an additional equation for ﬂuid volume fraction f is solved
∂f
∂t + ∇· (˜ulf) = 0,
(2.32)
where f is the volume fraction of the water within a computational cell. If f = 1, the
cell is inside the water, while f = 0, the cell is outside the water, otherwise, the cell
is at the air(or void)-water interface and f = 0.5 determines the position of the free
surface.
2.6
Boundary Conditions
We do not solve the Navier-Stokes equations in any cell where f = 0 and treat
it as a void with zero density. Instead, the pressure remains unchanged and all of
16

the velocity components are set to zero, which implies zero stress at the void-water
interface. At the top boundary, the pressure is deﬁned as zero and then the whole
void area has zero pressure. As in Watanabe et al. (2005) and Christensen (2006),
we ignore surface tension, which leads to homogeneous boundary conditions for shear
and pressure at the free surface. A no-slip condition is imposed along the solid side
walls and bottom. DSM gives zero turbulent viscosity near the wall and does not need
any special treatment such as a near-wall damping function. A sponge layer is used to
reduce wave reﬂection from the downstream boundary. At the inlet, the appropriate
inﬂow condition is imposed. For dispersive wave cases, the wave packet was composed
of 32 sinusoidal components of steepness aiki where the ai and ki are the amplitude and
wave number of the ith component. Based on linear superposition and by imposing
that the maximum η occurs at xb and tb, the total surface displacement at the inlet
can be obtained as (see RM)
η(0, t) =
N=32
X
i=1
ai cos[2πfi(t −tb) + kixb],
(2.33)
where fi is the frequency of the ith component. xb and tb are the predeﬁned location
and time of breaking, respectively. The discrete frequencies fi were uniformly spaced
over the band ∆f = fN −f1 with a central frequency deﬁned by fc = 1
2(fN −f1).
Diﬀerent global steepness, S = PN=32
i=1
aiki and ∆f/fc lead to spilling or plunging
breaking, where increasing S and/or decreasing ∆f/fc increases the breaking inten-
sity (See Drazen et al. (2008) for more details). Free surface and velocities of each
component are calculated using linear theory and then superimposed at x = 0.
2.7
Numerical Method
The 3D VOF unstructured ﬁnite volume code TRUCHAS (Rider & Kothe 1998)
was extended to incorporate the polydisperse bubble phase (Ma et al. 2011) and dif-
ferent turbulent closures. The details of numerical method is given in (Ma et al. 2011).
To summarize, the algorithm involves the following steps:
1. Material advection (the VOF model): The material interfaces are reconstructed
using PLIC and interface normals are determined. Movement of the material
17

between cells is based on combining the reconstructed geometry obtained from
the PLIC algorithm with the normal component of ﬂuid velocities located on the
faces of all mesh cells.
2. Solve bubble number density and update the volume fractions: we use the bubble
velocity at the previous time step to solve (2.15) and then update volume fractions
obtained from (2.11) and (2.12).
3. Velocity prediction: The intermediate predicted velocities are calculated with
updated volume fractions by a forward Euler step in time. This step incorporate
explicit approximation to the momentum advection, body force and pressure
gradient. These are updated in the correction step. Viscous forces are treated
implicitly and then are averaged between the previous time step and the predicted
step.
4. Pressure solution and velocity correction: The Poisson equation for pressure cor-
rection is solved using the preconditioned generalized minimal residual (GMRES)
algorithm to satisfy solenoidal condition.
5. bubble velocity calculation: Using (2.16), the bubble velocities are calculated
based on the updated ﬂuid velocities.
2.8
Reynolds Decomposition Of The Resolved Fields
The Reynolds decomposition of any ﬁeld variable, φ, can be written as φ =<
φ > +φ′, where < . > represents the ensemble averaged or organized ﬂow, and φ′ is
the turbulent ﬂuctuation about this average. Similarly, for the resolved ﬁeld variable,
˜φ = φ −φsgs, we can deﬁne ˜φ =< ˜φ > +˜φ′, then
φ′ = φ−< φ >= ˜φ + φsgs−< ˜φ + φsgs >= ˜φ′ + φsgs−< φsgs >,
(2.34)
where the SGS part is unresolved and its magnitude can only be estimated. Although
ensemble averaging is practical in experimental studies, it is tedious in the numerical
simulation due to the long computational times involved. The averaged variable in
the homogenous direction (here the y-direction) can be interpreted as an organized
motion, and the deviation from this average as the turbulent ﬂuctuation.
By this
assumption, ensemble averaging actually is approximated by the spanwise averaging
(Christensen & Deigaard 2001), and enough grid points in the spanwise direction are
18

needed to obtain a stable statistic. Christensen & Deigaard (2001),Christensen (2006)
and Lakehal & Liovic (2011) used averaging on about 40 grid points in the spanwise
direction to study turbulence under surfzone breaking waves, where lateral boundary
condition were periodic. We use no slip boundary condition for the side walls and,
because of wall eﬀects, we should not do the averaging through the entire grid. We
ignore 20 grid points near each wall, and then averaging is done on the remaining grid
points
< ˜φ(i, k) >≈¯˜φ(i, k) =
Ny−20
X
j=21
1
Ny −40
˜φ(i, j, k),
(2.35)
where Ny is the number of grid in the spanwise direction and ¯() represents the spanwise
averaging. Now, we can write
˜φ′ = ˜φ −¯˜φ
and
˜φr.m.s. = [˜φ′2]1/2,
(2.36)
where ˜φr.m.s. is the resolved r.m.s. of turbulent ﬂuctuations. In §4.2 we will show that
(2.35) gives good results compared to the ensemble averaged measurements of RM.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
We simulate all three cases in LM and two cases in RM, where the dispersive
focusing method was used to generate breaking. LM measured void fraction distri-
bution and integral properties of the bubble plume and RM measured free surface
evolution, ensemble averaged mean and turbulent velocities and estimated energy and
momentum balance in the breaking region. Table 3.1 summarizes the input param-
eters of the simulated test cases, where d is the quiescent water depth, and tob and
xob are the time and location at which the forward-moving jet hits the undisturbed
free surface, and are slightly diﬀerent from the linear theory prediction of tb and xb
deﬁned in (2.33). The other parameters have been deﬁned in §2.6. Besides the cor-
responding experiment in table 3.1, we also consider the void fraction measurements
of Rojas & Loewen (2010) and high resolution post breaking turbulence and velocity
measurements by DM. The experimental set-ups in these two works are similar to the
simulated cases, as summarized in table 3.2.
Unless otherwise indicated, the references for time, x and z directions are tob,
xob and still water level, respectively. This is consistent with the corresponding mea-
surements and makes comparison easier. The normalized time, locations, velocities
and vorticities then can be written as

where Tc, Lc and Cc are the period, wavelength and phase speed of the center frequency
wave of the input packet, respectively.

Grid Size Selection For 3D Simulations
In any LES, the goal is to model the small, dissipative scales of motion appro-
priately while avoiding extensive numerical computations that are needed for a DNS
simulation. In turbulent bubbly ﬂow, we also need to accurately model SGS eﬀects in-
duced by dispersed bubbles and interphase momentum exchanges. On the other hand,
we must have suﬃcient mesh resolution to ensure that all relevant large scales of ﬂow
structures are captured.
3.1.1
Free surface evolution
In the ﬁrst step, the grid size dependence study consists of comparison of the free
surface evolution during the overturning process and splash-up, which can be performed
using 2D simulations. Grid convergence analysis for an unsteady air/water interface in
a turbulent bubbly ﬂow is very diﬃcult. Although much smaller 3D interface structures
(Lubin & Glockner 2013) can be resolved with higher mesh resolutions, the overall large
21

scale dynamics of wave breaking are not aﬀected by the small interface structures.
The reﬁnement of grid spacing from ∆x = 50mm, ∆z = 16mm to ∆x =
15mm, ∆z = 4.6mm (decreasing with a factor of ∼1.5) is used for the most energetic
plunger case, P1. Figure 3.1(a) shows that the jet tip becomes thinner and sharper
as grid size decreases, and more details of the interface structure can be captured in
the splash-up. The overall structure of the interface obtained with mesh resolutions
∆x = 22.7mm, ∆z = 7mm and ∆x = 15mm, ∆z = 4.6mm are similar. Figure 3.1(b)
shows that both predict the surface elevation reasonably in comparison to the mea-
surement especially during the overturning and ﬁrst splash cycle (t∗< 0.4), where the
process is less three dimensional. Although the initial cavity and splash-up can not
be captured properly at the mesh resolution ∆x = 33.3mm, ∆z = 10.5mm, the free
surface still has a comparable shape, and the increase of wave height in the splash
cycle is captured. At further decrease of mesh resolution to ∆x = 50mm, ∆z = 16mm,
the overall shape of the interface can not be resolved and free surface location drops
considerably compare to the measurement. We may conclude that the ﬁrst coarse mesh
resolution is not adequate for LES and the appropriate resolution to capture the large
scale interface structures would be between the second and third mesh resolution.
3.1.2
Resolved turbulent ﬂuctuations
In the second step, we want to make sure that the mesh resolution is ﬁne enough
to resolve the main part of turbulent motions besides the large scale organized ﬂow
structures. In a successful LES with suﬃciently ﬁne resolution, at least 80% of the
TKE should be resolved (Pope 2000). This criteria can be evaluated easily for each 3D
simulation using (3.2) and (3.3). At high Reynolds number, with the ﬁlter width ( ˜∆)
in the inertial subrange, the ﬁltered velocity ﬁeld accounts for nearly all of the kinetic
energy, < E >≈< ˜E >≈˜E, and based on the mesh resolution some part of the TKE
can be resolved. From (2.34), we can write

2/π = 0.094 with the Kolmogorov spectrum constant, C = 1.5. As
we decrease the grid size (ﬁlter width) ksgs decreases and ˜k approaches to k.
We consider three 3D simulations for P1 with diﬀerent mesh resolutions includ-
ing ∆x = 23.1mm, ∆y = 7mm, ∆z = 7mm, ∆x = 34mm, ∆y = 10.5mm, ∆z = 10.5mm
and ∆x = 50mm, ∆y = 16mm, ∆z = 16mm. The total spanwise averaged resolved
TKE, ˇ˜k, and the estimated total spanwise averaged SGS TKE, ˇ¯ksgs, in the breaking

to the estimated total spanwise averaged TKE, ˇ˜k + ˇ¯ksgs, is always more than 80% for
the ﬁnest mesh resolution. Normalized ˇ¯ksgs is shown in ﬁgure 3.2(b) and decreases as
mesh size decreases. Based on ﬁgure 3.2, we can conclude that the coarse resolution
of ∆x = 50mm, ∆y = 16mm, ∆z = 16mm can only capture a small portion of the
turbulent energy at the main dissipative period of breaking, t∗= 0 ∼0.5 (see §4.8)
and the grid size between the two ﬁnest resolutions can reasonably capture a suﬃciently
large part of the turbulent ﬂuctuations.

Model Set-Up
Based on the 2D and 3D grid dependence studies for P1 in the previous section,
the mesh resolution of (∆x, ∆y, ∆z) = (23.1, 7.0, 7.0)mm seems to capture the free
surface evolution very well, and the estimate of ˇ˜k/ˇk shows that more than 80 percent of
total TKE in the breaking region is resolved. This procedure was repeated for the other
cases and showed that this resolution is appropriate for the other smaller breakers. We
thus choose this mesh resolution for the 3D simulations, as summarized in the table
3.3.
Bubbles are divided into NG = 20 groups with a logarithmic distribution of
bubble sizes (similar to Ma et al. (2011)) where the maximum and minimum bubble
diameters are taken as 8mm ( ˜∆/dB > 1.3) and 0.2mm (consistent with the observation
by Deane & Stokes (2002)), respectively. We used the same model parameters for
all of the simulations, as summarized in table 3.4. All the 3D simulations are then
repeated without the inclusion of dispersed bubble phase to examine the eﬀects of
dispersed bubbles on the organized and turbulent motions and energy dissipation. For
simplicity, hereafter we drop ˜() for all of the resolved variables.

3D free surface evolution and entrainment mechanisms
In a plunging breaker, the ﬁnger-shape falling jet hits the forward face of the
wave and both backward and forward splashes are formed. Based on the initial breaker
intensity, the splash generation can be continued several times, and ﬁnally a bore-like
region is formed and propagates downstream. In a spilling breaker, the jet and splashes
are weak, and a bore-like front propagation is the main dominant feature. We can
deﬁne three main entrainment mechanisms in a plunging breaker: cavity entrapment,
jet/splash impacts and entrainment in the bore-like region, where, in a spilling breaker,
the last one is the most important one. The entrained cavity will be fragmented into
some large air pockets which may outgas very quickly or be further fragmented by
turbulence into diﬀerent bubble sizes down to the Hinze scale. Note that, under a 3D
breaker, the air can escape laterally, leading to smaller cavity entrainment. To directly
capture the details of these entrainment mechanisms we need to have very small spatial
and temporal resolution that is intractable in 3D simulation of large laboratory scale
events.
Figure 4.1 shows snapshots of the free surface evolution for the large plunging
breaker, P1. It is clear that the model captures the overturning jet impact, splash-
up process and formation of a bore-like region. It can be seen that some void pockets
captured by the VOF model at the ﬁrst and second jet impacts seem to be fragmented to
some extend and outgas because of buoyancy force. As we have explained in Appendix
A, if we have enough spatial resolution the volume of these void pockets initially are
27

comparable to the volume of air entrapped by the overturning jet, but their evolution
to smaller void pockets can be considered only as a crude approximation of actual air
cavity break-up process. In §4.1.3 we discuss more about these super-grid void pockets
versus subgrid dispersed bubbles fed into the water column by the entrainment model.
The ﬁnger shape structures (Saruwatari et al. 2009) can be seen in the forward splash
(t∗= 0.05 ∼0.3). In addition, comparing to LM ﬁgure 2a, the time and location
(t∗= 0.25, x∗= 0.5) at which the forward splash hits the undisturbed free surface
is very accurately captured by the model. When the jet hits the forward face of the
wave, backward and forward splashes are generated and reach an elevation higher than
the primary wave height. Local rise and depression of the surface (scars) is one of the
typical features behind the progressive bore and can be seen in ﬁgure 4.1 for t∗> 0.9,
where the front bore is formed and propagates downstream (x∗> 0.9).
While large bubbles outgas very quickly, small bubbles are preferentially en-
trained into the coherent vortices generated during breaking and transported verti-
cally by turbulent motions, and may remain in the water column for a very long time.
Bubbles entrained by a plunging breaker can be divided into three diﬀerent clouds.
Figure 4.2 shows the 3D bubble plume evolution for P1, in which the two semicircular
clouds are related to the two downbursts of turbulent motion under the ﬁrst impacting
jet and forward splash, and the third cloud represents bubbles entrained by the bore
which are transported by vortices behind the bore. Figure 4.3 shows the results for the
spilling/weakly plunging breaker, SP1. Because of the weak plunging and turbulent
downburst, the third cloud is the dominant one and the 3D structures behind the pro-
gressive bore are more pronounced. The accumulation of bubbles near the side walls
(especially during the outgassing phase) are consistent with the observation of LM.
The detailed study of the large scale coherent vortices and their interactions with the
entrained bubbles are left to a subsequent paper. Here we just want to emphasize that
the entrainment processes are three-dimensional and bubble plume evolution is related
to the large vortical structures.

4.1.2
Void fraction distributions
Figure 4.4 shows snapshots of the spatial distribution of the spanwise averaged
void fraction for P1. During cavity formation (t∗= −0.15 ∼0) the model predicts void
fraction up to 10% at the jet toe, consistent with the measurement of Blenkinsopp &
Chaplin (2007, ﬁgure 4, a - c ) . The cavity entrapped by the jet entrains a considerable
void volume during t∗= 0.0 ∼0.25, which is related to the region inside the black solid
line, showing the spanwise averaged free surface location ( ¯f = 0.5). The backward
splash is formed between t∗= 0.2 and t∗= 0.35 and entrains some void volume.
During t∗= 0.25 ∼0.5 the entrained cavity collapses and big void pockets outgas very
quickly. Note that a cell with only void material, f = 0, can collapse in a nonphysical
manner. Although the break-up process can not be captured because of our spatial
resolution as well as replacing actual air by void, the integrated rise velocity of the
cavity can be captured reasonably well (see appendix A).
The primary semicircular bubble cloud initially advances approximately with
the phase speed, but after t∗= 0.5 its horizontal centroid becomes constant (∼x∗=
32

0.4) and then moves backward slowly after t∗= 1.1. The secondary bubble cloud is
generated by the impact of the forward splash during t∗= 0.25 to t∗= 0.65, where
at t∗= 0.65 we have the maximum entrainment by a jet-like impact similar to the
primary jet. The spanwise averaged void fraction of the dispersed bubbles near the
surface becomes more than 30% at t∗= 0.65 and then decreases gradually to ∼1%
at t∗= 1.7. Similar behavior was reported by Rojas & Loewen (2010) with slightly
diﬀerent wave packet conditions; see table 3.2. They observed the initial impact of the
forward splash at t∗∼0.32 and maximum void fraction in the secondary bubble cloud
at t∗∼0.61 in their plunging breaking case.
Figure 4.5 shows the results for SP1. There is a weak primary bubble cloud,
and a very small cavity is captured by the VOF model. Instead of a forward splash,
the bore front is formed at t∗= 0.45 and air entrainment at the leading edge of the
bore front becomes the dominant entrainment mechanism. The bubble plume advances
with the front bore region and the maximum spanwise averaged void fraction is about
25% near the leading edge. A similar pattern can be seen in P1 for t∗> 1.0, x∗> 1.0.
To quantify the distribution of the cavities captured by the VOF model versus
the entrained dispersed bubbles, time averaged vertically integrated spanwise averaged
volume of the dispersed bubbles, V b, and the cavities, V c, are calculated as

Because of the strong splashes in P1, a large secondary bubble
cloud forms and leads to the peak in V b between 0.5 < x∗< 1.0. In all of the breakers,
when the bore front formed, uniform V b is predicted for about 0.5Lc and then gradually
decreases as the bore propagates further downstream and becomes less turbulent (ﬁgure

4.1.3
Integral properties of the bubble plume
This section discusses some integral properties of the bubble plume. LM used
0.3% void fraction as a threshold to evaluate the integral properties of the bubble
plume, using a conductivity probe on a 50 × 50 mm grid. The measurements started
a quarter of a period after breaking, and because of surface eﬀects, they were based
on measurements at depths below 2.5cm. The signals are ensemble averaged and then
time averaged over 0.05s intervals. They did not consider any upper limit for void
fraction, which means initially the entrained cavities may lead to ensemble averaged
void fractions more that 50%. The total volume of the entrained dispersed bubbles,
V b, per unit length of crest are computed from
V b =
Z
A
¯αb H(¯αb −αthld) dA,
(4.2)
where αthld = 0.3% is a threshold value and H is the Heaviside step function. The
total cross sectional area of the dispersed bubble plume, Ab, are calculated as
Ab =
Z
A
H(¯αb −αthld) dA.
(4.3)
34

The averaged volume fraction of the dispersed bubbles, αb
ave are deﬁned as
αb
ave = V b
Ab .
(4.4)
Finally, the horizontal and vertical centroids of the bubble plume, ¯xb, ¯zb, are calculated
using
(¯xb, ¯zb) =
R
A ¯αbH(¯αb −αthld)(x, z) dA
Ab
.
(4.5)
As explained by LM, the total volume of the bubble plume and the centroid positions
reach their asymptotic values for the threshold values equal to 0.3% or less. However,
the cross-sectional area and the averaged volume fraction do not reach their respec-
tive asymptotic values. The regions with void fraction close to the threshold value
contribute signiﬁcantly to the cross-sectional area of the bubble plume, but do not
contribute much to the total volume of air.
Thus, the total volume of the bubble
plume predicted by the model can be expected to have more correlation with the mea-
surement, in comparison to the plume area or averaged volume fraction. On the other
hand, predicted cross-sectional area and averaged volume fraction should have a similar
pattern, while the absolute values may be diﬀerent.
Figures 4.7 and 4.8 show the time-dependent averaged volume fraction and
normalized volume and cross-sectional area of the bubble plume for P1 and SP1, re-
spectively. V0 is the total volume of air per unit length of crest enclosed by the forward
jet as it impacts the free surface, as seen from video images taken from the side wall
of the experimental channel for P1, and is the maximum of the measured volume of
the entrained air for SP1. Using the measured V0 (0.0098 and 0.0025 m3/m for P1 and
SP1, respectively) makes it possible to compare the absolute values between the model
and measurement. During t∗= 0 ∼0.5, the total volume of the entrained dispersed
bubbles (solid line in ﬁgures 4.7(a) and 4.8(a)) accounts for less than 10% in P1 to
about 40% for SP1. The reason is that the entrainment model correlates the volume of

the entrained bubbles (see (2.21)) with shear induced SGS production rate, εsgs,SI, near
the free surface, and thus, can not capture the entrainment due to the cavity entrapped
by the overturning jet, which is not a turbulence dependent mechanism but relates to
the geometry of the breaker. Figure 4.6(a) shows that the total volume based on both
the dispersed bubbles fed in by the entrainment model and the cavities captured by
the VOF model (dash line in ﬁgures 4.7(a)) compare well to the measurements for
P1. For both cases, the entrainment model predicts the correct volume of entrained
bubbles after t∗= 0.6, when the turbulence and leading edge entrainment mechanisms
in the splash-up and bore-like region become dominant, while the air pockets and/or
bigger bubbles outgas very quickly because of the larger rise velocity and smaller ini-
tial penetration depth. As expected, the results for SP1 is more comparable to the
measurement during t∗= 0 ∼0.5, which is because of the smaller cavity entrapment.
The plume area and averaged volume fraction are also predicted reasonably well.
Similar to the plume volume if we consider the cavities, the averaged volume fraction
becomes comparable with the measurement during t∗= 0 ∼0.5 in P1. The general
trend of plume area evolution is also consistent with the measurement of Callaghan
et al. (2013, ﬁgures 4 and 5).
Figure 4.9(a) shows that the entrained bubbles are initially transported at the
characteristic phase speed, Cc, in both breakers. In P1, because of the wave-induced
strong downburst type large vortices which do not propagate downstream, the primary
and secondary bubble clouds have nearly ﬁxed positions after t∗= 0.75, and as a result
¯xb becomes nearly constant. In P1, the vertical centroid position of the plume (ﬁgure
4.9(b)) clearly shows a peak at the second jet/splash impact which is correspond to the
secondary bubble clouds. Then, it becomes nearly constant at later times. As observed
by the experiments, there is also a peak ¯zb during the ﬁrst jet impact which can not
be captured by the entrainment model. In SP1 ¯zb gradually decreases, and because
of no signiﬁcant downburst, which is the case for the small breakers and spilling type
whitecaps, the bubble plume is more concentrated near the free surface.

4.2
Nonlinear Interaction Of Wave Packet Components
The input packet consists of short waves followed by long waves. As they prop-
agate towards the predeﬁned focal point, the packet becomes steeper, and the surface
evolves toward breaking. Figure 4.10 shows the spanwise averaged free surface, ¯η, near
the break point for P3. The considerable drop in peak ¯η results from plunging break-
ing occurring at x∗= 0. Compared to the measurements, the model captures the time
dependent free surface location before and after the break point fairly well. To study
frequency evolution as the packet approaches the focal point and understand which
frequencies in the packet lose energy during breaking, RM measured the power spec-
trum based on a single measurement of the free surface at diﬀerent locations. They
showed that near the wave maker the wave packet is similar to its theoretical ’top hat’
shape, and as it evolves to the focal point, loses its ’top hat’ shape, with energy spread
to higher frequencies. They observed that breaking occurred between kc(x −xb) = −5
and 0 where kc = 2πL−1
c , and that the loss in the high frequency end of the ﬁrst har-
monic band and in the second harmonic band was considerable. Figure 4.11 shows the
power density spectra of the wave packet for the incipient breaking case (S = 0.257),
and P3 based on the FFT of the spanwise averaged free surface time series which are
smoothed using 5-point band averaging. The dashed line corresponds to the spectra
at kc(x −xb) = −15 for each column. The deviation from the upstream spectra clearly
shows the above mentioned processes, which were previously observed in RM ﬁgure

We next use the continuous wavelet transform to determine the spatio-temporal
structure and relative phasing of frequency components in the single breaking wave.
The continuous wavelet transform W¯η of a discrete sequence of the spanwise averaged
free surface time series at certain location, ¯η(t), is deﬁned as the convolution of ¯η(t)
with a scaled and translated version of a mother wavelet,
W¯η(s, t) = 1
√s
Z ∞
−∞
¯η(τ)φ⋆(τ −t
s
)dτ
(4.6)
where t is time, s is the scale factor, τ is the translation factor, √s is for energy
normalization across diﬀerent scales, and ⋆denotes the complex conjugate. The wavelet
kernel adopted here is the Morlet wavelet and is expressed as
φ(t) = eiω0te−t2
2
(4.7)
where ω0 is the non-dimensional central frequency of the analyzing wavelet.
The
wavelet transform is computed in Fourier space to obtain an arbitrary number and
distribution of scales.
The modulus of the wavelet transform of a linear packet, incipient breaking and
P3 are shown in Figure 4.12. In the linear case, the results follow the linear theory
prediction in which all the frequencies in the packet arrive at the predeﬁned focal point,
xb, at the predeﬁned time, tb (Note that in the ﬁgure the numbers on top left corner
are values of kc(x −xb)). In addition, energy at each frequency component propagates
with its corresponding group velocity before and after the focal point, which leads to
symmetry of the results about kc(x −xb) = 0. In the incipient breaking case and P3,
as the packet approaches the focal point, nonlinear eﬀects lead to faster propagation of
the energy, generating a permanent lead in arrival time relative to the linear prediction.
Although this lead in arrival time exists in both nonlinear cases, in P3 there is a phase
locking after breaking and nearly all of the frequencies propagate together between
41

0 < kc(x −xb) < 10.
Strictly speaking, phase coupling occurs if two frequencies,
say f1, f2, are simultaneously present in the signal along with their sum frequency,
f3 = f1 + f2, with Θ3 = Θ1 + Θ2 + const where Θi is a corresponding phase of fi.
This phase coupling process after breaking is further demonstrated by looking at the

frequency of the wave packet. The bispectrum is deﬁned as

corresponding to addition of frequencies. This analysis tool was ﬁrst introduced by
Van Milligen et al. (1995) in a integrated form with respect to time,
R
T B¯η(s1, s2, τ) dτ,
which was shown to measure the amount of phase coupling in the interval T between
wavelet components of scale lengths s1, s2 and s3 or equivalently of frequencies f1, f2
and f3. Here we set s1 = s2, then s3 = s1/2 or f1 = f2 = f3/2. s1 is the corresponding
scale for a frequency near peak frequency of the signal. Note that the bispectrum
is a complex number, and its phase represents ΘB¯η = Θ1 + Θ2 −Θ3.
In general,
ΘB¯η changes continuously between −π to π. In the case of phase locking, however, it
becomes constant or nearly so. Figure 4.13 shows ΘB¯η corresponding to two frequencies
near the peak frequency for the diﬀerent packets. In P3, phase coupling starts near the
break point and lasts for more than two periods. It is still considerable about 1.5Lc
downstream of the breaking point (kc(x −xb) = 10) which is consistent with ﬁgure
4.12. In the linear and incipient breaking cases, on the other hand, there is not such a
strong phase coupling and ΘB¯η continuously changes between −π to π.

Spanwise Averaged Velocity And Vorticity
To study organized ﬂow, which is approximated by the spanwise averaged ﬂow
ﬁeld, evolution during and after breaking, P3 simulation is set to run for about 22
42

periods after breaking. The signals have 44.1s length with 100Hz sampling rate. Span-
wise averaged velocity and vorticity are calculated using (2.35). DM measured the
velocity ﬁeld at multiple cross sections of the tank and found that the organized ﬂow
is two-dimensional to a good approximation. The numerical results also show that the
organized ﬂow is two-dimensional, with ¯v an order of magnitude smaller than the span-
wise averaged velocities in the other two directions. The spanwise averaged velocity
ﬁeld can be decomposed into
u = uw + ufw + uc,
(4.10)
where uw is the orbital velocities of the surface waves, ufw is the velocities of the long
forced waves induced by breaking and uc is the current stemming from the momentum
loss during the breaking and/or stokes drift. The mean current can be calculated by
time averaging of the spanwise averaged velocity signal,
uc = u =

u dt∗,
(4.11)
where t∗

point, when the point is above the free surface the velocity signal is zero.
Figure
4.14 shows the spatial distribution of the normalized mean current and its horizontal
averaged between x∗= 0.25 and 1.25, as well as the normalized horizontal averaged
mass ﬂux below the depth z∗, d

cdz∗where z∗
1 = −0.31, for P3. The
current induced by breaking is noticeable in 0.25 < x∗< 1.25. The positive current
penetrates more than a wave height with the magnitude on the order of 0.02Cc, up
to 0.04Cc if we perform time averaging in a shorter time span, near the still water
depth. As shown by ﬁgure 4.14(c) a nearly constant return current at the lower depths
compensates the positive current below the still water depth (d
M ∗(z∗= 0) ≈0). The
mean current before and after breaking region is consistent with the eﬀects of stokes
drift in the dominant wave packet, reduced by the longer averaging time.

To examine the time dependent distribution of the kinetic energy of the orga-
nized ﬂow through diﬀerent frequencies corresponding to uw and ufw, wavelet analysis
is performed. The modulus of the wavelet transform of the normalized spanwise aver-
aged horizontal velocity signal after subtracting its mean, u∗−u∗
c, is shown in ﬁgure
4.15. The frequency band of the input packet, 0.635 < f/fc < 1.365, is shown by the
dotted lines. As we can see the main part of the energy is carried by the surface waves
and distributed across this band. After t∗∼4, when the packet passes the breaking
region, the energy in this band decreases to a negligible amount at t∗∼8, while the en-
ergy in the low frequency long forced waves remain noticeable and similar at the lower
depths. To remove the repeatable surface wave velocities from u∗−u∗
c time series, we
perform low-pass ﬁltering with a cut-oﬀfrequency fcut/fc = 0.34 (dashed line in ﬁgure
4.15) using the overlap-add method as in RM. The vorticity of the spanwise averaged
ﬂow is calculated based on the raw spanwise averaged signals. Figure 4.16 shows snap-
shots of spatial distribution of the low-pass ﬁlter spanwise averaged velocity ﬁeld and
vorticity of the organized ﬂow, ωy. It clearly shows the formation of the forced long
waves in the breaking region and the large coherent vortices which propagate slowly
downstream and deepen. The dominant positive ωy indicates the clockwise rotation of
the vortices. At t∗= 15 the large vortex between 0.25 < x∗< 1.25 is very clear, while

the velocities before and after it are nearly zero. The strong ﬂow near the surface with
the nearly constant return ﬂow at lower depths form the large coherent vortex, while
multiple smaller vortices can be recognized at the beginning and the end of the large
coherent vortex. As time proceeds, the small vortices grow, detach from the surface
and propagate very slowly downstream. Based on ﬁgure 4.16, their averaged horizontal
and vertical speed can be estimated as ≈0.01Cc and 0.001 ∼0.003Cc, respectively.
The large coherent breaking-induced vortex is also observed by RM and DM.

tions in the breaking region. They performed ﬁltering both on the ensemble averaged

(based on the 10 repeats of the packet) and r.m.s. velocity in the same manner. For
r.m.s velocity the ﬁltering was ﬁrst performed on the variance of the turbulent velocity
and then square root was taken. Figure 4.17 shows the model results vs measurements
for P3 at x∗= 0.15 and x∗= 0.60 from very close to the free surface to z∗= −0.151
(≈z = −d/2). Although we do not expect exact correlations for a point-wise compari-
son in the breaking region especially in this non stationary event, the results show that
the model captures the spatial and temporal evolution of the organized and turbulent
velocity in the breaking region reasonably well. At x∗= 0.15 the slow variation of the
r.m.s and spanwise averaged signals clearly shows the passage of the TKE cloud and
the coherent vortices induced by the breaking. Further downstream at x∗= 0.60, the
r.m.s. turbulent velocity initially has the same increase as the TKE cloud arrives, but
it only decreases to 0.01Cc at t∗= 20. Based on the experiments it remains about
0.005Cc even up to t∗= 60. In addition, we can conclude that the spanwise averaging
from (2.35) and (2.36) are a good approximation for the ensemble averaging in this
problem.
4.4
Turbulent Velocity And Vorticity
The r.m.s. of turbulent ﬂuctuations is calculated using (2.36). Figure 4.18 shows
the time dependent spatial distribution of the r.m.s turbulent velocities and vorticities
in the breaking region for P1. During the active breaking period, 0 < t∗< 1, the
turbulent motions have very high intensity and are concentrated near the free surface.
As time proceeds, they become more uniform and are mixed down more than two
wave heights. At the initial stage of breaking, turbulent ﬂuctuations in the streamwise
direction, urms, are much bigger than in the other two directions, with a maximum
of 0.3Cc, and in most of the region wrms ≈vrms. During the ﬁrst jet impact and
splash cycles the r.m.s.
of turbulent vorticity in the spanwise direction, ωy,rms, is
bigger than other two components, especially in the forward face of the wave. At the
backside, instead, ωy,rms < ωx,rms ≈ωz,rms. If we refer to the ﬂow ﬁeld at t∗≥4 as a
background level, ﬁgure 4.18 shows that the r.m.s of turbulent velocity and vorticity at
47

the background level initially are an order of magnitude smaller than that during active
breaking. In addition, both the velocity and vorticity ﬁeld become more isotropic, and
the turbulent cloud is well mixed in the three directions.
Existence of a highly anisotropic surface layer is one of the characteristic fea-
tures of free-surface turbulence, regardless of ﬂow type (Shen & Yue 2001, Lin et al.
2008). In the absence of surface waves, the shear stresses vanish near the free surface
and vertical component of the turbulent velocity decreases considerably as the free sur-
face is approached. This creates a thin surface layer where the velocity derivatives are
highly anisotropic. The blockage eﬀects of the surface causes anisotropy of the velocity
components themselves over a thicker region (Shen & Yue 2001). Under surface waves,
on the other hand, the orbital motions strongly enhance the turbulent ﬂuctuations, es-
pecially the vertical component (Lin et al. 2008, ﬁgure 16). To examine the turbulence
structure in the vertical direction, we performed time dependent horizontal averaging
on lines parallel to the instantaneous spanwise averaged free-surface locations. Be-
cause the process is non-stationary and non-homogeneous, especially during the active
breaking period, this averaging method only gives a general trend of vertical variation
of the turbulence structure. Figures 4.19 and 4.20 show the horizontally averaged, b(),
turbulent velocity and vorticity variance for P1 and SP1, respectively. At t∗= 0.5
where surface waves are strong, c
u′2 ≫c
v′2 ≈c
w′2. As time proceeds and surface waves
pass the breaking region, c
w′2 starts to decrease near the free surface and c
w′2 is much
smaller than c
v′2, while at the lower depths, c
w′2 becomes on the order of or larger than
c
v′2. Vertical variation of the vorticity components generally have a larger gradient. In
a very thin layer near the free surface, c
ω′2
y is bigger than the other two components dur-
ing the active breaking. In P1, the anisotropy reduces as time proceeds, and horizontal
averaged turbulent vorticity variance in the streamwise direction, c
ω′2
x , becomes com-
parable and even larger than the other two components. In SP1, on the other hands,
the surface layer is more anisotropic than the plunging case with the anisotropy both
in the turbulent velocity and vorticity ﬁeld remains noticeable after active breaking.

y is the dominant component, which means that
the event is mainly 2D. It decreases fairly rapidly while the streamwise and vertical

After the active breaking period, all three components become
comparable.
At later times t∗≫1, the streamwise component ratio continuously
increase and the other two components remain at the same order.

TKE And Enstrophy
Figures 4.23 and 4.24 show the normalized spanwise averaged TKE and enstro-
phy for P1, SP1 and P3, respectively. The spatial distribution and time evolution of
both quantities are very similar. TKE cloud evolution in P3 is very comparable to
the measured turbulent intensities by RM. In addition, TKE cloud boundary is con-
sistent with the digitized dye trace shown in RM ﬁgure 47 which indicates model can
fairly well capture the transition between non-turbulent and high turbulent regions.
The background level of TKE and enstrophy intensities initially, t∗≈4, are two order
of magnitude smaller than that during the active breaking period. As expected, in
the background ﬂow, e.g. between 4.0 < t∗< 22.0 in P3, the decay rate of TKE and
enstrophy becomes much smaller.
The penetration of the TKE and enstrophy seem to be well correlated with
the wave height for both plunging and spilling breakers. For all breakers, the mixed
layer depth is approximately 0.5H for the spilling and 0.75H for the plunging breakers
during the active breaking period, where H is the wave height before breaking. It
becomes about twice deeper at t∗= 4.0, with 1H for the spilling and 1.5H for the
plunging breakers. In P1, the mixed layer depth further increases to about 2.5H at
t∗= 11.0. At later times, the averaged layer depth remains nearly constant with only
local obliquely deepening. This is consistent with the measurement of RM and DM

in which the TKE cloud thickness became nearly constant from t∗∼10 up to t∗∼50.
Figures 4.24 and 4.4 demonstrate that the regions with high enstrophy are very
well correlated to the high void fraction regions of the bubble plume. This is because of
the transport of dispersed bubbles by the vortex structures. In P1, because of a strong
jet impact, there is a clear downburst of turbulence and vorticity in 0.25 < x∗< 0.5,
which leads to formation of a separate turbulent region transported deeper than the
other regions. The following splash cycle also generates a weaker downburst. These
two downburst type vortices are responsible for forming two semicircular bubble clouds,
observed also by Rojas & Loewen (2010). In P3, the jet-impact is weaker and the
resulting turbulent cloud is more uniform in the streamwise direction with the obliquely
descending extension of enstrophy and TKE.

Figure 4.25 shows the time evolution of total TKE and enstrophy in the break-
ing region for the diﬀerent breakers. The integrated TKE of the corresponding case
in RM is shown in ﬁgure 4.25a. RM estimated the ensemble averaged volume inte-
grated squared turbulent components, u′2, w′2, based on a pointwise measurements in
a relatively coarse grid. After t∗= 4, the model results are fairly consistent with the
measurements at which TKE cloud is well mixed, and integration based on a coarse
grid which is used in the measurement, would be a good approximation. Figures 4.25b
and 4.25c show the time evolution of the total TKE, ˇk, and total enstrophy, ˇ¯Ω, in the
breaking region for the other cases. The decay rate of both ˇk and ˇ¯Ωincrease with
increasing breaking intensity. After active breaking, ˇk decays in the form of (t∗)−n
in which n varies from 0.5 to 1.0 for spilling to plunging breaking. ˇ¯Ωhas a similar
decay form with larger n varies from 1.0 to 1.5 for spilling to plunging breaking. RM
and DM also found (t∗)−n dependence with n ≈1.0, for total TKE in the breaking

region based on the 2D measurements of the streamwise and vertical turbulent velocity
components.
In 2D numerical simulations and most of the experimental measurements, the
out of plane velocity component, v, is missing. To account for this missing component
in TKE calculation, Svendsen (1987) argued there are similar characteristics between
the turbulent components under quasi-periodic surf zone breaking waves and plane
wakes. He estimated ensemble averaged three-dimensional TKE, ¯k = 1
2u′2

¯k ≈¯k1 = 1.33

10%. Both estimates give reasonable results for t∗> 1.
4.6
Reynolds Stress
The Reynolds stresses transfer momentum from the organized surface wave ﬁeld
into the bulk of the ﬂuid.
Figure 4.27 shows u′w′ for P1 and SP1.
u′w′ is domi-
nantly negative, consistent with the mechanism through which currents are generated
by breaking due to the vertical ﬂux of the positive horizontal momentum lost from the
surface waves.
4.7
Energy Dissipation
Energy dissipation is one of the least understood components of the near-surface
dynamics of the ocean. The breaking induced dissipation rate is much greater than the
56

other sources of dissipation especially during active breaking. In addition, breaking
waves are highly intermittent both in time and space. Thus, the mixing and energy
dissipation at the near-surface layer are highly intermittent and dominant by the indi-
vidual breaking events, with the background levels of turbulence and dissipation rate
being considerably lower Melville (1994).
Based on scaling arguments, Duncan (1981, 1983) showed that the wave dissi-
pation per unit length of breaking crest can be written in the form of
ˇϵtotal = bρg−1c5,
(4.15)
where g is the gravitational acceleration, c is the phase speed of the wave and b is a
breaking parameter. Phillips (1985) deﬁned a distribution Λ(c) so that Λ(c)dc repre-
sents the average total length of breaking fronts per unit surface area traveling with
velocities in the range (c, c + dc). He then formulated the average rate of energy loss
for breaking waves with speeds in the range (c, c + dc) per unit surface area as
ˇϵtotal(c)dc = bρg−1c5Λ(c)dc.
(4.16)
This concept is very interesting especially for the large scale models with relatively large
time scales, e.g. wind-wave models in which a whole breaking event is SGS and needs
to be parameterized based on the spectral characteristics. However, as summarized by
Drazen et al. (2008), the available literature shows a large scatter for b. In addition,
so far only a few published Λ(c) distributions exist, and it may need to be calibrated
based on the speciﬁc area of the interest.
In this section, we ﬁrst examine the bubble- and shear induced dissipation and
their contribution to the total dissipation under a breaking event - note that the former,
is commonly ignored in 3D LES simulations of breaking waves. Then, we discuss time
dependent behavior of the breaking parameter, b.
In addition, the time averaged
dissipation rate per unit length of breaking crest is obtained.

Figure 4.28: Snapshots of the spanwise averaged SGS dissipation rate, εsgs [m2s−3]
for P1, from the simulation (left) with and (right) without the inclusion
of the dispersed bubbles.
4.7.1
Shear- and bubble-induced dissipation
Dissipation rate of the resolved kinetic energy per unit mass is
εtotal = εr + εsgs
(4.17)
where εr = 2νSijSij = ν|S|2 is viscous dissipation rate directly from the resolved
velocity ﬁeld and εsgs represents the rate of transfer of energy from the resolved motions
to the SGS motions.
In the present study, εsgs = −τ d
ijSij = εSI + εBI consists of
two diﬀerent dissipation mechanisms. εSI = νSI|S|2 is a conventional shear-induced
dissipation rate similar to a single phase turbulence.
The additional term, εBI =
νBI|S|2, accounts for turbulent SGS motions generated by the dispersed bubbles and
enhances the dissipation rate. At high Reynolds number, with the ﬁlter width much
larger than the Kolmogorov length scale (typical in LES), εr is usually negligibly small,
and if the model resolves most of TKE, we can approximate the total dissipation rate,
ε, by εsgs. This is equivalent to assuming, there is a close balance between production
and dissipation in the averaged kinetic energy of SGS motions (Pope 2000).
58

Figure 4.28 shows snapshots of the spatial distribution of εsgs for P1 with and
without the inclusion of dispersed bubble phase.
The regions with a high dissipa-
tion rate are collocated with the high vorticity and TKE regions. εsgs is very large,
O(1m2s−3), at the jet/splash impact and the bore front regions. The corresponding
Hinze scale of bubble diameter then can be estimated as aH ∼= c(γ
ρ)3/5ε−2/5 ≈1mm,
where c = 0.36 ∼0.5 and γ
ρ = 7.3 × 10−5 (see Garrett et al. 2000). This is consistent
with our choice of aH = 1mm, for the bubble size distribution. The local values of dis-
sipation rate decrease very quickly. At the end of active breaking, they become at least
two orders of magnitude smaller. These regions have a relatively high void fraction,
and comparing the results of the simulation with and without bubble phase clearly
shows enhancement of the dissipation rate in these bubbly regions. Figure 4.29 shows
the integrated viscous as well as shear- and bubble-induced SGS dissipation rate in the
breaking region for P1,P2, SP1 and S1. The bubble-induced dissipation is very notice-
able during the jet/splash cycles at which the large volume of bubbles are entrained.
At the end of active breaking, when the bore-like region is formed, bubble-induced
dissipation becomes large and comparable to shear-induced dissipation, again. After
active breaking, the total dissipation rate seems to decay like (t∗)−n where n is about
2.5. In S1, n is smaller during 5 < t∗< 12, but becomes about 2.5 after t∗= 12. The
calculated n is about 40% less than the theoretical value for isotropic turbulence, 17/4.
RM also estimated ε ∝(t∗)−n with n = 2.5. As we expect, the viscous dissipation
rate is small compared to the SGS dissipation rate.

total is the total dissipation from the simula-
tions without the inclusion of the dispersed bubbles.
4.30 shows the results for P1, P2, SP1 and S1. In all the breaker types, most of the
energy is dissipated (more that 80% of the total dissipation) during the ﬁrst period after
breaking, with bubble-induced dissipation bigger than the shear-induced dissipation.
Table 4.1 summarizes the diﬀerent dissipation contributions predicted by the model and
the estimation from LM. Comparing to the experimental estimations, we can conclude
that the simulations without the inclusion of the dispersed bubbles underpredict total
dissipation by about 35% both in plunging and spilling breaking. In addition, bubble-
induced dissipation accounts more than 50% of the total breaking induced dissipation
regardless of the breakers type and intensity. We should note that the cavity break-up
process is not resolved in our simulations, and may be responsible for an additional
dissipation during the initial stage of active breaking.

Time dependent breaking parameter, b
The available estimates of breaking parameter b ranges from O(10−4) to O(10−2),
depending on breaking type and intensity, the unsteady or quasi-steady character,
and probably the method of deﬁning breaking parameter. In most of the previous
experiments, the total breaking-induced dissipation per unit length of breaking crest,
ˆϵtotal, was approximated through surface elevation measurements at ﬁxed locations
upstream and downstream of wave breaking and by implementation of a wave theory
and a simple control volume analysis. The averaged dissipation rate, ˇϵtotal, then, is
deﬁned as ˇϵtotal = ˆϵtotal/τb where τb is a time scale related to active breaking period
and is on the order of breaking wave period, T - note that ˆ(), ˇ() and () represent time
and space integration, space integration and time averaging, respectively. Finally, time
averaged breaking parameter, b, is deﬁned as
b = gˇϵtotal
ρc5 .
(4.19)
For example, Drazen et al. (2008) estimated ˆϵtotal ≈−∆Fb = ρgCgs
R t2
t1 (η2

1)dt where
Cgs is the spectrally weighted group velocity. They chose τb equal to the acoustically
active period as measured by a hydrophone.
Here, we have time dependent information of breaking-induced dissipation rate.

Thus, the time dependent breaking parameter, b, can be readily calculated as
b = gˇϵtotal
ρc5 .
(4.20)
Figure 4.31(a) shows b for the diﬀerent breakers. For all breakers, b decreases about an
order of magnitude at the end of active breaking compared to the initial stage of break-
ing. As expected, the decay rate of b is smaller at the spilling breakers. In addition, it
is clear that b is strongly linked to the breaker intensity, e.g. the corresponding b for P1
is about two order of magnitude greater than for S2. Intuitively, the most important
parameter which can be related to breaker intensity is wave steepness. This is also
conﬁrmed by experimental measurements for both constant-amplitude and constant-
steepness wave packets. Note that, P1, P2, SP1 and S1 are constant-steepness type
packets with S0 ≈0.34 while P3 and S2 are constant-amplitude type packets with
S0 ≈0.25, where S0 is the global steepness of incipient breaking.
The results re-
veal that the rate of increase of the breaking-induced dissipation in the packets with
S0 = 0.34 is considerably greater than the packets with S0 = 0.25. Furthermore, the
linear dependence of breaking-induced dissipation on S −S0 is observed for the cases
with the same S0. This trend also can be recognized in DM ﬁgure 8 in which the
normalized change in energy ﬂux across the control volume increases more noticeably
as S0 increases slightly. Thus, we deﬁne
b = β(S −S0)Sα
0
(4.21)
62

where β is a time dependent parameter and α is a constant. Figure 4.31(b) shows the
resultant β with the choice of α = 4, for all the breakers. As we can see, the choice of
α = 4 successfully conﬁnes the large variation of breaking parameter for the diﬀerent
breakers (ﬁgure 4.31(a)) and the resultant β has the same trend and values regardless
of the breakers type and intensity.
Usually, using a time averaged value of breaking parameter, b, is more preferable
in models with relatively large time scales, e.g. wind-wave models. We deﬁne

where t∗

and spilling breakers, after t∗= 0.3. The appropriate ˇϵtotal in (4.16) should represent
the averaged dissipation rate per unit length of breaking crest during the active bubble
entrainment period which is on the order of breaking wave period. Thus, by choosing
β(t∗= 0.75) = 3, the averaged breaking parameter becomes
b ∼= 3(S −S0)S4
0.
(4.23)
Finally, the averaged breaking-induced dissipation rate per unit length of breaking
crest in the active breaking period can be approximated as
ˇϵtotal ∼= 3ρg−1c5(S −S0)S4
0,
for
S > S0,
(4.24)
and for S < S0 the packet is non-breaking and ˇϵtotal = 0.

Liquid-Bubble Momentum Exchange And Production By The Dis-

through drag, lift and virtual mass forces (2.19) is examined here. Using (2.17) and

In both cases, the drag force is the main interfacial feedback in the vertical
direction, and the spanwise averaged forces in the spanwise direction are an order of
magnitude smaller than in the other two directions. The main interphase exchange in
the streamwise direction occurs at the bubble entrainment period (t∗= 0 ∼0.6 for P1

The drag force mostly damps the turbulence and organized ﬂow, while the virtual
mass force enhances them. After t∗∼0.6, on the other hand, the total work done on
turbulence decreases considerably and the work done by the drag force on the organized
ﬂow becomes the most noticeable feedback.

Figure 4.36 shows the total work done by the drag, virtual mass and lift forces on the
organized and turbulent motions for P1 and SP1. The total work done by the drag and
lift forces damp the organized ﬂow and turbulence while the work done by the virtual
mass force enhances them in both cases. The summation of the total work done by all
three mechanisms, hereafter refers to the production by the dispersed bubbles, leads to
a diﬀerent behavior in the diﬀerent breakers. Figure 4.37 shows the organized ﬂow and
TKE production by the dispersed bubbles for P1 and SP1. After the period of active
breaking, say t∗= 1.5, the total productions of the organized ﬂow and TKE by the
dispersed bubbles in the breaking region, ˆBk(t∗= 1.5), ˆBm(t∗= 1.5) would indicate
the integral eﬀects during active breaking. Thus, in the plunging breaker, production
by the dispersed bubbles enhances the turbulence and damps the organized ﬂow. In the
spilling case, on the other hand, it damps the turbulence and enhances the organized
ﬂow.
4.9
TKE Transport In The Breaking Region
Figure 4.38 demonstrates that the other mechanisms, such as buoyancy pro-
duction, production by mean shear and dissipation, should be considered beside the
production by the dispersed bubbles, to examine turbulence modulation by dispersed
bubbles under breaking waves.
In LES, the transport equation for resolved TKE can be obtained based on the
resolved velocity ﬁeld. SGS dissipation contains both shear- and bubble-induced dis-
sipation and typically is much bigger than the viscous dissipation (ﬁgure 4.30). In the
case of a two phase ﬂow with a dilute regime (α ≈1), common practice is to use the
conventional single phase TKE transport equation with an additional term due to a
67

correlation between ﬂuctuating concentration and vertical turbulent velocity compo-
nent, −ρgα′w′. As we showed, high turbulent and dissipative regions are collocated
with high void fraction regions. Due to a large void fraction (> 10%) during active
breaking period, the dilute assumption is not valid anymore, and concentration ﬂuc-
tuations can not be ignored. The exact resolved TKE transport equation is derived in
Appendix B.2. The ﬁnal equation is given by

4.9.1
The two phase vs single phase TKE transport equation
Figures 4.39 and 4.40 show the corresponding values for the total production
rate by mean shear and SGS dissipation in the breaking region using the exact two
phase transport equation and the single phase transport equation. As we can see, the
total SGS dissipation rate is overpredicted by about 30 to 50% by (4.30) when the void
fractions are high. The total production rate by mean shear is also over predicted by the
single phase formulation but the over prediction is smaller than 10%. Figures 4.41 and
4.42 show diﬀerent terms in the total production rate by mean shear and dissipation
rate given by (4.29) and (eq4.30). The extra terms with triple ﬂuctuating correlation
are usually larger than the other extra term both in production and SGS dissipation
rate. In addition, during the initial stage of active breaking, they are the dominant
terms. The extra terms in the total SGS dissipation rate of the two phase formulation
are noticeable only at the entrainment stages. In production terms, instead, ˇP k
ex1 and
ˇP k
ex2 are comparable to ˇP k in 0 < t∗< 1.
4.9.2
Turbulence modulation by the dispersed bubbles
Figures 4.43 and 4.44 show the total production rate by mean shear and SGS
dissipation rate for the simulations with and without the inclusion of the dispersed
bubbles.
The presence of dispersed bubbles reduces turbulence production rate by
mean shear while enhancing the turbulence dissipation rate. The total production rate
by buoyancy ˇEk
p is an order of magnitude smaller than the production rate by mean
shear and the dispersed bubbles (ﬁgure 4.45).
Figure 4.46 shows the dispersed bubbles damped total TKE about 20 to 30% in
the plunging breakers. Exception is in 0.1 < t∗< 0.5, where TKE is damped slightly or
even enhanced in the large plunging case, P1. This can be explained through turbulence
production by dispersed bubbles in which enhances TKE to some extend. Figure 4.37
shows that bubbles enhance large scale turbulent motions through Bk = −f ′
iu′
i at the
entrainment stage, which compensates some portion of both the reduction of mean
shear production and enhancement of dissipation during these times by the dispersed

bubbles. In P1 the turbulence production by dispersed bubbles is very large, leading
to the net enhancement of total TKE during 0.1 < t∗< 0.5. In the smaller spilling
breaker, S1, this production by bubbles are weak and thus, the decrease of TKE is
more noticeable and about 50%. Finally, ﬁgure 4.46 reveals that total TKE can also
be scaled by (S −S0)S4
0 similar to the averaged dissipation rate (4.24).

Velocity Spectra
The one sided wavenumber spectra is calculated as
Eij(kj, t) = 2Ndxj|ˆui(kj, t)|2,
(4.31)
where N is the number of grid points in the signal, dxj is the grid spacing in j direction
and ˆui(kj, t) is the FFT of ui(xj, t). To calculate Ei1, the velocity signals are selected
between 0.25 < x∗< 1.5 and windowed using a Tukey window with a taper ratio of
0.2. Note that after t∗= 4 the packet has passed the breaking region. As we can see
in ﬁgure 4.47, close to the free surface (z∗= −0.02), E31 < E11 ≈E21 over the whole
range of scales, consistent with Shen & Yue (2001) who also found anisotropy in the
surface layer at all length scales. Far from the free surface (z∗= −0.1), instead, the
turbulent ﬂuctuations in the vertical direction is stronger than or comparable with the
other two components.

CONCLUSION
Continuous poly-disperse two-ﬂuid model was used to study the turbulent bub-
bly ﬂow under a laboratory scale isolated deep water breaking waves imposed by the
focused wave method. Bubbles were entrained at the free surface using the bubble
entrainment model. The free surface was captured by the second order VOF inter-
face tracking scheme. Turbulence was simulated using a LES approach with dynamic
Smagorinsky subgrid formulation. The SGS bubble-induced turbulence and dissipa-
tion as well as momentum transfer between two phases were considered. The main
conclusions can be summarized in the following categories:
(a) Bubble entrainment and transport: It was shown that the entrainment model
can predict the correct volume of entrained bubbles during the jet/splash impacts and
in the bore-like region for the plunging and plunging/spilling breakers. The initial
cavity entrapment is not a turbulence related entrainment mechanism and can be
captured by the VOF model. Although we do not have any detailed measurement for
the purely spilling case to compare with, we can expect that the entrainment model
also predicts the correct volume of entrained air for spilling breakers during the entire
entrainment period, in which bubble entrainment in the bore-like region is the dominant
entrainment mechanism. Comparing snapshots of the void fraction distributions as
well as integral properties of the bubble plumes to the corresponding experiments, we
can conclude that the model captures the spatial and temporal evolution of entrained
bubbles fairly accurately.

(b) Nonlinear interaction of wave packet components: For the ﬁrst time, phase
locking between spectral components was observed in the breaking region, and ex-
plained by calculating the wavelet bispectrum. Phase coupling starts near the break
point and lasts for more than two periods.
(c) Velocity and vorticity ﬁeld: Spanwise averaged velocities were decomposed
into mean current, surface waves and forced long waves.
The current induced by
breaking is noticeable about one wavelength downstream of the breaking point. The
positive current penetrates more than a wave height with the maximum near the still
water depth.
The nearly constant return current compensates the positive current
below the still water depth. The large coherent breaking-induced vortex, previously
observed by RM and DM, was captured by the model. Based on the penetration
of the TKE and enstrophy, the mixed layer depth was estimated to be 0.5H for the
spilling and 0.75H for the plunging breakers during active breaking, where H is the
wave height before breaking. It becomes about twice deeper at t∗= 4.0, with 1H
for the spilling and 1.5H for the plunging breakers. In P1, the mixed layer depth
further increases to about 2.5H at t∗= 11.0. At later times, the averaged layer depth
remains nearly constant. During active breaking, the turbulent velocity and vorticity
ﬁeld in the near-surface layer were shown to be very anisotropic both in the spilling and
plunging breakers. In the plunging breakers, the anisotropy reduces as time proceeds,
and the vorticity component in the streamwise direction becomes comparable and even
larger than the other two components. In the spilling breakers, on the other hands, the
anisotropy both in the turbulent velocity and vorticity ﬁeld remains noticeable after
active breaking.
The decay rate of both total TKE, ˇk, and total enstrophy, ˇ¯Ω, increase with
increasing breaking intensity. After active breaking, ˇk decays in the form of (t∗)−n in
which n varies from 0.5 to 1.0 for spilling to plunging breaking. ˇ¯Ωhas a similar decay
form with larger n varies from 1.0 to 1.5 for spilling to plunging breaking.
(d) Dissipation: In all the breaker types, most of the energy (more than 80% of
76

the total dissipation) is dissipated during the ﬁrst period after breaking. The bubble-
induced dissipation accounts about 50% of the total dissipation. The bubble-induced
dissipation rate is very noticeable during the jet/splash cycles at which the large volume
of bubbles are entrained. At the end of active breaking, when the bore-like region
is formed, the bubble-induced dissipation rate becomes large and comparable to the
shear-induced dissipation rate, again. After active breaking, the total dissipation rate
was shown to decay like (t∗)−n where n is about 2.5.
In addition, the averaged dissipation rate per unit length of breaking crest is
usually written as bρg−1c5, where c is the phase speed of the breaking wave.
The
breaking parameter, b, has been poorly constrained by experiments and ﬁeld measure-
ments. Time dependent evolution of b was examined for both constant-steepness and
constant-amplitude wave packets. The scaling law for the averaged breaking parameter
was obtained as b ∼= 3(S −S0)S4
0 where S = Σaiki is the global steepness of the packet
and S0 is the global steepness of incipient breaking.
(e) Liquid-bubble momentum exchange: In both spilling and plunging breakers,
the drag force is the main interfacial feedback in the vertical direction. In the stream-
wise direction, the momentum exchange is noticeable during the initial stage of the
active breaking with the spanwise averaged total drag and virtual mass forces are at
the same order but in the opposite direction. The total work done by the drag and
lift forces damp the organized ﬂow and turbulence while the work done by the virtual
mass force enhances them in both the spilling and plunging breakers.
(f) The two phase vs single phase TKE transport equation: Due to a large void
fraction (> 10%) during active breaking, the dilute assumption is not valid anymore,
and concentration ﬂuctuations can not be ignored.
The exact two-phase transport
equation for TKE was derived. It was found that in the high void fraction regions,
SGS dissipation rate is over predicted about 30 to 50% by the single phase TKE
transport equation. The total production rate by mean shear is also over predicted by
the single phase formulation but the over prediction is smaller than 10%. The extra
terms with triple ﬂuctuating correlation are usually larger than the other extra term
77

both in production and SGS dissipation rate in the two-phase TKE transport equation.
(g) Turbulence modulation by dispersed bubbles: All of the 3D simulations are
repeated without the inclusion of dispersed bubble phase, and it is shown that the
integrated TKE in the breaking region is damped by the dispersed bubbles about 20%
for the large plunging breaker to 50% for the spilling breaker. In the plunging breakers,
TKE is damped slightly or even enhanced during the initial stage of active breaking.
This was explained through the noticeable turbulence production by the dispersed
bubbles in the larger plunging breakers during the initial stage of active breaking.

VOID VS ACTUAL AIR
To study breaking waves in laboratory scale with 3D LES VOF-based models,
the common practice is to neglect the computations in the air side by replacing the
air by void (Christensen & Deigaard 2001, Watanabe et al. 2005, Christensen 2006).
An exception is Lakehal & Liovic (2011) where actual air density and viscosity was
considered. In all the studies the mesh resolution in the stream wise direction is much
coarser than the other two directions, ∆x
∆y = ∆x
∆z ∼5 (as compared to ∼3 in the present
study). The eﬀects of replacing the air by void and coarse resolution in one direction in
the entrainment process especially the cavity formation and break-up process should
be addressed. Figure A.1 shows that if we have enough spatial resolution the initial
cavity shape and volume was captured fairly accurate compared to measurements even
by 2d grid with void/water interface. To examine the eﬀects on the break up process,
we design a simple bubble ring formation test by putting a cavity, 0.3m below the free
surface in quiescent water. Figure A.2 shows the results of cavity evolution for the
air/water and void/water cases where the mesh resolution is 23.0 × 7.0 × 7.0 mm; and
also the results for the air/water case with the mesh resolution of 7.0 × 7.0 × 7.0 mm.
It is clear that with the coarser resolution the true break up can not capture even
with modeling actual air, but at the coarser resolution the results with air or void are
comparable. Figure A.3 shows the centroid position of cavity for the three cases. As
we can see the rising velocity in the case with void are comparable to the model with
air and it is because the pressure diﬀerence or buoyancy force is considered in all of
the cases. We should note that the volume of cavity does not conserve in the case
with void because of the semi-compressible treatment in the cells with 0 < αl < 1.
We should mention that we only ignore the computations in the cells that are ﬁlled

completely by void αl = 0 (e.g. above the free surface) and then if we increase the
resolution in the void/water model there are a lot of cells, ﬁlled only by void and then
they can freely squeeze and we lose the main volume of the cavity.
We can conclude
that the void/water model can capture the free surface evolution before breaking, the
cavity shape and volume. The overall cavity evolution and integrated rising velocity
can be captured for the void pocket with the dimension of < 2∆x.
