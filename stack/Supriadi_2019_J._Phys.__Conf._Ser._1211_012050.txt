Abstract. A simple alternative to solve problems in the material of Einstein's 
special relativity. Einstein's special material of relativity is material that has so 
many similarities. Equations in the material of Einstein's special relativity among 
others are time dilation equations, long contractions, relativistic masses, and 
relativistic energy. This research will discuss how the relationship between the 
Pythagorean theorem equation and Einstein’s special relativity equationand show 
how to use the Pythagoras method to solve Einstein’s special relativity 
problem.Steps in this research are calculated the equation for the Pythagoras 
theorem, calculate the equation of Einstein's special relativity, then analyze how 
the relationships between the Pythagorastheorem equation with the Einstein's 
special relativity equation. 
 
1. Introduction  
Einstein's special relativity is a matter of physics which is classified into the material of 
modern physics. Physics is a difficult science. This was also explained by Sugiana in his 
article that the difficulty is caused by limited ability and lack interest of the student in 
physics,besides that physics is also considered a subject that has many complex equations 
[1]. 
The many equations found in Einstein's special material of relativity also creates its 
own difficulties for students who try to learn it. The equations of special relativity are the 
equation of time dilation, length contraction, relativistic mass, and relativistic energy. To 
reduce these difficulties a simple solution is needed so that problems in the material of 
special relativity can be solved easily. The Pythagoras theorem can be an option that can 
be used to solve the problem of Einstein’s special relativity. The Pythagoras theorem is an 
equation that has to do with the rightangles. The definition of the Pythagoras equation is 
the square area on the hypotenuse in the right triangle will have the same value as the sum 
of the square area from the other side of the elbow. 
Previously research was conducted by Okun and Korkmaz, Previously, research was 
conducted by Okun and Korkmaz, namely about the Pythagorean theorem which can be 
one solution to solve the problem of Einstein's special relativity. The research what has 
been done by Okun is research on formula transmission from the theory of special and

general relativity into a simple form, namely the formula of energy, momentum, and mass 
[2]. The research conducted by Kormazk is a study of the application of the Pythagorean 
theorem to the world of education. The relativity equation used in korkmas research is 
time dilation equations, long contractions, and relativistic masses [3].  
With these two basic researchers in this matter,This Research want to try to develop 
the relationship between the equation of the Pythagorean theorem with all the equations 
of Einstein's special relativity, namely time dilation equations, long contractions, 
relativistic masses, and relativistic energy. The renewal of this research lies in the form of 
the equation produced and the method used also uses a different approach, that is, using 
examples from the equation of the Pythagorean theorem, so that the existence of this 
renewal can make the alternative in solving Einstein's special problems of relativity 
simpler. 
 
2. The equation of Einstein’s special relativity  
Einstein's special relativity equation that will be analyzed in this research is time dilation 
equations, long contraction equations, relativistic mass equations, and relativistic energy 
equations. 
 
2.1 Time dilation equation  
Time measurement observed by an observer in motion with speeds approaching the speed 
of light will feel longer compared to time observed by a silent observer, this is called time 
dilation. Time dilation is affected by relative motion between observers and observed 
objects [5]. The same is true as explained by Joseph in his article that time dilation is a 
measurement where two observers will not get the same time measurement results [6]. 
The relationship between the two can be written into the equation as follows: 
∆𝑡= 
∆𝑡0
 1− 𝑣2
𝑐2
 
 
(1) 
2.2 Long contraction equation 
The length of an object measured by an observer which moves at speeds close to the 
speed of light will be shorter than the length of an object measured by silent observers 
[7]. The cause of this long contraction is the observer's relative motion of the object 
observed [8].  
The relationship between the length of the object observed by a moving observer with 
an observer who is silent about things can be written in the long contraction equation as 
follows: 
L = L0 1 − 𝑣2
𝑐2 
(2) 
 
 
 
 
2.3 Relativistic mass equation  
The object's mass is measured by the observer in a moving frame of reference with 
speeds approaching the speed of light will be bigger than that the mass of the object 
measured by the observer silence [9].

The equation for connecting the magnitude of the mass of an object which is measured 
by a moving observer with the mass of objects measured by a silent observer as follows: 
m = 
𝒎𝟎
 𝟏− 𝒗𝟐
𝒄𝟐
 
 
(3) 
2.4 Relationship between mass and energy  
The total energy of a moving object relative is the sum of the object's silent energy and 
motion energy, or it can be written: 
E = E0 + K 
 
(4) 
 
 
Or  
K = E – E0 
 
(5) 
Noted that : 
 
E0 = m0c2 
 
(6) 
 
E  = mc2 
 
(7) 
 
Using relativistic mass equations as in equation (3), kinetic energy equations can be 
expressed in the following equation: 
K = 
𝑚0
 1− 𝑣2
𝑐2
c2 – m0c2 
 
(8) 
 
K =  
1
 1− 𝑣2
𝑐2
 −1 m0c2  
(9) 
 
K =  
1
 1− 𝑣2
𝑐2
 −1  E0 
 
(10) 
 
So that relationships can be obtained between a large amount of energy measured by a 
moving observer with large measured energy by silent observers are as follows: 
E= 
𝐸0
 1− 𝑣2
𝑐2
 
 
(11) 
3. Methodology  
This research will find out therelationships between the Pythagorean theorem equation 
with the Einstein's special relativity equation with the following steps, namely,calculate 
the equation for the Pythagoras theorem, calculate the equation of Einstein's special 
relativity, then analyze how the relationships between the Pythagoras theorem equation 
with the Einstein's special relativity equation.The following are the calculating steps for 
thePythagorean theorem equation and Einstein’sspecial relativity equation.

3.1 Pythagorean Theorem  
 
 
From the picture, it will be obtained that: 
Sin𝜃 = 𝑝
𝑟 
 
(12) 
Cos𝜃 = 
𝑞
𝑟 
 
(13) 
The Pythagorean theorem is the square of the length of the hypotenuse equal to the sum 
of squares of the height of a right triangle with its base [4]. The pythagorean theorem can 
also be obtained from relationships trigonometry of sin θ with cos θ with the equation as 
follows: 
Sin2 𝜃 + Cos2𝜃 = 1 
 
(14) 
 
So that it will be obtained:

𝑟2 =  1

3.2 Time dilation equation in the phytagorean theorem  :  
By the using phytagoras method the time dilation equation can be written as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
∆𝑡02
∆𝑡2 + 𝑣2
𝑐2 = 1

In the long contraction equation who uses the Pythagoras method an equation will be 
obtained as follows: 
 
𝐿2

𝑣2
𝑐2 = 1 
 
(17) 
 
 
3.4 Relativistic mass equations in the Pythagorean theorem : 
By using the same method as time dilation equations and long contractions, relativistic 
mass equations can be written as follows:

3.5 Relativistic energy equations in the Pythagorean theorem : 
Using the same method as the equation - other similarities of special relativity, then the 
equation can be written as follows: 
𝐸02
𝐸2 + 
𝑣2
𝑐2 = 1 
 
(19) 
4. Result and discussion 
From the results of the development that has been done, obtained the equation of special 
relativity which has similarities as in the Pythagorean theorem which has also been 
calculated namely,𝑝2
𝑟2 + 𝑞2
𝑟2 =  1. These special relativity equations include (1) ∆𝑡02
∆𝑡2 + 𝑣2
𝑐2 =
1in the case of time dilation; (2) 𝐿2
𝐿02 + 𝑣2
𝑐2 = 1 in the case of long contraction; (3) 
𝑚02
𝑚2 + 
𝑣2
𝑐2 = 1 in the case of relativistic mass; and (4) 
𝐸02
𝐸2 + 
𝑣2
𝑐2 = 1 in the case of 
relativistic energy. In the four equations above, ∆𝑡0,𝐿0, 𝑚0, and 𝐸0 is the time, length, 
mass and energy measured by the observer who is silent relative to the object observed or 
measured, while ∆𝑡, 𝐿, 𝑚, and 𝐸 is time, length, mass and energy measured by observers 
moving relative to the object being observed or measured. For  𝑣 is the speed of the 
observer and 𝑐 is the speed of light. 
The following is the result of an analysis of the Pythagorean theorem equation with 
Einstein's special relativity equation. In the equation of time dilation when an analysis is 
carried out, it can be done by connecting the time dilation equation with the Pythagorean 
theorem equation. The relationship is obtained by specifying the time dilation equation 
variables with the Pythagorean theorem equation variable that is, ∆𝑡0as p, v as𝑞then 
∆𝑡and𝑐as r. In the same length contraction equation the same thing is applied, which is to 
assume the long contraction equation variables with the pythagorean theorem equation 
variable so that it can be assumed 𝐿 as 𝑝, 𝑣 as 𝑞 then 𝐿0 and 𝑐 as 𝑟. In relativistic mass 
equations ,can be assumed 𝑚0 as 𝑝 ,  𝑣 as 𝑞 then  𝑚 and 𝑐 as 𝑟. The relativistic energy 
equation can be assumed 𝐸0 as 𝑝 , 𝑣 as 𝑞 then 𝐸 and 𝑐 as 𝑟. The results of the analysis 
can also be described in the following table form.

Paying attention to the four equations of special relativity when associated with the 
Pythagorean theorem equation, then the comparison ∆𝑡, 𝑚 and 𝐸 the amount of silence is 
a comparison of the number of sides of the right triangle to the pair of pythagorean 
numbers, except for cases of long contractions the reverse applies that is,  comparison 𝐿 
the amount of silence is a comparison of the number of short sides of righthe t triangle to 
the pair of pythagorean numbers. The pair of Pythagorean numbers can be found using 
equations 1 - 
𝑣2
𝑐2. For example, if the observer's speed is against the object 0,8 c, then 
using the pythagorean theorem, the Pythagorean number pair is obtained 6. To determine 
the value of the relativistic magnitude, you can use the comparison of the Pythagorean 
number above according to the case. 
For time dilation, apply 
∆𝑡
∆𝑡0 =

10
6  
times the time measured by a silent observer . Thus for long contractions, apply 
𝐿
𝐿0 =

or the length of the object measured by the observer that is moving relative is 6
10 times the 
length of the object measured by a silent observer. In relativistic mass equations, apply

6 multiplied by the mass of the object measured by the silent observer. It also applies 
equally to relativistic energy equations that is, 𝐸
𝐸0 = 10
6 or energy measured by observers 
who move relative is 
10
6 multiplied by the energy measured by an observer that is 
stationary relative to the object being measured. 
The following is an example of a case on the question of Einstein's special relativity, 
namely the equation of time dilation, length contraction, relativistic mass and relativistic 
energy. The first case, the problem of time dilation.  If it is known that the time observed 
by an observer moving towards an event has a change in time (∆𝑡) as much 20 seconds, 
then it is known that in the event the observer moves with speed (v) 0,8c. The v value can 
also be written in fthe orm 𝑣
𝑐 = 8
10. Enter this value into riga ht triangle with v on side q 
and c on side r. The p side can be obtained using the pythagorean method, so that the side 
p is obtained 6. Thus, the change in time is measured by a silent observer relative to the 
object  (∆𝑡0) is ∆𝑡0 = 6
10 ∆𝑡 . The size of ∆t is 20 seconds, so the magnitude ∆𝑡0 is  6
10 × 
20 seconds. Obtained the amount of ∆𝑡0 is 12 seconds. 
The second case, the problem of long contractions. It is known that the length of the 
object observed by the observer is stationary relative to the object (𝐿0) is 100.  From these 
events ,the thing that will be sought is the length of the object observed by an observer 
moving relative to the object. Observers move at speed 0,4c. From the value v which says 
0.4c will have the same value when changed to 𝑣
𝑐 = 4
10. Enter this value into riga ht 
triangle with v on side q and c on side r. The p side can be obtained using the pythagorean 
method, so that the p side is 2  21. Then the length of the object observed by the 
observer moving relative to the object (𝐿) is 𝐿= 2 21
10  × 𝐿0 . The size of 𝐿0 is 100, so the 
magnitude 𝐿 is 𝐿= 2 21
10  × 100. Obtained amount 𝐿 is 20  21, or 91,6 m. 
The third case, relativistic mass problems. There is an incident where an object is 
being observed by a silent observer and is observed by an observer moving at a speed 
close to the speed of light. if it is known the value of the mass of objects observed by the 
observer is silent (m0) is 50 gr, then in this event, the thing to look for is the mass of 
objects observed by observers moving at speed (v) 0,6 c. The speed value can be changed 
to  𝑣
𝑐  = 6
10 . Enter this value into ria ght triangle with v on side q and c on side r. The p 
side can be obtained using the pythagorean method, so that the p side is 8. So to find the 
mass of objects observed by a moving observer (m) can be done by means of 𝑚=
10
8 𝑚0. 
It is known that m0 is 50 gr, then the size of m is  
10
8 × 50. So it is found that the size of m 
is 6.25 gr. 
The fourth case, relativistic energy problems. If it is known that there is an object 
observed by an observer in a moving state at a speed close to the speed of light and the 
object has the energy (𝐸) of 40 Mev, then from the event the thing to look for is the 
amount of silent energy from the object . the speed of a moving observer is  0,6c . The 
value of 0.6c can be written in 
𝑣
𝑐  = 
6
10 . Enter this value into right triangle with v on side q 
and c on side r. The p side can be obtained using the pythagorean method, so that the p 
side is 8. So to find the amount of energy observed by the silent observer (𝐸0) it can be 
done by 𝐸0 = 8
10  𝐸 . It is known that the magnitude of E is 40, then the magnitude of 𝐸  is  
8
10 × 40. So that it is found that the size of 𝐸 is 32 Mev.

From several cases of time dilation problems, long contractions, relativistic masses 
and relativistic energy have proven that Einstein's special form of special relativity that 
has similarities to the Pythagorean theorem equation, can make Pythagorean theorem one 
of the quick and simple methods to solve Einstein's special relativity problem. This 
research can be further developed for future researchers. So that in this case, the advice 
that can be given from the author to the next researcher is the results of this study can be 
applied to learning. The next researcher can also find an alternative problem-solving in 
other physics material. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the calculations of Einstein's special relativity equations a new equationhave 
been obtained.Furthermore, after analysis showed that the equation of Einstein's special 
relativity with the Pythagoras theorem equation has the same form of the equation. The 
similarity of the form of equations can make the Pythagorean theorem a simple solution 
to solve Einstein's special relativity problem.
