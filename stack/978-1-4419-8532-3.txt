Foreword 
The purpose of a first course in calculus is to teach the student the basic 
notions of derivative and integral, and the basic techniques and applica-
tions which accompany them. The very talented students, with an ob-
vious aptitude for mathematics, will rapidly require a course in functions 
of one real variable, more or less as it is understood by professional 
mathematicians. This book is not primarily addressed to them (although 
I hope they will be able to acquire from it a good introduction at an 
early age). 
I have not written this course in the style I would use for an 
advanced monograph, on sophisticated topics. One writes an advanced 
monograph for oneself, because one wants to give permanent form 
to one's vision of some beautiful part of mathematics, not otherwise ac-
cessible, somewhat in the manner of a composer setting down his sym-
phony in musical notation. 
This book is written for the students to give them an immediate, and 
pleasant, access to the subject. I hope that I have struck a proper com-
promise, between dwelling too much on special details and not giving 
enough technical exercises, necessary to acquire the desired familiarity 
with the subject. In any case, certain routine habits of sophisticated 
mathematicians are unsuitable for a first course. 
Rigor. This does not mean that so-called rigor has to be abandoned. 
The logical development of the mathematics of this course from the most 
basic axioms proceeds through the following stages: 
Set theory 
Integers (whole numbers) 
Rational numbers (fractions) 
Numbers (i.e. real numbers) 
Limits 
Derivatives and forward. 

vi 
FOREWORD 
No one in his right mind suggests that one should begin a course with 
set theory. It happens that the most satisfactory place to jump into the 
subject is between limits and derivatives. In other words, any student is 
ready to accept as intuitively obvious the notions of numbers and limits 
and their basic properties. Experience shows that the students do not 
have the proper psychological background to accept a theoretical study 
of limits, and resist it tremendously. 
In fact, it turns out that one can have the best of both ideas. The 
arguments which show how the properties of limits can be reduced to 
those of numbers form a self-contained whole. Logically, it belongs 
before the subject matter of our course. Nevertheless, we have inserted it 
as an appendix. If some students feel the need for it, they need but read 
it and visualize it as Chapter O. In that case, everything that follows is 
as rigorous as any mathematician would wish it (so far as objects which 
receive an analytic definition are concerned). Not one word need be 
changed in any proof. I hope this takes care once and for all of possible 
controversies concerning so-called rigor. 
Most students will not feel any need for it. My opinion is that 
epsilon-delta should be entirely left out of ordinary calculus classes. 
Language and logic. It is not generally recognized that some of the 
major difficulties in teaching mathematics are analogous to those in 
teaching a foreign language. (The secondary schools are responsible for 
this. Proper training in the secondary schools could entirely eliminate 
this difficulty.) Consequently, I have made great efforts to carry the 
student verbally, so to say, in using proper mathematical language. It 
seems to me essential that students be required to write their mathe-
matics papers in full and coherent sentences. A large portion of their 
difficulties with mathematics stems from their slapping down mathe-
matical symbols and formulas isolated from a meaningful sentence and 
appropriate quantifiers. Papers should also be required to be neat and 
legible. They should not look as if a stoned fly had just crawled out of 
an inkwell. Insisting on reasonable standards of expression will result in 
drastic improvements of mathematical performance. The systematic use 
of words like "let," "there exists," "for all," "if ... then," "therefore" 
should be taught, as in sentences like: 
Let f(x) be the function such that ... . 
There exists a number such that .. . . 
For all numbers x with 0 < x < 1, we have .... 
If f is a differentiable function and K a constant such that 
f'(x) = Kf(x), then f(x) = CeKx for some constant C. 
Plugging in. I believe that it is unsound to view "theory" as adversary 
to applications or "computations." The present book treats both as 

FOREWORD 
vii 
complementary to each other. Almost always a theorem gives a tool for 
more efficient computations (e.g. Taylor's formula, for computing values 
of functions). 
Different classes will of course put different emphasis on 
them, omitting some proofs, but I have found that if no excessive 
pedantry is introduced, students are willing, and even eager, to under-
stand the reasons for the truth of a result, i.e. its proof. 
It is a disservice to students to teach calculus (or other mathematics, 
for that matter) in an exclusive framework of "plugging in" ready-made 
formulas. Proper teaching consists in making the student adept at han-
dling a large number of techniques in a routine manner (in particular, 
knowing how to plug in), but it also consists in training students in 
knowing some general principles which will allow them to deal with new 
situations for which there are no known formulas to plug in. 
It is impossible in one semester, or one year, to find the time to deal 
with all desirable applications (economics, statistics, biology, chemistry, 
physics, etc.). On the other hand, covering the proper balance between 
selected applications and selected general principles will equip students to 
deal with other applications or situations by themselves. 
Worked-out problems and exercises. For the convenience of both stu-
dents and instructors, a large number of worked-out problems has been 
added in the present edition. Many of these have been put in the answer 
section, to be referred to as needed. I did this for at least two reasons. 
First, in the text, they might obscure the main ideas of the course. 
Second, it is a good idea to make students think about a problem before 
they see it worked out. They are then much more receptive, and will 
retain the methods better for having encountered the difficulties (what-
ever they are, depending on individual students) by themselves. Both 
the inclusion of worked-out examples and their placement in the answer 
section was requested by students. Unfortunately, the requirements for 
good teaching, testing, and academic pressures are in conflict here. The 
de facto tendency is for students to object to being asked to think (even 
if they fail), because they are afraid of being penalized with bad grades 
for homework. Instructors may either make too strong requirements on 
students, or may take the path of least resistance and never require any-
thing beyond plugging in new numbers in a type of exercise which has 
already been worked out (in class or in the book). I believe that testing 
conditions (limited time, pressures of other courses and examinations) 
make it difficult (if not unreasonable) to test students other than with 
basic, routine problems. I do not conclude that the course should con-
sist only of this type of material. Some students often take the attitude 
that if something is not on tests, then why should it be covered in the 
course? I object very much to this attitude. I have no global solution to 
these conflicting pressures.

FOREWORD 
General organization. I have made no great innovations in the exposi-
tion of calculus. Since the subject was discovered some 300 years ago, 
such innovations were out of the question. 
I have cut down the amount of analytic geometry to what is both 
necessary and sufficient for a general first course in this type of mathe-
matics. For some applications, more is required, but these applications 
are fairly specialized. For instance, if one needs the special properties 
concerning the focus of a parabola in a course on optics, then that is the 
place to present them, not in a general course which is to serve mathe-
maticians, physicists, chemists, biologists, and engineers, to mention but 
a few. I regard the tremendous emphasis on the analytic geometry of 
conics which has been the fashion for many years as an unfortunate 
historical accident. What is important is that the basic idea of represent-
ing a graph by a figure in the plane should be thoroughly understood, 
together with basic examples. The more abstruse properties of ellipses, 
parabolas, and hyperbolas should be skipped. 
Differentiation and the elementary functions are covered first. Integra-
tion is covered second. Each makes up a coherent whole. For instance, 
in the part on differentiation, rate problems occur three times, illustrating 
the same general principle but in the contexts of several elementary func-
tions (polynomials at first, then trigonometric functions, then inverse 
functions). This repetition at brief intervals is pedagogically sound, and 
contributes to the coherence of the subject. It is also natural to slide 
from integration into Taylor's formula, proved with remainder term by 
integrating by parts. It would be slightly disagreeable to break this se-
quence. 
Experience has shown that Chapters III through VIII make up an 
appropriate curriculum for one term (differentiation and elementary func-
tions) while Chapters IX through XIII make up an appropriate curricu-
lum for a second term (integration and Taylor's formula). The first two 
chapters may be used for a quick review by classes which are not 
especially well prepared. 
I find that all these factors more than offset the possible disadvantage 
that for other courses (physics, chemistry perhaps) integration is needed 
early. This may be true, but so are the other topics, and unfortunately 
the course has to be projected in a totally ordered way on the time axis. 
In addition to this, studying the log and exponential before integration 
has the advantage that we meet in a special concrete case the situa-
tion where we find an antiderivative by means of area: log x is the area 
under l/x between 1 and x. We also see in this concrete case how 
dA(x)ldx = f(x), where A(x) is the area. This is then done again in full 
generality when studying the integral. Furthermore, inequalities involving 
lower sums and upper sums, having already been used in this concrete 
case, become more easily understandable in the general case. Classes 
which start the term on integration without having gone through the 

FOREWORD 
IX 
part on differentiation might well start with the last section of the 
chapter on logarithms, i.e. the last section of Chapter VIII. 
Taylor's formula is proved with the integral form of the remainder, 
which is then properly estimated. The proof with integration by parts is 
more natural than the other (differentiating some complicated expression 
pulled out of nowhere), and is the one which generalizes to the higher 
dimensional case. I have placed integration after differentiation, because 
otherwise one has no technique available to evaluate integrals. 
I personally think that the computations which arise naturally from 
Taylor's formula (computations of values of elementary functions, com-
putation of e, n, log 2, computations of definite integrals to a few deci-
mals, traditionally slighted in calculus courses) are important. This was 
clear already many years ago, and is even clearer today in the light of 
the pocket computer proliferation. Designs of such computers rely pre-
cisely on effective means of computation by means of the Taylor poly-
nomials. Learning how to estimate effectively the remainder term in 
Taylor's formula gives a very good feeling for the elementary functions, 
not obtainable otherwise. 
The computation of integrals like 
or 
rO.1 
Jo e- x2 dx 
which can easily be carried out numerically, without the use of a simple 
form for the indefinite integral, should also be emphasized. Again it 
gives a good feeling for an aspect of the integral not obtainable other-
wise. Many texts slight these applications in favor of expanded treatment 
of applications of integration to various engineering situations, like fluid 
pressure on a dam, mainly by historical accident. I have nothing against 
fluid pressure, but one should keep in mind that too much time spent on 
some topics prevents adequate time being spent on others. For instance, 
Ron Infante tells me that numerical computations of integrals like 
f
1 sin x dx, 
° x 
which we carry out in Chapter XIII, occur frequently in the study of 
communication networks, in connection with square waves. Each in-
structor has to exercise some judgment as to what should be emphasized 
at the expense of something else. 
The chapters on functions of several variables are included for classes 
which can proceed at a faster rate, and therefore have time for additional 
material during the first year. 
Under ordinary circumstances, these 
chapters will not be covered during a first-year course. For instance, they 
are not covered during the first-year course at Yale.

FOREWORD 
Induction. I think the first course in calculus is a good time to learn 
induction. However, an attempt to teach induction without having met 
natural examples first meets with very great psychological difficulties. 
Hence throughout the part on differentiation, I have not mentioned in-
duction formally. Whenever a situation arises where induction may be 
used, I carry out stepwise procedures illustrating the inductive procedure. 
After enough repetitions of these, the student is then ready to see a 
pattern which can be summarized by the formal "induction," which just 
becomes a name given to a notion which has already been understood. 
Review material. The present edition also emphasizes more review 
material. Deficient high school training is responsible for many of the 
difficulties experienced at the college level. These difficulties are not so 
much due to the problem of understanding calculus as to the inability to 
handle elementary algebra. A large group of students cannot automati-
cally give the expansion for expressions like 
or 
(a + b)(a - b). 
The answers should be memorized like the multiplication table. To 
memorize by rote such basic formulas is not incompatible with learning 
general principles. It is complementary. 
To avoid any misunderstandings, I wish to state explicitly that the 
poor preparation of so many high school students cannot be attributed 
to the "new math" versus the "old math." When I started teaching 
calculus as a graduate student in 1950, I found the quasi-totality of 
college freshmen badly prepared. 
Today, I find only a substantial 
number of them (it is hard to measure how many). On the other hand, 
a sizable group at the top has had the opportunity to learn some 
calculus, even as much as one year, which would have been inconceiv-
able in former times. As bad as the situation is, it is nevertheless an 
improvement. 
I wish to thank my colleagues at Yale and others in the past who 
have suggested improvements in the book: Edward Bierstone (University 
of Toronto), Folke Eriksson (University of Gothenburg), R. W. Gatter-
dam (University of Wisconsin, Parkside), and George Metakides (Univer-

Part One 
Review of 
Basic Material 
If you are already at ease with the elementary properties of numbers and 
if you know about coordinates and the graphs of the standard equations 
(linear equations, parabolas, ellipses), then you should start immediately 
with Chapter III on derivatives. 

CHAPTER 
Numbers and Functions 
In starting the study of any sort of mathematics, we cannot prove every-
thing. Every time that we introduce a new concept, we must define it in 
terms of a concept whose meaning is already known to us, and it is 
impossible to keep going backwards defining forever. Thus we must 
choose our starting place, what we assume to be known, and what we 
are willing to explain and prove in terms of these assumptions. 
At the beginning of this chapter, we shall describe most of the things 
which we assume known for this course. Actually, this involves very 
little. Roughly speaking, we assume that you know about numbers, addi-
tion, subtraction, multiplication, and division (by numbers other than 0). 
We shall recall the properties of inequalities (when a number is greater 
than another). On a few occasions we shall take for granted certain 
properties of numbers which might not have occurred to you before and 
which will always be made precise. Proofs of these properties will be 
supplied in the Appendix for those of you who are interested. 
I, §1. INTEGERS, RATIONAL NUMBERS, AND 
REAL NUMBERS 
The most common numbers are the numbers I, 2, 3, ... which are called 
positive integers. 
The numbers -I, -2, -3, ... are called negative integers. When we 
want to speak of the positive integers together with the negative integers 
and 0, we call them simply integers. Thus the integers are 0, I, -I, 2, 
-2,3, -3, .... 
The sum and product of two integers are again integers. 

4 
NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS 
[I, §l] 
In addition to the integers we have fractions, like t t -1, - 12°71 , 
186"'" which may be positive or negative, and which can be written as 
quotients min, where m, n are integers and n is not equal to O. Such 
fractions are called rational numbers. Every integer m is a rational 
number, because it can be written as mil, but of course it is not true 
that every rational number is an integer. We observe that the sum and 
product of two rational numbers are again rational numbers. If alb and 
min are two rational numbers (a, b, m, n being integers and b, n unequal 
to 0), then their sum and product are given by the following formulas, 
which you know from elementary school: 
a m 
am 
b n 
bn' 
a 
m 
an + bm 
b + -;;- = --b-n-
In this second formula, we have simply put the two fractions over the 
common denominator bn. 
We can represent the integers and rational numbers geometrically on 
a straight line. We first select a unit length. The integers are multiples 
of this unit, and the rational numbers are fractional parts of this unit. 
We have drawn a few rational numbers on the line below. 
~I----~Ir--rl--~I-+I---+I-rl ---~ 
-2 
-1 
-~ 
0 
~ 
1 ~ 
2 
Observe that the negative integers and rational numbers occur to the left 
of zero. 
Finally, we have the numbers which can be represented by infinite 
decimals, like J2 = 1.414... or n = 3.14159 ... , and which will be called 
real numbers or simply numbers. 
The integers and rational numbers are special cases of these infinite 
decimals. For instance, 
3 = 3.000000 ... , 
and 
i = 0.7500000 ... , 
t = 0.3333333 .... 
We see that there may be several ways of denoting the same number, for 
instance as the fraction t or as the infinite decimal 0.33333 .... We have 
written the decimals with dots at the end. If we stop the decimal expan-
sion at any given place, we obtain an approximation to the number. The 
further off we stop the decimal, the better approximation we obtain. 

[I, §2] 
INEQUALITIES 
5 
Finding the decimal expansion for a fraction is easy by the process of 
long division which you should know from high school. 
Later in the course we shall learn how to find decimal expansions for 
other numbers which you may have heard about, like n. You were prob-
ably told that n = 3.14 ... but were not told why. You will learn how to 
compute arbitrarily many decimals for n in Chapter XIII. 
Geometrically, the numbers are represented as the collection of all 
points on the above straight line, not only those which are a rational 
part of the unit length or a multiple of it. 
We note that the sum and product of two numbers are numbers. If a 
is a number unequal to zero, then there is a unique number b such that 
ab = ba = 1, and we write 
1 
b=-a 
or 
We say that b is the inverse of a, or "a inverse." We emphasize that the 
expression 
I/O 
or 
0- I 
is not defined. 
In other words, we cannot divide by zero, and we do not attribute any 
meaning to the symbols 1/0 or 0- 1• 
However, if a is a number, then the prodct o· a is defined and is equal 
to O. The product of any number and 0 is O. Furthermore, if b is any 
number unequal to 0, then O/b is defined and equal to O. It can also be 
written O·(l/b). 
If a is a rational number "# 0, then l/a is also a rational number. 
Indeed, if we can write a = min, with integers m, n both different from 0, 
then 
n 
a 
m 
is also a rational number. 
I, §2. INEQUALITIES 
Aside from addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division (by 
numbers other than 0), we shall now discuss another important feature 
of the real numbers. 
We have the positive numbers, represented geometrically on the 
straight line by those numbers unequal to 0 and lying to the right of o. 
If a is a positive number, we write a> o. You have no doubt already 

6 
NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS 
[I, §2] 
worked with positive numbers, and with inequalities. The next two pro-
perties are the most basic ones, concerning positivity. 
POS 1. If a, b are positive, so is the product ab and the sum a + b. 
POS 2. If a is a number, then either a is positive, or a = 0, or - a is 
positive, and these possibilities are mutually exclusive. 
If a number is not positive and not 0, then we say that this number is 
negative. By POS 2, if a is negative, then -a is positive. 
Although you know already that the number 1 is positive, it can in 
fact be proved from our two properties. It may interest you to see the 
proof, which runs as follows and is very simple. By POS 2, we know 
that either 1 or - 1 is positive. If 1 is not positive, then - 1 is positive. 
By POS 1, it must then follow that (-1)( -1) is positive. But this pro-
duct is equal to 1. Consequently, it must be 1 which is positive, and not 
-1. Using property POS 1, we could now conclude that 1 + 1 = 2 is 
positive, that 2 + 1 = 3 is positive, and so forth. 
If a > 0, we shall say that a is greater than O. If we wish to say that a 
is positive or equal to 0, we write 
a~O 
and read this "a greater than or equal to zero." 
Given two numbers a, b we shall say that a is greater than band 
write a > b if a - b > O. We write a < 0 (a is less than 0) if -a> 0 and 
a < b if b > a. Thus 3 > 2 because 3 - 2 > O. 
We shall write a ~ b when we want to say that a is greater than or 
equal to b. Thus 3 ~ 2 and 3 ~ 3 are both true inequalities. 
Other rules concerning inequalities are valid. 
In what follows, let a, b, e be numbers. 
Rule 1. If a > band b > e, then a > e. 
Rule 2. If a > band e > 0, then ae > be. 
Rule 3. If a > band e < 0, then ae < be. 
Rule 2 expresses the fact that an inequality which is multiplied by a 
positive number is preserved. Rule 3 tells us that if we multiply both 
sides of an inequality by a negative number, then the inequality gets 
reversed. For instance, we have the inequality 
t < 3 
Since 2 > 0 we also have 2· 1 < 2· 3. But - 2 is negative, and if we 
multiply both sides by - 2 we get 
-2> -6. 

[I, §2] 
INEQUALITIES 
7 
In the geometric representation of the real numbers on the line, - 2 lies 
to the right of - 6. This gives us the geometric representation of the fact 
that - 2 is greater than - 6. 
If you wish, you may assume these three rules just as you assume 
POS 1 and POS 2. All of these are used in practice. It turns out that 
the three rules can be proved in terms of POS 1 and POS 2. We can-
not assume all the inequalities which you will ever meet in practice. 
Hence just to show you some techniques which might recur for other 
applications, we show how we can deduce the three rules from POS 1 
and POS 2. You may omit these (short) proofs if you wish. 
To prove Rule 1, suppose that a > band b> e. By definition, this 
means that (a - b) > 0 and (b - c) > O. Using property POS 1, we con-
clude that 
a - b + b - e > 0, 
and canceling b gives us (a - c) > O. By definition, this means a > e, as 
was to be shown. 
To prove Rule 2, suppose that a> band e > O. By definition, 
a - b > O. 
Hence using the property of POS 1 concerning the product of positive 
numbers, we conclude that 
(a - b)e > O. 
The left-hand side of this inequality is none other than ae - be, which is 
therefore> O. Again by definition, this gives us 
ae > be. 
We leave the proof of Rule 3 as an exercise. 
We give an example showing how to use the three rules. 
Example. Let a, b, e, d be numbers with e, d> O. Suppose that 
We wish to prove the "cross-multiplication" rule that 
ad < be. 

8 
NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS 
[I, §2] 
Using Rule 2, multiplying each side of the original inequality bye, we 
obtain 
a < be/d. 
Using Rule 2 again, and multiplying each side by d, we obtain 
ad < be, 
as desired. 
Let a be a number> O. Then there exists a number whose square is 
a. If b2 = a then we observe that 
is also to a. Thus either b or -b is positive. We agree to denote by Ja 
the positive square root and call it simply the square root of a. Thus J4 
is equal to 2 and not - 2, even though (- 2)2 = 4. This is the most 
practical convention about the use of the J sign that we can make. Of 
course, the square root of 0 is 0 itself. A negative number does not have 
a square root in the real numbers. 
There are thus two solutions to an equation 
with a> O. These two solutions are x = Ja and x = -Ja. For In-
stance, the equation x2 = 3 has the two solutions 
x =}3 = 1.732 .. . 
and 
x = -}3 = -1.732 ... . 
The equation x2 = 0 has exactly one solution, namely x = O. The 
equation x 2 = a with a < 0 has no solution in the real numbers. 
Definition. Let a be a number. We define the absolute value of a to 
be 
lal=#. 
In particular, 

[I, §2] 
INEQUALITIES

Thus the absolute value of a number is always ~ O. The absolute value 
of a positive number is always positive. 
Example. We have 
131 = p 
= J9 = 3, 
but 
1-31 = J(-3)2 = J9 = 3. 
Also for any number a we get 
I-al = J(-a)2 = p = lal· 
Theorem 2.1. If a is any number, then 
lal = { a 
-a 
if a ~ 0, 
if a < O. 
Proof If a ~ 0 then a is the unique number ~ 0 whose square is a2, 
so I a I = P = a. If a < 0 then - a > 0 and 
so this time -a is the unique number > 0 whose square is a2, whence 
I a I = - a. This proves the theorem. 
Theorem 2.2. If a, b are numbers, then 
labl = lallbl. 
Proof We have: 
labl = J(ab)2 = Ja2b2 = PP = lallbl· 
As an example, we see that 
1-61=1(-3)·21=1-31121=3·2=6. 
There is one final inequality which is extremely important. 
Theorem 2.3. If a, b are two numbers, then 
la + bl ~ lal + Ibl· 

10 
NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS 
[I, §2] 
Proof We first observe that either ab is positive, or it is negative, or 
it is O. In any case, we have 
ab ~ labl = lal Ibl· 
Hence, multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain the inequality 
2ab ~ 21al Ibl. 
Using this inequality we find: 
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 
~ a2 + 21allbl + b2 
= (Ial + Ibl)2. 
We can take the square root of both sides and lise Theorem 2.1 to 
conclude that 
la + bl ~ lal + Ibl, 
thereby proving our theorem. 
You will find plenty of exercises below to give you practice with in-
equalities. We shall work out some numerical examples to show you the 
way. 
Example t. Determine the numbers satisfying the equality 
Ix + 11 = 2. 
This equality means that either x + 1 = 2 or -(x + 1) = 2, because 
the absolute value of x + 1 is either (x + 1) itself or -(x + 1). In the 
first case, solving for x gives us x = 1, and in the second case, we get 
- x - 1 = 2 or x = - 3. Thus the answer is x = 1 or x = - 3. 
Let a, b be numbers. We may interpret

For instance, if a > b then this is geometrically clear from the figure.

On the other hand, if a < b we have 
la - bl = I-(b - a)1 = Ib - ai, 
and b > a, so again we see that la - bl = Ib - al is the distance between 
a and b. 
In the preceding example, the set of numbers x such that 
Ix + 11 = 2 
is the set of numbers whose distance from - 1 is 2, because we can write 
x + 1 = x - ( - I). 
Hence we see again geometrically that this set of numbers consists of 1 
and - 3, as shown on the figure.

We shall also give an example showing how to determine numbers 
satisfying certain inequalities. For this we need some terminology. Let a, 
b be numbers, and assume a < b. 
The collection of numbers x such that a < x < b is called the open 
interval between a and b, and is sometimes denoted by (a, b). 
The collection of numbers x such that a ~ x ~ b is called the closed 
interval between a and b, and is sometimes denoted by [a, b]. A single 
point will also be called a closed interval. 
In both above cases, the numbers a, b are called the end points of the 
intervals. Sometimes we wish to include only one of them in an inter-
val, and so we define the collection of numbers x such that a ~ x < b 
to be half-closed interval, and similarly for those numbers x such that 
a < x ~ b. 
Finally, if a is a number, we call the collection of numbers x > a, or 
x ~ a, or x < a, or x ~ a an infinite interval. Pictures of intervals are 
shown below.

Example 2. Determine all intervals of numbers satisfying 
Ixl ~ 4. 
We distinguish two cases. The first case is x ~ O. Then Ixl = x, and 
in this case, our inequality amounts to 
o ~ x ~ 4. 
The second case is x < O. In this case, Ixl = -x, and our inequality 
amounts to -x ~ 4, or in other words, -4 ~ x. Thus in the second 
case, the numbers satisfying our inequality are precisely those in the 
interval. 
-4 ~ x < O. 
Considering now both cases together, we see that the interval of numbers 
satisfying our inequality Ixl ~ 4 is the interval 
-4 ~ x ~ 4. 
We can also phrase the answer in terms of distance. The numbers x 
such that Ixl ~ 4 are precisely those numbers whose distance from the 
origin is ~ 4. Thus they constitute the closed interval between -4 and 4 
as shown on the figure.

More generally, let a be a positive number. A number x satisfies the 
inequality Ixl < a if and only if 
-a < x < a. 
The argument to prove this is the same as 10 the special case a = 4 
worked out above. 
Example 3. Determine all intervals of numbers satisfying the inequa-

From the first we get the condition x> 1, and from the second, we get 
the condition - x-I > 2, or in other words, x < - 3. Thus there are 
two (infinite) intervals, namely 
x> 1

x < -3.

A function, defined for all numbers, is an association which to any given 
number associates another number. 
It is customary to denote a flmction by some letter, just as a letter 
"x" denotes a number. Thus if we denote a given function by f, and x is 
a number, then we denote by f(x) the number associated with x by the 
function. This of course does not mean "f times x." There is no multi-
plication involved here. The symbols f(x) are read "f of x." The asso-
ciation of the number f(x) to the number x is sometimes denoted by a 
special arrow, namely 
X 1--+ f(x). 
For example, consider the function which associates to each number x 
the number x 2• If f denotes this function, then we have f(x) = x 2 • In 
particular, the square of 2 is 4 and hence f(2) = 4. The square of 7 is 49 
and thus f(7) = 49. The square of J"2 is 2, and hence f(J2) = 2. The 
square of (x + 1) is 
x 2 + 2x + 1 

[I, §3] 
FUNCTIONS 
15 
and thus f(x + 1) = x 2 + 2x + 1. If h is any number, 
To take another example, let g be the function which to each number 
x associates the number x + 1. Then we may describe g by the symbols 
xl-+x+1 
and write g(x) = x + 1. 
Therefore, g(l) = 2. 
Also g(2) = 3, g(3) = 4, 
g(J2) = J2 + I, and g(x + I) = x + 2 for any number x. 
We can view the absolute value as a function, 
defined by the rule: Given any number a, we associate the number a 
itself if a ~ 0, and we associate the number - a if a < O. Let F denote 
the absolute value function. Then F(x) = Ixl for any number x. We 
have in particular F(2) = 2, and F( - 2) = 2 also. The absolute value is 
not defined by means of a formula like x 2 or x + 1. We give you anoth-
er example of such a function which is not defined by a formula. 
We consider the function G described by the following rule: 
G(x) = 0 if x is a rational number. 
G(x) = 1 if x is not a rational number. 
Then in particular, G(2) = G(f) = G( - i) = 0 but 
G(J2) = 1. 
You must be aware that you can construct a function just by prescribing 
arbitrarily the rule associating a number to a given one. 
If f is a function and x a number, then f(x) is called the value of the 
function at x. Thus if f is the function 
the value of f at 2 is 4 and the value of f at t is i· 
In order to describe a function, we need simply to give its value at 
any number x . That is the reason why we use the notation x 1-+ f(x). 
Sometimes, for brevity, we speak of a function f(x), meaning by that the 
function f whose value at x is f(x). For instance, we would say "Let 
f(x) be the function x 3 + 5" instead of saying "Let f be the function 

16 
NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS 
[I, §3] 
which to each number x associates x3 + 5." Using the special arrow 1-+, 
we could say also "Let f be the function x 1-+ x3 + 5." 
We would also like to be able to define a function for some numbers 
and leave it undefined for others. For instance we would like to say that 
Jx is a function (the square root function, whose value at a number x 
is the square root of that number), but we observe that a negative 
number does not have a square root. Hence it is desirable to make the 
notion of function somewhat more general by stating explicitly for what 
numbers it is defined. For instance, the square root function is defined 
only for numbers ~ O. This function is denoted by Jx. The value Jx 
is the unique number ~ 0 whose square is x. 
Thus in general, let S be a collection of numbers. By a function, 
defined on S, we mean an association, which to each number x in S 
associates a number. We call S the domain of definition of the function. 
For example, the domain of definition of the square root function is the 
collection of all numbers ~ O. 
Let us give another example of a function which is not defined for all 
numbers. Let S be the collection of all numbers :f. O. The function 
1 
f(x) =-x 
is defined for numbers x :f. 0, and is thus defined on the domain S. For 
this particular function, we have f(l) = 1, f(2) = t, f(t) = 2, and 
In practice, functions are used to denote the dependence of one quan-
tity with respect to another. 
Example. The area inside a circle of radius r is given by the formula 
Thus the area is a function of the radius r, and we can also write 
If the radius is 2, then the area inside a circle of radius 2 is given by 
A(2) = n22 = 4n. 

[I, §3] 
FUNCTIONS 
17 
Example. A car moves at a constant speed of 50 km/hr. If time is 
measured in hours, the distance traveled is a function of time, namely if 
we denote distance by s, then 
s(t) = 50t. 
The distance is the product of the speed by the time traveled. Thus after 
two hours, the distance is 
s(2) = 50 · 2 = 100 km. 
One final word before we pass to the exercises: There is no magic 
reason why we should always use the letter x to describe a function f(x). 
Thus instead of speaking of the function f(x) = 1/x we could just as well 
say f(y) = l/y or f(q) = l/q. Unfortunately, the most neutral way of 
writing would be f(blank) = 1/blank, and this is really not convenient.

I, §4. POWERS 
In this section we just summarize some elementary arithmetic. 
Let n be an integer f; 1 and let a be any number. Then a" is the 
product of a with itself n times. For example, let a = 3. If n = 2, then 
a2 = 9. If n = 3, then a3 = 27. Thus we obtain a function which is 
called the n-th power. If f denotes this function, then f(x) = x". 
We recall the rule 
for any number x and integers m, n f; 1. 
Again, let n be an integer f; 1, and let a be a positive number. We 
define al l" to be the unique positive number b such that b" = a. (That 
there exists such a unique number b is taken for granted as part of the 
properties of numbers.) We get a function called the n-th root. Thus if f 
is the 4th root, then f(16) = 2 and f(81) = 3. 
The n-th root function can also be defined at 0, the n-th root of 0 
being 0 itself. 
If a, b are two numbers f; 0 and n is an integer f; I, then 
There is another useful and elementary rule. Let m, n be integers f; 1 
and let a be a number f; O. We define ami" to be (al /")m which is also 
equal to (am)l /". This allows us to define fractional powers, and gives us 
a function 
f(x) = xm/" 
defined for x f; O. 

[I, §4] 
POWERS

We now come to powers with negative numbers or O. We want to 
define xa when a is a negative rational number or 0 and x > O. We want 
the fundamental rule 
to be true. This means that we must define XO to be 1. For instance, 
since 
we see from this example that the only way in which this equation holds 
is if 2° = 1. Similarly, in general, if the relation 
is true, then XO must be equal to 1. 
Suppose finally that a is a positive rational number, and let x be a 
number > O. We define 
Thus

We observe that in this special case, 
In general, 
We are tempted to define xa even when a is not a rational number. 
This is more subtle. For instance, it is absolutely meaningless to say that 
2J2 is the product of 2 square root of 2 times itself. The problem of 
defining 2a (or xa) when a is not rational will be postponed to a later 
chapter. Until that chapter, when we deal with such a power, we shall 
assume that there is a function, written xa, described as we have done 
above for rational numbers, and satisfying the fundamental relation

Example. We have a function f(x) = xfi defined for all x> o. It is 
actually hard to describe its values for special numbers, like 2fi. It was 
unknown for a very long time whether 2./2 is a rational number or not. 
The solution (it is not) was found only in 1927 by the mathematician 
Gelfond, who became famous for solving a problem that was known to 
be very hard. 
Warning. Do not confuse a function like x2 and a function like 2X. 
Given a number e > 0, we can view eX as a function defined for all x. (It 
will be discussed in detail in Chapter VIII.) This function is called an 
exponential function. Thus 2x and lOX are exponential functions. We 
shall select a number 
e = 2.718 ... 
and the exponential function eX as having special properties which make 
it better than any other exponential function. The meaning of our use of 
the word "better" will be explained in Chapter VIII.

Graphs and Curves 
The ideas contained in this chapter allow us to translate certain state-
ments backwards and forwards between the language of numbers and the 
language of geometry. 
It is extremely basic for what follows, because we can use our geomet-
ric intuition to help us solve problems concerning numbers and func-
tions, and conversely, we can use theorems concerning numbers and 
functions to yield results about geometry. 
II, §1. COORDINATES 
Once a unit length is selected, we can represent numbers as points on a 
line. We shall now extend this procedure to the plane, and to pairs of 
numbers. 
We visualize a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting at an 
origin O.

These lines will be called coordinate axes or simply axes.

We select a unit length and cut the horizontal line into segments of 
lengths 1, 2, 3, ... to the left and to the right, and do the same to the 
vertical line, but up and down, as indicated in the next figure. 
On the vertical line we visualize the points going below 0 as corre-
sponding to the negative integers, just as we visualized points on the left 
of the horizontal line as corresponding to negative integers. We follow 
the same idea as that used in grading a thermometer, where the numbers 
below zero are regarded as negative. See figure.

We can describe each point where two lines intersect by a pair of 
integers. Suppose that we are given a pair of integ<!rs like (1,2). We go 
to the right of the origin 1 unit and vertically up 2 units to get the point 
(1,2) which has been indicated above. We have also indicated the point 
(3,4). The diagram is just like a map. 
Furthermore, we could also use negative numbers. For instance, to 
describe the point (- 3, - 2) we go to the left of the origin 3 units and 
vertically downwards 2 units. 
There is actually no reason why we should limit ourselves to points

We have not drawn all the squares on the plane. We have drawn 
only the relevant lines to find our two points. 
In general, if we take any point P in the plane and draw the perpen-
dicular lines to the horizontal axis and to the vertical axis, we obtain 
two numbers x, y as in the figure below. 
p 
y 
x 
The perpendicular line from P to the horizontal axis determines a 
number x which is negative in the figure because it lies to the left of the 
origin. The number y determined by the perpendicular from P to the 
vertical axis is positive because it lies above the origin. 
The two 
numbers x, yare called the coordinates of the point P, and we can write 
P = (x,y). 
Every pair of numbers (x, y) determines a point of the plane. We find 
the point by going a distance x from the origin a in the horizontal 
direction and then a distance y in the vertical direction. If x is positive 
we go to the right of O. If x is negative, we go to the left of O. If y is 
positive we go vertically upwards, and if y is negative we go vertically 
downwards. The coordinates of the origin are (0,0). We usually call the 
horizontal axis the x-axis and the vertical axis the y-axis. If a point P is 
described by two numbers, say (5, -10), it is customary to call the first 
number its x-coordinate and the second number its y-coordinate. Thus 
5 is the x-coordinate, and - 10 the y-coordinate of our point. Of 
course, we could use other letters besides x and y, for instance t and s, 
or u and v.

Let f be a function. We define the graph of f to be the collection of all 
pairs of numbers (x,f(x» 
whose first coordinate is any number for 
which f is defined and whose second coordinate is the value of the 
function at the first coordinate. 
For example, the graph of the function f(x) = x 2 consists of all pairs 
(x, y) such that y = x 2• In other words, it is the collection of all pairs 
(x,x 2 ), like (1,1), (2,4), (-1,1), (-3, 9), etc. 
Since each pair of numbers corresponds to a point on the plane (once 
a system of axes and a unit length have been selected), we can view the 
graph of f as a collection of points in the plane. The graph of the 
function f(x) = x2 has been drawn in the following figure, together with 
the points which we gave above as examples.

At this stage of the game there is no other way for you to determine the 
graph of a function other than this trial and error method. Later, we 
shall develop techniques which give you greater efficiency in doing it. 
We shall now give several examples of graphs of functions which oc-
cur very frequently in the sequel. 
Example 1. Consider the function f(x) = x. The points on its graph 
are of type (x, x). The first coordinate must be equal to the second. 
Thus f{l) = 1, f( -fl) = -fl, etc. The graph looks like this: 

26 
GRAPHS AND CURVES 
[II, §2] 
Example 2. Let f(x) = - x. Its graph looks this this: 
Observe that the graphs of the preceding two functions are straight lines. 
We shall study the general case of a straight line later. 
Example 3. Let f(x) = Ixl. When x ~ 0, we know that f(x) = x. 
When x ~ 0, we know that f(x) = -x. Hence the graph of Ixl is ob-
tained by combining the preceding two, and looks like this: 
All values of f(x) are ~ 0, whether x is positive or negative. 
Example 4. There is an even simpler type of function than the ones 
we have just looked at, namely the constant functions. For instance, we 
can define a function f such that f(x) = 2 for all numbers x. In other 
words, we associate the number 2 to any number x. It is a very simple 
association, and the graph of this function is a horizontal line, intersect-
ing the vertical axis at the point (0, 2).

If we took the function f(x) = -I, then the graph would be a hori-
zontal line intersecting the vertical axis at the point (0, - I). 
In general, let c be a fixed number. The graph of any function 
f(x) = c is the horizontal line intersecting the vertical axis at the point 
(0, c). The function f(x) = c is called a constant function. 
Example 5. The last of our examples is the function f(x) = l/x (de-
fined for x # 0). By plotting a few points of the graph, you will see that 
it looks like this: 
For instance, you can plot the following points:

I/x 
As x becomes very large positive, I/x becomes very small. As x ap-
proaches 0 from the right, I/x becomes very large. A similar pheno-
menon occurs when x approaches 0 from the left; then x is negative and 
I/x is negative. Hence in that case, l/x is very large negative. 
In trying to determine how the graph of a function looks, you can 
already watch for the following: 
The points at which the graph intersects the two coordinate axes. 
What happens when x becomes very large positive and very large 
negative. 
On the whole, however, in working out the exercises, your main tech-
nique is just to plot a lot of points until it becomes clear to you what 
the graph looks like.

THE STRAIGHT LINE 
29 
II, §3. THE STRAIGHT LINE 
One of the most basic types of functions is the type whose graph repre-
sents a straight line. We have already seen that the graph of the func-
tion J(x) = x is a straight line. If we take J(x) = 2x, then the line slants 
up much more steeply, and even more so for J(x) = 3x. The graph of 
the function J(x) = 1O,OOOx would look almost vertical. In general, let a 
be a positive number #- O. Then the graph of the function 
J(x) = ax 
represents a straight line. The point (2,2a) lies on the line because 
J(2) = 2a. The point (j2, j2a) also lies on the line, and if c is any 
number, the point (c, ca) lies on the line. The (x, y) coordinates of these 
points are obtained by making a similarity transformation, starting with 
the coordinates (1, a) and multiplying them by some number c. 
We can visualize this procedure by means of similar triangles. In the 
figure below, we have a straight line. If we select a point (x, y) on the 
line and drop the perpendicular from this point to the x-axis, we obtain 
a right triangle. 
If x is the length of the base of the smaller triangle in the figure, and y 
its height, and if cx is the length of the base of the bigger triangle, then 
cy is the height of the bigger triangle: The smaller triangle is similar to 
the bigger one. 
If a is a number < 0, then the graph of the function J(x) = ax is also 
a straight line, which slants up to the left. For instance, the graphs of 
J(x) = -x 
or 
J(x) = -2x. 
We now give examples of more general lines, not passing through the 
origin. 
Example 1. Let g(x) = 2x + 1. When x = 0, then g(x) = 1. When 
g(x) = 0, then x = -to The graph looks as on the following figure. 

30 
GRAPHS AND CURVES 
[II, §3] 
Example 2. 
Let g(x) = - 2x - 5. 
When x = 0, then g(x) = - 5. 
When q(x) = 0, then x = -l The graph looks like this: 
y = -2x-5 
We shall frequently speak of a function f(x) = ax + b as a straight 
line (although of course, it is its graph which is a straight line). 
The number a which is the coefficient of x is called the slope of the 
line. It determines how much the line is slanted. As we have already 
seen in examples, when the slope is positive, the line is slanted to the 
right, and when the slope is negative, the line is slanted to the left. The 
relationship Y = ax + b is also called the equation of the line. It gives us 
the relation between the x- and y-coordinates of a point on the line. 
Let f(x) = ax + b be a straight line, and let (XI' YI) and (X2' Y2) be 
two points of the line. It is easy to find the slope of the line in terms of 
the coordinates of these two points. By definition, we know that 
YI = aX I + b 
and 
Y2 = aX2 + b. 
Subtracting, we get 
Consequently, if the two points are distinct, X 2 -# XI' then we can divide 
by X 2 -
XI and obtain 
slope of line = a = Y2 - YI . 
X2 -
XI 

[II, §3] 
THE STRAIGHT LINE 
31 
This formula gives us the slope in terms of the coordinates of two dis-
tinct points on the line. 
Geometrically, our quotient 
is simply the ratio of the vertical side and horizontal side of the triangle 
in the next diagram: 
: 
-::::~'(-" 
:~X2-X,-~ 
I 
In general, let a be a number, and (Xl' Yl) some point. 
We wish to find the equation of the line having slope equal to a, and 
passing through the point (Xl' Yl). 
The condition that a point (x, y) with X =1= Xl be on this line is equiva-
lent with the condition that 
Y - Yl 
-- =a. 
X-Xl 
Thus the equation of the desired line is 
Y2 - Y.

GRAPHS AND CURVES 
[II, §3] 
Example 3. Let (1,2) and (2, -1) be the two points. What is the 
slope of the line between them? What is the equation of the line? 
We first find the slope. We have: 
Y -y 
-1-2 
slope = 
2 
I = 
= _ 3. 
X2 -X I 
2 - 1 
The line must pass through the given point (1,2). Hence its equation is 
y - 2 = -3(x - 1). 
This is a correct answer. Sometimes it may be useful to put the equation 
in the form 
Y = -3x + 5, 
but it is equally valid to leave it in the first form. 
Observe that it does not matter which point we call (Xl' Yl) and 
which we call (X2, Y2). We would get the same answer for the slope. 
We can also determine the equation of a line provided we know the 
slope and one point. 
Example 4. Find the equation of the line having slope -7 and pass-
ing through the point (- 1, 2). 
The equation is 
Y - 2 = -7(x + 1). 
Example 5. In general, let (Xl' Yl) and (x 2, Y2) be two distinct points 
with Xl # X 2 • We wish to find the equation of the line passing through 
these two points. Its slope must then be equal to 
Therefore the equation of the line can be expressed by the formula 
Y - Yl = Y2 - Yl 
X -

for all points (x, y) such that X # Xl' or for all points by 
Finally, we should mention vertical lines. These cannot be represented 
by equations of type Y = ax + b. Suppose that we have a vertical line 

[II, §3] 
THE STRAIGHT LINE 
33 
intersecting the x-axis at the point (2,0). The y-coordinate of any point 
on the line can be arbitrary. Thus the equation of the line is simply 
x = 2. In general, the equation of the vertical line intersecting the x-axis 
at the point (c,O) is x = c. 
We can find the point of intersection of two lines by solving simultan-
eously two linear equations. 
Example 6. Find the point of intersection of the two lines 
y = 3x - 5 
and 
y = -4x + 1. 
We solve 
3x - 5 = -4x + 1

We can then make up a right triangle. By the Pythagoras theorem, the 
length of the line segment joining our two points can be determined 
from the lengths of the two sides. The square of the bottom side is 
(X2 -
XI)2, which is equal to (Xl -
X2)2. 
The square of the length of the vertical side is (Y2 - Yl)2, which is 
equal to (Yl - Y2)2. If L denotes the length of the line segment, then by 
Pythagoras,

II, §5. CURVES AND EQUATIONS 
Let F(x, y) be an expression involving a pair of numbers (x, y). Let c be 
a number. We consider the equation 
F(x, y) = c. 
Definition. The graph of the equation is the collection of points (a, b) 
in the plane satisfying the equation, that is such that 
F(a, b) = c 

36 
GRAPHS AND CURVES 
[II, §6] 
This graph is also known as a curve, and we will usually not make a 
distinction between the equation 
F(x, y) = c 
and the curve which represents the equation. 
For example, 
x+y=2 
is the equation of a straight line, and its graph is the straight line. We 
shall study below important examples of equations which arise fre-
quently. 
If I is a function, then we can form the expression y - I(x), and the 
graph of the equation 
y - I(x) = 0 
is none other than the graph of the function I as we discussed it in §2. 
You should observe that there are equations of type 
F(x, y) = c 
which are not obtained from a function y = I(x), i.e. from an equation 
y - I(x) = o. 
For instance, the equation x 2 + i = 1 is such an equation. 
We shall now study important examples of graphs of equations 
F(x, y) = 0 
or 
F(x, y) = c. 
II, §6. THE CIRCLE 
The expression F(x, y) = x2 + i has a simple geometric interpretation. 
By Pythagoras' theorem, it is the square of the distance of the point 
(x, y) from the origin (0,0). Thus the points (x, y) satisfying the equation 
x 2 + i = 12 = 1 
are simply those points whose distance from the origin is 1. They form 
the circle of radius 1, with center at the origin. 
Similarly, the points (x, y) satisfying the equation 

[II, §6] 
THE CIRCLE 
37 
are those points whose distance from the origin is 2. They constitute the 
circle of radius 2. In general, if c is any number > 0, then the graph of 
the equation 
is the circle of radius c, with center at the origin. 
We have already remarked that the equation 
or x 2 + /- 1 = 0 is not of the type y - f(x) = O. However, we can 
write our equation in the form 
For any value of x between - 1 and + 1, we can solve for y and get 
y=F-7 
or 
y=-~. 
If x -:f. 1 and x -:f. -1, then we get two values of y for each value of x. 
Geometrically, these two values correspond to the points indicated on 
the following diagram. 
- VI-x2 ) 
There is a function, defined for -1 ~ x ~ 1, such that 
f(x)=~, 
and the graph of this function is the upper half of our circle. Similarly, 
there is another function 
g(x) = -~, 
also defined for - 1 ~ x ~ 1, whose graph is the lower half of the circle. 
Neither of these functions is defined for other values of x. 
We now ask for the equation of the circle whose center is (1,2) and 
whose radius has length 3. It consists of the points (x, y) whose distance 
from (1,2) is 3. These are the points satisfying the equation 
(x -
1)2 + (y - 2)2 = 9.

The graph of this equation has been drawn above. We may also put 
x' = x-I 
and 
y'=y-2 
In the new coordinate system (x', y') the equation of the circle is then 
We have drawn the (x', y')-axes as dotted lines in the figure. 
To pick another example, we wish to determine those points at a 
distance 2 from the point (-1, - 3). They are the points (x, y) satisfying 
the equation 
(x - (_1»2 + (y - (- 3»2 = 4 
or, in other words, 
(x + 1)2 + (y + 3)2 = 4. 
(Observe carefully the cancellation of minus signs!) Thus the graph of 
this equation is the circle of radius 2 and center ( - 1, - 3). 
In general, let a, b be two numbers and r a number> o. Then the 
circle of radius r and center (a, b) is the graph of the equation 
We may put 
x' = x -
a 
and 
y' = y - h. 
Then in the new coordinates x', y' the equation of the circle is

Completing the square 
Example. Suppose we are given an equation 
x2 + i + 2x - 3 y - 5 = 0, 
where x2 and i occur with the same coefficient 1. We wish to see that 
this is the equation of a circle, and we use the method of completing the 
square, which we now review. 
We want the equation to be of the form 
because then we know immediately that it represents a circle centered at 
(a, b) and of radius r. Thus we need x 2 + 2x to be the first two terms of 
the expansion 
Similarly, we need y2 - 3y to be the first two terms of the expansion 
This means that a = - 1 and b = 3/2. Then

x + 2x + y - 3y - 5 = (x + 1) - 1 + y - 2 - 4 - 5.

II, §7. DILATIONS AND THE ELLIPSE 
Dilations 
[II, §7] 
Before studying the ellipse, we have to make some remarks on "stretch-
ing," or to use a more standard word, dilations. 
Let (x, y) be a point in the plane. Then (2x,2y) is the point obtained 
by stretching both its coordinates by a factor of 2, as illustrated on 
Fig. 1, where we have also drawn (3x,3y) and (t, h).

Figure I 
Definition. In general, if c > 0 is a positive number, we call (cx, cy) 
the dilation of (x, y) by a factor c. 
Example. Let 
be the equation of the circle of radius 1. Put 
x = cu 
and 
y = cv. 
Then 
u = x/c 
and 
v = y/c. 

[II, §7] 
DILATIONS AND THE ELLIPSE 
41 
Hence x and y satisfy the equation 
or equivalently, 
The set of points (x, y) satisfying this equation is the circle of radius c. 
Thus we may say: 
The dilation of the circle of radius 1 by a factor of c > 0 is the circle 
of radius c. 
This is illustrated on Fig. 2, with c = 3. 
Figure 2 
The Ellipse 
There is no reason why we should dilate the first and second coordinates 
by the same factor. We may use different factors. For instance, if we put 
x = 2u 
and 
y = 3v 
we are dilating the first coordinate by a factor of 2, and we are dilating 
the second coordinate by a factor of 3. In that case, suppose that (u, v) 
is a point on the circle of radius 1, in other words suppose we have 
Then (x, y) satisfies the equation

If (u, v) satisfies

then (x, y) satisfies

x = au 
and 
y = bv. 
Conversely, we may put u = xla and v = ylb to see that the points sat-
isfying equation (*) correspond to the points of (**) under this transfor-
mation, and vice versa. 
Definition. An ellipse is the set of points satisfying an equation (**) in 
some coordinate system of the plane. We have just seen that an ellipse 
is a dilated circle, by means of a dilation by factors a, b > 0 in the first 
and second coordinates respectively.

A parabola is a curve which is the graph of a function 
in some coordinate system, with a =1= O.

Example. We have already seen what the graph of the function 
y = x 2 looks like. Consider now 
Then by symmetry, you can easily see that the graph looks as on the 
figure.

Suppose that we graph the equation y = (x -
1)2. We shall find that 
it looks exactly the same, but as if the origin were placed at the point 
(I, 0). 
Similarly, the curve y - 2 = (x - 4)2 looks again like y = x 2 except 
that the whole curve has been moved as if the origin were the point 
(4,2). The graphs of these equations have been drawn on the next dia-
gram.

We can formalize these remarks as follows. Suppose that in our given 
coordinate system we pick a point (a, b) as a new origin. We let new 
coordinates be x' = x - a and y' = y - b. Thus when x = a we have 
x' = 0 and when y = b we have y' = o. If we have a curve 
in the new coordinate system whose origin is at the point (a, b), then it 
gives rise to the equation 
(y -
b) = (x - a)2 
in terms of the old coordinate system. This type of curve is known as a 
parabola. 
We can apply the same technique of completing the square that we 
did for the circle. 
Example. What is the graph of the equation 
2y - x 2 -
4x + 6 = O? 
Completing the square, we can write 
x2 + 4x = (x + 2)2 - 4. 
Thus our equation can be rewritten 
2y = (x + 2)2 -
10 
or 
2(y + 5) = (x + 2)2. 
We choose a new coordinate system 
x' = x + 2

y'=y+5

We remark that if we have an equation 
x-/ =0 
then we get a parabola which is tilted horizontally. 
We can then apply the technique of changing the coordinate system to 
see what the graph of a more general equation is like. 
Example. Sketch the graph of 
x - / + 2y + 5 = o. 
We can write this equation in the form 
(x + 6) = (y -

and hence its graph looks like this:

with a '" O. We wish to determine where this parabola intersects the 
x-axis. These are the values for which f(x) = 0 and are called the roots 
of f It is shown in high school that the roots of f are given by the 
quadratic formula:

You should read this formula out loud enough times so that it is mem-
orized, just like the multiplication table. It should be used automatically, 
without further thinking, to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

The discussion of the quadratic formula in this section illustrates some 
general pedagogical principles concerning the relationship of rote memor-
ization and the role of proofs in learning mathematics. 
1. You should memorize the quadratic formula aurally: 
x equals minus b plus or minus square root of b s,quare minus 4ac 
over 2a 
as you would memorize a poem, by repeating it out loud. Such memor-
izing is necessary for a few important items in basic math, to induce 
getting the right answer as a conditioned reflex, without wasting any 
time. 
2. Independently of using the formula as a conditioned reflex, you 
should see the proof by completing the square. Learning to handle logic 
and the English language in establishing theorems is also part of mathe-
matics. In addition, the technique of completing th~ square arises often 
in the context of graphing circles, ellipses, parabolas, in addition to the 
quadratic formula. Knowing the formula as a conditioned reflex and 
knowing the proof serve two different complementary functions in mathe-
matical training, neither of which eliminates the other.

II, §9. THE HYPERBOLA 
We have already seen what the graph of the equation 
xy = 1 
or 
y = l/x 
looks like. It is of course the same as the graph of the function 
f(x) = l/x 
(defined for x =I 0). If we pick a coordinate system whose origin is at the 
point (a, b), the equation 
1 
y-b=--
x-a 
is known as a hyperbola. In terms of the new coordinate system 
x' = x - a 
and y' = y - b, our hyperbola has the old type of equation 
X'y' = 1. 
If we are given an equation like 
xy - 2x + 3y = 1 

52 
GRAPHS AND CURVES 
[II, §9] 
we want to put this equation in the form 
(x - a)(y - b) = c, 
or expanding out, 
xy - ay - bx + ab = c. 
This tells us what a and b must be. Thus 
xy - 2x + 3y = (x + 3)(y - 2) + 6. 
Hence xy - 2x + 3y = t is equivalent with 
(x + 3)(y - 2) + 6 = 1 
or in other words 
(x + 3)(y - 2) = - 5. 
The graph of this equation has been drawn on the following diagram.

The graph has symmetry, because if (x, y) is a point on the graph then 
(-x, y), (x, - y) and (-x, - y) is also a point on the graph. So let us 
look at the graph in the first quadrant when x ;?; 0 and y ;?; O. 
Since x2 - 1 = y2, it follows that x2 - 1 ;?; 0 so x2 ;?; 1. Hence the 
graph exists only for x ;?; 1. We claim that it looks like this in the first 
quadrant.

To see this, we could of course make a table of a few values first, to see 
experimentally what the graph is like. Do this yourself. Here we de-
scribe it theoretically. 
As x increases, the expression x 2 -
1 increases, so p-=l increases. 
Thus y also increases. 
Also, since y2 = x2 - 1 it follows that y2 < x2 so Y < x for x, y in the 
first quadrant. We have drawn the line y = x. The set of points with 
y < x lies below this line in the first quadrant. 
Let us divide the equation y2 = x2 - 1 by x 2. We obtain 
When x becomes large, then

The ratio y/x is the slope of the line from the origin to the point (x, y). 
Hence this slope approaches I when x becomes large. Also from the 
expression 
y = p-=l, 

54 
GRAPHS AND CURVES 
[II, §9] 
we see that when x is large, x 2 -
1 is nearly equal to x 2, and so its 
square root is nearly equal to x. Thus the graph of the hyperbola comes 
closer and closer to the graph of the line y = x. This justifies drawing 
this graph as we have done.

Part Two 
Differentiation and 
Elementary Functions 
In this part, we learn how to differentiate. Geometrically speaking, this 
amounts to finding the slope of a curve, or its rate of change. We 
analyze systematically the techniques for doing this, and how they apply 
to the elementary functions: polynomials, trigonometric functions, expo-
nential and logarithmic functions, and inverse functions. 
One of the reasons why we postpone integration till after this section 
is that the techniques of integration, up to a point, depend on our know-
ing the derivatives of certain functions, because one of the properties of 
integration is that it is the inverse operation to differentiation. 
You will find applied rate problems similar to each other, but with 
different types of functions in Chapter III, §9, Chapter IV, §4, and 
Chapter VII, §4. This is an example of seeing the same idea threaded in 
a coherent manner through the part on differentiation. 

CHAPTER 
III 
The Derivative 
The two fundamental notions of this course are those of the derivative 
and the integral. We take up the first one in this chapter. 
The derivative will give us the slope of a curve at a point. It has also 
applications to physics, where it can be interpreted as the rate of change. 
We shall develop some basic techniques which will allow you to com-
pute the derivative in all the standard situations which you are likely to 
encounter in practice. 
III, §1. THE SLOPE OF A CURVE 
Consider a curve, and take a point P on the curve. We wish to define 
the notions of slope of the curve at that point, and tangent line to the 
curve at that point. Sometimes the statement is made that the tangent to 
the curve at the point is the line which touches the curve only at that 
point. This is pure nonsense, as the subsequent pictures will convince 
you. 
Consider a straight line: 
Don't you want to say that the line is tangent to itself? If yes, then this 

58 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, § IJ 
certainly contradicts that the tangent is the line which touches the curve 
at only one point, since the line touches itself at all of its points. 
In Figs, 1, 2, and 3, we look at the tangent line to the curve at the 
point P. In Fig. 1 the line cuts the curve at the other point Q. In Fig. 2 
the line is also tangent to the curve at the point Q. In Fig. 3, the 
Q 
Figure I 
Figure 2 
Figure 3 
horizontal line is tangent to the curve and "cuts" the curve. The vertical 
line and the slanted line intersect the curve in only one point, but are 
not tangent. 
Observe also that you cannot get out of the difficulties by trying to 
distinguish a line "cutting", the curve, or "touching the curve," or by 
saying that the line should lie on one side of the curve (cf. Fig. 1). 
We therefore have to give up the idea of touching the curve only at 
one point, and look for another idea. 
We have to face two problems. One of them is to give the correct 
geometric idea which allows us to define the tangent to the curve, and 
the other is to test whether this idea allows us to compute effectively this 
tangent line when the curve is given by a simple equation with numerical 
coefficients. It is a remarkable thing that our solution of the first prob-
lem will in fact give us a solution to the second. 
In Chapter II, we have seen that knowing the slope of a straight line 
and one point on the straight line allows us to determine the equation of 
the line. We shall therefore define the slope of a curve at a point and 
then get its tangent afterward by using the method of Chapter II. 
Our examples show us that to define the slope of the curve at P, we 

[III, §1] 
THE SLOPE OF A CURVE 
59 
should not consider what happens at a point Q which is far removed 
from P. Rather, it is what happens near P which is important. 
Let us therefore take any point Q on the given curve y = I(x), and 
assume that Q #- P. Then the two points P, Q determine a straight line 
with a certain slope which depends on P, Q and which we shall write as 
S(P, Q). Suppose that the point Q approaches the point P on the curve 
(but stays distinct from Pl. Then, as Q comes near P, the slope S(P, Q) 
of the line passing through P and Q should approach the (unkown) 
slope of the (unknown) tangent line to the curve at P. In the following 
diagram, we have drawn the tangent line to the curve at P and two lines 
between P and another point on the curve close to P (Fig. 4). The point 
Figure 4 
Q2 is closer to P on the curve and so the slope of the line between P 
and Q2 is closer to the slope of the tangent line than is the slope of the 
line between P and Q l' 
If the limit of the slope S(P, Q) exists as Q approaches P, then it 
should be regarded as the slope of the curve itself at P. This is the basic 
idea behind our definition of the slope of the curve at P. We take it as 
a definition, perhaps the most important definition in this book. To 
repeat: 
Definition. Given a curve y = I(x), let P be a point on the curve. 
The slope of the curve at P is the limit of the slopes of lines through P 
and another point Q on the curve, as Q approaches P. 
The idea of defining the slope in this manner was discovered in the 
seventeenth century by Newton and Leibnitz. We shall see that this 
definition allows us to determine the slope effectively in practice. 
First we observe that when y = ax + b is a straight line, then the 
slope of the line between any two distinct points on the curve is always 
the same, and is the slope of the line as we defined it in the preceding 
chapter. 
Example. Let us now look at the next simplest example, 
We wish to determine the slope of this curve at the point (1, 1). 

60 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §1] 
We look at a point near (1, 1), for instance a point whose x-coordin-
ate is 1.1. Then /(1.1) = (1.l)2 = 1.21. Thus the point (l.l, 1.21) lies on 
the curve. The slope of the line between two points (Xl' Yl) and (X2' Y2) 
is 
Therefore the slope of the line between (1, 1) and (1.1, 1.21) is 
1.21 - 1 = 0.21 = 2 
1.1 - 1 
0.1 
.1. 
In general, the x-coordinate of a point near (1, 1) can be written 
1 + h, where h is some small number, positive or negative, but h =1= O. 
We have 
f(l + h) = (1 + h)2 = 1 + 2h + h2. 
(l+h, l+2h+h2) 
Figure 5 
Thus the point (1 + h, 1 + 2h + h2) lies on the curve. When h is posi-
tive, the line between our two points would look like that in Fig. 5. 
When h is negative, then 1 + h is smaller than 1 and the line would look 
like this: 
Figure 6 

[III, §1] 
THE SLOPE OF A CURVE 
61 
For instance, h could be -0.1 and 1 + h = 0.9. 
The slope of the line between our two points is therefore the quotient 
(1 + 2h + h2) - 1 
(l + h) -
1 
which is equal to 
2h + h2 = 2 
h 
h 
+ . 
As the point whose x-coordinate is 1 + h approaches our point (1, 1), the 
number h approaches O. As h approaches 0, the slope of the line between 
our two points approaches 2, which is therefore the slope of the curve at 
the point (1, 1) by definition. 
You will appreciate how simple the computation turns out to be, and 
how easy it was to get this slope! 
Let us take another example. We wish to find the slope of the same 
curve f(x) = x 2 at the point (- 2, 4). Again we take a nearby point 
whose x-coordinate is - 2 + h for small h -# O. The y-coordinate of this 
nearby point is 
f( -2 + h) = (-2 + h)2 = 4 - 4h + h2. 
The slope of the line between the two points is therefore 
4 - 4h + h2 - 4 
-2+h-(-2) 
-4h+h2 
h 
h 
= -4 + . 
As h approaches 0, the nearby point approaches the point (- 2,4) and 
we see that the slope approaches - 4. 
III, §1. EXERCISES

1. Y = 2x 2 at the point (1, 2) 
3. Y = 2x - 7 at the point (2, -3)

8. Y = x2 at the point (3, 9)

11. Y = 2x + 3 at the point whose x-coordinate is 2.

THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §2] 
12. Y = 3x - 5 at the point whose x-coordinate is 1. 
13. y = ax + b at an arbitrary point. 
(In Exercises 11, 12, 13 use the h-method, and verify that this method gives the 
same answer for the slope as that stated in Chapter II, §3.) 
III, §2. THE DERIVATIVE 
We continue to consider the function y = x2• Instead of picking a defin-
ite numerical value for the x-coordinate of a point, we could work at an 
arbitrary point on the curve. Its coordinates are then (x, x 2 ). We write 
the x-coordinate of a point nearby as x + h for some small h, positive or 
negative, but h #- 0. The y-coordinate of this nearby point is 
Hence the slope of the line between them is 
(x + h)2 - x 2 
(x + h) - x 
x 2 + 2xh + h2 -
x 2 
x+h-x 
2xh + h2 
h 
= 2x + h. 
As h approaches 0, 2x + h approaches 2x. Consequently, the slope of 
the curve y = x 2 at an arbitrary point (x, y) is 2x. In particular, when 
x = 1 the slope is 2 and when x = - 2 the slope is - 4, as we found out 
before by the explicit computation using the special x-coordinates 1 and 
-2. 
This time, however, we have found out a general formula giving us 
the slope for any point on the curve. Thus when x = 3 the slope is 6 
and when x = - 10 the slope is - 20. 
The example we have just worked out gives us the procedure for 
treating more general functions. 
Given a function f(x), we let the Newton quotient be 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
f(x + h) - f(x)

Thus the two expressions f'(x) and dfldx mean the same thing. We 
emphasize however that in the expression dfldx we do not multiply f or 
x by d or divide df by dx. The expression is to be read as a whole. We 
shall find out later that the expression, under certain circumstances, be-
haves as if we were dividing, and it is for this reason that we adopt this 
classical way of writing the derivative. 
The derivative may thus be viewed as a function 1', which is defined 
at all numbers x such that the Newton quotient approaches a limit as h 
tends to O. Observe that when taking the limit, both the numerator 
f(x + h) - f(x) and the denominator h approaches O. However, their 
quotient 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
h 
approaches the slope of the curve at the point (x,f(x».

THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §2] 
Definition. The function f is differentiable if it has a derivative at all 
the points for which it is defined. 
Example 1. The function f(x) = x2 is differentiable and its derivative 
is 2x. Thus we have in this case 
f'(x) = ix = 2x. 
We have been using systematically the letter x. One can use any 
other letter: The truth of mathematical statements is invariant under per-
mutations of the alphabet. Thus, for instance, if f(u) = u2 then 
f'(u) = du = 2u. 
What is important here is that the same letter u should occur in each 
one of these places, and that the letter u should be different from the 
letter f 
We work out some examples before giving you exercises on this sec-
tion. 
Example 2. Let f(x) = 2x + 1. Find the derivative f'(x). 
We form the Newton quotient. We have f(x + h) = 2(x + h) + 1. 
Thus 
f(x + h) - f(x) = 2x + 2h + 1 - (2x + 1) = 2h = 2. 
h

As h approaches 0 (which we write also h --+ 0), this Newton quotient is 
equal to 2 and hence the limit is 2. Thus 
df 
f'

= 
(x) = 
dx 
for all values of x. The derivative is constant. 
Example 3. Find the slope of the graph of the function f(x) = 2X2 at 
the point whose x-coordinate is 3, and find the equation of the tangent 
line at that point. 
We may just as well find the slope at an arbitrary point on the graph. 
It is the derivative f'(x). We have 
f(x + h) = 2(x + h)2 = 2(x2 + 2xh + h2). 

[III, §2] 
THE DERIVATIVE 
The Newton quotient is 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
h 
2(x2 + 2xh + h2) - 2x2 
h 
4xh + 2h2 
= 
h 
= 4x + 2h. 
Hence by definition 
1'(x) = lim(4x + 2h) = 4x. 
h~O 
Thus 1'(x) = 4x. At the point x = 3 we get 
1'(3) = 12, 
which is the desired slope. 
65 
As for the equation of the tangent line, when x = 3 we have f(3) = 18. 
Hence we must find the equation of the line passing through the point 
(3, 18), having slope 12. This is easy, namely the equation is 
y - 18 = 12(x - 3). 
Remark on notation. In the preceding example, we have 
f = 4x = 1'(x). 
We wanted the derivative when x = 3. Here we see the advantage of the 
1'(x) notation instead of the df jdx notation. We can substitute 3 for x 
in 1'(x) to write 
1'(3) = 12. 
We cannot substitute 3 for x in the djjdx notation, because writing 
df 
d3 
would be very confusing. If we want to use the dfldx notation in such a 
context, we would have to use some device like writing 
dx 
at x = 3 is equal to 
12

Still, it is clearly better to use the f'(x) notation in such a context. 
Example 4. Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = 2X2 
at the point whose x-coordinate is - 2. 
In the preceding example we have computed the general formula for 
the slope of the tangent line. It is 
f'(x) = 4x. 
At the point x = - 2 the slope is therefore 
f'( -2) = -8. 
On the other hand, f( -2) = 8. Hence the equation of the tangent line is 
y - 8 = - 8(x + 2). 
Example 5. Find the derivative of f(x) = x 3• We use the Newton 
quotient, and first write down its numerator: 
Then 
f(x + h) - f(x) = (x + h)3 - x 3 
= x 3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3 - x 3 
= 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3. 
f(x + h) - f(x)

h 
=X+X+. 
As h approaches 0 the right-hand side approaches 3x2, so 
d(x 3) _ 3 2 
dx -
x. 
In defining the Newton quotient, we can take h positive or negative. 
It is sometimes convenient when taking the limit to look only at values 
of h which are positive. We are then looking only at points on the curve 
which approach the given point from the right. In this manner we get 
what is called the right derivative. If in taking the limit of the Newton 
quotient we took only negative values for h, we would get the left deriva-
tive. 

[III, §2] 
THE DERIVATIVE 
67 
Example 6. Let f(x) = Ix!. Find its right derivative and its left deri-
vative when x = O. 
The right derivative is the limit

The limit as h -+ 0 and h > 0 is therefore 1. 
The left derivative is the limit

When h < 0 we have 
f(O + h) = f(h) = -h. 
Hence 
f(O + h) - f(O) 
-h 
h 
=h=-1. 
The limit as h -+ 0 and h < 0 is therefore - 1. 
We see that the right derivative at 0 is 1 and the left derivative is - 1. 
They are not equal. This is illustrated by the graph of our function 
f(x ) = lxi, 
which looks like that in Fig. 7. 
Both the right derivative of f and the left derivative of f exist but they 
are not equal. 
We can rephrase our definition of the derivative and say that the 
derivative of a function f(x) is defined when the right derivative and the 
left derivative exist and they are equal, in which case this common value 
is simply called the derivative.

Thus the derivative of f(x) = Ixl is not defined at x = o. 
Example 7. 
Let f(x) be equal to x if 0 < x ;::; 1 and x -
I if 
I < x ;::; 2. We do not define f for other values of x. Then the graph of 
f looks like this: 
Figure 8 
The left derivative of f at I exists and is equal to 1, but the right 
derivative of f at 1 does not exist. We leave the verification of the first 
assertion to you. To verify the second assertion, we must see whether 
the limit

h> 0 
exists. Since I + h > 1 we have 
f(l + h) = I + h - 1 = h. 
Also f(l) = 1. Thus the Newton quotient is 
f(l +h)-f(l) h-I 
I 
h 
=-h-= I-h· 
As h approaches 0 the quotient l/h has no limit since it becomes arbi-
trarily large. Thus the Newton quotient has no limit for h > 0 and the 
function does not have a right derivative when x = 1.

In defining the slope of a curve at a point, or the derivative, we used the 
notion of limit, which we regarded as intuitively clear. It is indeed. You 
can see in the Appendix at the end of Part Four how one may define 
limits using only properties of numbers, but we do not worry about this 
here. However, we shall make a list of the properties of limits which will 
be used in the sequel, just to be sure of what we assume about them, 
and also to give you a technique for computing limits. 
We consider functions F(h) defined for all sufficiently small values of 
h, except that h =F O. We write 
lim F(h) = L 
h-O 
to mean that F(h) approaches L as h approaches o. 
First, we note that if F is a constant function, F(x) = c for all x, then 
lim F(h) = c 
h-O 
is the constant itself. 
If F(h) = h, then 
lim F(h) = o. 
h-O 
The next properties relate limits with addition, subtraction, multiplica-
tion, division, and inequalities. 
Suppose that we have two functions F(x) and G(x) which are defined 
for the same numbers. Then we can form the sum of the two functions 

70 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III,§3] 
F + G, whose value at a point x is F(x) + G(x). Thus when F(x) = X4 
and G(x) = 5X 3/ 2 we have 
The value F(x) + G(x) is also written (F + G)(x). The first property of 
limits concerns the sum of two functions. 
Property 1. Suppose that we have two functions F and G defined for 
small values of h, and assume that the limits 
lim F(h) 
and 
lim G(h) 
h~O 
exist. Then 
lim[F(h) + G(h)] 
h~O 
exists and 
lim(F + G)(h) = lim F(h) + lim G(h). 
In other words the limit of a sum is equal to the sum of the limits. 
A similar statement holds for the difference F - G, namely 
lim (F(h) - G(h» = lim F(h) - lim G(h). 
After the sum we discuss the product. Suppose we have two functions 
F and G defined for the same numbers. Then we can form their product 
FG whose value at a number x is 
(FG)(x) = F(x)G(x). 
For instance if F(x) = 2X2 - 2X and G(x) = x 2 + 5x, then the product is 
(FG)(x) = (2X2 - 2x)(X2 + 5x). 
Property 2. Let F, G be two functions for small values of h, and as-
sume that 
lim F(h) 
and 
lim G(h) 
h~O 
h~O 
exist. Then the limit of the product exists and we have 
lim(FG)(h) = lim[F(h)G(h)] 
h~O 
h~O 
= lim F(h) ·lim G(h). 
h~O 
h~O 

[III, §3] 
LIMITS 
71 
In words, we can say that the product of the limits is equal to the limit 
of the product. 
As a special case, suppose that F(x) is the constant function F(x) = c. 
Then we can form the function cG, product of the constant by G, and 
we have 
lim cG(h) = c . lim G(h). 
Example. Let F(h) = 3h + 5. Then lim F(h) = 5. 
h-O 
Example. Let F(h) = 4h 3 -
5h + 1. Then lim F(h) = 1. We can see 
this by considering the limits 
lim 4h 3 = 0, 
lim 5h = 0, 
lim 1 = 1, 
h-O 
h-O 
h-O 
and taking the appropriate sum. 
Example. We have lim 3xh = 0, and 
h-O 
lim(3xh - 7y) = - 7y. 
h-O 
Thirdly, we come to quotients. Let F, G be as before, but assume that 
G(x) =I ° 
for any x. Then we can form the quotient function FIG whose 
value at x is 
F 
F(x) 
G (x) = G(x)· 
Example. Let F(x) = 2x 3 -
4x and G(x) = X4 + Xl/3. Then

F(x) 
2x 3 -

G (x) = G(x) = X4 + Xl/3"

exist, and that 
lim G(h) =1= O. 
h-O 
Then the limit of the quotient exists and we have 
lim F(h) = lim F(h) 
h-O G(h) 
lim G(h)" 
[III, §3] 
In words, the quotient of the limits is equal to the limit of the quotient. 
As we have done above, we shall sometimes omit writing h -+ 0 for the 
sake of simplicity. 
The next property is stated here for completeness. It will not be used 
until we find the derivative of sine and cosine, and consequently should 
be skipped until then. 
Property 4. Let F, G be two functions defined for small values of h, and 
assume that G(h) ~ F(h). Assume also that 
lim F(h) 
and 
lim G(h) 
h-O 
h-O 
exist. Then 
lim G(h) ~ lim F(h).

G(h) ~ E(h) ~ F(h)

exists and is equal to the limits of F and G. 
Property 5 is known as the squeezing process. You will find many 
applications of it in the sequel.

The numerator of our quotient approaches 3 when h --+ 0 and the 
denominator approaches x 2• Thus the quotient approaches 3/x 2• We 
can justify these steps more formally by applying our three properties. 
For instance: 
lim(2xh + 3) = lim(2xh) + lim 3 
For the denominator, we have 
= lim(2x) lim(h) + lim 3 
=2x ·0+3 
= 3. 
lim(x2 - 4h) = lim x 2 + lim( -4h) 
= x 2 + lim( -4) lim(h) 
=x2+(-4)·0 
Using the rule for the quotient, we see that the desired limit is equal to 
3/x 2• 
Example. In the previous examples, it turns out that we could substi-
tute the value 0 for h and find the appropriate limit. This cannot be 
done in general. For instance, suppose that we want to find the limit 
If we substitute h = 0 we get a meaningless expression 0/0, and hence we 
do not get information on the limit. However, for h -=f. 0 we can cancel h 
from the quotient, and we see that 
h(h - 1) _ _ h _- _l 
h(h2 + 2)

[III, §3] 
From the expression on the right we can determine the limit. Indeed, 
h - 1 approaches - 1 as h approaches O. Also, h2 + 2 approaches 2 as h 
approaches O. Hence by the rule for quotients of limits, we conclude that

it is -to

In this case, we can factor h from the numerator and denominator, so 
that the quotient is equal to 
The numerator is now seen to approach 0 and the denominator ap-
proaches 3x - 1 as h approaches O. Hence the quotient approaches O. 
This is the desired limit. 
The properties of limits which we have stated above will allow you 
to compute limits in determining derivatives. We illustrate this by an 
example.

We have seen that the derivative of the function x2 is 2x.

Using the properties of limits of sums and products, we see that 3x2

f'(x) = lim f(x + h) - f(x) = 3x2. 
h-O

This suggests that in general, whenever f(x) = x" for some positive 
integer n, the derivative f'(x) should be nx"-I. This is indeed the case, 
and will be proved in the next theorem. The proof will follow the same 
pattern as in the case f(x) = x 3 above. You should work out the case 
f(x) = X4 and probably also the case f(x) = x 5 in detail (these were 
exercises for the preceding sectiol.) in order to confirm in these special 
cases that the pattern remains the same, before seeing the general case. 
Note that when we treated f(x) = x 3 we obtained an expression for the 
Newton quotient which had a numerator 
contammg the term 3x 2h, and another term containing h2 as a factor. 
When we divide by h, 3x2 yields the value of the derivative, and the 
remaining term h(3x + h) still contains h as a factor, and consequently 
approaches 0 as h approaches O. You will find explicitly a similar phe-
nomenon for X4 and x 5.

77 
Proof We have 
f(x + h) = (x + h)" = (x + h)(x + h)···(x + h), 
the product being taken n times. Selecting x from each factor gives us a 
term x". If we take x from all but one factor and h from the remaining 
factors, we get hx" - 1 taken n times. This gives us a term nx" - 1 h. All 
other terms will involve selecting h from at least two factors, and the 
corresponding terms will be divisible by h2 • Thus we get 
f(x + h) = (x + h)" = x" + nx"-Ih + h2g(X, h), 
where g(x, h) is simply some expression involving powers of x and h with 
numerical coefficients which, as we shall see later in the proof, it is 
unnecessary for us to determine. However, using the rules for limits of 
sums and products we can conclude that 
lim g(x, h) 
h-O 
will be some number which it is unnecessary for us to determine. 
The Newton quotient is therefore 
f(x + h) - f(x)

As h approaches 0, the term nx"-I remains unchanged. The limit of h as 
h tends to ° is 0, and hence by the product rule, the term hg(x, h) 
approaches ° 
when h approaches 0. Thus finally

[III, §4] 
It would not be difficult to prove Theorem 4.2 when a is a negative 
integer. It is best, however, to wait until we have a rule giving us the 
derivative of a quotient before doing it. We could also give a proof 
when a is a rational number. However, we shall prove the general result 
in a later chapter, and thus we prefer to wait until then, when we have 
more techniques available. 
Examples. If f(x) = XIO, then f'(x) = 10x9. 
If f(x) = X 3/2 (for x > 0), then f'(x) = 1Xl/2. 
If f(x) = x- S/4 , then f'(x) = -iX- 9/4 . 
If f(x) = xfi, then f'(x) = j2xfi - 1. 
Note especially the special case when f(x) = x. Then f'(x) = 1. 
Example. We can now find the equations of tangent lines to certain 
curves which we could not do before. Consider the curve 
We wish to find the equation of its tangent line at the point (2,32). By 
Theorem 4.1, if f(x) = x 5, then f'(x) = 5X4. Hence the slope of the tan-
gent line at x = 2 is 
1'(2) = 5.24 = 80. 
On the other hand, f(2) = 25 = 32. Hence the equation of the tangent 
line is 
y - 32 = 80(x - 2).

III, §5. SUMS, PRODUCTS, AND QUOTIENTS 
In this section we shall derive several rules which allow you to find the 
derivatives for sums, products, and quotients of functions when you 
know the derivative of each factor. 
We begin with a definition of continuous functions and the reason 
why a differentiable function is continuous. 
Definition. A function is said to be continuous at a point x if and only 
if 
lim f(x + h) = f(x). 
h-O 
A function is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point of its 
domain of definition. 
Let f be a function having a derivative f'(x) at x. Then f is continuous 
at x.

approaches the limit f'(x) as h approaches O. We have 
h f(x + h~ - f(x) = f(x + h) - f(x). 
Therefore using the rule for the limit of a product, and noting that h 
approaches 0, we find 
lim f(x + h) - f(x) = Of'(x) = O. 
h-O 
This is another way of stating that 
lim f(x + h) = f(x). 
h-O 
In other words, f is continuous.

THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §5] 
Of course, we can never substitute h = 0 in our quotient, because then 
it becomes 0/0, which is meaningless. 
Geometrically, letting h = 0 
amounts to taking the two points on the curve equal to each other. It is 
then impossible to have a unique straight line through one point. Our 
procedure of taking the limit of the Newton quotient is meaningful only 
if h # O. 
Observe that in the Newton quotient, both the numerator and the 
denominator approach O. The quotient itself, however, need not ap-
proach O. 
Example. Let I(x) = Ixl. Then the absolute value function 1 is con-
tinuous at 0, even though it is not differentiable at O. It is still true that 
1(0 + h) = I(h) = Ihl 
approaches 0 as h approaches 0, even though the function is not differen-
tiable at O. As we saw in §2, the function I(x) = Ixl is right differentiable 
at 0 and left differentiable at 0, but not differentiable at O. 
Example. Let I(x) = 0 if x < 0, and I(x) = 1 if x ~ O. The graph of 1 
is shown on Fig. 9. 
Figure 9 
The function 1 is not continuous at O. Roughly speaking, the function is 
not continuous at 0 because its graph has a "break" at O. In Fig. to, we 
show other examples of graphs with discontinuities.

In Fig. lO(a), the function is continuous except at x = -1. In Fig. lO(b), 
the function is continuous except at x = 2. 
The remark at the beginning of this section shows that if a function is 
differentiable, then it is continuous. Since we are concerned principally 
about differentiable functions at present, we do not go any deeper into 
continuous functions, and wait till later, until the notion becomes more 
relevant to us. 
Let c be a number and f(x) a function which has a derivative f'(x) 
for all values of x for which it is defined. We can multiply f by the 
constant c to get another function cf whose value at x is cf(x). 
Constant times a function. The derivative of cf is then given by the 
formula 
(cf)'(x) = cf'(x). 
In other words, the derivative of a constant times a function is the 
constant times the derivative of the function. 
In the other notation, this reads 
d(cf) 
df 
-
- =c-. 
dx 
dx 
To prove this rule, we use the definition of derivative. The Newton 
quotient for the function cf is 
(cf)(x + h) - (cf)(x) 
h 
cf(x + h) - cf(x) 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
h 
=c 
h 
Let us take the limit as h approaches O. Then c remains fixed, and 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
h 
approaches f'(x). According to the rule for the product of limits, we see 
that our Newton quotient approaches cf'(x), as was to be proved. 
Example. Let f(x) = 3x 2• Then f'(x) = 6x. If f(x) = 17x l / 2, then 
f'(x) = 127X-1 /2. If f(x) = IOxa, then f'(x) = lOaxa - 1• 
Next we look at the sum of two functions. 
Sum. Let f(x) and g(x) be two functions which have derivatives f'(x) 
and g'(x), respectively. Then the sum f(x) + g(x) has a derivative, and 
(f + g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x). 

82 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §5] 
The derivative of a sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives. 
In the other notation, this reads: 
To prove this, we have by definition 
(f + g)(x + h) = f(x + h) + g(x + h) 
and 
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x). 
Therefore the Newton quotient for f + 9 is 
(f + g)(x + h) - (f + g)(x) 
h 
f(x + h) + g(x + h) - f(x) - g(x) 
h 
Collecting terms and separating the fraction, we see that this expression 
is equal to 
f(x + h) - f(x) + g(x + h) - g(x) 
h 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
g(x + h) - g(x) 
= 
h 
+ 
h 
. 
Taking the limit as h approaches 0 and using the rule for the limit of a 
sum, we see that this last sum approaches f'(x) + g'(x) as h approaches 
O. This proves what we wanted. 
Example. 
Carried away by our enthusiasm at determining so easily the deriva-
tive of functions built up from others by means of constants and sums, 
we might now be tempted to state the rule that the derivative of a 
product is the product of the derivatives. Unfortunately, this is false. To 
see that the rule is false, we look at an example. 
Let f(x) = x and g(x) = x 2 . Then f'(x) = 1 and g'(x) = 2x. Therefore 
f'(x)g'(x) = 2x. However, the derivative of the product (fg)(x) = x 3 is 

[III, §5] 
SUMS, PRODUCTS, AND QUOTIENTS 
83 
3x 2 , which is certainly not equal to 2x. Thus the product of the deriva-
tives is not equal to the derivative of the product. 
Through trial and error the correct rule was discovered. It can be 
stated as follows: 
Product. Let f(x) and g(x) be two functions having derivatives f'(x) 
and g'(x). Then the product function f(x)g(x) has a derivative, which is 
given by the formula 
(fg)'(x) = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x). 
In words, the derivative of the product is equal to the first times the 
derivative of the second, plus the derivative of the first times the 
second. 
In the other notation, this reads 
d(fg) = f(x) dg + df g(x). 
dx 
dx 
dx 
The proof is not very much more difficult than the proofs we have 
already encountered. By definition, we have 
(fg)(x + h) = f(x + h)g(x + h) 
and 
(fg)(x) = f(x)g(x). 
Consequently the Newton quotient for the product function fg is 
(fg)(x + h) - (fg)(x) 
h 
f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x) 
h 
At this point, it looks a little hopeless to transform this quotient in such 
a way that we see easily what limit it approaches as h approaches O. 
But we use a trick, and rewrite our quotient by inserting 
-f(x + h)g(x) + f(x + h)g(x) 
in the numerator. This certainly does not change the value of our quo-
tient, which now looks like 
f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x + h)g(x) + f(x + h)g(x) - f(x)g(x) 
h 

84 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §5] 
We can split this fraction into a sum of two fractions: 
f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x + h)g(x) 
f(x + h)g(x) - f(x)g(x) 
h 
+ 
h 
. 
We can factor f(x + h) in the first term, and g(x) in the second term, to 
obtain 
f(x + h) g(x + h~ - g(x) + f(x + h~ - f(x) g(x). 
The situation is now well under control. As h approaches 0, f(x + h) 
approaches f(x), and the two quotients in the expression we have just 
written approach g'(x) and f'(x) respectively. Thus the Newton quotient 
for fg approaches 
f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x), 
thereby proving our assertion. 
Example. Applying the product rule, we find: 
d 
dx (x + 1)(3x2) = (x + 1)6x + I· 3x 2• 
Similarly, 
which you may and should leave just like that without attempting to simpli-
fy the expression. 
A special case of the product rule is used all the time, that of the 
square of a function. 
Example. 
Indeed, differentiating the product y = f(x)f(x), we obtain 
:~ = f(x)f'(x) + f'(x)f(x) = 2f(x)f'(x).

The last rule of this section concerns the derivative of a quotient. We 
begin with a special case. 
Let g(x) be a function having a derivative g'(x), and such that g(x) =F O. 
Then the derivative of the quotient l/g(x) exists, and is equal to

g'(x).

g(x)

g(x + h) - g(x)

The general case of the rule for quotients can now be easily stated 
and proved. 
Quotient. Let f(x) and g(x) be two functions having derivatives f'(x) 
and g'(x) respectively, and such that g(x) =F O. Then the derivative of 
the quotient f(x)/g(x) exists, and is equal to 
In words this yields: 
g(x)!'(x) - f(x)g'(x) 
q(X)2 
The bottom times the derivative of the top, minus the top times the 
derivative of the bottom, over the bottom squared 
(which you should memorize like a poem). 

86 
THE DERIVATIVE 
In the other notation, this reads: 
d{f/g) = g(x) df/dx - f(x) dg/dx

g(X)2 
To prove this rule, we write our quotient in the form 
f(x) = f(x) _1_ 
g(x) 
g(x)

and use the rule for the derivative of a product, together with the special

by putting this expression over the common denominator g(X)2. This is 
the desired derivative. 
We work out some examples.

Y + 13 = 169 (x + 3).

y = x 2 + 1 
have a common tangent line at the point (1,2). We let 
f(x) = x 2 + 1 
and 
Then 
f'(x) = 2x 
and 
Since 1'(1) = g'(1) = 2, the slope of the tangent lines to the graph of f 
and the graph of 9 is the same at the point (1,2). Hence the tangent 
lines are the same since they pass through the same point, namely 
y - 2 = 2(x -

This shows how to proceed from one step to the next. 
Such a procedure is called induction. You will find several instances of 
such a procedure throughout the course. In each case, work out the 
steps for n = 1, n = 2, n = 3, n = 4, and so forth, in succession. Go as 
far as you need to recognize the pattern and to be comfortable with it. 
Then try to formulate and carry out the final step with n instead of a 
specific number. After you have met enough examples of this type, you 
will have understood what induction means, and in particular, you will 
understand the following formal definition. 
Suppose we want to prove an assertion A(n) for every positive integer 
n. Then a proof by induction consists in proving: 
(1) The assertion is true when n = 1. 
(2) If the assertion is true for a given integer n, then it is true for 
n + 1.

allows us to go from one integer to the next, just as we did in the above

III, §6. THE CHAIN RULE 
We know how to build up new functions from old ones by means of 
sums, products, and quotients. There is one other important way of 
building up new functions. We shall first give examples of this new way. 
Consider the function (x + 2)10. We can say that this function is 
made up of the lO-th power function, and the function x + 2. Namely, 
given a number x, we first add 2 to it, and then take the lO-th power. 
Let 
g(x) = x + 2 
and let I be the lO-th power function. Then we can take the value of I 
at x + 2, namely 
I(x + 2) = (x + 2)10 

92 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §6] 
and we can also write it as 
f(x + 2) = f(g(x». 
Another example: Consider the function (3x4 -
1)1/2. If we let 
g(x) = 3x4 -
1 
and we let f be the square root function, then 
In order not to get confused by the letter x, which cannot serve us any 
more in all contexts, we use another letter to denote the values of g. 
Thus we may write f(u) = U 1/2• 
Similarly, let f(u) be the function u + 5 and g(x) = 2x. Then 
f(g(x» = f(2x) = 2x + 5. 
One more example of the same type: Let 
and 
Then 
1 
f(u)=-
u+2 
1 
f(g(x» = x10 + 2' 
In order to give you sufficient practice with many types of functions, 
we now mention several of them whose definitions will be given later. 
These will be sin and cos (which we read sine and cosine), log (which we 
read logarithm or simply log), and the exponential function expo We 
shall select a special number e (whose value is approximately 2.718 ... ), 
such that the function exp is given by 
We now see how we make new functions out of these: 
Let f(u) = sin u and g(x) = x 2• Then 
f(g(x») = sin(x2). 

[III, §6] 
THE CHAIN RULE 
93 
Let f(u) = e" and g(x) = cos x. Then 
f(g(x» = eCOSX • 
Let f(v) = log v and g(t) = t3 -
1. Then 
f(g(t» = log(t 3 -
1). 
Let f(w) = wlO and g(z) = log z + sin z. Then 
f(g(z» = (log z + sin Z)10. 
Whenever we have two functions f and 9 such that f is defined for all 
numbers which are values of g, then we can build a new function de-
noted by f og whose value at a number x is 
(f 
0 g)(x) = f(g(x» . 
The rule defining this new function is: Take the number x, find the 
number g(x), and then take the value of f at g(x). This is the value of 
f og at x. The function f og is called the composite function of f and g. 
We say that 9 is the inner function and that .f is the outer function. For 
example, in the function log sin x, we have 
f og = log 0 sin. 
The outer function is the log, and the inner function is the sine. 
It is important to keep in mind that we can compose two functions 
only when the outer function is defined at all values of the inner func-
tion. For instance, let f(u) = U I /2 and g(x) = _x 2• Then we cannot 
form the composite function f og because f is defined only for positive 
numbers (or 0) and the values of 9 are all negative, or o. Thus (- X2)1 /2 
does not make sense. 
However, for the moment you are asked to learn the mechanism of 
composite functions just the way you learned the multiplication table, in 
order to acquire efficient conditioned reflexes when you meet composite 
functions. Hence for the drills given by the exercises at the end of the 
section, you should forget for a while the meaning of the symbols and 
operate with them formally, just to learn the formal rules properly. 
Even though we have not defined the exponential function eX nor 
have we dealt formally with sin x or other of the functions just men-
tioned, nevertheless, we don't need to know their definitions in order to 
manipulate them. If we limited ourselves only to those functions which 
we have explicitly dealt with so far, we would be restricted in seeing how 
composite functions work, and how the chain rule works below. 

94 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §6] 
We come to the problem of taking the derivative of a composite func-
tion. 
We start with an example. Suppose we want to find the derivative of 
the function (x + 1)10. The Newton quotient would be a very long ex-
pression, which it would be essentially hopeless to disentangle by brute 
force, the way we have up to now. It is therefore a pleasant surprise 
that there will be an easy way of finding the derivative. We tell you the 
answer right away: The derivative of this function is lO(x + I )9. This 
looks very much related to the derivative of powers. 
Before stating and proving the general theorem, we give you other 
examples. 
Example. 
Observe carefully the extra term 2x + 2, which is the derivative of the 
expression x 2 + 2x. We may describe the answer in the following terms. 
We let u = x 2 + X so that du/dx = 2x + 1. 
Let f(u) = U3/2• Then we 
have 
d(f(u(x») = df du 
dx 
du dx' 
Example. 
Observe again the presence of the term 2x + 1, which is the derivative of 
x 2 + x. Again, if we let u = x 2 + x and f(u) = UIO, then 
df(u(x» 
df du 
dx 
= du dx' 
where du = 10u9 
and 
Can you guess the general rule from the preceding assertions? The 
general rule was also discovered by trial and error, but we profit from 
three centuries of experience, and thus we are able to state it and prove 
it very simply, as follows. 
Chain rule. Let f and g be two functions having derivatives, and such 
that f is defined at all numbers which are values of g. Then the compo-
site function f og has a derivative, given by the formula 
(f 0 g)'{x) = f'(g(x»g'(x). 

[III, §6] 
THE CHAIN RULE 
95 
This can be expressed in words by saying that we take the derivative of 
the outer function times the derivative of the inner function (or the deriva-
tive of what's inside). 
The preceding assertion is known as the chain rule. 
If we put u = g(x), then we may express the chain rule in the form 
df(u(x» _ df du 
dx 
du dx' 
or also 
d(fog) = df du 
dx 
du dx 
Thus the derivative behaves as if we could cancel the duo As long as we 
have proved this result, there is nothing wrong with working like a ma-
chine in computing derivatives of composite functions, and we shall give 
you several examples before the exercises. 
Example. Let F(x) = (x 2 + 1)10. Then 
where 
Then 
Thus 
F(x) = f(g(x», 
u = g(x) = x 2 + 1 
f'(u) = lOu 9 = df 
du 
and 
and 
g'(x) = 2x = ~~. 
Example. Let f(u) = 2U I /2 and g(x) = 5x + 1. Then 
Thus 
f'(u) = U- I /2 = df 
du 
and 
'( 
5 
dg 
9 x) = = dx' 
d 
dx 2(5x + 1)1/2 = 2'1(5x + 1)- 1/2· 5 = (5x + 1)-1/2·5. 
(Pay attention to the constant 5, which is the derivative of 5x + 1. You 
are very likely to forget it.) 

96 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §6] 
In order to give you more extensive drilling than would be afforded 
by the functions we have considered, like powers, we summarize the 
derivatives of the elementary functions which are to be considered later. 
Example. 
d(sin x) 
d(cos x)

= -smx. 
dx

:x (sin x? = 7(sin X)6 cos x. 
In this example, f(u) = u 7 and df /du = 7u6 • Also 
u = sin x, 
and 
du 
dx = cos x. 
Example. 
:x (sin 3xf = 7(sin 3X)6 cos 3x· 3. 
The last factor of 3 occurring on the right-hand side IS the derivative 
d(3x)/dx. 
Example. Let n be any integer. For any differentiable function f(x),

Example. 
d cos (2X2) = df du = _ sin(2x2) . 4x. 
dx 
du dx 

[III,§6] 
THE CHAIN RULE 
97 
In this example, f(u) = cos u and df/du = -sin u. Also u = 2X2 so that 
du/dx = 4x. 
Example. 
d cos 4x 
. 
---
= -sm(4x)·4. 
dx 
In this example, feu) = cos u and u = 4x so du/dx = 4. 
We emphasize what we have already stated. If we limited ourselves 
just to polynomials or quotients of polynomials, we would not have enough 
examples to drill the mechanism of the chain rule. There is nothing wrong 
in using the properties of functions which have not yet been formally 
defined in the course. We could in fact create totally imaginary functions 
to achieve the same end. 
Example. Suppose there is a function called schmoo(x), whose deriva-
tive is given by 
d schmoo(x) 
dx 
x + sin x 
Then 
d

(3x 2 + 4). 
(x 3 + 4x) + sm(x 3 + 4x) 
Example. Suppose there is a function cow(x) such that cow'(x) = 
schmoo(x). Then 
d cow(x2) 
dx 
= schmoo(x2) . 2x. 
Proof of the Chain Rule. We must consider the Newton quotient of 
the composite function f og. By definition, it is 
Put u = g(x), and let 
f[g(x + h)] - f[g(x)] 
h 
k = g(x + h) - g(x). 

98 
THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §6] 
Then k depends on h, and tends to 0 as h approaches O. Our Newton 
quotient is equal to 
f(u + k) - f(u) 
h 
For the present argument suppose that k is unequal to 0 for all small 
values of h. Then we can multiply and divide this quotient by k, and 
obtain 
f(u + k) - f(u) k 
f(u + k) - f(u) g(x + h) - g(x) 
k 
h-
k 
h 
If we let h approach 0 and use the rule for the limit of a product, we see 
that our Newton quotient approaches 
f'(u)g'(x), 
and this would prove our chain rule, under the assumption that k is 
not O. 
It does not happen very often that k = 0 for arbitrarily small values of 
h, but when it does happen, the preceding argument must be refined. 
For those of you who are interested, we shall show you how the argu-
ment can be slightly modified so as to be valid in all cases. The uninter-
ested reader can just skip it. 
We distinguish two kinds of numbers h. The first kind, those for 
which g(x + h) - g(x) # 0, and the second kind, those for which 
g(x + h) - g(x) = O. 
Let HI be the set of h of the first kind, and H 2 the set of h of the 
second kind. We assume that we have 
g(x + h) - g(x) = 0 
for arbitrarily small values of h. Then the Newton quotient 
g(x + h) - g(x) 
h 
is 0 for such values, that is for h in H 2, and consequently 
g'(x) = lim g(x + h) - g(x) = O. 
h-O 
h

Furthermore,

99 
because h is of second kind, so g(x + h) - g(x) = 0, g(x + h) = g(x) and 
therefore f(g(x + h» - f(g(x» = O. The limit here is taken with h ap-
proaching 0, but h of the second kind. 
On the other hand, if we take the limit with h of the first kind, then 
the original argument applies, i.e. we can divide and multiply by 
k = g(x + h) - g(x), 
and we find 
lim f(g(x + h~ - f(g(x» = j'(g(x»g'(x) 
h-O 
hinHt 
as before. But g'(x) = O. 
Hence the limit is 0 = j'(g(x»g'(x) when h 
approaches 0, whether h is of first kind or second kind. This concludes 
the proof.

THE DERIVATIVE 
[III, §7] 
III, §7. HIGHER DERIVATIVES 
Given a differentiable function f defined on an interval, its derivative f' 
is also a function on this interval. If it turns out to be also differentiable 
(this being usually the case), then its derivative is called the second deri-
vative of f and is denoted by 1"(x), 
Example. Let f(x) = (x 3 + 1)2, Then 
and 
1"(x) = 30x4 + 12x, 
There is no reason to stop at the second derivative, and one can of 
course continue with the third, fourth, etc, provided they exist. Since it is 
notationally inconvenient to pile up primes after f to denote successive 
derivatives, one writes 
for the n-th derivative of f Thus 1" is also written P2) , If we wish to 
refer to the variable x, we also write 
d"f 
pn)(x) =-,

In the process of finding these derivatives, you should observe a pattern. Let n 
be a positive integer. Define n! to be the product of the first n integers. Thus 
n! = n(n -
1)(n - 2)···2·1. 
This is called n factorial. For example: 
2! = 2, 
3! = 3·2 = 6, 
4! = 4·3 ·2 = 24. 
Compute 5!, 6!, 7!. You will find n! used especially in the chapter on Taylor's 
formula, much later in the course.

Suppose that a curve is defined by an equation 
F(x, y) = 0 
like a circle, x 2 + l = 7, or an ellipse, or more generally an equation 
like 
It is usually the case that for most values of x, one can solve back for y 
as a function of x, that is find a differentiable function 
y = f(x) 
satisfying the equation. For example, in the case of the circle, 
we have 
and hence we get two possibilities for y, 
y=~ or 
y=-~. 
The graph of the first function is the upper semicircle, and the graph of 
the second function is the lower semicircle. 
In the example 3x 3y - y4 + 5x2 + 5 = 0, it is a mess to solve for y, 
and we don't do it. However, assuming that y = f(x) is a differentiable 
function satisfying this equation, we can find an expression for the deri-
vative more easily, and we shall do so in an example below. 
Example. Find the derivative dy/dx if x2 + y2 = 7, in terms of x 
and y. 
We differentiate both sides of the equation using the chain rule, and 
the fact that dx/dx = 1. We then obtain:

III, §9. RATE OF CHANGE 
[III, §9] 
The derivative has an interesting physical interpretation, which was very 
closely connected with it in its historical development, and is worth 
mentioning. 
Suppose that a particle moves along some straight line a certain dis-
tance depending on time t. Then the distance s is a function of t, which 
we write s = f(t). 
For two values of the time, t\ and t 2 , the quotient 
f(t 2 ) - f(t\) 
t2 -
t\ 
can be regarded as a sort of average speed of the particle since it gives 
the total distance covered divided by the total time elapsed. At a given 
time to, it is therefore reasonable to regard the limit 
I. 
f(t} - f(t o} 
1m 
1-10 
t - to 
as the rate of change of s with respect to t. This is none other than the 
derivative ret), which is called the speed. 

[III, §9] 
RATE OF CHANGE 
Let us denote the speed by v(t). Then 
ds 
v(t) = - . 
dt 
The rate of change of the speed is called the acceleration. Thus 
dv 
. 
~s 
dt = a(t) = acceleratIOn = dt2' 
107 
Example. If the particle is an object dropping under the influence of 
gravity, then experimental data show that 
where G is the gravitational constant. In that case, 
ds 
-
= Gt 
dt 
is its speed. The acceleration is then 
d2s 
. 
. 
I 
dt 2 = G = gravltatlOna constant. 
Example. A particle is moving so that at time t the distance traveled 
is given by the function 
s(t) = t 2 + 1. 
The derivative s'(t) is equal to 2t. Thus the speed of the particle is equal 
to 0 at time t = O. Its speed is equal to 4 at time t = 2. 
In general, given a function y = f(x), the derivative f'(x) is interpreted 
as the rate of change of y with respect to x. Thus f' is also a function. 
If y is increasing as x is increasing, this means that the derivative is 
positive, in other words f'(x) > O. If y is decreasing, this means that the 
rate of change of y with respect to x is negative, that is f'(x) < O. 
Example. Suppose that a particle moves with uniform speed along a 
straight line, say along the x-axis toward the right, away from the origin.

Suppose that at some time the particle is 12 cm to the right of the 
origin. After each further second of motion, the distance increases by 
another Scm, so after 3 seconds, the distance of the particle from the 
origin will be 
12 + 3· S = 12 + IS = 27 cm. 
One can find the x-coordinate as a function of time. Under uniform 
speed, distance traveled is equal to the product of speed with time. Thus 
if the particle starts from the origin at time t = 0 then 
x(t) = St. 
If, on the other hand, the particle starts from another point xo, then 
x(t) = St + Xo. 
Indeed, if we substitute 0 for t in this equation, we find 
x(O) = 5·0 + xo = xo. 
Hence Xo is the value of x when t = O. 
Example. Suppose that a particle is moving to the left at a rate of 
5 cm/sec. Then we write 
~; = -S. 
Again suppose that at some time the particle is 12 cm to the right of the 
origin. Then after 2 seconds, the distance of the particle from the origin 
will be 
12 - 2· S = 12 - 10 = 2 cm .

Finally, suppose the particle does not start when t = 0 but starts later, 
say after 25 seconds, but still moves with the same constant speed. We 
could measure time in terms of a new coordinate t'. In terms of t', the 
x-coordinate is given by 
x = -5t'. 
We can give t' as a function of t, by 
t' = t - 25. 
Then 
x = - 5(t - 25) 
gives x as a function of t. 
In many applications, we have to consider related rates of change, 
which involve the chain rule. Suppose, that y is a function of x, and also 
that x is given as some function of time, say, x = g(t), then we can 
determine both the rate of change of y with respect to x, namely dy/dx, 
but also the rate of change of y with respect to t, namely 
by the chain rule. 
dy = dy dx

Example. A square is expanding in such a way that its edge is chang-

change of its area. 
The area of a square as a function of its side is given by the function 
If the side x is given as a function of time t, say x = x(t), then the rate 
of change of the area with respect to time is by definition

The time 2 hours after the second train leaves is t = 2 + 3 = 5. The

CHAPTER

Sine and Cosine 
From the sine of an angle and the cosine of an angle, we shall define 
functions of numbers, and determine their derivatives. 
It is convenient to recall all the facts about trigonometry which we 
need in the sequel, especially the formula giving us the sine and cosine of 
the sum of two angles. Thus our treatment of the trigonometric func-
tions is self-contained-you do not need to know anything about sine 
and cosine before starting to read this chapter. However, most of the 
proofs of statements in §1 come from plane geometry and will be left to 
you. 
IV, §O. REVIEW OF RADIAN MEASURE 
In order to eliminate some confusion of terminology, it is often conven-
ient to use two different words for a circle, and a circle together with the 
region lying inside. Thus we reserve the word circle for the former, and 
call the circle together with its inside a disc. Thus we speak of the length 
of a circle, but the area of a disc. 
We suppose fixed a measure of length. This determines a measure of 
area. For instance, if length is measured in meters, then area is measured 
in square meters. 
For our immediate purposes, we define n to be the area of the disc of 
radius 1. It is, of course, a problem to find a decimal expansion for n, 
which you probably have been told is approximately equal to 3.14159 ... . 
Later in the course, you will learn to compute n to any degree of 
accuracy. 
The disc of radius r is obtained by a dilation (blow up) of the disc of 
radius 1, as shown on the figure at the top of the next page.

How does area change under dilation? Let us first look at rectangles. 
Let R be a rectangle whose sides have length a, b. Let r be a positive 
number. Let rR be the rectangle whose sides have length ra, rb, as 
shown on the figure. Then the area of rR is rarb = r2ab. If A is the area 
of R, then the area of rR is r2 A. 
rb 
Area = r2 ab 
ra 
Under dilation by a factor r the area of a rectangle changes by a factor 
r2. This applies as a general principle to any region: 
Let S be any region in the plane. Let A be the area of S. Under 
dilation by a factor r, the dilated region has area r2 A. 
We shall prove this by approximating S by the squares of a grid, as 
shown on the figure. If we blow up S by a factor of r, we obtain a 
region rS. Let A be the area of S. Then the area of rS will again be 
r2 A, because each small square is blown up by a factor of r, so the area 
of a small square changes by a factor of r2. The sum of the areas of the 
squares gives an approximation to the area of the figure. We want to

estimate how good the approximation is. The difference between the 
sum of the areas of all the little squares contained in the figure and the 
area of the figure itself is at most the area of all the small squares which 
touch the boundary of the figure. We can give an estimate for this as 
follows. 
Suppose we make a grid so that the squares have sides of length c. 
Then the diagonal of such a square has length cJ2. If a square inter-
sects the boundary, then any point on the square is at .distance at most 
cJ2 from the boundary. Look at the figure. 
This is because the 
distance between any two points of the square is at most cJ2. Let us

draw a band of width cJ2 on each side of the boundary, as shown in 
(b) of the above figure. Then all the squares which intersect the bound-
ary must lie within that band. It is very plausible that the area of the 
band is at most equal to 
2cJ2 times the length of the boundary. 
Thus if we take c to be very small, i.e. if we take the grid to be a very 
fine grid, then the area of the band is small, and the area of the figure is 
approximated by the area covered by the squares lying entirely inside the 
figure. Under dilation, a similar argument applies to the dilated band for 
the dilated figure, so that the area of the dilated band is at most 
2r2 . cJ2 times the length of the boundary. 
As c approaches 0, the areas of these bands approach 0. This justifies 
our assertion that area changes by a factor of r2 under dilation by a 
factor of r. 
Since we defined n to be the area of the disc of radius 1, we now 
obtain: 
The area of a disc of radius r is nr2.

We select a unit of measurement for angles such that the flat angle is 
equal to n times the unit angle. (See the following figure.) The right 
angle has measure n/2. The full angle going once around has then mea-
sure 2n. This unit of measurement for which the flat angle has measure 
n is called the radian. Thus the right angle has n/2 radians.

There is another current unit of measurement for which the flat angle 
is 180. This unit is called the degree. Thus the flat angle has 180 de-
grees, and the right angle has 90 degrees. We also have 
360 degrees = 2n radians, 
60 degrees = n/3 radians, 
45 degrees = n/4 radians, 
30 degrees = n/6 radians. 
We shall deal mostly with radian measure, which makes some formulas 
come out more easily later on. It is easy to convert from one measure 
to the other.

If the radius is 1, then the area of the sector is 0/2. We shall use this in 
§4. 
Example. The area of a sector of angle n/3 in a disc of radius 1 is 
n/6, because the total area of the disc is n, and the sector represents one-
sixth of the total area. This is illustrated on the figure. 
The disc in the figure is cut up into six sectors, each angle measuring n/3

Let c be the circumference of a circle of radius r. Then 
c = 2nr. 
Proof The proof will be a beautiful example of the idea of differentia-
tion. We consider a circle of radius r, and a circle of slightly bigger 
radius, which we write r + h. We suppose that these circles have the 
same center, and so obtain a circular band between them. 
Let c be the length of the small circle. If we had a rectangular band of 
length c and height h then its area would be ch. 
c 
Suppose we wrap this band around the small circle. 
Since the circle curves outward, the rectangular band has to be stretched 
if it is to cover the band between the circle of radius r and the circle of 
radius r + h. Thus we have an inequality for areas: 
ch < area of circular band. 
Similarly, if C is the circumference of the bigger circle, then 
area of circular band < Ch. 

[IV, §O] 
REVIEW OF RADIAN MEASURE 
123 
But the area of the circular band is the difference between the areas of 
the discs, which is 
area of circular band = n(r + h)2 - nr2 
= n(2rh + h2 ). 
Therefore we obtain the inequalities 
ch < n(2rh + h2 ) < Ch. 
We divide these inequalities by the positive number h to obtain 
c < n(2r + h) < C. 
Now let h approach O. Then the circumference of the big circle C ap-
proaches the circumference of the small circle c, and n(2r + h) ap-
proaches 2nr. It follows that 
c = 2nr, 
thus proving our formula. 
Observe that the length of the circumference is just the derivative of 
the area. 
An arc on a circle can be measured by its angle in radians. What is 
the length L of this arc, as on the following figure? 
The answer is as follows. 
Let L be the length of an arc of 0 radians on a circle of radius r. Then 
I L= rO. I 
Proof The total length of the circle is 2nr, and L is the fraction O/2n 
of 2nr, which gives precisely rO.

We can factor c from the denominator, and then cancel c m both the 
numerator and denominator to get

In this way we see that sine A does not depend on the choice of the 
point (x, y). 
The geometric interpretation of the above argument simply states that 
the triangles in the following diagram are similar.

The angle A can go all the way around. For instance, we could have 
an angle determined by a point (x, y) in the second or third quadrant. 
(x, y) 
(x, y) 
When the angle A is in the first quadrant, then its sine and cosine are 
positive because both coordinates x, yare positive. When the angle A is 
in the second quadrant, its sine is positive because y is positive, but its 
cosine is negative because x is negative. 
When A is in the third quadrant, sine A is negative and cosine A is 
negative also. 
As mentioned in the introductory section, we use radian measure for 
angles. Suppose A is an angle of (J radians, and let (x, y) be a point on 
the circle of radius 1, also lying on the line determining the angle A as 
shown on the figure. Then in this case, 
r = Jx 2 + l = 1 
and therefore 
(x, y) = (cos (J, sin (J). 

126 
SINE AND COSINE 
[IV, §1] 
In general for arbitrary radius r, we have the relations: 
x = r cos (J, 
y = r sin (J. 
We can also define the sine and cosine of angles in a right triangle as 
shown on the figure, by the formulas:

Unless otherwise specified, we always use the radian measure, and our

The values of this table are easily determined, using properties of simi-
lar triangles and plane geometry. For instance, we get the sine of the 
angle n/4 radians = 45° from a right triangle with two equal sides:

We can determine the sine of n/4 by means of the point (1, 1). Then 
r = j2 and sine n/4 radians is 1/j2. Similarly for the cosine. 
We get the sine of an angle of n/6 radians by considering a triangle 
such that two angles have n/6 and n/3 radians (that is, 30° and 60° 
respectively). 
If we let the side opposite the angle of 30° have length 1, then the 
hypotenuse has length 2, and the side adjacent to the angle of 30° has 
length Ji 
Hence we find that 
sin n/6 = ~

The choice of radian measure allows us to define the sine of a number 
rather than the sine of an angle as follows. 

128 
SINE AND COSINE 
[IV, §1] 
Let x be a number with 0 ~ x < 2n. We define sin x to be the sine of 
x radians. 
For an arbitrary number x, we write 
x = Xo + 2nn 
where n is an integer, ° 
~ Xo < 2n, and define 
. 
. 
smx = smxo. 
From this definition, we see that 
sin x = sin(x + 2n) = sin(x + 2nn) 
for any integer n. 
Of course, we call this function the sine function. Thus sin n = 0, 
sin nl2 = 1, sin 2n = 0, sin 0 = o. 
Similarly, we have the cosine function, which is defined for all numbers 
x by the rule: 
cos x is the number which is the cosine of the angle x radians. 
Thus cos 0 = 1 and cos n = - 1. 
If we had used the measure of angles in degrees we would obtain 
another sine function which is not equal to the sine function which we 
defined in terms of radians. Suppose we call this other sine function 
sin*. Then 
sin*(180) = sin n, 
and in general 
sin*(180x) = sin nx 
for any number x. Thus 
sin* x = sinC;o x) 
is the formula relating our two sine functions. It will become clear later 
why we always pick the radian measure instead of any other. 
At present we have no means of computing values for the sine and 
cosine other than the very special cases listed above (and similar ones, 

[IV, §l] 
THE SINE AND COSINE FUNCTIONS

based on simple symmetries of right triangles). In Chapter XIII we shall 
develop a method which will allow us to find sin x and cos x for any 
value of x, up to any degree of accuracy that you wish. 
On the next figure we illustrate an angle of e radians, and by conven-
tion the angle of - e radians is the reflection around the x-axis. 
If (x, y) are the coordinates of a point on the ray defining the angle of e 
radians, then (x, - y) are the coordinates of a point on the reflected ray. 
Thus 
sin( - e) = - sin e, 
cos( - e) = cos e. 
Finally we recall the definitions of the other trigonometric functions:

make a few additional remarks on the tangent. 
The tangent is of course defined for all numbers e such that 
cos e ;;/; o. 
These are the numbers unequal to 
in general, e ;;/; (2n + 1)/2 for some integer n. We make a table of some

You should complete this table for all similar values of 0 In all four

Consider an angle of 0 radians, and let (x, y) be a point on the ray 
determining this angle, with x # O. Then 
tan 0 = y/x 
so that 
y = (tan O)x. 
Conversely, any point (x, y) satisfying this equation is a point on the line 
making an angle 0 with the x-axis, as shown on the next figure. 
In an equation y = ax where a is the slope, we can say that 
a = tan 0, 
where 0 is the angle which the line makes with the x-axis. 
Example. Take 0 = n/6. Then tan 0 = 1/J3. Hence the line making 
an angle of 0 with the x-axis has the equation 
y = (tan ~) x, 
or also 
1 
Y = J3 x. 
Example. Take 0 = 1. There is no easier way to express tan 1 other 
than writing tan 1. In Chapter XIII you will learn how to compute 
arbitrarily close decimal approximations. Here we don't care. We simply

point out that the equation of the line making an angle of 1 radian with 
the x-axis is given by 
y = (tan l)x. 
Similarly, the equation of the line making an angle of 2 radians with 
the x-axis is given by 
y = (tan 2)x. 
Suppose given that Tt is approximately equal to 3.14. Then 1 is approxi-
mately equal to Tt/3. Thus the line making an angle of 1 radian with the 
x-axis, as shown on Fig. l(a) is close to the line making an angle of Tt/3 
radians. Similarly, the line making an angle of 2 radians with the x-axis, 
as shown on Fig. l(b), is close to the line making an angle of 2Tt/3 
radians.

IV, §2. THE GRAPHS 
sin x 
We wish to sketch the graph of the sine function. 
We know that sin 0 = O. 
As x goes from 0 to n/2, the sine of x 
increases until x reaches n12, at which point the sine is equal to 1. 
As x ranges from n/2 to n, the sine decreases until it becomes 
sin n = O. 
As x ranges from n to 3nl2 the sine becomes negative, but otherwise 
behaves in a similar way to the first quadrant, until it reaches 
. 3n 
1 
sm 2 = - . 
Finally, as x goes from 3nl2 to 2n, the sine of x goes from - 1 to 0, 
and we are ready to start all over again. 
The graph looks like this: 
y-axis 
y=sinx 
---411.----_---#-----<_-~--+__-_+-- x-axis 
If we go once around by 2n, the sine and cosine each take on the 
same values they had originally, in other words 
sin(x + 2n) = sin x, 
cos(x + 2n) = cos x 

[IV, §2] 
THE GRAPHS 
133 
for all x. This holds whether x is positive or negative, and the same 
would be true if we took x - 2n instead of x + 2n. 
You might legitimately ask why one arch of the sine (or cosine) curve 
looks the way we have drawn it, and not the following way: 
A 
In the next section, we shall find the slope of the curve y = sin x. It is 
equal to cos x. Thus when x = 0, the slope is cos ° = 1. Furthermore, 
when x = n/2, we have cos n/2 = 0 and hence the slope is O. This means 
that the curve becomes horizontal, and cannot have a peak the way we 
have drawn it above. 
At present we have no means for computing more values of sin x and 
cos x. However, using the few that we know and the derivative, we can 
convince ourselves that the graph looks as we have drawn it. 
cos x 
The graph of the cosine will look like that of the sine, but it staris with 
cos 0 = l.

sin 2x 
Next let us graph y = f(x) = sin 2x. Since the sine changes its behavior 
in intervals of length n/2, sin 2x will change behavior in intervals of 
length n/4. Thus we make a table with x ranging over intervals of length 
n/4.

inc. 3n/4 to n 
inc. 3n/2 to 2n 
inc. -I to 0 

134 
SINE AND COSINE 
[IV, §2] 
Then the graph repeats. Hence the graph of sin 2x looks like this. 
y = sin 2x 
We see that the graph of y = sin 2x has twice as many wiggles over an 
interval as the graph of y = sin x. 
Similarly, you would see that y = sin tx has half as many wiggles as 
the graph of y = sin x. 
tan x 
Finally, let us graph y = tan x. 
Note that tan 0 = O. 
We take the 
interval 
If x is near - n/2 then the tangent is very large negative. Namely 
sin x 
tan x = ~-. 
cos x 
When x is near - nl2 then cos x is near 0 and sin x IS near - 1. You 
can also see this from a right triangle. 
As x increases from - nl2 to 0, sin x increases from - 1 to O. On the 
other hand, as x increases from - nl2 to 0, cos x increases from 0 to 1. 
Hence llcos x decreases from very large negative to 1. Hence as x in-
creases from - nl2 to 0, 
smx 
tan x = ~-
increases from large negative to O. 
cos x 

[IV, §2] 
THE GRAPHS 
135 
Similarly, as x increases from 0 to n12, sin x increases from 0 to 1 and 
cos x decreases from 1 to O. Hence llcos x increases from 1 to very large 
positive, and so 
sin x 
tan x = --
increases from 0 to large positive.

is the number sin 2 times x. The graph of 
y = (sin 2)x

IV, §3. ADDITION FORMULA 
[IV, §3] 
In this section we shall state and prove the most important formulas 
about sine and cosine. 
To begin with, using the Pythagoras theorem, we shall see that 
(sin (J)2 + (cos (J)2 = 1 
for all numbers O. To show this, we take an angle A and we determine 
its sine and cosine from the right triangle, as in the following figure. 
~, 
b 
Then by Pythagoras we have 
Dividing by r2 yields 
We drew the angle A to be between 0 and rr./2. But in general, referring 
back to the definitions, we have

ADDITION FORMULA 
r2

137 
It is customary to write the square of the sine and cosine as sin2 A and 
cos2 A. In the second case note that b is negative. 
Our main result is the addition formula, which should be memorized. 
Theorem 3.1. For any angles A and B, we have 
sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B, 
cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B. 
Proof We shall prove the second formula first. 
We consider two angles A, B and their sum : 
o 
p 
We take two points P, Q as indicated, at a distance I from the origin O. 
We shall now compute the distance from P to Q, using two different 
coordinate systems. 
First, we take a coordinate system as usual: 
Then P = (1, 0) and 
Q = (cos(A + B), sin(A + B»). 
The square of the distance between P = (XI' YI) and Q = (X2' Y2) is 

138 
Hence 
SINE AND COSINE 
dist(P, Q)2 = sin2(A + B) + (cos(A + B) -
1)2, 
= - 2 cos( A + B) + 2. 
[IV, §3] 
Next we place the coordinate system as shown in the figure below. 
y-axis 
x-axis 
Then the coordinates of P become 
(cos( -
A), sin( -A» = (cos A, - sin A). 
Those of Q are simply (cos B, sin B). Hence 
dist(P, Q)2 = (sin B + sin A? + (cos B - cos A)2, 
= sin 2 B + 2 sin B sin A + sin 2 A 
+ cos2 B-2 cos B cos A + cos2 A 
= 2 + 2 sin A sin B-2 cos A cos B. 
If we set the squares of the two distances equal to each other, we get our 
formula. 
From the addition formula for the cosine, we get some formulas relat-
ing sine and cosine. 
sin x = cos(x - ~). 
cos x = sin(x +~} 
To prove the first one, we start with the right-hand side: 
cos0 -~) = cos x cos( -~) - sin x sin( -~) 
= 0 + sin x = sin x 
because cos( -nI2) = 0 and - sin( - () = sin () (with () = nI2). 

[IV, §3] 
ADDITION FORMULA 
139 
The second relation follows from the first, namely in the first relation 
put x = z + n/2. Then 
sin~ +~) = cos(z + 
~ -~) = cos z. 
This proves the second relation. 
Similarly, you can prove 
sin(~ - x) = cos x. 
This will be used in the next argument. 
The addition formula for the sine can be obtained from the addition 
formula for the cosine by the following device: 
sin(A + B) = COS(A + B - ~) 
= cos A COS(B -~) - sin A sin(B -~) 
= cos A sin B + sin A sin( ~ - B) 
= cos A sin B + sin A cos B, 
thereby proving the addition formula for the sine. 
Example. Find sin(n/ 12). 
We write

d(cos x)

dx 
Proof We shall first determine the derivative of sin x. We have to 
look at the Newton quotient of sin x. It is 
sin(x + h) - sin x 
h 
Using the addition formula to expand sin(x + h), we see that the Newton 
quotient is equal to 
sin x cos h + cos x sin h - sin x 
h 
We put together the two terms involving sin x: 
cos x sin h + sin x(cos h -

h 
and separate our quotient into a sum of two terms: 
sin h

cos h - 1

sin h

cos h - 1

as h approaches O.

To find the derivative of cos x, we could proceed in the same way, 
and we would encounter the same limits. However, there is a trick 
which avoids this. 
We know that cos x = Sin( x +~} Let u = x + 
~ and use the chain 
rule. We get 
d(cos x) 
d(sin u) du

However, du/dx = 1. Hence 
d(cos x)

dx 
= cos u = cos x +"2 = - sm x, 
thereby proving our theorem. 
Remark. It is not true that the derivative of the function sin* x is 
cos* x. Using the chain rule, find out what its derivative is. The reason 
for using the radian measure of angles is to get a function sin x whose 
derivative is cos x. 
Example. Find the tangent line of the curve y = sin 4x at the point 
x = n/ 16. This is easily done. Let f(x) = sin 4x. Then 
f'(x) = 4 cos 4x.

Hence the slope of the tangent line at x = 1t/16 is equal to

AB is sin h. 
The base OC of the big triangle is equal to 1. Its altitude CD is 
sin h 
t= -

cos h 
The area of each triangle is t the base times the altitude.

IV, §6. POLAR COORDINATES 
Instead of describing a point in the plane by its coordinates with respect 
to two perpendicular axes, we can also describe it as follows. We draw a 
ray between the point and a given origin. The angle e which this ray 
makes with the horizontal axis and the distance r between the point and 
the origin determine our point. Thus the point is described by a pair of 
numbers (r, e), which are called its polar coordinates. 
y-axis 
(r, 8) 
x-axis

If we have our usual axes and x, yare the ordinary coordinates of 
our point, then we see that 
whence 
x - = cos e 
r 
x = r cos e 
and 
y 
. e 
- = SIn, 
r 
and 
y = r sin e. 
This allows us to change from polar coordinates to ordinary coordinates. 
It is to be understood that r is always supposed to be ~ O. In terms of 
the ordinary coordinates, we have 

[IV, §6] 
POLAR COORDINATES 
lSI 
By Pythagoras, r is the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0,0). 
Note that distance is always ~ o. 
Example 1. Find polar coordinates of the point whose ordinary coor-
dinates are (I, )3). 
We have x = 1 and y =)3, so that r = J1+3 = 2. Also 
x 
1 
cos e = - =
-
r 
2' 
Hence e = n13, and the polar coordinates are (2, nI3). 
We observe that we may have several polar coordinates corresponding 
to the same point. The point whose polar coordinates are (r, e + 2n) is 
the same as the point (r, e). Thus in our example above, (2, nl3 + 2n) 
would also be polar coordinates for our point. In practice, we usually 
use the value for the angle which lies between 0 and 2n. 
Suppose a bug is traveling in the plane. Its position is completely 
determined if we know the angle e and the distance of the bug from the 
origin, that is if we know the polar coordinates. If the distance r from 
the origin is given as a function of e, then the bug is traveling along a 
curve and we can sketch this curve. 
Example 2. Sketch the graph of the function r = sin e for 0 ~ e ~ n. 
If n < e < 2n, then sin e < 0 and hence for such e we don't get a 
point on the curve. Next, we make a table of values. We consider 
intervals of e such that sin e is always increasing or always decreasing 
over these intervals. This tells us whether the point is moving further 
away from the origin, or coming closer to the origin, since r is the 
distance of the point from the origin. Intervals of increase and decrease 
for sin e can be taken to be of length n12. Thus we find the following 
table: 
e 
sin e = r 
inc. 0 to nl2 
inc. 0 to 1 
inc. nl2 to n 
dec. I to 0 
nl6 
1/2 
nl4 
1)2 
nl3 
)312 
Put in words: as e increases from 0 to n12, then sin e and therefore r 
increases until r reaches 1. As e increases from nl2 to n then sin e and 
thus r decreases from 1 to O. Hence the graph looks like this.

We have drawn the graph like a circle. Actually, we don't know whether 
it is a circle or not. The graph could be flatter in one direction than in 
another. In the next example, we shall see that it actually must be a 
circle. 
Example 3. Change the equation 
r = sin fJ 
to rectangular coordinates. 
We substitute the expressions 
and 
sin () = y/r = y/Jx2 + y2 
in the polar equation, to obtain 
Of course, this substitution is valid only when r =F 0, i.e. r > O. We can 
then simplify the equation we have just obtained, multiplying both sides 
by J x2 + y2 . We then obtain 
You should know from Chapter II that this is the equation of a circle, 
by completing the square. We recall here how this is done. We write 
the equation in the form 
x 2 + i - y = o. 
We would like this equation to be of the form 

[IV, §6] 
POLAR COORDINATES 
153 
because then we know immediately that this is a circle of center (0, b) 
and radius c. We know that 
Therefore we let 2b = 1 and b = t. Then 
because the * cancels. Thus the equation 
is equivalent with 
This is the equation of a circle of center (0, t) and radius t. The point 
corresponding to the polar coordinate r = 0 is the point with rectangular 
coordinates x = 0 and y = o. 
Example 4. The equation of the circle of radius 3 and center at the 
origin in polar coordinates is simply 
r=3 
or 
or 
This expresses the condition that that distance of the point (x, y) from 
the origin is the constant 3. The angle () can be arbitrary. 
Example 5. Consider the equation () = 1 in polar coordinates. A 
point with polar coordinates (r, () satisfies this equation if and only if its 
angle () is 1 and there is no restriction on its r-coordinate, i.e. r;;:; O. 
Thus geometrically, this set of points can be described as a half line, or a 
ray, as on the figure (a).

By the definition of the tangent, if (x, y) are the ordinary coordinates of 
a point on this ray, and y ::/= 0, then 
y/x = tan 1 
and 
x >0, 
whence 
y = (tan l)x 
and 
x> o. 
Of course, the point with x = y = 0 also lies on the ray. Conversely, any 
point whose ordinary coordinates (x, y) satisfy 
y = (tan l)x 
and 
x~o 
lies on the ray. Hence the ray defined in polar coordinates by the equa-
tion (J = 1 is defined in ordinary coordinates by the pair of conditions 
y = (tan l)x 
and 
x ~ o. 
Instead of 1 we could take any number. For instance, the ray defined 
by the equation (J = n/6 in polar coordinates is also defined by the pair 
of conditions 
y = (tan n/6)x 
and 
x ~ o. 
Since tan n/6 = 1/)3, we may write the equivalent pair of conditions

and 
x ~o. 
Note that there is no simpler way of expressing tan 1 than just writing 
tan 1. Only when dealing with fractional multiples of n do we have 
a way of writing the trigonometric functions in terms of roots, like 
tan n/6 = 1/)3. 
Example 6. Let us sketch the curve given in polar coordinates by the 
equation 
r = Isin 201. 
The absolute value sign makes the right-hand side always 
~ 0, and so 
there is a value of r for every value of (J. 
Regions of increase and 
decrease for sin 20 will occur when 2(J ranges over intervals of length 
n/2. Hence it is natural to look at intervals for 0 of length n/4. We now 
make a table of the increasing and decreasing behavior of Isin 201 and r 
over such intervals.

The graph therefore looks like this: 
Graph of r = Isin 291 
Because of the absolute value sign, for any value of () we obtain a 
value for r which is ~ O. According to our convention, if we wanted to 
graph 
r = sin 2() 
without the absolute value sign, then we would have to omit those por-
tions of the above graph for which sin 2() is negative, i.e. those portions

Example 8. Let us look at the slightly different equation 
r = I + 2 sin e. 
A similar analysis will work, but we must be careful of the possibility 
that the expression on the right-hand side is negative. According to our 
convention, this will not yield a point since we assume that r ~ 0 for 
polar coordinates. Thus when 2 sin e < -1, we do not get any point. 
This occurs precisely in the interval

The Mean Value Theorem 
Given a curve, y = f(x), we shall use the derivative to give us informa-
tion about the curve. For instance, we shall find the maximum and 
minimum of the graph, and regions where the curve is increasing or 
decreasing. We shall use the mean value theorem, which is basic in the 
theory of derivatives. 
V, §1. THE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THEOREM 
Definition. Let f be a differentiable function. A critical point of f is a 
number c such that 
f'(c) = O. 
The derivative being zero means that the slope of the tangent line is 0 
and thus that the tangent line itself is horizontal. We have drawn three 
examples of this phenomenon.

The third example is that of a function like f<x) = x 3 . We have 
f'(x) = 3x 2 and hence when x = 0, 1'(0) = o. 

160 
THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §1] 
The other two examples are those of a maximum and a mInImUm, 
respectively, if we look at the graph of the function only near our point 
c. We shall now formalize these notions. 
Let a, b be two numbers with a < b. We shall repeatedly deal with 
the interval of numbers between a and b. Sometimes we want to include 
the end points a and b, and sometimes we do not. We recall the stan-
dard terminology. 
The collection of numbers x such that a < x < b is called the open 
interval between a and b. 
The collection of numbers x such that a ~ x ~ b is called the closed 
interval between a and b. We denote this closed interval by the symbols 
[a, b]. (A single point will also be called a closed interval.) 
If we wish to include only one end point, we shall say that the inter-
val is half-closed. We have of course two half-closed intervals, namely 
the one consisting of the numbers x with a ~ x < b, and the other one 
consisting of the numbers x with a < x ~ b. 
Sometimes, if a is a number, we call the collection of numbers x > a 
(or x < a) an open interval. The context will always make this clear. 
Let f be a function, and c a number at which f is defined. 
Definition. We shall say that c is a maximum point of the function f 
if and only if 
f(c) ~ f(x) 
for all numbers x at which f is defined. If the condition f(c) ~ f(x) 
holds for all numbers x in some interval, then we say that the function 
has a maximum at c in that interval. We call f(c) a maximum value. 
Example 1. Let f(x) = sin x. Then f has a maximum at n/2 because 
f(n/2) = 1 and sin x ~ 1 for all values of x. This is illustrated in Fig. 4. 
Note that - 3n/2 is also a maximum for sin x. 
",/ 2

Example 2. Let f(x) = 2x, and view f as a function defined only on 
the interval 
o ~ x ~ 2. 

[V, §1] 
THE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THEOREM 
161 
Then the function has a maximum at 2 in this interval because f(2) = 4 
and f(x) ~ 4 for all x in the interval. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.

Example 3. Let f(x) = l/x. We know that f is not defined for 
x = O. This function has no maximum. It becomes arbitrarily large 
when x comes close to 0 and x > O. This is illustrated in Fig. 6. 
Figure 6 
Definition. A minimum point for f is a number c such that 
f(x) ~f(c) 
for all x where f is defined. 
A minimum value for the function is the value f(c), taken at a minimum 
point. 
We illustrate various minima with the graphs of certain functions. 
Figure 7 
Figure 8 
In Fig. 7 the function has a minimum. In Fig. 8 the minimum is at 
the end point of the interval. In Figs. 3 and 6 the function has no 
minimum.

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §1] 
In the following picture, the point C I looks like a maximum and the 
point C2 looks like a minimum, provided we stay close to these points, 
and don't look at what happens to the curve farther away. 
Figure 9 
There is a name for such points. We shall say that a point c is a 
local minimum or relative minimum of the function f if there exists an 
interval 
such that fCc) ~f(x) for all numbers x with a l ~ x ~ b l . 
Similarly, we define the notion of local maximum or relative maxi-
mum. (Do it yourself.) In Fig. 9, the point C3 is a local maximum, C4 is 
a local minimum, and C5 is a local maximum. 
The actual maximum and minimum occur at the end points. 
Using basic properties of numbers, one can prove the next theorem 
which is, however, rather obvious, and so we omit the proof. 
Theorem 1.1. Let f be a continuous function over a closed interval 
[a, b]. Then there exists a point in the interval where f has a maxi-
mum, and there exists a point where f has a minimum. 
We wish to have some ideas of the range of values of the gIven 
function. The next theorem tells us this information. 
Theorem 1.2. Intermediate value theorem. Let f be a continuous func-
tion on the interval [a, b]. Let rx = f(a) and /3 = feb). Let y be a 
number between rx and /3. For instance, if rx < /3, let (1. < Y < /3, and if 
rx > /3 then let 
rx> y > /3. 
Then there exists a number c such that a < c < b and such that 
fCc) = y. 
The theorem is intuitively obvious since a continuous function has no 
breaks. It is illustrated on the figure. 

[V, §1] 
THE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THEOREM 
163 
The proof belongs to the range of ideas in the appendix on epsilon-delta 
and can safely be omitted. Observe that there may be several points c in 
the interval [a, b] such that f(c) = y. In the figure, there are three such 
points, labeled c1, c2 , C3' 
As we have mentioned, the point where f has a maximum may occur 
at the end points of the interval. However, when such a point is not an 
end point, and the function is differentiable, then we are in a situation 
similar to that of Fig. 4 or 9, where we see that the tangent to the curve 
at that point is a horizontal line; in other words the derivative of the 
function is O. We can prove this as a theorem. 
Theorem 1.3. Let f be a function which is defined and differentiable in 
the open interval a < x < b. Let c be a number in the interval at which 
the function has a local maximum or a local minimum. Then 
f'(c) = O. 
Proof We give the proof in the case of a local maximum. If we take 
small values of h (positive or negative), the number c + h will lie in the 
interval. We are going to find the limit of the Newton quotient as we 
approach c from the right and from the left, and in that way, determine 
the value f'(c).

Let us first take h positive (see Fig. 10). We must have

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §1] 
no matter what h is (provided h is small) since f(c) is the local maxI-
mum. Therefore f(c + h) - f(c) ;£ 0. Since h > 0, the Newton quotient 
satisfies 
f(c + h1- f(c) ;£ 0. 
Hence the limit is ;£ 0, or in symbols: 
lim f(c + h) - f(c) ~ 0.

h>O 
Now take h negative, say h = - k with k > 0. Then 
f(c - k) - f(c) ;£ 0, 
and the quotient is 
f(c - k) - f(c) 
-k 
f(c) - f(c - k) ~ ° 
f(c) - f(c - k)

Thus the Newton quotient is 
~ 0. Taking the limit as h (or k) ap-
proaches 0, we see that 
lim f(c + h1- f(c) ~ 0. 
h-O 
h<O 
The only way in which our two limits can be equal is that they should 
both be 0. Therefore f'(c) = 0. This concludes the proof. 
We can interpret our arguments geometrically by saying that the line 
between our two points slants up to the left when we take h > ° and 
slants up to the right when we take h < 0. As h approaches 0, both lines 
must approach the tangent line to the curve. The only way this is pos-
sible is for the tangent line at the point whose x-coordinate is c to be 
horizontal. This means that its slope is 0, i.e. f'(c) = 0. 
In practice, a function usually has only a finite number of critical 
points, and it is easy to find all points c such that f'(c) = 0. One can 
then determine by inspection which of these are maxima, which are 
minima, and which are neither. 
Example 4. Find the critical points of the function f(x) = x 3 -
1. 
We have f'(x) = 3x2• Hence there is only one critical point, namely 
x = 0, since 3x2 = ° only when x = 0.

Let f be a function defined on some interval (which may be open or 
closed). 
Definition. We shall say that f is increasing over this interval if 
whenever Xl and X 2 are two points of the interval such that 
Thus, if a number lies to the right of another, the value of the func-
tion at the larger number must be greater than or equal to the value of 
the function at the smaller number. 
In the next figure, we have drawn the graph of an increasing function.

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §2] 
We say that a function defined on some interval is decreasing over 
this interval if 
whenever Xl and X 2 are two points of the interval such that Xl ~ x 2 . 
Observe that a constant function (whose graph is horizontal) is both 
increasing and decreasing. 
If we want to omit the equality sign in our definitions, we shall use 
the word strictly to qualify decreasing or increasing. Thus a function f is 
strictly increasing if 
implies 
and f is strictly decreasing if 
implies 
Suppose that a function has a positive derivative throughout an inter-
val, as shown for instance on Fig. 11. Then we can interpret this as 
meaning that the rate of change of the function is always positive, and 
therefore that the function is increasing. We state this as a theorem. 
Theorem 2.1. Let f be a function which is continuous in some interval, 
and differentiable in the interval (excluding the end points). 
If f'(x) > 0 in the interval (excluding the end points), then f is 
strictly increasing. 
If f'(x) < 0 in the interval (excluding the end points), then f is 
strictly decreasing. 
If f'(x) = 0 in the interval (excluding the end points), then f is con-
stant. 
In this last statement, the hypothesis that f'(x) = 0 in the interval 
means that the rate of change is 0, and so it is quite plausible that the 
function is constant. To see how these statements fit into a more formal 
context, see §3. 
Application. Graphs of parabolas 
Example. Let us graph the curve 
y = f(x) = x 2 -
3x + 5, 
which you should know is a parabola as in Chapter II. We treat the 

[V, §2] 
INCREASING AND DECREASING FUNCTIONS 
167 
graph here by the method which works in more general cases. First, we 
have 
f'(x) = 2x - 3, 
and 
f'(x) = 0 
if and only if 
x = 3/2, 
so 
x = 3/2 is the only 
critical point. 
f'(x) > 0 
if and only if 
2x-3>0 
if and only if 
x> 3/2. 
f'(x) < 0 
if and only if 
x < 3/2. 
Thus the function is strictly increasing for x > 3/2 and strictly decreasing 
for x < 3/2. Thus by using the derivative, we are able to find the peak 
of the parabola. 
The points where f(x) = 0, that is where the graph crosses the x-axis, 
are given by the quadratic formula: 
3 ± J9=2O 
3 ± J=Tl 
x= 
2 
= 
2 
. 
There are no such points. The graph therefore looks like this. 
J. 2 
Observe that even if we did not know before the general shape of a 
parabola, we could deduce it now, and we would know that x = 3/2 is a 
minimum point of the graph. This is because f(x) is strictly decreasing 
for x < 3/2 and strictly increasing for x > 3/2. Thus x = 3/2 must be a 
minimum. 
Example. Sketch the graph of 
y = f(x) = x 2 -
5x + 9/4. 

168 
THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §2] 
This time, we have 
f'(x) = 2x - 5. 
Hence there is exactly one critical point, namely: 
f'(x) = 0 
if and only if 
x = 5/2. 
f'(x) > 0 
if and only if 
2x-5>O 
if and only if 
x> 5/2. 
f'(x) < 0 
if and only if 
2x-5<O 
if and only if 
x < 5/2. 
So f is strictly increasing for x > 5/2 and strictly decreasing for x < 5/2. 
Hence f has a minimum at x = 5/2.

Definition. The x-intercepts of the graph of f are also called the roots 
of f. In the case of a quadratic polynomial the roots are computed 
by the quadratic formula. 
Therefore the graph of f looks like this. 
In the above examples, the function was defined for all numbers. In 
the next example, we look at a function defined only over an interval. 
Example. Let f(x) = x2 -
5x + 9/4. 
Find the minimum and maxi-
mum of f for x ~ 2. 

[V, §2] 
INCREASING AND DECREASING FUNCTIONS 
169 
By the preceding example, we know that f is strictly decreasing for 
x ~ 2. Therefore the minimum is at the end point of the interval, that is 
x = 2, as shown on the figure. Note that at this end point, /,(2) =1= o. 
Thus the test with critical points is valid only on open intervals. 
The expression "if and only if" will recur quite frequently. We shall 
therefore use an abbreviating symbol for it, and we write 
to mean, 
"if and only if." 
Thus we could write the assertion: 
x 2 = 3 
<=> 
x = J3 or x = - J3. 
Similarly, 
x 2 -
3x + 1 = 0

Example. Show that among all rectangles of given area, the one with 
least perimeter is a square. 
Let a be the given area, and let x be the length of one side of the 
possible rectangle with area a. We shall express the perimeter as a func-
tion f(x). We then differentiate with respect to x, keeping in mind that a 
is constant, and this will give us a value for x which will show that the 
rectangle is a square. To carry this out, we take 0 < x because the side 
of an actual rectangle cannot be 0 or have negative length. If y is the 
length of the other side, then xy = a, so that y = a/x is the length of the 
other side. Hence the perimeter is 

170 
THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §2] 
We have 
f'(x) = 2( 1 - :2). 
and: 
f'(x) = 0 
<=> 
<=>x 2 -a=O 
<=>x = Ja, 
because we consider only x > O. Thus the only critical point of f for 
x > 0 is when x = Ja. Furthermore x 2 > 0 for all x =1= O. Hence the 
fraction (x 2 -
a)/x 2 is positive if and only if its numerator x 2 -
a is 
positive. Thus: 
Hence: 
f'(x) > 0 
<=> 
x 2 -
a > 0 
<=> 
x 2 > a 
<=> 
x > Ja, 
f'(x) < 0 
<=> 
x 2 -
a < 0 
<=> 
x 2 < a 
<=> 
x < Ja, 
f is strictly increasing 
<=> x> Ja, 
f is strictly decreasing 
<=> 
x < Ja. 
Hence finally x = Ja is a minimum for f 
When x = Ja we have 
y = Ja also, because 
y = a/x = a/Ja. 
This proves that the rectangle is a square. 
Example. Show that among all rectangular fences with given length, 
the one encompassing the largest area must be a square. 
To do this, let c be the fixed length, and let x be one of the sides. If 
y is the other side, then 
2x + 2y = c, 
so that y = (c - 2x)/2. Therefore the area encompassed by the fence IS 
equal to 
x(c - 2x) 
xc - 2X2

This area A(x) is a function of x, which has a critical point when 
A'(x) = O. But 
A'(x) = !(c - 4x). 
Thus A'(x) = 0 if and only if c = 4x, that is, x = c/4 is the only critical 
point. 
We must now see that this is a maximum. The function 
xc -
2X2 
A(x)= -
-2-
has a graph which is a parabola. When x becomes large positive or 
negative, then A(x) becomes large negative. 
Hence the parabola is 
shaped as in the following figure. 
It has only one maximum, and that maximum must therefore be at 
x = c/4. We then find that y = c/4 also. In other words, the fence must 
be a square. 
Inequalities 
The derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions can also be 
used to prove inequalities. 
Example. Prove that sin x < x for all x > O. 
Let f(x) = x - sin x. Then 
f'(x) = I - cos x. 
First take 0 < x < n/2. Then f'(x) > 0 because cos x < 1 in this interval. 
Therefore f(x) is strictly increasing for 0 ~ x ~ n/2. But 
f(O) = 0 - sin 0 = O. 
Hence we must have f(x) > 0 for 0 < x ~ n12. 

172 
THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §2] 
If X ~ n/2, then x > 1 (because n is approximately 3.14), and so 
sin x < x whenever x > n/2. 
Thus the desired inequality holds for 
simpler reasons when x > n/2. 
The preceding example illustrates a technique which is used for prov-
ing certain inequalities between functions. In general: 
Suppose we have two functions f and 9 over a certain interval 
[a, b] and we assume that f, g are differentiable. Suppose that 
f(a) ~ g(a), 
and that f'(x) ~ g'(x) throughout the interval. Then f(x) ~ g(x) in 
the interval. 
Proof We let 
h(x) = g(x) - f(x). 
Then by assumption, 
h'(x) = g'(x) - f'(x) ~ 0, 
so h is increasing throughout the interval. Since 
h(a) = g(a) - f(a) ~ 0, 
it follows that h(x) ~ 0 throughout the interval, whence 
g(x) ~ f(x). 
The principle just stated can be visualized in the following picture, 
drawn for the case when f(a) = g(a). 
!(a) = g(a) 
a 
Figure 12 
In other words, if 9 is bigger than or equal to f at x = a, and if g 
grows faster than f, then g(x) is bigger than f(x) for all x > a. 

[V, §2] 
INCREASING AND DECREASING FUNCTIONS

Example. Show that for any integer n ~ 1 and any number x ~ 1 
one has the inequality 
xn - 1 ~ n(x - 1). 
Let f(x) = xn -
1 - n(x -
1). Then 
f'(x) = nx·- I -
n. 
Since x ~ 1 it follows that x·- I ~ 1 and so f'(x) ~ O. Hence f is 
increasing for x ~ 1. But f(1) = O. Hence f(x) ~ 0 for x ~ 1. This is 
equivalent to the desired inequality. 
On the other hand, the next theorem tells us what happens if two 
functions have the same derivative throughout an interval. 
Constants 
Theorem 2.2. Let f(x) and g(x) be two functions which are differenti-
able in some interval and assume that 
f'(x) = g'(x) 
for all x in the interval. Then there is a constant C such that 
f(x) = g(x) + C 
for all x in the interval. 
Proof Let h(x) = f(x) - g(x) be the difference of our two functions. 
Then 
h'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x) = O. 
Hence h(x) is constant by Theorem 2.1, that IS h(x) = C for some 
number C and all x. This proves the theorem. 
Remark. The theorem is the converse of the statement: 
If a function is constant, then its derivative is equal to O. 
We shall use Theorem 2.2 in a fundamental way when we come to the 
chapter on integration. 
For the applications of the theorem, see the beginning of the chapter 
on logarithms, and also the beginning of Chapter X, §l. We give simpler 
applications here.

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §2] 
Example. Let f be a function of x such that f'(x) = 5. Suppose that 
f(O) = 2. Determine f(x) completely. 
We know from past experience that the function 
g(x) = 5x 
has the derivative 
g'(x) = 5. 
Hence there is constant C such that 
f(x) = 5x + C. 
We are also given f(O) = 2. Hence 
2 = f(O) = 0 + C. 
Therefore C = 2. Thus finally 
f(x) = 5x + 2. 
Example. A particle moves on the x-axis toward the left at a rate of 
5 em/sec. At time t = 5 the particle is at the point 8 em to the right of 
the origin. Determine the x-coordinate x = f(t) completely as a function 
of time. 
We are given 
dx 
dt = f'(t) = - 5. 
Let g(t) = - 5t. Then g'(t) = - 5 also. Hence there is a constant C such 
that 
f(t) = -5t + c. 
But we are also given f(5) = 8. Hence 
8 = - 5 . 5 + C = - 25 + C. 
Therefore C = 8 + 25 = 33, so finally 
f(t) = -5t + 33.

V, §3. THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
The theorems in this section are fairly obvious intuitively, and therefore 
you might omit the proofs of Rolle's theorem and Theorem 3.2 if you 
wish, after understanding their statement. 

[V, §3] 
THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
177 
First suppose we have a function over a closed interval [a, b], whose 
graph looks like this. 
b 
Figure 13 
Then we have the following theorem about this function. 
Theorem 3.1. Rolle's theorem. Let a, b be two numbers, a < b. Let f 
be a function which is continuous over the closed interval 
and differentiable on the open interval a < x < b. Assume that 
f(a) = f(b) = O. 
Then there exists a point c such that 
a<c<b 
and such that !'(c) = o. 
Proof If the function is constant in the interval, then its derivative is 
o and any point in the open interval a < x < b will do. 
If the function is not constant, then there exists some point in the 
interval where the function is not 0, and this point cannot be one of the 
end points a or b. Suppose that some value of our function is positive. 
By Theorem 1.1, the function has a maximum at a point c. Then f(c) 
must be greater than 0, and c cannot be either one of the end points 
because f(a) = f(b) = O. Consequently 
a < c < b. 
By Theorem 1.3, we must have I'(c) = O. This proves our theorem in 
case the function is positive somewhere in the interval. 
If the function is negative for some number in the interval, then we 
use Theorem 1.1 to get a minimum, and we argue in a similar way, using 
Theorem 1.3 (applied to a minimum). (Write out the argument in full as 
an exercise.)

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §3] 
Let f(x) be a function which is differentiable for a < x < b, and 
continuous in the closed interval 
a ~ x ~ b. 
We continue to assume throughout that a < b. This time we do not 
assume, as in Theorem 3.1, that f(a) = f(b) = O. We shall prove that 
there exists a point c between a and b such that the slope of the tangent 
line at (c,j(c» is the same as the slope of the line between the end 
points of our graph. In other words, the tangent line is parallel to the 
line passing through the end points of our graph .

The slope of the line between the two end points is

because the coordinates of the end points are (a,j(a» and (b,j(b» 
respectively. Thus we have to find a point c such that 
Theorem 3.2. Mean value theorem. Let a < b as before. Let f be a 
function which is continuous in the closed interval a ~ x ~ b, and differ-
entiable in the interval a < x < b. Then there exists a point c such that 
a < c < band 
f'(c) = f(b) - f(a).

Proof The equation of the line between the two end points is

is the coefficient of x. When x = a, y = f(a). Hence we have written 
down the equation of the line having the given slope and passing 
through a given point. When x = b, we note that y = f(b). 
We now consider geometrically the difference between f(x) and the 
straight line. This difference becomes 0 at the end points. This geomet-
ric idea will allow us to apply Rolle's theorem. In other words, we 
consider the function 
f(b) - f(a) 
g(x) = f(x) -
b 
(x - a) - f(a). 
-a 
Then 
g(a) = f(a) - f(a) = 0 
and 
g(b) = f(b) - f(b) = 0 
also. 
We can therefore apply Theorem 3.1 to the function g(x). We know 
that there is a point c between a and b, and not equal to a or b, such 
that 
But 
Consequently 
g'(c) = O. 
g'(x) = f'(x) _ f(b) - f(a). 
b-a 
0= g'(c) = f'(c) _ f(b) - f(a). 
b-a 
This gives us the desired value for f'(c), and concludes the proof. 
The point of the mean value theorem is not so much to find explicitly 
a value c such that 
as to use it for theoretical considerations. 
Corollary 3.3. Let f be a function which is differentiable in some inter-
val, and such that f'(x) = 0 for all x in the interval. Then f is constant. 

180 
THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM 
[V, §3] 
Proof Let a, b be distinct numbers in the interval. By the mean value 
theorem, there exists c between a and b such that 
But f'(c) = 0 by assumption. 
Hence f(b) - f(a) = 0 and therefore 
f(b) = f(a). Hence f has the same value at all points of the interval, so 
f is constant, as was to be shown. 
Similarly, we may now give the rest of the proof of Theorem 2.1 from 
the preceding section: 
Corollary 3.4. If f'(x) > 0 for x in an interval, excluding the end 
points, and f is continuous in the interval, then f is strictly increasing. 
Proof Let Xl and X2 be two points of the interval, and suppose 
Xl < x 2 • By the mean value theorem, there exists a point c such that 
Xl < c < X2 and 
The difference X2 -
Xl is positive, and we have 
If the derivative f'(x) is > 0 for all X in the interval, excluding the end 
points, then f'(c) > 0 (because c is in the interval). Hence the product 
(X2 - xl)f'(c) is positive, and f(X2) - f(x l) > 0, so that 
This proves that the function is increasing. 
We leave the proof of the assertion concerning decreasing functions as 
an exercIse. 
When we study Taylor's formula, we shall use mean value theorems to 
estimate various functions. Even though we don't know the exact value 
f'(c), we still may have an estimate for the derivative. For instance the 
functions sin X and cos X can both be estimated in absolute value by 1. 
In many applications, this is all that matters. 

CHAPTER 
VI 
Sketching Curves 
We have developed enough techniques to be able to sketch curves and 
graphs of functions much more efficiently than before. We shall inves-
tigate systematically the behavior of a curve, and the mean value 
theorem will play a fundamental role. 
We shall especially look for the following aspects of the curve: 
1. Intersections with the coordinate axes. 
2. 
Critical points. 
3. 
Regions of increase. 
4. 
Regions of decrease. 
5. 
Maxima and minima (including the local ones). 
6. Behavior as x becomes large positive and large negative. 
7. 
Values of x near which y becomes large positive or large negative. 
These seven pieces of information will be quite sufficient to give us a 
fairly accurate idea of what the graph looks like. We shall devote a 
section to considering one other aspect, namely: 
8. Regions where the curve is bending up or down. 
VI, §1. BEHAVIOR AS X BECOMES VERY LARGE 
Suppose we have a function f defined for all sufficiently large numbers. 
Then we get substantial information concerning our function by investi-
gating how it behaves as x becomes large. 
For instance, sin x oscillates between - I and + I no matter how 
large x is. 

182 
SKETCHING CURVES 
[VI, §1] 
However, polynomials don't oscillate. When f(x) = x 2, as x becomes 
large positive, so does x 2. Similarly with the function x 3, or X4 (etc.). 
We consider this systematically. 
Parabolas 
Example 1. Consider a parabola, 
y = ax 2 + bx + c, 
with a -# O. There are two essential cases, when a> 0 and a < O. We 
shall see that the parabola looks like those drawn in the figure. 
y = axl + bx + c 
Case a> 0 
Case a < 0 
We look at numerical examples. 
Example 2. Sketch the graph of the curve 
y =f(x) = -3x 2 + 5x -

We recognize this as a parabola. Factoring out Xl shows that 
f(x) = x 
-3 + - - -
.

X 
x 2 
When x is large positive or negative, then x 2 is large positive and the 
factor on the right is close to - 3. Hence f(x) is large negative. This 
means that the parabola has the shape as shown on the figure. 
We have f'(x) = -6x + 5. Thus f'(x) = 0 if and only if -6x + 5 = 0, 
or in other words, 
x =~. 

[VI, §1] 
BEHAVIOR AS X BECOMES VERY LARGE 
183 
There is exactly one critical point. We have 
The critical point is a maximum, because we have already seen that the 
parabola bends down. 
The curve crosses the x-axis exactly when 
- 3x2 + 5x - 1 = o. 
By the quadratic formula (see Chapter II, §8), this is the case when 
-5 ± J25 - 12 
5 ± Ji3 
X=

Hence the graph of the parabola looks as on the figure. 
The same principle applies to sketching any parabola. 
(i) 
Looking at what happens when x becomes large posItIve or 
negative tells us whether the parabola bends up or down. 
(ii) 
A quadratic function 
f(x) = ax2 + bx + c, 
with 
a oF 0 
has only one critical point, when 
f'(x) = 2ax + b = 0 
so when 
x = -bI2a. 
Knowing whether the parabola bends up or down tells us 
whether the critical point is a maximum or minimum, and the 
value x = - bl2a tells us exactly where this critical point lies. 

184 
SKETCHING CURVES 
[VI, §I] 
(iii) The points where the parabola crosses the x-axis are determined 
by the quadratic formula. 
Example 3. Cubics. Consider a polynomial 
f(x) = x 3 + 2x -
1. 
We can write it in the form 
x 
1+ - --. 
3( 
2 
1 ) 
x 2 
x 3 
When x becomes very large, the expression 
approaches I. In particular, given a small number lJ > 0, we have, for all 
x sufficiently large, the inequality 
2 
1 
1 - b < 1 + - - - < 1 + lJ. 
x 2 
x 3 
Therefore f(x) satisfies the inequality 
This tells us that (x) behaves very much like x3 when x is very large. 
In particular: 
If x becomes large positive, then f(x) becomes large positive. 
If x becomes large negative, then f(x) becomes large negative. 
A similar argument can be applied to any polynomial. 
It is convenient to use an abbreviation for the expression "become 
large positive." Instead of saying x becomes large positive, we write 
and also say that x approaches, or goes to infinity. Warning: there is no 
number called infinity. The above symbols merely abbreviate the notion 
of becoming large positive. We have a similar notation for x becoming 
large negative, when we write 
x-+-oo 

[VI, §1] 
BEHAVIOR AS X BECOMES VERY LARGE 
and say that x approaches minus infinity. Thus in the case when 
we can assert: 
f(x) = x3 + 2x - 1, 
If x -+ 00 
then f(x) -+ 00. 
If x -+ -
00 then f(x) -+ -
00 . 
Example 4. Consider a quotient of polynomials like 
x3 + 2x - 1 
Q(x) = 2x3 _ X + 1· 
185 
We factor out the highest power of x from the numerator and denomi-
nator, and therefore write Q(x) in the form 
As x becomes very large, the numerator approaches 1 and the denomina-
tor approaches 2. Thus our fraction approaches t. We may express this 
in the form 
. 
1 
hm Q(x) = - . 
x- oo 
2 
Or we may write: 
If x -+ ± 00 then Q(x) -+ t. 
Example 5. Consider the quotient 
x 2 -
1 
Q(x) = x3 _ 2x + 1· 
Does it approach a limit as x becomes very large? 
We write 
Q(x) = x3(1 _ 2/X2 + l /x3) 
1 -
l /x2 

186 
SKETCHING CURVES 
[VI, §l] 
As x becomes large, the term l/x approaches 0, and the other factor 
approaches 1. Hence Q(x) approaches 0 as x becomes large negative or 
positive. 
or 
We may also write 
If x --+ ± 00 then Q(x) --+ 0, 
lim Q(x) = O. 
x-+±oo 
Example 6. Consider the quotient 
x 3 -
1 
Q(x)= --
x2 + 5 
and determine what happens when x becomes large. 
We write 
x3( 1 - 1/x3) 
Q(x) = x2(1 + 5/x 2 ) 
1 - 1/x3 
= X -----'---:;: 
1 + 5/x 2 ' 
As x becomes large, positive or negative, the quotient 
approaches 1. Hence Q(x) differs from x by a factor near 1. Hence Q(x) 
becomes large positive when x is large positive, and becomes large nega-
tive when x is large negative. We may express this by saying: 
If x --+ 00 
then Q(x) --+ 00. 
If x --+ -
00 then Q(x) --+ -
00. 
We may also write these assertions in the form of a limit: 
lim Q(x) = 00 
and 
lim Q(x) = - 00. 
However, even though we use this notation, and may say that the limit 
of Q(x) is - 00 when x becomes large negative, we emphasize that - 00 
is not a number, and so this limit is not quite the same as when the 

[VI, §1] 
BEHAVIOR AS X BECOMES VERY LARGE 
187 
limit is a number. It is correct to say that there is no number which is 
the limit of Q(x) as x -+ 00 or as x -+ -
00. 
These four examples are typical of what happens when we deal with 
quotients of polynomials. 
Later when we deal with exponents and logarithms, we shall again 
meet the problem of comparing the quotient of two expressions which 
become large. There will be a common ground for some of the argu-
ments, summarized by the following table: 
Large positive times large positive is large positive. 
Large positive times large negative is large negative. 
Large negative times large negative is large positive. 
Small positive times large positive: you can't tell without knowing 
more information.

VI, §2. BENDING UP AND DOWN 
Let a, b be numbers, a < b. Let f be a continuous function defined 
on the interval [a, b]. Assume that f' and f" exist on the interval 
a < x < b. We view the second derivative f" as the rate of change of the 
slope of the curve y = f(x) over the interval. If the second derivative is 
positive in the interval a < x < b, then the slope of the curve is increas-
ing, and we interpret this as meaning that the curve is bending up. If the 
second derivative is negative, we interpret this as meaning that the curve 
is bending down. The following two figures illustrate this. 
Bending up 
Bending down 
Example l. The curve y = x2 is bending up. We can see this using 
the second derivative. Let f(x) = x 2 . Then f"(x) = 2, and the second 
derivative is always positive. The present considerations justify drawing 
the curve as we have always done, i.e. bending up. 

[VI, §2] 
BENDING UP AND DOWN 
189 
Example 2. 
Let f(x) = sin x. We have f"(x) = -sin x, and thus 
f"(x) > 0 on the interval n < x < 2n. Hence the curve is bending up on 
this interval. Similarly, f"(x) < 0 on the interval 0 < x < n. Hence the 
curve is bending down on this interval, as shown on the next figures. Of 
course, this merely justifies the drawings which we have always made for 
the graph of the sine function. 
bending up 
bending down 
Example 3. Determine the intervals where the curve 
y = _x 3 + 3x - 5 
is bending up and bending down. 
Let f(x) = _x 3 + 3x - 5. Then f"(x) = -6x. Thus: 
f"(x) > 0 
<=> 
x < 0, 
f"(x) < 0 
<=> 
x> O. 
Hence f is bending up if and only if x < 0; and f is bending down if and 
only if x > O. The graph of this curve will be discussed fully in the next 
section when we graph cubics systematically. 
A point where a curve changes its behavior from bending up to down 
(or vice versa) is called an inflection point. If the curve is the graph of a 
function f whose second derivative exists and is continuous, then we 
must have f"(x) = 0 at that point. The following picture illustrates this: 
4IWnpo'"t 
In Example 3 above, the point (0, - 5) is an inflection point. 

190 
SKETCHING CURVES 
[VI, §2] 
The determination of regions of bending up or down and inflection 
points gives us worthwhile pieces of information concerning curves. For 
instance, knowing that a curve in a region of decrease is actually bending 
down tells us that the decrease occurs essentially as in this example: 
and not as in these examples: 
The second derivative can also be used as a test whether a critical 
point is a local maximum or minimum. 
Second derivative test. Let f be twice continuously differentiable on an 
open interval, and suppose that c is a point where 
!'(c) = 0 
and 
f"(c) > O. 
Then c is a local minimum point of f On the other hand, if 
f"(c) < 0 
then c is a local maximum point of f 
To see this, suppose that f"(c) > O. Then f"(x) > 0 for all x close to c 
because we assumed that the second derivative is continuous. Thus the 
curve is bending up. Consequently the picture of the graph of f is as on 
Fig. l(a) and c is a local minimum.

and the x-intercepts of the graph of g are precisely the critical points of

maximum for J, and J2j3 is a local minimum.

down for x < O. There is an inflection point at x = O. 
Putting all this together, we find that the graph of f looks like this. 
graph of 
f(x) = x 3 - 2x + 1 

[VI, §3] 
CUBIC POLYNOMIALS 
193 
Observe how we used a quadratic polynomial, namely f'(x) = 3x2 -
2, 
as an intermediate step in the arguments. 
Remark 1. Instead of using the quadratic polynomial, we can also 
argue as follows, after we know that the only critical points of f 
are x =.j2i3 and x = -.j2i3. Consider the interval x < -.j2i3. 
Then f'(x) # 0 for all x < J -2/3. Hence f'(x) is either > 0 for all 
x < -.j2i3, or f'(x) < 0 for all x < -.j2i3 by the intermediate value 
theorem. Which is it? We just try one value, say with x = -10, to see 
that f'(x) > ° for 
x < -J2j3, because 1'(-10) = 3.102 - 2 = 298. 
Hence we must have I'(x) > 0 for x < -J2j3. 
Remark 2. For a cubic polynomial it is much more difficult to deter-
mine the roots, that is the x-intercepts, and we usually do not do so, 
unless there is a simple way of doing it, by accident. In the above case 
when 
f(x) = x 3 -
2x + 1, 
there is such an accident, since f(l) = O. Therefore 
is a root of f 
Hence f(x) factors 
x3 - 2x + 1 = (x -
1)(x2 + X -
1). 
The other roots of f are the roots of x 2 + x -
1, which can be found by 
the quadratic formula: 
-1 ±J5 
x = 
2 
. 
In the next example, however, there is no such simple way of finding 
the roots, and we do not find them. 
Example 2. Sketch the graph of the curve 
Y = - x3 + 3x - 5. 
1. 
When x = 0, we have y = - 5. With polynomials of degree f; 3 
there is in general no simple formula for those x such that f(x) = 0, so 
we do not give explicitly the intersection of the graph with the x-axis. 
2. 
The derivative is 
f'(x) = -3x2 + 3. 

194 
SKETCHING CURVES 
[VI, §3] 
The graph of f'(x) is a parabola bending down, as you should know 
from previous experience with parabolas. We have 
f'(x) = 0 
~ x2 = 1 
~ x = 1 and x = - I. 
Thus there are two critical points of f, namely x = 1 and x = - I. 
3. 
The graph of f'(x) looks like a parabola bending down, as 
follows.

f'(x) = -3xz + 3 
Then: 
f is strictly decreasing 
~ f'(x) < 0 
~ x < -1 and x>1. 
f is strictly increasing 
~ f'(x) > 0 
~ -l<x<1. 
Therefore f has a local minimum at x = -1, and has a local maximum 
at x = I. 
4. 
If x -+ 00 
then f(x) -+ -
00 by §1. 
If x -+ -
00 then f(x) -+ + 00 by §1. 
5. 
We have f"(x) = -6x. Hence f"(x) > 0 if and only if x < 0 and 
f"(x) < 0 if and only if x > O. There is an inflection point at x = O. 
Putting all this information together, we see that the graph of f looks 
like this:

Remark. When I is a polynomial of degree 3, its derivative f'(x) is a 
polynomial of degree 2, and in general this polynomial has two roots, 
giving the two critical points of the curve y = I(x). In the preceding 
example, these critical points are at (-1, -7) and (1, - 3). 
Again note how we used the graph of a parabola, namely the graph

In the last two examples, the cubic polynomial had two bumps, at the 
two critical points. This is the most general form of cubic polynomials. 
However, there may be special cases, when there is no critical point, or 
only one critical point. 
Example 3(a). Let I(x) = 4x3 + 2. Sketch the graph of f 
Here we have f'(x) = 12x2 > 0 for all x '" O. There is only one critical 
point, when x = O. Hence the function is strictly increasing for all x, and 
its graph looks like this.

Example 3(b). Let I(x) = 4x 3 + 3x. Sketch the graph of f 
Here we have f'(x) = 12x2 + 3 > 0 for all x. Therefore the graph of I 
looks like this. There is no critical point.

Thus in both examples, there is an inflection point at x = O. The graph 
of f bends down for x < 0 and bends up for x > O. The difference be-
tween case (a) and case (b) is that in case (a) the inflection point is a 
critical point, where the derivative of f is equal to 0, so that the curve is 
flat at the critical point. In case (b), the derivative at the inflection point 
IS 
f'(0) = 3, 
so in case (b) the derivative at the inflection point is positive.

We shall now consider quotients of polynomials. 
Example. Sketch the graph of the curve 
x-I 
y=f(x)=-
x+l 
and determine the eight properties stated in the introduction. 
I. When x = 0, we have f(x) = -I. When x = 1, f(x) = 0. 
2. 
The derivative is 
f'(x) = (x: 1)2 ' 
(You can compute it using the quotient rule.) It is never 0, and therefore 
the function f has no critical points. 
3. 
The denominator is a square and hence is always positive, wher-
ever it is defined, that is for x#-- 1. Thus f'(x) > ° for all x#-- 1. 
The function is increasing for all x, Of course, the function is not de-
fined for x = - I and neither is the derivative. Thus it would be more 
accurate to say that the function is increasing in the region 
x <-1 
and is increasing in the region x > - 1. 
4. There is no region of decrease. 
5. 
Since the derivative is never 0, there IS no relative maximum or 
minimum.

SKETCHING CURVES 
6. 
The second derivative is 
-4 
f"(x) = (x + 1)3· 
[VI, §4] 
There is no inflection point since f"(x) # 0 for all x where the function is 
defined. If x < -1, then the denominator (x + 1)3 is negative, and 
f"(x) > 0, so the graph is bending upward. If x> -1, then the de-
nominator is positive, and f"(x) < 0 so the graph is bending downward. 
7. As x becomes large positive, our function approaches 1 (using the 
method of § 1). As x becomes large negative, our function also ap-
proaches 1. 
There is one more useful piece of information which we can look into, 
when f(x) itself becomes large positive or negative. This occurs near 
points where the denominator of f(x) is O. On the present instance, 
x = -1. 
8. 
As x approaches - 1, the denominator approaches 0 and the nu-
merator approaches - 2. If x approaches - 1 from the right so x > - 1, 
then the denominator is positive, and the numerator is negative. Hence 
the fraction 
is negative, and is large negative.

If x approaches -1 from the left so x < -1, then x-I is negative, 
but x + 1 is negative also. Hence f(x) is positive and large, since the 
denominator is small when x is close to - 1. 

[VI, §4J 
RATIONAL FUNCTIONS 
199 
Putting all this information together, we see that the graph looks like 
that in the preceding figure. 
We have drawn the two lines x = -1 and y = 1, as these play an 
important role when x approaches -I and when x becomes large, posi-
tive or negative. 
Remark. Again let 
x-I 
Y = f(x) = ~-. 
x+l 
Then we can rewrite this relation to see directly that the graph of f is a 
hyperbola, as follows. We write the relation in the form 
x+I-2 
2 
Y= x+l =l-x+I' 
that is, y - 1 = - 2/(x + I). Clearing denominators, this gives 
(y -
l)(x + 1) = -2. 
By Chapter II, you should know that this is a hyperbola. We worked 
out a sketch by a more general method, because it also works in cases 
when you cannot reduce the equation to one of the standard curves, like 
circles, parabolas, or hyperbolas.

Example. Sketch the graph of f(x) = --.

Note that f is not defined at x = 1. We can rewrite 
f(x) = x(x + 1). 
x-I 
We have f(x) = 0 if and only if the numerator x(x + 1) = O. Thus: 
f(x) = 0 if and only if 
x = 0 or x = -1. 
Next we look at the derivative, which is 
f'(x) = x 2 -

(Compute it using the quotient rule.) Then 
f'(x) = 0 
<=> 
x 2 - 2x - 1 = 0, 
<=> 
x = 1 ± j2 
(by the quadratic formula) 
These are the critical points of f 
The denominator (x -
1)2 in f'(x) is a square and hence is always 
positive, wherever it is defined, that is for x :1= 1. Therefore the sign of 
f'(x) is the same as the sign of its numerator x 2 - 2x -
1. Let 
g(x) = x 2 - 2x -
1. 
The graph of g is a parabola, and since the coefficient of x 2 is 1 > 0, 
this parabola is bending up as shown on the figure. 
The two roots of g(x) = 0 are x = 1 - j2 and 1 + j2. From the graph 
of g(x) we see that 
g(x) < 0 
g(x) > 0 
when 
when 
1 - j2 < x < 1 + j2, 
x < 1 - j2 or x > 1 + j2. 
This gives us the regions of increase and decrease for f(x). 
For x ~ 1 - j2, 
f(x) is strictly increasing. 
For 1 - j2 ~ x < I, f(x) is strictly decreasing. 
For 
l<x~l+j2, f(x) is strictly decreasing. 
For 
1 + j2 ~ x, 
f(x) is strictly increasing. 
It follows that f has a local maximum at x = 1 - J2 and f has a local 
minimum at x = 1 + j2.

As x becomes large positive, f(x) becomes large positive as is seen 
from the expression 
f(x) = x 2 + X = x 2(1 + l/x) = x 1 + l/x.

x(1 - l/x)

As x becomes large negative, f(x) becomes large negative. 
As x approaches 1 and x < 1, the function f(x) becomes large nega-
tive because the denominator x-I approaches 0, and is negative, while 
the numerator x 2 + x approaches 2. 
As x approaches 1 and x > 1, the function f(x) becomes large positive 
because the denominator x-I approaches 0 and both numerator and 
denominator are positive, while the numerator approaches 2. 
Hence the graph looks as drawn on Fig. 3.

VI, §5. APPLIED MAXIMA AND MINIMA 
This section deals with word problems concerning maxima and minima, 
and applies the techniques discussed previously. In each case, we want 
to maximize or minimize a function, which is at first given in terms of 
perhaps two variables. We proceed as follows. 
1. Enough data are given so that one of these variables can be 
expressed in terms of the other, by some relation. We end up dealing 
with a function of only one variable. 
2. 
We then find its critical points, setting the derivative equal to 0, 
and then determine whether the critical points are local maxima 
or minima. 
3. 
We verify if these local maxima or minima are also maxima or 
minima for the whole interval of definition of the function. If the 
function is given only on some finite interval, it may happen that 
the maximum, say, occurs at an end point, where the derivative 
test does not apply. 
Example 1. Find the point on the graph of the equation y2 = 4x 
which is nearest to the point (2, 3). 
Figure 4 

[VI, §5] 
APPLIED MAXIMA AND MINIMA 
203 
To minimize the distance between a point (x, y) and (2, 3), it suffices 
to minimize the square of the distance, which has the advantage that no 
square root occurs in its formula. Indeed, suppose z~ is a minimum 
value for the square of the distance, with Zo positive. Then Zo itself is a 
minimum value for the distance, because a positive number has a unique 
positive square root. The square of the distance is equal to 
Thus Z2 is expressed in terms of the two variables x, y. But we know 
that the point (x, y) lies on the curve whose equation is y2 = 4x. Hence 
we can solve for one variable in terms of the other, namely y = 2Jx. 
Substituting y = 2Jx, we find an expression for the square of the dis-
tance only in terms of x, namely 
f(x) = (2 -
X)2 + (3 - 2Jx? 
= 4 - 4x + x2 + 9 - 12Jx + 4x 
= 13 + x 2 - 12Jx. 
We now determine the critical points of f. We have 
f'(x) = 2x - fx' 
so 
f'(x) = 0 
<=> 
2xJx = 6 
<=> 
x =.y9. 
Furthermore, we have 
f'(x) > 0 
<=> 
2xJx > 6 
<=> 
x 3 > 9. 
f'(x) < 0 
<=> 
x 3 < 9. 
Hence f(x) is strictly increasing when x > z;9 and strictly decreasing 
when x < z;9. Hence z;9 is a minimum. When x = z;9 the correspond-
ing value for y is 
Hence the point on the graph of y2 = 4x closest to (2, 3) is the point 
p = (z;9, 213)·

Example 2. An oil can is to be made in the form of a cylinder to 
contain one quart of oil. What dimensions should it have so that the 
surface area is minimal (in other words, minimize the cost of material to 
make the can)? 
Let r be the radius of the base of the cylinder and let h be its height. 
Then the volume is 
The total surface area is the sum of the top, bottom, and circular sides, 
namely 
A = 21[r2 + 21[rh. 
Thus the area is given in terms of the two variables rand h. However, 
we are also given that the volume V is constant, V = 1. Thus we get a 
relation between rand h, 
and we can solve for h in terms of r, namely 
Hence the area can be expressed entirely in terms of r, that is 
A = 21[r2 + 21[r/1[r2 = 21[r2 + 2/r. 
We want the area to be minimum. We first find the critical points of A. 
We have: 
A'(r) = 41[r - 2/r2 = 0 
<=> 
41[r = 2/r2 
Thus we find exactly one critical point 
By physical considerations, we could see that this corresponds to a mini-
mum, but we can also argue as follows. When r becomes large positive, 
or when r approaches 0, the function A(r) becomes large, and so there 

[VI, §5] 
APPLIED MAXIMA AND MINIMA 
205 
has to be a minimum of the function for some value r > O. This mini-
mum is a critical point, and we have found that there is only one critical 
point. Hence we have found that the minimum occurs when r is the 
critical point. In this case we can solve back for h, namely 
This gives us the required dimensions. 
Example 3. A truck is to be driven 200 mi at constant speed x mph. 
Speed laws require 30 ~ x ~ 60. Assume that gasoline costs 50 centsl 
gallon and is consumed at the rate of 
x 2 
3 + 500 gal/hr. 
If the driver's wages are $8 per hour, find the most economical speed. 
We express the total cost as a sum of the cost of gasoline and the 
wages. The total time taken for the trip will be 
200 
x 
because (time)(speed) = (distance) if the speed is constant. The cost of 
gas is then equal to the product of 
(price per gallon)(number of gallons used per hr)(total time)

Therefore f'(x) = 0 if and only if 
or in other words, 
x2 = 9500. 
Thus x = 1OJ9s. [We take x positive since this is the solution which 
has physical significance.] 
Now we observe that 1OJ9s is approximately equal to 10 x 10, and 
in any case is > 60, so is beyond the speed limit of 60 which was 
assigned to begin with. Furthermore, if 0 < x < 1OJ9s then 
f'(x) < O. 
Hence the function f(x) is decreasing for 0 ~ x ~ 1OJ9s. Its graph may 
be sketched as on the figure.

30 ~ x ~ 60, it follows that the minimum of f over this interval must

207 
occur when x = 60. This is therefore the speed which minimizes the total 
cost. 
Example 4. In the preceding example, suppose there is no speed limit. 
Then we see that if x > 10)95 then f'(x) > 0 so that f(x) is increasing 
for 
x> 10)95. 
Therefore 10)95 is a minimum point for f when no restriction is placed 
on x. Consequently, in this case, the speed which minimizes the cost is 
x = 10)95. 
Example 5. When light from a point source strikes a plane surface, 
the intensity of illumination is proportional to the cosine of the angle of 
incidence, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from 
the source. How high should a light be located above the center of a 
circle of radius 12 ft to give the best illumination along the circumfer-
ence? 
The angle of incidence is measured from the perpendicular to the 
plane. The picture is as follows. 
Figure 5 
We denote by () the angle of incidence, and by y the height of the light. 
Let I be the intensity of illumination. Two quantities are proportional

The critical points of I(y) are those points where J'(y) = O. We have: 
and this expression is equal to 0 precisely when the numerator is equal 
to 0, that is, 
Canceling (122 + i)112, we see that this is equivalent to 
or in other words, 
Solving for y yields 
12 
y = ± Ji' 
Only the positive value of y has physical significance, and thus the height 
giving maximum intensity is 12/Ji ft, provided that we know that this 
critical point is a maximum for the function I(y), for y > O. This can be 
seen as follows. 
If y is very close to 0, then the numerator cy of I(y) is close to 0, and 
the denominator (122 + y2)312 is close to (122)312 so I(y) tends to 0 when 
y is near O. For large y, the denominator of I(y) is analyzed by factoring 
out y2, namely 
Therefore I(y) tends to 0 as y becomes large, because 
I (y) = __

if y is large positive. Hence we have shown that I(y) tends to 0 when y 
approaches 0 or y becomes large. It follows that I(y) reaches a maxi-
mum for some value of y > 0, and this maximum must be a critical 
point. On the other hand, we have also proved that there is only one 
critical point. Hence this critical point is the maximum, as desired. Thus 
y = 12/Ji is a maximum for the function. In view of the preceding 
discussion, the graph can be sketched as on the figure.

$400. The total cost of marketing x units is 
f(x) = 0.02X2 + 160x + 400,000. 
How many transmissions should be sold for maximum profit? 
Let P(x) be the profit coming from selling x units. Then P(x) is the 
difference between the total receipts and the cost of marketing. Hence 
P(x) = 400x - (0.02X2 + 160x + 400,000) 
= - 0.02X2 + 240x - 400,000. 
We want to know when P(x) is maximum. We have: 
P'(x) = -0.04x + 240 
so the derivative is 0 when 
0.04x = 240,

x = 0.04 = 6,000. 
The equation y = P(x) is a parabola, which bends down because the

Example 7. A farmer buys a bull weighing 600 lbs, at a cost of $180. 
It costs IS cents per day to feed the animal, which gains 1 lb per day. 
Every day that the bull is kept, the sale price per pound declines 
according to the formula 
B(t) = 0.4S - 0.0002St 
where t is the number of days. How long should the farmer wait to 
maximize profits? 
To do this, note that the total cost after time t is given by 
f(t) = 180 + O.1St. 
The total sales amount to the product of the price B(t) per pound times 
the weight of the animal, in other words, 
Hence the profit is 
Therefore 
S(t) = (O.4S - 0.0002St)(600 + t) 
= -0.0002St2 + 0.30t + 270. 
P(t) = S(t) - f(t) 
= -0.0002St2 + O.ISt + 90. 
P'(t) = -O.OOOSt + O.IS 
and P'(t) = 0 exactly when O.OOOSt = O.1S, or in other words, 
O.1S 
t = -- = 300. 
O.OOOS 
Hence the answer is 300 days for the farmer to wait before selling the 
bull, provided we can show that this value of t gives a maximum. But 
the formula for the profit is a quadratic expression in t, of the form 
P(t) = at2 + bt + c, 
and a < O. 
Hence P(t) is a parabola, and since a < 0 this parabola 
opens downward as on the figure. Hence the critical point must be a 
maximum, as desired.

CHAPTER 
VII 
Inverse Functions 
Suppose that we have a function, for instance 
Y = 3x - 5. 
Then we can solve for x in terms of y, namely 
x =!<y + 5). 
Thus x can be expressed as a function of y. 
Although we are able to solve by means of an explicit formula, there 
are interesting cases where x can be expressed as a function of y, but 
without such an explicit formula. In this chapter, we shall investigate 
such cases. 
VII, §1. DEFINITION OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS 
Let y = f(x) be a function, defined for all x in some interval. If, for each 
value Yl of y, there exists exactly one value Xl of x in the interval such 
that f(x l ) = Yl' then we can define the inverse function 
x = g(y) = the unique number x such that y = f(x). 
Our inverse function is defined only at those numbers which are 
values of f We have the fundamental relation 
f(g(y) = y 
and 
g(f(x) = x. 

[VII, §1] 
DEFINITION OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS 
217 
Example 1. Consider the function Y = X2, which we view as being 
defined only for x ~ O. Every positive number (or 0) can be written 
uniquely as the square of a positive number (or 0). Hence we can define 
the inverse function, which will also be defined for y ~ 0, but not for 
y < O. It is the square root function, x = .;y. 
Example 2. Suppose that y = 5x - 7. Then we can solve for x m 
terms of y, namely 
x = !<y + 7). 
If f(x) = 5x - 7, then its inverse function is the function g(y) such that 
g(y) = !(y + 7). 
In these examples, we could write down the inverse function by explic-
it formulas. In general, this is not possible, but there are criteria which 
tell us when the inverse function exists, for instance when the graph of 
the function f looks like this. 
f(b) 
y=f(x) 
f(a) 
In this case, f is strictly increasing, and is defined on the interval [a, b]. 
To each point x in this interval, there is a value f(x) = y, and to each y 
between f(a) and f(b), there is a unique x between a and b such that 
f(x) = y. We formalize this in the next theorem. 
Theorem 1.1. Let f(x) be a function which is strictly increasing. Then 
the inverse function exists, and is defined on the set of values of f 
Proof This is practically obvious: Given a number YI and a number 
XI such that f(x l ) = YI' there cannot be another number X 2 such that 
f(x 2) = YI unless X2 = XI' because if X 2 =F XI' then 
either 
X2 > XI' in which case f(x 2) > f(x l ), 
or 
X2 < XI' in which casef(x2) <f(x l )·

INVERSE FUNCTIONS 
[VII, §1] 
Since the POSltlVlty of the derivative gives us a good test when a 
function is strictly increasing, we are able to define inverse functions 
whenever the function is differentiable and its derivative is positive. 
As usual, what we have said above applies as well to functions which 
are strictly decreasing, and whose derivatives are negative. 
The following theorem is intuitively clear and is proved in an appen-
dix. We already recalled it as Theorem 1.2 of Chapter V. 
Intermediate value theorem. Let f be a continuous function on a closed 
interval [a, b]. Let v be a number between f(a) and f(b). Then there 
exists a point c between a and b such that f(c) = v. 
This theorem says that the function f takes on every intermediate 
value between the values at the end points of the interval, and is illus-
trated on the next figure. 
f(b) 
f(c) 
f(a) 
a c 
b 
Using the intermediate value theorem, we now conclude: 
Theorem 1.2. Let f be a continuous function on the closed interval 
and assume that f is strictly increasing. Let f(a) = Ct and f(b) = {3. 
Then the inverse function is defined on the closed interval [a, {3]. 
Proof Given any number y between a and {3, there exists a number c 
between a and b such that f(c) = y, by the intermediate value theorem. 
Our assertion now follows from Theorem 1.1. 
If we let g be this inverse function, then g(a) = a and g({3) = b. 
Furthermore, the inverse function is characterized by the relation 
f(x) = y 
if and only if 
x = g(y). 
Note that we can easily visualize the graph of an inverse function. If 
we want x in terms of y, we just flip the page over a 45° angle, reversing 

[VII, §1] 
DEFINITION OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS

the roles of the x- and y-axes. Thus the graph of y = f(x) gets reflected 
across the slanted line at 45° to give us the graph of x = g(y).

We shall now give some examples of how to define inverse functions 
over certain intervals. 
Example 3. Take for f(x) a polynomial of degree 3. When the coeffi-
cient of x3 is positive, and when f has local maxima and minima, its 
graph looks like this: 
f(a) -----
To any given value of y between f(a) and feb) there correspond three 
possible values for x, and hence the inverse function cannot be defined 
unless we make other specifications. To do this, suppose first that we 
view f as defined only for those numbers ~ a. Then the graph of f looks 
like this: 
The inverse function is defined in this case. Similarly, we could view f as 
defined on the interval [a, b], or on the interval of all x ~ b. In each 
one of these cases, illustrated on the next figures, the inverse function 
would be defined.

In each case, we have drawn a point y and the corresponding value x of 
the inverse function. They are different in the three cases. 
Example 4. Let us consider a numerical example. Let 
f(x) = x3 - 2x + 1, 
viewed as a function on the interval x > -J2j3. Can we define the in-
verse function? For what numbers? If 9 is the inverse function, what is 
g(O)? What is g(5)? 
We have f'(x) = 3x 2 -
2. The graph of f'(x) is a parabola bending 
up, which crosses the x-axis at x = ±-J2j3. 
graph of 
f'(x) =3x' - 2 
Hence 
f'(x) > 0 
<=> 
x> J2/3 and x < --J2j3. 
Consider the interval x > -J2j3. Then f is strictly increasing on this 
interval, and so the inverse function 9 is defined. Since f(x) -+ 00 when 
x -+ 00, it follows that the inverse function g(y) is defined for all 
y > f(-J2j3), that is 
y > f(-J2j3) = (2/ 3)3/2 - 2(2/3)1/2 + 1. 
Now 1 > -J2j3, so 1 lies in the interval x> -J2j3, and f(l) = O. 
Therefore g(O) = l. 
Similarly f(2) = 5 and 2 lies in the interval x > -J2j3, so g(5) = 2. 

[VII, §1] 
DEFINITION OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS 
221 
Note that we do not give an explicit formula for our inverse function. 
When dealing with polynomials of degree ~ 3, no single formula can be 
given. 
Example 5. On the other hand, take f defined by the same formula, 
f(x) = x3 - 2x + 1, 
but viewed as a function on the interval 
_ l1<x< 11 
y3 = = y3' 
The derivative of f is given by f'(x) = 3x2 -
2. We have 
f'(x)<O 
¢> -ji<x<ji. 
Hence f is strictly decreasing on this interval, and the inverse function is 
defined, but is quite different from that of Example 4. For instance, 0 is 
in the interval, and f(O) = I, so if h denotes the inverse function, we have 
h(l) = O. 
Example 6. Let f(x) = xn (n being a positive integer). We view f as 
defined only for numbers x > O. Since f'(x) is nxn - 1, the function is 
strictly increasing. Hence the inverse function exists. This inverse func-
tion g is in fact what we mean by the n-th root. 
In all the exercises of the previous chapter you determined intervals 
over which certain functions increase and decrease. You can now define 
inverse functions for such intervals. In most cases, you cannot write 
down a simple explicit formula for such inverse functions.

VII, §2. DERIVATIVE OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS 
We shall state a theorem which allows us to determine the derivative of 
an inverse function when we know the derivative of the given function. 
Theorem 2.1. Let a, b be two numbers, a < b. Let f be a function 
which is differentiable on the interval a < x < b and such that its deriva-
tive f'(x) is > 0 for all x in this open interval. Then the inverse func-
tion x = g(y) exists, and we have 
1 
1 
g'(y) = f'(x) = f'(g(y»)" 
Proof We are supposed to investigate the Newton quotient 
g(y + k) - g(y) 
k 
The following picture illustrates the situation: 
y+k ----7-------:

x+h 
By the intermediate value theorem, every number of the form y + k with 
small values of k can be written as a value of f We let x = g(y) and we 
let h = g(y + k) - g(y). Then 
x = g(y) 
and 
g(y + k) = x + h. 

[VII, §2] 
DERIVATIVE OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS 
223 
Furthermore, y + k = f(x + h) and hence 
k = f(x + h) - f(x). 
The Newton quotient for g can therefore be written 
g(y + k) - g(y) 
x + h - x 
h 
k 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
f(x + h) - f(x)' 
and we see that it is the reciprocal of the Newton quotient for f, namely 
f(x + h) - f(x)' 
h 
As h approaches 0, we know that k approaches ° 
since 
k =f(x + h) - f(x). 
Conversely, as k approaches 0, we know that there exists exactly one 
value of h such that f(x + h) = y + k, because the inverse function is 
defined. Consequently, the corresponding value of h must also approach 
0. 
If we now take the limit of the reciprocal of the Newton quotient of f, 
as h (or k) approaches 0, we get 
1 
f'(x)' 
By definition, this is the derivative g'(y) and our theorem is proved. 
Example 1. Let f(x) = x 3 -
2x + 1. Find an interval such that the 
inverse function g of f is defined, and find g'(O), g'(5). 
By inspection, we see that 
f(l) = 0 
and 
f(2) = 5. 
We must therefore find an interval containing 1 and 2 such that the 
inverse function of f is defined for that interval. But 
f'(x) = 3x2 - 2 
and f'(x) > ° 
if and only if x > J2jj or x < -J2jj. (See Example 4 of 
the preceding section.) We select the interval x > J2jj, which contains 
both 1 and 2. Then we can apply the general theorem on the derivative 
of the inverse function, which states that if y = f(x) then 
, 
1 
g(y) = f'(x)' 

224 
This gives:

g'(O) = _ 1_ = 1

and

g'(5) = 1'(2) = 10' 
[VII, §2] 
Please note that the derivative g'(y) is given in terms of f'(x). We 
don't have a formula in terms of y. 
The theorem giving us the derivative of the inverse function could also 
be expressed by saying that 
dx 
dy = dy/dx' 
Here also, the derivative behaves as if we were taking a quotient. Thus 
the notation is very suggestive and we can use it from now on without 
thinking, because we proved a theorem justifying it. 
Remark. In Theorem 2.1, we have proved that in fact, the derivative 
of the inverse function g exists, and is given by g'(y) = l/f'(x). If one 
assumes that this derivative exists, then one can give a much shorter 
argument to find its value, using the chain rule. Indeed, we have 
f(g(y» = y, 
since g(y) = x. 
Differentiating with respect to y, we find by the chain rule, 
f'(g(y»g'(y) = 1, 
dy 
because dy = 1. 
Hence

VII, §3. THE ARCSINE 
It is impossible to define an inverse function for the function y = sin x 
because to each value of y there correspond infinitely many values of x 
because sin(x + 2n) = sin x = sin(n - x). 
However, if we restrict our 
attention to special intervals, we can define the inverse function. 
We restrict the sine function to the interval 
The derivative of sin x is cos x and in that interval, we have 
0< cos x, 
so the derivative is positive, 
except when x = nl2 or x = - nl2 in which case the cosine is O. 
Therefore, in the interval 
the function is strictly increasing. The inverse function exists, and IS 
called the arcsine.

Let f(x) = sin x, and x = arcsin y, the inverse function. Since f(O) = 0 
we have arcsin 0 = O. Furthermore, since 
sin(- n/2) = -1 
and 
sin(n/2) = 1, 
we know that the inverse function is defined over the interval going from 
-1 to + 1, that is for 
-1~y~l. 
In words, we can say loosely that arcsin x is the angle whose sine is x. 
(We throw in the word loosely because, strictly speaking, arcsin x is a 
number, and not an angle, and also because we mean the angle between 
-n/2 and n/2.) 
Example 1. Let f(x) = sin x and let g(y) = arcsin y. Then 
arcsin (1/)2) = n/4 
because 
sin n/4 = 1/j2. 
Similarly, 
arcsin 1/2 = n/6 
because 
sin n/6 = 1/2. 
For any value of x in the interval - n/2 ~ x ~ n/2 we have 
arcsin sin x = x, 

[VII, §3]

by definition of the inverse function. However, if x is not in this interval, 
then we do not have 
arcsin sin x = x. 
Example 2. Let x = - n. Then 
sin( -n) = 0, 
and 
arcsin(sin( - n) = arcsin 0 = 0 "# - n. 
Example 3. We have 
arcsin sin(3nI4) = n14, 
because sin 3nl4 = l/fi, and arcsin l/fi = n14. 
We now consider the derivative and the graph of the inverse function. 
The derivative of sin x is positive in the interval 
- nl2 < x < n12. 
Since the derivative of the inverse function x = g(y) is Il f'(x), the deriva-
tive of arcsin y is also positive, in the interval 
-l<y<l. 
Therefore the inverse function is strictly increasing in that interval. Its 
graph looks like the figure shown below.

According to the general rule for the derivative of inverse functions, 
we know that when y = sin x and x = arcsin y the derivative is 
dx 
dy = dyldx = cos x

INVERSE FUNCTIONS 
[VII, §3] 
When x is very close to n/2, we know that cos x is close to O. Therefore 
the derivative is very large. Hence the curve is almost vertical. Similarly, 
when x is close to -n/2 and y is close to -1, the curve is almost 
vertical, as drawn. 
Finally, it turns out that we can express our derivative explicitly as a 
function of y. Indeed, we have the relation 
sin 2 x + cos2 X = 1, 
whence 
cos2 X = 1 - sin2 x. 
In the interval between - n/2 and n/2, the cosine is ~ O. Hence we can 
take the square root, and we get 
cos x = Jl - sin 2 x 
in that interval. Since y = sin x, we can write our derivative in the form 
dx 
1 
dy- JI=7 
which is expressed entirely in terms of y.

easily done, namely if g(y) = arcsin y, then

sine, we shift back our letters to the usual ones. We state the main 
properties as a theorem. 
Theorem 3.1. View the sine function as defined on the interval 
[ - n/2, n/2]. 
Then the inverse function is defined on the interval [-1, 1]. Call it

VII, §4. THE ARCTANGENT 
Let f(x) = tan x and view this function as defined over the interval 
As x goes from - nl2 to n12, the tangent goes from very large negative 
values to very large positive values. As x approaches n12, the tangent 
has in fact arbitrarily large positive values, and similarly when x ap-
proaches - n12, the tangent has arbitrarily large negative values. 
We recall that the graph of the tangent looks like that in the following 
figure. 
The derivative of tan x is 
d(tan x) _ 1 
2 
dx 
-
+ tan x. 
Hence the derivative is always positive, and the tan function is strictly 
increasing. Furthermore when x ranges over the interval 
-n12 < x < n12, 
tan x ranges from large negative to large positive values. Hence tan x 
ranges over all numbers. Therefore the inverse function is defined for all 
numbers. We call it the arctangent. 
As with the arcsin and arccos, we may say roughly that arctan y is 
the angle whose tangent is y. We put "roughly" in our statement, be-
cause as pointed out before, we really mean the number of radians of the 
angle whose tangent is y, such that this number lies between - nl2 and 
n12. 

[VII, §4] 
THE ARCTANGENT 
231 
Example 1. We have arctan( -l/fi) = -n/6, but 
arctan( -1/j3) =1= 5n/6, 
even though tan 5n/6 = -1/j3. 
Example 2. In the same vein, we find that 
arctan tan 5n/6 = arctan( -1/j3) = -n/6. 
The reason why arctan tan x =1= x in this case is due to our choice of 
interval of definition for the tangent, when we wish to have an inverse 
function, and the fact that x = 5n/6 does not lie in this interval. Of 
course, if x lies between -n/2 and n/2, then we must have 
arctan tan x = x 
Thus 
arctan tan( - n/6) = -n/6. 
The graph of the arctan looks like this:

Now for the derivative. Let x = g(y) = arctan y. Then 
1 
1 
g'(y) = f'(x) = 1 + tan2 x 
so that 
g'(y) = 1 : y2· 
Here again we are able to get an explicit formula for the derivative of 
the inverse function. 
As with the arcsine, when dealing simultaneously with the function 
and its inverse function, we have to keep our letters x, y separate. How-
ever, we now summarize the properties of the arctan in terms of our 
usual notation.

INVERSE FUNCTIONS 
[VII, §4] 
Theorem 4.1. The inverse function of the tangent is defined for all 
numbers. Call it the arctangent. Thus arctan x is the unique number y 
such that tan y = x and -n12 < y < n12. Then arctan has a derivative, 
and that derivative is given by the relation 
d(arctan x) - -
-
dx 
As x becomes very large positive, arctan x approaches n12. 
As x becomes very large negative, arctan x approaches -nI2. 
The arctangent is strictly increasing for all x. 
Example 3. Let h(x) = arctan 2x. To find the derivative, we use the 
chain rule, letting u = 2x. Then

h'(x) = 1 + (2X)2 ' 2 = 1 + 4x2'

y = arctan( 2 . 2~) = arctan fi = n16.

through the point (1/2)3, n/6). We know how to do this; the equation 
is

CHAPTER 
VIII 
Exponents and Logarithms 
We remember that we had trouble at the very beginning with the func-
tion r (or 3x, or lOX). It was intuitively very plausible that there should 
be such functions, satisfying the fundamental equation 
for all numbers x, y, and 2° = 1, but we had difficulties in saying what 
we meant by 2fl (or 2"). 
It is the purpose of this chapter to study this function, and others like 
it. 
VIII, §1. THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION 
If n is a positive integer, we know what 2" means: It is the product of 2 
with itself n times. For instance, 28 is the product of 2 with itself eight 
times. 
Furthermore, we also know that 2 1/n is the n-th root of 2; it is that 
number whose n-th power is 2. Thus 21/8 is that number whose 8-th 
power is 2. 
If x = min is a quotient of two positive integers, then 
can be expressed in terms of roots and powers, so fractional powers of 2 
are also easily understood. The problem arises in understanding r when

THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION

x is not a quotient of two positive integers. We leave this problem aside 
for the moment, and assume that there is a function defined for all x, 
denoted by 2\ which is differentiable. We shall now see how to find its 
derivative. 
We form the Newton quotient. It is 
h 
Using the fundamental equation we see that this quotient is equal to 
As h approa<:hes 0, 2x remains fixed, but it is very difficult to see what 
happens to 
It is not at all clear that this quotient approaches a limit. Roughly 
speaking, we meet a difficulty which is analogous to the one we met 
when we tried to find the derivative of sin x. However, in the present 
situation, a direct approach would lead to much greater difficulties than 
those which we met when we discussed 
It is, in fact, true that

exists. We see that it does not depend on x. It depends only on 2. 
If we tried to take the derivative of lOX, we would end up with the 
problem of determining the limit 
which is also independent of x. 

238 
EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS 
[VIII, §1] 
In general, we shall assume the following. 
Let a be a number > 1. There exists a function aX, defined for all 
numbers x, satisfying the following properties: 
Property 1. The fundamental equation 
holds for all numbers x, y. 
Property 2. If x is a rational number, x = min with m, n positive 
integers, then amj n has the usual meaning: 
Property 3. The function aX is differentiable. 
The function aX is called an exponential function. 
We can then apply the same procedure to aX that we applied to r . 
We form the Newton quotient 
Since we assumed that aX is differentiable, it follows that 
Thus we meet the mysterious limit

lim - h-
· 
h~O 
This is a similar situation to the differentiation of sin x, but previously 
we were able to find the limit of (sin h}/h as h approaches O. Here we 
cannot take a direct approach. The limit will be clarified later when we 
study the log. 
However, we can analyze this limit a little more. Let

This is because 
a = al + o = a·ao. 
If we multiply by a-Ion both sides, we get 1 = aO.

because aO = 1. Consequently the mysterious limit on the right-hand side 
is the slope of the curve y = aX at x = o. 
Let us try to get a feeling for curves like 2\ or 3\ or lOX by plotting 
points. We give a table of values for 2X.

[VIII, §1] 
We see that the value y = 2X increases rapidly when x becomes large, 
and approaches 0 rapidly when x becomes large negative, as illustrated 
on the figure. 
The behavior when x becomes large negative is due to the relation 
2- x = l/r. For instance, 2- 10 = 1/210 which is small. We can write 
lim 2x = O. 
x- -
00 
Observe that r > 0 for all numbers x. Similarly, if a > 0, then 
aX> 0 
for all x. 
We can even prove this from what we have assumed explicitly. For 
suppose aC = 0 with some number c. Then for all x we get 
which is not true since a l = a i= O. 
Exercise. Make a similar table for 3X, lOX, and (3/2Y. 
Next suppose that 1 < a < b. It is plausible that the curve bX has a 
bigger slope than the curve aX. We are especially interested in the slope 
when x = O. If b is very large, then the curve y = bX will have a very 
steep slope at x = O. If a is > 1 but close to 1, then the curve y = aX 
will have a small slope at x = O. We have drawn these curves on the 
next figure. 

[VIII, §1] 
THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION 
241 
Try for yourself plotting some points on the curves 2x, 3\ lOx to see 
what happens in these concrete cases. It is plausible that as a increases 
fron numbers close to 1 (and > 1) to very large numbers, the slope of aX 
at x = 0 increases continuously from values close to 0 to large values, 
and therefore for some value of a, which we call e, this slope is precisely 
equal to 1. Thus in this naive approach, e is the number such that the 
slope of eX at x = 0 is equal to 1, that is for f(x) = eX, we have 
lim f(O + h) - f(O) = lim eh -
eO = 1.

Similarly, when a is a fixed number, do not confuse the function aX and

[VIII, §I] 
At first we have no idea how big or small the number e may be. In 
Exercises 16 through 20, you will learn a very efficient way of finding a 
decimal expansion, or approximations for e by rational numbers. It 
turns out that e lies between 2 and 3, and in particular is approximately 
equal to 2.7183 .... 
Assuming the basic properties of eX as we have done, we can apply 
some of our previous techniques in the context of this exponential func-
tion. First we show that eX is the only function equal to its own deriva-
tive, up to a constant factor. 
Theorem 1.1. Let g(x) be a junction defined jar all numbers and such 
that g'(x) = g(x). Then there is a constant C such that g(x) = Cex. 
Proof We have to prove that g(x)jeX is constant. We know how to 
do this. It suffices to prove that the derivative is O. But we find : 
eXg(x) - g(x)eX 
e2x 
=0. 
Hence there is a constant C such that g(x)/ex = C. Multiplying both 
sides by eX we get 
g(x) = CeX, 
thus proving the theorem. 
As a special case of the theorem we have: 
Let g be a differentiable junction such that g'(x) = g(x) and g(O) = 1. 
Then g(x) = eX. 
Proof 
Since g(x) = Cex we get g(O) = Ceo = C. 
Hence C = 1 and 
g(x) = eX. 
Thus there is one and only one function g which is equal to its own 
derivative and such that g(O) = I. This function is called the exponential 
function, and is sometimes denoted by expo We may write 
exp'(x) = exp(x) 
and 
exp(O) = 1. 
But usually we use the notation eX as before, instead of exp(x). 

[VIII, §l] 
THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION 
243 
There are several ways of proving the existence of a function g(x) such 
that g'(x) = g(x) and g(O) = 1, rather than giving the plausibility argu-
ments as above. 
In Chapter XIV we shall give a proof by infinite series. On the other 
hand, when we study the logarithm in §6, we shall first show that there 
exists a function L(x) such that L'(x) = l/x and L(l) = O. Then we can 
define the inverse function, and it is easy to see that this inverse function 
g satisfies g'(y) = g(y) and g(O) = 1. Anyone interested in such theory 
can suit their tastes and look up these later sections as they see fit. 
We now give examples and applications involving the function eX. 
Example. Find the derivative of e3x2. 
We use the chain rule, with u = 3x 2• Then 
d(e") = de" du = e3x2 . 6x.

Example. Let f(x) = ecos2x. We find the derivative of f by the chain 
rule, namely 
I' (x) = eCOS 2x( - sin 2x )2. 
There is no point simplifying this expression. 
Example. Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = eX at 
x = 2. 
Let f(x) = eX. Then I'(x) = eX and 1'(2) = e2. When x = 2, y = e2. 
Hence we must find the equation of the line with slope e2 , passing 
through the point (2, e2 ). This equation is 
Graph of eX 
Let us sketch the graph of eX. We justify our statements by using only 
the four properties listed above. Since

for all x, 
we conclude that the function f(x) = eX is strictly increasing. Since 
f"(x) = I'(x) = f(x) > 0

we conclude that the function is bending up.

1(1)=e>1. 
Hence when n is a positive integer, n = I, 2, 3, ... , the powers en become 
large as n becomes large. Since eX is strictly increasing for all x, this also 
shows that eX becomes large when x is a large real number. 
We had also seen that 
Hence when x is large, the inverse 
is small (positive). 
Thus we may write: 
If x --+ 00 
then 
eX --+ 00. 
If x --+ -
00 
then 
eX --+ O. 
We are now in a position to see that the graph of eX looks like this:

If eX = y, then we define x = log y. Thus the log, here and thereafter, is 
what some call the natural log. We don't deal with any other log. By 
definition, we therefore have: 
e10gy = y 
and 
log eX = x. 
Thus log is the inverse function of the exponential function eX. Since eX 
is strictly increasing, the inverse function exists.

Examples. We have 
log e2 = 2, 
log e-fi = -J2, 
log e - 3 = - 3, 
log e" = n. 
And the other way: 
e1og2 = 2, 
Furthermore, the relation eO = 1 means that 
log 1 = O. 
Since all values eX are positive for all numbers x, it follows that 
log y is defined only for positive numbers y. 
The rule ea + b = eaeb translates into a rule for the log, as follows. 
Theorem 2.1. If u, v are > 0, then 
log uv = log u + log v. 
Proof Let a = log u and b = log v. Then 
By definition, the relation 
ea + b = uv 
means that 
log uv = a + b = log u + log v 
as was to be shown. 
Theorem 2.2. If u > 0, then 
log u- I = -log u. 
Proof We have 1 = uu - I. Hence 
0= log I = log(uu- I ) = log u + log u- 1. 
Adding -log u to both sides proves the theorem. 

[VIII, §2] 
THE LOGARITHM 
249 
Examples. We have 
log(lj2) = -log 2 
log(2j3) = log 2 - log 3. 
Of course, we can take the log of a product with more than two 
terms, just as we can take the exponential of a sum of more than two 
terms. For instance 
Similarly, if n is a positive integer, then 
ena = ea+a+"' +a = eaea ... ea = (ea)", 
where the product on the right is taken n times. 
We have the corresponding rule for the log, namely 
I log(un) = n log u. 
F or instance, by Theorem 2.1, we find : 
log(u2) = log(u· u) = log u + log u = 2 log U. 
log(u 3) = log(u 2u) = log u2 + log u 
= 2 log u + log u 
= 3 log u. 
And so forth, to get log un = n log u. 
It now follows that if n is a positive integer, then 
1 
log u1/n = - log u. 
n 
Proof Let v = u1/n. Then vn = u, and we have already seen that 
Hence 
log vn = n log v. 
1 
log v = - log vn, 
n 
which is precisely the relation log u 1/n = l/n log u.

The same type of rule holds for fractional exponents, that is: 
If m, n are positive integers, then 
m 
log um!n = - log u. 
n

= - log um 
n 
m 
= - log u 
n 
by using the two cases separately. 
Just to give you a feeling for the behavior of the log, we give a few 
approximate values: 
log 10 = 2.3 ... , 
log 10,000 = 9.2 ... , 
log 100 = 4.6 ... , 
log 100,000 = 11.5 ... , 
log 1000 = 6.9 ... , 
log 1,000,000 = 13.8 .... 
You can see that if x grows like a geometric progression, then log x 
grows like an arithmetic progression. The above values illustrate the rule 
log IOn = n log 10, 
where log 10 is approximately 2.3. 
In Exercises 17 and 19 of § 1 you should have proved that 2.5 < e < 3. 
Make up a table of the values en and log en = n. You can then compare 
the growth of en with log en in a similar way. For positive integers you 
can then see that log en grows very slowly compared to en. For instance, 
log e3 = 3, 
loge4 = 4, 
log e5 = 5, 
log e10 = 10. 

[VIII, §2] 
THE LOGARITHM 
251 
Using the fact that e lies between 2 and 3, you can see that powers like 
e5 or e10 are quite large compared to the values of the log, which are 5 
and 10, respectively, in these cases. For instance, since e> 2 we have 
We have the same phenomenon in the opposite direction for negative 
powers of e. For instance:

Put h = l/eY• As h approaches 0, y becomes large posItive, but rather 
slowly. Make a similar table for log(1/10n) with n = I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to get 
a feeling for numerical examples. 
Observe that if x is a small positive number and we write x = eY then 
y = log x is large negative. For instance 
then 
then 
In short: 
If x -+ 0 then log x -+ -
00. 
The reason comes from the behavior of eY• If y -+ -
00 then eY -+ O. 
Similarly, if y -+ 00 then eY -+ 00. This translates into the corresponding 
property of the inverse function: 
If x -+ 00 
then log x -+ 00.

The derivative of log 
Next we consider the differentiation properties of the log function. Let 
and 
x = logy. 
By the rule for differentiating inverse functions, we find:

dy = dy/dx = ~ = y 
Hence we have the formula: 
Theorem 2.3.

From the graph of eX, we see that eX takes on all values > O. Hence 
the inverse function log is defined for all positive real numbers, and by 
the general way of finding the graph of an inverse function, we see that 
its graph looks like that in the figure. 
y-axis 
x-axis 
In the figure, the graph crosses the horizontal axis at 1, because 
means 
log 1 = O. 
Note that the derivative satisfies 
for all x> 0, 
so the log function is strictly increasing. 

[VIII, §2] 
THE LOGARITHM 
253 
Furthermore 
We conclude that the log function is bending down as shown. 
Remark. We shall sometimes consider composite functions of the type 
log(f(x». Since the log is not defined for numbers < 0, the expression 
log(f(x» is defined only for numbers x such that f(x) > O. This is to be 
understood whenever we write such an expression. 
Thus when we write log(x - 2), this is defined only when x - 2 > 0, 
in other words x> 2. When we write log(sin x), this is meaningful only 
when sin x > O. It is not defined when sin x ~ O. 
Example. Find the tangent line to the curve y = log(x - 2) at the 
point x = 5. 
Let f(x) = log(x - 2). Then f'(x) = I/(x - 2), and 
f'(5) = III 
When x = 5, log(x - 2) = log 3. We must find the equation of the line 
with slope 1/3, passing through (5, log 3). This is easy, namely: 
y - log 3 = ~x - 5). 
Example. Sketch the graph of the functionf(x) = x 2 + log x, for x > O. 
We begin by taking the derivative, namely 
f'(x) = 2x + !. 
x 
The function f has a critical point precisely when 2x = -l/x, that is 
2X2 = - l. This can never be the case. Hence there is no critical point. 
When x > 0, the derivative is positive. Hence in this interval, the func-
tion is strictly increasing. 
When x becomes large positive, both x 2 and log x become large posi-
tive. Hence 
if x -+ 00 
then f(x) -+ 00. 
As x approaches 0 from the right, x 2 approaches 0, but log x becomes 
large negative. Hence 
if 
x -+ 0 and 
x > 0 then f(x) -+ -
00.

Similarly,

1 < 0 
<=> 
x < 1/J2 
<=> f 
is bending down. 
Hence 1/J2 is an inflection point. We claim that 
f(l /J2) > O. 
Indeed, 
But the log is strictly increasing, and 2 < e so 
log 2 < log e = 1. 
Therefore 1 - log 2 > O. This proves that f(l /J2) > O. It follows that 
the graph of f looks like this.

Property 5. For all numbers x, y we have 
For example, if x = nand y = m are positive integers, then (am)" is the 
product of am with itself n times, which is equal to am". We shall now 
deduce some consequences from this property. 
First, from the preceding section, we know that 
Therefore 
By Property 5, this yields 
because (log a)x = x log a. Thus for instance, 
The above formula allows us to find the derivative of aX. Remember 
that a is viewed as constant.

Since the log is strictly increasing, there is only one number a such that 
log a = 1, and that number is a = e. Thus the exponential function eX is 
the only one among all possible exponential functions aX whose deriva-
tive is equal to itself. By Theorem 3.1, since

if a :f. e then we get the factor log a :f. 1 coming into the formula for the

THE GENERAL EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION

We have f(2) = 22 = 4. Therefore the equation of the tangent line at 
x = 2 is 
y - 4 = 4(1 + log 2)(x - 2). 
Definition. When x, yare two numbers such that y = 2x , it is custom-
ary to say that x is the log of y to the base 2. Similarly, if a is a number 
> 0, and y = aX = exloga, we say that x is the log of y to the base a. 
When y = eX, we simply say that x = log y. 
The log to the base a is sometimes written lo~. 
We conclude this section by discussing limits, which are now very 
easy to handle. 
First, we have 
Limit 1. 
lim -h110g(l + h) = 1. 
h-O 
Indeed, the limit on the left is nothing else but the limit of the Newton 
quotient 
I· 10g(1 + h) -log 1 = I '(1) 
1m 
h 
og 
. 
h-O 
Since log'(x) = fix, it follows that 10g'(I) = 1, as desired. 
Limit 2. 
lim (1 + h)l /h = e. 
h-O 
Proof We have 
(1 + h)l /h = e(1/h)log(1 +h) 
because by definition aX = exloga. We have just seen that 
1 h 10g(1 + h) -+ 1 
as h -+ O. 
Hence 
e(1/h)log(l +h) -+ e 1 = e 
as 
h -+ O. 
This proves the desired limit. 
Remark. We are using here the continuity of the function eX. 
If x approaches a number Xo then eX approaches eXO • 

260 
EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS 
[VIII, §3] 
That the function eX is continuous follows from our assumption that eX is 
differentiable. 
For instance, if x approaches j2 then eX approaches e'/ i.. 
If x approaches 1 then eX approaches e1 = e. 
If x approaches 0 then eX approaches eO = 1. 
Let us go back to Limit 2. We reformulate this limit. Write h = 1/x. 
When h approaches 0 then x becomes large, that is 
h -. 0 if and only if x -. 00. 
Therefore we find the limit: 
Limit 3.

This has an interesting application. 
Example. Compound interest. Let an amount of A dollars be invested 
at yearly compound interest of 100r per cent where r > O. Thus r is the 
ratio of the rate of interest of 100 per cent. Then this original amount 
increases to the following after the indicated number of years: 
After 1 year: A + rA = (l + r)A. 
After 2 years: (l + r)A + r(l + r)A = (1 + r)2 A. 
After 3 years: (1 + r)2 A + r(l + r? A = (l + r? A. 
Continuing in this way, we conclude that after n years the amount is 
An = (1 + r)"A. 
Now suppose that this same interest rate 100r per cent is compounded 
every 11m years, where m is a positive integer. This is equivalent to 
saying that the rate is 100rlm per cent per 11m years, compounded every 
11m years. Let us apply the preceding formula to the case where the unit 
of time is 11m year. Then q years are equal to qm · 11m years. Therefore,

VIII, §4. SOME APPLICATIONS 
It is known (from experimental data) that when a piece of radium is left 
to disintegrate, the rate of disintegration is proportional to the amount 
of radium left. Two quantities are proportional when one is a constant 
multiple of the other. 
Suppose that at time t = 0 we have 10 grams of radium and let f(t) be 
the amount of radium left at time t. Then 
df 
-
= Kf(t) 
dt 
for some constant K. We take K negative since the physical interpreta-
tion is that the amount of substance decreases. 
Let us show that there is a constant C such that 
If we take the derivative of the quotient 
f(t) 
eKt 

[VIII, §4] 
SOME APPLICATIONS 
263 
and use the rule for the derivative of a quotient, we find 
because f'(t) = Kf(t). Since the derivative is 0, the quotient f(t)/e Kt IS 
constant, or equivalently, there is a constant C such that 
f(t) = CeKt• 
Let t = O. Then f(O) = c. Thus C = 10, if we assumed that we started 
with 10 grams. 
In general, if f(t) = CeKt is the function giving the amount of sub-
stance as a function of time, then 
I f(O) = c, 
and C is interpreted as the amount of substance when t = 0, that is the 
original amount. 
Similarly, consider a chemical reaction. It is frequently the case that 
the rate of the reaction is proportional to the quantity of reacting sub-
stance present. If f(t) denotes the amount of substance left after time t, 
then 
df 
- = Kf(t) 
dt 
for some constant K (determined experimentally in each case). We are 
therefore in a similar situation as before, and 
where C is the amount of substance at t = O. 
Example 1. Suppose f(t) = 10eKt where K is constant. Assume that 
f(3) = 5. Find K. 
We have

Example 2. Sugar in water decomposes at a rate proportional to the 
amount still unchanged. If 50lb of sugar reduce to 151b in 3 hr, when 
will 20 per cent of the sugar be decomposed? 
Let S(t) be the amount of sugar undecomposed, at time t. Then by 
hypothesis, 
for suitable constants C and k. Furthermore, since S(O) = C, we have 
C = 50. Thus 
S(t) = 50e- k' . 
We also have 
S(3) = 50e- 3k = 15 
so 
Thus we can solve for k, namely we take the log and get 
- 3k = log(3/1O), 
whence 
-k =! log(3/10). 
When 20 per cent has decomposed then 80 per cent is left. Note that 
80 per cent of 50 is 40. We want to find t such that

tions, when substances decrease, it is convenient to use a convention

such that k > 0 so that the expression e- kl decreases when t increases. 
But mathematically the procedures are equivalent, putting K = 
- k. 
Example 3. A radioactive substance disintegrates proportionally to the 
amount of substance present at a given time, say 
f(t) = Ce- kl 
for some positive constant k. At what time will there be exactly 1/4-th 
of the original amount left? 
To do this, we want to know the value of t such that 
f(t) = Cf4. 
Thus we want to solve 
Ce- kl = Cf4. 
Note that we can cancel C to get e- kl = 1/4. Taking logs yields 
whence 
-kt = -log 4, 
log 4 
t= - k- · 
Observe that the answer is independent of the original amount C. 
Experiments also allow us to determine the constant k. For instance, if 
we can analyze a sample, and determine that 1/4-th is left after 1000 
years, then we find that 
k = log4.

Example 4. Exponential growth also reflects population explosion. If 
P(t) is the population as a function of time t, then its rate of increase is 
proportional to the total population, in other words, 
dP

for some positive constant K. It then follows that 
P(t) = CeK1 
for some constant C which is the population at time t = O.

In this section we analyze more closely what we mean when we say that 
eX grows much faster than x, and log x grows much slower than x, when 
x becomes large positive. 
We consider the quotient

[VIII, §5] 
as x becomes large positive. Both the numerator and the denominator 
become large, and the question is, what is the behavior of the quotient? 
First let us make a table for simple values 2n/n when n is a positive 
integer, to see that 2n/n becomes large as n becomes large, experimen-
tally. We agree to the convention that n always denotes a positive inte-
ger, unless otherwise specified.

Since 2 < e, we have 2"/n < e"/n, and we see experimentally that e"/n 
becomes large. We now wish to prove this fact. We first prove some 
inequalities for eX. We use techniques from the exercises of §l. We pro-
ceed stepwise. We consider x ~ o. 
(a) We first show that 
for x> o. 
Let II(x) = eX - (1 + x). Then f'1(X) = eX -
1. Since eX> 1 for x> 0, we 
conclude that 
for x> o. 
Therefore II (x) is strictly increasing for x ~ O. Since II (0) = 0, we con-
clude that II(x) > 0 for x> 0, which means 
or in other words, 
eX> 1 + x, 
as was to be shown. 
(b) Next we show that 
for x> O. 
Let 12(X) = eX - (l + x + x2/2). Then 12(0) = O. Furthermore, 
I~(x) = eX - (l + x).

Recall that by definition, 2! = 2 and 3! = 3 . 2 = 6. This time we let 
Then f3(0) = O. Furthermore, using inequality (b) we find 
f~(x) = eX - (1 + x + ~~) = fix) > 0 
for x> O. 
Hence f3(X) is strictly increasing, and therefore f3(X) > 0 for x > O. This 
proves inequality (c).

As x becomes large, the left-hand side becomes large, so ex/x2 becomes

We can continue the same method to prove the general statement 
about eX/x'. First you should prove that

now prove the general step using an arbitrary integer n. In general, let

Then f.+ 1(0) = 0 and f~+ I(X) = f.(x) > 0 for x> O. Hence f.+ 1 is strictly 
increasing, and therefore f.+ I(X) > 0 for x> 0, as desired. 
Therefore, given our integer m, we have an inequality

Since the left-hand side becomes large when x becomes large, so does the

Since eX> 0 for all x, we get:

f'(x) < 0

x + 1 < 0 
<=> 
x < -1. 
There is only one critical point at x = -1, and the other inequalities 
give us the regions of increase and decrease for f. 
As to the bending up or down: 
Therefore:

The present section is interesting for its own sake, because it gives us 
further insight into the logarithm. It also provides a very nice and con-
crete introduction to integration which is going to be covered in the next 
part. We shall give an interpretation of the logarithm as the area under 
a curve. 
We define a function L(x) to be the area under the curve l/x between 
1 and x if x ~ 1, and the negative of the area under the curve l/x 
between 1 and x if 0 < x < 1. In particular, L(I) = o. 
The shaded portion of the picture that follows represents the area 
under the curve between 1 and x. On the left we have taken x > 1.

Thus L(x) < 0 if 0 < x < 1 and L(x) > 0 if x> 1.

x + h is in between the two rectangles, we see that it satisfies our in-
equalities. 
We divide both sides of our inequalities by the positive 
number h. Then the inequalities are preserved, and we get 
1 
L(x + h) - L(x)

x + h < 
h 
<~. 
As h approaches 0, our Newton quotient is squeezed between l/(x + h) 
and l/x and consequently approaches l/x. This proves our theorem in 
case h > o. 
When h < 0 we use an entirely similar argument, which we leave as 
an exercise. (You have to pay attention to the sign of L. Also when you 
divide an inequality by hand h < 0, then the inequality gets reversed. 
However, you will again see that the Newton quotient is squeezed be-
tween l/x and l/(x + h).) 

[VIII, §6] 
THE LOGARITHM AS THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE 1/x 
277 
Theorem 6.2. The function L(x) is equal to log x. 
Proof 
Both functions L(x) and log x have the same derivative, 
namely I Ix for x > O. Hence there is a constant C such that 
L(x) = log x + C. 
This is true for all x> O. In particular, let x = l. We obtain 
o = L(1) = log I + C. 
But log 1 = O. Hence C = 0, and the theorem is proved. 
The identification of the log with the area under the curve I/x can be 
used to give inequalities for the log. This is simple, and is given as an 
exercise. We can also obtain an estimate for e. 
Example. The area under the curve I/x between 1 and 2 is less than 
the area of a rectangle whose base is the interval [I, 2] and whose 
height is I, as shown on the following figure. 
3 
4 
Hence we get the inequality 
log 2 < l. 
Since log e = I, it follows that 2 < e. This gives us a lower estimate for e. 
Similarly we obtain an upper estimate as follows. The area under the 
curve I/x between 1 and 2 is greater than the area of the rectangle 
whose base is the interval [I, 2] and whose height is 1/2, as shown on 
the above figure. Hence we get the inequality 
Then 
1 
log 2> 2' 
1 
log 4 = log(22) = 2 log 2 > 2 . 2 = I. 
Since log e = 1 it follows that e < 4.

EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS 
[VIII, §6] 
In Exercises 16 through 20 of §1 we had another method to obtain 
estimates for e. The method with the area under the curve can be used 
in other contexts and is independently useful.

graph of l/x, with bases [1, 2] and [2, 4] to show that log 4> 1. 
VIII, APPENDIX. SYSTEMATIC PROOF OF THE THEORY OF 
EXPONENTIALS AND LOGARITHMS 
Instead of assuming the five basic properties of the exponential function 
as in §1, and §3, we might have given a development of the log and 
exponential as follows. This is intended only for those interested in 
theory. 
We start by defining L(x) as we did in §6. The proof that L'(x) = l/x 
is self-contained, and yields a function L defined for all x > 0 and satisfy-
ing 
L'(x) = l/x 
and 
L(O) = 1. 
Since l/x > 0 for all x > 0, it follows that the function L is strictly in-
creasing, and so has an inverse function, which we denote by x = E(y). 
Then using the rule for derivative of an inverse function, we find: 
1 
1 
E'(y) = -
= -
= x = E(y). 
L'(x) 
l/x 

[VIII, ApP.] 
SYSTEMATIC PROOF 
279 
Thus we have found a function E such that E'(y) = E(y) for all y. In 
other words, we have found a function equal to its own derivative. 
Since L(O) = 1 we find that E( 1) = O. 
Next we prove: 
For all numbers a, b > 0 we have 
L(ab) = L(a) + L(b). 
Proof Fix the number a and let J(x) = L(ax). By the chain rule, we 
obtain 
1 
1 
f'(x) = -
· a = - . 
ax 
x 
Since Land J have the same derivative, there is a constant C such that 
J(x) = L(x) + C for all x > O. In particular, for x = 1 we get 
L(a) = J(I) = L(I) + C = 0 + C = c. 
So L(a) = C and L(ax) = L(x) + L(a). This proves the first property. 
Since L'(x) = l/x > 0 for x > 0 it follows that L is strictly increasing. 
Since L"(x) = -1/x 2 < 0, it follows that L is bending down. 
Let a> O. We get: 
L(a 2) = L(a) + L(a) = 2L(a), 
L(a 3 ) = L(a2a) = L(a2 ) + L(a) = 2L(a) + L(a) = 3L(a). 
Continuing in this way, we get for all positive integers n: 
L(a") = nL(a) 
In particular, take a > 1. Since L(1) = 0 we conclude that L(a) > 0 be-
cause L is strictly increasing. Hence L(a") -> 00 as n -> 00. Again since L 
is strictly increasing, it follows that L(x) -> 00 as x -> 00. 
From the formula 
we conclude that 

280 
EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS 
[VIII, ApP.] 
Next, let x approach O. Write x = l/y where y --+ 00. Then 
L(x) = - L(y) --+ -
00 
as 
y --+ 00 
so L(x) --+ -00 as x --+ O. We may now write log x instead of L(x). 
Now let E be the inverse function of L. We already proved that 
E' = E. The inverse function of L is defined on the set of values of L, 
which is all numbers. The set of values of E is the domain of definition 
of L, which is the set of positive numbers. So E(y) > 0 for all y. Thus E 
is strictly increasing, and E"(y) = E(y) for all y shows that the graph of 
E bends up. 
We have E(O) = I because L(1) = O. 
Then we can prove 
E(u + v) = E(u)E(v). 
Namely, let a = E(u) and b = E(v). By the meaning of inverse function, 
u = L(a) and v = L(b). Then: 
L(ab) = L(a) + L(b) = u + v. 
Hence 
E(u)E(v) = ab = E(u + v), 
as was to be shown. 
We now define e = E(1). Since E is the inverse function of L we have 
L(e) = 1. From the rule 
E(u + v) = E(u)E(v) 
we now get for any positive integer n that 
E(n) = E(l + 1 + .. . + 1) = E(1)" = en. 
Similarly, 
E(nu) = E(u)". 
Put u = I/n. Then 
Hence E(1 /n) is the n-th root of e. From now on we write 
e" 
instead of E(u). 
Next we deal with the general exponential function. 

[VIII, ApP.] 
SYSTEMATIC PROOF 
281 
Let a be a positive number, and x any number. We define 
Thus 
If we put u = x log a and use log e" = u, we find the formula 
log aX = x log a. 
For instance, 
log 3ft = .fi log 3. 
Having made the general definition of aX, we must be sure that in 
those cases when we have a preconceived idea of what aX should be, for 
instance when x = n is a positive integer, then 
e"loga 
is the product of a with itself n times. 
For instance, take x = 2. Then 
and so forth. For any positive integer n we have 
enloga = eloga+loga+···+loga 
= a ·a···a 
(product taken n times). 
Therefore, if n is a positive integer, enloga means the product of a with 
itself n times. 
Similarly, 
(eO /nlloga)" = eO /n) logae(l /n) loga ... e(l /n)IOaa 
(product taken n times) 
= e(l /n)loga+(I /n)loga+ ... +(I /n)loga 
= a. 

282 
EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS 
[VIII, ApP.] 
Hence the n-th power of e(l/n»oga is equal to a, so 
e(l/n)IOga 
is the n-th root of a. 
This shows that exloga is what we expect when x is a positive integer or 
a fraction. 
Next we prove other properties of the function aX. First: 
Proof By definition, aO = eOloga = eO = 1. 
For all numbers x, y we have 
Proof We start with the right-hand side to get: 
This proves the formula. 
For all numbers x, y, 
Proof 
= eyxloga 
= e(x+y)loga 
(because uY = eylogu 
for u > 0) 
(because log aX = x log a) 
(because a' = elloga, with the 
special value t = xy = yx) 
thus proving the desired property. 
At this point we have recovered all five properties of the general ex-
ponential function which were used in §1, §2, and §3.

Part Three 
Integration 

CHAPTER 
IX 
I nteg ration 
In this chapter, we solve, more or less simultaneously, the following 
problems: 
(1) Given a function I(x), find a function F(x) such that 
F(x) = I(x). 
This is the inverse of differentiation, and is called integration. 
(2) Given a function I(x) which is ~ 0, give a definition of the area 
under the curve y = I(x) which does not appeal to geometric intuition. 
Actually, in this chapter, we give the ideas behind the solutions of our 
two problems. The techniques which allow us to compute effectively 
when specific data are given will be postponed to the next chapter. 
In carrying out (2) we shall follow an idea of Archimedes. It is to 
approximate the function I by horizontal functions, and the area under 
I by the sum of little rectangles. 
IX, §1. THE INDEFINITE INTEGRAL 
Let I(x) be a function defined over some interval. 
Definition. An indefinite integral for I is a function F such that 
F'(x) = I(x) 
for all x in the interval. 

288 
INTEGRATION 
[IX, §1] 
If G(x) is another indefinite integral of f, then G'(x) = f(x) also. Hence 
the derivative of the difference F -
G is 0: 
(F - G)'(x) = F'(x) - G'(x) = f(x) - f(x) = O. 
Consequently, by Corollary 3.3 of Chapter V, there is a constant C such 
that 
F(x) = G(x) + C 
for all x in the interval. 
Example 1. An indefinite integral for cos x would be sin x. But 
sin x + 5 is also an indefinite integral for cos x. 
Example 2. log x is an indefinite integral for l/x. So is log x + 10 or 
logx - n. 
In the next chapter, we shall develop techniques for finding indefinite 
integrals. Here, we merely observe that every time we prove a formula 
for a derivative, it has an analogue for the integral. 
It is customary to denote an indefinite integral of a function f by 
or f 
f(x) dx. 
In this second notation, the dx is meaningless by itself. It is only the full 
expression J f(x) dx which is meaningful. When we study the method of 
substitution in the next chapter, we shall get further confirmation for the 
practicality of our notation. 
We shall now make a table of some indefinite integrals, using the 
information which we have obtained about derivatives. 
Let n be an integer, n # - 1. Then we have 
f 
X"+l 
x" dx = n + 1· 
If n = - 1, then 
f 
~ dx = log x. 
(This is true only in the interval x > 0.) 

[IX, §1] 
THE INDEFINITE INTEGRAL 
In the interval x > 0 we also have 
I 
xc+l 
xCdx = --
c + 1 
for any number c # - 1. 
The following indefinite integrals are valid for all x. 
I 
cos x dx = sin x, 
I 
eX dx = eX, 
Finally, for - 1 < x < 1, we have 
I 
sin x dx = - cos X, 
I-_l_2 dx = arctan x. 
1 + x 
I p 
dx = arcsin x. 
1 - x2 
289 
In practice, one frequently omits mentioning over what interval the 
various functions we deal with are defined. However, in any specific 
problem, one has to keep it in mind. For instance, if we write 
this is valid for x > 0 and is also valid for x < O. But 0 cannot be in any 
interval of definition of our function. Thus we could have 
f 
x - 1/3 dx = ~ . X 2/3 + 5 
when x < 0 and 
I 
X- 1/3 dx = ~·X2/3 - 2 
when x > O. Any other constants besides 5 and - 2 could also be used. 
We agree throughout that indefinite integrals are defined only over 
intervals. Thus in considering the function l/x, we have to consider 
separately the cases x> 0 and x < O. 
For x> 0, we have already 
remarked that log x is an indefinite integral. It turns out that for the 

290 
INTEGRATION 
[IX, §1] 
interval x < 0 we can also find an indefinite integral, and in fact we have 
f 
~ dx = log(-x) 
for 
x < o. 
Observe that when x < 0, -x is posItIve, and thus log( -x) is mean-
ingful. The derivative of log( - x) is equal to l/x, by the chain rule, 
namely, let u = -x. Then du/dx = -I, and 
d log( - x) = _1_ (_ 1) = !. 
dx 
-x 
x 
For x < 0, any other indefinite integral is given by 
log( -x) + C, 
where C is a constant. 
It is sometimes stated that in all cases, 
f 
~ dx = loglxl + C. 
With our conventions, we do not attribute any meaning to this, because 
our functions are not defined over intervals (the missing point 0 prevents 
this). In any case, the formula would be false. Indeed, for x < 0 we have 
f 
~ dx = loglxl + C 1, 
and for x > 0 we have 
f 
~ dx = loglxl + C 2 · 
However, the two constants need not be equal, and hence we cannot 
write 
f 
~ dx = loglxl + C 
in all cases. This formula is true only over an interval not containing O.

(In these last two problems, specify the intervals over which you find an indefi-

IX, §2. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS 
Definition. Let f(x) be a function. We shall say that f is continuous if 
lim f(x + h) = f(x) 
h-O 
for all x at which the function is defined. 
It is understood that in taking the limit, only values of h for which 
f(x + h) is defined are considered. For instance, if f is defined on an 
interval 
(assuming a < b), then we would say that f is continuous at a if 
lim f(a + h) = f(a). 
h-O 
h>O 
We cannot take h < 0, since the function would not be defined for a + h 
if h < o. 
Geometrically speaking, a function is continuous if there is no break 
in its graph. 
All differentiable functions are continuous. We have 
already remarked this fact, because if a quotient 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
h 
has a limit, then the numerator f(x + h) - f(x) must approach 0, 
because 
lim f(x + h) - f(x) = lim h f(x + hh - f(x) 
h-O 
h-O 
= lim h lim f(x + h) - f(x) = o.

The following are graphs of functions which are not continuous.

which is unequal to f(O).

A similar phenomenon occurs in Fig. 2 where there is a break. (Cf. 
Example 6 of Chapter III, §2.) 
Figure 2 
IX, §3. AREA 
Let a < b be two numbers, and let f(x) be a continuous function defined 
on the interval a ~ x ~ b. This closed interval is denoted by [a, b]. 
We wish to find a function F(x) which is differentiable in this interval, 
and such that 
F'(x) = f(x). 
In this section, we appeal to our geometric intuition concerning area. 
We assume that f(x) ~ 0 for all x in the interval. We let: 
F(x) = numerical measure of the area under the graph of f between 
a and x. 

[IX, §3] 
AREA 
293 
The following figure illustrates this. 
F(x) 
a 
b 
We thus have F(a) = O. The area between a and a is O. 
Theorem 3.1. The function F(x) is differentiable, and its derivative is 
f(x). 
Proof Since we defined F geometrically, we shall have to argue geo-
metrically. 
We have to consider the Newton quotient 
F(x + h) - F(x) 
h 
Suppose first that x is unequal to the end point b, and also suppose that 
we consider only values of h > O. 
Then F(x + h) - F(x) is the area between x and x + h. A picture may 
look like this. 
f(8) f--,.... ....... ....------, 
f(t) 
x s 
x+h 
The shaded area represents F(x + h) - F(x). 
We let s be a point in the closed interval [x, x + h] which is a maxi-
mum for our function f in that small interval. We let t be a point in the 
same closed interval which is a minimum for f in that interval. Thus 
f(t) ~ f(u) ~ f(s) 
for all u satisfying 
x ~ u ~ x + h. 
(We are forced to use another letter, u, since x is already being used.) 

294 
INTEGRATION 
[IX, §3] 
The area under the curve between x and x + h is bigger than the area 
of the small rectangle in the figure above, i.e. the rectangle having base h 
and height f(t). 
The area under the curve between x and x + h is smaller than the 
area of the big rectangle, i.e. the rectangle having base h and height f(s). 
This gives us 
h· f(t) ~ F(x + h) - F(x) ~ h· f(s). 
Dividing by the positive number h yields 
f(t) ~ F(x + hh - F(x) ~ f(s). 
Since s, t are between x and x + h, as h approaches 0 both f(s) and f(t) 
approach f(x). Hence the Newton quotient for F is squeezed between 
two numbers which approach f(x). It must therefore approach f(x) 
itself, and we have proved Theorem 3.1, when h > o. 
The proof is essentially the same as the proof which we used to get 
the derivative of log x. The only difference in the present case is that we 
pick a maximum and a minimum without being able to give an explicit 
value for it, the way we could for the function l/x. Otherwise, there is 
no difference in the arguments. 
If x = b, we look at negative values for h. The argument in that case 
is entirely similar to the one we have written down in detail, and we find 
again that the Newton quotient of F is squeezed between f(s) and f(t). 
We leave it as an exercise. 
We now know that if F(x) denotes the area under the graph of f 
between a and x then 
F'(x) = f(x). 
We can compute the area in practice by the following property: 
Let G be any function on the interval a ~ x ~ b such that 
G'(x) = f(x). 
Suppose f(x) ~ 0 for all x. Then the area under the graph of f 
between x = a and x = b is equal to 
G(b) -
G(a). 

[IX, §3] 
AREA 
295 
Proof Since F'(x) = G'(x) for all x, the two functions F and G have 
the same derivative on the interval. Hence there is a constant C such 
that 
F(x) = G(x) + C 
for all x. 
Let x = a. We get 
o = F(a) = G(a) + C. 
This shows that C = - G(a). Hence letting x = b yields 
F(b) = G(b) - G(a). 
Thus the area under the curve between a and b is G(b) - G(a). This is 
very useful to know in practice, because we can usually guess the 
function G. 
Example 1. Find the area under the curve y = x 2 between x = 1 and 
x = 2. 
Let f(x) = x 2. If G(x) = x 3/3 then G'(x) = f(x). Hence the area 
under the curve between 1 and 2 is 
23

G(2) - G(I) = -

Example 2. Find the area under one arch of the function sin x. 
We have to find the area under the curve between 0 and n. Let 
G(x) = -cos x. 
Then G'(x) = sin x. Hence the area is 
G(n) - G(O) = -cos n - (-cos 0) 
=-(-1)+1 
= 2. 
Note how remarkable this is. The arch of the sine curve going from 0 to 
n seems to be a very irrational curve, and yet the area turns out to be 
the integer 2!

IX, §4. UPPER AND LOWER SUMS 
To show the existence of the integral, we use the idea of approximating 
our curves by constant functions. 
Example. Consider the function f(x) = x 2 . Suppose that we want to 
find the area between its graph and the x-axis, from x = 0 to x = 1. We 
cut up the interval [0,1] into smaller intervals, and approximate the 
function by constant functions, as shown on the next figure.

1 9 
We have used three intervals, of length 1/3, and on each of these inter-
vals, we take the constant function whose value is the square of the right 
end point of the interval. These values are, respectively, 
f(1 /3) = 1/9, 
f(2/3) = 4/9, 
f(1) = 1. 
Thus we obtain three rectangles, lying above the curve y = x 2• Each 
rectangle has a base of length 1/3. The sum of the areas of these rect-
angles is equal to 

[IX, §4] 
UPPER AND LOWER SUMS 
297 
We could also have taken rectangles lying below the curve, using the 
values of f at the left end points of the intervals. The picture is as 
follows: 
The heights of the three rectangles thus obtained are, respectively, 
f(O) = 0, 
f(1 /3) = 1/9, 
f(2/3) = 4/9. 
The sum of their areas is equal to 
Thus we know that the area under the curve y = x 2 between x = 0 and 
x = 1 lies between 5/27 and 14/27. This is not a very good approxima-
tion to this area, but we can get a better approximation by using smaller 
intervals, say of lengths 114, or 115, or 1/6, or in general lin. Let us 
write down the approximation with intervals of length lin. The end 
points of the intervals will then be

Such a sum is called an upper sum, because we took the maximum of the 
function X2 over each interval [k: 1 , ~ J 
When we take n larger and 
larger, it is plausible that such sums will approximate the area under the 
graph of X2 between 0 and 1. In any case, this upper sum is bigger than 
the area. 
We shall now write down in general the sums which approximate the 
area under a curve. Note that we can take rectangles lying above the 
curve or below the curve, thus giving rise to upper sums and lower sums. 
Let a, b be two numbers, with a ~ b. Let f be a continuous function 
in the interval a ~ x ~ b. 
Definition. A partition of the interval [a, b] is a sequence of numbers 
a = Xo ~ XI ~ X 2 ~ . .. ~ Xn = b also written 
{a = xo"",xn = b} 
between a and b, such that Xi ~ X i+ I (i = 0, 1, .. ,n - 1). For instance, we 
could take just two numbers, 
Xo = a 
and 
This will be called the trivial partition.

A partition divides our interval in a lot of smaller intervals [Xi' Xi + 1].

Given any number between a and b, in addition to Xo, .. 'Xn' we can add 
it to the partition to get a new partition having one more small interval. 
If we add enough intermediate numbers to the partition, then the inter-
vals can be made arbitrarily small. 
Let f be a function defined on the interval 
and continuous. If Ci is a point between Xi and Xi + l' then we form the 
sum 
Such a sum will be called a Riemann sum. Each value f(c i) can be 
viewed as the height of a rectangle, and each (xi + 1 -
Xi) can be viewed 
as the length of the base. 
Let Si be a point between Xi and xi + 1 such that f has a maximum in 
this small interval [Xi' Xi + 1] at Si. In other words, 
f(x) ~ f(sJ 
The rectangles then look like those in the next figure. In the figure, So 
happens to be equal to Xl' SI = SI as shown, S2 = X2, S3 = X 4 , S4 = S4 as 
shown. 
The main idea which we are going to carry out is that, as we make 
the intervals of our partitions smaller and smaller, the sum of the areas 
of the rectangles will approach a limit, and this limit can be used to 
define the area under the curve. 
If P is the partition given by the numbers 
then the sum 

300 
INTEGRATION 
[IX, §4] 
will be called the upper sum associated with the function f, and the 
partition P of the interval [a, b]. We shall denote it by the symbols 
or simply 
U(P, f). 
Observe, however, that when f(x) becomes negative, the value f(sJ 
may be negative. Thus the corresponding rectangle gives a negative 
contribution 
to the sum. Also, it is tiresome to write the sum by repeating each term, 
and so we shall use the abbreviation 
n-l 
L f(sJ(xi + 1 - xJ 
i=O 
to mean the sum when i ranges from 0 to n - 1 of the terms 
f(sJ(xi+ 1 - xJ Thus we have: 
Definition. The upper sum of f with respect to the partition is 
n-l 
U:(p, f) = L f(SiXXi+ 1 -
Xi), 
i=O 
where f(sJ is the maximum of f on the interval [Xi' Xi+ 1]. Note that 
the indices i range from 0 to n -
1. 
Thus the sum is taken for 
i = 0, .. . ,n -
1. 
By definition, we let 
max f = f(Si) = maximum of f on the interval 
Xi ~ X ~ Xi + 1· 
[Xi,Xi+ d 
Then the sum could also be written with the notation 
Instead of taking a maximum Si in the interval [Xi' Xi+ 1] we could 
have taken a minimum. Let ti be a point in this interval, such that 
f(tJ ~ f(x) 

[IX, §4] 
UPPER AND LOWER SUMS 
301 
We call the sum 
the lower sum associated with the function f, and the partition P of the 
interval [a, b]. The lower sum will be denoted by 
or simply 
L(P, f). 
Thus we have the 
Definition. The lower sum of f with respect to the partition is the sum 
n-1 
L:(p, f) = L f(tj)(Xj+ 1 -
Xj), 
j=O 
where f(tJ is the minimum of f on the interval [Xj, Xj+ 1]. 
On the next figure, we have drawn a typical term of the sum. 
Xi 
Si

Xi+l 
We can rewrite this lower sum using a notation similar to that used in 
the upper sum. Namely, we let 
min f = minimum of f on the interval [Xj, Xj+ 1] 
[Xi.Xi+ t1 
= f(tJ 
Then 
For all numbers x in the interval [Xj, Xj+ 1] we have 
f(tJ ~ f(x) ~ f(sJ 

302 
INTEGRATION 
[IX, §4] 
Since x i + 1 -
Xi is ~ 0, it follows that each term of the lower sum is less 
than or equal to each term of the upper sum. Therefore 
L~(P, f) ~ U~(P, f). 
Furthermore, any Riemann sum taken with points ci (which are not 
necessarily maxima or minima) is between the lower and upper sum. 
Example. Let f(x) = x 2 and let the interval be [0, 1]. Write out the 
upper and lower sums for the partition consisting of {O, t, I}. 
The minimum of the function in the interval [0, t] is at 0, and 
f(O) = 0. The minimum of the function in the interval [1,1] is at t and 
f(t) = t· Hence the lower sum is 
LMP, f) = f(O)(t - 0) + f<!)(1 - t) = t· t = !. 
The maximum of the function in the interval [0, t] is at t and the 
maximum of the function in the interval [t, 1] is at 1. Thus the upper 
sum is 
UMP, f) = f(t)(t - 0) + f(1)(1 - t) = ! + t = i· 
We have given a numerical value for the upper and lower sums. Unless 
we wanted to compare them explicitly, we could have left the answer in 
the shape that it has on the left-hand side of these equalities.

Observe that the first term of the lower sum is ° because the minimum 
of the function sin x on the interval [0, n/4] is equal to 0. Similarly, the 
fourth term is also 0, and so can be omitted since ° + A = A for all 
numbers A. 
Also observe that: 
minimum of sin x on the interval [5n/4, 6n/4] = sin 6n/4 
= -1. 
With negative numbers, we have for instance 
- 1 = sin 6n/4 < - ~ 
= sin 5n/4. 
Thus the lower sum L(P, f) contains positive terms and negative terms. 

304 
INTEGRATION 
[IX, §4] 
The negative terms represent minus the area of certain rectangles, as 
shown on the figure. 
What happens to our sums when we add a new point to a partition? 
We shall see that the lower sum increases and the upper sum decreases. 
Theorem 4.1. Let f be a continuous function on the interval [a, b]. Let 
be a partition of [a, b]. Let x be any number in the interval, and let Q 
be the partition obtained from P by adding x to (xo,'" ,x.). Then 
L~(P, f) ~ L~(Q, f) ~ U~(Q, f) ~ U~(P, f). 
Proof. Let us look at the lower sums, for example. Suppose that our 
number x is between Xj and xj+ I: 
When we form the lower sum for P, it will be the same as the lower sum 
for Q except that the term 
f(t)(x j+ I - x) 
will now be replaced by two terms. If u is a mmlmum for f in the 
interval between Xj and X, and v is a minimum for f in the interval 
between x and x j + I' then these two terms are 
f(u)(x - x) + f(v)(xj+ I -
x). 
We can write f(t)(xj+ I - x) in the form 
f(t)(Xj+ I -
Xj) = f(t)(x - x) + f(t)(x j+ 1 - x). 
Since f(t) ~ f(u) and f(t) ~ f(v) (because tj was a mlOlmum in the 
whole interval between Xj and Xj+ 1)' it follows that 
f(tj)(x j+ 1 - x) ~ f(u)(x - x) + f(v)(xj+ 1 - x). 
Thus when we replace the term in the sum for P by the two terms in the 
sum for Q, the value of the contribution of these two terms IOcreases. 
Since all other terms are the same, our assertion is proved. 
The assertion concerning the fact that the upper sum decreases is left 
as an exercise. The proof is very similar. 

[IX, §4] 
UPPER AND LOWER SUMS 
305 
As a consequence of our theorem, we obtain: 
Corollary 4.2. Every lower sum is less than or equal to every upper 
sum. 
Proof. Let P and Q be two partitions. If we add to P all the points 
of Q and add to Q all the points of P, we obtain a partition R such that 
every point of P is a point of R and every point of Q is a point of R. 
Thus R is obtained by adding points to P and to Q. Consequently, we 
have the inequalities 
This proves our assertion. 
It is now a very natural question to ask whether there is a unique 
number between the lower sums and the upper sums. The answer is yes. 
Theorem 4.3. Let f be a continuous function on [a, b]. There exists a 
unique number which is greater than or equal to every lower sum and 
less than or equal to every upper sum. 
Definition. The definite integral of f between a and b 
is the unique number which is greater than or equal to every lower sum, 
and less than or equal to every upper sum. 
We shall also use notation like 
or 
ff(t)dt. 
It does not matter which letter we use, but it should be the same letter 
in both occurrences, i.e. in f(x) dx or f(t) dt, or f(u) du, etc. 
We shall not give the details of the proof of Theorem 4.3, which are 
tedious. The technique involved will not be used anywhere else in the 
course. 
There is another statement which it is illuminating to know. Let P be 
a partition, 

306 
INTEGRATION 
[IX, §4] 
The maximum length of the intervals [Xi' X i+ 1] is called the size of the 
partition. For example, if we cut up the interval [0,1] into n small 
intervals of the same length lin, then the size of this partition is lin. 
Theorem 4.4. Let f be a continuous function on [a, b]. Then the lower 
sums L:(P, f) and the upper sums U:(P, f) corne arbitrarily close to the 
integral 
if the size of the partition P is sufficiently small. 
Again, we shall not prove this theorem. But intuitively, it tells us that 
the upper and lower sums are good approximations to the integral when 
the size of the partition is taken sufficiently small. 
Example. We give a physical example illustrating the application of 
upper and lower sums, relating density to mass. 
Consider an interval [a, b] with 0 ~ a < b. We think of this interval 
as a rod, and let f be a continuous positive function defined on this 
interval. We interpret f as a density on the rod, so that f(x) is the 
density at x. 
Xo = a 
b = Xft 
x-axis 
Given 
a ~ c ~ d ~ b, 
we denote by M~(f) the mass of the rod between c and d, corresponding 
to the given density f. We wish to determine a mathematical notion to 
represent M~(f). If f is a constant density, with constant value K ~ ° 
on [c, d], then the mass M~(f) should be K(d - c). On the other hand, 
if g is another density such that 
f(x) ~ g(x), 
then certainly we should have M~(f) ~ M~(g). In particular, if k, K are 
constants ~ ° such that 
k ~ f(x) ~ K 

[IX, §4] 
UPPER AND LOWER SUMS 
307 
for x in the interval [c, d], then the mass should satisfy 
k(d - c) ~ M~(f) ~ K(d - c). 
Finally, the mass should be additive, that is the mass of two disjoint 
pieces should be the sum of the mass of the pieces. In particular, 
M~(f) + M~(f) = M~(f) . 
We shall now see that the mass of the rod is given by the integral of 
the density, that is 
M~(f) = f f(x) dx. 
Let P be a partition of the interval [a, b]: 
Let f(t j) be the minimum for f on the small interval [Xj, X j + I]' and let 
f(sj) be the maximum for f on this same small interval. Then the mass 
of each piece of the rod between Xj and X j+ 1 satisfies the inequality 
Adding these together, we find 
n-I 
n-I 
L f(tJ(x j+ 1 - xJ ~ M!(f) ~ L f(sJ(Xj+ 1 - xJ 
j=Q 
i=O 
The expressions on the left and right are lower and upper sums for the 
integral, respectively. Since the integral is the unique number between 
the lower sums and upper sum, it follows that 
M~(f) = ff(X)dX, 
as we wanted to show.

IX, §5. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 
The integral satisfies two basic properties which are very similar to those 
satisfied by area. We state them explicitly. 
Property 1. If M, m are two numbers such that 
m ~ f(x) ~ M 
for all x in the interval [b, c], then 
m(c - b) ~ J:f ~ M(c - b). 
Property 2. We have 
We shall not give the details of the proofs of these properties but we 
make some comments which we hope make them clear. 
For Property 1, suppose we want to verify the inequality on the left-
hand side. We may take the trivial partition of the interval [b, c] con-
sisting just of this interval. Then a lower sum is certainly ~ m(c - b). 
Since the lower sums increase when we take a finer partition, and since 
the lower sums are at most equal to the integral, we see that the left-
hand inequality 
IS true. The right-hand inequality of Property 
is proved in the same 
way. 

[IX, §5] 
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 
309 
For Property 2, suppose that a ~ b ~ c. Let P be a partition of suffi-
ciently small size, such that the lower sum L~(P, f) approximates the 
integral J~ f very closely. The point b may not be in this partition. We 
may take a finer partition by inserting this point b, as shown on the 
figure. 
pI 
pI!

Then P together with b form partitions P' and P" of the intervals [a, b] 
and [b, c]. If P has sufficiently small size, then P' and P" have small size, 
and the lower sums 
and 
L',,(P", f) 
give good approximations to the integrals 
and 
respectively. But we have 
L~(P', P", f) = L:(P', f) + L',,(P", f). 
Since L~(P', P", f) is an approximation of the integral 
one can see by passing to a limit that 
Property 2 was formulated when a < b < c. We now want to formu-
late it when a, b, c are taken in any order. For this, suppose a, bare 
numbers in an interval where f is continuous, and b < a. We define 

310 
INTEGRATION 
[IX, §5] 
Then we have Property 2 in general: 
Let a, b, c be three numbers in an interval where f is continuous. 
Then 
Proof 
We have to distinguish cases. 
Suppose for instance that 
b < a < c. Then by the original property, for this ordering we get 
by definition. 
Adding S: to both sides proves the desired relation. All other cases can 
be proved similarly. 
Theorem 5.1. Let f be continuous on an interval [a, b]. Let 
F(x) = ff. 
Then F is differentiable and its derivative is 
P(x) = f(x). 
Proof We have to form the Newton quotient 
F(x + h) - F(x) = ! (IX+h _ IX )

and see if it approaches a limit as h --+ O. (If x = a, then it is to be 
understood that h > 0, and if x = b, then h < O. If a < x < b, then h 
may be positive or negative. The proof then shows that f is right differ-
entiable at a and left differentiable at b.) 
Assume for the moment that h > O. By Property 2, applied to the 
numbers a, x, x + h we conclude that our Newton quotient is equal to

This reduces our investigation of the Newton quotient to the interval 
between x and x + h. 
Let s be a point between x and x + h such that f reaches a maximum 
in this small interval [x, x + h] and let t be a point in this interval such 

[IX, §5] 
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 
311 
that f reaches a minimum. We let 
m = f(t) 
and 
M = f(s) 
and apply Property 1 to the interval [x, x + h]. We obtain 
f
X+h 
f(t)(x + h - x) ~ x 
f ~ f(s)(x + h - x), 
which we can rewrite as 
f

f(t) . h ~ x 
f ~ f(s) . h. 
Dividing by the positive number h preserves the inequalities, and yields 
JX+hf 
f(t) ~ T 
~ f(s). 
Since s, t lie between x and x + h, we must have (by continuity) 
lim f(s) = f(x) 
and 
lim f(t) = f(x). 
h-O 
h-O 
Thus our Newton quotient is squeezed between two numbers which 
approach f(x). It must therefore approach f(x), and our theorem is 
proved when h > O. 
The argument when h < 0 is entirely similar. We omit it.

CHAPTER 
X 
Properties of the Integral 
This is a short chapter. It shows how the integral combines with addi-
tion and inequalities. There is no good formula for the integral of a 
product. The closest thing is integration by parts, which is postponed to 
the next chapter. 
Connecting the integral with the derivative is what allows us to com-
pute integrals. The fact that two functions having the same derivative 
differ by a constant is again exploited to the hilt. 
X, §1. FURTHER CONNECTION WITH THE DERIVATIVE 
Let f be a continuous function on some interval. Let a, b be two points 
of the interval such that a < b, and let F be a function which is differen-
tiable on the interval and whose derivative is f 
a 
x 
b 
By the fundamental theorem, the functions 
F(x) 
and 
have the same derivative. Hence there is a constant C such that 
ff= F(x) + C 
for all x in the interval. 

[X, §1] 
FURTHER CONNECTION WITH THE DERIVATIVE 
313 
What is this constant? If we put x = a, we get 
o = r 
f = F(a) + C, 
whence C = - F(a). We also have 
ff= F(b) + C. 
From this we obtain: If dF/dx = f(x), then 
f 
f = F(b) - F(a). 
This is extremely useful in practice, because we can usually guess the 
function F, and once we have guessed it, we can then compute the inte-
gral by means of this relation. 
Furthermore, it is also practical to use the notation 
F(X{ = F(b) - F(a). 
Remark. The argument which we gave to compute C shows that the 
value F(b) - F(a) does not depend on the choice of function F such that 
F'(x) = f(x). But you may want to see this another way. Suppose that 
G'(x) = f(x) also, for all x in the interval. Then there is a constant C 
such that 
G(x) = F(x) + C 
for all x in the interval. 
Then 
G(b) - G(a) = F(b) + C - [F(a) + C] 
= F(b) - F(a) 
because C cancels. 
Finally, we shall usually call the indefinite integral such as 
f 
sin x dx, 
or f 1: x 2 dx 

314 
PROPERTIES OF THE INTEGRAL 
[X, §I] 
simply an integral, since the context makes clear what is meant. When 
we deal with a definite integral 
the numbers a and b are sometimes called the lower limit and upper limit 
respectively. 
Example. We want to find the integral 
J:sin x dx. 
Here we have f(x) = sin x, and the indefinite integral is 
f 
sin x dx = F(x) = -cos x. 
Hence 
f:sin x 
dx = -cos xl: = -cos n - (-cos 0) = 2.

PROPERTIES OF THE INTEGRAL 
[X, §1] 
In working out and proving similar inequalities, you should give: 
The function f(x); 
The interval [a, b] and the value of the definite integral 
ff(X)dX; 
The partition P of the interval [a, b]. 
You should then identify the sum with a lower sum (or upper sum, as 
the case may be) with respect to the above data, thus obtaining a com-
parison with the integral of the desired type. 
Example. By a similar method, one can give an inequality having 
considerable practical interest. Let n! denote the product of the first n 
integers. Thus 
We have the first few: 
n! = 1 . 2 . 3 ... n. 
I! = 1, 
2! = 1· 2 = 2, 
3! = 1 . 2 . 3 = 6, 
4!= 1·2·3·4=6·4=24, 
5! = 24· 5 = 120. 
Exercise 10 will show you how to prove the inequality 
It is fun to work it out, so we don't do it here in the text. 
The principle of these examples applies to comparing sums of func-
tions with integrals, and the functions may be decreasing, as, for instance, 
the functions

X, §2. SUMS 
Let f(x) and g(x) be two functions defined over some interval, and let 
F(x) and G(x) be (indefinite) integrals for f and g, respectively. This 
means F'(x) = f(x) and G'(x) = g(x). Since the derivative of a sum is the 
sum of the derivatives, we see that F + G is an integral for f + g; in 
other words, 
(F + G)'(x) = F'(x) + G'(x), 
and therefore 
f [f(x) + g(x)] dx = ff(X) dx + f g(x) dx. 
Similarly, let c be a number. The derivative of cF(x) is cf(x). Hence 
f cf(x) dx = c ff(X) dx. 
A constant can be taken in and out of an integral. 
Example. Find the integral of sin x + 3X4. 
We have 
f 
(sin x + 3x4 ) dx = f 
sin x dx + f 
3x4 dx 
= -cos x + 3x5/5. 
Any formula involving the indefinite integral yields a formula for the 
definite integral. Using the same notation as above, suppose we have to 
find 
f [f(x) + g(x)] dx. 
We know that it is 
[F(x) + G(x)] [ 
which is equal to 
F(b) + G(b) - F(a) - G(a). 

320 
PROPERTIES OF THE INTEGRAL 
Thus we get the formula 
f [f(x) + g(x)] dx = f f(x) dx + f g(x) dx. 
Similarly, for any constant c, 
f 
cf(x) dx = c f f(x) dx. 
Example. Find the integral 
f: [sin x + 3x4] dx. 
This (definite) integral is equal to 
-cos x + 3X5/sl: = -cos n + 3n5/S - (-cos 0 + 0) 
= 1 + 3n5/5 + 1 
= 2 + 3n 5/5. 
[X, §2] 
In some applications, one meets a slightly wider class of functions 
than continuous ones. Let f be a function defined on an interval [a, b]. 
We shall say that f is piecewise continuous on [a, b] if there exist 
numbers 
a = ao < a I < .. . < an = b 
and on each interval [ai-I' aJ there is a continuous function /; such that 
f(x) = /;(x) for ai _ I < X < ai • If this is the case, then we define the inte-
gral of f from a to b to be the sum 
A piecewise continuous function may look like this:

Example. Let f be the function defined on the interval [0, 2] by the 
conditions: 
f(x) = x 
f(x) = 2 
if 0 ~ x ~ 1, 
if 1 < x ~ 2. 
The graph of f looks like this: 
•

To find the integral of f between 0 and 2, we have 
f:f= LlxdX + I22dx = ~21: + 2xl: 
=! + (4 - 2) = l 
We can also find 
J: f(t) dt 
for 0 ~ x ~ 2. 
IfO~x~l: 
If 1 ~ x ~ 2: 
f: f(t) dt = fol f(t) dt + IX f(t) dt 
= ! + IX 2 dt = ! + 2x - 2. 
Example. Let f(x) be defined for 0 ~ x ~ n by the formulas: 
f(x) = sin x 
f(x) = cos x 
if 0 ~ x < n/2, 
if n/2 ~ x ~ n.

The graph of f looks like this: 
The integral of a function represents the area between the graph 
of the function and the x-axis only when the function is positive. If 
the function is negative, then this area is represented by minus the 
integral. 
Example. The function sin x is negative on the interval En, 2n]. The 
area between the curve y = sin x and the x-axis over this interval is 
given by minus the integral: 
(2" 
12" 
- J" sinxdx = -(-cos x) " = 2. 
The area between the graph of sin x and the x-axis between 0 and 2n is 
equal to twice the area of one of the loops, and is therefore equal to 4.

Example. Find the area between the curve

and the x-axis, 
The curve looks like this: 
There are two portions between the curve and the x-axis, corresponding 
to the intervals [0, 1] and [1, 2]. However, the function is negative 
between x = 1 and x = 2, so that to find the sum of the areas of the two 
regions, we have to take the absolute value of the integral over the 
second one. We therefore compute these areas separately. 
First we expand the product giving f(x), and get 
f(x) = x 3 -
3x2 + 2x.

You may wait to read this section until it is used to estimate remainder

continuous functions on the interval [a, b] and assume that fix) ~ g(x) 
for all x in the interval. Then r 
f(x) dx ~ r 
g(x) dx. 
Proof Since g(x) - f(x) ~ 0, we can use the basic Property 1 of 
Chapter IX, §5 (with m = 0) to conclude that 

[X, §3] 
INEQUALITIES 
327 
But 
Transposing the second integral on the right in our inequality, we obtain 
as desired. 
Theorem 3.1 will be used mostly when g(x) = lJ(x)l. Since a negative 
number is always ~ a positive number, we know that 
f(x) ~ If(x)1 
and 
-f(x) ~ If(x)l. 
Theorem 3.2. Let a, b be two numbers, with a ~ b. Let f be a contin-
uous function on the interval [a, b]. Then 
If f(x) dxl ~ f'f(X)' dx. 
Proof We simply let g(x) = If(x) I in the preceding theorem. Then 
f(x) ~ If(x)1 
and also -f(x) ~ If(x)l. The absolute value of the integral on the left 
is equal to 
ff(X)dX 
or 
- ff(X)dX . 
We can apply Theorem 3.1 either to f(x) or -f(x) to get Theorem 3.2. 
We make one other application of Theorem 3.2. 
Theorem 3.3. Let a, b be two numbers and f a continuous function on 
the closed interval between a and b. (We do not necessarily assume that 
a < b.) Let M be a number such that If(x)1 ~ M for all x in the 
interval. Then 
If f(x) dxl ~ Mlb - al· 

328 
PROPERTIES OF THE INTEGRAL 
[X, §3] 
Proof If a ~ b, we can use Theorem 3.2 to get 
If b < a, then 
Taking the absolute value gives us the estimate M(a - b). Since 
a-b= Ib-al 
in case b < a, we have proved our theorem. 
Theorem 3.4. Let f be a continuous function on the interval [a, b] with 
a < b. Assume that f(x) ~ 0 for every x in this interval, and f(x) > 0 
for some x in this interval. Then 
ff(X)dX > o. 
Proof Let c be a number of the interval such that f(c) > 0, and 
suppose for simplicity that c :f= b. 
The geometric idea behind the proof is quite simple, in terms of area. 
Since the function f is assumed ~ 0 everywhere, and > 0 at the point c, 
then it is greater than some fixed positive number [taken to be f(c)/2, 
say] in some interval near c. This means that we can insert a small 
rectangle of height > 0 between the curve y = f(x) and the x-axis. Then 
the area under the curve is at least equal to the area of this rectangle, 
which is > O. 
This "proof" can be phrased in terms of the formal properties of the 
integral as follows. Since f is continuous, there exists some number d 
close to c in the interval, with c < d ~ b such that f(x) is close to f(c) 
for all x satisfying 
c ~ x ~ d.

In particular, we have

~ f;C) (d - c) > O. 
This proves our theorem if c =f. b. If c = b, we take d < c and argue 
similarly. 
Theorem 3.4 will not be used in the rest of this book except in a 
couple of exercises, but it is important in subsequent applications.

Example 2. 
However, it is remarkable that an entirely different 
situation will occur when we consider the area under the curve 
I/Jx = X- 1/2. We take x> 0, of course. Let °

the integral:

that at first sight, it does not differ so much from that of the preceding 
example, but the computation of the area shows the existence of a funda-
mental difference.

Graph of y = Jx

Both in Example 1 and Example 2 we are looking at an infinite chim-
ney, as c --+ 0. But in Example 1 the area becomes arbitrarily large, 
whereas in Example 2, the area approaches the limit 2. 
Definition. In Example 2, we say that the integral 
exists, or converges even though the function x- 1/2 is not defined at ° 
and is not continuous in the closed interval [0, 1]. 
In general, suppose we have two numbers a, b with, say, a < b. Let f 
be a continuous function in the interval a < x ~ b. This means that for 

[X, §4] 
IMPROPER INTEGRALS 
331 
every number c with a < c < b, the function f IS continuous on the 
interval 
c ~ x ~ b. 
Let F be any function such that F'(x) = f(x). 
We can then evaluate the integral as usual: 
r 
f(x) dx = F(b) - F(c). 
Definition. If the limit 
lim F(c) 
exists, then we say that the improper integral 
ff(X)dX 
exists, and then we define 
f f(x) dx = !i: r 
f(x) dx = F(b) - !i: F(c). 
We make similar definitions when we deal with an interval a ~ x < b 
and a function f which is continuous on this interval. If the limit 
lim IC f(x) dx 
c-b 
a 
exists, then we say that the improper integral exists, and it is equal to 
this limit.

But

Hence the integral does not exist. 
There is another type of improper integral, dealing with large values. 
Let a be a number and f a continuous function defined for x ~ a. 
Consider the integral 
{B f(x) dx 
for some number B > a. If F(x) is any indefinite integral of f, then our 
integral is equal to F(B) - F(a). If it approaches a limit as B becomes 
very large, then we define 
fa'" f(x) dx 
or f '" f = lim fB f(x) dx,

tion and l/x, except that 1/x 2 < l/x when x > 1. However, intuitively 
speaking, we shall find that l/x2 approaches 0 sufficiently faster than l/x 
to guarantee that the area under the curve between 1 and B approaches 
a limit as B becomes large.

the function f being f(u) = u3. We abbreviate (dujdx) dx by du, as if we 
could cancel dx. Then we can write the integral as 
We can check this by differentiating the expression on the right, using 
the chain rule. We get 
as desired. 
Example 2. Find J sin(2x)(2) dx. 
Put u = 2x. Then du/dx = 2. Hence our integral is in the form 
I 
sin u ~: dx = I 
sin u du = -cos u = -cos(2x). 
Observe that 
f 
sin(2x) dx "# -cos(2x). 
If we differentiate -cos(2x), we get sin(2x) · 2. 
The integral in Example 2 could also be written 
I 
2 sin(2x) dx. 
It does not matter, of course, where we place the 2. 
Example 3. Find J cos(3x) dx. 
Let u = 3x. Then dujdx = 3. There is no extra 3 in our integral. 
However, we can take a constant in and out of an integral. Our integral 
is equal to

It is convenient to use a purely formal notation which allows us to 
make a substitution u = g(x), as in the previous examples. Thus instead 
of writing 
du 
-
=2x 
dx 
in Example 1, we would write du = 2x dx. Similarly, in Example 2, we 
would write du = 2 dx, and in Example 3 we would write du = 3 dx. We 
do not attribute any meaning to this. It is merely a device of a type 
used in programming a computing machine. A machine does not think. 
One simply adjusts certain electric circuits so that the machine performs 
a certain operation and comes out with the right answer. The fact that 
writing 
du 
du = -
dx 
dx 
makes us come out with the right answer will be proved in a moment. 
Example 4. Find 
Let 
u = x 3 + x. 
Then 
du = (3x 2 + J) dx. 
Hence our integral is of type f f(u) du and is equal to 
We now show how the above procedure, which can be checked in 
each case by differentiation, actually must give the right answer in all 
cases. 
We suppose therefore that we wish to evaluate an integral of the form 
f 
du 
f(u) dx dx, 
where u is a function of x. Let F be a function such that 
F'(u) = f(u). 

338 
TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 
[XI, §1] 
Thus F is an indefinite integral 
F(u) = f 
f(u) duo 
If we use the chain rule, we get 
dF(u(x)) _ dF du -f 
du 
dx 
-
du dx -
(u) dx ' 
Thus we have proved that 
f 
du 
f(u) dx dx = F(u(x)) 
as desired. 
We should also observe that the formula for integration by substi-
tution applies to the definite integral. We can state this formally as 
follows. 
Let 9 be a differentiable function on the interval [a, b], whose derivative 
is continuous. Let f be a continuous function on an interval containing 
the values of g. Then 
fb 
dg 
f9(b) 
f(g(x)) d dx =

a 
X 
g(a) 
The proof is immediate. If F is an indefinite integl al for f, then 
F(g(x)) is an indefinite integral for 
dg 
f(g(x)) dx 
by the chain rule. Hence the left-hand side of our formula is equal to 
F(g(b)) -
F(g(a)), 
which is also the value of the right-hand side. 
Example 5. Suppose that we consider the integral 

[XI, §1]

with u = x3 + x. When x = 0, U = 0, and when x = 1, U = 2. Thus our 
definite integral is equal to 
[2 u9 du = u1°12 = 210.

Example 6. Evaluate 
[In 
Jo x sin x2 dx. 
We let u = x2, du = 2x dx. When x = 0, u = 0. When x = fi, u = 7r. 
Thus our integral is equal to 
t t"Sin u du = 1< -cos U)I: = 1< -cos 7r + cos 0) = 1. 
Example 7. Evaluate

We let u = 1 - x2 so du = -2x dx. Then x2 = 1 -

Substituting u = 1 - x 2 gives the answer in terms of x.

Using the formula for the integral of a sum, which is the sum of the 
integrals, and the fact that 
f

----;J-;- dx = f(x)g(x), 
we obtain 
f 
dg 
f 
df 
f(x) dx dx = f(x)g(x) -
g(x) dx dx, 
which is called the formula for integrating by parts. 
If we let u = f(x) and v = g(x), then the formula can be abbreviated in 
our shorthand notation as follows: 
f 
u dv = uv - f 
v duo 
Example 1. Find the integral f log x dx. 
Let u = log x and dv = dx. Then du = (l /x) dx and v = x. Hence our 
integral is in the form f u dv and is equal to 
uv - f v du = x log x - f 1 dx = x log x-x. 
Example 2. Find the integral f xeX dx. 
Let u = x and dv = eX dx. Then du = dx and v = eX. So 
Observe how du/dx is a simpler function than u itself, whereas v and 
dv/dx are the same, in the present case. A similar procedure works for 
integrals of the form J xneX dx when n is a positive integer, putting 
u = xn, du = nxn- 1 dx. See Exercises 7 and 8. 
The two preceding examples illustrate a general fact: Passing from the 
function u to du/dx in the process of integrating by parts will work 
provided that going up from dv to v does not make this side of the 
procedure too much worse. In the first example, with u = log x, then 
du/dx = l/x is a simpler function (a power of x), while going up from 
dv = dx to v = x still only contributes powers of x to the procedure. 
Next we give an example where we have to integrate by parts twice 
before getting an answer. 

[XI, §2] 
INTEGRATION BY PARTS 
343 
Example 3. Find J eX sin x dx. 
Let u = eX and dv = sin x dx. Then 
du = eX dx 
and 
v = -cos x. 
If we call our integral I, then 
1 = - eX cos x - f -eX cos x dx 
= - eX cos x + f 
eX cos x dx. 
This looks as if we were going around in circles. Don't lose heart. 
Rather, repeat the same procedure on eX cos x. Let 
and 
dz = cos x dx. 
Then, 
dt = eX dx 
and 
z = smx. 
The second integral becomes 
f 
t dz = tz - f 
z dt = eX sin x - f 
eX sin x dx. 
We have come back to our original integral 
f 
eX sin x dx 
but with a minus sign! Thus 
1 = - eX cos x + eX sin x-I. 
Hence 
21 = eX sin x -
eX cos x, 
and dividing by 2 gives us the value 
eX sin x -
eX cos x

We give an example where we first make a substitution before inte-
grating by parts.

Example 4. Find the integral J e- Jx dx. 
We let x = u2 so that dx = 2u duo Then 
This can now be integrated by parts with u = u and dv = e- U duo Then 
v = - e - u, and you can do the rest. 
Remark. It can be shown, although not easily, that no procedure will 
allow you to express the integral 
in terms of the standard functions: powers of x, trigonometric functions, 
exponential and log function, sums, products, or composites of these.

In the next improper integrals, we shall use limits from the theory of exponentials

integer, then 
B" 
lim 8=0. 
8- 00 e 
Also 
lim a log a = O . 
• -0 
The first limit states that the exponential function becomes large faster than any 
polynomial. The second limit can be deduced from the first, namely write 
a = e- 8 . Then a -+ 0 if and only if B -+ 00. But log a = - B. So

The next two examples deal with odd powers of sine or cosine. A 
method can be used in this case, but cannot be used when there are only 
even powers. 
Example. We wish to find 
I 
sin3 x dx. 
We replace sin2 x by 1 - cos2 x, so that 
f 
sin 3 x dx = f 
(sin x)(l - cos2 x) dx 
= f 
sin x dx - f 
(cos2 x)(sin x) dx. 
The second of these last integrals can be evaluated by the substitution 
u = cos x, 
du = -sin x dx. 
We therefore find that 
I . 
cos 3 x 
sm3 x dx = -cos x + - 3-' 
For low powers of the sine and cosine, the above means are the 
easiest. Especially if we have to integrate an odd power of the sine or 
cosine, we can use a similar method.

TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 
Example. Find 1= f 
sin 5 x cos2 x dx. 
We replace 
so that 
f 
sin 5 x cos 2 x dx = f 
(1 - cos2 X)2 cos2 x sin x dx. 
Now we put 
u = cos x 
and 
du = -sin x dx. 
Then 
[XI, §3] 
If you want the answer in terms of x, you substitute back u = cos x in 
this last expression. 
In the two preceding examples, we had an odd power of the sme. 
Then by using the identity sin 2 x = 1 - cos2 x and the substitution 
u = cos x, 
du = -sin x dx, 
we transform the integral into a sum of integrals of the form 
where n is a positive integer. 
This method works only when there is an odd power of sine or 
cosine. In general, one has to use another method to integrate arbitrary 
powers. 
There is a general way in which one can integrate sinn x for any 
positive integer n: integrating by parts. Let us take first an example. 
Example. Find the integral J sin 3 x dx. 

[XI, §3] 
TRIGONOMETRIC INTEGRALS 
349 
We write the integral in the form 
I = f 
sin2 x sin x dx. 
Let u = sin 2 x and dv = sin x dx. Then 
du = 2 sin x cos x dx 
and 
v= -cosx. 
Thus 
1= -(sin2 x)(cos x) - f -cos x(2 sin x cos x) dx 
= - sin2 x cos x + 2 f 
cos2 x sin x dx. 
This last integral could then be determined by substitution, for instance 
t = cos x 
and 
dt = -sin x dx. 
The last integral becomes - 2 J t2 dt, and hence 
I = f 
sin3 x dx = - sin2 x cos x - t cos3 x. 
To deal with an arbitrary positive integer n, we shall show how to 
reduce the integral J sinn x dx to the integral J sinn - 2 x dx. Proceeding 
stepwise downwards will give a method for getting the full answer.

f · d

Proof We write the integral as 
In = f 
sinn x dx = f 
sinn - 1 X sin x dx. 
Let u = sinn- 1 x and dv = sin x dx. Then 
du = (n - 1) sinn- 2 x cos x dx 
and 
v = -cos x. 

350 
Thus 
TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 
In= -sinn-1xcosx- f -(n-l)cosxsinn- 2xcosxdx 
= -sinn- 1 x cos x + (n - 1) f sinn- 2 x cos2 X dx. 
We replace cos2 x by 1 - sin 2 x and get 
[XI, §3] 
In= -sinn-1xcosx+(n-l) fSinn-2XdX-(n-l) fSinnxdx. 
Therefore 
In = -sinn- 1 x cos x + (n - 1)/n-2 - (n - 1)/n' 
whence 
nln = -sinn- 1 xcosx + (n - 1)/n- 2. 
Dividing by n gives us our formula. 
We leave the proof of the analogous formula for cosine as an exercise.

cosn x dx = ~ cosn- 1 X sin x + -n-

These functions are less used than sine and cosine, and hence we don't 
write out the formulas, to lighten this printed page which would other-
wise become oppressive. 
Mixed powers of sine and cosine 
One can integrate mixed powers of sine and cosine by replacing sin 2 x 
by 1 - cos2 x, for instance. 
Example. Find f sin 2 x cos2 x dx. 
Replacing cos2 x by 1 - sin 2 x, we see that our integral is equal to 
f sin 2 x dx - f sin 4 x dx, 

[XI, §3]

which we know how to integrate. We could also use a special trick for 
this case, making the substitutions at the beginning of the section. Thus 
. 
1 - cos 2 2x 
(sm 2 x)( cos 2 x) = 
4 
' 
which reduces the powers inside the integral. Another application of this 
same type, namely 
22 
1 + cos 4x 
cos 
x = 
2 
reduces our problem still further. Take your pick and work out the 
integral completely as an exercise. 
Warning. Because of trigonometric identities like 
sin 2 x = - t cos 2x + t 
different forms for the answers are possible. They will differ by a con-
stant of integration. 
When we meet an integral involving a square root, we -can frequently 
get rid of the square root by making a trigonometric substitution. 
Example. Find the area of a circle of radius 3. 
The equation of the circle is 
x2 + y2 = 9, 
and the portion of the circle in the first quadrant IS described by the 
function 
3 
Y = )32 _ x 2 
-3

-3 
One-fourth of the area is therefore given by the integral 
fo
3 J3 2 - x2 dx. 

352 
TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 
[XI, §3] 
For such integrals, we want to get rid of the horrible square root sign, 
so we try to make the expression under the integral into a perfect 
square. We use the substitution 
x = 3 sin t 
and 
dx = 3 cos t dt, 
with 0 ~ t ~ n12. 
When t = 0 then x = 0 and when t = n12, then x = 3. Hence our in-
tegral becomes 
f
ft/2 
fft/2 
o J3 2 -
32 sin2 t 3 cos t dt = 
0 9 cos t cos t dt 
f
ft/2 
= 9 
0 cos2 t dt 
9n 
4 
Note that on the stated interval 0 ~ t ~ n12, the cosine cos t is positive, 
and so 
Jl - sin2 t = Jcos 2 t = cos t. 
If we picked an interval where the cosine is negative, then when taking 
the square root, we would need to use an extra minus sign. That is, if 
cos t < 0, then 
Jcos 2 t = -cos t. 
Since the integral above represented 1/4-th of the area of the circle, it 
follows that the total area of the circle is 9n. 
In general, an integral involving expressions like 
can sometimes be evaluated by using the substitution 
x = sin B, 
dx = cos B dB, 
because the expression under the square root then becomes a perfect 
square, namely 1 - sin 2 B = cos2 B. 
In making this substitution, we usually let 
- nl2 ~ B ~ nl2 
and 
-1~x~1. 

[XI, §3]

This is the range where 
x = sin e has the inverse function e = arcsin x. 
Negative powers of sine and cosine 
It is usually a pain to integrate negative powers of sine and cosine, 
although it can be done. You should be aware that the following for-
mula exists. 
f 
co~ e de = f 
sec e de = log(sec e + tan e). 
This is done by substitution. We have 
_ 1_ = sec e = (sec e)( sec e + tan e) . 
cos e 
sec 8 + tan 8 
Let u = sec e + tan 8. Then the integral is in the form 
(This is a good opportunity to emphasize that the formula we just ob-
tained is valid on any interval such that cos e "# 0 and 
sec 8 + tan 8 > O. 
Otherwise the symbols are meaningless. Determine such an interval as 
an exercise.) The expression in the above formula is sufficiently compli-
cated that you should not memorize it. Plug into it when needed. There 
is a similar formula for the integral of l/sin 8, which is obtained by 
using the prefix co- on the right-hand side. The formula is: 
I = f 
Si~ e de = f 
csc e de = -log( csc e + cot e), 
which is similar to the answer given previously for J (l/cos e) de. Of 
course, the answer is over an interval where the expression inside the 
logarithm is positive. Otherwise, one has to take the absolute value of 
this expression. The proof is similar, and you can also check it by differ-
entiating the right-hand side to get l/sin 8.

[XI, §3] 
Warning. On the left-hand side we have sine instead of cosine, so the 
prefix co- is deleted. On the right-hand side, we have cosecant and co-
tangent, so the prefix co- is added. You should remember that there is 
such a symmetry, but always check exactly what the correct relation is 
before using it, because in using this symmetry, certain minus signs ap-
pear just as a minus sign now appeared on the right-hand side. Do not 
attempt to memorize when such minus signs occur. Check each time 
that you need a similar formula, or look it up in integral tables.

We want to study the integrals of quotients of polynomials. 
357 
Let f(x) and g(x) be two polynomials. We want to investigate the 
integral 
f f(X) dx. 
g(x) 
Using long division, one can reduce the problem to the case when the 
degree of f is less than the degree of g. The following example illustrates 
this reduction. 
Example. Consider the two polynomials f(x) = x 3 -
X + 1 and 
g(x) = x 2 + 1. 
Dividing f by g (you should know how from high school) we obtain a 
quotient of x with remainder - 2x + 1. Thus 
x 3 -
X + 1 = (x 2 + l)x + (-2x + 1).

Hence 
f(x)

g(x) 
x 2 + 1 
To find the integral of f(x)/g(x) we integrate x, and the quotient on the 
right, which has the property that the degree of the numerator is less 
than the degree of the denominator. 
From now on, we assume throughout that when we consider a quotient 
f(x}/g(x), the degree of f is less than the degree of g. We assume this 
because the method we shall describe works only in this case. Factoring 
out a constant if necessary, we also assume that g(x) can be written 
g(x) = xd + lower terms. 
We shall begin by discussing special cases, and then describe afterwards 
how the general case can be reduced to these. 
First part. Linear factors in the denominator 
Case 1. If a is a number, and n an integer ~ 1, then 
f 1 
dx=-------
(x-a)n 
-n+ l(x-a)"-1

if n =1= 1, 
if n = 1. 
This is an old story. We know how to do it. In fact, we have 
f

dx = f(X - a)-n dx = fu- n duo 
(x -

Suppose n ¢ 1. Then by substitution u = x - a, du = dx, we get 
because

Case 2. Next we consider integrals of expressions like 
f

d 
(x -

or f

d 
(x - 1)2(x _ 2) x, 
where the denominator consists of a product of terms of the form 
359 
for some numbers, al , ... ,an which need not be distinct. The procedure 
amounts to writing the expression under the integral as a sum of terms, 
as in Case 1. 
Example. We wish to find the integral 
f---1--- dX. 
(x - 2)(x - 3) 
To do this, we want to write 
1 
C1 
c2

(x - 2)(x - 3) 
x - 2 
x - 3 
with some numbers C1 and C2 , for which we have to solve. Put the 
expression on the right over a common denominator. We find 
C1 
C2 
cl(x-3)+cix-2)

- + -
- =

x - 2 
x - 3 
(x - 2)(x - 3) 
Thus (x - 2)(x - 3) is the common denominator, and 
We want the fraction to be equal to I/(x - 2)(x - 3). Thus the numera-
tor must be equal to I, that is we must have 

360 
TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 
[XI, §4] 
Therefore it suffices to solve the simultaneous equations 
Solving for Cl and C2 gives C2 = 1 and Cl = -1. Hence 
f---1--- dx = f_-_l- dx + f __ l- dx 
(x - 2)(x - 3) 
(x - 2) 
(x - 3) 
= -Iog(x - 2) + log(x - 3).

Note that (x -

On the other hand, (x - 2) appears only in the first power In the 
original quotient, so it gives rise only to one term 
in the partial fraction decomposition. (The general rule is stated at the 
end of the section.) 
We now describe how to find the constants Cl , C2' C3' satisfying the

Thus to find the constants c I , C2 , C3 satisfying the desired relation, we 
have to solve the simultaneous equations 
CI

-3c I + C2 -
2c3 = 1, 
2c I -
2c2 + C3 = 1. 
This is a system of three linear equations in three unknowns, which you 
can solve to determine C I, C2 , and C3 • One finds CI = -3, C2 = -2, 
C3 = 3. Hence

It is a theorem in algebra that if you follow the above procedure to 
write a fraction in terms of simpler fractions according to the method 
illustrated in the examples, you will always be able to solve for the 
coefficients C I , C2 , C3 , •••. The proof cannot be given at the level of this 
course, but in practice, unless you or I make a mistake, we just solve 
numerically in each case. If we have higher powers of some factor in the 
denominator, then we have to use higher powers also in the simpler 
fractions on the right-hand side.

Case 3. We want to find the integral 
when n is a positive integer. If n = 1, there is nothing new, the integral

slight twist on the usual procedure, because if we integrate In by parts in 
the natural way, we find that the exponent n increases by one unit. Let 
us do the case n = 1 as an example, so we start with

course you should not memorize the above formula; you should only 
remember the method by which it is obtained to apply it to special

Sometimes we meet an integral which is a slight variation of the one just 
considered, with an extra constant. For instance, if b is a number, find

because the two integrals differ only by a change of letters. This shows 
how to use a substitution to reduce the computation of the integral with 
b to the integral when b = 1 treated above.

complete the square. The polynomial can thus be written in the form

Case 1.

X - 6 = (x + 2)(x - 3). 
Case 2. 
In Case 1, we have factored the polynomial into two factors, and each 
factor has degree 1. 
In Case 2, we have not factored the polynomial. By a change of 
variables, we can turn it into an expression t 2 + 1. Namely, let 
x-I = 2t 
so 
x = 2t + 1. 
Then

We made the change of variables so that 22 would come out as a factor. 
We note that in Case 2, we cannot factor the polynomial any further. 
The following general result can be proved, but the proof is long, and 
cannot be given in this course.

The general rule is as follows: Suppose we have a quotient 
f(x)/g(x) with degree of f < degree of g. We factor g as far as 
possible into terms like

g( x) = sum of terms of the followmg type: 
Once the quotient f(x)/g(x) is written as above, then Cases 1, 2, and 3 
allow us to integrate each term. We then find that the integral involves 
functions of the following type:

This section has several purposes. 
First, we expand our techniques of integration, by using the exponen-
tial function. 
Second, this gives practice in the exponential function and the loga-
rithm in a new context, which will make you learn these functions better 
for having used them.

TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 
[XI, §5] 
Third, we shall introduce two new functions 
2 
and 
2 
In the next chapter you will see these functions applied to some physical 
situations, to describe the equation of a hanging cable, or a soap film 
between two rings. Such functions will also be used to find the integrals 
which give the length of various curves. Here we just use them system-
atically to find integrals. 
We start by showing how to make a simple substitution. 
Example. Let us find 
1= f~dX. 
We put u = eX, du = eX dx so that dx = du/u. Then 
Now put 1 - u = v2 and -du = 2v dv to get rid of the square root sign. 
Then u = 1 - v2 and we obtain 
f v 
f v2 
1= I_v 2 (-2v)dv=2 v2_1dv

This last integral can be integrated by partial fractions, to give the final 
answer. 
We have learned how to integrate expressions involving 
~. 

[XI, §5] 
EXPONENTIAL SUBSTITUTIONS 
373 
We substitute x = sin e to make the expression under the square root 
sign into a perfect square. But what if we have to deal with an integral 
like 
f ji+7dx? 
We need to make a substitution which makes the expression under the 
square root sign into a perfect square. There are two possible types of 
functions which we can use. First, let us try to substitute x = tan e to 
get rid of the square root. We find 
1 
J 1 + tan 2 e = sec e = --
cos e 
over an interval where cos e is positive. Already a negative power of 
cosine is not so nice. Even worse, 
dx = sec2 e de, 
so 
f ji+7 dx = f 
sec3 e de = f 
co:3 e de, 
which can be done, but not pleasantly, so we don't do it. 
Here we give a better way of getting rid of the horrible square root 
sign. We need a better pair of functions fl(t) and fit) such that 
Such functions are easily found by using the exponential function e'. 
Namely, we let 
and 
If you multiply out, you will find immediately that these functions satisfy 
the desired relation. These functions have a name: they are called the 
hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine, and are denoted by sinh and cosh. 
(sinh is pronounced cinch, while cosh is pronounced cosh.) Thus we 
define 
el - e- I 
sinh t = 
2 
and 
el + e- I 
cosh t = 
2 

374 
TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 
[XI, §5] 
Carry out the manipulation which shows that 
cosh 2 t - sinh 2 t = 1. 
Furthermore, the standard rules for differentiation show that 
d cosh t 
. 
dt 
= smh t 
and 
d sinh t 
h 
- d-t- = cos t. 
These formulas are very similar to those for the ordinary sine and cosine, 
except for some reversals of sign. They allow us to treat some cases of 
integrals which could not be done before, and in particular get rid of 
square root signs as follows. 
Example. Find 
1= f~dX. 
We make the substitution 
x = sinh t 
and 
dx = cosh t dt. 
Then 1 + sinh 2 t = cosh2 t, so that ~ 
= Jcosh 2 t = cosh t. Hence 
I = f 
cosh t cosh t dt 
_ fet + e-t et + e-t 
-

dt 
The answer is, of course, given in terms of t. If we want it in terms of 
x, then we need to study the inverse junction, which we may call 
arcsinh (hyperbolic arcsine), and we may write 
t = arcsinh x. 

[XI, §5] 
EXPONENTIAL SUBSTITUTIONS 
375 
At first it seems that we are in a situation similar to that of sine and 
cosine, when we could not give explicitly a formula for the inverse func-
tion. We just called those inverse functions arcsine and arccosine. It is 
remarkable that here, we can give a formula as follows. 
I If x = sinh t 
then 
t = log(x + p+!). 
Proof We have 
Let u = et . Then 
We multiply this equation by 2u and get the equation 
u2 - 2ux - 1 = o. 
We can then solve for u in terms of x by the quadratic formula, and get 
2x ± J4x 2 + 4 
u= ----'-------
2 
so 
u=x±p+!. 
But u = et > 0 for all t. Since p+! > x, it follows that we cannot 
have the minus sign in this relation. Hence finally 
et = u = x + p+!. 
Now we take the log to find 
t = log(x + p+!). 
This proves the desired formula. 
Thus unlike the case of sine and cosine, we get here an explicit 
formula for the inverse function of the hyperbolic sine. 

376 
TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 
[XI, §5] 
If we now substitute t = log(x + #+1) in the indefinite integral 
found above, we get the explicit answer: 
f JI+7 dx = ~ [~(x + #+1)2 + 210g(x + #+1) 
- ~(x + #+1)-21 
We may also want to find a definite integral. 
Example. Let B > O. Find 
We substitute B in the indefinite integral, we substitute 0, and sub-

- t(B + JB2+l)-2] 
because when we substitute 0 for t in the expression in brackets we 
find o. 
In cases when you have to use an inverse function for cosh, you can 
rely on the following assertion. 
For t ~ 0, the function x = cosh t has an inverse function, which is 
given by 
t = log(x + Jx2=1). 
This is proved just like the similar statement for sinh. Do Exercises 5 
and 6, which are actually worked out in the answer section. But do 
them before looking up the answer section, you will learn the subject 
better for doing so.

formula for the arcsine and arccosine.

CHAPTER 
XII 
Appl ications of I nteg ration 
Mathematics consists in discovering and describing certain objects and 
structures. It is essentially impossible to give an all-encompassing de-
scription of these. Hence, instead of such a definition, we simply state 
that the objects of study of mathematics as we know it are those which 
you will find described in the mathematical journals of the past two 
centuries, and leave it at that. There are many reasons for studying these 
objects, among which are aesthetic reasons (some people like them), and 
practical reasons (some mathematics can be applied). 
Physics, on the other hand, consists in describing the empirical world 
by means of mathematical structures. The empirical world is the world 
with which we come into contact through our senses, through experi-
ments, measurements, etc. What makes a good physicist is the ability to 
choose, among many mathematical structures and objects, the ones 
which can be used to describe the empirical world. I should of course 
immediately qualify the above assertion in two ways: First, the descrip-
tion of physical situations by mathematical structures can only be done 
within the degree of accuracy provided by the experimental apparatus. 
Second, the description should satisfy certain aesthetic criteria (simplicity, 
elegance). After all, a complete listing of all results of all experiments 
performed is a description of the physical world, but is quite a distinct 
thing from giving at one single stroke a general principle which will 
account simultaneously for the results of all these experiments. 
For psychological reasons, it is impossible (for most people) to learn 
certain mathematical theories without seeing first a geometric or physical 
interpretation. Hence in this book, before introducing a mathematical 
notion, we frequently introduce one of its geometric or physical interpre-
tations. These two, however, should not be confused. Thus we might 
make two columns, as shown on the following page. 

380 
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION 
[XII] 
As far as the logical development of our course is concerned, we could 
omit the second column entirely. The second column is used, however, 
for many purposes: To motivate the first column (because our brain is 
made up in such a way that to understand something in the first col-
umn, it needs the second). To provide applications for the first column, 
other than pure aesthetic satisfaction (granting that you like the subject).

and the integral, as a unique number between upper and lower sums, are 
not to be confused with a slope or an area, respectively. It is simply our 
mind which interprets the mathematical notion in physical or geometric 
terms. Besides, we frequently assign several such interpretations to the 
same mathematical notion (viz. the integral being interpreted as an area, 
or as the work done by a force). 
And by the way, the above remarks which are about physics and 
mathematics belong neither to physics nor to mathematics. They belong 
to philosophy. 
Experience shows that for a course which deals with integration and 
Taylor's formula in one term, time is lacking to cover al/ the applications 
of integration given in the book, as well as to cover the computations 
associated with Taylor's formula and an estimate of its remainder. The 
basic applications like length of curve, volume of revolution, area in 
polar coordinates cannot be omitted. One then has to make a choice 
about the others, which deal with geometric concepts (area of revolution) 
or physical concepts (work). As stated already in the foreword, my feel-
ing is that except for doing the section on work, if time is lacking, it is 

[XII, §1] 
VOLUMES OF REVOLUTION 
381 
best to omit other applications in order to have plenty of time to handle 
the computations resulting from Taylor's formula. 
XII, §1. VOLUMES OF REVOLUTION 
We start our applications with volumes of revolutions. The main reason 
is that the integrals to be evaluated come out easier than in other appli-
cations. But ultimately, we derive systematically the lengths, areas, and 
volumes of all the standard geometric figures. 
Let y =I(x) be a continuous function of x on some interval a ~ x ~ b. 
Assume that f(x) ~ 0 in this interval. If we revolve the curve y = f(x) 
around the x-axis, we obtain a solid, whose volume we wish to compute.

Let Cj be a minimum of f in the interval [Xj, X j + 1] and let aj be a 
maximum of f in that interval. Then the solid of revolution in that small 
interval lies between a small cylinder and a big cylinder. The width of 
these cylinders is xj + 1 -
Xj and the radius is f(c) for the small cylinder 
and f(d) for the big one. Hence the volume of revolution, denoted by V, 
satisfies the inequalities 
n-l 
n-I 
L rrf(cY(x j + 1 - xJ ~ V~ L rrf(dJ2(x j + 1 - xJ 
It is therefore reasonable to define this volume to be 
Example. Compute the volume of the sphere of radius 1.

We take the function y = ~ 
between 0 and 1. If we rotate this 
curve around the x-axis, we shall get half the sphere. Its volume is 
therefore 
The volume of the full sphere is therefore 11t. 
Example. Find the volume obtained by rotating the region between 
y = x3 and y = x in the first quadrant around the x-axis. 
The graph of the region is illustrated on the figure. We take only that 
part in the first quadrant, so 0 ;£ x ~ 1. The required volume V is equal 
to the difference of the volumes obtained by rotating y = x and y = x 3.

However, if you compute the volume of the curve

y = XI /4 
between a and 1, you will find that it approaches a limit, as a -> O. Do 
Exercise 12. 
In the above computation, we determined the volume of a chimney 
near the y-axis. We can also find the volume of the chimney going off to 
the right, say between 1 and a number B > 1. Suppose the chimney is 
defined by y = I/Jx. The volume of revolution between 1 and B is

As B -+ 00, we see that this volume becomes arbitrarily large. However, 
using another function, as for instance in Exercise 13, you will find a 
finite volume for the infinite chimney!

XII, §2. AREA IN POLAR COORDINATES 
Suppose we are given a continuous function 
r = f«() 
which is defined in some interval a ~ () ~ b. We assume that f«() ~ 0 
and b ~ a + 2n. 
We wish to find an integral expression for the area encompassed by 
the curve r = f«() between the two bounds a and b. 
Let us take a partition of [a, b], say 
The picture between ()j and ()j+ 1 might look like this: 
We let Sj be a number between ()j and ()i+ 1 such that f(s;) is a maxi-
mum in that interval, and we let tj be a number such that f(t;) is a 
minimum in that interval. In the figure, we have drawn the circles (or 
rather the sectors) of radius f(sj) and J(t j), respectively. Let 
Aj = area between 
() = ()j' 
() = ()j+ l' and bounded by the curve 
= area of the set of points (r, () in polar coordinates such that 
and 
o ~ r ~f«(). 
The area of a sector having angle ()j+ 1 -
()j and radius R is equal to the 
fraction 
of the total area of the circle of radius R, namely nR2. Hence we get the 
inequality

XII, §3. LENGTH OF CURVES 
Let y = f(x) be a differentiable function over some interval [a, b] (with 
a < b) and assume that its derivative f' is continuous. We wish to deter-
mine the length of the curve described by the graph. The main idea is to 
approximate the curve by small line segments and add these up.

Consequently, we consider a partition of our interval: 
For each Xi we have the point (Xi' f(xJ) on the curve y = f(x). We 
draw the line segments between two successive points. The length of 
such a segment is the length of the line between 
and 
and is equal to 
By the mean value theorem, we conclude that 
f(x i + l ) - f(xJ = (Xi + 1 - xJf'(cJ 
for some number Ci between Xi and Xi + 1. Using this, we see that the 
length of our line segment is 
We can factor out (x i + 1 -
Xi)2 and we see that the sum of the length of 
these line segments is 
n-I

Let G(x) = Jl + f'(X)2. Then G(x) is continuous, and we see that the

APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION 
[XII, §3] 
The value G(cj ) satisfies the inequalities 
that is G(cJ lies between the minimum and the maximum of G on the 
interval [Xj, Xj+ 1]. Thus the sum we have written down lies between a 
lower sum and an upper sum for the function G. We called such sums 
Riemann sums. This is true for every partition of the interval. We know 
from the basic theory of integration that there is exactly one number 
lying between every upper sum and every lower sum, and that number is 
the definite integral. Therefore it is very reasonable to define: 
length of our curve between a and b 
Example. We wish to set up the integral for the length of the curve 
y = X2 between x = 0 and x = 1. From the definition above, we see that 
the integral is 
This integral is of the same type as that considered in Chapter XI, §5. 
First let 
u = 2x, 
du = 2 dx. 
When x = 0, then u = 0, and when x = 1, then u = 2. Hence 
The answer then comes from Chapter XI, §5. 
Example. We want the length of the curve y = eX between x = 1 and 
x = 2. We have dy/dx = eX and (dy/dx)2 = e2x so by the general formula, 
the length is given by the integral

We want to show here how one can determine the equation of a hanging 
cable as shown on the figure.

Tsin 8

We suppose that the cable is fixed on the left to a wall, and is sub-
jected to a tension T in a certain direction at the other end. The cable is 
fixed to the wall at point A, submitted to a horizontal tension which is 
constant, and denoted by H. We want to find explicitly the height of the 
cable 
y = f(x). 
The answer is as follows. 
If a is the height on the left, the units of measurement are such that 
a = H/w, and the cable has horizontal slope where it touches the wall. 
then 
y = a cosh(x/a). 
We shall show this by first deriving the differential equation satisfied 
by the cable. Thus we first show that 
Let the weight be w per unit length, and let the length be s. Then the 
weight W of cable of length s is ws. 
The tension at P has to balance the horizontal tension H, and the 
weight W which pulls down. This tension has a horizontal component 
and a vertical component, which are given by T cos f) and T sin f), re-
spectively. Thus we must have 
Tcos f) = H, 
Tsin f) = W= ws.

On the other hand, we know that 
Therefore 
This is the differential equation which we wanted. 
You may have done an exercise in Chapter XI, §5 showing that the 
function 
y = a cosh(x/a) 
satisfies the equation 
We now prove the converse. 
Theorem 3.1. If y = f(x) satisfies (*), and also 
f(O) = a, 
1'(0) = 0, 
then y = a cosh(x/a). 
The condition f(O) = a means that the cable is hooked on the left at 
height a above the x-axis. The condition 1'(0) = 0 means that at this 
point, the cable is horizontal. 
Let 
dy 
dx = u.

u = sinh t,

But u = dy/dx = f'(x), and f'(0) = 0 by assumption. Hence 
sinh C = 0, 
which means that C = O. Therefore 
dy = f'(x) = sinh(~) .

a = 1(0) = a· 1 + K. 
Hence K = 0, and thus finally 
y = I(x) = a cosh(x/a) 
as desired.

XII, §4. PARAMETRIC CURVES 
397 
There is one other way in which we can describe a curve. Suppose that 
we look at a point which moves in the plane. Its coordinates can be 
given as a function of time t. Thus, when we give two functions of t, say 
x = I(t), 
y = g(t), 
we may view these as describing a point moving along a curve. The 
functions 1 and g give the coordinates of the point as functions of t. 
Example 1. Let x = cos e and y = sin e. Then 
(x, y) = (cos e, sin e) 
is a point on the circle. 

398 
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION 
[XII, §4] 
As () increases, we view the point as moving along the circle, in counter-
clockwise direction. The choice of letter () really does not matter, and we 
could use t instead. In practice, the angle () is itself expressed as a 
function of time. For example, if a bug moves around the circle with 
uniform (constant) angular speed, then we can write 
() = wt, 
where w is constant. Then 
x = cos(wt) 
and 
y = sin(wt). 
This describes the motion of a bug around the circle with angular speed 
w. 
When (x, y) is described by two functions of t as above, we say that 
we have a parametrization of the curve in terms of the parameter t. 
Example 2. Sketch the curve x = t 2, Y = t 3 . 
We can make a table of values as usual.

Thus for each number t, we can plot the corresponding point (x, y). We 
also investigate when x and yare increasing or decreasing functions of t. 
For instance, taking the derivative, we get 
dx 
-
= 2t 
dt

and 

[XII, §4] 
PARAMETRIC CURVES

Thus x increases when t > 0 and decreases when t < O. The y-coordinate 
is increasing since t2 > 0 (unless t = 0). Furthermore, the x-coordinate is 
always positive (unless t = 0). Thus the graph looks like this: 
y-axis 
X=t2 
y=t3 
The parametric expression for the x- and y-coordinates is often useful 
to describe a motion of a bug (or a particle), whose coordinates are 
given as a function of time t. The arrows drawn in the figure suggest 
such a motion. 
We can sometimes transform a curve given parametrically into a curve 
defined by an equation, possibly with some additional inequalities. 
Example 3. The points (t2, t3) satisfy an "ordinary" equation 
or 
However, we might also have written down the equation 
which is satisfied by all points on our curve. In this case, however, there 
are solutions of this equation which are not given by our parametriza-
tion, corresponding to negative values of x, for instance, 
x = -2, 
y = ±2J2. 
Thus if we want to describe the set of all points on the parametrized 
curve by this latter relation, we must add an inequality x ~ O. It is then 
correct to say that the set of all points on the parametrized curve is the 
set of all solutions of the equation 
satisfying the inequality x ~ O. 

400 
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION 
[XII, §4] 
Similarly, it is also correct to say that the set of all points on the 
parametrized curve is the set of all solutions of the equation 
satisfying the inequality x ~ O. And so on. 
The graph of the equation y4 = x6 is as shown on the figure.

It is symmetric about both the x-axis and the y-axis. However, m the 
parametrized curve, 
only the right-hand portion of this graph occurs.

Either you have already verified that 
X(t)2 - y(t)2 = 1, 
or you should do so now by a straightforward multiplication and sub-
traction. Then you see that the point 
lies on the hyperbola defined by the equation 

[XII, §4] 
PARAMETRIC CURVES 
401 
But note that x(t) > 0, in other words the x-coordinate given by the 
above function of t is always positive. Thus our functions 
describe a point on the -right-hand branch of the hyperbola.

When t is large negative, then x(t) is large pOSItive, and y(t) is large 
negative. When t is large positive, then x(t) is large positive, and y(t) is 
large positive. 
As t increases the y-coordinate y(t) increases from large negative to 
large positive. Thus a bug moving along the hyperbola according to the 
above parametrization is moving up, on the right-hand part of the 
hyperbola. 
Length of parametrized curves 
We shall now determine the length of a curve given by a parametriza-
tion. 
Suppose that our curve is given by 
x = !(t), 
y = g(t), 
with a ~ t ~ b, and assume that both f, g have continuous derivatives. 
We consider a partition of the t-interval [a, b]: 
We then obtain points

The sum of the lengths of the line segments gives an approximation of 
the length of the curve when the partition is sufficiently fine, that is when 
the numbers t j, tj + 1 are close together. Thus the sum 
n-1 L JU(t j + 1) - f(tJ)2 + (g(t j + 1) - g(tj»2 
j=O 
gives an approximation to the length of the curve. We use the mean 
value theorem for f and g. There are numbers Cj and dj between tj and 
tj + 1 such that 
Substituting these values and factoring out (t j + 1 -
t;), we see that the 
slim of the lengths of our line segments is equal to 
n - 1 
L J f'(cY + g'(dJ2(tj+ 1 - tJ

G(t) = J f'(t)2 + g'(t)2. 
Then our sum is almost equal to

L G(cJ(t j + 1 -

j=O 
which would be a Riemann sum for G. It is not, because it is not 
necessarily true that Cj = dj • Nevertheless, what we have done makes it 

[XII, §4]

403 
very reasonable to define the length of our curve (in parametric form) to 
be 
t: = f J f'(t)2 + g'(t)2 dt. 
A complete justification that this integral is a limit, in a suitable sense, of 
our sums would require some additional theory, which is irrelevant any-
way since we just want to make it reasonable that the above integral 
should represent what we mean physically by length. 
Observe that when a curve is given in usual form y = f(x) we can let 
t = x = g(t) 
and 
y = f(t). 
This shows how to view the usual form as a special case of the paramet-
ric form. In that case, g'(t) = 1 and the formula for the length in para-
metric form is seen to be the same as the formula we obtained before for 
a curve y = f(x). 
It is also convenient to put the formula in the other standard notation 
for the derivative. We have 
dx = f'(t)

x = r cos 0 = f(O) cos 0,

XII, §5. SURFACE OF REVOLUTION 
Let y = f(x) be a positive continuously differentiable function on an in-
terval [a, b]. We wish to find a formula for the area of the surface of 
revolution of the graph of f around the x-axis, as illustrated on the 
figure. 

[XII, §5]

We shall see that the surface area is given by the integral 
The idea again is to approximate the curve by line segments, as illus-
trated. We use a partition 
!(Xi+I) 
!(Xi) 
Li 
On the small interval [Xi' Xi + 1] the curve is approximated by the line 
segment joining the points (Xi' f(x;) and (Xi+ l' f(Xi+ 1»' Let Li be the 
length of the segment. Then 
The length of a circle of radius y is 2n:y. If we rotate the line segment 
about the x-axis, then the area of the surface of rotation will be between 
and 
where f(t;) and f(s;) are the minimum and maximum of f, respectively, 
on the interval [Xi' Xi + 1]. This is illustrated on Fig. 1.

On the other hand, by the mean value theorem, we can write 
for some number Ci between Xi and xi + l' Hence 
Therefore the expression 
is an approximation of the surface of revolution of the curve over the 
small interval [Xi' Xi + 1]. Now take the sum: 
"-1 L 2nj(cJJl + f'(Ci)2(Xi + 1 - xJ

This is a Riemann sum, between the upper and lower sums for the 
integral 
s = f 2nj(x)Jl + f'(X)2 dx. 
Thus it is reasonable that the surface area should be defined by this 
integral, as was to be shown.

Physical example. It occurs frequently in practice that one wants to 
determine a minimal surface of revolution, obtained by rotating a curve 
between two given points PI = (Xl' Yl) and P2 = (X2' Y2) in the plane. 
This is sometimes called the soap film problem. Indeed, given two rings 
perpendicular to the x-axis, the problem is to find a soap-film stretching 
across these two rings. 
The soap film will realize the minimal surface of revolution. What is the 
equation for the curve Y = !(x)? It turns out to be similar to that of the 
hanging cable, namely 
x-a 
Y = bcosh -
-b ' 
where a, b are constants depending on the two points (Xl' Yl) and 
(X2 ' Y2). Here again we see a use of the cosh function. 
Area of revolution for parametric curves 
As with length, we can also deal with curves given in parametric form. 
Suppose that 
X = !(t), 
Y = g(t), 
a ~ t ~ b. 
We take a partition

Then the length L j between U(t j ), g(t;) and (f(tj + 1)' g(ti+ 1» is given by 
Lj = JU(t j+ 1) - l(t;)2 + (g(tj+ 1) - g(t;)2

where Cj , dj are numbers between tj and t j + 1• Hence

Example. We wish to find the area of a sphere of radius a > O. It is 
best to view the sphere as the area of revolution of a circle of radius a, 
and to express the circle in parametric form, 
x = a cos e, 
y = a sin e, 
o ~ e ~ n. 
Then the formula yields: 
S = t"2na sin eJ a2 sin2 e + a2 cos2 e de 
= f: 2na2 sin e de 
= 2na2( -cos e)l: 
Let us now look at surfaces of revolution in terms of limits. Let 
y = f(x) be a positive function as above, defined for all positive numbers 
x. Let: 
VB = volume of revolution of the graph of f between x = I and x = B; 
S B = area of revolution of the graph of f between x = 1 and x = B. 
It is a fact which is usually very surprising that there may be cases when 
VB approaches a finite limit when B --+ co whereas S B become arbitrarily 
large when B --+ co !! 
Example. Let f(x) = llx.

In terms of a naive interpretation, suppose you have a bucket of paint 
containing n cubic units of paint. Then you can fill out the funnel inside 
the surface of revolution with this paint. But seemingly paradoxically, 
there isn't enough paint to paint the surface of revolution, as B --. 00. 
This shows how treacherous naive intuition can be.

XII, §6. WORK 
Suppose a particle moves on a curve, and that the length of the curve is 
described by a variable u. 
Let J(u) be a function. We interpret J as a force acting on the parti-
cle, in the direction of the curve. We want to find an integral expression 
for the work done by the force between two points on the curve. 
Whatever our expression will turn out to be, it is reasonable that the 
work done should satisfy the following properties: 
If a, b, c are three numbers, with a ~ b ~ c, then the work done 
between a and c is equal to the work done between a and b, plus the 
work done between band c. If we denote the work done between a and 
b by W:U), then we should have 
W~U) = W:(f) + W~(f) . 
Furthermore, if we have a constant force M acting on the particle, it 
is reasonable to expect that the work done between a and b is 
M(b - a). 
Finally, if 9 is a stronger force than J, say J(u) ~ g(u), on the interval 
[a, b], then we shall do more work with 9 than with J, meaning 

416 
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION 
[XII, §6] 
In particular, if there are two constant forces m and M such that 
m ~f(u) ~ M 
throughout the interval [a, b], then 
m(b - a) ~ W:U) ~ M(b - a). 
We shall see below that the work done by the force.f between a distance 
a and a distance b is given by the integral 
W~U) = f f(u) duo 
If the particle or object happens to move along a straight line, say 
along the x-axis, then f is given as a function of x, and our integral is 
simply 
ff(X)dX. 
Furthermore, if the length of the curve U is given as a function of time 
t (as it is in practice, cf. §3) we see that the force becomes a function of t 
by the chain rule, namely f(u(t) . Thus between time tl and t2 the work 
done is equal to 
i
l2 
du 
f{u(t) -d dt.

This is the most practical expression for the work, since curves and 
forces are most frequently expressed as functions of time. 
Let us now see why the work done is given by the integral. Let P be 
a partition of the interval [a, b]: 
Let f(t;) be a minimum for f on the small interval [uj, uj+ 1]' and let f(s;) 
be a maximum for f on this same small interval. Then the work done by 
moving the particle from length U j to Ui+ 1 satisfies the inequalities

The expressions on the left and right are lower and upper sums for the 
integral, respectively. Since the integral is the unique number between 
the lower sums and upper sums, it follows that 
W~(f) = f f(u) duo 
Example. Find the work done in stretching a spring from its un-
stretched position to a length of 10 cm longer. You may assume that the 
force needed to stretch the spring is proportional to the increase in 
length. 
We visualize the spring as being horizontal, on the x-axis. Thus there 
is a constant K such that the force is given by 
f(x) = Kx. 
The work done is therefore

By assumption, there is a constant C such that the force of gravity is 
given by f(x) = c/(x + 4000)2, where x denotes the height above the 
earth. When x = 0, our assumption is that

Suppose we have masses ml , ... ,mn at points XI"" ,Xn on the x-axis. The 
total moment of these masses is defined to be

We wish to find the point of the rod such that if we balance the rod at 
that point, then the rod will not move either up or down. Call this 
point x. 
Then x is a point such that if the total mass m is placed at x it will have 
the same balancing effect as the other masses mi at Xi' The equation for 
this condition is that 
n 
mx = mix! + '" + mnXn = L mixi·

420 
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION 
[XII, §7] 
Thus we can solve for x and get 
This point x is called the center of gravity, or center of mass of the 
masses m I' ... ,m •. 
Example. Let ml = 4 be at the point XI = -3 and let m2 = 7 be at 
the point X2 = 2. Then the total mass is 
m=4+7=11 
and the moment is 
4· ( - 3) + 7·2 = 2. 
Hence the center of gravity is at the point 
x = 2/11. 
Now suppose that we have a thin rod, placed along the x-axis on an 
interval [a, b], as on the figure. Suppose that the rod has constant 
(uniform) density K.

The length of the rod is (b -

density times the length, namely 
mass = K(b - a). 
It is reasonable to define the moment of the rod to be the same as that 
of the total mass placed at the center of the rod. This center has coor-
dinates at the midpoint of the interval, namely 
Hence the moment of the rod is

[XII, §7] 
MOMENTS AND CENTER OF GRAVITY 
421 
Next suppose the density of the rod is not constant, but varies contin-
uously, and so can be represented by a function f(x}. We try to find an 
approximation of what we mean by the moment of the rod. Thus we 
take a partition of the interval [a, b], 
On each small interval [Xi' Xi + I] the density will not vary much, and an 
approximation for the moment of the piece of rod along this interval is 
then given by 
where 
Xi + 1 + Xi 
Ci =

is the midpoint of the small interval. Let 
G(x) = xf(x). 
Taking the sum of the above approximations yields 
n-I 
L f(C;)Ci(Xi+ 1 -
Xi) 
i=O 
which is a Riemann sum for the integral 
fG(X)dX = fXf(X)dX. 
Consequently it is natural to define the moment of the rod with variable 
density as the integral 
M~(f) = f xf(x) dx. 
Let x be the coordinate of the center of gravity of the rod. This 
means that if the mass of the rod is placed at x then it has the same 
moment as the rod itself, and amounts to the equation 
x . total mass of rod = L
b xf (x) dx.

Hence we get an expression for the center of gravity, namely

Part Four 
Taylor's Formula 
and Series 
In this part we study the approximation of functions by certain sums, 
called series. The chapter on Taylor's formula shows how to approximate 
functions by polynomials, and we estimate the error term to see how 
good an approximation we can get. 
Note that the derivation of Taylor's formula is an application of 
integration by parts. 

CHAPTER 
XIII 
Taylor's Formula 
We finally corne to the point where we develop a method which allows 
us to compute the values of the elementary functions like sine, exp, and 
log. The method is to approximate these functions by polynomials, with 
an error term which is easily estimated. This error term will be given by 
an integral, and our first task is to estimate integrals. We then go 
through the elementary functions systematically, and derive the approxi-
mating polynomials. 
You should review the estimates of Chapter X, §3, which will be used 
to estimate our error terms. 
XIII, §1. TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
Let j be a function which is differentiable on some interval. We can 
then take its derivative f' on that interval. Suppose that this derivative 
is also differentiable. We need a notation for its derivative. We shall 
denote it by j(2). Similarly, if the derivative of the function J<2) exists, 
we denote it by j(3), and so forth. In this system, the first derivative is 
denoted by j(1). (Of course, we can also write j(2) = j".) 
In the d/dx notation, we also write: 
and so forth. 

428 
TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §1] 
Taylor's formula gives us a polynomial which approximates the func-
tion, in terms of the derivatives of the function. Since these derivatives 
are usually easy to compute, there is no difficulty in computing these 
polynomials. 
For instance, if f(x) = sin x, then P1)(x) = cos x, f(2)(X) = -sin x, 
f(3)(X) = - cos x, and f(4)(X) = sin x. From there on, we start all over 
again. 
In the case of eX, it is even easier, namely pn)(x) = eX for all positive 
integers n. 
It is also customary to denote the function f itself by PO). Thus 
f(x) = f(O)(x). 
We need one more piece of notation before stating Taylor's formula. 
When we take successive derivatives of functions, the following numbers 
occur frequently: 
1, 
2·1, 
3·2·1, 
4·3·2·1, 
5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1, 
etc. 
These numbers are denoted by 
1 ! 
Thus 
2! 
3! 
I! = 1, 
2! = 2, 
3! = 6, 
4! 
5! 
4! = 24, 
5! = 120, 
6! = 720. 
etc. 
When n is a positive integer, the symbol n! is read n factorial. Thus in 
general. 
n! = n(n -
l)(n - 2)···2·1 
is the product of the first n integers from 1 to n. 
It is also convenient to agree that o! = 1. This IS the convention 
which makes certain formulas easiest to write. 
Let us now look at the case of a polynomial 
The numbers Co, ... 'Cn are called the coefficients of the polynomial. We 
shall now see that these coefficients can be expressed in terms of the 
derivatives of P(x) at x = o. You should remember what you did in 
Chapter III, §7 when you computed higher derivatives. Let k be an 
integer ~ O. Then the k-th derivative of P(x) is given by 
p(k)(X) = ckk! + an expression containing x as a factor. 

[XIII, §1] 
TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
429 
The reason is: if we differentiate k times the terms 
then we get O. And if we differentiate k times a power xi with j > k then 
some posItIve power of x will be left. Then if we evaluate the k-th 
derivative at 0, we get 
because when we substitute 0 for x all the other terms give O. Therefore 
we find the desired expression of Ck in terms of the k-th derivative: 
Next, let f be a function which has derivatives up to order n on an 
interval. We are seeking a polynomial 
whose derivatives at 0 (up to order n) are the same as the derivatives of 
f at 0, in other words 
What must the coefficients Co, c1, ,,,,cn be to achieve this? The answer is 
immediate from our computation of the coefficients of a polynomial, 
namely we must have 
for each integer k = 0, 1, .. . ,n. Hence we have the desired expression for 
Ck , namely 
Definition. The Taylor polynomial of degree ~ n for the function f is 
the polynomial 

430 
TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §1] 
Example. Let f(x) = sin x. It is easy to work out the derivatives (see 
§3), and you will find that the Taylor polynomials have the form 
Only odd values of n occur, so we write 
n=2m+l 
with m ~ O. 
Example. Let f(x) = eX. Then j<k)(X) = eX for all positive integers k. 
Hence j<k)(O) = 1 for all k, and so the Taylor polynomial has the form

We now want to know how good an approximation the polynomial

where Rn + 1 is called the remainder. 
We shall have to estimate the remainder term Rn+l(x). We shall 
eventually prove that there is a number c between 0 and x such that

Thus the remainder term will look very much like the main terms, except 
that the coefficient 
j<n+ l)(C) 
(n + I)! 
is taken at some intermediate point c instead of being taken at O. 
Since it is easy to estimate the derivatives of the functions sin x, 
cos x, eX we shall be able to see that the Taylor polynomials give good 
approximations to the function. If you are willing to take for granted 
the expression

for some number c between 0 and x, then you can read immediately the 
later sections, §3, and so on, to get immediately into the applications to 
the elementary functions. 
Observe that it does not make any difference whether we write 
f(x) = Pn(x) + Rn+ I(X) 
or 
This amounts merely to a change of indices. We use whichever is more 
convenient. 
Of course, the above assertion does not state anything precise about 
the number c other than c lies between 0 and x. But the point of the 
formula, and its remainder term, is that we do not need to know any-
thing more precise in order to estimate the remainder term. The polyno-
mial preceding the remainder term gives a value at x. We want to know 
only how close this value is to f(x). For that purpose, we need only 
give a bound 
I j<n)(c) I 
-'-----,-
I x In ~ something or other, 
n. 
and so we need only give a bound for the n-th derivative lj<n)(c)l. To 
give such a bound can be done without knowing an exact value for the 
n-th derivative at the number c. You can see how this is done in §3 and 
the following sections, when we deal systematically with all the elemen-
tary functions. 
We shall now develop the Taylor formula theoretically, and prove that 
the remainder term has the stated form. It will also be convenient in-
stead of working with the numbers 0 and x to work with arbitrary 
numbers a and b. We also state Taylor's formula with a somewhat dif-
ferent form for the remainder term, but a form which will arise naturally 
in the proof. After that, we shall prove that the integral form is equal to 
the expression stated above. 
Theorem 1.1. Let f be a function defined on a closed interval between 
two numbers a and b. Assume that the function has n derivatives on this 
interval, and that all of them are continuous functions. Then

The remainder term looks slightly complicated. In Theorem 2.1 we 
shall prove that Rn can be expressed in a form very similar to the other 
terms, namely 
R = f(n)(c) (b _ a)n 
n 
n! 
for some number c between a and b. Taylor's formula with this form of 
the remainder is then very easy to memorize, 
The most important case of Theorem 1.1 occurs when a = O. In that 
case, the formula reads 
f '(O)

(n -

Furthermore, if x is any number between a and b, the same formula 
remains valid for this number x instead of b, simply by considering the 
interval between a and x instead of the interval between a and b. Thus 
if a = 0, then the formula reads 
f '(O) 
fin - 1)(0) 
f(x) = f(O) + -
x + ... + 
n - 1 + R ( )

and c is 
a number between 0 and x. 
Each derivative 
f(O), 
1'(0), ... ,f(n-l)(O) is a number, and we see that the terms preceding Rn 
make up a polynomial in x. This is the approximating polynomial. 
We shall now prove the theorem. The proof is an application of inte-
gration by parts. First to get the idea of the proof, we carry out two 
special cases. 

[XIII, §l] 
TA YLOR'S FORMULA 
433 
Special cases. We proceed stepwise. We know that a function is the 
integral of its derivative. Thus when n = 1 we have 
J(b) - J(a) = f 
f'(t) dt. 
Let u = f'(t) and dv = dt. Then du = !"(t) dt. We are tempted to put 
v = t. This is one case where we choose another indefinite integral, 
namely v = -(b - t), which differs from t by a constant. We still have 
dv = dt (the minus signs cancel!). Integrating by parts, we get 
f u dv = u{ - f v du 
= - f'(t)(b - t)[ - f -(b - t)J<2l(t) dt 
= f'(a)(b - a) + f (b - t)J<2l(t) dt. 
This is precisely the Taylor formula when n = 2. 
We push it one step further, from 2 to 3. We rewrite the integral just 
obtained as 
f J<2l(t)(b - t) dt. 
Let u = J<2l(t) and dv = (b - t) dt. Then 
du = J(3l(t) dt 
and 
-(b - t)2 f 
v = 
2 
= 
(b - t) dt. 
Thus, integrating by parts, we find that our integral, which is of the form 
S: u dv, is equal to 
UVlb _ fb V du = _ J<2l(t) (b - t)2lb _ fb _ (b - t)2 J<3l(t) dt

Here, R3 is the desired remainder, and the term preceding it is just the 
proper term in the Taylor formula. 
If you need it, do the next step yourself, from 3 to 4. We shall now 
see how the general step goes, from n to n + 1. 

434 
TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §1] 
General case. Suppose that we have already obtained the first n - 1 
terms of the Taylor formula, with a remainder term 
R =

dv = (n _ I)! dt. 
Then 
du = f(n + 1)(t) dt 
and 
-(b - tt 
V= 
n! 
Here we use the fact that b is constant, and 
Note the appearance of a minus sign, from the chain rule. Also we use 
n(n -
I)! = n! 
to give the stated value of v. Thus the denominator climbs from (n - I)! 
to n!. 
Integrating by parts, we find : 
Rn = UVlb _ fb V du = _ j<n)(t) (b -, tt Ib _ fb _ (b -, tt fIn + 1)(t) dt

Thus we have split off one more term of the Taylor formula, and the 
new remainder is the desired Rn + 1. This concludes the proof.

Let us prove the first assertion. Since f(" is continuous on the inter-
val, there exists a point u in the interval such that f(n)(u) is a maximum, 
and a point v such that pn,(v) is a minimum for all values of p" in our 
interval. 
Let us assume that a < b. Then for any t in the interval, b - t is ~ 0,

[Remark: this is the same integral that already came up in the integra-

which is what we wanted. 
The proof in case b < a is similar, except that certain inequalities get 
reversed. We omit it. 
The estimate of the remainder is particularly useful when b is close to 
a. In that case, let us rewrite Taylor's formula by setting b - a = h. We 
obtain: 
Theorem 2.2. Assumptions being as in Theorem 1.1, we .have 
hn - 1 
f(a + h) = f(a) + f'(a)h + ... + j<n-1)(a) (n _ I)! + Rn 
with the estimate 

[XIII, §3] 
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
437 
where M n is a bound for the absolute value of the n-th derivative of f 
between a and a + h. 
In the following sections, we give several examples. We shall often 
take a = 0, so that we have 
f(n-1)(O) 
f(x) = f(O) + f'(O)x + ... + (n _ 1)! xn- 1 + Rix) 
with the estimate 
if M n is a bound for the n-th derivative of f between 0 and x. 
This means that we have expressed f(x) in terms of a polynomial, and a 
remainder term. As we already said, the polynomial 
where 
is called the Taylor polynomial of degree ~ n of f(x). We call Ck the k-th 
Taylor coefficient of f. These polynomials will be computed explicitly for 
all the elementary functions in the next sections. 
A polynomial is essentially the easiest function to deal with. Thus it is 
useful if we can prove that the Taylor polynomials give approximations 
to the given function. For this to be the case, we have to estimate the 
remainder, and it is true in the case of the elementary functions that the 
remainder Rn approaches 0 as n --+ 00. This means that the Taylor po-
lynomial Pn(x) approaches f(x) as n --+ 00, and we therefore get the de-
sired polynomial approximation. 
XIII, §3. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
Let f(x) = sin x and take a = 0 in Taylor's formula. We have already 
mentioned what the derivatives of sin x and cos x are. Thus 
f(O) = 0, 
1'(0) = 1, 
j<2)(O) = 0, 
j<3)(O) = - 1. 

438

We see that all the even terms are 0 because sin 0 = O. 
We can estimate sin x and cos x very simply, because 
Isin xl ~ 1 
and 
Icos xl ~ 1 
for all x. In Theorem 2.2 we take the bound M. = 1, that is 
for all n, and 
Ixl' 
IR.(x)1 ~ - , . 
n. 
Thus if we look at all values of x such that Ixl ~ I, we see that R.(x) 
approaches 0 when n becomes very large. 
Example 1. Compute sin(O.I) to 3 decimals. 
Here we have x = 0.1. We want to find n such that 
By inspection, we see that n = 3 will work. Indeed, we have 
Such an error term would put us within the required range of 
accuracy. Hence we can just use Taylor's formula, 
sin x = x + R3(x). 
We find 
sin(O.I) = 0.1 00 + E, 

[XIII, §3] 
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
439 
with the error term E = R 3(0.1), such that 1 E 1 ~! lO - 3. We see how 
efficient this is for computing the sine for small values of x. 
Definition. We shall say that some expression has the value A with an 
accuracy of lO- n, or to n decimals if the expression is equal to A + E, 
with an error term E such that 
In the preceding example, we may say that sin(O.I) has the value 0.1 
with an accuracy of lO - 3, or to 3 decimals. 
Warning. Do not write sin(O.1) = 0.1. This is false. Always write the 
error, so write 
sin(O.1) = 0.1 + E, 
and then give an estimate for 1 EI. 
Example 2. Let us compute sine of lO° with an accuracy of lO- 3.

We have to express sin(n/18) with the Taylor polynomial of some degree 
and a remainder which has to be estimated. This requires trial and 
error. You should experiment with various possibilities. Here we give 
right away one that works. We have 
If we know n accurately enough, then we can compute the first two 
terms to within any desired accuracy, by means of simple arithmetic: 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Then we have to esti-
mate Rs(n/ 18) to know that it is within the desired accuracy. We have

give an approximation of sine 10° to an accuracy of 10 - S. which is better 
than what we wanted originally. Now try to see how good an approxi-
mation you would get by using just one term: 
Example 3. Compute sin(~ + 0.2) to an accuracy of 10- 4 . 
In this case, we use the Taylor formula for f(a + h). We take

a=-6

h = 0.2. 
By trial and error, and guessing, we try for the remainder R4 . Thus

Convention. In Examples 2 and 3 we left the answer as a sum of a 
few terms, plus an error which we estimated. You do not need to carry 
out the actual decimal expansion of the first four terms. If you have a 
small pocket computer, however, then do it on the computer to see that 
you can actually get a decimal answer. For such a purpose, the machine 
becomes better than the brain, but the brain was better to estimate the 
remainder. 
It is still true that the remainder term of the Taylor formula for 
sin x approaches 0 when n becomes large, even when x is> 1. For this 

[XIII, §3] 
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
441 
we need to investigate x"/n! when x is> 1. The difficulty is that when 
x> 1, then x" becomes large when n --+ 00, and also n! --+ 00 when 
n --+ 00. Thus the numerator and denominator fight each other, and we 
must determine which one wins. Let us deal with an example, just to get 
a feel for what goes on. Take x = 2. What happens to the fraction 2"/n!

Thus we guess the answer by experimenting numerically. Next, our task 
is to prove the general result. 
Theorem 3.1. Let c be any number. Then c"/n! approaches 0 as n 
becomes very large. 
Proof We may assume c > O. Let no be an integer such that no> 2c. 
Thus c < no/2, and c/no < t. We write

TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §3] 
From the theorem we see that the remainder 
approaches 0 as n becomes large. 
Sometimes a definite integral cannot be evaluated from an indefinite 
one, but we can find simple approximations to it by using Taylor's 
expansIOn. 
In the next example, and in exercises, we shall now use frequently the 
estimate for an integral given in Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 of Chapter X, that 
is: Let a < b and let f be continuous on [a, bl Let M be a number 
such that If(x)1 ~ M for all x in the interval. Then 
If f(x) dxl ~ f'f(X)' dx ~ M(b - a).

Also, it can be shown that there is no simple expression giving an 
indefinite integral 
f 
cos x-I 
x 
dx = F(x), 
with a function F(x) expressible in terms of elementary functions. On the 
other hand, as we have seen, we can perfectly well evaluate the definite 
integral to any desired accuracy.

As with the sine function, Theorem 3.1 shows that the remainder term

TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §4] 
Example. 1. Compute e to 3 decimals. 
We have e = e1• From Chapter VIII, §6 we know that e < 4. We 
estimate R7: 
Thus 
1 
1 
e = 1 + 1 + 2 + ... + 6! + R7 
= 2.718 .... 
Of course, the smaller x is, the fewer terms of the Taylor series do we 
need to approximate eX. 
Remark. We had obtained the naive estimate e < 4 in Chapter VIII. 
Now we have the much finer evaluation, which shows in particular that 
e < 3. Thus using a rough estimate and the Taylor formula allows us to 
get a precise determination of e. Even if we had started with knowing 
e < 3 (which could also be obtained by an estimate similar to that of 
Chapter VIII), this would not have helped much more to get the more 
precise value. 
Example 2. How many terms of the Taylor formula do you need to 
compute e 1/ 10 to an accuracy of 1O-3? 
We certainly have e1/ 10 < 2. Thus 
Hence we need just 3 terms (including the O-th term).

XIII, §5. LOGARITHM 
We want to get a Taylor formula for the log. We cannot handle the log 
just by writing 
log x = log 0 + 10g'(O)x + ... 
because log 0 is not defined. Thus for the log, it is better to derive a 
formula with a = 1, so that 
(b -
1)2 
10gb = log 1 + log'(l)(b - 1) + 10g"(I) 
2! 
+ . ... 
Experience shows that it is then more convenient to let 
b=l+x 

450 
TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §5] 
so b - 1 = x. In that way we get a Taylor formula 
We leave it to you (see the exercise in §l) to derive this formula in the 
usual way by computing the derivatives j<k)(O), where f(x) = log(l + x). 
Here we shall obtain the result by another method, which will also be 
applicable in the next section and is in some ways more efficient, and 
makes the series for the log easy to remember. 
You should know from high school the geometric series 
1 
2 
3 
-- =l+u+u +u + ... . 
1 - u 
We shall derive it again below, but for the moment let us work formally 
and not worry about what the infinite sum means. Replacing u by - x 
we get 
1
23 
-- =l-x+x -x + .... 
1 + x 
Integrate the left-hand side, and the right-hand side term by term, 
again without worrying about what the infinite sum means. Then we get 
x 2 
x 3 
X4 
log(l + x) = x - -
+ - - - + . ... 
234 
On the right-hand side we see that the signs alternate, and we have just 
n in the denominator of x"jn, rather than the n! which occurred for 
sin x, cos x, and eX. 
Now we must start all over again, to derive the formula with a re-
mainder term which will allow us to estimate values for the log. Also 
observe that since log 0 is not defined, we shall have to take x in some 
interval of numbers > -1. It turns out that the Taylor formula will 
give values for the function only in the interval 
-l<x~1. 
This contrasts with sin x, cos x, eX when we obtained values for all x. 
Let u be any number # 1. We wish to justify the series 
1 
2 
3 
-- =l+u+u +u + .... 
1 - u 

[XIII, §5] 
LOGARITHM 
451 
Don't worry at first what the infinite sum on the right means. Use it 
formally. If you cross multiply, you obtain 
(1 -
u)(1 + u + U2 + U3 + . .. ) = t + u + U2 + U3 + . .. 
-
U -
U2 -
U3 -'" 
=1. 
So we have justified the geometric series formally. 
Next let us worry about the infinite sum. We don't know how to add 
infinitely many numbers together, so we must state some relation ana-
logue to the above, but with a finite number of terms. This is based on 
the formula 
l-u" 
"-I 
-- =I+u+···+u 
1 - u 
for any integer n > 1. The proof is again obtained by cross-multiplying: 
(1 - u)(1 + u + u2 + ... + U"-I) = 1 + u + u2 + ... + U"-I 
-
U - u2 -
..• -
U"-I -

TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §5] 
Consider the interval -1 < x ~ 1, and take the integral from 0 to x 
(in this interval). The integrals of the powers of t are well known to 
you. The integral 
I

is computed by the substitution u = 1 + t, du = dt. Thus we get: 
Theorem 5.1. For -I < x ~ I, we have 
where the remainder Rn+ l(X) is the integral 
Observe that it was essential that x > - 1 because the expression 
1/(1 + t) has no meaning when t = -I. The above formula also holds 
for x > 1. However, we shall see that the remainder term approaches 0 
only when x lies in the stated interval. 
Case 1. 0 < x ~ I. 
In that case, 1 + t ~ I. Thus 
and our integral is bounded by So tn dt. Thus in that case, 
In particular, the remainder approaches 0 as n becomes large. 
Remark. In the applications we shall use a device which allows us to 
deal only with Case 1. Thus you may omit Case 2 if you wish. 
Case 2. - 1 < x < o. 

[XIII, §5] 
LOGARITHM 
453 
In this case, t lies between 0 and x and is negative, but we still have 
x ~ t ~ 0, 
and 0 < 1 + x < 1 + t. Hence 
To estimate the absolute value of the integral, we can invert the limits 
(we do this because x ~ 0) and thus 
so

x 
+x 
(-xt+ 1 
IRn+ l(x)1 ~ (n + 1)(1 + x) 
(n + 1)(1 + x)' 
Therefore the remainder also approaches 0 in that case. However, when 
x is negative and - 1 < x < 0 then 1 + x < 1 and we cannot esti-
mate 1/(1 + x) in the same way as in Case 1, because we do not have 
1/(1 + x) ~ 1. Thus Case 2 is disagreeable. That is the reason we avoid 
it. 
Example. 
Let us compute log 2 to 3 decimals. 
We know that 
log(l + x) can be computed efficiently only when x is close to O. But 
2 = 1 + 1. We have to use some auxiliary device, which avoids plugging 
x = 1 in the formula. For this, we write 
2 = 1·l 
Then 
1=I+t 
and 
~ = 1 + t. 
By using x = t and x = t we shall achieve what we want. Indeed, 
log 2 = log(1' ~) = log(l + t) + log(1 + t). 
To find log(1 + t) we use x = t and

with the error term E2 = Rs(l/2). We have the estimate 
Therefore 
log 2 = log(l + 1) + log(l + t) 
= Ai + A2 + El + E2, 
[XIII, §5] 
where Ai' A2 are simple expressions which can be computed from frac-
tions using addition, multiplication, and subtraction, and the error term 
is E = El + E2 . We can now estimate E, namely 
This lies within the desired accuracy. If you have a small pocket com-
puter, you can evaluate a numerical decimal for log 2 easily. 
In the above computation, we still needed six or eight terms in the 
polynomial expression approximating the logarithm to get three decimals 
accuracy. In Exercise 2, following the same general idea, you will see 
how to get accurate answers using fewer terms. 
Example. Suppose we want to compute log i to 3 decimals. Note 
that i < 1, and if we tried to evaluate 
log i = log(l - i),

To do this, i.e. compute log(l + 0.1), we take n = 2, and x = 0.1 in 
Case 1. We find that 
Hence 
log( 1.1) = 0.1 - 0.005 + E 
with an error E such that lEI ~! x 10- 3 .

TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §6] 
XIII, §6. THE ARCTANGENT 
We proceed as with the logarithm, except that we put u = - t 2 in the 
geometric series, and obtain 
After integration from 0 to any number x, we obtain: 
Theorem 6.1. The arctan has an expansion 
x 3

and 
When -1 ~ x ~ 1, the remainder approaches 0 as n becomes large. 
Observe how only odd powers of x occur in the Taylor formula for 
arctan x. This is the reason for writing 2m + 1, or R 2m + 1. If we put 
n = 2m + 1. then we can write the estimate for the remainder in the form 
Ixl" 
I R.(x) I ~-. 
n 
This estimate is the same as for the log, except that for arctan, we take 
only odd integers n. 
Remark. If x does not lie in the prescribed interval, i.e. if Ixl > 1, 
then the remainder term does not tend to 0 as n becomes large. For 
instance, if x = 2, then the remainder term is bounded by 
22m+ 1 
2m + 1· 

[XIII, §6] 
THE ARCTANGENT 
457 
By computing a few values with m = 1, 2, 3,... you will see that this 
expression grows large quite fast. You should know this anyhow from 
your study of the exponential function. 
From our theorem, we get a cute expression for n/4: 
nil 
-= 1- - +--··· 
435 
from the Taylor formula for arctan 1. However, it takes many terms to 
get a good approximation to n/4 by this expression. Roughly, it takes 
1000 terms to get accuracy to 10 - 3, which is very inefficient. By using a 
more clever approach, however, we can find n much faster. This is done 
as follows. First we have: 
Addition formula for the tangent: 
tan x + tan y 
tan(x + y) = -----
1 - tan x tan y 
Proof Using the addition formulas for sine and cosine proved m 
Chapter 4, Theorem 3.1, we have 
sin(x + y) 
sin x cos y + cos x sin y 
tan( x + y) = 
= 
.. . 
cos(x + y) 
cos x cos y - sm x sm y 
Now divide numerator and denominator on the right by cos x cos y. 
The desired formula drops out. 
In the addition formula for the tangent, put u = tan x and v = tan y, 
so that x = arctan u and y = arctan v. Since 
arctan(tan(x + y» = x + y = arctan u + arctan v, 
we obtain the addition formula for the arctangent: 
u+v 
arctan u + arctan v = arctan -- . 
1 - uv 
Example. Consider the special values u = 1/2 and v = 1/3. Simple 
arithmetic shows that for these values, we get 
u + v 
1/2 + 1/3 
--= 
= 1. 
1 - uv 
1 - 1/6 

458 
TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
Since arctan 1 = n/4, we obtain the formula: 
n I l  
4 = arctan I = arctan 2 + arctan 3"' 
Next we use the Taylor formula for arctan, 
x3 
arctan x = x - 3 + R5(X) 
with 
Then we obtain 
(I) 
and 
[XIII, §6] 
This is not exceptionally good, but it shows you that with just two terms 
of the polynomial approximating arctan x, we already get about 2 deci-
mals accuracy. Using a couple of more terms, you should be able to get 
4 decimals. 
Similarly, we get

Notice that this final factor of 4 makes the estimate of the error term

have to make sure that in the final step, when you multiply with 4, the 
accuracy lies within the desired bound. Experiment with R7 and R9 to 
acquire a good feeling for the size of these remainders.

XIII, §7. THE BINOMIAL EXPANSION 
In high school, you should have learned the expansion of (a + bt or 
(1 + xt· For instance 
(1 + X)2 = 1 + 2x + x 2, 
(l + x? = 1 + 3x + 3x 2 + x3, 
(1 + X)4 = 1 + 4x + 6x2 + 4x 3 + X4. 

460 
TAYLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §7] 
Just using algebra, one can determine the coefficients for the expansion 
of (l + xt when n is a positive integer. However, here we shall be 
interested also in powers (1 + x)' when s is not a positive integer. For 
this we shall use the general method of Taylor's formula, which states: 
f(2)(0) 
f(n)(o) 
f(x) = f(O) + f(l)(O)x + ~X2 + ... + ~xn + Rn+l(x) 
n Pk)(O) 
k 
= k~O ~ 
X + Rn+l(x). 
We apply this formula to the function 
f(x) = (l + x)s.

Proof Let f(x) = (1 + x)s. Then we compute the derivatives: 
PI)(x) = s(1 + X)S-I, 
P2)(x) = s(s -
1)(1 + X)S-2, 
f(3)(x) = s(s - 1)(s - 2)(1 + xr3, 
Pk)(x) = s(s - 1)· · · (s - k + 1)(1 + x)S-k, 
Hence

(s - k + 1). 
By the general Taylor formula, this proves the desired expansIOn for 
(l + xY· 
The general formula for the remainder term is

in general that Rn(x) approaches 0 when n -+ 00. 
In these estimates, we use repeatedly the fact that 
labl = lallbl. 
For example, products like s(s -
1)(s - 2) occur all the time in these 
estimates. Then 
Is(s - 1)(s - 2)1 = lsi Is - Ills - 21. 
If s = 1/3, we find 
Examples involving Rz 
Now let us look at R 2 • Let

TA YLOR'S FORMULA

For small x, this means that 1 + sx should be a good approximation 
to the s power of 1 + x, if R 2(x) can be proved to be small. This we can 
do easily. We see that 
where c is between 0 and x. By an easy estimate one sees, for instance,

approximately equal to 1 + tx, for small x.

We let x = 0.2 = 2 x 10- 1 and s = 1/2. Then 
ji2 = (1 + 0.2)1/2 = 1 + to.2 + RiO.2) 
= 1 + 0.1 + R2(!)' 
We must estimate R2(1 /5). Since 0 ~ c ~ 1/5 and s - 2 = - 3/2, we find 
s-2 _ 
1 
< 
(l + c) 
- (1 + C)3/2 = 1, 
because the smaller the denominator, the larger the fraction. The only 
information we have on c is that 0 ~ c ~ 1/5, and the smallest possible 
value of the denominator is when c = O. Consequently 
Therefore the estimate for the error term is within the desired accuracy. 
Example 2. Let us compute fi.8 to 2 decimals. 
We use s = 1/2 and x = -0.2. Then 
Jo.8 = (1 - 0.2)1/2 = 1 - to.2 + Ri -0.2) = 0.9 + Ri -0.2). 
Here we have -0.2 ~ c ~ O. Hence 1/(1 + C)3/2 ~ 1/(0.8)3/2, and

THE BINOMIAL EXPANSION

The presence of the term (0.8)3/2, which is < 1, in the denominator 
makes it slightly more cumbersome to estimate than in the preceding 
example, but even then it is not so difficult. Without exerting ourselves, 
to make the estimate simple we replace 3/2 by 2. Then

Remark. In the two cases of Example 1 and Example 2, we have met 
the case when x > 0 and x < O. In the estimate for R2 , this gives rise to 
two different cases:

(l + C)3/2 =

(1 + C)3/2 = (l + X)3/2 
whenever 
x < 0 
and 
x ~ C ~ O. 
The second case is more annoying to treat. 
In the preceding examples, we computed roots of 1 + x when x is 
small. To find roots of an arbitrary number we can often use a trick as 
in the next example, in order to reduce the problem to a root (1 + x)' 
with small x. 
Example 3. Find the value J26 to two decimals. 
For this we write 
26 = 25 + 1 = 25( 1 + ls). 
Then

THE BINOMIAL EXPANSION 
465 
The method in the above example was to find a perfect square near 
26, and then use Taylor's formula for (1 + X)I /2 with a small x. In 
general, one can use a similar method to find the square root of a 
number. Find a perfect square as close to the number as possible, and 
then use Taylor's formula. A similar technique works for cube roots or 
other roots. 
The binomial expansion (1 + x)" and (a + b)" 
We conclude this section by showing how the binomial expansion for 
(1 + x)' using Taylor's formula becomes simpler when s is a positive 
integer n. So let n be a positive integer. Let 
f(x) = (1 + x)". 
We have no difficulty computing the derivatives: 
f(I)(X) = n(1 + x)n-l, 
P2)(X) = n(n -
1)(1 + x)n-2, 
P3)(x) = n(n -
I)(n - 2)xn - 3 , 
pn)(x) = n!, 
pn+ O(x) = o. 
PO(O) 
= n, 
P2)(0) 
= n(n -
I), 
P3)(0) 
= n(n - I)(n - 2), 
pn)(o) 
= n! 
pn + 0(0) = o. 
The new feature here is that pn+O(x) = O. Therefore Pk)(X) = 0 for all 
k ~ n + 1, and the remainder after the n-th term is equal to O. Hence we 
get the exact expression: 
Theorem 7.2. Let n be a positive integer. For any number x, we have 
.. n(n -
1) 
n(n - 1)(n - 2) 
( 1 + x)n = 1 + nx + 
x 2 + 
x 3 + ... + xn. 
2! 
3! 
The coefficient of Xk on the right-hand side is usually denoted by the 
symbol 
and is called a binomial coefficient. Thus from the derivatives which we 
found above, we get 
( n) = n(n - l)(n - 2)·· . (n - k + 1). 
k 
k! 

466 
TA YLOR'S FORMULA 
[XIII, §7] 
The numerator consists of the product of integers in descending order, 
from n to n - k + 1. It differs from n! in that the remaining product 
from (n - k) down to 1 is missing. In order to have a more symmetric 
expression for the binomial coefficient, we multiply the numerator and 
denominator by (n -
k)!. Observe that 
n(n -l)(n - 2)· · ·(n - k + l)(n - k)! = n! 
and consequently we can write the binomial coefficient in the form 
( n) 
n! 
k = k! (n - k)!' 
In this formula, we let 0 ~ k ~ n, and by convention we let 
O! = 1. 
For example: 
( 3) 
3! 
o = O! 3! = 1, 
( 3) 
3! 
3 = 3! O! = 1. 
The integers 1, 3, 3, 1 are exactly the coefficients of the expansion for 
In exercises, you can work out the coefficients for higher powers. 
If we want the expansion of (a + b)n with arbitrary numbers a and b, 
and a "# 0, then we let x = bfa, and so: 
Thus we can write the binomial expansion in the form 

[XIII, §7] 
THE BINOMIAL EXPANSION 
467 
We found this expansion in a fancy way, by using Taylor's formula in 
a case when the remainder is O. In high school, the expansion should 
have been derived in a much more elementary way. The point is that we 
needed this more general technique here in order to compute values 
(1 + x)' with a more general exponent s which may not be an integer. 
For instance, we needed to compute 
(I + X)1 /2 
or 
Then we have to use the method of Taylor's formula. 
Definition. Let s be any real number. We define the binomial co-
efficient 
(S) = s(s -
1)(s - 2) .. ·(s - k + 1) 
k 
k! 
. 
Example. Suppose that s = 1/3. Then 
( 1/3) = ! (! _

3 3 
2!' 
(1/3) = ! (! _ 1) (! _ 2) ~

3!' 
and so on. 
Observe that when s is not an integer, then we cannot multiply 
numerator and denominator by (s - k)! which does not make sense. We 
have to leave the binomial coefficient as in the definition. 
Using the summation sign, we can also write

XIII, §8. SOME LIMITS 
Limits of quotients of functions can be reduced to limits of quotients of 
polynomials by using a few terms from Taylor's expansion. 
Let us first look at polynomials. 
Example 1. Find the limit 
3x - 2X2 + 5x4

7x 
We divide the numerator and denominator by the lowest power of x 
occurring in each, so that we find:

the log.) In each case, we have the estimate

CHAPTER 
XIV 
Series 
Series are a natural continuation of our study of functions. In the pre-
ceding chapter we found how to approximate our elementary functions 
by polynomials, with a certain error term. Conversely, one can define 
arbitrary functions by giving a series for them. We shall see how in the 
sections below. 
In practice, very few tests are used to determine convergence of series. 
Essentially, the comparison test is the most frequent. Furthermore, the 
most important series are those which converge absolutely. Thus we 
shall put greater emphasis on these. 
XIV, §1. CONVERGENT SERIES 
Suppose that we are given a sequence of numbers 
i.e. we are given a number an for each integer n ~ 1. (We picked the 
starting place to be 1, but we could have picked any integer.) We form 
the sums 
It appears to be meaningless to form an infinite sum 

474 
SERIES 
[XIV, §1] 
because we do not know how to add infinitely many numbers. However, 
if our sums sn approach a limit, as n becomes large, then we say that the 
sum of our sequence converges, and we now define its sum to be that 
limit. 
The symbols 
will be called a series. We shall say that the series converges if the sums 
sn approach a limit as n becomes large. Otherwise, we say that it does 
not converge, or diverges. If the series converges, we say that the value 
of the series is

The symbols lim are to be read: "The limit as n becomes large."

As n becomes large, rn+ 1 approaches 0, whence our sums approach

Actually, the same argument works if we take for r any number such 
that 
-1<r<1. 

[XIV, §1] 
CONVERGENT SERIES 
475 
In that case, r"+ I approaches 0 as n becomes large, and consequently we 
can write 
Of course, if Irl > 1, then the series Lr" does not converge. For 
instance, the partial sums of the series with r = - 3 are 
I - 3 + 32 - 33 + ... + ( -It3n• 
Observe that the n-th term (- I )n3n does not even approach 0 as n 
becomes large. 
In view of the fact that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, 
and other standard properties of limits, we get the following theorem. 
Theorem 1.1. Let {an} and {bn} (n = 1,2, ... ) be two sequences and 
assume that the series 
and 
00 
converge. Then L (an + bn) also converges, and is equal to the sum of 
the two series. If c is a number, then 
00

L can = cLan'

sn = at + ... + an 
and 
tn = bl + ... + bn, 
then

L an L bn = lim sntn'

In particular, series can be added term by term. Of course, they can-
not be multiplied term by term! 
We also observe that a similar theorem holds for the difference of two 
series. 

476 
SERIES 
[XIV, §2] 
If a series 2: a. converges, then the numbers a. must approach 0 as n 
becomes large. However, there are examples of sequences {a.} for which 
the series does not converge, and yet 
lim a. = O. 
Consider, for instance, 
1 
1 
I 
1+ - + - + .. ·+ - + .. ·.

n 
We contend that the partial sums s. become very large when n becomes 
large. To see this, we look at partial sums as follows:

1+ - + - + - + - + .. ·+ - + - + .. ·+ - + .. ·. 
2 ~ 
,5 
8,

In each bunch of terms as indicated, we replace each term by that farth-
est to the right. This makes our sums smaller. Thus our expression is

and therefore becomes arbitrarily large when n becomes large. 
XIV, §2. SERIES WITH POSITIVE TERMS 
Throughout this section, we shall assume that our numbers a. are ~ O. 
Then the partial sums 
are increasing, i.e. 
If they are to approach a limit at all, they cannot become arbitrarily 
large. Thus in that case there is a number B such that 
for all n. Such a number B is called an upper bound. By a least upper 
bound we mean a number S which is an upper bound, and such that 

[XIV, §2] 
SERIES WITH POSITIVE TERMS 
477 
every upper bound B is ~ S. We take for granted that a least upper 
bound exists. The collection of numbers {sn} has therefore a least upper 
bound, i.e. there is a smallest number S such that 
for all n. In that case, the partial sums Sn approach S as a limit. In 
other words, given any positive number e > 0, we have 
for all n sufficiently large. 
I 
I I 
8ft 
This simply expresses the fact that S is the least of all upper bounds for 
our collection of numbers Sn' We express this as a theorem. 
Theorem 2.1. Let {an} (n = 1, 2, .. . ) be a sequence of numbers ~ 0 and 
let 
If the sequence of numbers {sn} is bounded, then it approaches a limit 
S, which is its least upper bound.

We look at the groups of terms as indicated. In each group of terms, if 
we decrease the denominator in each term, then we increase the fraction. 
We replace 3 by 2, then 4, 5, 6, 7 by 4, then we replace the numbers 
from 8 to 15 by 8, and so forth. Our partial sums are therefore less than

Thus our partial sums are less than or equal to those of the geometric

Example 3. The series·

n2(1 + 7/n 2 ) 
1 + 7/n 2 
2n4 - n + 3 = n4(2 - (1/n)3 + 3/n4 ) = n2 2 - (1/n)3 + 3/n4 ' 
For n large, the factor 
2 - (1/n)3 + 3/n4 
is certainly bounded, and in fact is near!. Hence we can compare our 
series with 1/n2 to see that it converges, because L 1/n2 converges, and 
the factor is bounded.

XIV, §4. THE INTEGRAL TEST 
You must already have felt that there is an analogy between the conver-
gence of an improper integral and the convergence of a series. We shall 
now make this precise. 

[XIV, §4] 
THE INTEGRAL TEST 
483 
Theorem 4.1. Let f be a function which is defined and positive for all 
x ~ 1, and decreasing. The series 
00 L f(n) 
n=1 
converges if and only if the improper integral 
converges. 
We visualize the situation in the following diagram. 
Consider the partial sums 
f(2) + ... + f(n) 
and assume that our improper integral converges. The area under the 
curve between 1 and 2 is greater than or equal to the area of the rect-
angle whose height is f(2) and whose base is the interval between 1 and 
2. This base has length 1. Thus 
f(2) ~ r 
f(x) dx. 
Again, since the function is decreasing, we have a similar estimate be-
tween 2 and 3: 
f(3) ~ f23 f(x) dx. 
We can continue up to n, and get 
f(2) + f(3) + ... + f(n) ~ f f(x) dx. 

484 
SERIES 
[XIV, §4] 
As n becomes large, we have assumed that the integral approaches a 
limit. This means that 
f(2) + f(3) + ... + f(n) ~ f oo f(x) dx. 
Hence the partial sums are bounded, and hence by Theorem 2.l, they 
approach a limit. Therefore our series converges. 
Conversely, assume that the partial sums 
f(l) + ... + f(n) 
approach a limit as n becomes large. 
The area under the graph of f between 1 and n is less than or equal 
to the sum of the areas of the big rectangles. Thus 
r 
f(x) dx ~ f(1)(2 -
1) = f(l) 
and 
f23 f(x) dx ~ 1(2)(3 - 2) = f(2). 
Proceeding stepwise, and taking the sum, we see that 
ff(X)dX ~ f(l) + . .. + f(n -
1). 
The partial sums on the right are less than or equal to their limit. Call 
this limit L. Then for all positive integers n, we have 
ff(X) dx ~ L. 
Given any number B, we can find an integer n such that B ~ n. Then 
fB f(x) dx ~ f f(x) dx ~ L. 
Hence the integral from 1 to B approaches a limit as B becomes large, 
and this limit is less than or equal to L. This proves our theorem. 

[XIV, §4]

converges. 
Let

f(x)=--. 
x 2 + 1 
Then f is decreasing, and 
f

n 
1 f(x) dx = arctan B - arctan 1 = arctan B - "4' 
485 
As B becomes large, arctan B approaches n/2 and therefore has a limit. 
Hence the integral converges. So does the series, by the theorem.

XIV, §5. ABSOLUTE AND ALTERNATING CONVERGENCE 
00 
We consider a series La. in which we do not assume that the terms a • 
• =1 
are ~ O. We shall say that the series converges absolutely if the series 
formed with the absolute values of the terms a. converges. This is now a 
series with terms ~ 0, to which we can apply the tests for convergence 
given in the two preceding sections. This is important, because we have: 
Theorem 5.1. Let {a.} (n = 1, 2, ... ) be a sequence, and assume that the 
series 
00 
converges. Then so does the series La •. 
n=l 
Proof Let a: be equal to 0 if a. < 0 and equal to a. itself if a. ~ O. Let 
a.- be equal to 0 if a. > 0 and equal to - a. if a. ~ O. Then both a: 
and a.- are ~ O. By assumption and comparison with L la.l, we see that 
each one of the series

n= 1 
We shall use one more test for convergence of a series which may 
have positive and negative terms. 

[XIV, §5] 
ABSOLUTE AND ALTERNATING CONVERGENCE 
487 
00 
Theorem 5.2. Let L an be a series such that 
n=I 
lim an = 0, 
such that the terms an are alternately positive and negative, and such 
that lan+ 11 ~ lanl for n ~ 1. Then the series is convergent. 
Proof Let us write the series in the form 
with bn , Cn ~ O. Let 
sn = bI -
c I + b2 -
c2 + ... + bn, 
tn = bI -
C I + b2 -
C2 + ... + bn -
Cn' 
Since the absolute values of the terms decrease, it follows that 
and 
i.e. that the Sn are decreasing and the tn are increasing. Indeed, 
and 
Thus we subtract more from Sn by Cn than we add afterwards by bn + l' 
Hence Sn ~ Sn+ l' Furthermore, Sn ~ tn' 
Hence we may visualize our 
sequences as follows: 
Note that Sn -
tn = Cn' and that en approaches 0 as n becomes large. If 
we let L be the greatest lower bound for the sequence {sn}, and M be 
the least upper bound for the sequence {tn}, then 
for all n. Since the difference Sn - tn becomes arbitrarily small, it follows 
that L - M is arbitrarily small, and hence equal to O. Thus L = M, and 
this proves that Sn and tn approach L as a limit, whence our series Lan 
converges to L.

Example. The series 
is convergent, but not absolutely convergent. 
Remark. Not all series which are convergent are either absolutely 
convergent, or are of the above alternating type. However, these two

we have laid emphasis on them.

more at Columbia College, showed that the series is differentiable at all

these are the only points where the function is differentiable. Cf. his articles

Perhaps the most important series are power series. Let x be any 
number and let {an} (n = 0, 1, ... ) be a sequence of numbers. Then we 
can form the series 
The partial sums are

We have already met such sums when we discussed Taylor's formula. 
Example. The power series

any number R > 0, the above series converges for ° < x ~ R. We use

particular is < t, so that we can apply the ratio test to prove our asser-
tion.

Similarly, we could prove that the series

and 
converge absolutely for all x, letting for instance 
X 2n + 1 
bn = (2n + I)! 
for the first one. Then bn+dbn = x 2j[(2n + 3)(2n + 2)], and we can argue 
as before. 
Theorem 6.1. Assume that there is a number r ~ 0 such that the series 
converges. Then for all x such that I x I ~ r, the series 
converges absolutely. 
Proof The absolute value of each term is 
Our assertion follows from the comparison Theorem 2.2. 
The least upper bound of all numbers r for which we have the conver-
gence stated in the theorem is called the radius of convergence of the 
series. If there is no upper bound for the numbers r such that the power 
series above converges, then we say that the radius of convergence is 
infinity. 
Suppose that there is an upper bound for the numbers r above, and 
thus let s be the radius of convergence of the series. Then if x > s, the 
series 
does not converge. Thus the radius of convergence s is the number such 
that the series converges absolutely if 0 < x < S but does not converge 
absolutely if x > s. 

[XIV, §6] 
POWER SERIES 
491 
Theorem 6.1 allows us to define a function f; namely, for all numbers 
x such that I x I < s, we define 
Our proofs that the remainder term in Taylor's formula approaches 0 
for various functions now allow us to say that these functions are given 
by their Taylor series. Thus

for all x. Furthermore, 
x2 
log( 1 + x) = x - -
+ ... 
2 
is valid for - 1 < x < 1. 
(Here we saw that the series converges for x = I, but it does not 
converge absolutely, cf. §1.) 
However, we can now define functions at random by means of a 
power series, provided we know the power series converges absolutely, 
for Ixl < r. 
The ratio test usually gives an easy way to determine when a power 
series converges, or when it diverges. 
Example. Prove that the series 
~ log n

Since log(n + 1)/log nand (n/(n + 1»2 approach 1 when n becomes very 
large, it follows that if c < c 1 < 1, then for all n sufficiently large 
bn + 1 
--<c 
b = 1 
n 
and hence our series converges. This is true for every c such that 
0< c < 1, and hence the series converges absolutely for Ixl < 1. 
Let c > 1. If x ~ c then for all n sufficiently large, it follows that 
bn + dbn ~ 1, whence the series does not converge. This is so for all c > 1, 
and hence the series does not converge if x > 1. Hence 1 is the radius of 
convergence. 
If a power series converges absolutely only for x = 0, then we agree to 
say that its radius of convergence is O. For example, the radius of con-
vergence of the series 
00 L n!xn 
n=1 
is equal to 0, as one sees by using the ratio test in the divergent case. 
Root test. Let L anxn be a power series and assume that 
where s is a number. If s;/;O then the radius of convergence of the 
series is equal to l/s. If s = 0, then the radius of convergence is irifin-
ity. If lanl1/n becomes arbitrarily large as n becomes large, then the 
radius of convergence is O. 
Proof Without loss of generality, we may assume that an ~ 0 for all 
n. Suppose first that s is a number ;/; 0, and let 0 ~ r < l/s. Then sr < 1. 
The numbers a~ /nr approach sr and hence there is some number /: > 0 
such that 
a~ /nr < 1 -/: 
for all n sufficiently large. Hence the series L anrn converges by compar-
ison with the geometric series. If on the other hand r> l/s, then a~ /nr 
approaches sr> 1, and hence we have 
for all n sufficiently large. Comparison from below shows that the series 
L an'" diverges. We leave the cases s = 0 or s = 00 to the reader.

XIV, §7. DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION OF 
POWER SERIES 
If we have a polynomial 
x" 
with numbers ao, a I"" ,an as coefficients, then we know how to find its 
derivative. It is a l + 2a 2x + ... + nanxn- I • We would like to say that 
the derivative of a series can be taken in the same way, and that the 
derivative converges whenever the series does.

Theorem 7.1. Let r be a number > 0 and let L anxn be a series which 
converges absolutely for Ixl < r. Then the series Lnanxn- 1 also con-
verges absolutely for Ixl < r. 
Proof. Since we are interested in the absolute convergence, we may 
assume that an ~ 0 for all n. Let 0 < x < r, and let c be a number such 
that x < c < r. Recall that 
lim n1/n = 1. 
We may write 
Then for all n sufficiently large, we conclude that 
because n 1/nx comes arbitrarily close to x. Hence for all n sufficiently 
large, we have 
We can then compare the series L nanxn with L ancn to conclude that 
L nanxn converges. Since 
we have proved Theorem 7.1. 
A similar result holds for integration, but trivially. Indeed, if we have 
00 
a series L anxn which converges absolutely for Ixl < r, then the series

The preceding results can be expressed by saying that an absolutely 
convergent power series can be integrated and differentiated term by 
term and still yield an absolutely convergent power series. 
It is natural to expect that if

then f is differentiable and its derivative is given by differentiating the

By Theorem 7.1 applied twice, we know that the series appearing on the 
right converges. It is equal to a fixed constant. As h approaches 0, it 
follows that the expression on the right approaches 0, so the expression 
on the left also approaches O. This proves that f is differentiable at x, 
00 
and that its derivative is equal to L na.x' - I, for all x such that I x I < b . 
• =\ 
This is true for all b, 0 < b < r, and therefore concludes the proof of our 
theorem.

Theorem 7.3. Let f(x) = L a.x' be a power series, which converges

absolutely for Ixl < r. Then the relation 
f f(x) dx = I ~

is valid in the interval I x I < r. 
Proof We know that the series for f integrated term by term con-
verges absolutely in the interval. By the preceding theorem, its derivative 
term by term is the series for the derivative of the function, thereby 
proving our assertion. 
Example. If we had never heard of the exponential function, we could 
define a function

f(x) = 1 + x + -

Hence by what we know from Chapter VIII, §1, Exercise 8, we conclude 
that 
f(x) = Kex 
for some constant K. Letting x = 0 shows that 
1 = f(O) = K. 
Thus K = 1 and f(x) = eX.

C(x) = -S(x). 
Furthermore, S(O) = 0 and C(O) = 1. It can then be shown easily that 
any pair of functions S(x) and C(x) satisfying these properties must be 
the sine and cosine.

APPENDIX 
To the First Four Parts 
e and b 
This appendix is intended to show how the notions of limits and the 
properties of limits can be explained and proved in terms of the notions 
and properties of numbers. We therefore assume the latter and carry out 
the proofs from there. 
There remains the problem of showing how the real numbers can be 
defined in terms of the rational numbers, and the rational numbers in 
terms of integers. This takes too long to be included in this book. 
Aside from the ordinary rules for addition, multiplication, subtraction, 
division (by non-zero numbers), ordering, positivity, and inequalities, 
there is one more basic property satisfied by the real numbers. This 
property is stated in §1. Our proofs then use only these properties. 
Warning. The level of abstract understanding and use of language 
needed to master this appendix is considerably higher than for the rest of 
the book. We are involved in "proving" properties which are intuitively 
very clear. Hence you should not take this appendix too seriously unless 
you are theoretically inclined, or you wish to have an introduction to 
some essential tools of analysis, i.e. a first acquaintance, which will plant 
some ideas in your head for future use in higher courses, when the tech-
niques described here become essential because more intricate estimates 
are needed when dealing with such higher analysis. It is useful to have 
seen the stuff previously, even though you may not have mastered it the 
first time. It is part of our psychology that we learn by approximation. 
Furthermore, knowledge at one level is fully mastered only when you use 
it at the next level of depth. Hence studying harder things, even though 
you have a limited understanding of them, makes it possible to under-
stand fully the easier things.

t: AND <> 
[APP., §1] 
Nevertheless, this appendix should be omitted under ordinary circum-
stances. 
APP., §1. LEAST UPPER BOUND 
We meet again the problem of where to jump into the theory. It would 
be long and tedious to jump in too early. Hence we assume known the 
contents of Chapter I, §1 and §2. These involve the ordinary operations 
of addition and multiplication, and the notion of ordering, positivity, 
negative numbers, and inequalities. Those who are interested in seeing 
the logical development of these notions are referred to books on analy-
SIS. 
A collection of numbers will simply be called a set of numbers. This 
is shorter and is the usual terminology. If a set has at least one number 
in it, we say that it is non-empty. A set S' is called a subset of S if every 
element of S' is an element of S. In other words, if S' is part of S. 
Let S be a non-empty set of numbers. We shall say that S is bounded 
from above if there exists a number B such that 
x;£B 
for all x in our set S. We then call B an upper bound for S. 
A least upper bound for S is an upper bound L such that any upper 
bound B for S satisfies the inequality B ~ L. If M is another least upper 
bound, then we have M ~ Land L ~ M, whence L = M. Consequently, 
a least upper bound is unique. 
Similarly, we define the notions of bounded from below, and of great-
est lower bound. (Do it yourself.) 
We shall now give examples, assuming that the reader has an intuitive 
notion of the real numbers. They make our meaning clearer, but we do 
not give proofs. Although this is the reverse of the logical order, it is the 
appropriate psychological order. 
Example. The set of positive integers {1, 2, 3, .. } is not bounded from 
above. It is bounded from below. The number 1 is a greatest lower 
bound. 
Example. Let S be the set of numbers x such that 0 ~ x and x 2 < 2. 
This set is bounded from below, for instance by 0; it is also bounded 
from above, and 2 is certainly an upper bound. As a matter of fact, J2 
is the least upper bound. Note that the least upper bound does not lie 
in the set S, that is, is not an element of S. 

[APP., §1] 
LEAST UPPER BOUND 
503 
Example. Let T be the set of numbers x such that 0 ~ x and x 2 ~ 2. 
Again, j2 is the least upper bound of T, and is an element of T. It 
should be intuitively clear that T differs from S only in that it contains 
the additional element j2. 
Example. Let U be the set of all numbers lin, where n ranges over 
the positive integers. 
Thus U consists of {l, t, t, ... }. 
Then U is 
bounded. The number 1 is its least upper bound, and lies in U. The 
number 0 is the greatest lower bound, and does not lie in U. 
The real numbers satisfy a property which is not satisfied by the set of 
rational numbers, namely: 
Fundamental property. Every non-empty set S of numbers which is 
bounded from above has a least upper bound. Every non-empty set of 
numbers S which is bounded from below has a greatest lower bound. 
Proposition 1.1. Let a be a number such that 
1 
O::S;a< -
-
n 
for every positive integer n. Then a = O. There is no number b such 
that b ~ n for every positive integer n. 
Proof. Suppose there is a number a "# 0 such that a < lin for every 
positive integer n. Then n < 11a for every positive integer n. Thus to 
prove both our assertions, it will suffice to prove the second. 
Suppose there is a number b such that b ~ n for every positive integer 
n. Let S be the set of positive integers. Then S is bounded, and hence 
has a least upper bound. Let C be this least upper bound. No number 
strictly less than C can be an upper bound. Since 0 < 1, we have 
C < C + 1, whence C - 1 < C. Hence there is a positive integer n such 
that 
C - t < n. 
This implies that C < n + 1 and n + 1 is a posItIve integer. We have 
contradicted our assumption that C is an upper bound for the set of 
postive integers, so no such upper bound can exist. 
Observe that Proposition 1.1 proves that the set of positive integers is 
not bounded from above. It is reasonable to ask if this sort of obvious 
property really needs the least upper bound axiom to be proved, and the 
answer is yes. One can construct systems satisfying all the ordinary rules 
for addition, multiplication, division (by non-zero elements), inequalities, 

504 
e AND b 
[APP., §2] 
such that the least upper bound axiom is not satisfied, and such that 
there exists an element t in the system with the property that n < t for 
all positive integers n. We don't want to make this appendix too long, 
and we won't go into the construction of such systems, but it is probably 
illuminating for you to have it confirmed that the least upper bound 
property was needed in the proof of Proposition l.t. 
APP., §1. EXERCISES 
Determine in each case whether the set is bounded from above, from below, and 
describe the least upper bound and greatest lower bound if it exists, without 
giving proofs, just using your intuition of numbers.

5. Let S be the set of numbers x such that 0 ~ x and x 2 ~ 2. Prove that the 
least upper bound of S is a number b such that b2 = 2. [Hint : Prove that 
b2 > 2 and b2 < 2 are impossible.] 
APP., §2. LIMITS 
Let S be a set of numbers and let f be a function defined for all 
numbers in S. Let Xo be a number. We shall assume that S is arbitrarily 
close to x o, i.e. given e > 0 there exists an element x of S such that 
Ix - xol < e. Let L be a number. We shall say that f(x) approaches the 
limit L as x approaches Xo if the following condition is satisfied: 
Given a number e > 0, there exists a number b > 0 such that for all x 
in S satisfying 
Ix - xol < b 
we have 
If(x) - LI < e. 

[APP., §2] 
LIMITS 
505 
If that is the case, then we write 
lim f(x) = L. 
x ..... xo 
We could also rephrase this as follows. We write 
lim f(x o + h) = L 
h-O 
and say that the limit of f(xo + h) is L as h approaches 0 if the following 
condition is satisfied: 
Given e > 0, there exists J > 0 such that whenever h is a number with 
Ihl < J and Xo + h in S, then 
If(xo + h) - LI < e. 
We note that our definition of limit depends on the set S on which f 
is defined. Thus we should say "limit with respect to S." The next 
proposition shows that this is really unnecessary. 
Proposition 2.1. Let S be a set of numbers arbitrarily close to Xo and 
let S' be a subset of S, also arbitrarily close to xo' Let f be a function 
defined on S. If 
limf(x) = L 
(with respect to S), 
lim f(x) = M 
(with respect to S'), 
x ..... xo 
then L = M . In particular, the limit is unique. 
Proof Given e > 0, there exists J I > 0 such that whenever x is in S' 
and Ix - xol < J 1 we have 
e 
If(x) - LI < 2' 
and there exists J2 > 0 such that whenever Ix - xol < J 2 then 
e 
If(x) - MI < 2' 

506 
e AND () 
[APP., §2] 
Let () = min«()l' ()2)' If Ix - xol < () then 
e 
e 
IL - MI ~ IL - f(x) + f(x) - MI < 2 + 2 = e. 
Hence IL - MI is less than any e> 0, and by Proposition 1.1, we must 
have IL - MI = 0, whence 
L-M=O 
and 
L=M. 
In practice from now on, we omit to state that x is an element of S. 
The context makes it clear each time. 
Furthermore, in many subsequent proofs, we shall need several simul-
taneous inequalities to be satisfied, just as in the preceding proof we had 
inequalities with c5 1 and c5 2 . In each case, we use a similar trick, letting c5 
be the minimum of c5 1, c5 2 , c53 , ••• needed to make each desired inequality 
valid. Thus in writing down the proofs, we omit the intermediate 
c5 1, c52 , c5 3 ···· 
Remark. Suppose that lim f(x) = L. Then there exists c5 > 0 such 
that whenever Ix - xol < c5 we have 
If(x)1 < ILl + 1. 
Indeed, given 1 > 0 there exists () such that whenever Ix - xol < c5 we 
have 
If(x) - LI < 1, 
so that our assertion follows from standard properties of inequalities. 
Also, note that we have trivially 
lim e = e 
for any number e, viewed as a constant function on S. Indeed, given 
e > 0, 
Ie - CI < e. 
Remark. We mention a word about limits "when x becomes large." 
Let a be a number and f a function defined for all numbers x ;::; a. Let 
L be a number. We shall say that f(x) approaches L as x becomes large, 
and we write 
lim f(x) = L 

[APP., §2] 
LIMITS 
507 
if the following condition is satisfied. Given e > 0 there exists a number 
A such that whenever x > A we have 
If(x) - LI < e. 
In practice, instead of saying "when x becomes large," we sometimes 
say "when x approaches (f) ." We leave it to you to define the analogous 
notion "when x becomes large negative," or "x approaches -
(f)." 
In the definition of lim we took a function f defined for x ~ a. If 
a l > a, and we restrict the function to all numbers ~ ai' then the limit 
as x becomes very large will be the same. 
Let us suppose that a ~ 1. Define a function 9 for values of x such 
that 
0< x ~ l/a 
by the condition 
g(x) = f(l/x). 
Then a second's thought will allow you to prove that 
lim g(x) 
x-o 
exists if and only if 
lim f(x) 
exists, and that they are equal. 
Consequently all properties which we prove concerning limits as x 
approaches 0 (or a number) immediately give rise to similar properties 
concerning limits as x becomes very large. We leave their formulations 
to you. 
An important case occurs when the function is defined for the positive 
integers. Then it is called a sequence. A sequence of numbers is usually 
denoted by 
or simply {an}. 
Example. Let an = f(n) = (-1)". Then 
and so forth. Observe that numbers of the sequence indexed by different 
integers, for instance a2 and a4 , may be equal. 

508 
e AND b 
[APP., §2] 
Example. Let an = 2n. This defines the sequence of positive even inte-
gers. 
Example. Let an = 2n + 1. This defines the sequence of odd positive 
integers ~ 3. 
Example. We have lim l/nx = 0 for any number x"# O. To prove 
this, say x > o. Given e, let N be a positive integer such that liN < ex. 
If n ~ N, then 
and therefore l/nx < e. This proves our assertion when x> O. The proof 
when x < 0 is similar. Carry it out completely. 
The next theorems, concerning the basic properties of limits, describe 
limits of sums, products, quotients, inequalities, and composite functions. 
Theorem 2.2. Let S be a set of numbers, and f, g two functions defined 
for all numbers in S. Let Xo be a number. If 
lim f(x) = L 
X-Xo 
and 
lim g(x) = M, 
X-Xo 
then lim (f + g)(x) exists and is equal to L + M. 
Proof. Given e > 0, there exists b > 0 such that, whenever Ix - xol < b 
(and x is in S), we have 
e 
If(x) - LI < 2' 
e 
Ig(x) - MI < 2· 
We observe that 
If(x) + g(x) - L - MI ~ If(x) - LI + Ig(x) - MI < e. 
This proves that L + M is the limit of (f + g)(x) as x approaches xo.

by Corollary 2.5. Let K be this limit. We must show K ~ O. Suppose 
K < O. Then -K > 0 and IKI = -K. Given e > 0 there exists () > 0 
such that whenever Ix - xol < () we have 
1<I>(x) - KI < e, 
whence 
<I>(x) - K < e. 
Since <I>(x) ~ 0, we get - K < e for all e > O. In particular, for all posi-
tive integers n we get - K < lin. But - K > O. This contradicts Propo-
sition 1.l. 
Theorem 2.9. Let the notation be as in Theorem 2.8 and assume that 
M = L. Let 1/1 be a function on S such that 
g(x) ;£ I/I(x) ;£ f(x) 
for all x in S. Then 
lim I/I(x)

exists and is equal to L (or M).

Theorem 2.10. Let S, T be sets of numbers, and let f, g be functions 
defined on Sand T respectively. Let Xo be arbitrarily close to S. 
Assume that for all x in S we have f(x) in T, so that g o f is defined. 
Assume that

A sequence is a function defined on a set of integers ;;; O. Usually, this 
set consists of all positive integers. In that case, a sequence amounts to 
giving numbers 
for each positive integer, and we denote the sequence by 
{an} (n = 1, 2, ... ). 
If the set consists of all integers ;;; 0, then we denote the sequence by 
{an} (n = 0, 1,2, ... ). 
Let {an} (n = 1,2, ... ) be a sequence. Let C be a number. We say 
that C is a point of accumulation of the sequence if given t: > 0 there 
exist infinitely many integers n such that 
Ian - CI < t:. 
Let {an} (n = 1, 2, ... ) be a sequence, and L a number. We shall say 
that L is a limit of the sequence if given E > 0 there exists an integer N 
such that for all n > N we have 
Ian - LI < E. 
The limit is then unique (same type of proof as we had for limits of 
functions ). 
We shall say that the sequence {an} (n = 1, 2, ... ) is increasing if 
an ~ an + 1 for all positive integers n. 

[APP., §3] 
POINTS OF ACCUMULATION

Theorem 3.t. Let {an} (n = 1, 2, ... ) be an increasing sequence, and 
assume that it is bounded Jrom above. Then the least upper bound L is 
a limit oj the sequence. 
ProoJ. Given I: > 0 the number L - (1:/2) is not an upper bound for 
the sequence. Hence there exists some number aN such that 
This inequality is also satisfied for all n > N, since the sequence IS 
increasing. But 
because L is an upper bound. Thus

Corollary 3.2. Let {an} (n = 1,2, . .. ) be a sequence, and let A, B be two 
numbers such that A ~ an ~ B Jor all positive integers n. Then there 
exists a point oj accumulation C oj the sequence between A and B. 
ProoJ. For each integer n we let bn be the greatest lower bound 
of the set of numbers {an,an+l,an+2""}' Then bn ~ bn+1 ~ "
' , i.e. 
{b n } (n = 1, 2, ... ) is an increasing sequence, and B is an upper bound. 
Let L be its limit, as in Theorem 3.1. We leave it to you as an exercise 
to prove that this limit is a point of accumulation. 
One can reduce the notion of limit of a sequence to that of limits 
defined previously. 
Let S be the set of numbers 
1, 2' 3' 
, 
n 
i.e. the set of numbers which can be written as l/n, where n is a positive 
integer. 
If {an} (n = 1, 2, ... ) is a sequence, we let J be a function defined by S 
by the rule

Then you will verify immediately that

exists, and in that case the two limits are equal. We say that a sequence 
{an} approaches a number L when n becomes large if 
Thus properties concerning limits in the sense of §2 immediately gIVe 
rise to properties concerning limits of sequences (for instance, limits of 
sums, products, quotients). We leave their translations to you. 
APP., §3. EXERCISES 
1. Let {In} be a sequence of closed intervals, say In = [a., bJ, where [a, b] means 
the set of numbers x such that a ~ x ~ b. Suppose that the left-hand points of

and that the right-hand points decrease (that is b. + 1 ~ b. for all positive inte-
gers n). Let L(In) be the length of the interval In' that is

CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS 
517 
APP., §4. CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS 
Let f be a function defined on a set of numbers S. Let Xo be a number 
in S. Then S is arbitrarily close to Xo· We say that f is continuous at Xo 
if 
lim f(x) = f(xo)· 
Note that there may be two numbers a, b with a < Xo < b such that Xo 
is the only point which is in the interval and lies also in S. (In this case, 
one could say that Xo is an isolated point of S.) 
If follows at once from our definition that if {an} (n = 1,2, .. . ) is a 
sequence of numbers in S such that 
and f is continuous at xo, then 
It is immediate that the sum, product, quotient of continuous func-
tions are again continuous. (In the quotient, we have to assume that 
f(x o) # 0, of course.) Every constant function is continuous. The func-
tion f(x) = x is continuous for all x. This is trivially verified. From the 
quotient theorem, we see that the function 
1 
f(x) = -x 
(defined for x # 0) is continuous. 
Theorem 4.1. Let f and 9 be continuous functions such that the values 
of f are contained in the domain of definition of g. 
Then g o f is 
continuous. 
Proof. Let Xo be a number at which f is defined, and let 
Yo = f(xo)· 
Given 8> 0, since 9 is continuous at Yo, there exists <51 > ° such that if 
Iy - Yol < <5 1, then 
Ig(y) - g(yo)! < 8.

e AND 1J 
[APP., §4] 
Now with the above b1 being given, there exists b > 0 such that if 
I x -
Xo I < b then 
Hence 
Ig(f(x» - g(f(xo» I < e, 
thus proving our theorem. 
Theorem 4.2. Let f be a continuous function on a closed interval 
a ;£ x ;£ b. Then there exists a point c in the interval such that f(c) is 
a maximum, and there exists a point d in the interval such that f(d) is a 
minimum. 
Proof. We shall first prove that f is bounded, i.e. that there exists a 
number M such that If(x) I ;£ M for all x in the interval. 
If f is not bounded, then for every positive integer n we can find a 
number Xn in the interval such that I f(xn) I > n. The sequence of such Xn 
has a point of accumulation C in the interval. We have 
If(xn) - f(c)1 ~ If(xn)1 - If(C)1 
~ n - f(C). 
Given e > 0, there exists a 1J > 0 such that, whenever 
we have If(xn) - f(c)1 < e. This has to happen for infinitely many n, 
since C is an accumulation point. Our statements are contradictory, and 
we therefore conclude that the function is bounded. 
Let P be the least upper bound of the set of values f(x) for all x in 
the interval. Then given a positive integer n, we can find a number Zn in 
the interval such that 
1 
If(zn) - PI <-. 
n 
Let c be a point of accumulation of the sequence of numbers 
{Zn} 
(n = 1,2, .. . ). 
Then f(c) ;£ p. We contend that 
f(c) = P 
(this will prove our theorem). 

[APP., §4] 
CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS 
519 
Given e > 0, there exists 0> ° such that whenever IZn - cl < 0 we 
have 
If(zn) - f(c)1 < e. 
This happens for infinitely many n, since c is a point of accumulation of 
the sequence {zn}. But 
If(c) - PI ~ If(c) - f(zn)1 + If(zn) - PI 
1 
< e + - . 
n 
This is true for every e and infinitely many positive integers n. Hence 
If(c) - PI = ° 
and f(c) = p. 
The proof for the minimum is similar and will be left as an exercise. 
Theorem 4.3. Let f be a continuous function on a closed interval 
a ~ x ~ b. Let (J. = f(a) and P = f(b). Let y be a number such that 
(J. < Y < p. Then there exists a number c between a and b such that 
f(c) = y. 
Proof. Let S be the set of numbers x in the interval such that 
f(x) ~ y. Then S is not empty because a is in it, and b is an upper 
bound for S. Let c be its least upper bound. Then c is in our interval. 
We contend that f(c) = y. If f(c) < y, then c '" b, and f(x) < y for all 
x > c sufficiently close to c, because f is continuous at c. This contra-
dicts the fact that c is an upper bound for S. If f(c) > y, then c '" a, and 
f(x) > y for all x < c sufficiently close to c, again because f is contin-
uous at c. This contradicts the fact that c is a least upper bound for S. 
We conclude that f(c) = y, as was to be shown. 

Part Five 
Functions of 
Several Variables 
In the first chapter of this part, we consider vectors, which form the 
basic algebraic tool in investigating functions of several variables. The 
differentiation aspects of them which we take up are those which can be 
handled up to a point by "one variable" methods. The reason for this is 
that in higher dimensional space, we can join two points by a curve, and 
study a function by looking at its values only on this curve. This re-
duces many higher dimensional problems to problems of a one-dimen-
sional situation. 

CHAPTER 
XV 
Vectors 
The concept of a vector is basic for the study of functions of several 
variables. It provides geometric motivation for everything that follows. 
Hence the properties of vectors, both algebraic and geometric, will be 
discussed in full. 
One significant feature of all the statements and proofs of this part is 
that they are neither easier nor harder to prove in 3-space than they are 
in 2-space. 
XV, §1. DEFINITION OF POINTS IN SPACE 
We know that a number can be used to represent a point on a line, 
once a unit length is selected. 
A pair of numbers (i.e. a couple of numbers) (x, y) can be used to 
represent a point in the plane. 
These can be pictured as follows : 
y ---- , (x, y) 
x 
• 
• 
o 
x 
(a) Point on a line 
(b) Point in a plane 
Figure 1 
We now observe that a triple of numbers (x, y, z) can be used to 
represent a point in space, that is 3-dimensional space, or 3-space. We 
simply introduce one more axis. Figure 2 illustrates this.

Figure 2 
Instead of using x, y, z we could also use (XI' X2' X3)' The line could 
be called i-space, and the plane could be called 2-space. 
Thus we can say that a single number represents a point in i-space. 
A couple represents a point in 2-space. A triple represents a point in 3-
space. 
Although we cannot draw a picture to go further, there is nothing to 
prevent us from considering a quadruple of numbers. 
and decreeing that this is a point in 4-space. A quintuple would be a 
point in 5-space, then would come a sextuple, septuple, octuple, .... 
We let ourselves be carried away and define a point in n-space to be 
an n-tuple of numbers 
if n is a positive integer. We shall denote such an n-tuple by a capital 
letter X, and try to keep small letters for numbers and capital letters for 
points. We call the numbers XI"
" ,Xn the coordinates of the point X. 
For example, in 3-space, 2 is the first coordinate of the point (2,3, -4), 
and -4 is its third coordinate. We denote n-space by Rn. 
Most of our examples will take place when n = 2 or n = 3. Thus the 
reader may visualize either of these two cases throughout the book. 
However, three comments must be made. 
First, we have to handle n = 2 and n = 3, so that in order to avoid a 
lot of repetitions, it is useful to have a notation which covers both these 
cases simultaneously, even if we often repeat the formulation of certain 
results separately for both cases. 

[XV, §1] 
DEFINITION OF POINTS IN SPACE 
525 
Second, no theorem or formula is simpler by making the assumption 
that n = 2 or 3. 
Third, the case n = 4 does occur in physics. 
Example 1. One classical example of 3-space is of course the space we 
live in. After we have selected an origin and a coordinate system, we can 
describe the position of a point (body, particle, etc.) by 3 coordi-
nates. Furthermore, as was known long ago, it is convenient to extend 
this space to a 4-dimensional space, with the fourth coordinate as time, 
the time origin being selected, say, as the birth of Christ-although this 
is purely arbitrary (it might be more convenient to select the birth of the 
solar system, or the birth of the earth as the origin, if we could deter-
mine these accurately). Then a point with negative time coordinate is a 
BC point, and a point with positive time coordinate is an AD point. 
Don't get the idea that "time is the fourth dimension", however. The 
above 4-dimensional space is only one possible example. In economics, 
for instance, one uses a very different space, taking for coordinates, say, 
the number of dollars expended in an industry. For instance, we could 
deal with a 7-dimensional space with coordinates corresponding to the 
following industries: 
1. Steel 
2. Auto 
5. Chemicals 
6. Clothing 
3. Farm products 
7. Transportation. 
4. Fish 
We agree that a mega buck per year is the unit of measurement. Then a 
point 
(1,000, 800, 550, 300, 700, 200, 900) 
in this 7-space would mean that the steel industry spent one billion 
dollars in the given year, and that the chemical industry spent 700 mil-
lion dollars in that year. 
The idea of regarding time as a fourth dimension is an old one. 
Already in the Encyclopedie of Diderot, dating back to the eighteenth 
century, d' Alembert writes in his article on "dimension": 
Cette maniere de considerer les quantites de plus de trois dimensions est 
aussi exacte que l'autre, car les lettres peuvent toujours etre regardees 
comme representant des nombres rationnels ou non. J'ai dit plus haut qu'il 
n'etait pas possible de concevoir plus de trois dimensions. Un homme 
d'esprit de rna connaissance croit qu'on pourrait cependant regarder la 
duree comme une quatrieme dimension, et que Ie produit temps par la 
solidite serait en quelque maniere un produit de quatre dimensions; cette 
idee peut etre contestee, mais elle a, ce me semble, quelque merite, quand 
ce ne sera it que ceIui de la nouveaute. 
Encyclopedie, Vol. 4 (1754), p. 1010 

526 
VECTORS 
[XV, §1] 
Translated, this means: 
This way of considering quantities having more than three dimensions is 
just as right as the other, because algebraic letters can always be viewed as 
representing numbers, whether rational or not. I said above that it was 
not possible to conceive more than three dimensions. A clever gentleman 
with whom I am acquainted believes that nevertheless, one could view 
duration as a fourth dimension, and that the product time by solidity 
would be somehow a product of four dimensions. This idea may be chal-
lenged, but it has, it seems to me, some merit, were it only that of being 
new. 
Observe how d'Alembert refers to a "clever gentleman" when he appar-
ently means himeself. He is being rather careful in proposing what must 
have been at the time a far out idea, which became more prevalent in 
the twentieth century. 
D'Alembert also visualized clearly higher dimensional spaces as "prod-
ucts" of lower dimensional spaces. For instance, we can view 3-space as 
putting side by side the first two coordinates (Xl' x 2) and then the third 
X 3 • Thus we write 
We use the product sign, which should not be confused with other 
"products", like the product of numbers. The word "product" is used in 
two contexts. Similarly, we can write 
There are other ways of expressing R4 as a product, namely 
This means that we view separately the first two coordinates (Xl' x 2 ) and 
the last two coordinates (X3' x 4 ). We shall come back to such products 
later. 
We shall now define how to add points. If A, B are two points, say 
in 3-space, 
and 
then we define A + B to be the point whose coordinates are 
Example 2. In the plane, if A = (1,2) and B = (- 3,5), then 
A + B = ( - 2, 7). 

[XV, §I] 
DEFINITION OF POINTS IN SPACE 
527 
In 3-space, if A = (-I, n, 3) and B = (j2, 7, - 2), then 
A + B = (j2 - I, n + 7, 1). 
Using a neutral n to cover both the cases of 2-space and 3-space, the 
points would be written 
and we define A + B to be the point whose coordinates are 
We observe that the following rules are satisfied: 
1. 
(A + B) + C = A + (B + C). 
2. 
A + B = B + A. 
3. If we let 
o = (0, 0, ... ,0) 
be the point all of whose coordinates are 0, then 
O+A=A+O=A 
for all A. 
4. 
Let A = (a1,···,a.) and let -A =(-a1, ... ,-an). Then 
A + (-A) = O. 
All these properties are very simple, and are true because they are 
true for numbers, and addition of n-tuples is defined in terms of addition 
of their components, which are numbers. 
Note. Do not confuse the number ° and the n-tuple (0, ... ,0). We 
usually denote this n-tuple by 0, and also call it zero, because no diffi-
culty can occur in practice. 
We shall now interpret addition and multiplication by numbers geo-
metrically in the plane (you can visualize simultaneously what happens 
in 3-space). 
Example 3. Let A = (2, 3) and B = (-1,1). Then 
A + B = (1,4).

Example 4. Let A = (3, 1) and B = (1,2). Then 
A + B = (4, 3). 
[XV, §1] 
We see again that the geometric representation of our addition looks like 
a parallelogram (Fig. 4). 
A+B 
Figure 4 
The reason why the figure looks like a parallelogram can be given in 
terms of plane geometry as follows. We obtain B = (1, 2) by starting 
from the origin 0 = (0,0), and moving 1 unit to the right and 2 up. To 
get A + B, we start from A, and again move 1 unit to the right and 2 
up. Thus the line segments between 0 and B, and between A and A + B 
are the hypotenuses of right triangles whose corresponding legs are of 
the same length, and parallel. The above segments are therefore parallel 
and of the same length, as illustrated in Fig. 5.

Example 5. If A = (3,1) again, then -A = (-3, -1). If we plot this 
point, we see that - A has opposite direction to A. We may view - A 
as the reflection of A through the origin.

Figure 6 
We shall now consider multiplication of A by a number. If c is any 
number, we define cA to be the point whose coordinates are 
Example 6. If A = (2, -1,5) and c = 7, then cA = (14, - 7, 35). 
It is easy to verify the rules: 
5. 
c(A + B) = cA + cB. 
6. If c1, C2 are numbers, then 
and 
Also note that 
(-I)A = -A. 
What is the geometric representation of multiplication by a number? 
Example 7. Let A = (1,2) and c = 3. Then 
cA = (3,6) 
as in Fig. 7(a). 
Multiplication by 3 amounts to stretching A by 3. Similarly, iA 
amounts to stretching A by t, i.e. shrinking A to half its size. In general, 
if t is a number, t > 0, we interpret tA as a point in the same direction 
as A from the origin, but t times the distance. In fact, we define A and 

530 
VECTORS 
[XV, §1] 
B to have the same direction if there exists a number c > 0 such that 
A = cB. We emphasize that this means A and B have the same direction 
with respect to the origin. For simplicity of language, we omit the words 
"with respect to the origin". 
Mulitiplication by a negative number reverses the direction. Thus 
-3A would be represented as in Fig. 7(b). 
3A = (3,6)

We define two vectors A, B (neither of which is zero) to have opposite 
directions if there is a number c < 0 such that cA = B. Thus when 
B = - A, then A, B have opposite direction.

We define a located vector to be an ordered pair of points which we 
write AB. (This is not a product.) We visualize this as an arrow be-
tween A and B. We call A the beginning point and B the end point of 
the located vector (Fig. 9).

This means that 
B = A + (B - A) 
Let AB and CiS be two located vectors. We shall say that they are 
equivalent if B -
A = D - C. Every located vector AB is equivalent to 
one whose beginning point is the origin, because AB is equivalent to 
O(B -
A)~ Clearly this is the only located vector whose beginning point 
is the origin and which is equivalent to Ali. If you visualize the parello-
gram law in the plane, then it is clear that equivalence of two located 
vectors can be interpreted geometrically by saying that the lengths of the 
line segments determined by the pair of points are equal, and that the 
"directions" in which they point are the same. 
In the next figures, we have drawn the located vectors O(B - A) , 
AB, and O(A - B) , SA.

Example 1. Let P = (1, -1,3) and Q = (2,4,1). Then PQ is equiva-
lent to DC, where C = Q - P = (1, 5, -2). If 
A = (4, -2,5) 
and 
B = (5,3,3), 
then PQ is equivalent to AB because 
Q - P = B - A = (1, 5, -2). 
Given a located vector DC whose beginning point is the origin, we 
shall say that it is located at the origin. Given any located vector AB, 
we shall say that it is located at A. 
A located vector at the origin is entirely determined by its end point. 
In view of this, we shall call an n-tuple either a point or a vector, de-
pending on the interpretation which we have in mind. 
Two located vectors AB and PQ are said to be parallel if there is a 
number c -=f. 0 such that B -
A = c(Q - P). They are said to have the 

[XV, §2] 
LOCATED VECTORS

same direction if there is a number c > 0 such that B - A = c(Q - P), 
and have opposite direction if there is a number c < 0 such that 
B -
A = c( Q - P). 
In the next pictures, we illustrate parallel located vectors.

A = (5, 1) 
and 
B = (-16, -14). 
Then 
Q - P = ( - 7, - 5) 
and 
B-A=(-21,-15). 
Hence PQ is parallel to Aii, because B -
A = 3( Q - P). Since 3 > 0, 
we even see that PQ and Aii have the same direction. 
In a similar manner, any definition made concerning n-tuples can be 
carried over to located vectors. For instance, in the next section, we 
shall define what it means for n-tuples to be perpendicular.

XV, §3. SCALAR PRODUCT 
It is understood that throughout a discussion we select vectors always in 
the same n-dimensional space. You may think of the cases n = 2 and 
n = 3 only. 
In 2-space, let A = (ai' a2) and B = (b l , b2). We define their scalar 
product to be 
In 3-space, let A = (ai' a2 , a3) and B = (b l , b2 , b3 ). We define their 
scalar product to be 
In n-space, covering both cases with one notation, let A = (a l , ... ,an) 
and B = (b l , ... ,bn) be two vectors. We define their scalar or dot product 
A·B to be 

[XV, §3] 
SCALAR PRODUCT 
535 
This product is a number. For instance, if 
A = (1, 3, -2) 
and 
B = (-1,4, - 3), 
then 
A· B = - 1 + 12 + 6 = 17. 
For the moment, we do not give a geometric interpretation to this scalar 
product. We shall do this later. We derive first some important proper-
ties. The basic ones are: 
SP 1. We have A·B = B·A. 
SP 2. If A, B, C are three vectors, then 
A-(B + C) = A-B + A·C = (B + C)·A. 
SP 3. If x is a number, then 
(xA)· B = x(A- B) 
and 
A· (xB) = x(A- B). 
SP 4. If A = 0 is the zero vector, then A· A = 0, and otherwise 
A·A >0. 
We shall now prove these properties. 
Concerning the first, we have 
because for any two numbers a, b, we have ab = ba. This proves the 
first property. 
For SP 2, let C = (c l , ... ,cn) . Then 
B + C = (b l + c l ,··· ,bn + en) 
and 
Reordering the terms yields 

536 
VECTORS 
[XV, §3] 
which is none other than A· B + A . C. This proves what we wanted. 
We leave property SP 3 as an exercise. 
Finally, for SP 4, we observe that if one coordinate ai of A is not 
equal to 0, then there is a term af =F ° and af > ° 
in the scalar product 
A . A = ai + ... + a;. 
Since every term is 
~ 0, it follows that the sum is > 0, as was to be 
shown. 
In much of the work which we shall do concerning vectors, we shall 
use only the ordinary properties of addition, multiplication by numbers, 
and the four properties of the scalar product. We shall give a formal 
discussion of these later. For the moment, observe that there are other 
objects with which you are familiar and which can be added, subtracted, 
and multiplied by numbers, for instance the continuous functions on an 
interval [a, b] (cf. Exercise 6). 
Instead of writing A· A for the scalar product of a vector with itself, it 
will be convenient to write also A2. (This is the only instance when we 
allow ourselves such a notation. Thus A3 has no meaning.) As an exer-
cise, verify the following identities: 
A dot product A· B may very well be equal to ° without either A or 
B being the zero vector. For instance, let 
A = (1, 2, 3) 
and 
B = (2,1, -1). 
Then 
A·B =0 
We define two vectors A, B to be perpendicular (or as we shall also 
say, orthogonal), if A· B = 0. For the moment, it is not clear that in the 
plane, this definition coincides with our intuitive geometric notion of 
perpendicularity. We shall convince you that it does in the next section. 
Here we merely note an example. Say in R 3, let 
E1 = (1,0,0), 
E2 = (0, 1,0), 
E3 = (0,0, I) 
be the three unit vectors, as shown on the diagram (Fig. 14).

Then we see that EI · E2 = 0, and similarly E;· Ej = ° if i # j. And 
these vectors look perpendicular. If A = (aI, a2' a3), then we observe that 
the i-th component of A, namely 
is the dot product of A with the i-th unit vector. We see that A is 
perpendicular to E; (according to our definition of perpendicularity with 
the dot product) if and only if its i-th component is equal to 0.

XV, §4. THE NORM OF A VECTOR 
We define the norm of a vector A, and denote by IIAII, the number 
IIAII =J4-A. 

538 
VECTORS 
[XV, §4] 
Since A· A ~ 0, we can take the square root. The norm is also some-
times called the ma~nitude of A. 
When n = 2 and A = (a, b), then 
as in the following picture (Fig. 15).

Example 1. If A = (1,2), then 
II A II = Ji+4 = .j5. 
IIAII = Jai + a~ + a~. 
Example 2. If A = (-1,2,3), then 
II A II = J 1 + 4 + 9 = Jl4. 
If n = 3, then the picture looks like Fig. 16, with A = (x, y, z).

THE NORM OF A VECTOR 
539 
If we first look at the two components (x, y), then the length of the 
segment between (0,0) and (x, y) is equal to w = Jx 2 + y2, as indicated. 
Then again the norm of A by the Pythagoras theorem would be 
Thus when n = 3, our definition of norm is compatible with the geom-
etry of the Pythagoras theorem. 
In terms of coordinates, A = (a l , . .. ,an) we see that 
IIAII = J ai + ... + a;. 
If A =F 0 , then IIAII =F ° because some coordinate aj =F 0, so that af > 0, 
and hence ai + .. . + a; > 0, so HAil =F 0. 
Observe that for any vector A we have 
IIAII = II-All· 
This is due to the fact that 
because ( _1)2 = 1. Of course, this is as it should be from the picture: 
A 
-A 
Figure 17 
Recall that A and - A are said to have opposite direction. However, 
they have the same norm (magnitude, as is sometimes said when speak-
ing of vectors). 
Let A, B be two points. We define the distance between A and B to 
be 
IIA - BII = J(A - B)·(A - B). 

540 
VECTORS 
[XV, §4] 
This definition coincides with our geometric intUItIOn when A, Bare 
points in the plane (Fig. 18). It is the same thing as the length of the 
located vector AB or the located vector BA. 
B 
Length = IIA-BII = liB-Ali 
Figure 18 
Example 3. Let A = ( - l, 2) and B = (3,4). Then the length of the 
located vector AB is liB - All. But B - A = (4,2). Thus 
liB - All = Ji6+4 = fiO· 
In the picture, we see that the horizontal side has length 4 and the 
vertical side has length 2. Thus our definitions reflect our geometric 
intuition derived from Pythagoras.

The sphere is the outer shell, and the ball consists of the region inside 
the shell. The open ball consists of the region inside the shell excluding 
the shell itself. The closed ball consists of the region inside the shell and 
the shell itself. 
From the geometry of the situation, it is also reasonable to expect 
that if e > 0, then ileA II = eiIAII, i.e. if we stretch a vector A by multiply-
ing by a positive number e, then the length stretches also by that 
amount. We verify this formally using our definition of the length. 
Theorem 4.1 Let x be a number. Then 
IlxA11 = Ixl IIAII 
(absolute value of x times the norm of A). 
Proof By definition, we have 
IIxAII2 = (xA)·(xA), 
which is equal to 
by the properties of the scalar product. Taking the square root now 
yields what we want. 
Let SI be the sphere of radius 1, centered at the origin. Let a be a 
number > o. If X is a point of the sphere S l' then aX is a point of the 
sphere of radius a, because 
IlaXIl = allXIl = a. 
In this manner, we get all points of the sphere of radius a. (Proof?) 
Thus the sphere of radius a is obtained by stretching the sphere of radius 
1, through multiplication by a. 
A similar remark applies to the open and closed balls of radius a, 
they being obtained from the open and closed balls of radius 1 through 
multiplication by a.

If E is the unit vector in the direction of A, and IIAII = a, then

E3 = (0,0,1) 
are merely the three unit vectors in the directions of the coordinate axes.

To prove this, we use the definitions, namely 
IIA + BII2 =(A + B)·(A + B) = A2 + 2A·B + B2 
= IIAI12 + IIB112, 
because A· B = 0, and A· A = IIA112, B· B = IIBI12 by definition. 
545 
Remark. If A is perpendicular to B, and x is any number, then A is 
also perpendicular to xB because 
A . xB = xA . B = 0. 
We shall now use the notion of perpendicularity to derive the notion 
of projection. Let A, B be two vectors and B # O. Let P be the point 
on the line through DB such that PA is perpendicular to DB, as 
shown on Fig. 26(a).

Conversely, if we take this value for c, and then use distributivity, dot-
ting A - cB with B yields 0, so that A - cB is perpendicular to B. 
Hence we have seen that there is a unique number c such that A - cB is 
perpendicular to B, and c is given by the above formula.

components. 
If A = (a l , •• • ,an), then A · Ej = aj • 
Thus A · Ej is the ordinary i-th component of A. 
More generally, if B is a unit vector, not necessarily one of the Ej , then 
we have simply 
c = A · B 
because B· B = 1 by definition of a unit vector.

In some treatments of vectors, one takes the relation

as definition of the scalar product. This is subject to the following disad-
vantages, not to say objections: 
(a) 
The four properties of the scalar product SP 1 through SP 4 are 
then by no means obvious. 
(b) 
Even in 3-space, one has to rely on geometric intuition to obtain 
the cosine of the angle between A and B, and this intuition is 
less clear than in the plane. In higher dimensional space, it fails 
even more. 
(c) 
It is extremely hard to work with such a definition to obtain 
further properties of the scalar product. 
Thus we prefer to lay obvious algebraic foundations, and then recover 
very simply all the properties. We used plane geometry to see the ex-
pressIOn 
A- B = IIA IIIIBIl cos e. 
After working out some examples, we shall prove the inequality which 
allows us to justify this in n-space.

We shall prove further properties of the norm and scalar product 
using our results on perpendicularity. First note a special case. If 
Ei = (0, ... ,0, 1,0, ... ,0) 
is the i-th unit vector of Rn, and 
A = (a l , ... ,an), 
then 
A·Ei = ai 
is the i-th component of A, i.e. the component of A along Ei . We have 
lad = P ~ Jai + ... + a; = IIAII, 
so that the absolute value of each component of A is at most equal to 
the length of A. 
We don't have to deal only with the special unit vector as above. Let 
E be any unit vector, that is a vector of norm 1. Let c be the compon-
ent of A along E. We saw that 
c = A·E. 

[XV, §4] 
THE NORM OF A VECTOR 
549 
Then A - cE is perpendicular to E, and 
A = A - cE + cEo 
Then A - cE is also perpendicular to cE, and by the Pythagoras 
theorem, we find 
Thus we have the inequality c2 ~ IIAII2, and lei ~ IIAII. 
In the next theorem, we generalize this inequality to a dot product 
A . B when B is not necessarily a unit vector. 
Theorem 4.2. Let A, B be two vectors in Rn. Then 
IA ·BI ~ IIAII IIBII. 
Proof If B = 0, then both sides of the inequality are equal to 0, and 
so our assertion is obvious. Suppose that B oF o. Let c be the compon-
ent of A along B, so c = (A· B)/(B· B). We write 
A = A - cB + cB. 
By Pythagoras, 
Hence c211BI12 ~ IIAI12. But

and there exists a unique angle e such that 0 ~ e ~ n, and such that 
A·B 
cos e = IIAII IIBII 
We define this angle to be the angle between A and B. 
The inequality of Theorem 4.2 is known as the Schwarz inequality. 
Theorem 4.3. Let A, B be vectors. Then 
IIA + BII ~ IIAII + IIBII· 
Proof Both sides of this inequality are positive or O. Hence it will 
suffice to prove that their squares satisfy the desired inequality, in other 
words, 
(A + B)· (A + B) ~ (IIAII + IIBII)2. 
To do this, we consider 
(A + B)·(A + B) = A·A + 2A·B + B·B. 
In view of our previous result, this satisfies the inequality 
and the right-hand side is none other than 
Our theorem is proved. 
Theorem 4.3 is known as the triangle inequality. The reason for this is 
that if we draw a triangle as in Fig. 29, then Theorem 4.3 expresses the 
fact that the length of one side is ~ the sum of the lengths of the other 
two sides.

THE NORM OF A VECTOR 
551 
Remark. All the proofs do not use coordinates, only properties SP 1 
through SP 4 of the dot product. In n-space, they give us inequalities 
which are by no means obvious when expressed in terms of coordinates. 
For instance, the Schwarz inequality reads, in terms of coordinates: 
Just try to prove this directly, without the "geometric" intuition of Pyth-
agoras, and see how far you get.

10. Let A, B, C be three non-zero vectors. If A· B = A . C, show by an

XV, §5. PARAMETRIC LINES 
We define the parametric equation or parametric representation of a 
straight line passing through a point P in the direction of a vector 
A =P 0 to be 
x = P + tA, 
where t runs through all numbers (Fig. 30). 
Figure 30 
When we give such a parametric representation, we may think of a 
bug starting from a point P at time t = 0, and moving in the direction of 
A. At time t, the bug is at the position P + tAo Thus we may interpret 
physically the parametric representation as a description of motion, in 
which A is interpreted as the velocity of the bug. At a given time t, the 
bug is at the point. 
X(t) = P + tA, 
which is called the position of the bug at time t. 
This parametric representation is also useful to describe the set of 
points lying on the line segment between two given points. Let P, Q be 
two points. Then the segment between P and Q consists of all the points 
S(t) = P + t(Q - P) 
with 
O~t~l. 
Indeed, O(Q - P) is a vector having the same direction as PQ, as 
shown on Fig. 31. 

[XV, §5] 
PARAMETRIC LINES 
553 
Q-P 
Figure 31 
When t = 0, we have S(O) = P, so at time t = 0 the bug is at P. When 
t = 1, we have 
S(1) = P + (Q - P) = Q, 
so when t = 1 the bug is at Q. As t goes from 0 to 1, the bug goes from 
P to Q. 
Example 1. Let P = (1, - 3,4) and Q = (5, 1, - 2). Find the coordi-
nates of the point which lies one third of the distance from P to Q. 
Let S(t) as above be the parametric representation of the segment 
from P to Q. The desired point is S(1 /3), that is: 
(1) 
1

S 3 =P+ 3 (Q-P)=(1,-3,4)+3(4,4,-6) 
( 7 -5 ) 
= 3'3,2 . 
Warning. The desired point in the above example is not given by 
P+Q 
3 
Example 2. Find a parametric representation for the line passing 
through the two points P = (1, - 3, 1) and Q = ( - 2, 4, 5). 
We first have to find a vector in the direction of the line. We let 
A = P - Q, 
so 
A = (3, -7, -4). 

554 
VECTORS 
[XV, §5] 
The parametric representation of the line is therefore 
X(t) = P + tA = (1, -3,1) + t(3, -7, -4). 
Remark. It would be equally correct to give a parametric representa-
tion of the line as 
Y(t) = P + tB 
where 
B = Q - P. 
Interpreted in tenns of the moving bug, however, one parametrization 
gives the position of a bug moving in one direction along the line, start-
ing from P at time t = 0, while the other parametrization gives the posi-
tion of another bug moving in the opposite direction along the line, also 
starting from P at time t = 0. 
We shall now discuss the relation between a parametric representation 
and the ordinary equation of a line in the plane. 
Suppose that we work in the plane, and write the coordinates of a 
point X as (x, y). Let P = (p, q) and A = (a, b). Then in terms of the 
coordinates, we can write 
x = p + ta, 
y = q + tb. 
We can then eliminate t and obtain the usual equation relating x and y. 
Example 3. Let P = (2,1) and A = (-1,5). Then the parametric 
representation of the line through P in the direction of A gives us 
x = 2 - t, 
y = 1 + 5t. 
Multiplying the first equation by 5 and adding yields 
(**) 
5x + y = 11, 
which is the familiar equation of a line. 
This elimination of t shows that every pair (x, y) which satisfies the 
parametric representation (*) for some value of t also satisfies equation 
(**). Conversely, suppose we have a pair of numbers (x, y) satisfying 
(**). Let t = 2 - x. Then 
y = 11 - 5x = 11 - 5(2 - t) = 1 + 5t. 

[XV, §5] 
PARAMETRIC LINES 
555 
Hence there exists some value of t which satisfies equation (*). Thus we 
have proved that the pairs (x, y) which are solutions of (**) are exactly 
the same pairs of numbers as those obtained by giving arbitrary values 
for t in (*). Thus the straight line can be described parametrically as in 
(*) or in terms of its usual equation (**). Starting with the ordinary 
equation 
5x + y = 11, 
we let t = 2 - x in order to recover the specific parametrization of (*). 
When we parametrize a straight line in the form 
x = P + tA, 
we have of course infinitely many choices for P on the line, and also 
infinitely many choices for A, differing by a scalar multiple. We can 
always select at least one. Namely, given an equation 
ax + by = c 
with numbers a, b, c, suppose that a =F O. We use y as parameter, and 
let 
y = t. 
Then we can solve for x, namely 
c 
b 
x = - -
- t. 
a 
a 
Let P = (cia, 0) and A = ( - bla, 1). We see that an arbitrary point (x, y) 
satisfying the equation 
ax + by = c 
can be expressed parametrically, namely 
(x, y) = P + tAo 
In higher dimensions, starting with a parametric representation 
x = P + tA, 
we cannot eliminate t, and thus the parametric representation is the only 
one available to describe a straight line.

XV, §6. PLANES 
We can describe planes in 3-space by an equation analogous to the 
single equation of the line. We proceed as follows. 
z 
N 
~~~-------------y 
x 
Figure 32 
Let P be a point in 3-space and consider a located vector ON. We 
define the plane passing through P perpendicular to ON to be the col-
lection of all points X such that the located vector fiX is perpendicular 
--> 
to ON. According to our definitions, this amounts to the condition 
(X - P)·N = 0, 

[XV, §6] 
PLANES 
557 
which can also be written as 
X · N = P·N. 
We shall also say that this plane is the one perpendicular to N, and 
consists of all vectors X such that X - P is perpendicular to N. We 
have drawn a typical situation in 3-spaces in Fig. 32. 
Instead of saying that N is perpendicular to the plane, one also says 
that N is normal to the plane. 
Let t be a number =1= O. Then the set points X such that 
(X - P) · N = 0 
coincides with the set of points X such that 
(X - P) . tN = O. 
Thus we may say that our plane is the plane passing through P and 
perpendicular to the line in the direction of N. To find the equation of 
the plane, we could use any vector tN (with t =1= 0) instead of N. 
Example 1. Let 
P = (2, 1, -1) 
and 
N = (-1,1,3). 
Let X = (x, y, z). Then 
X· N = ( - l)x + y + 3z. 
Therefore the equation of the plane passing through P and perpendicular 
to N is 
-x + y + 3z = -2 + 1 - 3 
or 
-x + y + 3z = -4. 
Observe that in 2-space, with X = (x, y), the formulas lead to the 
equation of the line in the ordinary sense. 
Example 2. The equation of the line in the (x, y)-plane, passing 
through (4, - 3) and perpendicular to (- 5, 2) is 
-5x + 2y = -20 - 6 = -26. 

558 
VECTORS 
[XV, §6] 
We are now in position to interpret the coefficients ( - 5,2) of x and y 
in this equation. They give rise to a vector perpendicular to the line. In 
any equation 
ax + by = c 
the vector (a, b) is perpendicular to the line determined by the equation. 
Similarly, in 3-space, the vector (a, b, c) is perpendicular to the plane 
determined by the equation 
ax + by + cz = d. 
Example 3. The plane determined by the equation 
2x - y + 3z = 5 
is perpendicular to the vector (2, -1,3). If we want to find a point in 
that plane, we of course have many choices. We can give arbitrary val-
ues to x and y, and then solve for z. To get a concrete point, let x = I, 
y = l. Then we solve for z, namely 
3z = 5 - 2 + I = 4, 
so that z = 1. Thus 
(1,1,1) 
is a point in the plane. 
In n-space, the equation X· N = p. N is said to be the equation of a 
hyperplane. For example, 
3x - y + z + 2w = 5 
is the equation of a hyperplane in 4-space, perpendicular to (3, -I, 1,2). 
Two vectors A, B are said to be parallel if there exists a number c :I 0 
such that cA = B. Two lines are said to be parallel if, given two distinct 
points PI' QI on the first line and P 2, Q2 on the second, the vectors 
and 
are parallel. 
Two planes are said to be parallel (in 3-space) if their normal vectors 
are parallel. They are said to be perpendicular if their normal vectors are 
perpendicular. The angle between two planes is defined to be the angle 
between their normal vectors.

Example 4. Find the cosine of the angle () between the planes. 
2x -
y + z = 0,

This cosine is the cosine of the angle between the vectors.

Find the point of intersection of the line through P in the direction of N, 
and the plane through Q perpendicular to N. 
The parametric representation of the line through P in the direction of 
N is 
(1) 
x = P + tN. 
The equation of the plane through Q perpendicular to N is 
(2) 
(X - Q). N = 0. 
We visualize the line and plane as follows:

We must find the value of t such that the vector X in (I) also satisfies 
(2), that is 
(P + tN - Q). N = 0,

(P - Q)·N + tN·N = O. 
Solving for t yields 
(Q - P)· N

Example 6. Find the equation of the plane passing through the three 
points 
PI = (1, 2, - 1). 
P2 = (-1,1,4), 
P3 = (1, 3, -2). 
We visualize schematically the three points as follows:

words, perpendicular to P 2 -
PI and P 3 -
Pl. We have 
P 2 -
PI = ( - 2, - I, + 5), 
P 3 -

c = 0. 
We take b = c = 1 and solve for a = 2. Then 
N=(2, 1,1)

satisfies our requirements. 
The plane perpendicular to N, passing 
through P 1 is the desired plane. Its equation is therefore X· N = Pl · N, 
that is 
2x + y + z = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3. 
Distance between a point and a plane. Consider a plane defined by the 
equation 
(X - P)·N = 0, 
and let Q be an arbitrary point. We wish to find a formula for the 
distance between Q and the plane. By this we mean the length of the 
segment from Q to the point of intersection of the perpendicular line to 
the plane through Q, as on the figure. We let Q' be this point of inter-
section. 
Q

From the geometry, we have: 
length of the segment QQ' = length of the projection of QP on QQ'. 

562 
VECTORS 
[XV, §6] 
We can express the length of this projection in terms of the dot product 
as follows. A unit vector in the direction of N, which is perpendicular to 
the plane, is given by NIIINII. Then 
length of the projection of QP on QQ' 
= norm of the projection of Q - P on N III N II 
= I(Q - p)·IIZIII· 
This can also be written in the form: 
I(Q - P)·NI 
distance between Q and the plane =

Example 7. Let 
Q = (1, 3, 5), 
P = (-1,1,7) 
and 
N = ( -1, 1, -1). 
The equation of the plane is 
-x + y - z = -5. 
We find IINII = fl, 
Q - P = (2,2, -2) 
and 
(Q - P) . N = - 2 + 2 + 2 = 2. 
Hence the distance between Q and the plane is 21 fl.

CHAPTER

Differentiation of Vectors 
XVI, §1. DERIVATIVE 
Consider a bug moving along some curve in 3-dimensional space. The 
position of the bug at time t is given by the three coordinates 
(x(t), y(t), z(t», 
which depend on t. We abbreviate these by X(t). For instance, the 
position of a bug moving along a straight line was seen in the preceding 
chapter to be given by 
X(t) = P + tA, 
where P is the starting point, and A gives the direction of the bug. 
However, we can give examples when the bug does not move on a 
straight line. First we look at an example in the plane. 
Example 1. Let X(8) = (cos 8, sin 8). Then the bug moves around a 
circle of radius 1 in counterclockwise direction. 
(<'os 8, sin 8) 
___ -r--.... 
Figure 1

DIFFERENTIATION OF VECTORS 
[XVI, §I] 
Here we used () as the variable, corresponding to the angle as shown on 
the figure. Let w be the angular speed of the bug, and assume w con-
stant. Thus d(}/dt = wand 
() = wt + a constant. 
For simplicity, assume that the constant is O. Then we can write the 
position of the bug as 
X«(}) = X(wt) = (cos wt, sin wt). 
If the angular speed is I, then we have simply the representation 
X(t) = (cos t, sin t). 
Example 2. If the bug moves around a circle of radius 2 with angular 
speed equal to 1, then its position at time t is given by 
X(t) = (2 cos t, 2 sin t). 
More generally, if the bug moves around a circle of radius r, then the 
position is given by 
X(t) = (r cos t, r sin t). 
In these examples, we assume of course that at time t = 0 the bug starts 
at the point (r, 0), that is 
X(O) = (r, 0), 
where r is the radius of the circle. 
Example 3. Suppose the position of the bug is given in 3-space by 
X(t) = (cos t, sin t, t). 
Then the bug moves along a spiral. Its coordinates are given as func-
tions of t by 
x(t) = cos t, 
y(t) = sin t, 
z(t) = t. 
The position at time t is obtained by plugging 
in the special value of t. Thus: 
X(n) = (cos n, sin n, n) = (-1,0, n) 
X(1) = (cos 1, sin 1, 1). 
We may now give the definition of a curve in 
general.

Definition. Let J be an interval. A parametrized curve (defined on this 
interval) is an association which to each point of J associates a vector. If 
X denotes a curve defined on J, and t is a point of J, then X(t) denotes 
the vector associated to t by X. We often write the association t H X(t) 
as an arrow 
X: J -+ R". 
We also call this association the parametrization of a curve. We call X(t) 
the position vector at time t. It can be written in terms of coordinates, 
X(t) = (xt(t), ... ,x"(t», 
each Xi(t) being a function of t. We say that this curve is differentiable if 
each function Xi(t) is a differentiable function of t. 
Remark. We take the intervals of definition for our curves to be 
open, closed, or also half-open or half-closed. When we define the deri-
vative of a curve, it is understood that the interval of definition contains 
more than one point. In that case, at an end point the usual limit of 
f(a + h) - f(a) 
h 
is taken for those h such that the quotient makes sense, i.e. a + h lies in 
the interval. If a is a left end point, the quotient is considered only for 
h > O. If a is a right end point the quotient is considered only for 
h < O. Then the usual rules for differentiation of functions are true in this 
greater generality, and thus Rules 1 through 4 below, and the chain rule 
of §2 remain true also. [An example of a statement which is not always 
true for curves defined over closed intervals is given in Exercise 11(b).1 
Let us try to differentiate curves. We consider the Newton quotient 
X(t + h) - X(t) 
h 
Its numerator is illustrated in Fig. 3.

As h approaches 0, we see geometrically that 
X(t + h) - X(t) 
h 
[XVI, §1] 
should approach a vector pointing in the direction of the curve. We can 
write the Newton quotient in terms of coordinates,

tive dX /dt to be

Physicists often denote dX/dt by X; thus in the previous example, we 
could also write 
X(t) = (-sin t, cos t, 1) = X'(t). 
We define the velocity vector of the curve at time t to be the' vector 
X'(t). 
Example 5. When X(t) = (cos t, sin t, t), then 
X'(t) = ( - sin t, cos t, 1); 
the velocity vector at t = n is 
X'(n) = (0, -1, 1), 
and for t = n/4 we get 
X'(n/4) = (-1 /.j2, 1/.j2, 1). 
The velocity vector is located at the origin, but when we translate it 
to the point X(t), then we visualize it as tangent to the curve, as in the 
next figure. 
X (t)+X'(t) 
Figure 4 
We define the tangent line to a curve X at time t to be the line 
passing through X(t) in the direction of X'(t), provided that X'(t) =f. O. 
Otherwise, we don't define a tangent line. We have therefore given two 
interpretations for X'(t): 
X'(t) is the velocity at time t; 
X '(t) is parallel to a tangent vector at time t.

By abuse of language, we sometimes call X'(t) a tangent vector, although 
I 
strictly speaking, we should refer to the located vector X(t)(X(t) + X'(t» 
as the tangent vector. However, to write down this located vector each 
time is cumbersome.

We define the speed of the curve X(t) to be the norm of the velocity 
vector. If we denote the speed by v(t), then by definition we have 
v(t) = IIX'(t)lI, 
and thus 
V(t)2 = X'(t)2 = X'(t) . X'(t). 
We can also omit the t from the notation, and write 
Example 8. The speed of the bug moving on the circle 
X(t) = (cos t, sin t) 
is the norm of the velocity X'(t) = (-sin t, cos t), and so is 
v(t) = J( -sin t)2 + (cos2 t) = 1.

[XVI, §I] 
Example 9. The speed of the bug moving on the spiral 
X(t) = (cos t, sin t, t) 
is the norm of the velocity X'(t) = (-sin t, cos t, I), and so is 
v(t) = J( -sin t)2 + (cos2 t) + 1 
=j2. 
We define the acceleration vector to be the derivative 
dX'(t) = X"(t) 
dt 
' 
provided of course that X' is differentiable. We shall also denote the 
acceleration vector by X"(t) as above. 
We shall now discuss acceleration. There are two possible definitions 
for a scalar acceleration: 
First there is the rate of change of the speed, that is 
dv 
'( ) 
dt = v t. 
Second, there is the norm of the acceleration vector, that is 
IIX"(t)lI· 
Warning. These two are usually not equal. Almost any example will 
show this. 
Example 10. Let 
X(t) = (cos t, sin t). 
Then: 
v(t) = 1IX'(t)1I = 1 
X"(t) = (-cos t, -sin t) 
so 
so 
dv/dt = O. 
IIX"(t)1I = 1. 
Thus if and when we need to refer to scalar acceleration, we must always 
say which one we mean. One could use the notation a(t) for scalar 
acceleration, but one must specify which of the two possibilities a(t) de-
notes. 
The fact that the above two quantities are not equal reflects the physi-
cal interpretation. A bug moving around a circle at uniform speed has 

[XVI, §l]

573 
dv/dt = O. However, the acceleration vector is not 0, because the velocity 
vector is constantly changing. Hence the norm of the acceleration vector 
is not equal to O. 
We shall list the rules for differentiation. These will concern sums, 
products, and the chain rule which is postponed to the next section. 
The derivative of a curve is defined componentwise. Thus the rules 
for the derivative will be very similar to the rules for differentiating func-
tions. 
Rule 1. Let X(t) and Y(t) be two differentiable curves (defined for the 
same values of t). Then the sum X(t) + Y(t) is differentiable, and 
d(X(t) + Y(t)) 
dX 
dY 
--d-t-- = -d-t + -dt . 
Rule 2. Let c be a number, and let X(t) be differentiable. Then cX(t) is 
differentiable, and 
d(cX(t)) 
dX 
dt 
= c Tt· 
Rule 3. Let X(t) and Y(t) be two differentiable curves (defined for the 
same values of t). 
Then X(t)· Y(t) is a differentiable function whose 
derivative is 
d 
-
[X(t)· Y(t)] = X(t)· Y'(t) + X'(t)· Y(t). 
dt 
(This is formally analogous to the derivative of a product of functions, 
namely the first times the derivative of the second plus the second times 
the derivative of the first, except that the product is now a scalar pro-
duct.) 
As an example of the proofs we shall give the third one in detail, and 
leave the others to you as exercises. 
Let for simplicity

Y(t) = (Yl(t), yit)).

The proof for 3-space or n-space is obtained by replacing 2 by 3 or n, 
and inserting ... in the middle to take into account the other coordinates. 
Example 11. The square X(t)2 = X(t)· X(t) comes up frequently in 
applications, for instance because it can be interpreted as the square of 
the distance of X(t) from the origin. Using the rule for the derivative of 
a product, we find the formula 
~ X(t)2 = 2X(t)· X'(t). 
dt 
You should memorize this formula by repeating it out loud. 
Suppose that IIX(t)11 is constant. This means that X(t) lies on a 
sphere of constant radius k. Taking the square yields 
X(t)2 = k2 
that is, X(t)2 is also constant. Differentiate both sides with respect to t. 
Then we obtain 
2X(t)· X(t) = 0 
and therefore 
X(t) . X'(t) = 0 
Interpretation. Suppose a bug moves along a curve X(t) which remains 
at constant distance from the origin, i.e. IIX(t)11 = k is constant. Then 
the position vector X(t) is perpendicular to the velocity X'(t).

Curve on a sphere 
If X(t) is a curve and f(t) is a function, defined for the same values of 
t, then we may also form the product f(t)X(t) of the number f(t) by the 
vector X(t). 
Example 12. Let X(t) = (cos t, sin t, t) and f(t) = el, then 
{(t)X(t) = (el cos t, el sin t, elt), 
and 
f(n)X(n) = (e"( -1), e"(O), e"n) = (-e", 0, e"n).

575 
If X(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t», then 
f(t)X(t) = (f(t)x(t), f(t)y(t), f(t)z(t». 
We have a rule for such differentiation analogous to Rule 3. 
Rule 4. If both f(t) and X(t) are defined over the same interval, and 
are differentiable, then so is f(t)X(t), and 
d 
dt f(t)X(t) = f(t)X(t) + f'(t)X(t). 
The proof is just the same as for Rule 3. 
Example 13. Let A be a fixed vector, and let f be an ordinary differ-
entiable function of one variable. Let F(t) = f(t)A. Then F'(t) = f'(t)A. 
For instance, if F(t) = (cos t)A and A = (a, b) where a, b are fixed 
numbers, then 
F(t) = (a cos t, b cos t) 
and thus 
F'(t) = (-a sin t, - b sin t) = (-sin t)A. 
Similarly, if A, B are fixed vectors, and 
G(t) = (cos t)A + (sin t)B, 
then 
G'(t) = (-sin t)A + (cos t)B.

XVI, §2. LENGTH OF CURVES 
Suppose a bug travels along a curve X(t). The rate of change of the 
distance traveled is equal to the speed, so we may write the equation 
ds(t) = v(t). 
dt 
Consequently it is reasonable to make the following definition. 
We define the length of a curve X between two values a, b of t (a ~ b) 
in the interval of definition of the curve to be the integral of the speed: 
f v(t) dt = f 
11 X'(t) II dt. 
By definition, we can rewrite this integral in the form 
f J(~Y + (tY dt 
when 
X(t) = (x(t), y(t», 
f J(~;Y + (irY + (~;Y dt

In this case, of course, the integral is easy to evaluate. There is no

Example 2. Set up the integral for the length of the curve

between t = 1 and t = n. 
We have X'(t) = (el , cos t, 1). Hence the desired integral is 
I" Je 21 + cos 2 t + 1 dt. 
In this case, there is no easy formula for the integral. In the exercises, 
however, the functions are adjusted in such a way that the integral can 
be evaluated by elementary techniques of integration. Don't expect this 
to be the case in real life, though. The presence of the square root sign 
usually makes it impossible to evaluate the length integral by elementary 
functions.

CHAPTER

Functions of Several 
Variables 
We view functions of several variables as functions of points in space. 
This appeals to our geometric intuition, and also relates such functions 
more easily with the theory of vectors. The gradient will appear as a 
natural generalization of the derivative. In this chapter we are mainly 
concerned with basic definitions and notions. We postpone the impor-
tant theorems to the next chapter. 
XVII, §1. GRAPHS AND LEVEL CURVES 
In order to conform with usual terminology, and for the sake of brevity, 
a collection of objects will simply be called a set. In this chapter, we are 
mostly concerned with sets of points in space. 
Let S be a set of points in n-space. A function (defined on S) is an 
association which to each element of S associates a number. For in-
stance, if to each point we associate the numerical value of the tempera-
ture at that point, we have the temperature function. 
Remark. In the previous chapter, we considered parametrized curves, 
associating a vector to a point. We do not call these functions. Only 
when the values of the association are numbers do we use the word 
function. We find this to be the most useful convention for this course. 
In practice, we sometimes omit mentioning explicitly the set S, since 
the context usually makes it clear for which points the function is de-
fined.

We do not define I at (0, 0) (also written 0). 
Example 3. In 3-space, we can define a function f by the rule 
f(x, y, z) = x 2 -
sin(xyz) + yz3. 
Since a point and a vector are represented by the same thing (namely 
an n-tuple), we can think of a function such as the above also as a 
function of vectors. When we do not want to write the coordinates, we 
write f(X) instead of f(x l' ... ,xn). As with numbers, we call f(X) the 
value of f at the point (or vector) X. 
Just as with functions of one variable, we define the graph of a func-
tion f of n variables x I' ... 'Xn to be the set of points in (n + 1 )-space of 
the form 
(XI'· ·· ,xn,f(x l ,··· ,xn», 
the (Xl' ... ,Xn) being in the domain of definition of f . 
When n = 1, the graph of a function f is a set of points (x, f(x)). 
Thus the graph itself is in 2-space. 
When n = 2, the graph of a function f is the set of points 
(x, y, f(x, y)). 
When n = 2, it is already difficult to draw the graph since it involves a 
figure in 3-space. The graph of a function of two variables may look like 
this:

For each number c, the equation f(x, y) = c is the equation of a curve 
in the plane. We have considerable experience in drawing the graphs of 
such curves, and we may therefore assume that we know how to draw 
this graph in principle. This curve is called the level curve of f at c. It 
gives us the set of points (x, y) where f takes on the value c. By drawing 
a number of such level curves, we can get a good description of the 
function. 
Example 4. Let f(x, y) = x2 + y2. The level curves are described by 
equations 
These have a solution only when c ~ O. In that case, they are circles 
(unless c = 0 in which case the circle of radius 0 is simply the origin). In 
Fig. 2, we have drawn the level curves for c = 1 and 4.

GRAPHS AND LEVEL CURVES

Example 5. Let the elevation of a mountain in meters be given by the 
formula 
We see that f(O, 0) = 4,000 is the highest point of the mountain. As x, y 
increase, the altitude decreases. The mountain and its level curves might 
look like this. 
Figure 4 
In this case, the highest point is at the origin, and the level curves 
indicate decreasing altitude as they move away from the origin. 
If we deal with a function of three variables, say f(x, y, z), then 
(x, y, z) = X is a point in 3-space. In that case, the set of points satisfy-
ing the equation 
f(x, y, z) = c 
for some constant c is a surface. The notion analogous to that of level 
curve is that of level surface. 
Example 6. Let f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + Z2. Then f is the square of the 
distance from the origin. The equation 
is the equation of a sphere for c > 0, and the radius is of course Jc. If 
c = 0 this is the equation of a point, namely the origin itself. If c < ° 
there is no solution. Thus the level surfaces for the function fare 
spheres. 
Example 7. Let f(x, y, z) = 3x 2 + 2y2 + Z2. Then the level surfaces 
for f are defined by the equations 
They have the same shape as ellipses, and called ellipsoids, for c > O. 
It is harder to draw figures in 3 dimensions than in 2 dimensions, so 
we restrict ourselves to drawing level curves.

The graph of a function of three variables is the set of points 
(x, y, z,f(x, y, z» 
in 4-dimensional space. Not only is this graph hard to draw, it is impos-
sible to draw. It is, however, possible to define it as we have done by 
writing down coordinates of points. 
In physics, a function f might be a potential function, giving the value 
of the potential energy at each point of space. The level surfaces are 
then sometimes called surfaces of equipotential. The function f might also 
give a temperature distribution (i.e. its value at a point X is the tempera-
ture at X). In that case, the level surfaces are called isothermal surfaces.

In this section and the next, we discuss the notion of differentiability for 
functions of several variables. When we discussed the derivative of func-
tions of one variable, we assumed that such a function was defined on 
an interval. We shall have to make a similar assumption in the case of 
several variables, and for this we need to introduce a new notion. 
Let U be a set in the plane. We shall say that U is an open set if the 
following condition is satisfied. Given a point P in U, there exists an 
open disc D of radius a > 0 which is centered at P and such that D is 
contained in U. 
Let U be a set in space. We shall say that U is an open set in space 
if given a point P in U, there exists an open ball B of radius a > 0 
which is centered at P and such that B is contained in U. 
A similar definition is given of an open set in n-space. 
Given a point P in an open set, we can go in all directions from P by 
a small distance and still stay within the open set. 

[XVII, §2] 
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES 
587 
Example 1. In the plane, the set consisting of the first quadrant, ex-
cluding the x- and y-axes, is an open set. 
The x-axis is not open in the plane (i.e. in 2-space). Given a point on 
the x-axis, we cannot find an open disc centered at the point and con-
tained in the x-axis. 
Example 2. Let V be the open ball of radius a > 0 centered at the 
origin. Then V is an open set. This is illustrated on Fig. 5. 
Figure 5 
In the next picture we have drawn an open set in the plane, consisting 
of the region inside the curve, but not containing any point of the 
boundary. We have also drawn a point P in V, and a ball (disc) 
around P contained in U. 
Figure 6 
When we defined the derivative as a limit of 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
h 
we needed the function f to be defined in some open interval around the 
point x. 
Now let f be a function of n variables, defined on an open set U. 
Then for any point X in V, the function f is also defined at all points 
which are close to X, namely all points which are contained in an open 
ball centered at X and contained in U. We shall obtain the partial 
derivative of f by keeping all but one variable fixed, and taking the 
ordinary derivative with respect to the one variable. 

588 
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES 
[XVII, §2] 
Let us start with two variables. Given a function f(x, y) of two vari-
ables x, y, let us keep y constant and differentiate with respect to x. We 
are then led to consider the limit as h approaches 0 of 
f(x + h, y) - f(x, y) 
h 
Definition. If this limit exists, we call it the derivative of f with respect 
to the first variable, or also the first partial derivative of j, and denote it 
by 
(Dtf)(x, y). 
This notation allows us to use any letters to denote the variables. For 
instance,

Note that Dtf is a single function. We often omit the parentheses, writ-
109 
DJ(u, v) = (DJ)(u, v) 
for simplicity. 
Also, if the variables x, yare agreed upon, then we write 
of 
DJ(x, y) = ax·

PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

We observe that the partial derivatives are themselves functions. This 
is the reason why the notation DJ is sometimes more useful than the 
notation a flax j • It allows us to write DJ(P) for any point P in the set 
where the partial is defined. There cannot be any ambiguity or confu-
sion with a (meaningless) symbol D j (f(P», since f(P) is a number. Thus 
DJ(P) means (DJ)(P). It is the value of the function DJ at P. 
Example 4. 
Let f(x, y) = sin xy. To find D2 f(1,11:), we first find 
a flay, or Dd(x, y), which is simply 
Dd(x, y) = (cos xy)x. 
Hence 
D2 f(l, 11:) = (cos 11:)·1 = -1. 
Also, 
A similar definition of the partial derivatives is given in 3-space. Let f 
be a function of three variables (x, y, z), defined on an open set V in 
3-space. We define, for instance, 
(D f)( 
) = a f = I'

Let X = (x, y, z) for abbreviation. Let 
El = (1,0,0), 
E2 = (0, 1,0), 
E3 = (0,0, I) 
be the three standard unit vectors in the directions of the coordinate 
axes. Then we can abbreviate the Newton quotient for the partial deri-
vatives by writing 
DJ(X) = af = lim f(X + hEJ - f(X).

Indeed, observe that 
hEI = (h, 0, 0) 
so 
f(X + hEI) = f(x + h, y, Z), 
and similarly for the other two variables. 
In a similar fashion we can define the partial derivatives in n-space, by 
a definition which applies simultaneously to 2-space and 3-space. Let f 
be a function defined on an open set U in n-space. Let the variables be 
(Xl"" ,xn)· 
For small values of h, the point 
is contained in U. Hence the function is defined at that point, and we 
may form the quotient 
f(x l + h, X 2 , ••• ,xn) - f(x l , .•• ,xn) 
h 
If the limit exists as h tends to 0, then we call it the first partial deriva-
tive of f and denote it by 
Similarly, we let 
DJ(X) = of 
oXi 
if it exists, and call it the i-th partial derivative. 
Let 
Ei = (0, ... ,0, 1,0, ... ,0) 
be the i-th vector in the direction of the i-th coordinate axis, having 
components equal to ° except for the i-th component which is 1. Then 
we have 
(DJ)(X) = lim f(X + hE;) - f(X) .

This is a very useful brief notation which applies simultaneously to 
2-space, 3-space, or n-space.

Definition. Let f be a function of two variables (x, y). We define the 
gradient of f, written grad.f, to be the vector 
( of Of) 
gradf(x, y) = 
ox' oy . 
Example 6. Let f(x, y) = x 2i. Then 
so that in this case, 
gradf(1, 2) = (16, 12). 
Thus the gradient of a function f associates a vector to a point X. 
If f is a function of three variables (x, y, z), then we define the gradi-
ent to be 
( of of Of) 
gradf(x, y, z) = ax' oy' oz . 
Example 7. Let f(x, y, z) = x 2y sin(yz). Find grad f(l, 1, n). First we 
find the three partial derivatives, which are: 
~~ = 2xy sin(yz), 
~~ = x 2[y cos(yz)z + sin(yz)], 
of 
oz = x 2y cos(yz)y = x 2i cos(yz). 
We then substitute (1, 1, n) for (x, y, z) in these partials, and get 
gradf(l, 1, n) = (0, -n, -1). 
Let f be defined in an open set U in n-space, and assume that 
the partial derivatives of f exist at each point X of U. We define the 
gradient of f at X to be the vector 
( of 
Of) 
gradf(X) = ax!'···' oXn = (Dd(X), ... , D./(X», 

592 
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES 
[XVII, §2] 
whose components are the partial derivatives. One must read this 
(grad f)( X), 
but we shall usually omit the parentheses around grad f. Sometimes one 
also writes V f instead of grad f . Thus in 2-space we also write 
V f(x, y) = (V f)(x, y) = (Dd(x, y), D2 f(x, y», 
and similarly in 3-space, 
V f(x, y, z) = (Vf)(x, y, z) = (Dtf(x, y, z), Dd(x, y, z), Dd(x, y, z». 
So far, we defined the gradient only by a formula with partial deriva-
tives. 
We shall give a geometric interpretation for the gradient in 
Chapter XVIII, §3. There we shall see that it gives the direction of 
maximal increase of the function, and that its magnitude is the rate of 
increase in that direction. 
Using the formula for the derivative of a sum of two functions, and 
the derivative of a constant times a function, we conclude at once that 
the gradient satisfies the following properties: 
Theorem 2.1. Let f, g be two functions defined on an open set U, and 
assume that their partial derivatives exist at every point of U. Let c be 
a number. Then 
grad(f + g) = gradf + grad g, 
grad(cf) = c gradf. 
We shall give later several geometric and physical interpretations for 
the gradient.

XVII, §3. DIFFERENTIABILITY AND GRADIENT 
Let f be a function defined on an open set U. Let X be a point of U. 
For all vectors H such that IIHII is small (and H #- 0), the point X + H 
also lies in the open set. However, we cannot form a quotient 
f(X + H) - f(x) 
H 
because it is meaningless to divide by a vector. In order to define what 
we mean for a function f to be differentiable, we must therefore find a 
way which does not involve dividing by H. 
We reconsider the case of functions of one variable. Let us fix a 
number x. We had defined the derivative to be 
Let 
f '( ) = I· 
f(x + h) - f(x) 
x 
1m 
h 
. 
h-O 
q>(h) = f(x + ~ - f(x) - f'(x). 
Then q>(h) is not defined when h = 0, but 
lim q>(h) = 0. 
h-O 

594 
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES 
[XVII, §3] 
We can write 
f(x + h) - f(x) = f'(x)h + hq>(h). 
This relation has meaning so far only when h #- 0. However, we observe 
that if we define q>(0) to be 0, then the preceding relation is obviously 
true when h = ° 
(because we just get ° = 0). 
Let 
g(h) = q>(h) 
if h > 0, 
g(h) = -q>(h) 
if h < 0. 
Then we have shown that if f is differentiable, there exists a function g 
such that 
(1) 
f(x + h) - f(x) = f'(x)h + Ihlg(h), 
and 
lim g(h) = 0. 
h-O 
Conversely, suppose that there exists a number a and a function g(h) 
such that 
(la) 
f(x + h) - f(x) = ah + Ihlg(h). 
and 
lim g(h) = 0. 
h-O 
We find for h #- 0, 
f(x + h) - f(x) _ 
~ (h) 
h 
-a+ h g 
. 
Taking the limit as h approaches 0, we observe that 
I· Ihl 
h ° 
1m -g( ) = . 
h-O h 
Hence the limit of the Newton quotient exists and is equal to a. Hence f 
is differentiable, and its derivative f'(x) is equal to a. 
Therefore, the existence of a number a and a function g satisfying (la) 
above could have been used as the definition of differentiability in the 
case of functions of one variable. The great advantage of (1) is that no h 
appears in the denominator. It is this relation which will suggest to us 
how to define differentiability for functions of several variables, and how 
to prove the chain rule for them. 

[XVII, §3] 
DIFFERENTIABILITY AND GRADIENT 
595 
Let us begin with two variables. We let 
x = (x, y) 
and 
H = (h, k). 
Then the notion corresponding to x + h in one variable is here 
x + H = (x + h, y + k). 
We wish to compare the values of a function f at X and X + H, i.e. we 
wish to investigate the difference 
f(X + H) - f(X) = f(x + h, y + k) - f(x, y). 
Definition. We say that f is differentiable at X if the partial derivatives 
of 
ax 
and 
of 
oy 
exist, and if there exists a function 9 (defined for small H) such that 
lim g(H) = 0 
H-O 
and 
(2) 
of 
of 
f(x + h, y + k) - f(x, y) = ax h + oy k + IIHllg(H). 
We view the term 
as an approximation to f(X + H) - f(X), depending in a particularly 
simple way on hand k. 
If we use the abbreviation 
gradf= Vf, 
then formula (2) can be written 
I f(X + H) - f(X) = V f(x) · H + IIHlIg(H). 
As with grad f, one must read (V f)(X) and not the meaningless V(f(X» 
since f(X) is a number for each value of X, and thus it makes no sense 

596 
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES 
[XVII, §3] 
to apply V to a number. The symbol V is applied to the function f, and 
(V f)(X) is the value of V fat x. 
We now consider a function of n variables. 
Let f be a function defined on an open set U. Let X be a point of U. 
If H = (h l , ... ,h.) is a vector such that IIHII is small enough, then X + H 
will also be a point of V and so f(X + H) is defined. Note that 
This is the generalization of the x + h with which we dealt previously in 
one variable, or the (x + h, y + k) in two variables. For three variables, 
we already run out of convenient letters, so we may as well write n 
instead of 3. 
Definition. We say that f is differentiable at X if the partial derivatives 
Dd(X), ... ,D.J(X) exist, and if there exists a function g (defined for 
small H) such that 
and 
lim g(H) = 0 
H-O 
(also written 
lim g(H) = 0) 
IIHII-O 
f(X + H) - f(X) = Dd(X)h l + ... + D.J(x)h. + IIHllg(H). 
With the other notation for partial derivatives, this last relation reads: 
of 
of 
f(X + H) - f(X) =;- hl + ... + ;- h. + IIHlIg(H). 
UX l 
ux. 
We say that f is differentiable in the open set U if it is differentiable at 
every point of V, so that the above relation holds for every point X in 
U. 
In view of the definition of the gradient in §2, we can rewrite our 
fundamental relation in the form 
(3) 
I f(X + H) - f(X) = (gradf(X»)· H + IIHllg(H). 
The term IIHlIg(H) has an order of magnitude smaller than the previous 
term involving the dot product. This is one advantage of the present 
notation. We know how to handle the formalism of dot products and 

[XVII, §3] 
DIFFERENTIABILITY AND GRADIENT 
597 
are accustomed to it, and its geometric interpretation. This will help us 
later in interpreting the gradient geometrically. 
Example 1. Suppose that we consider values for H pointing only in 
the direction of the standard unit vectors. In the case of two variables, 
consider for instance H = (h, 0). Then for such H, the condition for 
differentiability reads: 
of 
f(X + H) = f(x + h, y) = f(x, y) + ox h + Ihlg(H). 
In higher dimensional space, let Ei = (0, ... ,0, 1, 0, ... ,0) be the i-th 
unit vector. Let H = hEi for some number h, so that 
H = (0, .. . ,0, h, 0, ... ,0). 
Then for such H, 
f(X + H) =f(X + hEi) =f(X) + :~. h + Ihlg(H), 
I 
and therefore if h i= 0, we obtain 
f(X + ~) - f(x) = DJ(X) + I~I g(H). 
Because of the special choice of H, we can divide by the number h, but 
we are not dividing by the vector H. 
The functions which we meet in practice are differentiable. The next 
theorem gives a criterion which shows that this is true. A function <p(X) 
is said to be continuous if 
lim <p(X + H) = <p(X), 
H~O 
for all X in the domain of definition of the function. 
Theorem 3.1. Let f be a function defined on some open set V. Assume 
that its partial derivatives exist for every point in this open set, and that 
they are continuous. Then f is differentiable. 
We shall omit the proof. Observe that in practice, the partial deriva-
tives of a function are given by formulas from which it is clear that they 
are continuous.

CHAPTER 
XVIII 
The Chain Rule and the 
Gradient 
In this chapter, we prove the chain rule for functions of several variables 
and give a number of applications. Among them will be several interpre-
tations for the gradient. These form one of the central points of our 
theory. They show how powerful the tools we have accumulated turn 
out to be. 
XVIII, §1. THE CHAIN RULE 
Let f be a function defined on some open set U. Let C(t) be a curve 
such that the values C(t) are contained in U. Then we can form the 
composite function f oe, which is a function of t, given by 
(f 0 C)(t) = f( C(t»). 
Example 1. Take f(x, y) = eX sin(xy). Let C(t) = (t 2, t 3 ). Then 
The expression on the right is obtained by substituting t 2 for x and t 3 
for y in f(x, y). This is a function of t in the old sense of functions of 
one variable. If we interpret f as the temperature, then f( C(t») is the 
temperature of a bug traveling along the curve C(t) at time t. 
The chain rule tells us how to find the derivative of this function, 
provided we know the gradient of f and the derivative C. Its statement 
is as follows. 

600 
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT 
[XVIII, §l] 
Chain rule. Let f be a function which is defined and differentiable on an 
open set U. Let C be a differentiable curve (defined for some interval of 
numbers t) such that the values C(t) lie in the open set U. Then the 
function 
f(C(t» 
is differentiable (as a function of t), and 
df(~(t» = (gradf(C(t»). C'(t). 
Memorize this formula by repeating it out loud. 
In the notation dC/dt, this also reads 
df(C(t» = (gradf)(C(t». dC.

Proof of the Chain Rule. By definition, we must investigate the quo-
tient 
Let 
f( C(t + h» - f( C(t» 
h 
K = K(t, h) = C(t + h} -
C(t}. 
Then our quotient can be rewritten in the form 
f( C(t) + K) - f( C(t» 
h 
Using the definition of differentiability for f, we have 
f(X + K} - f(X) = (gradf)(X)· K + IIKlIg(K) 
and 
lim g(K) = O. 
IIKII-O 
Replacing K by what it stands for, namely C(t + h) - C(t), and dividing 
by h, we obtain: 
f(C(t + h» - f(C(t» = (gradf)(C(t». C(t + h) - C(t) 
h

THE CHAIN RULE 
601 
As h approaches 0, the first term of the sum approaches what we want, 
namely 
(gradf)(C(t»· C(t). 
The second term approaches 
± IIC(t)lllim g(K), 
h-O 
and when h approaches 0, so does K = C(t + h) - C(t). Hence the 
second term of the sum approaches 0. This proves our chain rule. 
To use the chain rule for certain computations, it is convenient to 
reformulate it in terms of components, and in terms of the two notations 
we have used for partial derivatives 
of 
ox = Dd(x, y), 
when the variables are x, y.

In some cases, as in the next example, one does not use the chain rule 
in several variables, just the old one from one-variable calculus. 
Example 3. Let 
f(x, y, z) = sin(x2 -
3zy + xz). 
Then keeping y and z constant, and differentiating with respect to x, we 
find 
of 
Ox = COS(X2 - 3zy + xz)· (2x + z). 
More generally, let 
f(x, y, z) = g(X2 - 3zy + xz), 
where g is a differentiable function of one variable. [In the special case 
above, we have g(u) = sin u.] Then the chain rule gives 
of 
ox = g'(x2 - 3zy + xz)(2x + z).

XVIII, §2. TANGENT PLANE 
We begin by an example analyzing a function along a curve where the 
values of the function are constant. This gives rise to a very important 
principle of perpendicularity. 
Example l. Let f be a function on R3. Let us interpret f as giving the 
temperature, so that at any point X in R3, the value of the function f(X) 
is the temperature at X. Suppose that a bug moves in space along a 
differentiable curve, which we may denote in parametric form by 
B(t). 
Thus B(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t» is the position of the bug at time t. Let us 
assume that the hug starts from a point where it feels that the tempera-
ture is comfortable, and therefore that the temperature is constant along 
the path on which it moves. In other words, f is constant along the 
curve B(t). This means that for all values of t, we have 
f(B(t» = k, 
where k is constant. Differentiating with respect to t, and using the 
chain rule, we find that 
gradf(B(t»· B'(t) = O. 

[XVIII, §2] 
TANGENT PLANE 
605 
This means that the gradient of f is perpendicular to the velocity vector 
at every point of the curve. 
grad 1(8(1)) 
Figure 1 
Let f be a differentiable function defined on an open set U in 3-space, 
and let k be a number. The set of points X such that 
f(X) = k 
and 
gradf(X) =I 0 
is called a surface. It is the level surface of level k, for the function f. 
For the applications we have in mind, we impose the additional condi-
tion that grad f(X) =I O. It can be shown that this eliminates the points 
where the surface is not smooth. 
Let C(t) be a differentiable curve. We shall say that the curve lies on 
the surface if. for all t, we have 
f(C(t» = k. 
This simply means that all the points of the curve satisfy the equation of 
the surface. For instance, let the surface be defined by the equation 
The surface is the sphere of radius 1, centered at the origin, and here we 
have f(x, y, z) = x 2 + y2 + Z2. Let 
C(t) = (x(t), yet), z(t» 
be a curve, defined for t in some interval. Then C(t) lies on the surface 
means that 
X(t)2 + y(t)2 + Z(t)2 = 1 for all t in the interval. 
In other words, 
f(C(t) = 1, 
or also 
C(t? = 1. 
For theoretical purposes, it is neater to write f( C(t» = 1. For computa-
tional purposes, we have to go back to coordinates if we want specific 
numerical values in a given problem. 

606 
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT 
[XVIII, §2] 
Now suppose that a curve C(t) lies on a surface f(X) = k. Thus we 
have 
f(C(t»=k forallt. 
If we differentiate this relation, we get from the chain rule: 
gradf(C(t»· C(t) = O. 
Let P be a point of the surface, and let C(t) be a curve on the surface 
passing through P. This means that there is a number to such that 
C(to) = P. For this value to, we obtain 
gradf(P)· C(to) = o. 
Thus the gradient of f at P is perpendicular to the tangent vector of the 
curve at P. [We assume that C(to) -# 0.] This is true for every differen-
tiable curve on the surface passing through P. It is therefore very 
reasonable to make the following 
Definition. The tangent plane to the surface f(X) = kat the point P is 
the plane through P, perpendicular to grad f(P). 
We know from Chapter XV how to find such a plane. The definition 
applies only when grad f(P) -# o. If 
gradf(P) = 0, 
then we do not define the notion of tangent plane. 
The fact that grad f(P) is perpendicular to every curve passing 
through P on the surface also gives us an interpretation of the gradient 
as being perpendicular to the surface 
f(X) = k. 
which is one of the level surfaces for the function f (Fig. 2).

TANGENT PLANE 
607 
Example 2. Find the tangent plane to the surface 
at the point (1, 1, 1). 
Let f(X) = x 2 + y2 + Z2. Then at the point P = (1, 1, 1), 
gradf(P) = (2, 2,2). 
The equation of a plane passing through P and perpendicular to a vec-
tor N is 
X · N = P · N. 
In the present case, this yields 
2x + 2y + 2z = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. 
Observe that our arguments also give us a means of finding a vector 
perpendicular to a curve in 2-space at a given point, simply by applying 
the preceding discussion to the plane instead of 3-space. A curve is 
defined by an equation f(x, y) = k, and in this case, grad f(xo, Yo) is 
perpendicular to the curve at the point (xo, Yo) on the curve. 
Example 3. Find the tangent line to the curve 
at the point P = (1, 2), and find a vector perpendicular to the curve at 
that point. 
Let f(x, y) = x 2y + y3. Then 
gradf(x, y) = (2xy, x 2 + 3y2), 
and so 
gradf(P) = gradf(l, 2) = (4, 13). 
Let N = (4, 13). Then N is perpendicular to the curve at the given 
point. The tangent line is given by X· N = p . N, and thus its equation 
is 
4x + 13y = 4 + 26 = 30. 
Example 4. A surface may also be given in the form z = g(x, y) where 
g is some function of two variables. In this case, the tangent plane IS 
determined by viewing the surface as expressed by the equation 
g(x, y) - z = o. 

608 
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT 
[XVIII, §2] 
For instance, suppose the surface is given by z = x 2 + y2. We wish to 
determine the tangent plane at (1, 2, 5). Let f(x, y, z) = x 2 + i - z. 
Then 
gradf(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, -1) 
and 
gradf(l, 2,5) = (2,4, -1). 
The equation of the tangent plane at P = (1, 2, 5) perpendicular to 
N = (2,4, -1) 
is 
2x + 4y - z = p. N = 5. 
This is the desired equation. 
Example 5. Find a parametric equation for the tangent line to the 
curve of intersection of the two surfaces 
and 
at the point P = (1, 1, 2). 
The tangent line to the curve is the line in common with the tangent 
planes of the two surfaces at the point P. We know how to find these 
tangent planes, and in Chapter XV, we learned how to find the para-
metric representation of the line common to two planes, so we know 
how to do this problem. We carry out the numerical computation in 
full. 
The first surface is defined by the equation f(x, y, z) = 6. A vector N 1 
perpendicular to this first surface at P is given by 
N 1 = gradf(P), 
where gradf(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z). 
Thus for P = (1, 1, 2) we find 
Nl = (2, 2,4). 
The second surface is given by the equation g(x, y, z) = 2, and 
grad g(x, y, z) = (3x 2, -2y, 1). 
Thus a vector N 2 perpendicular to the second surface at P is 
N2 = grad g(l, 1,2) = (3, -2, 1). 
A vector A = (a, b, c) in the direction of the line of intersection is 
perpendicular to both N 1 and N 2. To find A, we therefore have to solve 
the equations 
and 
A· N2 = o. 

[XVIII, §2] 
This amounts to solving 
TANGENT PLANE 
2a + 2b + 4c = 0, 
3a - 2b + c = O. 
Let, for instance, a = 1. Solving for band c yields 
a = 1, 
b = 1, 
c = -1. 
609 
Thus A = (1, 1, -1). Finally, the parametric representation of the de-
sired line is 
P + tA = (1, 1,2) + t(l, 1, -1).

DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE 
611 
XVIII, §3. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE 
Let f be defined on an open set and assume that f is differentiable. Let 
P be a point of the open set, and let A be a unit vector (i.e. II A II = 1). 
Then P + tA is the parametric representation of a straight line in the 
direction of A and passing through P. We observe that 
d(P + tA) 
dt 
= A. 
For instance, if n = 2 and P = (p, q), A = (a, b), then 
P + tA = (p + ta, q + tb),

Hence

The same argument works in higher dimensions. 
We wish to consider the rate of change of f in the direction of A. It is 
natural to consider the values of f on the line P + tA, that is to consider 
the values 
f(P + tA). 
The rate of change of f along this line will then be given by taking the 
derivative of this expression, which we know how to do. We illustrate 
the line P + tA in the figure. 
P+tA 
Figure 3 

612 
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT 
[XVIII, §3] 
If f represents a temperature at the point P, we look at the variation 
of temperature in the direction of A, starting from the point P. The 
value f(P + tA) gives the temperature at the point P + tAo This is a 
function of t, say 
g(t) = f(P + tA). 
The rate of change of this temperature function is g'(t), the derivative 
with respect to t, and g'(O) is the rate of change at time t = 0, i.e. the 
rate of change of f at the point P, in the direction of A. 
By the chain rule, if we take the derivative of the function 
g(t) = f(P + tA), 
which is defined for small values of t, we obtain 
df(P + tA) 
dt 
= gradf(P + tA)· A. 
When t is equal to 0, this derivative is equal to 
gradf(P)· A. 
For obvious reasons, we now make the 
Definition. Let A be a unit vector. The directional derivative of f in 
the direction of A at P is the number 
D Af(P) = gradf(P)· A. 
We interpret this directional derivative as the rate of change of f along 
the straight line in the direction of A, at the point P. Thus if we agree 
on the notation D AflP) for the directional derivative of f at P in the 
direction of the unit vector A, then we have 
df(P + tA)1 
D Af(P) = 
dt 
1=0 = gradf(P)· A. 
In using this formula, the reader should remember that A is taken to be 
a unit vector. When a direction is given in terms of a vector whose norm 
is not 1, then one must first divide this vector by its norm before apply-
ing the formula. 

[XVIII, §3] 
DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE 
613 
Example 1. 
Let f(x, y) = x2 + y3 and let B = (1,2). 
Find the 
directional derivative of f in the direction of B, at the point (- 1, 3). 
We note that B is not a unit vector. Its norm is.;s. Let 
Then A is a unit vector having the same direction as B. Let 
P = (-1,3). 
Then grad f(P) = ( - 2, 27). Hence by our formula, the directional de-
rivative is equal to: 
1 
52 
grad f(P) . A = -
( - 2 + 54) = -
. 
.;s 
.;s 
Consider again a differentiable function f on an open set U. 
Let P be a point of V. Let us assume that grad f(P) i= 0 , and let A 
be a unit vector. We know that 
D Af(P) = gradf(P)· A = Ilgradf(P)IIIIAIl cos (), 
where () is the angle between grad f(P) and A. Since IIA II = 1, we see 
that the directional derivative is equal to 
D Af(P) = II gradf(P) II cos 8. 
We remind the reader that this formula holds only when A is a unit 
vector. 
The value of cos () varies between - 1 and + 1 when we select all 
possible unit vectors A. 
The maximal value of cos () is obtained when we select A such that 
() = 0, i.e. when we select A to have the same direction as grad f(P). In 
that case, the directional derivative is equal to the norm of the gradient. 
Thus we have obtained another interpretation for the gradient: 
The direction of the gradient is that of maximal increase of the 
function. 
The norm of the gradient is the rate of increase of the function in 
that direction (i.e. in the direction of maximal increase). 

614 
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT 
[XVIII, §3] 
The directional derivative in the direction of A is at a minimum when 
cos f) = - I. This is the case when we select A to have opposite direc-
tion to grad f(P). That direction is therefore the direction of maximal 
decrease of the function. 
For example, f might represent a temperature distribution in space. At 
any point P, a particle which feels cold and wants to become warmer 
fastest should move in the direction of grad f(P). Another particle which 
is warm and wants to cool down fastest should move in the direction of 
-grad f(P). 
Example 2. Let f(x, y) = x 2 + l again, and let P = (-I, 3). Find 
the directional derivative of f at P, in the direction of maximal increase 
of f. 
We have found previously that grad f(P) = (-2, 27). The directional 
derivative of f in the direction of maximal increase is precisely the norm 
of the gradient, and so is equal to 
Ilgradf(P)11 = II( -2,27)11 = J4 + 272 = j733.

Warning: Do not write or/oX. This suggests dividing by a vector X 
and is therefore bad notation. The notation or/ox was correct and good 
notation since we differentiate only with respect to the single variable x.

is correctly expressed by the formula grad r = X/r in the box.

By definition of the gradient, it follows that 
We now come to other functions depending on the distance. Such 
functions arise frequently. For instance, a temperature function may be 
inversely proportional to the distance from the source of heat. A poten-
tial function may be inversely proportional to the square of the distance 
from a certain point. The gradient of such functions has special proper-
ties which we discuss further. 
Example 1. Let 
f(x, y) = sin r = sin Jx 2 + y2. 
Then f(x, y) depends only on the distance r of (x, y) from the origin. By 
the chain rule,

The same use of the chain rule as in the special case

Let 9 be a differentiable function of one variable, and let f(X) = g(r). 
Then 
g'(r) 
gradf(X) = -x.

Work out all the examples given in Exercise 2. You should memorize 
and keep in mind this simple expression for the gradient of a function 
which depends only on the distance. Such dependence is expressed by 
the function g. 
Exercises 9 and 10 give important information concerning functions 
which depend only on the distance from the origin, and should be seen 
as essential complements of this section. They will prove the following 
result. 
A differentiable function f(X) depends only on the distance of X from 
the origin if and only if grad f(X) is parallel to X, or O. 
In this situation, the gradient grad f(X) may point towards the origin, 
or away from the origin, depending on whether the function is decreasing 
or increasing as the point moves away from the origin. 
Example 2. Suppose a heater is located at the origin, and the temper-
ature at a point decreases as a function of the distance from the origin, 
say is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the 
origin. Then temperature is given as 
h(X) = g(r) = kjr2

r4 
The factor 2k/r4 is positive, and we see that grad h(X) points in the 
direction of - X. Each circle centered at the origin is a level curve for 
temperature. Thus the gradient may be drawn as on the following 
figure. The gradient is parallel to X but in opposite direction. A bug 
traveling along the circle will stay at constant temperature. If it wants to 
get warmer fastest, it must move toward the origin. 
Figure 4 
The dotted lines indicate the path of the bug when moving in the direc-
tion of maximal increase of the function. These lines are perpendicular 
to the circles of constant temperature.

You may either work out each exercise separately, writing 
r = J x~ + ... + x;,

Probably you should do both for a while to get used to the various nota-
tions and situations which may rise. 
The next five exercises concern certain parametrizations, and some of the results 
from them will be used in Exercise 9. 
3. Let A. B be two unit vectors such that A· B = O. Let 
F(t) = (cos t)A + (sin t)B. 
Show that F(t) lies on the sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin, for each 
value of t. [Hint: What is F(t)· F(t)?] 
4. Let P, Q be two points on the sphere of radius 1, centered at the origin. Let 
L(t) = P + t(Q - P), with 0 ~ t ~ 1. If there exists a value of t in [0, 1] such. 
that L(t) = 0, show that t =!, and that P = -Q. 
5. Let P, Q be two points on the sphere of radius 1. Assume that P of- - Q. 
Show that there exists a curve joining P and Q on the sphere of radius 1, 
centered at the origin. By this we mean there exists a curve C(t) such that 
C(t)2 = I, or if you wish II C(t)11 = 1 for all t, and there are two numbers t 1 
and t2 such that C(tl) = P and C(t 2) = Q. [Hint: Divide L(t) in Exercise 4 
by its norm.] 
6. If P, Q are two unit vectors such that P = - Q, show that there exists a 
differentiable curve joining P and Q on the sphere of radius 1, centered at 
the origin. You may assume that there exists a unit vector A which is per-
pendicular to P. Then use Exercise 3. 
7. Parametrize the ellipse (x2/a 2 ) + (y2/b 2 ) = 1 by a differentiable curve. 
8. Let f be a differentiable function (in two variables) such that grad f(X) = eX 
for some constant e and all X in 2-space. Show that f is constant on any 
circle of radius a > 0, centered at the origin. [Hint: Put x = a cos t and 
y = a sin t and find df (dt.] 
Exercise 8 is a special case of a general phenomenon, stated in Exercise 9. 
9. Let f be a differentiable function in n variables, and assume that there exists 
a function h such that grad f(X) = h(X)X. Show that f is constant on the 
sphere of radius a > 0 centered at the origin. 

[XVIII, §5] 
CONSERVATION LAW 
621 
[That f is constant on the sphere of radius a means that given any two points P, 
Q on this sphere, we must have f(P) = f(Q). To prove this, use the fact proved 
in Exercises 5 and 6 that given two such points, there exists a curve C(t) joining 
the two points, i.e. C(t l ) = P, C(t 2 ) = Q, and C(t) lies on the sphere for all t in 
the interval of definition, so 
The hypothesis that grad f(X) can be written in the form h(X)X for some func-
tion h means that grad f(X) is parallel to X (or 0). Indeed, we know that 
gradf(X) parallel to X means that grad f(X) is equal to a scalar multiple of X, 
and this scalar may depend on X, so we have to write it as a function h(X).] 
10. Let r = IIXII. Let 9 be a differentiable function of one variable whose deriva-
tive is never equal to O. Let f(X) = g(r). Show that grad f(X) is parallel to 
X for X 0# O. 
[This statement is the converse of Exercise 9. The proof is quite easy, cf. Exam-
ple 1. The function h(X) of Exercise 9 is then seen to be equal to g'(r)jr.] 
XVIII, §5. CONSERVATION LAW 
Definition. Let U be an open set. By a vector field on U we mean an 
association which to every point of U associates a vector of the same 
dimension. 
If F is a vector field on U, and X a point of U, then we denote by 
F(X) the vector associated to X by F and call it the value of F at X, as 
usual. 
Example 1. Let F(x, y) = (x 2y, sin xy). Then F is a vector field which 
to the point (x, y) associates (x 2y, sin xy), having the same number of 
coordinates, namely two of them in this case. 
A vector field in physics is often interpreted as a field of forces. A 
vector field may be visualized as a field of arrows, which to each point 
associates an arrow as shown on the figure.

622 
THE CHAIN RULE AND THE GRADIENT 
[XVIII, §5] 
Each arrow points in the direction of the force, and the length of the 
arrow represents the magnitude of the force. 
If f is a differentiable function on V, then we observe that grad f is a 
vector field, which associates the vector grad f(P) to the point P of U. 
If F is a vector field, and if there exists a. differentiable function f such 
that F = grad f, then the vector field is called conservative. Since 
- grad f = grad( - f) 
it does not matter whether we use f or -fin the definition of conserva-
tive. 
Let us assume that F is a conservative field on V, and let l/I be a 
differentiable function such that for all points X in V we have 
F(X) = -grad l/I. 
In physics, one interprets !/I as the potential energy. Suppose that a par-
ticle of mass m moves on a differentiable curve C(t) in U. Newton's law 
states that 
F( C(t») = mC"(t) 
for all t where C(t) is defined. Newton's law says that force equals mass 
times acceleration. 
Physicists define the kinetic energy to be 
Conservation Law. Assume the vector field F is conservative, that is 
F = - grad l/I, where l/I is the potential energy. Assume that a particle 
moves on a curve satisfying Newton's law. Then the sum of the potential 
energy and kinetic energy is constant. 
Proof We have to prove that 
!/I ( C(t» + tmC(t? 
is constant. To see this, we differentiate the sum. By the chain rule, we 
see that the derivative is equal to 
grad !/I ( C(t» . C(t) + mC(t) . C"(t). 

[XVIII, §5] 
CONSERVATION LAW 
623 
By Newton's law, mC"(t) = F( C(t») = - grad I/t( C(t»). Hence this deriva-
tive is equal to 
grad I/t( C(t») . C(t) - grad I/t( C(t») . C(t) = o. 
This proves what we wanted. 
It is not true that all vector fields are conservative. We shall discuss 
the problem of determining which ones are conservative in the next 
book. 
The fields of classical physics are for the most part conservative. 
Example 2. Consider a force F(X) which is inversely proportional to 
the square of the distance from the point X to the origin, and in the 
direction of X. Then there is a constant k such that for X =1= 0 we have 
1 
X 
F(X) = k IIXII2 IIXII' 
because X/IIXII is the unit vector in the direction of X. Thus 
1 
F(X) = k)X, 
r 
where r = IIXII. A potential energy for F is given by 
k 
I/t(X) = -. 
r 
This is immediately verified by taking the partial derivatives of this func-
tion. 
If there exists a function cp(X) such that 
F(X) = (grad cp)(X), 
that is 
F = grad cp, 
then we shall call such a function cp a potential function for F. Our 
conventions are such that a potential function is equal to minus the 
potential energy.

In Problems 7 through 12, there is a pattern. Note that the derivatives of sin x 
are: 
f(x) = sin x; 
f(l)(x) = cos x; 
j<2)(X) = -sin x; 
j<3)(X) = -cos x; 
j<4)(X) = sin x. 
Then the derivatives repeat. Thus every fourth derivative is the same. Hence to 
find the n-th derivative, we just divide n by 4, and if r is the remainder, so

it follows that sin2 e ~ Isin el. Also the regions of increase and decrease are over 
intervals of length n/2. You should make a table of these, and then see that the

The ovals are thinner than circles, contrary to Problem 6, where they were 
more expanded than circles. 
9. r = 4 sin2 e. Note that the right-hand side is always ~ 0, and so there is a 
value of r for each value of e. Also

By algebra, this is equivalent to 4(x2 + i) = (x + 2)2, that is

we obtain when we square both sides, and the equation becomes

This is the equation of a hyperbola. Thus the equation in polar coordinates 
is equivalent with the equation of a hyperbola, together with the additional 
condition x ~ 2. 
30. r = tan 8 = sin 8/cos 8. Multiply both sides by cos 8 to see that this equation 
is equivalent to r cos 8 = sin 8, that is 
x = sin 8. 
Of course, the function is not defined when cos 8 = O. Since 
-1 < sin 8 < I, 
it follows that -I < x < 1. We make a small table:

As 8 approaches 11/2, x approaches 1. 
But cos 8 approaches 0 and so 
r = tan 8 becomes very large positive. Hence the graph looks as in the fol-
lowing figure for 0 ~ x < 1. 
The graph also has a symmetry. Since r = y/x and r ~ 0, both y and x 
must have the same sign, that is both x, y > 0 or both x, y < 0, unless x = O.

Observe that the function sin2 x is differentiable, and its derivative is 0 at 
x = 0, n/2, n, etc., so the curve is flat at these points. On the other hand, 
Isin xl is not differentiable at 0, n, 2n, etc., where it is "pointed." For in-
stance, the graph of Isin xl for n ~ x ~ 2n is obtained by reflecting the graph 
of sin x across the x-axis. 
Let 
f(x) = sin2 x. 
Then rex) = 2 sin x cos x = sin 2x. 
Also rex) = 
2 cos 2x. These allow you to find easily the regions of increase, decrease, and 
the inflection points, when rex) = O. 
The inflection points are when

range is therefore x = 16/6 = 8/3. By a direction computation you can see 
that f(8/3) is smaller than f(O) or f(4). Since there is only one critical point 
in the given interval, it must be the required minimum. You could also 
graph f'(x) (parabola) to see that f'(x) < 0 if 0 < x < 8/3 and f'(x) > 0 if 
8/3 < x < 4, so f(x) is decreasing to the left of the critical point, and increas-
ing to the right of the critical point, whence the critical point is a minimum 
in the given interval. 
7. Minimum: use 24n/(4 + n) cm for circle; 96/(4 + n) cm for square. 
Maximum: use whole wire for circle. 
We show how to set up Exercise 7. Let x be the side of the square. Then 
4x is the perimeter of the square, and 0 ~ 4x ~ 24, so 0 ~ x ~ 6. 
Also, 
24 - 4x is the length of the circle, i.e. the circumference. But 
24 - 4n = 2nr, 
where r is the radius, 
and nr2 is the area of the circle. The sum of the areas is 
This is expressed in terms of two variables, x and r, but we have the relation 
24 -4x 
r=~, 
so that the sum of the areas can be expressed in terms of one variable, 
( 24 - 4X)2 
f(x) = n ~ 
+ x 2. 
You can now minimize or maximize by finding first the critical points, and 
then investigate if they are maxima, minima, or whether such extrema occur 
when 4x = 24 or 4x = O. Note that the graph of f is a parabola, bending 
up. What is f(O)? What is f(6)? The possible values for x are in the 
interval 0 ~ x ~ 6. The maximum or minimum of f in this interval is either 
f(O), f(6), or at the critical point x such that f'(x) = O. Draw the graph of 
f to get the idea of what happens.

But j'(y) = V /4) - 2 and f'(y) = 0 if and only if y = 2, so x = 1. You can

ANSWERS TO EXERCISES 
which is a function of x alone. The picture is as shown roughly. 
We have to minimize f(x). As x becomes large positive or negative, f(x) 
becomes large positive because 
f(x) = x 6 + lower degree terms. 
Hence a minimum occurs at a critical point. We have 
f'(x) = 2(x - ll) + 2(x 3 -
3x -
1)(3x2 -
3) 
so 
! f'(x) = 3x 5 -
I2x 3 -
3x 2 + lOx - 8. 
Plugging 2 directly shows that 1'(2) = 0, and therefore 2 is a critical point. If 
we could show that 2 is the only critical point of f, then we would be done. 
Let us get more information on f'(x). By long division, we obtain a factor-
ing 
!f'(x) = (x - 2)g(x) 
where 
g(x) = 3x4 + 6x 3 -
3x + 4. 
The function g(x) is still complicated. If g(x) * 0 for all x we would be done, 
but it looks hard, even if true. Let us avoid technical complications and let 
us simplify our original problem by inspection. The picture suggests that all 
points (x, y) on the curve y = x 3 -
3x such that x ~ I will be at further 
distance from (11, I) than (2,2). This is actually easily proved, for f(2) = 82, 
and if x ~ 1 then 
f(x) ~ (x -
11)2 ~ 100 > 82. 
Therefore it suffices to prove that f(2) is a minimum for f(x) when x > 1, 
and it suffices to prove that 2 is the only critical point of f(x) for x > I.

This proves that g(x) > 0 for x > 1. Therefore x = 2 is the only critical point 
of f for x > I, and finally we have proved that the minimum of f(x) is at 
x = 2.

14. Answer (1,2). 
The square of the distance between (x, y) and (9,0) is 
(x - 9)2 + y2. Since y = 2x2, we have to minimize 
Then f'(x) = 16x3 + 2x - 18, and f'(l) = O. You can graph f'(x) as usual. 
Since f"(x) = 48x2 + 2 > 0 for all x, we see that f'(x) is strictly increasing, 
so f'(x) = 0 only for x = I, which is the only critical point of f But f(x) 
becomes large when x becomes large positive or negative, and so f(x) has a 
minimum. Since there is only one critical point for f, the minimum is equal 
to the critical point, thus giving the answer.

F (y) = 2(h _ y)I /2 . 
Thus F'(y) = 0 if and only if y = 2h/l 
But F(O) = F(h) = 0 and F(y) > 0 for 
all y in the interval 0 < y < h. Hence the critical point must be the maxi-

A'(x) = x}3/18 - (L - x)f2n. 
Thus the critical point is as given in the answer. Since the graph of A(x) is a 
parabola bending up, the critical point is a minimum. The maximum occurs 
at the end point of the interval 0 ~ x ~ L. To find out which end point, 
evaluate A(O) and A(L) and compare the two values to see that A(O) is

In particular, we see that there is only one critical point. Hence the 
minimum of f is either at the end points x = 0 or x = a, or at the critical

which is negative. Hence f'(x) < 0 when x is near 0, and the function is 
decreasing when x is near O. 
On the other hand, suppose x is near a. Then the second term in f'(x) is 
near 0 and the first term is near 
Consequently f'(x) > 0 when x is near a. Therefore f is increasing when x is 
near a. Since f(x) is decreasing for x near 0 and increasing for x near a it 
follows that the minimum cannot be at the end points, and hence is some-
where in the middle. Hence the minimum is a critical point, and we have 
seen that there is only one critical point. Hence the minimum is at the 
critical point. This proves what we wanted.

24. p = sin. Since L(O) = L(I) = 0 and L(p) > 0 for 0 < p < I, it follows that the 
maximum is at a critical point. But 
L'(p) = pS(n - s)(1 - pr s - I( -1) + spS-I(1 - pr s 
= pS- I(1 _ p)n-s-I[p(s -

= pS- I(1 _ p)n - S- I( _ np + s). 
For 0 < p < I, the factor pS-I(1 -
p)n-S-I is not 0, so L'(p) = 0 if and only if 
- np + s = 0, that is p = sin. Hence there is only one critical point, so the

From the physical considerations, we are limited to the interval x > 3. 
As x approaches 3 and x > 3 the denominator approaches 0 and is

It suffices to maximize the area given by 
for 0 < x < 60. 
Then A'(x) = (_2X2 + 60 2)/2(602 -
X2)1 /2 and A'(x) = 0 if and only if 
x = 60/fi . But A(x) ~ 0 and A(O) = A(60) = O. Hence the critical point is 
the maximum. The above value for x implies that 8 = n/2, because the tri-
angle is similar to the triangle with sides 1, 1, fi . 
29. n/l 
We work it out. Let the depth be y. Then sin 8 = y/ l00. Maximum 
capacity occurs when the area of the cross section is maximum. This area is 
equal to 
A = l00y + 2(h 100 cos 8). 
You have a choice whether to express A entirely in terms of y or entirely in 
terms of 8. Suppose we do it in terms of 8. Then 
A(8) = 104 sin 8 + 104 sin 8 cos 8 = 104 [sin 8 + ! sin 28]. 
So A'(8) = 104[cos 8 + cos 28], and 0 ~ 8 ~ n/2. But in this interval, cos 8 
and cos 28 are strictly decreasing so A'(8) is strictly decreasing. We have 
A'(8) = 0 precisely when cos 8 + cos 28 = 0, which occurs when 8 = n/l Thus 
A'(8) > 0 if 0 < 8 < n/3 and A'(8) < 0 if n/3 < 8 < n/2. Hence A(8) is in-
creasing for 0 ~ 8 ~ n/3 and decreasing for n/3 ~ 8 ~ n/2. Hence the maxi-

cases when taking the second derivative is useful. The second derivative is 
f"(x) = 2 + 2a/x3, and the critical point has been determined to be when

e2h(x) 
eh(x)h'(x)f(x) - f(x)eh(X)h'(x) 
e2h(x)

Hence f(x)leh(X) is constant, so there is a constant C such that 
f(x) 
eh(x) = C.

creasing. We have f(O) = 1, and f( -1) = lie - 1 < 0 because lie < 1. By 
the intermediate value theorem, there exists some x such that f(x) = 0, and 
this value of x is unique because f is strictly increasing. 
16. See the proof of Theorem 5.1. 
17. If x = 1 in Exercise 16(b) we get 2 < e. If x = 1 in Exercise 16(c) we get

So there is only one critical point, and the regions of increase and de-

If x ~ 00

17. (b) We carry out the details of the graph for f(x) = Xl log x. We have 
rex) = x + 2x log x = x(l + 2 log x). 
Since x > 0, it follows that rex) > 0 if and only if 1 + 210g x > 0, and 
1 + 2 log x> 0 
if and only if 
if and only if 
logx> -1/2 
Thus f is strictly increasing for x ~ e- 1/2 and is strictly decreasing for 
From Exercise 14 we know that x log x approaches 0 as x approaches 
O. Hence rex) approaches 0 as x approaches 0, which means the curve 
looks flat near O. We have 
f"(x) = (1 + 2 log x) + 2 = 3 + 2 log x. 
Then f"(x) = 0 if and only if 3 + 210g x = 0, or, in other words, 
log x = - 3/2 and x = e - 3/2. 
Thus the inflection point occurs for 
x = e- 3/ 2• This explains all the indicated features of the graph. 
17. (c) f(x) = x(log X)2 for x> O. Then

rex) = X· 2(log x) - + (log X)2

The signs of the two factors log x and 2 + log x will vary according to

rex) = 0 -= log x = 0 or 2 + log x = 0 
-= x = 1 or log x = - 2 
-= x=1 or x=e- 2 . 
So there are two critical points at x = 1 and x = e- 2 . We make a table

For x> 0 we have 2/x > 0 so f"(x) = 0 if and only if x = e- I . Since 
f"(x»O 
¢> logx> -1 
¢> x>e - I , 
f"(x)<O 
¢> logx< -1 
¢> x<e- I , 
it follows that x = e - 1 is an inflection point. The graph bends up if 
x > e - 1 and bends down if x < e - I. 
If x -+ 00 
then log x -+ 00 
so 
f(x) -+ 00. 
If x -+ 0 
then 
f(x) -+ 0 
by Exercise 15. 
This justifies all features of the graph as drawn. 
17. (d) We carry out the details. Let f(x) = xflogx for x> 0, and x#- 1. Then 
( 
1) 
log x-I 
f'(x) = 
log x -
X· ~ /(log X)2 = (log X)2 . 
For x#- 1 the denominator is positive (being a square). Hence 
f'(x) = 0 
¢> log x = 1 
¢> x = e, 
f'(x) > 0 
¢> log x > 1 
¢> x > e, 
f'(x) < 0 
¢> log x < 1 
¢> x < e. 
Next we list the behavior as x becomes large positive, x approaches 0, 
and x approaches 1 (since the denominator is not defined at x = 1). 
If x -+ 00 
then x/log x -+ 00 
by Theorem 4.3. 
If x -+ 0, 
then x/log x -+ O. 
This is because log x becomes large negative, but is in the denominator, 
so dividing by a large negative number contributes to the fraction 
approaching O. 
If x -+ 1 and x > 1 then x/log x -+ 00. 
Proof: The numerator x 
approaches 1. The denominator log x approaches 0, and is positive for 
x > 1. So x/log x -+ 00. 
If x -+ I and x < I then xflog x -+ -
00 . Proof: Again the numerator 
x approaches 1, and the denominator log x approaches 0 but is negative 
for x < 1, so x/log x -+ -
00. 
This already justifies the graph as drawn in so far as regions of 
increase and decrease are concerned, and for the critical point (there is 
only one critical point). Let us now look at the regions of bending up

We shall now analyze the sign of rex) in various intervals, taken 
between the points 0, 1, and e2 which are the points where the factors of 
rex) change sign. Note that the sign of rex) (plus or minus) will be 
determined by the signs of log x, x, and log x - 2, together with the 
minus sign in front. 
If x> e2 then rex) < 0 and the graph bends down, because 
log x - 2 > 0, both log x and x are positive, and the minus sign in front 
makes rex) negative. 
If 1 < x < e2 then rex) > 0 because log x - 2 < 0, both log x and x 
are positive, and the minus sign in front together with the fact that 
log x - 2 is negative make rex) positive. Hence the graph bends up for 
I < x < e2. 
If 0 < x < 1 then rex) < 0 because x is positive, log x is negative, 
log x - 2 is negative, and the minus sign in front combines with the other 
signs to make rex) negative. 
Hence the graph bends down for 
O<x<1. 
18. Let f(x) = XX = exlogx. Then 
f'(x) = eX log x( X· ~ + log x) = exlogx(l + log x).

f'(x)=O

f'(x)<O

5. Let y = f(x) = !(eX - eX) = sinh x. Then 
But cosh x > 0 for all x, so f is strictly increasing for all x. If x is large 
negative, then eX is small, and e- X is large positive, so f(x) is large positive. 
If x is large positive, then eX is large positive, and e - X is small. Hence 
f(x) -> 00 
f(x) --+ -

as 
x -> 00, 
as

By the intermediate value theorem, the values of f(x) consist of all numbers. 
Hence the inverse function x = g(y) is defined for all numbers y. We have

rex) = !(eX - e- X) = sinh x. 
If x > 0 then eX> 1 and 0 < e- X < 1 so rex) > 0 for all x> O. Hence f is 
strictly increasing, and the inverse function 
x = g(y) = arccosh y 
exists. We have f(O) = 1. As x -+ 00, eX -+ 00 and e- X -+ 0, so f(x) -+ 00. 
Hence the values of f(x) consist of all numbers ~ 1 when x ~ O. Hence the

The graph of f(x) = cosh x for all numbers x bends as shown on the figure. 
and there are two possible inverse functions depending on whether we look 
at the interval

x ~O . 
Taking 
x=log(y+~ 
is the inverse function for x ~ 0 and taking 
x = log(y - R-=t) 
is the inverse functions for x ;£ O. Indeed suppose we take the solution with 
the minus sign. Then by simple algebra, you can see that

ANSWERS TO EXERCISES 
[Proof: you have to check that y - 1 ~ JY2=l. Since y ~ 1, it suffices to 
check that (y - 1)2 ~ y2 - 1, which amounts to 
or y ~ 1, which checks.] 
Thus y - JY2=l ~ 1, whence 
log(y - JY2=l) ~ O. 
For x ~ 0 it follows that we have to use the solution of the quadratic equa-
tion for u in terms of y with the plus sign, that is 
eX =u=y+JY2=l 
and 
x = log(y + JY2=l).

is a hyperbola as drawn. 
"

y=JT-i 
, 
The top part of the hyperbola in the first quadrant is the graph of the 
function 
Y= Jx2=l, 
with the positive square root, and x ~ 1. Hence the area under the graph 
between 1 and B is 
Area = r 
Jx2=l dx. 
We want to make the expression under the square into a perfect square. We 
use the substitution 
x = cosh t 
and 
dx = sinh t dt. 
Then you get into an integral consisting of powers of e' and e-' which is 
easy to evaluate. Change the limits of integration in the way explained in the 
last example of the section. Let u = e' and solve a quadratic equation for u. 
You will find the given answer.

The case of log 3 is done in the same way. Note that each fraction 9/ 10,

The computation for log 3 is similar. In each case, note that the fac-
tors 7, - 2, 3 for log 2 and 11, - 3, 5 for log 3 have to be taken into

arctan(I/5) + arctan(5/12) = arctan(37/55) using u = 1/5 and v = 5/12, 
arctan(I/5) + arctan(37/55) = arctan(120/119).

If to is a value of t which minimizes the distance, then it also minimizes 
the square of the distance, which is easier to work with because it does not 
involve the square root sign. Let f(t) be the square of the distance, so 
f(t) = (X(t) - Q)2 = (X(t) - Q) . (X(t) - Q). 
At a minimum, the derivative must be 0, and the derivative is 
f'(t) = 2(X(t) - Q) . X'(t). 
Hence at a minimum, we have (X(to) - Q) . X'(to) = 0, and hence X(to) - Q 
is perpendicular to X '(to), i.e. is perpendicular to the curve. If X(t) = P + tA 
is the parametric representation of a line, then X '(t) = A, so we find 
(P + toA - Q). A = O. 
Solving for to yields (P - Q) . A + toA . A = 0, whence 
(Q - P)· A 
to =

14. Let v(t) = IIX'(t)ll. To show v(t) is constant, it suffices to prove that v(t)2 is 
constant, and V(t)2 = X'(t)· X'(t). To show that a function is constant it suf-
fices to prove that its derivative is 0, and we have 
d 
dt V(t)2 = 2X'(t) . X"(t). 
By assumption, X'(t) is perpendicular to X"(t), so the right-hand side is 0, as 
desired. 
15. Differentiate the relation X(t)· B = t, you get 
X '(t)· B = 1, 
so IIX'(t)IIIIBII cos {} = 1. Hence IIX'(t)11 = 1/ IIBII cos {} is constant. Hence the 
square X'(t)2 is constant. Differentiate, you get 
2X'(t) · X"(t) = 0, 
so X'(t)· X"(t) = 0, and X'(t) is perpendicular to X"(t), as desired.

curves intersect when t = 0 and {} = O. Also 
and 
Y'({}) = (-1, -sin {}, cos (}) 
so 
X'(O) = (1, 2, 1) 
and 
Y'(O) = (-1, 0, 1). 
The angle between their tangents at the point of intersection is the angle 
between X'(O) and Y'(O), which is n/2, because 
. 
X'(O) · Y'(O)

19. (18, 4, 12) when t = - 3 and (2, 0, 4) when t = 1.

3x(t) -
14y(t) + z(t) -
10 = O. 
In the present case, this means that 
This is a quadratic equation for t, which you solve by the quadratic formula. 
You will get the two values t = - 3 or t = 1, which you substitute back in 
the parametric curve (2t2, 1 - t, 3 + t2) to get the two points. 
20. (a) Each coordinate of X(t) has derivative equal to 0, so each coordinate is 
constant, so X(t) = A for some constant A. 
(b) X(t) = tA + B for constant vectors A#-O and B.

23. Differentiate the relation X(t)· B = e2', you get 
X'(t) · B = 2e2' = IIX'(t)IIIIBII cos O. 
But IIBII = I by assumption, so the speed is v(t) = IIX'(t)11 = 2e2'/cos O. Square

25. (a) To say that B(t) lies on the surface means that the coordinates of B(t) 
satisfy the equation of the surface, that is 
Differentiate. You get 
2z(t)z'(t) = 2x(t)x'(t) -
2y(t)y'(t), 
which after dividing by 2 yields 
Now 
z(t)z'(t) = x(t)x'(t) - y(t)y'(t). 
B(t)· B'(t) = x(t)x'(t) + y(t)y'(t) + z(t)z'(t). 
= 2x(t)x'(t) by (*). 
(b) Given any point (x ,y, z) the distance of this point to the yz-plane is just 
Ixl. So if x is positive, the distance is x itself. We use the derivative test: 
if x'(t) ~ 0 for all t then x is increasing. We have: 
2x(t)x'(t) = B(t) · B'(t) by (a) 
= IIB(t)IIIIB'(t)111 cos O(t). 
By assumption, cos O(t) is positive, and the norms IIB(t)ll, IIB'(t)11 are ~ 0, 
so if x(t) > 0, dividing by 2x(t) shows that x'(t) ~ 0, whence x(t) is 
increasing, as was to be shown.

Let C'(O) = (a, b). 
Now grad f( C(O» = (9,2) and grad g( C(O» = (4, 1), so

10. For any unit vector A, the function of t given by f(P + tA) has a maximum 
at t = 0 (for small values of t), and hence its derivative is 0 at t = O. But its 
derivative is grad f(P + tA)· A, which at t = 0 is grad f(P)· A. This is true 
for all A, whence grad f(P) = o. (For instance, let A be anyone of the 
standard unit vectors in the directions of the coordinate axes.) 
Although the above argument is the one which will work in Problem 11, 
there is a basically easier way to see the assertion. Fix all but one variable, 
and say Xl is the variable. Let 
g(x) = f(x, a2, ... ,an), 
where 
P = (a l , · ·· ,an)· 
Then 9 is a function of one variable, which has a maximum at X = a l . 
Hence g'(a 1) = 0 by last year's calculus. But 
g'(a l ) = Dtf(a l , ·· · ,an)· 
Similarly DJ(P) = 0 for all i, as asserted.

because A 2 = 8 2 = 1 since A, 8 are unit vectors and A· B = 0 by assump-
tion. Hence IIF(t)11 = I, so F(t) lies on the sphere of radius l. 
____ ----..F(t) = (cos t)A + (sin t)B 
4. Note that L(t) = (1 - t)P + tQ. If L(t) = 0 for some value of t, then 
(l -
I)P = -IQ 
Square both sides, use p2 = Q2 = 1 to get (1 - t)2 = t2. It follows that 
1 
-1 
t = 1/2, so "i P = 2 
Q, whence P = -Q. 
5. By Exercise 4, L(t) =f. 0 if 0 ~ t ~ l. Then L(t)/ IIL(t)11 is a unit vector, and 
this expression is composed of differentiable expressions so is differentiable. 
Furthermore, we have 
L(O) = P 
and 
L(l)=Q. 
Thus if we put C(t) = L(t)/II L(t)ll, then IIC(t)1I = 1 for all t, and the curve 
C( t) lies on the sphere. Also 
C(O) = P 
and 
C(I) = Q. 
Hence C(t) is a curve on the sphere which joins P and Q.

6. Suppose P, Q are two points on the sphere, but P = - Q. In this case we 
cannot apply Exercise 5, but we can apply Exercise 3. We let 
C(t) = (cos t)P + (sin t)A, 
where A is a unit vector perpendicular to P. Then C(t)2 = 1, so C(t) lies on 
the sphere, and we have 
C(O) = P, 
C(n) = -Po 
Thus C(t) is a curve on the sphere joining P and -Po 
7. Let x = a cos t and y = b sin t. 
9. Let P, Q be two points on the sphere of radius a. It suffices to prove that 
f(P) = f(Q). By Exercises 5 and 6, there exists a curve C(t) on the sphere 
which joins P and Q, that is C(t) is defined on an interval, and there are two 
numbers tl and t2 such that C(t 1) = P and C(t2) = Q. In those exercises, 
we did it only for the sphere or radius 1, but you can do it for a sphere of 
arbitrary radius a by considering aC(t) instead of the C(t) in Exercises 5 or 
6. Now, it suffices to prove that the function f( C(t» is constant (as function 
of t). Take its derivative, get by the chain rule 
d 
dt f( C(t» = grad f( C(t»· C'(t) = h( C(t»C(t)· C(t). 
But C(t)2 = a2 because C(t) is on the sphere of radius a. Differentiating this 
with respect to t yields 2C(t)· C'(t) = 0, so C(t) · C'(t) = 0, which you plug in 
above to see that the derivative of f( C(t» = O. Hence f( C(t I»~ = f( C(t 2» so 
f(P) =f(Q)·
