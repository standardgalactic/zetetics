he Convention on the Rights of the Child 
was once described by Nelson Man-
dela as “that luminous living document 
that enshrines the rights of every child 
without exception to a life of dignity and self-
fulﬁ lment”.*
Almost a decade has passed since the ﬁ rst edition 
of UNICEF’s Implementation Handbook for the Con-
vention on the Rights of the Child was launched 
in January 1998 in Geneva. It has since become a 
well-known practical tool used by governments, 
UNICEF and other United Nations agencies, as well 
as  non-governmental organizations, human rights 
institutions and academics, to guide them on the 
implementation of the Convention.
That a fully revised third edition is needed already 
is a testimony to the energy and output of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. This Com-
mittee has been examining the reports of States 
party to the Convention for 14 years. Over that 
period it has developed a progressive and detai-
led interpretation of the implications for States of 
the Convention’s 42 substantive articles, and more 
recently of the two Optional Protocols to the Con-
vention, on sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography, and on the involvement of chil-
dren in armed conﬂ ict. 
Between 2001 and 2007, the Committee issued 
10 General Comments, authoritative statements 
of interpretation in relation to particular articles 
or areas of concern. In addition, the Committee’s 
general discussion of the Convention has become 
a key annual event that highlights important child 
rights issues, and recommendations from the Com-
mittee have led to two major United Nations stu-
dies: that led by Graça Machel on the impact of 
armed conﬂ ict on children, and the recent compre-
hensive global study on violence against children, 
led by Professor Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro.
If the Convention is to achieve its potential to trans-
form the lives of children worldwide, it needs to be 
well known and its binding obligations on States 
must be fully understood. We hope that this Hand-
book will continue to play a part in this process.

PREFACE
XIII
s the ﬁ rst seven chairpersons of 
the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, we welcome the pre-
paration and publication of this 
Implementation Handbook for the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. 
The Handbook provides a detailed reference for 
the implementation of law, policy and practice to 
promote and protect the rights of children. The 
Handbook brings together under each article an 
analysis of the Committee’s growing interpreta-
tion during its ﬁ rst fourteen years and the exam-
ination of over 300 of its Concluding Observations 
following consideration of States’ reports. It places 
these in the context of key comments, decisions 
and reports of the other treaty bodies and relevant 
United Nations bodies.
The Handbook also provides a concise description 
of the role, powers and procedures, and developing 
activities of the Committee and its appendices 
include a guide to related United Nations bodies 
and the texts of key international instruments. 
We hope that the Handbook will be widely used 
by all those involved in promoting the fullest pos-
sible implementation of the Convention – gover-
nments and governmental agencies, UNICEF and 
other United Nations organizations and bodies, 
international, regional and national NGOs and 
others. 
As the Committee noted in the report of its 
second session in 1992, its members are “solely 
accountable to the children of the world”. We 
hope this Handbook will help to bring the Con-
vention alive and encourage all those working 
with and for children to see implementation as 
more than a formal process. We hope it will be 
seen as the vivid and exciting process of working 
to improve the lives of the world’s children.

he idea of this Handbook was born in conver-
sations with past and present members of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
and with Bilgé Ögün Bassani, former Deputy 
Regional Director of UNICEF’s Regional Office for 
Europe in Geneva. We are grateful for the support 
and assistance we have received during the prepara-
tion of successive editions of the Handbook from the 
UNICEF Regional Office for Europe.
The production of this fully revised third edition was 
realized with the support of: Hans Olsen, Deputy 
Regional Director and Caroline Bakker, Project 
Officer at the Geneva Regional Office; Marta Santos 
Pais, Director, UNICEF’s Innocenti Research Centre 
in Florence and Susan Bissell, Chief, Implementing 
International Standards Unit at the Centre. The 
project was made possible thanks to a generous 
contribution of the Swedish Government.
Omissions and mistakes which remain are entirely our 
responsibility. We very much hope that those who 
use the Handbook will provide comments to UNICEF, 
to ensure that future editions are improved.  
First and foremost, we gratefully acknowledge the 
contribution of current and former members of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child.

● relevant provisions from other international 
instruments, for example from the Univer-
sal Declaration of Human Rights and the two 
International Covenants, on Civil and Political 
Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural

Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
of the two Optional Protocols adopted in 2000 as 
well as their interconnections. Under each article 
the Handbook brings together, analyses and sum-

as the highest authority for interpretation of 
the Convention, from the official reports of its 
44 sessions (1991 to February 2007), and rele-

and recommendations to States is to illustrate and 
expand interpretation of the Convention. Those 
who wish to analyse progress in particular States 
are encouraged to obtain the Initial Report and 
subsequent Periodic Reports of the State, together 
with the records of the Committee’s examination 
of these reports, and its Concluding Observations. 
The section on each article in the Handbook is 
structured to include:
● a concise summary of the article’s implications 
and its relationship with other articles; 
● detailed consideration of the background to 
and implications of individual elements of the 
article; 
● occasional boxed examples from official reports 
and recommendations (the Handbook has not 
attempted to analyse reports and other infor-
mation provided by non-governmental organi-
zations). These boxes are intended to illustrate 
and illuminate issues raised by the article; 
● a concluding “Implementation Checklist”: this 
poses questions designed to be used to investi-
gate progress towards implementation; it also 
emphasizes that the articles of the Convention 
are interdependent and identifies other closely 
related articles; 
● the appendices include the full texts of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the two 
Optional Protocols and other key instruments, 
and of the Committee’s Guidelines for Perio-
dic Reports (Revised 2005). In addition there is 
a guide to United Nations and United Nations-
related agencies, and a bibliography.
Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, 
Conventions of the International Labour Orga-
nization (ILO) and the Hague Conventions;
● relevant General Comments from other “Treaty 
Bodies”, the Committees responsible for super-
vising implementation of other international 
instruments including, in particular, the Human 
Rights Committee (responsible for the Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights) and the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (res-
ponsible for the Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights); 
● comments from the Manual on Human Rights 
Reporting, the 1997 edition of which includes 
a chapter by the first Rapporteur to the Com-
mittee on the Rights of the Child, Marta Santos 
Pais, on the Convention; 
● comments and recommendations from other 
key United Nations bodies and agencies, and 
conclusions and recommendations of global 
conferences on human rights and social devel-
opment. 
The Handbook does not include analysis of regio-
nal human rights instruments, nor does it cover 
international or regional legal case law. 
The role and activities of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child and the reporting obligations 
of States Parties under the Convention are covered 
under the relevant Convention articles – articles 43 
and 44. 
The Handbook is not intended as a guide to the 
progress of implementation in individual countries.

and evaluation and necessary training and so on. 
Further questions relate to the detail of implemen-
tation. 
The questions are drafted so that they can be 
answered “YES”, “NO”, “PARTIALLY” or “DON’T 
KNOW” (insufficient information available to assess 
implementation). Answering “yes” or “no” to the 
questions which make up each Checklist does not 
necessarily indicate compliance or non-compliance 
with the Convention. 
The Checklists can be used as the basis from which 
to develop more detailed and sensitive checklists 
for national or local use. Beyond the basic “YES”, 
“NO” or “DON’T KNOW” answers, the questions 
provide a framework for collecting together the 
relevant information to build up a full analysis of 
and commentary on implementation. 
So if the answer to a Checklist question is “YES”, a 
summary could follow of the relevant law, policy 
and practice, and references to more detailed 
information which confirms the realization of the 
particular right for all relevant children. If “NO”, 
an outline of the situation, and a summary of 
action required for compliance could be made. The 
answer “PARTIALLY” would be accompanied by 
information on the state of implementation, and 
on further action required. If the answer is “DON’T 
KNOW”, there could be a summary of available 
information and an outline of the gaps in infor-
mation which make it impossible to determine the 
state of implementation of the particular right.
he checklists have no official status. Each 
Checklist has been drafted to help all those 
involved in implementation – Governments, 
UNICEF and other United Nations agencies 
and international bodies, NGOs and others 
– to investigate the implications of the article for 
law, policy and practice and to promote and eva-
luate progress towards implementation. 
The Checklists concern implementation, not repor-
ting. They should not be confused with the offi-
cial Guidelines for reporting prepared by the Com-
mittee on the Rights of the Child to advise States 
parties in the preparation of Initial and Periodic 
Reports under the Convention.
Each Checklist includes a reminder that no arti-
cle should be considered in isolation – that the 
Convention is indivisible and its articles interde-
pendent. The Checklists emphasize that in imple-
menting each article, regard should be paid to the 
“general principles” highlighted by the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child and that other articles 
which are particularly closely related should be 
identified. 
Each Checklist starts with a question about “gene-
ral measures of implementation” for the article 
in question: have the responsible government 
departments and other agencies been identified 
and appropriately coordinated, has there been a 
comprehensive review and adoption of an imple-
mentation strategy, budgetary analysis and allo-
cation of resources, development of monitoring

Official reports of the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child
The following abbreviated versions of references 
to certain series of the official Reports of the Com-
mittee on the Rights of the Child are used in this 
Handbook.
Guidelines. Guidelines for Initial Reports; Guide-
lines for Periodic Reports, Revised Guidelines for 
Periodic Reports: these are the guidelines prepa-
red by the Committee for States Parties on the 
reports to be submitted under the Convention. 
The full titles are:
General Guidelines regarding the form and 
contents of initial reports to be submitted by Sta-
tes Parties under article 44, paragraph 1(a), of the 
Convention, (CRC/C/5, 15 October 1991);
General Guidelines regarding the form and 
contents of periodic reports to be submitted by 
States Parties under article 44, paragraph 1(b), of 
the Convention, (CRC/C/58, 20 November 1996, re-
vised 3 June 2005);
States Parties’ reports. States Parties must sub-
mit their Initial Report within two years of rati-
fying the Convention. Subsequently, every five 
years, States Parties must submit Periodic Reports, 
referred to in the Handbook as Second Report, 
Third Report, etc.
All Concluding Observations and Preliminary 
Observations on States Parties’ reports were in 
the series “CRC/C/15/Add. ...” until the Commit-
tee’s fortieth session (September/October 2005) 
when a new self-explanatory system of referen-
ces has been adopted in the United Nations docu-
mentation system and is used from that date in 
the Handbook. These include an abbreviation of 
the State Party’s name and the number of the 
report. For example “CRC/C/CHN/CO/2” denotes 
the Concluding Observations on China’s Second 
Report; 
“CRC/C/OPSC/CHN/CO/1” 
denotes 
the 
Concluding Observations on China’s Initial Report 
under the Optional Protocol on the sale of chil-
dren, child prostitution and child pornography.
Session reports. An official report is published 
following each of the sessions of the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child. In the Handbook the 
full reference is given, for example Report on the 
fifth session, January 1994, CRC/C/24, pp. 38 to 43.
General Comments. These are now referenced 
in the series: CRC/C/GC/1 – 10.
(Within the United Nations documentation system, 
special symbols have been established for each of 
the human rights Treaty Bodies. Thus the reference 
for all Committee on the Rights of the Child 
documents begins “CRC/C/...” An explanation of all 
United Nations human rights document symbols 
is available from the Office of the High Commiss-
ioner for Human Rights’ website: www.ohchr.org).

Travaux préparatoires: As yet, all reports of the 
“open-ended Working Group” which drafted 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child have 
not been published. The “open-ended Working 
Group” which drafted the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child was set up by the United Na-
tions Commission on Human Rights in 1979. Edited 
extracts from the official reports were published 
in 1992 in The United Nations Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, A Guide to the “Travaux 
préparatoires”, compiled and edited by Sharon 
Detrick, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. Where ex-
tracts from the Travaux préparatoires are quoted 
in the Handbook, the reference to the official 
United Nations document and also the book 
reference are given. 
On 11 June 2007, the United Nations, Save the Chil-
dren Sweden and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights launched 
Legislative History of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, volume 1 and volume 2. It provides 
a comprehensive record of the legislative history 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It 
contains the records of all meetings during a ten-
year period, up to and including the date when 
the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of 
the Child was approved in 1989. 
Manual on Human Rights Reporting: a first edition, 
covering major international human rights instru-
ments but not the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, was jointly published by the United Nations 
Centre for Human Rights and the United Nations 
Institute for Training and Research in 1991. 
A new edition, published in 1997, includes a section 
on “The Convention on the Rights of the Child” by 
Marta Santos Pais, who was first Rapporteur of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child (this edition 
is jointly published by the Office of the High Com-
missioner for Human Rights, Geneva; United Na-
tions Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR); 
United Nations Staff College Project, Turin; United 
Nations, Geneva, 1997). In the Handbook, the two 
editions are referred to as the Manual on Human 
Rights Reporting, 1991, and the Manual on Human

are required to set minimum ages for employ-
ment (article 32) and for criminal responsibility 
(article 40). The requirement to make primary 
education compulsory also implies setting an 
age (article 28). 
The Committee has emphasized that, when 
States define minimum ages in legislation, they 
must do so in the context of the basic principles 
within the Convention, in particular the prin-
ciple of non-discrimination (article 2, for exam-
ple challenging different marriage ages for boys 
and girls), as well as the principles of best inter-
ests of the child (article 3) and the right to life 
and maximum survival and development (article 
6). There must be respect for the child’s “evolv-
ing capacities” (article 5): in General Comment 
No. 7 on “Implementing child rights in early 
childhood”, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child underlines that “young children are hold-
ers of all the rights enshrined in the Convention. 
They are entitled to special protection measures 
and, in accordance with their evolving capacities, 
the progressive exercise of their rights” (CRC/C/
GC/7/Rev.1, para. 3). And there should be consis-
tency, for example, in the ages set for the comple-
tion of compulsory education and for admission 
to employment. 
rticle 1 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child defines “child” 
for the purposes of the Convention as 
every human being below the age of 
18. The wording leaves the starting point of child-
hood open. Is it birth, conception, or somewhere 
in between? Had the Convention taken a position 
on abortion and related issues, universal ratifi-
cation would have been threatened. For the pur-
poses of the Convention, childhood ends at the 
18th birthday unless, in a particular State, major-
ity is achieved earlier.
Setting an age for the acquisition of certain rights 
or for the loss of certain protections is a complex 
matter. It balances the concept of the child as a 
subject of rights whose evolving capacities must 
be respected (acknowledged in articles 5 and 
14) with the concept of the State’s obligation to 
provide special protection. On some issues, the 
Convention sets a clear line: no capital punish-
ment or life imprisonment without the possi-
bility of release for those under the age of 18 
(article 37); no recruitment into the armed forces 
or direct participation in hostilities for those 
under the age of 15 (article 38 and see Optional 
Protocol on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict, page 659). On other issues, States 
Text of Article 1
For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age 
of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.

the survival and development of the child” under 
article 6. 
For example, Argentina stated in a declaration: 
“Concerning article 1 of the Convention, the 
Argentine Republic declares that the article must 
be interpreted to the effect that a child means 
every human being from the moment of concep-
tion up to the age of 18.” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 13) 
The Holy See, in its declaration, “recognizes that 
the Convention represents an enactment of princi-
ples previously adopted by the United Nations and, 
once effective as a ratified instrument, will safe-
guard the rights of the child before as well as after 
birth, as expressly affirmed in the Declaration of 
the Rights of the Child and restated in the ninth 
preambular paragraph of the Convention. The 
Holy See remains confident that the ninth pre-
ambular paragraph will serve as the perspective 
through which the rest of the Convention will be 
interpreted, in conformity with article 31 of the 
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 
May 1969.” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 24)
The United Kingdom, in contrast, declared that it 
“interprets the Convention as applicable only fol-
lowing a live birth”. (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 42)
And Luxembourg stated: “The Government of 
Luxembourg declares that article 6 of the present 
Convention presents no obstacle to implementa-
tion of the provisions of Luxembourg legislation 
concerning sex information, the prevention of 
back-street abortion and the regulation of preg-
nancy termination.” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 28) The 
Committee on the Rights of the Child has sug-
gested that reservations to preserve state laws 
on abortion are unnecessary. It has commented 
adversely on high rates of abortion, on the use 
of abortion as a method of family planning and 
on “clandestine” abortions, and has encouraged 
measures to reduce the incidence of abortion. 
(For further discussion see article 6, page 85.) 
China made the following reservation: “The 
People’s Republic of China shall fulfil its obliga-
tions provided by article 6 of the Convention to the 
extent that the Convention is consistent with the 
provisions of article 25 concerning family plan-
ning of the Constitution of the People’s Republic 
of China and with the provisions of article 2 of the 
Law of Minor Children of the People’s Republic 
of China.” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 16)
The Committee, consistent with its general prac-
tice of urging all States to withdraw reservations, 
urged China to review and withdraw the reserva-
tion in its Concluding Observations on China’s 
Initial Report (China CRC/C/15/Add.56, para. 
24) and again, in 2005, commenting on China’s 
In its reporting guidelines, the Committee asks 
States Parties for information on the definition 
of the child in domestic legislation and to specify 
any differences between boys and girls. In com-
ments, it has encouraged States to review their 
definition of childhood and to raise the protec-
tive minimum ages, in particular those for sexual 
consent, admission to employment and criminal 
responsibility. It has emphasized that gender dis-
crimination should be eliminated. 
■
Starting point of childhood for 
purposes of Convention
Neither the 1924 nor the 1959 Declaration of the 
Rights of the Child defined the beginning or end 
of childhood. But the Convention’s Preamble 
draws attention to the statement in the Preamble 
to the 1959 Declaration “that the child, by rea-
son of his physical and mental immaturity needs 
special safeguards and care, including appropri-
ate legal protection, before as well as after birth” 
(editors’ emphasis).
As mentioned previously, the wording of article 1 
of the Convention avoids setting a starting point 
for childhood. The intention of those who drafted 
the article was to avoid taking a position on abor-
tion and other pre-birth issues, which would have 
threatened the Convention’s universal acceptance. 
The preambular statement from the 1959 Declar-
ation, quoted above, caused difficulties within 
the Working Group that drafted the Convention. 
In order to reach consensus, the Group agreed 
that a statement should be placed in the travaux 
préparatoires to the effect that “In adopting this 
preambular paragraph, the Working Group does 
not intend to prejudice the interpretation of art-
icle 1 or any other provision of the Convention 
by States Parties.” (E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 8 to 15; 
Detrick, p. 110)
Thus, the Convention leaves individual States to 
balance for themselves the conflicting rights and 
interests involved in issues such as abortion and 
family planning. And it is relevant to note that 
article 41 emphasizes that the Convention does 
not interfere with any domestic legislation (or 
applicable international law) “more conducive to 
the realization of the rights of the child...” 
Obviously most of the articles of the Convention 
can apply to the child only after birth. Various 
States have, however, found it necessary to lodge 
declarations or reservations underlining their 
own particular legislative and/or other attitudes 
to the unborn child, in particular in relation to the 
child’s “inherent right to life” and the State’s obli-
gation to “ensure to the maximum extent possible

“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party enact, as soon as possible, a clear legal 
definition of the child applicable throughout 
the country and review existing age limits in 
various areas, including marriage, child labour 
and the Penal Code provisions on child sexual 
abuse, in order to bring them into compliance 
with international standards.” (Sri Lanka 
CRC/C/15/Add.207, para. 22)
Commenting on the Second Periodic Report of 
Saudi Arabia in 2006, the Committee expressed 
concern 
“… that a judge has the discretionary power to 
decide that a child has reached majority at an 
earlier age”. 
It recommended
“… that the State Party take the necessary 
legislative and other measures to 
unequivocally set the age of majority at 18 
with no exception for specific cases, including 
within the juvenile justice system…” (Saudi 
Arabia CRC/C/SAU/CO/2, paras. 25 and 26)
Reviewing the Initial Report of Dominica, the 
Committee noted a distinction between “child” 
(under 14 years) and “young person” (between 14 
and 18 years). It went on to recommend
“… that the State Party ensure that, despite 
the current distinction between a child 
and a young person, both receive the same 
protection under the Convention.” 
(Dominica CRC/C/15/Add.238, para. 20) 
The Committee has also emphasized that defini-
tions of the child under local customary law must 
be consistent with article 1 (see, for example, 
Mozambique 
CRC/C/15/Add.172, 
paras. 
23 
and 24).
In a relevant General Comment on a provision 
concerning child protection in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Human 
Rights Committee emphasizes that protective ages 
must not be set “unreasonably low”, and that in 
any case a State Party cannot absolve itself under 
the Covenant from obligations to children under 
18 years old, even if they have reached the age of 
majority under domestic law.
Article 24 of the International Covenant recog-
nizes the right of every child, without any dis-
crimination, to receive from his or her family, 
society and the State the protection required by 
his or her status as “a minor”. The Covenant does 
not define “minor”, nor does it indicate the age at 
which a child should attain majority. In its 1989 
General Comment No. 17 the Human Rights 
Committee states: “This is to be determined by 
each State Party in the light of the relevant social 
and cultural conditions. In this respect, States

CO/2, paras. 8 and 9).
In its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing 
child rights in early childhood”, the Committee 
emphasizes that young children are holders of all 
the rights enshrined in the Convention:
“… They are entitled to special protection 
measures and, in accordance with their 
evolving capacities,the progressive exercise 
of their rights. The Committee is concerned 
that in implementing their obligations under 
the Convention, States Parties have not given 
sufficient attention to young children as 
rights holders and to the laws, policies and 
programmes required to realize their rights 
during this distinct phase of their childhood. 
The Committee reaffirms that the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child is to be applied 
holistically in early childhood, taking account 
of the principle of the universality, indivisibility 
and interdependence of all human rights.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 7, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 3)
The Committee provides a “working definition” 
of early childhood:
“In its consideration of rights in early 
childhood, the Committee wishes to include 
all young children: at birth and through 
infancy; during the pre-school years; as well 
as during the transition to school. Accordingly, 
the Committee proposes as an appropriate 
working definition of early childhood the 
period from birth to the age of 8 years; 
States Parties should review their obligations 
towards young children in the context of this 
definition.” (CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, paras. 3 and 4)
The end of childhood
For the purposes of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, childhood ends and majority is 
achieved at the 18th birthday “unless, under the 
law applicable to the child, majority is attained 
earlier”. Thus the Convention is more prescrip-
tive, but not inflexible, about defining for its pur-
poses the end of childhood. 
In its 2003 General Comment No. 4 on 
“Adolescent health and development in the context 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child”, the 
Committee emphasizes that “adolescents up to 18 
years old are holders of all the rights enshrined in 
the Convention; they are entitled to special pro-
tection measures, and, according to their evolv-
ing capacities, they can progressively exercise 
their rights (art. 5)”. (CRC/GC/2003/4, para. 1)
The Committee has encouraged States to review 
the age of majority if set below 18, and in particu-
lar to raise protective ages. For example:

with higher ages of majority should lower them, 
acknowledging that the definition in article 1 is 
“for the purposes of the … Convention”.
Reviewing the definition of “child”
In most societies, until they ratified the 
Convention, there had been no comprehensive 
consideration of the various laws defining child-
hood. Article 1 provokes such a review of all rele-
vant legislation in each State Party. The Guidelines 
for Periodic Reports (revised 2005) requests States 
Parties “to provide updated information with 
respect to article 1 of the Convention, concern-
ing the definition of a child under their domestic 
laws and regulations, specifying any differences 
between girls and boys” (CRC/C/58/Rev.1, para. 
19). The Committee continues to encourage States 
which have not done so to review and harmonize 
laws with the Convention’s definition. 
Defining specific minimum 
ages in legislation
The original Guidelines for Periodic Reports 
(CRC/C/58) requested information on “the mini-
mum legal age defined by the national legisla-
tion” for various listed purposes (see box). Many 
of the issues covered relate to other articles in the 
Convention; further interpretation and discussion 
will be found in the sections of this Handbook on 
those articles.
should indicate in their reports the age at which 
the child attains his majority in civil matters and 
assumes criminal responsibility. States should 
also indicate the age at which a child is legally 
entitled to work and the age at which he is treated 
as an adult under labour law. States should fur-
ther indicate the age at which a child is considered 
adult for the purposes of article 10, paragraphs 2 
and 3 [which cover separate treatment for juve-
nile offenders]. However, the Committee notes 
that the age for the above purposes should not be 
set unreasonably low and that in any case a State 
Party cannot absolve itself from its obligations 
under the Covenant regarding persons under the 
age of 18, notwithstanding that they have reached 
the age of majority under domestic law.” (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 17, 
1989, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 4, p. 184)
During the drafting of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, some States’ representatives 
argued unsuccessfully for an age lower than 18 to 
be set. However, the view that the age should be 
set high to afford greater protection prevailed (see 
E/CN.4/L.1542, pp. 5 and 6; Detrick, pp. 115 and 
116). The text allows States in which majority is 
attained before the age of 18 to substitute a lower 
age for particular purposes – provided doing so is 
consistent with the whole of the Convention, and 
in particular with its general principles. Equally, 
the Convention itself does not insist that States

the Child requested States Parties to provide relevant information, with respect to article 1, on the

And the Convention emphasizes the importance 
of respecting children’s “evolving capacities” 
(article 5, see page 77; also article 14, see page 
185). Some States, in addition to setting in legis-
lation certain ages for the acquisition of particu-
lar rights, include in their law a flexible concept 
of the child’s evolving capacities so that children 
acquire rights to make decisions for themselves 
on certain matters once they have acquired “suf-
ficient understanding”. The advantage of such 
formulas is that they avoid rigid age barriers; the 
disadvantage is that they leave judgements on 
when children have acquired sufficient under-
standing to adults, who may not respect the con-
cept of evolving capacities.
The Committee has emphasized consistently that 
in setting minimum ages, States must have regard 
to the entire Convention and in particular to its 
general principles. There must be no discrimina-
tion, the child’s best interests must be a primary 
consideration and the child’s maximum survival 
and development must be ensured. 
The importance of the non-discrimination prin-
ciple (article 2) in relation to the definition of the 
child is stressed in the Committee’s Guidelines 
for Periodic Reports (Revised 2005), which asks 
for States to specify any differences between girls 
and boys (CRC/C/58/Rev.1, para. 19). 
In relation to monitoring implementation of the 
whole Convention, the Committee has underlined 
The request for information on minimum 
legal ages does not imply that the Convention 
requires a specific age to be set in each case. The 
Committee is simply seeking information on how 
domestic law defines the child. In general, min-
imum ages that are protective should be set as 
high as possible (for example protecting children 
from hazardous labour, criminalization, custo-
dial sentences or involvement in armed conflict). 
Minimum ages that relate to the child gaining 
autonomy and to the need for the State to respect 
the child’s civil rights and evolving capacities, 
demand a more flexible system, sensitive to the 
needs of the individual child.
Some “minimum age” issues relate both to 
increased autonomy and to protection. For 
example, the child’s right to seek legal and medi-
cal counselling and to lodge complaints without 
parental consent, and to give testimony in court, 
may be crucial to protection from violence within 
the family. It is not in the child’s interests that any 
minimum age should be defined for such pur-
poses.
The Convention provides a framework of princi-
ples; it does not provide direction on the specific 
age, or ages, at which children should acquire 
such rights. Under article 12, children capa-
ble of forming views have the right to express 
their views freely in all matters affecting them. 
Their views must be given “due weight in accor-
dance with the age and maturity of the child”. 
Lodging complaints and seeking redress before a court or other relevant authority without 
parental consent;
Participating in administrative and judicial proceedings affecting the child;

tions, adoption, guardianship;

Legal capacity to inherit, to conduct property transactions;
To create and join associations;

Consumption of alcohol and other controlled substances;
How the minimum age for employment relates to the age of completion of compulsory school-
ing, how it affects the right of the child to education and how relevant international instruments 
are taken into account;
In cases where there is a difference in the legislation between girls and boys, including in rela-
tion to marriage and sexual consent, the extent to which article 2 of the Convention has been

In cases where the criteria of puberty is used under criminal law, the extent to which this pro-
vision is differently applied to girls and boys, and whether the principles and provisions of the 
Convention are taken into consideration.”

to participate in proceedings relating to separa-
tion from parents under article 9. 
Medical counselling. The child’s right to 
receive medical counselling without paren-
tal consent is vital in cases in which the child’s 
views and/or interests are distinct from, or may 
be in conflict with, those of parents – for exam-
ple cases of violence by parents and other family 
members; cases involving child/parent conflicts 
over access to health services and treatment deci-
sions, and the adolescent child’s access to family 
planning education and services. The child’s right 
to advice and counselling is distinct from consid-
eration of the age at which the child may acquire 
an independent right to consent to medical treat-
ment – see below.
Article 24(2)(e) requires States to take appropri-
ate measures to ensure that children as well as 
parents “are informed, have access to education 
and are supported in the use of basic knowledge 
of child health and nutrition, the advantages of 
breastfeeding, hygiene and environmental sanita-
tion and the prevention of accidents”.
In its General Comment No. 4 on “Adolescent 
health and development in the context of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child”, the 
Committee proposes:
“In light of articles 3, 17 and 24 of the 
Convention, States Parties should provide 
adolescents with access to sexual and 
reproductive information, including on family 
planning and contraceptives, the dangers of 
early pregnancy, the prevention of HIV/AIDS 
and the prevention and treatment of sexually 
transmitted diseases (STDs). In addition, States 
Parties should ensure that they have access to 
appropriate information, regardless of their 
marital status and whether their parents or 
guardians consent. It is essential to find proper 
means and methods of providing information 
that is adequate and sensitive to the 
particularities and specific rights of adolescent 
girls and boys…
“With regard to privacy and confidentiality, 
and the related issue of informed consent to 
treatment, States Parties should 
(a) enact laws or regulations to ensure that 
confidential advice concerning treatment 
is provided to adolescents so that they can 
give their informed consent. Such laws or 
regulations should stipulate an age for this 
process, or refer to the evolving capacity of the 
child; and 
(b) provide training for health personnel 
on the rights of adolescents to privacy and 
confidentiality, to be informed about planned 
treatment and to give their informed consent 
to treatment”. (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, General Comment No. 4, 2003, CRC/
GC/2003/4, paras. 28 and 33.See also paras. 39 
the importance of collecting consistent data on all 
children up to 18.
The list of minimum legal ages the Committee 
requested 
information 
on 
in 
its 
original 
Guidelines for Periodic Reports (CRC/C/58) is by 
no means comprehensive. During consideration 
of initial and periodic reports from States Parties, 
the following additional age-related issues have 
been raised: voting age and the minimum age for 
standing in elections; age at which a child can 
independently acquire a passport; age limitations 
on access to certain media (films, videos, etc.); 
age at which a child can join a religious order or 
community for life.
The next section covers the various issues listed 
in the original Guidelines for Periodic Reports 
on which the Committee seeks information under 
article 1 (see box).
Legal or medical counselling 
without parental consent
While the Guidelines seeks information on any 
“minimum legal age defined by the national 
legislation”, the Convention provides no sup-
port for setting a minimum age below which the 
child cannot seek and receive independent legal 
or medical counselling. The purpose of the ques-
tion is to determine which, if any, children are 
excluded from this right. The right to seek advice 
does not in itself imply a right to make decisions, 
which would be dependent on the child’s evolving 
capacities.
Legal counselling. The child’s right to receive 
legal counselling without parental consent is 
clearly vital to the enforcement of many rights 
guaranteed under the Convention, including 
some where the child’s interests are distinct from, 
or may even be in conflict with, those of the par-
ent, for example: in cases of violence to chil-
dren, including sexual abuse, within the family 
and in institutions; in cases of dispute over chil-
dren’s rights to a name or a nationality; in cases 
involving separation from parents, family reuni-
fication, illicit transfer and abduction, adoption, 
exploi-tation in employment and other forms of 
exploitation. 
The child’s own right to legal assistance when 
alleged as or accused of having infringed the 
penal law is referred to in article 40(2)(b)(ii). 
Similarly, the child whose liberty is restricted 
has the right to “prompt access to legal and other 
appropriate assistance...” under article 37(d). It is 
also necessary for children to be able to receive 
legal counselling when exercising their right to 
be heard in “any judicial and administrative pro-
ceedings affecting the child...” (article 12(2)), and

minimum ages should be raised, and, further, has 
frequently recommended that States should ratify 
the relevant International Labour Organization’s 
Conventions on minimum ages for employment 
(see article 32, page 481).
Sexual consent
In most countries, a minimum age is set below 
which children are judged incapable of consent-
ing to any form of sexual activity with others. 
The definition of sexual abuse and exploitation 
includes not only conduct involving violence or 
other forms of coercion, but also all sexual con-
duct with a child below a certain age, even when 
it was or appeared to be consensual (see also 
article 19, page 257 and article 34, page 523). 
Consequently sexual intercourse with a child 
below the age of consent renders the perpetrator 
automatically liable to the charge of rape. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
emphasized the importance of setting a minimum 
age below which a child’s consent is not to be con-
sidered valid. In its General Comment No. 4 on 
“Adolescent health and development in the context 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child”, the 
Committee refers to the need to set a minimum 
age for sexual consent and marriage (see below) 
and states: 
“These minimum ages should be the same for 
boys and girls (article 2 of the Convention) and 
closely reflect the recognition of the status of 
human beings under 18 years of age as rights 
holders, in accordance with their evolving 
capacity, age and maturity (arts. 5 and 12 
to 17).” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 4, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/4, 
para. 9)
The Committee has proposed to various coun-
tries that the age set for sexual consent should 
be raised, but has not proposed that it should be 
raised to 18.
It may be assumed that the status of marriage 
implies an ability to consent to sex with one’s 
partner. The original Guidelines for Periodic 
Reports asks whether the non-discrimination 
requirements of the Convention’s article 2 have 
been given ample consideration “in cases where 
there is a difference in the legislation between 
girls and boys, including in relation to marriage 
and sexual consent...” (CRC/C/58, para. 24)
The Committee has expressed concern at dispari-
ties between ages of consent to heterosexual and 
to homosexual activities, which amount to dis-
crimination on grounds of sexual orientation:
“... concern is expressed at the insufficient 
efforts made to provide against discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. While the 
and 41. For full text of General Comments see 
www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/comments.htm.)
Medical treatment or surgery 
without parental consent
Some countries have set an age at which a child 
can give valid consent, or withhold consent, to 
medical treatment. Legislation in other countries 
provides that children acquire independent rights 
to consent and to withhold consent once they are 
judged to have “sufficient understanding”; in 
some cases, legislation also defines a minimum 
age at which maturity should be assumed. 
In its General Comment No. 4, referred to above, 
the Committee states that if an adolescent is of 
sufficient maturity, 
“… informed consent shall be obtained from 
the adolescent her/himself, while informing 
the parents if that is in the ‘best interest of the 
child’ (art. 3)”. (CRC/GC/2003/4, para. 32) 
In some countries, legislation enables courts to 
intervene and order medical treatment of a child 
in cases where a parent has refused consent, per-
haps on cultural or religious grounds. This inter-
vention would be justified under the Convention 
by article 3(1) and (2).
When compulsory education ends
Article 28(1)(a) and (b) require States to achieve 
the child’s right to education “progressively and 
on the basis of equal opportunity”; primary edu-
cation must be compulsory, and the develop-
ment of different forms of secondary education 
must be encouraged and made “available and 
accessible to every child”. The ages of primary 
and secondary education are not defined by the 
Convention (see article 28, page 424). Article 32 
requires States to protect the child from any work 
that is likely to interfere with the child’s educa-
tion. The Committee on the Rights of the Child 
has indicated the need to coordinate the age at 
which compulsory education ends with the age for 
access to full-time employment (see also article 
32, page 495). In several cases, the Committee has 
expressed concern at “discrepancies” between the 
ages and proposed “an equal age” (see page 496).
Admission to employment or work, 
including hazardous work, 
part-time and full-time work
Article 32 requires States to protect children from 
“any work that is likely to be hazardous or to 
interfere with the child’s education”, to “provide 
for a minimum age or minimum ages for admis-
sion to employment” and to “provide for appro-
priate regulation of the hours and conditions of 
employment”. The Committee on the Rights of 
the Child has in several cases recommended that

Recommendation No. 21, 1994, HRI/GEN/1/
Rev.8, para. 36, p. 315, see below, page 9). 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
repeatedly emphasized to many States Parties 
that the age of marriage for both girls and boys 
must be the same to conform with article 2 of the 
Convention. For example:
“The Committee is concerned at the low legal 
minimum age for marriage and that different 
legal ages for marriage are set for girls (14) 
and boys (16).
“The Committee encourages the State Party 
to increase the minimum age of marriage for 
girls and for boys and that it set this minimum 
age at an equal and internationally acceptable 
level. The State Party is also advised to 
undertake awareness-raising campaigns and 
other measures to prevent early marriages…” 
(Mexico CRC/C/MEX/CO/3, paras. 21 and 22)
The Committee has also expressed concern about 
discriminatory situations in which different laws 
may provide different marriage ages within one 
State – thus asserting its view that the general 
principles of the Convention should override the 
cultural and religious background to such dis-
crimination. 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in 
article 16, states that men and women “of full 
age” have the right to marry and to found a fam-
ily. The Convention on Consent to Marriage, 
Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of 
Marriages (1962) does not set a minimum age for 
marriage. It notes this in its Preamble and goes on 
to reaffirm that all States should take all appro-
priate measures to eliminate completely child 
marriages and the betrothal of young girls before 
the age of puberty. Its article 2 requires States 
Parties to “take legislative action to specify a 
minimum age for marriage. No marriage shall be 
legally entered into by any person under this age, 
except where a competent authority has granted a 
dispensation as to age, for serious reasons, in the 
interests of the intending spouses.”
As noted above, in 1994 the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW) made a General Recommendation on 
equality in marriage and family relations, which 
proposes that the minimum age for marriage 
should be 18 for both women and men. Within the 
Recommendation, CEDAW analyses three art-
icles in the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women that have 
special significance for the status of women in the 
family, as a contribution to the International Year 
of the Family (1994). Article 16 of the Convention 
requires States to take all appropriate measures 
Committee notes the Isle of Man’s intention 
to reduce the legal age for consent to 
homosexual relations from 21 to 18 years, 
it remains concerned about the disparity 
that continues to exist between the ages 
for consent to heterosexual (16 years) and 
homosexual relations.
“It is recommended that the Isle of Man 
take all appropriate measures, including of a 
legislative nature, to prevent discrimination 
based on the grounds of sexual orientation 
and to fully comply with article 2 of the 
Convention.” (United Kingdom – Isle of Man 
CRC/C/15/Add.134, paras. 22 and 23. See also 
United Kingdom – Overseas Territories 
CRC/C/15/Add.135, paras. 25 and 26) 
Marriage
In many societies, an age is set when children 
may marry without parental consent (usually the 
age of majority), and a lower age is set when they 
may marry with parental consent. In some societ-
ies, marriage is permitted in exceptional cases at 
an earlier age with the permission of a court or 
other authority, for example when a girl is preg-
nant or has a child. Marriage age is of particu-
lar significance because in many countries upon 
marrying children are assumed to acquire major-
ity and thus to lose their protective rights under 
the Convention. 
In its General Comment No. 4 on “Adolescent 
health and development in the context of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child”, the 
Committee expresses concern 
“… that early marriage and pregnancy are 
significant factors in health problems related 
to sexual and reproductive health. Both the 
legal minimum age and the actual age of 
marriage, particularly for girls, are still very 
low in several States Parties. There are also 
non-health-related concerns: children who 
marry, especially girls, are often obliged 
to leave the education system and are 
marginalized from social activities. Further, 
in some States Parties married children are 
legally considered adults, even if they are 
under 18, depriving them of all the special 
protection measures they are entitled under 
the Convention. The Committee strongly 
recommends that States Parties review, and 
where necessary, reform their legislation and 
practice to increase the minimum age for 
marriage with and without parental consent to 
18 years, for both girls and boys.” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 4, 
2003, CRC/GC/2003/4, para. 20) 
The Committee refers to a similar recommen-
dation, that the minimum age should be 18, 
made by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women in 1994 (General

Voluntary enlistment and 
conscription into armed forces; 
participation in hostilities
Article 38 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child requires States to refrain from recruit-
ing into their armed forces anyone who has not 
attained the age of 15, and, in recruiting children 
between the ages of 15 and 18, “to give priority to 
those who are oldest”. In addition States Parties 
must “take all feasible measures to ensure that 
persons who have not attained the age of fifteen 
years do not take a direct part in hostilities”. In 
May 2000 the United Nations General Assembly 
adopted the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the involvement of children in armed con-
flict to increase protection and the Committee 
encourages all States Parties to sign and rat-
ify the Protocol without delay. The Optional 
Protocol entered into force in 2002. It requires 
States Parties to it to ensure that nobody under 
the age of 18 is recruited compulsorily into their 
armed forces and to “take all feasible measures” 
to ensure that under-18-year-old members of their 
armed forces do not take a direct part in hostili-
ties. States must take all feasible measures to pre-
vent recruitment and use in hostilities of children 
under 18 years by armed groups. States Parties to 
the Optional Protocol must raise “in years” the 
minimum age for voluntary recruitment, set at 
15 in the Convention (for full discussion, see 
page 659). 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
commended States that have set a higher age limit 
on recruitment than 15 and that have ratified the 
Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. 
The Committee has stated clearly that it believes 
there should be no involvement in hostilities and 
no recruitment into the armed forces of anyone 
under 18 years old.
Criminal responsibility
Article 40(3)(a) of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child proposes “the establishment of a 
minimum age below which children shall be pre-
sumed not to have the capacity to infringe the 
penal law”. 
In its General Comment No. 10 on “Children’s 
rights in Juvenile Justice”, the Committee urges 
States not to set the minimum age at too low a 
level and to continue to raise the age to an inter-
nationally acceptable level (CRC/C/GC/10, paras. 
30 et seq.; for full discussion, see article 40, 
page 601). It is clear, from the Initial and Periodic 
to eliminate discrimination against women in all 
matters relating to marriage and family relations. 
Paragraph 2 requires that “The betrothal and the 
marriage of a child shall have no legal effect, and 
all necessary action, including legislation, shall 
be taken to specify a minimum age for marriage 
and to make the registration of marriages in an 
official registry compulsory.”
CEDAW comments: “In the Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action adopted by the World 
Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna 
from 14 to 25 June 1993, States are urged to repeal 
existing laws and regulations and to remove cus-
toms and practices which discriminate against 
and cause harm to the girl child. Article 16(2) and 
the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child preclude States Parties from permitting 
or giving validity to a marriage between persons 
who have not attained their majority. In the con-
text of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
‘a child means every human being below the age 
of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the 
child, majority is attained earlier’.
“Notwithstanding this definition, and bearing in 
mind the provisions of the Vienna Declaration, 
the Committee considers that the minimum age 
for marriage should be 18 years for both man 
and woman. When men and women marry, they 
assume important responsibilities. Consequently, 
marriage should not be permitted before they 
have attained full maturity and capacity to act. 
According to the World Health Organization, 
when minors, particularly girls, marry and have 
children, their health can be adversely affected 
and their education is impeded. As a result their 
economic autonomy is restricted...
“Some countries provide for different ages for 
marriage for men and women. As such provisions 
assume incorrectly that women have a differ-
ent rate of intellectual development from men, or 
that their stage of physical and intellectual devel-
opment at marriage is immaterial, these provi-
sions should be abolished. In other countries, the 
betrothal of girls or undertakings by family mem-
bers on their behalf is permitted. Such measures 
contravene not only the Convention, but also a 
woman’s right freely to choose her partner.
“States Parties should also require the registra-
tion of all marriages whether contracted civ-
illy or according to custom or religious law. The 
State can thereby ensure compliance with the 
Convention and establish equality between part-
ners, a minimum age for marriage, prohibition of 
bigamy and polygamy and the protection of the 
rights of children.” (Committee on the Elimination

Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child

General Comment No. 10 on “Children’s rights in 
Juvenile Justice”, the Committee re-emphasizes 
the Convention’s requirement that deprivation of 
liberty must in all circumstances only be used 
as a measure of last resort, and provides detailed 
guidance, including on pre-trial detention (CRC/
C/GC/10, paras. 78 et seq.; for full discussion see 
article 37, page 547).
In article 9, the principle that a child shall only 
be separated from his or her parents when such 
separation “is necessary for the best interests of 
the child” places further limits on restriction of 
liberty away from the family.
The original Guidelines for Periodic Reports 
requests information on the minimum legal age 
defined in the national legislation for “Deprivation 
of liberty, including by arrest, detention and 
imprisonment, inter alia in the areas of adminis-
tration of justice, asylum seeking and placement 
of children in welfare and health institutions” 
(CRC/C/58, para. 24; see also article 37, page 
557). This emphasizes that article 37 applies to 
any restriction of liberty of the child, not just to 
that occurring within the penal system.
Capital punishment and life 
imprisonment
Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child bars the imposition of capital punish-
ment and life imprisonment without the possi-
bility of release for offences committed before 
the age of 18. In several cases, the Committee 
has expressed concern at breaches of this clear 
prohibition. In addition, the Committee has 
expressed concern at situations in which the law 
technically still allows capital punishment of 
those under the age of 18, although the sentence 
is not applied in practice, and at situations where 
suspended sentences of death are permitted for 
under-18-year-olds (see article 6, page 88 and 
article 37, page 554).
Giving testimony in court, in civil 
and criminal cases
Article 12(2) requires that the child shall have 
the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and 
administrative proceedings that affect him or 
her. Here again, the Convention does not suggest 
that a minimum age be set; the Committee seeks 
information on whether children below a certain 
age are barred from being heard in either civil or 
criminal cases. 
Civil cases involving children include those con-
cerned with custody and the upbringing of chil-
dren, including separation from parents, adoption 
and so forth.
Reports of States Parties and from the reports of 
discussions with the Committee, that the defini-
tion of the age of criminal responsibility is often 
blurred. In some States, it appears, paradoxically, 
that children can be liable under criminal law for 
major offences at a younger age than they can be 
liable for minor offences.
The Committee has, in several cases, underlined 
that a minimum age must be defined in legisla-
tion. For many States, the Committee has urged 
that the age should be raised, and the Committee 
has welcomed proposals to set the age at 18. For 
example:
“The Committee urges the State Party to raise 
the minimum age of criminal responsibility 
and to ensure that children aged 15 to 18 years 
are accorded the protection of juvenile justice 
provisions and are not treated as adults...” 
(Ethiopia CRC/C/15/Add.144, para. 29)
“The Committee notes that the age of criminal 
responsibility has been raised from 7 to 10 
years, but continues to be concerned that the 
age of criminal responsibility remains low and 
unclear, with different ages mentioned in 
various legislations.
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party raise the legal age of criminal 
responsibility to an internationally more 
acceptable age by amending its legislation 
in this regard and ensuring that all children 
below 18 years are accorded the protection of 
juvenile justice provisions.” (Cyprus CRC/C/15/
Add.205, paras. 23 and 24)
The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules 
for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, the 
“Beijing Rules”, proposes in rule 4: “In those 
legal systems recognizing the concept of the age 
of criminal responsibility for juveniles, the begin-
ning of that age shall not be fixed at too low an 
age level, bearing in mind the facts of emotional, 
mental and intellectual maturity.” (For further 
discussion, see article 40, page 617.)
Deprivation of liberty; imprisonment
Article 37(b) requires that “no child shall be 
deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or 
arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprison-
ment of a child shall be in conformity with the 
law and shall be used only as a measure of last 
resort and for the shortest appropriate period of 
time”. While the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child sets no lower age limit on restriction of lib-
erty, it is clear from the Committee’s comments 
that it believes that the minimum age should be 
set in relation to the other basic principles of the 
Convention, and in particular to articles 2, 3 and 
6; and the Committee has expressed concern at 
restriction of the liberty of young children. In its

DEFINITION OF THE CHILD

Criminal cases involving children include those in 
which the child gives evidence, including when the 
child is being prosecuted for a criminal offence; 
cases in which others are being prosecuted for 
offences against the child; and cases involving 
other parties when the child is a witness. In rela-
tion to children alleged as or accused of having 
infringed the penal law, under article 40(2)(b)(iv) 
they must not be compelled to give testimony. 
The Committee has noted the importance of 
enabling children to give evidence in cases 
involving the prevention of violence and exploita-
tion, including the sexual exploitation of children. 
It has commended States that have made special 
arrangements to hear evidence from children in 
such cases (see article 19, page 269).
In 2005 the Economic and Social Council of the 
United Nations adopted Guidelines on Justice in 
Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses 
of Crime “as a useful framework that could assist 
Member States in enhancing the protection of 
child victims and witnesses in the criminal jus-
tice system” (Economic and Social Council reso-
lution 2005/20, 22 July 2005).
Lodging complaints and seeking 
redress without parental consent 
before a court or other authority
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
indicated that the full implementation of article 
12 requires the child to have access to complaints 
procedures (see page 158). The child’s ability to 
lodge complaints and seek redress without paren-
tal consent before a court is particularly impor-
tant in relation to complaints concerning violence 
or exploitation, including sexual exploitation, 
within the family. There is no suggestion in the 
Convention that children below a certain age 
should not be able to lodge complaints or apply to 
courts or other bodies for redress, with or without 
parental consent; any decision to exclude a child 
from such rights would have to be made in the 
context of the general principles including non-
discrimination and best interests.
Participating in administrative 
and judicial procedures affecting 
the child
As noted above, article 12(2) of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child requires that the child is 
provided with an opportunity to be heard in any 
judicial and administrative proceedings affecting 
him or her. The Convention sets no age limit on 
this right (see article 12, page 153 and article 9, 
page 129).
Giving consent to change of 
identity, including change of name, 
modification of family relations, 
adoption, guardianship
Article 8 of the Convention requires respect for 
the right of the child to preserve his or her iden-
tity, including nationality, name and family rela-
tions. The Convention does not suggest that there 
should be a minimum age for recognition of this 
right. It appears that very few States have defined 
in legislation arrangements for the child’s consent 
in relation to all aspects of changing identity. 
Many States indicated in Initial Reports that they 
have established an age at which the child has a 
right to consent or refuse consent to his or her 
adoption. The Committee has welcomed moves 
to reduce the age at which the child’s consent is 
required for adoption (see article 21, page 295).
Having access to information about 
the child’s biological family
Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child requires that the child has “as far as pos-
sible, the right to know ... his or her parents”. The 
right to knowledge of biological parents is of par-
ticular importance to adopted children and chil-
dren born through artificial means of conception. 
In many States, legislation places limits both on 
the information made available to the child and 
the age at which any information is available to 
the child. Implementation of this right depends 
on sufficient information being included in the 
registration of the child’s birth and on how the 
information is made accessible to the child (see 
article 7, page 105). In many States adopted 
children up to the age of 18 do not have a right 
of access to information about their biologi-
cal parents, which the Committee has suggested 
breaches article 7 (see article 7, page 107).
Legal capacity to inherit, to conduct 
property transactions
In some States the capacity to inherit and to con-
duct property transactions is achieved only with 
majority and/or on marriage; in others, vari-
ous ages are set in legislation. Where minimum 
ages are set, they should be consistent with the 
Convention’s general principles, in particular of 
non-discrimination and the best interests of the 
child. 
The Committee on the Elimination of Discri-
mination against Women (CEDAW), in a General 
Recommendation, notes that, in many countries, 
law and practice concerning inheritance and 
property result in serious discrimination against 
women: “... Women may receive a smaller share 
of the husband’s or father’s property at his death 
than would widowers and sons” (Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against

Women, General Recommendation No. 21, 
1994, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 35, p. 314). Such 
discrimination may also affect those under 18 
years old, in which case it raises an issue under 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 
Committee on the Rights of the Child has com-
mented on discrimination in inheritance (see art-
icle 2, page 31).
Legal capacity to create or join 
associations
The child’s right to freedom of association is rec-
ognized in the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child under article 15, and the Committee has 
emphasized that this right is linked to articles 12 
and 13 in realizing the child’s rights to partici-
pation.
Some States indicated in their Initial Reports that 
there is an age below which children are not per-
mitted to join associations or to do so without the 
agreement of their parents. The Convention pro-
vides no support for arbitrary limitations on the 
child’s right to freedom of association (see article 
15, page 197).
Choosing a religion; attending 
religious education in school
Article 14 requires respect for the child’s right 
to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 
Some States now have legislation specifically 
upholding the child’s right to freedom of religion. 
In others, an age is specified when decisions con-
cerning religious upbringing and education trans-
fer from the parent to the child. In States in which 
religious education is allowed in schools, there 
may be provisions in legislation allowing students 
to opt out of particular religious teaching and/or 
worship, and/or giving them a right to alternative 
teaching. Article 14(2) requires States to respect 
the rights and duties of parents “to provide direc-
tion to the child in the exercise of his or her right 
in a manner consistent with the evolving capaci-
ties of the child” (see article 14, page 188).
Consumption of alcohol and other 
controlled substances
Article 33 requires States to take “all appropri-
ate measures, including legislative, administra-
tive, social and educational measures, to protect 
children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs 
and psychotropic substances as defined in the 
relevant international treaties…” Many States 
have made it an offence to sell alcohol and 
tobacco products and any other controlled sub-
stances to children below a certain age. The set-
ting of such ages should be related to the basic 
principles of articles 2, 3 and 6 (see article 33, 
page 503).

“any distinction, exclusion, restriction or prefer-
ence which is based on any ground such as race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth 
or other status, and which has the purpose or 
effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, 
enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal 
footing, of all rights and freedoms”.
The non-discrimination principle does not bar 
affirmative action, the legitimate differentia-
tion in treatment of individual children; a Human 
Rights Committee General Comment empha-
sizes that States will often have to take affirma-
tive action to diminish or eliminate conditions 
that cause or help to perpetuate discrimination. 
In its Preamble, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child recognizes that “in all countries in 
the world, there are children living in exception-
ally difficult conditions, and that such children 
need special consideration…” In this respect, 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
he first paragraph of article 2, along 
with article 3(2) and article 4, sets out 
the fundamental obligations of States 
Parties in relation to the rights outlined 
in the remainder of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child – to “respect and ensure” all the 
rights in the Convention to all children in their 
jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind. 
“Non-discrimination” has been identified by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child as a general 
principle of fundamental importance for imple-
mentation of the whole Convention. In a number 
of General Comments, the Committee has set out 
the implications of applying the principle in rela-
tion to various issues and groups of children. The 
Committee has emphasized the importance of 
collecting disaggregated data in order to monitor 
the extent of discrimination. 
In a relevant General Comment, the Human 
Rights Committee proposes that the term “dis-
crimination” should be understood to imply 
Text of Article 2
1. States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to 
each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the 
child’s or his or her parent’s or legal guardian’s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political 
or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.
2. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected 
against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, 
expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child’s parents, legal guardians, or family members.

consistently underlined the need to give special 
attention to disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.
The implications of discrimination in relation to 
particular rights of the child are covered in this 
Implementation Handbook under the other cor-
responding Convention articles. Certain articles 
set out special provisions for children particularly 
prone to forms of discrimination, for example, 
children with disabilities (article 23), and refugee 
children (article 22). Because discrimination is 
at the root of various forms of child exploitation, 
other articles to protect the child call for action 
that involves challenging discrimination.
Paragraph 2 of article 2 asserts the need to pro-
tect children from all forms of discrimination or 
punishment on the basis of the status or activities 
of their parents and others close to them. 
■
Definition of “discrimination”
The term “discrimination” is not defined in the 
Convention, nor is it defined in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
includes a similar non-discrimination principle. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
asserted the fundamental importance of article 
2 and raises the issue of non-discrimination in 
its consideration of each State Party report. The 
Committee has not, as at June 2007, issued any 
interpretative General Comment on article 2. But 
other General Comments have expanded on the 
theme of discrimination in relation to their partic-
ular subject-matter. In its General Comment No. 
5 on “General measures of implementation for 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 
42 and 44, para. 6)”, the Committee notes in rela-
tion to article 2:
“This non-discrimination obligation requires 
States actively to identify individual children 
and groups of children the recognition and 
realization of whose rights may demand 
special measures. For example, the Committee 
highlights, in particular, the need for data 
collection to be disaggregated to enable 
discrimination or potential discrimination to 
be identified. Addressing discrimination may 
require changes in legislation, administration 
and resource allocation, as well as educational 
measures to change attitudes. It should be 
emphasized that the application of the non-
discrimination principle of equal access to 
rights does not mean identical treatment.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 12)
In its first General Comment on “The aims of 
education”, the Committee explores discrimina-
tion in the overall context of education: 
“Discrimination on the basis of any of the 
grounds listed in article 2 of the Convention, 
whether it is overt or hidden, offends the 
human dignity of the child and is capable of 
undermining or even destroying the capacity 
of the child to benefit from educational 
opportunities. While denying a child’s access to 
educational opportunities is primarily a matter 
which relates to article 28 of the Convention, 
there are many ways in which failure to 
comply with the principles contained in article 
29(1) can have a similar effect. To take an 
extreme example, gender discrimination can 
be reinforced by practices such as a curriculum 
which is inconsistent with the principles of 
gender equality, by arrangements which 
limit the benefits girls can obtain from the 
educational opportunities offered, and by 
unsafe or unfriendly environments which 
discourage girls’ participation. Discrimination 
against children with disabilities is also 
pervasive in many formal educational systems 
and in a great many informal educational 
settings, including in the home. Children 
with HIV/AIDS are also heavily discriminated 
against in both settings. All such discriminatory 
practices are in direct contradiction with the 
requirements in article 29(1)(a) that education 
be directed to the development of the child’s 
personality, talents and mental and physical 
abilities to their fullest potential.” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 1, 
2001, CRC/GC/2001/1, para. 10) 
The General Comment also underlines, in par-
ticular, the importance of education in combating 
racism: 
“Racism and related phenomena thrive where 
there is ignorance, unfounded fears of racial, 
ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic or 
other forms of difference, the exploitation of 
prejudices, or the teaching or dissemination 
of distorted values. A reliable and enduring 
antidote to all of these failings is the 
provision of education which promotes an 
understanding and appreciation of the values 
reflected in article 29(1), including respect 
for differences, and challenges all aspects of 
discrimination and prejudice. Education should 
thus be accorded one of the highest priorities 
in all campaigns against the evils of racism 
and related phenomena.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 1, 2001, 
CRC/GC/2001/1, para. 11; see also article 29, 
page 447.)
In its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing 
child rights in early childhood”, the Committee 
urges States Parties to identify the implications 
of the non-discrimination principle for realizing 
rights in early childhood:
“Article 2 means that young children in 
general must not be discriminated against on 
–> Table of Contents

any grounds, for example where laws fail to 
offer equal protection against violence for 
all children, including young children. Young 
children are especially at risk of discrimination 
because they are relatively powerless and 
depend on others for the realization of their 
rights.
“Article 2 also means that particular groups 
of young children must not be discriminated 
against. Discrimination may take the form of 
reduced levels of nutrition; inadequate care 
and attention; restricted opportunities for 
play, learning and education; or inhibition 
of free expression of feelings and views. 
Discrimination may also be expressed 
through harsh treatment and unreasonable 
expectations, which may be exploitative or 
abusive…” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 7, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, 
para. 11)
The Committee goes on to give some illustrative 
examples (see box, page 20). It also expresses con-
cern about discrimination in access to services:
“Potential discrimination in access to quality 
services for young children is a particular 
concern, especially where health, education, 
welfare and other services are not universally 
available and are provided through a 
combination of state, private and charitable 
organizations… As a first step, the Committee 
encourages States Parties to monitor the 
availability of and access to quality services 
that contribute to young children’s survival 
and development, including through 
systematic data collection, disaggregated in 
terms of major variables related to children’s 
and families’ background and circumstances. 
As a second step, actions may be required 
that guarantee that all children have an equal 
opportunity to benefit from available services. 
More generally, States Parties should raise 
awareness about discrimination against young 
children in general, and against vulnerable 
groups in particular.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, General Comment No. 7, 2005, 
CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 12)

AIDS and the rights of the child”, paras. 7 to

The Human Rights Committee, which oversees 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, issued a General Comment in 1989 which 
notes definitions of discrimination in other 
human rights instruments and proposes a general 
definition.
Under article 2 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, “Each State Party to 
the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to 
ensure to all individuals within its territory and 
subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in 
the present Covenant, without distinction of any 
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national or social ori-
gin, property, birth or other status.” 
Article 24(1) of the Covenant also requires that 
“Every child shall have, without any discrimi-
nation as to race, colour, sex, language, reli-
gion, national or social origin, property or birth, 
the right to such measures of protection as are 
required by his status as a minor, on the part of 
his family, society and the State...” 
And the Covenant’s article 26 states: “All persons 
are equal before the law and are entitled with-
out any discrimination to the equal protection 
of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit 
any discrimination and guarantee to all persons 
equal and effective protection against discrimi-
nation on any ground such as race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other 
status.” 
The Human Rights Committee, in its 1989 
General Comment, emphasizes that “non-dis-
crimination, together with equality before the law 
and equal protection of the law without any dis-
crimination, constitute a basic and general prin-
ciple relating to the protection of human rights”. 
The Human Rights Committee notes that “the 
term ‘discrimination’ as used in the Covenant 
should be understood to imply any distinction, 
exclusion, restriction or preference which is based 
on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status, and 
which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or 
impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise 
by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights 
and freedoms”.
The Human Rights Committee quotes article 1 of 
the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and art-
icle 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women which 
use a similar definition.
The Human Rights Committee goes on to empha-
size that the “enjoyment of rights and freedoms on 
an equal footing, however, does not mean identi-
cal treatment in every instance”. The principle of

Discrimination in early childhood
In its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing child rights in early childhood”, the Committee 
provides examples of the forms that discrimination can take:
• “Discrimination against girl children is a serious violation of rights, affecting their survival 
and all areas of their young lives as well as restricting their capacity to contribute positively to 
society. They may be victims of selective abortion, genital mutilation, neglect and infanticide, 
including through inadequate feeding in infancy. They may be expected to undertake excessive 
family responsibilities and deprived of opportunities to participate in early childhood and pri-
mary education;
• Discrimination against children with disabilities reduces survival prospects and quality of life. 
These children are entitled to the care, nutrition, nurturance and encouragement offered other 
children. They may also require additional, special assistance in order to ensure their integra-
tion and the realization of their rights;
• Discrimination against children infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS deprives them of the 
help and support they most require. Discrimination may be found within public policies, in the 
provision of and access to services, as well as in everyday practices that violate these children’s 
rights…;
• Discrimination related to ethnic origin, class/caste, personal circumstances and lifestyle, or 
political and religious beliefs (of children or their parents) excludes children from full participa-
tion in society. It affects parents’ capacities to fulfil their responsibilities towards their children. 
It affects children’s opportunities and self-esteem, as well as encouraging resentment and con-
flict among children and adults;
• Young children who suffer multiple discrimination (e.g., related to ethnic origin, social and cul-
tural status, gender and/or disabilities) are especially at risk. 
• Young children may also suffer the consequences of discrimination against their parents, for 
example if children have been born out of wedlock or in other circumstances that deviate from 
traditional values, or if their parents are refugees or asylum seekers. 
“States Parties have a responsibility to monitor and combat discrimination in whatever forms it 
takes and wherever it occurs – within families, communities, schools or other institutions…”
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 7, “Implementing child rights in early 
childhood”, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, paras. 11 and 12) 
equality sometimes requires States Parties “to take 
affirmative action in order to diminish or elimi-
nate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate 
discrimination prohibited by the Covenant.” And 
finally, it states that “not every differentiation of 
treatment will constitute discrimination, if the cri-
teria for such differentiation are reasonable and 
objective and if the aim is to achieve a purpose 
which is legitimate under the Covenant”. (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 18, 
1989, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, paras. 7 to 13, pp. 187 
and 188)
In relation to discrimination against children and 
the Covenant, another Human Rights Committee 
General Comment, also issued in 1989, states: 
“The Covenant requires that children should be 
protected against discrimination on any grounds 
such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, 
national or social origin, property or birth. In this 
connection, the Committee notes that, whereas 
non-discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights 
provided for in the Covenant also stems, in the 
case of children, from article 2 and their equality 
before the law from article 26, the non-discrimi-
nation clause contained in article 24 relates spe-
cifically to the measures of protection referred to 
in that provision. Reports by States Parties should 
indicate how legislation and practice ensure that 
measures of protection are aimed at removing all 
discrimination in every field, including inheri-
tance, particularly as between children who 
are nationals and children who are aliens, or as 
between legitimate children and children born out 
of wedlock.” (Human Rights Committee, General 
Comment No. 17, 1989, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 
5, p. 186)

“States Parties shall respect 
and ensure the rights set forth
in the present Convention...”
The language of article 2 and its interpretation by 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child empha-
size that the obligation of States Parties to pre-
vent discrimination is an active one, requiring, 
like other aspects of implementation, a range of 
measures that include review, strategic planning, 
legislation, monitoring, awareness-raising, educa-
tion and information campaigns, and evaluation 
of measures taken to reduce disparities.
A commentary published in the Bulletin of Human 
Rights asserts that in terms of international law, 
the obligation “to respect” requires States “to 
refrain from any actions which would violate any 
of the rights of the child under the Convention... 
The obligation ‘to ensure’ goes well beyond that 
of ‘to respect’, since it implies an affirmative 
obligation on the part of the State to take what-
ever measures are necessary to enable individuals 
to enjoy and exercise the relevant rights” (Philip 
Alston, ‘The legal framework of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child’, Bulletin of Human 
Rights, 91/2, p. 5). 
An “active” approach 
to implementing the principle 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
constantly stressed the need for an “active” 
approach to implementation and in particular to 
non-discrimination. It underscored this point in 
its comments on the first Initial Report submitted 
to it, in 1993:
“The Committee emphasizes that the principle 
of non-discrimination, as provided for under 
article 2 of the Convention, must be vigorously 
applied, and that a more active approach 
should be taken to eliminate discrimination 
against certain groups of children, most 
notably girl children.” (Bolivia CRC/C/15/Add.1, 
para. 14)
The implementation of article 2 must be inte-
grated into the implementation of all other art-
icles – ensuring that all the rights mentioned are 
available to all children without discrimination of 
any kind.
Reviewing legislation and writing 
non-discrimination principle into 
legislation
In its General Comment No. 5 on “General mea-
sures of implementation for the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44, para. 
6)”, the Committee 
“… emphasizes, in particular, the importance 
of ensuring that domestic law reflects the 
identified general principles in the Convention 
(arts. 2, 3, 6, and 12). The Committee 
welcomes the development of consolidated 
children’s rights statutes, which can highlight 
and emphasize the Convention’s principles. But 
the Committee emphasizes that it is crucial in 
addition that all relevant ‘sectoral’ laws (on 
education, health, justice and so on) reflect 
consistently the principles and standards of the 
Convention.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 22) 
The Committee has indicated also in Concluding 
Observations on many States’ reports that, as 
with the other articles identified as general prin-
ciples, the non-discrimination principle should be 
written into legislation and that all the possible 
grounds for discrimination spelled out in article 
2 should be reflected in the legislation. And it has 
emphasized that there should be the possibility to 
challenge discrimination before the courts. 
In some States, a non-discrimination clause is 
written into the constitution and therefore applies 
to all children. In others, non-discrimination prin-
ciples are included in human rights legislation 
with reference to children. The Convention, like 
other human rights instruments, does not require 
States to have a constitution. But where there is 
a constitution, its provisions must be consistent 
with the Convention, or, in the terms of article 41, 
must be more conducive to the realization of the 
rights of the child.
The Committee has also emphasized the need 
for States to review their constitutions and all 
existing legislation to ensure that these do not 
involve discrimination; often, in the same com-
ments, the Committee has drawn attention to 
particular examples of existing discrimination. 
For example:
“The Committee is concerned about 
discriminatory attitudes towards certain 
groups of children such as disabled children, 
refugee and IDPs’ [internally displaced 
persons’] children, street children and children 
infected with HIV/AIDS.
“In accordance with article 2 of the 
Convention, the Committee recommends that 
the State Party increase its efforts to adopt 
a proactive and comprehensive strategy to 
eliminate discrimination on any grounds 
against all vulnerable groups throughout the 
country.” (Azerbaijan CRC/C/AZE/CO/2, paras. 24 
and 25) 
“The Committee notes with appreciation 
that article 7 of the Constitution of Lebanon 
promotes the principle of non-discrimination. 
However, it notes with concern that the 
Constitution and domestic laws guarantee

the equal status only to Lebanese children 
but leave, for example, foreign children 
and refugee and asylum-seeking children 
without such protection. It is concerned at the 
persistent de facto discrimination faced by 
children with disabilities, the aforementioned 
foreign, refugee and asylum-seeking 
children, Palestinian children, children living 
in poverty, children in conflict with the law 
and children living in rural areas, especially 
with regard to their access to adequate social 
and health services and educational facilities. 
The Committee also notes with concern 
the reports of the expressions of racial 
discrimination and xenophobia in the 
State Party.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party strengthen its efforts to eliminate 
discrimination against children with 
disabilities, foreign, refugee and asylum- 
seeking children, Palestinian children, children 
living in poverty, children in conflict with the 
law and children living in rural areas and other 
vulnerable groups by: 
(a) Reviewing domestic laws with a view to 
ensure that children in the Lebanese territory 
shall be treated equally and as individuals;
(b) Ensuring that these children have equal 
access to health and social services and to 
quality education and that services used by 
these children are allocated sufficient financial 
and human resources;
(c) Enhancing monitoring of programmes 
and services implemented by local authorities 
with a view to identifying and eliminating 
disparities; and 
(d) Preventing racial discrimination and 
xenophobia targeting certain foreigner 
groups, including refugee and asylum-seeking 
children.” (Lebanon CRC/C/LBN/CO/3, paras.27 
and 28)
In examining Initial and Periodic Reports the 
Committee frequently comes across instances in 
which some forms of discrimination are written 
into existing legislation. A particularly common 
example of discrimination by gender is legisla-
tion defining different minimum ages for boys 
and girls to marry (for further discussion, see 
below, pages 28 and 29 and article 1, page 8); 
another example is the discrimination inherent 
in some state legislation dealing with children of 
married parents and those born out of marriage, 
referred to as non-marital children (see below, 
page 24). Policies intended to discourage popula-
tion growth by limiting the size of families must 
not discriminate against individual children:
“In the light of article 2 of the Convention, the 
Committee recommends that the State Party 
find alternative means to implement the three 
child policy, other than excluding the fourth 
child from social service benefits, and ensure 
that all children have equal access to such 
assistance without discrimination.” (The former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia CRC/C/15/Add.118, 
para. 17)
In 2002, the Committee held a Day of General 
Discussion on the theme “The private sector as 
service provider and its role in implementing 
child rights”. Recommendations adopted by the 
Committee following the Day emphasized the 
importance of the non-discrimination principle 
in any process of privatization. The State con-
tinues to be bound by its obligations under the 
Convention, even when the provision of services 
is delegated to non-state actors:
“… For instance, privatization measures may 
have a particular impact on the right to health 
(art. 24) and the right to education (arts. 28 
and 29), and States Parties have the obligation 
to ensure that privatization does not threaten 
accessibility to services on the basis of criteria 
prohibited, especially under the principle of 
non-discrimination…” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, Report on the thirty-first session, 
September/October 2002, CRC/C/121, page 153)
The Committee has emphasized that the princi-
ple of non-discrimination applies equally to pri-
vate institutions and individuals as well as to the 
State, and that this must be reflected in legisla-
tion:
“The Committee notes with concern that … 
the principle of non-discrimination does not 
apply to private professionals or institutions…” 
(Zimbabwe CRC/C/15/Add.55, para. 12)
Other active measures to challenge 
discrimination 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child rec-
ognizes that the reflection of the principle of 
non-discrimination in the law, while fundamen-
tal to implementation, is not in itself sufficient; 
other strategies are needed to implement the prin-
ciple, in particular to challenge traditional and 
other discriminatory attitudes and customs. The 
Committee has identified traditional attitudes and 
customs that perpetuate discrimination in many 
societies, whether the discrimination is reflected 
in legislation or not. For example:
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party make greater efforts to ensure 
that all children within its jurisdiction enjoy 
without discrimination, all the rights set out 
in the Convention, including through public 
education programmes and the eradication 
of social misconceptions, in accordance with 
article 2;…” (Niger CRC/C/15/Add.179, para. 28. 
See also, for example, El Salvador CRC/C/15/Add.9, 
para. 12; Jamaica CRC/C/15/Add.32, para. 11; 
Bangladesh CRC/C/15/Add.74, paras. 15 and 35; 
and India CRC/C/15/Add.115, para. 31.)

In comments on reports, the Committee has pro-
posed various forms of action, including:
• studies of discrimination – the Committee 
emphasizes frequently the importance of 
collecting disaggregated statistics and other 
information in order to identify discrimina-
tion in access to rights (see article 4, page 64, 
for details);
• development of comprehensive strategies;
• information and awareness-raising cam-
paigns, including public campaigns to chal-
lenge discriminatory attitudes and practices 
– a “comprehensive and integrated public 
information campaign”; 
• involvement of political, religious and com-
munity leaders in influencing attitudes and 
discouraging discrimination.
Implementation “irrespective of 
budgetary constraints” 
The Committee has emphasized that implemen-
tation of the general principles in articles 2 and 3 
of the Convention must not be “made dependent 
on budgetary constraints”. In practice, poverty is 
clearly a major cause of discrimination affecting 
children. The Committee’s intention is to ensure 
that non-discrimination and the best interests of 
children are primary considerations in setting 
budgets and allocating available resources. The 
Committee consistently emphasizes the need for 
affirmative action – positive discrimination – on 
behalf of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. 
For example:
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party pay particular attention to 
the implementation of article 4 of the 
Convention by increasing and prioritizing 
budgetary allocations to ensure at all levels 
the implementation of the rights of the child 
and that particular attention is paid to the 
protection of the rights of children belonging 
to vulnerable groups including children with 
disabilities, children affected or/and infected 
by HIV/AIDS, street children and children 
living in poverty…” (Ghana CRC/C/GHA/CO/2, 
para. 18)
Monitoring and evaluation
It is essential to monitor the realization of all 
rights within the Convention for all children, 
without discrimination. Thus the monitoring 
process and the indicators used must be sensi-
tive to the various issues specifically mentioned 
in the article: race, colour, sex, language, reli-
gion, political or other opinion, national, eth-
nic or social origin, property, disability, birth or 
other status. As the wording indicates, the list is 
not exhaustive but merely illustrative, and States 
must consider other grounds that might cause dis-
crimination. The Guidelines for Periodic Reports 
(Revised 2005) requests disaggregated data 
under many articles, for example by age, gender, 
region, rural/urban area, social and ethnic origin 
(see article 4, page 64). The purpose is to ensure 
that States Parties have sufficient information to 
judge whether there is discrimination in imple-
menting the article or provision concerned. 
The consideration of the implications of each and 
every article must include the consideration of 
possible discrimination against individual chil-
dren or groups of children. Article 2 highlights 
the “double jeopardy” many children face, dis-
criminated against not only on the grounds of 
their age and status but also on other specific 
grounds such as their sex or race or disability.
“... to each child within their 
jurisdiction...”
Article 2 emphasizes that all the rights in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child must 
apply to all children in the State, including visi-
tors, refugees, children of migrant workers and 
those in the State illegally. In General Comment 
No. 6 on “Treatment of unaccompanied and sepa-
rated children outside their country of origin”, the 
Committee states:
“… the principle of non-discrimination, in all 
its facets, applies in respect to all dealings 
with separated and unaccompanied children. 
In particular, it prohibits any discrimination 
on the basis of the status of a child as 
being unaccompanied or separated, or as 
being a refugee, asylum seeker or migrant. 
This principle, when properly understood, 
does not prevent, but may indeed call for, 
differentiation on the basis of different 
protection needs such as those deriving from 
age and/or gender. Measures should also be 
taken to address possible misperceptions and 
stigmatization of unaccompanied or separated 
children within society…” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 6, 2005, 
CRC/GC/2005/6, para. 18)
In States with semi-autonomous provinces and 
territories, the Committee has stressed that dif-
ferences in legislation or other factors must not 
cause discrimination in the enjoyment of the 
rights in the Convention for children depending 
on where they live.
In discussions with Canadian Government rep-
resentatives, a Committee member stated that 
“... under article 2 States Parties were required to 
‘respect and ensure’ the rights of children under 
the terms of the Convention, irrespective of fac-
tors such as race, sex, or ‘other status’. He took

that as implying that the Federal Government 
was obliged to ensure that equal protection was 
given to the rights of children in all the differ-
ent provinces and territories. The Committee had 
been entrusted with the task of monitoring prog-
ress made by States Parties in the implementation 
of the Convention and was therefore obliged to 
ensure that the Convention was applied through-
out Canada, irrespective of regional differences.” 
(Canada CRC/C/SR.214, para. 45)
The Committee commented to Canada, and simi-
larly to other States:
“Disparities between provincial or territorial 
legislation and practices which affect the 
implementation of the Convention are a 
matter of concern to the Committee. It seems, 
for instance, that the definition of the legal 
status of the children born out of wedlock 
being a matter of provincial responsibility may 
lead to different levels of legal protection of 
such children in various parts of the country.” 
(Canada CRC/C/15/Add.37, para. 9)
The Committee followed this up again when it 
examined Canada’s Second Report:
“The Committee urges the Federal 
Government to ensure that the provinces and 
territories are aware of their obligations under 
the Convention and that the rights in the 
Convention have to be implemented in all the 
provinces and territories through legislation 
and policy and other appropriate measures.” 
(Canada CRC/C/15/Add.215, para. 9)
States with “dependent” territories are advised to 
ensure that the Convention is extended to all of 
them:
“The Committee notes with concern that 
the State Party has not yet extended the 
Convention to all of its Crown Dependencies, 
specifically Jersey and Guernsey.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party submits in its next periodic report, 
information concerning the measures taken 
to extend the Convention to all of its Crown 
Dependencies.” (United Kingdom – Isle of Man 
CRC/C/15/Add.134, paras. 4 and 5)
The Committee has also noted more general dis-
crimination existing between regions within a 
State, which is not caused by legislative differ-
ences. 
“... without discrimination
of any kind, irrespective of the 
child’s or his or her parent’s 
or legal guardian’s race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, 
national, ethnic or social 
origin, property, disability, 
birth or other status”
The grounds for discrimination specifically men-
tioned in article 2 of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child are similar to those stated in the 
International Covenants on Civil and Political 
Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights (article 2 in each Covenant), with the addi-
tion of ethnic origin and disability. 
The Committee has raised concerns where a State’s 
constitution or domestic legislation does not bar 
discrimination on all the grounds listed in article 2:
“The Committee ... remains concerned that 
some of the criteria listed as prohibited 
grounds of discrimination under the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child are 
absent from the State Party constitution.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party review the Constitution and other 
relevant national legal instruments, enlarging 
the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination 
Grounds for discrimination against children

children with disabilities (article 23), chil-
dren of minorities or indigenous communities 
(article 30), children suffering economic and 
other exploitation (articles 32, 34, 36), children 
involved in the juvenile justice system and chil-
dren whose liberty is restricted (articles 37 and 
40), and children in situations of armed conflict 
(article 38). 
In recommendations issued following its Day of 
General Discussion on “The rights of indigenous 
children” in 2003, the Committee calls on States 
Parties 
“… to implement fully article 2 of the 
Convention and take effective measures, 
including through legislation, to ensure that 
indigenous children enjoy all of their rights 
equally and without discrimination, including 
equal access to culturally appropriate services 
including health, education, social services, 
housing, potable water and sanitation”. 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the thirty-fourth session, September/October 2003, 
CRC/C/133, p. 134 
The Committee also calls for education and train-
ing for relevant professionals working with and 
for indigenous children on the Convention and the 
rights of indigenous peoples. It also recommends 
the development of awareness-raising campaigns, 
with the full participation of indigenous commu-
nities and children, including through the mass 
media, to combat negative attitudes towards and 
misperceptions about indigenous peoples (CRC/
C/133, p. 134). 
The World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, 
Xenophobia 
and 
Related 
Intolerance, held in Durban (South Africa) in 
August 2001, provides a new global agenda to 
challenge discrimination on such grounds (A/
CONF.189/12. See box, opposite). As one con-
tribution to preparations for the Conference, the 
Committee drafted its first General Comment 
on “The aims of education” (see article 29, 
page 439). In its Concluding Observations, the 
Committee asks States to provide in their next 
Periodic Report information on measures and 
programmes, relevant to the Convention, under-
taken by the State Party in order to follow up the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.
Legitimate forms of discrimination
As indicated above (page 22), the bar on discrimi-
nation of any kind does not outlaw legitimate dif-
ferentiation between children in implementation 
– for example to respect the “evolving capacities” 
of children and to give priority, “special consider-
ation” or affirmative action to children living in 
exceptionally difficult conditions.
to include ‘disability, birth, other [than 
political] opinion’, as provided for in article 
2 of the Convention.” (Sierra Leone CRC/C/15/
Add.116, paras. 30 and 31)
The Committee has identified numerous grounds 
for discrimination, not specified in article 2, in its 
examination of States Parties’ reports (see box), 
including, for example, sexual orientation:
“... concern is expressed at the insufficient 
efforts made to provide against discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. While the 
Committee notes the Isle of Man’s intention 
to reduce the legal age for consent to 
homosexual relations from 21 to 18 years, 
it remains concerned about the disparity 
that continues to exist between the ages 
for consent to heterosexual (16 years) and 
homosexual relations.
“It is recommended that the Isle of Man 
take all appropriate measures, including of a 
legislative nature, to prevent discrimination 
based on the grounds of sexual orientation 
and to fully comply with article 2 of the 
Convention.” (United Kingdom – Isle of Man 
CRC/C/15/Add.134, paras. 22 and 23. See also 
United Kingdom – Overseas Territories CRC/C/15/
Add.135, paras. 25 and 26.)
The Committee also raises discrimination on 
grounds of sexual orientation in the context of 
HIV/AIDS, in its General Comment No. 3 on 
“HIV/AIDS and the rights of the child”:
“Of concern also is discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. In the design of HIV/AIDS-
related strategies, and in keeping with their 
obligations under the Convention, States 
Parties must give careful consideration to 
prescribed gender norms in their societies 
with a view to eliminating gender-based 
discrimination as these norms impact on the 
vulnerability of both girls and boys to HIV/
AIDS.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 3, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/3, 
para. 8)
The Committee also notes in the General 
Comment that it interprets “other status” under 
article 2 to include HIV/AIDS status of the child 
or his/her parents (para. 9). It goes on to recom-
mend that States Parties should 
“… review existing laws or enact new 
legislation with a view to implementing fully 
article 2 of the Convention, and in particular 
to expressly prohibiting discrimination based 
on real or perceived HIV/AIDS status so as to 
guarantee equal access for all children to all 
relevant services…” (CRC/GC/2003/3, para. 40(c))
Other Convention articles highlight groups of 
children who may suffer particular forms of dis-
crimination, for example children without fami-
lies (article 20), refugee children (article  22),

The Convention’s Preamble recognizes that “in all 
countries in the world, there are children living in 
exceptionally difficult conditions, and that such 
children need special consideration”. Inevitably, 
the category of children living in exception-
ally difficult conditions includes children with 
widely different problems requiring widely dif-
ferent remedies. The situation of such children 
is best defined in terms of discrimination in the 
realization and enjoyment of various rights in the 
Convention.
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
consistently commented on the need to identify 
the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children 
in a State, has expressed concern about their sit-
uation and has recommended action to ensure 
that such children enjoy their rights under the 
Convention. 
Discrimination against girls 
The Committee has paid particular attention 
to the issue of discrimination against girls and 
frequently expresses concern about persist-
ing discrimination in its successive Concluding 
Observations. 
The Committee held a Day of General Discussion 
on “The girl child”, in January 1995, intended to 
prepare the contribution of the Committee to the 
Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for 
Equality, Development and Peace, held at Beijing, 
in September 1995. A recommendation adopted 
by the Committee, on “Participation and contri-
bution” to the Beijing Conference, reaffirmed: 
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance
The Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference (Durban, South Africa, 
September 2001) notes with concern the large number of children and young people, particularly 
girls, among the victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and 
goes on to stress “the need to incorporate special measures, in accordance with the principle of the 
best interests of the child and respect for his or her views, in programmes to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in order to give priority attention to the rights 
and the situation of children and young people who are victims of these practices” (Declaration, 
para. 72). 
The Declaration and Programme of Action cover many issues relevant to children’s rights, includ-
ing: the rights of children belonging to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities or who are indig-
enous; victims of trafficking; links between child labour and poverty and racial discrimination; the 
influence on children and young people of new information technologies when used to propagate 
racism, and so on. 
The Declaration underlines “the links between the right to education and the struggle against rac-
ism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the essential role of education, 
including human rights education and education which is sensitive to and respects cultural diver-
sity, especially amongst children and young people, in the prevention and eradication of all forms 
of intolerance and discrimination” (Declaration, para. 97).
The Programme of Action makes detailed recommendations for education, urging States to com-
mit themselves to ensuring access without discrimination to education, including access to free 
primary education for all children, both girls and boys. States should ensure equal access to educa-
tion for all in law and in practice, and refrain from any legal or other measures leading to imposed 
racial segregation in access to schooling (Programme of Action, paras. 121 and 122).
The Programme urges States “to encourage the full and active participation of, as well as involve 
more closely, youth in the elaboration, planning and implementation of activities to fight racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance”, calling upon States, in partnership with 
non-governmental organizations and other sectors of society, to facilitate both national and inter-
national youth dialogue on these issues. States are urged to encourage and facilitate the establish-
ment and maintenance of youth mechanisms to combat racism (Programme of Action, paras. 216 
and 217).

Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
28
“... the importance of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and of its implementation 
process in decisively improving the situation 
of girls around the world and ensuring the full 
realization of their fundamental rights”. 
The Committee recalled that the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women 
“... have a complementary and mutually 
reinforcing nature”, 
and recommended that 
“... they should be an essential framework for 
a forward-looking strategy to promote and 
protect the fundamental rights of girls and 
women and decisively eradicate inequality and 
discrimination.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, Report on the eighth session, January 1995, 
CRC/C/38, p. 3)
The General Discussion report notes that, because 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child is the 
most widely ratified human rights instrument,
“... it was undoubtedly also the most widely 
accepted framework for action in favour of 
the fundamental rights of girls. There was an 
undeniable commitment on the part of the 
international community to use the provisions 
of the Convention as an agenda for action 
to identify persisting forms of inequality and 
discrimination against the girl child, to abolish 
practices and traditions detrimental to the 
enjoyment of their rights and to define a real 
forward-looking strategy to promote and 
protect those rights.”
The General Discussion report states:
“Addressing the questions of inequality and 
discrimination on the basis of gender did not 
imply that they had to be seen in a complete 
isolation, as if girls were a special group 
entitled to special rights. In fact, girls are 
simply human beings who should be seen as 
individuals and not just as daughters, sisters, 
wives or mothers, and who should fully enjoy 
the fundamental rights inherent to their 
human dignity... Within the larger movement 
for the realization of women’s rights, history 
had clearly shown that it was essential to 
focus on the girl child in order to break down 
the cycle of harmful traditions and prejudices 
against women. Only through a comprehensive 
strategy to promote and protect the rights of 
girls, starting with the younger generation, 
would it be possible to build a shared and 
lasting approach and a wide movement of 
advocacy and awareness aimed at promoting 
the self-esteem of women and allowing for the 
acquisition of skills which will prepare them to 
participate actively in decisions and activities 
affecting them. Such an approach must be 
based on the recognition of human rights as a 
universal and unquestionable reality, free from 
gender bias....”
The Committee noted that in its Concluding 
Observations it had recommended:
“... that a comprehensive strategy be 
formulated and effectively implemented 
to create awareness and understanding 
of the principles and provisions of the 
Convention; launch educational programmes 
to eradicate all forms of discrimination 
against the girl child; and encourage the 
participation of all segments of society, 
including non-governmental organizations. In 
this connection, the Committee had further 
suggested that customary, religious and 
community leaders may be systematically 
involved in the steps undertaken to overcome 
the negative influences of traditions and 
customs.”
Other recommendations the Committee noted 
included:
• ensuring girls effective access to the educa-
tional and vocational system, to enhance their 
rate of school attendance and reduce the drop-
out rate;
• eliminating stereotypes in educational mate-
rials and in training all those involved in the 
educational system about the Convention; 
• incorporating the Convention in school and 
training curricula;
• eradicating degrading and exploitative images 
of girls and women in the media and advertis-
ing.
The Committee also noted that 
“... legislative measures send a formal 
message that traditions and customs contrary 
to the rights of the child will no longer be 
accepted, create a meaningful deterrent 
and clearly contribute to changing attitudes. 
The Committee had often recommended, 
in the light of article 2 of the Convention, 
that national legislation of States Parties 
should clearly recognize the principle of 
equality before the law and forbid gender 
discrimination, while providing for effective 
protection and remedies in case of non-
respect. There was also a need to reflect in 
the legislation the prohibition of harmful 
traditional practices, such as genital mutilation 
and forced marriage, and any other form of 
violence against girls, including sexual abuse.
“The Committee had also identified certain 
areas where law reform should be undertaken, 
in both the civil and penal spheres, such as the 
minimum age for marriage and the linking 
of the age of criminal responsibility to the 
attainment of puberty.”

The Committee expressed concern at the situa-
tion of specific vulnerable groups of girls, includ-
ing those affected by armed conflict and refugee 
children:
“In view of the prevailing circumstances of 
emergency surrounding them, such girls do not 
really have any time to enjoy their childhood, 
and the traditional inferiority affecting girls’ 
lives is seriously aggravated. Sexual violence 
and abuse and economic exploitation often 
occur, education is not perceived as a priority 
when urgent basic needs must be met, forced 
and early marriage is seen as a protective 
measure. And although dramatically affected 
by emergency situations, girls often cannot 
voice their fear and insecurity or share their 
hopes and feelings.”
There was further concern about the situation of 
working girls:
“Girls below the age of 15 often do the same 
household work as adult women; such labour 
is not regarded as ‘real work’ and is therefore 
never reflected in the statistical data. To free 
girls from this cycle they must have the equal 
chances and equal treatment, with special 
emphasis on education.” 
The General Discussion concluded that there was 
an urgent need to gather gender-disaggregated 
data, 
“... in a comprehensive and integrated manner, 
at the international, regional, national and 
local levels, with a view to assessing the 
prevailing reality affecting girls, identifying 
persisting problems and challenging the 
prevalence of invisibility, which in turn 
allows for the perpetuation of vulnerability”. 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the eighth session, January 1995, CRC/C/38, 
pp. 47-52)
The Platform for Action unanimously adopted 
by representatives from 189 countries at the 
Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 
September 1995) includes a detailed section on 
“Strategic Objectives and Actions” for the girl 
child (A.CONF.177/20/Rev.1, section L, pp. 145 
et seq.). In 2000 and again in 2005, special ses-
sions of the United Nations General Assembly 
reviewed progress five and ten years after the 
World Conference and adopted further actions 
and initiatives to implement the Declaration and 
Plan of Action (see “Beijing + 5”, section L, p. 18 
and pp. 25 et seq., A/RES/S-23/3; “Beijing + 10”).
The Committee has suggested to some States 
that “narrow interpretations of Islamic texts” by 
authorities were impeding implementation of the 
Convention. For example, it recommended to 
United Arab Emirates that the State Party should
“… undertake all possible measures to 
reconcile the interpretation of Islamic texts 
with fundamental human rights”. (United Arab 
Emirates CRC/C/15/Add.183, para. 22(b))
And examining Jordan’s Second Report, it con-
cluded:
“Noting the universal values of equality and 
tolerance inherent in Islam, the Committee 
observes that narrow interpretations of 
Islamic texts by authorities, particularly in 
areas relating to family law, are impeding the 
enjoyment of some human rights protected 
under the Convention… 
“In accordance with the findings of the 
Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/79/
Add.35), the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 
(CEDAW/C/JOR/2), its own previous concluding 
observations (Jordan CRC/C/15/Add.21) 
and with article 2 of the Convention, the 
Committee recommends to the State Party 
to take effective measures to prevent and 
eliminate discrimination on the grounds of sex 
and birth status in all fields of civil, economic, 
political, social and cultural life. The Committee 
recommends to the State Party to incorporate 
equality on the basis of sex in article 6 of the 
Constitution. The Committee recommends to 
the State Party to make all efforts to enact or 
rescind civil and criminal legislation, where 
necessary, to prohibit any such discrimination. 
In this regard, the Committee encourages the 
State Party to consider the practice of other 
States that have been successful in reconciling 
fundamental rights with Islamic texts. The 
Committee recommends to the State Party 
to take all appropriate measures, such as 
comprehensive public education campaigns, to 
prevent and combat negative societal attitudes 
in this regard, particularly within the family. 
Religious leaders should be mobilized to 
support such efforts.” (Jordan CRC/C/15/Add.125,
 paras. 9 and 30. See also Islamic Republic of Iran 
CRC/C/15/Add.123, para. 22; Egypt CRC/C/15/
Add.145, para. 6; and Saudi Arabia CRC/C/15/
Add.148, para. 24.)
Children with disabilities
In its General Comment No. 9 on “The rights of 
children with disabilities”, the Committee notes 
that children with disabilities are still experi-
encing serious difficulties and facing barriers to 
the full enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the 
Convention. The Committee emphasizes that 
the barrier is not the disability itself but rather a 
combination of social, cultural, attitudinal and 
physical obstacles which children with disabili-
ties encounter in their daily lives. The strategy 
for promoting their rights is therefore to take the 
necessary action to remove these barriers. The 
Committee notes that the explicit mention of 
–> Table of Contents

r
t
i
c
l
e
Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
30
disability as a prohibited ground for discrimina-
tion in article 2: 
“... is unique and can be explained by the fact 
that children with disabilities belong to one 
of the most vulnerable groups of children. In 
many cases forms of multiple discrimination 
– based on a combination of factors, i.e. 
indigenous girls with disabilities, children 
with disabilities living in rural areas and so on 
– increase the vulnerability of certain groups. 
It has been therefore felt necessary to mention 
disability explicitly in the non-discrimination 
article. Discrimination takes place – often 
de facto – in various aspects of the life and 
development of children with disabilities. 
As an example, social discrimination and 
stigmatization leads to their marginalization 
and exclusion, and may even threaten their 
survival and development if it goes as far as 
physical or mental violence against children 
with disabilities. Discrimination in service 
provision excludes them from education and 
denies them access to quality health and social 
services. The lack of appropriate education 
and vocational training discriminates against 
them by denying them job opportunities in the 
future. Social stigma, fears, overprotection, 
negative attitudes, misbeliefs and prevailing 
prejudices against children with disabilities 
remain strong in many communities and 
lead to the marginalization and alienation of 
children with disabilities…” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 9, 2006, 
CRC/C/GC/9, paras. 5 and 8. For full discussion, 
see article 23, page 321.)
Children living and/or working 
on the streets
Most, if not all, States Parties have reported, 
or acknowledged during discussion with the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, that they 
have some children living and/or working on the 
streets. Their situation and the many forms of 
discrimination suffered by them, being among 
the most disadvantaged and vulnerable children, 
has been a major issue of concern and a focus for 
recommendations by the Committee (for detailed 
discussion, see article 20, page 286).
In the report on its sixth (special) session, the 
Committee noted resolution 1994/93 of the 
Commission on Human Rights on the plight of 
street children:
“In particular, it welcomed the statement by 
the Commission that strict compliance with 
the provisions of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child would constitute a significant 
step towards solving the problems in this 
connection. It also welcomed the fact that 
the Commission commended the Committee 
‘for the attention it pays in its monitoring 
activities to the situation of children who, 
to survive, are forced to live and work in 
the streets’. Furthermore, the Committee 
noted that the Commission reiterated its 
invitation to the Committee to consider the 
possibility of a general comment thereon... 
In its discussion the Committee also pointed 
out that the term ‘street children’ may not 
clearly define the nature or the causes of the 
violations these children suffer. It is in fact an 
expression that covers a diversity of situations 
affecting children. Some work in the street 
but have homes, others are abandoned or for 
other reasons become homeless, others again 
have escaped abuse, some are pushed into 
prostitution or drug abuse. Another concern 
about the term was that it was understood 
in some societies to be stigmatizing and 
discriminatory. The Committee, therefore, 
had endeavoured to use more appropriate 
terminology.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, Report on the sixth (special) session, April 
1994, CRC/C/29, p. 31)
Protection of child from 
discrimination or punishment 
on basis of status, activities, 
expressed opinions or beliefs 
of child’s parents, guardians or 
family members: article 2(2)
It is doubtful whether the very wide potential 
implications of this provision have been suf-
ficiently considered during the preparation 
and consideration of reports by States Parties. 
Paragraph 1 of article 2 lists as grounds for dis-
crimination “the child’s or his or her parent’s 
or legal guardian’s race, colour, sex...” [editors’ 
emphasis]. Paragraph 2 adds protection against 
“all forms of discrimination or punishment on 
the basis of the status, activities, expressed opin-
ions, or beliefs of the child’s parents, legal guard-
ians, or family members”. Paragraph 1 concerns 
discrimination only in relation to the enjoyment 
of rights in the Convention; paragraph 2 requires 
action against “all forms of discrimination”, 
and is not confined to the issues raised by the 
Convention.
In its examination of reports, the Committee 
has noted a variety of examples of the child suf-
fering discrimination covered by paragraph 2. 
Implementation requires States to ensure that any 
existing Constitution, relevant legislation, court 
decisions and administrative policy and prac-
tice comply with this principle. For example, are 
“all appropriate measures” taken to protect chil-
dren from discrimination or punishment when 
their parents are subject to action on the grounds 
of criminal behaviour or immigration status? (In 
addition, article 9 emphasizes that children must

l
e
be separated from their parents only when separa-
tion is necessary for the best interests of the child; 
see page 122). Are children penalized because 
of their parents’ marital status? The Committee 
has focused frequently on discrimination against 
children born “out of wedlock” – non-marital 
children. For example:
“… As regards children born out of wedlock, 
the Committee requests the State Party to 
review its domestic legislation in order to 
secure their right to equal treatment, including 
their right to equal inheritance and abolish the 
discriminatory classification of those children 
as ‘illegitimate’.” (Philippines CRC/C/15/Add.259, 
para. 21)
Does the State have the means to intervene on 
behalf of children whose rights (for example to 
health care) are threatened because of the extreme 
religious beliefs of their parents? Do policy and 
practice in institutions ensure that brothers and 
sisters are not victimized because of the behav-
iour of a sibling?

Reminder: The Convention is indivisible and its articles are interdependent. 
Article 2, the non-discrimination principle, has been identified as a general principle by 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and needs to be applied to all other articles.
Particular regard should be paid to:
The other general principles
Article 3(1): the best interests of the child to be a primary consideration in all actions concerning 
children
Article 6: right to life and maximum possible survival and development
Article 12: respect for the child’s views in all matters affecting the child; opportunity to be heard 
in any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting the child.

order to ensure that the best interests of the child 
are a primary consideration, giving proper prior-
ity to children and building child-friendly soci-
eties. The Committee on the Rights of the Child 
has developed its interpretation of the principle in 
relation to various issues in its successive General 
Comments.
Within the Convention, the concept is also evi-
dent in other articles, providing obligations to 
consider the best interests of individual children 
in particular situations in relation to 
• Separation from parents: The child shall not be 
separated from his or her parents against his 
or her will “except when competent authorities 
subject to judicial review determine, in accor-
dance with applicable law and procedures, 
he Committee on the Rights of the Child 
has highlighted article 3(1), that the best 
interests of the child shall be a primary 
consideration in all actions concerning 
children, as one of the general principles of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, alongside 
articles 2, 6 and 12. The principle was first seen 
in the 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child. 
Interpretations of the best interests of children or 
use of the principle cannot trump or override any 
of the other individual rights guaranteed by other 
articles in the Convention. The concept acquires 
particular significance in situations where other 
more specific provisions of the Convention do 
not apply. Article 3(1) emphasizes that govern-
ments and public and private bodies must ascer-
tain the impact on children of their actions, in 
Text of Article 3
1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare 
institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests 
of the child shall be a primary consideration.
2. States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for 
his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal 
guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take 
all appropriate legislative and administrative measures.
3. States Parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the 
care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent 
authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their 
staff, as well as competent supervision.

that such separation is necessary for the best 
interests of the child”; and States must respect 
the right of the child to maintain personal rela-
tions and direct contact with both parents on 
a regular basis “except if it is contrary to the 
child’s best interests” (article 9(1) and (3));
• Parental responsibilities: Both parents have 
primary responsibility for the upbringing of 
their child and “the best interests of the child 
will be their basic concern” (article 18(1));
• Deprivation of family environment: Children 
temporarily or permanently deprived of their 
family environment “or in whose own best 
interests cannot be allowed to remain in that 
environment”, are entitled to special protec-
tion and assistance (article 20);
• Adoption: States should ensure that “the best 
interests of the child shall be the paramount 
consideration” (article 21);
• Restriction of liberty: Children who are 
deprived of liberty must be separated from 
adults “unless it is considered in the child’s 
best interest not to do so” (article 37(c));
• Court hearings of penal matters involving a 
juvenile: Parents or legal guardians should 
be present “unless it is considered not to 
be in the best interest of the child” (article 
40(2)(b)(iii)).
The second and third paragraphs of article 3 are 
also of great significance. Article 3(2) outlines an 
active overall obligation of States, ensuring the 
necessary protection and care for the child’s well-
being in all circumstances, while respecting the 
rights and duties of parents. Together with article 
2(1) and article 4, article 3(2) sets out overarching 
implementation obligations of the State. 
Article 3(3) requires that standards be established 
by “competent bodies” for all institutions, ser-
vices and facilities for children, and that the State 
ensures that the standards are complied with. 
■
Article 3(1)
The concept of the “best interests” of children has 
been the subject of more academic analysis than 
any other concept included in the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. In many cases, its inclu-
sion in national legislation pre-dates ratifica-
tion of the Convention, and the concept is by no 
means new to international human rights instru-
ments. The 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the 
Child uses it in Principle 2: “The child shall enjoy 
special protection, and shall be given opportu-
nities and facilities, by law and by other means, 
to enable him to develop physically, mentally, 
morally, spiritually and socially in a healthy and 
normal manner and in conditions of freedom and 
dignity. In the enactment of laws for this purpose, 
the best interests of the child shall be the para-
mount consideration.” 
The principle is included in two articles of the 
1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women: article 5(b) 
requires States Parties to that Convention to 
“ensure that family education includes a proper 
understanding of maternity as a social function 
and the recognition of the common responsibility 
of men and women in the upbringing and devel-
opment of their children, it being understood that 
the interest of children is the primordial consid-
eration in all cases.” Similarly, article 16(1)(d) 
provides that in all matters relating to marriage 
and family relations “the interests of the children 
shall be paramount”. 
The principle does not appear in either of the 
International Covenants, but the Human Rights 
Committee, in two of its General Comments on 
interpretation of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, has referred to the 
child’s interest being “paramount” in cases of 
parental separation or divorce (Human Rights 
Committee, General Comments Nos. 17 and 19, 
HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, pp. 185 and 189).
“In all actions concerning 
children, whether undertaken 
by public or private social 
welfare institutions, courts of 
law, administrative authorities 
or legislative bodies...”
The wording of the principle indicates that its 
scope is very wide, going beyond state-initiated 
actions to cover private bodies too, and embra-
cing all actions concerning children as a group. 
In General Comments and in its examination 
of States Parties’ reports, the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child has emphasized that article 
3(1) is fundamental to the overall duty to under-
take all appropriate measures to implement 
the Convention for all children under article 4. 
Consideration of the best interests of the child 
should be built into national plans and policies for 
children and into the workings of parliaments and 
government, nationally and locally, including, in 
particular, in relation to budgeting and allocation 
of resources at all levels. 
In its General Comment No. 5 on “General mea-
sures of implementation for the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44, para. 
6)”, the Committee emphasizes the importance 
–> Table of Contents

BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD
37
a
r
t
i
c
l
e
of ensuring that domestic law reflects article 3(1) 
together with the other identified general prin-
ciples (para. 22). The Committee states that the 
best interests’ principle
“… requires active measures throughout 
Government, parliament and the judiciary. 
Every legislative, administrative and judicial 
body or institution is required to apply the 
best interests principle by systematically 
considering how children’s rights and interests 
are or will be affected by their decisions 
and actions – by, for example, a proposed or 
existing law or policy or administrative action 
or court decision, including those which are 
not directly concerned with children, but 
indirectly affect children.” (CRC/GC/2003/5, 
para. 12)
The Committee goes on to explain the need for 
child impact assessment and evaluation: 
“Ensuring that the best interests of the child 
are a primary consideration in all actions 
concerning children (art. 3(1)), and that all the 
provisions of the Convention are respected 
in legislation and policy development and 
delivery at all levels of government demands a 
continuous process of child impact assessment 
(predicting the impact of any proposed law, 
policy or budgetary allocation which affects 
children and the enjoyment of their rights) and 
child impact evaluation (evaluating the actual 
impact of implementation). This process needs 
to be built into government at all levels and as 
early as possible in the development of policy.
“Self-monitoring and evaluation is an 
obligation for Governments. But the 
Committee also regards as essential the 
independent monitoring of progress towards 
implementation by, for example, parliamentary 
committees, NGOs, academic institutions, 
professional associations, youth groups and 
independent human rights institutions….
“The Committee commends certain States 
which have adopted legislation requiring the 
preparation and presentation to parliament 
and/or the public of formal impact analysis 
statements. Every State should consider how it 
can ensure compliance with article 3 (1) and do 
so in a way which further promotes the visible 
integration of children in policy-making and 
sensitivity to their rights.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 45-47. See also article 4, 
page 61.)
In its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing 
child rights in early childhood”, the Committee 
states:
“The principle of best interests applies to all 
actions concerning children and requires active 
measures to protect their rights and promote 
their survival, growth, and well-being, as well 
as measures to support and assist parents and 
others who have day-to-day responsibility for 
realizing children’s rights:
(a) Best interests of individual children. All 
decision-making concerning a child’s care, 
health, education, etc. must take account 
of the best interests’ principle, including 
decisions by parents, professionals and others 
responsible for children. States Parties are 
urged to make provisions for young children 
to be represented independently in all legal 
proceedings by someone who acts for the 
child’s interests, and for children to be heard in 
all cases where they are capable of expressing 
their opinions or preferences;
(b) Best interests of young children as a 
group or constituency. All law and policy 
development, administrative and judicial 
decision-making and service provision that 
affect children must take account of the 
best interests’ principle. This includes actions 
directly affecting children (e.g. related to 
health services, care systems, or schools), as 
well as actions that indirectly impact on young 
children (e.g., related to the environment, 
housing or transport).” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, General Comment No. 7, 2005, 
CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 13)
“... the best interests of
the child...”
The Working Group drafting the Convention did 
not discuss any further definition of “best inter-
ests”, and the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child has not as yet (2007) drafted a General 
Comment on the principle. But in its first 10 
General Comments, issued between 2001 and 
2007, it has alluded to the principle and in some 
cases – see below – set out quite detailed expla-
nations of the implications of applying it to indi-
vidual children and/or to particular groups of 
children in particular circumstances. 
The Committee has repeatedly stressed that the 
Convention should be considered as a whole and 
has emphasized its interrelationships, in particu-
lar between those articles it has elevated to the 
status of general principles (articles 2, 3, 6 and 
12). Thus, the principles of non-discrimination, 
maximum survival and development, and respect 
for the views of the child must all be relevant to 
determining what the best interests of a child are 
in a particular situation, as well as to determining 
the best interests of children as a group. 
For example, in comments on Albania’s Initial 
Report, the Committee
“… notes the progress reported by the State 
Party in giving primary consideration to the 
best interests of the child. However, the 
Committee regrets that the determination of 
what constitutes the ‘best interests‘ seems to 
–> Table of Contents

e

38
be the decision of adults alone involving little 
consultation with children, even when they 
are able to state their opinions and interests”. 
(Albania CRC/C/15/Add.249, para. 26)
Consideration of best interests must embrace 
both short- and long-term considerations for the 
child. Any interpretation of best interests must be 
consistent with the spirit of the entire Convention 
– and in particular with its emphasis on the child 
as an individual with views and feelings of his or 
her own and the child as the subject of civil and 
political rights as well as special protections. 
States cannot interpret best interests in an overly 
culturally relativist way and cannot use their own 
interpretation of “best interests” to deny rights 
now guaranteed to children by the Convention, 
for example to protection against traditional prac-
tices and violent punishments (see pages 371 and 
256). In its 2006 General Comment No. 8 on “The 
right of the child to protection from corporal pun-
ishment and other cruel or degrading forms of 
punishment (articles. 19, 28.2 and 37, inter alia)”, 
the Committee explains: 
“When the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child has raised eliminating corporal 
punishment with certain States during the 
examination of their reports, governmental 
representatives have sometimes suggested 
that some level of ‘reasonable‘ or ‘moderate‘ 
corporal punishment can be justified as in the 
‘best interests‘ of the child. The Committee 
has identified, as an important general 
principle, the Convention’s requirement that 
the best interests of the child should be a 
primary consideration in all actions concerning 
children (article 3(1)). The Convention also 
asserts, in article 18, that the best interests of 
the child will be parents’ basic concern. But 
interpretation of a child’s best interests must 
be consistent with the whole Convention, 
including the obligation to protect children 
from all forms of violence and the requirement 
to give due weight to the child’s views; it 
cannot be used to justify practices, including 
corporal punishment and other forms of cruel 
or degrading punishment, which conflict with 
the child’s human dignity and right to physical 
integrity.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 8, 2006, CRC/C/GC/8, 
para. 26) 
The Committee reviews the implications of art-
icle 3(1) for States’ treatment of unaccompanied 
and separated children, and the search for long- 
and short-term solutions for them. In its 2005 
General Comment No. 6 on “Treatment of unac-
companied and separated children outside their 
country of origin” it emphasizes that for dis-
placed children, the principle must be respected 
during all stages of the displacement cycle and it 
gives some indication of what a “best interests’ 
determination” should consist of:
“At any of these stages, a best interests’ 
determination must be documented in 
preparation of any decision fundamentally 
impacting on the unaccompanied or separated 
child’s life. 
“A determination of what is in the best 
interests of the child requires a clear and 
comprehensive assessment of the child’s 
identity, including her or his nationality, 
upbringing, ethnic, cultural and linguistic 
background, particular vulnerabilities and 
protection needs. Consequently, allowing the 
child access to the territory is a prerequisite to 
this initial assessment process. The assessment 
process should be carried out in a friendly and 
safe atmosphere by qualified professionals 
who are trained in age and gender-sensitive 
interviewing techniques. 
“Subsequent steps, such as the appointment 
of a competent guardian as expeditiously as 
possible, serves as a key procedural safeguard 
to ensure respect for the best interests of 
an unaccompanied or separated child…” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 6, 2005, CRC/GC/2005/6, paras. 19-
21. The Committee covers the implications of article 
12 in these situations in a separate section of the 
General Comment (para. 25).)
In its General Comment on “HIV/AIDS and the 
rights of the child”, the Committee notes:
“Policies and programmes for the prevention, 
care and treatment of HIV/AIDS have 
generally been designed for adults with scarce 
attention to the principle of the best interests 
of the child as a primary consideration… 
The obligations attached to this right are 
fundamental to guiding the action of States 
in relation to HIV/AIDS. The child should be 
placed at the centre of the response to the 
pandemic, and strategies should be adapted to 
children’s rights and needs.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 3, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/3, para. 10)
“... shall be a primary 
consideration”
The wording indicates that the best interests of 
the child will not always be the single, overrid-
ing factor to be considered; there may be com-
peting or conflicting human rights interests, for 
example, between individual children, between 
different groups of children and between children 
and adults. The child’s interests, however, must 
be the subject of active consideration; it needs 
to be demonstrated that children’s interests have 
been explored and taken into account as a pri-
mary consideration.

Some debate took place in the Working Group 
drafting the Convention, and proposals were 
made that the article should refer to the child’s 
best interests as “the primary consideration” or 
“the paramount consideration”. These proposals 
were rejected. The very wide umbrella-like cov-
erage of article 3(1) – “in all actions concerning 
children” – includes actions in which other par-
ties may have equal claims to have their interests 
considered. (E/CN.4/L.1575, pp. 3 to 7, Detrick, 
pp. 132 and 133)
Where the phrase “best interests” is used else-
where in the Convention (see above, page 37), the 
focus is on deciding appropriate action for indi-
vidual children in particular circumstances and 
requires determination of the best interests of 
individual children. In such situations, the child’s 
interests are the paramount consideration (as 
stated explicitly in relation to adoption in article 
21; see page 295). 
Best interests principle 
to be reflected in legislation
The Committee has consistently emphasized that 
article 3, together with other identified general 
principles in the Convention, should be reflected 
in legislation and integrated into all relevant 
decision-making (and it confirms this in its 
General Comment No. 5 on “General measures of 
implementation for the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44, para. 6)” – see 
above, pages 36 and 37). 
The Committee has indicated also that it expects 
the best interests’ principle to be written into 
legislation in a way that enables it to be invoked 
before the courts. In examining second and sub-
sequent reports, the Committee continues to 
express concern that in practice the general 
principles contained in articles 3 and 12 are not 
respected. For example:
“While the Committee notes that the 
principles of the ‘best interests of the child’ 
(art. 3) and ‘respect for the views of the child’ 
(art. 12) have been incorporated in domestic 
legislation, it remains concerned that in 
practice, as it is recognized in the report, these 
principles are not respected owing to the fact 
that children are not yet perceived as persons 
entitled to rights and that the rights of the 
child are undermined by adults’ interests. The 
Committee recommends that further efforts 
be made to ensure the implementation of 
the principles of the ‘best interests of the 
child’ and ‘respect for the views of the child’, 
especially his or her rights to participate in 
the family, at school, within other institutions 
and in society in general. These principles 
should also be reflected in all policies and 
programmes relating to children. Awareness-
raising among the public at large, including 
traditional communities and religious leaders, 
as well as educational programmes on the 
implementation of these principles should be 
reinforced.” (Bolivia CRC/C/15/Add.95, para. 18)
“The Committee values the fact that the State 
Party holds the principle of the best interests 
of the child to be of vital importance in the 
development of all legislation, programmes 
and policies concerning children and is aware 
of the progress made in this respect. However, 
the Committee remains concerned that the 
principle that primary consideration should 
be given to the best interests of the child is 
still not adequately defined and reflected in 
some legislation, court decisions and policies 
affecting certain children, especially those 
facing situations of divorce, custody and 
deportation, as well as Aboriginal children. 
Furthermore, the Committee is concerned that 
there is insufficient research and training for 
professionals in this respect.
“The Committee recommends that the 
principle of ‘best interests of the child‘ 
contained in article 3 be appropriately 
analysed and objectively implemented with 
regard to individual and groups of children in 
various situations (e.g,. aboriginal children) 
and integrated in all reviews of legislation 
concerning children, legal procedures in 
courts, as well as in judicial and administrative 
decisions and in projects, programmes and 
services that have an impact on children. 
The Committee encourages the State Party 
to ensure that research and educational 
programmes for professionals dealing with 
children are reinforced and that article 3 of the 
Convention is fully understood, and that this 
principle is effectively implemented.” (Canada 
CRC/C/15/Add.215, paras. 24 and 25)
“As regards the general principle of the best 
interests of the child under article 3 of the 
Convention, the Committee is concerned that 
this principle is not given adequate attention 
in national legislation and policies and that 
this principle is not a primary consideration 
in decision-making regarding children, for 
example custody decisions. The Committee 
also notes with concern that awareness of its 
significance is low among the population.
“The Committee recalls its previous 
recommendation in this regard made upon the 
consideration of the State Party’s initial report 
and recommends that the State Party take 
measures to raise awareness of the meaning 
and practical application of the principle of the 
best interests of the child and to ensure that 
article 3 of the Convention is duly reflected 
in its legislation and administrative measures. 
The Committee recommends that the State 
Party review its legislation critically to ensure 
that the main thrust of the Convention, 
–> Table of Contents

r
t
i
c
l
e
Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
40
namely that children are subjects of their own 
rights, is adequately reflected in domestic 
legislation and that the best interests of the 
child is a primary consideration in all decision-
making regarding children, including custody 
decisions.” (Algeria CRC/C/15/Add.269, paras.29 
and 30)
“The Committee welcomes the assertion of 
the State Party that priority is given to the 
implementation of children’s rights, but it is 
concerned that the best interests of the child 
are insufficiently addressed under the pressure 
of the economic transformation and the 
pressures of an aging population.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party:
(a) Ensure that the general principle of 
the best interests of the child is a primary 
consideration and is fully integrated into all 
legislation relevant to children; and
(b) Ensure that this principle is applied in all 
political, judicial and administrative decisions, 
as well as projects, programmes and services 
that have an impact on children.” (Latvia 
CRC/C/LVA/CO/2, paras. 22 and 23)
When a “best interests’” principle is already 
reflected in national legislation, it is generally 
in relation to decision-making about individual 
children, in which the child is the primary, or a 
primary, subject or object – for example in family 
proceedings following separation or divorce of 
parents, in adoption and in state intervention to 
protect children from ill-treatment. It is much 
less common to find the principle in legislation 
covering other “actions” that concern groups 
of children or all children, but may not be 
specifically directed at children. The principle 
should apply, for example, to policy-making on 
employment, planning, transport and so on. Even 
within services whose major purpose is children’s 
development, for example education or health, the 
principle is often not written into the legislative 
framework. Thus, in relation to the United 
Kingdom, the Committee noted its concern 
“... about the apparent insufficiency of 
measures taken to ensure the implementation 
of the general principles of the Convention, 
namely the provisions of its articles 2, 3, 6, 
and 12. In this connection, the Committee 
observes in particular that the principle of the 
best interests of the child appears not to be 
reflected in legislation in such areas as health, 
education and social security which have a 
bearing on the respect for the rights of the 
child.” (United Kingdom CRC/C/15/Add.34,
 para. 11) 
It repeated its concern with emphasis, when it 
examined the United Kingdom’s Second Report 
(United Kingdom CRC/C/15/Add.188, paras. 25 
and 26).
Not subject to derogation
The Committee has emphasized that the general 
principles of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child are not subject to derogation in times of 
emergency. For example, in the report of its Day 
of General Discussion on “Children in armed 
conflict” the Committee commented that none of 
the general provisions in articles 2, 3 and 4 
“… admit a derogation in time of war or 
emergency”. (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, Report on the second session, September/
October 1992, CRC/C/10, para. 67)
States to ensure necessary 
protection and care for the child, 
taking account of rights and 
duties of parents and others 
legally responsible: article 3(2)
States must ensure necessary protection and 
care for all children in their jurisdiction. They 
must take account of the rights and duties of par-
ents and others legally responsible for the child. 
But there are many aspects of “care and protec-
tion” that individual parents cannot provide – for 
example, protection against environmental pol-
lution or traffic accidents. And where individ-
ual families are unable or unwilling to protect 
the child, the State must provide a “safety net”, 
ensuring the child’s well-being in all circum-
stances. Often, the obligations of State and par-
ent are closely related – for example, the State is 
required to make available compulsory free pri-
mary education; parents have a duty to ensure 
education in line with the child’s best interests.
A commentary published in the Bulletin of 
Human Rights emphasizes the “fundamental 
importance” of paragraph 2 of article 3: “Its sig-
nificance derives in the first place from its posi-
tion as an umbrella provision directed at ensuring, 
through one means or another, the well-being 
of the child. Secondly, its comprehensiveness 
means that it constitutes an important reference 
point in interpreting the general or overall obli-
gations of governments in the light of the more 
specific obligations contained in the remaining 
parts of the Convention. The obligation which is 
explicit in the undertaking ‘to ensure the child 
such protection and care as is necessary for his or 
her well-being’ is an unqualified one. While the 
next phrase makes it subject to the need to take 
account of the rights and duties of other entities, 
the obligation of the State Party, albeit as a last 
resort, is very clearly spelled out. The verb used to 
describe the obligation (‘to ensure’) is very strong 
and encompasses both passive and active (includ-
ing pro-active) obligations. The terms ‘protection

and care’ must also be read expansively, since 
their objective is not stated in limited or negative 
terms (such as ‘to protect the child from harm’) 
but rather in relation to the comprehensive ideal 
of ensuring the child’s ‘well-being’...” (Philip 
Alston, “The Legal framework of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child”, Bulletin of Human 
Rights, 91/2, p. 9)
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
very frequently referred to circumstances in 
which the State is failing to adequately provide 
for particular groups of vulnerable children. The 
most common category are children living and/or 
working on the streets, identified as existing in 
significant numbers in most States (see article  2, 
page 30 and article 20, page 286). Article 3(2) 
makes clear that, notwithstanding the rights and 
duties of parents and any others legally respon-
sible, the State has an active obligation to ensure 
such children’s well-being. This general obliga-
tion is linked to its obligations under the other 
general principles of the Convention in articles 2, 
6, and 12 and to any relevant specific obligations 
– for example to provide “appropriate assistance 
to parents and legal guardians” in their child-rear-
ing responsibilities under article 18(2), to provide 
“special protection and assistance” to children 
deprived of their family environment (article 
20(1)), to recognize the rights of children to ben-
efit from social security and to an adequate stan-
dard of living (articles 26 and 27) and to protect 
children from all forms of violence and exploita-
tion (articles 19, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37). 
Similarly, in times of economic recession or cri-
sis, or of environmental disaster or armed con-
flict this overriding active obligation comes into 
play, linked to other more specific provisions. In 
order to be able to fulfil its obligations, the State 
must ensure that it knows, as far as possible, 
when a child’s well-being is threatened and what 
additional State action is required. 
Institutions, services and 
facilities for care or protection 
of children must conform 
with established standards: 
article 3(3)
Standards must be established for institutions, 
services and facilities for children, and the State 
must ensure that the standards are complied with 
through appropriate inspection. Other articles 
refer to particular services that States Parties 
should ensure are available; for example “for the 
care of children” (under article 18(2) and (3)), alter-
native care provided for children deprived of their 
family environment (article 20), care for children 
with disabilities (article 23), rehabilitative care 
(article 39) and institutional and other care related 
to the juvenile justice system (article 40). There 
should also be health and educational institutions 
providing care or protection. 
Article 3(3) does not provide an exhaustive list of 
the areas in which standards must be established 
but it does mention “particularly in the areas of 
safety, health, in the number and suitability of 
their staff, as well as competent supervision.” In 
addition, services and institutions providing care 
and protection must comply with all other pro-
visions of the Convention, respecting, for exam-
ple, the principles of non-discrimination and best 
interests and the right of children to have their 
views and other civil rights respected and to be 
protected from all forms of violence and exploi-
tation (articles 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 32-37). 
In addition, article 25 (see page 379) sets out the 
right of a child who has been placed for care, pro-
tection or treatment “to a periodic review of the 
treatment provided to the child and all other cir-
cumstances relevant to his or her placement.” 
Implementation of article 3(3) requires a com-
prehensive review of the legislative framework 
applying to all such institutions and services, 
whether run directly by the State, or by voluntary 
and private bodies. The review needs to cover 
all services – care, including foster care and day 
care, health, education, penal institutions and 
so on. Consistent standards should be applied to 
all, with adequate independent inspection and 
monitoring. In institutions, widespread violence 
against children, both physical and sexual, has 
been uncovered in recent years in many States, 
emphasizing the lack of appropriate safeguards, 
including independent inspection and effective 
complaints procedures (see also article 12, page 
158 and article 19, pages 265 et seq.). 
In its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing 
child rights in early childhood”, the Committee 
notes:
“States Parties must ensure that the 
institutions, services and facilities responsible 
for early childhood conform to quality 
standards, particularly in the areas of 
health and safety, and that staff possess the 
appropriate psychosocial qualities and are 
suitable, sufficiently numerous and well-
trained. Provision of services appropriate 
to the circumstances, age and individuality 
of young children requires that all staff be 
trained to work with this age group. Work 
with young children should be socially valued 
and properly paid, in order to attract a highly 
qualified workforce, men as well as women. 
It is essential that they have sound, up-to-
date theoretical and practical understanding

about children’s rights and development...; 
that they adopt appropriate child-centred 
care practices, curricula and pedagogies; and 
that they have access to specialist professional 
resources and support, including a supervisory 
and monitoring system for public and private 
programmes, institutions and services.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 7, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 23)
The provision covers not only state-provided 
institutions, services and facilities but also all 
those “responsible” for the care or protection of 
children. In many countries, much of the non-
family care of children is provided by voluntary 
or private bodies, and in some States policies of 
privatization of services are taking more insti-
tutions out of direct state control. Article 3(3) 
requires standards to be established for all such 
institutions, services and facilities by competent 
bodies. Together with the non-discrimination 
principle in article 2, the standards must be con-
sistent and conform to the rest of the Convention. 
The Committee re-emphasized the need for con-
sistent standards across public and private sectors 
in the recommendations adopted following its 
Day of General Discussion on “The private sector 
as service provider and its role in implementing 
child rights” (Report on the thirty-first session, 
September/October 2002, CRC/C/121, pp. 152 et 
seq.). It referred to these recommendations and 
expanded on them in relation to early childhood 
services in its General Comment No. 7:
“… the Committee recommends that 
States Parties support the activities of the 
non-governmental sector as a channel for 
programme implementation. It further 
calls on all non-State service providers (‘for 
profit‘ as well as ‘non-profit’ providers) to 
respect the principles and provisions of the 
Convention and, in this regard, reminds 
States Parties of their primary obligation to 
ensure its implementation. Early childhood 
professionals – in both the state and non-state 
sectors – should be provided with thorough 
preparation, ongoing training and adequate 
remuneration. In this context, States Parties 
are responsible for service provision for early 
childhood development. The role of civil 
society should be complementary to – not a 
substitute for – the role of the State. Where 
non-State services play a major role, the 
Committee reminds States Parties that they 
have an obligation to monitor and regulate 
the quality of provision to ensure that 
children’s rights are protected and their best 
interests served.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 7, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/
Rev.1, para. 32) 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has fre-
quently commented on lack of qualified staff, lack 
of training and inadequate monitoring and super-
vision, in particular of institutions. For example, 
it expressed concern to Sri Lanka that there was 
no monitoring mechanism for either registered or 
unregistered institutions or voluntary homes, and 
recommended that the State should 
“… establish a uniform set of standards for 
public and private institutions and voluntary 
homes and monitor them regularly”. (Sri Lanka 
CRC/C/15/Add.207, paras. 32 and 33)
“… The Committee … also recommends the 
further training of personnel in all institutions, 
such as social, legal or educational workers. 
An important part of such training should be 
to emphasize the promotion and protection 
of the child’s sense of dignity and the issue of 
child neglect and maltreatment. Mechanisms 
to evaluate the ongoing training of personnel 
dealing with children are also required.” 
(Russian Federation CRC/C/15/Add.4, para. 19)
The Committee followed this up when it examined 
the Second Report of the Russian Federation:
“… In the light of article 3, paragraph 3, 
of the Convention, the Committee further 
recommends the reform, including legal 
reform, of the institutional system by the 
establishment of standards for conditions in 
institutions and their regular inspection, in 
particular by reinforcing the role and powers 
of independent inspection mechanisms and 
ensuring their right to inspect foster homes 
and public institutions without warning…” 
(Russian Federation CRC/C/15/Add.110, para. 39)
And it returned to the issue on examination of the 
Third Report, noting again the need for “indepen-
dent public inspections of children’s institutions” 
(CRC/C/RUS/CO/3, paras. 44 and 45).

Reminder: The Convention is indivisible and its articles interdependent. Article 3(1) 
has been identified by the Committee on the Rights of the Child as a general principle 
of relevance to implementation of the whole Convention. Article 3(2) provides States 
with a general obligation to ensure necessary protection and care for the child’s well-
being. 
Particular regard should be paid to:
The general principles
Article 2: all rights to be recognized for each child in the jurisdiction without discrimination on any 
ground 
Article 6: right to life and maximum possible survival and development
Article 12: respect for the child’s views in all matters affecting the child; opportunity to be heard in 
any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting the child

of the child’s best interests
Article 9: separation from parents
Article 18: parental responsibilities for their children

IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS IN THE CONVENTION

tation, the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
has proposed a wide range of strategies to ensure 
Governments give appropriate priority and atten-
tion to children in order to implement the whole 
Convention effectively. From the beginning, in its 
Guidelines for Initial Reports, the Committee has 
emphasized the particular importance of ensur-
ing that all domestic legislation is compatible 
with the Convention and that there is appropriate 
coordination of policy affecting children within 
and between all levels of government. 
In 2003, the Committee adopted a detailed 
General Comment on “General measures of 
implementation of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44, para. 6)” (CRC/
GC/2003/5; for full text see www.ohchr.org/
english/bodies/crc/comments.htm). In a foreword, 
the Committee indicates that the various elements 
of the concept are complex and that it is likely to 
issue more detailed general comments on individ-
ual elements in due course. It also notes the rel-
evance of its General Comment No. 2 on “The role 
of independent national human rights institutions 
in the protection and promotion of the rights of the 
child” (CRC/GC/2002/2; see below, page 66). 
■
rticle 4 sets out States’ overall obliga-
tions to implement all the rights in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
They must take “all appropriate legis-
lative, administrative, and other measures”. Only 
in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, 
is there the qualification that such measures shall 
be undertaken to the maximum extent of their 
available resources and, where needed, within the 
framework of international cooperation. Neither 
the Convention itself nor the Committee defines 
which of the articles include civil and political 
rights and which economic, social or cultural 
rights. It is clear that almost all articles include 
elements which amount to civil or political rights 
(see page 52).
Other general implementation obligations on 
States Parties are provided by article 2 (to respect 
and ensure the rights in the Convention to all 
children without discrimination, see page 21), 
and article 3(2) (to “undertake to ensure the child 
such protection and care as is necessary for his or 
her well-being...” see page 40). 
While emphasizing that there is no favoured 
legislative or administrative model for implemen-
Text of Article 4
States Parties shall undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures 
for the implementation of the rights recognized in the present Convention. With regard to 
economic, social and cultural rights, States Parties shall undertake such measures to the 
maximum extent of their available resources and, where needed, within the framework of 
international cooperation.

General measures of 
implementation
As a Committee member commented in 1995 
during examination of Canada’s Initial Report: 
“... given the wide range of different administra-
tive and legislative systems among the [then] 174 
States Parties, the Committee was in no position 
to specify particular solutions. Indeed, a degree 
of diversity in the mechanisms set up to imple-
ment the Convention might lead to a degree of 
competition, which could be very beneficial. The 
important point was that the Convention should 
be the main benchmark and inspiration of action 
at the provincial and central levels...” (Canada 
CRC/C/SR.214, para. 54)
In its 2003 General Comment No. 5 on “General 
measures of implementation of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44, para. 
6)”, the Committee provides detailed guidance to 
States. It first explains and defines the concept:
“When a State ratifies the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, it takes on obligations 
under international law to implement it. 
Implementation is the process whereby States 
Parties take action to ensure the realization 
of all rights in the Convention for all children 
in their jurisdiction. Article 4 requires States 
Parties to take ‘all appropriate legislative, 
administrative and other measures’ for 
implementation of the rights contained 
therein. While it is the State which takes 
on obligations under the Convention, its 
task of implementation – of making reality 
of the human rights of children – needs to 
engage all sectors of society and, of course, 
children themselves. Ensuring that all 
domestic legislation is fully compatible with 
the Convention and that the Convention’s 
principles and provisions can be directly applied 
and appropriately enforced is fundamental. In 
addition, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child has identified a wide range of measures 
that are needed for effective implementation, 
including the development of special structures 
and monitoring, training and other activities 
in Government, parliament and the judiciary at 
all levels.
“In its periodic examination of States Parties’ 
reports under the Convention, the Committee 
pays particular attention to what it has termed 
‘general measures of implementation‘. In its 
Concluding Observations issued following 
examination, the Committee provides 
specific recommendations relating to general 
measures. It expects the State Party to 
describe action taken in response to these 
recommendations in its subsequent periodic 
report…” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, 
paras. 1 and 2). 
The Committee’s reporting guidelines arrange 
the Convention’s articles in clusters, the first 
being on “general measures of implementation”. 
This groups article 4 with article 42 (the obliga-
tion to make the content of the Convention widely 
known to children and adults; see page 627) and 
article 44, paragraph 6 (the obligation to make 
reports widely available within the State; see 
page 652).
The outcome document from the United Nations 
General Assembly’s special session on children, 
A World Fit for Children, committed governments 
to develop measures for implementation (Report 
of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the 
twenty-seventh special session of the General 
Assembly, 2002, A/S-27/19/Rev.1, see box).
The Committee notes, from its examination of 
reports over the first decade, positive indications 
that children are becoming more visible in gov-
ernment:
“The general measures of implementation 
identified by the Committee and described in 
the present general comment are intended 
to promote the full enjoyment of all rights 
in the Convention by all children, through 
legislation, the establishment of coordinating 
and monitoring bodies – governmental 
and independent – comprehensive data 
collection, awareness-raising and training 
and the development and implementation of 
appropriate policies, services and programmes. 
One of the satisfying results of the adoption 
and almost universal ratification of the 
Convention has been the development at 
the national level of a wide variety of new 
child-focused and child-sensitive bodies, 
structures and activities – children’s rights 
units at the heart of Government, ministers 
for children, interministerial committees on 
children, parliamentary committees, child 
impact analysis, children’s budgets and ‘state 
of children’s rights’ reports, NGO coalitions on 
children’s rights, children’s ombudspersons and 
children’s rights commissioners and so on.
“While some of these developments may 
seem largely cosmetic, their emergence at 
the least indicates a change in the perception 
of the child’s place in society, a willingness 
to give higher political priority to children 
and an increasing sensitivity to the impact of 
governance on children and their human rights.
“The Committee emphasizes that, in the 
context of the Convention, States must see 
their role as fulfilling clear legal obligations 
to each and every child. Implementation of 
the human rights of children must not be seen 
as a charitable process, bestowing favours on 
children…” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, 
paras. 9 to 11)

IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS IN THE CONVENTION

l
e
Each of the International Covenants has articles 
similar to article 4 of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, setting out overall implementation 
obligations; and the responsible Treaty Bodies 
have developed relevant General Comments. 
Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, on implementation, includes 
as its first paragraph the non-discrimination prin-
ciple, equivalent to article 2(1) of the Convention. 
Paragraph 2 states: “Where not already provided 
for by existing legislative or other measures, each 
State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to 
take the necessary steps, in accordance with its 
constitutional processes and with the provisions of 
the present Covenant, to adopt such legislative or 
other measures as may be necessary to give effect 
to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.” 
Paragraph 3 requires States Parties to the 
Covenant to ensure an “effective remedy” for any 
person whose rights or freedoms as recognized 
by the Covenant are violated. In an early General 
Comment, the Human Rights Committee notes 
that article 2 of the Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights “generally leaves it to the States Parties 
concerned to choose their method of implemen-
tation in their territories, within the framework 
set out in that article. It recognizes, in particular, 
that the implementation does not depend solely 
on constitutional or legislative enactments, which 
in themselves are often not per se sufficient. The 
[Human Rights] Committee considers it neces-
sary to draw the attention of States Parties to the 
fact that the obligation under the Covenant is not 
confined to the respect of human rights, but that 
States Parties have also undertaken to ensure the 
enjoyment of these rights to all individuals under 
their jurisdiction. This aspect calls for specific 
activities by the States Parties to enable individu-
als to enjoy their rights...” The General Comment 
goes on to emphasize the importance of ensur-
ing that individuals know what their rights are 
– an obligation included in the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child in article 42 (see page 627) 
(Human Rights Committee, General Comment 
No. 3, 1981, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 1, p. 164).
Review and withdrawal 
of reservations
The first item raised by the Committee’s report-
ing Guidelines under general measures of imple-
mentation is the review and withdrawal of any 
reservations which the State Party may have 
made. 
General Comment No. 5 states:
“States Parties to the Convention are entitled 
to make reservations at the time of their 
ratification of or accession to it (art. 51). 
The Committee’s aim of ensuring full and 
unqualified respect for the human rights 
of children can be achieved only if States 
withdraw their reservations. It consistently 
recommends during its examination of reports 
that reservations be reviewed and withdrawn. 
Where a State, after review, decides to 
maintain a reservation, the Committee 
requests that a full explanation be included 
in the next Periodic Report. The Committee 
draws the attention of States Parties to 
the encouragement given by the World 
Conference on Human Rights to the review 
and withdrawal of reservations.
“Article 2 of the Vienna Convention on the 
Law of Treaties defines ‘reservation’ as a 
‘unilateral statement, however phrased 
Building a world fit for children
“We, the Governments participating in the special session, commit ourselves to implementing the 
Plan of Action through consideration of such measures as:
(a) Putting in place, as appropriate, effective national legislation, policies and action plans and 
allocating resources to fulfil and protect the rights and to secure the well-being of children;
(b) Establishing or strengthening national bodies, such as, inter alia, independent ombudspersons 
for children, where appropriate, or other institutions for the promotion and protection of the 
rights of the child;
(c) Developing national monitoring and evaluation systems to assess the impact of our actions on 
children;
(d) Enhancing widespread awareness and understanding of the rights of the child.”
(Extract from “A World Fit for Children”, outcome document of the 2002 United Nations General 
Assembly’s special session on children, Report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the twenty-
seventh special session of the General Assembly, 2002, A/S-27/19/Rev.1, para. 31)

or named, made by a State, when signing, 
ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to 
a Treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to 
modify the legal effect of certain provisions of 
the Treaty in their application to that State’. 
The Vienna Convention notes that States are 
entitled, at the time of ratification or accession 
to a treaty, to make a reservation unless it is 
‘incompatible with the object and purpose of 
the treaty’ (art. 19).
“Article 51, paragraph 2, of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child reflects this: ‘A 
reservation incompatible with the object 
and purpose of the present Convention shall 
not be permitted.’ The Committee is deeply 
concerned that some States have made 
reservations which plainly breach article 51(2) 
by suggesting, for example, that respect for 
the Convention is limited by the State’s existing 
Constitution or legislation, including in some 
cases religious law. Article 27 of the Vienna 
Convention on the Law of Treaties provides: 
‘A party may not invoke the provisions of its 
internal law as justification for its failure to 
perform a treaty.’
“The Committee notes that, in some cases, 
States Parties have lodged formal objections to 
such wide-ranging reservations made by other 
States Parties. It commends any action which 
contributes to ensuring the fullest possible 
respect for the Convention in all States 
Parties.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, 
paras. 13 to 16)
In examining States Parties’ reports, the 
Committee consistently asks States to review and 
withdraw reservations, in particular where a res-
ervation appears incompatible with the object and 
purpose of the Convention (see also article 51, 
page 657). For example, Iran lodged a reservation 
which states: “The Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran reserves the right not to apply 
any provisions or articles of the Convention that 
are incompatible with Islamic Laws and the inter-
nal legislation in effect.” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 25) 
The Committee commented:
“... the Committee is nevertheless concerned 
that the broad and imprecise nature of the 
State Party’s general reservation potentially 
negates many of the Convention’s provisions 
and raises concerns as to its compatibility with 
the object and purpose of the Convention.” 
(Islamic Republic of Iran CRC/C/15/Add.123, 
para. 7)
It returned to this when it examined Iran’s Second 
Report, stating that it 
“… deeply regrets that no review has been 
undertaken of the broad and imprecise 
nature of the State Party’s reservation since 
the submission of the Initial Report”. (Islamic 
Republic of Iran CRC/C/15/Add.254, para. 6)
Similarly, the Committee told Jordan:
“The Committee is concerned that the broad 
and imprecise nature of the reservation 
to article 14 potentially gives rise to 
infringements of the freedoms of thought, 
conscience and religion, and raises questions of 
its compatibility with the object and purpose 
of the Convention.
“In light of its previous recommendation 
(Jordan CRC/C/15/Add.21), the Committee 
recommends to the State Party to study 
its reservation to article 14 with a view to 
narrowing it, taking account of the Human 
Rights Committee’s General Comment No. 22 
and recommendations (CCPR/C/79/Add.35), 
and eventually, to withdraw it in accordance 
with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action.” (Jordan CRC/C/15/Add.125, paras. 12 and 13)
Ratification of other 
international instruments
During its examination of reports, the Committee 
consistently encourages States Parties to con-
sider signing and ratifying or acceding to the 
two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, on the involvement of children 
in armed conflict (see page 659) and on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornogra-
phy (see page 669) and other international human 
rights instruments, “in the light of the principles 
of indivisibility and interdependence of human 
rights”. In its General Comment No. 5 it includes 
a non-exhaustive list of instruments in an annex 
which it indicates it will update from time to 
time (see Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 5, CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 
17 and annex; see box, opposite). 
“With regard to economic, 
social and cultural rights, 
States Parties shall undertake 
such measures to the maximum 
extent of their available 
resources...”
During the drafting of the Convention, an early 
version of what was to become article 4 qualified 
States Parties’ obligations by including the phrase 
“in accordance with their available resources”. A 
number of delegates proposed its deletion, on the 
grounds that the civil and political rights guaran-
teed in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights were not subject to the availabil-
ity of resources, and that the Covenant’s standards 
should not be limited in the new Convention. 
But some delegates argued for the retention of 
the qualification (E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 30 and 31; 
Detrick, p. 155).

Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child

The compromise proposal that was accepted dif-
ferentiates civil and political rights from eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights. States Parties are 
to undertake “all appropriate legislative, adminis-
trative and other measures” for the implementa-
tion of all rights recognized in the Convention. 
But in relation to economic, social and cultural 
rights, these measures are to be undertaken “to 
the maximum extent of their available resources 
and, where needed, within the framework of inter-
national cooperation”.
The Committee explains in General Comment 
No. 5: 
“There is no simple or authoritative division 
of human rights in general or of Convention 
rights into the two categories. The Committee’s 
reporting guidelines [original Guidelines for 
Periodic reports, CRC/C/58] group articles 7, 8, 
13-17 and 37(a) under the heading ‘Civil rights 
and freedoms’, but indicate by the context that 
these are not the only civil and political rights 
in the Convention. Indeed, it is clear that many 
other articles, including articles 2, 3, 6 and 12 
of the Convention, contain elements which 
constitute civil/political rights, thus reflecting 
the interdependence and indivisibility of all 
human rights. Enjoyment of economic, social 
and cultural rights is inextricably intertwined 
with enjoyment of civil and political rights. As 
noted … below, the Committee believes that 
economic, social and cultural rights, as well as 
civil and political rights, should be regarded as 
justiciable.
“The second sentence of article 4 reflects a 
realistic acceptance that lack of resources – 
financial and other resources – can hamper the 
full implementation of economic, social and 
cultural rights in some States; this introduces 
the concept of ‘progressive realization’ 
of such rights: States need to be able to 
demonstrate that they have implemented 
‘to the maximum extent of their available 
resources’ and, where necessary, have sought 
international cooperation. When States ratify 
the Convention, they take upon themselves 
obligations not only to implement it within 
their jurisdiction, but also to contribute, 
through international cooperation, to global 
implementation.
“… Whatever their economic circumstances, 
States are required to undertake all possible 
measures towards the realization of the rights 
of the child, paying special attention to the 
most disadvantaged groups.” (Committee on 
the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 6 to 8)
Progressive implementation: General
Comment of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
The concept of progressive realization of eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights is reflected 
in paragraph 1 of article 2 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights: “Each State Party to the present Covenant 
undertakes to take steps, individually and through 
international assistance and cooperation, espe-
cially economic and technical, to the maximum 
of its available resources, with a view to achiev-
ing progressively the full realization of the rights 
recognized in the present Covenant by all appro-
priate means, including particularly the adoption 
of legislative measures.” Paragraph 2 provides 
the principle of non-discrimination. Paragraph 
3 states: “Developing countries, with due regard 
to human rights and their national economy, may 
determine to what extent they would guarantee 
the economic rights recognized in the present 
Covenant to non-nationals.”
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights made a detailed General Comment on 
the nature of States Parties’ obligations in 1990. 
Those relating to the adoption of legal measures 
are quoted below (see box, page 56). As regards 
progressive realization through the maximum 
use of available resources, the Committee states: 
“The concept of progressive realization consti-
tutes a recognition of the fact that full realiza-
tion of all economic, social and cultural rights 
will generally not be able to be achieved in a 
short period of time. In this sense the obligation 
differs significantly from that contained in art-
icle 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights which embodies an immediate 
obligation to respect and ensure all of the relevant 
rights. Nevertheless, the fact that realization over 
time, or in other words progressively, is foreseen 
under the Covenant should not be misinterpreted 
as depriving the obligation of all meaningful con-
tent. It is on the one hand a necessary flexibility 
device, reflecting the realities of the real world 
and the difficulties involved for any country in 
ensuring full realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights. On the other hand, the phrase 
must be read in the light of the overall objective, 
indeed the raison d’être of the Covenant which 
is to establish clear obligations for States Parties 
in respect of the full realization of the rights in 
question. It thus imposes an obligation to move as 
expeditiously and effectively as possible towards 
that goal. Moreover, any deliberately retrogressive 
measures in that regard would require the most 
careful consideration and would need to be fully 
justified by reference to the totality of the rights 
provided for in the Covenant and in the context of 
the full use of the maximum available resources...
“... the Committee is of the view that a minimum 
core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at 
the very least, minimum essential levels of each

of the rights is incumbent upon every State Party. 
Thus, for example, a State Party in which any 
significant number of individuals is deprived of 
essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health 
care, of basic shelter and housing, or of the most 
basic forms of education is, prima facie, failing 
to discharge its obligations under the Covenant. If 
the Covenant were to be read in such a way as not 
to establish such a minimum core obligation, it 
would be largely deprived of its raison d’être. By 
the same token, it must be noted that any assess-
ment as to whether a State has discharged its min-
imum core obligation must also take account of 
resource constraints applying within the country 
concerned. Article 2(1) obligates each State Party 
to take the necessary steps ‘to the maximum of 
its available resources’. In order for a State Party 
to be able to attribute its failure to meet at least its 
minimum core obligations to a lack of available 
resources, it must demonstrate that every effort 
has been made to use all resources that are at its 
disposition in an effort to satisfy, as a matter of 
priority, those minimum obligations.
“The Committee wishes to emphasize, how-
ever, that even where the available resources are 
demonstrably inadequate, the obligation remains 
for a State Party to strive to ensure the widest 
possible enjoyment of the relevant rights under 
the prevailing circumstances. Moreover, the obli-
gations to monitor the extent of the realization, 
or more especially of the non-realization, of eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights, and to devise 
strategies and programmes for their promo-
tion, are not in any way eliminated as a result of 
resource constraints...” (Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment 
No. 3, 1990, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 11, pp. 17 
and 18. See also box below, page 56.)
The approach of the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights to the concept of “the 
maximum use of available resources” is applica-
ble to interpretation of article 4 of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, and the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child concurs with it in its 
own General Comment No. 5 (CRC/GC/2003/5, 
para. 8). 
The “available resources” which can be harnessed 
within a State for the implementation of rights 
extend well beyond financial resources; there are 
also human and organizational resources. 
“all appropriate legislative… 
measures”
Ensuring all legislation is fully 
compatible with the Convention: 
the need for a comprehensive 
review
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
emphasized that an essential aspect of imple-
mentation is ensuring that all legislation is “fully 
compatible” with the provisions and principles of 
the Convention, requiring a comprehensive and 
ongoing review of all legislation (where neces-
sary, it has proposed that countries should seek 
technical assistance within the framework of 
international cooperation). It reiterates this in 
General Comment No. 5:
“The Committee believes a comprehensive 
review of all domestic legislation and 
related administrative guidance to ensure 
full compliance with the Convention is an 
obligation. Its experience in examining not 
only initial but now second and third periodic 
reports under the Convention suggests that 
the review process at the national level has, in 
most cases, been started, but needs to be more 
rigorous. The review needs to consider the 
Convention not only article by article, but also 
holistically, recognizing the interdependence 
and indivisibility of human rights. The review 
needs to be continuous rather than one-
off, reviewing proposed as well as existing 
legislation. And while it is important that 
this review process should be built into 
the machinery of all relevant government 
departments, it is also advantageous to 
have independent review by, for example, 
parliamentary committees and hearings, 
national human rights institutions, NGOs, 
academics, affected children and young people 
and others.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 5, CRC/GC/2003/5, 
para. 18)
The Committee has emphasized that any sys-
tems of “customary” or regional or local law must 
also be reviewed and made compatible with the 
Convention:
“… the coexistence of customary law and 
statutory law does affect the implementation 
of the Convention in the State Party where 
traditional practices are not conducive to 
respect for children’s rights.” (Burkina Faso 
CRC/C/15/Add.193, para. 4)
Giving legal effect to all the rights 
in the Convention 
The Convention proposes that States should 
undertake “legislative, administrative, and other 
measures” to implement all the rights it contains 
– including economic, social and cultural rights. 
Thus, as regards legal implementation, there 
is no question of the Convention being divided 
into two categories of rights – social/economic/
cultural and civil/political – with only the latter 
being implemented as legally enforceable rights.

54
As noted above, the Convention does not iden-
tify which of its rights are “economic, social, and 
cultural”. And in fact, it is clear that almost all 
articles include at least elements that constitute 
civil/political rights. 
Although lack of available resources may restrict 
full implementation of some Convention rights, 
and no law on its own can make poverty or unac-
ceptable inequalities disappear, this does not 
mean that economic, social and cultural rights 
cannot be defined in legislation or are non-
justiciable. The Convention requires States, for 
example, to define a period of compulsory, free 
education, ages for admission to employment, 
and so on. Rights can be drafted as goals towards 
which the State undertakes to work; or the legis-
lation can expressly include the principle of “the 
maximum extent of available resources”. 
The Committee’s General Comment No. 5 dis-
cusses the varied approaches to giving effect to 
international instruments in domestic legislation:
“States Parties need to ensure, by all 
appropriate means, that the provisions of 
the Convention are given legal effect within 
their domestic legal systems. This remains a 
challenge in many States Parties. Of particular 
importance is the need to clarify the extent of 
applicability of the Convention in States where 
the principle of ‘self-execution’ applies and 
others where it is claimed that the Convention 
‘has constitutional status’ or has been 
incorporated into domestic law.
“The Committee welcomes the incorporation 
of the Convention into domestic law, 
which is the traditional approach to the 
implementation of international human 
rights instruments in some but not all States. 
Incorporation should mean that the provisions 
of the Convention can be directly invoked 
before the courts and applied by national 
authorities and that the Convention will 
prevail where there is a conflict with domestic 
legislation or common practice. Incorporation 
by itself does not avoid the need to ensure 
that all relevant domestic law, including 
any local or customary law, is brought into 
compliance with the Convention. In case of any 
conflict in legislation, predominance should 
always be given to the Convention, in the 
light of article 27 of the Vienna Convention on 
the Law of Treaties. Where a State delegates 
powers to legislate to federated, regional or 
territorial governments, it must also require 
these subsidiary governments to legislate 
within the framework of the Convention and 
to ensure effective implementation...
“Some States have suggested to the 
Committee that the inclusion in their 
Constitution of guarantees of rights for 
‘everyone’ is adequate to ensure respect for 
these rights for children. The test must be 
whether the applicable rights are truly realized 
for children and can be directly invoked 
before the courts. The Committee welcomes 
the inclusion of sections on the rights of the 
child in national constitutions, reflecting key 
principles in the Convention, which helps to 
underline the key message of the Convention 
– that children alongside adults are holders 
of human rights. But this inclusion does not 
automatically ensure respect for the rights 
of children. In order to promote the full 
implementation of these rights, including, 
where appropriate, the exercise of rights by 
children themselves, additional legislative and 
other measures may be necessary.
“The Committee emphasizes, in particular, 
the importance of ensuring that domestic 
law reflects the identified general principles 
in the Convention (arts. 2, 3, 6 and 12). The 
Committee welcomes the development of 
consolidated children’s rights statutes, which 
can highlight and emphasize the Convention’s 
principles. But the Committee emphasizes 
that it is crucial in addition that all relevant 
‘sectoral’ laws (on education, health, justice 
and so on) reflect consistently the principles 
and standards of the Convention.” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, paras.19, 20 and 22)
The Committee continues to encourage incorpo-
ration of the Convention; so when it examined 
Germany’s Second Report, it noted:
“The Committee is aware of the numerous 
laws relevant to children’s rights which have 
been adopted since the consideration of the 
initial report but remains concerned that the 
Convention has not been incorporated into the 
Basic Law, as foreseen at the time of the initial 
report.
“In light of its previous recommendations 
(para. 21), the Committee recommends that 
the State Party… reconsider the incorporation 
of the Convention into the Basic Law…” 
(Germany CRC/C/15/Add.226, paras. 9 and 10)
And it pursues the development of comprehensive 
children’s rights statutes or children’s codes:
“The Committee notes the adoption of the 
Child Protection Act No. 5 of 1997, in addition 
to the numerous other laws and decisions that 
have been adopted with a view to improving 
the welfare of children. It is concerned, 
however, that many measures reflect a 
predominantly welfare- rather than rights-
based approach. The Committee reiterates 
its concern that several rights contained in 
the Convention (e.g., non-discrimination, the 
best interests of the child, rights concerning 
juvenile justice) are not adequately reflected in 
the laws, including personal status laws.
“The Committee encourages the State Party:
(a) To ensure that its laws, administrative

regulations and legal procedure rules conform 
to the provisions and principles of the 
Convention and to other international human 
right standards; in this respect, it encourages 
the State Party to take the necessary steps to 
adopt a single ‘integrated‘ law on children’s 
rights in order to provide a comprehensive 
legal foundation at the domestic level for 
implementation of Convention rights; 
(b) To take all possible measures to reconcile 
the interpretation of religious laws with 
fundamental human rights; and
(c) To ensure that laws are based on a 
child-rights approach, are sufficiently clear 
and precise, are published, and are accessible 
to the public.” (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya CRC/C/15/
Add.209, paras. 7 and 8)
“The Committee welcomes the incorporation 
of numerous articles on child rights in 
the Constitution, which also affirms that 
international instruments ratified by Colombia 
prevail over domestic legislation. The 
Committee however regrets that the reform 
of the inadequate Minors’ Code from 1989 has 
not yet been completed despite ten years of 
debate and numerous calls by United Nations 
entities for amendments to take place in order 
to bring national legislation in line with the 
obligations undertaken by the ratification of 
the Convention of the Rights of the Child… 
“The Committee reiterates its concern in 
this regard and recommends that the State 
Party promptly complete the process of the 
reform of the Minors’ Code in order to provide 
effective protection of the rights of all children 
in Colombia, taking into account the following 
four areas of concern in order to bring them 
into conformity with the Convention; juvenile 
justice, adoption, work and protection against 
abuse of children.” (Colombia CRC/C/COL/CO/3, 
paras. 9 and 10)
Once appropriate legislation is in force, the 
Committee frequently alludes to problems with 
the implementation of it, commenting on Latvia’s 
Second Report:
“The Committee is concerned, however, that 
there is a gap between law and practice, 
particularly in the areas of education, health 
care, juvenile justice and protection from 
violence. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party revise or amend laws where necessary, 
and take the necessary measures, inter alia, 
by providing adequate human and financial 
resources, to ensure the implementation of the 
laws in order to bring them in full compliance 
with the Convention.” (Latvia, CRC/C/LVA/CO/2, 
paras. 9 and 10)
Remedies for breaches of rights
The Committee’s General Comment No. 5 
emphasizes that legislation, policy and practice 
must provide children with remedies when their 
rights are breached:
“For rights to have meaning, effective 
remedies must be available to redress 
violations. This requirement is implicit in the 
Convention and consistently referred to in the 
other six major international human rights 
treaties. Children’s special and dependent 
status creates real difficulties for them in 
pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights. 
So States need to give particular attention 
to ensuring that there are effective, child-
sensitive procedures available to children and 
their representatives. These should include 
the provision of child-friendly information, 
advice, and advocacy, including support for 
self-advocacy, and access to independent 
complaints procedures and to the courts with 
necessary legal and other assistance. Where 
rights are found to have been breached, there 
should be appropriate reparation, including 
compensation, and, where needed, measures 
to promote physical and psychological 
recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration, as 
required by article 39.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 24)
The Committee underlines again that economic, 
social and cultural rights must be justiciable and 
to enable remedies for non-compliance with such 
rights to be effective, the law must set out entitle-
ments in sufficient detail (paras. 24 and 25).
“all appropriate... 
administrative, and other 
measures...”
While noting again that the Committee can-
not prescribe in detail the measures which each 
and every State should take to ensure effective 
implementation of the Convention, it suggests 
that it has distilled useful advice in its General 
Comment No. 5 from the first decade’s experi-
ence of examining reports and dialogue with gov-
ernments, United Nations agencies, NGOs and 
others. Coordination is vital:
“The Committee believes that effective 
implementation of the Convention requires 
visible cross-sectoral coordination to 
recognize and realize children’s rights across 
Government, between different levels of 
government and between Government and 
civil society – including in particular children 
and young people themselves. Invariably, many 
different government departments and other 
governmental or quasi-governmental bodies 
affect children’s lives and children’s enjoyment 
of their rights. Few, if any, government 
departments have no effect on children’s 
lives, direct or indirect. Rigorous monitoring 
of implementation is required, which should

Legislating economic, social and cultural rights
General Comments of the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights 
The importance of legislative measures to implement economic, social and cultural rights is stressed 
in General Comments of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Paragraph 1 
of article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requires that: 
“Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through 
international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of 
its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights 
recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of 
legislative measures.”
General Comment No. 3
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights comments: “Article 2 is of particular 
importance to a full understanding of the Covenant and must be seen as having a dynamic rela-
tionship with all of the other provisions of the Covenant. It describes the nature of the general 
legal obligations undertaken by States Parties to the Covenant. Those obligations include both 
what may be termed (following the work of the International Law Commission) obligations of con-
duct and obligations of result. While great emphasis has sometimes been placed on the difference 
between the formulations used in this provision and that contained in the equivalent article 2 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it is not always recognized that there are also 
significant similarities [article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires 
States to “adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights 
in the present Covenant” and to ensure an “effective remedy” is available when such rights are vio-
lated.] In particular, while the Covenant provides for progressive realization and acknowledges the 
constraints due to the limits of available resources, it also imposes various obligations that are of 
immediate effect. Of these, two are of particular importance in understanding the precise nature of 
States Parties’ obligations. One of these, which is dealt with in a separate General Comment ... is 
the ‘undertaking to guarantee’ that relevant rights ‘will be exercised without discrimination...’
“The other is the undertaking in article 2(1) ‘to take steps’, which, in itself, is not qualified or lim-
ited by other considerations. The full meaning of the phrase can also be gauged by noting some of 
the different language versions. In English the undertaking is ‘to take steps’, in French it is ‘to act’ 
(s’engage à agir) and in Spanish it is ‘to adopt measures’ (a adoptar medidas). Thus, while the full 
realization of the relevant rights may be achieved progressively, steps towards that goal must be 
taken within a reasonably short term after the Covenant’s entry into force for the States concerned. 
Such steps should be deliberate, concrete, and targeted as clearly as possible towards meeting the 
obligations recognized in the Covenant.
“The means which should be used in order to satisfy the obligation to take steps are stated in article 
2(1) to be ‘all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures’. The 
Committee recognizes that in many instances legislation is highly desirable and in some cases may 
even be indispensable. For example, it may be difficult to combat discrimination effectively in the 
absence of a sound legislative foundation for the necessary measures. In fields such as health, the 
protection of children and mothers, and education, as well as in respect of the matters dealt with in 
articles 6 to 9 [employment and social security rights] legislation may also be an indispensable ele-
ment for many purposes…
“Among the measures which might be considered appropriate, in addition to legislation, is the pro-
vision of judicial remedies with respect to rights which may, in accordance with the national legal 
system, be considered justiciable… “Where specific policies aimed directly at the realization of 
the rights recognized in the Covenant have been adopted in legislative form, the Committee would 
wish to be informed, inter alia, as to whether such laws create any right of action on behalf of indi-
viduals or groups who feel that their rights are not being fully realized. In cases where constitu-

tional recognition has been accorded to specific economic, social and cultural rights, or where the 
provisions of the Covenant have been incorporated directly into national law, the Committee would 
wish to receive information as to the extent to which these rights are considered to be justiciable 
(i.e., able to be invoked before the courts). The Committee would also wish to receive specific 
information as to any instances in which existing constitutional provisions relating to economic, 
social and cultural rights have been weakened or significantly changed.” 
(Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 3, 1990, HRI/GEN/1/
Rev.8, paras 1, 2, 3 and 5, pp. 15 and 16)
In 1998, in another General Comment, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
expanded on States’ obligations to recognize the norms in the International Covenant in domestic 
law. 
General Comment No. 8
It emphasizes that “appropriate means of redress, or remedies, must be available to any aggrieved 
individual or group, and appropriate means of ensuring government accountability must be put in 
place”. It quotes two relevant principles of international law: “The first, as reflected in article 27 
of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, is that ‘[A] party may not invoke the provisions 
of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty’. In other words, States should 
modify the domestic legal order as necessary in order to give effect to their treaty obligations. The 
second principle is reflected in article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according 
to which ‘Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts 
violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law’.”
The General Comment notes that “In general, legally binding international human rights standards 
should operate directly and immediately within the domestic legal system of each State Party, 
thereby enabling individuals to seek enforcement of their rights before national courts and tribu-
nals. The rule requiring the exhaustion of domestic remedies reinforces the primacy of national 
remedies in this respect. The existence and further development of international procedures for the 
pursuit of individual claims is important, but such procedures are ultimately only supplementary to 
effective national remedies.”
The General Comment indicates that the Covenant does not specify particular means of implemen-
tation, but that the means chosen must be adequate to fulfil obligations; while the Covenant does 
not formally require States to incorporate its provisions into domestic law, “such an approach is 
desirable”.
In relation to the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights in the Covenant, the General 
Comment suggests that “there is no Covenant right, which could not, in the great majority of sys-
tems, be considered to possess at least some significant justiciable dimensions. It is sometimes sug-
gested that matters involving the allocation of resources should be left to the political authorities 
rather than the courts. While the respective competences of the various branches of government 
must be respected, it is appropriate to acknowledge that courts are generally already involved in a 
considerable range of matters which have important resource implications. The adoption of a rigid 
classification of economic, social and cultural rights which puts them, by definition, beyond the 
reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of 
human rights are indivisible and interdependent. It would also drastically curtail the capacity of the 
courts to protect the rights of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society.”
The General Comment also emphasizes the importance of courts applying the principles of the 
Covenant either directly or as interpretive standards.

be built into the process of government at all 
levels but also independent monitoring by 
national human rights institutions, NGOs and 
others.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, 
para. 27)
A “comprehensive national 
strategy” for children
The Committee, often quoting the principle of 
“first call for children”, promoted at the World 
Summit for Children, has emphasized that chil-
dren must be accorded a high, or higher, prior-
ity. In stressing the need for a comprehensive 
approach to the implementation of children’s 
rights, the Committee has frequently promoted 
the need for a national policy or comprehensive 
national strategy reflecting the implementation of 
the whole Convention. 
It gives more detailed advice about the develop-
ment and contents of such a strategy in General 
Comment No. 5:
“The Committee commends the development 
of a comprehensive national strategy or 
national plan of action for children, built 
on the framework of the Convention. The 
Committee expects States Parties to take 
account of the recommendations in its 
Concluding Observations on their periodic 
reports when developing and/or reviewing 
their national strategies. If such a strategy 
is to be effective, it needs to relate to the 
situation of all children, and to all the rights in 
the Convention. It will need to be developed 
through a process of consultation, including 
with children and young people and those 
living and working with them… Meaningful 
consultation with children requires special 
child-sensitive materials and processes; it is not 
simply about extending to children access to 
adult processes.
“Particular attention will need to be given to 
identifying and giving priority to marginalized 
and disadvantaged groups of children. The 
non-discrimination principle in the Convention 
requires that all the rights guaranteed by 
the Convention should be recognized for all 
children within the jurisdiction of States… The 
non-discrimination principle does not prevent 
the taking of special measures to diminish 
discrimination.
“To give the strategy authority, it will 
need to be endorsed at the highest level of 
government. Also, it needs to be linked to 
national development planning and included 
in national budgeting; otherwise, the strategy 
may remain marginalized outside key decision-
making processes.
“The strategy must not be simply a list of good 
intentions; it must include a description of 
a sustainable process for realizing the rights 
of children throughout the State; it must go 
beyond statements of policy and principle, 
to set real and achievable targets in relation 
to the full range of economic, social and 
cultural and civil and political rights for all 
children. The comprehensive national strategy 
may be elaborated in sectoral national plans 
of action – for example for education and 
health – setting out specific goals, targeted 
implementation measures and allocation of 
financial and human resources. The strategy 
will inevitably set priorities, but it must not 
neglect or dilute in any way the detailed 
obligations which States Parties have accepted 
under the Convention. The strategy needs 
to be adequately resourced, in human and 
financial terms.
“Developing a national strategy is not a 
one-off task. Once drafted the strategy will 
need to be widely disseminated throughout 
Government and to the public, including 
children (translated into child-friendly versions 
as well as into appropriate languages and 
forms). The strategy will need to include 
arrangements for monitoring and continuous 
review, for regular updating and for periodic 
reports to parliament and to the public.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 29 
to 33)
Various global meetings, including the World 
Summit 
for 
Children 
(1990), 
the 
World 
Conference on Human Rights (1993) and the 
United Nations General Assembly’s special ses-
sion on children (2002), have called for the 
development of national plans of action. The 
Committee welcomes commitments made by 
States to achieve the goals and targets set at the 
2002 special session on children and identified in 
its outcome document, A World Fit for Children: 
“But the Committee emphasizes that making 
particular commitments at global meetings 
does not in any way reduce States Parties’ legal 
obligations under the Convention. Similarly, 
preparing specific plans of action in response 
to the special session does not reduce the need 
for a comprehensive implementation strategy 
for the Convention. States should integrate 
their response to the 2002 special session 
and to other relevant global conferences into 
their overall implementation strategy for the 
Convention as a whole.
“The outcome document also encourages 
States Parties to ‘consider including in their 
reports to the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child information on measures taken and 
results achieved in the implementation of 
the present Plan of Action’. The Committee 
endorses this proposal; it is committed to 
monitoring progress towards meeting the 
commitments made at the special session and 
will provide further guidance in its revised 
guidelines for periodic reporting under the

Convention.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 35 and 36)
Thus, when it examined Italy’s Second Report, it 
proposed that the State should expedite adoption 
of the National Plan of Action and 
“Ensure harmonization between the 
National Plan of Action and the plan for the 
implementation of the UNGASS outcome 
document.” (Italy CRC/C/15/Add.198, para. 13)
Similarly, the Committee told India to 
“… take all necessary measures to adopt, 
in consultation with all relevant partners, 
including the civil society, a new Plan of 
Action for Children that covers all areas of 
the Convention, includes the Millennium 
Development Goals, and fully reflects ‘A world 
fit for children’…” (India CRC/C/15/Add.228, 
para. 16)
Coordinating implementation: 
need for permanent government 
mechanisms
The Committee has made clear that it sees the 
process of implementation as a continuing pro-
cess requiring “permanent” mechanisms in gov-
ernment. Coordination is the key aim, as well as 
increasing visibility of children in government. 
Again, the Committee emphasizes that it is not 
advisable for it to attempt to prescribe detailed 
arrangements appropriate for very different sys-
tems of government across States Parties: 
“There are many formal and informal 
ways of achieving effective coordination, 
including for example inter-ministerial and 
interdepartmental committees for children. 
The Committee proposes that States Parties, 
if they have not already done so, should 
review the machinery of government from 
the perspective of implementation of the 
Convention and in particular of the four 
articles identified as providing general 
principles…
“Many States Parties have with advantage 
developed a specific department or unit close 
to the heart of Government, in some cases in 
the President’s or Prime Minister’s or Cabinet 
office, with the objective of coordinating 
implementation and children’s policy. As noted 
above, the actions of virtually all government 
departments impact on children’s lives. It is 
not practicable to bring responsibility for 
all children’s services together into a single 
department, and in any case doing so could 
have the danger of further marginalizing 
children in Government. But a special unit, 
if given high-level authority - reporting 
directly, for example, to the Prime Minister, 
the President or a Cabinet Committee on 
children – can contribute both to the overall 
purpose of making children more visible in 
Government and to coordination to ensure 
respect for children’s rights across Government 
and at all levels of Government. Such a unit 
can be given responsibility for developing 
the comprehensive children’s strategy and 
monitoring its implementation, as well as for 
coordinating reporting under the Convention.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 39)
One of the most common “subjects of concern” 
expressed by the Committee in its Concluding 
Observations on States Parties’ reports has been 
a lack of coordination, and it has made frequent 
recommendations for “effective coordination”. 
One product of coordination across government 
is the comprehensive national strategy or plan of 
action for children. This then in turn becomes the 
framework for coordinated action for the realiza-
tion of children’s rights, as for example, in the 
Committee’s recommendations to Mauritius: 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party strengthen coordination between the 
various governmental mechanisms involved 
in children’s rights, at both the national and 
local levels, with a view to developing a 
comprehensive policy on children and ensuring 
effective evaluation of the implementation of 
the Convention in the country.” (Mauritius 
CRC/C/15/Add.64, para. 23)
When it examined the Second Report from 
Mauritius in 2006, the Committee commented:
“While noting the role of the Ministry 
of Women’s Rights, Child Development, 
Family Welfare and Consumer Protection, 
the Committee is concerned about the fact 
that coordination between the different 
government departments and institutions 
dealing with children’s rights is insufficient. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party further strengthen the coordination 
between the various bodies and institutions 
at all levels and pay particular attention to the 
various regions of the State Party.” (Mauritius, 
CRC/C/MUS/CO/2, paras. 12 and 13)
The Committee has referred to lack of coordina-
tion between government departments and min-
istries and other governmental bodies, between 
federal or central government and provincial, 
regional or local government, between govern-
ment and public and private bodies, including 
non-governmental organizations dealing with 
human rights and children’s rights, and between 
such bodies themselves. 
Decentralization and federalization
The Committee has criticized over-centraliza-
tion of decision-making and policy implemen-
tation, but also drawn attention to the threat

l
e

60
decentralization can pose to the realization of 
the rights of the child:
“While welcoming the decentralization process 
undertaken by the State Party, the Committee 
is concerned that it could have a negative 
impact on the protection of human rights and 
child rights.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party work to ensure that the provincial law 
and practices are in conformity with the 
Convention.” (Indonesia CRC/C/15/Add.223, 
paras. 16 and 17)
“In view of the current trend towards 
decentralization in the State Party, 
the Committee is concerned about the 
sustainability of the funding for the provision 
of health, education and social services for 
children. It is also concerned by the absence 
of a regulating and monitoring mechanism to 
ensure appropriate distribution of resources to 
children by local authorities.” (Hungary 
CRC/C/15/Add.87, para. 10)
It reiterated these concerns when it exam-
ined Hungary’s Second Report in 2006, com-
menting that the Child Protection Act of 1997 
placed responsibilities on the counties and local 
authorities, without providing them with suffi-
cient means to establish effective services. The 
Committee recommended that the obligations 
placed on counties and local authorities should be 
reassessed and they should be supported with suf-
ficient human and financial resources to establish 
an effective child protection system and adequate 
child welfare services (Hungary CRC/C/HUN/
CO/2, paras. 7 and 8).
In its General Comment No. 5, the Committee 
emphasizes that devolution does not reduce the 
State’s obligations: 
“The Committee has found it necessary to 
emphasize to many States that decentralization 
of power, through devolution and delegation 
of government, does not in any way reduce 
the direct responsibility of the State Party’s 
Government to fulfil its obligations to all 
children within its jurisdiction, regardless of 
the State’s structure.
“The Committee reiterates that in all 
circumstances the State which ratified or 
acceded to the Convention remains responsible 
for ensuring the full implementation of the 
Convention throughout the territories under 
its jurisdiction. In any process of devolution, 
States Parties have to make sure that the 
devolved authorities do have the necessary 
financial, human and other resources 
effectively to discharge responsibilities for 
the implementation of the Convention. The 
Governments of States Parties must retain 
powers to require full compliance with the 
Convention by devolved administrations or 
local authorities and must establish permanent 
monitoring mechanisms to ensure that the 
Convention is respected and applied for 
all children within its jurisdiction without 
discrimination. Further, there must be 
safeguards to ensure that decentralization or 
devolution does not lead to discrimination in 
the enjoyment of rights by children in different 
regions.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, 
paras. 40 and 41)
So the Committee told Canada, following exami-
nation of its Second Report:
“The Committee notes that the application 
of a considerable part of the Convention falls 
within the competence of the provinces and 
territories, and is concerned that this may lead, 
in some instances, to situations where the 
minimum standards of the Convention are not 
applied to all children owing to differences at 
the provincial and territorial level.
“The Committee urges the Federal 
Government to ensure that the provinces and 
territories are aware of their obligations under 
the Convention and that the rights in the 
Convention have to be implemented in all the 
provinces and territories through legislation 
and policy and other appropriate measures.” 
(Canada CRC/C/15/Add.215, paras. 8 and 9)
Privatization
The Committee notes in its General Comment that 
the process of privatization of services can have 
a serious impact on the recognition and realiza-
tion of children’s rights. The Committee devoted 
its 2002 Day of General Discussion to the theme 
“The private sector as service provider and its role 
in implementing child rights”, defining the pri-
vate sector as including businesses, NGOs and 
other private associations, both for profit and not-
for-profit (Report on the twenty-ninth session, 
January/February 2002, CRC/C/114, pp. 187 et 
seq.). Following that Day of General Discussion, 
the Committee adopted detailed recommendations 
which it refers to in General Comment No. 5:
“The Committee emphasizes that States Parties 
to the Convention have a legal obligation to 
respect and ensure the rights of children as 
stipulated in the Convention, which includes 
the obligation to ensure that non-state service 
providers operate in accordance with its 
provisions, thus creating indirect obligations 
on such actors.
“The Committee emphasizes that enabling 
the private sector to provide services, run 
institutions and so on does not in any way 
lessen the State’s obligation to ensure for 
all children within its jurisdiction the full 
recognition and realization of all rights in the 
Convention (arts. 2(1) and 3(2)). Article 3(1) 
establishes that the best interests of the child 
shall be a primary consideration in all actions

concerning children, whether undertaken by 
public or private bodies. Article 3(3) requires 
the establishment of appropriate standards 
by competent bodies (bodies with the 
appropriate legal competence), in particular, 
in the areas of health, and with regard to the 
number and suitability of staff. This requires 
rigorous inspection to ensure compliance with 
the Convention. The Committee proposes 
that there should be a permanent monitoring 
mechanism or process aimed at ensuring 
that all State and non-State service providers 
respect the Convention.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 
2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 42 to 44. See also 
article 3(2), page 40 and article 3(3), page 41.)
When it examined Lebanon’s Third Report, the 
Committee expressed appreciation at the State’s 
close collaboration with non-governmental orga-
nizations and the active role of civil society in the 
implementation of the rights of the child and in 
the provision of education, health and social ser-
vices. But it continued:
“As regards the process of privatizing or 
contracting out services to non-governmental 
organizations, the Committee notes with 
concern the weak accountability and 
transparency of this process, as well as the lack 
of critical information provided by external 
monitoring and assessment mechanisms.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take into account the recommendations 
adopted on its Day of General Discussion on the 
Private Sector as Service Provider and its Role in 
Implementing Child Rights (CRC/C/121) and:
(a) Continue to strengthen its cooperation 
with non-governmental organizations, and 
involve them systematically at all stages in the 
implementation of the Convention, as well as 
in policy formulation;
(b) Provide non-governmental organizations 
with adequate financial and other resources 
when they are involved in discharging 
governmental responsibilities and duties
with regard to the implementation of the 
Convention;
(c) Ensure, for example, by providing 
guidelines and standards for service provision 
that non-governmental organizations, both 
for-profit as well as not-for-profit, fully comply 
with the principles and provisions of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child; and
(d) When privatizing or contracting out 
services to non-governmental
organizations, enter into detailed agreements 
with the service providers, ensure effective 
monitoring of implementation as well as 
transparency of the entire process.” (Lebanon 
CRC/C/LBN/CO/3, paras. 21 and 22)
Child impact analysis
The Committee has looked for processes which 
ensure that children’s best interests are a primary 
consideration in all actions concerning children 
(see article 3, page 38). In General Comment No. 5,
it sets out the implications: 
“Ensuring that the best interests of the child 
are a primary consideration in all actions 
concerning children (art. 3(1)), and that all the 
provisions of the Convention are respected 
in legislation and policy development and 
delivery at all levels of government demands a 
continuous process of child impact assessment 
(predicting the impact of any proposed law, 
policy or budgetary allocation which affects 
children and the enjoyment of their rights) and 
child impact evaluation (evaluating the actual 
impact of implementation). This process needs 
to be built into government at all levels and as 
early as possible in the development of policy.
“Self-monitoring and evaluation is an 
obligation for Governments. But the 
Committee also regards as essential the 
independent monitoring of progress 
towards implementation by, for example, 
parliamentary committees, NGOs, academic 
institutions, professional associations, youth 
groups and independent human rights 
institutions…
“The Committee commends certain States 
which have adopted legislation requiring the 
preparation and presentation to parliament 
and/or the public of formal impact analysis 
statements. Every State should consider how it 
can ensure compliance with article 3(1) and do 
so in a way which further promotes the visible 
integration of children in policy-making and 
sensitivity to their rights.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 
2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 45 to 47)
Budgeting and budgetary analysis
The Committee has emphasized that States’ obli-
gation to implement economic, social and cultural 
rights “to the maximum extent of their available 
resources” implies adequate budgetary analysis. 
It is extremely rare for children to be as visible 
in the economic policies of government as the 
Committee implies they should be. Most govern-
ment departments have no idea what proportion 
of their budget is spent on children, few know 
what impact their expenditure has on children. 
The Committee has emphasized that monitoring 
and evaluation in this sphere, as in all others, is 
essential for effective implementation strategies, 
as General Comment No. 5 sets out:
“In its reporting guidelines and in the 
consideration of States Parties’ reports, the 
Committee has paid much attention to the 
identification and analysis of resources for 
children in national and other budgets. No 
State can tell whether it is fulfilling children’s 
economic, social and cultural rights ‘to the 
maximum extent of … available resources’, 
as it is required to do under article 4, unless 
–> Table of Contents

a
r
t
i
c
l
e

62
it can identify the proportion of national and 
other budgets allocated to the social sector 
and, within that, to children, both directly 
and indirectly. Some States have claimed it is 
not possible to analyse national budgets in 
this way. But others have done it and publish 
annual ‘children’s budgets’. The Committee 
needs to know what steps are taken at all 
levels of Government to ensure that economic 
and social planning and decision-making and 
budgetary decisions are made with the best 
interests of children as a primary consideration 
and that children, including in particular 
marginalized and disadvantaged groups of 
children, are protected from the adverse 
effects of economic policies or financial 
downturns.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 51)
The Committee has made various consistent 
comments on budgetary issues in its examina-
tion of States Parties’ reports, almost invariably 
seeking more analysis and information. The over-
all proportion of national and local budgets allo-
cated to social programmes must be adequate, 
and there must be sufficient budgetary provision 
to protect and promote children’s rights. Lack of 
available resources cannot be used as a reason for 
not establishing social security programmes and 
social safety nets. For example:
“The Committee is concerned about the very 
limited information on budget allocations 
for the implementation of the CRC. These 
allocations seem to be insufficient to respond 
to national and local priorities for the 
protection and promotion of children’s rights.
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party pay particular attention to 
the full implementation of article 4 of the 
Convention by increasing and prioritizing 
budgetary allocations to ensure at all levels 
the implementation of the rights of the child 
and that particular attention is paid to the 
protection of the rights of children belonging 
to vulnerable groups including children with 
disabilities, children affected or/and infected 
by HIV/AIDS, street children and children 
living in poverty. It further recommends that 
the State Party provide specific and detailed 
information on the allocations of these 
budgets at the national and district level.” 
(Ghana CRC/C/GHA/CO/2, paras. 17 and 18)
“The Committee regrets the lack of clear 
information on budget allocations and is 
concerned that one of the major causes of 
poverty in Colombia is the unequal distribution 
of state funds, which severely impacts on the 
well-being of children, in particular affecting 
those from more vulnerable sectors of society. 
In particular, the Committee is deeply concerned 
over the declining expenditure for education, 
health and welfare services, all essential to the 
realization of the right of the child.
“The Committee strongly recommends that the 
State Party, in accordance with article 4 of the 
Convention, increase budget allocations for 
the implementation of the rights recognized 
in the Convention, ensure a more balanced 
distribution of resources throughout the 
country and prioritize budgetary allocations 
to ensure implementation of the economic, 
social and cultural rights of all children, 
including those belonging to financially 
disadvantaged groups, such as Afro-Colombian 
and indigenous children.” (Colombia CRC/C/COL/
CO/3, paras. 20 and 21)
“The Committee expresses its concern 
that budgetary allocations for children, in 
particular in the fields of health and education, 
are insufficient and that often the resources 
allocated do not correspond to the needs. It 
further notes that the decentralization process 
started in 1999 is held back by limited financial 
and human resources.
“In light of article 4 of the Convention, the 
Committee encourages the State Party:
(a) To enforce effectively the Preliminary 
Poverty Reduction Strategy;
(b) To identify clearly its priorities with 
respect to child rights issues in order to 
ensure that funds are allocated ‘to the 
maximum extent of … available resources’. 
The Committee fully supports the State Party 
in seeking international cooperation for the 
full implementation of the economic, social 
and cultural rights of children, in particular 
children belonging to the most vulnerable 
groups in society; 
(c) To identify the amount and proportion of 
the budget spent on children at the national 
and local levels in order to evaluate the impact 
of expenditures on children.” (Moldova 
CRC/C/15/Add.192, paras. 14 and 15)
National bodies concerned with overall budget-
ing should be linked directly to those develop-
ing policy for children and implementation of the 
Convention:
“… the Committee suggests that the ministries 
responsible for overall planning and budgeting 
be fully involved in the activities of the Higher 
Committee on Child Welfare and the National 
Committee on Children, with a view to 
ensuring that their decisions have a direct and 
immediate impact on the budget.” (Syrian Arab 
Republic CRC/C/15/Add.70, para. 26)
The Committee has expressed concern at the 
impact of tax evasion and corruption on avail-
able resources. Examining the Third Report of 
the Russian Federation, the Committee expressed 
serious concern 
“… that widespread corruption, inter alia, in 
the health and education sectors as well as in 
–> Table of Contents

adoption procedures, is affecting children in 
full enjoyment of their rights.”
It went on to recommend: 
“The State Party should seriously address 
and take all necessary measures to prevent 
corruption.” (Russian Federation CRC/C/RUS/CO/3, 
paras. 19 and 20)
“Concern is also expressed at the widespread 
practices of tax evasion and corruption which 
are believed to have an effect on the level of 
resources available for the implementation of 
the Convention.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party undertake all appropriate measures 
to improve its system of tax collection and 
reinforce its efforts to eradicate corruption.” 
(Georgia CRC/C/15/Add.124, paras. 18 and 19)
Effects of transition to market 
economy and other forced economic 
adjustments
The Committee has been highly sensitive to 
the impact on children of the world recession, 
economic adjustments and cutbacks that have 
occurred during the 1990s. It endorsed the fol-
lowing recommendation during its 1999 two-day 
tenth anniversary workshop:
“The Committee calls attention to the fact that 
economic policies are never child-rights neutral. 
The Committee calls on civil society to assist 
it in seeking the support of key international 
leaders, and in particular the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, the Executive Director of 
UNICEF, and the President of the World Bank, to 
examine how macro-economic and fiscal policies 
impact on children’s rights, and how these 
policies can be reformed so as to make them 
more beneficial to the implementation of the 
rights of the child.” (Report on the twenty-second 
session, September/October 1999, CRC/C/90, 
para. 291 (m))
The Committee has expressed consistent concern 
at the effects of transition to a market economy 
on children and echoes this in General Comment 
No. 5 :
“Emphasizing that economic policies are never 
neutral in their effect on children’s rights, the 
Committee has been deeply concerned by the 
often negative effects on children of structural 
adjustment programmes and transition to 
a market economy. The implementation 
duties of article 4 and other provisions of the 
Convention demand rigorous monitoring of 
the effects of such changes and adjustment of 
policies to protect children’s economic, social 
and cultural rights.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 52)
States must minimize the negative effects of 
structural adjustment programmes, and any 
spending cuts on children; and the needs of the 
most vulnerable groups of children must be given 
priority. For example:
“The Committee urges the Government 
of Peru to take all the necessary steps to 
minimize the negative impact of the structural 
adjustment policies on the situation of 
children. The authorities should, in the light of 
articles 3 and 4 of the Convention, undertake 
all appropriate measures to the maximum 
extent of their available resources to ensure 
that sufficient resources are allocated to 
children...” (Peru CRC/C/15/Add.8, para. 19)
“... Budgetary allocations for the 
implementation of economic, social and 
cultural rights should be ensured during the 
period of transition to market economy to the 
maximum extent of available resources and 
in the light of the best interests of the child.” 
(Ukraine CRC/C/15/Add.42, para. 20)
The Committee returned to these issues in detail 
when it examined Ukraine’s Second Report:
“The Committee notes the priority accorded 
by the State Party to health and education 
and the information that the budget has 
been increased for 2000-2001. However, the 
Committee remains concerned about the low 
level of resources in general for social services, 
health and education, which has a negative 
impact on the quality and accessibility of 
services, especially affecting families with 
children living in poverty. The Committee is 
also concerned that the ‘Children of Ukraine’ 
programme is not accorded adequate 
funding. The Committee is further concerned 
that readjustment programmes may have a 
disproportionately negative effect on children 
if not appropriately addressed in the planning 
and budgeting of social services.
“In light of articles 2, 3 and 6 of the 
Convention, the Committee recommends 
that the State Party pay particular attention 
to the full implementation of article 4 of the 
Convention by:
(a) Further continuing to increase the budget 
for the implementation of the Convention 
and prioritizing budgetary allocations to 
ensure implementation of economic, social 
and cultural rights of children to the maximum 
extent of available resources, in particular 
to socially marginalized groups, taking into 
account the decentralization of the provision 
of social services and of public finances;
(b) Strengthening its efforts to implement the 
poverty reduction strategy (2001);
(c) Ensuring sufficient resources for the full 
implementation of state programmes and 
policies for children, including ‘Children of 
Ukraine’;
(d) Identifying the amount and proportion of 
the State’s budget spent on children through 
public and private institutions or organizations

in order to evaluate the impact of the 
expenditures and also, in view of the costs, the 
accessibility, the quality and the effectiveness 
of the services for children in the different 
sectors.” (Ukraine CRC/C/15/Add.191, paras. 17 
and 18)
Economic sanctions and respect for 
economic, social and cultural rights
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights issued a General Comment in 1997 on the 
relationship between economic sanctions and 
respect for economic, social and cultural rights. 
The Committee notes that economic sanctions 
“almost always have a dramatic impact on the 
rights recognized in the Covenant [International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights]. Thus, for example, they often cause sig-
nificant disruption in the distribution of food, 
pharmaceuticals and sanitation supplies, jeop-
ardize the quality of food and the availability of 
clean drinking water, severely interfere with the 
functioning of basic health and education sys-
tems, and undermine the right to work...”. 
The General Comment emphasizes the impor-
tance of reducing to a minimum the negative 
impact of sanctions on vulnerable groups within 
the society – including children: “In adopting this 
General Comment the sole aim of the Committee 
is to draw attention to the fact that the inhabit-
ants of a given country do not forfeit their basic 
economic, social and cultural rights by virtue of 
any determination that their leaders have violated 
norms relating to international peace and secu-
rity. The aim is not to give support or encour-
agement to such leaders, nor is it to undermine 
the legitimate interests of the international com-
munity in enforcing respect for the provisions of 
the Charter of the United Nations and the gen-
eral principles of international law. Rather, it is to 
insist that lawlessness of one kind should not be 
met by lawlessness of another kind which pays no 
heed to the fundamental rights that underlie and 
give legitimacy to any such collective action.” 
(Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, General Comment No. 8, 1997, HRI/
GEN/1/Rev.8, pp. 51 to 55)
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
drawn attention to this General Comment in its 
Concluding Observations on certain States which 
have experienced sanctions.
Monitoring and data collection
The Committee has frequently noted that with-
out sufficient data collection, including disaggre-
gated data, it is impossible to assess the extent to 
which the Convention has been implemented. In 
General Comment No. 5, the Committee empha-
sizes that “self-monitoring and evaluation is an 
obligation for governments”. But the Committee 
also regards independent monitoring of progress 
towards implementation as essential, including by, 
for example, parliamentary committees, NGOs, 
academic institutions, professional associations, 
youth groups and independent human rights insti-
tutions. General Comment No. 5 states:
“Collection of sufficient and reliable data 
on children, disaggregated to enable 
identification of discrimination and/or 
disparities in the realization of rights, is 
an essential part of implementation. The 
Committee reminds States Parties that data 
collection needs to extend over the whole 
period of childhood, up to the age of 18 years. 
It also needs to be coordinated throughout 
the jurisdiction, ensuring nationally applicable 
indicators. States should collaborate with 
appropriate research institutes and aim to 
build up a complete picture of progress 
towards implementation, with qualitative as 
well as quantitative studies. The reporting 
guidelines for periodic reports call for detailed 
disaggregated statistical and other information 
covering all areas of the Convention. It is 
essential not merely to establish effective 
systems for data collection, but to ensure 
that the data collected are evaluated and 
used to assess progress in implementation, 
to identify problems and to inform all policy 
development for children. Evaluation requires 
the development of indicators related to all 
rights guaranteed by the Convention.
“The Committee commends States Parties 
which have introduced annual publication 
of comprehensive reports on the state of 
children’s rights throughout their jurisdiction. 
Publication and wide dissemination of 
and debate on such reports, including in 
parliament, can provide a focus for broad 
public engagement in implementation. 
Translations, including child-friendly versions, 
are essential for engaging children and 
minority groups in the process.
“The Committee emphasizes that, in many 
cases, only children themselves are in a 
position to indicate whether their rights 
are being fully recognized and realized. 
Interviewing children and using children as 
researchers (with appropriate safeguards) is 
likely to be an important way of finding out, 
for example, to what extent their civil rights, 
including the crucial right set out in article 
12, to have their views heard and given due 
consideration, are respected within the family, 
in schools and so on.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 48 to 50)
In its Guidelines for Periodic Reports (Revised 
2005) the Committee asks for detailed statistical 
and other information under most articles (see 
Appendix 3, page 701, Annex).

The Committee sets out the independent monitor-
ing role of national human rights institutions in 
its General Comment No. 2 (2002) on ”The role 
of independent national human rights institutions 
in the protection and promotion of the rights of 
the child”:
“The role of national human rights 
institutions is to monitor independently the 
State’s compliance and progress towards 
implementation and to do all it can to ensure 
full respect for children’s rights. While this 
may require the institution to develop projects 
to enhance the promotion and protection 
of children’s rights, it should not lead to 
the Government delegating its monitoring 
obligations to the national institution. It is 
essential that institutions remain entirely free 
to set their own agenda and determine their 
own activities.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, General Comment No. 2, 2002, 
CRC/GC/2002/2, para. 25) 
General Comment No. 2 provides detailed guid-
ance on the establishment and operation of inde-
pendent human rights institutions for children 
– see below, page 68. (For full text see www.
ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/comments.htm.)
Participation of civil society
The Committee has stressed that, while imple-
mentation is an obligation for States Parties, coor-
dination and action to implement the Convention 
should extend beyond government to all segments 
of society. General Comment No. 5 expands on 
this:
“Implementation is an obligation for States 
Parties, but needs to engage all sectors of 
society, including children themselves. The 
Committee recognizes that responsibilities 
to respect and ensure the rights of children 
extend in practice beyond the State and 
State-controlled services and institutions to 
include children, parents and wider families, 
other adults, and non-State services and 
organizations…
“Article 12 of the Convention, as already 
emphasized …, requires due weight to 
be given to children’s views in all matters 
affecting them, which plainly includes 
implementation of ‘their’ Convention. 
“The State needs to work closely with NGOs 
in the widest sense, while respecting their 
autonomy; these include, for example, 
human rights NGOs, child- and youth-led 
organizations and youth groups, parent 
and family groups, faith groups, academic 
institutions and professional associations. 
NGOs played a crucial part in the drafting of 
the Convention and their involvement in the 
process of implementation is vital. 
“The Committee welcomes the development 
of NGO coalitions and alliances committed 
to promoting, protecting and monitoring 
children’s human rights and urges 
Governments to give them non-directive 
support and to develop positive formal as 
well as informal relationships with them. 
The engagement of NGOs in the reporting 
process under the Convention, coming within 
the definition of ‘competent bodies’ under 
article 45(a), has in many cases given a real 
impetus to the process of implementation 
as well as reporting. The NGO Group for the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child has a 
very welcome, strong and supportive impact 
on the reporting process and other aspects 
of the Committee’s work. The Committee 
underlines in its reporting guidelines that 
the process of preparing a report ‘should 
encourage and facilitate popular participation 
and public scrutiny of government policies’. 
The media can be valuable partners in the 
process of implementation.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 56 to 59)
In examining States’ reports, the Committee often 
calls for a systematic approach to involvement of 
NGOs, and often highlights the need to engage 
with children’s organizations. For example:
“Despite the existence of a vibrant civil 
society, the Committee is concerned that 
non-governmental organizations are not 
fully involved in the Government’s efforts to 
implement the Convention.
“The Committee emphasizes the important 
role civil society plays as a partner in 
implementing the provisions of the 
Convention, and recommends that the State 
Party involve non-governmental organizations 
in a more systematic and coordinated manner 
throughout all stages of the implementation of 
the Convention, including policy formulation, 
at the national and local levels.” (Poland 
CRC/C/15/Add.194, paras. 21 and 22)
“The Committee notes the information 
on good government cooperation with 
national associations in the development and 
welfare sectors, as well as with international 
organizations. However, it is concerned that 
little effort has been made to actively involve 
civil society, particularly in the area of civil 
rights and freedoms, in the implementation of 
the Convention.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party:
(a) Adopt a systematic approach to involving 
civil society, including children’s associations, 
throughout all stages in the implementation of 
the Convention, including with respect to civil 
rights and freedoms;
(b) Ensure that legislation regulating NGOs 
(e.g., the Private Associations and Institutions 
Act No. 93 of 1958) conforms to article 15 
of the Convention and other international

standards on freedom of association, as a 
step in facilitating and strengthening their 
participation.” (Syrian Arab Republic CRC/C/15/
Add.Add.212, paras. 19 and 20) 
Awareness-raising and training
The Committee has linked the obligation under 
article 42, to make the provisions and principles 
of the Convention widely known to adults and 
children alike, to article 4, as a general measure of 
implementation. In the overall process of aware-
ness-raising, the Committee has emphasized the 
importance of incorporating the Convention in 
the school curriculum as well as in training for 
those working with and for children (General 
Comment No. 5 includes discussion of article 42; 
see page 627).
Independent human rights 
institutions for children
The Committee believes that every State needs an 
independent human rights institution with respon-
sibility for promoting and protecting children’s 
rights. In its General Comment No. 2 on “The 
role of independent national human rights insti-
tutions in the promotion and protection of chil-
dren’s rights” (CRC/GC/2002/2), the Committee 
notes that its principal concern is that the institu-
tion, whatever its form, should be able, indepen-
dently and effectively, to monitor, promote and 
protect children’s rights. When it examines States’ 
reports, the Committee consistently recommends 
the establishment of independent human rights 
institutions – a children’s ombudsman, commis-
sion or commissioner, or a focal point on children’s 
rights developed within a national human rights 
commission or general ombudsman institution. 
So, for example, the Committee told Azerbaijan:
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party, taking into account the Committee’s 
general comment No. 2 on the role of 
independent national human rights institutions 
in the promotion and protection of the rights 
of the child (CRC/GC/2002/2), include within the 
Office of the Ombudsman either an identifiable 
commissioner specifically responsible for 
children’s rights or a specific section or division 
responsible for children’s rights. Furthermore, it 
should be provided with adequate human and 
financial resources, deal with complaints from 
children in a child-sensitive and expeditious 
manner and provide remedies for violations of 
their rights under the Convention.” (Azerbaijan 
CRC/C/AZE/CO/2, para. 15)
Where such institutions have already been estab-
lished, the Committee calls upon States to review 
their status and effectiveness for promoting and 
protecting children’s rights. So when it examined 
Sweden’s Third Report, the Committee com-
mented:
“The Committee welcomes the enactment 
of the 2002 Bill reinforcing the role of the 
Children’s Ombudsman and notes with 
appreciation the many activities undertaken 
by the Children’s Ombudsman for the 
implementation of children’s rights. It is, 
however, the view of the Committee that 
further improvements can be accomplished.
The Committee recommends that:
(a) The State Party consider providing the 
Children’s Ombudsman with the mandate to 
investigate individual complaints;
(b) The annual report of the Children’s 
Ombudsman be presented to the Parliament, 
together with information about measures 
the Government intends to take to implement 
the recommendations of the Children’s 
Ombudsman.” (Sweden CRC/C/15/Add. 248, 
paras. 6 and 7) 
The Committee explains that while adults and 
children alike need independent national human 
rights institutions (NHRIs) to protect their 
human rights, additional justifications exist for 
ensuring that child’s human rights are given spe-
cial attention:
“These include the facts that children’s 
developmental state makes them particularly 
vulnerable to human rights violations; their 
opinions are still rarely taken into account; 
most children have no vote and cannot play 
a meaningful role in the political process 
that determines Governments’ response to 
human rights; children encounter significant 
problems in using the judicial system to 
protect their rights or to seek remedies for 
violations of their rights; and children’s access 
to organizations that may protect their rights 
is generally limited.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, General Comment No. 2, 2002, 
CRC/GC/2002/2, para. 5)
The Committee notes that specialist independent 
human rights institutions for children, ombud-
spersons or commissioners for children’s rights, 
have been established in a growing number of 
States Parties. Where resources are limited, con-
sideration must be given to ensuring that the 
available resources are used most effectively 
for the promotion and protection of everyone’s 
human rights, including children’s, and in this 
context development of a broad-based NHRI that 
includes a specific focus on children is likely 
to constitute the best approach. A broad-based 
NHRI should include within its structure either 
an identifiable commissioner specifically respon-
sible for children’s rights, or a specific section or 
division responsible for children’s rights. The 
Committee underlines that it is essential that 
promotion and protection of children’s rights 
is “mainstreamed” and that all human rights

e
institutions existing in a country work closely 
together to this end (CRC/GC/2002/2, para. 6).
The General Comment emphasizes that NHRIs 
should be established in compliance with the 
Principles relating to the status of national insti-
tutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (The Paris Principles), adopted by 
the General Assembly in 1993. These minimum 
standards provide guidance for the establish-
ment, competence, responsibilities, composition, 
independence, methods of operation, and quasi-
judicial activities of such national bodies 
(CRC/GC/2002/2, para. 4. For full text of Paris 
Principles, see A/RES/48/134.)
They should, if possible, be constitutionally 
entrenched and must at least be established in 
legislation:
“It is the view of the Committee that their 
mandate should include as broad a scope as 
possible for promoting and protecting human 
rights, incorporating the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, its Optional Protocols 
and other relevant international human 
rights instruments – thus effectively covering 
children’s human rights, in particular their civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights… 
“NHRIs should be accorded such powers as 
are necessary to enable them to discharge 
their mandate effectively, including the 
power to hear any person and obtain any 
information and document necessary for 
assessing the situations falling within their 
competence. These powers should include 
the promotion and protection of the rights 
of all children under the jurisdiction of the 
State Party in relation not only to the State 
but to all relevant public and private entities.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 2, 2002, CRC/GC/2002/2, paras. 8 
and 9)
NHRIs must also have the right
“… to report directly, independently and 
separately on the state of children’s rights to 
the public and to parliamentary bodies. In 
this respect, States Parties must ensure that 
an annual debate is held in Parliament to 
provide parliamentarians with an opportunity 
to discuss the work of the NHRI in respect of 
children’s rights and the State’s compliance 
with the Convention.” (CRC/GC/2002/2, para. 18)
NHRIs should be established through a consult-
ative, inclusive and transparent process. They 
should have appropriate and transparent appoint-
ment procedures, including an open and competi-
tive selection process (CRC/GC/2002/2, para. 12). 
In order to secure their independence, they must 
have adequate resources and funding and free-
dom from forms of financial control that might 
affect their independence (CRC/GC/2002/2, 
para. 10). They must have the power to consider 
individual complaints and petitions and to carry 
out investigations, including those submitted on 
behalf of or directly by children:
“In order to be able to effectively carry out 
such investigations, they must have the powers 
to compel and question witnesses, access 
relevant documentary evidence and access 
places of detention. They also have a duty to 
seek to ensure that children have effective 
remedies – independent advice, advocacy and 
complaints procedures – for any breaches of 
their rights. Where appropriate, NHRIs should 
undertake mediation and conciliation of 
complaints.
“NHRIs should have the power to support 
children taking cases to court, including the 
power (a) to take cases concerning children’s 
issues in the name of the NHRI and (b) to 
intervene in court cases to inform the court 
about the human rights issues involved in the 
case.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 2, 2002, CRC/GC/2002/2, 
paras. 13 and 14)
The Committee highlights the importance of 
institutions establishing and maintaining direct 
contact with children:
“NHRIs should be geographically and 
physically accessible to all children. In the 
spirit of article 2 of the Convention, they 
should proactively reach out to all groups of 
children, in particular the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged, such as (but not limited to) 
children in care or detention, children from 
minority and indigenous groups, children 
with disabilities, children living in poverty, 
refugee and migrant children, street children 
and children with special needs in areas such 
as culture, language, health and education. 
NHRI legislation should include the right of 
the institution to have access in conditions of 
privacy to children in all forms of alternative 
care and to all institutions that include 
children. 
“NHRIs have a key role to play in promoting 
respect for the views of children in all matters 
affecting them, as articulated in article 12 
of the Convention, by Government and 
throughout society. This general principle 
should be applied to the establishment, 
organization and activities of national human 
rights institutions. Institutions must ensure 
that they have direct contact with children and 
that children are appropriately involved and 
consulted. Children’s councils, for example, 
could be created as advisory bodies for NHRIs 
to facilitate the participation of children in 
matters of concern to them. 
“NHRIs should devise specially tailored 
consultation programmes and imaginative 
communication strategies to ensure full

compliance with article 12 of the Convention. 
A range of suitable ways in which children can 
communicate with the institution should be 
established.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, General Comment No. 2, 2002, 
CRC/GC/2002/2, paras. 15 to 17)
The General Comment emphasizes that NHRIs 
should contribute independently of government to 
the reporting process under the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (paras. 20 to 24; see article 44, 
page 643). It sets out a non-exhaustive list of pro-
posed activities for these institutions (see box).
Recommended activities for independent 
human rights institutions for children
The following is an indicative, but not exhaustive, list of the types of activities which NHRIs should 
carry out in relation to the implementation of children’s rights in light of the general principles of 
the Convention. They should:
(a) Undertake investigations into any situation of violation of children’s rights, on complaint or on 
their own initiative, within the scope of their mandate;
(b) Conduct inquiries on matters relating to children’s rights;
(c) Prepare and publicize opinions, recommendations and reports, either at the request of national 
authorities or on their own initiative, on any matter relating to the promotion and protection of 
children’s rights;
(d) Keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice relating to the protec-
tion of children’s rights;
(e) Promote harmonization of national legislation, regulations and practices with the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, its Optional Protocols and other international human rights instru-
ments relevant to children’s rights and promote their effective implementation, including 
through the provision of advice to public and private bodies in construing and applying the 
Convention;
(f) Ensure that national economic policy makers take children’s rights into account in setting and 
evaluating national economic and development plans;
(g) Review and report on the Government’s implementation and monitoring of the state of chil-
dren’s rights, seeking to ensure that statistics are appropriately disaggregated and other 
information collected on a regular basis in order to determine what must be done to realize 
children’s rights;
(h) Encourage ratification of or accession to any relevant international human rights instruments;
(i) In accordance with article 3 of the Convention requiring that the best interests of children should 
be a primary consideration in all actions concerning them, ensure that the impact of laws and 
policies on children is carefully considered from development to implementation and beyond;
(j) In light of article 12, ensure that the views of children are expressed and heard on matters con-
cerning their human rights and in defining issues relating to their rights;
(k) Advocate for and facilitate meaningful participation by children’s rights NGOs, including 
organizations comprised of children themselves, in the development of domestic legislation 
and international instruments on issues affecting children;
(l) Promote public understanding and awareness of the importance of children’s rights and, for 
this purpose, work closely with the media and undertake or sponsor research and educational 
activities in the field;
(m) In accordance with article 42 of the Convention which obligates States Parties to “make the 
principles and provisions of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to 
adults and children alike”, sensitize the Government, public agencies and the general public to 
the provisions of the Convention and monitor ways in which the State is meeting its obligations 
in this regard;

(n) Assist in the formulation of programmes for the teaching of, research into and integration of 
children’s rights in the curricula of schools and universities and in professional circles;

moting general public understanding about the importance of children’s rights);
(p) Take legal proceedings to vindicate children’s rights in the State or provide legal assistance to 
children;
(q) Engage in mediation or conciliation processes before taking cases to court, where appropriate;

the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall 
conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of 
safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision”, 
undertake visits to juvenile homes (and all places where children are detained for reform or 
punishment) and care institutions to report on the situation and to make recommendations for 
improvement;
(t) Undertake such other activities as are incidental to the above.

International cooperation for 
implementation
In its comments on general measures of imple-
mentation, the Committee has urged many 
countries to seek and use international coopera-
tion and technical assistance. It has also encour-
aged donor countries to ensure that their aid 
programmes follow the lines of the Convention 
and establish a clear priority for children. Its 
Guidelines for Periodic Reports (Revised 2005) 
asks for information from donor States on human 
and financial resources allocated to programmes 
for children, in particular within bilateral assis-
tance programmes; States receiving international 
assistance or development aid should provide 
information on the total resources received and 
the percentage allocated to programmes for chil-
dren (CRC/C/58/Rev.1, para. 12).
General Comment No. 5 states:
“Article 4 emphasizes that implementation 
of the Convention is a cooperative exercise 
for the States of the world. This article and 
others in the Convention highlight the need 
for international cooperation. The Charter of 
the United Nations (arts. 55 and 56) identifies 
the overall purposes of international economic 
and social cooperation, and members pledge 
themselves under the Charter ‘to take joint 
and separate action in cooperation with the 
Organization’ to achieve these purposes. In the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration and at 
other global meetings, including the United 
Nations General Assembly special session on 
children, States have pledged themselves, in 
particular, to international cooperation to 
eliminate poverty. 
“The Committee advises States Parties that 
the Convention should form the framework 
for international development assistance 
related directly or indirectly to children and 
that programmes of donor States should be 
rights-based. The Committee urges States to 
meet internationally agreed targets, including 
the United Nations target for international 
development assistance of 0.7 per cent 
of gross domestic product. This goal was 
reiterated along with other targets in the 
Monterrey Consensus, arising from the 2002 
International Conference on Financing for 
Development. The Committee encourages 
States Parties that receive international aid 
and assistance to allocate a substantive part of 
that aid specifically to children. The Committee 
expects States Parties to be able to identify 
on a yearly basis the amount and proportion 
of international support earmarked for the 
implementation of children’s rights. 
“The Committee endorses the aims of the 
20/20 initiative, to achieve universal access 
to basic social services of good quality on a 
sustainable basis, as a shared responsibility of 
developing and donor States. The Committee 
notes that international meetings held to 
review progress have concluded that many 
States are going to have difficulty meeting

Mobilizing resources – extract from A World Fit for Children
“The primary responsibility for the implementation of the Plan of Action and for ensuring an 
enabling environment for securing the well-being of children, in which the rights of each and every 
child are promoted and respected, rests with each individual country, recognizing that new and 
additional resources, both national and international, are required for this purpose.
“Investments in children are extraordinarily productive if they are sustained over the medium to 
long term. Investing in children and respecting their rights lays the foundation for a just society, a 
strong economy, and a world free of poverty.
“Implementation of the present Plan of Action will require the allocation of significant additional 
human, financial, and material resources, nationally and internationally, within the framework of 
an enabling international environment and enhanced international cooperation, including North-
South and South-South cooperation, to contribute to economic and social development. 
“Accordingly, we resolve to pursue, among others, the following global targets and actions for 
mobilizing resources for children: 
(a) Express our appreciation to the developed countries that have agreed to and have reached the 
target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) for overall official development 
assistance (ODA) and urge the developed countries that have not done so to strive to meet the 
yet to be attained internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for 
overall ODA as soon as possible. We take upon ourselves not to spare any efforts to reverse the 
declining trends of ODA and to meet expeditiously the targets of 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent 
of GNP as ODA to least developed countries, as agreed, taking into account the urgency and 
gravity of the special needs of children;
(b) Without further delay, implement the enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative 
(HIPC) and agree to cancel all bilateral official debts of heavily indebted poor countries as 
soon as possible, in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty eradication, 
and urge the use of debt service savings to finance poverty eradication programmes, in partic-
ular those related to children;
(c) Call for speedy and concerted action to address effectively the debt problems of least devel-
oped countries, low-income developing countries and middle-income developing countries in a 
comprehensive, equitable, development-oriented and durable way through various national and 
international measures designed to make their debt sustainable in the long term and thereby to 
improve their capacity to deal with issues relating to children, including, as appropriate, exist-
ing orderly mechanisms for debt reduction such as debt swaps for projects aimed at meeting 
the needs of children;
(d) Increase and improve access of products and services of developing countries to international 
markets through, inter alia, the negotiated reduction of tariff barriers and the elimination of 
non-tariff barriers, which unjustifiably hinder trade of developing countries, according to the 
multilateral trading system;
(e) Believing that increased trade is essential for the growth and development of the least devel-
oped countries, aim at improving preferential market access for those countries by working 
towards the objective of duty-free and quota-free market access for all products of the least 
developed countries in the markets of developed countries;
(f) Mobilize new and substantial additional resources for social development, both at national and 
international level, to reduce disparities within and among countries, and ensure the effec-
tive and efficient use of existing resources. Further, ensure to the greatest possible extent, that 
social expenditures that benefit children are protected and prioritized during both short-term 
and long-term economic and financial crises;
(g) Explore new ways of generating public and private financial resources, inter alia, through 
the reduction of excessive military expenditures and the arms trade and investment in arms 
production and acquisition, including global military expenditures, taking into consideration 
national security requirements;

fundamental economic and social rights 
unless additional resources are allocated and 
efficiency in resource allocation is increased. 
The Committee takes note of and encourages 
efforts being made to reduce poverty in the 
most heavily indebted countries through the 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). As 
the central, country-led strategy for achieving 
the millennium development goals, PRSPs must 
include a strong focus on children’s rights. 
The Committee urges Governments, donors 
and civil society to ensure that children are a 
prominent priority in the development of PRSPs 
and sectorwide approaches to development 
(SWAps). Both PRSPs and SWAps should reflect 
children’s rights principles, with a holistic, 
child-centred approach recognizing children 
as holders of rights and the incorporation of 
development goals and objectives which are 
relevant to children.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 60 to 62)
The Committee encourages States to provide 
and to use, as appropriate, technical assistance, 
from among others UNICEF, the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
and other United Nations and United Nations-
related agencies. States Parties are encouraged 
to identify their interest in technical assistance 
in their reports under the Convention. All United 
Nations and United Nations-related organizations 
involved in promoting international cooperation 
and technical assistance should be guided by the 
Convention and should mainstream children’s 
rights throughout their activities: 
“They should seek to ensure within their 
influence that international cooperation is 
targeted at supporting States to fulfil their 
obligations under the Convention. Similarly 
the World Bank Group, the International 
Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization 
should ensure that their activities related 
to international cooperation and economic 
development give primary consideration to 
the best interests of children and promote 
full implementation of the Convention.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 5, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/5, paras. 60 
to 64)
The Committee urges States to meet United 
Nations targets for international assistance. For 
example:
“The Committee notes the approval of 
the Programme of Action 2015 for Poverty 
Reduction and the many other activities in 
the area of international cooperation and 
assistance, but remains concerned that the 
State Party devotes only about 0.27 per cent 
of its gross national income to the official 
development assistance, and that the foreseen 
increase to 0.33 per cent in 2006 is very slow.
“In light of its previous recommendations 
(para. 25), the Committee encourages the 
State Party to implement the United Nations 
target of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross 
domestic product to overseas development 
assistance as soon as possible…” (Germany 
CRC/C/15/Add.226, paras. 21 and 22)
(h) Encourage donor and recipient countries, based on mutual agreement and commitment, to 
fully implement the 20/20 Initiative, in line with the Oslo and Hanoi Consensus documents, 
to ensure universal access to basic social services.”

In no sense is the Convention “anti-family”, nor 
does it pit children against their parents. On the 
contrary, the Preamble upholds the family as “the 
fundamental group of society and the natural 
environment for the growth and well-being of all 
its members and particularly children”. Several 
articles emphasize the primary responsibility of 
parents and place strict limits on state interven-
tion and any separation of children from their 
parents (articles 3(2), 7, 9, 10, 18, 27); one of the 
aims for education is the development of respect 
for the child’s parents (article 29).” 
■
rticle 5, together with article 18 in par-
ticular, provides a framework for the 
relationship between the child, his or 
her parents and family, and the State. 
The article provides the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child with a flexible definition of “family” 
and introduces to the Convention two vital con-
cepts: parental “responsibilities” and the “evolv-
ing capacities” of the child. The article also 
signals clearly that the Convention regards the 
child as the active subject of rights, emphasiz-
ing the exercise “by the child” of his or her rights. 
The Committee has expanded on its interpreta-
tion of the article in General Comments.
Text of Article 5
States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applic-
able, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal 
guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent 
with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise 
by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention.

States Parties “... shall respect
the responsibilities, rights
and duties...”
Article 5 introduces to the Convention the con-
cept of parents’ and others’ “responsibilities” for 
their children, linking them to parental rights and 
duties, which are needed to fulfil responsibili-
ties. Article 18 expands on the concept of parental 
responsibilities (see page 231). In it, States Parties 
are required to “use their best endeavours” to 
ensure recognition of the principle that both par-
ents have common responsibilities for the upbring-
ing and development of the child: “Parents or, as 
the case may be, legal guardians, have the primary 
responsibility for the upbringing and development 
of the child. The best interests of the child will be 
their basic concern.” Parental responsibilities are 
also mentioned in article 27(2) (see page 395). 
Beyond this, the Convention does not specifically 
define “parental responsibilities”. But as is the 
case with the definition of the best interests of the 
child, the content of the whole Convention is rel-
evant. Parents have responsibilities, in the terms 
of article 5, to appropriately support “the exercise 
by the child of the rights recognized in the pres-
ent Convention”. The Convention challenges con-
cepts that parents have absolute rights over their 
children, which the Committee has noted are tra-
ditional in many societies but already changing 
to some degree in most. The rights and the duties 
that parents have derive from their responsibility 
to act in the best interests of the child. The impli-
cation is that the concept of parental responsibil-
ities should be reflected and defined in the law, 
using the framework of the Convention. 
“... of parents or, where 
applicable, the members of the 
extended family or community 
as provided for by local 
custom, legal guardians or 
other persons legally responsible 
for the child, ...”
The broad definition of family in the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child reflects the wide vari-
ety of kinship and community arrangements 
within which children are brought up around the 
world. The importance of the family is empha-
sized in the Preamble to the Convention: “... the 
family, as the fundamental group of society and 
the natural environment for the growth and well-
being of all its members and particularly children, 
should be afforded the necessary protection and 
assistance so that it can fully assume its responsi-
bilities within the community”, and “... the child, 
for the full and harmonious development of his 
or her personality, should grow up in a family 
environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love 
and understanding”.
Article 5 acknowledges the extended family,
referring not only to parents and others legally 
responsible but also to the extended family 
or community where they are recognized by 
local custom. In its General Comment No. 7 on 
“Implementing child rights in early childhood”, 
the Committee comments:
“Under normal circumstances, a young child’s 
parents play a crucial role in the achievement 
of their rights, along with other members 
of family, extended family or community, 
including legal guardians, as appropriate. 
This is fully recognized within the Convention 
(especially article 5)… The Committee 
recognizes that ‘family’ … refers to a variety 
of arrangements that can provide for young 
children’s care, nurturance and development, 
including the nuclear family, the extended 
family, and other traditional and modern 
community-based arrangements, provided 
these are consistent with children’s rights and 
best interests.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 7, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/
Rev.1, para. 15)
The Committee also recognizes that social trends 
have led to a range of family patterns:
“… The Committee notes that in practice 
family patterns are variable and changing in 
many regions, as is the availability of informal 
networks of support for parents, with an 
overall trend towards greater diversity in 
family size, parental roles and arrangements 
for bringing up children. These trends are 
especially significant for young children, 
whose physical, personal and psychological 
development is best provided for within 
a small number of consistent, caring 
relationships. Typically, these relationships 
are with some combination of mother, father, 
siblings, grandparents and other members of 
the extended family, along with professional 
caregivers specialized in childcare and 
education. The Committee acknowledges 
that each of these relationships can make 
a distinctive contribution to the fulfilment 
of children’s rights under the Convention 
and that a range of family patterns may be 
consistent with promoting children’s well-
being…” (CRC/C/GC/7, para. 19)
The International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights upholds, in article 23, the family as “the 
natural and fundamental group unit of society... 
entitled to protection by society and the State” 
and sets out, in article 24, the child’s right to “such 
measures of protection as are required by his sta-
tus as a minor, on the part of his family, society

and the State”. In two General Comments in 1989 
and 1990, the Human Rights Committee empha-
sizes the flexible definition of the family, which “is 
interpreted broadly to include all persons compos-
ing it in the society of the State Party concerned” 
(Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 
17, 1989, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 6, p. 184).
And in General Comment No. 19 of the Human 
Rights Committee: “The Committee notes that 
the concept of the family may differ in some 
respects from State to State, and even from region 
to region within a State, and that it is therefore 
not possible to give the concept a standard defi-
nition. However, the Committee emphasizes that, 
when a group of persons is regarded as a fam-
ily under the legislation and practice of a State, 
it must be given the protection referred to in art-
icle 23. Consequently, States Parties should report 
on how the concept and the scope of the family 
is construed or defined in their own society and 
legal system. Where diverse concepts of the fam-
ily, ‘nuclear’ and ‘extended’, exist within a State, 
this should be indicated with an explanation of 
the degree of protection afforded to each. In view 
of the existence of various forms of family, such 
as unmarried couples and their children or single 
parents and their children, States Parties should 
also indicate whether and to what extent such 
types of family and their members are recognized 
and protected by domestic law and practice.” 
(Human Rights Committee, General Comment 
No. 19, 1990, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 2, p. 188)
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
noted increases in numbers of child-headed and 
grandparent-headed households or families. It has 
suggested that polygamy should be investigated 
for any negative impact on children (see article 
18, page 232). A General Recommendation of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women in 1994 proposes “prohibi-
tion of bigamy and polygamy and the protec-
tion of the rights of children” (Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 
General Recommendation No. 21, 1994, HRI/
GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 39, p. 315).
“... to provide, in a manner 
consistent with the evolving 
capacities of the child, appro-
priate direction and guidance 
in the exercise by the child of 
the rights recognized in the 
present Convention”
Using the concept of “evolving capacities” has 
avoided the need for the Convention to set arbi-
trary age limits or definitions of maturity tied to 
particular issues. This is one of the Convention’s 
key concepts – an acknowledgement that children’s 
development towards independent adulthood must 
be respected and promoted throughout childhood. 
It is linked to the requirement of article 12 that the 
views of children should be given “due weight in 
accordance with the age and maturity of the child”. 
The concept is repeated in article 14: parents 
and legal guardians may provide direction to the 
child, in relation to the child’s right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion, in a manner con-
sistent with his or her evolving capacities. 
The wording emphasizes the child as the subject 
of the rights recognized in the Convention, refer-
ring to the exercise “by the child” of these rights. 
The role of parents in relation to the capacities and 
rights of babies and younger children is explained 
in the Committee’s General Comment No. 7 on 
“Implementing child rights in early childhood”:
“The responsibility vested in parents and 
other primary caregivers is linked to the 
requirement that they act in children’s best 
interests. Article 5 states that parents’ role is 
to offer appropriate direction and guidance 
in ‘the exercise by the child of the rights in 
the … Convention’. This applies equally to 
younger as to older children. Babies and 
infants are entirely dependent on others, 
but they are not passive recipients of care, 
direction and guidance. They are active social 
agents, who seek protection, nurturance 
and understanding from parents or other 
caregivers, which they require for their 
survival, growth and well-being. Newborn 
babies are able to recognize their parents 
(or other caregivers) very soon after birth, 
and they engage actively in non-verbal 
communication. Under normal circumstances, 
young children form strong mutual 
attachments with their parents or primary 
caregivers. These relationships offer children 
physical and emotional security, as well as 
consistent care and attention. Through these 
relationships children construct a personal 
identity and acquire culturally valued skills, 
knowledge and behaviours. In these ways, 
parents (and other caregivers) are normally the 
major conduit through which young children 
are able to realize their rights.” (Committee on 
the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 7, 
2005, CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 16)
In the General Comment, the Committee refers 
to the concept of “evolving capacities” as an 
“enabling principle”:
“Article 5 draws on the concept of ‘evolving 
capacities’ to refer to processes of maturation 
and learning whereby children progressively 
acquire knowledge, competencies and 
understanding, including acquiring 
understanding about their rights and about

how they can best be realized. Respecting 
young children’s evolving capacities is crucial 
for the realization of their rights and especially 
significant during early childhood, because 
of the rapid transformations in children’s 
physical, cognitive, social and emotional 
functioning, from earliest infancy to the 
beginnings of schooling. Article 5 contains the 
principle that parents (and others) have the 
responsibility to continually adjust the levels 
of support and guidance they offer to a child. 
These adjustments take account of a child’s 
interests and wishes as well as the child’s 
capacities for autonomous decision-making 
and comprehension of his or her best interests. 
While a young child generally requires more 
guidance than an older child, it is important 
to take account of individual variations in 
the capacities of children of the same age 
and of their ways of reacting to situations. 
Evolving capacities should be seen as a positive 
and enabling process, not an excuse for 
authoritarian practices that restrict children’s 
autonomy and self-expression and which 
have traditionally been justified by pointing 
to children’s relative immaturity and their 
need for socialization. Parents (and others) 
should be encouraged to offer ‘direction and 
guidance’ in a child-centred way, through 
dialogue and example, in ways that enhance 
young children’s capacities to exercise their 
rights, including their right to participation 
(art. 12) and their right to freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion (art. 14).” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 7, 
2005, CRC/C/GC/7Rev.1, para. 17)
The Committee also addresses the concept of 
evolving capacities and the issue of appropriate 
guidance in the exercise of rights by older children 
in its General Comment No. 4 on “Adolescent 
health and development in the context of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child”:
“The Convention on the Rights of the Child 
defines a child as ‘every human being below 
the age of 18 years unless, under the law 
applicable, majority is attained earlier’ (art. 1). 
Consequently, adolescents up to 18 years 
old are holders of all the rights enshrined in 
the Convention; they are entitled to special 
protection measures and, according to their 
evolving capacities, they can progressively 
exercise their rights (art. 5)…
“The Committee believes that parents or other 
persons legally responsible for the child need 
to fulfil with care their right and responsibility 
to provide direction and guidance to their 
adolescent children in the exercise by the 
latter of their rights. They have an obligation 
to take into account the adolescents’ views, in 
accordance with their age and maturity, and to 
provide a safe and supportive environment in 
which the adolescent can develop. Adolescents 
need to be recognized by the members of their 
family environment as active rights holders 
who have the capacity to become full and 
responsible citizens, given the proper guidance 
and direction.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 4, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/4, paras. 1 and 7)
When it ratified the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the Holy See made a reservation 
“... That it interprets the articles of the Convention 
in a way which safeguards the primary and 
inalienable rights of parents, in particular in so 
far as these rights concern education (arts. 13 and 
28), religion (art. 14), association with others (art. 
15) and privacy (art. 16)” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 23). 
In its Concluding Observations, the Committee 
expressed concern about the reservation,
“... in particular with respect to the full 
recognition of the child as a subject of rights”. 
The Committee went on to recommend
“... that the position of the Holy See with 
regard to the relationship between articles 5 
and 12 of the Convention be clarified. In this 
respect, it wishes to recall its view that the 
rights and prerogatives of the parents may not 
undermine the rights of the child as recognized 
by the Convention, especially the right of the 
child to express his or her own views and that 
his or her views be given due weight.” (Holy 
See CRC/C/15/Add.46, paras. 7 and 13)
Some other reservations and declarations have 
underlined parental authority. For example, the 
Republic of Kiribati stated that it “considers that a 
child’s rights as defined in the Convention, in par-
ticular the rights defined in articles 12 to 16, shall 
be exercised with respect for parental authority, in 
accordance with the I-Kiribati customs and tradi-
tions regarding the place of the child within and 
outside the family”. Similarly, a declaration from 
Poland stated that such rights “shall be exercised 
with respect for parental authority, in accordance 
with Polish customs and traditions regarding the 
place of the child within and outside the family” 
(CRC/C/2/Rev.8, pp. 27 and 35). 
The Committee has frequently expressed con-
cern where countries do not appear to have fully 
accepted the concept of the child as an active sub-
ject of rights, relating this to article 5 and also to 
articles 12 to 16. 
The Committee has consistently stressed this 
concept during its examination of States Parties’ 
reports. And it has strongly emphasized that 
upholding the rights of the child within the fam-
ily is not exercised at the expense of others’ 
rights, in particular those of parents, but, on 
the contrary, strengthens the rights of the entire 
family. Thus, a Committee member said during

discussions with Burkina Faso: “... it was impor-
tant, in striving to implement the Convention’s 
provisions, to promote the true spirit of that 
instrument to the effect that it was not a ques-
tion of seeking ‘child power’ but of showing that 
upholding the rights of the child strengthened the 
rights of the entire family, and that, with regard 
to parenthood, the emphasis should not be on 
authority but on responsibility.” Another mem-
ber agreed that “it was wrong to interpret the 
assertion of children’s rights as in conflict with 
those of parents; the rights of the child and of 
the family went hand in hand” (Burkina Faso 
CRC/C/SR.136, paras. 51 and 53).
On the same subject, the Manual on Human 
Rights Reporting, 1997, states: “With the 
Convention, children’s rights are given auton-
omy – not with the intention of affirming them in 
opposition to the rights of adults or as an alterna-
tive to the rights of parents, but in order to bring 
into the scene a new dimension: the consideration 
of the perspective of the child within the frame-
work of the essential value of the family. The 
child is therefore recognized in his or her funda-
mental dignity and individuality, with the right to 
be different and diverge in his or her assessment 
of reality.” (Manual, p. 445)
The Committee sees the family as crucial to the 
realization of the child’s civil rights. In the out-
line for its Day of General Discussion on “The 
role of the family in the promotion of the rights of 
the child”, it stated:
“The civil rights of the child begin within the 
family... The family is an essential agent for 
creating awareness and preservation of human 
rights, and respect for human values, cultural 
identity and heritage, and other civilizations. 
There is a need to consider appropriate 
ways of ensuring balance between parental 
authority and the realization of the rights of 
the child, including the right to freedom of 
expression.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, Report on the fifth session, January 1994, 
CRC/C/24, Annex V, p. 63)
At the end of the General Discussion, the 
Committee reached some preliminary conclu-
sions:
“Traditionally, the child has been seen as 
a dependent, invisible and passive family 
member. Only recently has he or she become 
‘seen’ and, furthermore, the movement is 
growing to give him or her the space to be 
heard and respected. Dialogue, negotiation, 
participation have come to the forefront of 
common action for children.
“The family becomes in turn the ideal 
framework for the first stage of the 
democratic experience for each and all of its 
individual members, including children. Is this 
only a dream or should it also be envisaged as 
a precise and challenging task?”
The Committee affirmed that the Convention is
“... the most appropriate framework in which 
to consider, and to ensure respect for, the 
fundamental rights of all family members, 
in their individuality. Children’s rights will 
gain autonomy, but they will be especially 
meaningful in the context of the rights of 
parents and other members of the family to be 
recognized, to be respected, to be promoted. 
And this will be the only way to promote the 
status of, and respect for, the family itself.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the seventh session, September/October 1994, 
CRC/C/34, paras. 183 et seq.)
Article 5 makes clear that the nature of parental 
direction and guidance is not unlimited; it must 
be “appropriate”, be consistent with the “evolv-
ing capacities of the child” and with the remain-
der of the Convention. Article 18 emphasizes that 
the child’s best interests will be the parents’ “basic 
concern”. Several States Parties made reservations 
upholding parental authority (see above, page 78); 
and others, in their Initial Reports, have referred 
to the “traditional” authority of parents. 
In its Initial Report, the United Kingdom suggests 
that article 19 of the Convention has to be read 
in conjunction with article 5 and that “appropri-
ate direction and guidance” of the child “include 
the administration, by the parent, of reasonable 
and moderate physical chastisement to a child” 
(United Kingdom CRC/C/11/Add.1, para. 335). 
In discussion with United Kingdom Government 
representatives, a Committee member stated: “... 
there was no place for corporal punishment within 
the margin of discretion accorded in article 5 to 
parents in the exercise of their responsibilities. 
Other countries had found it helpful to incorpo-
rate a provision to that effect in their civil law...” 
(United Kingdom CRC/C/SR.205, para. 72)
Similarly, a Committee member noted dur-
ing discussion of Senegal’s Initial Report: “The 
Committee recognized the existence of tradi-
tional attitudes and practices, but firmly believed 
that those that went against the interests of the 
child should be abolished. The belief that to spare 
the rod was to spoil the child was one such atti-
tude: it was preferable to provide guidance than 
to inflict corporal punishment.” (Senegal CRC/C/
SR.248, para. 73)
Thus, when reading article 5 in conjunction with 
article 19, the Committee is clear that paren-
tal “guidance” must not take the form of violent 
or humiliating discipline, as the child must be 
protected from “all forms of physical or mental

violence” while in the care of parents and 
others. The Committee reiterates this in its General 
Comment No. 8 on “The right of the child to pro-
tection from corporal punishment and other cruel 
or degrading forms of punishment (articles 19, 28(2) 
and 37, inter alia)” (see also article 19, page 262):
“Article 5 requires States to respect the 
responsibilities, rights and duties of parents 
‘to provide, in a manner consistent with the 
evolving capacities of the child, appropriate 
direction and guidance in the exercise by the 
child of the rights recognized in the present 
Convention‘. Here again, interpretation of 
‘appropriate‘ direction and guidance must be 
consistent with the whole Convention and 
leaves no room for justification of violent or 
other cruel or degrading forms of discipline.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 8, 2006, CRC/C/GC/8, para. 28)
The focus of article 5 on “evolving capacities” 
is not only about children’s growing autonomy 
in relation to parents. It also relates to the child’s 
process of development (articles 6, 27 and 29) and 
parents’ responsibility not to demand or expect 
from the child anything that is inappropriate to 
the child’s developmental state. Article 5 is about 
the child’s path to maturity, which must come 
from increasing exercise of autonomy. In many 
countries, children acquire certain rights of self-
determination well before the age of majority; they 
often gain full adult rights on marriage, which in 
some States is permitted at the age of 14 or 15 (the 
Committee strongly criticizes this, see article 1, 
page 8). In a few countries the concept of “evolv-
ing capacities” is reflected by a general provision 
in legislation that once children acquire sufficient 
maturity or understanding, they may make deci-
sions for themselves when there is no specific lim-
itation on doing so set down in the law.
The Committee has underlined that there must 
be no discrimination – for example on grounds 
of gender – in recognition of maturity in States’ 
legislation (see article 1, page 8). 
Preparation for parenthood
As indicated above, the Committee has noted 
that the traditional view of the child as a “depen-
dent, invisible and passive” member of the fam-
ily persists in some States. The Committee has 
highlighted the need to prepare parents for their 
responsibilities. In its General Comment No. 7 on 
“Implementing child rights in early childhood”, 
the Committee expands on the need for compre-
hensive policies and programmes to support par-
ents (see in particular CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, paras. 
20 to 24, and for further discussion, see article 
18, page 231).
The Committee’s decision to issue this General 
Comment reflects a growing recognition of the 
importance of early child development within 
the family for the prevention of violence and 
other forms of crime, both in childhood and later 
life. This recognition provides further motiva-
tion for developing comprehensive support and 
education programmes for parenting and prepa-
ration for parenthood. For example, the United 
Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile 
Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines) proposes: 
“Measures should be taken and programmes 
developed to provide families with the opportu-
nity to learn about parental roles and obligations 
as regards child development and child care, pro-
moting positive parent-child relationships, sen-
sitizing parents to the problems of children and 
young persons and encouraging their involve-
ment in family and community-based activities” 
(para. 16).

Reminder: The Convention is indivisible and its articles interdependent. Article 5 
should not be considered in isolation. Its flexible definition of the family is relevant to 
interpretation of other articles. The article asserts the child as an active subject of rights 
with evolving capacities, relevant to implementation of all other rights, including in 
particular the child’s civil and political rights. 
Particular regard should be paid to:
The general principles
Article 2: all rights to be recognized for each child in the jurisdiction without discrimination on 
any ground 
Article 3(1): the best interests of the child to be a primary consideration in all actions concerning 
children
Article 6: right to life and maximum possible survival and development
Article 12: respect for the child’s views in all matters affecting the child; opportunity to be heard 
in any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting the child 
Closely related articles
Articles whose implementation is related to that of article 5 include:
Article 1: definition of the child in legislation and practice must take account of the child’s 
“evolving capacities”
Article 18: parental responsibilities and state support for parenting

opment as an holistic concept, and many articles 
of the Convention specifically refer to the goal of 
development. Other articles emphasize the key role 
of parents and the family for child development and 
the State’s obligation to support them. Protection 
from violence and exploitation is also vital to max-
imum survival and development. As with the other 
articles identified as including general principles 
(articles 2, 3, and 12), the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child has proposed that article 6 should be 
reflected in domestic legislation. 
■
rticle 6 is one of the articles designated 
by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child as a general principle, guaran-
teeing the child the fundamental right 
to life, upheld as a universal human rights prin-
ciple in other instruments, and to survival and 
development to the maximum extent possible.
The concept of “survival and development” to 
the maximum extent possible is crucial to the 
implementation of the whole Convention. The 
Committee on the Rights of the Child sees devel-

The inherent right to life 
of the child
The right to life is upheld as a universal human 
rights principle in article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights: “Everyone has 
the right to life, liberty and security of person”. 
Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights upholds the same principle: 
“Every human being has the inherent right to life. 
This right shall be protected by law. No one shall 
be arbitrarily deprived of his life” (paragraph 1). 
The other paragraphs of the article in the Covenant 
place limitations on the use of the death penalty 
in those countries that have not abolished it (see 
below, page 88). The Human Rights Committee, 
in a General Comment in 1982 on the right to life 
notes that the right has too often been narrowly 
interpreted: “The expression ‘inherent right to life’ 
cannot properly be understood in a restrictive man-
ner, and the protection of this right requires that 
States adopt positive measures. In this connection, 
the Committee considers that it would be desirable 
for States Parties to take all possible measures to 
reduce infant mortality and to increase life expec-
tancy, especially in adopting measures to elimi-
nate malnutrition and epidemics.” (Human Rights 
Committee, General Comment No. 6, 1982, HRI/
GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 5, p. 167)
According to the Manual on Human Rights 
Reporting, 1997, measures taken by States to 
implement article 6 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child may be “of a positive nature 
and thus designed to protect life, including by 
increasing life expectancy, diminishing infant and 
child mortality, combating diseases and rehabili-
tating health, providing adequate nutritious foods 
and clean drinking water. And they may further 
aim at preventing deprivation of life, namely by 
prohibiting and preventing death penalty, extra-
legal, arbitrary or summary executions or any sit-
uation of enforced disappearance. States Parties 
should therefore refrain from any action that may 
intentionally take life away, as well as take steps 
to safeguard life.” (Manual, p. 424)
Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child expands on the child’s right to health and 
health services, and specifically requires “appro-
priate measures ... to diminish infant and child 
mortality” (article 24(2)(a), see page 355). The 
Committee has commended States for reducing 
mortality rates and has expressed concern when-
ever rates have risen and at situations in which 
rates vary in a discriminatory way (for further 
discussion, see article 24, page 356).
In its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing 
child rights in early childhood”, the Committee 
highlights these issues:
“Article 6 refers to the child’s inherent 
right to life and States Parties’ obligation 
to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, 
the survival and development of the child. 
States Parties are urged to take all possible 
measures to improve perinatal care for 
mothers and babies, reduce infant and child 
mortality, and create conditions that promote 
the well-being of all young children during 
this critical phase of their lives. Malnutrition 
and preventable diseases continue to be 
major obstacles to realizing rights in early 
childhood. Ensuring survival and physical 
health are priorities, but States Parties are 
reminded that article 6 encompasses all 
aspects of development, and that a young 
child’s health and psychosocial well-being are 
in many respects interdependent. Both may 
be put at risk by adverse living conditions, 
neglect, insensitive or abusive treatment 
and restricted opportunities for realizing 
human potential. Young children growing up 
in especially difficult circumstances require 
particular attention... The Committee reminds 
States Parties (and others concerned) that 
the right to survival and development can 
only be implemented in a holistic manner, 
through the enforcement of all the other 
provisions of the Convention, including rights 
to health, adequate nutrition, social security, 
an adequate standard of living, a healthy and 
safe environment, education and play (arts. 24, 
27, 28, 29 and 31), as well as through respect 
for the responsibilities of parents and the 
provision of assistance and quality services 
(arts. 5 and 18). From an early age, children 
should themselves be included in activities 
promoting good nutrition and a healthy and 
disease-preventing lifestyle.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 7, 2005, 
CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 10)
The particular threat to children’s right to life and 
development posed by HIV/AIDS is addressed 
in the Committee’s General Comment on 
“HIV/AIDS and the rights of the child”:
“Children have the right not to have their lives 
arbitrarily taken, as well as to benefit from 
economic and social policies that will allow 
them to survive into adulthood and develop 
in the broadest sense of the word. State 
obligation to realize the right to life, survival 
and development also highlights the need to 
give careful attention to sexuality as well as 
to the behaviours and lifestyles of children, 
even if they do not conform with what society 
determines to be acceptable under prevailing 
cultural norms for a particular age group. In 
this regard, the female child is often subject 
to harmful traditional practices, such as 
early and/or forced marriage, which violate 
her rights and make her more vulnerable 
to HIV infection, including because such 
practices often interrupt access to education

and information. Effective prevention 
programmes are only those that acknowledge 
the realities of the lives of adolescents, while 
addressing sexuality by ensuring equal access 
to appropriate information, life skills, and to 
preventive measures.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, General Comment No. 3, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/3, para. 11)
The child’s right to life: 
abortion and euthanasia 
As noted under article 1 (page 2), the Preamble to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child recalls 
the provision in the United Nations Declaration of 
the Rights of the Child that “the child, by reason 
of his physical and mental immaturity, needs spe-
cial safeguards and care, including appropriate 
legal protection, before as well as after birth.” The 
Working Group drafting the Convention agreed 
that a statement should be placed in the travaux 
préparatoires to the effect that “In adopting this 
preambular paragraph, the Working Group does 
not intend to prejudice the interpretation of art-
icle 1 or any other provision of the Convention 
by States Parties” (E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 8 to 15; 
Detrick, p. 110). 
Article 1 deliberately leaves open the starting 
point of childhood, that is, whether it is concep-
tion, birth or sometime in between. Thus, the 
Convention leaves individual States to decide for 
themselves the conflicting rights and interests 
involved in issues such as abortion and family 
planning, and the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child has therefore suggested that reservations to 
preserve state laws on abortion are unnecessary 
(for details of reservations and discussion, see 
article 1, page 2).
The Committee has commented adversely on 
high rates of abortion, on the use of abortion as a 
method of family planning and on selective abor-
tions by gender, and it has encouraged measures 
to reduce the incidence of abortion.
The Committee has also expressed concern at 
“clandestine” abortions and the negative effects 
of teenage pregnancies, including on the right 
to life of young mothers, and at infanticide; see 
below, page 87.
It has questioned, from the perspective of chil-
dren’s best interests, the illegality of abortions 
even in cases of rape or incest:
“... The Committee notes that abortion is illegal 
except on medical grounds and expresses 
concern regarding the best interests of child 
victims of rape and/or incest in this regard… 
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party review its legislation concerning 
abortion, with a view to guaranteeing the best 
interests of child victims of rape and incest.…” 
(Palau CRC/C/15/Add.149, paras. 46 and 47) 
The 
Committee 
on 
the 
Elimination 
of 
Discrimination against Women, in a General 
Recommendation on women and health, states 
“… When possible, legislation criminalizing 
abortion should be amended, in order to with-
draw punitive measures imposed on women 
who undergo abortion.” (Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 
General Recommendation No. 24, 1999, HRI/
GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 31(c), p. 336)
Contentious ethical issues arise in relation to 
the right to life, which the Committee has not as 
yet tackled comprehensively – for example the 
responsibility to sustain children with severe dis-
abilities at birth and to sustain the life of very 
premature babies. 
When it examined the Netherlands’ Second 
Report, it commented: 
“The Committee notes the information that 
euthanasia remains a crime under article 293 
of the Penal Code, but which is not prosecuted 
if committed by a medical doctor who meets 
the criteria explicitly set out in article 293 (2) 
of the Penal Code and follows the procedures 
required by law and regulations. As this 
legislation is also applicable to children 
aged 12 years or older, requiring explicit 
and repeated requests from the child, and 
parental consent if the child is younger than 
16 years, the Committee is concerned about 
the monitoring of such requests because 
controls are exercised after the request has 
been fulfilled and because some cases are 
not reported by doctors. The Committee is 
concerned about information that medical 
personnel have terminated the life of newborn 
infants with severe abnormalities.
“With respect to the Human Rights 
Committee’s recommendations in this regard 
(CCPR/CO/72/NET, para. 5), the Committee 
recommends that the State Party:
(a) Frequently evaluate, and if necessary 
revise, the regulations and procedures in the 
Netherlands with respect to the termination 
of life on request in order to ensure that 
children, including newborn infants with 
severe abnormalities, enjoy special protection 
and that the regulations and procedures are in 
conformity with article 6 of the Convention;
(b) Take all necessary measures to strengthen 
control of the practice of euthanasia and 
prevent non-reporting, and to ensure that the 
mental and psychological status of the child and 
parents or guardians requesting termination 
of life are taken into consideration when 
determining whether to grant the request;
(c) Provide in its next periodic report 
additional information on the implementation 
of laws and regulations on the termination of 
life on request.” (Netherlands and Aruba 
CRC/C/15/Add.227, paras. 33 and 34)

The Human Rights Committee, in its Concluding 
Observations referred to by the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, commented: “The Committee 
discussed the issue of euthanasia and assisted sui-
cide. The Committee acknowledges that the new 
Act concerning review procedures on the ter-
mination of life on request and assisted suicide, 
which will come into force on 1 January 2002, 
is the result of extensive public debate address-
ing a very complex legal and ethical issue. It fur-
ther recognizes that the new law seeks to provide 
legal certainty and clarity in a situation which has 
evolved from case law and medical practice over 
a number of years. The Committee is well aware 
that the new Act does not as such decriminalize 
euthanasia and assisted suicide. However, where 
a State Party seeks to relax legal protection with 
respect to an act deliberately intended to put an 
end to human life, the Committee believes that 
the Covenant obliges it to apply the most rigorous 
scrutiny to determine whether the State Party’s 
obligations to ensure the right to life are being 
complied with (articles 2 and 6 of the Covenant). 
“The new Act contains, however, a number of 
conditions under which the physician is not pun-
ishable when he or she terminates the life of a 
person, inter alia, at the “voluntary and well-con-
sidered request” of the patient in a situation of 
“unbearable suffering” offering “no prospect of 
improvement” and “no other reasonable solution”. 
The Committee is concerned lest such a system 
may fail to detect and prevent situations where 
undue pressure could lead to these criteria being 
circumvented. The Committee is also concerned 
that, with the passage of time, such a practice 
may lead to routinization and insensitivity to the 
strict application of the requirements in a way not 
anticipated. The Committee learnt with unease 
that under the present legal system more than 
2,000 cases of euthanasia and assisted suicide 
(or a combination of both) were reported to the 
review committee in the year 2000 and that the 
review committee came to a negative assessment 
only in three cases. The large numbers involved 
raise doubts whether the present system is only 
being used in extreme cases in which all the sub-
stantive conditions are scrupulously maintained. 
“The Committee is seriously concerned that the 
new law is also applicable to minors who have 
reached the age of 12 years. The Committee notes 
that the law provides for the consent of parents 
or guardians of juveniles up to 16 years of age, 
while for those between 16 and 18 the parents’ or 
guardian’s consent may be replaced by the will of 
the minor, provided that the minor can appropri-
ately assess his or her interests in the matter. The 
Committee considers it difficult to reconcile a 
reasoned decision to terminate life with the evolv-
ing and maturing capacities of minors. In view 
of the irreversibility of euthanasia and assisted 
suicide, the Committee wishes to underline its 
conviction that minors are in particular need of 
protection. 
“The Committee, having taken full note of the 
monitoring task of the review committee, is also 
concerned about the fact that it exercises only an 
ex post control, not being able to prevent the ter-
mination of life when the statutory conditions are 
not fulfilled. 
“The State Party should re-examine its law on 
euthanasia and assisted suicide in the light of 
these observations. It must ensure that the pro-
cedures employed offer adequate safeguards 
against abuse or misuse, including undue influ-
ence by third parties. The ex ante control mecha-
nism should be strengthened. The application of 
the law to minors highlights the serious nature 
of these concerns. The next report should pro-
vide detailed information as to what criteria are 
applied to determine the existence of a ‘voluntary 
and well-considered request’, ‘unbearable suf-
fering’ and ‘no other reasonable alternative’. It 
should further include precise information on the 
number of cases to which the new Act has been 
applied and on the relevant reports of the review 
committee. The State Party is asked to keep the 
law and its application under strict monitoring 
and continuing observation. 
“The Committee is gravely concerned at reports 
that new-born handicapped infants have had their 
lives ended by medical personnel. 
“The State Party should scrupulously investigate 
any such allegations of violations of the right to 
life (article 6 of the Covenant), which fall outside 
the law on euthanasia. The State Party should 
further inform the Committee on the number of 
such cases and on the results of court proceedings 
arising out of them.” (Netherlands, Human Rights 
Committee Concluding Observations on Third 
Periodic Report under the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, CCPR/CO/72/NET, 
paras. 5 and 6)
Article 10 of the new Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, adopted in December 
2006, on “the right to life”, requires: “States 
Parties reaffirm that every human being has the 
inherent right to life and shall take all necessary 
measures to ensure its effective enjoyment by 
persons with disabilities on an equal basis with 
others.” The Standard Rules on the Equalization 
of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities 
requires that “States should ensure that persons

with disabilities, particularly infants and chil-
dren, are provided with the same level of medical 
care within the same system as other members 
of society” (rule 2.3). The Rules emphasizes that 
States have an obligation “to enable persons with 
disabilities to exercise their rights, including their 
human, civil and political rights, on an equal 
basis with other citizens”, and to eliminate “any 
discriminatory provisions against persons with 
disabilities” (rule 15.1 and 15.2). 
Relevant to the principle of non-discrimination 
and the right to life, some States have introduced 
laws on abortion that permit termination of preg-
nancy at a later stage, sometimes up to full term 
when tests have indicated that the foetus has a 
disabling impairment.
As medical technology advances, these issues 
may become more complex and pose a greater 
number of ethical dilemmas and possible con-
flicts between the rights of the child and of his or 
her mother. 
In its General Comment No. 9 on “The rights of 
children with disabilities”, the Committee asserts 
that the inherent right to life, survival and devel-
opment is a right that warrants particular attention 
where children with disabilities are concerned: 
“In many countries of the world children with 
disabilities are subject to a variety of practices 
that completely or partially compromise this 
right. In addition to being more vulnerable 
to infanticide, some cultures view a child with 
any form of disability as a bad omen that may 
‘tarnish the family pedigree’ and, accordingly, 
a certain designated individual from the 
community systematically kills children with 
disabilities. These crimes often go unpunished 
or perpetrators receive reduced sentences. 
States Parties are urged to undertake all the 
necessary measures required to put an end 
to these practices, including raising public 
awareness, setting up appropriate legislation 
and enforcing laws that ensure appropriate 
punishment to all those who directly or 
indirectly violate the right to life, survival and 
development of children with disabilities.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 9, 2006, CRC/C/GC/9, para. 31. See 
also article 23, page 329.)
Infanticide 
In societies in which boys are valued economi-
cally and socially above girls, unequal population 
figures by gender indicate that selective abortion 
and/or infanticide may still be widespread. The 
Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth World 
Conference on Women states: “... in many coun-
tries available indicators show that the girl child 
is discriminated against from the earliest stages of 
life, through her childhood and into adulthood. In 
some areas of the world, men outnumber women 
by five in every 100.” Among the stated reasons 
for the discrepancy is preference for a son which 
results in prenatal sex selection and female infan-
ticide. The Platform for Action proposes elimina-
tion of “all forms of discrimination against the 
girl child and the root causes of son preference, 
which result in harmful and unethical practices 
such as prenatal sex selection and female infan-
ticide; this is often compounded by the increasing 
use of technologies to determine foetal sex, result-
ing in abortion of female foetuses... Enact and 
enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms 
of violence, including female infanticide and pre-
natal sex selection...” (Fourth World Conference 
on Women, Beijing, China, September 1995, 
Platform for Action, A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1, paras. 
259, 277(c) and 283(d)). 
The Committee raised the issue during examina-
tion of India’s Initial Report and recommended 
“... that the State Party undertake studies to 
determine the socio-cultural factors which 
lead to practices such as female infanticide and 
selective abortions, and to develop strategies 
to address them...” (India CRC/C/15/Add.115, 
para. 49) 
It returned to this issue when it examined India’s 
Second Report:
“The Committee notes the 2003 amendment 
to the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic 
Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 
1994, but remains deeply concerned that 
the sex ratio in the age group 0-6 years has 
worsened over the past decade.
“In addition to its recommendations 
regarding gender discrimination (para. 30), 
the Committee strongly recommends that the 
State Party:
(a) Take all necessary steps to ensure the 
implementation of the Pre-conception and 
Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of 
Sex Selection) Act, 1994;
(b) Further develop massive awareness 
campaigns, involving parents, communities, 
law enforcement officers, etc., and take 
the necessary measures, including imposing 
sanctions to end the practice of selective 
abortions and female infanticide; and 
(c) Undertake gender impact studies when 
planning programmes relating to economic 
and social policies.” (India CRC/C/15/Add.228, 
paras. 33 and 34) 
In its discussions with representatives of China fol-
lowing examination of the Initial Report, a mem-
ber of the Committee noted: “China had passed 
important legislation to address the problem of 
gender discrimination, but the distorted gender 
ratio was alarming, and had to be seen against a 
background of late abortions, the abandonment of

88
infants and possible infanticide...” (China CRC/C/
SR.299, para. 18)
The Committee followed up the issue in its 
Concluding Observations:
“While noting the measures taken to confront 
the problems of discrimination on the grounds 
of gender and disability, the Committee 
remains concerned at the persistence 
of practices leading to cases of selective 
infanticide...
“It is the Committee’s view that family 
planning policy must be designed to avoid 
any threat to the life of children, particularly 
girls. The Committee recommends in this 
regard that clear guidance be given to the 
population and the personnel involved in the 
family-planning policy to ensure that the aims 
it promotes are in accordance with principles 
and provisions of the Convention, including 
those of its article 24. The State Party is urged 
to take further action for the maintenance of 
strong and comprehensive measures to combat 
the abandonment and infanticide of girls as 
well as the trafficking, sale and kidnapping 
or abduction of girls.” (China CRC/C/15/Add.56, 
paras. 15 and 36)
And following examination of China’s Second 
Report, the Committee noted with satisfaction
“… the legal measures enacted to prohibit 
selective abortions and infanticide in mainland 
China. Nevertheless it remains concerned that 
selective abortions and infanticide as well as 
the abandonment of children, in particular 
girls and children with disabilities, continue 
as negative consequences of existing family 
planning policies and societal attitudes.
“The Committee urges the State Party 
to continue and strengthen its efforts to 
guarantee the right to life, survival and 
development of all children in its territory. It 
recommends that the State Party strengthen 
its implementation of existing laws against 
selective abortions and infanticide and take all 
necessary measures to eliminate any negative 
consequences arising from family planning 
policies, including abandonment and non-
registration of children and unbalanced sex 
ratios at birth.” (China CRC/C/CHN/CO/2, 
paras. 28 and 29)
Many legal systems recognize the particular 
crime of infanticide as a distinctly defined form 
of homicide with reduced penalties. The osten-
sible intention is to provide a special defence for 
mothers suffering psychological trauma as a result 
of the process of birth. But by denoting a special, 
and lesser, crime, such laws appear to discrimi-
nate against children as victims of homicide. 
The Committee told the Islamic Republic of Iran:
“The Committee reiterates its serious concern 
at article 220 of the Penal Code, which 
provides that fathers who kill their child, or 
their son’s child, are only required to pay one 
third of the blood money to the mother, and 
are subjected to a discretionary punishment, 
in the event that the mother makes a formal 
complaint.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take the necessary measures, including 
the amendment of the offending article of 
the Penal Code, to ensure that there is no 
discriminatory treatment for such crimes and 
that prompt and thorough investigations and 
prosecutions are carried out.” (Islamic Republic 
of Iran CR/C/15/Add.254, paras. 31 and 32) 
In addition to girls, children with disabilities are 
particularly at risk of infanticide in some countries, 
as noted by the Committee in recommendations 
adopted following its Day of General Discussion 
on “The rights of children with disabilities” in 
1997 (see article 23, page 329). It told Togo:
“The Committee is deeply concerned about 
reports of killing, in certain areas, of children 
born with disabilities, malformations, skin 
discoloration, as well as of children born 
with teeth, or from mothers who died during 
delivery.
“While taking note of the discussions that 
took place with the authors of these killings, 
the Committee urges the State Party urgently 
to take all necessary measures to prevent 
the occurrence of such killings, to prosecute 
those responsible for such crimes and to raise 
awareness among the population at large of 
the need to eradicate such practices.” (Togo 
CRC/C/15/Add.255, paras. 30 and 31)
Early marriage
An early age of marriage – in particular for girls 
– not only raises an issue of discrimination under 
article 2 but also threatens the rights of both 
the child-mother and the new child to life and 
to maximum survival and development under 
article 6 (for discussion see article 1, page 8 and 
article 2, page 22).
The Platform for Action of the Fourth World 
Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, 
indicates that: “More than 15 million girls aged 
15 to 19 give birth each year. Motherhood at 
a very young age entails complications dur-
ing pregnancy and delivery and a risk of mater-
nal death that is much greater than average. The 
children of young mothers have higher levels of 
morbidity and mortality...” (Platform for Action, 
A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1, para. 268) 
The death penalty 
Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child prohibits capital punishment “for 
offences committed by persons below eighteen 
years of age”. The Convention’s article 6 also

CHILD’S RIGHT TO LIFE AND MAXIMUM SURVIVAL AND DEVELOPMENT

asserts this by recognizing every child’s right to 
life and survival. 
Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights says: “Sentence of death shall 
not be imposed for crimes committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age and shall not be car-
ried out on pregnant women” (para. 5). A Second 
Optional Protocol to the Covenant, adopted by 
the United Nations General Assembly in 1989, 
aims at the abolition of the death penalty. Under 
its article 1, no one within the jurisdiction of a 
State Party to the Protocol may be executed. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
raised the issue with a number of States Parties 
and emphasized that it is not enough that the death 
penalty is not applied to children. Its prohibition 
regarding children must be confirmed in legis-
lation (see article 37, page 554 for Committee’s 
comments and further discussion).
The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on 
Human Rights on extrajudicial, summary or arbi-
trary executions has reported regularly on restric-
tions on the use of the death penalty, including its 
prohibition for juvenile offenders (see article 37, 
page 554).
Armed conflict 
Article 38 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (see page 573) requires special measures of 
care and protection for children affected by armed 
conflict. Armed conflict poses a threat to the 
right to life of many children and the Committee 
has frequently referred to this threat:
“The Committee is deeply concerned at 
the extensive violations of the right to life 
of children by, inter alia, armed conflict, 
deliberate killings by armed persons 
including members of the armed forces, 
state regroupment policies, other forms of 
population displacement, poor health and 
sanitation facilities, severe malnutrition 
and related illnesses, and as a result of the 
prevailing conflict between groups of the 
population. 
“The Committee strongly urges the State Party 
to make every effort to reinforce protection 
of the right to life, survival and development 
of all children within the State Party through 
policies, programmes and services that target 
and guarantee protection of this right. The 
Committee further urges the State Party 
to seek as much international assistance as 
possible in this regard.” (Burundi CRC/C/15/
Add.133, paras. 30 and 31)
“In the light of article 6 and other related 
provisions of the Convention, the Committee 
is deeply concerned at the threat posed by the 
armed conflict to children’s lives, including 
instances of extrajudicial killing, disappearance 
and torture committed by the police and 
paramilitary groups; at the multiple instances 
of ‘social cleansing’ of street children; and at 
the persistent impunity of the perpetrators of 
such crimes. 
“The Committee reiterates its recommendation 
[see CRC/C/15/Add.31] that the State Party 
continue taking effective measures to protect 
children from the negative effects of the 
armed conflict. The Committee urges the 
State Party to protect children against ‘social 
cleansing’ and to ensure that judicial action be 
taken against the perpetrators of such crimes.” 
(Colombia CRC/C/15/Add.137, paras. 34 and 35)
The Committee returned to the issue again when 
it examined Colombia’s Third Report:
“The Committee is concerned over numerous 
instances of violence by the regular military 
forces whereby children have been killed, 
including cases where children have been 
falsely reported as killed in combat by the 
army. Finally, the Committee notes with 
concern the unbroken pattern of impunity 
and the continuous tendency to refer serious 
violation of human rights to the military justice 
system.
“The Committee urges the State Party to break 
the legacy of impunity and urgently conduct 
criminal investigations of human rights 
violations in cases whereby children have lost 
their lives and ensure that the perpetrators are 
brought to justice as a matter of the highest 
priority. Furthermore, the Committee requests 
that the State Party respect its international 
legal obligations in relation to fair trials and 
ensure that all investigations are carried out 
independently and impartially.” (Colombia 
CRC/C/COL/CO/3, paras. 44 and 45)
In the same context the Committee has expressed 
concern at recruitment to armed forces:
“In the light of the provisions and principles 
of the Convention, especially the principles of 
the best interests of the child (art. 3) and the 
right to life, survival and development (art. 6), 
the Committee is deeply concerned at the early 
legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment 
into the armed forces. It recommends that 
the State Party raise the legal minimum age 
of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces 
in the light of international human rights and 
humanitarian law.” (Iraq CRC/C/15/Add.94,
 para. 15)
Also, the Committee has raised the threat to chil-
dren’s survival and development caused by land-
mines. For example, it advised Mozambique to 
“… continue efforts to clear landmines and 
ensure the provision of physical rehabilitation 
and other relevant support to victims.” 
(Mozambique CRC/C/15/Add.172, paras. 30 and 31)

The Human Rights Committee, in a General 
Comment in 1982, notes that “The right to life 
enunciated in article 6 of the Covenant ... is the 
supreme right from which no derogation is per-
mitted even in times of emergency.” The General 
Comment goes on to emphasize that averting the 
danger of war and strengthening international 
peace and security “would constitute the most 
important condition and guarantee for the safe-
guarding of the right to life”. (Human Rights 
Committee, General Comment No. 6, 1982, HRI/
GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 2, p. 166) 
And in another General Comment in 1984 it 
emphasizes that “the designing, testing, manufac-
ture, possession and deployment of nuclear weap-
ons are among the greatest threats to the right to 
life which confront mankind today ... The produc-
tion, testing, possession, deployment and use of 
nuclear weapons should be prohibited and recog-
nized as crimes against humanity. The Committee 
accordingly, in the interest of mankind, calls upon 
all States, whether parties to the Covenant or not, 
to take urgent steps, unilaterally and by agree-
ment, to rid the world of this menace.” (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 14, 
1984, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, paras. 4 to 7, p. 178)
Other life-threatening violence
to children 
The obligation under article 6 of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child to preserve the life of 
children and to promote survival and maximum 
development is expanded upon in many other 
articles (among them: article 19, protection from 
all forms of violence; article 37, protection 
from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment; article 38, protection 
of children affected by armed conflict and the 
Optional Protocol on the involvement of children 
in armed conflict).
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
asserted the right to life, as well as other provi-
sions, when expressing concern at violence to 
children by security forces, police and others. For 
example:
“... the Committee is deeply alarmed that the 
necessary safeguards against the excessive use 
of force by law enforcement officials or anyone 
else acting in this capacity are undermined by 
the provisions of section 73 of the Criminal 
Code. This may give rise to the violation of 
children’s rights, including their right to life, 
and leads to impunity for the perpetrators 
of such violations. Therefore, it is the view 
of the Committee that the above-mentioned 
provisions of the Nigerian Criminal Code are 
incompatible with the principles and provisions 
of the Convention.” (Nigeria CRC/C/15/Add.61, 
para. 24)
“While the Committee notes that the 
right to life, survival and development 
is integrated into domestic legislation, it 
remains extremely concerned at the number 
of children murdered, as reported by the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions in Brazil in her 2004 
report, which stated that the perpetrators of 
those crimes are mainly military policemen or 
former policemen (E/CN.4/2004/7/Add.3).
“The Committee urges the State Party to 
take, as a matter of the highest priority, all 
necessary measures to prevent the killing of 
children, to fully investigate each of those 
serious violations of children’s rights, to bring 
the perpetrators to justice and to provide the 
family of the victims with adequate support 
and compensation.” (Brazil CRC/C/15/Add.241, 
paras. 34 and 35) 
Examining the United Kingdom’s Second Report, 
the Committee expressed concern at the use of 
plastic baton rounds (bullets) for crowd control,
“… as it causes injuries to children and may 
jeopardize their lives.
“Following the recommendations of the 
Committee against Torture (A/54/44, 
para. 77(d)), the Committee urges the State 
Party to abolish the use of plastic baton rounds 
as a means of riot control.” (United Kingdom 
CRC/C/15/Add.188, paras. 27 and 28)
The particular vulnerability of unaccompanied 
and separated children is raised by the Committee 
in its 2005 General Comment:
“The obligation of the State Party under 
article 6 includes protection from violence and 
exploitation, to the maximum extent possible, 
which would jeopardize a child’s right to life, 
survival and development. Separated and 
unaccompanied children are vulnerable to 
various risks that affect their life, survival and 
development such as trafficking for purposes 
of sexual or other exploitation or involvement 
in criminal activities which could result in harm 
to the child, or in extreme cases, in death. 
Accordingly, article 6 necessitates vigilance 
by States Parties in this regard, particularly 
when organized crime may be involved…” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 6, 2005, CRC/GC/2005/6, paras. 23 
and 24) 
“Disappearance” of children has caused concern 
in a number of countries. In 2006, the General 
Assembly adopted the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, which includes specific provi-
sions on children who are subject to enforced dis-
appearance, or whose parents or guardians are 
(see also articles 8 and 37).
The right to life of children who live and/or work 
on the streets may be particularly threatened:

“The Committee is concerned at the very high 
number of street children in the State Party, 
which according to official estimates were 
more than 10,000 in Bogotá in 2001, due to 
socio-economic factors, the internal armed 
conflict as well as abuse and violence in the 
family. The Committee is concerned over the 
vulnerability of these children to youth gangs 
but is particularly disturbed by threats posed 
by social cleansing.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party:
(a) take effective measures to prevent social 
cleansing and other violence directed at street 
children;
(b) carry out a comprehensive study to assess 
the scope, nature and causes of the presence 
of street children and youth gangs (pandillas) 
in the country in order to develop a policy for 
prevention;
(c) provide street children with recovery 
and social reintegration services, taking 
into account their views in accordance with 
article 12, in particular by proactive outreach 
activities of the ICBF, taking due account 
of gender aspects, and provide them with 
adequate nutrition, housing, necessary 
healthcare and educational opportunities;
(d) develop a policy for family reunification 
where possible and in the best interest of the 
child;
(e) seek technical assistance from, inter alia, 
UNICEF.” (Colombia CRC/C/COL/CO/3, paras. 84 
and 85)
“Honour” killings. In its General Comment 
No. 4 on “Adolescent health and development in 
the context of the Convention on the rights of the 
child”, the Committee states:
“In light of articles 3, 6, 12, 19 and 24 (3) of 
the Convention, States Parties should take all 
effective measures to eliminate all acts and 
activities which threaten the right to life of 
adolescents, including honour killings. The 
Committee strongly urges States Parties to 
develop and implement awareness-raising 
campaigns, education programmes and 
legislation aimed at changing prevailing 
attitudes, and address gender roles and 
stereotypes that contribute to harmful 
traditional practices. Further, States Parties 
should facilitate the establishment of 
multidisciplinary information and advice 
centres regarding the harmful aspects of some 
traditional practices, including early marriage 
and female genital mutilation.” (Committee on 
the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 4, 
2003, CRC/GC/2003/4, para. 24)
It has raised the issue with individual States. For 
example:
“The Committee takes note of the recognition 
given to the problem of honour killings 
by the State Party, but is nonetheless very 
concerned at the widespread and increasing 
problem of so-called honour killings, affecting 
children both directly and, through their 
mothers, indirectly. The Committee is seriously 
concerned that, despite the efforts of the State 
Party, the police are often reluctant to arrest 
the perpetrators and that the latter receive 
lenient or token punishment.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take all necessary measures to ensure 
that there is no discriminatory treatment 
for crimes of honour and that they are 
promptly, fairly and thoroughly investigated 
and prosecuted. In addition, the Committee 
recommends that the State Party undertake a 
thorough review of the existing legislation and 
strengthen awareness-raising campaigns in this 
regard.” (Pakistan CRC/C/15/Add.217, paras. 34 
and 35)
“Noting the statement by the delegation that 
the problem of crimes committed in the name 
of honour do not exist in the State Party, the 
Committee is nevertheless concerned that the 
provisions relating to ‘honour crimes’ remain 
in the Penal Code. It is deeply concerned at the 
statement by the delegation that in some cases 
such crimes are not punished at all.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party:
(a) Rapidly review its legislation with a view to 
eliminating all provisions allowing sentences 
to be reduced if the crime in question is 
committed in the name of honour; 
(b) Amend the law in accordance with 
international standards and ensure prompt and 
thorough investigations and prosecutions; and
(c) Undertake awareness-raising activities 
to make such practices socially and morally 
unacceptable.” (Lebanon CRC/C15/Add.169, 
paras. 28 and 29)
It returned to the issue when it examined 
Lebanon’s Third Report: 
“The Committee expresses its deep concern 
at ‘the crimes committed in the name of 
honour’ affecting children both directly and, 
through their mothers, indirectly. It notes with 
particular concern that, according to article 
562 of the Penal Code, a man who kills his 
wife or other female relative may receive a 
reduced sentence if he demonstrates that he 
committed the crime in response to a socially 
unacceptable sexual relationship conducted 
by the victim. According to the information 
provided by the State Party, some of these 
crimes have been committed by children.
“In the light of article 6 of the Convention, 
the Committee strongly recommends that the 
State Party review as a matter of priority its 
domestic legislation, particularly article 562 
of the Penal Code, with a view to addressing 
‘honour crimes’ in an effective way and to

eliminating all provisions allowing reductions 
of sentence if the crime is committed in 
the name of ‘honour’. It recommends that 
the State Party provide special training and 
resources to law-enforcement personnel with 
a view to investigating and prosecuting such 
cases in an effective way. Furthermore, the 
State Party should raise awareness of this 
socially and morally unacceptable practice, 
involving also religious and community 
leaders.” (Lebanon CRC/C/LBN/CO/3, paras. 32 
and 33)
Other harmful traditional practices. The 
Convention requires States Parties to take 
action to abolish traditional practices prejudi-
cial to health of children (see article 24, page 
371). Traditional practices can also threaten the 
right to life and maximum survival and develop-
ment under article 6. For example, the Committee 
raised “child sacrifice” with Uganda:
“The Committee notes with deep concern that 
child sacrifice takes place in the districts of 
Mukono and Kayunga, a serious violation of 
the most fundamental rights of the child.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party: 
(a) Adopt appropriate legislative measures 
specifically prohibiting the practice of child 
sacrifice at the local level;
(b) Continue to ensure that people who 
sacrifice children are reported to the 
authorities and prosecuted; and
(c) Conduct awareness-raising campaigns 
through local Governments on negative 
cultural practices, especially in the districts 
concerned.” (Uganda CRC/C/UGA/CO/2, paras. 33 
and 34)
It also expressed concern to the Central African 
Republic concerning the right to life of children 
born in the breech position:
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party review the impact of traditional attitudes 
which may be harmful for children, such as 
attitudes with regard to children born in the 
breech position, and that the right to life be 
guaranteed...” (Central African Republic 
CRC/C/15/Add.138, para. 33)
Suicide. In its examination of reports by States 
Parties, the Committee has been concerned to 
find high, and in some cases increasing, rates of 
suicide among children in some countries. 
In several cases, the Committee has proposed 
studies on the causes and on the effective meth-
ods of prevention. For example:
“The Committee suggests that the State 
Party continue to give priority to studying 
the possible causes of youth suicide and 
the characteristics of those who appear to 
be most at risk and take steps as soon as 
practicable to put in place additional support 
and intervention programmes, be it in the 
field of mental health, education, employment 
or another field, which could reduce this 
tragic phenomenon. In this regard, the State 
Party may want to call on Governments and 
experts in other countries which also may have 
experience in dealing with this problem.” 
(New Zealand CRC/C/15/Add.71, para. 28)
When it examined New Zealand’s Second Report, 
the Committee recommended that the State Party 
should 
“… take all necessary measures to address 
youth suicide, especially among Maori youth, 
inter alia by strengthening the Youth Suicide 
Prevention Programme…” (New Zealand 
CRC/C/15/Add.216, para. 38)
The Guidelines for Periodic Reports (Revised 
2005) specifically asks for disaggregated data 
on deaths of children caused by suicide (see 
Appendix 3, page 702). 
Traffic accidents. Another common cause of 
preventable death, affecting children in particu-
lar, is traffic accidents:
“The Committee is concerned at the high 
incidence of traffic accidents which claim the 
lives of children.
“The Committee recommends to the State 
Party to strengthen and continue efforts to 
raise awareness about and undertake public 
information campaigns in relation to accident 
prevention.” (Jordan CRC/C/15/Add.125, paras. 37 
and 38)
“The Committee is concerned that ninety per 
cent of cases of people being run down by 
cars involve children, as indicated in the State 
Party’s report;
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party: … Develop and implement a policy for 
the prevention of accidents involving children, 
including through information campaigns 
targeting children, drivers, traffic police, 
teachers and parents.” (Mozambique CRC/C/15/
Add.172, paras. 30 and 31)
Investigation and registration of death
In its original Guidelines for Periodic Reports, 
the Committee acknowledges the importance of 
adequate investigation of and reporting on the 
deaths of all children and the causes of death, as 
well as the registration of deaths and their causes. 
Establishing an obligation and a procedure in leg-
islation for investigating all child deaths reduces 
the possibility of a cover-up of the real causes. 
In addition, it is acknowledged that because of 
religious and social attitudes, suicide tends to be 
underreported in many States. In States that have 
set up systematic procedures for investigating all 
child deaths, the experience tends to reveal many

e
more deaths in which some form of violence or 
neglect is implicated. Adequate investigation also 
informs preventive strategies. The Committee 
has urged States to establish statutory child death 
inquiries. (For example, see United Kingdom, 
CRC/C/15/Add.188, para. 40.)
The United Nations Rules for the Protection of 
Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty emphasizes 
the importance of an independent inquiry into 
the cause of death of any juvenile in detention. 
In some States, there has been disturbing evi-
dence of violence to and between inmates, as 
well as high suicide rates. The Rules requires 
that “Upon the death of a juvenile during the 
period of deprivation of liberty, the nearest rel-
ative should have the right to inspect the death 
certificate, see the body and determine the 
method of disposal of the body. Upon the death 
of a juvenile in detention, there should be an 
independent inquiry into the causes of death, 
the report of which should be made accessible to 
the nearest relative. This inquiry should also be 
made when the death of a juvenile occurs within 
six months from the date of his or her release 
from the detention facility and there is reason to 
believe that the death is related to the period of 
detention.” (Rule 57)
Article 9(4) of the Convention gives both parents 
and child the right to be informed of the death of 
either, if this has resulted from “any action initi-
ated by the State Party”, unless the provision of 
information would be detrimental to the well-
being of the child (see article 9, page 131).
“... ensure to the maximum 
extent possible the survival 
and development of the child”
In its second paragraph, article 6 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child goes 
beyond the fundamental right to life to promote 
survival and development “to the maximum 
extent possible”. The concept of “development” 
is not just about the preparation of the child for 
adulthood. It is about providing optimal condi-
tions for childhood, for the child’s life now. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
emphasized that it sees child development as an 
holistic concept, embracing the whole Convention. 
Many of the obligations of the Convention, 
including in particular those related to health, 
adequate standard of living, education, and lei-
sure and play (articles 24, 27, 28, 29 and 31) are 
relevant to ensuring the maximum development 
of the child, and individual articles expand on the 
concept of “development”. For instance, under 
article 27, States Parties recognize “the right of 
every child to a standard of living adequate for 
the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and 
social development”. Among the aims of educa-
tion set out in article 29 is “... The development 
of the child’s personality, talents and mental and 
physical abilities to their fullest potential...” and 
preparation of the child for “responsible life in a 
free society.” 
The Convention’s provisions protecting the child 
from violence and exploitation (in particular art-
icles 19 and 32 to 39) are as vital to maximum 
survival and development as are those on the pro-
vision of services. Research now testifies to the 
potentially serious short- and long-term effects 
on development of all forms of violence, includ-
ing sexual abuse and exploitation. 
The Convention’s Preamble upholds the family 
as the “natural environment for the growth and 
well-being of all its members and particularly 
children” and recognizes that the child, “for the 
full and harmonious development of his or her 
personality, should grow up in a family environ-
ment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and 
understanding”. Article 5 requires respect for the 
“evolving capacities of the child” – a key concept 
of overall development. Article 18 recognizes 
that parents or legal guardians have the “primary 
responsibility” for the upbringing and develop-
ment of the child and requires the State to pro-
vide appropriate assistance and under article 20, 
special protection for those deprived of a family 
environment. Article 25 requires periodic review 
of all children placed for care, protection or treat-
ment – an important safeguard for their maxi-
mum development. And in relation to children 
with disabilities, article 23 requires assistance to 
be provided “in a manner conducive to the child’s 
achieving the fullest possible social integration 
and individual development, including his or her 
cultural and spiritual development”.
The Committee expects implementation of all 
other articles to be carried out with a view to 
achieving the maximum survival and develop-
ment of the child – a concept clearly integral to 
the best interests of the child.

(Human Rights Committee, General Comment 
No. 17, 1989, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 7, p. 185)
Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child also contains a “new” right – the right of 
the child to know and be cared for by his or her 
parents. The right is qualified by the words “as 
far as possible”. It may not be possible to identify 
parents, and even when they are known, it may 
not be in the child’s best interests to be cared for 
by them.
Article 7 should be read in conjunction with article 
8 (preservation of identity, including nationality, 
name and family relations), article 9 (separation 
from parents), article 10 (family reunification) and 
article 20 (continuity in upbringing of children 
deprived of their family environment).  
■
rticle 7 provides for the birth regis-
tration of children and for children’s 
rights to a name, a nationality and 
to know and be cared for by their 
parents. 
The article reflects the text of article 24(2) and 
(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights: “24(2) Every child shall be re-
gistered immediately after birth and shall have 
a name. (3) Every child has the right to acquire 
a nationality.” The Human Rights Committee 
General Comment on article 24 of the Covenant 
notes: “In the Committee’s opinion, this provi-
sion should be interpreted as being closely linked 
to the provision concerning the right to special 
measures of protection and it is designed to pro-
mote recognition of the child’s legal personality.” 
Text of Article 7
1. The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to 
a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be 
cared for by his or her parents.
2. States Parties shall ensure the implementation of these rights in accordance with their 
national law and their obligations under the relevant international instruments in this field, 
in particular where the child would otherwise be stateless.

The child’s right to be 
“registered immediately 
after birth”
The importance of universal 
registration
The registration of all children is important for a 
number of reasons identified by the Committee, 
which has consistently expressed concern about 
countries that fail to secure universal registration.
Registration is the State’s first official acknowl-
edgement of the child’s existence; it represents 
recognition of each child’s individual importance 
to the State and of the child’s status under the law. 
Where children are not registered, they are likely 
to be less visible, and sometimes less valued. 
Children who are not registered often belong to 
groups who suffer from other forms of discrimi-
nation. For example:
“The Committee is concerned about the 
continuing difficulties encountered in ensuring 
birth registration, particularly of children born 
out of wedlock…” (Sri Lanka CRC/C/15/Add.40, 
para. 14)
“While noting the high level of birth 
registration, the Committee is concerned at 
the information that some groups of children, 
in particular children abandoned at maternity 
wards, children whose parents cannot afford 
the registration (related) fee, refugee children 
and children of internally displaced persons 
still do have difficulties with proper birth 
registration.” (Georgia CRC/C/15/Add.222, 
para. 26)
“… The Committee is … concerned at the 
information that Roma children are often not 
registered due to the lack of identification 
documents for their parents. They are also 
discriminated against by authorities who 
refuse to recognize the right of Roma children 
to registration.” (Bosnia and Herzegovina 
CRC/C/15/Add.260, para. 32) 
“The Committee notes with appreciation the 
significant efforts made by the State Party… 
However, it continues to be concerned that, 
in part because of existing family planning 
policies, all children are not systematically 
registered immediately after birth in mainland 
China, and that this disproportionately affects 
girls, children with disabilities and children 
born in some rural areas.” (China CRC/C/CHN/
CO/2, para. 42)
“Despite the State Party’s efforts in this area… 
the Committee is nevertheless concerned 
about the high number of children that remain 
without birth registration, particularly in 
the most remote areas of the country and in 
tsunami-affected areas. The Committee is 
also concerned about persisting difficulties 
in ensuring the registration of migrant 
workers, refugees and asylum seekers as well 
as of indigenous and minority communities, 
particularly those born outside hospitals…” 
(Thailand CRC/C/THA/CO/2, para. 31)
Birth registration is also an essential element 
of national planning for children, providing the 
demographic base on which effective strategies 
can be built. Without registration, for example, 
it is unlikely that countries can have an accurate 
knowledge even of their child mortality rates, a 
key indicator for child survival strategies (see 
also the importance of child death registration, 
article   6, page 92). While the costs of securing 
universal registration may be high, particularly 
in countries with dispersed rural populations, the 
benefits are substantial, not least in relation to 
efficient use of resources.
As the Committee has commented, registration is 
necessary:
“… to facilitate the effective monitoring of 
the situation of children and thus assist in 
the development of suitably appropriate and 
targeted programmes.” (Nicaragua CRC/C/15/
Add.36, para. 16)
“The Committee recommends that special 
efforts be developed to guarantee an effective 
system of birth registration, in the light of 
article 7 of the Convention, to ensure the full 
enjoyment of their fundamental rights by 
all children. Such a system would serve as a 
tool in the collection of statistical data, in the 
assessment of prevailing difficulties and in the 
promotion of progress in the implementation 
of the Convention...” (Ethiopia CRC/C/15/Add.67, 
para. 29)
These benefits may not be fully understood by 
the population: the Committee noted, in its exam-
ination of Mozambique:
“… There is widespread misunderstanding, for 
numerous reasons, of the purposes of birth 
registration…
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party… Conduct information campaigns 
for the general population explaining 
the importance and purposes of birth 
registration.” (Mozambique CRC/C/15/Add.172, 
paras. 34 and 35)
Registration may, additionally, be a means of 
securing children’s other rights – such as their 
identification following war, abandonment or 
abduction; enabling children to know their par-
entage (particularly if born out of marriage); pro-
viding protection by proving children are below 
legal age limits (for example for employment, or 
recruitment to the armed services or in the juve-
nile justice system), and reducing the danger of

e
trafficking in babies or of infanticide. At its most 
extreme, non-registration may threaten the physi-
cal survival of the child. For example, at the time 
of Peru’s Initial Report, the Committee expressed 
concern that: 
“... due to the internal violence, several 
registration centres have been destroyed, 
adversely affecting the situation of thousands 
of children who are often left without any 
identity document, thus running the risk 
of their being suspected of involvement in 
terrorist activities.” (Peru CRC/C/15/Add.8, 
para. 8)
Peru has since made “considerable efforts” to 
remedy this situation, although 15 per cent of 
Peruvian children are still unregistered (CRC/C/
PER/CO/3, para. 33).
And in Yemen
“… the Committee wishes to call the attention 
of the State Party to the serious implications 
of the absence of a birth certificate, which can 
result in the sentencing of a child to the death 
penalty…” (Yemen CRC/C/15/Add.102, para. 20)
The Human Rights Committee General Comment 
notes: “The main purpose of the obligation to 
register children after birth is to reduce the dan-
ger of abduction, sale of or traffic in children or 
of other types of treatment that are incompatible 
with the enjoyment of the rights provided for in 
the Covenant. Reports by States Parties should 
indicate in detail the measures that ensure the 
immediate registration of children born in their 
territory.” (Human Rights Committee, General 
Comment No. 17, 1989, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 
7, p. 185)
More problematically, a number of countries 
report that production of a birth certificate is 
necessary for children to secure health care, edu-
cation and other benefits (see box). While the 
motive is, at least in part, to increase the rate of 
birth registration, the Committee has made clear 
that this practice is misguided: the absence of a 
birth certificate should not be used to punish chil-
dren by denying them basic rights. For example, 
it recommended to Belize:
“… children whose births have not been 
registered and who are without official 
documentation should be allowed to access 
basic services, such as health and education, 
while waiting to be properly registered.” 
(Belize CRC/C/15/Add.252, para. 33)
When and how children should be 
registered
In its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing 
child rights in early childhood”, the Committee

1 A birth certificate is required only when the person is under the legal age of 
marriage: 16 for girls, 18 for boys.
2 An identification card is required but a residence card may suffice.
3 No registration system.
4 A house registration card is needed for most services and a birth certificate is 
needed to obtain a house registration card. A child may attend school but 
cannot receive a graduation certificate without a registration card.

“This can be achieved by a universal, well-
managed registration system that is accessible to 
all and free of charge. An effective system must 
be flexible and responsive to the circumstances 
of the family, for example by providing mobile 
registration units where appropriate. The 
Committee notes that children who are sick or 
disabled are less likely to be registered in some 
regions and emphasizes that all children should 
be registered at birth, without discrimination of 
any kind (art. 2). The Committee also reminds

States Parties of the importance of facilitating 
late registration of birth, and of ensuring that 
children who are not registered have equal 
access to health care, protection, education 
and other social services.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 7, 2005, 
CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 25)
For obvious reasons, securing universal registra-
tion can be difficult for poorer countries and the 
Committee has gone out of its way to congratu-
late States that have achieved high levels of regis-
tration, such as Sao Tome and Principe:
“The Committee… commends the State 
Party for the high scores attained in birth 
registration following the national campaign 
for birth registration… The Committee 
recommends that the State Party continue 
implementing is comprehensive strategy in 
order to achieve 100 per cent rate of birth 
registration as soon as possible...” (Sao Tome 
and Principe CRC/C/15/Add.235, para. 30)
According to article 7, the child should be 
registered “immediately after birth” which implies 
a defined period of days rather than months. 
However, if for any reason children are not 
registered or if their records have been lost, then, 
as the Committee says, the omission should be 
made good by the State.
Universal registration requires that domestic law 
makes registration a compulsory duty both of 
parents and of the relevant administrative author-
ities. Universal plainly means all children born 
within the State, irrespective of their national-
ity. The Committee was therefore critical of the 
Dominican Republic and Japan:
“… In particular, concern is expressed about 
the situation of children of Haitian origin or 
belonging to Haitian migrant families whose 
right to birth registration has been denied in 
the State Party. As a result of this policy, those 
children have not been able to enjoy fully 
their rights, such as to access to health care 
and education.” (Dominican Republic CRC/C/15/
Add.150, para. 26)
“The Committee is concerned… that 
undocumented migrants are unable to register 
the birth of their children, and that this has… 
resulted in cases of statelessness.” (Japan 
CRC/C/15/Add.231, para. 31)
However, the Committee has concluded that the 
imposition of fines or other sanctions on parents 
for failing to register their children is likely to be 
counter-productive. For example, it observed that 
Albanian parents who fail to meet a 30-day dead-
line to register their child “encounter additional 
difficulties” (Albania CRC/C/15/Add.249, para. 
34), and to Guinea Bissau:
“… the Committee remains concerned that 
not all children are registered at birth and that 
the imposition of a financial fine upon parents 
who register the birth of their child after the 
expiry of the official deadline is a hindrance 
to birth registration.” (Guinea Bissau CRC/C/15/
Add.177, para. 28)
Birth registration should be free, or at least free 
to poor parents:
“… The Committee urges the State Party to 
… ensure that all children are registered at 
birth… notably by suppressing any fees and 
decentralizing the system” (Haiti CRC/C/15/
Add.202, para. 33)
and
“… The Committee recommends that the 
State Party strengthen efforts to enusre that 
all children born in Armenia are registered… 
including by… waiving fees for the poor.” 
(Armenia CRC/C/15/Add.225, para. 28)
The Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 1997, 
notes: “Birth registration should be ensured by 
States Parties to every child under their jurisdic-
tion, including to non-nationals, asylum seekers, 
refugee and stateless children... In some situations, 
however, practical difficulties may be encoun-
tered in the registration of children. States Parties’ 
reports have shown that this is often the case in 
relation to children born from nomadic groups, 
in rural or remote areas where birth registration 
offices may be lacking and access to them may, 
in view of their distance, pose additional problems 
to the children’s families. Similar problems may 
arise in situations of emergency, including armed 
conflicts. In such circumstances, States have to 
adopt solutions which, being designed to ensure 
the implementation of this right, are also appro-
priate to the specific particularities of such situ-
ations. In this regard, the establishment of mobile 
registration offices has often shown to be an effec-
tive option.” (Manual, p. 430)
A systematic approach is consistently endorsed 
by the Committee:
“The Committee… recommends that the State 
Party improve the existing birth registration 
system by:
(a) Introducing birth registration units and 
public awareness-raising campaigns to reach 
the most remote areas of its territory;
(b) Strengthening cooperation between the 
birth registration authority and maternity 
clinics, hospitals, midwives and traditional 
birth attendants, in order to achieve better 
birth registration coverage in the country;
(c) Continuing to develop and widely 
disseminate clear guidelines and regulations 
on birth registration to officials at the national 
and local levels; and

(d) Ensuring that children whose births have 
not been registered and who are without 
official documentation have access to basic 
services, such as health and education, while 
waiting to be properly registered.” (Thailand 
CRC/C/THA/CO/2, para. 32)
The Committee encourages “innovative and 
accessible methods” to secure full registra-
tion (Mexico CRC/C/MEX/CO/3, para. 32), for 
example commending Brunei Darussalam’s “fly-
ing doctors team” (CRC/C/15/Add.219, para. 33), 
Netherlands Antilles’ initiative of a three-month 
“grace period” given to undocumented migrants 
to register themselves (CRC/C/15/Add.186, para. 
34) and the creation by Mauritius of “a hotline 
operating on a 24-hour basis through which tardy 
declarations can be made” (CRC/C/MUS/CO/2, 
para. 33). It recommends States to seek techni-
cal assistance from agencies such as UNICEF 
and UNFPA (India CRC/C/15/Add.228, para. 39), 
use mobile registration units and conduct public 
information campaigns with a view to: 
“… increasing the appreciation of the 
importance of birth registration and 
providing information on the procedure of 
birth registration, including the rights and 
entitlements derived from the registration, 
including through television, radio and printed 
materials...” (Ghana CRC/C/GHA/CO/2, para. 33)
Falsification of birth records is also a matter of con-
cern, as this can expose children to various forms 
of exploitation. The Committee recommended 
that Azerbaijan tackle the problem of “false data” 
and “control the accuracy of birth certificates and 
ensure the implementation of the applicable law 
in this respect” (Azerbaijan CRC/C/AZE/CO/2, 
paras. 31 and 32), and that the Philippines
“… take effective measures against simulation 
of birth certificates, inter alia, by assigning a 
governmental body, such as the Department of 
Social Welfare and Development, to monitor 
the implementation of relevant provisions and 
file all simulation cases.” (Philippines CRC/C/15/
Add.259, para. 35)
What details should be registered?
Although the Convention does not specify what 
must be registered, other rights (to name and 
nationality, to know parentage, family and iden-
tity) imply that registration ought, as a minimum, 
to include:
• the child’s name at birth,
• the child’s sex,
• the child’s date of birth,
• where the child was born, 
• the parents’ names and addresses,
• the parents’ nationality status.
For example, the Committee raised the need for 
systematic registration with Sierra Leone:
“The Committee is concerned that the 
absence of systematic birth registration in the 
State Party, thereby preventing an accurate 
statement of the identity or age of a child, 
can make it very difficult for the protection 
afforded to children by domestic legislation 
or by the Convention to be enforced. The 
Committee is also concerned at the arbitrary 
manner, in the absence of birth registration 
records, in which age and identity are 
frequently established. 
“In the light of article 7 of the Convention, 
the Committee recommends that the State 
Party establish as quickly as is possible a 
practice of systematic birth registration for all 
children born within the national territory. The 
Committee further urges the State Party to 
proceed with the registration of those children 
who have not thus far been registered.” (Sierra 
Leone CRC/C/15/Add.116, paras. 42 and 43)
Other information – for example the parents’ 
occupations, the child’s siblings or his or her eth-
nic status – may also be useful for statistical pur-
poses, although care must be taken that this does 
not invade privacy or lead to forms of discrimina-
tion. For example, the Committee took note that 
Rwanda had introduced a new birth certificate 
and identity card “that did not refer to ethnic ori-
gin” (Rwanda CRC/C/15/Add.234, para. 32). For 
this reason Honduras reported to the Committee 
that the parents’ marriage status is not included 
on certificates, though the names of the baby’s 
grandparents and the baby’s size and birth weight 
are required (Honduras CRC/C/3/Add.17, para. 43; 
Honduras CRC/C/15/Add.24, para.12; Honduras 
CRC/C/6/Add.2, paras. 416 and 418).
The registration of the baby’s parents may prove 
problematic. It is hard to find reasons, so far as 
the child is concerned, why the baby’s mother 
should not be registered, although such an omis-
sion is permitted in France, to the expressed con-
cern of the Committee (see below, page 106).
The matter of naming the father is more com-
plicated. The State is likely to have an interest 
in both parents being registered so that they can 
subsequently be required to maintain the child. 
The child, too, has a right under this article to 
know who his or her parents are. The Committee 
raised the matter with Ireland:
“The Committee is concerned about the 
disadvantaged situation of children born 
of unmarried parents due to the lack of 
appropriate procedures to name the father in 
the birth registration of the child…
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take appropriate measures to establish, as 
far as possible, procedures for the inclusion of

102
the name of the father on the birth certificates 
of children born of unmarried parents…” 
(Ireland CRC/C15/Add.85, paras. 17 and 36)
However, given that birth registers tend to be pub-
lic documents, the child’s right to privacy must be 
protected, for example in a case where the father 
has an incestuous relationship with the mother. 
Belgium reported that it allowed registration of the 
single filiation from the mother in such circum-
stances (Belgium CRC/C/11/Add.4, para. 124). 
The United Nations Statistics Division publishes 
advice in the Handbook on Civil Registration 
and Vital Statistics Systems on aspects of birth 
registration such as techniques for reaching tar-
get groups, confidentiality and storage of records 
and legal frameworks, particularly. (See http://
millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/demographic/
sources/civilreg/civilreg3.htm.)
The child’s right “from birth 
to a name”
The article specifically provides that the right to 
a name should be “from birth”. The Committee 
noted that there should be no delay:
“The Committee… is concerned that some 
children are still not registered at birth and are 
not given a name until their baptism, which 
could be three or four months after their 
birth...” (Grenada CRC/C/15/Add.121, para. 16)
States should therefore ensure that abandoned 
babies and children are always provided with a 
name; any temptation to use numbers should be 
resisted – for example in circumstances of mass 
movement of refugees which include many unac-
companied children. 
The Convention does not suggest that chil-
dren have a right to any particular sort of name. 
However, a significant number of countries not 
only make arrangements for children’s names to 
be registered but also prescribe what names are 
used. For example, article 18 of the American 
Convention on Human Rights (1969) states: 
“Every person has the right to a given name and 
to the surname of his parents or that of one of 
them. The law shall regulate the manner in which 
this right shall be ensured for all, by the use of 
assumed names if necessary.”
The intention of such a provision appears relatively 
uncontroversial and protective of certain catego-
ries of children – as the Human Rights Committee 
General Comment observes “providing for the right 
to have a name is of special importance in the case 
of children born out of wedlock” (Human Rights 
Committee, General Comment No. 17, 1989, HRI/
GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 7, p. 185). However in some 
circumstances prescriptive laws on names may 
conflict with the non-discrimination rights under 
article 2 or with the right to peacefully enjoy 
minority cultural practices under article 30, for 
example in cases where minority groups have dif-
ferent naming traditions that do not involve using 
parental surnames.
In this regard the Committee raised its concern 
with Greece that “persons who speak a language 
other than Greek, including refugees and asylum
seekers, have difficulty in registering names 
for their children in their native language” and 
recommended
“… That all children are able to registered 
under, and make use of, their full original 
name as chosen by themselves, their parents 
or other legal guardians.” (Greece CRC/C/15/
Add.170, paras. 40 and 41)
Moreover, where countries go further and enforce 
a blanket law that the child must, or in some cases 
must not, bear the father’s name, this may not be 
necessarily in the child’s best interests. For exam-
ple, Belgium maintains an extremely complicated 
set of laws relating to the naming of children born 
in and out of marriage, including children born of 
adulterous relationships where the father’s name 
can only be used with the agreement of the woman 
who was his lawful wife at the time of the con-
ception. Belgium acknowledged the latter rules 
have been problematic, since they are as much 
about the “moral interests of the conjugal family” 
as about the best interests of the child (Belgium 
CRC/C/11/Add.4, para. 123).
The Committee raised the issue with Uruguay:
“In this regard, the Committee is particularly 
concerned at the persisting discrimination 
against children born out of wedlock, 
including in regard to the enjoyment of their 
civil rights. It notes that the procedure for the 
determination of their name paves the way for 
their stigmatization and the impossibility of 
having access to their origins...” (Uruguay 
CRC/C/15/Add.62, para. 11)
It would be dangerous to assume that any inter-
national or domestic law asserting children’s right 
to their parents’ name necessarily represents a 
provision “more conducive to the realization 
of the rights of the child” under article 41 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Countries 
should also carefully examine any laws on names 
for inadvertent breach of articles 2 and 3. 
The provisions of article 5 (parental guidance and 
the child’s evolving capacities), article 12 (respect 
for the child’s opinion) and article 19 (protection 
from harm) should also be considered in rela-
tion to naming. The right to a name from birth

is unavoidably a matter for adult caregivers or 
the State; babies can play no part in choosing 
their names. However, provision should be made 
so that children can apply to the appropriate 
authorities to change their name at a later date. 
Children’s names can also be changed following 
the remarriage of parents or adoption. In such 
circumstances, children’s rights to identity are 
also involved and the Committee specifically 
recommended that New Zealand’s adoption law 
reform ensured “the right of children, as far as 
possible, to maintain one of their original first 
names”. (New Zealand CRC/C/15/Add.216, para. 
34. See also article 8, page 114.)
The Committee took up the question of chil-
dren’s own rights with the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro):
“The Committee takes note that the principle 
of respect for the views of the child has been 
reflected in such situations as the change of 
name ...“ (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia 
and Montenegro) CRC/C/15/Add.49, para. 31)
Although parents are the persons most likely to 
decide the child’s name, consistency with the 
Convention should not allow this to be an abso-
lute parental right. Domestic laws should have 
appropriate mechanisms to prevent registration of 
a name that might make a child an object of ridi-
cule, bad luck or discrimination, as for example 
in Malawi’s “practice of derogatory names being 
assigned to some children such as children born 
out of wedlock”, which the Committee recom-
mended the government abolish (Malawi CRC/
C/15/Add.174, paras. 31 and 32).
The child’s right to “acquire a
 nationality”, with particular 
reference to the State’s 
“obligations under the relevant
international instruments, in
particular where the child 
would otherwise be stateless”
Some States confer a limited form of nationality 
to certain groups of children, for example to the 
children of parents who are not themselves citi-
zens. This appears to be a form of discrimination. 
The “right to acquire a nationality” implies a right 
to all the benefits derived from nationality.
This point was taken up by the Committee with a 
number of countries, for example:
“The Committee is very concerned that the 
granting of citizenship to children born in the 
State Party is restricted on the basis of colour 
or racial origin by the provisions contained in 
article 27 of the Constitution and the Alien and 
the Nationalization Law, which are contrary to 
article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child.” (Liberia CRC/C/15/Add.236, para. 32)
“The Committee is… deeply concerned that 
the Citizenship Act establishes three different 
categories of citizenship, possibly resulting in 
some categories of children and their parents 
being discriminated against, stigmatized and/
or denied certain rights.” (Myanmar CRC/C/15/
Add.237, para. 34)
“The Committee… remains concerned about 
the different types of access to citizenship, 
which mainly affect children of minority 
groups, especially Roma children.” (Croatia 
CRC/C/15/Add.243, para. 31)
The issue of children’s nationality is particularly 
difficult, given the sensitivity of all nations about 
sovereignty and citizenship, differing legal and 
cultural presumptions on how nationality should 
be acquired and the ever-increasing anxiety of 
richer nations to exclude, or to deny citizenship 
to, poor people from other nations. The drafting 
of this article and articles 9 (separation from par-
ents) and 10 (family reunification) picks a careful 
way between these anxieties and the recogni-
tion that children should have a right to national-
ity. Article 7(2) thus provides that “States Parties 
shall ensure the implementation of these rights in 
accordance with their national law and their obli-
gations under the relevant international instru-
ments in this field, in particular where the child 
would otherwise be stateless.” 
Nonetheless, a number of reservations or interpre-
tative declarations have been entered to article 7 
– by countries such as Liechtenstein, Malaysia, 
Singapore, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and 
the United Kingdom. These countries indicate that 
their Constitutions or domestic laws relating to 
nationality may define or restrict the scope of arti-
cle 7. For example, Kuwait stated: “The State of 
Kuwait understands the concept of article 7 to sig-
nify the right of the child who was born in Kuwait 
and whose parents are unknown (parentless) to be 
granted Kuwaiti nationality as stipulated by the 
Kuwaiti Nationality Laws” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 
27), though in fact stateless children may not nec-
essarily be parentless. The Committee expressed 
concern about Kuwait’s nationality laws:
“The Committee is… concerned that in the 
light of the State Party’s legislation regarding 
citizenship, nationality may only be obtained 
by a child from his/her Kuwaiti father. The 
Committee recommends that domestic 
legislation be amended to guarantee that 
the acquisition of Kuwaiti nationality be 
determined in the light of the provisions and 
principles of the Convention, especially articles 
2, 3 and 7.” (Kuwait CRC/C/15/Add.96, para. 20)

The wording “right to acquire a nationality” is 
taken directly from the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (article 24(3)). 
The General Comment by the Human Rights 
Committee already quoted states: “Special 
attention should also be paid, in the context of 
the protection to be granted to the children, to 
the right of every child to acquire a nationality, 
as provided for in article 24, paragraph 3. While 
the purpose of this provision is to prevent a child 
from being afforded less protection by society and 
the State because he is stateless, it does not neces-
sarily make it an obligation for States to give their 
nationality to every child born in their territory. 
However, States are required to adopt every appro-
priate measure, both internally and in cooperation 
with other States, to ensure that every child has 
a nationality when he is born. In this connection, 
no discrimination with regard to the acquisition 
of nationality should be admissible under inter-
nal law as between legitimate children and chil-
dren born out of wedlock or of stateless parents 
or based on the nationality status of one or both 
of the parents. The measures adopted to ensure 
that children have a nationality should always be 
referred to in reports by States Parties.” (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 17, 
1989, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 8, p. 185) 
The words in article 7(2): “States Parties shall 
ensure the implementation of these rights in 
accordance with their national law and their obli-
gations under the relevant international instru-
ments in this field, in particular where the child 
would otherwise be stateless” refer primarily to 
the Convention on Reduction of Statelessness 
(1961), which provides that children should 
acquire the nationality of the State in which they 
were born if they are not granted nationality by 
any other State, or if such children fail to make 
the proper applications to obtain this right, then 
they should be entitled to the nationality of one 
of their parents (subject to certain conditions). 
Originally it was proposed that the first provision 
be incorporated into the Convention but difficul-
ties with some national laws made this unaccept-
able (E/CN.4/L.1542, pp. 6 and 7; Detrick, pp. 
125 to 129). Article 7(2) represents a compromise 
between the two positions and is a clear pointer to 
the provisions of article 41: “Nothing in the pres-
ent Convention shall affect any provisions which 
are more conducive to the realization of the rights 
of the child and which may be contained in ... (b) 
International law in force for that State.”
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
raised concerns about stateless children:
“The Committee welcomes the amendments 
made in 1998 to the Law on Citizenship 
simplifying procedures for the naturalization 
of children of stateless persons and notes that 
the number of stateless persons in Estonia 
is decreasing. Nevertheless, the Committee 
is concerned that the stateless situation 
of parents, who by virtue of their status 
are unable to participate fully in Estonian 
society, negatively impacts on their children’s 
integration into Estonian society. Moreover, it 
is concerned that, under article 21 of the Law 
on Citizenship, children of former military and 
security service personnel and their spouses 
and families may be denied citizenship.” 
(Estonia CRC/C/15/Add.196, para. 28)
“… the Committee regrets that children of 
Syrian-born Kurdish parents who are stateless 
and have no other nationality at birth 
continued to be denied Syrian nationality 
and are subject to discrimination, contrary to 
articles 2 and 7 of the Convention.” (Syrian Arab 
Republic CRC/C/15/Add.212, para. 33)
“The Committee is concerned that ... there 
are still disparities in practice, in particular 
with regard to... the acquisition of Jordanian 
nationality. In this last respect, the Committee 
is concerned that in the light of Jordanian 
legislation, cases of statelessness might 
arise…” (Jordan CRC/C/15/Add.21, para. 11)
This concern was revived in the Committee’s 
Concluding Observations on Jordan’s Second 
Report:
“… In light of the Committee’s previous 
recommendations … the Committee remains 
concerned that restrictions on the right of a 
Jordanian woman to pass on her nationality 
to her child, particularly where she is married 
to a refugee, may result in the child becoming 
stateless.” (Jordan CRC/C/15/Add.125, para. 29)
The Committee consistently recommends that 
States ratify the 1954 Convention relating to 
the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.
Nationality can be acquired either from parents 
(jus sanguinis) or from place of birth (jus soli). 
Islamic law favours nationality taken from par-
entage; some countries prohibit dual nationality, 
so that a choice between nationalities may have 
to be made for children, and some countries have 
systems that accommodate both parentage and 
place of birth, sometimes with discriminatory 
effects. 
Other potentially discriminatory practices are 
when the child automatically takes the national-
ity of the father rather than the mother, or vice 
versa, or when children can only inherit national-
ity from married fathers. It should be noted that 
article 9(2) of the Convention on the Elimination 
–> Table of Contents

e
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
states: “States Parties shall grant women equal 
rights with men with respect to the nationality of 
their children.”
The United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom 
and Japan, for example, were among those 
criticized by the Committee:
“The Committee is concerned that the nation-
ality law does not grant citizenship status to 
children of a woman citizen of the Emirates 
married to a non-national, as it does where the 
father is a national of the Emirates.” (United 
Arab Emirates CRC/C/15/Add.183, para. 30)
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party… amend the nationality law to allow 
transmission of nationality through unmarried 
as well as married fathers.” (United Kingdom 
CRC/C/15/Add.188, para. 23)
“The Committee is concerned that a child of 
a Japanese father and foreign mother cannot 
obtain Japanese citizenship unless the father 
has recognized the child before its birth, which 
has, in some cases, resulted in the child being 
stateless.” (Japan CRC/C/15/Add.231, para. 31)
The words “the right to acquire a nationality” 
can be interpreted as being the right “from birth”, 
(Principle 3 of the Declaration of the Rights of 
the Child (1959) states simply: “The child shall 
be entitled from his birth to a name and a nation-
ality”), but in any event must mean that state-
less children should have the right to acquire 
the nationality of the country in which they have 
lived for a specified period. The latter provision 
is important given the growing numbers of state-
less, often parentless, children who receive ade-
quate protection from the country in which they 
live throughout their childhood but then discover 
that they are unlawful residents at the time of 
their majority. 
Decisions about nationality are often made by 
parents at the time of the child’s birth. Older chil-
dren, however, should be able to apply on their 
own behalf to change their nationality. Canada 
was commended for adopting laws to facilitate 
the acquisition of citizenship by children adopted 
abroad by Canadian citizens, an essential com-
ponent of foreign adoptions. (Canada CRC/C/15/
Add.215, para. 26)
“as far as possible, the right 
to know... his or her parents”
Meaning of “parent”
A few decades ago the definition of “parent” was 
fairly straightforward. There were the “biologi-
cal” parents, sometimes known as the “natural” 
or “birth” parents, and there might also be “psy-
chological” or “caring” parents, such as adoptive 
or foster parents, who acted as the child’s primary 
caregiver throughout his or her infancy.
When article 7 was drafted, it was pointed out 
that the laws of some countries – for example, the 
former German Democratic Republic, the United 
States of America and the former Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics – upheld “secret” adoptions 
whereby adopted children did not have the right 
to know the identity of their biological parents 
(E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 18 to 22; Detrick, p. 127). 
However, nowadays the term “biological” parent 
may have a more complex meaning. For exam-
ple, where egg donation is concerned, the biologi-
cal parent could be either the genetic parent (the 
donor of the egg) or the birth mother. 
Countries have entered declarations and reserva-
tions in relation to this right: “The United Kingdom 
interprets the references in the Convention to ‘par-
ents’ to mean only those persons who, as a mat-
ter of national law, are treated as parents. This 
includes cases where the law regards a child as 
having only one parent, for example where a child 
has been adopted by one person only and in cer-
tain cases where a child is conceived other than as 
a result of sexual intercourse by the woman who 
gives birth to it and she is treated as the only par-
ent.” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 42)
“In cases of irrevocable adoptions, which are 
based on the principle of anonymity of such adop-
tions, and of artificial fertilization, where the phy-
sician charged with the operation is required to 
ensure that the husband and wife, on the one hand, 
and the donor, on the other, remain unknown to 
each other, the non-communication of a natural 
parent’s name or natural parents’ names to the 
child is not in contradiction with this provision.” 
(Czech Republic, CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 20)
“The Government of Luxembourg believes that 
article 7 of the Convention presents no obstacle to 
the legal process in respect of anonymous births, 
which is deemed to be in the interest of the child, 
as provided under article 3 of the Convention.” 
(CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 28) 
Notwithstanding these reactions, a reasonable 
assumption is that, as far as the child’s right to 
know his or her parents is concerned, the def-
inition of “parents” includes genetic parents 
(for medical reasons alone this knowledge is of 
increasing importance to the child) and birth par-
ents, that is the mother who gave birth and the 
father who claimed paternity through partner-
ship with the mother at the time of birth (or what-
ever the social definition of father is within the

culture: the point being that such social definitions 
are important to children in terms of their iden-
tity). In addition, a third category, the child’s psy-
chological parents – those who cared for the child 
for significant periods during infancy and child-
hood – should also logically be included since 
these persons too are intimately bound up in chil-
dren’s identity and thus their rights under article 8 
(see page 114). 
Certainly the Committee has expressed dismay at 
Luxembourg’s concept of an ‘anonymous’ birth:
“The Committee remains concerned about 
the fact that the children born anonymously 
(‘under x’) are denied the right to know, as 
far as possible, their parents… [and] urges the 
State Party to take all necessary measures to 
prevent and eliminate the practice… 
“In case anonymous births continue to 
take place, the State Party should take the 
necessary measures so that all information 
about the parent(s) are registered and filed 
in order to allow the child to know – as far as 
possible and at the appropriate time – his/her 
parent(s).” (Luxembourg CRC/C/15/Add.250, 
paras. 28 and 29)
Meaning of “as far as possible”
It is necessary to distinguish between different 
situations. 
First there are children whose parent cannot be 
identified (for example, when the mother does 
not know who the father is or when the child 
has been abandoned). States Parties can do little 
about this, although legislation under article 2 
must ensure that such children are not discrimi-
nated against. 
Second, births occur where the mother refuses 
to identify the father (including extreme circum-
stances, for example in cases of incest or when 
the father has raped the mother). While mothers 
could, arguably, be legally required to name the 
father, it would be difficult to enforce this and 
conflict could be raised between the mother’s 
rights and the child’s rights. However, in many 
countries fathers of children born out of marriage 
often refuse to be identified. While recogniz-
ing that this is a social problem, the Committee 
believes that the State also has a role to play:
“The Committee is concerned that many 
children born out of wedlock do not know the 
identity of their father, inter alia, because of 
societal pressures that cause mothers to be 
reluctant to file a paternity action…
“Noting the supportive role that the 
Department of Family Services is already 
playing in this regard, the Committee 
recommends that the State Party further 
facilitate and support the activities (including 
paternity procedures) which will contribute 
to the full implementation of the rights of 
children to know their parents.” (Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines CRC/C/15/Add.184, paras. 26 
and 27)
“Given the information that some 50 per 
cent of all households in the State Party are 
headed by women, the Committee expresses 
its concern that the establishment of legal 
paternity, where the biological father does 
not want to legally recognize the child, is time 
consuming and expensive…
“… the Committee recommends that the State 
Party facilitate the establishment of legal 
paternity for children born out of wedlock by 
creating accessible and expeditious procedures 
and by providing mothers with necessary legal 
and other assistance in this regard.” (Antigua 
and Barbuda CRC/C/15/Add.247, paras. 33 and 34)
In some countries even the mother’s identity may 
be concealed at her request, for example in Italy 
and France: 
“The Committee is… concerned that children 
born out of wedlock legally do not have a 
mother or a father unless they are recognized 
by their mothers and/or fathers.” (Italy 
CRC/C/15/Add.198, para.27)
“… The Committee remains concerned that… 
the right to conceal the identity of the mother 
if she so wishes is not in conformity with the 
provisions of the Convention.” (France 
CRC/C/15/Add.240, para. 23)
Third, there are the situations when the State 
decides that a parent should not be identified. 
For example:
• where adoption law limits the children’s enti-
tlement and access to information to know 
that they are adopted and who their genetic 
parents are. The Committee has expressed 
concern about a number of countries that 
maintain policies of ‘secret’ adoptions and 
always firmly recommends that the children 
be told about their parentage:
“The Committee reiterates its concern at 
the practice of keeping the identity of 
biological parents of the adoptee secret…
“… The adoption law should guarantee the 
right of the child to know his or her origin 
and to have access to information about 
the background and vital medical history 
of both the child and biological parents…” 
(Armenia CRC/C/15/Add.225, para. 38)
“The Committee notes with concern that 
the right of an adopted child to know his or 
her original identity is not protected in the 
State Party. 
“The Committee encourages the State 
Party to protect the right of the adopted 
child to know his or her original identity,

establishing appropriate legal procedures 
for this purpose, including recommended 
age and professional support measures.” 
(Russian Federation CRC/C/RUS/CO/3, paras. 40 
and 41)
“The Committee urges the State Party… 
to ensure that adopted children at the 
appropriate age have the right to access 
to the identity of their biological 
parents…” (Uzbekistan CRC/C/UZB/CO/2, 
paras. 40 and 41)
• where the law requires a falsification of pater-
nity on the birth certificate, for example in rela-
tion to a child whose father is not the mother’s 
current husband or, as in the case of Uruguay, 
where the Committee deplored the fact that as 
regards children born out of marriage:
“... when born to a mother or father 
who is a minor, these children cannot be 
recognized by that parent.“ (Uruguay 
CRC/C/15/Add.62, para. 11)
• with anonymous egg/sperm donation for in 
vitro fertilization, where most countries pro-
tect the secrecy of the donor;
• where the State tacitly encourages the aban-
doning of children, as for example, Austria:
“The Committee is concerned at the 
practice of anonymous birth in the State 
Party (also known as ‘baby flaps’ or ‘baby 
nests’) and notes the information that 
some data on the parent(s) are collected 
in an informal manner.” (Austria CRC/C/15/
Add.251, para. 29)
This last category, of state-approved secrecy, 
includes the most controversial aspects of the 
interpretation of “as far as possible”, appearing 
to unnecessarily breach children’s right to know 
their genetic parents. 
Some States Parties argue that “secret” adop-
tions (where the child is not entitled to discover 
his or her genetic parents) are necessary to secure 
the success of an adoption. However, many other 
countries have shown that policies of open adop-
tions do not adversely affect the outcome for the 
child. 
The United Nations Declaration on Social and 
Legal Principles Relating to the Protection and 
Welfare of Children with Special Reference to 
Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally and 
Internationally provides that “The need of a fos-
ter or an adopted child to know about his or her 
background should be recognized by persons 
responsible for the child’s care unless this is con-
trary to the child’s best interests” (article 9). 
Three points should be noted. First, article 7 
does not refer to “the best interests of the child,” 
although this was proposed by some delegates in 
the drafting sessions (E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 18 to 
22; Detrick, p. 129). The words “as far as pos-
sible” appear to provide a much stricter and less 
subjective qualification than “best interests”. The 
words imply children are entitled to know their 
parentage if this is possible, even if this is deemed 
to be against their best interests. But the holis-
tic nature of the Convention suggests that a child 
who would definitely be harmed by the discovery 
of his or her parent’s identity could be prevented 
from having this information. This interpreta-
tion is supported by the fact that “as far as pos-
sible” also covers the child’s right to be cared for 
by his or her parents – and no one could maintain 
that “as far as possible” in that context does not 
include consideration of the child’s best interests. 
But it is clear that children’s right to know their 
parentage could only be refused on the grounds of 
best interests in the most extreme and unambigu-
ous circumstances, and children should be given 
the opportunity for this decision to be reviewed at 
a later date.
Second, “best interests” is nowhere defined and 
there are no easy answers as to whether it is more 
harmful to children’s best interests to give them 
distressing information about their origins or to 
refuse them this information on the grounds the 
information might cause them harm. 
Third, the Convention’s articles 5 (evolving 
capacities of the child) and 12 (child’s opinion) 
suggest that the determination of what is or is not 
in the child’s best interests so far as knowledge of 
origins is concerned may not be made just at one 
point during the child’s life. The best interests of 
a 6-year-old in relation to this issue may be quite 
different from the best interests of a 16-year-
old. This is not to say that adopted children are 
obliged to contact or even to be told the details 
of their genetic parents (although it appears to 
be the accepted practice in most countries that 
children should know the circumstances of their 
birth from as early an age as possible. In the 
Netherlands, for example, “it is standard practice 
for the child to be informed about its natural par-
ents. The adoption court checks that this has been 
done” (Netherlands CRC/C/51/Add.1, para. 76)). 
Many children choose not to trace their genetic 
parents, since the significant parents in their lives 
are likely to be those who have cared for them 
and raised them. Nonetheless under the terms of 
article 7, the State should ensure that information 
about genetic parents is preserved to be made 
available to children if possible.
A stronger argument, mounted by those countries 
that maintain secrecy, is not about the rights of 
the child (or of the adopting couple) but about

protecting the child’s mother from extreme forms 
of social condemnation, such as ostracism, injury 
or death. In such instances there are competing 
rights: children’s rights to know their origins 
and mothers’ rights to confidentiality and pro-
tection. Article 30 of the Hague Convention on 
Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect 
of Intercountry Adoption (1993) (see article 21, 
page 299) upholds mothers’ rights, empowering 
the State of origin of the child to withhold 
information about the parents’ identity. Those 
countries that maintain adoption secrecy in order 
to protect the mother should, nonetheless, have 
provisions to release information to the child, 
either with the mother’s permission or at a time 
when she will not suffer harm. The Committee 
has not accepted arguments in favour of actively 
falsifying the records of adopted children.
Similar arguments prevail over falsifying parent-
age in cases of adultery. Some countries require 
that husbands are the lawfully recognized fathers 
of any children born within that marriage. In 
many cases this entails the complicity of the 
mother and is likely to be rather more to the bene-
fit than to the disadvantage of the child. However, 
there is a difference between individuals lying 
and States enforcing a lie. In some circumstances 
both parents will want the true parentage of a 
child to be declared and may be prevented by the 
law from doing so.
Regarding the secrecy of egg and sperm donation, 
two arguments are commonly made. First, that it 
is not in the best interests of the child to know 
of his or her artificial conception. This does not 
seem convincing, however, particularly now there 
are medical reasons for knowing genetic parent-
age. Second, it is argued that unless their ano-
nymity is secured donors will be deterred, fearing 
future embarrassment or even maintenance suits 
by their biological children. However, legislation 
can protect a donor parent from maintenance suits 
and the experience of some countries suggests 
that donors are not deterred by the possibility of 
being identified, though numbers may fall ini-
tially. In any event, the law on artificial forms of 
fertilization, as with adoption, should be framed 
to protect the rights and well-being of children, 
not to meet the needs of childless couples. 
The Committee has commented:
“Concerning the right of the child to know 
his or her origins, the Committee notes the 
possible contradiction between this provision 
of the Convention with the policy of the State 
Party in relation to artificial insemination, 
namely in keeping the identity of sperm donors 
secret.” (Norway CRC/C/15/Add.23, para. 10) 
And
“The Committee notes that, according to … 
the law on Medically Assisted Procreation, a 
child can be informed of the identity of his/her 
father only if he/she has a legitimate interest 
and is concerned at the meaning of ‘legitimate 
interest‘ in that regard…
“… the Committee recommends that the State 
Party ensure, as far as possible, respect for 
the child’s right to know his or her parents’ 
identities.” (Switzerland CRC/C/15/Add.182, 
paras. 28 and 29)
“... as far as possible, 
the right to... be cared for 
by his or her parents”
This right must be read in the context of three 
other articles – article 5, which acknowledges, 
alongside the primacy of parents, “the members 
of the extended family or community as pro-
vided for by local custom” (see page 76); article 9, 
which requires that “a child shall not be separated 
from his or her parents against their will, except 
when... such separation is necessary for the best 
interests of the child” (see page 122) and article 
18, which endorses the principle that both parents 
have joint responsibility for caring for their 
children, appropriately supported by the State 
(see page 237). Article 27 (requiring States to 
assist parents in their material responsibilities in 
relation to caring for children) is also relevant.
The right to be “cared for” by both parents 
implies a more active involvement in the child’s 
life by the absent parent than simply paying the 
other parent or the State money to support the 
child (see article 27(4), page 401). It should be 
noted that unlike article 5, which refers to the 
(albeit limited) rights of parents and others, this 
article is framed in terms of the child’s right, not 
the parents’. (At one stage the drafting of this 
article included the proposed formulation “The 
child shall have the right from his birth to know 
and belong to his parents”, but the words “belong 
to” were considered inappropriate in a conven-
tion on children’s rights. [E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 18 
to 22; Detrick, p. 127])
This focus on the child’s right must cast doubt on 
the legitimacy of Luxembourg’s official decla-
ration that it would maintain its law which says: 
“If at the time of conception, the father or mother 
was bound in marriage to another person, the 
natural child may be raised in the conjugal home 
only with the consent of the spouse of his parent.” 
(CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 28)
As with children’s right to know their parents, the 
right to be cared for by parents is qualified by the

words “as far as possible”. The purpose of this 
proviso is in one sense self-evident. It may not be 
possible if the parents are dead or have repudiated 
the child. It also may not be possible when the 
state authorities have judged that parental care is 
not in the child’s best interests because the parents 
are abusive or neglectful (see article 9, page 122). 
However, the onus is on the State to prove this; the 
right upholds a general principle running through 
the Convention – that in ordinary circumstances, 
children are best off with their parents. 
The point at which this right becomes most 
problematic is perhaps when children themselves 
decide that they would rather not be cared for by 
parents, although parents and State do not support 
this. Among the many thousands of homeless chil-
dren in all countries are those who fall into this 
category – children who have, in effect, voted 
with their feet. States need flexible, child-centred 
procedures where runaway children are con-
cerned. Any automatic return of such children to 
parents without investigation of the reasons why 
they ran away and without provision of alternative 
measures of care, for example, is in conflict with 
the provisions and principles of the Convention.

• General measures of implementation
Have appropriate general measures of implementation been taken in relation to article 7, 
including:
■  identification and coordination of the responsible departments and agencies at 
all levels of government (article 7 is relevant to the departments of justice, home 
affairs, social welfare and health)?
■  identification of relevant non-governmental organizations/civil society partners?
■  a comprehensive review to ensure that all legislation, policy and practice is 
compatible with the article, for all children in all parts of the jurisdiction?
adoption of a strategy to secure full implementation 
■  which includes where necessary the identification of goals and indicators of 
progress?
■  which does not affect any provisions which are more conducive to the rights of 
the child? 
■  which recognizes other relevant international standards?
■  which involves where necessary international cooperation?
(Such measures may be part of an overall governmental strategy for implementing 
the Convention as a whole.)
■  budgetary analysis and allocation of necessary resources?
■  development of mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation?
■  making the implications of article 7 widely known to adults and children?
■  development of appropriate training and awareness-raising (in relation to article 7 
likely to include the training of birth registration officers, social workers, adoption 
agency staff and medical personnel)?
• Specific issues in implementing article 7
■  Does domestic law require parents to register children immediately after their birth?
■  Is the duty to register well publicized?
■  Is registration free?
■  Is registration made easy for parents, both in terms of access (for example by 
providing mobile registration units or using schools) and comprehensibility 
(for example by use of minority languages or by training registration staff)?
■  Are all children born within the jurisdiction registered, including those born of 
non-citizens?
■  Where parents fail to register children, is there a duty on the State to secure 
registration?
Does registration include necessary information for the child to claim his or her rights to:
■  a name? 
■  a nationality? 
■  knowledge of parentage?

a Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance in 1992 (resolution 
47/133). In 2006 the General Assembly adopted 
the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which 
also deals with the preservation of these chil-
dren’s identity.
Although article 8 only describes three aspects of 
identity – nationality, name and family relations 
– other articles, such as article 2 (non-discrimina-
tion), article 7 (right to a name and nationality and 
to know and be cared for by parents), article 16 
(protection from arbitrary interference in privacy, 
family and home) and article 30 (right to enjoy 
culture, religion and language), should protect 
against other forms of interference in children’s 
identity. Article 20 also provides that children 
deprived of their family environment should 
where possible have continuity of upbringing, 
particularly with regard to their ethnic, cultural 
and linguistic background. 
■
rticle 8 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child concerns the 
children’s rights to identity and 
their rights to have such identity 
preserved or, where necessary, re-established by 
the State. 
The article was introduced in the Working Group 
drafting the Convention by an Argentinean del-
egate on the grounds that it was necessary to 
secure the speedy intervention of the State when 
the child’s right to preserve his or her identity had 
been violated. Argentina was at the time tack-
ling the disappearance of children and babies, 
which had occurred under the regime of the 
Argentinean junta during the 1970s and 1980s. 
While many such children were killed, a num-
ber had been adopted by childless couples; active 
steps were needed to trace these children and 
establish their true identity (E/CN.4/1986/39, 
pp. 8 to 10; Detrick, pp. 292 to 294). The United 
Nations General Assembly subsequently adopted 
Text of Article 8
1. States Parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity,
including nationality, name and family relations as recognized by law without unlawful 
interference.
2. Where a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, States 
Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to speedily 
re-establishing his or her identity.

Child’s right “to preserve his
or her identity including 
nationality, name and family
relations as recognized by law
without unlawful interference”
The three elements of identity particularly speci-
fied are nationality, name and family relations 
(as recognized by law). 
Nationality 
As discussed in relation to articles 7 and 10, the 
rights of children to nationality are not strong 
under the Convention. The link between national-
ity and their rights to identity is therefore impor-
tant. A child’s “national identity” may derive from 
the nationality of his or her parents, which sug-
gests that any legislation preventing children from 
inheriting the nationality of their parents might not 
be compatible with the Convention – for exam-
ple those States that prohibit dual nationality or 
those States that do not recognize the right of chil-
dren to inherit the nationality of their unmarried 
father. Equally, the child’s “national identity” can 
be acquired through residence as well as through 
parentage, which renders questionable those States 
that do not allow children to acquire full national-
ity from significant periods of residence. And once 
a child has acquired citizenship, removal of this 
may amount to an assault on his or her ‘identity’:
“The Committee is concerned that in some 
instances, children can be deprived of their 
citizenship in situations where one of their 
parents loses his/her citizenship.
“… The Committee… recommends that no 
child be deprived of his/her citizenship on any 
ground, regardless of the status of his/her 
parent(s).” (Australia CRC/C/15/Add.79, 
paras. 14 and 30)
Name 
Some States prohibit children’s names being 
changed by their parents (for example on divorce 
and remarriage), although this tends to be more 
due to respect for fathers’ rights than for chil-
dren’s. It should be noted that most adoption 
law authorizes a change of name (although some 
States require older children’s consent for any 
name change). This topic is also discussed under 
article 7 (see page 102).
Family relations 
The phrase “family relations as recognized by 
law” is unclear. It emerged from a less than 
logical series of amendments in the drafting pro-
cess. The original version from Argentina was 
“the child has the inalienable right to retain his 
true and genuine personal, legal and family iden-
tity”. Some States protested that “family identity” 
had no meaning in their legal codes, and they pro-
posed a change to “family identity as recognized 
by law”; others simultaneously proposed chang-
ing “family identity” to “family relations”. Both 
changes were accepted, although, in fact, it seems 
that “as recognized by law” is inappropriate, 
because Argentina’s original point was that iden-
tity includes more than just legal forms of identity 
(E/CN.4/1986/39, pp. 8 to 10; Detrick, p. 294). 
The phrase does however recognize an important 
principle, which is that a child’s identity means 
more than just knowing who one’s parents are 
(see article 7, page 105). Siblings, grandparents 
and other relatives can be as, or more, impor-
tant to the child’s sense of identity as his or her 
parents are. Most domestic legal instruments 
governing, for example, adoption, fostering or 
divorce arrangements, fail to recognize this fact 
– children may be given legal rights to discover 
who their biological parents are, or to make 
applications for contact with them, but rarely do 
those rights extend to cover other members of the 
child’s biological family.
The concept of “children’s identity” has tended 
to focus on the child’s immediate family, but it 
is increasingly recognized that children have a 
remarkable capacity to embrace multiple relation-
ships. From the secure foundation of an estab-
lished family environment, children can enjoy 
complex and subtle relationships with other adults 
and with a range of cultures, to a much larger 
degree than may be recognized. Thus children’s 
best interests and senses of identity may be sus-
tained without having to deny them knowledge 
of their origins, for example after reception into 
state care, through “secret” adoptions or anony-
mous egg/sperm donations and so forth (see also 
article 7, page 105).
Children who live in a different country from 
that of one or both of their parents may not be 
able to preserve their identity, as expressed by 
their family relations. Those countries that main-
tain long waiting lists for immigrant or emigrant 
children to be granted permission to join their 
parents should ensure that such cases are dealt 
with speedily and with a presumption in favour of 
the child being allowed to join their parents (see 
articles 9, 10 and 22). 
Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions 
provides for the preservation of the identity of 
children who have been displaced or evacu-
ated in time of war. The authorities must provide 
each child with a card to be sent to the Red Cross 
Central Tracing Committee. The card should 
include a photograph and details of the child’s 
name, sex, date and place of birth, name of parents

and next-of-kin, the child’s nationality, native lan-
guage, religion, home and present addresses, any 
identifying marks and health details, and details 
of where the child was found.
Name, nationality and family are only some 
elements of identity. Other aspects of identity 
include: 
• the child’s personal history since birth – 
where he or she lived, who looked after him 
or her, why crucial decisions were taken, etc.
• the child’s race, culture, religion and lan-
guage. An ‘unlawful’ interference in this 
aspect of identity could include
• the suppression of minority languages in 
the education system, state information 
and the media;
• state persecution or proscription of the 
practice of a religion;
• failure to give adopted, fostered or insti-
tutionally placed children the opportunity 
to enjoy their ethnic, cultural, linguistic or 
religious heritage;
• the child’s physical appearance, abilities, 
gender identity and sexual orientation. 
The preservation of some of these aspects of iden-
tity is also upheld in article 20, which provides 
that when children are without families “due 
regard shall be paid to the desirability of continu-
ity in the child’s upbringing and to the child’s eth-
nic, religious, cultural and linguistic background” 
(see page 288) and article 30, which upholds the 
right of children of minority and indigenous com-
munities to enjoy and practice their culture, reli-
gion and language (see page 455).
“Preserve”
The word implies both the non-interference in 
identity and the maintenance of records relating to 
genealogy, birth registration and details relating to 
early infancy that the child could not be expected 
to remember. Some of these are beyond the scope 
of the State, but measures should be taken to 
enforce detailed record-keeping and preservation 
of records (or, in the case of abandoned children, 
preservation of identifying items) where children 
are refugees, abandoned, fostered, adopted or 
taken into the care of the State. Equal care must 
be taken to ensure such records are confidential 
(see article 16, page 209). In a General Discussion 
on “States’ role in preventing and regulating sepa-
ration” the Committee recommended:
“… that all children residing in out-of-home 
care, including the foster families, public 
and private residential institutions and 
care providers, religious care institutions, 
etc. and the children to be placed in such 
care are provided with adequate social 
background investigation and written detailed 
documentation which follows the child 
through the out-of-home care period. These 
multidisciplinary files need to be regularly 
updated and completed during the child’s 
development…” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, Report on the fortieth session, September 
2005, CRC/C/153, para. 680)
The Committee raised concerns with China about 
its failure to provide birth certificates for children 
who were undergoing an international adoption 
process: 
“The Committee is… concerned about the lack 
of explicit guarantees that children without 
birth certificates maintain their right to an 
identity throughout the adoption process…
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party… enact legislative and administrative 
measures to ensure that all children without 
birth certificates are guaranteed their right to 
an identity throughout the adoption process…” 
(China CRC/C/CHN/CO/2, paras. 52 and 53)
It also raised concerns with the Seychelles:
“The Committee is concerned that… children 
of divorced or separated parents may not be 
able to preserve their identity.” 
It recommended that the Seychelles
“… review its legislation to ensure…that all 
children of divorced or separated parents have 
the legal right to maintain their identity.” 
(Seychelles CRC/C/15/Add.189, paras. 30 and 31)
And with Peru, at the time of its Initial Report:
“The Committee is concerned that, due to the 
internal violence, several registration centres 
have been destroyed, adversely affecting the 
situation of thousands of children who are 
often left without any identity document, thus 
running the risk of their being suspected of 
involvement in terrorist activities...
“Special measures should be undertaken to 
provide undocumented children fleeing zones 
affected by internal violence with adequate 
identity documents.” (Peru CRC/C/15/Add.8, 
paras. 8 and 17)
Principle 16 of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 1998 Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement provides 
that “All internally displaced persons have the 
right to know the fate and whereabouts of miss-
ing relatives” and “The authorities concerned 
shall endeavour to establish the fate and where-
abouts of internally displaced persons reported 
missing, and cooperate with relevant interna-
tional organizations engaged in this task. They 
shall inform next of kin on the progress of the 
investigation and notify them of any result.”

Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
116
Principle 20(2) states that “… the authorities 
concerned shall issue to [internally displaced 
persons] all documents necessary for the enjoy-
ment of their legal rights, such as passports, 
personal identification documents, birth cer-
tificates and marriage certificates. In particu-
lar, the authorities shall facilitate the issuance 
of new documents or the replacement of docu-
ments lost in the course of displacement, with-
out imposing unreasonable conditions, such as 
requiring the return to one’s area of habitual res-
idence in order to obtain these or other required 
documents” (see page 311).
Article 9(4) of the Convention requires States to 
inform children and parents of the whereabouts 
of each other if the State has had responsibility 
for their separation (for example through impris-
onment, deportation or death). A right to pres-
ervation of identity also suggests that the law 
should place penalties on those who breach it. 
This certainly is the recommendation of the 1992 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance: “The abduction of chil-
dren of parents subjected to enforced disappear-
ance or of children born during their mother’s 
enforced disappearance, and the act of altering or 
suppressing documents attesting to their true iden-
tity, shall constitute an extremely serious offence, 
which shall be punished as such.” (Article 20)
The new International Convention for the Protec-
tion of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
adopted by the General Assembly in 2006, recog-
nizes the right of victims of disappearance to jus-
tice and reparation, and commits ratifying States 
to criminalizing all forms of enforced disappear-
ance. Article 25 specifically requires measures to 
prevent and punish the wrongful removal of chil-
dren of disappeared persons or the tampering 
with documents giving their true identity. Where 
these children have been adopted, States must 
have legal provisions to annul the adoption if it 
is in the children’s best interests to uphold their 
rights to identity. The Convention stresses that 
the best interests of the child shall be “a primary 
consideration” and the child’s views should be 
given due weight. (It should be noted that, under 
articles 9 and 21 of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the child’s best interests must be par-
amount in such a decision, not merely a primary 
factor.)
“Without unlawful interference” 
This suggests that the child’s right to preservation 
of identity can be lawfully violated – a sugges-
tion questioned by some countries when this art-
icle was being drafted (E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 55 and 
56; Detrick, pp. 295 and 296). Certainly in those 
cases where the State itself is guilty of a harmful 
violation, the provision could appear to be too weak 
since the State also prescribes the laws. However, 
in some instances, the State will have a valid reason 
for interfering with a child’s identity, for example 
when this is necessary for the child’s best interests 
or to protect others.
The right of a child who has 
been “illegally deprived of 
some or all of the elements 
of his or her identity” to be 
provided by the State with 
“appropriate assistance and 
protection with a view to 
speedily re-establishing his or 
her identity”
This right means that the State must recognize 
the seriousness to children of any deprivation of 
their identity by dedicating resources to remedy 
the situation. The Committee noted the steady 
progress being made in Argentina, the State 
that originally proposed the need for article 8:
“The Committee recognizes the work done 
by the National Commission for the Right to 
an Identity to recover children missing during 
the military regime in power from 1976 to 
1983, and notes out of an estimated 500 cases 
of disappearances of children, 73 have been 
found.” (Argentina CRC/C/15/Add.187, para. 34)
And the struggle by Rwanda:
“The Committee takes note of the efforts 
made by the State Party to re-establish 
the identity of a large number of children 
evacuated to different countries during and 
just after the genocide of 1994. However, the 
Committee is concerned that it has not yet 
been possible to identify many children and 
reunite them with their families.” (Rwanda 
CRC/C/15/Add.234, para. 30)
It urged El Salvador to do more in this respect:
“The Committee is concerned that the State 
Party has not taken a more active role in 
efforts to investigate the disappearance of 
more than 700 children during the armed 
conflict between 1980 and 1982.
“In the light of article 8 of the Convention, 
the Committee recommends that the State 
Party assume an active role in efforts to trace 
the children who disappeared during the 
armed conflict, and, in line with the Human 
Rights Committee, encourages the State Party 
to proceed with plans to establish a national 
commission with adequate resources and 
capacity to trace the disappeared children. 
It also encourages the State Party ratify the 
Inter-American Convention on the Forced 
Disappearance of Persons.” (El Salvador 
CRC/C/15/Add.232, paras. 31 and 32)

“Appropriate assistance”
This could include:
• making available genetic profiling to establish 
parentage; 
• actively tracing relatives or community mem-
bers of unaccompanied refugee children;
• using the media to advertise missing children 
and to reunite families;
• ratifying the Hague Convention on the Civil 
Aspects of International Child Abduction, 
and generally ensuring that any child-custody 
cases where an illegal abduction has been 
alleged (including those relating to interna-
tional disputes) are expeditiously dealt with 
at an appropriately senior level in the judi-
ciary, that is, within days or weeks rather than 
months (see article 11, page 144);
• ratifying the Hague Convention on Protection 
of Children and Cooperation in respect of 
Intercountry Adoption, and securing that 
domestic adoption procedures ensure that 
proper consents have been obtained and that 
the child’s birth identity is officially recorded 
before an adoption takes place (see article 21, 
page 296);
• ensuring that any changes to a child’s identity, 
such as name, nationality, parental rights of 
custody, etc., are officially recorded;
• enabling children to have access to the pro-
fessional files maintained on them (see art-
icle 16, page 209). For example the Committee 
welcomed an Australian initiative:
“The Committee notes the national inquiry 
carried out in 1997… which acknowledged 
the past policies whereby indigenous 
persons were deprived of their identity, 
name, culture, language and family. In 
this respect, the Committee welcomes the 
activities undertaken by the State Party 
to assist family reunification and improve 
access to records to help indigenous 
persons trace their families.” (Australia 
CRC/C/15/Add.268, para. 31);
• ensuring that children in state care are encour-
aged to practise their religion, culture and lan-
guage of origin;
• amending nationality laws to allow for a “best 
interests of children” consideration in issues 
relating to deportation or family reunifica-
tion, and speeding up nationality and asylum 
procedures.
The Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 1997, 
advises that appropriate assistance can include 
“legislative measures, including in the civil and 
penal areas – for instance to annul any adoption 
based on an irregular situation, such as the child’s 
abduction, or to penalize such possible offences... 
the establishment of mechanisms to re-establish 
the child’s identity, such as a national data bank 
where changes made in the elements of the iden-
tity of children (including the name, national-
ity and family relations) may be kept and, when 
appropriate, acceded to.” (Manual, pp. 432 and 
433)
In times of war, speedy efforts to reunite par-
ents and children are particularly important. The 
Committee observed to Sierra Leone:
“The Committee is deeply concerned at the 
large numbers of children who have been 
deprived of a family environment through the 
death of, or separation from, their parents or 
other family, and at reports of the difficulties 
and slow progress in tracing separated families 
and children …
“The Committee urges the State Party to 
make every effort to strengthen family 
tracing programmes and also to plan for the 
effective provision of alternative care for 
separated children, with particular focus on 
unaccompanied children living in the streets of 
main towns…” (Sierra Leone CRC/C/15/Add.116, 
paras. 50 and 51)
“Protection” 
This includes securing appropriate temporary 
placement for children while their identity is re-
established. It should also involve explaining to the 
children what is happening and why – ignorance 
and uncertainty can unnecessarily add to chil-
dren’s insecurity and lack of well-being. 
“Speedily re-establishing his or
her identity”
The article emphasizes the particular impor-
tance of speed where children are concerned. 
The “identity” of children is not just a mat-
ter of parentage and culture of origin. As chil-
dren grow they may assume the identity of the 
family or culture in which they live to a point at 
which it would be a second deprivation of iden-
tity to remove them, and therefore unacceptable 
in terms of the child’s best interests. This is a 
particularly bitter fact for parents who have been 
illegally separated from their children, whether 
they were separated by the State or through 
abduction by individuals. (It should be noted 
that Argentina originally proposed the words “In 
particular, this obligation of the State includes 
restoring the child to his blood-relations to be 
brought up”, but this proposal did not find accep-
tance. [E/CN.4/1986/39, pp. 8 to 10; Detrick, 
pp. 292 to 294])

from parents on that ground must be fair. It 
also affirms children’s rights to maintain rela-
tions and contact with both parents, and places 
a duty on the State to inform parent and child 
of the whereabouts of either if the State has 
caused their separation (for example by depor-
tation or imprisonment).
rticle 9 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child enshrines two 
essential principles of children’s 
rights: first, that children should 
not be separated from their parents unless it 
is necessary for their best interests and, sec-
ond, that all procedures to separate children 
Text of Article 9
1. States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents 
against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in 
accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best 
interests of the child. Such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one 
involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents, or one where the parents are living 
separately and a decision must be made as to the child’s place of residence.
2. In any proceedings pursuant to paragraph 1 of the present article, all interested parties 
shall be given an opportunity to participate in the proceedings and make their views known.
3. States Parties shall respect the right of the child who is separated from one or both parents 
to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except 
if it is contrary to the child’s best interests.
4. Where such separation results from any action initiated by a State Party, such as the 
detention, imprisonment, exile, deportation or death (including death arising from any cause 
while the person is in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the child, that 
State Party shall, upon request, provide the parents, the child or, if appropriate, another 
member of the family with the essential information concerning the whereabouts of the 
absent member(s) of the family unless the provision of the information would be detrimental 
to the well-being of the child. States Parties shall further ensure that the submission of such 
a request shall of itself entail no adverse consequences for the person(s) concerned.

Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
122
The basic principles are enshrined in the 1959 
Declaration of the Rights of the Child: “The 
child, for the full and harmonious development of 
his personality, needs love and understanding. He 
shall, wherever possible, grow up in the care and 
under the responsibility of his parents...” (article 
6). These words are echoed and developed in the 
Convention’s preamble: “the child… should grow 
up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of 
happiness, love and understanding.”
The Guidelines for Periodic Reports (Revised 
2005) asks States to provide information on what 
legal or administrative measures there are for 
securing that the best interests and respect for the 
views of children are addressed when separation 
from parents occurs, and for data on the “number 
of children without parental care disaggregated 
by causes (i.e., due to armed conflict, poverty, 
abandonment as a result of discrimination etc.)” 
(CRC/C/58/Rev.1, pp. 6 and 12).
The International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights provides “The family is the natural and 
fundamental group unit of society and is enti-
tled to protection by society and the State” (art-
icle 23(1), which is mirrored by article 10 of the 
International Covenant on Social, Economic and 
Cultural Rights) and: “No one shall be subjected 
to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his pri-
vacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to 
unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. 
Everyone has the right to the protection of the law 
against such interference or attacks” (article 17(1) 
and (2)). 
■
The child’s right “not to be 
separated from parents against 
their will, except when judged 
... necessary for the child’s best 
interests”
The words “against their will” refer either to the 
parents’ will or to the parents’ and child’s will 
together; the grammar makes clear that it does 
not mean the child’s will alone. And, in one sense, 
the right of children to parental care is inevitably 
subject to the “will” of parents. Infants have no 
power or ability to choose their caregivers. They 
are dependent on their family, community and 
the State to make that choice for them. Moreover, 
even if young children were in a position to 
“choose” their parents, they could not force them 
to act as parents against their will. The State can 
seek to force parents to financially maintain their 
children, but it cannot compel parents to care for 
them appropriately.
Although States cannot be responsible if sepa-
ration from parents is caused by divorce, the 
Committee has suggested that research and 
awareness-campaigns on the effect of divorce on 
children should be supported, as well as counsel-
ling for parents:
“The Committee is concerned at the high rate 
of divorce – considered among the highest in 
the world – in the State Party and its possible 
negative impact on children. The Committee 
is also concerned at the lack of research and 
studies on the harmful consequences on 
children of divorces and early marriages as 
well as the insufficient measures to create 
public awareness on the detrimental effects of 
divorce. 
“… The Committee… recommends that the 
State Party undertake research and studies 
on the negative impact of family disruption 
on children as well as to continue with its 
awareness-raising on this issue. Furthermore, 
the Committee recommends to the State Party 
to improve counselling services for parents.” 
(Maldives CRC/C/15/Add.91, paras. 17 and 37)
The article gives two examples of when it may be 
necessary to separate children from one or both 
parents: first, when the parents have abused or 
neglected the child and, second, when parents 
live apart. A third example was suggested by the 
United States of America representative during 
the drafting of the Convention: “where there is 
a disagreement between parent(s) and child as to 
the child’s place of residence” (E/1982/12/Add.1, 
C, pp. 49 to 55; Detrick, p. 168). This suggestion 
was dropped on the grounds that an exhaustive 
list of reasons should not be attempted. The two 
examples are simply illustrations of cases when 
separation from parents may occur. 
However, the third example given by the United 
States of America does raise a profound diffi-
culty for some children – when parents agree 
between themselves where the child should live, 
or how parental access should be organized, but 
when the child is unhappy with the arrangement. 
Few States make provision for the child in such 
circumstances, arguing that the State should 
not interfere in the private arrangements of par-
ents. But if the State accepts that it has a role as 
arbitrator when there are disputes between hus-
band and wife, then it should accept its role as 
arbitrator when there is dispute between parent 
and child – at least to the extent of establishing 
judicial machinery for the child to make a case 
for arbitration. Children may have good rea-
sons for not wishing to live with parents. When 
the Committee raised the “increasing number of 
street children” with the Russian Federation, it 
recommended that the State Party:
“… Promote and facilitate the reunification 
of street children with their parents and other 
–> Table of Contents

e
relatives or provide alternative care, taking 
into account the children’s own views…” 
(Russian Federation CRC/C/RUS/CO/3, para. 75)
On the other hand, children may want to live with 
parents even when the State thinks they are inad-
equate:
“The Committee notes that children are often 
placed in alternative care without their views 
being adequately taken into account, and 
it is concerned that they authorities do not 
always adequately support the maintenance of 
fundamental parent-child links…
“The Committee… recommends that the 
State Party sufficiently take into account 
children’s views in any decision regarding their 
placement in alternative care. Furthermore, it 
recommends that the parent-child relationship 
not be negatively affected by placement in 
alternative care.” (Finland CRC/C/15/Add 272, 
paras. 28 and 30)
Other aspects of “unnecessary” separation from 
parents include:
State care. Article 20, on alternatives to fam-
ily life, provides for those children who will have 
to be temporarily or permanently deprived of 
their family environment if that is in their best 
interests. Some States adopt more prescriptive 
criteria than others for determining what the 
best interests of children are. Where laws spe-
cify grounds for state care, they must be exam-
ined carefully for discriminatory application. For 
example, homelessness or poverty of the parents 
should not be grounds in themselves for removal 
of the child, nor should a parent’s failure to send 
the child to school. If these deficiencies are caus-
ing the child’s development to be impaired, then 
the State should put its resources into making 
good the deficiency while maintaining the child 
in the family. For example, the Committee told 
Nepal that it must abolish its legal provision 
allowing the poverty of parents as a legal ground 
for adoption (Nepal CRC/C/15/Add.261, para. 
54), and has noted with concern that a number 
of countries have children in state care because 
of the family’s poverty, such as Azerbaijan and 
Hungary:
“The Committee is concerned about the 
insufficient support for disadvantaged families 
and the fact that, as a result, children are often 
unnecessarily separated from their parents… 
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party provide adequate support to 
disadvantaged families, including counselling 
and educational services, and ensure that 
separation of children from their parents only 
takes place if necessary, in their best interest 
and on precise legal grounds.” (Azerbaijan 
CRC/C/AZE/CO/2, paras. 37 and 38)
“The Committee is concerned about the high 
rate of children placed in alternative care, 
often for financial reasons, many of them for 
a long period of time, including very young 
children and children with disabilities… The 
Committee is also very concerned that not 
enough efforts are made to return children 
to their families as soon as possible.” (Hungary 
CRC/C/HUN/CO/2, para. 30)
Article 23 of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, adopted by the General 
Assembly in December 2006, repeats the pro-
visions at the beginning of article 9(1) of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, adding: 
“In no case shall a child be separated from par-
ents on the basis of a disability of either the child 
or one or both of the parents.” And to prevent 
“concealment, abandonment, neglect and segre-
gation of children with disabilities” States must 
“undertake to provide early and comprehensive 
information, services and support to children 
with disabilities and their families.”
The Committee was also concerned at the 
number of Roma children in European institu-
tions. Disproportionate numbers of children from 
ethnic minorities in care may suggest discrimi-
nation either in professional attitudes or family-
support services. Gender may also be a factor, as 
was raised with Saint Kitts and Nevis: 
“… It is recommended that the State Party 
undertake a study to assess the situation of 
boys within the family environment and their 
susceptibility to placement in alternative and/
or foster care.” (Saint Kitts and Nevis CRC/C/15/
Add.104, para. 23)
Failure to keep children in contact with their par-
ents may occur when the State makes arrang-
ments for them to live away from home, for 
example in institutions, specialist schools, street 
children projects, foster care, “simple adoption”, 
etc. The loss of contact may be convenient to the 
caregiver, particularly when the child’s parents 
appear to be hostile, disruptive or irrelevant to the 
child’s progress; arguments are sometimes raised 
that the child needs to “settle in” or that see-
ing parents upsets the child. However, evidence 
strongly suggests that children are less likely to 
be reunited with their parents if contact is not 
maintained with them during the early months of 
alternative care. Planning of placements should 
secure that contact can be easily maintained by 
the parents, who may be unable to travel dis-
tances or visit at set times. The Committee raised 
such concerns with the Czech Republic:
“... the Committee is concerned that… children 
are often placed at significant distances from 
parents, who, in turn, may not be aware of 
–> Table of Contents

their visiting rights; punitive measures such 
as limitation of phone calls or meetings with 
parents may also be used… Contacts with 
parents are sometimes made conditional upon 
the behaviour of children in care.” (Czech 
Republic CRC/C/15/Add.201, para. 44)
It urged Poland to:
“… Upgrade the capacity and skills of social 
workers so that they are better able to 
intervene and assist children in their own 
environment.” (Poland CRC/C/15/Add.194, 
para. 37)
Abandoned, runaway or unaccompanied 
children living or working on the streets. 
Parents in extreme circumstances of poverty, 
violence or armed conflict may abandon their 
children, or children and parents may simply lose 
contact with each other as a result of the pressure 
of such events; sometimes children leave home 
for the streets because of violence or exploitation 
by their parents. The result is that most large cit-
ies in the world contain populations of children 
living independently of their families. State pro-
vision for these children should always give them 
an opportunity of finding and being reunited with 
their parents and family. For some this may not 
be possible, but others will have their rights under 
article 9 breached by assumptions that they are 
best provided for away from their original fam-
ily. The Committee has encouraged state efforts 
in tracing these families:
“… concern is expressed, inter alia, at reports 
regarding difficulties and slow progress in 
tracing separated families and children… 
“The Committee urges the State Party to 
make every effort to strengthen family tracing 
programmes…” (Colombia CRC/C/15/Add.137, 
paras. 40 and 42)
For further discussion of children on the streets, see 
articles 2 and 20 (pages 30 and 286), and of tracing 
programmes, see article 8 (pages 114 et seq.).
Children in hospitals. Parents may not be 
allowed to visit or, where appropriate, remain 
with their children in hospital. Again, this form 
of separation, more common in industrialized 
than developing countries, is maintained primar-
ily for the convenience of the staff, although the 
medical needs of the child patient may be cited. 
In fact, it is now generally recognized that chil-
dren’s recovery is greatly aided by having parents 
with them in hospital. Though hospital practice 
is usually controlled by medical staff and hospi-
tal managers, the State has a role in encouraging 
child-friendly hospitals. The Committee raised 
this matter with Croatia:
“The Committee is … concerned about the 
information that mothers are not allowed to 
stay with their hospitalized children free of 
charge unless the child is less than 6 months of 
age… 
“The Committee… recommends that children 
not be separated from their parents when they 
are hospitalized.” (Croatia CRC/C/15/Add.243, 
paras. 51 and 52)
Parents in prisons. The imprisonment of par-
ents, particularly of mothers of dependent young 
children, is deeply problematic, because the child 
is being punished along with the parent. While it 
is argued that the punishment of offenders always 
has repercussions for innocent relatives, where 
children are concerned the effects can be par-
ticularly catastrophic to them and costly to the 
State, both immediately, in terms of providing 
for the children’s care, and long term, in terms of 
the social problems arising from early separation. 
One solution is to accommodate young infants 
together with their mothers in prison; the other 
is to find more constructive, non-custodial sanc-
tions. Where possible, the latter course should 
be adopted. It is arguable that article 3(1) of the 
Convention requires courts when sentencing par-
ents to consider the best interests of affected chil-
dren as “a primary consideration”.
Although babies tend to be unconcerned about 
where they live so long as they are with their 
mothers, difficulties may arise about when and if 
to separate mother and child as the child grows 
older. The Committee has voiced concerns both 
about accommodating children together with their 
parents in prison and failures to keep imprisoned 
parents and children in contact with each other, 
as, for example, shown its comments to Nepal:
“The Committee is concerned about the 
significant number of children who are living 
in adult prisons with their parents, often in 
poor conditions that fall short of international 
standards… 
“The Committee recommends to the State 
Party that it review the current practice of 
children living with their parents in prison, 
with a view to limiting the stay to instances 
in which it is in his/her best interest, and 
to ensuring that the living conditions are 
suitable for his/her needs for the harmonious 
development of his/her personality. The 
Committee also recommends that children 
of parents in prison should be provided with 
adequate alternative care, for instance, within 
the extended family and be allowed regular 
contact with their parents.” (Nepal CRC/C/15/
Add.261, paras. 51 and 52)
It recommends a systematic approach:
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party develop and implement clear guidelines 
on the placement of children with their parent 
in prison (e.g. the age of the children, the

length of stay, contact with the outside world 
and movement in and outside the prison) in 
instances where this is considered to be in 
the best interests of the child, and ensure 
that the living conditions, including health 
care, in prisons are adequate for the child’s 
development, as required by article 27 of the 
Convention. It further recommends that the 
State Party develop and implement adequate 
alternative care for children who are removed 
from prison, and such care is regularly 
supervised and allows the child to maintain 
personal relations and direct contact with its 
parent remaining in prison.” (Mexico 
CRC/C/MEX/CO/3, para. 40)
Article 2(2) protects children against “all forms 
of discrimination or punishment on the basis of 
the status, activities... of the child’s parents, legal 
guardians or family members” (see page 30). 
Although mothers have been singled out as being 
particularly crucial to the development of young 
children, States should recognize that the impris-
onment of fathers can also be very detrimental, 
depriving children of important role models and 
often causing the family to become impoverished.
Child offenders. Removal of offending children 
from their families may be necessary in the best 
interests of the child, for example where judicial 
authorities are satisfied that the parents have con-
tributed to their child’s criminality. However, care 
orders removing parental rights should not be a 
part of the sentencing tariff for juvenile offending 
and should only occur when this is in the child’s 
best interests. Rule 18(2) of the United Nations 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration 
of Juvenile Justice, the “Beijing Rules”, states: 
“No juvenile shall be removed from parental 
supervision, whether partly or entirely, unless 
the circumstances of his or her case make this 
necessary.” As regards the imprisonment of chil-
dren for offending, and their consequent separa-
tion from families, this should only occur as a 
last resort and in their best interests, as discussed 
under article 37 (see page 556). 
Parents working abroad. Across the world 
fathers, and increasingly mothers too, are forced 
to leave their children behind when they seek 
employment abroad. On Sri Lanka’s Initial Report 
the Committee expressed concern about
“… the situation of children whose mothers 
are working abroad, especially in Gulf 
countries, leaving their children behind. Those 
children (between 200,000 and 300,000) 
often live in difficult circumstances and may 
be subjected to different types of abuse or 
exploitation.” 
Its proposed solution was not, as might have 
been expected, to recommend improvements to 
Sri Lankan services for these motherless chil-
dren, but, in keeping with article 9:
“To avoid the abandonment of children by 
mothers working abroad, the Committee 
suggests that the State Party engage in 
dialogue with receiving countries to ensure 
an international agreement that permits 
migrant workers to take their children abroad. 
Ratification of the International Convention 
on the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families should be 
considered.” (Sri Lanka CRC/C/15/Add.40, 
paras. 16 and 33)
When Sri Lanka made its Second Report, the 
Committee noted a new programme for children 
of migrant workers, 
“… yet it is concerned that families of migrant 
workers receive little or no assistance with 
their child-rearing responsibilities while they 
are working abroad… 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party develop a comprehensive policy to 
support the families and caregivers of children 
of migrant workers in their child-rearing 
responsibilities.” (Sri Lanka CRC/C/15/Add.207, 
paras. 30 and 31)
The Committee was similarly concerned about 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where 
“the difficult domestic employment situation 
has obliged many parents, and sometimes 
both parents, to migrate, leaving children 
in the care of grandparents or under the 
responsibility of an older child,”
and recommended that:
“… the State Party… make every effort to 
provide support to children within the context 
of the family and consider, inter alia, means of 
improving employment prospects within the 
State Party for parents.” (Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines CRC/C/15/Add.184, paras. 30 and 31)
Immigration and deportation. Article 10 
deals with the limited rights of children to fam-
ily reunification when they or their parents are 
(or wish to be) in different countries. When art-
icles 9 and 10 were being drafted the chairman 
of the Working Group drafting the Convention 
made a declaration: “It is the understanding of 
the Working Group that article 6 [now article 9] 
of this Convention is intended to apply to sepa-
rations that arise in domestic situations, whereas 
article 6 bis [now article 10] is intended to apply 
to separations involving different countries and 
relating to cases of family reunification. Article 
6 bis [now 10] is not intended to affect the gen-
eral right of States to establish and regulate their 
respective immigration laws in accordance with 
their international obligations.” The Chairman’s 
declaration caused some concern. Three State 
representatives in the Working Group responded 
–> Table of Contents

r

c
l

126
by emphasizing that “international obligations” 
included principles recognized by the interna-
tional community, particularly human rights and 
children’s rights principles – including, of course, 
the principles of article 9. The representative of 
the Federal Republic of Germany “reserved the 
right to declare that silence in the face of the 
chairman’s declaration did not mean agreement 
with it” (E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 32 to 37; Detrick, 
pp. 181 and 182). 
Such a declaration is, in any event, no more than 
a clarification of drafting intentions: though 
influential it does not carry legal force. The dec-
laration was cited by Canada during one of that 
country’s oral sessions with the Committee. A 
Committee member commented in relation to the 
issues of immigration control and deportation: 
“Under article 9, States Parties should ensure 
that there would be no separation unless it was 
in the best interests of the child concerned and 
determined by competent authorities subject to 
judicial review. Concern had been expressed at 
how a child’s best interests were taken into con-
sideration when decisions to deport parents were 
made. Were family values taken into account by 
decision-makers? Article 9 also referred to the 
need for judicial proceedings to give all interested 
parties the right and opportunity to be heard. It 
was unclear when and how a child could make his 
or her views known and with what legal support. 
Article 12, paragraph 2, established the right of 
children to be heard in any administrative and 
judicial proceedings.” (Canada CRC/C/SR.216, 
para. 28)
The 
Canadian 
representative 
argued 
that: 
“International law did not provide an express 
right to family reunification nor did the 
Convention recognize family reunification as an 
express right... One issue of concern discussed in 
the United Nations Working Group on the draft 
convention in December 1988 had been whether 
the provision in article 9 concerning non-separa-
tion from parents would require States to amend 
their immigration laws to avoid the separation of 
children from their parents. The Working Group 
had requested that a statement should be included 
in the report on its deliberations to indicate that 
article 10 on family reunification was the govern-
ing matter on that issue. It had been the Working 
Group’s understanding that article 10 was not 
intended to affect the general right of States to 
establish and regulate their respective immigra-
tion laws in accordance with their international 
obligations.” However, he did concede that inter-
national treaties clearly recognized “the vital 
importance of family reunification”. (Canada 
CRC/C/SR.216, paras. 47 and 55)
Despite this discussion, the Committee mem-
ber expressed the view that provisions on family 
reunification under article 10 should be seen in 
the light of article 9 (Canada CRC/C/SR.216, 
para. 84). The subject was not addressed when 
Canada submitted its Second Report. 
Other aspects of immigration have been raised 
with other countries:
“The Committee remains concerned that… 
the national requirements and procedures for 
family reunification for refugee families, as 
defined under the Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees of 1951, are complex and 
too long… 
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party take all necessary measures… to 
ease family reunification requirements and 
procedures.” (Germany CRC/C/15/Add.226, 
paras. 54 and 55)
“The Committee is concerned that the best 
interests of the child are not adequately taken 
into consideration in cases where foreign 
nationals who have children in Norway are 
permanently deported as a consequence of 
having committed a serious criminal offence… 
“The Committee urges the State Party to 
ensure that the best interests of the child 
are a primary consideration in the decisions 
taken regarding deportation of their parents.” 
(Norway CRC/C/15/Add.263, paras. 21 and 22)
“The Committee is deeply concerned that the 
existing quotas for persons entering the Hong 
Kong and Macau SARs [Special Administrative 
Regions] from the mainland and regulations 
regarding the right of abode in the SARs 
contribute to the separation of children from 
their parents and hinder family reunification.” 
(China CRC/C/CHN/CO/2, para. 50)
Japan made a declaration on deportations, about 
which the Committee expressed concern: “The 
Government of Japan declares that paragraph 1 
of article 9 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child be interpreted not to apply to a case 
where a child is separated from his or her parents 
as a result of deportation in accordance with its 
immigration law.” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 26; Japan 
CRC/C/15/Add.90, para. 6)
Armed conflict. The separation of parents and 
children may arise during armed conflict (article 
38) or when they have become refugees (article 
22). The consequences of civil war or economic 
breakdown can be devastating to the family unit. 
Sometimes the state government can do little 
about the upheavals caused by armed conflict, but 
if the reins of power are in its hands, it has clear 
obligations towards children, as the Committee 
informed Myanmar on its Initial Report:
–> Table of Contents

“While welcoming the recent peace 
agreements between the Government and a 
great majority of rebel armed groups in the 
country, the Committee strongly recommends 
the State Party to prevent any occurrence of 
forced relocation, displacement and other 
types of involuntary population movements 
which deeply affect families and the rights 
of children. The Committee also recommends 
that the State Party reinforce its central 
tracing agency to favour family reunification.” 
(Myanmar CRC/C/15/Add.69, para. 40)
On Myanmar’s Second Report the Committee 
continued to express deep concern about impact 
of war on family life, particularly the “disinte-
gration” of families from ethnic minorities iand 
the conscription of child soldiers by both sides 
(Myanmar CRC/C/15/Add.237, paras. 42 and 66).
Similar concerns were raised with Nepal, which 
was recommended
“… to undertake effective measures for 
the reunification of separated families, 
by implementing programmes for the 
reinforcement of existing structures such as 
the extended family…” (Nepal CRC/15/Add.261, 
para. 50)
Traditions or customs. The separation of chil-
dren and parents because of custom perhaps most 
commonly occurs when a child is conceived out 
of wedlock. In the past, many mothers might 
abandon such children or would be forced to give 
them up for adoption. This cultural pressure still 
persists in some parts of the world – for example, 
the Committee said to Sri Lanka:
“... The Committee also encourages the 
authorities to give full support to mothers of 
children born out of wedlock wishing to keep 
their child.” (Sri Lanka CRC/C/15/Add.40, para. 34)
Custom may also affect the decisions that have to 
be made about where children live and how much 
contact they have with the non-resident parent fol-
lowing parental separation. Such decisions ought 
to be determined solely in accordance with the 
child’s best interests but sometimes are subject to 
tradition or religious doctrine – for example that 
adulterous parents forfeit rights of access to chil-
dren or that children must live with the paternal 
family upon the death of the father. Under art-
icles 18 children have the right to be cared for by 
both parents, who share common responsibility 
for their upbringing, development and best inter-
ests. Decisions which automatically allocate these 
responsibilities are contrary to the Convention if 
they are made without reference to the needs and 
interests of the individual child concerned (see 
below, and article 18, page 235, for further dis-
cussion).
The child’s right to have any 
decision that separation from 
his or her parents is in his or 
her best interests to:
• be undertaken by competent
authorities;
• be subject to judicial review;
• be in accordance with applic-
able law and procedures; 
• give all interested parties
the opportunity to participate 
and make their views known
Removal of children from their parents without 
justification is one of the gravest violations of 
rights the State can perpetrate against children. 
At the same time, the State has a responsibility to 
protect children from parental harm. For this rea-
son, the Convention requires that such actions be 
governed by clear and just procedures, as speci-
fied in article 9. The Committee is alert to States 
having too casual an approach to parent-child 
separation, for example, raising concerns with 
Lithuania about the large numbers of children 
removed from parental care, recommending
“… that the State Party take all possible 
measures, including establishment of precise 
criteria for the limitation of parental rights, 
in order adequately to protect parental 
rights and the parent-child relationship and 
thereby ensure that a child is not separated 
from his or her parents against their will 
except when competent authorities subject 
to judicial review determined, in accordance 
with applicable law and procedures, that 
such separation is necessary for the best 
interests of the child. The Committee also 
recommends that the State Party take all 
necessary measures to ensure that both 
parents and children are given an opportunity 
to participate in the proceedings and make 
their views known in accordance with article 9 
of the Convention.” (Lithuania CRC/C/LTU/CO/2, 
para. 40)
“Competent authorities” 
The word “competent” relates to an authorized 
position rather than to ability; nonetheless such 
authorities must have skills to determine, on the 
basis of the evidence, what is in the child’s best 
interests. Such skills could be acquired through 
formal training (for example, in psychology, 
social work or children’s legal casework) or an 
equivalent weight of experience (for example, 
through being a community or religious arbitra-
tor). The Committee was concerned about the 
situation in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, 
where “only the police and not the social ser-
vices have the authority to remove a child from 
–> Table of Contents

a
r
t
i
c
l
e
Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
128
a family situation in which the child is suffering 
abuse or neglect” noting that “this may add to the 
trauma suffered by the child.” It recommended 
that social services be given the necessary legal 
authority to remove children (Saint Vincent and 
the Grenadines CRC/C/15/Add.184, paras. 38 
and 39). On the other hand, the Committee has 
expressed concern to other countries about the 
adequacy of social workers’ training and profes-
sional conduct, for example to Slovenia:
“The Committee appreciates the work and 
the role of Social Work Centres in providing 
administrative and other types of assistance to 
children and families, but is concerned at the 
lack of appropriate and effective measures to 
strengthen professional capacities of the staff 
of these centres, as well as the often lengthy 
procedures applied.”
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take all necessary steps to provide 
ongoing training to the staff of Social 
Work Centres and provide for efficient 
administrative, legal and practical measures to 
ensure quality and efficiency of all activities of 
these institutions.” (Slovenia CRC/C/15/Add.230, 
paras. 30 and 31)
The State should be able to demonstrate that the 
competent authorities are genuinely able to give 
paramount consideration to the child’s best inter-
ests, which presupposes a degree of flexibility 
in this decision-making. Any inflexible dogma 
defining “best interests”, for example stating 
that children ought to be with their fathers or 
mothers, should be regarded as potentially dis-
criminatory and in breach of the Convention. 
It is true to say that article 6 of the Declaration 
of the Rights of the Child, the precursor of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, did make 
a statement in favour of keeping, save in excep-
tional circumstances, children of “tender years” 
with their mothers. However, this bias towards 
giving mothers custody young children, though 
common in many countries and an important 
protection in very patriarchal societies, does 
not find expression in the Convention. The 
Committee expressed this view to a number of 
Muslim countries who award custody of young 
children to mothers and older children to fathers, 
for example Pakistan:
“The Committee is concerned that the State 
Party’s legislation uses age limits, instead 
of the best interests of the child, as criteria 
in determining custody in cases of divorce. 
Such permission, in addition to implying 
that siblings can be separated, discriminates 
between the sexes and fails to acknowledge 
the child’s right to express her/his views and 
have them taken into account.” (Pakistan 
CRC/C/15/Add.217, para. 44)
“Subject to judicial review”
The phrase carries with it expectations about the 
principles of natural justice and fair hearings. 
These principles include that:
• the judges or arbitrators have no personal 
interest in the case;
• they are as well informed as possible about all 
the circumstances of the case; 
• they provide reasons for their rulings; 
• all parties are heard; and 
• all parties hear the evidence (if necessary 
through the provision of interpretation). 
While this part of article 9 was being drafted, 
country representatives repeatedly emphasized 
the need to expedite the judicial process so that 
the “separation period should be made as short as 
possible under national legislation” (E/1982/12/
Add.1, C, pp. 49 to 55; Detrick, p. 168). Although 
the need for speed is not explicitly mentioned in 
the article, it should be assumed to be a neces-
sary component of any judicial review in order 
to secure compliance with article 8(2) (duty to 
“speedily” re-establish child’s identity, including 
family ties). The Committee noted “the very long 
duration of custodial disputes in Finland, which 
may have a negative impact on children” (Finland 
CRC/C/15/Add.272, para. 26).
The article makes no mention of privacy of 
the proceedings. However article 14(1) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights provides that the public may be excluded 
from judicial hearings “when the interest of 
the private lives of the parties so requires” 
and that judgements of hearings should gener-
ally be made public “except where the interest 
of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the 
proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or 
the guardianship of children”. Article 3 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, relat-
ing to the best interests of the child and article 
16 (right to privacy) suggest an assumption that 
judicial hearings under article 9 should be held 
in private. 
In addition rule 3(2) of the United Nations 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration 
of Juvenile Justice, the “Beijing Rules”, extends 
the Rules’ scope to care and welfare proceedings: 
“Efforts shall be made to extend the principles 
embodied in the Rules to all juveniles who are 
dealt with in welfare and care proceedings.” The 
“Beijing Rules” calls for fair hearings with suf-
ficient flexibility to respond to the varying spe-
cial needs of the children concerned, conducted 
“in an atmosphere of understanding”. The Rules

stresses the need for privacy, speed, the child’s 
rights to representation and to the presence of 
parents, appeal procedures, powers to discontinue 
proceedings, good record keeping and research-
based policy.
Some countries entered reservations to article 9 
on the grounds that their social work authorities 
had powers to take children into care without a 
court hearing or judicial review. This is not com-
patible with the rights of the child. For example, 
the inclusion of care and welfare proceedings in 
the “Beijing Rules” stresses the point that remov-
ing children from their parents is as serious a 
step as depriving them of their liberty, and mer-
its a fair hearing conducted under the rules of 
natural justice. The Committee has systemati-
cally encouraged the withdrawal of all such res-
ervations. Not only should such hearings operate 
under due process, the courts should be special-
ized and well-funded, as the Committee recom-
mended to Nicaragua:
“… that the State Party… establish specialized 
family courts with trained judges and other 
professionals involved, and ensure that family 
law practice is accessible to everybody and that 
family law procedures are conducted without 
undue delay.” (Nicaragua CRC/C/15/Add.265, 
para. 37) 
And, expressing its deep concern to Lebanon 
“… at the large number of children placed in 
institutions… without judicial procedure”,
it recommended that the State Party
“… take effective measures to implement fully 
the legislation relating to alternative care of 
children to ensure that a child is not separated 
from his or her parents against its will, except 
when competent authorities subject to judicial 
review and procedures determine that such 
separation is necessary for the best interests of 
the child.” (Lebanon CRC/C/15/Add.169, paras. 36 
and 37)
“In accordance with applicable law 
and procedures” 
These words again stress the need for legislation 
governing any procedure where the child is sepa-
rated from parents against their will, whether it is 
the State intervening to remove the child or one 
of the parents seeking custody of the child. 
If, however, laws leave criteria for separation 
open to judicial discretion so that it is entirely up 
to the judge to decide what is in the best interests 
of the child, then the State must be satisfied that 
judges exercise this discretion objectively. 
“... all interested parties shall be 
given an opportunity to participate 
in the proceedings and make their 
views known” 
This aspect of a proper judicial review – the need 
to hear from all relevant parties – is given special 
emphasis within the Convention for good reasons. 
It reminds States that both parents must be heard, 
even when one parent has not had primary care of 
the child (for example in a case of child neglect 
by the child’s mother, even a non-resident father 
of the child should be given an opportunity to 
show he is able and willing to look after the child) 
or when one parent is out of the country. It also 
enables other “interested parties” to participate 
in the proceedings – for example members of the 
child’s extended family, or professionals with spe-
cialist knowledge of the child. “Interested parties” 
is undefined within the Convention, so that inter-
pretation is left to domestic law or the judge of the 
case; however, it should be assumed that the wid-
est possible interpretation is needed, since a sound 
decision on best interests of the child is dependent 
on having the fullest possible information. 
The child, in particular, should not be forgotten. 
He or she is clearly the most “interested party” 
involved in the case. Article 12(2) provides that 
children specifically be given opportunities to be 
heard directly or through a representative “in any 
judicial and administrative proceedings affect-
ing the child”. Proceedings under article 9 clearly 
affect the child. Article 12(2) does not specify 
when the child should be heard directly and when 
through a representative, but given the general 
right under 12(1) for children to “express those 
views freely in all matters affecting the child”, it 
should be assumed that wherever children wish 
to speak directly to the adjudicators, this should 
be arranged, but that, in addition, where chil-
dren are not able to represent their views ade-
quately (through incapacity or because they need 
an advocate in an adversarial system), appro-
priate arrangements should be made. However 
States must recognize that appointing a person 
to represent the child’s best interests is not the 
same as children being given “an opportunity to 
... make their views known” (article 9(2)) or “to 
be heard” (article 12(2)). Professional opinion as 
to the child’s best interests may sometimes con-
flict with the child’s own view of what is best. In 
such circumstances, States are obliged under the 
Convention to ensure that the child’s views are 
also heard. 
The Committee congratulated Sweden on its 
“remarkable efforts” to ensure children’s views 
are heard, but nonetheless remained concerned 
that “some children and young persons do not 
feel they have any real influence in matters

concerning their life in society”. It recommended 
that Sweden
“… Ensure that administrative or other 
decisions relevant to children contain 
information on how the views of the children 
were solicited, on the degree to which the 
views of children were adopted and why… 
[and] … consider providing children in very 
conflicting custody and visitation disputes with 
appropriate assistance.” (Sweden CRC/C/15/
Add.248, paras. 23 and 24)
The Committee also expressed concern to Haiti 
“… at the high number of children who are 
separated from their parents… [and] … at 
the fact that the views of the child are not 
taken into consideration when such decision is 
taken.”
It recommended that 
“… child is given an opportunity to participate 
in the proceedings and that he or she can 
make his or her views known.” (Haiti CRC/C/15/
Add.202, paras. 38 and 39)
States sometimes specify an age at which 
children themselves can determine decisions 
about custody and access (that is, residence and 
contact), usually with a caveat that the child’s 
decision can be overridden in exceptional cir-
cumstances if the child’s welfare might actively 
be harmed by his or her choice. The age appears 
to range from 7 to 16. Such provisions are not 
contrary to the Convention. However, provisions 
that specify an age at which the child’s views 
should be taken into account are questionable, 
since the expressed views of children of all ages 
should be considered under article 12 (see page 
149).
The child’s right “to maintain 
personal relations and direct 
contact with both parents on a 
regular basis” unless contrary 
to best interests
This right reflects the principle of article 18 that 
“both parents have common responsibilities for 
the upbringing and development of the child” (see 
page 235). States vary as to the care they take in 
protecting this right of children. The Republic of 
Korea entered a reservation to article 9(3), but 
told the Committee that it was considering with-
drawing the reservation (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 36; 
Republic of Korea CRC/C/SR.276, para. 14). The 
Committee nonetheless informed the Republic of 
Korea that this reservation raised questions about 
its 
“...compatibility with the principles and 
provisions of the Convention, including the 
principles of the best interests of the child and 
respect for the views of the child.“ (Republic of 
Korea CRC/C/15/Add.51, para. 8)
On its Second Report, the Republic of Korea was 
encouraged
“… to expedite the process of reforming the 
Civil Act so that both children and parents 
are guaranteed the right to maintain contact 
with each other…” (Republic of Korea CRC/C/15/
Add.197, para. 10)
Too often, children lose the chance to maintain 
contact with the non-residential parent because of 
the needs of the residential parent (for example to 
live at a distance from the other parent) or because 
of the parents’ acrimonious relationship. The 
Committee raised its concerns in this respect with 
Antigua and Barbuda and with Liechtenstein:
“The Committee is concerned that currently, 
no legal provisions exist to protect the right of 
a separated parent and/or child to remain in 
contact with each other.
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party review existing legislation to 
ensure adequate protection of the right of 
a separated parent and/or child, with due 
consideration given to the best interests of the 
child.” (Antigua and Barbuda CRC/C/15/Add.247, 
paras. 39 and 40)
“The Committee is concerned that the 
father of a child born out of wedlock has no 
standing to claim custody and that custody is 
automatically given to the mother… 
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party amend its legislation to provide 
fathers the opportunity to request custody 
of their children born out of wedlock, where 
possible as a joint custody with the mother.” 
(Liechtenstein CRC/C/LIE/CO/2, paras. 18 and 19)
Courts may correctly refuse to enforce access if 
this is likely to have adverse consequences for the 
child. But while legislation often decrees that the 
child’s best interests shall be paramount in such 
decisions, the law does not always make clear 
that these best interests are generally interpreted 
as meaning regular contact with both parents. 
Moreover, States could often put more resources 
into providing practical assistance to children 
whose parents are in conflict, for example by pro-
viding neutral meeting places or the supervision 
of access. 
The right of family members, 
and specifically parents and
children, to be given on 
request the essential informa-
tion concerning the where-
abouts of a parent or child who

has been separated because of
an action initiated by the State
(for example, detention, 
imprisonment, exile or death
from any cause in custody), 
unless the provision of infor-
mation would be detrimental 
to the well-being of the child
A failure to ensure that parents are told where 
their children have been detained, or that chil-
dren are told of the whereabouts of their parents, 
seems to be an obvious abuse of human rights 
and reflects international rules regarding the 
treatment of prisoners (see article 40, page 601). 
Circumstances in which provision of information 
would be detrimental to the child are likely to be 
rare and exceptional. The presumption should be 
that children will be more damaged by ignorance 
of their parents’ whereabouts (and equally, that 
imprisoned children will be more damaged by 
their parents not being told where they are) than 
by the discovery of the absent family member’s 
fate, however shocking. Oman has entered a res-
ervation to this paragraph stating that “or to pub-
lic safety” should be added to the words “unless 
the provision of information would be detrimen-
tal to the well-being of the child” (CRC/C/2/
Rev.8, p. 34). But even when States are troubled 
by extreme forms of terrorism, it is difficult to 
imagine how telling a child the whereabouts of 
his or her parent, or vice versa, could jeopardize 
public safety. The United Nations Rules for the 
Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty 
states that parents and relatives must be informed 
without delay of the fact of the child’s detention, 
reasons for it and other details.
The wording refers only to “essential informa-
tion concerning the whereabouts”, which might be 
insufficient information in some cases – certainly 
in the case of death. States should also ensure that 
family members are given essential information 
as to cause – why the person has been impris-
oned, deported, died in custody and so forth – and 
other relevant details (for example when they can 
see the family member or what their legal rights 
are). The qualification that the information need 
only be provided “upon request” was specifically 
sought by some of the State representatives in 
the drafting group, although it is hard to see how 
the qualification enhances children’s rights (E/
CN.4/1983/62, pp. 4 to 8; Detrick, p. 175). Children 
and parents should clearly be informed about each 
other’s whereabouts (unless such information is 
detrimental to the child’s well-being) whether or 
not they have made a request for the information. 
The Committee made these points to the People’s 
Democratic Republic of Korea:
“The Committee is concerned at the 
information that the whereabouts of parents 
may not be provided to children if the parents 
have been sentence to reform through labour 
or have been punished by death for a crime.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take all necessary measures in line with 
article 9, paragraph 3, of the Convention 
to keep children informed about the 
whereabouts of their parents, and to fully 
implement their right to maintain personal 
relations and direct contact with both parents 
on a regular basis.” (People’s Democratic 
Republic of Korea, CRC/C/15/Add.239, paras. 42 
and 43)
The right for requests for such
 information not to entail 
“adverse consequences for 
the person(s) concerned”
This requirement must protect both the person 
seeking the information and the person to whom 
the information refers. Again, these are mat-
ters of human rights, only needing to be con-
firmed because of documented cases of abuse. 
One example where requests for information by 
the State might unwittingly entail adverse con-
sequences is when inquiries are made about the 
relatives of children seeking asylum, causing 
unintended repercussions for those relatives.

• General measures of implementation
Have appropriate general measures of implementation been taken in relation to article 9, 
including:
■  identification and coordination of the responsible departments and agencies at all 
levels of government (article 9 is relevant to the departments of justice (criminal 
and civil), social welfare, health and education)?
■  identification of relevant non-governmental organizations/civil society partners?
■  a comprehensive review to ensure that all legislation, policy and practice is 
compatible with the article, for all children in all parts of the jurisdiction?
adoption of a strategy to secure full implementation 
■  which includes where necessary the identification of goals and indicators of 
progress?
■  which does not affect any provisions which are more conducive to the rights of 
the child? 
■  which recognizes other relevant international standards?
■  which involves where necessary international cooperation?
(Such measures may be part of an overall governmental strategy for implementing 
the Convention as a whole.)
■  budgetary analysis and allocation of necessary resources?
■  development of mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation?
■  making the implications of article 9 widely known to adults and children?
■  development of appropriate training and awareness-raising (in relation to article 9 
likely to include the training of the judiciary, lawyers, social workers, hospital staff 
and those working in the juvenile justice and immigration systems)?
• Specific issues in implementing article 9
■  Does the State ensure that parents and children are separated against their will by 
State authorities only when it is necessary to protect the best interests of the child?
■  Does domestic law enable judicial intervention on behalf of the child when there is 
disagreement between the parents, or between the parents and the child as to the 
child’s place of residence or as to access to the child by a parent?
■  Does the State ensure that contact between parents and children in institutions 
(such as children’s homes or boarding schools) or placements (such as foster care 
or respite care for children with disabilities) is maintained to the maximum extent 
compatible with the child’s best interests?
■  Do programmes for those children living or working on the streets respect the 
child’s right not to be separated from his or her parents unless it is necessary for his 
or her best interests?
■  Are hospitals required or encouraged to make arrangements for parents to be with 
their children in hospital whenever practicable?

reunification rather than asylum) or children of 
separated parents living in different countries..
While family unity is a fundamental principle 
of the Convention, the wording of article 10 is 
notably weaker than that of article 9 in so far as 
the right to family reunification is not expressly 
guaranteed (even though article 10 makes an 
express reference to article 9(1)). The tentative 
wording of article 10 reflects concerns about 
immigration control – a cause of great anxiety to 
richer nations, haunted by the spectre of mass 
migrations of the world’s poor.
rticle 10 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child is concerned 
with rights to “family reunification” 
of children who are, or whose par-
ents are, involved in entering or leaving a coun-
try. The article requires States to deal with family 
reunification “in a positive, humane and expedi-
tious manner” and to allow parents and children 
to visit each other if they live in different States. 
Most families affected by article 10 are either so-
called “economic migrants”, refugees (although it 
should be noted that parents or children of refu-
gees may seek entry for the purposes of family 
Text of Article 10
1. In accordance with the obligations of States Parties under article 9, paragraph 1, 
applications by a child or his or her parents to enter or leave a State Party for the purpose of 
family reunification shall be dealt with by the States Parties in a positive, humane and 
expeditious manner. States Parties shall further ensure that the submission of such a request 
shall entail no adverse consequences for the applicants and for the members of their family.
2. A child whose parents reside in different States shall have the right to maintain on a regular 
basis, save in exceptional circumstances, personal relations and direct contacts with both 
parents. Towards that end and in accordance with the obligation of States Parties under article 9, 
paragraph 1, States Parties shall respect the right of the child and his or her parents to leave 
any country, including their own, and to enter their own country. The right to leave any
country shall be subject only to such restrictions as are prescribed by law and which are 
necessary to protect the national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals 
or the rights and freedoms of others and are consistent with the other rights recognized in 
the present Convention.

136
The article does not directly address the right of 
children or their parents to “remain” for the pur-
poses of family reunification, taking in the whole 
question of the deportation of parents. However, 
by implication, since a deported parent would at 
once be in a position to wish to re-enter the coun-
try, these cases can be assumed to be covered by 
this article (as well as by article 9, see page 121).
Along with encouraging States to ratify treaties 
relating to refugees (see article 22, page 305), the 
Committee recommends that countries ratify the 
International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families. The Convention came into force 
in July 2003 (see box for countries that have 
ratified, as at July 2007). Its article 44 provides 
that contracting States should take measures 
“which they consider appropriate and which are 
within their powers to facilitate the reunion of 
migrant workers with their spouses, or with any 
persons having a relationship with them, which in 
accordance with the law is the equivalent of mar-
riage, as well as their dependent or single chil-
dren.” Article 22 protects migrant workers from 
mass expulsion; article 14 protects them from 
“arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or 
her privacy, family, home...” 
■
Right of child or parent to have
any applications “to enter or
leave a State Party for the
purpose of family reunifica-
tion” dealt with “in a positive, 
humane and expeditious 
manner” by the States Parties
“Positive” 
When drafting this article some State represen-
tatives were concerned about the interpretation 
of the word “positive”. Two alternatives were 
proposed – “objective” and “favourable” – and 
were rejected. “Favourable” was thought to con-
tain too much of an element of prejudgement, 
whereas “positive”, though stronger than “objec-
tive”, did not assume that the State must agree 
to the application (E/CN.4/l989/48, pp. 37 to 40; 
Detrick, p. 206). Nonetheless, Japan took pains 
to enter a declaration that: “The Government of 
Japan declares further that the obligation to deal 
with applications to enter or leave a State Party 
for the purpose of family reunification ‘in a posi-
tive, humane and expeditious manner’ provided 
for in paragraph 1 of article 10 of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child be interpreted not to 
affect the outcome of such applications.” (CRC/
C/2/Rev.8, p. 26) The Committee has twice rec-
ommended that Japan withdraws this declaration 
(Japan CRC/C/15/Add.231, para. 9).
Because many richer nations have increasingly 
in recent decades closed their borders to labour 
migration, family reunion has become the main 
legal entitlement for the settlement of immigrants. 
This, in turn, has led to increasingly restrictive 
conditions being placed on the right to family 
reunification. Some countries require nationality 
status before such rights can be secured. Many 
countries now require applicants to prove that 
there are sufficient resources to support the 
immigrant’s family members without recourse to 
public funds. Other countries have stricter condi-
tions for foreigners who themselves entered the 
country for family reunion when they were chil-
dren. Not all States recognize 16- to 18-year-olds 
as children and some countries require children 
to be “dependent”, or the exclusive responsibil-
ity of one parent if the parents are separated. The 
Committee expressed concern, for example, about 
Austria’s “length of family reunification proce-
dures and at the fact that it is restricted through 
the quota system and the age limit set for children 
at 15 years.” (Austria CRC/C/15/Add.251, para. 
35) And, while welcoming the fact that Estonia’s 
National Court had found immigration quotas 
unconstitutional, the Committee remained con-
cerned that Estonian law:
“… does not guarantee family reunification 
because it requires a dependent refugee 
spouse and dependent children outside Estonia 
to meet the criteria of the 1951 Refugee 
Convention even after the principal applicant 
has met the criteria. Further, the Committee 
is concerned that there are no legal provisions 
which make it possible for family members to 
reunite with a child who has been recognized as 
a refugee.” (Estonia CRC/C/15/Add.196, para. 34)
The United Kingdom entered a blanket reserva-
tion to enable it to apply immigration legislation 
as it deems necessary (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 42). 
The Committee expressed concern about this res-
ervation, commenting that:
“... the reservation relating to the application 
of the Nationality and Immigration Act 
does not appear to be compatible with the 
principles and provisions of the Convention, 
including those of its articles 2,3,9 and 10”. 
The Committee suggested that the United 
Kingdom review its nationality and immigra-
tion laws and procedures to ensure their confor-
mity with the principles and provisions of the 
Convention (United Kingdom CRC/C/15/Add.34, 
paras. 7 and 29). These concerns were reiter-
ated in its observations on the United Kingdom’s 
Second Report (CRC/C/15/Add.188, para. 6).

Liechtenstein “reserves the right to apply the 
Liechtenstein legislation according to which 
family reunification for certain categories of 
foreigners is not guaranteed” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, 
p. 28); this reservation was still in place at the 
examination of Liechtenstein’s Second Report, 
to the Committee’s regret (CRC/C/LIE/CO/2, 
para. 4), and Singapore reserved the right to 
apply its legislation relating to entry and stay in 
Singapore “as it may deem necessary from time 
to time” (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 37), also a matter of 
concern to the Committee (Singapore CRC/C/15/
Add.220, para. 6). 
As discussed in the summary, the provisions of 
this article should apply to children whose parents 
are under threat of deportation. The Committee 
also expressed concern that in Norway:
“... the police may not be instructed to delay 
the expulsion of some members of the family 
in order to ensure that the whole family 
remains together and that undue strain on the 
children is avoided.
“... it is suggested that solutions should also be 
sought to avoid expulsions causing separation 
of families.” (Norway CRC/C/15/Add.23, paras. 11 
and 24)
While the Committee commended Norway’s 
‘positive’ efforts when responding to its Second 
Report, it was concerned that the best interests of 
children were not always taken into account when 
deportation decisions were made: 
“The Committee is … concerned that despite 
the State Party’s positive efforts, when 
decisions to deport foreigners convicted of 
a criminal offence are taken, professional 
opinions on the impact of such decisions upon 
the children of the deported persons are 
not systematically referred to and taken into 
consideration. 
“The Committee… recommends that the 
State Party review the process through 
which deportation decisions are made to 
ensure that where deportation will mean the 
separation of a child from his or her parent, 
the best interests of the child are taken into 
consideration.” (Norway CRC/C/15/Add.126, 
paras. 30 and 31)
When it examined Norway’s Third Report, the 
Committee reiterated this concern and again rec-
ommended Norway to
“… ensure that the best interests of the child 
are a primary consideration in the decisions 
taken regarding deportation of their parents.” 
(Norway CRC/C15/Add.263, para. 22)

“Humane”
The word “humane” qualifies and strengthens the 
word “positive”. For example, in cases where par-
ents are illegal immigrants but their children have 
acquired the right to the host country’s nation-
ality, it is more humane to allow the family to 
remain in the country than to deport the parents 
– even though in both cases the family remains 
together.
The Committee raised concerns with Australia 
about discrimination against children travelling 
without documents:
“… that children who are granted a temporary 
protection visa (those arriving in the country 
without any travel document) do not have the 
right to family reunification…
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party… consider permitting family 
reunification in cases where children or their 
family members are holders of temporary 
protection or temporary humanitarian visas…” 
(Australia CRC/C/15/Add.268, paras. 63 and 64)
The procedure for making the decision must 
also be humane. It is essential that immigration 
processes respect the dignity of the applicants, 
including the child’s dignity. Treatment in deten-
tion centres can often be inhumane, as can the 
investigations by the authorities to authenticate 
the applications. The Committee has stressed 
the link between article 10 and article 37 (depri-
vation of liberty), pointing out that even where 
applicant children are housed in comfortable sur-
roundings, such as hotels, they are still deprived 
of their liberty and their particular needs are not 
necessarily taken into account (see page 556). 
Children should not be subjected to investigations 
that could harm their health (such as bone X-rays 
to identify their age) or psychological well-being 
(such as traumatizing interrogations), nor should 
they be subjected to medical tests without their, 
or as appropriate, their parents’ consent. 
The Committee’s General Comment No. 6 on 
“Treatment of unaccompanied and separated chil-
dren outside their country of origin” emphasizes 
that securing family reunion should not endanger 
refugee children:
“Family reunification in the country of origin is 
not in the best interests of the child and should 
therefore not be pursued where there is a 
‘reasonable risk’ that such a return would lead 
to the violation of fundamental human rights 
of the child… the granting of refugee status 
constitutes a legally binding obstacle to return 
to the country of origin and, consequently, 
to family reunification therein. Where the 
circumstances in the country of origin contain 
lower level risks and there is concern, for 
example, of the child being affected by the 
indiscriminate effects of generalized violence, 
such risks must be given full attention 
and balanced against other rights-based 
considerations, including the consequences 
of further separation. In this context, it must 
be recalled that the survival of the child is of 
paramount importance and a precondition for 
the enjoyment of any other rights.
“Whenever family reunification in the country 
of origin is not possible, irrespective of 
whether this is due to legal obstacles to return 
or whether the best-interests-based balancing 
test has decided against return, the obligations 
under articles 9 and 10 of the Convention 
come into effect and should govern the host 
country’s decisions on family reunification 
therein.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 6, 2005, CRC/GC/2005/6, 
paras. 82 and 83) 
“Expeditious”
All judicial and administrative processes con-
cerning children need to be pursued as quickly as 
possible. Delay and uncertainty can be extremely 
prejudicial to children’s healthy development. 
There is a sense in which any period of time is 
significantly ‘longer’ in the life of a child than 
in that of an adult. In immigration cases delays 
can ruin children’s chances – for example some 
children pass the key age of 18 while still waiting 
for their application to be heard. The Committee 
expressed concern to Finland:
“While the Committee welcomes the 
considerable reduction in the time required for 
processing the applications of unaccompanied 
children, it is still concerned that the time 
needed for family reunification remains too 
long.” (Finland CRC/C/15/Add.273, para. 49)
And it raised concern about delays in family 
reunification with Spain, 
“… in particular for the issuance of the 
necessary visa and travel documents by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.” (Spain CRC/15/
Add.185, para. 34) 
In its Concluding Observations on Canada’s 
Initial Report, the Committee expressed concern 
about the position of refugee and immigrant chil-
dren: 
“The Committee recognizes the efforts made 
by Canada for many years in accepting a 
large number of refugees and immigrants. 
Nevertheless, the Committee regrets that the 
principles of non-discrimination, of the best 
interests of the child and of the respect for 
the views of the child have not always been 
given adequate weight by administrative 
bodies dealing with the situation of refugee 
or immigrant children. It is particularly worried 
... by the insufficient measures aimed at 
family reunification with a view to ensuring

that it is dealt with in a positive, humane 
and expeditious manner. The Committee 
specifically regrets the delays in dealing with 
reunification of the family in cases where 
one or more members of the family have 
been considered eligible for refugee status 
in Canada as well as cases where refugee 
or immigrant children born in Canada may 
be separated from their parents facing a 
deportation order.” 
The Committee recommended:
“... that the State Party pay particular 
attention to... the general principles of the 
Convention, in particular the best interests 
of the child and respect for his or her views, 
in all matters relating to the protection of 
refugee and immigrant children, including 
in deportation proceedings. The Committee 
suggests that every feasible measure be taken 
to facilitate and speed up the reunification 
of the family in cases where one or more 
members of the family have been considered 
eligible for refugee status in Canada. Solutions 
should also be sought to avoid expulsions 
causing the separation of families, in the spirit 
of article 9 of the Convention...” (Canada 
CRC/C/15/Add.37, paras. 13 and 24)
while the Committee noted that Canada, on its 
Second Report, had made some improvements 
to the situation of children in immigration pro-
cedures, its concerns about family reunifica-
tion had not be met (Canada CRC/C/15/Add.215, 
para. 46; see also page 126).
The Committee also expressed concern over 
Germany’s procedures and treatment of foreign 
children in need of family reunification:
“The Committee remains concerned about the 
extent to which account is taken of the special 
needs and rights of children in asylum-seeking 
and refugee situations. Procedures governing 
asylum-seeking children, particularly those 
relating to family reunification, expulsion 
of children to safe third countries and the 
‘airport regulation’ give cause for concern. 
In this respect the Committee notes that the 
guarantees provided for in the Convention, in 
particular in its articles 2, 3, 12, 22 and 37(d) 
do not appear to be complied with, while 
insufficient attention seems to have been 
ensured to the implementation of articles 9 
and 10 of the Convention...
“The Committee is of the opinion that the 
issue of asylum-seeking and refugee children 
deserves further study with a view to its 
reform in the light of the Convention and of 
the concerns expressed during the discussion 
with the Committee ..” 
And the Committee also encouraged the involve-
ment of children in these proceedings (Germany 
CRC/C/15/Add.43, paras. 19, 33 and 29). (“Airport 
regulation” relates to provisions that penal-
ize companies for allowing passengers to travel 
without proper visas or entry authorizations.) On 
Germany’s Second Report the Committee was 
still concerned that its family reunification pro-
cedures were “complex and too long” (Germany 
CRC/C/15/Add.226, para. 54).
Right for such applications 
to entail “no adverse 
consequences” for 
any member of the family
This right relates to those countries where appli-
cations to enter or leave have resulted in the 
applicant or the applicant’s family being perse-
cuted or discriminated against. Such treatment is 
obviously a breach of human rights in all circum-
stances. The act of making an application should 
never put an applicant in jeopardy, even though 
the application may be turned down.
However, where asylum seeking occurs, the 
receiving State may unwittingly entail adverse 
consequences for the child or the child’s family 
by making incautious enquiries; therefore care 
must be taken not to breach confidentiality in a 
hazardous manner (see article 22, page 316). 
Right of child (save in 
exceptional circumstances) to 
maintain, on a regular basis, 
personal relations and direct 
contacts with both parents 
where the parents reside 
in different States
The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction (1980) assists with 
realizing this right because it allows parents to 
enforce court orders for access (contact or visita-
tion rights) in the Hague Convention States (see 
article 11, page 144). But not all parents with 
access problems in foreign countries have court 
orders, and only around a third of the world’s 
countries have ratified or acceded to the Hague 
Convention. This right of the child should ensure 
that States give favourable consideration both to 
applications for access and applications for entry 
and exit in order to exercise access.
It is important not to assume that children with 
refugee status will never be able to return to their 
State of origin for family visits. Organizing a 
safe temporary visit may be possible. Evidence of 
children returning home for the purpose of tem-
porary family reunification should not prejudice 
their refugee status.

Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child

Right of child and parents to 
leave any country (including 
their own), subject only to 
legal restrictions “which are
necessary to protect national 
security, public order (ordre 
public), public health or 
morals or the rights and 
freedoms of others and are 
consistent with the rights of 
this Convention”
This provision reflects the wording of article 
12(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights which provides: “Everyone shall 
be free to leave any country including his own.” 
It was drafted at a time when a number of coun-
tries, including many of those in the sphere of the 
former USSR, unreasonably refused to allow citi-
zens to leave the country. This is still the case in 
certain countries.
The French term ordre public is used in a num-
ber of international treaties; it is said to be more 
precise than “public order” (E/CN.4/1986/39, pp. 
5 to 8; Detrick, p. 200) but it seems that there are 
now a variety of interpretations of ordre public 
across the world, some of which are more related 
to economic considerations than to the social ones 
normally understood by the phrase “public order”.
Right of child and parent 
“to enter their own country” 
This right is unqualified by any restrictions. An 
earlier draft of article 10 proposed that the child 
be given the right to “return” to his or her country, 
but this was changed to “enter” to accommodate 
those circumstances where children were born 
outside their State of nationality (E/CN.4/1986/39, 
pp. 5 to 8; Detrick, p. 201). Article 12(4) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights is the source: “No one shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of the right to enter his own country.” 
The Human Rights Committee has issued a 
General Comment on freedom of movement, 
in which it notes, in relation to this right in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights: “The right of a person to enter his or her 
own country recognizes the special relationship 
of a person to that country. The right has vari-
ous facets… The scope of ‘his own country’ is 
broader than the concept ‘country of his nation-
ality’. It is not limited to nationality in a formal 
sense, that is, nationality acquired at birth or by 
conferral; it embraces, at the very least, an indi-
vidual who, because of his or her special ties to 
or claims in relation to a given country, cannot be 
considered to be a mere alien…” (Human Rights 
Committee, General Comment No. 27, 1999, HRI/
GEN/1/Rev.8,  paras. 19 and 20, p. 217)

on children who are taken out of their country, 
whereas article 35 is not. 
The Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 1997, 
observes that “children may be abducted by one 
of the parents and are usually not permitted to 
return home,... The situation often tends to per-
manently prevent the child from having access 
to the parent with whom the child used to live or 
with whom the child had direct and regular con-
tacts and personal relations (see article 9, para-
graph (3) and article 10, paragraph (2)). It also 
shows how important it is to be guided by the 
best interests of the child and in ensuring, as a 
general rule, that both parents continue to assume 
their responsibilities for the upbringing and 
development of the child, even when separation 
or divorce has intervened.” (Manual, p. 451)
The article encourages States to conclude or 
become parties to multilateral agreements. 
Principal among these is the Hague Convention 
on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction. 
■
atifying States have responsibilities 
under article 11 to prevent children 
from being wrongfully taken or from 
being retained outside their jurisdic-
tion, to secure that these children are recovered 
and to undertake that abducted children brought 
into their jurisdiction are returned. 
The article is primarily concerned with paren-
tal abductions or retentions. Though the article 
includes non-parents in its scope, it should be 
noted that article 35 covers the sale, traffick-
ing and abduction of children, as does the new 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornog-
raphy. The difference between the two articles is 
not immediately clear, given that “illicit transfer 
and non-return of children abroad” is the same 
thing as “abduction” (even when the child is will-
ing and no force is used).  Broadly speaking, the 
distinction is, first, that article 11 applies to chil-
dren taken for personal rather than financial gain, 
usually parents or other relatives, whereas “sale” 
and “trafficking” has a commercial or sexual 
motive. Second, article 11 is exclusively focused 
Text of Article 11
1. States Parties shall take measures to combat the illicit transfer and non-return of children 
abroad.
2. To this end, States Parties shall promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral 
agreements or accession to existing agreements.

Measures to combat illicit 
transfer and non-return of 
children abroad
As article 11 acknowledges, a most effective 
means of implementing its provisions is to sign 
and implement the relevant international trea-
ties, such as the Hague Convention on the Civil 
Aspects of International Child Abduction (1980). 
For example, the Committee expressed its deep 
concern to Algeria:
“… at the difficulty of implementing judicial 
decisions regarding custody and visitation 
rights for Algerian children with one parent 
living outside Algeria. It further expresses its 
concern that child abduction is particularly 
prevalent among children of mixed marriages.
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party undertake all necessary efforts 
to prevent and combat illicit transfer and 
non-return of children and to ensure proper 
and expeditious implementation of judicial 
decisions made with regard to custody and 
visiting rights. It further recommends that 
the State Party strengthen dialogue and 
consultation with relevant countries, notably 
those with which the State Party has signed 
an agreement regarding custody or visitation 
rights, and ratify the Hague Convention on 
Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 
of 1980.” (Algeria CRC/C/15/Add.269, paras. 48 
and 49)
The Hague Convention is a global instrument. 
At the time of writing, a substantial number of 
countries have ratified the Convention (see box), 
although there is a significant absence of Middle 
Eastern and Far Eastern countries. Its provi-
sions, in brief, protect children under the age of 
16 who have been wrongfully (that is, in breach of 
someone’s rights of custody) removed or retained 
abroad, if the Hague Convention is in force 
between the two countries involved. In these cir-
cumstances the court will normally order such 
children to be returned promptly to the place 
where they have habitual residence, when a final 
decision as to their future can be made. The courts 
may refuse to order this if the child objects or is 
at grave risk of harm or has been over a year in 
the new environment and is settled there – but the 
court’s business is not to investigate the merits of 
the dispute itself. Each State Party to the Hague 
Convention has an administrative body called the 
Central Authority, whose function is to receive 
and transmit applications under the Convention. 
In addition to the Hague Convention, there are 
regional treaties such as the Inter-American 
Convention on the International Return of 
Children, and the European Convention on the 
Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions 
Concerning Custody of Children. These can be 
helpful in augmenting the principles of the Hague 
Convention, for example by enforcing the details 
of existing court orders. Some countries have fully 
acceded to the Convention; others have entered into 
its provisions only in relation to specified coun-
tries. Even where States have not ratified, bilateral 
agreements can be concluded between two coun-
tries. The Committee observed to Mauritius:
“While noting the ratification and subsequent 
domestication by the State Party of the 
Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction, the Committee 
is nevertheless concerned about the slow pace 
of the State Party’s formal recognition of other 
countries as parties to the Convention when 
they have acceded to it, which hampers the 
effective implementation of the Convention in 
case of international abduction of children.
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party formally recognize every other 
State which has acceded to the same Hague 
Convention as party to that Convention in order 
States in which the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects 
of International Child Abduction applies, as a result of 
ratification or accession (as at July 2007)

to provide immediate and effective protection 
for abducted children in accordance with the 
Hague Convention and with articles 11 and 3 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.” 
(Mauritius CRC/C/MUS/CO/2, paras. 39 and 40) 
In addition, the Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, 
Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and 
Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility 
and Measures for the Protection of Children 
(1996) came into force in 2002 (see box). This 
Convention does not deal directly with paren-
tal abductions, but it does settle related matters 
such as who has parental responsibility and cus-
tody rights of children who have moved between 
countries, and which country has jurisdiction to 
act on behalf of these children (for example as 
between the country of the child’s habitual resi-
dence and the child’s country of nationality). The 
Committee has also encouraged States to ratify 
this Convention.
Beyond ratifying international treaties, and 
encouraging others States to ratify, a State should 
also take other measures to implement article 11. 
In particular, it should secure that:
• machinery is in place to speedily put checks 
on borders and to obtain appropriate court 
orders (for example, to withhold the child’s 
passport) when it is suspected that a child is 
going to be abducted;
• parents are provided with legal aid and finan-
cial assistance when it is necessary to pay for 
the costs of the child’s return;
• diplomatic and consular officials and the 
judiciary overseeing the law are fully 
acquainted with the principles of the Hague 
Convention;
• information is provided from government 
agencies and state databases to identify the 
whereabouts of abducted or wrongfully 
retained children.
For example, the Committee noted to Canada:
“The Committee notes with satisfaction that 
Canada is a party to the Hague Convention 
on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction of 1980 and notes the concern of 
the State Party that parental abductions of 
children are a growing problem.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party apply the Hague Convention to all 
children abducted to Canada, encourage States 
that are not yet party to the Hague Convention 
to ratify or accede to this treaty and, if 
necessary, conclude bilateral agreements 
to deal adequately with international child 
abduction. It further recommends that 
maximum assistance be provided through 
diplomatic and consular channels in order to 
resolve cases of illicit transfer and non-return 
in the best interests of the children involved.” 
(Canada CRC/C/15/Add.215, paras. 28 and 29)
The Committee commended the fact that in 
Sweden 
“… financial assistance is made available to 
cover the costs incurred by individuals when 
restoring illicitly transferred or non-returned 
children.” (Sweden CRC/C/15/Add.248, para. 27)
And it recommended to Croatia 
“… that professionals dealing with this kind 
of case receive adequate and ongoing training 
and that maximum assistance be provided 
through diplomatic and consular channels, in 
order to solve cases of illicit transfer.” (Croatia 
CRC/C/15/Add.243, para. 46)
The Committee has been relatively silent on the 
failure of countries to become parties to the Hague 
Conventions and other regional treaties on abduc-
tion, though failure to do so could result in a breach 
of article 11 for the individual children concerned.

trative proceedings affecting him or her. This 
covers a very wide range of court hearings and 
also formal decision-making affecting the child 
in, for example, education, health, planning, the 
environment and so on (see page 155 below). 
The Committee has consistently emphasized that 
the child must be regarded as an active subject of 
rights and that a key purpose of the Convention 
is to emphasize that human rights extend to chil-
dren. Article 12, together with the child’s right to 
freedom of expression (article 13), and other civil 
rights to freedom of thought, conscience and reli-
gion (article 14), and freedom of association (art-
icle 15) underline children’s status as individuals 
with fundamental human rights, and views and 
feelings of their own. The Committee has rejected 
what it termed “the charity mentality and paternal-
istic approaches” to children’s issues. It invariably 
raises implementation of article 12 with States 
he Committee on the Rights of the 
Child asserted early on that article 12 
is a general principle of fundamental 
importance, relevant to all aspects of 
implementation of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and to the interpretation of all other 
articles. 
Paragraph 1 requires States to assure 
• that any child capable of forming a view has 
the right to express views freely in all matters 
affecting him or her;
• that the child’s views are given due weight in 
accordance with
• age and
• maturity.
Paragraph 2 specifically provides the child with 
the right to be heard and have his or her views 
given due weight in any judicial and adminis-
Text of Article 12
1. States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the 
right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child 
being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.
2. For this purpose, the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in 
any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a 
representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of 
national law.

Parties and identifies traditional practices, culture 
and attitudes as obstacles. In 2006, the Committee 
held a Day of General Discussion on “The right 
of the child to be heard” and resolved to adopt a 
General Comment (under preparation in 2007); 
its first 10 General Comments each interpret the 
implications of article 12 in particular contexts.
The rights of the child set out in the two para-
graphs of article 12 do not provide a right to 
self-determination but concern involvement in 
decision-making. The references to the “evolving 
capacities” of the child, in articles 5 and 14 (pages 
75 and 185) do emphasize the need to respect the 
child’s developing capacity for decision-making.
Certain other articles include references to chil-
dren’s participation. Article 9(2) refers indirectly 
to the child’s right to be heard in relation to pro-
ceedings involving separation from his or her 
parent(s), during which “all interested Parties 
shall be given an opportunity to participate in the 
proceedings and make their views known” (art-
icle 9, page 129). In relation to adoption proceed-
ings, article 21(a) refers to “the informed consent” 
of the persons concerned (page 296). Every child 
deprived of his or her liberty has the right under 
article 37 to challenge the legality of the depriva-
tion before a court or other authority, suggesting 
a right to initiate court action rather than just to 
be heard (page 557). And article 40, in relation to 
children “alleged as, accused of, or recognized as 
having infringed the penal law,” emphasizes the 
juvenile’s right to an active role in the proceed-
ings, though he or she must not “be compelled 
to give testimony or to confess guilt” (article 
40(2)(b)(iv), pages 614 and 615).
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression; this right includes free-
dom to hold opinions without interference and to 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas 
through any media and regardless of frontiers” 
(article 19). And the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights states: “Everyone shall 
have the right to hold opinions without interfer-
ence” (article 19(1)). The significance of article 
12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
is that it not only requires that children should be 
assured the right to express their views freely, but 
also that they should be heard and that their views 
be given “due weight”. 
■
The child as a subject of rights 
and an active participant
In 2006, following its Day of General Discussion 
on “The right of the child to be heard”, the 
Committee adopted detailed recommendations, 
with a preamble emphasizing that they were not 
exhaustive and indicating that it will shortly draft 
a General Comment on the interpretation of art-
icle 12, to highlight
“… its importance as a general principle as 
well as a substantive right and its linkages 
with other articles of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and in order to provide 
further guidance on the implementation of 
the Convention. The General Comment will 
explore in detail how the right should be 
implemented consistently in all settings.” 
In the preamble to the recommendations, the 
Committee states: 
“The Committee considers that recognizing 
the right of the child to express views and to 
participate in various activities, according to 
her/his evolving capacities, is beneficial for the 
child, for the family, for the community, the 
school, the State, for democracy.
“To speak, to participate, to have their views 
taken into account: these three phases describe 
the sequence of the enjoyment of the right to 
participate from a functional point of view. 
The new and deeper meaning of this right is 
that it should establish a new social contract. 
One by which children are fully recognized 
as rights-holders who are not only entitled 
to receive protection but also have the right 
to participate in all matters affecting them, a 
right which can be considered as the symbol for 
their recognition as rights holders. This implies, 
in the long term, changes in political, social, 
institutional and cultural structures.” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, Report on the forty-third 
session, September 2006, Day of General Discussion, 
Recommendations, Preamble. For full text, see www.
ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/discussion.htm.)
The Committee highlights traditional and cul-
tural attitudes to children as the major obstacle
to acceptance of the child as a holder of rights 
and to implementation of article 12 in States 
in all regions. It calls for promotion of a 
social climate conducive to child participation 
(Recommendations, para. 9). 
The Committee very often pursues this in its 
Concluding Observations on States’ reports. For 
example:
“The Committee notes with concern that, due 
to traditional and paternalistic attitudes still 
widespread in the country, children are not 
encouraged to express their views and that, in 
general, their views are not heard nor given 
due weight in decisions affecting them in the 
family, at school, in the community and in social 
life at large.” (Chile CRC/C/15/ Add.173, para. 29) 
“While welcoming the establishment of 
a Children’s Parliament, the Committee is 
concerned that, owing to traditional attitudes,

respect for the views of the child remains 
limited within the family, in schools, in the 
courts before administrative authorities and 
in society at large…” (Burkina Faso CRC/C/15/
Add.193, para. 26) 
“The Committee welcomes the establishment 
of the Children’s Parliament and the 
development of a model for Children’s 
City Councils, but remains concerned that 
respect for the views of the child remains 
limited owing to traditional societal attitudes 
towards children on the part of schools, 
courts, administrative bodies and, especially, 
the family…” (Morocco CRC/C/15/Add.211,
para. 30) 
“The Committee welcomes initiatives 
to increase child participation by the 
establishment of children’s councils, 
associations and projects in several states 
and districts, but remains concerned that 
traditional attitudes towards children in 
society, especially girls, still limit the respect 
for their views within the family, at school, in 
institutions and at the community government 
level…” (India CRC/C/15/Add.228, para. 36) 
“While noting that articles 36 and 38 of the 
Algerian Constitution provide for freedom of 
opinion and expression, as well as for freedom 
of intellectual, artistic and scientific creation, 
the Committee is concerned that respect for 
the views of the child remains limited owing to 
traditional societal attitudes towards children 
within the family, schools and the community 
at large. The Committee notes with particular 
concern that the public exercise of freedom 
of opinion and expression by a child requires 
the authorization of his/her guardian.” (Algeria 
CRC/C/15/Add.269, para. 33) 
“While the Committee welcomes the efforts 
made by the State Party to promote respect for 
the views of the child, it is aware of a general 
attitude in society to pay little attention to 
children’s views…” (Hungary CRC/C/HUN/CO/2, 
para. 24) 
“… the Committee is of the view that 
children’s right to free expression and to 
participation is still limited in the State Party, 
partly due to traditional attitudes.” (United 
Republic of Tanzania CRC/C/TZA/CO/2, para. 29)
The Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 
1997, comments: “This article sets one of the 
fundamental values of the Convention and 
probably also one of its basic challenges. In 
essence it affirms that the child is a fully fledged 
person having the right to express views in all 
matters affecting him or her, and having those 
views heard and given due weight. Thus the child 
has the right to participate in the decision-making 
process affecting his or her life, as well as to 
influence decisions taken in his or her regard...
“At the first sight it might be considered that 
article 12 is basically addressing the same real-
ity as article 13 on freedom of expression and 
information. It is true that they are closely con-
nected. But the fact they were both incorporated 
in the Convention and coexist in an autonomous 
manner, has to be interpreted as to mean that, 
while article 13 recognizes in a general way free-
dom of expression, article 12 should prevail in all 
those cases where the matters at stake affect the 
child, while stressing the right of the child to be 
heard and for the child’s views to be taken into 
account.” (Manual, p. 426)
In examining successive reports, the Committee 
persists in encouraging both law reform and 
public education and training to implement art-
icle 12. It encourages the development of chil-
dren’s organizations; the Guidelines for Periodic 
Reports (Revised 2005) asks States to provide 
data on the number of child and youth organiza-
tions or associations and the number of members 
they represent, and also on the number of schools 
with independent student councils (CRC/C/58/
Rev.1, Annex, paras. 6 and 7). The Committee 
urges States to review implementation of article 
12 and to consider what impact children’s views 
are having on policy development. For example:
“The Committee recommends that further 
efforts be made to ensure the implementation 
of the principle of respect for the views of the 
child. Particular emphasis should be placed on 
the right of every child to express his or her 
views freely in all matters affecting him or her, 
the views of the child being given due weight 
in accordance with the age and maturity of 
the child in question. This general principle 
should also be reflected in all laws, judicial 
and administrative decisions, policies and 
programmes relating to children and should be 
implemented in the family, school, community 
and all institutions attended by and working 
with children.” (Hungary CRC/C/HUN/CO/2, 
para. 25)
“In the light of article 12 of the Convention, the 
Committee recommends that the State Party:
(a) Strengthen its efforts to ensure that 
children have the right to express their views 
freely in all matters affecting them and to 
have those views given due weight in schools 
and other educational institutions, as well as 
in the family, and reduce the discrepancies 
in the opportunities for the participation of 
students from different social and regional 
backgrounds;
(b) Develop community-based skills-training 
programmes for parents, teachers and other

professionals working with and for children, to 
encourage children to express their informed 
views and opinions by providing them with 
proper information and guidance;
(c) Ensure that children be provided with the 
opportunity to be heard in any judicial and 
administrative proceeding affecting them, and 
that due weight be given to those views in 
accordance with the age and maturity of the 
child;
(d) Systematically ensure the effective 
participation of children’s organizations in 
the development of national, regional and 
local policies or programmes affecting them, 
including educational reforms; and 
(e) Provide more detailed information on this 
issue in the next periodic report.” (Latvia 
CRC/C/LVA/CO/2, para. 25)
“In the light of article 12 of the Convention, 
the Committee recommends that the State 
Party:
(a) Strengthen its efforts to promote within 
the family, schools, and other institutions 
respect for the views of children, especially 
girls, and facilitate their participation in all 
matters affecting them;
(b) Amend the procedural civil codes to ensure 
that children are heard in judicial proceedings 
affecting them;
(c) Strengthen national awareness-raising 
campaigns to change traditional attitudes that 
limit children’s right to participation;
(d) Regularly review the extent to which 
children participate in the development and 
evaluation of laws and policies affecting them, 
both at national and local levels, and evaluate 
the extent to which children’s views are taken 
into consideration, including their impact on 
relevant policies and programmes.” (Mexico 
CRC/C/MEX/CO/3, para. 28)
The Committee emphasizes that it is not enough 
that legislation should establish children’s right 
to be heard and to have their views given due 
weight: children must be made aware of their 
right. Thus the Committee encouraged France 
to promote and facilitate respect for the views 
of children and their participation in all matters 
affecting them
“... as a right they are informed of, not 
merely a possibility”. (France CRC/C/15/Add.240, 
para. 22)
It suggested to Iceland that children 
“... are not adequately informed on how to 
contribute effectively, or how their input … 
will be taken into consideration.” (Iceland 
CRC/C/15/Add. 203, para. 26) 
And to Belgium that 
“... children are not adequately informed on 
how they can have input into policies that 
affect them, nor how their views will be 
taken into consideration once they have been 
solicited…” (Belgium CRC/C/15/Add.178, para. 21) 
In the outcome document of the 2002 United 
Nations General Assembly’s special session on 
children, A World Fit for Children, States com-
mit themselves in its Declaration to: “Listen to 
children and ensure their participation. Children 
and adolescents are resourceful citizens capa-
ble of helping to build a better future for all. We 
must respect their right to express themselves and 
to participate in all matters affecting them, in 
accordance with their age and maturity.” (Report 
of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the 
twenty-seventh special session of the General 
Assembly, 2002, A/S-27/19/Rev.1, Declaration, 
para. 7.9) And the Plan of Action identifies chil-
dren as key partners: “Children, including ado-
lescents, must be enabled to exercise their right 
to express their views freely, according to their 
evolving capacity, and build self-esteem, acquire 
knowledge and skills, such as those for conflict 
resolution, decision-making and communica-
tion, to meet the challenges of life. The right of 
children, including adolescents, to express them-
selves freely must be respected and promoted 
and their views taken into account in all mat-
ters affecting them, the views of the child being 
given due weight in accordance with the age and 
maturity of the child. The energy and creativity 
of children and young people must be nurtured 
so that they can actively take part in shaping 
their environment, their societies and the world 
they will inherit. Disadvantaged and marginal-
ized children, including adolescents in particular, 
need special attention and support to access basic 
services, build self-esteem and to prepare them 
to take responsibility for their own lives. We will 
strive to develop and implement programmes to 
promote meaningful participation by children, 
including adolescents, in decision-making pro-
cesses, including in families and schools and at 
the local and national levels.” (Plan of Action, A/
S-27/19/Rev.1, para. 32(1))
Reservations
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
indicated concern about declarations and reser-
vations that appear to challenge full recognition 
of the child as a subject of rights. In recommen-
dations adopted following the Day of General 
Discussion on “The right of the child to be heard”, 
the Committee 
“… urges States Parties that have made 
reservations on the application of articles 12, 
13, 14, 15 and 17 of the Convention to consider 
their withdrawal.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, Report on the forty-third session, 
September 2006, Day of General Discussion, 
Recommendations, para. 14)

For example, in ratifying the Convention, Poland 
made a declaration: “The Republic of Poland 
considers that a child’s rights as defined in the 
Convention, in particular the rights defined in 
articles 12 to 16, shall be exercised with respect 
for parental authority, in accordance with Polish 
customs and traditions regarding the place of the 
child within and outside the family.” (CRC/C/2/
Rev.8, p. 36)
The Committee welcomed Poland’s intention to 
review its declarations and reservations with a 
view to considering withdrawal. It went on to say: 
“The Committee is concerned that traditional 
attitudes still prevailing in the country may not 
be conducive to the realization of the general 
principles of the Convention, including, 
in particular, article 2 (principle of non-
discrimination), article 3 (principle of the best 
interests of the child) and article 12 (respect 
for the views of the child).” (Poland CRC/C/15/
Add.31, para. 12)
When the Committee examined Poland’s Second 
Report in 2002, it encouraged the State to “con-
tinue and complete” the process of withdrawing 
all of its reservations to and declarations on the 
Convention (Poland CRC/C/15/Add.194, paras. 9 
and 10).
The child who is “capable of 
forming his or her own views”: 
article 12(1)
Article 12 does not set any lower age limit on 
children’s right to express views freely. It is clear 
that children can and do form views from a very 
early age, and the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child provides no support to those who would 
impose a lower age limit on the ascertainment or 
consideration of children’s views. In its General 
Comment No. 7 on “Implementing child rights 
in early childhood”, the Committee encourages 
States Parties to construct a positive agenda for 
rights in early childhood:
“A shift away from traditional beliefs that 
regard early childhood mainly as a period for 
the socialization of the immature human being 
towards mature adult status is required. The 
Convention requires that children, including 
the very youngest children, be respected as 
persons in their own right. Young children 
should be recognized as active members of 
families, communities and societies, with their 
own concerns, interests and points of view.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 7, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 5) 
The Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 1997, 
states: “Pursuant to the provisions of this article, 
States Parties have a clear and precise obligation 
to assure to the child the right to have a say in situ-
ations that may affect him or her. The child should 
therefore not be envisaged as a passive human 
being or allowed to be deprived of such right of 
intervention, unless he or she would clearly be 
incapable of forming his or her views. This right 
should therefore be ensured and respected even in 
situations where the child would be able to form 
views and yet be unable to communicate them, or 
when the child is not yet fully mature or has not 
yet attained a particular older age, since his or her 
views are to be taken into consideration ‘in accor-
dance with the age and maturity of the child’...” 
(Manual, p. 426)
Some countries reported that they had set a mini-
mum age on the right of the child to be heard, for 
example in custody proceedings following sepa-
ration or divorce of parents, but the Convention 
provides no support for this, and States can-
not quote the best interests principle to prevent 
children having an opportunity to express their 
views.
The Committee commented, for example, to 
Finland:
“The Committee expresses its concern that the 
views of children, in particular those below 
12 years of age, are not always taken into full 
consideration, especially in child custody cases 
and access disputes taken to court. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party make sure that the views of children 
under 12 years of age who are affected by 
a judicial proceeding are always heard, if 
they are considered to be mature enough, 
and that this takes place in a child-friendly 
environment. It also recommends that the 
State Party undertake a regular review of the 
extent to which children’s views are taken 
into consideration and of their impact on 
policy-making and court decisions, programme 
implementation and on children themselves.” 
(Finland CRC/C/15/Add.132, paras. 29 and 30)
When it examined Finland’s Third Report, it fur-
ther noted:
“The Committee notes the information on the 
rules for hearing children in legal procedures, 
for example in custody or child protection 
measures, but it is concerned at the fact that 
only children aged 15 and older have the right 
to be heard directly by the judge/court. Below 
that age, it is left to the discretion of the 
judge whether to hear the child directly. When 
this is not done and the views of children 
are submitted to the court via a third party, 
sometimes this is done without the child being 
heard by that third party.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take legislative and other measures to 
ensure that article 12 of the Convention is fully

implemented, in particular that the child has 
the right to express his/her views directly to 
the judge when decisions in judicial and/or 
administrative proceedings affecting the child 
have to be taken.” (Finland CRC/C/15/Add.272, 
paras. 22 and 23)
It suggested that Lithuania should
“… effectively promote and encourage 
respect for the views of children below the 
age of 12 years, according to his/her evolving 
capacities;…” (Lithuania CRC/C/LTU/CO/2, 
para. 32 (c))
And it encouraged Albania to
“… provide educational information 
to parents, teachers and headmasters, 
government administrative officials, the 
judiciary, children themselves and society at 
large with a view to creating an encouraging 
atmosphere in which children, including those 
below the age of 10 years, can freely express 
their views, and where, in turn, these are given 
due weight.” (Albania CRC/C/125/Add.249, 
para. 31) 
The “right to express those views 
freely”
There are no boundaries on the obligation of 
States Parties to assure the child the right to 
express views freely. In particular, this empha-
sizes that there is no area of traditional parental or 
adult authority – the home or school for example 
– in which children’s views have no place. 
Respect for the views and feelings of the young child 
“Article 12 states that the child has a right to express his or her views freely in all matters affect-
ing the child, and to have them taken into account. This right reinforces the status of the young 
child as an active participant in the promotion, protection and monitoring of their rights. Respect 
for the young child’s agency – as a participant in family, community and society – is frequently 
overlooked, or rejected as inappropriate on the grounds of age and immaturity. In many countries 
and regions, traditional beliefs have emphasized young children’s need for training and socializa-
tion. They have been regarded as undeveloped, lacking even basic capacities for understanding, 
communicating and making choices. They have been powerless within their families, and often 
voiceless and invisible within society. The Committee wishes to emphasize that article 12 applies 
both to younger and to older children. As holders of rights, even the youngest children are entitled 
to express their views, which should be “given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity 
of the child” (art. 12.1). Young children are acutely sensitive to their surroundings and very rap-
idly acquire understanding of the people, places and routines in their lives, along with awareness 
of their own unique identity. They make choices and communicate their feelings, ideas and wishes 
in numerous ways, long before they are able to communicate through the conventions of spoken or 
written language. In this regard:
(a) The Committee encourages States Parties to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the 
concept of the child as rights holder with freedom to express views and the right to be con-
sulted in matters that affect him or her is implemented from the earliest stage in ways appropri-
ate to the child’s capacities, best interests, and rights to protection from harmful experiences;
(b) The right to express views and feelings should be anchored in the child’s daily life at home 
(including, when applicable, the extended family) and in his or her community; within the full 
range of early childhood health, care and education facilities, as well as in legal proceedings; 
and in the development of policies and services, including through research and consultations;
(c) States Parties should take all appropriate measures to promote the active involvement of 
parents, professionals and responsible authorities in the creation of opportunities for young 
children to progressively exercise their rights within their everyday activities in all relevant 
settings, including by providing training in the necessary skills. To achieve the right of par-
ticipation requires adults to adopt a child-centred attitude, listening to young children and 
respecting their dignity and their individual points of view. It also requires adults to show 
patience and creativity by adapting their expectations to a young child’s interests, levels of 
understanding and preferred ways of communicating.”

RESPECT FOR THE VIEWS OF THE CHILD

In article 13 (see page 177), the right is re-stated 
and developed to include the right to “seek, 
receive and impart information and ideas of all 
kinds”.
It should be emphasized that article 12 implies 
no obligation on the child to express views. 
“Freely” implies without either coercion or con-
straint: “The child has the right to express views 
freely. He or she should therefore not suffer any 
pressure, constraint or influence that might pre-
vent such expression or indeed even require 
it.” (Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 1997,
p. 426)
“In all matters affecting the child” 
There are few areas of family, community, 
regional, national or international decision-
making that do not affect children. When the pro-
posal to include the child’s right to express views 
was first discussed in the Working Group draft-
ing the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
text referred to the right of the child to “express 
his opinion in matters concerning his own person, 
and in particular marriage, choice of occupation, 
medical treatment, education and recreation”. But 
most delegations felt that the matters on which 
States Parties should enable children to express 
opinions “should not be subject to the limits of a 
list, and therefore the list ought to be deleted” (E/
CN.4/1349*, p. 3 and E/CN.4/L.1575, pp. 13 and 
14; Detrick, pp. 224 and 225).
The reference to “all matters” shows that the par-
ticipatory rights are not limited to matters spe-
cifically dealt with under the Convention. As the 
Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 1997, com-
ments: “The right recognized in article 12 is to 
be assured in relation to all matters affecting the 
child. It should apply in all questions, even those 
that might not be specifically covered by the 
Convention, whenever those same questions have 
a particular interest for the child or may affect his 
or her life...
“The right of the child to express views therefore 
applies in relation to family matters, for instance 
in case of adoption, in school life, for instance 
when a decision of expulsion of the child is under 
consideration, or in relation to relevant events tak-
ing place at the community level, such as when a 
decision is taken on the location of playgrounds 
for children or the prevention of traffic accidents 
is being considered. The intention is therefore to 
ensure that the views of the child are a relevant 
factor in all decisions affecting him or her and to 
stress that no implementation system may be car-
ried out and be effective without the intervention 
of children in the decisions affecting their lives.” 
(Manual, pp. 426 and 427)
In its General Comment No. 5 on “General mea-
sures of implementation for the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44, para. 
6)”, the Committee notes that the principle of 
article 12,
“... which highlights the role of the child as an 
active participant in the promotion, protection 
and monitoring of his or her rights, applies 
equally to all measures adopted by States to 
implement the Convention.” (CRC/GC/2003/5, 
para. 12. For more discussion of article 12 in relation 
to government and overall policy-making and in 
other settings, see page 162.)
“... the views of the child being 
given due weight in accordance with  
the age and maturity of the child”
These words provide an active obligation to lis-
ten to children’s views and to take them seriously. 
Again, they are in accordance with the concept of 
the evolving capacities of the child, introduced in 
article 5. In deciding how much weight to give to 
a child’s views in a particular matter, the twin cri-
teria of age and maturity must be considered. Age 
on its own is not the criterion; the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child rejects specific age bar-
riers to the significant participation of children 
in decision-making. Maturity is undefined; it 
implies the ability to understand and assess the 
implications of the matter in question. This in 
turn places obligations on the decision makers to 
give the child sufficient information. 
“For this purpose, the child 
shall in particular be provided 
the opportunity to be heard in 
any judicial and administrative 
proceedings affecting 
the child”: article 12(2)
When originally introduced during the draft-
ing of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
the proposal that children should have a right to 
be heard in judicial and administrative proceed-
ings was linked to the best interests principle, as 
the second paragraph of article 3, but it was then 
moved to take a more logical place with the over-
all participation principle in what was to become 
article 12 (E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 42 to 45; Detrick, 
pp. 226 and 227).
The link between the paragraphs indicates that 
the second paragraph of article 12 applies to chil-
dren “capable of forming views”, again empha-
sizing that very young children should have the 
formal right to be heard. As already noted, the 
Convention provides no support for a set mini-
mum age. For the child to be “provided the oppor-
tunity” implies an active obligation on the State

to offer the child the opportunity to be heard, 
although, again, it is important to emphasize that 
there is no requirement that the child express 
views. Also, “For this purpose…” means that 
courts and other proceedings must not just hear 
children’s views, but also give them due weight 
having regard to age and maturity.
“Any judicial ... proceedings affecting the child” 
covers a very wide range of court hearings, 
including all civil proceedings such as divorce, 
custody, care and adoption proceedings, name-
changing, judicial applications relating to place of 
residence, religion, education, disposal of money 
and so forth, judicial decision-making on nation-
ality, immigration and refugee status, and crimi-
nal proceedings; it also covers States’ involvement 
in international courts. Arguably, it covers crimi-
nal prosecutions of parents, the outcome of which 
can affect children dramatically. 
The reference to “administrative proceedings” 
broadens the scope still further and certainly 
includes, for example, formal decision-making 
in education, health, planning and environmental 
decisions, social security, child protection, alter-
native care, employment and administration of 
juvenile justice.
In its General Comment No. 5 on “General mea-
sures of implementation for the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44, para. 
6)”, the Committee highlights that for rights to 
have meaning, effective remedies must be avail-
able to redress violations: 
“This requirement is implicit in the Convention 
and consistently referred to in the other six 
major international human rights treaties. 
Children’s special and dependent status creates 
real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies 
for breaches of their rights. So States need 
to give particular attention to ensuring that 
there are effective, child-sensitive procedures 
available to children and their representatives. 
These should include the provision of child-
friendly information, advice, advocacy, 
including support for self-advocacy, and access 
to independent complaints procedures and 
to the courts with necessary legal and other 
assistance.” (CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 24. See article 
4, page 55.)
The Committee addresses article 12(2) in detail 
in recommendations adopted following its Day of 
General Discussion on “The right of the child to 
be heard”:
“The Committee reminds States Parties that 
the right of the child to be heard in judicial 
and administrative proceedings applies to all 
relevant settings without limitation, including 
children separated from their parents, custody 
and adoption cases, children in conflict with 
the law, children victims of physical violence, 
sexual abuse or other violent crimes, asylum- 
seeking and refugee children and children who 
have been the victims of armed conflict and in 
emergencies.
“The Committee affirms that all children 
involved in judicial and administrative 
proceedings must be informed in a child-
friendly manner about their right to be heard, 
modalities of doing so and other aspects of the 
proceedings.
“The Committee advises States Parties to 
provide all relevant professional categories 
involved in judicial and administrative 
proceedings with mandatory training on the 
implications of article 12 of the Convention. 
Judges and other decision makers should, as a 
rule, explicitly state and explain the outcome 
of the proceedings, especially if the views of 
the child could not be accommodated….
“The Committee requests that States Parties 
establish specialized legal aid support systems 
in order to provide children involved in 
administrative and judicial proceedings with 
qualified support and assistance.” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, Report on the forty-third 
session, September 2006, Day of General Discussion, 
Recommendations, paras. 34 to 36 and 38) 
There is an increasingly recognized need to adapt 
courts and other formal decision-making bodies 
to enable children to participate. For court hear-
ings this could include innovations such as more 
informality in the physical design of the court and 
the clothing of the judges and lawyers, the video-
taping of evidence, sight screens, separate wait-
ing rooms and the special preparation of child 
witnesses (see also article 19, page 269). In 2005, 
the Economic and Social Council of the United 
Nations adopted Guidelines on Justice in Matters 
involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime. 
These reiterate children’s right to participation 
and define “child sensitive” as an approach that 
“balances the child’s right to protection and that 
takes into account the child’s individual needs 
and views” (para. 9(d)). The Guidelines provides 
both principles and a framework “that could 
assist Member States in enhancing the protection 
of child victims and witnesses in the criminal jus-
tice system” (Economic and Social Council, reso-
lution 2005/20, annex). The Committee draws 
States’ attention to the Guidelines. For example, 
it expressed concern that in Thailand,
“... respect for the views of the child may not 
be fully taken into account in court processes 
involving children either as victims, witnesses 
or alleged offenders”. 
It recommended that Thailand should 
“... improve child-sensitive court procedures”

in accordance with the Guidelines (Thailand 
CRC/C/THA/CO/2, paras. 29 and 30).
The Committee expresses concern when chil-
dren, or children below a certain age, do not 
have unfettered access to the courts. In recom-
mendations adopted following its Day of General 
Discussion on “The right of the child to be heard”, 
the Committee states:
“The Committee affirms that age should not 
be a barrier to the child’s right to participate 
fully in the justice process. In cases when 
States Parties have established a minimum 
age for the right of the child to be heard, 
measures should be taken to ensure that the 
views of the child below the minimum age be 
considered in accordance with the maturity of 
the child by specially trained social workers or 
other professionals.
“The Committee further notes that age should 
not be an impediment for the child to access 
complaints mechanisms within the justice 
system and administrative proceedings.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on the 
forty-third session, September 2006, Day of General 
Discussion, Recommendations, paras. 51 and 52) 
It frequently raises age barriers with States. For 
example: 
“… the Committee remains concerned at 
inconsistencies in legislation as well as the 
fact that in practice, the interpretation of 
the legislation, and determination of which 
child is “capable of discernment”, may leave 
possibilities of denying a child this right or 
make it subject to the child’s own request and 
may give rise to discrimination. In addition, the 
Committee is concerned at the conclusion of 
the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography that, 
in practice, most judges are not willing to hear 
children and that, in the past, justice has failed 
child victims of sexual abuse (E/CN.4/2004/9/
Add.1, paras. 85 and 89).
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party review legislation with a view to 
removing inconsistencies related to the respect 
for the views of the child.” (France CRC/C/15/
Add.240, paras. 21 and 22)
“The Committee notes with concern that in 
mainland China children are not able to file 
complaints in court or be consulted directly by 
the courts without parental consent, except in 
the case of children 16 years or older who earn 
their own livelihood... 
“Furthermore, the Committee recommends 
that on the mainland the State Party review 
legislation affecting children with a view to 
ensuring that they are given the opportunity 
to be heard in any judicial and administrative 
proceeding affecting them, and that due 
weight is given to their views in accordance 
with the age and maturity of the child...” 
(China CRC/C/CHN/CO/2, paras. 37 and 40)
Similarly, the Committee noted in Belgium,
“With respect to court or administrative 
proceedings affecting the child,… the right to 
be heard is largely discretionary, … , and is not 
adequately guaranteed to the child…
“The Committee recommends … that 
legislation governing procedure in courts and 
administrative proceedings ensure that a child 
capable of forming his/her own views has the 
right to express those views and that they are 
given due weight.” (Belgium CRC/C/15/Add.178, 
paras. 21 and 22)
In examining Chile’s Second Report, the 
Committee noted with deep concern that
“… the juvenile judge may impose a protection 
measure on children without summoning them 
to appear when the case does not constitute 
a crime, ordinary offence or minor offence.” 
(Chile CRC/C/15/Add.173, para. 29)
The Committee emphasizes that children’s rights 
under article 12(2) apply equally to religious 
courts, telling Lebanon that it noted with con-
cern that the religious and sharia courts decide 
on issues related to custody and care of the child 
without hearing the child’s opinion. It recom-
mended that Lebanon
“… continue to strengthen its efforts to 
promote respect for the views of all children 
and to facilitate their participation … in 
judicial procedures, including procedures in 
the religious and sharia courts…” (Lebanon 
CRC/C/LBN/CO/3, paras. 35 and 36)
“either directly, or through a repres-
entative or an appropriate body, in a 
manner consistent with the 
procedural rules of national law”
States are left with discretion as to how the child’s 
views should be heard; but where procedural 
rules suggest that this be done through a repre-
sentative or an appropriate body, the obligation 
is to transmit the views of the child. This princi-
ple should not be confused with the obligation in 
article 3 to ensure that the best interests of the 
child are a primary consideration in all actions 
concerning children.
During discussions in the Working Group draft-
ing the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
the explanation of the inclusion of the final quali-
fication – “in a manner consistent with the pro-
cedural rules of national law” – was “that in 
case the hearing of the child’s opinion required 
some international legal assistance, the request-
ing State’s procedure should also be taken into 
account” (E/CN.4/1989/48, pp. 42 to 45; Detrick, 
p. 227). 
The Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 1997, 
emphasizes: “The reference to ‘procedural rules of 
–> Table of Contents

national law’ is intended to stress the need for the 
national law to include specific procedures to allow 
for the implementation of the right as recognized 
by article 12, and naturally not to be interpreted as 
a means of allowing possible inadequate solutions 
contained in the procedural law to prevent the full 
enjoyment of this fundamental right. In fact, such 
an interpretation would again be contrary to article 
4 of the Convention.” (Manual, p. 429)
Complaints procedures. The Committee on 
the Rights of the Child sees the provision of effec-
tive complaints procedures for children as part of 
the implementation of article 12. Children need 
access to complaints procedures in all aspects of 
their lives – in the family, in alternative care, in 
schools and all other institutions, and in services 
and facilities relevant to them. The Committee 
frequently has expressed concern at the lack 
of complaints procedures for children and has 
encouraged States to develop ‘child-friendly’ 
complaints procedures:
“The Committee also expresses concern at 
the absence of an independent mechanism to 
register and address complaints from children 
concerning violations of their rights under 
the Convention. The Committee suggests that 
an independent child-friendly mechanism 
be made accessible to children to deal with 
complaints of violations of their rights and 
to provide remedies for such violations. The 
Committee further suggests that the State 
Party introduce an awareness-raising campaign 
to facilitate the effective use by children of 
such a mechanism.” (Saint Kitts and Nevis 
CRC/C/15/Add.104, para. 13)
In promoting the development of independent 
human rights institutions for children – children’s 
ombudspeople, commissioners and focal points 
on children’s rights in human rights commissions 
– the Committee has encouraged them, where 
appropriate, to provide complaints procedures 
and also to review children’s access to other com-
plaints procedures (see article 4, page 55).
In the context of article 19, the Committee has 
recommended there should be complaints proce-
dures for children suffering violence in and out-
side the family. The Committee has noted that 
children need to be able to complain indepen-
dently of their parents: 
“The Committee is concerned that, since 
children are able to lodge complaints only 
through their parents or legal guardians, the 
right to adequate recourse and complaint 
procedures for children victim of abuse, 
including sexual abuse, neglect or ill-treatment 
within their families does not seem to be 
secured...
“... the Committee recommends that a system 
of complaints aimed at children victims of 
any form of violence, abuse, including sexual 
abuse, neglect, maltreatment or exploitation, 
even while in the care of their parents, be 
established, as a means to ensure protection of 
and respect for their rights.” (Ethiopia 
CRC/C/15/Add.67, paras. 16 and 31)
In its General Comment on “The rights of chil-
dren with disabilities”, the Committee notes the 
particular vulnerability to violence and neglect 
of children with disabilities, in the family and in 
institutions. It suggests that lack of access to a 
functional complaint-receiving, monitoring sys-
tem is conducive to systematic and continuing 
abuse. The Committee urges States to ensure that 
all institutions providing care for children with 
disabilities should have an accessible and sensi-
tive complaint mechanism (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 9, 
2006, CRC/C/GC/9, paras. 42 and 43). 
Strategies for implementing 
participation rights
Participation rights to be reflected 
in domestic legislation
The Committee on the Rights of the Child under-
lines in its General Comment No. 5 on “General 
measures of implementation for the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 and 44, 
para. 6)” that article 12, together with the other 
articles identified as general principles, should be 
incorporated into national laws and procedures 
(CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 12). To reflect both para-
graphs of article 12 in domestic law requires pro-
visions that uphold the right to participation in 
the informal arena of family life, in alternative 
care for children deprived of their family envi-
ronment, in children’s school and community life, 
and specifically in all formal judicial and admin-
istrative proceedings affecting the child. 
In recommendations adopted following its Day of 
General Discussion on “The right of the child to 
be heard”, the Committee urges States
“… to examine all existing laws and 
regulations with a view to ensure that article 
12 is adequately integrated in all relevant 
domestic laws, regulations and administrative 
instructions.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, Report on the forty-third session, 
September 2006, Day of General Discussion, 
Recommendations, para. 42)
States’ reports show that, increasingly, the prin-
ciple of article 12 has been incorporated into 
domestic law, at least in relation to certain areas 
of children’s lives and into certain court hearings. 
The Committee continues to recommend that legal 
reform should reflect article 12. For example:
–> Table of Contents

RESPECT FOR THE VIEWS OF THE CHILD
159
a
r
t
i
c
l
e
“In the light of article 12 of the Convention, 
the Committee is concerned that this general 
principle is not adequately reflected in the 
1996 Rights of the Child Act…” (Armenia 
CRC/C/15/Add.119, para. 26) 
The Committee has also emphasized that legal 
reform should be accompanied by awareness-
raising and training:
“The Committee notes with appreciation 
that the State Party’s domestic legislation 
has integrated provisions guaranteeing the 
participatory rights of children. However, it 
remains concerned that, in practice, these 
rights are not sufficiently implemented at 
the various levels of Costa Rican society. In 
the light of articles 12 to 17 and other related 
articles of the Convention, the Committee 
recommends that further efforts be made 
to ensure the implementation of the 
participatory rights of children, especially their 
rights to participate in the family, at school, 
within other institutions and in society in 
general. Awareness-raising among the public 
at large, as well as educational programmes on 
the implementation of these principles, should 
be reinforced in order to change traditional 
perceptions of children as objects and not as 
subjects of rights.” (Costa Rica CRC/C/15/Add.117, 
para. 16)
It followed this up again following examination 
of Costa Rica’s Third Report:
“The Committee notes with appreciation 
the State Party’s many and various efforts 
to implement and promote the child’s rights 
to express his/her views and to participate 
in decision-making processes and other 
activities regarding his/her position. But 
it also notes the State Party’s concern that 
cultural problems are a factor which impedes 
the implementation of these rights in the 
family.
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party undertake further and targeted 
measures to promote the child’s rights to 
express his/her views freely within the family 
context and in institutions such as shelters and 
other institutions for children. The Committee 
further recommends that the State Party 
ensure that the child’s view is taken into 
account in any proceedings dealing with child 
issues. The Committee further recommends 
that the media take into account the views of 
the child. Finally, the Committee recommends 
that the State Party take the necessary steps 
to promote awareness among children and 
adolescents of their participatory rights in 
the family, at school, within other institutions 
and in society in general through educational 
programmes on the implementation of these 
principles, and strengthen their opportunity 
to participate.” (Costa Rica CRC/C/15/Add.266, 
paras. 21 and 22)
Right to information – a prerequisite 
for participation
As the Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 
1997, makes clear “... the child should be provided 
with the necessary information about the possi-
ble existing options and the consequences aris-
ing therefrom. In fact, a decision can only be free 
once it is also an informed decision.” (Manual, 
p. 426) 
Article 13 asserts the child’s freedom to “seek, 
receive and impart information and ideas of all 
kinds...” (see page 177). And, in addition, article 17 
asserts the child’s general right to information (see 
page 217). But in relation to the various decision-
making arenas in which the child’s views could be 
expressed – family, school, community, court and 
so on – there is an implied obligation to ensure that 
the child is appropriately informed about the cir-
cumstances and the options.
In recommendations adopted following its Day 
of General Discussion on “The right of the child 
to be heard”, the Committee reaffirms the links 
between article 12 and article 13,
“… as the right to receive and impart 
information is an important pre-requisite 
to realize participation of children. The 
Committee urges States Parties to consider 
developing child-friendly information in 
relation to all matters affecting children.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the forty-third session, September 2006, Day of 
General Discussion, Recommendations, para. 12)
Participation rights without 
discrimination
In conjunction with the anti-discrimination prin-
ciple in article 2 (page 17), article 12 emphasizes 
the equal right of all children to express views 
freely and have them taken seriously. 
The need for special measures to combat poten-
tial discrimination in participation is highlighted 
in the recommendations adopted following the 
Committee’s Day of General Discussion on “The 
right of the child to be heard”: 
“The Committee stresses that appropriate 
measures need to be undertaken in order 
to address discrimination of vulnerable or 
marginalized groups of children such as those 
affected by poverty or armed conflict, children 
without parental care, including children in 
institutions, children with disabilities, refugee 
and displaced children, street children and 
children belonging to indigenous and minority 
groups, in order for all children to enjoy the 
right enshrined in article 12…
“The Committee urges States Parties to pay 
special attention to the right of the girl child 
as sexist stereotypes and patriarchal values

undermine and place severe limitations on the 
enjoyment of the right set forth in article 12.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the forty-third session, September 2006, Day of 
General Discussion, Recommendations, paras. 8 
and 10)
In comments on States’ reports, the Committee 
has emphasized that children with varied social 
and regional backgrounds should be encouraged 
to participate, with special attention to vulnera-
ble groups. The need to ensure the participation 
of indigenous children in the design, implemen-
tation and evaluation of strategies, policies and 
projects aimed at implementing their rights is 
stressed in the recommendations adopted follow-
ing the Committee’s Day of General Discussion 
on “The rights of indigenous children” (Report 
on the thirty-fourth session, September/October 
2003, CRC/C/133, Recommendations, p. 134, 
para. 8).
The participation of children with disabilities 
without discrimination may require the produc-
tion of materials in special media and the pro-
vision of special technology, interpreters (for 
example signing for deaf and partially hearing 
children) and special training, including of other 
children, parents and other family members, 
teachers and other adults. The Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted 
in December 2006, requires (article 7(3)): “States 
Parties shall ensure that children with disabilities 
have the right to express their views freely on all 
matters affecting them, their views being given 
due weight in accordance with their age and 
maturity, on an equal basis with other children, 
and to be provided with disability and age-appro-
priate assistance to realize that right.” Article 21, 
on freedom of expression and opinion, and access 
to information, details measures that States 
should take to ensure that persons with disabili-
ties can exercise these rights.
The Committee expands on this from the per-
spective of children in its General Comment No. 
9 on “The rights of children with disabilities”:
“More often than not, adults with and without 
disabilities make policies and decisions related 
to children with disabilities while the children 
themselves are left out of the process. It is 
essential that children with disabilities are 
heard in all procedures affecting them and 
that their views be respected in accordance 
with their evolving capacities. This should 
include their representation in various bodies 
such as parliament, committees and other 
forums where they voice views and participate 
in making the decisions that affect them 
as children in general and as children with 
disabilities specifically. Engaging them in such 
a process not only ensures that the policies are 
targeted to their needs and desires, it is also a 
valuable tool of inclusion since it ensures that 
the decision-making process is a participatory 
one. Children should be equipped with 
whatever mode of communication to facilitate 
expressing their views. Furthermore, States 
Parties should support the development 
of training for families and professionals 
on promoting and respecting the evolving 
capacities of children to take increasing 
responsibilities for decision-making in their 
own lives.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 9, 2006, CRC/C/GC/9, 
para. 15)
The Platform for Action of the Fourth World 
Conference on Women states that: “Girls are less 
encouraged than boys to participate in and learn 
about the social, economic and political func-
tioning of society, with the result that they are 
not offered the same opportunities as boys to 
take part in decision-making processes” (Fourth 
World Conference on Women, Beijing, 1995, 
Platform for Action, A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1, para. 
265). This demands educational and other strate-
gies to ensure girls have equal rights to participa-
tion and to respect for their views.
In 1997, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women adopted a General 
Recommendation on political and public life. 
This emphasizes the importance of States taking 
all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimi-
nation against women in political and public life 
and provides detailed proposals (but surprisingly 
does not highlight the importance of promoting 
girls’ participation rights, including in education) 
(Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women, General Recommendation No. 
23, 1997, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, p. 318).
Implementation not dependent 
on resources
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
emphasized that implementation of the general 
principles of the Convention, including article 
12, cannot be dependent on resources. Article 4 
of the Convention states that with regard to eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights, States Parties 
shall undertake measures for implementation 
“to the maximum extent of available resources”, 
accepting the inevitability of progressive imple-
mentation of these rights in some States. But 
this does not apply to civil and political rights 
including the obligations under article 12.
Education, training and other 
strategies to promote the child’s 
participation
The Committee recognizes that legal frame-
works alone, although essential, will not achieve

the necessary changes in attitudes and practice 
within families, schools or communities. So it 
has encouraged a variety of other strategies for 
implementation of article 12, including in par-
ticular education (proposing as a key strategy the 
incorporation of the Convention within the school 
curriculum) and information programmes, and 
systematic training of all those working with and 
for children. 
In recommendations adopted following its Day of 
General Discussion on “The right of the child to 
be heard”, the Committee reminds States Parties 
“… of the need to provide training on the 
rights of the child to all public officials who 
influence government policy and implement 
programmes which involve children’s issues 
in order to promote awareness of the rights 
of the child and the obligation of taking 
children’s views into account.” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, Report on the forty-
third session, September 2006, Day of General 
Discussion, Recommendations, para. 29) 
It also promotes parent education including on the 
rights of the child (para. 17) and teacher training 
to include participatory teaching methodologies 
(para. 24).
In Concluding Observations, the Committee 
frequently proposes comprehensive awareness-
raising and public education. For example:
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party develop a systematic approach 
to increasing public awareness of the 
participatory rights of children in the best 
interests of the child, particularly at the local 
levels and in traditional communities, with 
the involvement of community and village 
leaders, and ensure that the views of the 
child are heard and taken into consideration 
in accordance with their age and maturity 
in families, communities, schools, care 
institutions, and the judicial and administrative 
systems. In that regard, the Committee 
recommends that the State Party launch 
campaigns to change the traditional attitude 
and values which do not allow children to 
express their views.” (Malawi CRC/C/15/Add.174, 
para. 30)
“In the light of article 12, the Committee 
recommends that the State Party:...
(c) Undertake campaigns to make children, 
parents, professionals working with and for 
children and the public at large aware that 
children have the right to be heard and to 
have their views taken seriously.” (Argentina 
CRC/C/15/Add.187, para. 33)
“The Committee encourages the State Party to 
pursue its efforts:...
(b) To provide educational information to, 
among others, parents, teachers, government 
administrative officials, the judiciary, 
traditional leaders and society at large on 
children’s rights to participate and to have 
their views taken into consideration…” (Burkina 
Faso CRC/C/15/Add.193, para. 27)
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party:... 
(b) Provide educational information to, 
among others, parents, teachers, government 
administrative officials, the judiciary, the 
Roman Catholic Church and other religious 
groups, and society at large, on children’s right 
to have their views taken into account and to 
participate in matters affecting them.” (Poland 
CRC/C/15/Add.184, para. 31) 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party:… 
(c) Develop skills-training programmes in 
community settings for parents, teachers, 
social workers and local officials to encourage 
children to express their informed views 
and opinions, and to have those views taken 
into consideration (e.g. using the brochure 
‘They who will inherit the land … cannot be 
heard’).” (Iceland CRC/C/15/Add.203, para. 27)
Within 
the 
overall 
obligation 
under 
the 
Convention’s article 42 to make the principles 
and provisions widely known by appropriate 
and active means to adults and children alike, 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
stressed participatory rights and the importance 
of actively involving children themselves in strat-
egies to fulfil article 42 (see page 627).
Monitoring implementation
and impact
The Committee proposes that States should 
review the extent of implementation of article 12, 
which implies asking children themselves about 
the degree to which their views are heard and 
respected, including within the family. It has sug-
gested that the work of children’s parliaments and 
similar institutions should be evaluated to con-
sider what impact they have on national policy 
(see below, page 163). 
For example, the Committee urged Mexico to:
“… (d) Regularly review the extent to which 
children participate in the development and 
evaluation of laws and policies affecting them, 
both at national and local levels, and evaluate 
the extent to which children’s views are taken 
into consideration, including their impact on 
relevant policies and programmes.” (Mexico 
CRC/C/MEX/CO/3, para. 28)
Lithuania was recommended to: 
“… (e) undertake a regular review of the 
extent to which children’s views are taken 
into consideration and of the impact this has 
–> Table of Contents

162
on policy, programme implementation and 
on children themselves.” (Lithuania CRC/C/LTU/
CO/2, para. 32(e))
And Algeria was encouraged to:
“… undertake a regular review of the extent 
to which children’s views are taken into 
consideration and of their impact on policy-
making, court decisions and programme 
implementation...” (Algeria CRC/C/15/Add.269, 
para. 34) 
Implementation in different 
settings
Within government, and in overall 
policy-making
The participation of children at all levels of 
policy-making has been encouraged by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. As the 
Committee notes in its General Comment No. 5 
on “General measures of implementation for the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 42 
and 44, para. 6)”:
“Article 12 of the Convention … requires due 
weight to be given to children’s views in all 
matters affecting them, which plainly includes 
implementation of ‘their’ Convention.” 
(CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 57)
For all States, this remains a relatively new chal-
lenge, with no real blueprints on how best to 
achieve meaningful participation, so experiment 
is needed.
In its General Comment, the Committee empha-
sizes that the development of a children’s rights 
perspective throughout Government, parliament 
and the judiciary is required for effective imple-
mentation of the whole Convention, highlighting 
in particular the articles in the Convention iden-
tified by the Committee as general principles, 
including article 12: 
“This principle, which highlights the role of the 
child as an active participant in the promotion, 
protection and monitoring of his or her rights, 
applies equally to all measures adopted by 
States to implement the Convention. 
“Opening government decision-making 
processes to children is a positive challenge 
which the Committee finds States are 
increasingly responding to. Given that few 
States as yet have reduced the voting age 
below 18, there is all the more reason to 
ensure respect for the views of unenfranchised 
children in Government and parliament. If 
consultation is to be meaningful, documents as 
well as processes need to be made accessible. 
But appearing to ’listen’ to children is 
relatively unchallenging; giving due weight 
to their views requires real change. Listening 
to children should not be seen as an end in 
itself, but rather as a means by which States 
make their interactions with children and 
their actions on behalf of children ever more 
sensitive to the implementation of children’s 
rights.
“One-off or regular events like Children’s 
Parliaments can be stimulating and raise 
general awareness. But article 12 requires 
consistent and ongoing arrangements. 
Involvement of and consultation with 
children must also avoid being tokenistic 
and aim to ascertain representative views. 
The emphasis on ‘matters that affect them’ 
in article 12(1) implies the ascertainment of 
the views of particular groups of children 
on particular issues – for example children 
who have experience of the juvenile justice 
system on proposals for law reform in that 
area, or adopted children and children 
in adoptive families on adoption law and 
policy. It is important that Governments 
develop a direct relationship with children, 
not simply one mediated through non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) or human 
rights institutions. In the early years of the 
Convention, NGOs played a notable role in 
pioneering participatory approaches with 
children, but it is in the interests of both 
Governments and children to have appropriate 
direct contact.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 5, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 12)
The Committee expands on children’s partici-
pation in general measures of implementation 
in the recommendations adopted following its 
Day of General Discussion on “The right of the 
child to be heard”. These include proposing that 
the permanent governmental body identified as 
having responsibility for children’s rights should 
establish direct contact with children, as should 
national human rights institutions, and that chil-
dren should be involved in planning, design, 
implementation and evaluation of national plans 
and in monitoring: 
“… The Committee calls on States Parties to 
comply with their obligation to ensure that 
child participation is taken into account in 
resource allocation and that mechanisms to 
facilitate the participation of children be 
institutionalized as a tool for implementation.
“The Committee calls for States Parties to 
clearly designate which authority has the 
key responsibility in the implementation of 
children’s rights and ensure that this entity 
establishes direct contact with child- and 
youth-led organizations in order to engage 
with them. 
“The Committee recommends that 
independent national human rights 
institutions and/or children’s ombudsmen 
or commissioners ensure that children are 
given easy access to raise their concerns and

that adequate resources are dedicated to 
involve children in their monitoring of the 
implementation of children’s rights.
“The Committee recommends that children 
and youth be directly included in the planning, 
design, implementation and evaluation of 
National Plans of Action which relate to 
children’s rights, in recognition of their role 
as core stakeholders in the process. Such an 
open consultation can ensure that National 
Plans of Action for the implementation of 
children’s rights are fully relevant for children.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on the 
forty-third session, September 2006, Day of General 
Discussion, Recommendations, paras. 25 to 28)
The Committee also proposes involvement of 
children in law reform and in promoting ratifica-
tion of relevant international human rights instru-
ments:
“The Committee notes the role that can be 
played by children in reviewing domestic 
legislation and advocating for legal reform 
in order to ensure that the principle of 
participation is adequately reflected in 
legislation, for example in the Family Code and 
the Criminal Code. In countries that have yet to 
adopt a Children’s Code, the active promotion 
for legislative change by children themselves 
can play a catalysing role. Furthermore, 
organized youth participation can make 
important contributions to promotion of 
the ratification of international human 
rights instruments.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, Report on the forty-third session, 
September 2006, Day of General Discussion, 
Recommendations, para. 32)
The Committee has recommended formal struc-
tures for children’s participation, including at 
national level. For example, it recommended that 
China should 
“... consider establishing a standing body 
to represent children’s views in the political 
process.” (China CRC/C/CHN/CO/2, para. 41)
And it recommended that Tanzania should 
 “... formalize structures of participation for 
children and young people, and in particular 
… provide support to the Junior Council, so 
that the Council can function effectively as the 
nationally representative body for children…” 
(United Republic of Tanzania CRC/C/TZA/CO/2, 
para. 30)
There are many possible forms of participation 
in policy development and the process of govern-
ment: consultation with children as stakeholders, 
opinion polling among children, on-line consulta-
tion projects, child-citizen juries, standing advi-
sory panels of children, questionnaires and so on.
In its General Comment No. 2 on “The role of 
independent national human rights institutions in 
the promotion and protection of the rights of the 
child”, the Committee highlights the relevance of 
article 12:
“NHRIs [national human rights institutions] 
have a key role to play in promoting respect 
for the views of children in all matters 
affecting them, as articulated in article 12 
of the Convention, by Government and 
throughout society. This general principle 
should be applied to the establishment, 
organization and activities of national human 
rights institutions. Institutions must ensure 
that they have direct contact with children and 
that children are appropriately involved and 
consulted. Children’s councils, for example, 
could be created as advisory bodies for NHRIs 
to facilitate the participation of children in 
matters of concern to them. 
“NHRIs should devise specially tailored 
consultation programmes and imaginative 
communication strategies to ensure full 
compliance with article 12 of the Convention. 
A range of suitable ways in which children can 
communicate with the institution should be 
established.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 2, 2002, 
CRC/GC/2002/2, paras. 16 and 17)
Children’s parliaments. The Committee has 
welcomed the establishment of children’s parlia-
ments as one participation strategy, but it has also 
noted that implementation of article 12 requires 
consistent and on-going, rather than one-off, 
events. So in recommendations adopted follow-
ing its Day of General Discussion on “The right 
of the child to be heard”, it urges States Parties 
“… to move from an events-based approach 
of the right to participation to systematic 
inclusion in policy matters in order to ensure 
that children can express their views and 
effectively participate in all matters affecting 
them.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
Report on the forty-third session, September 2006, 
Day of General Discussion, Recommendations, 
para. 25) 
The Committee goes on to note:
“The Committee recognizes as positive the step 
taken in numerous countries by the creation 
of child parliaments at national, regional and 
local levels, as such initiatives offer valuable 
insight of the democratic process and establish 
links between children and decision makers. 
The Committee however urges States Parties 
to establish clear guidelines on how the views 
presented by children in such forums are taken 
into account by the formal political process 
and policy-making and ensure that children are 
provided with adequate response in relation to 
their proposals.” (Recommendations, para. 30)
It has emphasized that children’s parliaments and 
similar structures should as far as possible be

representative, and it has encouraged evaluation 
of the impact of such bodies on policy develop-
ment. For example, the Committee recommended 
that Togo should 
“Evaluate and assess the functioning of 
the Children’s Parliament and its impact on 
decision-making, and provide guidance and 
support for the continuation of its activities 
in a democratic manner…” (Togo CRC/C/15/
Add.255, para. 33)
And it urged Greece, Gabon and Burkina Faso to: 
“… Ensure that the Youth Parliament is 
representative of all sectors of the State Party’s 
child population, including children from 
distinct ethnic, religious, linguistic or cultural 
groups.” (Greece CRC/C/15/Add.170, para. 39(b)) 
“… Promote the activities and take duly into 
consideration the decisions of the Children’s 
Parliament and take care that all groups of 
children are represented.” (Gabon CRC/C/15/
Add.171, para. 28; Burkina Faso CRC/C/15/Add.193, 
para. 27)
When the Committee examined Nigeria’s Second 
Report, it noted with appreciation the high-level 
interministerial delegation sent by the State Party, 
“... as well as the participation of the speaker 
of the Children’s Parliament which gave a 
clearer understanding of the situation of 
children in the State Party.” (Nigeria CRC/C/15/
Add.257, para. 2)
Voting rights. The Committee has not as yet 
explored the relevance of article 12 to the vot-
ing age, set in most States at or above the age of 
majority. But it does note in its General Comment 
No. 5 on “General measures of implementation for 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 4, 
42 and 44, para. 6)” (see above, page 162): 
“Given that few States as yet have reduced 
the voting age below 18, there is all the more 
reason to ensure respect for the views of 
unenfranchised children in Government and 
parliament.” (CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 12) 
And following its Day of General Discussion 
on “The right of the child to be heard”, the 
Committee recommends:
“… that States Parties take into account 
children’s participation in the community 
at different levels and notes that in certain 
contexts apparent inconsistencies arise, such as 
when children below the age of 18 are subject 
to military service yet are not eligible to vote.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the forty-third session, September 2006, Day of 
General Discussion, Recommendations, para. 38)
A General Comment by the Human Rights 
Committee on the right to participate in public 
affairs, voting rights and the right of equal access 
to public service (article 25 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) does not 
directly consider the issue of voting age, merely 
stating that voting should be available to “every 
adult citizen”. It states that: “Any conditions 
which apply to the exercise of the rights pro-
tected by article 25 should be based on objective 
and reasonable criteria. For example, it may be 
reasonable to require a higher age for election or 
appointment to particular offices than for exercis-
ing the right to vote, which should be available to 
every adult citizen.” (Human Rights Committee, 
General Comment No. 25, 1996, HRI/GEN/1/
Rev.8, para. 4, p. 208)
In local government and services, 
including planning, housing, 
the environment
The Committee encourages participation of chil-
dren in decision-making in local government and 
in the planning, implementation and monitoring 
of local services. In recommendations adopted 
following the General Discussion on “The right 
of the child to be heard”, the Committee 
“… calls on children to actively engage in local 
policy issues which relate to budget allocations 
for example in the areas of education, health, 
working conditions for youth and violence 
prevention.” (Recommendations, para. 31) 
The Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 1997, 
uses, as examples of implementation of article 
12 at the community level, the involvement of 
children when decisions are being made about 
the location of playgrounds or the prevention of 
traffic accidents, and specifically refers to chil-
dren’s involvement in local councils. (Manual, 
p. 427)
The report of the Second United Nations 
Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) 
states that “Special attention needs to be paid to 
the participatory processes dealing with the shap-
ing of cities, towns and neighbourhoods; this is in 
order to secure the living conditions of children 
and of youth and to make use of their insight, cre-
ativity and thoughts on the environment.” (United 
Nations Conference on Human Settlements 
(Habitat II), A/CONF.165/14, p. 15)
The Committee has recommended, for example 
to Norway:
“The Committee commends the State 
Party for its efforts to respect the rights of 
children to have their views heard including, 
notably, through the appointment of child 
representatives at a municipal level. The 
Committee joins the State Party in expressing 
concern, however, that in practice children’s 
views are insufficiently heard and taken into 
–> Table of Contents

e
consideration. The Committee is concerned 
that many children are not aware of their 
rights in this domain under the Convention 
and national laws, or of the opportunities 
which have been created for their views to be 
expressed. 
“Taking note of the State Party’s recent 
commitments, the Committee recommends 
that the State Party continue its efforts to 
inform children and others, including parents 
and legal professionals, of children’s right to 
express their views and of the mechanisms 
and other opportunities which exist for this 
purpose. The Committee recommends, further, 
that the State Party undertake a regular 
review of the extent to which children’s views 
are taken into consideration and of the impact 
this has on policy, programme implementation 
and on children themselves.” (Norway CRC/C/15/
Add.126, paras. 24 and 25)
In child protection
Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child sets out various measures for ensuring the 
protection of the child from all forms of violence 
and abuse. In each case, both before and during 
any protection measures and in the planning, 
implementation and monitoring of child protec-
tion systems, respect for the views of the child 
is vital. A legal obligation to ascertain children’s 
views and give them due weight should be built 
into child protection legislation and applied to all 
decision-making (see article 19, page 249).
The Committee refers to the participation rights 
of child victims of violence in judicial proceed-
ings in recommendations adopted following its 
Day of General Discussion on “The right of the 
child to be heard”:
“The Committee thus urges States Parties to 
ensure that the views, needs and concerns 
of child victims who have suffered sexual 
abuse or other violent crimes be presented 
and considered in proceedings where their 
personal interests are affected. In addition 
to the rights outlined above for children in 
conflict with the law, States Parties should 
adopt and implement rules and proceedings 
for child victims of physical violence, sexual 
abuse or other violent crimes ensuring that 
repetition of testimonies be avoided by the 
use of video-taped interviews to reduce re-
traumatization, that protective measures, 
health and psychosocial services be made 
available and that unnecessary contact with 
the perpetrator be avoided. The identity of 
the victim should be maintained confidential 
and, when required, the public and the media 
should be excluded from the courtroom during 
the proceedings.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, Report on the forty-third session, 
September 2006, Day of General Discussion, 
Recommendations, para. 48)
Access to an effective complaints procedure 
is an essential element of child protection, and 
because of the extent of parental violence and 
abuse of children, children require access which 
is independent of their parents (see above, page 
158). The Committee has welcomed the develop-
ment of free child helplines, enabling children to 
express concerns in confidence and seek advice 
and help (see, for example, Philippines CRC/C/15/
Add.259, para. 31).
The Agenda for Action adopted at the First World 
Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation 
of Children (Stockholm, Sweden, 1996) includes 
a section encouraging participation, to:
“(a) promote the participation of children, includ-
ing child victims, young people, their families, 
peers and others who are potential helpers of chil-
dren so that they are able to express their views 
and to take action to prevent and protect children 
from commercial sexual exploitation and to assist 
child victims to be reintegrated into society; and
“(b) identify or establish and support networks 
of children and young people as advocates of 
child rights, and include children, according to 
their evolving capacity, in developing and imple-
menting government and other programmes con-
cerning them.” (World Congress Plan of Action, 
A/51/385, para. 6. See also Yokohama Global 
Commitment 2001, page 526.)
The report of the United Nations Secretary-
General’s Study on Violence Against Children 
proposes, among key overarching recommenda-
tions, that States should “actively engage with 
children and respect their views in all aspects of 
prevention, response and monitoring of violence 
against them, taking into account article 12 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Children’s 
organizations and child-led initiatives to address 
violence, guided by the best interests of the child, 
should be supported and encouraged.” (Report 
of the independent expert for the United Nations 
study on violence against children, United 
Nations, General Assembly, sixty-first session, 
August 2006, A/61/299, para. 103. For further 
discussion, see article 19, page 251.)
Within the family environment
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
consistently encouraged children’s participation 
in decision-making within the family, proposing
that definitions of parents’ and other caregivers’ 
responsibilities should include an “article 12 
obligation” to hear and take seriously the child’s 
views. Among recommendations adopted follow-
ing the Committee’s Day of General Discussion 
on “The right of the child to be heard” are:

166
“The Committee recommends that States 
Parties further promote parent education 
on parenting and disseminate information 
to parents on the rights enshrined in the 
Convention and in particular of the right of the 
child to express his or her views, as they are of 
benefit to the whole family.
“The Committee encourages parents to 
support children in order to promote the 
realization of child participation at different 
levels in society. 
“The Committee recognizes that a 
participatory family structure where the child 
can freely express views provides an important 
model to encourage child participation in 
the wider society. Furthermore, it plays a 
preventive role in the protection against 
domestic violence and abuse.” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, Report on the forty-
third session, September 2006, Day of General 
Discussion, Recommendations, paras. 17 to 19)
The rights of the child to a name and nationality 
and to preservation of identity (articles 7 and 8) 
require respect for the views of the child.
In October 1994, the Committee held a Day of 
General Discussion on “The role of the family 
in the promotion of the rights of the child”. One 
of two main issues addressed was the civil rights 
and freedoms of the child within the family. In its 
preliminary conclusions adopted following the 
Discussion, the Committee stated:
“Traditionally, the child has been seen as 
a dependent, invisible and passive family 
member. Only recently has he or she become 
‘seen’ and, furthermore, the movement is 
growing to give him or her the space to be 
heard and respected. Dialogue, negotiation, 
participation have come to the forefront 
of common action for children. The family 
becomes in turn the ideal framework for 
the first stage of the democratic experience 
for each and all of its individual members, 
including children. Is this only a dream or 
should it also be envisaged as a precise and 
challenging task?” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, Report on the seventh session, 
September/October 1994, CRC/C/34, paras. 192 
and 193)
In adoption
Relating to adoption, article 12(2) requires that 
the child is heard in any judicial or administra-
tive proceedings, and article 21(a) refers to the 
“informed consent” of persons concerned (see 
also article 21, page 296). The Committee high-
lights the obligation to ensure respect for the 
child’s views in the adoption process and deci-
sions in recommendations adopted following 
its Day of General Discussion on “The right 
of the child to be heard” (Recommendations, 
para. 44).
In custody decisions and 
alternative care
Article 20 sets out States’ obligation to provide 
alternative care for children deprived temporarily 
or permanently of their family environment. The 
child’s participative rights must be protected in all 
such settings – foster care, kafalah of Islamic law, 
and all kinds of institutions. The Committee’s 
emphasis on the need for legislation and other 
strategies to reflect children’s rights under art-
icle 12 applies equally to alternative care. In addi-
tion to the overall right to express views and have 
them taken seriously (article 12(1)), article 12(2) 
requires that the child is heard in any judicial or 
administrative proceedings relating to alternative 
care. Under article 9(2), in any proceedings to 
determine that it is necessary to separate a child 
from his or her parents, “all interested parties” 
must be given an opportunity to participate (see 
article 9, page 129). Under article 25, children 
placed by the State for care, protection or treat-
ment must have a periodic review; under article 
12, children should be permitted to participate in 
these reviews (see article 25, page 380).
The Committee referred to the right to respect 
for the views of the child in recommendations 
adopted following its Day of General Discussion 
on “Children without parental care”:
“The Committee is concerned at the fact that 
children are not often heard in the separation 
and placement processes. It is also concerned 
that decision-making processes do not attach 
enough weight to children as partners even 
though these decision have a far-reaching 
impact on the child’s life and future…
“In the light of article 12 of the Convention, 
the Committee recommends that all 
stakeholders continue and strengthen their 
efforts to take into consideration the views 
of the child and facilitate their participation 
in all matters affecting them within the 
evaluation, separation and placement 
process, in the out-of-home care and during 
the transition process. It recommends that 
children should be heard throughout the 
protection measure process, before making 
the decision, while it is implemented and also 
after its implementation. For this purpose, 
the Committee recommends establishment 
of a special mechanism which values children 
as partners. Family group conferencing is 
one model to ensure that the child’s view is 
considered. It also recommends that States 
Parties undertake a regular review of the 
extent to which children’s views are taken into 
consideration and of their impact on policy-
making and court decisions and on programme 
implementation.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, Report on the fortieth session, September 
2005, CRC/C/153, paras. 663 and 664)

The Committee often raises with States inad-
equate respect for children’s views in decision-
making processes concerning custody and access 
and alternative care placements. For example, it 
encouraged Poland to
“Establish procedures to ensure that children 
currently residing in institutions that are 
being closed down are fully informed and 
able to participate in deciding their future 
placement...” (Poland CRC/C/15/Add.184,
para. 37(d))
In schools
In its first General Comment, issued in 2001, on 
“The aims of education”, the Committee empha-
sizes that “children do not lose their human rights 
by virtue of passing through the school gates” 
and highlights the importance of schools respect-
ing children’s participation rights:
“… the article attaches importance to the 
process by which the right to education is 
to be promoted. Thus efforts to promote 
the enjoyment of other rights must not be 
undermined, and should be reinforced by the 
values imparted in the educational process. 
This includes not only the content of the 
curriculum but also the educational processes, 
the pedagogical methods and the environment 
within which education takes place, whether 
it be the home, school, or elsewhere. Children 
do not lose their human rights by virtue of 
passing through the school gates. Thus, for 
example, education must be provided in a way 
that respects the inherent dignity of the child, 
enables the child to express his or her views 
freely in accordance with article 12(1) and to 
participate in school life… Compliance with 
the values recognized in article 29(1) clearly 
requires that schools be child friendly in the 
fullest sense of that term and that they be 
consistent in all respects with the dignity of 
the child. Participation of children in school 
life, the creation of school communities and 
student councils, peer education and peer 
counselling, and the involvement of children 
in school disciplinary proceedings should be 
promoted as part of the process of learning 
and experiencing the realization of rights.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 1, 2001, CRC/GC/2001/1, para. 8)
The Committee reiterates this in recommen-
dations adopted following its Day of General 
Discussion on “The right of the child to be heard”, 
and continues:
“The Committee encourages the active 
consultation of children in the development 
and evaluation of school curricula, including 
in the development of methodology, 
as greater participation is conducive to 
increasing the involvement of children in the 
learning process. Child-centred education 
should be provided, taking into account due 
consideration for vulnerable children…
“The Committee reminds States Parties of 
their obligation to ensure that human rights 
education in general, and the CRC in particular, 
is included in the curricula in order to equip 
children with the fundamental knowledge 
tools to enhance the exercise of their rights. 
Students informed of their rights can also 
more effectively combat discrimination, 
violence and corporal punishment in schools. 
The Committee encourages States Parties 
to refer to the General Comment No. 8 on 
‘The Right of the Child to Protection from 
Corporal Punishment’ for further guidance on 
participatory strategies to eliminate corporal 
punishment.
“The Committee calls on States Parties to 
provide teacher training on participatory 
teaching methodologies and its benefits and 
on paying special attention to the needs of 
vulnerable children, whose difficult situation 
may lead to them dropping out of schools. The 
children must enjoy special attention and be 
given the opportunity to express their views 
without intimidation.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, Report on the forty-third session, 
September 2006, Day of General Discussion, 
Recommendations, paras. 17 to 19)
Both paragraphs of article 12 are relevant: the 
general right of the child to express views freely 
“in all matters affecting the child”, which cov-
ers all aspects of school life and decision-making 
about schooling; and the right to be heard in any 
“judicial and administrative proceedings affect-
ing the child”. For example, “administrative” 
proceedings might concern choice of school, 
exclusion from school, formal assessments and 
so on. There is a need for a legislative framework 
and procedures that provide for consultation with 
school students as a group, and also for ascertain-
ing and paying due attention to the views of indi-
vidual children concerning individual decisions 
on education. 
The Committee has commended positive devel-
opments. For example:
“The Committee notes with satisfaction the 
functioning of a comprehensive pattern of 
student representation in the school system.” 
(Austria CRC/C/5/Add.98, para. 5)
“The Committee appreciates the State Party’s 
initiatives within the school environment. In 
this regard, it welcomes the coordination of 
an election for schoolchildren to choose the 
provisions of the Convention most significant 
to them...” (Belize CRC/C/15/Add.99, para. 4)
“... The Committee also notes with 
appreciation that the membership of school 
disciplinary councils includes children.” (Mali 
CRC/C/15/Add.113, para. 5)

A particular issue, relevant to articles 12 and 13, 
is the right of children to organize and contribute 
to school newspapers and magazines (see article 
13, page 177).
In child employment
In addition to protective legislation and pro-
cedures to prevent exploitation of children in 
employment (article 32, see page 479), under 
article 12, respect is required for the views of 
the child; in any judicial or administrative pro-
ceedings relating to employment of children, the 
child has a right to be heard. Children must also 
have access to complaints procedures relating to 
employment. However, one of the challenges of 
ending exploitation of child labour is to ensure 
that children’s often sincere view that they should 
earn money and help to support the family is also 
heard and responded to.
The ILO Recommendation (No.190), supplement-
ing the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 
1999 (No.182), emphasizes the importance of 
taking account of the views of children directly 
affected by the worst forms of child labour (see 
article 32, page 483).
In environmental protection and 
sustainable development
Article 29 requires that children’s education be 
directed to “the development of respect for the 
natural environment”; article 24 requires that chil-
dren are informed (see page 359) about environ-
mental sanitation and it refers to the danger and 
risks of environmental pollution (see page 358).
The direct participation of children was high-
lighted by the 1992 Earth Summit. The United 
Nations 
Conference 
on 
Environment 
and 
Development produced the Rio Declaration 
on Environment and Development, in which 
Principle 21 states: “The creativity, ideals and 
courage of the youth of the world should be 
mobilized to forge a global partnership in order 
to achieve sustainable development and ensure a 
better future for all.” The section of Agenda 21 
on “Children and youth in sustainable develop-
ment” emphasizes that children and youth should 
participate actively in all relevant decision-
making processes, because these processes affect 
their lives today and have implications for their 
futures. The objectives include that “Each coun-
try should, in consultation with its youth com-
munities, establish a process to promote dialogue 
between the youth community and Government 
at all levels, and to establish mechanisms that 
permit youth access to information and provide 
them with the opportunity to present their per-
spectives on government decisions, including the 
implementation of Agenda 21... Each country and 
the United Nations should support the promo-
tion and creation of mechanisms to involve youth 
representation in all United Nations processes in 
order to influence those processes.
“Children not only will inherit the responsibility 
of looking after the Earth, but in many devel-
oping countries they comprise nearly half the 
population. Furthermore, children in both devel-
oping and industrialized countries are highly 
vulnerable to the effects of environmental deg-
radation. They are also highly aware supporters 
of environmental thinking. The specific interests 
of children need to be taken fully into account 
in the participatory process on environment and 
development in order to safeguard the future sus-
tainability of any actions taken to improve the 
environment...” 
Among activities, Governments should take 
active steps to “Establish procedures to incorpo-
rate children’s concerns into all relevant policies 
and strategies for environment and development 
at the local, regional and national levels, includ-
ing those concerning allocation of and entitle-
ment to natural resources, housing and recreation 
needs, and control of pollution and toxicity in 
both rural and urban areas.” (Agenda 21, chapter 
25, Objectives)
In individual health decisions 
and the planning and provision 
of health services
The Convention upholds children’s rights to par-
ticipate in decisions about their health and health 
care, and also in the planning and provision of 
health services relevant to them (see also article  1, 
page 7, and article 24, page 355). One aspect of 
this is children’s evolving capacity to determine 
their own health care. In its General Comment 
No. 4 on “Adolescent health and development 
in the context of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child”, the Committee first asserts States’ 
general obligation: 
“To ensure that adolescent girls and boys 
have the opportunity to participate actively 
in planning and programming for their own 
health and development…” (CRC/GC/2003/4, 
para. 39(d))
It goes on to address rights to consent to treat-
ment:
“Before parents give their consent, adolescents 
need to have a chance to express their views 
freely and their views should be given due 
weight, in accordance with article 12 of the 
Convention. However, if the adolescent is of 
sufficient maturity, informed consent shall 
be obtained from the adolescent her/himself, 
while informing the parents if that is in the 
‘best interest of the child’ (art. 3).

“With regard to privacy and confidentiality, 
and the related issue of informed consent 
to treatment, States Parties should (a) enact 
laws or regulations to ensure that confidential 
advice concerning treatment is provided 
to adolescents so that they can give their 
informed consent. Such laws or regulations 
should stipulate an age for this process, or 
refer to the evolving capacity of the child; 
and (b) provide training for health personnel 
on the rights of adolescents to privacy and 
confidentiality, to be informed about planned 
treatment and to give their informed consent 
to treatment.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, General Comment No. 4, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/4, paras. 32 and 33)
Some countries have set an age from which chil-
dren are deemed to be able to consent to medical 
treatment for themselves; in other countries, more 
in line with the concept of evolving capacities of 
the child, no age is set but a principle exists that 
the child acquires the right to make decisions for 
himself or herself once judged to have “sufficient 
understanding”. In some instances it is linked to 
a presumption in law that a child of a certain age 
does have sufficient maturity (see also article 1, 
page 7). 
The Committee also addresses participation 
rights of children in its General Comment No. 3 
on “HIV/AIDS and the rights of the child”: 
“Children are rights holders and have a right to 
participate, in accordance with their evolving 
capacities, in raising awareness by speaking 
out about the impact of HIV/AIDS on their lives 
and in the development of HIV/AIDS policies 
and programmes. Interventions have been 
found to benefit children most when they are 
actively involved in assessing needs, devising 
solutions, shaping strategies and carrying 
them out rather than being seen as objects for 
whom decisions are made. In this regard, the 
participation of children as peer educators, 
both within and outside schools, should 
be actively promoted. States, international 
agencies and non-governmental organizations 
must provide children with a supportive and 
enabling environment to carry out their own 
initiatives, and to fully participate at both 
community and national levels in HIV policy 
and programme conceptualization, design, 
implementation, coordination, monitoring 
and review. A variety of approaches are likely 
to be necessary to ensure the participation of 
children from all sectors of society, including 
mechanisms which encourage children, 
consistent with their evolving capacities, to 
express their views, have them heard and 
given due weight in accordance with their 
age and maturity (art. 12, para. 1). Where 
appropriate, the involvement of children living 
with HIV/AIDS in raising awareness, by sharing 
their experiences with their peers and others, 
is critical both to effective prevention and to 
reducing stigmatization and discrimination. 
States Parties must ensure that children who 
participate in these awareness-raising efforts 
do so voluntarily, after being counselled, and 
that they receive both the social support and 
legal protection to allow them to lead normal 
lives during and after their involvement.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 3, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/3, para. 12)
In the media
One recommendation adopted following the Day 
of General Discussion on “The right of the child 
to be heard”, refers to the contribution of the 
media:
“The Committee recognizes the essential role 
played by media in promoting awareness of 
the right of children to express their views and 
urges various forms of media, such as radio 
and television, to dedicate further resources 
to including children in the development of 
programmes and allowing for children to 
develop and lead media initiatives on their 
rights.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
Report on the forty-third session, September 2006, 
Day of General Discussion, Recommendations, 
para. 36)
In the outline for its Day of General Discussion 
on “The child and the media”, the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child emphasized the impor-
tance of the media in offering children the oppor-
tunity to express themselves (see also article 17, 
page 218):
“One of the principles of the Convention is 
that the views of children be heard and given 
due respect (art. 12). This is also reflected 
in articles about freedom of expression, 
thought, conscience and religion (arts. 13 and 
14). It is in the spirit of these provisions that 
children should not only be able to consume 
information material but also to participate 
themselves in the media. This requires that 
there exist media which communicate with 
children. The Committee on the Rights of 
the Child has noted that there have been 
experiments in several countries to develop 
child-oriented media; some daily newspapers 
have special pages for children and radio and 
television programmes also devote special 
segments for the young audience. Further 
efforts are, however, needed...” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, Report on the eleventh 
session, January 1996, CRC/C/50, Annex IX, p. 81)
In asylum-seeking and other 
immigration procedures
The principles of article 12(1) and (2) should 
be applied in all immigration procedures includ-
ing asylum seeking, in relation to articles 10 
and 22.

In its General Comment on “Treatment of un-
accompanied and separated children outside their 
country of origin”, the Committee comments: 
“Pursuant to article 12 of the Convention, 
in determining the measures to be adopted 
with regard to unaccompanied or separated 
children, the child’s views and wishes should 
be elicited and taken into account (art. 12(1)). 
To allow for a well-informed expression of 
such views and wishes, it is imperative that 
such children are provided with all relevant 
information concerning, for example, their 
entitlements, services available including 
means of communication, the asylum process, 
family tracing and the situation in their 
country of origin (arts. 13, 17 and 22(2)). 
In guardianship, care and accommodation 
arrangements, and legal representation, 
children’s views should also be taken into 
account. Such information must be provided in 
a manner that is appropriate to the maturity 
and level of understanding of each child. 
As participation is dependent on reliable 
communication, where necessary, interpreters 
should be made available at all stages of the 
procedure.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 6, 2005, 
CRC/GC/2005/6, para. 25) 
The 1994 Refugee children – Guidelines on 
Protection and Care, published by the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), emphasizes the impor-
tance of the Convention’s general principles: 
non-discrimination, best interests of the child 
and respect for the views of the child (articles 2, 
3 and 12). The Guidelines underlines the impor-
tance of seeking and taking seriously children’s 
views and feelings, and enabling children to take 
part in decisions related to asylum seeking and 
as refugees (Refugee children – Guidelines on 
Protection and Care, UNHCR, Geneva, 1994, pp. 
23 et seq.). The UNHCR policy on refugee chil-
dren states: “... Although vulnerable, children are 
also a resource with much to offer. The potential 
contributions of children must not be overlooked. 
They are people in their own right, with sugges-
tions, opinions and abilities to participate in deci-
sions and activities that affect their lives. Efforts 
on behalf of refugee children fall short if they are 
perceived only as individuals to be fed, immu-
nized or sheltered, rather than treated as partici-
pating members of their community.” (UNHCR 
Executive Committee Document EC/SCP/82 in 
Guidelines, p. 171)
In the juvenile justice system
In addition to the general principles found in art-
icle 12(1) and (2), articles 37 and 40 require legis-
lation and other measures to ensure the child’s 
participation in relation to involvement in the 
juvenile justice system. Under article 37(d), any 
child deprived of liberty has the right to prompt 
access to legal and other assistance as well as 
the right to challenge the legality of the depri-
vation of liberty before a court or other compe-
tent body (see article 37, page 565). And under 
article 40(2)(b), the child alleged as or accused 
of infringing the penal law has similar rights to 
legal and other assistance and to participate in a 
fair hearing, if necessary with the assistance of 
an interpreter (see article 40, page 613).
In its General Comment No. 10 on “Children’s 
rights in Juvenile Justice”, the Committee high-
lights that the child’s article 12 rights should be 
fully respected and implemented throughout 
every stage of the process of juvenile justice:
“The Committee notes that increasingly the 
voices of children involved in the juvenile 
justice system are becoming a powerful force 
for improvements and reform, and for the 
fulfilment of rights.”
The Committee goes on to comment on the obli-
gations of the second paragraph of article 12: 
“It is obvious that for a child alleged as, 
accused of or recognized as having infringed 
the penal law, the right to be heard is 
fundamental for a fair trial. It is equally 
obvious that the child has the right to be heard 
directly and not only through a representative 
or an appropriate body if it is in her/his best 
interests. This right of the child must be fully 
observed in all stages of the process, starting 
with pre-trial stage when the child has the 
right to remain silent, as well as the right to 
be heard by the police, the prosecutor and the 
investigating judge. But it also applies in the 
stage of adjudication and disposition, and in 
the stage of implementation of the imposed 
measures.
“… the child, in order to effectively participate 
in the proceedings, must be informed not 
only about the charges, but also about the 
juvenile justice process as such and about the 
possible measures. The child should be given 
the opportunity to express his/her views 
concerning the (alternative) measures that 
may be imposed, and the specific wishes or 
preferences he/she may have in this regard 
should be given due weight. Alleging that 
the child is criminally responsible implies 
that he/she should be competent and able 
to effectively participate in the decisions 
regarding the most appropriate response to 
allegations of his/her infringement of the 
penal law. It may go without saying that 
the judges involved are responsible for and 
make the decisions. But to treat the child as 
a passive object does not recognize his/her 
rights or contribute to an effective response 
to his/her behaviour. This also applies to the 
implementation of the measure imposed.

Research shows that an active engagement 
of the child in this implementation will in 
most cases contribute to a positive result…” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 10, 2007, CRC/C/GC/10, paras. 4(d) 
and 23)
In recommendations adopted following its 
Day of General Discussion on “The right of the 
child to be heard”, the Committee refers to the 
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for 
the Administration of Juvenile Justice (“Beijing 
Rules”) which provides (para. 14(2)) that “pro-
ceedings shall be conducted in an atmosphere 
of understanding which shall allow the juve-
nile to participate therein and to express herself 
or himself freely”. It also refers to the United 
Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile 
Delinquency, the Riyadh Guidelines, which in 
particular emphasizes the importance of par-
ticipation in prevention as well as planning and 
implementation: “For the purposes of the inter-
pretation of these guidelines, a child-centred ori-
entation should be pursued. Young persons should 
have an active role and partnership within society 
and should not be considered as mere objects of 
socialization or control” (para. 3). The Guidelines 
goes on to propose active participation in delin-
quency prevention policies and processes, and 
strengthened youth organizations given full par-
ticipatory status in the management of commu-
nity affairs (for details, see article 40, page 601). 
The Committee reminds States Parties that, in 
order to ensure that the views of the children in 
conflict with the law are duly taken into account, 
the following must be provided as a minimum in 
order to ensure their participation in accordance 
with articles 12 and 40 of the Convention: 
“... (a) adequate legal or other appropriate 
assistance; 
(b) free access to an interpreter if the child 
cannot speak or understand the language 
used;
(c) respect for his or her privacy during all 
stages of the proceedings;
(d) recognition that the child has a right to 
participate freely and cannot be compelled 
to give testimony.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, Report on the forty-third session, 
September 2006, Day of General Discussion, 
Recommendations, para. 48)
In the work of the Committee and 
the reporting process under the 
Convention
In recommendations adopted following its Day of 
General Discussion on “The right of the child to 
be heard”, the Committee 
“… recognizes the importance of child 
participation in the work of the Committee and 
encourages children and youth representatives 
to submit information in the context of 
periodic reviews and stresses in particular 
their important role in advocating for and 
monitoring of the implementation of the 
concluding observations at the national level.
“The Committee remains committed to 
exploring means of furthering participation 
of children in the work of the Committee, and 
in particular encourages more participation of 
children during pre-session country briefings 
with civil society representatives.” (Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, Report on the forty-
third session, September 2006, Day of General 
Discussion, Recommendations, paras. 57 and 58)
This was in response to proposals from children, 
who participated in the General Discussion, that 
there should be a child member of the Committee, 
an advisory group of children to work with the 
Committee and more direct contact with children 
in all aspects of its work.
In the recommendations, the Committee proposes 
that States Parties
“… actively involve children in the periodic 
review process of the Convention. It also urges 
children to play an active role in identifying 
human rights aspects in need of further 
attention and monitoring the implementation 
of concluding observations at the national 
level.” (Recommendations, para. 31)
The Committee also proposes that non-govern-
mental organizations, including national alli-
ances on children’s rights, should engage directly 
with children in the process of “parallel report-
ing” under the Convention. And the Committee 
encourages the presence of children during pre-
sessional country briefings with the Committee 
(Recommendations, para. 34).

Reminder: The Convention is indivisible and its articles interdependent.
Article 12 has been identified by the Committee on the Rights of the Child as a general 
principle of relevance to implementation of the whole Convention. 
Particular regard should be paid to:
The general principles
Article 2: all rights to be recognized for each child in the jurisdiction without discrimination on any 
ground 
Article 3(1): the best interests of the child to be a primary consideration in all actions concerning 
children
Article 6: right to life and maximum possible survival and development
All other articles require consideration of the child’s right to be heard, and to have his or her views 
taken seriously. Specifically, the child has a right to be heard in relation to any judicial or administrat-
ive proceedings affecting the child, relevant to, for example, articles 9, 10, 21, 25, 37, 40. Also linked 
to the child’s participation rights are articles 13 (freedom of expression), article 14 (freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion) and article 15 (freedom of association).

have them taken seriously under article 12, and 
to the following two articles: on freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion and on free-
dom of association. In addition, article 17 covers 
the child’s access to appropriate informa-
tion and material. In its examination of reports, 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
emphasized that the child is the subject of rights, 
the possessor of rights, and that the civil rights of 
children should be recognized explicitly in the 
law. Article 30 asserts the linked cultural, reli-
gious and linguistic rights of the children of 
minorities and indigenous communities, and art-
icle 31, the right of the child to engage in play 
and recreation and in cultural life and the arts. ■
his is one of a series of articles in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child 
which confirm that civil rights guaran-
teed for “everyone” in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the Inter-
national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
do apply to children. The first paragraph sets out 
the right to freedom of expression – to “seek, 
receive and impart” information and ideas of 
all kinds, and the second paragraph limits the 
restrictions that may be applied to the child’s 
exercise of this right.
The right to freedom of expression is closely 
linked to the child’s right to express views and 
Text of Article 13
1. The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either 
orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child’s 
choice.
2. The exercise of this right may be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such 
as are provided by law and are necessary:
(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; or
(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public 
health or morals.

The child’s right to freedom 
of expression
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in 
its article 19, guarantees: “Everyone has the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression; this right 
includes freedom to hold opinions without inter-
ference and to seek, receive and impart informa-
tion and ideas through any media and regardless 
of frontiers.” Article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contains 
similar wording.
In a 1989 General Comment, the Human Rights 
Committee emphasizes that children should ben-
efit from civil rights. The Committee points out 
that the rights providing specifically for children 
in article 24 of the Covenant, “are not the only 
ones that the Covenant recognizes for children and 
that, as individuals, children benefit from all of the 
civil rights enunciated in the Covenant...” (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 17, 
1989, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 2, p. 183)
But as the Manual on Human Rights Reporting, 
1997, comments on children’s civil rights: “The 
prevailing reality was however, and to a cer-
tain extent still is, that children, in view of their 
evolving maturity, are in practice not recognized 
as having the necessary capacity or competence 
to exercise them. By their clear incorporation in 
the Convention, an undeniable statement is made 
as to their entitlement and ability to fully enjoy 
such fundamental freedoms.” (Manual, pp. 434 
and 435) 
The Manual notes that articles 13 to 17 consti-
tute an important chapter of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, indicating the need to 
envisage the child as an active subject of rights. 
“States are required to recognize them in the law 
and to determine therein how their exercise may 
be ensured. It is therefore not sufficient for the 
Constitution simply to include them as fundamen-
tal rights. In fact, constitutional and/or legal pro-
visions should further indicate how these rights 
specifically apply to children, which mechanisms 
have been established to protect them in an effec-
tive manner and which remedies are provided in 
case of their violation.” (Manual, p. 434)
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
emphasized that, in the case of children, it is not 
enough that these principles should be reflected 
in constitutions as applying to “everyone”. The 
Committee expects to see the child’s right to free-
dom of expression expressly guaranteed in legis-
lation (and the article requires that any restrictions 
on the right are set out in legislation – see below). 
For example, the Committee commented:
“In the light of articles 13, 14 and 15, the 
Committee is concerned that the State Party 
has not taken all legal and other appropriate 
measures to promote and implement those 
rights ...
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take all appropriate measures, including 
legal means, to fully implement articles 13, 14 
and 15 of the Convention ...” (Myanmar 
CRC/C/15/Add.69, paras. 16 and 37)
The Committee has frequently noted that the 
implementation of article 13 and linked civil 
rights needs further development. For example:
“The Committee is generally concerned that 
inadequate attention has been given to the 
promotion of civil rights and freedoms of the 
child, as provided for in articles 13, 14, 15, 16, 
and 17 of the Convention. Information before 
the Committee indicates that traditional 
social attitudes regarding the role of children 
appear to make it difficult to accept children 
fully as the subjects of rights. The Committee 
urges the State Party to redouble its efforts 
to educate and sensitize parliamentarians and 
government officials, professional groups, 
parents and children on the importance of 
accepting fully the concept of child rights, 
and recommends that legislative measures be 
envisaged to guarantee the enjoyment of civil 
rights and freedoms for every child.” (Barbados 
CRC/C/15/Add.103, para. 18)
“The Committee is concerned that the 
reference in the report to information 
contained in the Initial Report indicates that 
very little or no progress has taken place with 
respect to the implementation of articles 13 to 
17 of the Convention on these matters.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party actively promote the implementation of 
these rights by, among other things, making 
children more aware of these rights and by 
facilitating their active use in daily practice and 
report on the progress made in this regard in 
the next report.” (Syrian Arab Republic CRC/C/15/
Add.212, paras. 34 and 35)
The Committee has continued to draw attention 
to traditional attitudes which hinder enjoyment 
by the child of the right to freedom of expression 
(see also article 12, page 154). For example:
“The Committee is concerned at the lack of 
legal guarantees for the freedom of expression 
for children below 18 years of age. It is also 
concerned at the inadequate attention being 
given to the promotion of and respect for the 
right of the child to freedom of expression and 
that prevailing traditional societal attitudes, in 
the family and in other settings regarding the 
role of children, appear to make it difficult for 
children to seek and impart information freely. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take all appropriate measures, including

amendments to legislation, to promote and 
guarantee the right of the child to freedom of 
expression within the family, in the school and 
other institutions and in society.” (Georgia 
CRC/C/15/Add.222, paras. 28 and 29)
“The Committee welcomes the guarantee of 
freedom of expression under article 22 of the 
Constitution, but recognizes that there is a 
vacuum in the legislative acts on the practical 
ways to implement this right for children, 
as noted by the State Party in its report. 
Furthermore, the Committee is concerned that 
the prevailing attitudes in the family, in school, 
in other institutions and in society at large are 
not conducive to the enjoyment of this right.
“The Committee encourages the State Party 
to take all appropriate measures, including 
legal means, to fully implement article 13, 
and to introduce measures to promote and 
guarantee the right of the child to freedom of 
expression.” (Albania CRC/C/15/Add.249, 
paras. 36 and 37)
The Committee has proposed monitoring and 
research to determine to what extent children’s 
civil rights are respected, within and outside 
the family. The Committee has also encouraged 
States to look at the implementation of the child’s 
right to freedom of expression in various settings, 
including within the family. 
In its outline for the Day of General Discussion 
on “The role of the family in the promotion of the 
rights of the child”, the Committee commented:
“The civil rights of the child begin within the 
family ... The family is an essential agent for 
creating awareness and preservation of human 
rights, and respect for human values, cultural 
identity and heritage, and other civilizations. 
There is a need to consider appropriate 
ways of ensuring balance between parental 
authority and the realization of the rights 
of the child, including the right to freedom 
of expression. Corresponding measures to 
prevent abrogation of these rights of the 
child within the family should be discussed.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report 
on the fifth session, January 1994, CRC/C/24, 
Annex V, p. 63) 
The Committee has also stressed the important 
role of the media in “offering children the possi-
bility of expressing themselves”. Article 17 (see 
page 217) concerns the role of the mass media 
and ensuring that the child has access to a wide 
variety of information and material. In the report 
of its General Discussion on “The child and the 
media”, the Committee promoted children’s par-
ticipatory rights in relation to the media (see art-
icle 12, page 169 and article 17, page 218). The 
Internet and modern information and commu-
nications technology, including mobile phones, 
provide children with new opportunities to seek 
and impart information regardless of frontiers or 
adult restrictions. And in one case, the Committee 
expressed concern at 
“… allegations that Internet chat rooms, set 
up independently by teenagers, have been 
arbitrarily closed down by the authorities.” 
(Republic of Korea CRC/C/15/Add.197, para. 36)
The Committee has expressed concerns to States 
about limitations of the freedom of expression 
and freedom of association of children in schools, 
including in its first General Comment on “The 
aims of education”: 
“… the article [article 29] attaches importance 
to the process by which the right to education 
is to be promoted. Thus, efforts to promote 
the enjoyment of other rights must not be 
undermined, and should be reinforced, by the 
values imparted in the educational process. 
This includes not only the content of the 
curriculum but also the educational processes, 
the pedagogical methods and the environment 
within which education takes place, whether 
it be the home, school, or elsewhere. Children 
do not lose their human rights by virtue of 
passing through the school gates. Thus, for 
example, education must be provided in a way 
that respects the inherent dignity of the child, 
enables the child to express his or her views 
freely in accordance with article 12(1) and to 
participate in school life…” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 1, 2001, 
CRC/GC/2001/1, para. 8)
In relation to freedom of expression and free-
dom of association in schools, the Committee has 
expressed concerns to Japan,
“... about restrictions on political activities 
undertaken by schoolchildren both on and off 
school campuses…”
It went on to recommend 
“... that the State Party review legislation and 
regulations governing activities undertaken 
by schoolchildren on and off campus…” (Japan 
CRC/C/15/Add.231, paras. 29 and 30)
It found similar concerns when it examined the 
Republic of Korea’s Second Report: 
“The Committee is concerned at the limitations 
on students’ freedom of expression and 
association due to strict administrative control 
of student councils and school regulations 
that limit or prohibit outside political activities 
of students in elementary and secondary 
schools…
“In the light of articles 12 to 17 of the 
Convention, the Committee recommends that 
the State Party amend legislation, guidelines 
issued by the Ministry of Education and school 
regulations to facilitate children’s active 
participation in decision-making processes and

in political activities both within and outside 
schools and ensure that all children fully enjoy 
their right to freedom of association and 
expression.” (Republic of Korea CRC/C/15/Add.197, 
paras. 36 and 37)
The Committee has expressed concerns about 
restrictions on the wearing of religious symbols 
or clothing, raising issues under article 14, the 
child’s right to freedom of religion, as well as 
article 13 (for details, see article 14, page 185).
Of particular importance to children’s freedom 
of expression is the right to engage in play and 
recreational activity and to participate freely in 
cultural life and the arts (see article 31, page 469). 
Article 30 asserts the particular rights of freedom 
of expression of children belonging to minori-
ties or indigenous communities to enjoy their 
own culture, practice and profess their own reli-
gion, and use their own language (see article 30, 
page 455). 
Ensuring the freedom of expression rights of 
children with disabilities may require special 
attention. The Committee’s General Comment 
No. 9 on “The rights of children with disabili-
ties” emphasizes that all universal civil rights and 
freedoms, including freedom of expression, must 
be respected and promoted for all children with 
disabilities:
“Particular attention should be focused here 
on areas where the rights of children with 
disabilities are more likely to be violated or 
where special programmes are needed for 
their protection.” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, General Comment No. 9, 2006, 
CRC/C/GC/9, para. 34)
The Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, adopted in December 2006, states: 
“States Parties shall take all appropriate measures 
to ensure that persons with disabilities can exer-
cise the right to freedom of expression and opin-
ion, including the freedom to seek, receive and 
impart information and ideas on an equal basis 
with others and through all forms of communica-
tion of their choice, as defined in article 2 of the 
present Convention, including by: 
(a) Providing information intended for the general 
public to persons with disabilities in accessible 
formats and technologies appropriate to different 
kinds of disabilities in a timely manner and with-
out additional cost; 
(b) Accepting and facilitating the use of sign lan-
guages, Braille, augmentative and alternative 
communication, and all other accessible means, 
modes and formats of communication of their 
choice by persons with disabilities in official 
interactions; 
(c) Urging private entities that provide services to 
the general public, including through the Internet, 
to provide information and services in accessible 
and usable formats for persons with disabilities; 
(d) Encouraging the mass media, including pro-
viders of information through the Internet, to 
make their services accessible to persons with 
disabilities; 
(e) Recognizing and promoting the use of sign 
languages.” (Article 21)
The United Nations Rules for the Protection of 
Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty, which the 
Committee has promoted as providing relevant 
standards for implementation, states in rule 13: 
“Juveniles deprived of their liberty shall not for 
any reason related to their status be denied the 
civil, economic, political, social or cultural rights 
to which they are entitled under national or inter-
national law, and which are compatible with the 
deprivation of liberty, such as social security 
rights and benefits, freedom of association and, 
upon reaching the minimum age established by 
law, the right to marry.” Thus aspects of freedom 
of expression not incompatible with deprivation 
of liberty must be preserved in all forms of the 
restriction of liberty. 
Restrictions on child’s right: 
article 13(2)
Restrictions on the child’s right to freedom of 
expression are strictly limited by the provisions of 
paragraph 2 of the article. The restrictions are the 
same as those applied to “everyone’s” freedom 
of expression in article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Any 
restrictions must be set out in legislation and 
must be “necessary” for one of the two purposes 
set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of article 13.
The Committee, in its examination of States 
Parties’ reports, has also challenged limits on any 
restrictions on children’s civil rights, including 
freedom of expression and freedom of association 
and peaceful assembly:
“The Committee is concerned about the 
limitations on the exercise of the right 
to freedom of expression by children. 
The Committee notes with concern the 
violent incidents during a peaceful student 
demonstration against a rise in bus fares, 
which took place in the village of Benque Viejo 
del Carmen on 24 April 2002, and the reported 
disproportionate use of force by the police 
authorities.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party encourage and facilitate the exercise 
by children of their right to freedom of

expression, including their right to freedom 
of association and of peaceful assembly, so 
that they can freely discuss, participate and 
express their views and opinions on all matters 
affecting them.” (Belize CRC/C/15/Add.252, 
paras. 38 and 39)
“The Committee is concerned that although 
the freedoms of expression and assembly 
are formally recognized in the Constitution, 
the exercise of these rights by children are 
restricted by vaguely worded limitation clauses 
(i.e. ‘in accordance with Islamic criteria’), which 
potentially exceed the permitted restrictions 
set out in paragraph 2 of articles 13 and 15 of 
the Convention. The Committee is concerned 
at reports of incidents of threats and violence 
by vigilante groups, such as Ansari-Hezbollah, 
directed at persons seeking to exercise or to 
promote the exercise of these rights. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party establish clear criteria to assess whether 
a given action or expression is in accordance 
with interpretations of Islamic texts, and 
consider appropriate and proportionate means 
to protect public morals while safeguarding 
the right of every child to freedom of 
expression and assembly.” (Islamic Republic of 
Iran CRC/C/15/Add.123, paras. 33 and 34)
It repeated its concerns when it examined Iran’s 
Second Report:
“The Committee remains concerned that, 
although freedom of expression and of 
assembly is formally recognized in the 
Constitution, the protection of this freedom 
is restricted by the requirement to interpret it 
in accordance with Islamic principles without 
clarifying at the outset the basis on which an 
action or expression is considered to be in 
keeping with such principles.
“The Committee reiterates its 
recommendation, expressed in its previous 
concluding observations, that the State Party 
establish clear criteria for determining whether 
a given action or expression is in accordance 
with Islamic law and the Convention in order 
to avoid arbitrary interpretations.” (Islamic 
Republic of Iran CRC/C/15/Add.254, paras. 39 
and 40)
Article 17(e) of the Convention, on the mass 
media and other information sources, requires 
States to: “Encourage the development of appro-
priate guidelines for the protection of the child 
from information and material injurious to his 
or her well-being, bearing in mind the provisions 
of articles 13 and 18.” Thus any guidelines must 
be consistent with the right to freedom of expres-
sion and with the restrictions allowed under 
article 13(2).
One particular issue raised during the draft-
ing of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(and more recently in reservations and declara-
tions made by some States upon ratifying the 
Convention) concerns the role of parents in rela-
tion to children’s civil rights, including the right 
to freedom of expression. During the drafting 
process, a general proposal, that the Convention 
should confirm explicitly that the civil and 
political rights accorded to “everyone” in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights do apply to children, met with some oppo-
sition at first. The need to acknowledge the par-
ents’ role was emphasized. An early draft of what 
was to become article 13 stated: “Nothing in this 
article shall be interpreted as limiting or other-
wise affecting the authority, rights or responsi-
bilities of a parent or other legal guardian of the 
child.” But discussion proceeded to agree that 
while children might need direction and guid-
ance from parents or guardians in the exercise 
of these rights, this does not affect the content 
of the rights themselves, and also that the evolv-
ing capacities of the child must be respected (E/
CN.4/1986/39, p. 17; E/CN.4/1987/25, pp. 26 and 
27; E/CN.4/1988/28, pp. 9 to 13; Detrick, pp. 230 
et seq.). 
These formulas find general expression in article 5 
of the Convention, requiring States to respect the 
“responsibilities, rights and duties” of parents 
and others “to provide, in a manner consistent 
with the evolving capacities of the child, appro-
priate direction and guidance in the exercise by 
the child of the rights recognized in the present 
Convention” (see article 5, page 75). This role for 
parents is repeated in article 14 (the child’s right 
to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, 
see page 185) but not in articles 13 or 15.
Various States have issued declarations or reser-
vations concerning the relationship between par-
ents and their children’s civil rights, which include 
article 13. When examining Initial Reports, the 
Committee has consistently asked for a review 
and withdrawal of reservations; in particular, the 
Committee has expressed concern at reservations 
that suggest a lack of full recognition of the child 
as a subject of rights.
Other declarations and reservations relate to 
potential restrictions on freedom of expression 
and other civil rights. A reservation made by 
Austria states: “Article 13 and article 15 of the 
Convention will be applied provided that they 
will not affect legal restrictions in accordance 
with article 10 and article 11 of the European 
Convention on the Protection of Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 
1950.”

The European Convention has a wider definition 
of permitted restrictions in its article on freedom 
of expression (article 10(2)): “The exercise of these 
freedoms, since it carries with it duties and respon-
sibilities, may be subject to such formalities, con-
ditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed 
by law and are necessary in a democratic soci-
ety, in the interests of national security, territorial 
integrity or public safety, for the prevention of dis-
order or crime, for the protection of health or mor-
als, for the protection of the reputation or rights of 
others, for preventing the disclosure of informa-
tion received in confidence, or for maintaining the 
authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”
When it examined Austria’s Second Report, the 
Committee noted 
“… the explanation by the delegation for the 
non-withdrawal of the reservations to articles 
13, 15 and 17, but remains of the opinion that 
the reservations are – particularly in the light 
of the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action 
adopted by the World Conference on Human 
Rights in 1993 – not necessary.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party reconsider the need for maintaining 
the existing reservations and continue 
and complete its review with a view to the 
withdrawal of the reservations in line with 
the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action.” 
(Austria CRC/C/15/Add.251, paras. 6 and 7)
The Human Rights Committee, in its General 
Comment on the equivalent article 19 in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, emphasizes that it is the interplay between 
the principle of freedom of expression and any 
imposed limitations and restrictions that deter-
mines the actual scope of the individual’s right. 
Paragraph 3 of article 19 states that the exercise 
of the right to freedom of expression “carries with 
it special duties and responsibilities. It may there-
fore be subject to certain restrictions, but these 
shall only be such as are provided by law and are 
necessary:
(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of 
others;
(b) For the protection of national security or of 
public order (ordre public), or of public health or 
morals.”
The General Comment states: “Paragraph 3 
expressly stresses that the exercise of the right 
to freedom of expression carries with it spe-
cial duties and responsibilities and for this rea-
son certain restrictions on the right are permitted 
which may relate either to the interests of other 
persons or to those of the community as a whole. 
However, when a State Party imposes certain 
restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expres-
sion, these may not put in jeopardy the right itself. 
Paragraph 3 lays down conditions and it is only 
subject to these conditions that restrictions may 
be imposed: the restrictions must be ‘provided 
by law’; they may only be imposed for one of the 
purposes set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of 
paragraph 3; and they must be justified as being 
‘necessary’ for that State Party for one of those 
purposes.”
The Human Rights Committee notes that not 
all countries have provided information in their 
reports under the Covenant on “all aspects of 
the freedom of expression. For instance, little 
attention has so far been given to the fact that, 
because of the development of modern mass 
media, effective measures are necessary to pre-
vent such control of the media as would interfere 
with the right of everyone to freedom of expres-
sion in a way that is not provided for in para-
graph 3.
“Many States’ reports confine themselves to 
mentioning that freedom of expression is guaran-
teed under the Constitution or the law. However, 
in order to know the precise regime of freedom of 
expression in law and in practice, the Committee 
needs in addition pertinent information about the 
rules which either define the scope of freedom of 
expression or which set forth certain restrictions, 
as well as any other conditions which in practice 
affect the exercise of this right...” (Human Rights 
Committee, General Comment No. 10, 1983,

• General measures of implementation
Have appropriate general measures of implementation been taken in relation to article 13, 
including:
■  identification and coordination of the responsible departments and agencies at all 
levels of government (article 13 is relevant to departments of family affairs, 
welfare, education, media and communication)?

compatible with the article, for all children in all parts of the jurisdiction?
adoption of a strategy to secure full implementation 
■  which includes where necessary the identification of goals and indicators of 
progress?
■  which does not affect any provisions which are more conducive to the rights of 
the child?

with the child’s evolving capacities. Paragraph 3 
sets out the very limited restrictions allowed on 
the child’s freedom to manifest his or her 
religion or belief. 
The Initial Reports of many States simply 
recorded that this right is reflected in their 
Constitutions and applies equally to children. It is 
apparent from a range of declarations and reserva-
tions that, in some States, the right of the child to 
freedom of religion conflicts with tradition and, 
in some cases, with legislation. Few States appear 
as yet to have reflected the child’s right in domes-
tic legislation, and in many, it is parents who 
determine the child’s religion. The Committee 
has expressed particular concern at arrangements 
for religious education in schools which do not 
respect children’s freedom of religion. 
■
rticle 14 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child confirms for the 
child the fundamental civil right to 
freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion, which is upheld for “everyone” in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. The second paragraph, echoing article 5 
of the Convention, requires respect for the role 
of parents in providing direction to the child “in 
a manner consistent with the evolving capacities 
of the child”. The International Covenant 
requires respect for the liberty of parents to 
ensure the religious and moral education of their 
children in conformity with their own convic-
tions, but the emphasis in the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child is on the freedom of religion 
of the child, with parental direction consistent 
Text of Article 14
1. States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion.
2. States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal 
guardians to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner 
consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.
3. Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are 
prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of others.

Freedom of thought
Children’s right to freedom of thought provokes 
little controversy or comment in States’ succes-
sive reports or from the Committee. The concept 
of freedom of thought is linked to the right to 
form and express views, in article 12. The prac-
tical implementation of freedom of thought is 
related to the freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, under article 
13; to the child’s access to appropriate informa-
tion, under article 17; and to the child’s education, 
under articles 28 and 29. The child’s right to pri-
vacy, in article 16, implies that children cannot be 
forced to reveal their thoughts.
There are no restrictions on the right to freedom 
of thought. Paragraph 2 requires respect for the 
rights and duties of parents and others to provide 
direction to the child in the exercise of the right, 
consistent with the child’s evolving capacities.
Freedom of conscience
Again, the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
provides no restrictions to the child’s right to 
freedom of conscience, but paragraph 2 of arti-
cle 14 allows for parents’ direction. Issues of con-
science might arise, for example, concerning diet, 
such as vegetarianism, or environmental issues. 
One issue of conscience on which there are var-
ious human rights recommendations, but no 
explicit mention in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, or in the Convention, 
is that of conscientious objection to military 
service. The Convention, in article 38, prohib-
its recruitment into the armed forces of anyone 
under the age of 15 and the Optional Protocol 
on the involvement of children in armed conflict 
requires States to ensure no compulsory recruit-
ment of children under 18 years (see page 659). 
Conscientious objection remains a real issue for 
15- to 18-year-olds in some countries. In addition, 
some countries contain militaristic youth organi-
zations and include some form of military train-
ing within the education system; if compulsory, 
these could conflict with article 14.
The first edition of the Manual on Human Rights 
Reporting, 1991, in a commentary on the right to 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion in 
article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, suggests that “the status and 
position of conscientious objectors should be dis-
cussed under this article, and statistical informa-
tion should be provided regarding the number 
of persons that applied for the status of, and the 
number of those that were actually recognized 
as, conscientious objectors; the reasons given 
to justify conscientious objection and the rights 
and duties of conscientious objectors as com-
pared with those persons who serve in the regu-
lar military service”. (Manual on Human Rights 
Reporting, 1991, p. 108)
Freedom of religion
Article 14 protects the child’s right to freedom of 
religion, which is an absolute right, and to mani-
fest his or her religion, which may be subject to 
the very limited restrictions outlined in para-
graph 3.
In addition, article 30 of the Convention (see page 
455) upholds the right of a child who belongs to 
an ethnic, religious or linguistic minority or who 
is indigenous “to profess and practise his or her 
own religion...” And in arranging alternative 
care, under article 20, States must pay due regard 
to the child’s religious background (see below, 
page 189).
What freedom of religion means 
Article 18(1) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights expands on the right to 
freedom of religion: “... This right shall include 
freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief 
of his choice, and freedom, either individually or 
in community with others and in public or pri-
vate, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, 
observance, practice and teaching.” The second 
paragraph states: “No one shall be subject to 
coercion which would impair his freedom to have 
or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.” 
The Human Rights Committee issued a lengthy 
General Comment on article 18 in 1993. It empha-
sizes that the terms “religion” and “belief” are to 
be broadly construed, protecting theistic, non-
theistic and atheistic beliefs as well as the right 
not to profess any religion or belief. The article 
“does not permit any limitations whatsoever on 
the freedom of thought and conscience or on 
the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief 
of one’s choice”. No one can be compelled to 
reveal his adherence to a religion or belief: this 
is assured by article 18 and by the right to pri-
vacy set out in article 17 of the Covenant (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 22, 
1993, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 2, p. 195). The 
child’s right to privacy is echoed in article 16 of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
expressed concern at restrictions on children’s 
freedom of religion and quoted other interna-
tional instruments and the recommendations of 
other Treaty Bodies. For example:

“The Committee emphasizes that the 
human rights of children cannot be realized 
independently from the human rights of their 
parents, or in isolation from society at large. 
In the light of article 14 of the Convention, 
the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination 
Based on Religion or Belief (General Assembly 
resolution 36/55), Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 2000/33, the Human Rights 
Committee’s General Comment No. 22, and 
concurring with the findings of the Human 
Rights Committee (CCPR/C/79/Add.25) and 
the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (E/C.12/1993/7), the Committee 
is concerned at the restrictions on the 
freedom of religion, and that restrictions on 
the freedom to manifest one’s religion do 
not comply with the requirements outlined 
in article 14, paragraph 3. The Committee 
is especially concerned at the situation 
of members of non-recognized religions, 
including the Baha’is, who experience 
discrimination in areas of, inter alia, education, 
employment, travel, housing and the 
enjoyment of cultural activities. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take effective measures to prevent 
and eliminate discrimination on the grounds 
of religion or belief in the recognition, 
exercise and enjoyment of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms in all fields of 
civil, economic, political, social and cultural 
life. The Committee recommends that the 
State Party make every effort to enact or 
rescind, where necessary, legislation to 
prohibit any such discrimination, and take 
all appropriate measures, including public 
education campaigns, to combat intolerance 
on the grounds of religion or other belief. The 
Committee endorses the recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of religious intolerance following 
his visit to the State Party (E/CN.4/1996/95/
Add.2) and recommends that the State Party 
implement them fully.” (Islamic Republic of Iran 
CRC/C/15/Add.123, paras. 35 and 36) 
The Committee followed this up when it exam-
ined Iran’s Second Report:
“The Committee is concerned that little 
progress has been made in the area of 
freedom of religion and notes that members 
of unrecognized religions continue to be 
discriminated against and do not have the 
same rights as those of recognized religions, 
for example with regard to access to social 
services. In addition, it continues to be 
concerned at reports that these minorities, in 
particular the Baha’i minority, are subjected to 
harassment, intimidation and imprisonment on 
account of their religious beliefs.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take effective measures, including 
enacting or rescinding legislation, to prevent 
and eliminate discrimination on the grounds 
of religion or belief and ensure that members 
of minority religions are not imprisoned or 
otherwise ill-treated on account of their 
religion and that access to education for 
their children is provided on an equal footing 
with others.” (Islamic Republic of Iran CRC/C/15/
Add.254, paras. 41 and 42)
“With reference to the findings of the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief during his visit to Algeria in 2002 (see 
E/CN.4/2003/66/Add.1) and the interpretative 
declaration of the State Party to article 14 of 
the Convention, the Committee is concerned 
that the right of the child to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion is not fully 
respected and protected.
“In the light of article 14 of the Convention, 
the Committee recommends that the State 
Party respect the right of the child to freedom 
of thought, conscience and religion by taking 
effective measures to prevent and eliminate 
all forms of discrimination on the grounds of 
religion or belief and by promoting religious 
tolerance and dialogue in society…” (Algeria 
CRC/C/15/Add.269, paras. 37 and 38)
“While noting the adoption of the Regional 
Ethnic Autonomy Act in 2001, which 
guarantees freedom of religion for ethnic 
minorities in mainland China, the Committee 
is concerned about reports that children, in 
particular Tibetan Buddhist, Uighur and Hui 
children, have been restricted in studying 
and practising their religion, and in some 
cases have been detained for participating 
in religious activities. It is also concerned at 
reports that children of families practising their 
religion, notably the Falun Gong, are subject 
to harassment, threats and other negative 
actions, including re-education through labour. 
The Committee notes the information provided 
about the Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, but remains 
concerned that it has not yet been possible 
to have this information confirmed by an 
independent expert.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take all necessary measures to ensure 
the full implementation of the Regional Ethnic 
Autonomy Act. In particular, the Committee 
recommends that the State Party:
(a) Enact legislation explicitly guaranteeing 
freedom of religion for those under 18 that 
is not tied to a limited number of recognized 
faiths, and which respects the rights and duties 
of parents to give guidance to their children in 
the exercise of their rights in this regard in a 
manner consistent with the evolving capacities 
of the child;
(b) Repeal any ban instituted by local 
authorities on children of any age from 
participating in Tibetan religious festivals or 
receiving religious education;

(c) Repeal any ban instituted by local 
authorities on children of any age from 
attending mosques or receiving religious 
education throughout the mainland;
(d) Take all necessary measures to ensure that 
children may choose whether to participate in 
classes on religion or atheism;
(e) Allow an independent expert to visit and 
confirm the well-being of Gedhun Choekyi 
Nyima while respecting his right to privacy, 
and that of his parents.” (China CRC/C/CHN/
CO/2, paras.44 and 45)
“The Committee is concerned that the right of 
the child to freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion is not fully respected and 
protected. The Committee is concerned about 
hate speech against religious minorities in 
schools and mosques.
“In the light of article 14 of the Convention, 
the Committee recommends that the State 
Party respect the right of the child to freedom 
of thought, conscience and religion by taking 
effective measures to prevent and eliminate 
all forms of discrimination on the grounds of 
religion or belief and by promoting religious 
tolerance and dialogue in society.” (Saudi 
Arabia CRC/C/SAU/CO/2, paras. 40 and 41)
“The Committee is concerned that in 
Turkmenistan religious organizations 
encounter difficulties related to the procedure 
for their registration and face restrictions with 
respect to the exercise of their activities. The 
Committee is also concerned at reports of 
instances of raids on religious meetings and 
demolition of places of worship.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party respect the right of the child to freedom 
of religion. The State Party should ensure that 
all religious organizations are free to exercise 
their right to freedom of religion or belief 
subject only to the limitations provided for in 
article 14 of the Convention. The Committee 
further recommends that the State Party 
prevent, prohibit and punish any violent 
attack against religious activities, including 
demolition of places of worship.” (Turkmenistan 
CRC/C/TKM/CO/1, paras. 34 and 35)
The child’s right and parental 
direction: article 14(2) 
The Convention on the Rights of the Child differs 
from previous instruments in its treatment of the 
child’s right to freedom of religion vis-à-vis his 
or her parents. For example, in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, paragraph 
4 of article 18 refers to the parent-child relation-
ship and requires respect for “the liberty of parents 
and, when applicable, legal guardians to ensure 
the religious and moral education of their chil-
dren in conformity with their own convictions” 
(see discussion of religious education in schools, 
below, page 188).
Yet article 14 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child refers unambiguously to the right of the 
child to freedom of religion. The second para-
graph refers to the “rights and duties” of parents 
rather than to their “liberty”. Similar to the gen-
eral statement given in article 5, article 14 requires 
States to “respect the rights and duties of the par-
ents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to pro-
vide direction to the child in the exercise of his or 
her right in a manner consistent with the evolv-
ing capacities of the child”. But it is the child who 
exercises the right. Parents can provide direc-
tion, but the direction must be consistent with the 
child’s evolving capacities and must be applied 
in conformity with the whole of the Convention. 
“Direction” cannot involve, for instance, any form 
of physical or mental violence (article 19). And the 
child’s views must be taken seriously: article 12 
preserves the right of all children who can form 
views to express their views freely “in all matters 
affecting the child”, which includes matters of 
religion and choice of religion; article 13 upholds 
the child’s freedom of expression.
The wording of article 14 and the Convention art-
icles identified as general principles certainly do 
not support the concept of children automatically 
following their parent’s religion until the age of 
18, although article 8 (preservation of identity), 
article 20 (preservation of religion when deprived 
of family environment), and article 30 (right to 
practice religion in community with members 
of the child’s group) support children’s right to 
acquire their parents’ religion. 
More States Parties have made reservations 
or declarations concerning article 14 of the 
Convention than any other article. Some are 
wide-ranging reservations or declarations uphold-
ing parental rights and authority in relation to the 
civil rights of children, in particular articles 13, 
14 and 15. 
For example, Algeria made an interpretative dec-
laration: “The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 
of article 14 shall be interpreted by the Algerian 
Government in compliance with the basic founda-
tions of the Algerian legal system, in particular:
• With the Constitution, which stipulates in its 
article 2 that Islam is the state religion and 
in its article 35 that there shall be no infringe-
ment of the inviolability of the freedom 
of conviction and the inviolability of the 
freedom of opinion;
• With Law No. 84-11 of 9 June 1984, compris-
ing the Family Code, which stipulates that

a child’s education is to take place in accor-
dance with the religion of its father.”
(CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 11)
In contrast, a declaration from the Netherlands 
states its understanding that article 14 “is in 
accordance with the provisions of article 18 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights... and that this article shall include the 
freedom of a child to have or adopt a religion or 
belief of his or her choice as soon as the child is 
capable of making such choice in view of his or 
her age or maturity”. (CRC/C/2/Rev.8, p. 32)
Other States, where Islam is the state religion, 
made reservations focusing specifically on 
the child’s right to freedom of religion. For 
example: “[Iraq] ha[s] seen fit to accept it [the 
Convention]… subject to a reservation in respect 
of article 14, paragraph 1, concerning the child’s 
freedom of religion, as allowing a child to change 
his or her religion runs counter to the provisions 
of the Islamic Shariah.”; “The Government of the 
Republic of Maldives expresses its reservation to 
paragraph 1 of article 14…, since the Constitution 
and the laws of the Republic of Maldives stipu-
late that all Maldives should be Muslims”; “The 
Kingdom of Morocco, whose Constitution guar-
antees to all the freedom to pursue his religious 
affairs, makes a reservation to the provisions of 
article 14, which accords children freedom of 
religion, in view of the fact that Islam is the state 
religion”; “The Sultanate [of Oman] does not con-
sider itself to be bound by those provisions of 
article 14 of the Convention that accord a child 
the right to choose his or her religion or those of 
its article 30 that allow a child belonging to a reli-
gious minority to profess his or her own religion.” 
(CRC/C/2/Rev.8, pp. 26, 29, 30, 35)
Article 51 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child states: “A reservation incompatible with 
the object and purpose of the present Convention 
shall not be permitted.” Ten States Parties have 
recorded objections to certain of these reserva-
tions to article 14 (see CRC/C/2/Rev.8, pp. 48 et 
seq.). The Committee has expressed concern at 
reservations that suggest lack of full recognition 
of the child as a subject of rights and, consistent 
with its general policy, the Committee has urged 
States to review and withdraw all reservations 
(see article 4, page 49).
In some States, courts have powers to overrule 
parents who have refused certain types of medi-
cal treatment for their children on the grounds of 
religious conviction. Under the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, it is clear that the State should 
have such powers to seek intervention. Under 
article 3(2), “States undertake to ensure the child 
such protection and care as is necessary for his 
or her well-being, taking into account the rights 
and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, 
or other individuals legally responsible for him 
or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate 
legislative and administrative measures.” Under 
article 12, the child’s views should be appropri-
ately respected in any proceedings. Respect for 
children’s refusal of treatment on grounds of their 
own religious convictions is dependent on their 
evolving capacities and on consideration of the 
Convention’s general principles. 
When parents disagree over 
the child’s religion 
The Convention on the Rights of the Child 
requires States to recognize the principle that 
“both parents have common responsibilities for 
the upbringing and development of the child” (art-
icle 18). This must apply to the qualified parental 
direction that article 14 authorizes in the exer-
cise by the child of his or her right to freedom of 
religion. Neither parent should have “authority” 
over such matters. Where there is disagreement 
and the matter goes to court, the matter should 
be decided on the basis of the child’s right under 
article 14, with the child’s views taken seriously 
according to his or her age and maturity. 
The child’s right to freedom 
of religion in alternative care 
When children are separated from their families 
and are in alternative care provided by the State 
or otherwise, article 14 of the Convention requires 
that their right to freedom of religion must be 
maintained. In many countries, religious orga-
nizations are prominent in providing alternative 
care for children. Article 20(3) states that when 
considering alternative care for a child, “due 
regard shall be paid to the desirability of continu-
ity in a child’s upbringing and to the child’s eth-
nic, religious, cultural and linguistic background” 
(see article 20, page 288). But inflexible laws 
requiring that the child should automatically be 
brought up in the religion of his or her parent(s) 
do not respect the child’s right to freedom of reli-
gion guaranteed by article 14.
Religious communities
Under article 14, the ability of children to decide 
to join or leave a religious community should be 
subject to parental direction, exercised in accor-
dance with their evolving capacities, and to the 
particular restrictions in paragraph 3. Some States 
have legislated on these issues.
Schooling and freedom of religion
Ensuring freedom of religion in the context of 
compulsory education has become an increasing 
concern for the Committee.

Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
190
In its first General Comment, issued in 2001, on 
“The aims of education”, the Committee empha-
sizes that “children do not lose their human rights 
by virtue of passing through the school gates” 
and highlights the importance of schools respect-
ing children’s participation rights (Committee on 
the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 1, 
2001, CRC/GC/2001/1, para. 8).
As noted above (page 188), the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires 
States (in article 18(4)) to respect “the liberty of 
parents and, when applicable, legal guardians 
to ensure the religious and moral education of 
their children in conformity with their own con-
victions”. In its General Comment on this provi-
sion, the Human Rights Committee states: “The 
Committee is of the view that article 18(4) per-
mits public school instruction in subjects such 
as the general history of religions and ethics if it 
is given in a neutral and objective way. The lib-
erty of parents or legal guardians to ensure their 
children receive a religious and moral education 
in conformity with their own convictions, set 
forth in article 18(4), is related to the guarantees 
of the freedom to teach a religion or belief stated 
in article 18(1). The Committee notes that public 
education that includes instruction in a particular 
religion or belief is inconsistent with article 18(4) 
unless provision is made for non-discriminatory 
exemptions or alternatives that would accom-
modate the wishes of parents and guardians.” 
(Human Rights Committee, General Comment 
No. 22, 1993, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 6, p. 196) 
But the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
requires that arrangements for moral and reli-
gious education be reviewed to ensure respect 
for the child’s right to freedom of religion, with 
parental direction provided in a manner consis-
tent with the child’s “evolving capacities”.
Some States do not allow religious teaching in 
state-supported education. In others, there may 
be religious education and worship or observance 
in one or more religions. Some States have set 
an age at which any control of the child’s mani-
festation of religion transfers from parents to the 
child, although the concept of “evolving capaci-
ties” in article 5 and article 14 appears to demand 
more flexibility.
The Committee expresses concern if the compul-
sory school curriculum does not provide for chil-
dren’s freedom of religion. For example:
“The Committee notes that the study of the 
history of the Armenian Apostolic Church 
in 2002 was made a compulsory subject in 
schools.
“In the light of article 14, the Committee 
recommends that the above-mentioned 
compulsory subject does not infringe upon 
the rights of children belonging to religious 
minorities.” (Armenia CRC/C/15/Add.225, 
paras. 31 and 32)
“While recognizing the State Party’s 
acceptance of freedom of religion, the 
Committee is concerned at the fact that classes 
on Catholicism are part of the curriculum, 
which is discriminatory for non-Catholic 
children.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party devise a curriculum that will ensure that 
the child’s freedom of religion can be fully 
realized in the educational system without any 
discrimination.” (Costa Rica CRC/C/15/Add.266, 
paras. 25 and 26)
Where religious education in schools is not com-
pulsory, or there are arrangements for exemption, 
the Committee questions whether they are ade-
quate to achieve freedom of religion:
“The Committee is concerned that, despite 
regulations guaranteeing that parents can 
choose for their children to attend ethics 
classes instead of religion classes in public 
schools, in practice few schools offer ethics 
courses to allow for such a choice and students 
require parental consent to attend ethics 
courses.
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party ensure that all public schools 
permit children, in practice, to choose freely 
whether to attend religion or ethics classes 
with parental direction provided in a manner 
consistent with the child’s evolving capacities.” 
(Poland CRC/C/15/Add.194, paras. 32 and 33) 
“The Committee is concerned that, as 
mentioned in the State Party’s report (para. 
147), children, especially in elementary schools, 
may suffer from marginalization if they abstain 
from religious instruction, which is mainly 
covering Catholic religion. In addition, the 
Committee is concerned that parents, notably 
those of foreign origin, are not always aware 
that religious instruction is not compulsory.
“In the light of articles 2, 14 and 29 of the 
Convention, the Committee recommends 
that the State Party make sure that parents, 
in particular of foreign origin, when they 
are filling out the relevant forms, are aware 
that Catholic religious instruction is not 
compulsory.” (Italy CRC/C/15/Add.198, paras. 29 
and 30) 
Commenting on Norway’s Second Report, the 
Committee suggested that a new system for pro-
viding exemptions from parts of the religious 
knowledge curriculum might be discriminatory:
“The Committee is concerned that the 
approach taken by the State Party’s Act No. 
61 of 17 July 1998 relating to primary, lower 
secondary and upper secondary education,

e
which introduces a new common curriculum on 
‘Religions, Knowledge and Ethical Education’, 
may be discriminatory. The Committee is 
concerned notably by the process of providing 
for exemptions to those children and parents 
who do not wish to participate in parts of the 
teaching. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party review the implementation of the 
new curriculum and consider an alternative 
exemption process.” (Norway CRC/C/15/Add.126, 
paras. 26 and 27)
It followed this up when it examined Norway’s 
Third Report:
“The Committee takes note of the Views of the 
Human Rights Committee under the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights of 3 November 2004 (CCPR/
C/82/D/1155/2003) regarding the teaching 
of the school subject Christian Knowledge 
and Religious and Ethical Education. In this 
regard, the Committee welcomes the State 
Party’s information on the planned changes 
of the Education Act to bring the teaching of 
Christian Knowledge and Religious and Ethical 
Education into full compliance with the right 
to freedom of religion enshrined in article 14 
of the Convention. The Committee encourages 
the State Party to expedite the process of 
adopting and enacting these changes.” 
(Norway, CRC/C/15/Add.263, para. 20)
The Committee was referring to the Views of the 
Human Rights Committee on an individual com-
munication from a group of Norwegian parents 
and children. Norway has a state religion and a 
state Church, of which approximately 86 per cent 
of the population are members. In August 1997, 
the Norwegian government introduced a new 
mandatory religious subject in the Norwegian 
school system, entitled “Christian Knowledge 
and Religious and Ethical Education” (CKREE), 
replacing the previous “Christianity” subject and 
the “life stance” subject. This new subject only 
provided for exemption from certain limited seg-
ments of the teaching. The applicants claimed that 
the State Party violated their rights to freedom of 
religion – i.e., their right to decide on the type of 
“life stance” upbringing and education their chil-
dren shall have - and their right to privacy. They 
also claimed that the partial exemption procedure 
violated the prohibition of discrimination.
The Human Rights Committee found a violation 
of article 18(4) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights: “The States Parties to 
the present Covenant undertake to have respect 
for the liberty of parents and, when applica-
ble, legal guardians to ensure the religious and 
moral education of their children in conformity 
with their own convictions”. The Committee told 
Norway that it was under an obligation to provide 
the authors with “an effective and appropriate 
remedy that will respect the right of the appli-
cants as parents to ensure and as pupils to receive 
an education that is in conformity with their own 
convictions. The State Party is under an obliga-
tion to avoid similar violations in the future.” 
(Human Rights Committee, Communication 
No. 1155/2003: Norway. 23/11/2004, CCPR/C/82/
D/1155/2003)
Another form of discrimination associated with 
school religion may arise when States provide 
funding for schooling in certain religions but not 
others.
The Committee has expressed concern at limita-
tions on children’s (and in some cases teachers’) 
freedom to wear religious symbols and/or cloth-
ing, raising issues under article 14 and also under 
article 13 (freedom of expression) and article 29 
(aims of education):
“The Committee is concerned about 
information brought to its attention which 
indicates that the exercise of the right to 
freedom of religion may not always be fully 
guaranteed, particularly with regard to 
regulations prohibiting the wearing of a 
headscarf by girls in schools.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take all necessary measures to ensure the 
full implementation of the right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion.” (Tunisia 
CRC/C/15/Add.181, paras. 29 and 30)
“The Committee notes the decision of the 
Constitutional Court of 24 September 2003 
(2 BvR 1436/02, Case Ludin) but is concerned 
at laws currently under discussion in some of 
the Länder aiming at banning schoolteachers 
from wearing headscarves in public schools, 
as this does not contribute to the child’s 
understanding of the right to freedom of 
religion and to the development of an attitude 
of tolerance as promoted in the aims of 
education under article 29 of the Convention.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take educational and other measures 
aimed at children, parents and others to 
develop a culture of understanding and 
tolerance, particularly in the area of freedom 
of religion, conscience and thought by, 
inter alia, avoiding measures which single out 
a particular religious group.” (Germany 
CRC/C/15/Add.226, paras. 30 and 31)
“The Committee notes that the Constitution 
provides for freedom of religion and that the 
law of 1905 on the separation of church and 
State prohibits discrimination on the basis 
of faith. The Committee equally recognizes 
the importance the State Party accords to 
secular public schools. However, in the light 
–> Table of Contents

Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
192
of articles 14 and 29 of the Convention, the 
Committee is concerned by the alleged rise 
in discrimination, including that based on 
religion. The Committee is also concerned 
that the new legislation (Law No. 2004-228 
of 15 March 2004) on wearing religious 
symbols and clothing in public schools may be 
counterproductive, by neglecting the principle 
of the best interests of the child and the right 
of the child to access to education, and not 
achieve the expected results. The Committee 
welcomes that the provisions of the legislation 
will be subject to an evaluation one year after 
its entry into force.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party, when evaluating the effects of the 
legislation, use the enjoyment of children’s 
rights, as enshrined in the Convention, as a 
crucial criteria in the evaluation process and 
also consider alternative means, including 
mediation, of ensuring secular character 
of public schools, while guaranteeing that 
individual rights are not infringed upon and 
that children are not excluded or marginalized 
from the school system and other settings 
as a result of such legislation. The dress code 
of schools may be better addressed within 
the public schools themselves, encouraging 
participation of children. The Committee 
further recommends that the State Party 
continue to closely monitor the situation of 
girls being expelled from schools as a result of 
the new legislation and ensure they enjoy the 
right of access to education.” (France CRC/C/15/
Add.240, paras. 25 and 26)
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
found, in addition, that issues affecting the 
child’s privacy may arise in relation to religion 
in schools. In considering the arrangements in 
Norway to allow opting out of religious educa-
tion, the Committee raised the need to respect the 
privacy of the child in relation to his or her reli-
gious faith: 
“The Committee notes that although 
an opting-out system exists for children 
wishing to abstain from compulsory religious 
education, this requires their parents to submit 
a formal request exposing the faith of the 
children involved and as such may be felt to 
be an infringement of their right to privacy.” 
(Norway CRC/C/15/Add.23, para. 9)
It raised similar discrimination and privacy issues 
with Greece:
“The Committee expresses its concern at 
reports of administrative and social pressures 
being placed on children from religious 
minorities including, for example, the 
requirement that a student’s secondary school 
graduation certificate indicate, where this is 
the case, that the student does not practise the 
Greek Orthodox religion.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party ensure that a child’s religious affiliation, 
or lack of one, in no way hinders respect for 
the child’s rights, including the right to non-
discrimination and to privacy, for example in 
the context of information included in the 
school graduation certificate.” (Greece 
CRC/C/15/Add.170, paras. 44 and 45)
Limitations on manifestation 
of religion: article 14(3)
The limitations allowed by paragraph 3 on the 
freedom “to manifest one’s religion or beliefs” 
are identical to those in article 18(3) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. In its General Comment referred to above, 
the Human Rights Committee “… notes that art-
icle 18 distinguishes the freedom of thought, con-
science, religion or belief  from the freedom to 
manifest religion or belief: “It does not permit 
any limitations whatsoever on the freedom of 
thought and conscience or on the freedom to have 
or adopt a religion or belief of one’s choice. These 
freedoms are protected unconditionally, as is the 
right of everyone to hold opinions without inter-
ference in article 19.1…” 
In relation to the freedom to manifest religion or 
belief, the Human Rights Committee emphasizes 
that restrictions are permitted “only if limitations 
are prescribed by law and are necessary to pro-
tect public safety, order, health or morals, or the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of others... In 
interpreting the scope of permissible limitation 
clauses, States Parties should proceed from the 
need to protect the rights guaranteed under the 
Covenant... Limitations imposed must be estab-
lished by law and must not be applied in a manner 
that would vitiate the rights guaranteed in article 
18. The Committee observes that paragraph 3 of 
article 18 is to be strictly interpreted: restrictions 
are not allowed on grounds not specified there, 
even if they would be allowed as restrictions to 
other rights protected in the Covenant, such as 
national security. Limitations may be applied 
only for those purposes for which they were pre-
scribed and must be directly related and propor-
tionate to the specific need on which they are 
predicated. Restrictions may not be imposed for 
discriminatory purposes or applied in a discrim-
inatory manner...” (Human Rights Committee, 
General Comment No. 22, 1993, HRI/GEN/1/
Rev.8, paras. 3 and 8, p. 196)
Discrimination on grounds of religion 
Article 2 requires States to respect and ensure 
the rights in the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child to each child in their jurisdiction without 
discrimination of any kind, irrespective of “the

r
t
i
c
l
e
child’s or his or her parent’s or legal guardian’s 
... religion...” Thus, under article 2 and article 14, 
the child must not suffer discrimination because 
of the child’s right to have a religion, or to have 
no religion, nor over the child’s right to manifest 
his or her religion.
In addition, there must be no discrimination 
affecting the child’s enjoyment of any other 
rights under the Convention on the grounds of 
the child’s, or his or her parent’s, religion. And 
article 2(2) requires States to take all appropriate 
measures to ensure that the child is protected 
against all forms of discrimination or punishment 
on the basis of the status, activities, expressed 
opinions or beliefs of the child’s parents, legal 
guardians or family members.
The Human Rights Committee, in its General 
Comment on article 18 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights quoted 
above, also emphasizes: “The fact that a religion 
is recognized as a state religion or that it is estab-
lished as official or traditional or that its followers 
comprise the majority of the population, shall not 
result in any impairment of the enjoyment of any 
of the rights under the Covenant... nor in any dis-
crimination against adherents to other religions 
or non-believers.” (Human Rights Committee, 
General Comment No. 22, 1993, HRI/GEN/1/
Rev.8, para. 9, p. 196)
Article 24(3) of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child requires States to “take all effective and 
appropriate measures with a view to abolishing 
traditional practices prejudicial to the health of 
children”. And article 19 requires States to ensure 
protection from “all forms of physical or mental 
violence”. Practices that stem from or are linked 
to manifestations and observance of religions 
must not involve breaches of these or any other 
articles of the Convention.
Children with disabilities and freedom of 
religion. The Standard Rules on the Equalization 
of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities 
includes a section on encouraging measures for 
equal participation in the religious life of their 
communities by persons with disabilities (rule 
12). It proposes that “States should encourage the 
distribution of information on disability matters 
to religious institutions and organizations. States 
should also encourage religious authorities to 
include information on disability policies in the 
training for religious professions, as well as in 
religious education programmes.”
Religion and children deprived of their 
liberty. The United Nations Rules for the 
Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty, 
which the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
has commended to States Parties, requires: 
“... The religious and cultural beliefs, practices 
and moral concepts of the juvenile should be 
respected” (rule 4). And in detail it states: “Every 
juvenile should be allowed to satisfy the needs of 
his or her religious and spiritual life, in particular 
by attending the services or meetings provided in 
the detention facility or by conducting his or her 
own services and having possession of the nec-
essary books or items of religious observance 
and instruction of his or her denomination. If a 
detention facility contains a sufficient number of 
juveniles of a given religion, one or more quali-
fied representatives of that religion should be 
appointed or approved and allowed to hold regu-
lar services and to pay pastoral visits in private to 
juveniles at their request. Every juvenile should 
have the right to receive visits from a qualified 
representative of any religion of his or her choice, 
as well as the right not to participate in religious 
services and freely to decline religious education, 
counselling or indoctrination.” (Rule 48)
In its General Comment, quoted above, the 
Human Rights Committee also emphasized that 
“Persons already subject to certain legitimate 
constraints, such as prisoners, continue to enjoy 
their rights to manifest their religion or belief 
to the fullest extent compatible with the spe-
cific nature of the constraint.” (Human Rights 
Committee, General Comment No. 22, 1993, 
HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 8, p. 196)

civil rights, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child has encouraged their incorporation into 
States’ own legislation with specific reference to 
children’s rights. The Committee has emphasized 
that the only restrictions that may be applied are 
those set out in paragraph 2 of article 15. 
■
ogether with articles 12 and 13, the 
rights to freedom of association and 
freedom of peaceful assembly promote 
the child as an active, participating 
member of society. Article 12 sets out the right of 
individual children to express their views freely; 
article 15 adds rights of collective participation. 
Previous human rights instruments have pro-
moted these rights for “everyone”. As with other 
Text of Article 15
1. States Parties recognize the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom 
of peaceful assembly.
2. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of these rights other than those imposed in 
conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of 
national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health 
or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

The child’s right to freedom 
of association
Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights states: “1. Everyone has the right to free-
dom of peaceful assembly and association.
2. No one may be compelled to belong to an asso-
ciation.” The International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights reasserts these rights in its art-
icles 21 and 22, noting also the specific right to 
form and join trade unions, and applying the same 
limited restrictions as are set out in paragraph 2 
of article 15 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. While in many States constitutional 
principles, echoing the international instruments, 
confer a right of association on “everyone”, the 
implications of recognizing this right for children 
are still not widely explored. The Committee on 
the Rights of the Child has recommended that 
the rights for children guaranteed by article 15 
should be reflected in legislation. The right to 
freedom of association includes association with 
an individual as well as with a group, so long as 
the individual does not threaten the child’s other 
rights, including to protection.
Freedom of association implies the right to form 
associations as well as to join and to leave associ-
ations. In recommendations adopted following its 
2006 Day of General Discussion on “The right of 
the child to be heard”, the Committee recognizes 
the important role played by non-governmental 
organizations in facilitating the active participa-
tion and organization of children and youth at the 
national and international level:
“Furthermore, the Committee welcomes the 
increasing number of youth-led organizations 
in various parts of the world. In this context, 
the Committee reminds States Parties of the 
right to exercise freedom of association as 
stipulated in article 15 of the Convention.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the forty-third session, September 2006, Day of 
General Discussion, Recommendations, para. 33) 
The Guidelines for Periodic Reports (Revised 
2005) asks States to provide data on the number of 
child and youth organizations or associations and 
the number of members they represent, and also 
on the number of schools with independent student 
councils (CRC/C/58/Rev.1, Annex, paras. 6 and 7).
The Committee has specifically commended the 
establishment of student organizations in schools 
and children’s organizations in local munici-
palities. Various States’ reports have described 
legislation providing for schools councils and 
the structures enabling children to have a say in 
decision-making within their local community 
(see also article 12, page 151).
In its first General Comment, issued in 2001, on 
“The aims of education”, the Committee empha-
sizes that
“Children do not lose their human rights by 
virtue of passing through the school gates…” 
(CRC/GC/2001/1, para. 8)
and highlights the importance of schools respect-
ing children’s participation rights. The Committee 
commented on Honduras’ Second Report:
“Although the Committee notes with 
appreciation the enactment of the Education 
Reform Law, which encourages and increases 
the participation of children in schools, it is still 
concerned that participatory rights of children 
have not been sufficiently developed in the 
State Party. In addition, concern is also expressed 
at the existing legal prohibition of students’ 
organizations in secondary schools, which is 
contrary to the child’s rights to freedom of 
association and peaceful assembly. In light of 
articles 15 and 16 and other related articles of the 
Convention, the Committee recommends that 
further measures, including legislative reform, 
be undertaken to promote the participation 
of children in the family, school and social life, 
as well as the effective enjoyment of their 
fundamental freedoms, including the freedoms 
of opinion, expression, and association.” 
(Honduras CRC/C/15/Add.105, para. 22)
It should be noted that, in general, the law concern-
ing contracts and administration of organizations 
may pose obstacles for children below the age of 
majority or the age of legal capacity acting as direc-
tors or trustees of public associations. It seems that 
few countries have as yet explored this from the 
perspective of the full implementation of article 15. 
The Committee has expressed concern at limits 
on children joining or establishing political orga-
nizations. For example:
“The Committee is concerned about 
restrictions on political activities undertaken 
by schoolchildren both on and off school 
campuses… 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party review legislation and regulations 
governing activities undertaken by 
schoolchildren on and off campus…” (Japan 
CRC/C/15/Add.231, paras. 29 and 30)
“The Committee is concerned at the 
contradiction between the information 
provided by the Ministry of Education in the 
State Party’s report whereby students have 
the right to freedom of association, including 
the right to participate in students’ political 
parties, and article 18 of the Childhood and 
Adolescence Code which establishes that 
persons below the age of 18 have the right to 
freedom of association, except for political or 
lucrative activities.

“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take appropriate measures to ensure 
the coherence of its legislation with regard to 
the right of persons below the age of 18 to be 
involved in political activities.” (Costa Rica 
CRC/C/15/Add.266, paras. 23 and 24)
The Committee commented to Georgia:
“The Committee notes with concern that the 
law prohibits youth from becoming members 
of political parties and that this prohibition 
limits the opportunity for youth to learn about 
the political process, delays their preparation 
for political leadership, and denies their full 
right to freedom of association. 
“In the light of article 15 of the Convention, 
the Committee recommends that the State 
Party amend its legislation to ensure that 
youth are allowed to join political parties and 
that they fully enjoy their right to freedom of 
association.” (Georgia CRC/C/15/ Add.124, 
paras. 30 and 31)
Following examination of Georgia’s Second 
Report, the Committee acknowledged progress:
“The Committee welcomes the information 
provided in the State Party’s report on the 
Children’s Parliament, the Children’s Forum and 
the Georgian Children’s Federation, as well as 
on the provisions of the Children’s and Youth 
Associations Act, and notes the resolution 
of the Children’s Parliament recommending 
representation of children with disabilities and 
children in institutions among its membership. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party continue and strengthen its efforts 
to promote and support these and other 
activities of children and in particular facilitate 
and support participation of children with 
disabilities and children in institutions.” 
(Georgia CRC/C/15/Add.222, paras. 30 and 31)
Unlike the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child does not uphold the specific right of 
children to “form and join trade unions for the 
protection of his interests” (article 22(1) of the 
Covenant). But the right is implied in the right 
to freedom of association, and the limitations in 
article 15(2) would not justify preventing children 
from forming or joining unions. Article 32 sets 
out States’ duties to prevent economic and other 
exploitation in labour (see page 479).
The child’s right to freedom of 
peaceful assembly
The importance of article 15 is its emphasis on 
children as holders of fundamental civil rights, 
including the right to engage in peaceful activi-
ties as a group. The only restrictions on this right 
must be defined in legislation and come within 
the restrictions allowed under paragraph 2 of the 
article (see below).
Thus, for example, the Committee expressed 
concern to Belize about the response to a student 
demonstration:
“The Committee is concerned about the 
limitations on the exercise of the right 
to freedom of expression by children. 
The Committee notes with concern the 
violent incidents during a peaceful student 
demonstration against a rise in bus fares, 
which took place in the village of Benque Viejo 
del Carmen on 24 April 2002, and the reported 
disproportionate use of force by the police 
authorities.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party encourage and facilitate the exercise 
by children of their right to freedom of 
expression, including their right to freedom 
of association and of peaceful assembly, so 
that they can freely discuss, participate and 
express their views and opinions on all matters 
affecting them.” (Belize CRC/C/15/Add.252, 
paras. 38 and 39)
Restrictions on the child’s 
rights: article 15(2)
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
stressed that the rights in article 15 may only be 
restricted in accordance with paragraph 2 of art-
icle 15; restrictions must be defined in legislation 
and be necessary for one of the specific reasons 
set out in the article:
“The Committee is concerned that although 
the freedoms of expression and assembly 
are formally recognized in the Constitution, 
the exercise of these rights by children are 
restricted by vaguely worded limitation clauses 
(i.e. ‘in accordance with Islamic criteria’), which 
potentially exceed the permitted restrictions 
set out in paragraph 2 of articles 13 and 15 of 
the Convention. The Committee is concerned 
at reports of incidents of threats and violence 
by vigilante groups, such as Ansari-Hezbollah, 
directed at persons seeking to exercise or to 
promote the exercise of these rights. 
”The Committee recommends that the State 
Party establish clear criteria to assess whether 
a given action or expression is in accordance 
with interpretations of Islamic texts, and 
consider appropriate and proportionate means 
to protect public morals while safeguarding 
the right of every child to freedom of 
expression and assembly.” (Islamic Republic of 
Iran CRC/C/15/Add.123, paras. 33 and 34)
When it examined Iran’s Second Report, the 
Committee maintained its concern:
“The Committee remains concerned that, 
although freedom of expression and of 
assembly is formally recognized in the 
Constitution, the protection of this freedom 
is restricted by the requirement to interpret it

in accordance with Islamic principles without 
clarifying at the outset the basis on which an 
action or expression is considered to be in 
keeping with such principles.
“The Committee reiterates its recommendation, 
expressed in its previous Concluding 
Observations, that the State Party establish 
clear criteria for determining whether a given 
action or expression is in accordance with 
Islamic law and the Convention in order to 
avoid arbitrary interpretations.” (Islamic Republic 
of Iran CRC/C/15/Add.254, paras. 39 and 40)
In some countries, there are laws limiting chil-
dren’s rights to association and peaceful assembly 
during certain hours – curfews, often imposed to 
prevent unaccompanied children from being out 
of their homes after a certain time in the evening 
and often related to the age of the child. Such 
blanket restrictions on the child’s right do not 
appear to fall within the very limited restrictions 
allowed in paragraph 2 of article 15.
The Committee commented to Panama:
“The Committee regrets the lack of specific 
information about the implementation of 
the civil rights of children (arts. 13-17). The 
Committee is also concerned at reports 
that marginalized poor adolescents have 
been arrested, ill-treated and/or detained, 
apparently without legal basis, when 
gathering together.
“The Committee urges the State Party to 
provide in its next report specific information 
about the implementation of these rights and 
to protect adolescents against illegal arrest, 
detention and ill-treatment.” (Panama 
CRC/C/15/Add.233, paras. 31 and 32)
Unlike article 14, article 15 makes no reference to 
respecting the rights of parents to provide direc-
tion to the child in the exercise of the child’s right 
in a manner consistent with the evolving capaci-
ties of the child, but this principle is upheld gen-
erally in article 5 (see page 75). Some States 
indicated in their Initial Reports that there is an 
age below which children are not permitted to 
join associations or to do so without the agree-
ment of their parents. The Convention provides 
no support for arbitrary limitations on the child’s 
right to freedom of association. The Committee 
told Japan it was concerned 
“... that children below the age of 18 require 
parental consent to join an association”,
and recommended 
“… that the State Party review legislation 
and regulations… in order to ensure the full 
implementation of articles 13, 14 and 15 of the 
Convention.” (Japan CRC/C/15/Add.231, paras. 29 
and 30)
Children with disabilities. A particular 
emphasis of the World Programme of Action 
Concerning Disabled Persons has been the pro-
motion of the establishment and development of 
associations of people with disabilities. The inclu-
sion in the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
of a specific article on children with disabilities 
(article 23), as well as the explicit inclusion of 
“disability” as one of the grounds of discrimi-
nation barred by article 2, emphasizes the equal 
right of children with disabilities to all civil 
rights, including the right to freedom of associ-
ation and peaceful assembly. The Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted 
in December 2006, requires States to ensure that 
persons with disabilities can effectively and fully 
participate in political and public life on an equal 
basis with others, and to promote actively an envi-
ronment in which persons with disabilities can 
effectively and fully participate, including par-
ticipation in non-governmental organizations and 
associations, and forming and joining organiza-
tions of persons with disabilities at international, 
national, regional and local levels (article 29). 
Children deprived of their liberty. The 
rights under article 15 for children deprived of 
their liberty are emphasized in the United Nations 
Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of 
their Liberty, which the Committee has promoted 
as providing appropriate standards for implemen-
tation of the Convention. In general, the Rules 
requires that “Juveniles deprived of their liberty 
shall not for any reason related to their status be 
denied the civil, economic, political, social or 
cultural rights to which they are entitled under 
national or international law, and which are com-
patible with the restriction of liberty.” (Rule 13) 
More specifically, the Rules requires that “Every 
means should be provided to ensure that juve-
niles have adequate communication with the out-
side world, which is an integral part of the right to 
fair and humane treatment and is essential to the 
preparation of juveniles for their return to society. 
Juveniles should be allowed to communicate with 
their families, friends and other persons or rep-
resentatives of reputable outside organizations, 
to leave detention facilities for a visit to their 
home and family and to receive special permis-
sion to leave the detention facility for educational, 
vocational or other important reasons...” (Rule 59)

alternative care, and all institutions, facilities 
and services. In addition, the article protects the 
child’s family and home from arbitrary or unlaw-
ful interference. The article raises issues con-
cerning the physical environment in which the 
child lives, the privacy of his or her relationships 
and communications with others, including rights 
to confidential advice and counselling, control 
of access to information stored about the child 
in records or files, and so on. Inevitably, chil-
dren’s rights to privacy within the family vary 
according to family structures, living conditions 
and economic and other factors determining the 
private space available to the child. 
In addition to article 16, article 40(2)(b)(vii) 
requires that a child alleged as or accused of hav-
ing infringed the penal law should “... have his 
or her privacy fully respected at all stages of the 
proceedings”; the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child has suggested this respect should also 
apply to children in family proceedings and 
when children are victims of violence. And the 
Committee has emphasized the importance of 
the media respecting children’s privacy.  
■
rticle 16 provides for the right of 
every child to be protected by the 
law against arbitrary or unlawful 
interference with his or her pri-
vacy, family, home or correspondence as well as 
against unlawful attacks on his honour and 
reputation.
Like the previous three articles, article 16 applies 
specifically to the child a fundamental civil 
right already established for everyone in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Article 12 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights uses similar wording (but 
without the qualifying “unlawful” before the 
words “interference” and “attacks”). The word-
ing in article 17 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, ensuring that “no 
one” is subject to such interference, is otherwise 
identical to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child.
Article 16 must apply to all children without dis-
crimination. The child’s privacy is to be protected 
in all situations, including within the family, 
Text of Article 16
1. No child shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, 
family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation.
2. The child has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

“No child shall be subjected 
to arbitrary or unlawful 
interference with his or 
her privacy ...”
Some concern arose in the Working Group dur-
ing the drafting of article 16 in regard to the role 
of parents, but it was ultimately resolved by the 
inclusion in the Convention of article 5, which 
requires respect for parents and legal guardians 
to provide direction and guidance to the child in 
the exercise by the child of his or her rights, in 
a manner consistent with the evolving capacities 
of the child (for example, see E/CN.4/1987/25, 
pp. 26 and 27; Detrick, p. 258).
Various States have issued declarations or reser-
vations concerning the relationship between par-
ents and their children’s civil rights, mentioning 
article 16. When examining Initial Reports, the 
Committee has consistently asked for a review 
and withdrawal of declarations and reservations; 
in particular, it has expressed concern at reser-
vations that suggest lack of full recognition of 
the child as a subject of rights. The Committee 
has expressed concern at the lack of the article’s 
reflection in national legislation, along with other 
civil rights of the child. 
The Committee has welcomed appropriate legis-
lation but noted that additional measures, includ-
ing for example secondary legislation controlling 
particular settings, are needed to guarantee the 
right to privacy in practice:
“In the light of its recommendation (see 
Nicaragua CRC/C/15/Add.36, para. 34), 
the Committee welcomes the fact that 
domestic legislation (Code on Children and 
Adolescents)… guarantees … protection of the 
child’s right to privacy (art. 16). However, the 
Committee remains concerned about the lack 
of secondary legislation regulating the practical 
implementation of these rights. The Committee 
encourages the State Party to continue with 
its process of legal reform and allocation of 
appropriate resources in order to establish 
practical procedures and regulations … to 
guarantee [children’s] … right to privacy…” 
(Nicaragua CRC/C/15/Add.108, para. 28)
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
identified certain specific situations in reports 
that raise issues under article 16. One example is 
the provision in one State Party which requires 
the recording of the child’s or his or her parent’s 
religion in relation to religious education in school 
and in other States Parties on children’s gradua-
tion certificates, identity cards or passports (on 
which ethnic origin is also recorded):
“The Committee notes that although 
an opting-out system exists for children 
wishing to abstain from compulsory religious 
education, this requires their parents to submit 
a formal request exposing the faith of the 
children involved and as such may be felt to be 
an infringement of their right to privacy...
“The Committee suggests that the State Party 
reconsider its policy on religious education for 
children in the light of the general principle of 
non-discrimination and the right to privacy.” 
(Norway CRC/C/15/Add.23, paras. 9 and 23)
“The Committee ... further takes note with 
concern of the requirement to record ethnic 
origin in passports.
“In the field of the right to citizenship, the 
Committee is of the view that the State 
Party should, in the light of articles 2 (non-
discrimination) and 3 (best interests of the 
child), abolish the categorization of citizens, 
as well as mention on the national identity 
card of the religion and of the ethnic origin of 
citizens, including children. In the view of the 
Committee, all possibility of stigmatization and 
denial of rights recognized by the Convention 
should be avoided.” (Myanmar CRC/C/15/
Add.69, para. 34)
“The Committee expresses its concern at 
reports of administrative and social pressures 
being placed on children from religious 
minorities including, for example, the 
requirement that a student’s secondary school 
graduation certificate indicate, where this is 
the case, that the student does not practise the 
Greek Orthodox religion.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party ensure that a child’s religious affiliation, 
or lack of one, in no way hinders respect for 
the child’s rights, including the right to non-
discrimination and to privacy, for example in 
the context of information included in the 
school graduation certificate.” (Greece CR/C/15/
Add.170, paras. 44 and 45)
“... It further reiterates the recommendation 
of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination to reconsider the requirement 
to record ethnic origin in passports (A/54/18, 
para. 407).” (Latvia CRC/C/15/ Add.142, paras. 23 
and 24)
When it examined Latvia’s Second Report, the 
Committee 
“... welcomed the decision to remove the 
mandatory requirement to record ethnic origin 
in passports.” (Latvia CRC/C/LVA/CO/2, para. 28)
Confidential advice for children
In its General Comment No. 4 on “Adolescent 
health and development in the context of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child”, the 
Committee addresses the issues of confiden-
tiality and privacy in relation to adolescent 
health:
–> Table of Contents

CHILD’S RIGHT TO PRIVACY
205
a
r
t
i
c
l
e
“In order to promote the health and 
development of adolescents, States Parties are 
also encouraged to respect strictly their right 
to privacy and confidentiality, including with 
respect to advice and counselling on health 
matters (art. 16). Health care providers have 
an obligation to keep confidential medical 
information concerning adolescents, bearing 
in mind the basic principles of the Convention. 
Such information may only be disclosed with 
the consent of the adolescent, or in the same 
situations applying to the violation of an 
adult’s confidentiality. Adolescents deemed 
mature enough to receive counselling without 
the presence of a parent or other person 
are entitled to privacy and may request 
confidential services, including treatment.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 4, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/4, para. 11)
The General Comment also asserts adolescents’ 
right to give informed consent to medical treat-
ment:
“With regard to privacy and confidentiality, 
and the related issue of informed consent 
to treatment, States Parties should (a) enact 
laws or regulations to ensure that confidential 
advice concerning treatment is provided 
to adolescents so that they can give their 
informed consent. Such laws or regulations 
should stipulate an age for this process, or 
refer to the evolving capacity of the child; 
and (b) provide training for health personnel 
on the rights of adolescents to privacy and 
confidentiality, to be informed about planned 
treatment and to give their informed consent 
to treatment.” (CRC/GC/2003/4, para. 33)
The original Guidelines for Periodic Reports, 
under article 1 (definition of the child), seeks 
information on any minimum age defined in 
legislation for the child to have the right to 
receive “legal and medical counselling with-
out parental consent”, and “medical treatment 
or surgery without parental consent”. These 
involve privacy issues: the right of the child to 
seek confidential advice on legal and medical 
matters, and the further right to confidential 
treatment, including, for example, contracep-
tion, and abortion where permitted (see article 
1, page 7). The Convention does not support 
the setting of any arbitrary age below which 
the child does not have such rights. But article 
5 enables parents to provide direction and guid-
ance in a manner consistent with the evolving 
capacities of the child.
Medical and other professionals often have 
ethical codes requiring them to respect patient/
client confidentiality. When a child is the patient 
or client, the principles and provisions of the 
Convention provide a framework for clarifying 
the child’s rights, in particular in relation to his 
or her parents.
On occasions, the Committee has focused on 
confidentiality in health services from the child’s 
perspective. For example:
“The Committee remains concerned that the 
right of access to medical advice and treatment 
without parental consent, such as testing for 
HIV/AIDS, may be compromised in instances 
where the bill for such services is sent to the 
parents, violating the confidentiality of the 
doctor-child relationship. The Committee 
recommends that the State Party take 
adequate measures to ensure that medical 
advice and treatment remain confidential for 
children of appropriate age and maturity, 
in accordance with articles 12 and 16 of the 
Convention.” (Netherlands CRC/C/15/Add.114, 
para. 19)
The Committee raised privacy concerns over the 
practice of virginity testing in South Africa:
“… The Committee is also concerned about 
the traditional practice of virginity testing 
which threatens the health, affects the self-
esteem, and violates the privacy of girls… The 
Committee also recommends that the State 
Party undertake a study on virginity testing 
to assess its physical and psychological impact 
on girls. In this connection, the Committee 
further recommends that the State Party 
introduce sensitization and awareness-raising 
programmes for practitioners and the general 
public to change traditional attitudes and 
discourage the practice of virginity testing 
in the light of articles 16 and 24(3) of the 
Convention.” (South Africa CRC/C/15/Add.122, 
para. 33)
Protection from interference
In 1988, the Human Rights Committee issued a 
detailed General Comment on article 17 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, which concerns the right to privacy. It 
provides relevant definitions and explanation, in 
particular that:
• the individual must be protected from inter-
ference not only by state authorities but also 
by others;
• the State must provide legislative and other 
measures to prohibit such interference;
• interference can only take place in ways 
defined in law, which must not be arbitrary, 
must comply with the provisions, aims and 
objectives of the Covenant, and be reasonable 
in the particular circumstances;
• the State should enable individuals to complain 
when they believe their right has been vio-
lated and the State should provide appropriate 
remedies.

Privacy in institutions
The privacy of children in institutions, in par-
ticular in residential institutions and custodial 
institutions, can be particularly threatened by the 
physical environment and design, by overcrowd-
ing, lack of appropriate supervision and so on. 
(Indeed, Costa Rica’s Initial Report identified the 
closure of large institutions and orphanages as 
“an essential step” for the protection of children’s 
privacy (Costa Rica CRC/C/65/Add.7, paras. 122 
to 124)). Also, the use of video surveillance in 
institutions can breach children’s privacy rights.
Article 16 requires that the child’s right to pri-
vacy is protected by law. Hence, in institutions 
there should be minimum requirements on space, 
including private space, design of toilets and 
bathrooms, and so on. These issues are covered 
in the United Nations Rules for the Protection of 
Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (see below) 
and are equally relevant to all institutional place-
ments. Article 3(3) of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child requires that institutions, ser-
vices and facilities responsible for the care or pro-
tection of children shall conform to the standards 
established by competent authorities (see page 41). 
Standards must reflect the provisions of the 
Convention, including the child’s right to privacy, 
without discrimination:
“While noting that the right to privacy of 
correspondence and telephone conversations 
is protected in article 27 of the Constitution, 
the Committee is concerned at the lack 
of information on rules, regulations and 
practice regarding the protection of this right, 
particularly for children in institutions.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party submit specific information on these 
rules, regulations and practice, and on the 
procedure for submission and handling of 
complaints in case of violations of the rights to 
privacy.” (Uzbekistan CRC/C/UZB/CO/2, paras. 34 
and 35)
The Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, adopted in December 2006, under-
lines privacy rights, stating that: “No person with 
disabilities, regardless of place of residence or 
living arrangements, shall be subjected to arbi-
trary or unlawful interference with his or her pri-
vacy, family, home or correspondence or other 
types of communication or to unlawful attacks 
on his or her honour and reputation. Persons with 
disabilities have the right to the protection of the 
law against such interference or attacks.
“States Parties shall protect the privacy of per-
sonal, health and rehabilitation information of 
persons with disabilities on an equal basis with 
others.” (Article 22)
The Human Rights Committee emphasizes that 
States Parties are under a duty themselves not to 
engage in interference incompatible with article 
17 and to provide the legislative framework pro-
hibiting such acts by natural or legal persons. 
Also, States Parties pay too little attention to the 
fact that article 17 deals with protection against 
both unlawful and arbitrary interference: “That 
means that it is precisely in state legislation above 
all that provision must be made for the protec-
tion of the right set forth in that article... The 
term ‘unlawful’ means that no interference can 
take place except in cases envisaged by the law. 
Interference authorized by States can only take 
place on the basis of law, which itself must com-
ply with the provisions, aims and objectives of 
the Covenant.
“The expression ‘arbitrary interference’ is also 
relevant to the protection of the right provided for 
in article 17. In the Committee’s view, the expres-
sion ‘arbitrary interference’ can also extend to 
interference provided for under the law. The intro-
duction of the concept of arbitrariness is intended 
to guarantee that even interference provided for 
by law should be in accordance with the provi-
sions, aims and objectives of the Covenant and 
should be, in any event, reasonable in the partic-
ular circumstances.”
The Human Rights Committee suggests reports 
should include information on the authorities and 
organs set up within the legal system of the State 
that are “competent to authorize interference 
allowed by the law”: “It is also indispensable to 
have information on the authorities which are 
entitled to exercise control over such interference 
with strict regard for the law, and to know in what 
manner and through which organs persons con-
cerned may complain of a violation of the right 
provided for in article 17 of the Covenant. States 
should in their reports make clear the extent to 
which actual practice conforms to the law. State 
Party reports should also contain information 
on complaints lodged in respect of arbitrary or 
unlawful interference, and the number of any 
findings in that regard, as well as the remedies 
provided in such cases.”
The Human Rights Committee notes that “As all 
persons live in society, the protection of privacy 
is necessarily relative. However, the competent 
public authorities should only be able to call for 
such information relating to an individual’s pri-
vate life the knowledge of which is essential in 
the interests of society as understood under the 
Covenant.” (Human Rights Committee, General 
Comment No. 16, 1988, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 7, 
p. 182)

The Committee has raised concerns about 
searches of children:
“… the Committee is also concerned about 
reports of children in alternative care being 
subject to an increasing number of searches 
of their person and their belongings.” (New 
Zealand CRC/C/15/Add.216, para. 31)
“The Committee is concerned that children’s 
right to privacy is not fully respected, in 
particular, with regard to the searching of 
a child’s belongings, and the fact that staff 
in institutions may interfere with a child’s 
personal correspondence. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party: 
(a) Ensure the full implementation of a child’s 
right to privacy, including with respect to 
personal correspondence and searching of 
personal effects; 
(b) Amend the Minimum Standards for Child 
Welfare Institutions so as to bring them into 
conformity with article 16 of the Convention.” 
(Japan CRC/C/15/Add.231, paras. 33 and 34) 
Privacy for those whose liberty is restricted. 
The United Nations Rules for the Protection 
of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty has vari-
ous relevant provisions. First, there is the general 
principle in rule 13 which states that juveniles 
deprived of their liberty must not be denied any 
entitlement under national or international law to 
civil or other rights that are compatible with the 
deprivation of liberty; in addition, there are spe-
cific provisions relating to files (see page 209), 
design and physical environment, personal 
effects, visits, correspondence (see page 210) and 
the conduct of personnel. 
The design of detention facilities for juveniles and 
the physical environment should pay due regard to 
the juvenile’s need for privacy (rule 32); sanitary 
installations should be so located and of a suffi-
cient standard to enable every juvenile “to comply, 
as required, with their physical needs in privacy 
and in a clean and decent manner” (rule 34). 
Rule 35 states that “The possession of personal 
effects is a basic element of the right to privacy 
and essential to the psychological well-being of 
the juveniles. The right of every juvenile to pos-
sess personal effects and to have adequate storage 
facilities for them should be fully recognized and 
respected...” Circumstances for visits to the juve-
nile should “respect the need of the juvenile for 
privacy, contact and unrestricted communication 
with the family and the defence counsel” (rule 
60). Personnel involved with juveniles deprived 
of their liberty “should respect the right of the 
juvenile to privacy and, in particular, should safe-
guard all confidential matters concerning juve-
niles or their families learned as a result of their 
professional capacity” (rule 87(e)). 
Privacy in juvenile justice, child 
protection and other proceedings
In addition to article 16, article 40 requires, in the 
case of children alleged as or accused of having 
infringed the penal law, “to have his or her pri-
vacy fully respected at all stages of the proceed-
ings” (see page 615). 
In its General Comment No. 10 on “Children’s 
rights in Juvenile Justice”, the Committee com-
ments in detail on the right to privacy: 
“The right of the child to have his/her 
privacy fully respected in all stages of the 
proceedings reflects the right to protection 
of privacy enshrined in article 16. ‘All stages 
of the proceedings’ includes from the initial 
contact with law enforcement (e.g., a request 
for information and identification) up until 
the final decision by a competent authority 
or release from supervision, custody or 
deprivation of liberty. It is in this particular 
context meant to avoid harm caused by 
undue publicity or by the process of labelling. 
No information shall be published that may 
lead to the identification of a child offender 
because of its effect of stigmatization, and 
possible impact on their ability to obtain 
an education, work, housing or to be safe. 
It means that a public authority should be 
very reluctant with press releases related to 
offences allegedly committed by children and 
limit them to very exceptional cases. They 
must take measures to guarantee that children 
are not identifiable via these press releases. 
Journalists who violate the right to privacy 
of a child in conflict with the law should 
be sanctioned with disciplinary and when 
necessary (e.g., in case of recidivism) with 
penal law sanctions.” (Committee on the Rights 
of the Child, General Comment No. 10, 2007, 
CRC/C/GC/10, para. 23l)
The Committee notes that in order to protect the 
privacy of the child, most States Parties have as 
a rule – sometimes with the possibility of excep-
tions – that the court or other hearings of a child 
accused of an infringement of the penal law 
should take place behind closed doors. This rule 
allows for the presence of experts or other profes-
sionals with the special permission of the court. 
Public hearings in juvenile justice should only be 
possible in well-defined cases and with a written 
decision of the court. Such a decision should be 
open to appeal by the child.
It recommends that all States Parties should intro-
duce the rule that court and other hearings of a 
child in conflict with the law should be conducted 
behind closed doors. Exceptions to this rule 
should be very limited and be clearly stated in the 
law. The verdict/sentence should be pronounced

in public at a session of the court in such a way 
that the identity of the child is not revealed: 
“The right to privacy (art. 16) requires all 
professionals involved in the implementation 
of the measures taken by the court or another 
competent authority to keep all information 
that may result in identification of the child 
confidential in all their external contacts. 
Furthermore, the right to privacy also means 
that the records of child offenders shall be 
kept strictly confidential and closed to third 
parties except for those directly involved 
in the investigation, adjudication and 
disposition of the case. With a view to avoiding 
stigmatization and/or prejudgements, records 
of child offenders shall not be used in adult 
proceedings in subsequent cases involving 
the same offender (see the ‘Beijing Rules‘, 
rules 21.1 and 21.2), or to enhance such future 
sentencing. The Committee recommends States 
Parties to introduce rules which would allow 
for an automatic removal from the criminal 
records the name of the child who committed 
an offence upon reaching the age of 18, or 
for certain limited, serious offences where 
removal is possible at the request of the child, 
if necessary under certain conditions (e.g. not 
having committed an offence within two years 
after the last conviction).” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 10, 2007, 
CRC/C/GC/10, para. 23 l. See also article 40, page 
601.)
The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules 
for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, the 
“Beijing Rules”, expands on the provision in art-
icle 40 of the Convention. Rule 8.1 states: “The 
juvenile’s right to privacy shall be respected at 
all stages in order to avoid harm being caused to 
her or him by undue publicity or by the process of 
labelling. 2. In principle, no information that may 
lead to the identification of a juvenile offender 
shall be published.”
The official Commentary to the Rules explains: 
“Rule 8 stresses the importance of the protection 
of the juvenile’s right to privacy. Young persons 
are particularly susceptible to stigmatization. 
Criminological research into labelling processes 
has provided evidence of the detrimental effects 
(of different kinds) resulting from the permanent 
identification of young persons as ‘delinquent’ or 
‘criminal’. Rule 8 also stresses the importance of 
protecting the juvenile from the adverse effects 
that may result from the publication in the mass 
media of information about the case (for example 
the names of young offenders, alleged or con-
victed). The interest of the individual should be 
protected and upheld, at least in principle.”
Particular protection of the privacy of juveniles is 
also provided for in article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
requires that “any judgement rendered in a crim-
inal case or in a suit at law shall be made pub-
lic except where the interest of juvenile persons 
otherwise requires or the proceedings concern 
matrimonial disputes or the guardianship of chil-
dren” (article 14(1)).
In the outline prepared for its Day of General 
Discussion on “The child and the media”, the 
Committee noted the importance of the child’s 
right to privacy in media reporting not only of 
juvenile justice cases but also of child abuse and 
family problems (see article 17, page 218):
“It is important that the media themselves do 
not abuse children. The integrity of the child 
should be protected in reporting about, for 
instance, involvement in criminal activities, 
sexual abuse and family problems. Fortunately, 
the media in some countries have voluntarily 
agreed to respect guidelines which offer such 
protection of the privacy of the child; however, 
such ethical standards are not always adhered 
to.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report 
on the eleventh session, January 1996, CRC/C/50, 
Annex IX, p. 80)
Among the recommendations that arose during 
the General Discussion was one that stated spe-
cific guidelines should be prepared for reporting 
on child abuse, 
“... on how to report and at the same time 
protect the dignity of the children involved. 
Special emphasis should be placed on the issue 
of not exposing the identity of the child.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the thirteenth session, September/October 1996, 
CRC/C/57, para. 256)
It has raised these issues with individual States:
“The Committee notes with concern that ‘the 
identity of child offenders, rape victims or 
children in difficult circumstances continues to 
be disclosed in the media’ (para. 124), which 
is a clear infringement of article 16 of the 
Convention.
“The Committee urges the State Party to 
establish mechanisms to ensure that all 
materials broadcast in Nepal respect the child’s 
right to privacy such as a code of conduct 
and/or self-regulation, and to ensure that 
appropriate human rights training is given 
to media professionals, paying particular 
attention to children’s rights to privacy.” (Nepal 
CRC/C/15/Add.261, paras. 45 and 46)
“The Committee shares the State Party’s concern 
that the privacy of children who have been 
victims of abuse or in conflict with the law is 
not always respected by the press, as certain 
newspapers continue to report cases in a 
manner that makes it easy to identify the child, 
publish their photograph and names or make

the child relate the details of the abuse. The 
Committee also notes that there is no legislation 
to ensure children’s privacy by the media. 
“The Committee recommends that the 
State Party take all necessary legislative 
measures to fully protect the right of the 
child to privacy and to support the initiatives 
of the Ombudsperson for Children in this 
domain, including the proposals of drafting 
a Code of Ethics. In addition, the Committee 
recommends that the State Party provide 
trainings on the principles and provisions 
of the Convention to chief editors and 
journalists.” (Mauritius CRC/C/MUS/CO/2, 
paras. 35 and 36)
“While noting the existence of national 
legislation which protect children’s right to 
privacy and despite the efforts of the State 
Party, the Committee notes with concern 
that the identities and photos of child victims 
are presented in the media, which is a clear 
infringement of article 16 of the Convention 
and of domestic law respecting the privacy of 
the child.
“The Committee urges the State Party to 
establish mechanisms such as a code of 
conduct and/or self-regulation to ensure that 
all materials broadcast in Thailand respect 
the child’s right to privacy. The Committee 
also urges the State Party to ensure that 
appropriate human rights training is given 
to media professionals, paying particular 
attention to children’s rights to privacy.” 
(Thailand CRC/C/THA/CO/2, paras. 35 and 36)
The public advertising of children for fostering 
or adoption may raise issues of privacy where it 
involves using photographs and intimate details 
of children without their informed consent.
Files on children
Most children have some records or reports writ-
ten about them and stored – in health, educa-
tion, social services, and juvenile justice systems 
(see also article 8 on preservation of the child’s 
identity, page 114). Rights to privacy require that 
legislation should ensure that the child
• knows of the existence of information stored 
about him or her;
• knows why such information is stored and by 
whom it is controlled;
• has access to such records, whether stored 
manually or by electronic means;
• is able to challenge and, if necessary, correct 
their content, if necessary through recourse to 
an independent body. 
Legislation should limit who else has access to 
the information stored; such access must not 
be arbitrary and must be in line with the whole 
Convention. The child should know who else has 
access.
The Human Rights Committee, in its General 
Comment on the similar article on privacy rights 
in the International Covenant, states: “The gather-
ing and holding of personal information on com-
puters, data banks and other devices, whether by 
public authorities or private individuals or bod-
ies, must be regulated by law. Effective measures 
have to be taken by States to ensure that infor-
mation concerning a person’s private life does 
not reach the hands of persons who are not autho-
rized by law to receive, process and use it, and 
is never used for purposes incompatible with the 
Covenant. In order to have the most effective pro-
tection of his private life, every individual should 
have the right to ascertain in an intelligible form, 
whether, and if so, what personal data is stored 
in automatic data files, and for what purposes. 
Every individual should also be able to ascertain 
which public authorities or private individuals or 
bodies control or may control their files. If such 
files contain incorrect personal data or have been 
collected or processed contrary to the provisions 
of the law, every individual should have the right 
to request rectification or elimination.” (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 16, 
1988, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 10, p. 183)
In relation to files used in juvenile justice sys-
tems, the “Beijing Rules” (which the Committee 
has commended as providing appropriate mini-
mum standards) requires in rule 21(1): “Records 
of juvenile offenders shall be kept strictly confi-
dential and closed to third parties. Access to such 
records shall be limited to persons directly con-
cerned with the disposition of the case at hand 
and other duly authorized persons.” Rule 21(2): 
“Records of juvenile offenders shall not be used 
in adult proceedings in subsequent cases involv-
ing the same offender.” The official commentary 
states: “The rule attempts to achieve a balance 
between conflicting interests connected with 
records or files: those of the police, prosecution 
and other authorities in improving control versus 
the interests of the juvenile offender (see also rule 
8). ‘Other duly authorized persons’ would gener-
ally include, among others, researchers.”
The United Nations Rules for the Protection of 
Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty provides 
more detail: “All reports, including legal records, 
medical records and records of disciplinary pro-
ceedings, and all other documents relating to the 
form, content and details of treatment, should be 
placed in a confidential individual file, which 
should be kept up to date, accessible only to

authorized persons and classified in such a way 
as to be easily understood. Where possible, every 
juvenile should have the right to contest any fact 
or opinion contained in his or her file so as to 
permit rectification of inaccurate, unfounded or 
unfair statements. In order to exercise this right, 
there should be procedures that allow an appro-
priate third party to have access to and to consult 
the file on request. Upon release, the records of 
juveniles shall be sealed, and, at an appropriate 
time, expunged.” (Rule 19) 
“family”
The term “family” has a broad interpretation 
under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
including parents “or, where applicable, the mem-
bers of the extended family or community as pro-
vided for by local custom” (article 5), and the 
Committee has emphasized this interpretation 
in its examination of States Parties’ reports (see 
article 5, page 76).
In its General Comment on privacy, quoted above, 
the Human Rights Committee states: “Regarding 
the term ‘family’, the objectives of the Covenant 
require that for purposes of article 17 this term 
be given a broad interpretation to include all 
those comprising the family as understood in the 
society of the State Party concerned...” (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 16, 
1988, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 5, p. 182)
Any arrangements permitting interference with a 
child’s family must be set out in the law and must 
not be arbitrary, must be compatible with the 
other principles and provisions of the Convention, 
and must be reasonable in the particular circum-
stances. Article 9 is especially relevant, set-
ting out the conditions for any separation of the 
child from his or her parents. Article 16 extends 
this to the child’s wider family, such as siblings 
or grandparents, who may be as important to the 
child. The child must have access to a complaints 
procedure and appropriate remedies in cases of 
violation of the right.
Article 37(c) of the Convention specifically 
requires that the child deprived of his or her lib-
erty “shall have the right to maintain contact with 
his or her family through correspondence and 
visits, save in exceptional circumstances”.
“home”
The Human Rights Committee interprets “home” 
as follows: “The term ‘home’ in English ... is to 
be understood to indicate the place where a per-
son resides or carries out his usual occupation”. 
The Human Rights Committee also notes that 
“Searches of a person’s home should be restricted 
to a search for necessary evidence and should not 
be allowed to amount to harassment.” (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 16, 
1988, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 8, p. 182) 
Thus “home” will include, for some children, 
places of alternative care, including various 
categories of residential institutions, boarding 
schools, places of detention, long-stay hospitals 
and so forth.
Any arrangements permitting interference with a 
child’s home, such as searching it, must be set out 
in the law and must not be arbitrary, must be com-
patible with the other principles and provisions of 
the Convention, and must be reasonable in the 
particular circumstances. Eviction of a family 
from its home would have to meet these tests. For 
children living in alternative care, moves from 
one “home” to another or closure of an institution 
must not unreasonably breach the child’s right. 
The child must have access to a complaints pro-
cedure and appropriate remedies in cases of vio-
lation of the right.
“or correspondence”
All children have the right not to have their cor-
respondence – letters and other forms of commu-
nication, including telephone calls – interfered 
with arbitrarily or unlawfully, in their family or 
wherever else they may be. 
The Committee commented to Austria:
“The Committee is concerned at the 
information from children and adolescents 
that their right to privacy, for example, with 
regard to personal correspondence, is not fully 
respected in everyday life.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take the necessary measures, such as 
awareness-raising and educational campaigns, 
to improve the understanding of and respect 
for the child’s right to privacy among parents 
and other professionals working for and with 
children.” (Austria CRC/C/15/Add.251, paras. 33 
and 34)
Any arrangements permitting interference with a 
child’s correspondence, such as opening, reading, 
or limiting it and so forth, must be set out in the 
law and must not be arbitrary, must be compati-
ble with the other principles and provisions of the 
Convention and must be reasonable in the partic-
ular circumstances. The child must have access to 
a complaints procedure and appropriate remedies 
in cases of violation of the right.
The Human Rights Committee commented on 
the privacy article in the Covenant: “Compliance 
with article 17 requires that the integrity and

confidentiality of correspondence should be guar-
anteed de jure and de facto. Correspondence 
should be delivered to the addressee without inter-
ception and without being opened or otherwise 
read. Surveillance, whether electronic or other-
wise, interceptions of telephonic, telegraphic and 
other forms of communication, wire-tapping and 
recording of conversations should be prohibited...” 
(Human Rights Committee, General Comment 
No. 16, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 8, p. 182)
As noted above, under article 37 of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, every child deprived 
of liberty has the right to maintain contact with 
his or her family through correspondence and 
visits, save in exceptional circumstances. The 
United Nations Rules for the Protection of 
Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty states: “Every 
juvenile should have the right to communicate in 
writing or by telephone at least twice a week with 
the person of his or her choice, unless legally 
restricted, and should be assisted as necessary in 
order effectively to enjoy this right. Every juve-
nile should have the right to receive correspon-
dence.” (Rule 61) 
“nor to unlawful attacks 
on his or her honour 
or reputation”
Most, if not all, countries have laws to protect 
adults from attacks on their honour or reputa-
tion – both verbal attacks (slander) and attacks in 
writing and/or through the media (libel). This pro-
vision requires that the child should be protected 
equally under the law. The law must set out the 
protection, and the child must have an effective 
remedy in law against those responsible.
The Human Rights Committee comments on the 
identically worded provision in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: “Article 
17 affords protection to personal honour and 
reputation and States are under an obligation to 
provide adequate legislation to that end. Provision 
must also be made for everyone effectively to 
be able to protect himself against any unlaw-
ful attacks that do occur and to have an effec-
tive remedy against those responsible.” (Human 
Rights Committee, General Comment No. 16, 
1988, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 11, p. 183)
As noted above, in the report of its 1996 Day 
of General Discussion on “The child and the 
media”, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child expressed concern at images of chil-
dren – both individual and collective images – 
portrayed by the media (see also article 17, 
page 218):
“In their reporting the media give an ‘image’ 
of the child; they reflect and influence 
perceptions about who children are and how 
they behave. This image could create and 
convey respect for young people; however, it 
could also spread prejudices and stereotypes 
which may have a negative influence on public 
opinion and politicians. Nuanced and well-
informed reporting is to the benefit of the 
rights of the child...” (Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, Report on the eleventh session, January 
1996, CRC/C/50, Annex IX, pp. 80 and 81)
The Committee commented on media attacks on 
children in Nicaragua:
“The Committee shares the concern expressed 
by the State Party about the fact that 
children are often abused in the media to the 
detriment of their personality and status as 
minors...
“The Committee recommends that, on an 
urgent basis, measures be taken to ensure the 
protection of the child from information and 
material injurious to his or her well-being and 
to protect the child’s right to privacy, in the 
light of the provisions of articles 16 and 17 of 
the Convention.” (Nicaragua CRC/C/15/Add.36, 
paras. 17 and 34)
The child’s right to 
the protection of the law 
against such interference 
or attacks: article 16(2)
As noted above, in its General Comment, the 
Human Rights Committee states that interfer-
ence with the right to privacy can only take place 
in ways defined in law, which must not be arbi-
trary, must comply with the provisions, aims and 
objectives of the Covenant (similarly, in relation 
to article 16 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, interference must comply with the 
principles and provisions of the Convention) and 
be reasonable in the particular circumstances. 
In addition the State should enable individuals 
to complain when they believe their rights have 
been violated and to have appropriate remedies 
(Human Rights Committee, General Comment 
No. 16, 1988, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8, para. 6, p. 182).

to the child and in line with the detailed aims for 
education set out in article 29. The media should 
also be accessible to the child, promoting and 
respecting the participatory rights to respect for 
the views of children (article 12). 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
noted the key role that the media can play in

Convention on the Rights of the Child widely 
rticle 17 is particularly focused 
on the role of the mass media in 
relation to children’s rights but 
includes a general obligation on 
States Parties to ensure that the child has access 
to information and material from diverse sources 
– especially those aimed at promoting well-
being and physical and mental health. This is 
closely linked to the child’s right to freedom of 
expression (article 13), and to maximum devel-
opment (article 6). The media must be encour-
Text of Article 17

ensure that the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and 
international sources, especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social, spiritual 
and moral well-being and physical and mental health. To this end, States Parties shall:
 
(a) Encourage the mass media to disseminate information and material of social and 
cultural benefit to the child and in accordance with the spirit of article 29;
 
(b) Encourage international cooperation in the production, exchange and dissemination of

sion, one member of the Working Group sug-

known to children and adults, in fulfilment of the 
Convention’s article 42. The media can also be 
crucial in exposing and reporting on breaches of 
the rights of the child.
During the drafting of the Convention, article 
17 started out as a measure simply to protect the 
child “against any harmful influence that mass 
media, and in particular the radio, film, tele-
vision, printed materials and exhibitions, on 
account of their contents, may exert on his mental 
and moral development”. But early in its discus-
The child and the media
Committee on the Rights of the Child, Day of General Discussion, 1996: 
recommendations
The following recommendations arose during the plenary and working group sessions of the Day 
of General Discussion:
1. Child media: A dossier should be compiled on positive, practical experiences of active child 
participation in the media.
2. Child forum within Internet: The UNICEF-initiated “Voices of Youth” on the World Wide Web 
should be promoted and advertised as a positive facility for international discussion on impor-
tant issues among young people.
3. Active child libraries: The experience of dynamic child libraries, or child departments within 
public libraries, should be documented and disseminated.
4. Media education: Knowledge about the media, their impact and their functioning should be 
imparted in schools at all levels. Students should be enabled to relate to and use the media in a 
participatory manner, as well as to learn how to decode media messages, including in advertis-
ing. Good experiences in some countries should be made available to others.
5. State support to media for children: There is a need for budgetary support to ensure the pro-
duction and dissemination of children’s books, magazines and papers, music, theatre and other 
artistic expressions for children, as well as child-oriented films and videos. Assistance through 
international cooperation should also support media and art for children.
6. Constructive agreements with media companies to protect children against harmful influences: 
Facts should be gathered about various attempts at voluntary agreements with media companies 
on positive measures, such as not broadcasting violent programmes during certain hours, clear 
presentations before programmes about their content and the development of technical devices 
such as ‘V-chips’, to help consumers to block out certain types of programmes. Likewise, expe-
riences with respect to the introduction of voluntary ethical standards and mechanisms to 
encourage respect for them should be assembled and evaluated; this should include an analysis 
of the effectiveness of existing codes of conduct, professional guidelines, press councils, broad-
casting councils, press ombudsmen and similar bodies.
7. Comprehensive national plans to empower parents in the media market: Governments should 
initiate a national discussion on means to promote positive alternatives to the negative tenden-
cies of the media market, to encourage media knowledge and to support parents in their role as 
guides to their children in relation to electronic and other media. An international workshop 
should be organized to promote a discussion on this approach.
8. Advice on implementation of article 17 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child: A study 
should be conducted with the purpose of developing advice to Governments on how they could 
encourage the development of “guidelines for the protection of the child from information and

The “important function 
performed by the mass media”
In the report of its Day of General Discussion on 
“The child and the media”, the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child stressed various media roles in 
relation to full implementation of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, including, but going 
beyond, the scope of article 17:
“The Committee on the Rights of the Child 
believes that the media – both written and 
audiovisual – are highly important in the 
efforts to make reality [of] the principles 
and standards of the Convention. The media 
in many countries have already contributed 
greatly in creating an awareness of the 
Convention and its content. The media could 
also play a pivotal role in monitoring the actual 
implementation of the rights of the child...”
The Committee also highlighted the importance 
of children having access to the media: 
“Finally, the media is important for offering 
children the possibility of expressing 
themselves. One of the principles of the 
Convention is that the views of children be 
heard and given due respect (art. 12). This 
is also reflected in articles about freedom 
of expression, thought, conscience and 
religion (arts. 13-14). It is in the spirit of these 
provisions that children should not only be 
able to consume information material but 
also to participate themselves in the media. 
This requires that there exist media which 
communicate with children. The Committee 
on the Rights of the Child has noted that 
there have been experiments in several 
countries to develop child-oriented media; 
some daily newspapers have special pages for 
children and radio and television programmes 
also devote special segments for the young 
audience. Further efforts are, however, 
needed.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
Report on the eleventh session, January 1996, 
CRC/C/50, Annex IX, pp. 80 and 81. For the 
Committee’s comments on the potentially harmful 
influence of the media, see below, page 225.) 
The Committee returned to this theme in recom-
mendations adopted following its 2006 Day of 
General Discussion on “The right of the child to 
be heard”:
“The Committee recognizes the essential role 
played by media in promoting awareness of 
the right of the child to express their views and 
urges various forms of media, such as radio 
and television, to dedicate further resources 
to including children in the development of 
programmes and allowing for children to 
develop and lead media initiatives on their 
rights.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
material injurious to his or her well-being.” Such a study should also serve the purpose of assist-
ing the Committee on the Rights of the Child in drafting a General Comment on article 17.
9. Specific guidelines for reporting on child abuse: To encourage further discussion in newsrooms 
and within the media community as a whole, guidelines should be drafted by appropriate jour-
nalism bodies on how to report on abuse of children and at the same time protect the dignity of 
the children involved. Special emphasis should be placed on the issue of not exposing the iden-
tity of the child.
10. Material for journalism education on child rights: Material should be produced to assist journal-
ism and media schools on child rights standards; established procedures for child rights moni-
toring; existing international, regional and national institutions working with children; as well 
as basic aspects of child development. The manual planned by the Centre for Human Rights of 
the United Nations as a tool for journalists’ education on human rights should be widely dis-
seminated when it is produced.
11. Network for media watchgroups: The positive work of media watchgroups in various coun-
tries should be encouraged and good ideas transferred between countries. The purpose is to 
give media consumers a voice in the discussion on media ethics and children. A focal point for 
exchanges should be established.
12. Service to “child rights correspondents”: Interested journalists should be invited to sign up on a 
list of “child rights correspondents”. They should be provided regularly with information about 
important child issues and with interesting reports by others, and be seen as media advisers to 
the international child rights community.

Report on the forty-third session, September 2006, 
Day of General Discussion, Recommendations,
para. 36)
Ensuring the child “has access 
to information ... from a 
diversity of national and
 international sources” 
– especially those aimed 
at promoting well-being and 
physical and mental health
The Committee regards article 17 as one of chil-
dren’s civil rights and frequently expresses a 
general concern at the lack of attention paid to 
implementation of children’s civil rights and 
freedoms, including those provided by articles 13, 
14, 15, 16 and 17. 
This section of article 17 provides the overall aim 
for the five particular strategies outlined in para-
graphs (a) to (e). They are related to the child’s par-
ticipation rights under article 12 and the right to 
freedom of expression under article 13(1), which 
“shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of 
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media of the 
child’s choice” (see page 177). They relate to the 
role of the media in promoting the child’s maxi-
mum development under article 6, and also to the 
aims of education (article 29), and the need for 
health education (article 24). In addition, article 
31 states the right of the child to participate freely 
and fully in cultural and artistic life, and the 
State’s obligation to encourage the provision of 
appropriate and equal opportunities; here, too, the 
media can play an important role (see page 469). 
In its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing 
child rights in early childhood”, the Committee 
refers to the information needs of young children 
(and also to the need to protect them from harm-
ful information – see below, page 225):
“… Early childhood is a specialist market for 
publishers and media producers, who should 
be encouraged to disseminate material that 
is appropriate to the capacities and interests 
of young children, socially and educationally 
beneficial to their well-being, and which 
reflects the national and regional diversities of 
children’s circumstances, culture and language. 
Particular attention should be given to the 
need of minority groups for access to media 
that promote their recognition and social 
inclusion…” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, General Comment No. 7, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/
Rev.1, para. 35)
The Committee has noted both controls on 
information, limiting its diversity, and gaps in 
children’s access to appropriate information, 
sometimes in particular regions, for example rural 
areas, and has proposed some specific solutions:
“The Committee is concerned that children 
have poor access to information. 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party improve children’s access to information, 
inter alia by providing greater access to 
newspapers and libraries, including materials 
in the Sango language, and to radio…” (Central 
African Republic CRC/C/15/Add.138, paras. 42 
and 43) 
“The Committee notes with concern that 
children living in the outer islands do not have 
adequate access to information and material 
from a diversity of national and international 
sources aimed at promoting the child’s 
development and physical and mental health… 
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party reinforce measures for the production 
of programmes and books for children and 
disseminate them within the country, in 
particular the outer islands, and in this regard 
envisage taking steps for the introduction of 
the use of computers in schools…” (Marshall 
Islands CRC/C/15/Add.139, paras. 34 and 35)
“The Committee is concerned that children and 
their families who do not speak, read or write 
Greek fluently, and children from some isolated 
regions of the State Party and from some 
distinct ethnic, religious, linguistic or cultural 
groups do not always have adequate access to 
information regarding, for example, welfare or 
legal assistance, and information reflecting the 
multicultural nature of the State Party…
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party:
(a) Make additional efforts to ensure that 
all children and their families have access to 
essential information regarding their rights, 
giving particular attention to isolated groups 
and those who do not communicate easily in 
Greek;
(b) Promote the development and accessibility, 
including through radio and television, of 
a wide variety of information reflecting 
the cultural diversity of the State Party’s 
population;…” (Greece CRC/C/15/Add.170, 
paras. 46 and 47)
“The Committee is concerned that:
(a) Children have insufficient access to 
appropriate information;
(b) Children living in rural communities are 
particularly disadvantaged;…
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party:
(a) Continue and strengthen its efforts 
to ensure that all children have access to 
appropriate information, for example 
through further elaboration of radio 
programmes for children, the provision of

radios and newspapers for use by groups of 
children in schools and other contexts, and 
through itinerant theatre presentations;…” 
(Mozambique CRC/C/15/Add.172, paras. 36 
and 37)
“The Committee notes that article 22 of the 
1993 Child Law refers to access to information, 
but is concerned that many children, notably 
those living in remote and border areas, do 
not have adequate access to appropriate 
information.
“In the light of article 17, the Committee 
recommends that the State Party take all 
appropriate measures to ensure that all 
children, in particular those in remote and 
border areas, are provided with adequate 
access to information.” (Myanmar CRC/C/15/
Add.237, paras. 36 and 37)
“The Committee expresses concern about 
the fact that all sources of information 
– and media in particular – are subject to 
Government’s control and do not allow 
for diversity. Furthermore, the Committee, 
sharing the concerns recently expressed by 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, regrets that access to foreign 
culture and media, including the Internet, is 
very limited.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party, in line with articles 13 and 17 of the 
Convention, ensure the right of the child 
to access information and material from a 
diversity of national and international sources, 
especially those aimed at the promotion of his 
or her social, spiritual and moral well-being 
and physical and mental health. The State 
Party should also take steps to expand access 
to the Internet…” (Turkmenistan CRC/C/TKM/
CO/1, paras. 32 and 33)
Health promotion
In the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
another particular reference to children’s need for 
information appears under article 24, in which 
States Parties are required to take appropri-
ate measures to ensure that parents and children 
are informed about child health and various spe-
cific health issues (article 24(2)(e)). Here, too, the 
media can play an important role. The Committee 
addresses this in two General Comments. In its 
General Comment No. 4 on “Adolescent health 
and development in the context of the Convention 
on the rights of the child”, it states:
“Adolescents have the right to access 
adequate information essential for their 
health and development and for their ability 
to participate meaningfully in society. It is the 
obligation of States Parties to ensure that all 
adolescent girls and boys, both in and out of 
school, are provided with, and not denied, 
accurate and appropriate information on 
how to protect their health and development 
and practise healthy behaviours. This should 
include information on the use and abuse, of 
tobacco, alcohol and other substances, safe 
and respectful social and sexual behaviours, 
diet and physical activity.” (Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 4, 2003, 
CRC/GC/2003/4, para. 26)
In its General Comment No. 3 on “HIV/AIDS and 
the rights of the child”, the Committee empha-
sizes the need for information on prevention and 
care and information to combat ignorance, stig-
matization and discrimination, through both 
formal channels (e.g., through educational oppor-
tunities and child-targeted media) as well as 
informal channels (e.g., those targeting street chil-
dren, institutionalized children or children living 
in difficult circumstances) (General Comment 
No. 3, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/3, paras. 16 and 17). 
For further discussion of health information, see 
article 24, page 359.
Children whose liberty is restricted. The 
United Nations Rules for the Protection of 
Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty highlights 
access to the media: “Juveniles should have the 
opportunity to keep themselves informed regu-
larly of the news by reading newspapers, peri-
odicals and other publications, through access to 
radio and television programmes and motion pic-
tures...” (Rule 62) Special consideration may need 
to be given to children’s access to the media in 
any institutional placement and in other special 
circumstances.
“Encourage the mass media to 
disseminate information and 
material of social and cultural 
benefit to the child and in 
accordance with the spirit of 
article 29”: article 17(a)
Article 29(1) sets out the aims for the education 
of the child. Article 17 suggests that the content 
of information and material disseminated by the 
media should be in accordance with these aims, 
which are directed to:
• development of the child’s personality, talents 
and mental and physical abilities to their full-
est potential;
• development of respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, and for the princi-
ples enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations;
• development of respect for 
• the child’s parents;

• the child’s cultural identity, language and 
values;
• the national values of:
◆ the country in which the child is living;
◆ the country from which he or she may 
originate;
• civilizations different from his or her own;
• preparation of the child for responsible life in 
a free society, in the spirit of understanding, 
peace, tolerance, equality of sexes and friend-
ship among all peoples, ethnic national and 
religious groups and persons of indigenous 
origin;
• development of respect for the natural envi-
ronment.
In its first General Comment on “The aims of 
education”, the Committee notes:
“The media, broadly defined, also have a 
central role to play both in promoting the 
values and aims reflected in article 29(1) and in 
ensuring that their activities do not undermine 
the efforts of others to promote those 
objectives. Governments are obligated by the 
Convention, pursuant to article 17(a), to take 
all appropriate steps to ‘encourage the mass 
media to disseminate information and material 
of social and cultural benefit to the child’.” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 1, 2001, CRC/GC/2001/1, para. 21. 
See also article 29, page 439.)
The Committee has emphasized the responsibil-
ity of the media to contribute to fostering “under-
standing, peace, tolerance” and so on, as set out 
in article 29(1)(d):
“The Committee also recommends, in the 
interests of healing and trust-building within 
the country and in the spirit of article 17 of 
the Convention, that the State-controlled 
mass media should play an active role in the 
efforts to secure tolerance and understanding 
between different ethnic groups, and that 
the broadcasting of programmes which would 
run counter to this objective come to an end.” 
(Croatia CRC/C/15/Add.52, para. 20)
When it examined Croatia’s Second Report, the 
Committee re-emphasized this:
“The Committee reiterates its recommendation 
that the State Party takes measures aimed 
at developing a culture of tolerance in the 
society at large through all possible channels, 
including the schools, the media and the law…
“… the Committee is also concerned with the 
lack of adequate measures to encourage the 
mass media to disseminate information which 
would promote the spirit of understanding of 
differences.
“The Committee … urges the State Party to 
disseminate information and material of social 
and cultural benefit to the child, in line and 
with the spirit of articles 17 and 29 of the 
Convention. To that aim, the State Party should 
provide children with access to diversity of 
cultural, national and international sources, 
particularly taking into account the linguistic 
and other needs of children who belong to 
a minority group.” (Croatia CRC/C/15/Add.243, 
paras. 22, 35 and 36)
In 1978, the General Conference of UNESCO 
proclaimed the Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles concerning the Contribution of the 
Mass Media to Strengthening Peace and Interna-
tional Understanding, to the Promotion of Human 
Rights and to Countering Racialism, Apartheid 
and Incitement to War.
The World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intol-
erance (Durban, South Africa, September 2001) 
in its Declaration expresses deep concern “about 
the use of new information technologies, such 
as the Internet, for purposes contrary to respect 
for human values, equality, nondiscrimina-
tion, respect for others and tolerance, including 
to propagate racism, racial hatred, xenophobia, 
racial discrimination and related intolerance, 
and that, in particular, children and youth hav-
ing access to this material could be negatively 
influenced by it.” (A/CONF.189/12, Declaration, 
para. 91)
Another of the aims set out in article 29 is pro-
moting equality of the sexes. The report of the 
Committee’s Day of General Discussion on “The 
girl child” refers to 
“… the importance of eradicating degrading 
and exploitative images of girls and women 
in the media and advertising. The values and 
models of behaviour that were portrayed 
contributed to the perpetuation of inequality 
and inferiority.” (Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, Report on the eighth session, January 1995, 
CRC/C/38, para. 291)
Under the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, adopted in December 2006, 
States undertake to adopt immediate, effec-
tive and appropriate measures to encourage all 
organs of the media “to portray persons with 
disabilities in a manner consistent with the pur-
pose of the present Convention” (article 8(2)(c)). 
The Standard Rules on the Equalization of 
Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, in 
rule 1 on “Awareness-raising”, proposes: “States 
should encourage the portrayal of persons with 
disabilities by the mass media in a positive way; 
organizations of persons with disabilities should 
be consulted on this matter.” In addition, rule 9 
suggests that the media should be encouraged 
to play an important part in removing negative

attitudes “towards marriage, sexuality and par-
enthood of persons with disabilities, especially of 
girls and women with disabilities, which still pre-
vail in society.”
Further advice on the role of the media in the 
positive socialization of children is given in the 
United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of 
Juvenile Delinquency, the Riyadh Guidelines, 
which the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
has consistently commended as providing appro-
priate standards for implementation of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Within the 
section on “Socialization processes”, a subsection 
on the mass media reads:
“40. The mass media should be encouraged to 
ensure that young persons have access to infor-
mation and material from a diversity of national 
and international sources.
41. The mass media should be encouraged to por-
tray the positive contribution of young persons to 
society.
42. The mass media should be encouraged to dis-
seminate information on the existence of services, 
facilities and opportunities for young persons in 
society.
43. The mass media generally, and the television 
and film media in particular, should be encour-
aged to minimize the level of pornography, drugs 
and violence portrayed and to display violence 
and exploitation disfavourably, as well as to avoid 
demeaning and degrading presentations, espe-
cially of children, women and interpersonal rela-
tions, and to promote egalitarian principles and 
roles.
44. The mass media should be aware of its exten-
sive social role and responsibility, as well as its 
influence, in communications relating to youth-
ful drug and alcohol abuse. It should use its power 
for drug abuse prevention by relaying consistent 
messages through a balanced approach. Effective 
drug awareness campaigns at all levels should be 
promoted.”
“Encourage international 
cooperation in the production, 
exchange and dissemination of 
such information and material 
from a diversity of cultural, 
national and international 
sources”: article 17(b)
This provision reflects a focus on international 
cooperation to achieve full implementation, 
found throughout the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. It also emphasizes the diversity of 
material that should be available to the child. 
Modern technology is dramatically affecting the 
instant dissemination of information, increas-
ing the potential of the media for education and 
development, while also raising concerns about 
the aims and content of some information being 
made available to children.
“Encourage the production and
dissemination of children’s 
books”: article 17(c)
Late in the drafting process of article 17, a non-
governmental organization proposed that there 
should be a specific provision to promote chil-
dren’s reading. The International Board on Books 
for Young People proposed a new subparagraph: 
“Encourage, at all levels, literacy and the read-
ing habit through children’s book production 
and dissemination, as well as the habit of story-
telling” (E/CN.4/1987/25, p. 7; Detrick, p. 287). 
The provision in subparagraph (c) developed from 
this proposal.
UNESCO has for many years promoted publi-
cation of children’s literature, together with the 
major professional bodies and NGOs.
The Committee commends States which ensure 
access to books, congratulating Madagascar, for 
example, on 
“... the establishment of a library in all schools” 
(Madagascar CRC/C/15/Add.218, para. 36)
and Latvia on 
“… the measures taken by the State Party 
to encourage reading among children, in 
particular, through educational and library 
programmes.” (Latvia CRC/C/LVA/CO/2, paras. 28 
and 29) 
But it also expresses concern on occasions. 
For example:
“In the light of articles 13 and 17 of the 
Convention, the Committee is concerned 
that the quality and quantity of printed 
information, including children’s books, 
available to children has decreased in recent 
years, while at the same time there is a lack 
of mechanisms to protect children from 
information and material injurious to their 
well-being. Furthermore, the Committee is 
concerned that the amendments to the Media 
Law may limit access to information.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take all effective measures, including 
enacting or reviewing legislation where 
necessary, to ensure that the child’s freedom 
of expression and the right of access to 
information is guaranteed and implemented.” 
(Kazakhstan CRC/C/15/Add.213, paras. 34 and 35)

“Encourage the mass media 
to have particular regard to the 
linguistic needs of the child 
who belongs to a minority 
group or who is indigenous”: 
article 17(d)
Article 30 (see page 455) requires that the child 
who belongs to a religious or linguistic minority, 
or who is indigenous, should not be denied the 
right to enjoy his or her own culture, to profess 
and practice his or her own religion or to use his 
or her own language. The aims of education in 
article 29 also require respect for varying national 
values, cultures and languages. Article 17 indi-
cates the important role the mass media should 
be encouraged to play, for instance through 
producing material and programmes in minority 
languages.
In commenting on the need to make the principles 
and provisions of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child well known to adults and children 
(under article 42, see page 627), the Committee 
has often emphasized the importance of ensur-
ing translation into minority and indigenous 
languages, and the particular importance of the 
media’s participation in this task.
Ensuring that children with disabilities have 
equal access to information through the media 
may require special and additional arrangements. 
The Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, adopted in December 2006, requires 
States Parties to it to take all appropriate mea-
sures to ensure that persons with disabilities can 
exercise the right to freedom of expression and 
opinion, including the freedom to seek, receive 
and impart information and ideas on an equal 
basis with others and through all forms of com-
munication of their choice, including by:
“(a) Providing information intended for the gen-
eral public to persons with disabilities in acces-
sible formats and technologies appropriate to 
different kinds of disabilities in a timely manner 
and without additional cost;
(b) Accepting and facilitating the use of sign lan-
guages, Braille, augmentative and alternative 
communication, and all other accessible means, 
modes and formats of communication of their 
choice by persons with disabilities in official 
interactions;
(c) Urging private entities that provide services to 
the general public, including through the Internet, 
to provide information and services in accessible 
and usable formats for persons with disabilities;
(d) Encouraging the mass media, including pro-
viders of information through the Internet, to 
make their services accessible to persons with 
disabilities;
(e) Recognizing and promoting the use of sign 
languages.” (Article 21)
The Committee notes in its General Comment 
No. 9 on “The rights of children with disabilities”:
“Access to information and communications, 
including information and communications 
technologies and systems, enables children 
with disabilities to live independently and 
participate fully in all aspects of life. Children 
with disabilities and their caregivers should 
have access to information concerning their 
disabilities that educates them on the process 
of disability, including causes, management 
and prognosis. This knowledge is extremely 
valuable as it not only enables them to adjust 
to their disabilities, it also allows them to 
be involved and make informed decisions 
regarding their own care. Children with 
disabilities should also have the appropriate 
technology and other services and languages, 
e.g. Braille and sign language, that enables 
them to access all forms of media, including 
television, radio and printed material as well 
as new information and communication 
technologies and systems, such as the 
Internet.” (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
General Comment No. 9, 2006, CRC/C/GC/9, 
para. 37. See also article 23, page 321.)
Encourage the development 
of appropriate guidelines for 
the protection of the child from
information and material 
injurious to his or her well-
being, bearing in mind the 
provisions of articles 13
and 18”: article 17(e)
Increasing concern exists in many countries about 
the potential negative effects on children’s devel-
opment, including physical and mental health, 
of the projection of violence through the mass 
media. In the report of its General Discussion 
on “The child and the media”, the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child highlighted this point and 
other negative aspects of the media:
“... Concern has also been expressed about the 
influence on children of negative aspects of 
the media, primarily programmes containing 
brutal violence and pornography. There is 
discussion in a number of countries about 
how to protect children from violence on 
television, in video films and in other modern 
media. Again, voluntary agreements have 
been attempted, with varied impact. This

particular problem is raised in article 17 of 
the Convention which recommends that 
appropriate guidelines be developed ‘for the 
protection of the child from information and 
material injurious to his or her well-being’.
“Such guidelines have indeed been developed 
in some countries, with varied results…” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, Report on 
the eleventh session, January 1996, CRC/C/50, 
Annex IX, pp. 80 and 81)
In Its General Comment No. 7 on “Implementing 
child rights in early childhood”, the Committee 
highlights the particular dangers for young chil-
dren:
“… Rapid increases in the variety and 
accessibility of modern technologies, including 
Internet-based media, are a particular cause 
for concern. Young children are especially at 
risk if they are exposed to inappropriate or 
offensive material. States Parties are urged 
to regulate media production and delivery in 
ways that protect young children, as well as 
support parents/caregivers to fulfil their child-
rearing responsibilities in this regard (art. 18).” 
(Committee on the Rights of the Child, General 
Comment No. 7, 2005, CRC/C/GC/7/Rev.1, para. 35)
Article 17 proposes guidelines, suggesting volun-
tary rather than legislative controls. In developing 
guidelines, States Parties must bear in mind the 
provisions in two other articles:
• the child’s right to freedom of expression, 
which can only be subject to certain limited 
restrictions, set out in paragraph 2 of article 
13 (see page 180);
• parents’ 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
the 
upbringing and development of the child, with 
the child’s best interests as their basic concern, 
and the State’s obligation to provide appropri-
ate assistance (article 18, see page 237).
Article 5, requiring respect for parents’ rights to 
provide appropriate direction and guidance con-
sistent with the evolving capacities of the child, 
is also relevant. Ultimately, it is parents and other 
caregivers who will have primary responsibility 
for supervising their child’s use of the media. The 
State should assist parents, for example, by ensur-
ing that they have adequate information about 
the content of television programmes, videos, 
computer games, use of the Internet and mobile 
technology and so on.
The recommendations which arose from the 
Committee’s Day of General Discussion on “The 
child and the media” include developing con-
structive agreements with media companies to 
protect children against harmful influences, 
comprehensive plans to empower parents in 
the media market, training of journalists, and 
specific guidelines for reporting on child abuse 
(see box, page 218). 
The Committee frequently notes the absence of 
adequate protection from potentially injurious 
material – including violence, racism and por-
nography – in its examination of States Parties’ 
reports and it has proposed legislation and guide-
lines as well as parent education. Its concerns 
have extended to cover modern information 
and communications technology, including the 
Internet and mobile telephones:
“The Committee is concerned that children 
have easy access to pornographic DVDs sold 
locally.
“In the light of article 17(e) of the Convention, 
the Committee recommends that the 
State Party take all necessary measures to 
protect children from exposure to harmful 
information, including pornography…” (Sao 
Tome and Principe CRC/C/15/Add.235, paras. 31 
and 32)
“The Committee is concerned at the absence 
of appropriate laws or guidelines relating to 
the sale or accessibility of CD-ROMs, video 
cassettes and games, and pornographic 
publications facilitating access of a child to 
information and materials which may be 
injurious to her or his well-being.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party take necessary measures, including legal 
ones, to protect children from harmful effects 
of violence and pornography, in particular, in 
printed, electronic and audiovisual media.” 
(France CRC/C/15/Add.240, paras. 27 and 28)
“While the Committee welcomes the State 
Party’s measures in this respect… it still 
expresses concern about the exposure of 
children to violence, racism and pornography, 
especially through the Internet.
“The Committee recommends that the State 
Party continue and strengthen its efforts 
to protect children effectively from being 
exposed to violence, racism and pornography 
through mobile technology, video movies, 
games and other technologies, including the 
Internet. The Committee further suggests 
that the State Party develop programmes and 
strategies to use mobile technology, media 
advertisements and the Internet to raise 
awareness among both children and parents 
on information and material injurious to 
the well-being of children. The State Party 
is also encouraged to develop agreements 
with journalists and media with a view to 
protecting children from exposure to harmful 
information in the media and improving the 
quality of information addressed to them.” 
(Australia CRC/C15/Add.268, paras. 33 and 34)
“While welcoming the initiatives undertaken 
by the Media Council to study children’s use

226
of the Internet and develop a set of ‘rules 
of the road’ for such use, the Committee is 
nevertheless concerned about the amount 
of unsuitable and illegal material that can be 
found on the Internet.
“The Committee encourages the State Party 
to ensure that children are protected from 
information and material harmful to their 
well-being, in conformity to article 17(e) of the 
Convention.” (Denmark CRC/C/DNK/CO/3, 
paras. 29 and 30)
“… While noting that the draft Measures for 
the Suppression of Provocative Materials Act 
is pending before the Cabinet, the Committee 
is concerned that some of the materials 
published in the media and available through 
the Internet are harmful to the child. Further, 
the Committee, while noting the efforts of the 
Ministry for Information and Communication 
Technology, expresses its concern that no 
systematic media-monitoring mechanisms 
exist at the national and subnational levels 
to protect children from being exposed to 
harmful information, such as violence and 
pornography, transmitted through the media 
and through the Internet.
“The Committee recommends that, through 
cooperation with radio and television 
broadcasters, mechanisms be established 
to monitor and improve the quality and 
suitability of media programming produced 
primarily for children and youth. Further, the 
Committee recommends, in light of article 17 
of the Convention, that the State Party take all 
necessary legal and other measures, including 
advisory campaigns directed to parents, 
guardians and teachers, and cooperation with 
Internet service providers to protect children 
from being exposed to harmful material such 
as violence and pornography, transmitted 
through the media and Internet.” (Thailand 
CRC/C/THA/CO/2, paras. 37 and 38)
Privacy of the child and the media 
One potential threat to the well-being of the child 
posed by the media relates to the child’s right to 
privacy (see article 16, page 208). In addition, 
article 40(2)(b)(vii) requires respect in media cov-
erage for the privacy of children involved in the 
juvenile justice system (see article 40, page 615), 
and the Committee has raised similar concerns 
about the privacy of child victims of abuse and of 
family problems. 
Guidelines on witnesses and victims
The Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving 
Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime highlights 
this in a section on privacy: “Child victims and 
witnesses should have their privacy protected as a 
matter of primary importance.
“Information relating to a child’s involvement in 
the justice process should be protected. This can 
be achieved through maintaining confidentiality 
and restricting disclosure of information that may 
lead to identification of a child who is a victim or 
witness in the justice process.
“Measures should be taken to protect chil-
dren from undue exposure to the public by, for 
example, excluding the public and the media from 
the courtroom during the child’s testimony, where 
permitted by national law.” (Economic and Social 
Council resolution 2005/20, July 2005, section X, 
paras. 26 to 28)
